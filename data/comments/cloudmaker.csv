cloudmaker,3e3dmw,TheGardenShark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:01:48 2015 UTC,"My guess is that the Proteus VIR will be dead on arrival unfortunately. It won't even have a screen. Probably they will have a few fans but the devices will be overpriced and underwhelming.  Other than my negativity I don't have much to contribute on new exciting developments. I haven't heard of anyone working on anything really exciting.  Squonkers might be something to look at. Some movement there.  Or rebuildable subtanks. I haven't managed to get above ~25 watts sustained in temperature control mode. That's why I'm not looking at squonkers to get clouds and less hassle with constantly dripping.  What certainly would be interesting is a new 510 connection standard. I'm still having conductivity problems with some atomizers and nickel builds. A bottom feeding 510 is certainly not going to make that better haha.  Or maybe replaceable / externally chargeable LIPO batteries?  Oh there was some mention about a mod using super capacitors. That can charge in like 30 seconds but doesn't have much capacity. Something like that could be very interesting for a ""mini mod"" that you put down on a charge station in between puffs to recharge.   Ultra capacitors might actually be a way to create small but high power cigalikes. Just put your cigalike back into your ""pack"" to recharge quickly. Power and soaking up eliquid. And have a tiny circuit that can do temperature control for a very specific coil resistance. Maybe you could implement it as a tiny analog circuit? Just thinking out loud :)"

cloudmaker,3dze23,bakri11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:04:30 2015 UTC,"I think people saying August 15th was derived from optimistic interpretations of the initial quote we gave of 6-8 weeks manufacturing time for the initial production run, applied to the 7/1 pre-order start date, but that doesn't account for the pre-run tooling or QC/final prep in the US (1-2 weeks), plus shipping time from China to us, and thn on to customers/vendors.   The project is still on track to deliver the first pre-order units at the start of September, and we will be providing specific updates and details, including hopefully some cool content of the actual manufacturing process when we send Jeremy over to China, so that you guys know exactly what's going on with your devices as we keep moving along.

Secondary DC power adapters (a la IPV4) are the only real option, and who wants that (a la IPV4S haha)? The DNA and SX will charge USB if you're an emergency of that sort, but you'll need some battery power remaining to use the unit while plugged in, if you must do so."
cloudmaker,3d3nje,returnity,2,Tue Jul 14 02:31:08 2015 UTC,"It would have to be a custom module / panel to work.  There are plenty of ways to do true passthrough, a 40a raptor would be kind of neat.  I have an OKR-T10 50W passthrough I keep in my car for longer drives.  One could even do a dna200 passthrough connected to a 12v 25a power supply (no battery).  Obviously this isn't really a commercially viable concept, but one could do it if they were so inclined."
cloudmaker,3d3nje,anubis1127,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:17:37 2015 UTC,For either the DNA or SX mini thats a lot of amps for a power supply.

cloudmaker,3d3nje,anubis1127,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:19:41 2015 UTC,Even a good PC PSU can work well. A good one can easily put 60 amps through the 12v rail.

Cloudmaker Tech, with the Whiteout, has this possibility, has this potential.  I, for one, urge you to consider this idea.  I, for one, would instantly frame it, and hang it in my office.  Maybe with a picture of myself vaping on that mod.    You guys have a laser printer, nice, semi thick rag paper is relatively cheap.

cloudmaker,3chxda,iNach,5,Wed Jul 8 01:33:34 2015 UTC,It should take about three hours tops because there are 3x 1000mah lipo's here.
cloudmaker,3chxda,ilikechainsaws,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:44:03 2015 UTC,"Wrong, they are in series, charge time will be about an hour or less depending on the low voltage cutoff.  Charger is sending 1 amp at approx 12.6 volts, the voltage is divided into the 3 cells so it's sending 4+ volts at 1 amp into each cell simultaneously.  If they were in parallel it could only send 4+ volts, at 1 amp it would take up to 3 hours because the amperage would be divided into 3 cells."
cloudmaker,3chxda,mstave,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:07:14 2015 UTC,"Here is a pretty good LiPo battery page (http://www.rchelicopterfun.com/rc-lipo-batteries.html) as far as I can tell, you can charge these batteries faster (and lose lifetime quickly) Or more slowly and extend lifetime.  The battery chargers I read about that are sophisticated enough to charge more slowly, charge to 4.15v (doubling lifetime, and relatively simple to use run between $25 and 50.  Hope this helps (I realize it doesn't answer your question, but I don't yet have the technical specs on the charger built into the mod to estimate charging time)  edit - Of course it might help the relevance of my posts to read what has already been written in response ;-P"

cloudmaker,3chxda,elitegunslinger,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:40:33 2015 UTC,Depending on the cell I think we could do 1.3 amps on the 1300mah battery but 1 amp on the 1000mah; wasn't the rule of thumb the cell size divided by 1000? I remember charging my 4500 mah cells at 4.5 amps.
cloudmaker,3chxda,Hugh_Jass_Clouds,2,Thu Jul 9 13:13:46 2015 UTC,"I was strictly refernceing time to charge. With any battery you have 2 C rates. One is for charge and the other discharge. On lipos you take a 1500 mAh cell and give it a 10C discharge rate for 15 amps. Take that same cell and say it has a 5C charge rate. That means you can charge it at 3 amps. So yes C rates are basicly a multiple 1000 of what a cell can do. It also means that the higher your C rates the faster you can safely charge and discharge your batteries, but just because you can discharge at 15 amps does not mean you need to discharge it and charge it on max all the time."
cloudmaker,3chxda,elitegunslinger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:28:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed, charging at max kills the life of lipos."
cloudmaker,3chxda,ilikechainsaws,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:36:16 2015 UTC,A 1500 mah cell with a 5c charge rating could be charged at 7.5 amps.  (1500/1000)*5=7.5
cloudmaker,3chxda,ilikechainsaws,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:04:24 2015 UTC,"Nope, it will take an hour or less.  Charger sends 1 amp at 13.6 volts, so it puts 1 amp into each of the 3 1000mah cells at the same time.  A 3 x 1000mah cell parallel pack would take 3 hours at 1 amp because the charger could only send 4.2 volts and the 1 amp would be divided between the cells."
cloudmaker,3chxda,Hugh_Jass_Clouds,0,Wed Jul 15 05:12:49 2015 UTC,If you have one amp of input you will get ~.33 amp of charge for each of the 3 cells at 1 amp. If each cell had a dedicated 1 amp line for charging then each cell would charge in 1 hour with the pack receiving a 3 amp total charge load.
cloudmaker,3chxda,ilikechainsaws,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:25:02 2015 UTC,"Nope.  It's wired series.  What you are saying applies to battery packs wired in parallel.  Just like wiring the cells in series multiplies the output voltage, it also divides the charge voltage.  The charge voltage is triple what the voltage is from a single cell charger.  A 3s 1 amp charger is like 3x 1 amp single cell chargers wired in series.  So all 3 cells are getting 1 amp each and a 3s 1000mah battery will charge in an hour from a 1 amp charger."

cloudmaker,3c1zsj,onijin,2,Sat Jul 4 10:10:24 2015 UTC,"I think first you read up on what is happening when you are using temp control wire (short version - your mod calculates the temp by watching the coil resistance change as the temp changes, then limits the power so that the resistance of your coil stays sort the same - meaning the temp stays sort of the same).  Google is your friend is finding explanations that suite your level of geeky interest.  Then go to  Steam Engine Vape Calculator (http://www.steam-engine.org) and take a look at how many wraps you need for NI200 or TI wire given the kind of coils you make.  On this site, you can also view what happens when you mix wires (NI is very soft, fiddly to build with, can mix with Kanthal - TI has a different ohm/temp graph then NI - need to set temp lower, etc).  Then order some wire, order some NI coils or TI coils and the atomizer that uses them.  If you have spare cash, might consider ordering an inexpensive TC 40W boxmod, but research what you consider, some of these have chips that are hard to work with.  Hope this helps.

cloudmaker,3c0yr2,housry23,5,Fri Jul 3 19:36:30 2015 UTC,"I was one of those people in the live Twitch broadcast and I asked several times. Finally, Ian responded and said that the $4.00 upgrade to the panel kit REPLACES the front solid one (pointless to do the back side as it is mostly the plastic of the battery sled).  Personally, I think it's a bad deal and SHOULD include one solid and one clear (even if it means paying more than $4.00 for the upgrade). I put this in my notes in my order as I don't think this was thought out completely.  As it stands right now, in order to have both in one color, you need to order one solid kit for $19.99 and another with the clear panel for $23.99.

You had 3 or 4 employees in there and none of them were fielding any questions in chat during the Q & A. Instead they just kicked up a couple questions for you to answer and ignored the rest."
cloudmaker,3c2evj,blitz206,4,Sat Jul 4 03:42:08 2015 UTC,"Actually, we aren't new to this at all - but regardless, I am here to help you right now. Let's get this solved, it's more effective than venting frustrations :)  Edit: thanks for emailing!"
cloudmaker,3c2evj,twoshotracer,-4,Sat Jul 4 03:45:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for getting back to me. I got the Opus 200 in today with the 1000Mah battery. Its alright but not great (lifetime of lipo) the cloudmaker is coming with 1000Mah at first with a 1300Mah possible upgrade or is it coming with a 1300Mah off the rip? The reason I bring this up is because the website still says 1300Mah (pending) and I am sure some people will see that and just expect the 1300Mah. So if you know what battery will be with it you should change the info
cloudmaker,3c2evj,Cestults,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:55:19 2015 UTC,"if its pending, i would guess they dont know"
cloudmaker,3c2evj,TheGardenShark,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:40:59 2015 UTC,"I spoke to a member of the staff about this, here's a link with more info https://www.reddit.com/r/cloudmaker/comments/3bvkpw/does_the_whiteout_dna_come_with_batteries/csq3ib2"
cloudmaker,3c2evj,dandondandon,2,Sat Jul 4 14:33:24 2015 UTC,"How long have you waited for the reply back?  Remember, theres only 5 people on the team"
cloudmaker,3c2evj,dandondandon,2,Sat Jul 4 03:21:29 2015 UTC,"What makes you think you don't get the red panel as well? On the panel kit page, it says: ""*Note: If you add the Clear Panel, you will still receive the standard color panel."""
cloudmaker,3c2evj,aaronrexroot,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:06:25 2015 UTC,thats new
cloudmaker,3c2evj,blkforge,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:45:16 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, well it's good that they have it on there now, then. Did your stuff get all worked out?"
cloudmaker,3c2evj,dandondandon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:59:46 2015 UTC,"Awesome that they are addressing desires/concerns from the community. Not the easiest with different threads and subreddits, but they are trying. Honestly surprised they didn't increase the price a bit if they weren't going to originally include both plates.  Also, about the 1000 v 1300 on a thread earlier I believe they state that it will come with a 1000 mah battery, but the 1300 mah will be available but will need extender kits to make them fit."
cloudmaker,3c2evj,blkforge,-2,Sat Jul 4 06:03:20 2015 UTC,Yes that is what they said in the twitch stream 1000mah upgradable to 1300mah but the website says 1300 Mah. I guarantee if they do not change it there will be people that order it expecting 1300 Mah and there will be at least 1 asshole that files a chargeback immediately because the item is not as described. Its the joys of running an ecommerce site.
cloudmaker,3c2evj,dandondandon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:48:30 2015 UTC,"Well, that sucks...especially since we were given the wrong information in the Twitch feed and that was not on the website yesterday.  I ordered without because I was spamming along with Dave over and over and finally Ian answered in chat that if you ordered with the clear panel you would NOT get the regular panel. Now due to a measly $4.00 I won't be getting the clear panel...doh!"
cloudmaker,3byism,returnity,2,Fri Jul 3 05:10:51 2015 UTC,"Hey Ian :) Appreciate the work you and the rest of the staff have done.

I don't believe the wiring is easily upgradeable but I am not sure. Hopefully someone who knows will chime in.

cloudmaker,3bx7k5,slickerxcuh,2,Thu Jul 2 22:08:26 2015 UTC,I too am curious about this.  Also confused as to whether this will be a better deal than the bundle Smog has going right now.
cloudmaker,3bx7k5,girtgirtgirt,2,Thu Jul 2 23:42:13 2015 UTC,From what I gather it's Smog: $189.99 plus $11.99 bottle of juice and Cloudmaker website: $179.99.  Smog's got changed to a single bottle of juice instead of all three which brought it back in line. So I guess it depends if you want to save $10 or get a chance to try some new juice. This is just from what I've read but could change/be different.
cloudmaker,3bx7k5,Kerplunk_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:06:39 2015 UTC,And the $179.99 is with the subscription code?  Thank you for responding!
cloudmaker,3bx7k5,girtgirtgirt,2,Fri Jul 3 00:14:53 2015 UTC,"Completely forgot to mention that, yeah with the code I believe.  As I said, this is just stuff I have read from Smog/Cloudmaker and could end up changing but hopefully it gives you some idea :)"
cloudmaker,3bx7k5,Kerplunk_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:19:09 2015 UTC,Cool. Works for me! Thanks again!
cloudmaker,3bx7k5,girtgirtgirt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:12:06 2015 UTC,What is up with Smog changing it from the first 100 getting a good reward? Seems pretty sketchy to drop a bonus like that.
cloudmaker,3bx7k5,Shiftaspeed,3,Fri Jul 3 00:36:55 2015 UTC,"Nothing got dropped. First 100 get their Hastur, and every order in the first 24 hours gets the full SMOGjuice lineup! Our posts have been edited so no one is confused when they order now, since those 100 Whiteouts are already sold. Ask everyone in /r/SmogGB if Smog would pull anything like sketch like that."
cloudmaker,3bx7k5,returnity,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:39:51 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks for the update! I'm already camped out on twitch waiting for the stream! You guys are the best.
cloudmaker,3bx7k5,Shiftaspeed,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:46:57 2015 UTC,So do the goodies from Smog go to the first 100 orders of each model or the first 100 orders total?  And how can you tell if ur one of the first 100? I ordered when the site still had the whole bundle listed but have no way to confirm i was one if first 100 :/
cloudmaker,3bx7k5,Ventrixed,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:38:53 2015 UTC,"Didn't include that because the first 100 had already been sold, sorry for confusion. Was just talking about ordering through Smog now vs Cloudmaker."

And you will be able to simply swap your depleted battery with a fully charged one.
cloudmaker,3bvyq8,Cestults,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:15:41 2015 UTC,Awesome. Thanks for the reply
cloudmaker,3bvyq8,plaguevape,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:17:20 2015 UTC,I'd be sweet if you guys included one so we can take it out since the chargers I use for USB are universal on PC but also use the android chargers :p
cloudmaker,3bvyq8,RiderDragon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:40:50 2015 UTC,Yea hoping for external charger as well. excited to see the full site and options. already got mine preordered with Smog
cloudmaker,3bvyq8,elitegunslinger,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:25:45 2015 UTC,You can use any hobby charger for a lipo 3s externally.
cloudmaker,3bvoh6,Hara-K1ri,3,Thu Jul 2 15:09:12 2015 UTC,"As the other commenters here said, your best bet is going through Smog Distribution (disclaimer: I'm a partner there). Cloudmaker Tech will be shipping & wholesaling internationally too, so you'll be covered regardless (and if you have a favorite vendor, please get them to reach out to us at sales@cloudmakertech.com!), but I'm not in charge of the specifics for CMT's shipping/logistics for int'l orders...  At Smog, we ship internationally for a flat-rate of $12.75 per order (half that for Canada), we combine shipments if possible, and we'll declare low valuations wherever possible to save you money. We get a lot of international orders because we're cheaper and usually faster to deliver new products than EU B&M's and overseas-specific websites.  Also, if you order before the Whiteout pre-order at the official Cloudmaker site goes live, you'll get 3 free 30mL bottles of my own SMOGjuice liquids, as a thank you from me personally for all the support! I know you'll love my flavors!"
cloudmaker,3bvoh6,returnity,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:02:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this information, Smog Distribution does sound like the way to go, I've just had some customs issues in the past. This made me reluctant to take the 'risk' of ordering outside of the EU. I still got a few hours to think about it. Getting a refund on a boxmod that failed on me (Evic-VT), so it seems like a good idea to put those extra funds towards a great device."
cloudmaker,3bvoh6,sjugge,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:49:10 2015 UTC,There will be a flat shipping fee of 12 something and a little something something to ensure customs doesn't break the bank. Info is repeated from what /u/returnity has stated on several occasions. If you hop on over to /r/ecr_eu you'll see quite a few (Re-)posts on cloudmaker topics. The comments hold some scattered but insightful EU-centric info.  Edit: Returnity's comment has all the good info
cloudmaker,3bvoh6,returnity,3,Thu Jul 2 15:36:57 2015 UTC,"To clarify, what you mentioned is for SmogDistro's pre-order! CloudmakerTech will ship internationally as well, but I don't have the specifics on how our store calculates international order shipping, but I do know that I've never seen anyone beat Smog for international shipping prices."
cloudmaker,3bvoh6,sjugge,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:55:03 2015 UTC,I see. Thanks for the clarification!
cloudmaker,3bvoh6,Kerplunk_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:57:28 2015 UTC,"Shipping from Smog came to $12.75 to the UK which is one of the cheapest international shipping I've used. A lot of vendors will ensure that customs aren't a problem, probably better to speak to them before hand though to see if they're willing to do it."
cloudmaker,3bvoh6,returnity,3,Thu Jul 2 15:47:18 2015 UTC,"At Smog, we've got a lot of experience shipping int'l, so we're able to offer great pricing and we write down low declarations value to save you money wherever possible. Thanks for your support & the info!"

cloudmaker,3bvkpw,lordfransie,3,Thu Jul 2 14:39:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, as we've stated, the Whiteout DNA does indeed come with a 3S lipo included. It would be unsafe to expect our buyers to spec & install their own LiPo, and we wouldn't shortchange you guys like that anyway.  We plan to offer extras as well on our site in the future, with more information forthcoming this week!"
cloudmaker,3bvkpw,returnity,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:47:39 2015 UTC,Thank you very much. A lot of my information regarding the DNA comes from the Smog preorder page and that doesn't mention the batteries. Thank you for the response Returnity. I'm incredibly excited about this. It's going to be awesome.  Will the ares be able to use LiPo?
cloudmaker,3bvkpw,anubis1127,2,Thu Jul 2 14:55:39 2015 UTC,The smog preorder page has the battery info btw.  Battery 3S LiPo 1300mAh (pending)
cloudmaker,3bvkpw,returnity,0,Thu Jul 2 16:32:47 2015 UTC,"Those are the specs for the chip, not necessarily and admittance to include it."
cloudmaker,3bvkpw,anubis1127,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:29:19 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's (preliminary) info for the battery -- the mAh is not a spec for the DNA, it could run off any 3S LiPo. Currently, we're in final testing with our final choices of suppliers to try and cram 1300mAH into this device by all means necessary. And the LiPo will be included, no matter what size ends up being the biggest we can fit -- we'll note that more clearly now, thanks!"
cloudmaker,3bvkpw,returnity,2,Thu Jul 2 18:09:53 2015 UTC,I thought it was clear before?  Oh well.
cloudmaker,3bvkpw,thrwbak,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:33:39 2015 UTC,"You're very welcome, I'm a huge fan of the Whiteout and I REALLY want to see it succeed. Will the ARES be able to support LiPo?"
cloudmaker,3bvkpw,Elocmada,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:07:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I know this is old, but I wanted to be sure you were answered -- At this point, DNA->Ares kits will likely include a dual-18650 sled but we're still investigating both 1) options for using PWM to downregulate the power of the 3S to feed the SX and Ares, and 2) a LiPo Build Kit for the other Whiteouts, so while at the moment the answer is not a yes, the long-term answer is almost surely yes. The Ares can definitely use a LiPo with the correct input voltage, but the 3S is not just plug-and-play because of the 11.1V nominal voltage. Does that make sense?"
cloudmaker,3bvkpw,returnity,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:48:31 2015 UTC,"That makes perfect sense. That's about 2x as much voltage as it would be using with 18650. I have 2 DNAs coming in, when could I buy an ares and an SX kit? I want to be able to do anything so I'd love to have dates on that."
cloudmaker,3bvkpw,Cestults,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:25:53 2015 UTC,"I think that its been transparent from the beginning. There could be a 300mah variation in provided lipo for the dna. I dont see that as a big deal, I know its there and either way it works for me."
cloudmaker,3bvkpw,returnity,-3,Fri Jul 3 01:35:14 2015 UTC,They really haven't offered too much information huh
cloudmaker,3bvkpw,TKOA67,12,Thu Jul 2 14:41:56 2015 UTC,"We've answered this question before, explained the state of the DNA lipo supplier vetting & selection process, & even written a battery knowledge base article that includes  a section on Lipo packs. What information can I offer you that we haven't posted about already? We try to be as transparent and forthcoming as possible, but it's difficult to answer every question while also ensuring that these unforeseen launch day hiccups get handled. We're only human and there's only 5 of us. Please let me know what I can do to help resolve your concerns."
cloudmaker,3bvgl7,lordfransie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:04:29 2015 UTC,I'm not sure about an API but from what i read it uses the same chip as an Arduino MEGA. Might be compatible with the Arduino IDE then.

cloudmaker,3bvgl7,mrp1nk1e,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:24:23 2015 UTC,They did say that the Arduino IDE is compatible.

cloudmaker,3btqst,tehspamninja,2,Thu Jul 2 03:56:47 2015 UTC,I'm most concerned about the battery. Will it be swappable?  When will the capacity be confirmed?

cloudmaker,3btqst,Hydroxus_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:58:30 2015 UTC,"Yes. It's a soft limit, as the DNA40 had. If you want the full 200W, the cutoff is as-stated, but yeah, that's a great feature they've offered for a while now.   50A is the sustained continuous current, which is (IMO) the important spec."
cloudmaker,3btqst,returnity,2,Thu Jul 2 07:28:49 2015 UTC,Video of it in action was going to be shown tonight before the pre-order went live. Not sure if it's going to be shown tomorrow or what the fine details on that are.

The weight is perfect - enough weight to establish quality yet light enough to not be a burden. I don't have calipers handy, but I will try to get you some stacked measurements from the unit itself.   Overall, if you had no complaint about the size of the IPV4, you won't have an issue with the Whiteout. Cheers!"

I want to know the specifics of the battery that they are going to use before I commit my money to the DNA 200 version of the whiteout. I mean it would be fun to play with especially the software but if it has a 1000 mAh or 900 mAh battery than it's essentially like every other DNA 200 box mod I've heard of so far and I'll just wait for the Ares and save my money.

However 1 18650 has between 2100 mAh and 2600mAh x 2= 4200 mAh or 5200 mAh.

cloudmaker,3bp4dk,maniacpsycho,3,Wed Jul 1 08:42:30 2015 UTC,"I've posted this before but anyways... just a list of ideas for the Whiteout OS ranging from useful to crazy :)     Add different wire TCR curves for temperature control Add internal resistance calibration to make TC more precise Add a joule counter measurement to track battery health / liquid vaped each day Show the average watts used during a draw as a diagnostic on how well you build (or show watts / temp = heat flux?) Add a variable temperature mode where you directly control temp and just have watts to max Add an easily adjustable temperature curve (in % of set temp). Experiment with fluctuating heat waves to make vape interesting Add cool graphical animations for startup / vaping  Add a clock to the chip Dry coil detection! Dry burn function, have wires glow without having to scroll to change temperature If the GPIO pins of the pro micro will be usable: Attach a servo and a laser pointer to track and light up my clouds. Or maybe just an automatic squonker that reacts to dry hits? Firing by touching a metal drip tip with your lips - a german e-pipe mod maker does it this way. Not quite sure how this works though. Use addressable LEDs with the WS2812 chip to address tons of RGB diodes and do some fancy light show when firing Use a touch screen to control the device. Could be interesting to modulate the vape during the draw! No more buttons! No more buttons! I'd also love to add sounds. Not sure if the ADC on the pro micro will be suitable for this. I've had this idea a while back to add some kind of zip lighter sound when flipping it open. Or some crackling sound emulating burning tobacco. Just something ""cool"". And a farting noise when my dripper is emtpy (dry coil detection!) or the batteries are weak. Smounds would be a step further and crazier: There is a theory that sound affects how you perceive and enjoy flavors. Apparently even on a neurological level (and certainly subconsciously). Think of a fizzy drink or crunchy chips. So a mod that emits a sound could actually make your eliquid taste better without changing anything else! Maybe. Add a cheap IMU (gyroscope) so I can ask stupid questions, shake the mod and it says things like ""Very doubtful."" Last one: Fake screen glitches - it appears to be a must have feature for temp control chips! Even though it's already been kind of perfected by evolv...   Seriously the community driven open source firmware will be awesome. It's not hard to program and you'll have lots of people constantly trying to come up with ways to improve things. Different forks to choose from. Open source firmware for mods will soon be staple!"

cloudmaker,3bp4dk,flipwich,2,Wed Jul 1 05:20:31 2015 UTC,Calculating and tracking juice consumption. So the way I see it you have a training period where you input your juice consumption for a period of time and during that time it calculates an average juice consumption per firing time. After it has that it can track your daily/weekly consumption.
cloudmaker,3bp4dk,___on___on___,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:40:18 2015 UTC,That would be a bit tricky with all the different viscosities of juice.  I guess one could break down the ratios.

Like the SX350J... except that it doesn't show remaining battery voltage when in TC mode since it has the temp instead. I would love the battery indicator to show a % or actual voltage remaining right on the bar like a phone might.  Power blast - Like the DNA40 preheating only you determine more than one wattage the chip will use. Like a split second max of high power then it goes down to your determined setting, then regulates for TC as necessary. This way you can tell it how much power to throw out at once in case you are using very thin wire, instead of it pushing max powerand popping it. I've actually blown a coil in a DNA40 cuz of the preheat, so that's why I thought of this.  If it is at all possible to get battery health readings, that would be so sick."

cloudmaker,3bp9zi,karmapopsicle,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:16:48 2015 UTC,"I dont need something right this minute, it's just time for an upgrade to a more powerful box and i don't see the point in getting a Sig 150 or something of the like with this so close. My vaporshark will make it, and if that doesnt something else i have surely will. And what i was getting at is if the wait for the OS is only a couple of weeks delayed behind the other models, then i can live with that. However if the wait for the OS is a month or longer behind the others, well at that point i'd rather just get a solid chip in the box i've been waiting for to keep me happy until the Ares drops.  Sorry if this post was a little meandering. Using my phone, hope i made some sense lol."
cloudmaker,3bp9zi,DannyThrash89,2,Wed Jul 1 03:28:41 2015 UTC,Definitely the Ares. Can't go wrong with that amount of tinkering on a vape of all things!

cloudmaker,3bl4w4,FarkMcBark,2,Tue Jun 30 03:30:59 2015 UTC,"According to evolv it does support passthrough. From the early adopters forum:   You can certainly vape while connected to a USB charger. It turns the charging off while you are firing, and for about 5 seconds afterwards, so it won't stress the battery or the USB port to do so.    http://evolvapor.forumchitchat.com/post/passthrough-vape-while-charging-7490558"

cloudmaker,3bl4w4,iNach,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:27:39 2015 UTC,"Pass-through is a loosely used term in vaping.  A true passthrough will have no battery in the circuit.  All other USB chargeable devices are essentially constantly charging a battery that is being consumed.  So it's actually an unhealthy practice for your batteries.  Best practice is to discharge them until the board cuts off the batteries, and then recharge them uninterrupted until completely charged.    Keep in mind this is BEST PRACTICE and isn't always practical.  So we all know you'll steal some hits while charging."
cloudmaker,3bl4w4,gotmyownlifetolive,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:24:29 2015 UTC,The DNA200 does not support passthrough. You can view the data sheet here.
cloudmaker,3bl4w4,Luminescah,2,Tue Jun 30 05:42:53 2015 UTC,Where did you find that? I don't see it saying anything about passthrough
cloudmaker,3bl4w4,gotmyownlifetolive,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:56:06 2015 UTC,"Which is why I said it does not. If passthrough was supported, I assumed it'd be in the spec sheet from evolv. It may later turn out to be true."

cloudmaker,3bl4w4,Kerplunk_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:29:52 2015 UTC,If it doesn't have pass through does that mean that when it needs charging you just have to wait hours before you can vape again? New to DNA and LiPo so maybe I'm missing something.
cloudmaker,3bl4w4,OhShiznitz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:59:31 2015 UTC,Can you point me to where it says that? I didn't see anything about pass through.
cloudmaker,3bl4w4,FarkMcBark,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:04:36 2015 UTC,It's integrated. Apparently it's also a pretty good solution. From what I understand it's very rare to have balanced lipo charging through USB. They did it to make sure the lipo solution doesn't create a safety concern - safe charging is essential for that (and not stabbing the lipo pack with a knife).

Two things to note... this doesn't include corner radii/chamfers/other shapes, so devices may seem to be larger than they are in this (admittedly crude) depiction. The Whiteout, for example, has heavy corner radii that makes the device look and feel smaller than the footprint depicts. Number two - there are some small tweaks we are doing to the unit width to bring it down 3.5mm. This would put the Whiteout in line with the IPV3 for unit width.  Also - I will create a more detailed size comparison document including thickness for the same family of units.

cloudmaker,3bda2n,DrDoobie22,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:17:26 2015 UTC,"Read through our battery safety article here real quick. The max wattage is determined by the chip itself, with the max wattage currently being 120w. This will be upgradeable through firmware to 150w in the future. As for your builds, I'd suggest sticking in the .3-.6 range with regulated. You'll still get that warm vape at higher wattages and be well within the safe zone."
cloudmaker,3bda2n,gotmyownlifetolive,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:44:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I understand battery safety but am not really sure how choosing your wattage correlates with different builds since Im used to my build determining almost everything about my output and battery drain. On a regulated device what does selecting your wattage do? Say I build at .3 and use my device at 20w, 50w and 100w. What are the differences between those three wattage settings? Im guessing that using more wattage drains batteries quicker but thats not the only thing is it aside from the increase in power? Just trying to wrap my head around regulated."
cloudmaker,3bda2n,Wasabicannon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:46:50 2015 UTC,It comes down to Ohm's Law. http://www.steam-engine.org/ohm.asp  Using your numbers .3 ohms regulating to 20w will only use 2.45 volts. 50W uses 3.87 volts and 100w goes to 5.48 volts.  With unregulated you are always using the max volts your battery can push out. On a fresh charged battery this is 4.2 which with your .3 coil would be 58w. You would never be able to hit that .3 ohm could at 20w on an unregulated device.
cloudmaker,3bda2n,AK97214,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:54:52 2015 UTC,"Aaaaahhhh that makes more sense now, thank you!"
cloudmaker,3bda2n,AK97214,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:09:44 2015 UTC,"The most noticeable difference will be ramp up time, but 100 watts will ultimately get hotter than 20 watts, and much faster. Hopefully if you've been using an unregulated box you're familiar with Ohm's law. Two fully charged batteries in series will theoretically push 8.4 volts, but probably less considering voltage drop and battery sag.  TLDR: With a regulated box, every hit is more consistent, you can put in more wire and higher resistance builds."
cloudmaker,3bda2n,AK97214,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:55:48 2015 UTC,Def on ohms law. Always practice safe building amd battery usage. And yea my volt reader reads 3.9 on fresh charge in parallel and like 6.6 ish in series

Just on a custom PCB to measure the resistance of the coil and drive a mosfet to supply the power to the coil. Afaik it will be PWM. So you can simply download the Arduino IDE and hack away in C++ that is easy to use thanks to the arduino libraries..  So temperature control is definitely coming and there is no problem with implementing multiple modes for all kinds of wires. I certainly want to have this and plan to help with adding stuff to the firmware.   As for how you'll upgrade the chip, afaik you can just download the current firmware binary and upload it with a small utility. Customization like a custom boot logo / image could be done with a simple to use tool also, but this might take a bit. Of course if you want to configure it with for example custom behavior etc then you'll have to use arduino ide. Or wait for someone to implement it.  My guess is that initially it will be a bare bone simple firmware. And soon you'll have ""forks"" from other people adding stuff and alternatives you can try and more and more stuff will be added to the main branch."

cloudmaker,3bchrc,mstave,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:15:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's confusing. I bought one of the sunfounder kits from amazon and used the online documentation. They are available directly from arduino too. Basically you get some simple electronics chips and elements to get you started. Technically they are overpriced but if you don't know what to start with or where it's a good start I think.  I got the ""Super Starter Kit"" for Raspberry PI and bought a raspberry 2 separately, and a ""arduino pro micro"" you can get for like $5. That's a tiny chip you can connect and program with USB. But a kit with the arduino uno or mega r3 is probably better to get you started. There are lots of variations. I also got the teensy 3.1 for $20 which one of the smallest and faster than the arduino (and 3.3V instead of 5V). But for most things that doesn't matter.  The fun thing is to ""look behind the mirror"" so to speak and learn how all these digital gadgets today work - they are just programmable micro controllers - self contained simple computers on a single chip. And they can measure digital inputs, analog voltage or output PWM to emulate analog. I've never been a electronics or hardware guy before but it kind of feels empowering :) I'm a programmer so of course that side is easy for me. I've also found some amazing electronics tutorials from afrotechmods on youtube.   The whiteout OS / Ares chip will basically have the microcontroller of the arduino mega on a special board."

cloudmaker,3bbqvh,smrdave,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:11:02 2015 UTC,+1 Most important question.
cloudmaker,3bbqvh,Luminescah,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:16:11 2015 UTC,a positive answer would go a ways to quieting my mind
cloudmaker,3bbqvh,mstave,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:47:31 2015 UTC,For anyone concerned about the battery life:  The Wh rating of a 1300mah 3s Lipo is 14.43Wh.   Compared to 9.25Wh for a single Samnsung 25r or 18.5Wh for two Samnsung 25Rs.   So I'm thinking it'll have approximately 3/4 the battery life of an IPV4/Sigelei?
cloudmaker,3bbqvh,MiataTrySlide92,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:26:37 2015 UTC,"Also keep in mind that lipos have a 'C' rating which is the max output much like the amp limit on normal batteries.   The C rating on most lipos is considerably higher than that of li-on batteries, and with our usage, they are never pushed to that limit. So if you had say 25a batteries and at most you were pulling 8a, that is going to extend your battery life considerably.   The dna200 prototypes were using a 3s pack with 900mah capacity, but with them in series, they are pushing around 11v rather than the normal 3.7v and the board is regulating down, lowering the stress on the packs, resulting in extended life vs. 900mah at 3.7v lasting an hour or so.   Granted, at 200w they won't last long, but at a more reasonable level, say 50-75w they should last several hours to a day. The only downside is the safety concerns of lipo packs and the time it will take to charge. (the eVic VT is running 3s lipo and at 1a takes roughly 6 hours to charge) if you use an external say RC car charger this could be shortened considerably, provided the cells can handle higher input."

cloudmaker,3bbepr,Kerplunk_,3,Sat Jun 27 21:40:15 2015 UTC,Launch is a preorder so I'd assume they aren't produced yet but....
cloudmaker,3bbepr,jesusbuiltmyboxmod,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:19:53 2015 UTC,"Design is an iterative process. Prototypes are produced, revised, and manufactured. Most consumer product have 8 to 10 revisions during their lifecycle.   There are two types of mechanical revisions - non-interfering component revisions and system-stacking revisions. Non-interfering component revisions do not affect the assembly, so they are much easier to make during the manufacturing process. Something like, for example, the thickness of the front and back plates, would be an example of this."
cloudmaker,3bbepr,blitz206,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:00:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for clearing it up. I guess what you are talking about would be saving millimetres here and there as opposed to any drastic changes so can we assume the size in the FAQ is a good estimate?
cloudmaker,3bbepr,Kerplunk_,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:12:57 2015 UTC,"That's a good assumption.   Remember, we are already designing our compact unit, with the working name ""Revo"", that will rival the rDNA40 in size. You will have to sacrifice a certain amount of modularity, but it is aimed to be a more entry-level model at a cheaper price point. It will have the Ares - but we are looking at the possibilities of having the Revo be electronically modular unit as well. Thanks for the question!"

cloudmaker,3bbepr,gotmyownlifetolive,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:30:44 2015 UTC,Hi.   I just registered to be able to reply here.   Regarding size...  Personally I'm tired seeing 90mm and above. It's ridiculous. Size does matter and there is no excuse producing a 85 or above tall mod when the batteries are 65mm. Add a couple of tabs plus the wall thickness and and < 80mm is doable.   The smallest mod I built with a 18650 battery was a mini hana clone (72mm height) with a auth dna 40 and a 12mm  fireswitch (mitek 1208)  I'm not saying the guys at cloudmakers should match or beat that height but I think under 80mm would be realistic if even the cloupor mini could get away with 77mm.

I have some concerns about sharing private or sensitive information on your site though.  The first issue is hopefully just a technical concern. All of your assets are served from a domain using a *.wpengine.com SSL certificate: http://i.imgur.com/5LSpuYJ.png http://i.imgur.com/5jH8yYT.png  While this is only a minor issue it makes me seriously doubt the technical competence of whomever built/setup the site.  If you are expecting people to provide personal information and/or credit card details on your site you should take the appropriate measures to ensure the safety and security of their data.  An ecommerce extension that is hosted with your marketing blog is even close to the level of security that I expect.  I suggest that you split out your marketing/support/company site from your ecommerce site.

cloudmaker,3b91db,FarkMcBark,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:35:17 2015 UTC,Nice data!  Any ideas on the error bars on those temps?  Am also wondering about effect of coil geometry on the curves?
cloudmaker,3b91db,mstave,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:33:17 2015 UTC,Theoretically coil and wire diameter shouldn't affect the temperature readings. Of course you can always just adjust to taste :)  BTW the spreadsheet isn't from me it's from this thread: https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/tc-beyond-ni200-nickel-purity-dicodes-ti-ss-resistherm-nife30-coefficient-of-resistance.676506/

In addition to that, in todays market, community is everything and the focus on community with the whiteout really introduces a unique way for businesses to work with their customers and get everyone who's motivated involved in a project. I would love to see Ares start to get customized distributions, totally odd accessories and in general really fun stuff. imagine a whiteout robot that vapes?   the possibilities are endless. i could go on forever...... but i'll spare you guys!  happy to see things taken shape! big applause to team cloudmaker!!"

I am enrolled in Cloudmaker due to the confluence of community, crowd sourced ideas and applications, and the quality of discourse in these sub-reddits (low bar really, just no fart jokes and I'm impressed), not to leave out the notion of future proofing (actually reducing the giant collection of devices I have accumulated would be cool - they told me that I would save money vaping ....).

I've been vaping since January of 2011 and I can't even count how many new devices I've bought that I thought would be the last I'll ever buy. This one actually may fulfill that.    I also was an early adopter of android with the G1 so I know how many cool things an open source community can build so I am excited to see what can be done with the Ares chip.  Also looking forward to dimensions. I'm thinking of picking up something like this since I haven't really found an easy way to carry my boxes around.   edit found the dimensions in the wiki   What are the dimensions of the Whiteout?  4.25"" tall x 2.48"" wide x 1.08"" thick.

Though I'm sure my inner tinkerer will want to get my hands on every chip the thing that excites me most is that I am sure the community behind this will come up with some seriously amazing stuff. We already know Cloudmaker is going to be miles ahead of everyone else but I think the Ares in particular is really going to be the driving force of such amazing innovation. That's why I want the Ares to pop my Cloudmaker cherry.

The Ares (and the rest of the pre-orders, of course) should be available be the end of August."
cloudmaker,3b87j0,son_of_dry_cycle,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:24:15 2015 UTC,Honest curiosity - what sort of customization does the Ares offer out of the box?   I'm a software dev and the idea of hacking away on my vape makes me a little tingly in my bits.

cloudmaker,3b87j0,aaarrrrgggghhhh,2,Sat Jun 27 04:03:27 2015 UTC,"Ares chip here, same reasons as have been mentioned...open source and no lipo packs."
cloudmaker,3b87j0,Thersabugonmytv,2,Fri Jun 26 19:57:20 2015 UTC,Going with DNA   I've been dying for a dna chip
cloudmaker,3b87j0,thrwbak,2,Fri Jun 26 20:27:02 2015 UTC,I am getting the DNA and then the Ares. If one seems to live exclusively in the whiteout enclosure then the other will end up in hammond box or something.
cloudmaker,3b87j0,___on___on___,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:20:15 2015 UTC,i didnt even think of putting the chips in another enclosure. So even if you upgrade your chipset you can always re-purpose the old one. Brilliant!

cloudmaker,3b87j0,oregon_potential,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:26:34 2015 UTC,Does anyone know how much longer the Ares chip will take to come out after the DNA and Yihi?
cloudmaker,3b87j0,HooksNRounds,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:34:04 2015 UTC,"I'd really like to go Ares first, but since it won't be available day one, I'll likely start off with the DNA. DNA over the SX due to the software that I hear is available for the DNA. Having said that, I am a bit apprehensive of the lipo pack, so I have a lot of research to do on lipo packs before July 1.   In the end I think the Ares will stand out as a really awesome chip once all of us get our hands on it and are able to develop some great modules for it together. I'm really excited about this chip.   **Edit-spelling"
cloudmaker,3b87j0,thrwbak,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:48:28 2015 UTC,Anyone know how big the lipo is going to be? I've heard people are getting good life out of the 900mah in the beta unit...
cloudmaker,3b87j0,FarkMcBark,2,Fri Jun 26 21:06:47 2015 UTC,900mah in the beta unit is a 3S so its 3 900mah cells. With the room they have probably a 1500mah 3S thats pretty big and powerful.
cloudmaker,3b87j0,Dancin_Joe,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:22:46 2015 UTC,Wow.. 1500 would be great
cloudmaker,3b87j0,TheVapenessMonster,2,Sat Jun 27 00:05:33 2015 UTC,I've heard they are trying to squeeze in a 1300mah. But you could always look for a different lipo form factor and retrofit it yourself. You'd have to read up on how to handle lipos correctly of course.
cloudmaker,3b87j0,Hugh_Jass_Clouds,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:33:58 2015 UTC,I think I'm leaning more towards the Ares chip.
cloudmaker,3b87j0,TheVapenessMonster,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:32:20 2015 UTC,DNA & then Ares.. Eager to have a snowwolf killer
