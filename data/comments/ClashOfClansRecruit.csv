Truffle Butter (TB) is a competitive warring clan based in the US built around a core group of IRL friends who are active, generously donate, take wars seriously and most importantly, are just all around friendly group of people.  We are currently level 4 fielding 16 from our core group and wish to find enough to field more static 15v15 or 20v20 Wars. Members do a fair amount of research on base defenses and attack strategies for war. Our make up is a couple TH9s, majority TH8 and TH7, and 1 or 2 TH6s. We are learning the game and growing together.  We are looking to war at least 2 or 3 times a week (We have been warring back to back lately due to growing interests and stacking up of wins; current record is 33-6-2) We hope to recruit members that are at least TH4+/Level30+ and don't rush their TH progression.  If you are looking for a newly found clan that you can grow and build new relationships with then feel free to check us out and join us.  Clan Tag: #P8PLPJYP In Game Name: koolgoben  If you decide to join just say that I sent you."

We do have a war committee of players that are advanced attackers who give pointers and advice to others. We are always looking to add new people to that committee as well. To be honest, we almost value activity (donating, farming, and chatting in clan chat) as much as we do war performance. War performance is important as we put a lot of time and effort into war, but we also want to make sure the people we have in the clan are cool to hang out with in clan chat and not just someone who can 3 star bases but says nothing."

We are ranged from a few th7s to near max defense th10s (mostly th8 & th9) and we are looking for th7s and above that aren't too terribly rushed, although exceptions can be made if you are a lower th that looks to be progressing quickly or mildly rushed and have recently come to your senses.😉   Come by and check us out.

We're a small 15-20 war clan with a 90%+ win rate, mostly TH9's with a few TH8's in for good measure.  We're advanced in attacks- most of us hog, valk, loonian, or queenwalk based attacks.    Clan tag is #8PJYCRY8  I don't have a formally typed out requirement list- but we war at every opportunity.  The main things would be that your heroes are reasonable for a TH10 (20/20+), walls aren't a complete dumpster fire (at least skulls), and war stars in the 250+ range, preferably.  Feel free to throw in a join request and I'll review it, or you can pm me on here."

War Three Times a week. 20 - 25 people per war. Level 5 Clan. *We're a mix of half TH 8 and TH 9 so you can probably fit in easily for Wars. War is declared Monday Wednesday Friday at 8 PM. Attack twice. Try to donate if you are capable of making the requested troops.  Most of us are always on scouting and discussing attacks. We do take the one day off a week to farm or level heroes. Sit out as needed We are a MANDATORY 3 star clan. If you GoWiPe or GoWiWi you must have a plan for the backside. Worst case is you have great troops and are willing to learn or ask questions. We are always here to help. SAY IN APP YOU ARE FROM REDDIT so we can approve during war.

We are an adult clan seeking members that are 18 or older. We have done very well in wars in the past but do to a few inactive members and members not following more experienced clan members advice on attack strategy we are coming out of a pretty rough losing streak. We've cleaned house and gotten rid of all of the bad apples and are looking to build back up. We'd be very interested in having you join our clan and help us bring our clan, (and hopefully your new clan), back into its former glory.   The clan currently stands at 32 members, and we will be recruiting regularly, in hopes of swelling our ranks and waging larger wars. Most of our members are from the US and the UK, and there is usually someone on all the time to fill donations and b.s. with. Like I said above we are an adult clan and we like to joke around alot, but we also take our clash seriously. We are ranged from a few th7s to near max defense th10s (mostly th8 & th9) and we are looking for th7s and above that aren't too terribly rushed, although exceptions can be made if you are a lower th that looks to be progressing quickly or mildly rushed and have recently come to your senses.😉   Come by and check us out.

Anyways, on to the recruitment information!  Welcome to the Salt Miners Family! READ THE WHOLE POST. If you don't, we will know, and you WILL be rejected. The Salt Miners family is hovering at around 60 total members. Salt Miners is our Level 5, main warring clan. We are a serious war clan with serious, but still personable and friendly, members. We war three times a week, currently starting our search M/W/F. (Minors has alternate days, starting search Tu/Th/Sat). We distribute a lot of information on our Subreddit, you can find it at: Salt Miners.  Salt Miners – 65-7  To Be Accepted Into Our Family (the easy part):  *For full rules, see the Introduction Post This is required reading and it becomes extremely evident when people do not read these! Please read them  *Your base and troop levels cannot be rushed relative to your TH level.  You must go through our feeder and apply using the password ""MINERS*"" in your in-game request.  A good request would look like this: Saw you on Reddit, I'm a near maxed TH8 that loves to war. Password is ""MINERS*""  *People are typically promoted within 1-5 wars if they are competent using appropriate 3 star strategies, and meet all Salt Miners requirements  *You can skip the process of warring in the Minors if you share at least two replays of 3 star attacks. You need to be using an approved strategy against an opponent similar to what you'll see in war.  To Stay and Win Wars With Us  *Use approved strategies. We do not use 2 star strategies! GoWiPe is not approved unless specifically approved by a co-leader.  *We utilize the application clash.tools for base calling and tracking war stats. To even be considered to war with us, you must create an account and request to join our clan within 2 wars of joining.  *Your first War Attack must be reserved on clash.tools and you must manually enter the outcome (stars) of both your attacks on war day, before war day ends. Failure to do so results in suspensions and eventual kicking.  *Outside of in-game chat, we use the app LINE to communicate. It is not required to join the clan, but it is strongly encouraged to get it. You can request, and give, advice and feedback at all times of the day, utilizing links, base screenshots, etc. Members of both clans are active on LINE so you will have many more opinions and help available to you if utilized.  *Be mature and polite. Be open to feedback and demonstrate a willingness both to learn and help others. Donate only what is requested, Barch is default if unclear.  We have strong leadership and the willingness and ability to help you learn and prosper. If we are a good fit for you and you are a good fit for us, let's start Mining Salt together.

We war twice per week (constant during war boosts).  We use the rest of the week to farm/donate/upgrade Heroes, etc. We have over 40 strong adult, drama-free members who play and donate frequently. Many of us are in the USA (Ohio, Texas, DC, San Diego, etc) with a few spread around the globe. We have men & women and a few couples. All are solid players.   Hop in and be sure to mention me (@donniccolo) from Reddit so the other leaders know who you are & because if we're in a war they won't let you in without a reference. If you join us, attack as per our war strategy & donate only what is requested. Ask questions if you're unsure. Have fun! Cheers!"

Please look over all of our attached recruitment information and if you feel we are a good fit apply!  Welcome to the Salt Miners Family!  READ THE WHOLE POST. If you don't, we will know, and you WILL be rejected.  The Salt Miners family is hovering at around 60 total members. Salt Miners is our Level 5, main warring clan. We are a serious war clan with serious, but still personable and friendly, members. We war three times a week, currently starting our search M/W/F. (Minors has alternate days, starting search Tu/Th/Sat). We distribute a lot of information on our Subreddit, you can find it at: Salt Miners.  Salt Miners – 65-7  To Be Accepted Into Our Family (the easy part):   For full rules, see the Introduction Post This is required reading and it becomes extremely evident when people do not read these! Please read them Your base and troop levels cannot be rushed relative to your TH level. You must go through our feeder and apply using the password ""MINERS"" in your in-game request. A good request would look like this: Saw you on Reddit, I'm a near maxed TH8 that loves to war. Password is ""MINERS"" People are typically promoted within 1-5 wars if they are competent using appropriate 3 star strategies, and meet all Salt Miners requirements You can skip the process of warring in the Minors if you share at least two replays of 3 star attacks. You need to be using an approved strategy against an opponent similar to what you'll see in war.   To Stay and Win Wars With Us   Use approved strategies. We do not use 2 star strategies! GoWiPe is not approved unless specifically approved by a co-leader. We utilize the application clash.tools for base calling and tracking war stats. To even be considered to war with us, you must create an account and request to join our clan within 2 wars of joining. Your first War Attack must be reserved on clash.tools and you must manually enter the outcome (stars) of both your attacks on war day, before war day ends. Failure to do so results in suspensions and eventual kicking. Outside of in-game chat, we use the app LINE to communicate. It is not required to join the clan, but it is strongly encouraged to get it. You can request, and give, advice and feedback at all times of the day, utilizing links, base screenshots, etc. Members of both clans are active on LINE so you will have many more opinions and help available to you if utilized. Be mature and polite. Be open to feedback and demonstrate a willingness both to learn and help others. Donate only what is requested, Barch is default if unclear.   We have strong leadership and the willingness and ability to help you learn and prosper. If we are a good fit for you and you are a good fit for us, let's start Mining Salt together.

Level 5 Clan.   We're a mix of half TH 8 and TH 9 so you can probably fit in easily for Wars. War is declared Monday Wednesday Friday at 8 PM. Attack twice. Try to donate if you are capable of making the requested troops. Most of us are always on scouting and discussing attacks.  We do take the one day off a week to farm or level heroes. Sit out as needed  We are a MANDATORY 3 star clan. If you GoWiPe or GoWiWi you must have a plan for the backside.   Worst case is you have great troops and are willing to learn or ask questions. We are always here to help.   SAY IN APP YOU ARE FROM REDDIT so we can approve during war.

We only war farm which is great for casual players that don't have the time to commit to real wars.   Every war we ask the enemy to put their top 2 TH's out for us to snipe for easy loot. If they do, it's easy loot. If they don't, we barch snipe and it's still easy loot. Attacking is completely optional and there are no expensive war armies to train or pressure to perform. Since we won't be pressuring you to train fancy armies to get your war attacks in, you can focus on regular farming to upgrade your base. We accept only TH8+ players, and have many active high level players.  More information about our clan group is at /r/WarFarmersXX"

We are an adult clan seeking members that are 18 or older. We have done very well in wars in the past but do to a few inactive members and members not following more experienced clan members advice on attack strategy we are coming out of a pretty rough losing streak. We've cleaned house and gotten rid of all of the bad apples and are looking to build back up. We'd be very interested in having you join our clan and help us bring our clan, (and hopefully your new clan), back into its former glory.   The clan currently stands at 27 members, and we will be recruiting regularly, in hopes of swelling our ranks and waging larger wars. Most of our members are from the US and the UK, and there is usually someone on all the time to fill donations and b.s. with. Like I said above we are an adult clan and we like to joke around alot, but we also take our clash seriously. We are ranged from a few th7s to near max defense th10s (mostly th8 & th9) and we are looking for th7s and above that aren't too terribly rushed, although exceptions can be made if you are a lower th that looks to be progressing quickly or mildly rushed and have recently come to your senses.😉   Come by and check us out.

READ THE WHOLE POST. If you don't, we will know, and you WILL be rejected.  The Salt Miners family is hovering at around 60 total members. Salt Miners is our Level 5, main warring clan. We are a serious war clan with serious, but still personable and friendly, members. We war three times a week, currently starting our search M/W/F. (Minors has alternate days, starting search Tu/Th/Sat). We distribute a lot of information on our Subreddit, you can find it at: Salt Miners.  Salt Miners – 65-7  To Be Accepted Into Our Family (the easy part):   For full rules, see the Introduction Post This is required reading and it becomes extremely evident when people do not read these! Please read them Your base and troop levels cannot be rushed relative to your TH level. You must go through our feeder and apply using the password ""MINERS"" in your in-game request. A good request would look like this: Saw you on Reddit, I'm a near maxed TH8 that loves to war. Password is ""MINERS"" People are typically promoted within 1-5 wars if they are competent using appropriate 3 star strategies, and meet all Salt Miners requirements You can skip the process of warring in the Minors if you share at least two replays of 3 star attacks. You need to be using an approved strategy against an opponent similar to what you'll see in war.   To Stay and Win Wars With Us   Use approved strategies. We do not use 2 star strategies! GoWiPe is not approved unless specifically approved by a co-leader. We utilize the application clash.tools for base calling and tracking war stats. To even be considered to war with us, you must create an account and request to join our clan within 2 wars of joining. Your first War Attack must be reserved on clash.tools and you must manually enter the outcome (stars) of both your attacks on war day, before war day ends. Failure to do so results in suspensions and eventual kicking. Outside of in-game chat, we use the app LINE to communicate. It is not required to join the clan, but it is strongly encouraged to get it. You can request, and give, advice and feedback at all times of the day, utilizing links, base screenshots, etc. Members of both clans are active on LINE so you will have many more opinions and help available to you if utilized. Be mature and polite. Be open to feedback and demonstrate a willingness both to learn and help others. Donate only what is requested, Barch is default if unclear.   We have strong leadership and the willingness and ability to help you learn and prosper. If we are a good fit for you and you are a good fit for us, let's start Mining Salt together.

ClashOfClansRecruit,3dl3ii,PlasticWalrus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:33:52 2015 UTC,"Hi TG1,  My clan is what you are looking for. Why should you join us? The reasons are quick and simple:   We are a level 6 clan We have over 190+ War Wins We run a monthly contest, with the winner getting a gift card for gems We are established, organized, and mature We are good donators who give maxed troops We have great players who can help you develop and upgrade your game We don't give a crap about donation ratios (we just want you actively raiding and upgrading)   So if you are interested in a great war clan and you think you have the skills to hang with us, check out our clan, Golden Goblins (with the Green and Yellow flag and our clan tag is #JUUJQUU) because you will see that we are strong in war, donations, and activity. Most importantly, we have quite a few higher level players who can help you grow your account. Thus, we are able to donate high level troops to help you with your raids and war attacks. Our leaders are all mature and have been together since we started the clan. We are organized and have players all over the world.  We are good at war and have 198 war wins. We just came off of a 41 war winning streak and have not lost in 84 days. We always use all of our attacks so you will not have any teammates that are being lazy or not pulling their own weight.   Our donations are high. We have a number of members who exceed 2,000 donations per season. So you know when you make a request for troops, it will be filled quickly.   We are active and love to clown around on chat. To chat and discuss war tactics, we use Line. A number of us are people we have been clashing with for some time so we are a close bunch.   We also have a YouTube channel for you to check out our war attacks: www.youtube.com/goldengoblins  We want to grow our clan but we want to grow with the right people as opposed to just any player that wants to join.  IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN JOINING OR GETTING MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE SEND ME A PM ON THIS FORUM. WE DO NOT ACCEPT IN-GAME APPLICATIONS."

Welcome to the Salt Miners Family!  READ THE WHOLE POST. If you don't, we will know, and you WILL be rejected.  The Salt Miners family is hovering at around 60 total members. Salt Miners is our Level 5, main warring clan. We are a serious war clan with serious, but still personable and friendly, members. We war three times a week, currently starting our search M/W/F. (Minors has alternate days, starting search Tu/Th/Sat). We distribute a lot of information on our Subreddit, you can find it at: Salt Miners.  Salt Miners – 65-7  To Be Accepted Into Our Family (the easy part):   For full rules, see the Introduction Post This is required reading and it becomes extremely evident when people do not read these! Please read them Your base and troop levels cannot be rushed relative to your TH level. You must go through our feeder and apply using the password ""MINERS"" in your in-game request. A good request would look like this: Saw you on Reddit, I'm a near maxed TH8 that loves to war. Password is ""MINERS"" People are typically promoted within 1-5 wars if they are competent using appropriate 3 star strategies, and meet all Salt Miners requirements You can skip the process of warring in the Minors if you share at least two replays of 3 star attacks. You need to be using an approved strategy against an opponent similar to what you'll see in war.   To Stay and Win Wars With Us   Use approved strategies. We do not use 2 star strategies! GoWiPe is not approved unless specifically approved by a co-leader. We utilize the application clash.tools for base calling and tracking war stats. To even be considered to war with us, you must create an account and request to join our clan within 2 wars of joining. Your first War Attack must be reserved on clash.tools and you must manually enter the outcome (stars) of both your attacks on war day, before war day ends. Failure to do so results in suspensions and eventual kicking. Outside of in-game chat, we use the app LINE to communicate. It is not required to join the clan, but it is strongly encouraged to get it. You can request, and give, advice and feedback at all times of the day, utilizing links, base screenshots, etc. Members of both clans are active on LINE so you will have many more opinions and help available to you if utilized. Be mature and polite. Be open to feedback and demonstrate a willingness both to learn and help others. Donate only what is requested, Barch is default if unclear.   We have strong leadership and the willingness and ability to help you learn and prosper. If we are a good fit for you and you are a good fit for us, let's start Mining Salt together.

We only war farm which is great for casual players that don't have the time to commit to real wars.   Every war we ask the enemy to put their top 2 TH's out for us to snipe for easy loot. If they do, it's easy loot. If they don't, we barch snipe and it's still easy loot. Attacking is completely optional and there are no expensive war armies to train or pressure to perform. Since we won't be pressuring you to train fancy armies to get your war attacks in, you can focus on regular farming to upgrade your base. We accept only TH8+ players, and have many active high level players.  More information about our clan group is at /r/WarFarmersXX"

ClashOfClansRecruit,3djj16,j1102g,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:45:06 2015 UTC,"Hi Itisjurr,   We're an active adult clan. Mix of Americans and Brits, male and female. Currently around 5 TH10s, 15 TH9s and the rest TH8. All with plenty experience and passionate about this game. Must enjoy banter, i.e. be able to give as good as you get.  Reached Lev 5 Clan Perks a few weeks back.   We war non-stop, but are easy with peeps opting in and out to fit with life / upgrades etc.  As per every other serious war clan, using both raids in war is a given. Aim for 3 on first raid, then 2nd raid for cleanup, or if a rout, then loot.  Prefer  you donate before requesting. For regular raiding, try keep your requests as broad as possible, and only for what troops you can provide yourself. During war, be explicit. Request whatever you need to give your army the best chance of success. Not anal about donation ratios, but we don’t entertain leeches.  If you're interested, send your invite and mention reddit.  Night Club 18+   |  Yellow and black shield    |    clan tag #200GL9RP    Good luck! Goonerfan14"

Although we do war, it's farm warring for free & easy loot only.   Every war we ask the enemy to put their top 2 TH's out for us to snipe for easy loot. If they do, it's easy loot. If they don't, we barch snipe and it's still easy loot. Attacking is completely optional and there are no expensive war armies to train or pressure to perform. Since we won't be pressuring you to train fancy armies to get your war attacks in, you can focus on hard-farming to grind on walls, upgrade buildings, etc  More information about our clan group is at /r/WarFarmersXX"

ClashOfClansRecruit,3dfqvu,Luke_0610,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:35:40 2015 UTC,"Hey there! Here are some quick thoughts. These days we're warring 2x a week, hoping to get back up to 3 with the addition of some more solid members. We've been doing 2s because we have a lot of high level th9s with lengthy hero upgrades, so this should allow us to be more in sync with upgrading them and have a few larger wars rather than multiple smaller ones. We expect members to shoot for the three, and we all help each other get it. We win probably 95% of our wars, and we are just wrapping up win number 106. We'd love to have you, let me know and we'll talk more.  Here's some more info on us:  We started as a group of 8 friends who wanted to find other committed players to help win clan wars. We have grown and seen great success. Currently, we are composed of maxed th8s and 19 strong to maxed th9s and we’re a lvl 5 clan. We have a few lower level friends or second accounts, but they do not go to war. Our highest level is 122. As a clan, we are committed to not rushing our town halls. We are hovering around 40 people right now and are focused on slowly adding to a high-quality group.  Our clan is filled with all mature players and mostly adults. We like to talk strategy over clan chat and are willing to help with advice whenever it is needed.  Many members farm, and we do not have an organized trophy push. We are focused on efficiently upgrading our bases and winning clan wars.  We are very active, and several of our players regularly donate over 2k a season of level 5+ troops. Wizards and archers are the most common donation, but special request troops can be made for major resource defense or big loot pushes. Our other players also contribute significantly, and requests are often filled within minutes.  We have scheduled clan wars 2-3 times a week at the moment with prep days starting on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. It’s not uncommon for clan mates to opt out of wars for high level hero upgrades too. Our clan has 106 wins and counting and we believe that is due to both our high activity level and our skill in picking and executing attacks. Inactive players during war are kicked from the clan, but if you can just get your attacks in for wars you’ve opted in to, we will be happy.  If you are interested, check us out! Search #supremacy in game and look for whatsupdoc? as the leader. We have the purple shield with the white wavy Y on it. Tag is CCYCPQ9. Please message me with any questions, and I would be happy to answer them. We keep our clan closed to keep our chat free of a mountain of requests, but if you message me, we can set up a time to open the clan up and get you in. Looking forward to hearing from you"

ClashOfClansRecruit,3dexmk,DarthMee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:08:08 2015 UTC,"You might like the war farming method we practice in War Farmers 06  Every war we ask the enemy to put their top 2 TH's out for us to snipe for easy loot. If they do, it's easy loot. If they don't, we barch snipe and it's still easy loot. Attacking is completely optional and there are no expensive war armies to train or pressure to perform. Since we won't be pressuring you to train fancy armies to get your war attacks in, you can focus on hard-farming to grind on walls, upgrade buildings, etc. We love rushed bases since it helps us match stronger clans with more loot to war farm.

These days we're warring 2x a week, hoping to get back up to 3 with the addition of some more solid members. We've been doing 2s because we have a lot of high level th9s with lengthy hero upgrades, so this should allow us to be more in sync with upgrading them and have a few larger wars rather than multiple smaller ones. We expect members to shoot for the three, and we all help each other get it. We win probably 95% of our wars, and we are just wrapping up win number 106. We'd love to have you, let me know and we'll talk more.  Here's some more info on us:  We started as a group of 8 friends who wanted to find other committed players to help win clan wars. We have grown and seen great success. Currently, we are composed of maxed th8s and 19 strong to maxed th9s and we’re a lvl 5 clan. We have a few lower level friends or second accounts, but they do not go to war. Our highest level is 122. As a clan, we are committed to not rushing our town halls. We are hovering around 40 people right now and are focused on slowly adding to a high-quality group.  Our clan is filled with all mature players and mostly adults. We like to talk strategy over clan chat and are willing to help with advice whenever it is needed.  Many members farm, and we do not have an organized trophy push. We are focused on efficiently upgrading our bases and winning clan wars.  We are very active, and several of our players regularly donate over 2k a season of level 5+ troops. Wizards and archers are the most common donation, but special request troops can be made for major resource defense or big loot pushes. Our other players also contribute significantly, and requests are often filled within minutes.  We have scheduled clan wars 2-3 times a week at the moment with prep days starting on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. It’s not uncommon for clan mates to opt out of wars for high level hero upgrades too. Our clan has 106 wins and counting and we believe that is due to both our high activity level and our skill in picking and executing attacks. Inactive players during war are kicked from the clan, but if you can just get your attacks in for wars you’ve opted in to, we will be happy.  If you are interested, check us out! Search #supremacy in game and look for whatsupdoc? as the leader. We have the purple shield with the white wavy Y on it. Tag is CCYCPQ9.

Level 5 Clan.   We're a mix of half TH 8 and TH 9 so you can probably fit in easily for Wars. War is declared Monday Wednesday Friday at 8 PM. Attack twice.

Sit out as needed  We are a MANDATORY 3 star clan. If you GoWiPe or GoWiWi you must have a plan for the backside.   Worst case is you have great troops and are willing to learn or ask questions. We are always here to help.   SAY YOU ARE FROM REDDIT IN APP so I can approve during war.

The more experienced members are highly engaged in the clan and try to help less experienced members reach their full potential. As such, we frequently watch replays and make suggestions on how to improve strategies and tactics. Thus, constructive criticism is part of being in the clan and members must be able to listen and apply advice given (though you'll probably be on the advice giving front more often than not).

We war three times a week, currently starting our search M/W/F.  (Minors has alternate days, starting search Tu/Th/Sat). We distribute a lot of information on our Subreddit, you can find it at: Salt Miners.  Salt Miners - 65-7    To Be Accepted Into Our Family (the easy part):   For full rules, see the Introduction Post This is required reading and it becomes extremely evident when people do not read these! Please read them Your base and troop levels can not be rushed relative to your TH level. You must go through our feeder and apply using the password ""MINERS"" in your in-game request. A good request would look like this: Saw you on Reddit, I'm a near maxed TH8 that loves to war. Password is ""MINERS"" People are typically promoted within 1-5 wars if they are competent using appropriate 3 star strategies, and meet all Salt Miners requirements You can skip the process of warring in the Minors if you share at least two replays of 3 star attacks. You need to be using an approved strategy against an opponent similar to what you'll see in war.   To Stay and Win Wars With Us   Use approved strategies. We do not use 2 star strategies! GoWiPe is not approved unless specifically approved by a co-leader. We utilize the application clash.tools for base calling and tracking war stats.  To even be considered to war with us, you must create an account and request to join our clan within 2 wars of joining. Your first War Attack must be reserved on clash.tools and you must manually enter the outcome (stars) of both your attacks on war day, before war day ends.  Failure to do so results in suspensions and eventual kicking. Outside of in-game chat, we use the app LINE to communicate. It is not required to join the clan, but it is strongly encouraged to get it. You can request, and give, advice and feedback at all times of the day, utilizing links, base screenshots, etc.  Members of both clans are active on LINE so you will have many more opinions and help available to you if utilized. Be mature and polite.  Be open to feedback and demonstrate a willingness both to learn and help others.  Donate only what is requested, Barch is default if unclear.     We have strong leadership and the willingness and ability to help you learn and prosper.  If we are a good fit for you and you are a good fit for us, let's start Mining Salt together.

ClashOfClansRecruit,3dchtc,quicksilver101,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:26:05 2015 UTC,"Hey there! Here are some quick thoughts. These days we're warring 2x a week, hoping to get back up to 3 with the addition of some more solid members. We've been doing 2s because we have a lot of high level th9s with lengthy hero upgrades, so this should allow us to be more in sync with upgrading them and have a few larger wars rather than multiple smaller ones. We expect members to shoot for the three, and we all help each other get it. We win probably 95% of our wars, and we are just wrapping up win number 106. We'd love to have you, let me know and we'll talk more.  Here's some more info on us:  We started as a group of 8 friends who wanted to find other committed players to help win clan wars. We have grown and seen great success. Currently, we are composed of maxed th8s and 19 strong to maxed th9s and we’re a lvl 5 clan. We have a few lower level friends or second accounts, but they do not go to war. Our highest level is 122. As a clan, we are committed to not rushing our town halls. We are hovering around 40 people right now and are focused on slowly adding to a high-quality group.  Our clan is filled with all mature players and mostly adults. We like to talk strategy over clan chat and are willing to help with advice whenever it is needed.  Many members farm, and we do not have an organized trophy push. We are focused on efficiently upgrading our bases and winning clan wars.  We are very active, and several of our players regularly donate over 2k a season of level 5+ troops. Wizards and archers are the most common donation, but special request troops can be made for major resource defense or big loot pushes. Our other players also contribute significantly, and requests are often filled within minutes.  We have scheduled clan wars 2-3 times a week at the moment with prep days starting on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. It’s not uncommon for clan mates to opt out of wars for high level hero upgrades too. Our clan has 106 wins and counting and we believe that is due to both our high activity level and our skill in picking and executing attacks. Inactive players during war are kicked from the clan, but if you can just get your attacks in for wars you’ve opted in to, we will be happy.  If you are interested, check us out! Search #supremacy in game and look for whatsupdoc? as the leader. We have the purple shield with the white wavy Y on it. Tag is CCYCPQ9.

We war three times a week, currently starting our search M/W/F.  (Minors has alternate days, starting search Tu/Th/Sat). We distribute a lot of information on our Subreddit, you can find it at: Salt Miners.  Salt Miners - 65-7    To Be Accepted Into Our Family (the easy part):   For full rules, see the Introduction Post This is required reading and it becomes extremely evident when people do not read these! Please read them Your base and troop levels can not be rushed relative to your TH level. You must go through our feeder and apply using the password ""MINERS"" in your in-game request. A good request would look like this: Saw you on Reddit, I'm a near maxed TH8 that loves to war. Password is ""MINERS"" People are typically promoted within 1-5 wars if they are competent using appropriate 3 star strategies, and meet all Salt Miners requirements You can skip the process of warring in the Minors if you share at least two replays of 3 star attacks. You need to be using an approved strategy against an opponent similar to what you'll see in war.   To Stay and Win Wars With Us   Use approved strategies. We do not use 2 star strategies! GoWiPe is not approved unless specifically approved by a co-leader. We utilize the application clash.tools for base calling and tracking war stats.  To even be considered to war with us, you must create an account and request to join our clan within 2 wars of joining. Your first War Attack must be reserved on clash.tools and you must manually enter the outcome (stars) of both your attacks on war day, before war day ends.  Failure to do so results in suspensions and eventual kicking. Outside of in-game chat, we use the app LINE to communicate. It is not required to join the clan, but it is strongly encouraged to get it. You can request, and give, advice and feedback at all times of the day, utilizing links, base screenshots, etc.  Members of both clans are active on LINE so you will have many more opinions and help available to you if utilized. Be mature and polite.  Be open to feedback and demonstrate a willingness both to learn and help others.  Donate only what is requested, Barch is default if unclear.     We have strong leadership and the willingness and ability to help you learn and prosper.  If we are a good fit for you and you are a good fit for us, let's start Mining Salt together.

We use the app ""line"" to communicate outside of the clan; make sure to download that and add us, my user ID is soxses on the app.  Aside from that I previously was in a top 20 world WoW clan [yea.. nerd I know]. We are a respectful clan with lots to offer.   We are always actively recruiting and would love to have you join. We hope to hear from you.   We war 2 times a week and are a level 4 clan. We have 1 perfect war record and because we only war 2 times a week, we require everyone to be ready on those 2 war days.  If for some reason you are not able to war (we understand, life happens) be sure to opt out.  If you are in the war, make sure to attack based on our war strategy.   Here is some information, feel free to message me on here for more information.   * We are a full time war clan looking for people who want to get better at wars.  We are always striving to be the best that we can be. We always help each other with critiques; if you are hard headed and cant take criticism because you are the best at this game... Then no reason to join here, you should be in a TOP war clan. ;)   * We take wars very seriously and so should you.   * Requirements are th7 and lvl 2 drags (exceptions are acceptable under special circumstances).   * If you are looking for a clan that wars 2 times a week with active off days, then come join us. Make sure to put that you heard about us from reddit when you ask to join the clan.  #9U2CY0RVclantag."

The Salt Miners family is hovering at around 60 total members. Salt Miners is our Level 5, main warring clan. We are a serious war clan with serious, but still personable and friendly, members. We war three times a week, currently starting our search M/W/F.  (Minors has alternate days, starting search Tu/Th/Sat). We distribute a lot of information on our Subreddit, you can find it at: Salt Miners.  Salt Miners - 65-7    To Be Accepted Into Our Family (the easy part):   For full rules, see the Introduction Post This is required reading and it becomes extremely evident when people do not read these! Please read them Your base and troop levels can not be rushed relative to your TH level. You must go through our feeder and apply using the password ""MINERS"" in your in-game request. A good request would look like this: Saw you on Reddit, I'm a near maxed TH8 that loves to war. Password is ""MINERS"" People are typically promoted within 1-5 wars if they are competent using appropriate 3 star strategies, and meet all Salt Miners requirements You can skip the process of warring in the Minors if you share at least two replays of 3 star attacks. You need to be using an approved strategy against an opponent similar to what you'll see in war.   To Stay and Win Wars With Us   Use approved strategies. We do not use 2 star strategies! GoWiPe is not approved unless specifically approved by a co-leader. We utilize the application clash.tools for base calling and tracking war stats.  To even be considered to war with us, you must create an account and request to join our clan within 2 wars of joining. Your first War Attack must be reserved on clash.tools and you must manually enter the outcome (stars) of both your attacks on war day, before war day ends.  Failure to do so results in suspensions and eventual kicking. Outside of in-game chat, we use the app LINE to communicate. It is not required to join the clan, but it is strongly encouraged to get it. You can request, and give, advice and feedback at all times of the day, utilizing links, base screenshots, etc.  Members of both clans are active on LINE so you will have many more opinions and help available to you if utilized. Be mature and polite.  Be open to feedback and demonstrate a willingness both to learn and help others.  Donate only what is requested, Barch is default if unclear.     We have strong leadership and the willingness and ability to help you learn and prosper.  If we are a good fit for you and you are a good fit for us, let's start Mining Salt together.

If they do, it's easy loot. If they don't, we barch snipe and it's still easy loot. Attacking is completely optional and there are no expensive war armies to train or pressure to perform. Since we won't be pressuring you to train fancy armies to get your war attacks in, you can focus on hard-farming to grind on walls, upgrade buildings, etc  More information about our clan group is at /r/WarFarmersXX"

This will give you a near max th9 matchup in war. Also your hogs should be lvl4 as that is max th8 lvl. U will need your hogs at lvl5 for th9. If u cancel your xbows and are upgrading your hogs hit me back and I will accept u.

Your first War Attack must be reserved on clash.tools and you must manually enter the outcome (stars) of both your attacks on war day, before war day ends.  Failure to do so results in suspensions and eventual kicking. Outside of in-game chat, we use the app LINE to communicate. It is not required to join the clan, but it is strongly encouraged to get it. You can request, and give, advice and feedback at all times of the day, utilizing links, base screenshots, etc.  Members of both clans are active on LINE so you will have many more opinions and help available to you if utilized.

We war twice a week (Sunday and Thursday nights, EST) and take it fairly seriously. We've been around for several years, so definitely there in terms of stability, and some of our oldest members know each other IRL as well.  As far as what we're all about: we're adults and are pretty laid back, but we like winning wars too and act accordingly.  We realize that we all have lives and responsibilities outside of the game, so we don't have any stringent requirements of members. All we really ask from our members is:   Treat one another with respect. Leave drama, prejudice, politics and other issues at the door. We don't want to see excessive swearing either. Opting out is a very useful feature in this game; use it. If you can't make it to war, or are unsure about your availability, opt out! There is nothing worse than losing a war due to poor attendance. Consistent lack of war attendance will earn you the boot. Don't ask, beg, reason, or argue for elder or co-leader status. Promotions come with time and active participation in the clan. Leaders will decide who is ready for a promotion. Asking for it will only prolong your wait. Be OK with constructive criticism. Every war more experienced members will look at replays and let you know how /if you can improve your attacks. This is not personal; we only want to improve our war performance as a clan. If we see you making mistakes (not luring out CC troops, using inappropriate troops, etc.) we will let you know and we expect you to listen.   Let me know if you have any questions or interest.

We have a few TH10s, 10-15 (I lose track sometimes) TH9s, and the majority of our clan is TH8.        Welcome to the Salt Miners Family!  READ THE WHOLE POST. If you don't, we will know, and you WILL be rejected.  The Salt Miners family is hovering at around 60 total members. Salt Miners is our Level 5, main warring clan. We are a serious war clan with serious, but still personable and friendly, members. We war three times a week, currently starting our search M/W/F.  (Minors has alternate days, starting search Tu/Th/Sat). We distribute a lot of information on our Subreddit, you can find it at: Salt Miners.  Salt Miners - 63-7    To Be Accepted Into Our Family (the easy part):   For full rules, see the Introduction Post This is required reading and it becomes extremely evident when people do not read these! Please read them Your base and troop levels can not be rushed relative to your TH level. You must go through our feeder and apply using the password ""MINERS"" in your in-game request. A good request would look like this: Saw you on Reddit, I'm a near maxed TH8 that loves to war. Password is ""MINERS"" People are typically promoted within 1-5 wars if they are competent using appropriate 3 star strategies, and meet all Salt Miners requirements You can skip the process of warring in the Minors if you share at least two replays of 3 star attacks. You need to be using an approved strategy against an opponent similar to what you'll see in war.   To Stay and Win Wars With Us   Use approved strategies. We do not use 2 star strategies! GoWiPe is not approved unless specifically approved by a co-leader. We utilize the application clash.tools for base calling and tracking war stats.  To even be considered to war with us, you must create an account and request to join our clan within 2 wars of joining. Your first War Attack must be reserved on clash.tools and you must manually enter the outcome (stars) of both your attacks on war day, before war day ends.  Failure to do so results in suspensions and eventual kicking. Outside of in-game chat, we use the app LINE to communicate. It is not required to join the clan, but it is strongly encouraged to get it. You can request, and give, advice and feedback at all times of the day, utilizing links, base screenshots, etc.  Members of both clans are active on LINE so you will have many more opinions and help available to you if utilized. Be mature and polite.  Be open to feedback and demonstrate a willingness both to learn and help others.  Donate only what is requested, Barch is default if unclear.     We have strong leadership and the willingness and ability to help you learn and prosper.  If we are a good fit for you and you are a good fit for us, let's start Mining Salt together.

ClashOfClansRecruit,3cnarz,clashofgrant,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:05:03 2015 UTC,"Hey! Village Villain here (#8G2LV9Q)  We're a level 4 clan (2037/3100) that wars twice a week (Sunday and Thursday nights, EST).  What are we all about? We're a fairly casual clan but we're serious about war. What does that mean? We're adults who understand that people have lives and commitments outside of the game. As such, we don't have donation ratio requirements, compulsory warring, or any other rigid rules. On the other hand, we take war pretty seriously; we discuss tactics and strategies, help lower level members reach their full potential, and donate only the best troops.  What we expect from you:   Treat others with respect. We're all adults, we expect members to act like it. If you're unavailable for war, no problem! But please remember to opt out before war search. There's nothing more frustrating than losing a war due to bad attendance. Be OK with constructive criticism. As mentioned, we like to make sure that everyone's improving at the game, especially at war time. More experienced members will watch your replays and look at your base, and offer suggestions on how you can improve next time. You should not take this personally, and be able to take advice in a positive manner.   If you're interested send me a message, or join in game. Thanks for reading!"

We value loyalty and generosity. We expect growth, activity, and full participation in war. We discuss strategy and support each other, through good times and bad. To grow and strengthen the clan, we expect the following from all members of the clan.   (the formatting is a bit weird so can also be viewed here)  General Rules Be eager to progress and learn. Ask for advice on attack strategy, troop composition in war, and troop/defensive upgrades. Be a member of the SOG forum Read clan mail Be polite and active in chat. Communicate in English so everyone can understand Keep your language clean and swearing to a minimum We do not have a specific age requirement for the clan but we will ask you to try act mature so that all players can enjoy their time.

Leaders will monitor activity based on the following criteria Requests: Request a minimum of 500 troops per season but please REQUEST OFTEN Donations: Donate a minimum of 500 troops per season. Do not have more than 1000 troop difference between donate and received. If you are TH7 below, there is no donation requirement but please request and raid as often as you can. But do not have 0 donations.  Use of builders Attacks won: raid as often as possible If you were kicked for being inactive, or low troop donations, you may rejoin but do try not to do it again. If you're going to be inactive (or feel like you're going to stop playing, such as for an upcoming series of exams in school or something) feel free to drop out of the clan yourself. You may, of course, rejoin again later  Grow your offense troops Do not neglect heros Do not neglect dark troops Established TH9s (more than 2 months at TH9) should have at minimum, lv3 golems and lv3 pekka  Participate in clan wars if you are eligible (see below) Practice war attacks during non-war periods Learn the standards, GoWiPe, Mass Dragon, Hogs, GoWiWi, lavaloonian, etc.  In TH9/10, it is critical to learn hybrid attacks. Ask for advice, watch videos, and practice, practice, practice! Clan hopping may result in suspension. We do not encourage hopping. No asking for promotion to elder and leader.  Elder is earned by activity, donations, and loyalty to the clan  Clan Wars Rules We are a clan who are very strict and competitive with Clan Wars. If you are a player who feels as if they are not up for the challenge of competitive Clan Wars, then this clan is not for you. People who do not use BOTH attacks during Clan Wars will be booted. We will you give you a second, and possibly third chance. But more than 3 misses will result in a boot. Follow the war strategy which is sent prior to each war. Subject to change EVERY war Be sure to contribute to war cc donations. This responsibility needs to be shared (see below for minimum troop level donations)  When to opt out (always tell a leader why) If your heros are upgrading If you are going to miss a war due to exams, travel, real life War at least once a week. If you opt out of more than 3 wars in a row, without a valid reason, you will be booted.  If you miss a war attack, a leader will inquire as to why. We are a non-cheating clan. If we find out that you are using Airplane Mode, Mods, or any sort of cheating, you will be booted.

Salt Miners is our Level 5, main warring clan. We are a serious war clan with serious, but still personable and friendly, members. We war three times a week, currently starting our search M/W/F.  (Minors has alternate days, starting search Tu/Th/Sat). We distribute a lot of information on our Subreddit, you can find it at: Salt Miners.  Salt Miners - 62-7    To Be Accepted Into Our Family (the easy part):   For full rules, see the Introduction Post This is required reading and it becomes extremely evident when people do not read these! Please read them Your base and troop levels can not be rushed relative to your TH level. You must go through our feeder and apply using the password ""MINERS"" in your in-game request. A good request would look like this: Saw you on Reddit, I'm a near maxed TH8 that loves to war. Password is ""MINERS"" People are typically promoted within 1-5 wars if they are competent using appropriate 3 star strategies, and meet all Salt Miners requirements You can skip the process of warring in the Minors if you share at least two replays of 3 star attacks. You need to be using an approved strategy against an opponent similar to what you'll see in war.   To Stay and Win Wars With Us   Use approved strategies. We do not use 2 star strategies! GoWiPe is not approved unless specifically approved by a co-leader. We utilize the application clash.tools for base calling and tracking war stats.  To even be considered to war with us, you must create an account and request to join our clan within 2 wars of joining. Your first War Attack must be reserved on clash.tools and you must manually enter the outcome (stars) of both your attacks on war day, before war day ends.  Failure to do so results in suspensions and eventual kicking. Outside of in-game chat, we use the app LINE to communicate. It is not required to join the clan, but it is strongly encouraged to get it. You can request, and give, advice and feedback at all times of the day, utilizing links, base screenshots, etc.  Members of both clans are active on LINE so you will have many more opinions and help available to you if utilized. Be mature and polite.  Be open to feedback and demonstrate a willingness both to learn and help others.  Donate only what is requested, Barch is default if unclear.     We have strong leadership and the willingness and ability to help you learn and prosper.  If we are a good fit for you and you are a good fit for us, let's start Mining Salt together.

ClashOfClansRecruit,3cdi9t,wuxbustah8,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:03:37 2015 UTC,"Hey there,  Here are some quick thoughts. Currently we're warring 3 times a week but shortly we'll be cutting down to two a week. we have a lot of high level th9s with lengthy hero upgrades, so this should allow us to be more in sync with upgrading them and have a few larger wars rather than multiple smaller ones. We expect members to shoot for the three, and we all help each other get it. We win probably 95% of our wars, and we are just wrapping up win number 100. We'd love to have you, let me know and we'll talk more.  Here's some more info on us:  We started as a group of 8 friends who wanted to find other committed players to help win clan wars. We have grown and seen great success. Currently, we are composed of maxed th8s and 19 strong to maxed th9s and we’re a lvl 5 clan. We have a few lower level friends or second accounts, but they do not go to war. Our highest level is 122. As a clan, we are committed to not rushing our town halls. We are hovering around 40 people right now and are focused on slowly adding to a high-quality group.  Our clan is filled with all mature players and mostly adults. We like to talk strategy over clan chat and are willing to help with advice whenever it is needed.  Many members farm, and we do not have an organized trophy push. We are focused on efficiently upgrading our bases and winning clan wars.  We are very active, and several of our players regularly donate over 2k a season of level 5+ troops. Wizards and archers are the most common donation, but special request troops can be made for major resource defense or big loot pushes. Our other players also contribute significantly, and requests are often filled within minutes.  We have scheduled clan wars 2-3 times a week at the moment with prep days starting on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. It’s not uncommon for clan mates to opt out of wars for high level hero upgrades too. Our clan has 99 wins and counting and we believe that is due to both our high activity level and our skill in picking and executing attacks. Inactive players during war are kicked from the clan, but if you can just get your attacks in for wars you’ve opted in to, we will be happy.  If you are interested, check us out! Search #supremacy in game and look for whatsupdoc? as the leader. We have the purple shield with the white wavy Y on it. Tag is CCYCPQ9. Please message me with any questions, and I would be happy to answer them. We keep our clan closed to keep our chat free of a mountain of requests, but if you message me, we can set up a time to open the clan up and get you in. Looking forward to hearing from you"

Your first War Attack must be reserved on clash.tools and you must manually enter the outcome (stars) of both your attacks on war day, before war day ends.  Failure to do so results in suspensions and eventual kicking. Outside of in-game chat, we use the app LINE to communicate. It is not required to join the clan, but it is strongly encouraged to get it. You can request, and give, advice and feedback at all times of the day, utilizing links, base screenshots, etc.  Members of both clans are active on LINE so you will have many more opinions and help available to you if utilized. Be mature and polite.  Be open to feedback and demonstrate a willingness both to learn and help others.  Donate only what is requested, Barch is default if unclear.     We have strong leadership and the willingness and ability to help you learn and prosper.  If we are a good fit for you and you are a good fit for us, let's start Mining Salt together.

I am very ad-vocative to promote different styles of attacks, goho, govalo, govaho, holos in our wars rather than the usual dragon attacks especially to those very capable th8s.  Our clan leader is very fair, respectable, approachable and strict at the same time.  He makes a great leader and shows great leadership.

What we expect from you:   Maturity. Treat others with respect, keep swearing to a minimum, and don't bring drama into the game. Ability to take constructive criticism. Like I mentioned, we like to help one another improve at the game. As such, more experienced and senior members will often watch war replays and suggest better strategies and troop compositions. This isn't personal and we expect all members to handle this well. Attacking in war if you're opted in. No exceptions, if you're busy, opt out!   If you're interested, reach out to me here.

ClashOfClansRecruit,3bp5f6,austenau,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:05:46 2015 UTC,"Idk if we are exactly what you're looking for but I'll throw our clan name in the hat.  Our clan name is TheBooksOfWar and our Clan ID is C9PY9UR.  Our clan is level 4, and by my math we should be 3 wars away from level 5.  I know you are looking for a level 5 clan, idk if that's close enough to satisfy you.  At the moment we have 24 members, mostly TH8's, a handful of 7's, and 4 TH9's.  Myself and the co-leaders happen to be the TH9's, that wasn't intend or anything, just worked out like that.  So one of our TH9's is a level 106, we have a level 98, a 93, and myself a 91.  Me and the 93 are still fairly new to TH9, I've been at it I think 11 days.  But, if you want strategy we are the place for it.  We may not have a big experienced TH10's to teach you, but we work very well together and we have no problem 2 starting TH9 and are currently working on figuring out 3 stars.  In the past we have never had more than 1 or 2 TH9's at a time so we have never needed more than 2 stars up there and that's why we are working to figure out 3 stars, now that we are getting more TH9s and have TH8 members who are getting close.  And we will figure it out, and we're getting close, but yeah.  I know you are looking for some people to learn from, but if you would be interested in working with people to make progress then you won't find a better group to work with.  We've been working with everything from GoWiPe to GoHoWi to LavaLoonion, GoLavaLoonion, some other weird attack out 106 found but he's 3-started with it in practice raids on legit bases.  Also, we're very good at defense strategy, I know it's something I for one pride myself on.  We are pretty laid back and easy going, but when it comes to war we take it seriously.  We war on a 3 day cycle, so it's a day for prep, and day for war, and a day to rest and farm elixir back.  We have war that must be followed, they are mostly intend to teach our members to be smart so that they grow as players and don't have to be coached on every war attack forever.  The rules are don't attack below you without asking a Co first, don't attack unless camps, CC, and spells are full, use both attacks (shouldn't have to say that one), check chat before attacking, and obey war reservations.  We give members the opertunity to reserve bases for a first war attack, we mail it before war starts.  In the never ending search to find recruits without having to strain through the global trash, we also just made a YouTube channel a few days ago.  The name of the channel is The Books of Clash.  But yeah, not exactly what you are looking for bit if you want strategy and that atmosphere then we'd be more than happy to have you, and we don't mind you sitting out war to upgrade your hero's."

We are a respectful clan with lots to offer.   We are always actively recruiting and would love to have you join. We hope to hear from you.   We war 2 times a week and are a level 4 clan. We have 1 perfect war record and because we only war 2 times a week, we require everyone to be ready on those 2 war days.  If for some reason you are not able to war (we understand, life happens) be sure to opt out.  If you are in the war, make sure to attack based on our war strategy.   Here is some information, feel free to message me on here for more information.   * We are a full time war clan looking for people who want to get better at wars.  We are always striving to be the best that we can be. We always help each other with critiques; if you are hard headed and cant take criticism because you are the best at this game... Then no reason to join here, you should be in a TOP war clan. ;)   * We take wars very seriously and so should you.   * Requirements are th7 and lvl 2 drags (exceptions are acceptable under special circumstances).   * If you are looking for a clan that wars 2 times a week with active off days, then come join us.

However I do have some advice for you. Try to focus on upgrading your troops before working so much on defense, specifically x-bows. X-bows carry a lot of weight in war so the higher level they are the higher the matchup you'll have to face in war. Considering the fact that you don't have a level 10 king yet and don't have level 6 loons I would recommend halting defensive upgrades, especially if you have trouble 3 starring your mirror. Google the term THx.5. It's a pretty interesting read/watch depending on where you're looking and is definitely the way to go at TH9."

We are an adult, level 6 clan with 101 war wins and have won 19 of our last 20 wars. We are mostly composed of TH9s and TH8s, with a few TH10s. We take war seriously, and focus on 3 star attacks. We're looking for focused, mature, and active players who will put in the effort to excel.  Here is our war record for the last 4 pages (goes back 44 wars):  http://imgur.com/7Hmg4vo,dVwRV8K,jce78tR,Ui9cVEr#0  TH8s must have level 4 hogs, a level 5 heal spell, level 5 wizards, a level 5 barbarian king, and at least all level 7 walls. TH8s also must be willing to take the TH8.5 route until a certain level of troops and heroes are reached.  TH8.5s are welcome! You must have max TH8 war troops, but you may not have built xbows. Building other new TH9 defenses apart from xbows is discouraged at the start of TH9, but we'll take it on a case by case basis for new recruits.  TH9s with xbows and new defenses should have have max hogs, max loons, level 4 golems, level 2 witches, level 8 walls, and a combined hero level of at least 30.   TH10s must have max TH9 war troops, level 9 walls, and a combined hero level of 50. TH9.5s may consider joining with lower heroes or walls, but we'll take that on a case by case basis.  We require members to join our clan GroupMe where we plan war attacks, mark up bases, and display our strategies.  New members must also be at least 18 years old.  We also have a clan YouTube channel that showcases some of our attacks, and I am always willing to make a video of any clan members attack (good or bad) if they want some constructive criticism.   We war constantly, but members may opt in and out as needed. You may request as much as you like, but members are expected to donate at least 500 troops per season (this doesn't apply for members joining mid-season).   Check out our subreddit and YouTube channel linked below, and if you are interested in applying click here.

Cheers  Looks like you have good balance and wisely transitioning from mass drags to gowipe or gowiwi. You'd fit in well with us as we war alot but not constant (on day of rest between  wars) so there's plenty of time to jump in and out. Hope to see you on the battlefield. Cheersbrah    Bloodbrahs (clan tag #8YOL228R) is a legit LVL 4 clan with a strong core of players who know how to throw down in war and enjoy a relaxed no-donation ratio and friendly farming environment      If you are a non-rushed brah (man or woman) who wants to be in a very active clan that wars at a strong frequency and encourages a TH peer ranged war attacks.. come join us..   If you are a brah (man or woman) and prefers to periodically opt-out of war and farm till your face melts off without persecution.. come join us..  If you are a brah (man or woman) that is just plain tired of your disorganized and inactive clan of jabronies and wants to contribute into a true bromocracy.. come join us..  There is NO abusive smack talk, troll bases, or donation requirements. Anyone who consistently 2-3 war stars within thier matchup range, has a solid war base and actively contributes can be bromoted to elder and then co-lead (seriously,,, co-lead brahs.. this is a bromocracy). We currently war about every 3 days (1 day of rest between wars) we cycle in members to maximize winning potential and promote to encourage good war strategy brahavior.   Stop looking at all these ridiculous highly regimented clans of dweebs.. life is too short.. enjoy the game without feeling like your in a prison camp.. work hard and play harder with your brahs  To join.. please say: ""I ain't no Jabronie""  May your troops die valiantly and violently    Cheersbrahs,  Clan leader: GrizzzlyPhlanks (TH9 100+XP)  ""Yesterday, you said tomorrow.

Our 3 most recent wars have all been perfect wars. Our record is 39-6-1. We use clashcaller to keep wars organized  Origins uses groupme to communicate and discuss war attacks and strats. We also use it to help discuss what went wrong with attacks and if any of our members have questions they can contact leadership through it. Along with groupme we have a subreddit, /r/holderclashers where we post helpful vids and guides.   If this sounds like the clan for you feel free to apply and be sure to mention you're from reddit. If you have any questions feel free to pm me or reply to this post  Edit: wanted to also include that onehive is a great source for learning how to attack a th8.

We're looking for focused, mature, and active players who will put in the effort to excel.  Here is our war record for the last 4 pages (goes back 44 wars):  http://imgur.com/7Hmg4vo,dVwRV8K,jce78tR,Ui9cVEr#0  TH8s must have level 4 hogs, a level 5 heal spell, level 5 wizards, a level 5 barbarian king, and at least all level 7 walls. TH8s also must be willing to take the TH8.5 route until a certain level of troops and heroes are reached.  TH8.5s are welcome! You must have max TH8 war troops, but you may not have built xbows. Building other new TH9 defenses apart from xbows is discouraged at the start of TH9, but we'll take it on a case by case basis for new recruits.  TH9s with xbows and new defenses should have have max hogs, max loons, level 4 golems, level 2 witches, level 8 walls, and a combined hero level of at least 30.   TH10s must have max TH9 war troops, level 9 walls, and a combined hero level of 50. TH9.5s may consider joining with lower heroes or walls, but we'll take that on a case by case basis.  We require members to join our clan GroupMe where we plan war attacks, mark up bases, and display our strategies.  New members must also be at least 18 years old.  We also have a clan YouTube channel that showcases some of our attacks, and I am always willing to make a video of any clan members attack (good or bad) if they want some constructive criticism.   We war constantly, but members may opt in and out as needed. You may request as much as you like, but members are expected to donate at least 500 troops per season (this doesn't apply for members joining mid-season).

We are always striving to be the best that we can be. We always help each other with critiques; if you are hard headed and cant take criticism because you are the best at this game... Then no reason to join here, you should be in a TOP war clan. ;)   * We take wars very seriously and so should you.   * Requirements are th7 and lvl 2 drags (exceptions are acceptable under special circumstances).   * If you are looking for a clan that wars 2 times a week with active off days, then come join us. Make sure to put that you heard about us from reddit when you ask to join the clan.  #9U2CY0RVclantag."

ClashOfClansRecruit,3b3kyu,EastCoastClash,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:14:46 2015 UTC,I'll drop this here if you are still interested. Keep EastCoastClash in mind if you look for a solid clan in the future.

Currently, they have around 100 clans. The database is very well-organized and updated. You can see at the same time the info of several clans to compare them and see which one fits better your gaming style.  Cheers."

ClashOfClansRecruit,3b3kyu,donniccolo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:33:50 2015 UTC,"Hi there, I'm a co-leader & recruiter for one of the top clans in the game. Our L5 clan has over 75 war wins. We are looking for new solid, long-term players & we'd like to give you a try! Our tag = #8CR2RVJ (Maxed Morter). We have just a few spots remaining so I encourage you to give us a look soon.    We war twice per week (constant during war boosts).  We use the rest of the week to farm/donate/upgrade Heroes, etc. We have over 40 strong adult, drama-free members who play and donate frequently. Many of us are in the USA (Ohio, Texas, DC, San Diego, etc) with a few spread around the globe. We have men & women and a few couples. All are solid players.   Hop in and be sure to mention me (@donniccolo) from Reddit so the other leaders know who you are & because if we're in a war they won't let you in without a reference. If you join us, attack as per our war strategy & donate only what is requested. Ask questions if you're unsure. Have fun! Cheers!"

ClashOfClansRecruit,3b2zzr,MikeTheMann,2,Thu Jun 25 21:08:23 2015 UTC,"Nevermind, I'm dumb :D"
ClashOfClansRecruit,3b2zzr,MikeTheMann,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:09:19 2015 UTC,Hello I would like to join your clan. I'm a TH8 and very active in war. I cant request in game as your clan is closed.
