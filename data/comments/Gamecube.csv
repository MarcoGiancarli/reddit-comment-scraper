Gamecube,3dz974,BCProgramming,0,Tue Jul 21 14:14:26 2015 UTC,"So the full story is that I had my old Gamecube the purple for many years and it worked fine but, in the last year or so it started to not read my games, even ones in near perfect condition. So I decided it had to be the Gamecube. But because of my life I couldn't  get the money to buy a new one even though they are pretty cheap. But, when my older brother got a part time job at subway he decided the first he wanted to do was upgrade my old Gamecube( the purple). So we got it today and it works so much better now and I can finally play my mini gamecube collection without the trouble of having to open and close the gamecube when the gamecube can't read a game every 2 mins. I also got a second good condition controller ( the one below the new gamecube ) because the ones in the pile are getting pretty good at not working. But anyway that is all sorry for rambling I'm just happy with my new gamecube!"

Gamecube,3dv9pi,pixiestix88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:15:11 2015 UTC,"One way to start would be to disassemble both and just observe what looks the same and what looks different. I'm not an electrical engineer and don't suggest you try to be one either, but it might be simple like you're saying.  Given the layout being similar, there is a chance this is possible, but the guts would definitely be different since the fight pad has a few additional buttons not on a gamecube controller. You might also be able to somehow figure out a way to swap guts between a GC controller and this one.   It wouldn't be impossible, but to make it work with a gamecube would likely prevent it from working with a Wii U in the future.  Sorry for the terrible response lol"

Gamecube,3doosa,CrinerBoyz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:47:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I generally prefer more arcadey sports games. Slugfest is like Blitz for baseball, right? I always liked Blitz and NHL Hitz, but I don't think I ever tried Slugfest. I've never played any Mario Baseball games either."
Gamecube,3doosa,CrinerBoyz,3,Sat Jul 18 01:23:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, Slugfest is a Midway game so it has the same over-the-top commentators, punchable players, players ""on fire"", etc. It's probably my least favorite when compared to Hitz, Blitz, and the Midway NBA games, but it's still very fun, especially when you play against a friend.   Mario Superstar Baseball and its sequel Mario Super Sluggers (on Wii) are excellent and they live up to the standards set by Mario Golf and Tennis. There's a neat challenge mode where you assemble a team and defeat other teams filled with Mario characters, after which you can recruit their players. It's fun to work your way up from a team of scrubs to a bunch of mainstream Mario characters. There's also plenty of minigames and gimmick playing fields. I'd recommend this for both single player and multiplayer."

If you're into more whimsical baseball I might recommend Mario Superstar Baseball instead."

Gamecube,3d24f6,YoshiYogurt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:39:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was considering doing the same thing. And I've taken apart my Ps1 before to fix a problem it had, along with my N64 and a few others, so I'm comfortable taking systems apart :) lol. Thanks for the advice."
Gamecube,3d24f6,PooGod,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:44:15 2015 UTC,"If the laser is off its calibration, you can fix it for basically free. You'll need a screwdriver to open it,  a triwing screwdriver to be exact. Once you get it open there is actually a tiny tiny screw that you can adjust to recalibrate the laser. Try to look for a tutorial online, but it's a lot easier than it sounds."

When it came out it was definitely the best graphics I had ever seen at the time, and everything seemed so new and weird. It really had that nintendo magic."

There are so many hidden gems for it, in so many genres (particularly Japanese exclusives) that means there's always some kind of mystery to it. It kind of feels like Nintendo's 3D version of the Super Nintendo, with the N64 being the NES."

Gamecube,3crqx2,cadika_orade,2,Fri Jul 10 11:30:22 2015 UTC,I've always found it to be much more satisfying to play console games on their original machines rather than pc emulation. Without the console you lose a great deal of the fun and charm.
Gamecube,3crqx2,Cross-Country,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:58:53 2015 UTC,"Consider me biased against consoles, but I do have a soft spot for Gamecube, so I emulate it.

Gamecube,3crqx2,cadika_orade,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:03:27 2015 UTC,"There's an historical aspect to it which is lost without the original machine. I'm a PC gamer as well, I just don't understand the hate for consoles (especially ones from previous generations). On top of that if you're ""biased against consoles"" what are you doing on a Gamecube sub? That's not meant as any sort of personal attack it's just that this sub is targeted toward those of us who collect for this machine and the last thing any of us want is any sort of PC Master Race shit rolling around."
Gamecube,3crqx2,Cross-Country,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:10:09 2015 UTC,"On top of that if you're ""biased against consoles"" what are you doing on a Gamecube sub?   If you'd read the whole sentence, I specifically said I still like Gamecube.  And yes, I can understand the historical aspect. I still collect NES and Gamecube stuff myself, in addition to vintage computers. I just don't understand why it is less fun to play with better graphics when all else is the same. Playing for nostalgia? I get that. It's why I still have a Gamecube hooked to my TV. But saying that emulators are less fun and not giving any reason for it makes no sense.  I mean, if you're going to upscale to HD anyway, why not play in actual HD? You're already throwing out the original graphics quality in favor of fuzzy upscaling.  EDIT: To reiterate my point, if you want satisfying historical accuracy, stop playing in upscaled HD and play on an analog TV like we did when Gamecube was new."
Gamecube,3crqx2,cadika_orade,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:00:01 2015 UTC,"I do in fact play my Cube on an analog TV. :)  I've never tried upscaling it, and if that's what the discussion was sorry for that misunderstanding. I misconstrued it as ""you should always play it on Dolphin.""  As for ""not giving a reason,"" I gave one when I brought up the historical aspect. I think it's best to play it on an original console hooked up to an analog TV to best re-live the original experience."
Gamecube,3crqx2,Cross-Country,2,Fri Jul 10 14:13:54 2015 UTC,"Okay. I can respect that.

Since the C-stick receives a lot less abuse than the left stick, it's sometimes possible to just swap them and end up with a better controller overall."
Gamecube,3cilx3,finklemcgraw,15,Wed Jul 8 04:57:38 2015 UTC,"I think yes and no. I think that the similarities are superficial ones: they are both commercially ""unsuccessful"" for being Nintendo products (perfectly reasonable success just not cultural phenomena*) and they both receive a lot of poorly thought out criticisms (Purple lunch box/""people can't watch two screens at once what were they thinking?""). Otherwise I think they are pretty different. Wii U was meant to be a multi-media device from the start, the GameCube is a dedicated gaming device; GameCube received third-party support whereas the Wii U is pretty barren in that regard; the GameCube was chasing after the market for ""hardcore gamers"" whereas the Wii U is meant to be ""for the whole family"" (multi-media, off-screen play, emphasis on local multiplayer); and the GameCube was very much traditional in its control input whereas the Wii U's specialty is asymmetric gameplay. Though if you mean ""next GameCube"" as in it will be remembered fondly and has a smaller but passionate fanbase then you're totally right."
Gamecube,3cilx3,passwordisnottime,13,Wed Jul 8 05:10:16 2015 UTC,"The Wii U's biggest flaw was the name itself.   You cannot sell what people already think they have. When kids can't easily ask for it and be understood, how are parents ever going to buy it?  It was a ridiculously simple problem that caused a massive hurdle for the marketing team.  It also had ""no games"" which is a tough image to shake. Launch titles were generally terrible and scared people away from the already limited 3rd party library. The good games came too late, and too far between for most people."
Gamecube,3cilx3,Error400BadRequest,3,Wed Jul 8 07:20:27 2015 UTC,"I really don't think it's hard for the kids to ask for it and explain that it's the new version of the wii that plays the new mario. My ex's brother and my niece easily asked for and explained what it was to their parents but that is just anecdotal. Though I think the lack of marketing in a way that adults/parents especially can easily understand was an issue because they would see a commercial/advertisement* with the gamepad at a glance, think it's an addon for the Wii, then never think about it again. and the fact that if they did discover it and saw that it was $300+ it no longer had the appeal of being the most affordable choice (at the time). I think the ""no games"" is the primary reason it never took off."

Gamecube,3cilx3,Zeppelanoid,5,Wed Jul 8 15:00:25 2015 UTC,"It was a classic video game console. It wasn't full of gimmicks like Nintendos last two consoles.

Gamecube,3cilx3,snookums,4,Wed Jul 8 17:50:59 2015 UTC,Arguably so is pausing the game to look at a menu screen.
Gamecube,3cilx3,fineillmakeone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:36:32 2015 UTC,"The difference is that there's actually a cognitive shift when you look from one screen to another. That's just basic cognitive science. Also, pausing is a lot better than looking down at the same menu screen, only to realize you missed something on screen. This is why I can't understand people who say Wind Waker on the Wii U is better. The menu is actually worse to use in combat, because you don't get the pause, and you have to look away from your 40 inch hd television to pick an item. It didn't take me long to switch the settings back to classic."
Gamecube,3cilx3,snookums,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:04:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with your analysis on the whole, but based on sales it will be a lot harder to find other people IRL who played and really loved Wii U than GC. I really think Wii U, in a generation's time, could be viewed as more comparable to Virtual Boy than GC. If Nintendo mess up the NX launch, it could be the critical point in the company's development of hardware for sure."
Gamecube,3cilx3,DrTitanium,7,Mon Jul 20 16:25:44 2015 UTC,"For me unlikely. It doesn't bring the content like the cube did.  The biggest problem is the Wii U's lack of library. We don't even have staple games. Sure we got Mario. Okay great what else?  Zelda Remake? oh. but we got a zelda game eventually 2016. Metroid? no. Kirby? No. Animal Crossing? Sorta. but its a spin off that is iffy so far.   The console needs more content period. There isnt a solid library. I only use mine for smash and mario kart. If they would throw a new pokemon stadium/pokemon snap, Kirby air ride,or a new metroid the system would sell like hotcakes. Heck if they would HD remake the rare games (instead of letting xbox get them.) they would have done great.  Nintendo's niche right now would be couch co-op games. Current/next gen consoles are totally skipping out on this. Which is a bummer on the consumer end.   To be honest i mostly use my Wii U to play gamecube games via homebrew."
Gamecube,3cilx3,pixiestix88,3,Thu Jul 9 04:02:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I have no idea why it's taking Nintendo 4 years to release a new Zelda game on its flagship console.
Gamecube,3cilx3,rae1988,5,Thu Jul 9 14:59:01 2015 UTC,Yeah its very disappointing. The 3DS has more zelda games. I feel like the 3DS is the flagship now.

Gamecube,3cilx3,rae1988,3,Fri Jul 10 01:00:53 2015 UTC,I highly recommend buying the 3DS. Its a great console for when you are on the go or just want to chill in bed and play games. Plus if you dont have the DS you got all that library of games as well. I have the current consoles (i spoil myself ><) the PS4 is great but i would recommend waiting a bit for a good deal/black Friday since there isnt enough exclusives yet to justify it if you have the Xbox one.
Gamecube,3cilx3,pixiestix88,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:57:19 2015 UTC,"for sure, there's only a few ps4 exclusives out now!   But this most recent E3 showed a ton of new exclusive games. (unchartered, i think final Fantasy, and a bunch i can't remember, lol). I was thinking of waiting till the ps4 Destiny-The Taken King collectors bundle comes out (cause it looks super sweet, and i want all the ps4 exclusive Destiny content) to buy it.   I'd only buy the Wii U for Pikmin 3. Literally no other games look appealing right now. But its $300 for the console, $80 for the boxed game, and another $50 for a regular controller that wouldn't be annoying to use. Spending more than $400 is a little high for one game, haha.  Within the next month or two, i'm definitely gonna get the new 3ds. Get Majoras Mask, Animal Crossing, maybe harvest moon, and a ton of other games, lol.

I have more fun with my Wii U than anything else (consoles/PC/etc...). They should have called it GC U it's so good.  I never could get into most Wii games and mine sat unused for 3 years until Xenoblade Chronicles released. But the Wii U. I'm just having fun. From Splatoon to even Watch Doges.
Gamecube,3cilx3,macdude22,4,Wed Jul 8 14:33:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think the Wii U is the next Dreamcast.  A console that was heavily overlooked at it's time, but will be remembered for all the great games it had on it."
Gamecube,3cilx3,SonicGamer74,3,Wed Jul 8 18:46:15 2015 UTC,"I like to think of it more as a better Wii. It serves as a good upgrade for hardcore wii fans. I've had a Wii since it launched but after 2009 my interest in it faded once I picked up and HD console. Now that I have the WiiU I'm going back and playing the Wii games I missed at the second half of its life and having a blast. The WiiU is what the Wii should have been imo.   The GameCube is a different beast. It actually had pretty decent third party support. Was aimed at hardcore gamers. The titles for GameCube were both similar but also a bit different. I feel like Nintendo experimented more back then. Mario Sunshine had Fluud, Wind Waker tried a new graphic style and approach to navigation. You also had more traditional games like F-Zero GX and Twilight Princess. It was a pretty quirky console when it was all said and done."
Gamecube,3cilx3,miniboss1487,4,Wed Jul 8 15:20:54 2015 UTC,"No, the Wii U's catalog is nothing compared to the quality of the Gamecube's. I think people are really reaching to compare the two. The Gamecube was a powerful console that still got a lot of third party titles, and Nintendo was pumping out some of their most creative work, not derivative Mario titles. It had two Metroid, two new real Zeldas, Eternal Darkness, Geist, four real Mario Party games (none of that single car bullshit), two Call of Duty games, an F-Zero, a Final Fantasy offshoot, Geist, Mario Sunshine,Luigi's Mansion, Mortal Kombat, a couple dozen sport games, three Pacman World games, the first two Pikmin games, the Resident Evil collection, two Star Fox games, etc.  Just making this list out, I'm absolutely amazed at the quantity and variety of the games we got for Gamecube. The Wii U's library is shallow in comparison. No, I don't think it will be remembered as fondly."
Gamecube,3cilx3,snookums,2,Wed Jul 8 16:20:35 2015 UTC,"This exactly is why I think the Wii and Wii U never took off as well as the Gamecube. Most of the games coming out for Wii U are just 2.0 versions of their predecessors.  Gamecube has some extremely innovative titles, where nowadays, a fair amount of good games I've seen for Wii U are really late releases from Xbox and PS4."

Gamecube,3cilx3,Hellocollegejason,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:37:01 2015 UTC,"I was actually thinking about this exact thing the other day.  The GameCube (just like the Wii U) underperformed on the market, was heavily criticized for many lacking features, and was very overlooked and unappreciated.  Take a look at the GameCube today, though; it has some of the most high-demand, expensive games on the retro market.  It's more than just a case of obscurity, too.   I've been playing anything and everything since the 2600, and I can honestly say that the GameCube has one of the strongest game libraries you can find on any console, and though it took about a decade, people are starting to realize this, too.  The Wii U will play out the same way, because there's no denying that its fantastic library (which can only get stronger at this point) is being slept on for all the same reasons as the GameCube, but there will be a day many years from now that it gets the appreciation it deserves."

Gamecube,3cilx3,Newman4185,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:54:01 2015 UTC,"I quit team Nintendo after the Gamecube. When the Wii came out, I was interested in seeing how the motion control mechanic would play out and in the end, I felt it was just a gimmick.  The Gamecube had many cool games I liked: Metroid Prime, Eternal Darkness, Killer7, Resident Evil, Phantasy Star Online Episode III, etc. A lot of the ""hits"" on the Wii were simply ported from the cube: Twilight Princess, Resident Evil 4, Prime series, etc. A lot of the other hits are just updated editions of the cube games: Smash Brawl, Prime 3, Mario Kart, Mario Party, etc.  I knew that motion controls were bad when I tried playing some FPS games on the Wii. Really bad and inaccurate. Nintendo failed to make online play a priority, so there wasn't much incentive for me to buy the system.  The type of games I enjoy are hardcore, gameplay-focused games. I like games that have a lot of meat to study and get better at. The Wii U is another continuation of the Wii, with the difference that the Wii U loses the ""cool"" factor that the Wii had because it was so different at the time.  The thing is with the latest Nintendo consoles is that I just don't feel the need to own them. Mario Party? I have plenty of older Mario Parties. Smash U? Melee is still the most popular smash out there. Mario and Zelda? You have older incarnations that play just as great. Nintendo still lacks a robust online network like Xbox or Steam as well.  So the 2 main strengths of Nintendo are: lots of quality local multiplayer titles (Smash, Mario Party, Mario Kart, etc.) and the staple Nintendo titles (Zelda, Mario, Metroid, etc.). The thing is for the former, I'm perfectly content with the titles on the Gamecube like Smash Melee or Mario Party 4-7. For the latter, I feel like they were at their best with the Gamecube versions (Metroid Prime, The Wind Waker, Mario Sunshine) and I really don't have desire to play the new ones. So it makes the Wii U do nothing for me.  And the games I am interested in are on the PC or other consoles: Bloodborne, Dark Souls, The Last of Us, Starcraft, Street Fighter, etc.  So I just felt that the pinnacle Nintendo experience was on the Gamecube and as such, I feel it's unnecessary to get the Wii or Wii U. Next, the titles I actually like are on other consoles."

They go underneath the button to hit the contact on the motherboard, and if a controller is pretty old then you might have some success swapping those out for new rubber pieces. You might be able to find replacements online, otherwise you'll need to purchase a new controller."

Gamecube,3btrq5,jesusfromthebible,-1,Thu Jul 2 15:37:32 2015 UTC,This is a valid concern but after playing with it for a while you kind of get a feel for where everything is on the screen. The small vibration helps in ensuring that you actually hit the button you were going for. Obviously it wont be anywhere near as tactile as a regular controller but you gain portability.
Gamecube,3btrq5,CoryZ40,2,Thu Jul 2 17:50:38 2015 UTC,"This is so damn true, a pet hate of mine is when someone makes a smartphone app - lets say it's a 2D platformer - and they slap a d-pad and two buttons on screen. Great, now my fingers cover where I'm going on screen. Just because it worked for a NES pad doesn't mean it translates to a phone. Design from the bottom up, with hardware in mind. Another prime example of this is poor Wii/Wii U ports that clearly weren't designed for the hardware."

Gamecube,3btrq5,YoshiYogurt,-3,Thu Jul 2 16:15:08 2015 UTC,The most difficult task in this project is getting the app to work as smoothly on Iphone and Windows. I'm confident in my Java skills for Android but I would need to hire IOS and Windows phone devs to get this app perfect. Neither of the two are cheap which is why I'm asking for a somewhat generous amount. My worst fear is that I would run out of funding and be left with a half completed app. It would take quite a long time to learn to code in Obj. C and Visual basic to finish the Iphone and Windows side of the app.  I'll definitely be putting this in the description thank you for your feedback
Gamecube,3btrq5,boxcarjakey,5,Thu Jul 2 03:43:59 2015 UTC,"I think (if you haven't already considered this) that there should be multiple layouts available. For instance, maybe one with the buttons arranged more similarly to the Gamecube's buttons (With the A button sort of in the middle). If you make it compatible with Android tablets, then perhaps also include a C-stick, as well as a N64 controller layout."
Gamecube,3btrq5,Ninja337,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:46:28 2015 UTC,Yeah actually this has been considered. The smartphone's ability to display any kind of layout should be taken advantage of!

Gamecube,3bjgyg,pixiestix88,3,Wed Jul 1 09:44:40 2015 UTC,This correct!
Gamecube,3bjgyg,pixiestix88,3,Mon Jun 29 19:57:56 2015 UTC,"There are a few ways to do this.  Gamecube-     The original system. Can be found 30-60. Depending on the condition/color etc. Finding games for cheap can be challenging. You are looking at 20-60 for popular games.   Wii-      Can play of course wii games and select models can play the game cube games. Just be sure to check before buying. Video quality will be higher then the original Gamecube thanks to component (red, blue, green).    Homebrew-     You can either homebrew your wii or I homebrewed my Wii U. It can be kind of scary but there are guides that make it very easy (my first time). Have access to all games with HDMI quality (Wii U) Vs Wii (component). You can play with a Gamecube controllers via the smash adapter.  Emulator-  You can emulate games via Dolphin. Can be very hard on your system and depends on your specs. This is my least favorite option since the games can be a bit tricky to getting them to work perfectly and fps can drop. Also most people use a xbox 360 controller instead.  Myself, i have both. I have the original Gamecube that i have hooked up to old timey wimey TV.  But i do use the homebrewed Wii U to try out games before i buy them or expensive titles that i don't have yet."
Gamecube,3bjgyg,SwervinGirvin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:57:29 2015 UTC,Thank you!!
Gamecube,3bjgyg,Destroyer_Wes,2,Mon Jun 29 20:20:00 2015 UTC,"Hello! Glad to hear you're interested in the GameCube and want to get into collecting/playing! I'm going to be brief on my thoughts on the Wii. It's 1. Not a GameCube. 2. Although cheaper component cables exist, they are just that, cheaper cables. 3. You obviously wanted opinions on GC setups or you would have just gone straight to r/wii. Ok! Moving on. I'm gonna give you an idea of what I've personally used and had smashing success with as far as A/V and how to get ""back ups"" going without any console modification.  A short breakdown of my set ups:  Setup 1 (Main) - 24"" Sony PlayStation 3D display, GameCube Model DOL-001(Indigo), Component Cables, BBA, GameBoy Player.  Setup 2 (Alt) - 36"" Sony KV36HS500 Trinitron, Char's Custom GameCube Model DOL-001, Monster S-Video cable, Gameboy Player.  Now for your information the GC connected via component cables is awesome. But I paid a pretty penny and would suggest that if you have the money then go to it, if not then be sure to get some adequate s-video cables, meaning nothing with those composite and s-video plugs, most of those just force composite signal through an s-video port and the result is poor. Also try to get a CRT or HD CRT. Trinitron's are my go to, people all have opinions though so feel free to do research and make a choice that suits you.  Now here is my personal component vs s-video/composite experience. So I get in on the component stuff late in the game but had some money to spend on the cables so I did. Got them in the mail hooked them up to the Trinitron, fired up the GC with Wind Waker in it and was prepared to feast my eyes on it's glory only to be greeted with SLIGHTLY better color depth and shading! I was like Okay so this was worth all that money? I couldn't let that defeat me though. So I found the Sony 3D insanely cheap and connected the GC to it via component and my money was instantly well spent. Rich color, vibrant textures, crisp text, the works. Now being the avid collector and hunter I tracked down some Monster Nintendo GameCube s-video cables and decided to treat myself for my birthday 3 weeks ago. Plugging these into my GC and then into my Trinitron was a huge improvement! Almost on par with component on the same display! That being said, this is what I'd recommend if you are on a budget. The cables I got are also quite pricy but they are work trucking all my Nintendo systems in my game room so it was worth it to me, again my opinion as any quality s-video cable should suit the need just fine. Just try and steer clear of composite if you can help it, especially going into a modern HDTV.   Alright after that winded speech, yet another winded speech. This time involving ways to save your lazer, get back ups booting, hardware/software needed for these tasks. I think I'll go list format for this to keep it shorter:    Action Replay/SD Media Launcher - OK this is a piece of software & hardware combo made by Datel. What this allows you to do is boot the SWISS.DOL from your SD Card adapter. I highly recommend the software, however the SD Media card reader that comes with the kit is a piece of shit. SD Card Reader - Like I said the one in the kit is garbage, so you'll have to order a better one from China. It's really cheap $5.33 usd shipping included from Eachmall.com What to search for would be WiiKey or simply SD card reader gamecube.   2x SD Cards - The first SD card to me is a pointless and terrible step in this process but with the cost of this set up vs more intense ones it's a necessary evil. Ok less digression more information, the first card is used just to boot the SWISS.DOL and it MUST be an older non-SDHC/XC preferably a class 2 or 4. I saw a pair of these at my local Walmart for like $9.99 so that's still in the ball park for college income right? Now the second card can be of you choosing and the sky is the limit but I know SWISS's Creator EmuKidd has tried up to 128gb. The second card is where you will store your back up ISO files.    Ok, let me clarify before someone roasts me, I'm in NO WAY advocating piracy, just providing options for preserving the lazer's life and making life easier when it comes to playing games that they might could get that have booting issues or severe scratching.   So back on topic. The estimated cost here with the AR + SD Reader + SD Cards is in the ball park of $65 bucks considering the hit you'll take in shipping on the Action Replay (damn you Datel). But that's what a CIB Twilight Princess will run you. So that's why I felt it relevant to mention.  OK for the TL;DR people:  1. Gamecube better than Wii 2. Component>S-Video>Composite  3. For the cost of 1 game you could have a wealth of homebrew/back ups/options you wouldn't have otherwise   Really hope this helps! Have any questions just pm me I'll be glad to help clarify anything you don't get.  Edit: spelling errors."
Gamecube,3bjgyg,miniboss1487,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:39:02 2015 UTC,You have several options. If you are interested in playing Gameboy Advance games as well as Gamecube games buy a Gamecube. If you are just interested in playing Gamecube  games go get a backward compatible Wii. You can find both probably pretty cheap at your local Flea Market or Retro Game store. I have both. Emulators stink I wouldn't use them but thats me.
Gamecube,3bjgyg,RebelWithoutACog,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:48:20 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend the Wii because the component cable is far more cheaper on that console than the $200 cable for the GC. However there is nothing like playing on the original GameCube and hearings that boot up sound! Basically Wii for playing two amazing libraries of games, or GC for pure nostalgia."
Gamecube,3bkk84,joelthezombie15,2,Mon Jun 29 23:51:42 2015 UTC,Open it.  Open everything.  Clean it.  If you aren't taking the controller and game system into pieces you won't be able to remove all the smoke-impregnated dust.

Gamecube,3bkk84,Bamboobag_Pandarrell,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:51:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, in my experience with items that smell like smoke, you can never get rid of it. You could try ozium spray but that is usually for rooms and fabric, plus it will smell like lemons and cigarettes. I got a wii on Craigslist for really cheap, it stunk so bad and I tried to treat it. Nothing helped so I just sold it to someone else (advertised how bad it smelled, before I sold it). I would contact the seller for a refund as it was not advertised, eBay always sides with the buyer. Gamecubes are relatively easy to find and relatively cheap In my experience, so unless it is a rare system, or came with rare games, I would send it back."
Gamecube,3bkk84,pixiestix88,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:48:21 2015 UTC,Ya its not terriblely strong smelling anymore but it does still stink.   I just told the seller about it and he refunded half and is even letting me keep it so I'm not to angry. He didn't have to do that.   I don't really have much money and I got a really good deal on this one and it's in fantastic shape aside from the smell so finding one as good will cost more than I spent so I can't afford it.  Thanks for the advice though. I'll just see if the smell goes away on its own after a few weeks.
Gamecube,3bkk84,heshhhh,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:51:34 2015 UTC,"Do not drench the system with febreeze like someone else said. This is asking for a broken gamecube.

Gamecube,3bkk84,DerekStu,2,Tue Jun 30 07:40:15 2015 UTC,I got it out. I got 2 dryer sheets and put one on each vent and kept then there for a little bit and that got rid of the rest of the smell mostly.

And don't say because it makes you happy, say why it does. I can't think of anything I ever bought that I never had a use for. Except for a band t-shirt this one time but that was more of a foolish decision in the moment. I have never thought to myself ""Hey, I'm gonna buy this game/movie/album/gas powered dildo and then I'm never going to use it but I will hang it on my wall to stare at now and then.""  I have a lot of friends that do this sort of thing with sports jerseys or figurines and I just don't understand it. To me it's not practical.

Different strokes for different folks. I've never thought to myself ""Hey, I'm gonna buy a ticket to a sporting event so I can watch other adults play catch."" That doesn't interest me, but I understand how it interests others.    And don't say because it makes you happy, say why it does   If you are asking the psychology behind the collector mindset, there are plenty of articles and reasons behind collector behavior. It boils down to a few different reasons, which you can research at your leisure.   Personally, I am a completionist and an archivist. I derive pleasure from knowing that I have ""all"" of something. I can look at my collection of (insert one of the various collections I have), see that there is no empty space because I've collected them all, and it gives me a warm fuzzy feeling.   I occasionally drag out my boxes filled with Dragon Dice, all neatly sorted into their little Plano boxes, and catalog them in a spreadsheet, just to return them to the closet, knowing full-well that I'll likely never get a chance to play with them again. I also know that if I ever do get the chance to play, I have every option available to me.   When I made a retro gaming rig with emulators, I meticulously tracked down ROMs for every game released on each system, including those released only internationally, and cataloged them. I may never in my life play Dick Tracy on NES, but if for any reason I ever want to, I can.   I enjoy looking at the collections I own. I may never use them, but I find simple, honest joy in their existence, in my possession. It's ineffable."

My only excuse for having them is because there might be a player I like that's in one game but not in the other or there's a feature that I want to try out, like in Madden '07 where some how that's the only one in which you can play co-op in franchise mode (nobody except for me cares about that).

Cool story bro.
Gamecube,3bfyzm,ThePetaLand,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:58:15 2015 UTC,"No I didn't answer my own question, I'm wondering why people spend so much money just to end up leaving the game on a shelf without playing it. There's a reason I used the word ""collecting"" instead of owning, I want to know why people buy a game just to look at or just to know that they have it. Personally I don't buy things that I'm not gonna use, I want to know the other point of view.  Also don't put a list of three answers if only one answer is thought out, no big deal it's just reddit but still."
Gamecube,3bfyzm,CurryGettinSpicy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:01:44 2015 UTC,Sometimes people want to be able to just bust out the game and experience it the the same way they did when they were younger. Some rather leave it on the shelf and merely reflect. Its a nostalgic thing for some cuz humans are weird like that. We associate certain memories and feelings with material things.. some collect just for the sake of collecting Nintendo history because..  well they admire it.

Gamecube,3bgr30,CrinerBoyz,6,Mon Jun 29 02:10:25 2015 UTC,"My understanding- and, I hope if it is not the case somebody will correct me, is that the logo is added during the initial run after they've printed some number of inlays, like 500K or something. Usually the initial volume is based on the demand from retailers for the game. This logo appears on Player's Choice Title's as well in the same manner."
Gamecube,3bgr30,BCProgramming,3,Mon Jun 29 02:53:32 2015 UTC,"Interesting! If this is correct, it's definitely possible to have gotten a game with the Best Seller logo on day one if they printed beyond that ~500K threshold before the release date. Retailer demand would allow the manufacturer to print a large quantity early on. First party established franchises would very likely see a large initial run. That would explain just about everything. Thanks!"

Gamecube,3b3f5h,st1tchy,3,Thu Jun 25 17:29:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, and no. The only issue I have with it is that you mix companies, genres and spin-off titles. For instance, having ""first party, RPG, and mario titles"" as your catergories...   Organizing by developpers is good. But do only first party and third party. (and that weird second party intermediate?) or do genres like,  adventure, action, shooters, sports, RPGs, etc...) and disregard developpers. Does that make sense? Sorry if it doesn't.  Also, is Smash Bros widely considered a Mario title, and I just havent noticed? I've always given its own genre, I think platform fighter fits well."

SFA is a game you can get/sell CiB for around fifteen dollars online, Luigi's Mansion, maybe a bit more. The most I have paid for a GC game is forty five, and that was for Phantasy Star online. The games for this system vary in price greatly, but don't really (and by that, I mean they shouldn't at this point in time) go for more than $120 CiB.

Gamecube,3b1ks9,Sproux,5,Thu Jun 25 05:52:30 2015 UTC,"A Rom is a general term. All backed up games are Roms. So any NES games, SNES, GameCube games on the computer are ROMs. An ISO is a disk format that they can be in. NES games are .nes, snes are .snes gamecube are either .gc or .iso. The best emulator is Dolphin. It does Gamecube and Wii. And a quick google search can help you with getting Roms. Remember to only get ROMs that you legally own the disk version of."

Gamecube,3asei3,pixiestix88,2,Tue Jun 23 03:51:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   Story:  I found two ads on a local sale site for great prices, one ad being for the boxed console with games and bongos. The other being an indigo console with a hard shell case, at the time I didn't know the case was custom. I was under the impression it was a cheap third party case but still a nice find. When I picked up the console I was shocked to find it was an old saxophone case turned GameCube case by its previous owner. When I found out it was a custom case I offered to pay more for the deal because I felt I was being cheap but the owner said she was happy to see it go to someone who would take care of it.   Price:  Deal one was the boxed console, games and bongos. I paid $70 which I would have paid for the boxed console alone. Gotta love the power of buying a bundle.  Deal two was the console with the custom case which I paid $35 for which again I would have paid for the console alone. She wouldn't take more when I offered.  Custom case: Yes it was an old saxophone case the previous owner emptied and filled with stiff foam.  TL;DR: Story? Internet. Price? $105 total. Custom case? Yes"

There are a few people who have created their own board and gotten it working. And a few have made a board that just directly outputs HDMI. But no one has yet decided to take the time and expense to create a production model for consumers. As the original cables are now around $250, I am hopeful that someone will decide the time is right to make one.  While I wait for that, I am going to buy a Wii U and hack the Wii part of the system to play my Gamecube game backups.  I will be making Gamecube ISOs on my Wii since that can the read the Gamecube discs and the Wii U can't. Then I will run them from an SD card on the Wii mode of the Wii U using Nintendont.

Gamecube,3aorg6,lastpally,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:55:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, you could. However, than you would be going from digital to analog and back to digital. The signal would be as bad as the worst part in the chain which is the analog part. I think the Wii Analog output is poor(The gamecube special cable is much better). Converting it from analog back into digital does not fix the poor analog output. It just converts the bad analog signal into a digital one, keeping the bad artifacts. So my problem would not be solved.  Since my first post I have purchased a Wii U and now I am playing gamecube games through HDMI directly without any conversion and much of what I was annoyed with is fixed. It is a crisp output with good color and contrast unlike the Wii."
Gamecube,3aorg6,neut6o1,2,Mon Jun 29 00:16:13 2015 UTC,Probably won't ever be (at least for a long while) because there is some sort of chip in the cable that would have to be remade for a 3rd party cable to work

Gamecube,3amukq,LDSBL,2,Mon Jun 22 01:22:15 2015 UTC,"That game is awesome. But, here's why I think it's awesome:  I played it as a kid   The controls are janky, the plot is okay, and the voice to lip coordination is awful.  But I loved it as a kid. Most people have a strong nostalgic attachment to it, despite it not holding up that well."
Gamecube,3amukq,FlameMammoth,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:01:24 2015 UTC,Playing it as a kid is exactly the reason why I love it too. It's odd replaying the story now and seeing how awful the voice acting/syncing was.
Gamecube,3amukq,LDSBL,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:22:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Everyone (myself included) thinks its awesome, because thats how we remember it, lol."
Gamecube,3amukq,FruitTheory98,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:33:03 2015 UTC,I'm still looking forward to a Sonic Adventure 3.

Gamecube,3ak7tz,FIRST_DATE_ANAL,3,Sun Jun 21 00:32:47 2015 UTC,"Try contacting BadAss Consoles, he sells Gamecube parts on his website and I think he used to sell drives without the connector. The part you need isint listed but there's a good chance he has it if you contact him."
Gamecube,3ak7tz,patrickpf,3,Mon Jun 22 03:29:34 2015 UTC,i have one of those switches from a Gamecube I parted out.  I will sell to you!  PM me if you're interested OP
Gamecube,3ak7tz,retrogeek2013,2,Mon Jun 29 03:18:30 2015 UTC,"It's the piece that presses down when you close the top cover, telling the console it's closed so it knows to start spinning the disc. I managed to break it when I was putting a unit back together (I also broke the ""OPEN"" button, I snapped off its clips accidentally). You can see a wire unplugs from it and you can remove one screw and it comes right out. I can't find anything on eBay, was hoping someone here had some random parts lying around. Thanks!"
Gamecube,3ak7tz,boxcarjakey,10,Sun Jun 21 00:35:49 2015 UTC,I think your best bet is to just get a really crappy broken gamecube off of ebay and rip it out for this.
Gamecube,3ak7tz,linc25,2,Sun Jun 21 01:19:22 2015 UTC,I've got an old GameCube with the lid ripped off. (it's my childhood cube.. Can't throw it away!) Would taking out this part allow me to play it without the lid? If so I'll pull it out and send it to you!
Gamecube,3ak7tz,squaretwo,3,Sun Jun 21 04:55:13 2015 UTC,If you put a jumper on the outside pins of the plug that board connects to will allow you to play games without the lid. It will think the lid is always closed.
Gamecube,3ak7tz,oscillating000,5,Sun Jun 21 06:21:55 2015 UTC,"Just remember that this also means your GameCube won't be able to tell when you open the lid, which is sometimes necessary when switching discs (if you're using a GameShark/CodeBreaker unit, or playing RE4)."
Gamecube,3ak7tz,linc25,2,Sun Jun 21 09:07:12 2015 UTC,"I just may do this. OP, you want my part?"
Gamecube,3ak7tz,Markbro89,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:23:15 2015 UTC,I actually wanna try the jumper trick. I have no experience with that sort of thing though. Do you just buy jumpers? Or can I just use a paper clip or something?
Gamecube,3ak7tz,linc25,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:40:33 2015 UTC,I would assume you just need to splice the 2 blue wires together.
Gamecube,3akscg,AssdogDave0,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:17:28 2015 UTC,I can already play burned games. That isnt what i'm trying to ask. I'm trying to figure out how to make full sized dvds fit in the console.
Gamecube,3akscg,DarkChili,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:41:19 2015 UTC,"I have no idea if they still sell gamecube case mods, but I think you could do it by just removing the case. You need to do something to the sensor that detects if the lid is closed or not, but after that, let your naked gamecube play free!"
Gamecube,3akscg,DarkChili,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:48:16 2015 UTC,"Cool! I tried it and it did work. However, the dvds couldn't be read ( which i kind of expected) so i'm going to try the ""pot tweak"" that I keep hearing about. Do you anything about that/what I should set it to? I do know how to access it already, just not familiar with the full tweaking process."
Gamecube,3akscg,DarkChili,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:20:17 2015 UTC,"The ""pot tweak"" is just dialing in the disc laser's potentiometer to whatever resistance is best for the laser. Every Gamecube laser is different, you need to tweak so your cube can read your media and it might take a bit. Good luck."
Gamecube,3aco35,boxcarjakey,4,Fri Jun 19 00:59:39 2015 UTC,"Get a svideo Gamecube cable on ebay for $5, see how that works for you first."
Gamecube,3aco35,ArcadeGoon,3,Fri Jun 19 03:57:10 2015 UTC,Here is a pretty good video that shows the difference from Composite to S-video on gamecube and a myriad of other video outputs as well.
Gamecube,3aco35,Eliterubberduck,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:54:44 2015 UTC,"I can't say anything about whether some are worse than others, but any S-Video will make a big difference, even if the TV is small. Most importantly though, the cost is so low it's basically the same as any of the composite cables out there."
Gamecube,3aco35,metroidfan220,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:32:19 2015 UTC,"This thing is the best you can get through S-Video.  I prefer just investing the $80.00 that you could buying this cable on the official component cable, but that's just me."
Gamecube,3aco35,himanattsu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:22:41 2015 UTC,"I just went through the experience of converting my Gamecube, N64, and SNES cables to S-Video. I can speak from experience... you do not need to buy the Monster or even an official Nintendo cable, which are quite pricey at $60+. You can get generic, but DO NOT waste your time or money with any cable that has both composite (yellow) AND S-Video. The S-Video isn't the real deal, it just re-routes the composite signal to the S-Video connector, which will not only not give you the sharp S-Video image, but it can also create weird diagonal lines on some TVs. Instead, get a generic cable that ONLY has S-Video (and audio of course). They work perfectly. The bad generics (with both composite and ""S-Video"") are about $5 on eBay, the good generics (with true S-Video only) are about $15."
Gamecube,3aco35,electrickeyez,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:08:22 2015 UTC,"My video cable has both composite and S-Video - the S-Video signal is noticeably cleaner and sharper than composite is.  I can't refute what you saying being true sometimes, but it's definitely not always the case."
Gamecube,3aco35,PhotoJim99,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:10:09 2015 UTC,Perhaps it was just the one version of the cable I got then... :)

Gamecube,3aaoln,CaptainOrnithopter,2,Thu Jun 18 15:50:18 2015 UTC,"I can't find the link for the caps I use, but worse case scenario you can cannibalize the sticks from Wii nunchucks, they fit on there perfectly."
Gamecube,3aaoln,DarkChili,2,Thu Jun 18 17:37:19 2015 UTC,"I did this exactly to a controller I had with a broken left control stick - the Wii Nunchuk's analog stickbox fits perfectly and works exactly the same. Desolder the analog stick from the Nunchuk, desolder the old stick, and solder in the replacement. I find Nunchuks at Goodwill for $2 every so often, so I completely second this recommendation. You'd need a triwing screw driver to open up both controllers."
Gamecube,3aaoln,sirmirrork,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:25:02 2015 UTC,"Is soldering needed? I thought the sticks just sat in the controller (at least the GameCube controller) and that you could just pop in the new stick and take out the old one in seconds (after taking apart the controller, of course)."
Gamecube,3aaoln,DerekStu,2,Thu Jun 18 20:32:04 2015 UTC,"No soldering.  You need a triwing screwdriver, that's it."
Gamecube,3aaoln,sirmirrork,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:41:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, if you mean the plastic rubber piece on top, then no, no soldering needed. I had a broken electrical component. The Wii Nunchuk will work here again, too. Sorry for not fully reading your post."

It is hard plastic with a rubber thumb area, and it has the ""cutout"" which allows it full range of travel as it should have.  Mine came from ""Two Brothers Game Store.""  Hope this helps!"
Gamecube,3aaoln,DerekStu,2,Thu Jun 18 20:24:30 2015 UTC,"Also, I would be sure to buy from the same shop I did.  Several reviewers have complaints that did not match the products I received."

Gamecube,3a3llr,ArcadeGoon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:02:40 2015 UTC,The edges around the control stick that give a boundary to the control stick. Its octagonal.

Gamecube,39453t,ElvenHero,7,Tue Jun 9 03:11:20 2015 UTC,"I've done a few mods to cubes and controllers.  1) The PS3 analog doesn't quite fit onto the GC joystick. I ended up cutting the top off the thumbstick and apoxying it to the bottom cap of the GC analog  2) Poasca pens will work, but I would highly recommend using a clear coat afterwards to protect it.   3) Buttons can be sanded and painted, but be sure to mask off the sides before painting. Depending on how much you actually play, chances are the paint will just wear off.  4) The inside of the shell does not need to be sprayed.  5) I've used automotive and household spray cans. I like to use a sandable primer. Krylon makes a good plastic paint. And be sure to clear coat afterwards. When you're spraying,always remember, THING TO WIN  6) No idea. Google?

The soft rubber makes it almost impossible to paint over. Maybe if you could somehow dye rubber? I'm not sure.   All though I am working on a project right now. Ive taken the rubber cap off the control stick and replaced it with Sugru. So far I've had some really good results. It comes in many colours, and can be moulded into any shape.

Gamecube,39453t,LDSBL,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:52:22 2015 UTC,I can only answer one of these:     Yes. I've done this. Any generic 1st or 3rd party PS3 control stick fits the GameCube controllers. You just have to file a small indent into the control stick due to a small connector pin being in the path of its rotation. If you take apart the GameCube controller and look at the original control stick you can see where this indent needs to be made. Otherwise it works perfectly. I've done this with one of my controllers.   Good luck with the rest of your questions

Gamecube,38yvb7,Greenunjuh,6,Mon Jun 8 00:29:44 2015 UTC,I have three. If you want just the cube with no cables etc and don't mind it missing the GameCube plastic thing on the top you can have it. Just half the shipping for it with me and it's yours.
Gamecube,38yvb7,narse77,5,Mon Jun 8 02:23:38 2015 UTC,"You can get one from ebay for about $30 shipped. With a controller maybe $45. Here is a pretty good lot with 2 controllers: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Nintendo-Gamecube-System-Console-OEM-controller-Need-for-speed-memory-card-lot-/231586695305?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item35eba48889 for $43. I have seen gamecubes at my local Goodwill for $15 without a controller so if you want to pay less but have to wait a while for one to show up, try that or a pawn shop. Local retro stores will probably have them for about the same price as ebay.  The expensive part is the game. Melee now costs more than the whole console set. Probably will cost you at least $50. Here is one for $49: http://www.ebay.com/itm/RARE-Super-Smash-Bros-Melee-Nintendo-GameCube-2003-TESTED-WORKING-FREE-SHIP-/131531434973?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item1e9fe26bdd. So a total of $93 with the console above.  The cheapest of all options is to spend a few hours looking at a large flea market. Maybe get everything(console and game) for $60. Depends on whether you enjoy that sort of thing.  One warning. The gamecube looks horrible when you use the basic composite cables in a modern LCD hdtv. Slightly better is s-video cables which you can find on ebay. Slightly better than that is playing Melee on a Wii through component cables. The best is to buy a Gamecube component cable, but that costs more than $200 nowadays because of a special chip that does the digital to analog conversion in the actual cable."

One option other than selling it is to use it to play Gamecube games with their best quality. I recommend that :-)"

There was a mode that seemed to be specifically for use with games that had no perceivable lag issues to me., though the software provided with the Tuner was trash.  A better option is to use a converter box. That is why I say I used to use the Tuner- Now I use a ViewHD. the ViewHD takes HDMI, Component, and Composite  inputs and outputs to HDMI- si I connect all my consoles via the ViewHD, and plug in the HDMI cable. If  I want to play console games I switch my monitor to HDMI and use the ViewHD to select the input for the system I want to play."

However, be ready to pay a premium for the OEM ones.  There's also always the option of the component cable for your GameCube - if you manage to find one, be ready to pay out the ass; but I'm told it's worth it.  If all else fails, the A/V cables from you N64/SNES should work also, since I'm told they have the same connector."
Gamecube,38t0b4,kcchan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:42:39 2015 UTC,It's also missing the RF switch so there's no way to get it working. As others have mentioned it's not worth getting it to work with that adapter; you're much better off getting a composite or S-Video cable.

Gamecube,38od3s,AussieVGCollecter,2,Sat Jun 6 18:17:30 2015 UTC,"I have never heard of such a thing. Obviously a state is quite a bit different than a country. I am guessing each country in Europe has their own distribution channels, whereas America probably has one distribution channel. Making it more likely that either all of the US gets a game, or all of it doesn't. There are some games that come out in Japan and never come out in the US, like Doshin the Giant.

If you mean hardware wise, that may be another story. It's worth noting that this has never been done with a Wii either.  The Gameboy Player connected to the Gamecube via the Hi-Speed port, which is a parallel interface port. Neither the Wii nor the Wii U have this port, and presumably because they have no external ports, they may also lack the I/O controllers that those ports connect to. Otherwise it MIGHT be possible to actually create the port by connecting the appropiate Hi-speed port to the equivalent location on the new system, the problem is that you'll have to find what that ""equivalent location"" is."

In theory, I could work if you tracked down the High-Speed terminal and, as you said, reverse engineered it to see where exactly the Port goes/does. You'd then route a dummy terminal into the Wii U to the applicable points, but the Wii U has already come such a long way: I highly doubt the entirety of the right parts are even in there to be able to do it."

Gamecube,38jmxr,JinormusJ,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:09:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, I'll give you an update when they come in. I've been looking far and long for things like these"
Gamecube,38jmxr,JinormusJ,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:34:08 2015 UTC,"Also, make sure you don't mix and match gyro stick styles. If your controller has the plastic housing screw type gyro stick, it has a different pin setup and physical circuitry and is not comparable with the metal solder type gyro stick (and vice versa).  Ordering and installing the wrong part will cause the controller to read the direction inputs as either inverted (Up=Down/Right=Left) or tweaked (Up=Left/Down=Right/Left=Up/Right=Down). Just make sure you opened your controller and verified which style your gyros are; I just spent all of today rebuilding and resoldering like 7 controllers, play testing them, and swapping components as needed until all of them functioned perfectly"
Gamecube,38jmxr,JinormusJ,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:58:17 2015 UTC,"This is what I was talking about earlier  http://www.nesrepairshop.com/Catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=70_88&amp;products_id=1059  Unfortunately, it looks like they stopped stocking the OEM variants. Their non-OEM gyros don't look as good quality as OEM though IMO, but I still like the quality of the stick gyro itself, so take it with a grain of salt. They also only have solder-type sticks, and not the screw-type"
Gamecube,38iqld,MrSpicyOrange,2,Thu Jun 4 14:12:03 2015 UTC,"I would go for WASP and MEGAdrive over SDML. WASPs bought from badassconsoles are pre flashed with Swiss. Assuming you solder a normally closed switch on pin 29 for the MEGAdrive v3, you can keep updating Swiss. Simply put, since the WASP goes through the DVD drive port instead of the memory card port, the WASP will always read the games better than SDML. Since SDML goes through the memory card slot your going to get stutters every now and then, I notice it the most on Melee menus."
Gamecube,38iqld,c42p,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:43:00 2015 UTC,How's the audio on WASP in your experience? From the sounds of things I think I will go with WASP but I'm curious if going that route rather than SDML helps with any of the issues with games that use audio streaming.
Gamecube,38iqld,SwervinGirvin,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:26:34 2015 UTC,"Ok, so as far as the WASP and MEGAdrive I have no idea, I looked into the WASP chip and The XenoGC chip and decided that they both weren't worth my time or effort. So this is what I chose for my setup:    SD Media Launcher - No brainer, you'll need some kind of software to launch the .DOL files  2x SD Card - First card is an older class 2 card with nothing but the SWISS.DOL on it. Second card(s) can be whatever you desire but they have tested cards up to 128gb I believe, this is where you store your image files (.GCM .ISO).  SD Gecko or Something similar. This you will need to use so your cube can accept and read info from sources other than the optical drive, and more specifically from your SD card.    Ok so once you have all these prepared you are ready to start enjoying your cube disk free! Now to address your audio streaming issue (to the best of my ability), ok I've experienced hiccups and sound irregularities  in most of the games I've tried and tested, but if you are concerned about this, DONT BE. Yes it might take you out of the game for a moment, but as off SWISS rev 296 I've seen less audio stutter on games that had it bad (SSBM, SMS). And I can confirm that the hiccups I've experienced have only been apparent in FMV sequences, in game gameplay on all the games tested works flawlessly. Just thought I'd share my story to maybe help in your decision. I'd also like to mention that the SWISS program has a variety of booting options as well if you decide to do another Hard Mod to the system itself. Hope this helps!"
Gamecube,38iqld,SwervinGirvin,2,Thu Jun 4 16:29:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to give us the info, your setup sounds pretty cool. So, if the audio issues are getting better with each revision of SWISS, does that mean it could be fixed completely down the line? If so I'd probably get the WASP anyway, use it for what I can now and hope it becomes better in the future."

I know you can get dolphin to work with 360 controllers on gamecube games  IMO there's no better way to play GCN games than to use a Gamecube controller, Wavebird specifically. Mayflash makes a great adapter for $15 that lets you plug 4 GCN controllers in directly. It supports Wavebirds and also works on Wii U. It's a great investment."

They're substantially heavy for a comparatively small size, and few GameCube games support 16:9. I'd go for a 4:3. The best brand in my opinion is Sony, and not too many people would disagree.  The absolute best picture quality comes from a Sony PVM or BVM; these are professional-grade displays. The best budget option would be a Sony WEGA, a consumer-grade TV, for GameCube and Wii. These are oftentimes free or only priced around $40.   The biggest challenge is finding someone to help you move it. Last year I got a Sony KV-36XBR800 for free through Craigslist. It's a 4:3 36"" HD CRT beast that weighs 240 lbs and looks quite great when fed a component signal. XBR is Sony's top consumer line, so keep your eye out for one."

Lots of NES/SNES classics were released on gba, and most gb/gbc/gba carts (especially loose ones) are really, really inexpensive still.   GC titles are starting to appreciate a little in value (folks that grew up on the GC are getting out of college!), which can be annoying, but the GB stuff is still super reasonable.

There's also a bunch of bonus content, most of which is availible in the orignals, but it has an annoying system for getting them, you need to pay with badges you earn from playing. Good idea, but they mess it up by having one type of badge that you need to get from friends sending it to you. You can get around this by putting a save file from the internet onto an SD card, but it's annoying."

Gamecube,37np7u,LDSBL,3,Fri May 29 05:49:31 2015 UTC,...Recommend it if you like 3d sonic games.  That's like recommending Taco Bell if you like diarrhea.
Gamecube,37np7u,Nor_the_not_so_great,2,Fri May 29 06:33:35 2015 UTC,Maybe it's because I grew up with it. But I honestly love this game. When I replay it now I see all the problems with it but because of the Chao garden it's amazing.
Gamecube,37np7u,LDSBL,2,Fri May 29 06:38:33 2015 UTC,"As someone who didn't grow up with the game and tried playing it about 6 months ago, it really doesn't feel like a very good game at all. The stages where you hunt hunt for the emerald shards and where you're in those robot things are tedious and dull.   it's just not fun in my opinion. It's one of those games you'd recommend only to a true fan or to someone who played it as a kid.  Don't let me ruin how you feel about the game, though! I'm not trying to take that away from you."
Gamecube,37np7u,JustinKeenan,2,Fri May 29 07:36:32 2015 UTC,"That's fair enough. I don't think I could play it all the way through if I were to be introduced to it now. While the mechs stages were boring, I kinda liked most of the treasure hunting stages. It's a shame that SEGA never made a Sonic Adventure 3 with the best of all the other sonic games. Because it seems as though with each new 3D sonic game, there are some good things but overall it doesn't get much praise."

Secondly, the GameCube OS isn't complex enough to allow for soft-modding (modding that dosen't require additional/replacement hardware). This means you would have to use a mod chip.    You can however soft mod a Wii to load GameCube roms from a memory stick and you can plug the controller into the side.    TL:DR options are a) mod chip b) softmodded wii c) pay someone to mod your cube?"

Gamecube,378016,db_cooper__,2,Tue May 26 03:15:33 2015 UTC,Sell the GB Player(s). Without going into too much detail they're an imperfect emulation anyway and lag frames if you're really paying attention. A working GameBoy SP AGS-101 (not AGS-001) is about as good as a GBA game will look or play.

Gamecube,37478w,Texasbabymunch,3,Sun May 24 18:56:22 2015 UTC,Do you use a separate CRT for the GameCube or play on your normal HDTV?
Gamecube,37478w,Texasbabymunch,4,Sun May 24 19:30:31 2015 UTC,I play on a 1080p HDTV and it looks fantastic. I was playing Pikmin 1 last night and it looked great.
Gamecube,37478w,BCProgramming,6,Sun May 24 20:11:09 2015 UTC,"I've also read on this forum that a GC with component cables looks better than a Wii playing GC games with Wii component cables (much cheaper). Is this true? I'm thinking it must be, otherwise why would the cables hold their value?   Personally, I don't know if the Gamecube component looks better than the Wii. Even if it does, I doubt it is a significant difference. Obviously they are based on different tech, as the GC cable has it's own chip.  The reason I bought a Gamecube component cable myself- as opposed to say a Wii and the Wii Component cable, was because I could afford to do so, And because I wanted to use my gamecube to it's full potential.  As I understand it, the Wii U actually provides the best video for Gamecube games (via Nintendont), so it's likely a combination of factors like mine that drives people to want the GC component cable over the alternatives, which includes using the Wii U, the Wii, or even PC Emulation. For me, I just wanted to use the original console to it's full potential."
Gamecube,37478w,BCProgramming,0,Sun May 24 22:50:49 2015 UTC,"I agree there's something appealing about using the original hardware to the best of its abilities. Can I ask if you use an HDTV as well?  I've been looking at the Sony WEGA's (CRT's) for my GameCube and older consoles, but have also gone down a rabbit hole of Sony PVM and BVM monitors which seem to be the agreed upon best CRT's possible. All this stuff can become expensive very quickly though."
Gamecube,37478w,DerekStu,1 point,Sun May 24 23:44:02 2015 UTC,"I actually connect my consoles to my Computer Monitor. I use a ViewHD and connect my NES, SNES (Composite), Gamecube (Component) and Wii U (HDMI), and the ViewHD I have plugged into my Monitor's HDMI input.   I think the attachment to CRTs for older systems is mostly motivated by the idea that the ""proper"" way to play it is the same way we used to play it then. I've seen a few CRT setups in person where they were going for the ""best"" experience, and honestly I thought they looked awful and their only merit seemed to be looking closer to the crappy television sets that I/we used for those systems originally."
Gamecube,37478w,clarke41,2,Mon May 25 01:26:25 2015 UTC,They have a custom chip that hasn't been reverse engineered.  They will not likely drop in price until someone reverse engineers it.
Gamecube,37478w,Everkeen,8,Sun May 24 19:23:11 2015 UTC,"A few months back, some one did reverse engineer the chip, but they said they had no plans to make new cables. Weird, they could have made a lot of money."
Gamecube,37478w,SwervinGirvin,2,Sun May 24 19:30:16 2015 UTC,I'm thinking of buying one almost as an investment. I saw people talking about the cable costing $115 just two years ago.

Gamecube,37478w,psyduckyjuan,2,Sun May 24 22:39:50 2015 UTC,"Paid the cost, to be a boss. It's well worth it. But I've been you my friend. Sitting there wondering what display will be best. Here's my experience to hopefully save you the trouble? Ok! Here goes:  First setup (Good): Sony Trinitron KV-36 HS500, Gamecube hooked up via component cables TV set to Widescreen mode/toggled. Looks fantastic! Buuuuut, not as good as I was hoping. As the color was richer the texture difference was minimal on an HD CRT.   Second Setup (Best): Sony Playstation 24"" 3D display, Gamecube hooked up component. It was a big difference here as the color depth was there along with sharp lines and crisp text. The Display also has an overscan option so that can be toggled depending on preference. But by far this was a superior setup for component display in my mind just by being able to side by side and compare the two in real time.   If you do go the HD CRT route I'd recommend any Trinitron/WEGA that isn't in the FS (Fine Scan) family ESPECIALLY the 100-120 series. If you can find one in the XBR family I've heard they are primo but anything in the HS (High Scan) family should be adequate. Things to look for: 3D Digital Comb filter, True HD component ports, Lots of built in Ports to connect various systems. I'd make sure to do research before agreeing to anything and ask if you can test the set before purchase. Sorry if this was long winded but I just thought it was too specific to not share my personal story. Happy Hunting!   Link to my setup: http://imgur.com/TaPIHPq  Edit: link added"

Be sure the one you get comes with the disc, as the peripheral is useless without one. But this basically opens up your library possibility to about 2500 gameboy and gameboy advance games that you can play on your TV.  Four controllers + three friends. This makes the GC a beast of a console, as there are numerous games that go from good to outstanding in 4 player multi-player. Think titles like Mario Party, X-men Legends, and even the otherwise mediocre Gauntlet. Four player competitive / co-op is where it's at.  1,051 block memory card. Your mileage may vary on this one, as I have hundreds of games and make good use of mine. You could probably do with a much smaller one if you don't have many games.  If you're really gung-ho, four GBAs and link cables make for some crazy fun times with the Four Swords Zelda game. But this is quite the investment and hassle for a single title.

Honestly its really simple to swap parts in Gamecube controllers, they're designed in a way to be built easily in a factory so there shouldn't be too much confusion on how it goes back together.

Gamecube,36fyjy,jknox94,1 point,Tue May 19 02:13:14 2015 UTC,"What type of controller was it: official wired, wavebird, third party? The only thing I can think of, as the buttons can't really be switched (i.e. resoldiered) is that either a rubber grommet is somehow bunched up and is being moved just enough to register as a different button."

I was stunned to see the price of the controller! $3 was the difference between what I got and simply the controller itself. Considering I use a wavebird anyway, I decided to abandon having a matching set.  But between that and scoring a Hori mini pad for under $100 I'm fairly pumped mail day will be epic in a few weeks. And me too such a great game, but I'm a sucker for anything Gundam lol."

I suppose the same information would be relevant to PVM and modded RGB TV users in the US. I am not interested in 480p or component outputs, just analog RGB.  If I pick up a PAL Gamecube, with a mod chip to play my domestic games, can it output propper NTSC 15khz analog RGB?"

However if you wanted to try and recover/fix yours check out section 2.6 of this guide written by Kadano.  IMO you might as well buy one of those new Smash Bros gamecube controllers, they are ~25$-30$ new on Amazon which isn't a lot of money for a brand new controller.  Hope this helped :-)  edit: Sorry as to would it be easy, all you need is a 3$ triwing screwdriver (you can get this on amazon) and to follow that tutorial on cleaning the stick box.

I hadn't played anything in about a month and he had a buddy spend the night once in that time. He claims it must have been his friend but he's been known to steal, a lot, in the past. Previously it had been a car, firearms, money. All around piece of shit.   Since then he has apparently matured and ""apologized for all the messed up things he did"" but he just can't bring himself to admit he did it.   I haven't spoken to him besides a text or two since the incident."

It's not the fact he stole the games, it's the fact that you enjoyed that collection so much, he knew how much you enjoyed it, and he didn't give two fucks about taking it from you, or how long it would take you to rebuild it.  Consider getting counselling together if you want to move forward.  It's a very hard road to walk yourself."

Gamecube,34tm7w,Game_critic,2,Mon May 4 13:36:08 2015 UTC,"I distinctly remember playing that game for quite a while twelve odd years ago...  I was a big fan of the first Rogue Squadron , but still some details felt off : the lasers were like pellets, your teammates just crash landing somewhere and going ""I'm fine"" even in the middle of the Death Star, and then it was the PAL version so 50 hertz for me. The biggest surprise was that they included the Naboo Starfighter, that felt almost like DLC since the Phantom Menace hadn't come out at that point.  Anyway I still play that game from time to time, especially the last mission which recreates the bttle of Endor. That was such a blast all those Tie Fighters coming at you, it was difficult as well as they sometimes just crashed into you. I bought and completed Rebel Strike 5 odd years ago. The flight missions were good the on foot stuff not so much.   We should be getting a new batch of Star Wars games soon enough I guess, but Rogue Leader was just so polished and immersive."

Gamecube,34p7pd,lowcatzrock,1 point,Mon May 4 20:26:10 2015 UTC,"Here's a few games from my collection that I really dig:   Bloody Roar: Primal Fury - basically, an Animorphs fighting game.  It's not going to forever change the way you play video games, but it's still lots of fun, especially in multiplayer. Viewtiful Joe - a stylish action/platformer game.  You control a guy named Joe who gets pulled into a movie about his favorite superhero, Captain Blue.  Joe has to use his powers to fight past all kinds of baddies.  And did I mention that it's stylish?  Because this game is REALLY stylish. Crazy Taxi - if you want something with a nice amount of arcade ridiculousness, check this game out.  It's not much of a looker, but it's so much fun that the graphics don't matter.  Great way to chew up an hour or two. Custom Robo - if you like Gundam, Armored Core, action, customization, or some combination of those four things, you'll like Custom Robo.  You use tons of different parts to customize little toy robots, and then battle it out in arenas called ""Holosseums.""  It's got a nice combination of action, humor, and overall fun.  Plus, it's got multiplayer. Metal Arms: Glitch in the System - a multiplatform third-person shooter in which you control a little robot named Glitch who gets pulled into a war between two armies of robots.  The game's got some unpolished moments and framerate issues, but it's still enjoyable, and has some very funny writing and great voice acting. Battalion Wars - this title combines third-person shooting with RTS elements to create something that feels very unique.  Goofy and entertaining, and with good gameplay. Kirby: Air Ride - Nintendo's pink sphere decided to stop running around and rides around on crazy vehicles instead.  This game was made (if I remember right) by Masahiro Sakurai, the creator of the Smash Bros. games.  Fun multiplayer, and three modes to play.  ""Air Ride,"" a kinda normal racing mode, ""Top Ride,"" a top-down racingmode, and ""City Trial,"" in which players hunt around a large city for powerups before facing each other in a final battle. Soul Calibur 2 - a hugely enjoyable fighting game that focuses on different kinds of weapons, and techniques associated with those weapons.  Some of those weapons are a big sword, a staff, nunchuks, a medium-sized sword, a whip, and so on.  Plus, Link from The Legend of Zelda is in it. Star Fox: Assault - an explosive and exciting follow-up to the fantastic Star Fox 64.  Star Fox: Assault garnered criticism for its kinda clumsy controls, but even with them, this game is still very exciting, with tons of sci-fi action, great music, and (like tons of other games on this list) fun multiplayer."

I tried several different converters with the GameCube on my computer monitor, but they're honestly just a waste of time and money. The picture looked incredibly muddy and it was almost impossible to make text out. Waaay worse than the Cube already is hooked up to an HD TV with composite. Long story short, there's no great way to hook it up to your monitor."
Gamecube,34ney8,CommanderDogTags,0,Sun May 3 00:19:06 2015 UTC,"I was afraid as such. Though conversion can be technically possible doesn't mean it should necessarily be done. I only thought to ask because there are conversion boxes and they have good reviews. However, people also tend to review before fully testing (which is completely stupid as just because it's an intact bit of plastic doesn't mean it works). It just sucks because I'm under an even stricter budget than I was when I bought the monitor. It's great for new consoles, but I'm leaving my older ones to rot at any rate."
Gamecube,34ney8,BCProgramming,2,Sun May 3 02:40:12 2015 UTC,"I use a ViewHD for my SNES and NES with Composite/RCA cables. (I use it with my gamecube, but I have Component for that). It looks fine to me. Basically I connect all my systems to the ViewHD, then connect it to my monitor via HDMI."

Gamecube,34m7vp,Duggers,11,Sat May 2 13:13:07 2015 UTC,Many argue that resident evil 4 was the superior iteration for that generation.

Gamecube,34m7vp,Cuba_Libre_Jr,1 point,Sat May 2 15:52:18 2015 UTC,"You'll hear a lot of different opinions on The Twin Snakes. It takes some liberties with the original game - introducing gameplay mechanics from MGS2 without rebuilding the game around them and thus making the game easier, as well as making some of the cutscenes more action-y - which has turned some off. Honestly though, it's my personal favorite version of MGS1. The voice acting is more in line with the rest of the series, and honestly, the redone cutscenes match better with the later games anyway."
Gamecube,34m7vp,Lukar115,2,Sat May 2 18:20:49 2015 UTC,Totally with you on that. I found the Ps version somewhat unplayable after the twin snakes

Gamecube,34adod,SturgeonMcGuai,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:16:40 2015 UTC,"You might just need to clean the controller. Open it up, wash the shell, buttons, and both sticks with soap and warm water (just use your kitchen sink and watch out for dropping pieces down the other drain if you have one) and let them dry for about a day on a towel on your counter. You might have to shake/blow water out of the screw holes and inside of the buttons.  Use rubbing alcohol and cotton swabs to clean the controller's PCB, especially the button contacts. You can also re-lube the sticks if they're acting up.  If your controller has wire brackets that clip into the L/R buttons, they aren't necessary if you don't want them or they break/bend taking the controller apart. Make sure you line up L/R with their sliders when you put the controller back together (the triggers have both a sorely used analog function and a digital button that activates when they're fully depressed)."

Each with a Gameboy Player Adapter base thingy and 1 Gameboy Player CD to boot both Gamecubes up, plus each Gamecube with a Gamecube Controller on their respective's slot 1.  Now, I have a Wii setup with the GBA controller and TV, and 2 Gamecubes with their GC controller and Gameboy Player base and each with a TV. But how do I connect these 2 with the Wii?  IIRC, the Gameboy Link Cable has one side a GC plug and the GBA plug on the other. I understand the second and third Gameboy Link Cable's GC plug will be connected to the second and third GC plug on the Wii. But where would the GBA plug side be connected to? As far as I know, the Gameboy only takes a catridge in it, unless it has a plug for the GBA side of the Link Cable on its back or something? Can't seem to see it in pictures online."

Gamecube,3408bd,PrismHelix,0,Mon Apr 27 19:33:50 2015 UTC,Uh... but how is that advanced to playing it on a PC with e.g. 1080p or 4k?
Gamecube,3408bd,SwervinGirvin,7,Mon Apr 27 12:06:16 2015 UTC,Well it's not emulation.  Real carts.  Real hardware.   It's the most crisp native gamecube signal. To achieve anything higher you would have to emulate.
Gamecube,3408bd,BJ22CS,3,Mon Apr 27 12:21:29 2015 UTC,The actual gba player is $15. I would get an SD media loader in place of the disk and just put the file for the boot up disk on it.

If you just want to play your GameCube, a simple composite video cable (yellow/red/white) is all you need. It's the same one used for the N64 and Super Nintendo, they're extremely easy to come by.  If you want a slightly better picture, S-Video is a (small) step up."
Gamecube,33ylkb,PhotoJim99,1 point,Sun Apr 26 23:30:49 2015 UTC,"On the right display, S-Video is a significant step up, actually."
Gamecube,33ylkb,evertrooftop,2,Mon Apr 27 03:28:04 2015 UTC,"It's actually cheaper to buy a wii (which also plays gc titles) and buy the cable for that.  There's lots on this forum that will tell you that the GC is slightly better, but even if that were true (no proof as far I know?), the difference would be marginal and for most players the cheaper option is to just get the wii."
Gamecube,33ylkb,PhotoJim99,3,Mon Apr 27 00:50:20 2015 UTC,"The Wii's hardware can perfectly emulate the GameCube - the processor is the same as the GC's but faster; the video display hardware is the same - so the only potential issue is the incompatibility of some expansion hardware (e.g. GameBoy player, network interface).  The vast majority of GC titles don't need extra hardware and run perfectly and identically on the Wii.  Even some that require hardware (e.g. the GameBoy Advance cable) work fine on the Wii."
Gamecube,33uhbz,Luigimario280,5,Sat Apr 25 19:15:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, its most likely done to compress the scenes/events since most of them are videos, and video files using more pixels on a screen take up more space on the disk. Or else its because the cutscenes are only recorded in a widescreened letterbox format, in which case I think its both ways."
Gamecube,33uhbz,lowcatzrock,2,Sat Apr 25 19:28:38 2015 UTC,"I think it's like that for a variety of reasons, and I am sure that not every GameCube game does it.  One reason might be to differentiate gameplay from cinematics. You see letterboxes, you know you're in a cut scene and as such aren't expecting your controller input to affect what is happening on screen beyond maybe progressing text. When the letterbox fades away, you know you're in 'game' mode again.  As /u/lowcatsrock touched on, if you're talking about pre-rendered cut scenes, they will take up less storage on the disc if they are rendered and saved in that 16:9 ratio, rather than 4:3."

Gamecube,33uhbz,lowcatzrock,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:08:32 2015 UTC,I always thought it was done to make the scenes seem more cinematic. Never thought it was to save space.
Gamecube,33u5ug,TheSammy58,3,Sat Apr 25 17:38:44 2015 UTC,"You're correct that it's underscan. There's not much you can do if your TV doesn't overscan by default.

Having used S-Video on HD & SD it will always look better on SD CRT, but I didn't notice to much color wash/fade out or harsh blending on my HD set at the time a 42"" Sharp LCD. It was my gold standard until I learned of component output.   Any cable that supports S-video and has a Nintendo connector on it somewhere should be fine. You could go 1st or 3rd party but I'd recommend anything gold tipped to minimize interference.   Hope this helps!"

Composite is like the JPEG of video signals and has weird ghosting around things, especially text. This ghosting disappears with S-video.

Gamecube,33glok,Everkeen,3,Wed Apr 22 15:21:42 2015 UTC,So is this what is needed to play a GC on an LED TV or does it just provide a better picture on a CRT TV?

Gamecube,33glok,samishal,2,Wed Apr 22 16:42:40 2015 UTC,It will give you a better picture on any TV that supports YPbPr component. You don't need it to play on a more modern TV.
Gamecube,33glok,JinormusJ,3,Wed Apr 22 17:02:32 2015 UTC,"It does change the refresh rate, which is like a frame rate. Only 480 interlaced is available on composite and svideo. Component allows for 480 progressive scan mode. Which is true 60 frame a second."
Gamecube,33glok,somekindawizard1,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:45:01 2015 UTC,"I suppose, but the console is still putting out 60fps regardless of the cable. Interlaced frames are still frames."
Gamecube,33glok,JinormusJ,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:04:10 2015 UTC,Well an interlaced frame is missing half the picture though. For every progressive frame you need 2 interlaced frames.
Gamecube,33glok,Timestop-,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:23:52 2015 UTC,"But the frames still look choppy because you're only receiving half the image per frame.  TRUST MEEEE. I played on my GCN with and without progressive scan and it's a huge difference (Pretty much as drastic of a difference between 30fps vs 60fps)  While normal (interlaced) runs 60fps natively, it looks like crap compared to 60fps Progressive trough the component cable"
Gamecube,33glok,Timestop-,2,Wed Apr 22 18:06:05 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if this reduces input lag when playing games like Melee on an HDTV?
Gamecube,33glok,Mario-Smash,2,Wed Apr 22 18:12:48 2015 UTC,It should reduce lag as the TV no longer has to interpret a 480i signal and convert it to a higher resolution progressive signal and deinterlace it

Gamecube,337ae9,Bsharpmajorgeneral,5,Mon Apr 20 04:57:54 2015 UTC,"I always thought they made it compact in order to make toting it around easier (thus the reason for the handle). Most consoles are rectangles which means they have to be carried under the arm like a book - which of course carries the risk of dropping it. The handle and cube shape of the GC makes it more like a lunch box, making it much more mobile-friendly.  I also seem to remember reading something about Nintendo wanting to do everything to make the GC different from other home entertainment devices in people's living rooms. They wanted to set themselves apart and brand the GC as a pure gaming machine rather than just another box hooked up to the TV. The cube shape plays into this, but it's also the reason why they went with indigo as the launch color rather than black."
Gamecube,337ae9,CrinerBoyz,2,Mon Apr 20 07:19:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't get to tote my GC around as a kid, so I didn't think about that!  Which is funny, considering the NES was designed to do exactly that - fit in with the rest of the home entertainment devices!"

Secondly, I only recently learned (in the past few years), that Nintendo has tried to move ahead game-wise using antiquated hardware since the days of the NES. This focus seems to have worked for years, but since the Wii/360/PS3 era, I think a lot more people are concerned about hardware specs and the veil has been lifted on Nintendo's R&D business strategy."
Gamecube,337ae9,mrstevethompson,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:58:59 2015 UTC,"First, thanks!  Second, won't there be a point it doesn't matter? Graphic are almost there, certainly. Sure Nintendo might be a little behind, even going forward. But then the Wii U has games like Hyrule Warriors and Bayonetta.  Anyway, it's a moot point considering PCs will always be better. :P"
Gamecube,337ae9,mrstevethompson,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:14:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I love Nintendo and I just want to be able to see them succeed; I think that means having hardware that can run third party multi-platform releases. I don't consider myself a graphics whore, but I think it's commonly-accepted that the Wii U isn't on par with its ""peers.""  Actually, the gamecube was the last system they released that kept up in terms of being able to have multi-platform releases appear simultaneously as they were released on PS2 and the original xbox. Again, I only want what's best for Nintendo - I know their focus is a different demographic these days, but I think having competitive hardware would certainly allow them to have more success with the Wii U and future systems.  Just my two cents. :)"

On a positive note, they are definitely killing it in the handheld world."

Gamecube,337ae9,pathartl,1 point,Wed Apr 22 05:52:58 2015 UTC,"Really the handle thing was pretty much for some of the attachments. There are screens that you can buy toplay a gamecube on a plane and it attaches to the handle, And i really didnt question the cube design, Its kinda those bold choices nintendo make when modeling their consoles, if you see a cube shaped console you go ""thats a gamecube"" And when you see the unique shape of the n64 you know what it is. Nintendo always had unique console designs, and when you see something thats in those shapes you just know its nintendo.  I just said its a cube for the reason being its just a cube."
Gamecube,337ae9,Shad0wF0x,0,Sat Apr 25 19:36:32 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, it didn't really solve any questions. A lot of the ""research"" you did was just looking at things about the system that was pretty widely known. The copy protection on the Gamecube was basically two fold. The first was the BCA on the disc which is sort of an electronic key that tells the system it is a legitimate disc. The second is simple security via obscurity. At the time mini-DVD's were more expensive and harder to come by. I suspect another reason the mini-DVD format was used was so that it couldn't play DVD's for the same reason the Wii couldn't play DVD's (even though homebrew could allow it on both systems). Optical media is fragile. So is the hardware that reads it. Optical disc hardware has a relatively short lifespan. Couple this with corners cut to save money and you have hardware that's not meant for constant abuse.  Every optical system has seen this. Lasers, lenses, etc they burn out. Now moving onto the hardware. The Gamecube was built on PowerPC. A type of CPU architecture that has been used for so many years, so they did a good job of shrinking it down a bit. (Honestly even the Xbox was built using a similar CPU to the Intel PIII and they probably could have shrunk it down a lot if they made the PSU external and didn't use standard computer-format hardware). In all honesty without asking the original hardware designers, I would boil it down to they found out that making the optical drive pretty thick with no tray (unlike its competitors) was cheaper and it was an easy way to do Nintendo's gimmick. That is introducing something about the system that's different than the competitors that doesn't come down to POWAH. The cube let them target a different fanbase by being cutesy. It had a handle built into the console with four controller ports. The controllers themselves had an easy way to wrap cables. You could take this thing to your friend's house and it wouldn't feel like a chore. They realized what market they hit with the N64 and wanted to keep those people on board. That's probably also why we got a huge amount of Mario and multiplayer games on the system.  I guess my response has a sort of negative tone to it. It's not really meant to be like that. The Gamecube was a great system and it had some top games, but the design itself I believe was purely for Nintendo's creativity. We saw it with the NES being shaped like a VCR or the Wii taking on motion controls the best it could."

Gamecube,332nx6,SCHMITTAY,3,Sun Apr 19 20:06:12 2015 UTC,"There are two parts to your disc-read issue:   Part 1) Though a GameCube's lifetime, the laser will naturally weaken in intensity. As the laser weakens, it becomes more difficult for it to read various discs. This is perfectly normal, and serves to extend the life of the laser. If you want to, you can open up your GameCube and adjust the potentiometer to increase the intensity of the laser again, but this could significantly lower the life expectancy of your cube.   Part 2) CDs. DVDs, and any other form of optical media will naturally have some optical flaws in the disc that will make it a little more difficult to read. These may come in the form of scratches or factory defects where one part of the disk is slightly thicker or thinner than the rest. Bending the disc or leaving it exposed to sunlight could also cause micro-defects. These little defects are perfectly normal, and usually are not a problem, as long as you have a healthy optical reader with a nice, strong laser to read the slightly defected discs.   The cheapest fix for your GameCube (if you have the tools) is to open it up with a game-bit and tweak the Potentiometer. This will require you to buy a game bit screwdriver (less than $5), and have a multimeter on hand that can measure resistance.  The next cheapest fix is to just buy a new system. There are plenty of used systems out there that work just fine. (about $15-$20)  The most expensive fix would be to buy a new SSBM disc and hope that that one works. (easily more than $45)"
Gamecube,332nx6,Hangry_Hippo,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:12:52 2015 UTC,Couldn't you also open your cube and replace the laser without messing with the potentiometer?  Or would that not fix a disk read error?
Gamecube,332nx6,SCHMITTAY,2,Mon Apr 20 00:27:38 2015 UTC,"You could replace the laser as well, but that is a significant amount of extra work, and you would have to adjust the potentiometer for the new laser anyways."
Gamecube,332nx6,SCHMITTAY,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:48:49 2015 UTC,okay i might try to strengthen it when i have more time. Could I try to find a way to clean the disc better so it can read it or does it not matter?
Gamecube,332nx6,ValiantPixel,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:01:31 2015 UTC,"Well, if the disc has any scratches you should polish it. If you can find a video store or retro game shop in your area, they often have disc polishing machines in store that you could pay a couple bucks to have your disc repaired.   If there are no scratches, you can make a habit of cleaning the disc with a lint free microfiber cloth and glasses cleaning spray."

Gamecube,333a2c,MotherFan,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:26:01 2015 UTC,"A wind waker Fan Film I guess you could call it. There are so many different ways I could explain it.  Wind Waker Voice Acted  Wind Waker Abridged  Wind Waker Fan Film  Hero of Winds originally started with the idea of ""What if people were voiced WELL in a Zelda game""  Being a life long fan of the series I've always wanted to explore the depth of the stories. Wind Waker was one of the first 3D zelda games that braught some depth to their characters.  The Hero of Winds is going to be an episodic TV styled series telling the tale of Link, the hero of winds, and his journey across the great sea. It will incorporate original story elements along with staying true to the game's story line. Each character will be voiced, and main characters such as Tetra/The King of Red Lions for example, will be given more depth to their characters and story. Really telling the tale of the old king of Hyrule and how it came to ruin so long ago."

Otherwise, if you still plan on using the controller, I'd advise against painting them because the paint doesn't take long to wear off along the side from friction with the shell."
Gamecube,32vdcm,cubemaster21,4,Fri Apr 17 01:03:53 2015 UTC,Can't you just buy coloured buttons?
Gamecube,32vdcm,ArcadeGoon,3,Fri Apr 17 02:08:18 2015 UTC,"Like cubemaster said, if you're gonna use the controller I suggest you do not paint the buttons. If it's just for display, color it however you want. Except watercolors, that might not turn out so well."
Gamecube,32vdcm,slinkman05,3,Fri Apr 17 05:33:12 2015 UTC,"r/customcontrollers is a good place to ask.  I tried painting mine, and what i learned is using very fine sand paper, and sand the hell out of the buttons before you spray paint them.  Use spray paint. And do it as you would anything else.

Gamecube,32vdcm,simonthm,2,Fri Apr 17 13:56:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe you can take the controller apart, then paint each button and the body then wait for them to dry, then put it back together.

Gamecube,32s4w4,SturgeonMcGuai,4,Thu Apr 16 22:16:07 2015 UTC,They were already rare to begin with when they were new (only available through mail/phone order through Nintendo directly) and they didn't make a lot. They were impossible to replicate because of the special Digital/Anolog converter chip inside the cable  Combine that with an increase in demand  Boom  Basic economics
Gamecube,32s4w4,crammond94,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:27:45 2015 UTC,"No third-parties knew how to make these back in the day and not many people used component TVs in the early 2000s, making this a somewhat uncommon item. Now that we know how to make them, the market still isn't there, so no one makes them. The SSBM community keeps growing though, so that might change."
Gamecube,32s4w4,essoair,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:32:14 2015 UTC,"They also are not as easy to reproduce as other cables. The cable contains a digital-to-analog video converter, instead of hosting it inside the system itself, which would be an added cost to making the cables. Also the input used for the cable is by no means a standard."

It's super old but still stands today.  http://m.ign.com/articles/2001/11/08/how-to-modify-your-gamecube  It's a very easy solder job; the hardest part is probably opening the GameCube correctly (without breaking anything) and locating the R6 terminal. I have pictures of the teardown, and I was trying to take pictures of the finished product, but the board is so small my camera didn't want to focus. Took me maybe 30 minutes tops otherwise. ; I give it a 3/10 on the DIY-difficulty scale  Protip: glob some tin onto the soldering iron first (have a nice little drop forming) and turn the soldering iron to around 400° (I was at 750° which was max for mine and it was melting the tin off the terminals too quick). The terminal is super small so it's hard to solder directly. Just keep dipping the solder over both pins until some sticks"

Internal swapping will take you the better part of 2-3 hours; jumping the resistor can be done in 30 minutes"

It had a five years as the flagship for Nintendo before the Wii came out, but we're now--including handhelds--like ten consoles removed from the Gamecube?  Third party support and new games are long gone. The only new stuff coming out for the Gamecube are enhancements to mods and emulators, which I personally feel is a better topic for an emulation subreddit rather than the console's dedicated sub.

I know Nintendo consoles are historically bad with RPGs, but the Gamecube and GBA together had a whole bunch of great ones.  You know, looking at this list almost two weeks later, there's probably even more games I could add. The Gamecube is definitely Nintendo's best system - it didn't have the lack of variety or small amount of publishers that the NES had, the bizarre and irritating game design of the SNES, it was much deeper than the N64, and it had more third-party support and power than the Wii. Just everything about it was so great. You're lucky you have a backwards-compatible Wii."
Gamecube,32la8f,mrhotdog1011,2,Tue Apr 14 18:20:54 2015 UTC,"Well.. I've answered this question a lot on here haha. Let me see if I can grab my mini tutorial on how I paint my cubes.  EDIT: Found it! I've again revised it since I'm also revising my technique :P  Here's my process for painting my GameCube consoles and controllers: NOTE: I'll say this now since it'll get lost in the text. I only sand before I start painting, and when I find specks of dust/trash/etc that lands on a coat while it's being painted or drying. I use 1000 grit for the primer, the base, and the main color. 1500 or 2000 for the clear coat. You don't have to sand every time, you only need to sand if before you start, the gamecube has some dings/scratches. And while you're waiting for it to dry, inspect the paint if it has a bit of texture/dust on it. Like I said before, I'm more of a visual explainer than a verbal one.   Before you start, you must completely disassemble, clean, and sand the console/controller. I use between 600-1000 grit when sanding. I just scuff it up so the primer can adhere to the cube better. After sanding, clean it one more time, let it dry, and it's ready to be painted. 2 coats of Primer, both are medium coats. In the past, I've used XIM 400 White primer, I typically wait a day or two for it to dry so it can adhere properly (It's worth the wait because the bond will become very strong). This is what I use, it's pretty expensive though: https://go.o-geepaint.com/products/spray-xim-white-primer-sealer%7CXI30081.html I normally get it from my local paint store, it costs around 10 there. Sometimes if they're out of stock, it can be upwards of 20 at other stores. Recently however I've been meaning to experiment with the Duplicolor Adhesion Promoter, I've heard this is a bit better since it's made for adhering to plastics. NOTE: IGNORE THIS IF YOU'RE USING A PAINT THAT IS A PAINT+PRIMER COMBO SUCH AS http://www.lowes.com/pd_416282-4-410.0086011.076_0__?Ntt=orange+maple+gloss&UserSearch=orange+maple+gloss&productId=4138893&rpp=32 2-3 coats of the base color, IF the base coat I want isn't white. Typically wait about an hour between coats. I normally use the .99 cent black or gray MATTE spray paint at Walmart. I use matte because gloss is a PAIN to paint over. Once you add the last coat, let it heal for 24 hours. NOTE: IGNORE THIS IF YOU'RE USING A PAINT THAT IS A PAINT+PRIMER COMBO SUCH AS http://www.lowes.com/pd_416282-4-410.0086011.076_0__?Ntt=orange+maple+gloss&UserSearch=orange+maple+gloss&productId=4138893&rpp=32 2-4 coats of the main color. I normally get my paint from Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, or Autozone (if I want to paint with metallic since automotive paint is very durable). Again, about an hour between coats. The first coat is a light coat, with the coats gradually get more dense. But not too dense where the paint starts to run. Try and use either Krylon or Rustoleum paint. Not like you won't find it wherever you go because they're typically the go-to spray paint. Once you add the last coat, let it heal for 24 hours. Of course, you can save some time and use the Paint+Primer spray paint. I won't cover this yet in this tutorial since I haven't experimented with it yet. I've also experimented with the Duplicolor Perfect Match series can sold in auto parts stores. The can is a lot smaller then your standard can, but the paint comes out beautiful since most of the colors come in a metallic finish.  Finally, 4-8 coats of clear coat enamel. I normally do 4 coats if I'm using a gloss enamel, 4-6 if I'm doing a controller. Or 4-8 coats if I'm using matte. An hour between coats is best and about medium coats throughout. Be careful with using matte clear coat, you have to look carefully to see if you're spraying evenly, because it's very easy for the paint to not be distributed evenly. Here's my choice for gloss:http://www.rustoleum.com/product-catalog/consumer-brands/stops-rust/crystal-clear-enamel/ And I'm still experimenting with matte clear, but here's my current go-to pick: http://www.rustoleum.com/product-catalog/consumer-brands/painters-touch-ultra-cover-2x/clear Another great matte clear coat is the Mod Podge Clear Acrylic Aerosol Sealer 12oz-Matte from Wal-mart.  Right after adding the clear coat, let the pieces sit, wherever you're sitting them, for about a few days to a week so the clear coat and heal properly. This is where painting is tough for some because they'll assemble the console after the hour has passed. I've done that from time, and I'll normally mess it up somehow because the paint has only healed for about an hour. If everything was done correctly, it is possible that everything can be reassembled after about 8 hours. But I wouldn't risk it, since this only happened to me once when I painted a wavebird."

Gamecube,32ltus,BCProgramming,4,Tue Apr 14 20:54:03 2015 UTC,Its basically what ^ this guy said. If someone only sees some idiot is posting blank on eBay at say $60 and someone comes along and buys it at that price but really overpaid. Someone else will see that someone paid up to $60 and puts their game up for sale at $60 and it sells etc
Gamecube,32ltus,Destroyer_Wes,4,Tue Apr 14 21:53:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly I can't understand why it's jumped in value so much recently. I would image the competitive scene gamers already have it, and for actually playability, Smash 4 is right up there and a better value in my opinion. And it's not like Melee is rare... I've found 4 copies myself last year through thrifting and garage sales."
Gamecube,32ltus,Shredda,4,Tue Apr 14 21:30:41 2015 UTC,"Most people in the competitive scene already have it but also in the past two years the Melee scene has been getting bigger and bigger, creating more demand from people who may have sold the game or never even owned it before."
Gamecube,32ltus,c42p,3,Tue Apr 14 23:39:18 2015 UTC,"Melee is an extremely high-demand game right now thanks (not entirely but mostly) to a very well done documentary by Samox and East Point Pictures called The Smash Brothers (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgWH-qXpv8) released in late 2013. Earlier in 2013, the Melee/Smash community raised nearly $100,000 for breast cancer research and won a spot at Evo, the largest fighting game tournament series in the world.  If that wasn't enough, Melee garnered even more attention when Nintendo issued a cease and desist on Evo streaming any footage of the game, an action that caused so much backlash that Nintendo had to retract the order.  Melee has since gone from 300-person tournaments with around 15,000 stream viewers to 1000-person tournaments with around 100,000 stream viewers.  All of this has led major esports organizations like Cloud9, Alliance, TSM, Evil Geniuses, etc. to sponsor a Melee representative for their team.  Competitive Melee is now larger than it has even been, even after 14 years, and still regularly outnumbers Smash 4 entrants in tournaments.  All of that plus the general rise in popularity for retro video games over the past few years is why Melee is a $60 game."
Gamecube,32ltus,tpop_loop,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:30:00 2015 UTC,"If you have a Gamecube, or a capable Wii, and you enjoy the series at all it should be in your collection. Is it worth that much? That's for the buyer to decide. It's one of the best selling games on the GC, so it's not exactly rare.  I bought my second GC off of CL in like '07 or '08 with one controller, one memory card, Mario Party 7 (loose) and Smash Brothers complete for $75. At the time I was worried I overpaid. So, yeah, $60 seems high to me. It is a good game, though."

Gamecube,32mes6,_observatory,4,Tue Apr 14 23:23:02 2015 UTC,"The GameCube version runs at a much better frame rate, has better graphics, and has MASSIVELY better loading times. It's the definitive version of the game. The game was originally part of the ""Capcom 5"" and was meant to be a GameCube exclusive like the other games. Hence the game was developed with GC hardware in mind and the PS2 version was basically an extremely lazy and shit port with no differences between the games content wise. I do not recommend getting the PS2 version at all. There's nothing good about the PS2 version. It doesn't even have extra content like the Viewtiful Joe and the Resident Evil 4 ports (despite the lack of extra content the GC versions of the those games are also arguably better.) It's just a bad port with a ton of technical problems because Capcom didn't even bother to properly optimize the game for PS2.  It's totally worth paying a little extra for the GC version of the game. I recently finished the game for myself the first time and I'm working on my second playthrough right now. The story line is mind blowing, and no other game comes close to the uniqueness I experienced playing it. Look at gameplay videos though, the gameplay is not for everyone. This game focuses much more on story, graphics, atmosphere, than it does on gameplay."

Gamecube,32mes6,real-dreamer,2,Wed Apr 15 00:55:57 2015 UTC,"Weird ass on rail shooter.  You move around the maps and solves puzzle in third person just like in any other games, but you don't walk with the joystick. You just hold A to run, and you press a direction when there's a door or an intersection.  It's really weird. Before I played it, I looked at videos online and had no idea what the hell was even going on. It makes more sense once you wrap your head around it.  Then there's the shooty part. When you hear evil laughs, it means enemies are around. They're invincible, so you have to hold a button to go into first person mode, scan the room, and reveal the enemies. Then you shoot at them, and they give you more blood (health and EXP) when you hit their weak points.  Finally there's the whole strange storyline and the multiple personas of the main character, but I won't go into that."
Gamecube,32mes6,crashdummie,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:32:28 2015 UTC,"It is very unique overall. I completed it 5 years ago or so, as I always wanted to try it out, so my memory of it is quite foggy.

I would give you specific details but I feel it's an overall package of weirdness that is worth discovering from scrap.

Gamecube,329dhh,tpop_loop,9,Sat Apr 11 19:39:15 2015 UTC,"I was fortunate to play the original first as a kid; I prefer the original in terms of story and overall atmosphere, but I much more prefer the gameplay of 2 in terms of refinement.  While 2 had a much less story driven acquisition of treasures (something I heavily enjoyed about the first one), I loved how a lot of the end-game Holes reflected the gameplay and atmosphere of the original. In the original, I'd always take a few moments to plan my strategy and scout with Olimar alone, and often had to face some pretty tough foes. In the Pikmin 2 dungeons, every time I reached a new level, I was forced to carve out a little refuge for my tribe of Pikmin and venture out alone with Olimar to scout, the best part being that the end-game holes were very different than what you have encountered up to that point and often very challenging. By scouting, just as I had in the original, I would see what potential threats and dangers there were and pick a small batch of Pikmin accordingly; still heavily strategy based, but just with different contexts now. This is why the sequel is so good: the core gameplay is virtually unchanged (only refined by better controls), even though some of the mechanics have changed. You still had some sense of urgency with the President breathing down your neck, but I can see what you mean how Pikmin was more drastic than the 2nd (30 days til you die vs 30 days til the company goes under - I know you have infinite days in the second, just making a point)  Pikmin was great and to the point: it showed the beautiful creative potential of Nintendo-ingenuity for a new IP; it is brilliant in its own right and I love the game for that. 2 took most of which was great about the 1 and expanded the horizon: there was just simply more to do. Both games are amazing, and; even though I played the first first, I have to say I much rather prefer the second if I thought critically about it. However, I can say for a fact that I wouldn't have appreciated the Pikmin 2 so much if I had not played the original first. This is why I can't wait to pick up a Wii U and play the 3rd; Pikmin is one of my all-time favorite franchises and I'm glad it got more attention  Also, r/gamesale has people willing to sell Pikmin 3 for $40-50 shipped from what I've seen"

IMO, I thought the dungeons were a pleasant add on  Not like I'm saying ones better than the other; Pikmin is the better experience, Pikmin 2 has better gameplay, but they're both amazing games"
Gamecube,329dhh,JinormusJ,3,Sun Apr 12 01:14:48 2015 UTC,"I think the first one is a little better after having played the second one recently.

If you do use one of these (they can be found on eBay for ~$3 each) you'll have to file a tiny dint into the bottom of it. If you look at your GameCube control sticks you'll see a small dint in them to avoid hitting a connection on the circuit board of the controller.

Gamecube,321g4e,Mario-Smash,6,Thu Apr 9 20:28:39 2015 UTC,"Gameplay is exactly the same; same controller, same controls, etc. Gamecube games are played in ""GameCube Mode"" on the Wii which shuts down all unneeded Wii hardware for running the console; meaning wii hardware/controllers won't work with GameCube games  Visually its a whole different story. I just realized this while playing through Metroid Prime 2 the other day on my GCN Composite and then swapping to my Wii with Component:  The GameCube most commonly displays natively through the composite (Rd/Wh/Yl) cable. On an HDTV the visuals and textures are more apparently displayed meaning you can now actually notice the muddy textures, muggy shadows, and blurred edges that were once hidden with a SDTV. The next step up would be S-Video that splits the video inputs and offers a clearer picture, but it is still displayed in 480i. The best picture you could hope to get out of the Gamecube on an HDTV would be from the Component cables (Rd/Bl/Gr); they further split the image and display in 480p and 60fps (progressive scan) and essentially doubles the pixel density and framerate of the 480i display, giving you a crystal clear HD Gamecube Setup  The Wii also came with Composite cables and S-Video, but most commonly were found (at least new) with Component cables and also displays at 480p progressive scan. However, the graphical fidelity of the GameCube using its Component cables give a slight advantage over the Wii playing Gamecube games through its composite cable. The GameCube displays obscure textures and shades that would have otherwise had been washed out on a Wii. And you won't get the pleasure of seeing the awesome GameCube start up of course  That being said; if you are unable or unwilling to drop money for GCN Component cables ($200+), a Wii with component cables is the second best thing."
Gamecube,321g4e,JinormusJ,2,Thu Apr 9 21:41:50 2015 UTC,use a crt with component inputs for best results
Gamecube,321g4e,Andy_Lisinski,2,Fri Apr 10 06:58:54 2015 UTC,"CRT has no input lag, so for extremely technical games like SSBM, yes, but for others; I personally don't think it matters that much: the bigger the TV, the better"
Gamecube,321g4e,JinormusJ,4,Fri Apr 10 07:51:09 2015 UTC,"People tend to underestimate the benefits of CRTs. If the majority of your gaming is done on non-HD consoles (Gamecube, Wii, PS2, etc) then a CRT is absolutely the way to go.   There's no muddy upscaled visuals, no input lag, and colors/blacks are more accurately reproduced than on modern TVs. Here's a convenient chart comparing the advantages CRTs have to LCDs."

Gamecube,321g4e,patrickpf,1 point,Fri Apr 10 06:19:07 2015 UTC,"There isint much difference between playing actual games on the system, more or less how you use the system. Assuming the Wii is unmodded, you have to use the sensor bar and Wii remote to start games, which seems kind of annoying in most cases considering the Wii remote uses batteries that occasionally run out and you have to worry about having a sensor bar and remote if you bring the Wii somewhere else. Meanwhile on Gamecube all you have to do is press the power button, no menus necessary. However, if you care about video quality, component cables for Gamecube are anywhere from $150-$200 while component cables for Wii are like $5. Gamecube is easier to run and use while the Wii has much more things to expand on cheaply like component video and homebrew."

TTYD is a very unique title in the Mario series and spinoffs. Great comedic writing, one of the best soundtracks, clever puzzles and fun combat mechanics, with a hint of feels every chapter. When you do get a chance to play it, come over to /r/PaperMario and share your experience!"

Gamecube,31wmwu,Mario-Smash,6,Wed Apr 8 19:02:49 2015 UTC,The best way to store any cables is to coil it with it's natural curve. 35 seconds into this video shows it better than I can explain it  How to Wrap Your Short Cable and How to Store Your Coil Cable Properly: https://youtu.be/0pZeO9DwWaU
Gamecube,31wmwu,RXRob,3,Wed Apr 8 22:13:24 2015 UTC,After a while it can break the wire and make it so you have to hold it down in a certain position. I would avoid wrapping it like that
Gamecube,31wmwu,PrismHelix,2,Wed Apr 8 19:11:05 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. Our first gamecube platinum controller broke the black shielding and now wires are hanging out; if you move your position while playing, it does weird things: jumps for you, pauses without hitting start, cancels targeting/R-Lock, etc. it also developed weird bumps/coils in the shielding.  We bought a new platinum controller to replace it and transferred the skin over because of sentimental value. We're probably going to cut the other controller at the break and re-solder the cable to the board. It'll be about a 1'6"" shorter, but it'll work."
Gamecube,31wmwu,JinormusJ,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:13:04 2015 UTC,"I imagine you are referring to wrapping the cord around the controller such that it wraps within the ""opening""  between the D-Pad and C-Stick portions of the controller?  I don't see it as any different than wrapping the cord around other controllers. The GC NES, SNES, etc controllers have stress relief within the shell. However I think the 'preferred' approach is to wrap the cord separately.  I certainly wouldn't expect it to exclusively only affect the rumble feature."

Gamecube,31spyg,JinormusJ,3,Tue Apr 7 21:35:57 2015 UTC,"The component and D-terminal cables send the same signal (YPbPr 480p). You can usually find the D-terminal cables for less than component, so I'd go with that."

HDTVs in the modern era no longer have S-Video hookups; I was just wondering because I didn't want to pick up the D-Terminal cable (instead of the component cables) and have it become useless if I buy a new (bigger) TV (that doesn't have a D-Terminal)  Or vice versa"
Gamecube,31spyg,squaretwo,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:27:15 2015 UTC,"If you get a D-terminal to component adapter, you'll be fine. HDMI has effectively made d-terminal obsolete, but many new Japanese TVs still use it."

If a cable produced in Japan would work on a NTSC American GCN? (I'm assuming it would work)  I'm about to jump on a cable but it is coming from Japan and has a Japanese box so you can never be too sure
Gamecube,31spyg,badwolf422,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:04:37 2015 UTC,A Japanese cable will work on an American cube. I went with a D-terminal cable with that adapter because it was $50-60 cheaper than a component cable. Shipping from Japan takes forever though.

Phantasy Star Online Ep 1&2 is an RPG in that depending on the character type you choose, you can use different weapons and get different stats at level-ups. You can't choose what levels you get though. Every Ranger at lvl 100 will have the same base stats. It is a great game though. Still has online capabilities if you can get your hands on a broadband adapter!"

Gamecube,31made,IDontMindTurtles,3,Mon Apr 6 11:51:04 2015 UTC,"My setup at home: http://imgur.com/gallery/BX76N  Thought I might give a summary of why I chose GameCube to be my one collection.  Reasons why I got in:   Plenty of fun four player games which require little to no experience in order to play. The games that bring people together still rely on skill, and aren't karaoke/rhythm/quiz based. System is very portable. Very easy to carry around and is built like a rock. reliable wireless controllers. Wavebird is beautiful. I am not sure if it's something people argue over as technically it is third party, but it's the most comfortable controller I have ever used. Game library has limited shovelware. The end of the quality control era for Nintendo. Game library is VERY affordable in comparison to older Nintendo stuff. Controller button placement just makes the games more fun. It hard to take the games as seriously with a big green button, a little red one, and a yellow thumbstick. Best exclusive list of the generation. Best charactes of the generation. There's something about the Mario universe that no other company comes close to. price has bottomed out, and it's going to be that way for a couple of years until it rises. Plenty of time to get the big dollar titles before they become even bigger.   What am I missing? If I am not enjoying things I should be, I need to know!"
Gamecube,31made,miniboss1487,3,Mon Apr 6 11:59:14 2015 UTC,"Good stuff. I think it's funny how you are saying the games are cheap (they are) and there's a thread on this sub where someone is whining that games basically don't cost the $5-10 that modern games devalue to now. Collecting for N64 and SNES is painful compared to GameCube, and the gen 6 games have aged much better than the former. I couldn't agree more with a lot of your points.   One thing, the WaveBird was actually designed by Nintendo. It's about as first party as it comes when it comes to controllers.  Also I would argue that this console has the most shovel ware ever for a Nintendo console other than the Wii. Gen 6 was when multiplatform, rushed releases by big publishers like EA and Activision started to become the norm. Before this gen you could argue that other than sports titles and fighting games, multiplatform releases were few and far between. The SNES and Genesis had two completely different versions of Aladdin because the hardware between them was so different.   For games I would suggest Prime since you have Prime 2, and there are few other first party games worth getting. Viewtiful Joe is best on GameCube, and I would even argue that Resident Evil 1 one GameCube is in some ways better than the HD port (the soundtrack comes to mind)."
Gamecube,31mzzh,Mario-Smash,5,Mon Apr 6 15:53:40 2015 UTC,"I just played and beat Luigi's mansion for the first time last week. I enjoyed the game from start to finish.  Controls are great, graphics are great and the sound/music are amazing. Luigi humming the main theme to himself as you go around is great.  The game gets a lot of critism for its length but I think it was just right. It ended before it got stale or i got bored.  I finished with all 50 ghosts and a C ranking on my first play through."
Gamecube,31mzzh,Socksfelloff,3,Tue Apr 7 14:05:17 2015 UTC,"It was a pretty good launch title at the time. It's not the best game on the system but it did a good job of showing off the potential of consoles graphics with the great lighting effects, and innovative gameplay with the dual analog controls. I love it because it's one of those games that has a ton of hidden depth. You can unlock a whole other version of the mansion, and the game keeps tracks of your high scores. It's basically a great game to speed run now."

My collection a good 60% or so was bought when it was available at retail with the rest coming in after I graduated from college and got more into collecting (2010). I've pretty much beaten every game in my collection except for my most recent pickups. I even still have all my old saves with several games beaten 100% like Prime and Windwaker.  I'd argue that people with bigger collections have them because they are looking for new things to play because they've played what they have."

Gamecube,31k224,slowfreq,0,Sun Apr 5 21:26:24 2015 UTC,Sunshine is an exceptionally easy game man. It's almost impossible to to die in most levels and the FLUDD lowers the amount of skill involved in the plat forming. This is most apparent when you play the secret of the x levels.
Gamecube,31k224,Jorgasmic,5,Mon Apr 6 08:12:17 2015 UTC,"FLUDD lowers the amount of skill involved in plat forming  Most apparent when you play the secret of x levels   ...But Fludd gets taken away in every single ""secret of x"" level. That's the point. It's true platforming in those."
Gamecube,31k224,toughenough6,0,Mon Apr 6 13:59:20 2015 UTC,The level that you have FLUDD are way to easy. The fun and challenging platform isn't comes from the secret levels. Sorry I wasn't clear.

Gamecube,31k224,Destroyer_Wes,4,Sun Apr 5 23:43:44 2015 UTC,"Back when it first came out, I remember thinking wtf is with this lame water/jetpack gimmick, this isn't mario.  Then a couple years went by and I actually played it for the first time.. Its awesome.  Without a doubt my favorite 3d mario game.  It hooks you easily.  I'd agree with the guy who said its better than 64.  64 is hard to play now, with its awful camera system."
Gamecube,31k224,montoyasminion,2,Mon Apr 6 00:58:41 2015 UTC,Quite fun.
Gamecube,31k224,HughRistik,2,Sun Apr 5 22:11:28 2015 UTC,There's a lot of love hate relationships with this game. You really need to play it to find out if it's for you.
Gamecube,31k224,Lovespot,2,Sun Apr 5 22:16:52 2015 UTC,"I love it. I've 100%'d it multiple times and, coincidentally, I just sold my copy of it today for $30 on Craigslist.  Fun game, kinda like Mario 64 but with gadgets."
Gamecube,31k224,Slap_Fight_Champ,2,Sun Apr 5 22:30:40 2015 UTC,"Great game with a few frustrating elements. I'd love an HD sequel on the Wii U. Awesome graphics and art style which would be have been even better if there were more diverse levels/worlds (most are tropical island themed).   Getting all shines is a mostly enjoyable challenge! It took me a few years to appreciate the game as when it first came out I didn't really like it. Having beaten it within the last 12 months I can say I really like it now.  Give it a go, if you don't like it then just sell it. You'll get whatever you paid for it back. Let us know how you go with it :)"
Gamecube,31k224,PricklyCock,2,Mon Apr 6 01:40:11 2015 UTC,"It's one of the best 3D platformers of its generation, but that's hardly saying much. It's hard to go back to after playing Super Mario Galaxy, but it's worth a spin if you think you can handle the clunky controls and frustratingly inconvenient glitches."
Gamecube,31k224,shyguy528,2,Mon Apr 6 05:31:17 2015 UTC,"I thought the graphics were mindblowing at the time. They still hold up today in my opinion compared to other titles of the day. Personally, I enjoyed the stages without the FLUDD more than ones with. I also thought this was a better title than Super Mario 64."
Gamecube,31k224,macAaronE,2,Mon Apr 6 18:55:25 2015 UTC,It's a great game with minor flaws. It uses many of the same mechanics as Mario 64 (i.e. doing different tasks on the same level) but pretty much improves everything. The water pump thing is a source of joy and frustration in equal measure. And the camera has a life of its own. But it's really vibrant and there's hours of fun to be had.
Gamecube,31k224,BitmapKid,2,Tue Apr 7 07:53:52 2015 UTC,"In top 3 best gamecube games. No doubt man, go buy it."

Gamecube,31k224,miniboss1487,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:03:10 2015 UTC,It's very similar to Super mario galaxy and super mario 64. The levels are challenging and they're all fun.

Gamecube,31k224,deniselrey,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:42:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the video it was descriptive and humorous too. I think I like the sound of this game and I will get it soon.
Gamecube,31k224,someguy_matt,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:48:18 2015 UTC,"Good game 7/10. But I think it is the worst 3D Mario game. I found that the blue coins is the worst padding out of the 3D Mario games. Some of the difficult levels felt difficult because the level was glitchy. Lastly I know this isn't the biggest thing but I hate the lack of a long jump it just bothers me. It remains the only 3D Mario game I haven't 100% and I have no interest to do it. Expect to say I have 100% all the 3d Mario games. Man I said ""3D Mario games"" a lot in this comment"
Gamecube,31k224,imnotahick,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:10:52 2015 UTC,A top 3 GameCube game in my mind. So much fun. Pretty challenging and a nice change of pace from original marios
Gamecube,31k224,cardflopper,1 point,Mon Apr 6 04:42:24 2015 UTC,"I played it AFTER playing Super Mario Galaxy. After being spoiled by the awesomeness of Galaxy I could only enjoy Sunshine if I kept in mind that it was an older game.  Overall I'd say Sunshine is a good game for it's time, but many parts looked and felt glitchy. Also I wasn't a fan running around looking for entrance points in the confusing hub world (Delfino Plaza?)"
Gamecube,31k224,Gargogly,1 point,Mon Apr 6 05:30:16 2015 UTC,For quite some time I was convinced that the hub world was the game itself. Maybe that's why I hate Sunshine :P

Gamecube,31k224,deadgaiko,1 point,Mon Apr 6 09:18:32 2015 UTC,Sometimes FLUDD (the water cannon you tote around) is a little fiddly to use. That's about my only complaint. It's a very good 3D platformer and the visual style is so pretty and endearing! It's one of my all-time favourites!
Gamecube,31lan1,camargo21,2,Mon Apr 6 03:37:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say a good 60% of my collection I got when the games originally came out. I usually never sell my games. The only games I stupidly sold as a kid for Gamecube was Eternal Darkness, and Rogue Squadron 2. I went ahead and bought replacement copies of it a few months ago.   Now I usually just hunt for them on eBay or check my local retro shops every now and then. For eBay the best stuff I have gotten have been with auctions. If you're patient and try not to go for Buy it Nows you can usually get a good deal at a steal, especially if an auctioneer didn't use very good keywords and the auction has low visibility. An example was when I won Mark of Wolves for Dreamcast for only $25 when it usually goes for $45-$50. My local retro stores usually have buy 2 get 1 free deals and I'll make some more expensive purchases then because I end up saving a ton of money that way. Buying 2 games at $30 or more isn't so painful when you get the same value game for free."

Gamecube,31jz95,BitmapKid,4,Tue Apr 7 07:59:37 2015 UTC,"What do you want these games to cost? Even at $30 these games are cheaper than when they came out. The only difference is people want these more and for the majority of titles there's no other way to obtain these other than the original GameCube copy. What makes Nintendo first party games so ""expensive"" is that there's no other way to play these games legit without buying the original copy. These games are never going to be printed again, and never got released on PC like a lot of third party Xbox and PS2 games. They're never going to cost $5-10 like you are hoping they will because of supply and demand. The only way for the games to get cheaper is Nintendo either releases them digitally and creates unlimited supply, or they start producing the disks again. That's how economics works, and boycotting purchases on them isn't going to magically make the prices drop."
Gamecube,31jz95,miniboss1487,-3,Mon Apr 6 01:01:51 2015 UTC,"I don't want them to cost more than what they were when they first came out. If a game comes out at 50 dollars, as the time goes the game should drop to 30$ or less. Not double in price used."
Gamecube,31jz95,miniboss1487,4,Mon Apr 6 04:16:16 2015 UTC,"That's not how economics works... at all... Especially for commodities that are in high demand and are no longer being produced. Classic cars are more expensive now because Chevy, Ford, and so on are no longer making them anymore. They are always going to go up in price as less and less of them become available in the market. Just by the sheer fact that as time goes on more of these cars break down and are destroyed makes them more expensive, regardless of demand for them.  Besides, most games are still less than MSRP. http://videogames.pricecharting.com/console/gamecube?sort-by=highest-price  There's only 12 games that are over MSRP. 13 if you count the zelda collectors edition which was a pack in for a console and was free. It's also legitimately a rare collectors item. There's also inflation to take account of. According to an inflation calculator I used, $50 of 2001 dollars would be worth: $66.84 in 2014. $50 of 2014 dollars would be worth $37.40 in 2001.  Surprise, surprise, you're actually paying less now for games than you would have in 2001. GC games are actually cheaper now than they ever have been and are pretty much keeping pace with inflation."
Gamecube,31jz95,BCProgramming,-8,Mon Apr 6 04:35:45 2015 UTC,Fire Emblem is still too expensive. Should still cost 30 dollars.

If you don't want to pay X amount of dollars for something that you want, you clearly don't want it more than the people who DO buy it.  You are also welcome to make your own games to compete with games that are of certain price. On an unrelated note, I will gladly pay 100+ dollars for a game like Super Smash Bros. Melee simply because I feel the game is worth more than that in hours I will spend playing, along with quality of a game.  When you factor in the rarity, the quality, and the age of a product, you have to understand why they may be priced high."
Gamecube,31jz95,PaperLuigi3,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:15:26 2015 UTC,"Most people complaining are probably younger gamers who are used to seeing their games devalue from full price to $10 in less than a six months. Honestly that says a lot more about the state of the industry now than it does about retro gaming. You know what, Nintendo games still never drop in price even now. Go look up WiiU games on Amazon, most if not all the first party games are still almost full MSRP.  The games aren't even that expensive compared to what you get for them. I would much rather pay $30 for a game like Sunshine that is honestly, one of the greatest games ever made than full price for the trash that comes out today and will be worthless in a years time. And $30 is still cheaper than it cost back then. Remember when N64 and SNES games would run you over $70 brand new, sometimes even close to $100? Paying $40 for a cart is a steal."

You can get the Official Nintendo component cables, but they are extremely expensive, and there are no off-brand ones."
Gamecube,3011hz,MichaelWilleTheFirst,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:18:06 2015 UTC,Whats the difference between the expensive component cable and this one: http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/02/ciu/a7/fd/6c50c27a02a0fd9b3927d110.L.jpg
Gamecube,3011hz,Itellsadstories,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:25:59 2015 UTC,Component cables are much higher picture quality. The RGB cable gives the same quality as the S-Video Cable which is slightly better than the composite cable that came with the console.
Gamecube,3011hz,BCProgramming,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:40:58 2015 UTC,Is an RGB cable worth getting? Or should I go for the component cable? But they are so expensive though.. :(
Gamecube,3011hz,BCProgramming,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:44:08 2015 UTC,"It depends really. You won't find a better picture quality than component. The GameCube actually produces a better image with component than it does on the Wii with component, but very slightly most people won't notice a difference. Your cheapest option would be a Wii + Component Cable for Wii.   RGB and S-Video Cables really don't look that much better than composite. Unless you are gaming on an Tube TV you won't notice much change on a giant LCD."
Gamecube,3011hz,SturgeonMcGuai,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:56:18 2015 UTC,"The component cable outputs in 480p, and while it doesn't sound like much it is pretty crazy seeing some of the games play in that."
Gamecube,3011hz,SturgeonMcGuai,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:42:11 2015 UTC,"When you have your TV playing your Gamecube games, switch picture mode to 4:3 so the image doesn't get stretched out. There are a few games (like SSX3) that support 16:9.  Here's a list of games with 480p/16:9 support"
Gamecube,3011hz,SturgeonMcGuai,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:19:44 2015 UTC,"PAL has more options for video, I believe.  You can use an RGB SCART cable (like you've pictured a few times), which is typically considered superior to Component anyway."
Gamecube,3011hz,TheSammy58,2,Mon Mar 23 18:49:29 2015 UTC,Then why would people pay 100-200 dollars for a component cable?  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Nintendo-GameCube-Component-Video-Cable-DOL-001-Mint-Rare-/181688612230?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item2a4d7c3586  How can I see if I have a PAL version?
Gamecube,3011hz,TheSammy58,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:55:17 2015 UTC,"Because it is a far better option for North American systems, particularly since North American televisions typically don't have a SCART connector. (the Analog AV connector on a NTSC gamecube might not even wire up the RGB traces at all, not sure)   How can I see if I have a PAL version?    If you are in Europe or the UK you probably do. I assumed it was a PAL system because you mentioned it came with a SCART cable, which would be pretty much useless in North America. Otherwise it will be on the sticker on the bottom. USA or JAP means NTSC; anywhere else is probably PAL."
Gamecube,3011hz,zeress1,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:10:21 2015 UTC,If I check the bottom is says: DOL-001 (EUR).   My TV has: 1 component and 2 SCART points.   What would you advice to do?  I can buy this: http://www.rfgeneration.com/images/hardware/E-076/bf/E-076-H-00030-A.jpg for 20 euros.
Gamecube,3011hz,pinebarren,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:17:09 2015 UTC,"Best bet if in NA, is to get an S-Video cable. Likely your TV won't have the plug, so you'll need an S-Video to HDMI adapter off of eBay.  SCART is (IMO) only marginally better than S-Video, and unless you're in the UK, adapters can be hard to find.  Honestly, I went all out on mine, and in hind sight, a backwards compatible Wii is an easier way to do things."
Gamecube,300l4t,TimesFather,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:47:55 2015 UTC,"From my experience, in store units of Cirka controllers are amazing, from an online retailer, not so great. I have a Cirka n64 controller and GC controller. Although you can feel the lower quality build they work perfectly compared to most 3rd party controllers back in the day. The are responsive and accurate. The both withstood smash tournies. But again I do recommend buying from a retro game shop."
Gamecube,300l4t,railerswim,0,Tue Mar 24 05:24:59 2015 UTC,"As someone who has attempted to paint one, I can verify everything about those controllers is of lower quality. The shell does not like to go together, and is as you describe it ""creaky"". The button action is similar, but you can still feel the quality due to the manufacturer's bad molds. Control stick is looser than OEM and the rubber has lower ridges, sorta like the replacement sticks you can buy on Amazon. As for finish, the one I worked with was actually not the color it was described as. The silver controller is just painted silver with some kind of super sketchy paint. It took me about 2 weeks of sanding to get the controller shell to a point where I would consider painting it again. edit: Forgot to mention, no, those controllers don't have the embossments on the back of the controller."
Gamecube,2zxmhw,Forthexact,2,Sun Mar 22 19:51:47 2015 UTC,I think it has something to do with the actual part that makes the stick move. The only thing you can really do is replace it.
Gamecube,2zxmhw,Mil_HouseMD,2,Mon Mar 23 02:56:38 2015 UTC,"If I have to get a replacement controller, that sucks, but I want to get some good ideas as to what the problem could be. You think the problem is with the stick box? What specifically do you think could be wrong with it?  And re-reading my post, I should be a bit more specific what my problem is. I noticed this when playing Super Smash Bros Melee -- Occasionally if I dash one direction it gets input as a walk instead of a dash, like I'm not moving the stick quick enough, but I am. This doesn't happen to me with other controllers.   When I posted on /r/ssbm someone suggested that there might be some dust or something stuck in the control box and to try compressed air, do you think that may be the problem?"
Gamecube,2zxmhw,Mil_HouseMD,2,Mon Mar 23 03:12:07 2015 UTC,how old is the controller? I know with games like Melee the stick does get worn out faster than usual. It could just be wear and tear on the stick. Im only going with my experience because I recently found some old GC controllers that work fine but the stick assembly is wore out and I am looking for replacement parts since it would be cheaper to fix it on my own instead of buying another controller
Gamecube,2zxmhw,Mil_HouseMD,2,Mon Mar 23 04:04:21 2015 UTC,"The controller's really new -- it's my friend's controller; he got it new in box for christmas, opened it, and didn't use it. He's loaning it to me since I said it felt good and he doesn't like the way it feels. It was really dirty (he lives in a frat house + it was sitting around a few months) so I cleaned it with a Q-tip."
Gamecube,2zxmhw,Mil_HouseMD,2,Mon Mar 23 04:56:45 2015 UTC,its probably a defect then. If it has the smash logo I would try to contact nintendo and see what they can do for you.

Gamecube,2zur6k,Low718,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:24:02 2015 UTC,"Hm? The pawn shops and game stores sell the games at double to triple the price you could get them on ebay for, but the stores do exist. So say a game sells for about $40, I can guarantee that it's selling for no less than $80 at my local store. Since those stores are so abundant, owners, staff etc. each spend a chunk of their down time camping sites like craigslist, kijiji or flea markets scooping up games wholesale for reselling. Some games slip through the cracks, but most do not. What's left is a very competitive market with very little appealing things to buy price wise. For example, I am looking for a Dreamcast and the best I have found in my area is console only, no cables, no controllers, no games for $100. Checking eBay I can find much better deals, so there's little reason for me to buy them from the store unless I am exceptionally impatient.  Not sure which part confused you so hopefully that covered it."

From what I understand you need it and a NTSC copy of a compatible game and a bootloader or a modded GC...  You can play through Wii on Component otherwise but from what I understand it will be washed out compared to the GC one ?  Bottom line is I'd get a tube TV and stick with RGB really, it's a lot of faffing about and you need to spend an absurd amount of cash.  The PC emulator Dolphin upscales Wii and GC games but I've personally never tried it.

Gamecube,2zj4et,miniboss1487,2,Thu Mar 19 07:36:53 2015 UTC,"Nintendo, in a cost saving but baffling move decided to not actually put the chip that creates the component signal in the console itself but instead put it on the cable. In other words the cables have a special chip built into them that produces the image. This is why third party cables won't work.   The Wii has the component chip built into the console so third party cables work on it just fine. If you absolutely want to try GC games in 480p the cheapest option would be to find a Wii that can play GameCube games. Component cables for Wii cost about $15 and are widely available."

Gamecube,2zj4et,MacCollac,1 point,Thu Mar 19 16:20:16 2015 UTC,No because the digital converter is inside the cable instead of the port on the GameCube. Nobody has been able to reproduce it in a relatively cheap manner.

Gamecube,2z9uek,cadika_orade,2,Mon Mar 16 22:09:21 2015 UTC,"I did it myself actually so feel free to ask away. The fact of the matter is that the bottom 2.5 inches of the gamecube is actually empty space and ports for extra periferals (gameboy player, broadband, and debug ports) by removing the ports and cutting up the case there was plenty of space for batteries and one of the controller transmiters as well as an sd card adapter."

Gamecube,2z9uek,forgotmyredditagain,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:44:09 2015 UTC,I did not. I've used a wiikey in a past project. On this project though I opted for a xeno modded disc drive. And a sd card adapter wired to memory card slot B. I can still boot swiss from the disc drive and load off sd card if nessisary.

First of all, do you have a xenogc chip in there? I really recommend them.   Also, the build guide you posted actually keeps the disc drive. If you feel like slimming down the internals, you could put a wasp fusion+MEGAdrive v3 in to play games from an sd card. Then you won't have to carry around games, making it even more portable."

However you can buy other adapters for GameCube controllers that are made for PC  But also, a GameCube controller will not help you. You can't play multiplayer shooters with a controller on PC because everyone else will destroy you, games that do support controllers generally want a 360 controller, and then a huge majority of games don't support controllers and don't have controls that can be sensibly bound to a controller."

Gamecube,2ytcm8,miniboss1487,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:44:22 2015 UTC,"Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, Rogue Squadron 2, Windwaker, Melee, Animal Crossing and Timesplitters 2 were some of the games I was obsessed with growing up.  I remember I had a save file on Timesplitters 2 with about 98% completion and one day the game froze on the autosave screen and my save file got corrupted. I was so devastated I ended up selling it. I finally bought another copy again the other day and the nostalgia rushed back. Currently working on unlocking stuff again now.  Another victim of save file deletion was Sonic Adventure 2 Battle. I had a friend who had a horrible habit of pushing random buttons while a game was booting up and one day while booting up the game my 178 emblem save file (was only missing two chao race emblems) gets deleted before my eyes. I only managed to get 118 emblems again before getting burned out. Green Hill Zone still eludes me to this day.  Rogue Squadron 2 was me being a dumb stupid kid. I sold the game to a friend to buy the Sims which ended up being a shit game. I eventually bought Rogue Squadron 2 again but not before I deleted my 100% completion save file because I thought I was done with the game.   Finally a positive story. I still have my original copy of Windwaker and my 100% complete save file with pajama link. All figurines (including knuckle), all hearts, all sea charts, all puzzles solved at Link's Oasis. Everything 100% done. I loved that game. Currently playing the HD remake now on Wii U.  I also still have my original copy of Melee. Last I checked it had well over 500 hours of playtime on my over 10 year old save. I have everything unlocked for it except the Crazy Hand trophy which I believe you get for beating Adventure mode on the highest difficulty. No matter how hard I tried I just couldn't do that one. Some day...  Animal Crossing I still have my original town. I was obsessed with that game. I have legit copies (no universal codes) of almost every NES game. I even have the games you had to get from Nintendo's website at the time. The museum is complete, mortgage is paid off, perfect town, tons of rare items. No Animal Crossing game since has come close to matching the obsession I had with that game."

As for the other one, Im guessing that might be a little issue with the cable. Not much else you can do other than replace it by soldering. If you have any other questions, just give me a shout."

Gamecube,2yhpt1,miniboss1487,1 point,Tue Mar 10 07:15:22 2015 UTC,You should play Prime 1 first mostly because it's shorter. You can get through it quickly and learn to master the controls. Starting Prime 2 first you won't miss out much story wise but the game kinda assumes you have played the first game and doesn't hold back on the challenge.
Gamecube,2yhpt1,trolol420,1 point,Sat Mar 14 22:12:21 2015 UTC,"Having aged both in order I would recommend doing this.  Overall I prefer the first game however the second game IMO is much more challenging and has some seriously awesome game design, however the world is generally more bleak and a lot less diverse in many ways.  I think playing prime first will really give you a taste of what the series is about before getting maybe turned off by aspects of the second game"

I get tired of youtube videos that give very little information about the title they are reviewing/talking about. Also the video was paced really well. Thanks for the video capture of the game as well.  For constructive criticism, You should look at the camera rather than the laptop. Looking to the side of the camera makes you look a little disinterested. Also, you might stand up to maintain more energy while talking.  Thanks for doing the video and I subscribed."
Gamecube,2yfzmg,neut6o1,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:58:03 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for watching and sharing your opinion on it!  I tend to be more into the technical side of things so I find that information interesting to talk about and share because its generally forgotten in most reviews.   As for looking at the camera I noticed it right away! I find it incredibly challenging to look at the camera and to sound enthusiastic when its just me. I think for the next one I will do it in a different area where I can stand and have my wife or a friend behind the camera so I can talk to and focus on them!
Gamecube,2yfzmg,neut6o1,1 point,Tue Mar 10 12:43:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that technical information is definitely what separates you. Keep it up.

Gamecube,2ya5hf,nermal543,2,Mon Mar 9 00:54:16 2015 UTC,My local Half Price Books used to price games way too low and it was awesome. I got Mario Party 3 on N64 for cheap (like $15 I think). Unfortunately they know better now haha. They probably only gave the seller like $5 for that copy of Melee too; Half Price Books barely gives you anything when you sell there.
Gamecube,2ya5hf,miniboss1487,0,Tue Mar 10 16:36:39 2015 UTC,That's higher than the original MSRP. I hate to burst your bubble but that's the going rate for Melee. The market dictates the value and Half Price Books is selling accordingly. I would of probably bought it if I didn't have it if the condition of the disk was near mint.  http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?ssPageName=GSTL&_nkw=super+smash+bros+melee&rt=nc&LH_BIN=1

Gamecube,2ya001,xnickg77,1 point,Sat Mar 7 22:02:39 2015 UTC,Mario Party 4 is more similar to the N64 games while Mario Party 5 starts to go in the direction of 6-8 (I love 6-8 as well though) but still has elements of the older stuff as well. I personally love 4 the most because of nostalgia but really all the gamecube Mario Party games are great. I also like Mario Party 8 as well (the first one for the Wii) but I'm sure that there are many that would disagree.
Gamecube,2ya001,ebec20,1 point,Sat Mar 7 22:32:32 2015 UTC,"4 is easily my favorite on the GameCube.  5 is really good, too.  Never cared for 6 and 7."

Gamecube,2y67jx,DragonFruit420,13,Fri Mar 6 20:36:24 2015 UTC,"People hold onto Nintendo games, also Nintendo's style lends itself wonderfully to aftermarket collecting and speculation. There are a lot of PS2 and Xbox games that are basically worthless since they rely heavily on dead online features. Nintendo's couch multiplayer mentality means that their games live on far longer, so the aftermarket buyers move in droves. Also the Gamecube didn't sell incredibly well, but it has more demand overall than N64 likely due to having a more dynamic and larger library.  Games also tend to climb upwards in price after a few years resting in the aftermarket. Prices crash after a system is discontinued as people move onto the next system, but since Wii had BC capabilities more people held onto GC games, which lead to a smaller trickle that kept prices artificially high. Now the prices are climbing even higher since there was no real bottoming out of the GC's library.  PS2 and Dreamcast are going to be the other collectible consoles of this generation. Dreamcast has the virtue of dying early, having a small library, and has plenty of limited print runs. I don't see Dreamcast games too often in the wild anymore. /r/Dreamcast is also slightly larger than /r/Gamecube despite the system selling roughly half as many units as the GC.  PS2 is collectible for the opposite reasons, it seems to be an immortal system. There are tons of games for it of all genres, so there's plenty choice for collectors of any type of game. Since there are so many games then it can be difficult to find a specific game you're looking for. Just because the console is dirt common doesn't mean its library is. PS2 prices are starting to climb, some uncommon games (Haunting Ground is my example) were about $30 just 2 or 3 years ago, now this game is pushing $100 complete."
Gamecube,2y67jx,SenorPsycho,3,Fri Mar 6 23:12:37 2015 UTC,"There aren't many pricey Gamecube games; even with shipping through online sites pretty much every game is still below the original MSRP complete. The big exception to this is SSBM which still sells for $50 or occasionally $60, but that's because it still has a thriving (and growing) competitive community. Most other first-party titles can be had for $10-$30."

Gamecube,2y1d9w,Socksfelloff,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:37:45 2015 UTC,I actually have the same PVM. You force the gameboy player to 240p with SWISS and it lokkst pretty damn good over s video.   If you get a pal cube you can use a regular rgb cable. For NTSC/jap you have to mod a component cable which I wouldn't recommend .  Tldr: use svideo and keep looking for a PVM that does component .

I tried in the dark, light, with my DSLR and with my xperia z2.  Nothing turned out as I wanted it to but Hopefully these help in some way. I ended up going with the pictures from my DSLR. The 240p Picture for the GBP does not do it justice. The scanlines are twice as thick and being a progressive signal it stops the fucking text from bouncing all over the screen.  http://abload.de/img/dsc_4131inuwu.jpg  http://abload.de/img/dsc_4135k4uqt.jpg  http://abload.de/img/dsc_4140myuoy.jpg  These were all taken over S video. My Svideo cable has a composite lead as well and i was able to hook them up at the same time and switch between the 2. Composite looks the same just alot more blurry. It just wasn't coming through properly over a picture. I even tried filming me playing ! It still didn't come through good enough  I would highly recommend the svideo cable as it is miles above composhit. Take a look at some captured footage on youtube comparing the 2."

I've been following the PVM scene for a while and think you could get a better deal for that price. I picked up (2) 1342Q pvms for $15 on Kijiji. While I know I got a great deal I see guys in the PVM thread on neogaf getting much better monitors for $120.  As for the Svideo cable I dont know a specific one just try not to buy the $0.99 cable from china.  http://www.ebay.ca/itm/New-KMD-SFC-SNES-GC-N64-S-Video-SVHS-AV-Composite-Cable-for-Nintendo-64-Gamecube-/161346611253?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item259101e835  This looks identical to the cable I'm using and from what I can tell it's a good quality cable.

Gamecube,2xzsul,SCf3,3,Thu Mar 5 05:33:39 2015 UTC,"in terms of price for a system, $50 is appropriate for a game store only because the store should have tested and/or refurbished the system to ensure its in working order.  now if you're frugal like any other collector on here, then try craigslist or yard sales and such. yes, these can be unreliable and sketchy, but patience, a good eye, haggling, and an ignorant/desperate seller can net you a system for well under $20.   as for color, indigo, black, and platinum, take your pick, they're really the only colors we got in the states as far as systems go.   controllers, you don't see spice orange that often but it does pop up from time to time, half indigo/half clear i'm not certain if it came here but I do recall seeing a used one in a shop once, and japan exclusively had emerald blue and a white one with a longer cord around the time the wii came out.  a working Gameboy player and disc together really should only be about $50, but the disc alone easily is $50 at maximum.  as for games, since I haven't seen anyone else mention them, might I suggest Ikaruga, Alien Hominid, and Killer 7."
Gamecube,2xzsul,marvel8797,1 point,Fri Mar 6 03:17:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't mind paying $50 because it's a local store I want to support and I know it's good quality there.

As far as collecting goes, use eBay and Craigslist and be patient.  Don't throw money at the computer and get into bidding wars and end up overpaying.

Gamecube,2xz3nk,jowijo,3,Thu Mar 5 01:49:26 2015 UTC,"Outside of what you're doing, the only other common softmods are:   PSOLoad Max Drive Pro SD Media Launcher   I've only ever used the Max Drive Pro, before switching over to using the AR + SD card method.  Quite frankly, AR + SD is probably the best overall solution to running unsigned code.  The SD Media launcher is the next best thing, since it skips the whole process of having to type in that really long AR code and format the SD card to the specfiics of SDLoad.  Don't ever bother with a Max Drive Pro, though.  Mine was finicky all the time; some times it was corrupt, some times it just didn't work, some times it actually worked.  I mainly bought one to back up my memory card saves, but with the advent of Wii/GC homebrew that allows memory card backup, the device is basically pointless for running homebrew code (especially since whatever you wanted to run had to fit on the Max Drive Pro to boot, and it would only boot stuff fine half the time anyway)."

Gamecube,2xvt58,BJ22CS,2,Wed Mar 4 18:20:24 2015 UTC,"Well the collection app I use says it's worth about $2500 (based on Ebay), so I'd estimate I spent somewhere between $1000-$1100, and maybe about $800-900. I got lots of great deals but there was still a bunch I paid the full Ebay price for. At one point a local game store was having a 75% off gamecube game sale so I bought a bunch then, and a another local store is pretty generous with their pricing. Plus, I had a few pricier ones when I started (Melee, Paper Mario, and Wind Waker).   Also have a few guides, right here http://imgur.com/yTU1bNT I pick them up whenever I see them at my local store, they price them at $5 uniformly."

Gamecube,2xxifb,CoffeeHamster,1 point,Wed Mar 4 18:13:30 2015 UTC,I recently picked one up on eBay. There is also a brick & mortar store called The Exchange that still sells them.   There are resellers on the web but I feel most are overpriced. You can always check Goodwill  flea markets or garage sales.   If you're going the eBay route study the prices for a week so you know what's a good price and what isn't. Some people are simply out of their minds with the asking price.   After watching prices for about 2 weeks I got a black Cube with a very clean Wavebird (and receiver)  and 2 OEM memory cards for $55.  Prices are better during the day so keep that in mind.
Gamecube,2xxifb,Foamfollower65,1 point,Wed Mar 4 19:24:35 2015 UTC,I bought mine complete for about $60 off amazon. Read the descriptions until you can find one that you can tolerate and buy it up.

Gamecube,2xuyre,PrepareForImpact,8,Wed Mar 4 02:06:32 2015 UTC,"No.  That version of AR does not allow cheat code input.  The last version of Action Replay that did, iirc, is v1.14.  If you want custom code input to load homebrew, you'll need a version of AR that's either v1.14 or below.  Also, it's doubtful the codes for F-Zero AX are preloaded on the disc.  Alternatively, Datel also sells the SD Media Launcher.  Buy the version without an SD card, since you can get a higher capacity one cheaper elsewhere."

Gamecube,2xmwl4,MetroidMan347,3,Mon Mar 2 10:47:39 2015 UTC,I'm assuming you live in the US. So I highly recommend LukieGames.com. I live in Australia and I order from it even though it's based in the US. I also had a complaint once with them regarding a N64 controller I bought from them that was in filthy condition and they responded to my request of a complimentary item very well. Their prices are reasonable in my opinion and they have free shipping on orders above $25. Most items I have bought from them are in very good condition too (I say most because the N64 controller was horrid but I cleaned it up quite well).  As for games. I highly recommend Sonic Adventure 2 Battle and Luigi's Mansion (they are my two favourite games that I still play today). Mario Kart Double Dash and Super Mario Sunshine are also very good.

Gamecube,2xmwl4,Eggnug,1 point,Mon Mar 2 16:40:12 2015 UTC,"Summoner: A Goddess Reborn. It's a real time fantasy RPG with a wonderful story, action-packed gameplay, and a handful of characters to choose from (can have 3 active in the party at any given time). I enjoyed the background and personality of each, with their individual strengths and weaknesses. The voice acting is quality, too! The game is mature and can be quite dark and disturbing, which is refreshing if you are concerned about RPGs with too much fluffiness in them. I loved the lore, a lot of thought went into this project and it is immersive because of it.  Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem. A horror/psychological thriller that is absolutely BAD ASS. It plays like other survival horror games, but with its own unique twists. It has a ""sanity"" meter, which decreases when your character faces the hordes of darkness in this game. It will actually alter your gameplay, audio, and visuals and make you (the player) hallucinate things such as your own death, game overs, hard resets on the GC (freaky), random attacks, dizziness, etc. You're gonna want that sanity meter full, unless you're a sicko like me and love how distorted the game becomes when it's low! Youtube some examples of what happens, it's interesting.  Each chapter is played by a different character in a different era of humanity. Starting with the Roman times and ending in the present day. The focus of the game is on a young woman in the present, and you will return to her chapter often in between the others. Each character is part of a much larger story being told, as they aid one another throughout the span of time, often unwittingly, to save humanity from a trio of Lovecraftian gods who make a game out of fucking with the mortal realm.  It's so deep, it's so cool, and has just the right amount of difficulty to keep it interesting."

Gamecube,2x9s5r,Helios254,3,Thu Feb 26 20:30:14 2015 UTC,"Hey, it's plug and play.. (or plug and tape really).. you'll need a gamebit screwdriver to open your cube. You remove the dvd drive, and tape in the mega drive with wasp. Then run the sd card slot however you want.   I believe it can load what ever iso's.. from whatever region. It uses swiss to load them (an app). So try googling swiss game compatibility. Game saves still need a memory card. Swiss had memory card emulation, but it's been turned off in the latest builds.  Edit: here's the compatibility link: http://www.gc-forever.com/wiki/index.php?title=Swiss/Compatibility_List  (ymmv, some games that are listed here as not working, may work on newer builds.. audio streaming doesn't work at all right now)."

Main reason I'm doing it is lack of funds for all the games I want. Also I can still play multiplayer right. And once it is all installed I just have to press the power button for it to start?
Gamecube,2x9s5r,Termnlychill91,2,Thu Feb 26 20:45:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, supported games play the same as they would from disc, so MP is fine.   Power button, you'll see the gamecube interface, go up to game, and you'll see swiss. Push A, and then start.  (when ordering, if you don't want to do any soldering, ask Mega to solder the eject, and pin 29 pads for you..  Pin 29 is for a wii drive, which you wont have, and unless you feel like soldering the wires from your gamecube lid to the mega drive, he can just bridge them off so it always thinks the lid is closed)."

Gamecube,2x6oeh,Misterhambone,11,Thu Feb 26 02:00:57 2015 UTC,It's a pretty great game if you accept it for what it is. I never understood the hate for it that mostly resided in the fact it's not a traditional star fox game. Throw all that out the window and play the game for what it is and you'll get one of the best Zelda like adventure games that came out for 6th gen. I love the game. It's nowhere near as good as Zelda but it's still a solid adventure game.

Gamecube,2x6oeh,miniboss1487,3,Thu Feb 26 03:07:48 2015 UTC,"It's more of a traditional star fox game. The arwing sections in the game are incredible and the game is worth it for that alone. The biggest criticism was with the on foot section. However, there is a control scheme for on foot controls that basically turn the game into a traditional third person shooter where you use the c stick for dual analog controls. I personally think in the older reviews it seems like the reviewers didn't even bother adjusting the controls for the on foot section. Game is an 8/10 to me once you adjust the controls for the on foot sections."

Gamecube,2x15dz,ghostromo,-1,Wed Feb 25 02:38:46 2015 UTC,I guess I just never realized this sub is run by middle school kids with commodity fetishes.
Gamecube,2x15dz,KingOfRedLions,4,Wed Feb 25 14:26:38 2015 UTC,"What exactly are you hoping for from a sub devoted to a discontinued console? Your accusation of commodity fetishism could easily be extended to anyone with an interest in an old gaming device.  I'm not jumping on your back, here - just genuinely curious what content direction you think would be more appropriate for this board."
Gamecube,2x15dz,slk5060,0,Wed Feb 25 16:50:36 2015 UTC,I guess its just... I'm on a lot of old gen subs and this is the only one with a constant parade of pictures of games.

Gamecube,2wrpb5,DerekStu,2,Sun Feb 22 16:56:09 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there are hidden gems on the wii and wii u, my issue is the way Nintendo is advertising and trying to make their system to casual and only appealing to children and family with crappy party and games and rehashed games of new super Mario brothers. Even super smash brothers on the wii, 3ds, and wii u seem less appealing than melee."
Gamecube,2wrpb5,charizard6377,2,Sun Feb 22 18:08:30 2015 UTC,"I'm of the same opinion.  The GameCube was the last Nintendo console that was a pure gaming device.  No gimmick controller, no ""operating system"" to navigate around...just great games.  Even the design of the console says ""Hey, I am fun and awesome."""
Gamecube,2wrpb5,charizard6377,1 point,Sun Feb 22 16:56:51 2015 UTC,"If Nintendo in 4 or 5 years get their shit together, they should comeback with a GameCube 2, or at least a console that resembles everything like the GameCube but with 4k graphics and third party support and free online that resembles Xbox live."
Gamecube,2wrpb5,oscillating000,2,Sun Feb 22 17:58:53 2015 UTC,Those things already exist xboxone/ps4 why would you want Nintendo to do the same.
Gamecube,2wrpb5,charizard6377,-1,Sun Feb 22 19:44:16 2015 UTC,What do you mean why? i would buy the next Nintendo console that does that. i
Gamecube,2wrpb5,charizard6377,0,Sun Feb 22 20:02:54 2015 UTC,"There is almost no difference between the xboxone and ps4 except for the exclusive games what few there are.  If that's the type of console you want buy one of those there is no need to add another almost identical type of console, Nintendo need to be the innovator not the we did the same as the others."
Gamecube,2wrpb5,HughRistik,0,Sun Feb 22 20:27:58 2015 UTC,"There is almost no difference between the xboxone and ps4 except for the exclusive games what few there are.    There is no reason to buy any Nintendo console aside from the exclusive games. You buy a 3DS for Pokémon and SSBf3DS, not the watered-down underperforming versions of Call of Duty and Splinter Cell. You buy a Wii U for New Super Mario Bros. and Hyrule Warriors and SSBfWU and Kirby's Epic Yarn, not Borderlands and Battlefield.  Nintendo has only managed to survive this long in the modern video gaming market because of their exclusive titles and characters. I'd personally love if they took the same concepts that make the Xbox and PlayStation good — i.e., a usable online marketplace, good matchmaking, an achievements system, a more manageable friends list — and get back to basics with a new console. They can keep the gimmicky control types if they want (Xbox shows no signs of abandoning the god awful Kinect garbage), but I want a console with a good selection of Nintendo games that I can play with a plain old controller (D-pad, A, B, X, Y, L, R, Select, Start) instead of a Wiimote."
Gamecube,2wrpb5,zFoxx,1 point,Mon Feb 23 01:54:56 2015 UTC,"No I buy Nintendo because its different, I love the two screens on the ds and I bought the 3dsxl for the 3d, I bought the Wii for the difference the Wii remote provided and the wiius off tv play is amazing and the only thing I bought it for. Without those things I would have just stuck to PC and the wiiu does now provide a plain old controller and several other types of controller (unlike the xbox and ps4) for those of you who want that."
Gamecube,2wrpb5,mrstevethompson,-1,Mon Feb 23 11:35:15 2015 UTC,"so in other words to be put into implications, your saying that Nintendo next console should just be another gimmicky Wii with continuously shit online and mediocre titles like on the Wii and Wii u?"

I lightly sand all the buttons, and then wipe em down. Primer, then sand any rough spots. Paint, then sand any rough spots. Reapply a light coat of paint and finish it off with a clear coat. The clear coat is what makes the buttons last."

Gamecube,2wn0oj,miniboss1487,1 point,Sat Feb 21 21:19:49 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by reasonable price? Are you hoping to find games like Mario Sunshine for less than $20? Well good fucking luck. The market for old Nintendo games is booming and game prices are only going to get higher due to demand. If you do want to get a good deal, your best bet is to go to a flea market or thrift store. It's the only place people have been getting lucky. If not you're gonna have to pony up some cash and go to a retro game shop, or eBay. eBay tend to be cheaper than shops."
Gamecube,2wn0oj,miniboss1487,1 point,Sat Feb 21 23:31:25 2015 UTC,"Well, I was certainly not expecting to buy Sunshine for US$20. But 20€ would be nice. I have checked online and I could find it for 18€ :D. Unfortunately, I am traveling today and cannot buy it right. Whelp, no problems.   But I see your point on the booming part. Sunshine was kind of easy to find, but Paper Mario can get up to 100€! Maybe I'll have to wait for Wii U remakes [and buying a Wii U] before playing some GC games.  Also, just to be sure, the Wii and GC and Region-blocked, right?"
Gamecube,2wn0oj,Lovespot,1 point,Sun Feb 22 07:08:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah they are region locked. The market in the EU might be different with some games being cheaper than here in America. Over here sunshine is going for about $35 and Paper Mario goes for about $50. Your results may vary. Gamecube games are worth getting. It's my favorite console for sure but out of all the 6th gen consoles it's definitely the most expensive to collect for. In contrast PS2, and Xbox games are all dirt cheap. Even Zone of the Enders 2 which was considered rare has dramatically dropped in price due to HD remakes. Gamecube games are expensive because for the most part you can only play them on Gamecube at the moment. If Nintendo ever released digital GameCube games we might see some pricing drop."

Gamecube,2wev67,st1tchy,2,Sat Feb 21 04:43:01 2015 UTC,"I bought my Gamecube launch day 2001 with three titles (Gamestop required this for the pre-order, I think) - Super Monkey Ball, Luigi's Mansion, and Rogue Leader.  As the years went on, I bought games new - games that today are going for a pretty penny: Smash Bros. Melee, Eternal Darkness, Pikmin 2... brand new Gameboy Player. I had it all and I was living in the lap of Gamecube launch.  When the Wii came out and was backwards compatible, I quickly traded my Gamecube (with GB player attached) to Gamestop for ~60$. As the years went on... 2008, 2009, 2010... I thinned my collection of games as I moved on from the Wii and got into the PS3. I figured I wouldn't be likely to play my GC collection again - especially since I was very disappointed in the Wii and didn't know whether or not I'd keep it.  Eventually my collection of around 20-25 games dwindled to a mere 3: Metroid Prime, Pikmin 2, and my launch-day copy of Super Monkey Ball. I was a fool. Nostalgia soon reared its head as the waves of quality PS3 titles dried up and I turned back to my old favorites. I bought a second-hand 2004 Gamecube off craigslist and started rebuilding.  I'm back to around 6 games now including the ones from my original collection. I don't know what games I'll re-buy, but I can truly say this is one of my few regrets in life.  TL;DR Never get rid of your old shit. Also, Nintendo Wii - not even once."

There's a project in the works to reverse engineer the chip, but it's a little ways from being ready.   If you want. For $150 on Amazon you can snag the Japanese dterminal cable. It's their version of component. You cut the end off and splice some rca ends and you have a component cable for $100 less than the going rate.   Edit: DAC is probably the wrong term. But the gist is the chip that decodes the digital signal from the cube to analog is inside the cable."

Gamecube,2w7s2o,DrEllisD,2,Tue Feb 17 18:06:13 2015 UTC,I would check the power adapter first.
Gamecube,2w7s2o,Socksfelloff,2,Tue Feb 17 18:25:48 2015 UTC,You mean just get a new power adapter and see if that's the issue?
Gamecube,2w7s2o,Socksfelloff,1 point,Tue Feb 17 18:28:05 2015 UTC,I mean throw a multimeter on the output of the power plug and see if you're getting any voltage. Trying another adapter would work as long as you're sure its good.
Gamecube,2w7s2o,Jorgasmic,2,Tue Feb 17 18:31:44 2015 UTC,so apparently both the outlets I tried plugging it into afterwards weren't working properly and I tried a third outlet just for the sake of hope and it worked. Thanks!

Gamecube,2w7acz,Itellsadstories,1 point,Tue Feb 17 17:59:55 2015 UTC,At least Gamestop stopped putting their stickers on the box art itself. That was a rough year or two for buying their games. You couldn't take the sticker off without destroying the art.

Gamecube,2w260n,Meganezuki,2,Mon Feb 16 08:40:26 2015 UTC,Huh I never thought badly about the player's choice cases. They never looked bad or bad design to me.
Gamecube,2w260n,Swazzoo,2,Mon Feb 16 11:47:01 2015 UTC,"The fact that I don't like the design is not directly related to how the case looks but rather how it doesn't go well with the rest of the collection.

I've played through it at least 10 times and love the characters. Favorites are probably Soren and Jill.  LOZ Wind Waker: The art style is absolutely fantastic, it still holds up to this day. Exploration is my favorite part of the Zelda series so the ocean with so many islands to visit really appealed to me.  SSB Melee: I've followed the competitive scene for Melee for about 3 years now and think its fantastic. Smash Bros Project M (http://projectmgame.com/en/) is probably my most played game of all time and it was inspired by this. Before anyone asks, Iplay Marth in melee and Ivysaur and Squirtle in Project M. My favorite players are Amsa and Chu Dat.  Honorable mentions go to Pikmin for being so charming and Metroid Prime for, well, being Metroid Prime."

Open up the joysticks, disassemble.  Wash all the plastic parts in warm soapy water.  Dry thoroughly and reassemble.  Replace worn joysticks (replacement parts are readily available.)  Get a new 1019 block memory card from Amazon.  Feel badly about opening it, but do it anyway.  Buy an overpriced component cable on eBay, and feel badly about it.

Gamecube,2vq30p,tigey101,1 point,Fri Feb 13 18:54:51 2015 UTC,You can find some cheap games on ebay.
Gamecube,2vq30p,SpunkBunk,2,Fri Feb 13 03:35:28 2015 UTC,"I'll say this - ebay does have a lot of cheap third party titles, but anything with say, Mario or Zelda in it (main Nintendo titles) are skyrocketing for some reason. Some are modestly priced, like Sunshine and Double Dash still being around $40 but for some ungodly reason there are some Mario Party titles hitting $60, Twilight Princess + Wind Waker hitting $80, etc...  So my ideal way of getting your games cheap is third party titles, check ebay. Check ebay anyway for a Nintendo title, sometimes people will put them out cheap (but they don't last). Anything else, you have to try locally... Most people won't even realize their games are three times more than what you are giving them (but don't let them in on it either :p )"
Gamecube,2vq23u,tigey101,5,Fri Feb 13 02:35:28 2015 UTC,"Hi! I've fixed quite a few GCN's, as well as other products from Nintendo in the past, and can offer some advice.   Make sure you have the proper tools to do this. It isn't going to do you much good if you can't get the things apart. Phillips screwdrivers with small heads as well as the tri-wing should be essential in your kits. Also, arm yourself with some rubbing alcohol, tweezers, Q-Tips, soldering iron, and compressed air. Also, would be a good idea to have known, good working controller, mem card, power supply, and AV cables. Read up on how to take the thing apart BEFORE you take the thing apart. You might not be able to become a repair warrior, but going into taking these things apart with the knowledge beforehand will save you some time and patience. Then when you get them, refer to that guiide if you get stumped. Using this method, I can take apart a DS/DSL/DSi/3DS/3DSXL apart in my sleep. Organize as you take it apart. I have small snapcase storage bins for screws for larger projects (laptops) and for smaller, quick jobs, I use clean, rinsed out soda pop bottle caps. Put them on a piece of paper, and draw arrows to lable where the screws go. If it helps, use a camera so that way you know what it looks like before drilling in. Remember, you only get bonus points for fixing a GCN if no parts are left over, including screws.  Document as you troubleshoot. First, examine. See if there are any loose screws, burnt odors, melted plastic, anything rattling, etc. Try plugging it in and turning it on. Document what you witness on that sticky note. Examples include: ""No audio, but sound"", ""No A/V"", ""nothing"", ""optical grinding noise."" Add additional information as you examine closer. There can be a common cause and repair method that you can discover to expedite the process faster in the future. It's how people know to eliminate the obvious, and fix the problem rapidly with those YLOD and RROD consoles; they know what isn't the problem. There is such a thing as ""He's dead, Jim..."" And, you need to keep that in mind when you encounter a headscratcher. Don't get discouraged after days and days of beating a dead Gamecube to try and fix it. Sometimes, dead GCN's are just that. Dead. ...but there is also such a thing as ""Let's use the spare parts, Jim!"" Mother/daughter boards can die, but maybe that optical drive still works. Maybe it can be used to repair that one with the grinding noise. Scrap all good, confirmed working parts from the dead ones and stockpile them. Once you get an arsenal up, it's always a good idea to have a ""frankenstein"" GCN, one that is taken apart that you can try different parts on to confirm working.    Like El_Pesado said, buying a broken lot of GCN's from eBay, you can probably cobble parts from A, B, C, and get a good working unit. It's building up a skill, or better yet, a hobby. At one time, many many years ago, I had 6 or 7 working DS Lites. I still to this day, get people texting me from my hometown asking me if I have any parts.  It's a good way to get some cash if you want to go that route.  Good luck!"

Gamecube,2vkkq2,El_Pesado,3,Wed Feb 11 20:07:41 2015 UTC,"I belive you're confusing the Digital AV component cable with the Scart cable. The scart, from the looks of it, connects to the analog AV out on the gamecube, which is mainly used for composite.  The Digital AV out is used by the Component cable, it emits component output and is significantly hard to find. Also explains why it's so expensive. Hopefully my response isn't too confusing to understand, I'm pretty bad at explaining  things. Haha"

Gamecube,2vkkq2,Elgand,3,Wed Feb 11 20:23:32 2015 UTC,"It really isn't similar. The Component cable for the Gamecube outputs a native resolutions of 480p. 480p is double the information of composite video, which is a maximum of 480i.  I fully plan to purchase one of these cables. Right now I use a s-video cable to an HDMI upconverter, but it pales in comparison to what a component cable would give me.   Many people do not see the value in these cables, and they are welcome to use 480i. Others like myself want to experience the games in the best possible way, and the component cable is necessary to achieve that."
Gamecube,2vkkq2,Socksfelloff,1 point,Thu Feb 12 03:27:28 2015 UTC,"For starters only a PAL cube can output scart. It also outputs at 50hz which is poopoo.

Anamorphic is the preferred setting if you are using a widescreen TV as it doesn't cut the resolution down but still gives the 16:9 ratio.   Hope that helps.

They're called ""anti-static points"". If you don't know how to solder don't be scared, it's really easy for this type of job since you are only de-soldering. The job you would be doing is similar to this (it is really that easy). If you'd rather not go to the hassle, /u/socksfelloff is correct.

Gamecube,2vab8x,Socksfelloff,1 point,Tue Feb 10 09:56:42 2015 UTC,"Well as for troubleshooting, I'd try to adjust the potentiometer. Here's a pretty good video about it. I linked to the part where he starts up the gamecube so you can see if it is a similar issue. He starts talking about the fix at 10:20. I'd watch that and give it a shot. Also, make sure to check the red and brown wire that comes out of the top half of the laser assembly onto the board. Sometimes the wire breaks off since it's so fragile. If that happens to be the case, just solder back on. And the last thing I can think of would be that the laser has an extra anti static point on it on the upper side of the ribbon cable. I'd just compare the new laser to the old one. If there's a clump of solder on the new one that the old one doesn't have, you may need to de-solder it.

Gamecube,2v8a6z,naylord,0,Sun Feb 8 21:31:52 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this completely; one of the ideas of the game was asymmetric information. With the multiple tvs that is lost so that's definitely not a plus. Also ""neck aches"" from looking down at your controller is way too dramatic. I could just as easily claim the multi tv method creates neck aches from you moving your head left or right to look at different tvs."

Gamecube,2v3eun,BigRobotBil,6,Sat Feb 7 15:12:58 2015 UTC,"My three copies of Luigi's Mansion.  One was from the North American launch day of the Gamecube.  I was going around with my parents, and the local Kmart and Walmart ran out of consoles, but not software.  So, I bought a copy of LM in anticipation of getting the Gamecube.  The following day, while I was at school, my parents found that the nearby Toys 'R"" US had them.  I got a black Gamecube, since all my friends got the purple color, and I felt like being different.  My second copy is the Japanese version, which I found at a local game shop in a nearby city.  I had never seen a Japanese Gamecube game before, and they wanted $20 for a complete copy.  Since I really enjoyed LM, I thought, ""Why not.""  My third and final copy is the PAL version.  Once I found out that the PAL version had a different Hidden Mansion mode than both NTSC copies, I really wanted to give it a go.  Found a complete one on eBay for about $15 in the UK.  I then ran into the unfortunate problem that I couldn't play it, as LM PAL is one of the few titles that doesn't support 60Hz.  Being that I live in NTSC-land, I couldn't find a compatible setup for 50Hz (especially since I was running it on a NTSC 'cube, so I was outputting NTSC 50Hz).  GC emulation was still not that great at this time, and the family desktop was quite old, so I gave up on trying to play it until Dolphin picked up the pace.  Now, I can barely make it through the PAL Hidden Mansion since I'm so used to running through it on the US/JAP version :P .  Someday, the E3 '01 version shall be mine.  Someday..."

I asked him if I could borrow it to play it through myself, and he just GAVE IT TO ME. I couldn't believe it, asked him 3-4 times if he was sure, and he said no problem.

I had bought a copy a long time ago at Gamestop for $18, but over the years, the case and disk got separated. This summer, before I left the country I live in now to go back to the States for school, I stayed up at night tearing apart my living room looking for it. When I finally found it in a completely generic black case without a cover, I fist pumped so high. I played through it as soon as I got to college and picked up a copy of Radiant Dawn for $59 at Gamestop (it was the last one with the original case). If I could get a Gameboy Player to play the other two on a big screen, it would be nice. I had a friend who had one once and I used it to play FE7 Chapter 16x and thought it was the coolest thing.  My collection of great games just doubled. As my fiancé and her mother were digging through a storage unit looking for something else, they found their old Gamecube and a lot of really good stuff (Twilight Princess, Wind Waker, Super Mario Sunshine, etc.). Once I get through some of those, I will probably have another opinion."
Gamecube,2v3eun,miniboss1487,2,Mon Feb 9 02:27:58 2015 UTC,"My Favorite part of my Gamecube collection is the Entire Resident Evil Franchise.   Love it!

Eventually I found out that Gamestop was getting rid of ALL of their Gamecube games and I snatched up Zero, 1, and 3 while I still had the chance. 2 and Code Veronica X I Bid for on eBay. Resident Evil 2 was well worth it since the case, game and booklet was spotless almost brand new. Code Veronica X I had to buy a Replacement case and print out a Cover.   But getting the entire collection is worth it. I love that series on that system.  Another Gem of mine that has an interesting story is Tales of Symphonia. It's kinda strange. I bought the game at a Gamestop only to come home to find out the Disc wouldn't read. Tried it on my Wii and on my Gamecube and both discs were a no go. Traded it in for another Copy and same deal. I took it back and got a Vita instead. Later I came across another Copy on Ebay and bought it. Glad I did because like Resident Evil 2 this copy looked like someone bought it opened it up and returned it. Plays wonderfully too.   So yeah, Tales of Symphonia and The Resident Evil Series, My Favorite games in my collection."

For the longest time all that was available was indigo or onyx (black),  they released a teal controller in japan, and a spice (orange) system and controller, and that was about it except for a few rare exceptions, but yea, you got the right thing."

It's a surprisingly good rule of thumb for the GameCube.  The GameCube was a pretty low-selling system.

I've definitely had bad experience with third party controllers. Nothing but good from Nintendo.  Edit:Oops sorry I thought it was a cube controller not PC my bad

Gamecube,2ubx08,graycountertop,1 point,Sat Jan 31 23:48:23 2015 UTC,Very cheap plastic and buttons. The handles gave me a rash. Best solution for using a gamecube controller on a pc is to use the wii u adapter or the mayflash wii u adapter.
Gamecube,2uc9uu,JCSuperAwesome,1 point,Sat Jan 31 21:11:27 2015 UTC,"480p looks good on either a CRT or LCD, and is up to personal preference, but some games (like F-Zero) support widescreen and you'll probably want an LCD for those since widescreen tubes are a nightmare to move and you'd pretty much need a concrete slab for a TV stand.  As for whether to use the Wii or GC to play with, just hook up both to the same TV and test them out for yourself (remember to hold down B when you start the GC to run in 480p). If you don't see much difference between them, it might be worth it to sell the GC cable while prices are high. The proprietary digital signal that made it impossible to replicate the GC cables (the cable actually has a special digital to analog converter chip) was decoded by two people independently last year, and I wouldn't  be surprised if someone started making them or at least opened a Kickstarter for them sometime this year given the sudden spike in demand for them. Capitalize on that while you can, OP, or enjoy the Gameboy player in delicious progressive scan. You're certainly lucky to have those cables."
Gamecube,2uc9uu,SturgeonMcGuai,1 point,Mon Feb 2 05:31:35 2015 UTC,Well then here's the next question. I live in the UK and have a PAL Gamecube. When you start up games it gives you the option of 50hz or 60hz. Is there anyway to activate a progressive scan mode or is that just if you use NTSC games?
Gamecube,2uc9uu,SturgeonMcGuai,1 point,Mon Feb 2 09:07:53 2015 UTC,"PAL games had progressive scan capabilities ""removed"" and you'd need to find a work-around like this homebrew utility to force games into it, though there are loads of incompatibility issues. I'd recommend you either get an NTSC console or get an RGB cable and sell the component cable for some games. You might also be able to mod/get a modded cube, but don't know anything about those."
Gamecube,2uc9uu,evertrooftop,0,Mon Feb 2 16:22:11 2015 UTC,"If you already have component on the wii, I don't really see the benefit."
Gamecube,2uc9uu,Everkeen,3,Sat Jan 31 21:33:58 2015 UTC,That's wrong. There are quite clear comparisons between the wii and gamecube on component with the gamecube looking better. Look here: http://retrorgb.com/gamecubevswii.html
Gamecube,2uc9uu,AnonTriesReddit,3,Sat Jan 31 21:48:04 2015 UTC,There are quite clear comparisons between the wii and gamecube   Out of focus photographs of an LCD screen are not a clear comparison. Capture video if you want to do a comparison.
Gamecube,2uc9uu,essoair,4,Sat Jan 31 23:00:08 2015 UTC,Captured video is equally at the descretion of the software and hardware used. The only way to truly tell is IRL
Gamecube,2uc9uu,AnonTriesReddit,2,Sun Feb 1 08:01:22 2015 UTC,"As long as the same capturing hardware is used and the footage is rendered using the same settings in the same software, the comparison would be accurate. Yes, you'd have to trust whoever handled the footage to not swap it or make it appear misleading like that retrorgb link, but there's really no reason to do that, barring trying to sell a cable or justify purchasing one, so I don't see your point, and you're offering an impractical solution to a simple problem."

Gamecube,2ts3t7,YoshiYogurt,4,Tue Jan 27 02:41:22 2015 UTC,"Gamecubes are cheap, but you'll need a CRT wii's are a little more expensive, but they won't break a budget and you still need a CRT Dolphin is great if you have a good CPU and a controller adapter (I suggest Mayflash)   Extra     If you get a gamecube, you can put a xenoGC chip in it to let it play backups (including mods like 20XX) If you get a wii, you can softmod it to load .iso files from a USB or SD card Dolphin in general will let you have more options, more control, and sometimes better looking games, while sacrificing the ""genuine-ness"" of an actual gamecube"

It's much more portable than the Wii, more simple, and probably cheaper. If you got it for PC, you'd have to worry about controller drivers and stuff like that."

Gamecube,2ts3t7,essoair,1 point,Tue Jan 27 05:08:51 2015 UTC,"The Wii and Gamecube are at 30fps and I think the Wii U runs at a simulated 60fps but really it's only 30fps and Wii U all run at 60fps. If you're not willing to buy a GC component cable (and that's perfectly understandable) just get a Wii and buy the component for it. It's the best bang for your buck when it comes to GC games! If you have a nice computer, Dolphin is also a good option but personally I find the controller input to be laggy. On the flip side though you can run games at 1080p which looks killer on an HDTV"

Gamecube,2ts3t7,essoair,0,Tue Jan 27 02:39:35 2015 UTC,Ya sorry about that. I'll fix the post. For some reason I missed that up until now
Gamecube,2ts3t7,essoair,1 point,Tue Jan 27 02:41:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. So what difference does the component cable make for the gc and the wii?
Gamecube,2ts3t7,essoair,3,Tue Jan 27 00:22:05 2015 UTC,"For both you'll get a lot better quality video. But ironically enough, they're essentially the same console and if it wasn't for some stupid decisions by Nintendo, the Wii would have the exact same video quality as the GC. (they could have easily just included the chipset found since the GC's component cable into the Wii itself so the cables wouldnt be so hard to produce on their end) When they made the Wii they for some stupid reason decided not to upgrade the hardware, all they did was overclock it. So the video output is the same resolution (actually they did have to add a few things but its essentially the same) BUT they thought ""this is the future so people dont want to see pixels anymore"" and instead of just putting a better GPU in there, they just added this video post-processor that blurs all the lines and makes things fuzzy. From a distance and on a smaller TV, you dont really notice. But if video is important to you, you immediately notice how poor the picture quality is. The component cables look good and they do output full 480p, but the lines are all fuzzy and the colors are a bit washed out. Finer details, especially in GC games, just get lackadaisically blended together leaving you with improper color reproduction and smaller details all but disappearing! On the GC however, none of this weird post processing occurs so while it's only running at a max of 480p, the lines are sharp, the colors are vibrant, and the details are all present to the best of it's ability. That being said, the difference is only major to those that care about it (such as myself). If it doesnt matter to you, the Wii + component cable + 3 extra controllers + a few games is cheaper than just the GC's component cable alone. Now, if you want to play Wii games but want the sharpness of the GC, you can hack a Wii U to play GC games and it outputs video that rivals the GC's component cables. The colors are slightly less vibrant, but that can be fixed in the TV's settings (just up the contrast a smidge). The added bonus? The Wii U also plays Wii and Wii U games and all of those games (including GC) can be streamed to the Wii U gamepad with minimal latency so you can play them anywhere in your house, not just the TV, assuming you have a good signal on your wavebird (get the one with 900mhz not the 2.4ghz one -- better range and wall penetration). But after all that? You can still just play games on Dolphin for free and at 1080p! So the only real reasons not to use dolphin would be input lag (nothing beats the GC with a wired controller and a CRT tv) and nostalgia (whichever console gives you the most ""feels"")  Any questions?"
Gamecube,2ts3t7,essoair,1 point,Tue Jan 27 00:40:44 2015 UTC,"Wow! Thanks for all the help. That's basically all the information I could need. The hard part is just figuring out exactly what I really want/how much I want to pay now. But really, thanks a lot for writing all that.  So when you said you can hack the Wii U to play GC games, are you talking about nintendont? Also you mentioned that the GC and Wii run at 30 fps, and the Wii U at 60 fps. Is this even with the component cable? Because after searching around a bit, I found some people saying they ran games at 60. Is it just melee that can only run at 30 fps?"

Gamecube,2tkuuz,essoair,-1,Sun Jan 25 03:05:11 2015 UTC,"Yet again, while the GC has slightly better color reproduction than the Wii U, the difference is more in the advantage of no input lag with a real GC while the Wii U has to upscale it to 1080p, then once the TV get the signal over HDMI, it has to reprocess it again before being displayed which can take a lot of time.  But for the casual player? I can happily say that the GC does indeed live on in the Wii U"
Gamecube,2tkuuz,Socksfelloff,5,Sun Jan 25 03:07:36 2015 UTC,You're definetly a little off on what happens lol.   Upscaling isn't what causes input delay. De interlacing is what causes the input delay but since an HDTV would be fed a progressive signal on 95% of GC games there is no de interlacing taking place.   Post processing will cause some input delay but any decent TV has a game mode to disable this but then you still have to battle the inherit input lag of your display. There are some newer TV/monitors that are getting real close to CRT like input response.  And finally don't forget you can use Wii component cables on your wiiu and output at 480p just like the cube ;) I should do a comparison of that as well.
Gamecube,2tkuuz,Garbagehead4,0,Sun Jan 25 05:13:03 2015 UTC,"You're a little off too.   There's usually 4 factors that go into input lag on HDTVs: upscaling, deinterlacing, post processing, and analog-to-digital conversion."
Gamecube,2tkuuz,Socksfelloff,2,Tue Jan 27 01:03:53 2015 UTC,A proper upscaler causes no input lag
Gamecube,2ti70x,essoair,3,Sat Jan 24 11:22:31 2015 UTC,"It's possible in the NES and SNES because those old consoles wired the cartridge ports right into the CPU bus.

The N64 actually can't do save states via a cart, so it's not just a cart vs. disc thing."
Gamecube,2ti70x,xamphear,3,Sat Jan 24 15:35:13 2015 UTC,That didn't seem patronizing at all.  I thought it was patronizing of you to explain what a save state was.

Gamecube,2tf75q,Itellsadstories,3,Fri Jan 23 17:54:53 2015 UTC,"Well even if they looked identical, the advantage that the GC still has is response time. Analog signal + CRT tv = instant button response! This is great for speedrunning which Im trying to get in to. Also, I have a lot of nostalgia for the GC.

Gamecube,2tf75q,essoair,2,Fri Jan 23 18:01:17 2015 UTC,I've been doing that. I lay in bed with my gamepad and use my GC controller to play Xenoblade Chronicles. I have laziness maxed out.
Gamecube,2tf75q,Itellsadstories,2,Fri Jan 23 18:04:51 2015 UTC,"Running a digital, progressive, signal over hdmi can be almost as good as a crt in regards to input delay but its entirely dependant on your tv/monitor.  Something to keep in mind is that as amazing as nintendont is, its still locked within the wii mode boundaries which allows it to be displayed on the gamepad but not controlled."
Gamecube,2tf75q,essoair,1 point,Fri Jan 23 19:41:07 2015 UTC,I tried stopping it at several frames on the original capture on my color correct monitor and to me the colors actually seem deeper and more vibrant on the GC which is very surprising to me .

Gamecube,2tdsg3,Socksfelloff,9,Fri Jan 23 14:22:17 2015 UTC,This is incorrect. Any game will see an improvement in visual quality because the component cables seperate the luminance and colors rather then ramming them all into 1 cable.

Gamecube,2sxyp1,PrismHelix,1 point,Mon Jan 19 17:27:05 2015 UTC,This is a good temporary solution.  But it also makes the laser go out faster tried this on my ps2 and it gave me an extra 6 months of game play.

Gamecube,2scygl,vomitwolf,8,Wed Jan 14 03:09:49 2015 UTC,"Melee.  You can't truly experience the GameCube without Melee.  Resident Evil (REmake) is the best the traditional survival horror genre has to offer.  Also one of best looking games on the console.  Zero is a decent entry to the series as well if you're looking for something that's completely exclusive to the console.  Pikmin is definitely one of the most unique experiences you'll have on the GameCube.  Excellent strategy/puzzle game with a pretty emotional story told through some surprisingly deep journal entries.   Double Dash is one of my absolute favorite Mario Kart games, but it seems to get a fair amount of hate.  Definitely worth getting if you like the series, though.  Blue Storm and F-Zero GX are some other really great racing games.  Wind Waker is one of the best Zelda experiences. You're in for a real treat if you're a fan of the series and haven't played this yet.  Ikaruga if you like shmups that are hard as shit.  Eternal Darkness is definitely worth checking out if you like the horror genre.  I think the GameCube has the best Mario Party games.  4 is my favorite in the series.  5 is really good, too.  Super Mario Strikes is another Mario games that's a ton of fun and a bit underrated."
Gamecube,2scygl,tpop_loop,1 point,Wed Jan 14 07:47:20 2015 UTC,"All on my radar for sure man... Melee is one I'm definitely looking to get. The Mario Party games are absolutely on my must have list too. REmake, awesome - Resident Evil is right up my alley. Double Dash, definitely - watching a copy of that on eBay too. I have Pikmin 3 on the WiiU and it's also the first Pikmin game I've played, I have to say I'm a little underwhelmed? Is 1 any better? Super Mario Strikers is not something I'd normally play but actually looks really fun. Eternal Darkness definitely... You seem to have pretty similar taste to me so thanks for the solid recommendations man! Now to try find some copies that aren't like $99..."
Gamecube,2scygl,tpop_loop,2,Wed Jan 14 10:50:22 2015 UTC,"Can't speak for Pikmin 3 as I've only ever played 1 and 2, but part of what makes the first game so special for is the story.  Olimar's journal entries in the original are fascinating; you get to see his full range of emotions as he fears for his life and learns about the new world around him. A lot of people don't like the time limit but I thought it paced the game perfectly and just works so well with the story.  It's probably in my top 3 games for the system, but Pikmin is definitely not a series that everybody seems to enjoy."
Gamecube,2scygl,tpop_loop,1 point,Sat Jan 17 22:15:30 2015 UTC,"Also, Windwaker is one I've been really on the fence about... I own a WiiU and have been umming and aahing about it since the HD release. I seem to gravitate towards the weirder Zelda games, Majora's Mask being my top Zelda game... It just seems a bit cartoony? I don't know. I should play it."
Gamecube,2scygl,aaronglazer,1 point,Wed Jan 14 10:53:13 2015 UTC,It looks cartoony but it's a cartoon that you can control.  I'll never forget running around Outset Island for the first time and how much the visuals blew my mind.  It's just as beautiful to look at and control as it was in 2003.

Gamecube,2s3yru,McJubal,1 point,Mon Jan 12 00:55:54 2015 UTC,"The Pokemon games have always been on my mind. I'd totally go for Phantasy Star, but I generally see them too expensive these days, but I will one day get them! Custom Robo I have been hunting after for a while now.

Gamecube,2qvcl8,CatstewGaming,3,Wed Dec 31 00:45:12 2014 UTC,"The Dolphin emulator supports texture dumping.  Generally, if you load up Sunshine with the setting enabled, all textures displayed/loaded will be dumped to a folder.  Go to an area you want dumped, and they'll end up on your hard drive (I believe in PNG, but don't quote me).  Alternatively, from what I can recall when I would dump GameCube games, Sunshine's textures were all in BTI format and not really hidden (as in, you don't have to root through horrible file formats outside of szs).  So, if you have a backup made yourself of Sunshine, extracting textures is rather easy.  Extract the szs archives and convert the BTI files into something managable (the converter I've used makes them DDS).  Thakis made a bunch of tools to do this; search his name and you should find his website with downloads for all this."

Gamecube,2pfuro,freypod007,1 point,Tue Dec 16 06:37:32 2014 UTC,"Let me see if I can find my tutorial I wrote a couple months back. I don't post that often so it shouldn't take long.  EDIT: Found it and made some adjustments  Here's my process for painting my GameCube consoles and controllers: NOTE: I'll say this now since it'll get lost in the text. I only sand before I start painting, and when I find specks of dust/trash/etc that lands on a coat while it's being painted or drying. I use 1000 grit for the primer, the base, and the main color. 1500 or 2000 for the clear coat. You don't have to sand every time, you only need to sand if before you start, the gamecube has some dings/scratches. And while you're waiting for it to dry, inspect the paint if it has a bit of texture/dust on it. Like I said before, I'm more of a visual explainer than a verbal one.   Before you start, you must completely disassmble, clean, and sand the console/controller. I use between 600-1000 grit when sanding. I scuff it first, then make everything even with 1000, then slightly scuff it again. After sanding, clean it one more time, let it dry, and it's ready to be painted. 2 coats of Primer, both are medium coats. With the primer I use, XIM 400 White primer, I typically wait a day or two for it to dry so it can adhere properly (It's worth the wait because the bond will become very strong). This is what I use, it's pretty expensive though: https://go.o-geepaint.com/products/spray-xim-white-primer-sealer%7CXI30081.html I normally get it from my local paint store, it costs around 10 there. Sometimes if they're out of stock, it can be upwards of 20 at other stores. NOTE: IGNORE THIS IF YOU'RE USING A PAINT THAT IS A PAINT+PRIMER COMBO SUCH AS http://www.lowes.com/pd_416282-4-410.0086011.076_0__?Ntt=orange+maple+gloss&UserSearch=orange+maple+gloss&productId=4138893&rpp=32 2-3 coats of the base color, IF the base coat I want isn't white. Typically wait about an hour between coats. I normally use the .99 cent black or gray MATTE spray paint at Walmart. I use matte because gloss is a PAIN to paint over. Once you add the last coat, let it heal for 24 hours. NOTE: IGNORE THIS IF YOU'RE USING A PAINT THAT IS A PAINT+PRIMER COMBO SUCH AS http://www.lowes.com/pd_416282-4-410.0086011.076_0__?Ntt=orange+maple+gloss&UserSearch=orange+maple+gloss&productId=4138893&rpp=32 2-4 coats of the main color. I normally get my paint from Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, or Autozone (if I want to paint with metallic since automotive paint is very durable). Again, about an hour between coats. The first coat is a light coat, with the coats gradually get more dense. But not too dense where the paint starts to run. Try and use either Krylon or Rustoleum paint. Not like you won't find it wherever you go because they're typically the go-to spray paint. Once you add the last coat, let it heal for 24 hours. Of course, you can save some time and use the Paint+Primer spray paint. I won't cover this yet in this tutorial since I haven't experimented with it yet.  Finally, 4-8 coats of clear coat enamel. I normally do 4 coats if I'm using a gloss enamel, 4-6 if I'm doing a controller. Or 4-8 coats if I'm using matte. An hour between coats is best and about medium coats throughout. Be careful with using matte clear coat, you have to look carefully to see if you're spraying evenly, because it's very easy for the paint to not be distributed evenly. Here's my choice for gloss: http://www.rustoleum.com/product-catalog/consumer-brands/stops-rust/crystal-clear-enamel/ And I'm still experimenting with matte clear, but here's my current go-to pick: http://www.rustoleum.com/product-catalog/consumer-brands/painters-touch-ultra-cover-2x/clear Right after adding the clear coat, let the pieces sit, wherever you're sitting them, for about a few days to a week so the clear coat and heal properly. This is where painting is tough for some because they'll assemble the console after the hour has passed. I've done that from time, and I'll normally mess it up somehow because the paint has only healed for about an hour. If everything was done correctly, it is possible that everything can be reassembled after about 8 hours. But I wouldn't risk it, since this only happened to me once when I painted a wavebird.    Knowing how to do this was natural for me, my dad is a housepainter with 25+ years experience, and I work with him part-time so the knowledge rubbed off onto me. If I ever have time, I'll make some how-to videos. Again if you have any questions, let me know and I'll gladly help."

I'm planning on painting a Wii racing wheel eventually for my favorite character Wario. After I bought the Mario and Luigi versions I decided a Wario version should be created.

(Honestly almost anything is better than a GBA screen)  I also like to use the game boy player for games where you would need a little more focus on the details. Metroid zero mission and fusion, fire emblem sacred stones, and Zelda link to the past come to mind as games that benefit from a bigger screen to see the little things."

This washes out a lot of the color, and also bleeds a lot of light in random directions out from the screen.   There was a model of SPs that had an improved backlight system that was essentially the same as the top screen of a DS. The GameBoy Micro also had an excellently sharp, colorful display, but it was TINY.   The biggest advantage of the Gameboy Player was easily its screen size and more colorful picture."

My brother received a gamecube in 2002 as a christmas present; it was the black model, so came with a matching black controller. He also got a Orange spice controller, which was technically a present for me (dick move, parents...) (I was 8 years older and my N64 and SNES were pawned and I was expecting the mback for christmas... yes, we were poor and it sucked) but was pretty much his. Anyway, years pass and his gamecube doesn't work for years. I get a job and decide at some point ot buy a GC. I get a purple one and 4 off-brand controllers. My brother gave me the gamecube stuff he had left (except the GC itself,  I think it got tossed).   Fast forward to today. I have two working controllers- the original GC Black and Orange controllers.  All the aftermarket controllers I bought died. They either stopped working or pieces fell off (such as the rubber on the control stick) that made them a PITA to use properly. They are now spare parts controllers."
Gamecube,2o317z,BCProgramming,3,Wed Dec 3 01:28:09 2014 UTC,I really like the wave bird. I have some awful awful third party controllers. To the point that my initial reaction to the game cube was really negative. Turns out it was the controller. The GameStop? one was not good at all.

Gamecube,2o02n2,Storjie,3,Tue Dec 2 03:50:37 2014 UTC,Kind of lot :/ $60 but I was holding it in my hands and could see how minty and complete it was so I went for it. I had to pick my jaw up from the floor when I was looking through the GC section and all I see is the spine of it amongst all the $5 that surround it. I knew this would probably be my only chance I would ever have of getting it and it was a lot better price than I saw it going for at around $90 on amazon.   It was at my favorite local shop Game Exchange. It's a small chain here in the south that only buys and sells preowned. Apparently someone unloaded their collection because that was the best I've ever seen their Gamecube section. I also picked up Custom Robo.

Gamecube,2nw5w6,samishal,4,Tue Dec 2 07:35:28 2014 UTC,mario party for sure!
Gamecube,2nw5w6,somekindawizard1,5,Mon Dec 1 02:33:18 2014 UTC,"chibi-robo is a very good game. it's very casual, slow-paced, and relaxing. def something a fan of animal crossing would enjoy"
Gamecube,2nw5w6,ice-king,3,Mon Dec 1 02:33:21 2014 UTC,"My two favourite game at that age were sonic heroes and mario sunshine. I think they are both good ways to introduce the style of the ganecube, plus theyre awesome. You can usually find each for about $10-$15. That's my suggestion."
Gamecube,2nw5w6,butteryT,2,Mon Dec 1 08:03:39 2014 UTC,Super Monkey Ball and Pikmin are two great series that are relatively easy to get into and will capture the interest of children via bright colours and sounds. :)
Gamecube,2nw5w6,Gargogly,3,Mon Dec 1 20:25:33 2014 UTC,Except when the pikmin drown and she bursts into tears and refuses to get anywhere near the game again! Source: I saw it happen
Gamecube,2nw5w6,Gargogly,1 point,Tue Dec 2 21:33:18 2014 UTC,"That seems like the kind of thing she'd do. Thanks for the advice!  I already have Pikmin anyways, so if she ever wants to play, she can just borrow it."
Gamecube,2nw5w6,theonlyboomer,1 point,Wed Dec 3 23:23:20 2014 UTC,"Actually she enjoys the first stage, the one without time limit and where the field has no ""hazards"" for the pikmin, that's quite entertaining for a kid even if boring for a grownup (especially when you run out of things to do)"

Gamecube,2nm0dx,Super_Famicom,5,Thu Nov 27 21:25:43 2014 UTC,"It's a habit here too. I doubt you can, and I'd like to promise that but my controller isn't perfect after all these years."
Gamecube,2nm0dx,lazenbooby,1 point,Thu Nov 27 21:46:19 2014 UTC,"It's not damaging to the controller at all. It's simply lifting up the thumbstick from the actual mechanism about a millimeter. Without that millimeter of space, it would be really hard to move the thumbstick."
Gamecube,2nm0dx,luigi1fan1,1 point,Fri Nov 28 00:02:22 2014 UTC,And the reason why you can lift it up is so you can replace the thumbsticks if you need.
Gamecube,2nm0dx,luigi1fan1,-15,Fri Nov 28 00:03:11 2014 UTC,Actually this is a sign of wear. You are not supposed to do this. If you can fibd one that doesnt this play with the joysticj you will feel a huge difference.    When the joystick is pushed in the rubber can actually rub against the plastic of the cobtroller making it less responsive.
Gamecube,2nm0dx,Steve50013,3,Thu Nov 27 22:04:35 2014 UTC,Are you sure? I did this with a brand new official White GC controller.
Gamecube,2nm0dx,Steve50013,-10,Thu Nov 27 22:20:59 2014 UTC,I'm fairly certain. If you ever get one that doesn't do this and compare the two. To me my controllers have become like this if they get dropped or had something dropped on them.
Gamecube,2nm0dx,Eaglebloo,9,Thu Nov 27 22:26:42 2014 UTC,That's not true.  Nintendo official controllers are all supposed to be able to pop up and down.  It allows for players to easily remove the analog stick when they open up the controller. It has nothing to do with the quality of the controllers.  And if your controllers don't allow you to do this you might want to open up your controllers because they might be stuck.
Gamecube,2nm0dx,GILLHUHN,3,Thu Nov 27 22:35:23 2014 UTC,This is true and it goes for more than just Nintendo controllers as well its just how the joy sticks are designed they aren't glued in or anything to allow you to replace the sticks should the break or get worn out.
Gamecube,2nm0dx,Steve50013,-6,Fri Nov 28 00:47:37 2014 UTC,"What the fuck do I know then. Not like I have only gone through numerous controllers and have repaired a good handful or anything.    On a non sarcastic note I would make a video of what I'm talking about if I could, would be next to impossible to show it though sadly."
Gamecube,2nm0dx,pathartl,1 point,Fri Nov 28 05:04:57 2014 UTC,"Nah Steve, this is just the sliding motion of the stick on the shaft of the analog stick. You can do it on any pot-based analog stick."
Gamecube,2njrva,LA_Red1,15,Thu Nov 27 04:33:49 2014 UTC,"in my opinion, Wind Waker is one of the best games ever made. enjoy!"

I recall being blown away by its art style and colorful and expressive characters.  Mind you I also remember the naysayers; the ones who called it childish looking.  I never listened to those guys, not once."
Gamecube,2njrva,twdalbeck,2,Thu Nov 27 06:03:19 2014 UTC,I'm in the Earth Temple right now. First Zelda game I've played for more than a couple of hours. Amazing game. I'm playing it on the Wii U because I got it free with Mario Kart 8. I just got Twilight Princess for GameCube on eBay so that's next up.

Gamecube,2njrva,muzog,4,Thu Nov 27 09:05:38 2014 UTC,On the console? Melee is the greatest multiplayer game ever.
Gamecube,2njrva,mfranko88,2,Thu Nov 27 17:21:55 2014 UTC,"Cant speak for Sonic, but the others are all in my top 20 of all time.  Shit, take out Luigi and you might have most of my top five of all time.  I fucking love those games."

Gamecube,2njrva,AnotherChocobo,2,Thu Nov 27 15:46:52 2014 UTC,You could try posting over at /r/retrogameswap and see if anybody has a copy they're willing to let go for less than full market value.
Gamecube,2njrva,muzog,2,Thu Nov 27 17:03:20 2014 UTC,I got a copy last summer at a used game store. It was like $20.

Gamecube,2nl5n8,LA_Red1,1 point,Thu Nov 27 18:33:53 2014 UTC,"They're actually located a few minutes from where I live, so I pick things up directly from the showroom.

I recently picked up a model 2 SNES there, and I will never know how used it may have truly been."

Gamecube,2ni64n,pzonee,6,Wed Nov 26 19:18:13 2014 UTC,Taking apart the controller is really easy. You only need to find the right screwdriver to open it. I cleaned one today with rubbing alcohol and the buttons are much better now. Without opening it up it will be pretty difficult to clean the rubber pads behind the button so not sure if not opening it will help your situation.
Gamecube,2ni64n,xiviajikx,4,Wed Nov 26 22:00:43 2014 UTC,"I'm not a repair thing kind of guy, but taking this apart to clean buttons is so easy.  It's pretty much impossible to ruin one while cleaning it."

That is, unless I play Custom Robo and have a 2nd controller plugged in that isn't official. That'll make it real noisy and then it'll overheat. No idea why, but that's what happens.

Gamecube,2nhjcc,TalentedLobster,-11,Wed Nov 26 16:10:49 2014 UTC,The huge A button and the tiny B button don't seem perfect to me. And don't get me started on the X and Y buttons. It's the absolute worst for Smash. The only ones who use it are Meleefags who can't accept different things.
Gamecube,2nhjcc,masterdisaster77,3,Wed Nov 26 17:34:43 2014 UTC,You clearly don't know what you're talking about. There's a reason high level tournament players choose the gamecube controller and never deviate. It is literally perfect for smash brothers. The fact that you don't play the game competitively is enough for your opinion to be disregarded. Get off your high horse.

The y/x buttons are perfect for jumping since you have the option to move your thumb up or to the right, unlike the pro controller. Much easier to short hop as well.  lol ""melee fags""   I think I'm just gonna ignore that. You do know that you're on the GAMECUBE subreddit? We are going to love the gamecube controller and gasp the smash bros game that is on that system!"
Gamecube,2nhjcc,CoryZ40,-4,Wed Nov 26 18:15:59 2014 UTC,I feel really bad for everyone who grew up with a Gamecube and a copy of Melee. If you weren't all so dumb to accept different and better things you wouldn't be like this.

And really, most of them won't want to play Gamecube games. They will want to play current multiplayer games such as the Wii U or PS4 or they won't really want to play at all. That or they will want to do other activities such as board games or whatever. If you really think about it, you have to buy 3 more controllers and you have to hope people will want to play 480i quality graphics. I mean they can, but it's very unlikely.  As far as singleplayer goes, this makes more sense to play because unlike multiplayer, it really can't be outdated. I mean some games are clearly outdated such as Madden 2015 versus Madden 2005. However you can't really say a game like... Mario Sunshine is because it's its own game. Unless they make Mario Sunshine HD, the Gamecube version is the only version, therefore it makes sense to buy if you like it.  Good luck."

If you buy some obscure game from the 2000's, people will not know of it and will prefer playing a newer, better looking title over the older one. Of course it is entirely possible that the OP has a group of people that is willing to play these old games, but I'd bet that he, like myself and most other gamers, do not have that situation. With that said, to save the OP money, I am suggesting he avoid those games that are of value because of their multiplayer capabilities. A game like Super Smash Bros. Melee would be a lot less attractive if it is only played for its singleplayer mode.  I am then saying if you are hellbent on getting a Gamecube, singleplayer titles would be a more worthwhile choice because the value of those titles do not hinge on whether you have an audience to play the games with or not. I am also suggesting that he buy games on it that aren't already re-released on consoles he has. So if he has a Wii U, perhaps he should stick with the Wind Waker version on that, rather than buying the Gamecube version."
Gamecube,2n8cea,nkcrothers,1 point,Wed Dec 3 16:14:24 2014 UTC,"Dude, why even post this.  Completely useless. Also this is the gamecube subreddit. Come on man!"
Gamecube,2n8cea,AmuseDeath,2,Mon Dec 15 21:30:47 2014 UTC,"I don't know man. There probably is absolutely zero reason to what I wrote. I mean I must have rolled my face onto the keyboard and some random stuff just happened to pop out on the screen!  But since you commented, I shall reply back:   Your parameters are way too broad.   Because... it is broad. We can literally list any game on the system.   What are some, fun, preferably cheap GameCube games that are worth picking up? single or multiplayer is great.    This can apply to every single game out there on the Gamecube. What's the point of recommending if every game is recommendable?   As far as multiplayer goes, it's all about what the people around you want to play. And really, most of them won't want to play Gamecube games. They will want to play current multiplayer games such as the Wii U or PS4 or they won't really want to play at all.   It seems many of you including yourself are offended by what I wrote here. But we need to read carefully. What I'm saying is that if you meet any random gamer out there, they are probably playing the latest and greatest multiplayer games. Smash Bros. U. Call of Duty Advanced Warfare. Ultra Street Fighter 4. Destiny. And so on.  Digging up your old Gamecube and hoping to get people to play it is probably hard to do, or impossible. I never have people around locally to play video games with and when I do, it's usually the latest game out there. You would need to find very specific people who are willing to play games that are 8-10 years old. People aren't going to want to play Smash Bros. Melee when they have Smash U around. It's common sense.  Games that are multiplayer focused are just that... best with multiplayer. Smash Bros. Melee is a fun game, but 90% of the joy to the game is playing it with other people around you. That's why I'm saying it's probably not wise to pick up multiplayer focused Gamecube games because it will be hard to find people to play with.  So that's why I told him to focus on singleplayer games like Twilight Princess, Wind Waker, Metroid Prime and so on. These games only require yourself to play the game and they don't suffer if you lack people around to play against. If he has to choose between buying a singleplayer game and a multiplayer oriented game, he would be better off with the former.  So to restate what I said...   It is going to be hard to find people to play 8-10 year old Gamecube games with due to modern games being out. Multiplayer oriented games on the Gamecube are at their best when played with many people. Therefore if #1 is true, it is unlikely that you will be able to play multiplayer oriented Gamecube games at their best. If that is true, it is better to focus on singleplayer oriented games."
Gamecube,2n8cea,nkcrothers,1 point,Mon Dec 15 22:12:39 2014 UTC,"The guy originally wanted to get some suggestions about gamecube games.  The reason people are bashing you is because you wrote this long comment about how people aren't going to want to play with him because it's an old system.  Which literately made absolutely no sense. If he already has a gamecube and just wants some game suggestions, why even leave a comment like that? We don't need to hear why he will have nobody playing with him. Or whatever your point was."
Gamecube,2n6t51,SuperCashBrother,7,Sun Nov 23 19:28:50 2014 UTC,"Nope. There's a special chip or something in the cables that has made them impossible to duplicate. I think I heard something recently about someone reverse engineering the chip, but I don't think they had any plans to make and sell new cables. I just use my wii with component to play Cube games and I got some S-video cables ($10-15) for my gamecube with game boy player.

The directional pad is not a joystick, it's basically the ""+"" directional pad on the GCN controller. If you use this controller for Smash, you won't be able to move your character because the D-Pad is used for taunting."

The rubber pad between the buttons and the board become worn with use; the wear makes them less prone to rebounding from a press or resisting a press and yea they become less 'clicky'.  I bet if you were to take the pad out of the controller you liked and put it in a different controller...you'd feel the difference in the new controller

He won't know whether they will budge on price unless he asks and finds out. If the store isn't a chain, there is a good chance they will budge on price a reasonable amount. Especially for an expensive item that is obviously priced much higher than normal FMV. I have seen this game for $65 recently at a local retail store. My guess is the owner priced it assuming a buyer would negotiate down.   I personally would not want to buy from a store that had such high prices without the opportunity to negotiate down to a reasonable price."

The buttons feel stale, the triggers slow, the control stick rubber usually falls of, and they feel light and cheap. I guess if your playing a game that doesn't require much input like and RPG or turn based game they are ok, but I would not suggest it for any games that require lots of movement (Melee for example).  Edit: Sorry, didn't read the whole thing. I've thought about replacing the shells to. You could try it but like I said, the plastic feels less sturdy. Also I don't know if they fit the same way. If you try it, let me know what the results are like. Also, read the Amazon review, they say similar stuff, maybe even a bit harsher."

If you've never played PSO before, I think it's aged pretty well, and will be fun to play.  The only thing that sucks about online is communication.  If you play with friends, call them up on a voice service.

I just finished softmodding my wii though so I'm sort of tempted to just sell everything and play backups on the wii.
Gamecube,2kcuky,duroba,6,Sun Oct 26 11:45:45 2014 UTC,The only pricey one I have left is Pokemon Box and it is hardly a game... After that I think everything else I'm missing is about $30 or under.

Gamecube,2kcuky,duroba,1 point,Mon Oct 27 01:29:27 2014 UTC,Yeah I don't really like paying more than what the game was worth brand new at release. I died a little on the inside paying that much for a sports game.
Gamecube,2kcuky,bigted41,2,Fri Nov 21 22:36:25 2014 UTC,"I just paid $70 for Conkers on N64. I guess with inflation I technically didn't pay more haha. Either way it's worth it in my book. Of course it isn't a 10 year old sports title, but still, at least the rare game isn't also super fun, or else you'd pay out the nose to fill out the gamecube collection which right now at least is a reasonably cheap console to get a complete NA release collection for."

Gamecube,2k98dv,abcdeline,2,Sat Oct 25 02:48:36 2014 UTC,Take the disk to a retro shop. See if it works on their machine. This would make sure it's not your machine. If it doesn't work on their machine then demand a refund on eBay. If the game doesn't work you are entitled to one. I did this with a copy of Sonic Adventure 2 that wouldn't load the 4th stage. Sellers on eBay care highly about their rep. They will do anything to make sure you give them good rep.

Gamecube,2k98dv,YoshiEgg25,1 point,Sat Oct 25 22:01:10 2014 UTC,"I'd suggest trying to clean the disc.

Gamecube,2k98dv,cjrobe,1 point,Sat Oct 25 05:51:54 2014 UTC,Do not do this! eBay buyer protection exists for a reason - why pay full price and then pay for the disc to be resurfaced.
Gamecube,2k6w4t,Forumpy,1 point,Fri Oct 24 12:41:49 2014 UTC,"To be honest, repairing internal controller parts is almost always not worth the trouble even if it is remotely possible. It sounds like it's simply worn out and doesn't go back to original position as fast as it once did.   Having a spare parts controller is definitely worth it, you can get one for around $10 or under if you're lucky.  Example: www.ebay.com/itm/Official-Nintendo-Indigo-Purple-Gamecube-Controller-DOL-003-For-Parts-/281476565594  On a side note, while looking for a cheap controller to link to you, I just got two Wavebirds for ~$9 a piece shipped with no receivers :)."
Gamecube,2k6w4t,cjrobe,0,Fri Oct 24 13:06:44 2014 UTC,Spare parts aren't a problem. I have many busted pads around from over the years. They're all different problems so each can be useful. I just want to know if it's worth fixing or just replacing.  Plus one of the screws connecting the shoulder and spring to the plastic is completely ruined. Don't think I'll be able to open that up.
Gamecube,2k6w4t,cjrobe,1 point,Fri Oct 24 13:13:24 2014 UTC,"Well, the ""click"" comes from the rubber piece on the underside of the shoulder button. I would visually inspect that aspect of the mechanism and compare it to other functioning controllers. Is the rubber piece being pressed out the same distance as other controllers? Is the rubber piece getting stuck and not popping back into position? Even if nothing is visually wrong, I would take out that rubber piece and clean it with soap and water, let it dry, and place it back in."
Gamecube,2k6w4t,Etrex,1 point,Fri Oct 24 15:38:58 2014 UTC,"I had a similar problem in one of my controllers. My brother opened it up and fiddled around, said something had gotten stuck in it. He pulled it out with tweezers and it works fine now."

It looks and plays exactly as my NTSC Windwaker. I personally dont own a copy of Doshin the Giant, but I know the image quality wont be affected by different region codes."
Gamecube,2jt1pw,BigRobotBil,1 point,Mon Oct 20 20:11:39 2014 UTC,"Practically all PAL games support 60Hz, so playing them on an NTSC console should be fine, as they'll be running at 60Hz (iirc, they'll autodetect, or at least prompt you to choose if you want 50Hz or 60Hz).  The only titles that don't are the launch titles in the PAL regions.  There is a list somewhere on what titles only support 50Hz, however I'm pretty sure it's limited to simply the launch games.  For instance, Luigi's Mansion PAL does not support 60Hz.  While you can boot it up, you are not going to get a picture on your television unless your TV manages to support NTSC 50Hz (or whatever the malformed output of the Gamecube will be).  I'm a rather large fan of LM, and the only decent way I could play it was through some trickery on a capture card.  Since that was too cumbersome, I ripped my disc and resorted to emulation.  I did some five second searching, and I'm getting mixed results on if the PAL version of Doshin supports 60Hz, so you may want to double check if it's actually supported.  If anything, someone has reported that the Gamecube homebrew Swiss can force it in 60Hz."

Unless you're talking about the Master Quest disk, in which case I'd agree. That's more of a collectors thing."
Gamecube,2jqbd3,rabiiiii,2,Mon Oct 20 03:08:50 2014 UTC,Paper mario is a fucking marathon. I've got 10+hrs into it and just got the third crystal star.

Alright personally I'd suggest cruising yard sales and thrift shops, neighbors and relatives collections, etc and picking things up cheap as you find them. GameCube games are still pretty cheap on the private market, as they're not yet old enough for people to just ask for a lot of money because they are old.  If you're looking for games to play ASAP, and they just gotta be off that list then, in no specific order-  Metroid Prime Mario Sunshine Mario Strikers  That should give you a fairly wide variety of gameplay. Do you just not like driving or flying games? I'm just curious as there are some serious gems you left off of that list, such as F-Zero GX, Rogue Squadron, and Starfox (NOT Starfox Adventure).  Anyways enjoy the Cube! I love this console."

Gamecube,2jqbd3,kite737,2,Mon Oct 20 02:51:43 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I'm going to go a weird route here and recommend you play Luigi's Mansion first, then Rogue Squadron, then whatever. I say this because Luigi's Mansion was a launch title for the system so you emulate what a LOT of people first booted up on the cube. Also, it is a good indication of just what makes the cube so interesting even by Nintendo standards, which is the uniqueness of the IP releases for the system. They really went different directions with a lot of their IP's and the new IP's they started were also very interesting (Pikmin, for instance). Frankly, it's also just a really fun game that doesn't involve a ton of in depth study to complete, which I see as a positive for an introductory game.  I say play rogue leader second because of basically all the reasons I listed for Luigi's mansion other than it being a unique take on a  Nintendo IP."

I've heard many good things about Luigi's Mansion and I never have been able to play it, as even with my friends that had a gamecube, we'd either play Slugfest or Melee. Despite that, I really like that thought of playing that soon and really getting a feel of what made the Gamecube stand out with their new directions that they took with their games and imo for the better.  Thanks for your recommendation man, I'm definitely going to take it into consideration.   I do play with my girlfriend, and while she hasn't played in a while, she's getting the hang of double dash again~ And I definitely will be getting eternal darkness when I can, because that game looks like it'll be an amazing horror/thriller experience."

Gamecube,2jqbd3,BitmapKid,2,Mon Oct 20 05:41:35 2014 UTC,I would definitely have to agree. It's different than its predecessors and also now its successors and I still think its the best and most original Mario Kart idea that they've had.
Gamecube,2jqbd3,nkcrothers,1 point,Mon Oct 20 05:48:39 2014 UTC,"From your list, definitely get Smash Bros. Melee and Metroid Prime. And Mario Sunshine, if you haven't played extensive amounts of other 3D Mario games (SM64/Galaxy).  If you have, for the last, get Ikaruga or Paper Mario, depending on which looks more like your kind of genre. I'll pull for Ikaruga, since it's pretty awesome and has unique gameplay for a shmup.  There's quite a bit of variety on your list (the GameCube is kind of awesome like that), so get stuff with the unique experiences. :)  LoZ: Wind Waker and Twilight Princess aren't on the list, but are also very good."

Worth every penny in my book, there's few better games for the girlfriend who isn't reflex gifted but loves racing. I drive, she shells. A systems age is often times indicative of the average price games for it will go for, but on a case by case basis, can be far off. Sometimes how fun the game is doesn't even factor in either. Look at NCAA on the gamecube. Rarity alone drives its price point."

Gamecube,2iviyt,cjrobe,1 point,Fri Oct 10 21:12:30 2014 UTC,"This is what I'd do, it's really not worth the trouble unless trouble interests you (which for me it totally does :P)."
Gamecube,2iviyt,SCHMITTAY,1 point,Sat Oct 11 00:39:15 2014 UTC,"The laser is probably starting to wear out. They do that after several years. If you have some tech expertise, you can replace the laser, if not you might be better off buying a new cube."

Gamecube,2irg7o,nekholm,2,Thu Oct 9 18:20:06 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure, I haven't seen a poll or anything, but for games that actively use the c-stick as the camera, I would sometimes miss or slip off the smaller c-stick."
Gamecube,2irg7o,nekholm,2,Thu Oct 9 16:44:49 2014 UTC,"I just think that the rubber nub is softer on your finger and you can also flick it faster. Of course people have different preferences, and I'm not sure I'd want both sticks to be like the c-stick, but I think the right one works."

Gamecube,2ilmdt,antxd1,2,Wed Oct 8 00:14:54 2014 UTC,"Out of curiosity, why not just buy el cheapo Walmart media shelves? $25 gets a shelf there that holds 180+ full size dvd cases (I know because I have 4 of them right now holding my game collection). Their footprint is only about 4 ft x 1 ft and they hold up okay. I realize some people don't want to advertise their collection and/or don't have a lot of space, but if you want your games to retain their value you need to keep ahold of the cases somewhere anyway... just my 2 cents.   Now lets talk about where to put all of the hardware boxes hahaha."
Gamecube,2ilmdt,duroba,1 point,Sun Oct 19 01:55:58 2014 UTC,"We're trying to consolidate space. All the cases are going in boxes, and those boxes are going into storage. We still have all our NES, N64, GC, Wii, WiiU, Xbox, Xbox360, PS1, PS2, and Gameboy games. Never tried to resell anything, we like going back and playing the classics. Although, it turns out we own more than one of a few of our games so I'll probably get to selling a copy of Kingdom Hearts 2 among others.   I dunno. For the longest time we've had our collection on display. It's really quite impressive. About a month ago I transferred all our WiiU games into a single case and my younger brothers have had an easier time putting the discs back. This just seems like a better option."
Gamecube,2ilmdt,duroba,1 point,Mon Oct 20 05:05:05 2014 UTC,"I see, I'd just go with larger cd binders then. Don't go too cheap or the backing will scratch up your discs. For display you could always design some really cool custom art for each system's binder spine/cover."
Gamecube,2ilmdt,cjrobe,1 point,Mon Oct 20 05:39:18 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's what we're doing, cool art and all :) but GameCube games fall out of the big cases so I need a smaller one for those. Nothings worse than putting all your games away, closing the case, zipping it, coming back later, and all the discs are loose."
Gamecube,2ik9wl,potatoguy,2,Tue Oct 7 14:36:29 2014 UTC,"That's pretty expensive actually. I just ordered 10 replacement joysticks from China for less than $7 including shipping.  http://www.aliexpress.com/item/left-Analog-Thumbstick-Thumb-left-Joystick-Cap-for-NGC-10pcs-lot/2030008086.html  Shipping ends up being $2.32 for me for Stone Age Gamer, so that's $5.32 for a pair of left and right joysticks. I guess if you needed it soon that might be your only option."
Gamecube,2ik9wl,cjrobe,2,Tue Oct 7 18:52:18 2014 UTC,"Sure, I will! I can guarantee they're the same as what Stone Age Gamer stocks, so if they sell them it must be half decent.  I'm guessing initial quality will be similar to original - I mean, it's a hunk of plastic with a grippy tip. I ordered 10 because I only needed 5 and was expecting the worst for quality control :).  It's possible the grippy part will wear out faster than the original but I won't know that for a long time. But hopefully the plastic mold is accurate enough that the joystick won't wobble.  I've never tried it, but I was considering using the left joystick to replace the C-stick to make it more of a usable joystick. They look the same size, but I've never done it for some reason. That would make a lot of games easier."
Gamecube,2ik9wl,cjrobe,1 point,Thu Oct 9 13:31:51 2014 UTC,"You got me curious enough to go to my basement work desk and try it out. The C-stick and left stick have identically shaped bases so putting the left stick in place of a c-stick is a drop-in replacement.  www.reddit.com/r/Gamecube/comments/2irg7o/proper_dual_joysticks_on_the_gamecube_controller/  And sure, let's keep in touch, I'll post around here when I get around to stuff :)."

Used Wii w/ gamecube ports/memory slots + wii component/hdmi/vga adapter == a hell of a lot cheaper than gamecube component cables"
Gamecube,2ijj49,bigted41,2,Tue Oct 7 14:27:33 2014 UTC,"I recently tackled this problem myself, and after some research, I found that most (cheap) AV to VGA converters won't be compatible with all game systems. It has to do with the way it converts the signal, and while I won't go into specifics, it's because the quality of the conversion from interlaced(480i for example) to progressive(480p) depends very much on what resolution the console outputs. However, if your monitor has an HDMI input, I found this. I have this product, and I can say that it works perfectly for all my old consoles, including gamecube. As a bonus, it does transmit sound through the HDMI if your monitor has speakers as well. |Conversion Example| This is an slightly different/older version of the product, but mine works just as well."

Regardless, first thing I do is take out the paper inserts and CD.  Like others suggested goo gone or soak it with some rubbing alchol/Windex mix.  Than I'll wash the case & CD with dish soap, to remove sticker residue and other grime.   pat the CD dry with a microfiber cloth. (Used to clean the disc with rubbing alchol,but once used 90% and it took the top layer right off a PS2 game. Which ruined it. So dish soap or windex works fine for me).   Stick the case near a window or a warm spot to dry out.  Lol I know it prob sounds ocd, but unless it's sealed, than who knows what condition those  games have been sitting in for the past 10-14yrs?? The worst is the stickers on the paper artwork. Gamestop has those ugly yellow ones. I've had success getting those off, with small amounts of goo gone and q- tips also.

Gamecube,2hu40w,timrtabor123,1 point,Wed Oct 8 06:24:20 2014 UTC,"Giftpia:       Giftpia (ギフトピア, Gifutopia ?) is a video game that was developed by Skip Ltd. for the Nintendo GameCube. It was released in Japan on April 25, 2003. Despite that its last showing at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) was in English, Nintendo cancelled the North American localization of GiFTPiA. In English, the game would most likely be better understood as called ""Giftopia"" to represent the two words, gift and utopia.

Gamecube,2hugt8,ShokoFlow,6,Tue Sep 30 01:16:19 2014 UTC,"What part of the process do you need help with? You open the Gamecube controller, pull off the joystick plastic, put on the nunchuck joystick plastic, and then put the Gamecube controller back together again?  People have mentioned doing this online before, usually when they don't want to spend any money on buying the proper joystick plastic parts for the analog sticks for the Gamecube controller. The proper parts are $1.99 each (or $2.99 for the pair), so it would make sense to actually use them instead - they are not rare or expensive.  Here is a video where RetroGameTech replaces the analog sticks on a Wii nunchuk with the ones from a Gamecube (the opposite of what you were asking), so they seem to be interchangeable."
Gamecube,2hugt8,mr_arkadin,2,Tue Sep 30 09:59:36 2014 UTC,"Thanks so much. I didn't know if there was like a certain way you had to pull the joysticks off and put them on. I've never modded controllers before, so I'm new to this."
Gamecube,2hugt8,mr_arkadin,2,Tue Sep 30 11:50:53 2014 UTC,"You just pull them straight off (away from the controller itself). You can work them off slowly and gently if you want, just to be sure they are coming off the controller properly. I have replaced the Gamecube sticks with exact replacements (like the ones I linked to above), so that is how those worked. Based on the YouTube video I linked to, the nunchuck stick looks to work the same way."

Gamecube,2hg0hh,CanadianGladiator,0,Thu Sep 25 16:53:35 2014 UTC,why did he hack up the controller? could he not have used one of those extension cables so he could plug it into a female port? i don't even...
Gamecube,2hg0hh,bigted41,2,Sun Sep 28 01:15:06 2014 UTC,"Pretty late reply but seeing how there are more than 6 wires are coming out of the GC controller I think the he decodes the 6-wire GC controller protocol using some custom hardware and put it inside the controller itself. The wires coming out are either his own protocol or just a wire for each used button press/analog control stick value. The way you described is also possible (and is used) but you will still have to decode the GC controller protocol on some piece of hardware.  The guy in OP's link probably found his solution ""cleaner"" but in the end it just depends on whatever you like."

Gamecube,2h8p48,HeyitzClay,3,Tue Sep 23 16:50:44 2014 UTC,"That part of the disc holds absolutely no data. The black ring is actually residue from the disc being run through a resurfacer, probably a few times. You just have a defective disc. A lot of times people will just buy large amounts of damaged discs on ebay then run them through a resurface machine and resell them. I worked at Gamestop for a long time and they resurfaced a lot of their damaged product. I ran in to that black ring a lot. Unfortunately resurfacing doesn't always fix the problem."
Gamecube,2h8p48,BondoMondo,1 point,Wed Sep 24 08:34:57 2014 UTC,"Yes, you can defiantly tell its been run through a resurfacer. The big give away was the white residue on the inner ring."

Gamecube,2gzj9i,CoLiNieS,5,Sat Sep 20 22:23:58 2014 UTC,"Alright, would you like a bit of constructive criticism?  It's pretty obvious that you're reading from a script in this video, and of course you should be. Trying to freestyle something like this could only be a disaster. The problem stems from the fact that we as viewers KNOW that you're reading. In the future, try to develop a rapport with your audience. Talk to us, rather than reading to us. A more laid-back conversational style would really help with this.  You don't need to justify your decisions to the audience quite so much. ""Now I know what you're thinking"" is never a good way to start a discussion. It ignores the possibility that the viewers might share your opinion, and paints us as your debate partners rather than your friends.   Talk more about how the games made you feel. The story that you told about you and your dad playing PM:tTYD was really touching. It gave us insight into the relationship between the two of you, and made you more interesting as a commenter. Your segment about Koops and his father, though, was long-winded and unnecessary. Instead of detailing the whole subplot, why not say something like: ""Koops' journey through Hooktail Castle trying to find his long-lost father really touched me, and it had a satisfying conclusion that both moved the story forward and made me care more about my new partner"". You could even tie it into your experiences with your own dad if you want to, but there's no reason to detail the whole plot. It's a retread for those who have played the game, and spoils it for those who haven't. You never want your viewers to skip through or click away from your videos, so avoid spoilers whenever possible.  Your video's title is misleading. On Youtube it shows up as ""Top 5 Gamecube games of All Time!"", but here you posted it as ""My Top 5 Gamecube Games"". One of these is more honest than the other. This video is about your experiences with the games rather than being a discussion of their overall quality, and your title should reflect that.   The above problem is compounded by opening the video by saying that you haven't played three of the most well-regarded games on the system (two of which are in my personal top five). This is disappointing to the viewer who was looking forward to seeing their favourite games discussed and viewed through new eyes. As someone who's currently replaying RE4 on the Gamecube, it was pretty disappointing. If you hadn't mentioned it, then I probably wouldn't have minded. Since you did, though, I was immediately put on the defensive and began to question your authority as a content-provider.  Let me know if you have any questions, or if you have some counter-points that you'd like to share."

Gamecube,2gudso,NinjaUnicorn_17,2,Mon Sep 22 22:27:45 2014 UTC,"Here are mine.  Metroid Prime: first game that really made me feel like I was completely immersed in the game world. Still one of my favorite games of all time. I have a save file with the original Metroid and Fusion Suit unlocked. I did absolutely everything in that game except beat the final boss on hard mode. I just couldn't do it no matter how hard I I tried.  Wind Waker: Both Zelda games are on my list but Wind Waker holds a slight edge because of how timeless the graphics are. I feel like the HD version added way too much bloom in the game. The original is still my favorite despite the improvements of the later version. I for one didn't mind long sailing and the triforce hunt. The entire point of the game was to chart out and explore the ocean. People who get bored with sailing have some low attention spans or something.  Super Smash Bros Melee: One of the best fighters ever. I sunk way more hours into this game than I did Brawl. It just had the right level of depth and chaos to it. It came out early in the systems life and made me feel like my purchase was justified. I'll never get rid of this game.  Animal Crossing: no joke I played this game every day for a solid two years. Even if it was just to get it marked in the journal. To me this is still the best one. For some reason I just appreciate the town layout and the acre system in this game more so than the open world feel of later games. NES games were an awesome bonus and it really pushed me to find as many items as I could. I feel like this game had much more ""omg this is on sale!"" Feelings than the later games. Also the holidays in this version of the game are by far the best ones.  Twilight Princess: I have finally gotten around to playing the GameCube version of the game and after playing both this and the wii version, the GameCube version is truly superior. The controls are perfect even with the absence of pointer controls for aiming. I never realized how annoying the fairy pointer was until playing this game. And the world feels ""correct"" compared to the flipped world of the Wii version. When you flip the world it feels like nothing makes sense. Death Mountain should not be in the west! I also find myself noticing the background art in this game because the game is finally perfect with my expectations of where landmarks should be.   Paper Mario TTYD: this game is amazing! The dialogue is some of the best in any video game ever. I had high expectations because I loved the first game and this game blew them away. This game is just so funny. There are a ton of secrets and I each chapter just builds into something more awesome. My favorite chapter by far is the chapter in the sky town with the fighting arena. I never realized how in just small space Nintendo managed to craft this engaging story about rising through the ranks of this fighting league. Some of the most hilarious dialog is in this chapter as well. It also helped that I was a huge Wrestling mark back then."

I also enjoy the usual classics - although personally I reckon Resident Evil 4 was one of the worst things to happen to console gaming.   The game I've enjoyed most on GC is Mario Power Tennis. The 4-player mode was a mainstay at uni - and a decade on I've rekindled the love with my current friends. This and WarioWare is all you need for an awesome night in."

Gamecube,2gmd64,Relinies,3,Wed Sep 17 02:03:35 2014 UTC,"The wavebird should be a perfect donor to the wired controller, assuming they both are genuine Nintendo. Third party controllers have different parts and often break easier and are more difficult to repair.   As far as swapping goes, you will need either a triwing screwdriver or considerable dexterity with a really small Phillips screwdriver to open up the controllers. Then you just pull off the two thumbsticks and swap them. Easy as pie. Once you have them opened up, this is also a great time to pull out the buttons and clean them off. I usually use a q tip with some alcohol on it to get into all the nooks and crannies. Once you're done, just reassemble and get to gaming!  Hope this helps!"
Gamecube,2gmd64,SCHMITTAY,1 point,Wed Sep 17 06:12:17 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your help!  Yeah, both controllers are official  Let's hope I can find that screwdriver, that's probably gonna be the biggest problem  But, here's a question My wireless controller (the wavebird?)'s thumbstick spins around too freely. Will that be an issue for the working controller?"
Gamecube,2gmd64,emindaer,1 point,Wed Sep 17 11:59:34 2014 UTC,"Here's the screwdriver on Amazon.  And here are some replacement analog stick caps. I've never used these, but the reviews look promising."
Gamecube,2gmd64,Gamecubeboy,1 point,Wed Sep 17 13:04:48 2014 UTC,When you say spins around too freely do you mean (1) its loose and you can move it left to right and so force too easily or (2) you can actually twist the control stick and it will spin around 360 degrees while staying centered?    If its #1 there is no problem with the control stick cap itself and it will work well as a donor.  If its #2 then youll probably have a problem
Gamecube,2gmd64,Gamecubeboy,1 point,Wed Sep 17 19:50:52 2014 UTC,It's the second one.
Gamecube,2gmd64,Gamecubeboy,1 point,Thu Sep 18 00:30:24 2014 UTC,"Well, there's still a chance the cap is good.  Its one of two things; the slot in the cap is broken or the notch in the stick is broken.  I'm not sure which is more likely"
Gamecube,2gmd64,jimjamj,1 point,Thu Sep 18 00:40:39 2014 UTC,"I'll refer to you when I get around to working on my controllers then.  I think it is the notches broken, though. It just feels like it when I spin the thumbstick around."

I use the router to get them online, since I don't need to do anything special other than to plug it in).  Only con I ever found with the setup is that I couldn't access the internals of the router once I had it set up to be on my network.  I never bothered to check if it was something I did, or something that was wrong with the DDWRT firmware I uploaded to it (or, if that's how it's supposed to act).  If I ever needed to change something, I did a reset and simply input the new information that way.  I'm sure there's a better way, however."

Gamecube,2falio,Nannose,2,Tue Sep 2 20:59:14 2014 UTC,"Homebrew on either the Gamecube or Wii is required to do this.  It's much easier to do this on the Wii side, as you don't really need to buy anything special outside of an SD card.  If you do not have a homebrew enabled Wii, there's plenty of guides out there to get you going on that.    What it comes down to is this software: GCMM.  It can backup individual files, or the entire memory card (if you use the latter, there are applications, and I think the Dolphin emulator, that can extract specific saves out of it).  I used it recently to back up a friend's Phantasy Star Online data so he could use Dolphin to play online.  If you want to go the Gamecube route, you have a few options, all of which require an SD Gecko, or Datel's SD Media Launcher*:   Action Replay method with SDLoad - Boot homebrew by entering a really long AR code from a specially formatted SD card. PSOload Exploit - requires a BBA (I don't think the GC Modem will work).  I've never personally done it, but it works via tricking PSO to connect to your computer, and allowing the download of homebrew on to the GC. SD Media Launcher - Similar to the AR + SD Gecko method, but doesn't require owning an AR.  From what I've read online (as I don't own one), the SD Media Launcher is a bit more finicky and prone to problems.  But, it still at least works. Max Drive Pro - I don't think Datel produces these anymore, but you can boot homebrew with them if you track one down (in this day and age, however, it isn't worth using.  I own one, and it's pretty shoddy half the time).   Anyway, once you have homebrew running on the Gamecube or Wii, using the GCMM application is all but a couple button hits to back up your entire memory card.  On the Wii side, GCMM will save to the front SD card or a USB drive.  On the Gamecube end, it'll save to the SD card mounted in whichever memory card slot it's in.  *don't buy the SD Media Launcher with an SD card if you go that route.  It's cheaper to get an SD Card separately elsewhere, provided you don't already own one."

The rare Phantasy Star is the PLUS version, the standard version is much more common. Pokemon Box is rare but specifically finding it with the big box and memory card is tough. I'd also add Digimon Rumble Arena 2 and Wind Waker/OoT combo pack.   If we are counting big box combo packs though, there's the Resident Evil 10th Anniversary Collection, the Pure Evil Big Box (2 variants) and here are the big guns: the Sonic and Monkey Ball 2-Packs, IMO the rarest things to come by. There's 3:    Sonic Adventure 2-Pack Super Monkey Ball 2-Pack  Sonic Heroes / Super Monkey Ball ""Duo Pack""   Specifically the Duo Pack is almost impossible to find.

Gamecube,2ev14i,YoshiEgg25,2,Thu Aug 28 21:58:34 2014 UTC,"Section 16. Component video cable of article  Nintendo GameCube accessories:       The Component Video Cable provides video quality superior to that of other connections, including the RF modulator, composite video cable and s-video cable (at 576i/50Hz or 480i/60Hz). It also enables the use of progressive scan (480p/60Hz) in supported games. The connector plugs into the Digital AV port rather than the Analog AV port used by other cables and contains a Macronix CMPV-DOL video chip (a digital-to-analog converter). This converts the Y′CBCR digital video coming from the digital port to the YPBPR analog format used by component video equipment. While CMPV-DOL's reconfigurability allows it to carry out unusual functions such as Y′CBCR to RGBHV conversion, it cannot take advantage of the digital audio from the console's digital port. This means that a separate cable, such as the system's standard A/V cable, must also be connected to the Analog AV port in order to transmit the audio signal.

Gamecube,2epmeu,FlameMammoth,2,Wed Aug 27 18:26:54 2014 UTC,"Here's my first, easy-to-do tips. Get some Q-Tips and rubbing alcohol. Dip the Q-Tip into the rubbing alcohol. And clean the lens with it. (Rubbing alcohol works best because it attracts all the dirt, keeps it, and anything left over evaporates in 10 seconds) Also, make sure the lens is working properly. As in, it can easily slide from near to far away from the motor. (The motor is that center button that you press on to release your game)   Secondly, make sure the motor spins with ease. If it can't go fast enough, it won't read. This is easy to check by putting a game in, and spinning it yourself.   Thirdly, make sure the top door (not sure exactly what it's called) closes, and stays closed. If it doesn't pop up on its own quickly, that's a bad sign. If you don't hear a ""click"" when you close it, another bad sign. I would suggest putting 2 or 3 game cases on top of the cube while testing it out.  And the last thing I would recommend would to clean the ports on the back with rubbing alcohol as you did to the lens, and maybe getting new cords.   If worse comes to worse, I would suggest getting a Wii, with the backwards compatibility. They have the Gamecube hardware built in, and I have never had issues with mine.   Sucks to hear about your 'Cube, hopefully that helped!"

The manual is actually the same exact manual that was used for Ocarina of Time except it is in black and white and the button instructions were rewritten to reflect the GameCube controller. On that note I'm replaying this version of OoT and I'm impressed Nintendo went out of their way to change the button colors and text in the game to reflect you were playing on GameCube.

Gamecube,2els5s,tassyguy,3,Tue Aug 26 06:14:08 2014 UTC,"Hmm, I always wonder how to answer questions like these because the fact you have to ask this makes me question whether you're currently capable of gamecube development. Nevertheless it's good to have long term goals and learning everything necessary along the way of getting there.  Anyways, how experienced in programming are you? This is not your usual application program running on just and only a computer, we're getting into the wonderful territory of system programming.  Now I'm only assuming this but I don't think the gamecube has an actual OS and all games on it run bare metal on the cpu and gpu. This most likely means that the compilers available are C/C++ (and assembly of course). Do you have any experience at all with these languages? If so, do you have experience programming for embedded platforms?  After some searching I found the following things:   devkitPRO, tooling necessary for programming. You'll need the PowerPC version of the devkit as that's the architecture the gamecube uses. libogc, luckily it seems this is included with devkitPRO. This library is your interface to use the gamecube specific hardware. Yet Another GameCube Documentation, documentation on low-level hardware registers.   Now if you're lucky devkitPRO might even include examples which you can compile and try to run on the dolphin emulator. Do keep in mind that this is a bit of a shallow answer as I didn't dig deep when searching for these things. But if you e.g. still need to learn C programming, there's a steep road ahead.  Good luck!"

The general one was for the general public who didn't pre-order it, but still wanted the game. However, the bonus disc copies were for those who pre-ordered it.

Or they found a stock of them hidden away. When that happens, it goes back up for sale until they run out.  Every so often, my store would get one single GameCube game from the warehouse. I think they were looking to see how fast it would sell in high volume stores so they could potentially offload some of their supply to stores. Took us months to have someone buy it. Needless to say, we didn't get more GameCube games.  Source: I'm an Assistant Manager for one of the highest volume stores in the company."
Gamecube,2dxfzt,FIRST_DATE_ANAL,5,Mon Aug 18 22:47:32 2014 UTC,"Can someone explain to me why these are so expensive, or why they just don't make knock offs?"
Gamecube,2dxfzt,hiddenmoose,4,Mon Aug 18 23:46:33 2014 UTC,Nintendo built the A-D converter into the cable itself rather than into the back of the console. They only manufactured the cables and consoles that would accept them for the first year of the consoles life. No one ever bothered to make a knock off because at the time they were expensive to make and no one even bought the Nintendo ones.
Gamecube,2dxfzt,hiddenmoose,2,Tue Aug 19 00:25:11 2014 UTC,"That sucks. I see a ton of knock off A/V cables now at my local retro game store, I would have figured someone would make HD cables for the systems by now."

Gamecube,2dp0r2,ExultantSandwich,1 point,Mon Aug 18 21:47:16 2014 UTC,"Never heard of them. If you are just getting them to play casual games, it shouldn't be to bad.  If you are getting once for Super Smash Bros, third party is never the answer, always go official for that."

Gamecube,2dnr4y,Heyferg,3,Fri Aug 15 20:05:26 2014 UTC,"Hell Melee usually goes anywhere between $30/$60 used, it depends on condition and complete in box and what not ! I'd go for like $35 though ^"
Gamecube,2dnr4y,Heyferg,1 point,Fri Aug 15 21:22:14 2014 UTC,"For just the game?  Because if I'm asking for $30 for the console and selling controllers, I'm looking at around $75 at this point.  And mine is in great condition, in the case, with the manual and the memory card (which I'd throw in) has everything unlocked."
Gamecube,2dnr4y,SethThaDino,2,Fri Aug 15 21:59:54 2014 UTC,"That's complete in box it goes for a lot of money dude! Yeah you could probably get more than that for the console and controllers too. Depends if the controllers aren't you know scratched and worn down to shit, but controllers for the GC go for a lot. For example my used Wavebird I just bought cost me 40 dollars alone."
Gamecube,2dnr4y,Blanco8x8,2,Fri Aug 15 22:07:18 2014 UTC,Yeah that's about right.
Gamecube,2dnr4y,Blanco8x8,2,Sat Aug 16 01:22:26 2014 UTC,"I think $50 is a reasonable price, Smash Bros Melee, Gamecube controllers and memory cards are in high demand these days."
Gamecube,2dnr4y,DapperConch,1 point,Fri Aug 15 19:17:42 2014 UTC,"$50 for all? That's what I was thinking before I looked into each item, but looking up Melee on ebay, there's some pretty high prices for a copy in good condition with case and manual.  Although that is $50 I didn't have yesterday."
Gamecube,2dnr4y,MF_Rokus,2,Fri Aug 15 19:45:10 2014 UTC,"lol, Melee worth more than the Gamecube itself. $50 for everything is a good price, but you can go a bit higher if you want. Just don't push it."
Gamecube,2dnr4y,Sherblock,3,Fri Aug 15 20:07:04 2014 UTC,I sold my copy of melee by itself pretty quickly on Amazon for about $45 just a few months ago.

Gamecube,2dn0r1,BCProgramming,1 point,Sat Aug 16 17:08:01 2014 UTC,"Component cables let games run at a higher resolution of 480p. It looks much better than Composite or even S-Video.  It is expensive because it is hard to come by since Nintendo only sold it for a limited time on it's website, then pulled it from lack of interest, as well as the cable itself using proprietary chips to decode the signal coming from the Gamecube's Digital AV Port."
Gamecube,2dn0r1,BigRobotBil,2,Sat Aug 16 20:21:01 2014 UTC,I can barely tell the difference when I toggle progressive scan on and off in most games. Tempted to sell mine but I feel like I should hang on to them. Do they really fetch $200+?

Gamecube,2df7ce,Heyferg,5,Wed Aug 13 10:18:26 2014 UTC,If you're just trying to play the games buy a first generation Wii instead. You can play it on HDTV with component cable.  I would only buy a Gamecube if I wanted to add it to a collection.

However you should definitely get a Gameboy Player with it (make sure it has the boot disc!) that makes it entirely worth it as you can play any GB game up to the GBA on your TV!

Gamecube,2dcw3m,Xikar_Wyhart,3,Tue Aug 12 18:27:19 2014 UTC,I am not to sure what would cause the problems with the triggers not returning other than a broken spring.

Gamecube,2dcw3m,wolf9545,2,Tue Aug 12 20:53:08 2014 UTC,"Well no the triggers are just weird.  Like I said R's pressure isn't being detected but the full down is, and when playing Mario Sunshine the functions of R are placed on L while it retains it's own functions.  So I shoot water with L and when pressed all the way down I start to sidle while shooting water. So weird."

Gamecube,2dcw3m,HughRistik,1 point,Tue Aug 12 21:51:51 2014 UTC,I posted those instructions mostly so you have something to follow when you take apart the controller. The c stick problem might be a bad connection.

Honestly, unless you're very into racing games, I wouldn't make this a must-have. It's extremely hard and you have to be fully committed to memorizing the tracks.  Pikmin is a little more pricey, usually around the $20-$30 area. It's an awesome game though!  Other great games are Animal Crossing ($20), Luigi's Mansion ($20), Mario Kart: Double Dash ($25), Super Mario Sunshine ($25), Kirby Air Ride ($30), The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker ($30), and Melee ($50).  Note that the prices are usually ones you'll find at gamestores for the games individually. If you search hard around craigslist, you'll probably be able to find some great bundles.

Gamecube,2cvszr,HiHiBrandO,2,Thu Aug 7 17:29:14 2014 UTC,I would sell now. GameCube games at high prices now because of both the Wii backwards compatibility and the inability to buy them without going to the used game market. If Nintendo were to suddenly start offering GameCube games in virtual console I can see the price for classic first party titles dipping. A good example was how the price for Zone of the Enders 2 and Marvel vs Capcom 2 plummeted after they were re-released. Now MVC2 is gaining value because you can't download the games anymore. On the other hand Wind Waker is still expensive despite the HD version being out.
Gamecube,2cvszr,indiefolkfan,1 point,Fri Aug 8 00:06:36 2014 UTC,Like you said there is no telling but my personal opinion would be sell. Game collecting is at a high right now. Most prices over the past 4 years since I have started have certainly gotten higher. The safest way to sell is amazon but you lose a high percentage of profits. I have done very well on amazon I wish you the best of luck !

Gamecube,2cstve,miniboss1487,2,Thu Aug 7 12:22:00 2014 UTC,I bid a lot on eBay and the key is to just bid the worth of the item in the last 15 seconds. So if Mario Kart is at $20 just go ahead and bid $35. You will have the high bid and other buyers will panic and keep increasing it by a dollar. When time runs out the price may have climbed a few bucks but you still save some cash and get the item.
Gamecube,2cstve,Heyferg,1 point,Thu Aug 7 14:42:42 2014 UTC,Maybe! Someone had put in a bid at the last ten seconds but I still got it just in time!

I'd say looking at a WiiU Pro Controller, Dualshock, or Xbox 360 controller would be a better example of a ""standard"" controller, with their only differences being the layout of the analog sticks."

A bit annoying to reach out to but if I've got more than two thumb buttons AND triggers to deal with regularly, I tend to get annoyed with a game.

Gamecube,2cd7r5,00WELVAERT,3,Fri Aug 1 20:23:43 2014 UTC,"You don't need a cable, you need a signal converter. The NTSC Gamecube comes with a composite cable for video/audio (yellow for video, white/red for left/right audio), whereas HDMI is a digital signaling method.  You will need a device that can take the incoming analog video signal and convert it into a digital signal that can be sent to your TV.  The problem with most of these devices is that they are not designed for gaming, but for video conversion (e.g., digitizing VHS tapes), or other such applications where latency is not a huge issue.  Unless there exists a specialty device for gaming that accomplishes this purpose, you will invariably be forced to deal with input lag that could potentially make some games unplayable (SSBM comes to mind).  What I'm trying to say is: don't just go buy the first signal converter/upscaler that pops up on Amazon or eBay. Do some research. Latency is really the key, so if you get something that's got a delay of ~100ms or so, you're probably not going to enjoy using it for gaming very much.  Unfortunately, I do not know of any convertors which would be acceptable to use for gaming. Maybe other readers here could chime in?"
Gamecube,2cd7r5,oscillating000,2,Fri Aug 1 21:14:33 2014 UTC,"My home theatre receiver does upconverting, and it seems to do so well enough that I don't notice any lag.

It's possible that the pins in the gamecube are dirty and are not transmitting the information properly resulting in a corrupted file. Secondly, try cleaning the contacts of the memory card. Takes a Q-Tip and put some rubbing alcohol on it and clean the contacts with it. Make sure the Q-Tip is just damp and not dripping with the alcohol. Also dry the contacts before testing it. Don't use the other end of the Q-Tip as this may kill the card entirely from static electricity. Just spray some of the compressed air into it. See if that helps at all."

Skies had it all for me man but it's literally opinion dude it's not that TOS isn't a good game it's just not my cup of tea, also I can say this as I have infact finished TOS."

Possibly also games such as Megaman anniversary collection, X Collection, Mario Golf: Toadstool tour, Super Monkey Ball 1 & 2, TimeSplitters 2, and Wave Race Blue Storm.

Gamecube,2bgtqg,ThereAreThings,1 point,Wed Jul 23 19:33:01 2014 UTC,The game stores in my city say the exact same thing about first party titles for the GameCube. They go in about as fast as they fly out the door.  I got an excellent quality copy of Double Dash for $25 and that was a good deal but $12.95 is a steal! Good find!
Gamecube,2bgtqg,Chutzvah,1 point,Thu Jul 24 05:09:34 2014 UTC,People who sell that game confuse me. That game is gold to anyone who has ever played that
Gamecube,2bgtqg,The_Child_of_Atom,1 point,Fri Jul 25 18:11:09 2014 UTC,im so angry that my copy of it was stolen. two years after i had gotten my Gamecube i had a pretty decent collection but then we got robbed when we were on vacation. finally got my collection back and then some.
Gamecube,2bgtqg,BCProgramming,1 point,Thu Jul 24 13:24:14 2014 UTC,"I have two copies of this game because apparently I have terrible memory, though I forget how much I paid for them. I think around the same a few years ago, when gamecube games weren't quite retro so they were far cheaper and in less demand than SNES. I ended up with two because I bought one and managed to forget I bought it and bought another one. Thankfully they are ""different""- one is the ""Player's choice"" variety which is actually a later software version."

Gamecube,2bakar,polyphenus,3,Wed Aug 27 14:56:15 2014 UTC,Never was one. There is a chip in the Nintendo one. It would be cost prohibitive to recreate this 3rd party. If you want the cable you will have to pony up $100ish for it.
Gamecube,2bakar,Socksfelloff,5,Mon Jul 21 14:54:02 2014 UTC,Current eBay prices make $100 seem affordable... :(
Gamecube,2bakar,PhotoJim99,1 point,Mon Jul 21 14:55:37 2014 UTC,I've been heavily contemplating for the past week to grab one off eBay for $200 Ish. I just sold my ps3 for $200...do I essentially swap it for a set of cables? I have a wii with component cables but it's somehow not the same. Also gameboy player.
Gamecube,2bakar,Socksfelloff,2,Mon Jul 21 15:40:56 2014 UTC,"Functionally, if your Wii has the GameCube ports, it is the same, it's not just an emulation.  The Wii hardware is similar enough to the GameCube hardware that the CPU just slows down and you have pretty much identical functionality.  You can't add the GameBoy player or the Broadband Adapter, but you can use accessories like the GameBoy connection cable.  The other option is to have a TV with S-Video jacks (or an upconverting home theatre receiver with such jacks), and use a third-party S-Video cable which is super cheap and about 90% as good video-wise."
Gamecube,2bakar,PhotoJim99,1 point,Mon Jul 21 16:17:57 2014 UTC,Oh I'm well aware of the technical aspects thanks. I just mean it's not the same as hooking up that square cube and the sound the drive makes when you fire it up lol... I know I'm in the minority. Also I currently use svideo on a Sony pvm and it's just no where near as nice as rgb or component.
Gamecube,2bakar,wwcoop,1 point,Mon Jul 21 16:56:49 2014 UTC,My GameCube looks really good on my plasma TV via S-Video.  I have no complaints.

Gamecube,2bakar,cyrilspaceman,1 point,Mon Jul 28 14:23:55 2014 UTC,A lot of people just use a wii to play the GameCube games bc the cable price is so outrageous due to its scarcity.
Gamecube,2bakar,jakuu,1 point,Mon Jul 21 16:19:11 2014 UTC,You'd probably be better off just buying a Wii because the component cables for that are much cheaper.

I booted up my copy to see if it required some strange inputs to get it to work, but it let me through just fine.  Perhaps bring your GameCube to the store and try it out there?  When I was trying to find a working Sega 32X, I would bring my Genesis and everything with me so I could test it in store.  I'm sure they'd be more than happy to let you do something like that with your GameCube  EDIT: /u/evilfatman89 is correct."

Not really! They get all their stock for free and any money they make from the crap that people donate is all profit.

In this case the store is run by a church that holds anti-gay views and has fought against LGBT rights in this country for decades.   Fuck them!

Unfortunately you're probably stuck with an unusable PAL game though.  You're going to have to cut your losses and resell the game or buy a PAL GC.

Gamecube,2apox6,Gamecubeboy,4,Tue Jul 15 05:45:42 2014 UTC,"They are all technically the same model, DOL-003. It just comes down to manufacturing runs.  Every time Nintendo commissioned a new batch of controllers you would imagine they would look to improve cost savings.  So at the time the two were produced perhaps either black plastic or purple plastic were cheaper to come by.  And the same for the metal vs. plastic control stick housing, although you would assume plastic is cheaper so this might be the later design (unless they decided the plastic could fail and went with the more durable metal).    Ive also seen a design where the circuit board on the back is green, it doesn't have that see through white protective tape"

Gamecube,2aj5gi,baba_944,3,Fri Jul 18 22:08:43 2014 UTC,"I would imagine many games that were on both GameCube and PS2 would have been better on GameCube as long as they didn't seriously downgrade the visuals to avoid using > 1 disc. The GC was much, much more graphically capable than the PS2, had quicker loading times due to physically smaller discs and CAV, and IMO a better controller (though this is highly subjective). Whether they can be considered the best is dubious though, as many games on both GC and PS2 also released on Xbox, where they would've been superior in pretty much every way from a technical standpoint."
Gamecube,2aj5gi,regretdeletingthat,2,Sat Jul 12 23:18:22 2014 UTC,Usually they'd gimp the GCN versions by degrading the quality of cut scenes and/or removing some of the extras. I think that was the case with Splinter Cell.
Gamecube,2aj5gi,Shotgun_Washington,3,Sun Jul 13 05:27:57 2014 UTC,I prefer all the classic Resident Evil games on the GameCube as opposed to PlayStation. Reason being a unique control scheme that allows you to hold down the R-button to run. It's weird at first but it makes controlling your character much easier.
Gamecube,2aj5gi,tarkusAB,2,Sat Jul 12 21:56:19 2014 UTC,Mega Man Command Mission ran at a higher frame rate on GC iirc.

I agree, I walked into a store the other day that had a copy for 29.99 and I just about slapped myself, I thought the game was way more than that. Especially being an RPG, but apparently it was remade or something for the PS3 which is why I'm guessing the price dropped  Wind Waker also took a heavy hit in price, but that's probably due to the HD edition.

I can switch frequently between a computer and the gamecube output.  Colors and video quality is really decent. And this does save me space."
Gamecube,2a1q9s,jaydoubleyoutee,4,Mon Jul 7 13:46:27 2014 UTC,"Composite (yellow cable) compresses luminance (brightness) and chrominance (colour) into a single cable, which mutes the colour and detail. Up close on an LCD, there is a noticeable amount of fuzziness. Component has two cables for chrominance and one for luminance, so no compression is needed. The colours you see on the screen are much closer to what the developer intended. Over component, everything is sharper and more vibrant. If you're based in America, you can also take advantage of 480p in many games, where you get a full progressive frame each time rather than half a frame (an interlaced field). In Europe, games can't do 480p, but you can use very cheaply available SCART cables which are capable of full RGB colour, similar to component."
Gamecube,2a1q9s,regretdeletingthat,3,Mon Jul 7 15:55:32 2014 UTC,You seem to know a lot about this. Is there any difference between playing GCN games through a component on a gamecube and playing them with component cables on a Wii?
Gamecube,2a1q9s,clarke41,4,Mon Jul 7 16:00:11 2014 UTC,It appears to be the case that a Wii with component cables outputs identical video to a GameCube with component cables. So playing on a Wii is a much cheaper way to achieve the higher visual quality.
Gamecube,2a1q9s,regretdeletingthat,4,Mon Jul 7 16:03:47 2014 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the info. Knowing this, it just blows my mind even more that people will pay $150 for gamecube component cables when they could buy a Wii, Wii component cable, gamecube controller, memory card and a game or two for the same price."
Gamecube,2a1q9s,clarke41,3,Mon Jul 7 16:13:54 2014 UTC,I think certain people think the G-cube one is slightly better quality but that could just be the placebo effect.
Gamecube,2a1q9s,Zeppelanoid,2,Mon Jul 7 20:35:54 2014 UTC,"I'd like your opinion on component vs RGB, please. Do you think there is a noticeable difference between RGB 480i and Component 480p, specifically for the game boy player?   I live in Europe and am considering one, I'm also looking for a CRT and 480p CRTs are basically non-existent here. So, would you recommend 480i on CRT via RGB or 480p on LCD via Component? (for both GB Player and GC games, I have a Wii for the latter)  Thanks."
Gamecube,2a1q9s,Pereb27,1 point,Mon Jul 7 23:37:07 2014 UTC,"I couldn't comment, to my knowledge no European GameCube software supports progressive scan, and I've never had the chance to play around with American stuff. The only comparison I have is 480i component on the Wii vs 480i RGB SCART from a GameCube, and those look identical to me. However, comparing 480i and 480p in Wii software seems to add a noticeable amount of sharpness, and you will obviously not encounter any interlacing artefacts. If you have the means to get 480p out of your GameCube, it will really help on the LCD. However, regardless of which cable you use, for sixth gen games and older a CRT will almost always look better. It's just what they were designed for. I think you'd be happier with the quality of SCART on a CRT."
Gamecube,2a1q9s,regretdeletingthat,2,Mon Jul 7 23:43:36 2014 UTC,"Alright, thank you. I'm considering a PVM with component/480p support to get the best of both worlds, too.

Gamecube,2a1q9s,evilfatman89,3,Mon Jul 7 22:18:27 2014 UTC,As someone who is owned the cable for almost 2 years there is definitely a difference. If you want to know why there's a difference you want to lookup the differences between progressive and interlace modes and the differences between component and composite cables. In short you're getting better color palettes and increased resolution because of the progressive scan mode
Gamecube,2a1q9s,mzajac14,3,Mon Jul 7 15:51:47 2014 UTC,"If I'm correct, The max output of a composite (red, white, and yellow) is 480i, meaning interlaced video.  This means that screen only half the screen is refreshed per each refresh, and the pattern alternates.  The component cables are capable or 480p, which stands for progressive scan.  This means that, instead of alternating the part of the screen that is refreshed, it is all refreshed at once.  Also,  since the signal is broken up into 3 different cables of red green and blue instead of being jammed into one video signal, which degrades the quality of the signal.  A great YouTube channel is Adam Koralik's.  He can probably explain it better than myself, but I hope I helped."

Aquaman? Heck there's so many movie based video games and third party sellout things just looking to make money. Sonic Adventures 2 Battle can't be compared to those monstrosities imo. Though the camera is pretty freaking bad, especially in the lost chao sections.  My least favourite gamecube game that I've played (I haven't been ""lucky"" enough to play Charlie's Angels or Aquaman) is Super Monkey Ball Adventure, just such a disappointment after the first two.

It has basically the most n64 like graphics of all the GameCube releases. And to top it off, it has major stutter and fps issues. The voice acting is horrible. An example here, would be the malformed dragon fly that is following you around. And it constantly spews out BZBZBZBZBZBZBZBZZBZ sounds when it ""talks"". Most of the character design is really generic. Animation is stiff and models are far off from synced with the sound.  The story in itself is the most sorry excuse of a scenario. It also has the most unplayable controls of any game I have ever played, there is major delay when you move around and the controls feel rather heavy and bulky to top it of. Another thing, its incredible glitchy. You can fall out of the map and do all sorts of odd things that you are not supposed to do.

Gamecube,29kevy,BlazePT,1 point,Tue Jul 1 16:03:54 2014 UTC,"Pretty sure the games would look better on CRT regardless of cable. But if you use composite, you want to upgrade regardless. If your GC is NTSC, you can't use RGB without a modded component cable though, the next best option would be S-Video if your monitor supports it. If your GC is PAL, definitely get a RGB cable."

If I'm not satisfied, I'll hunt down a component cable and invest on the wii. Thanks!"
Gamecube,29kevy,theabolitionist,1 point,Tue Jul 1 21:06:01 2014 UTC,Keep in mind PAL GC games don't support 480p even with component cable. You'd want a NTSC cube (or softmod your wii) and NTSC games.
Gamecube,29kevy,squaretwo,1 point,Wed Jul 2 00:03:18 2014 UTC,"There's a huge difference between 480i & p. That said, unless you know of someone or can find one for less than £20/$30 it's more affordable to buy a Wii with GC support. That coupled with a component cable should run you £40/$60 total with the added bonus of Wii access."
Gamecube,29kevy,mr_arkadin,2,Tue Jul 1 16:09:34 2014 UTC,"I already have a Wii with GC support and component cable. Unfortunately,  the GB Player doesn't work with Wii. (Besides, PAL GC games don't support 480p, though I could look for NTSC versions)  Anyway, I just realized that I probably cannot find a 480p capable CRT due to living in PAL territory (480p being a NTSC standard), and I assume 480i on CRT is still better than 480p on LCD HDTV."
Gamecube,29kevy,antman420,1 point,Tue Jul 1 16:49:09 2014 UTC,"On my HDTV, there is a noticeable delay with standard definition systems. The games are almost unplayable. With component cables and 480p though, games play flawlessly. You will see the graphical limitations of the cube more easily, however. So, for an HDTV, use component with 480p; otherwise, for SDTV (crt), use RGB."
Gamecube,29kevy,fossilfern,1 point,Tue Jul 1 19:20:57 2014 UTC,"Check your HDTV's manual or on-screen menus for a setting called ""game mode"" or something similar. This should help reduce the lag you are seeing, if you are able to activate it."
Gamecube,29kevy,fossilfern,1 point,Wed Jul 9 10:56:45 2014 UTC,"On a modern HDTV (my Gamecube is on a 51 inch plasma) the jump to 480p with the cables was night and day. All games will show a marked improvement of course,  but some games like FZero that supported widescreen and 480p natively look like they belong on a 360 or PS3. Also, for whatever reason, you will notice that games look better on the Gamecube with the cables vs a Wii with HD cables.   I have a Gameboy player as well, the increased sharpness was very noticeable."
Gamecube,29kevy,peterthomas6,1 point,Wed Jul 2 00:19:25 2014 UTC,If you're in a PAL territory your probably better off with RGB since the PAL GC doesn't support progressive scan it believe.

Gamecube,29h4fk,ekrocket,1 point,Mon Jun 30 16:53:35 2014 UTC,Nope. Bought them from a friend. Good luck finding what you're looking for!
Gamecube,29h4fk,vcardone,2,Mon Jun 30 17:57:20 2014 UTC,$50 for both? Nice find! I have seen both games individually $50.
Gamecube,29h4fk,FlameMammoth,2,Tue Jul 1 06:35:24 2014 UTC,"Good job, buddy. I have both of them, and I bought them off a guy with LOADS of other quality games, and 2 controllers, a memory card for 80. When I checked out the manuals, it still had the original receipt and everything. The Master Quest is a lot of fun. Enjoy it!"

Gamecube,29cyxt,Bladley,1 point,Sun Jun 29 01:36:58 2014 UTC,How can you identify the digital out? I saw one at Goodwill the other day and wasn't sure.
Gamecube,29cyxt,FIRST_DATE_ANAL,2,Sun Jun 29 04:01:26 2014 UTC,On the back of the console where the power and composite cables normally go there will be a third plug in.   The plug in closest to the middle of the sytem on this pic.

Gamecube,29cyxt,FuzzyTurtlez,1 point,Sun Jun 29 05:28:34 2014 UTC,If I could get component cables for less than $50 I would probably bite. But I can't justify spending more than $100 on them. Really would love to have them though.
Gamecube,29d752,PurplePain55,7,Sun Jun 29 02:43:54 2014 UTC,The only reason to actually get a Gamecube anymore is because you can use the broadband adapter to play 16 player LAN Double Dash.  And because of PSO and some other online games too I guess. But the Wii does everything else GCN exactly the same.  *also Wii's are exponentially more fun hacked.
Gamecube,29d752,FIRST_DATE_ANAL,7,Sun Jun 29 02:57:59 2014 UTC,Also to play GBA games on your TV with the Game Boy Player.

Gamecube,29d752,FIRST_DATE_ANAL,0,Sun Jun 29 23:04:35 2014 UTC,Thanks I appreciate it.  Also do you know where I could find WaveBird Recievers? I'm  looking to get controllers that are wireless as I'm not too worried about lag but none of the one son amazon seem to come with receivers.
Gamecube,29d752,ThisIsMcNasty,1 point,Sun Jun 29 03:00:34 2014 UTC,You can usually find them reasonably priced on eBay.
Gamecube,29d752,FIRST_DATE_ANAL,0,Sat Jul 5 06:15:41 2014 UTC,"Oh I don't know. I've had all my Wavebirds for years. If you buy them NEW then the receivers definitely come in the package. Otherwise, try contacting Nintendo."

Gamecube,29d752,pikay93,1 point,Sun Jun 29 06:12:30 2014 UTC,But not the new Wiis. Most of the black ones and the mini dropped this compatibility.

Gamecube,29d752,patrickpf,1 point,Wed Jul 2 12:26:46 2014 UTC,"Make sure you get an original Wii, the newer ones are not compatible with Gamecube games. Check for controller ports on the top."
Gamecube,29d752,The_Child_of_Atom,1 point,Mon Jun 30 14:34:50 2014 UTC,"The only advantage of a Gamecube for the casual gamer would be that there's no menu you have to go through in order to get to Gamecube games. On a stock Wii you have to have fresh batteries in a Wii Remote in order to navigate over. However, a Wii can be modded so that you navigate through alternative menus (HBC) with a GC controller. Also if you go for component out then the Wii is a cheaper option."
Gamecube,29d752,KomeradObnobs,1 point,Tue Jul 1 00:03:28 2014 UTC,"If you have neither i would suggest the Wii but you have to buy a Gamecube controller before you can play any of the gamecube games. you're also getting access to a whole other library which too has excellent titles. i believe you should only buy a Gamecube if you're a collector or you want to experience it old school.  i suggest you go with the Wii first  but the Gamecube also has the Gameboy adaptor, special controllers and other things which among them is A GOD DAMN HANDLE. how can anyone forget that"

Gamecube,29bsr4,xKhanix,3,Sat Jun 28 19:02:21 2014 UTC,WW+MQ in mint condition is worth a fair price. My PAL version is worth like 150 dollars over here. In Norway. And it sells really fast as it were in very limited condition. So I would take the deal no matter what if I were in your situation. As its seen as a collectors piece. Just remember to seal it in something to stop it from scratching. To keep that plastic cover shiny and less dusty.  Basically all 4 Zelda games for Gamecube are very popular still. I think at least all of them sell for over 100 dollars here. Even if they are a bit worn out.
Gamecube,29bsr4,xKhanix,3,Thu Jul 3 17:06:01 2014 UTC,I bought them. But I'm not planning on ever re selling. I'm buying to play.

Gamecube,29afd2,antoniogarciaiii,1 point,Thu Jul 3 14:51:41 2014 UTC,Actually I changed my mind. Thank you though. But you can get people who want a free game cube over as this site: http://www.theisozone.com/. Great place. I recommended trying to ask the folks over there.
Gamecube,29afd2,baba_944,2,Thu Jul 3 15:39:03 2014 UTC,"locally? Craigslist or another comparable site in your area/region/country. play it smart, ask for pictures of the unit working. An ad that has been up there for a long time might be dealable. There may be some retro game or thrift shops in the area as well.  online? EBay. Its a good place to start. I've seen basic GCN packages going in the 20-40 dollar range, with a few bucks for shipping. I've gotten 2 off of eBay with no issues, for cheap. One of them was $80 shipped, and included a pair of Wavebirds and a component cable.  Don't do Amazon."
Gamecube,29afd2,illegalsandwiches,3,Sat Jun 28 01:34:12 2014 UTC,"Wow. Thank you for the advice. Haven't really gone with ebay for a long time, but if its that low I will definitely go for that."
Gamecube,29afd2,illegalsandwiches,2,Sat Jun 28 03:50:13 2014 UTC,"Yeah, its definitely not that expensive. If you see a GCN for $100 or more, it probably comes with a crapton of games. Just the units themselves are less than half that. I may put this extra purple GCN that I have on eBay soon."
Gamecube,29afd2,narse77,3,Sat Jun 28 04:01:11 2014 UTC,You hit the jackpot to get the component cable. Been looking for one of those for months. Everyone wants 150.00 plus for it.
Gamecube,29afd2,illegalsandwiches,1 point,Sat Jun 28 05:04:34 2014 UTC,"Want to know how I did it? I sat on ebay, for a night or two, looking at ALL GameCube auctions. Looking at the pictures in auctions that caught my eye as ""containing something extra"" and I just happen to stumble across it. It wasn't listed as text in the auction, but was shown in the pictures. I must have gone through 50-some pages before I found it.   I tell everyone it's worth a shot to do this if the drive to obtain this cable is extremely high. And, the same technique can be used on CL, but the chances of someone responding, in my experience, is very low."

Gamecube,296faf,freedogecoins,9,Thu Jun 26 19:54:56 2014 UTC,"As already mentioned, you wont need much more than Mario Kart and Smash Bros. But you could also do no wrong in getting  Super Monkey Ball  F Zero GX  Godzilla: Destroy All MOnsters Mellee  Timesplitters 2  WarioWare  which all have ace 4 player modes.  If you can source one Gameboy Advance with a GC to GBA link cable, 4 player gaming rarely gets any better than PAC MAN Vs. (Which was given free with the GC version of Ridge Racer; R:Racing)  If you want to go ALL OUT, (really expensive these days), you can get 4 GBAs and 4 link cables for   Zelda Four Swords Aventures  I used to own all that was necessary to play this, but to be honest it wasnt really worth it, that game was a bit too frustrating for proper co op play.   I dont think a comprehensive list of all the multiplayer games will be worth your time as there are so many third party duds.   P.S Again, Pac Man Vs was pretty much the only game to provide asynchronous multiplayer until the Wii U came along (in many ways its quite similar to Luigis Ghost Hunt on Nintendo Land on Wii U), so it would be a good game to track down if you're trying to avoid a Wii U as it provides one of the unique selling points of the Wii U, except its on the Gamecube."
Gamecube,296faf,Tricky_e,2,Thu Jun 26 20:33:45 2014 UTC,"All excellent suggestions, and I'd throw in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles as well.

Starfox Assault: It's a decent game with some pretty fun multiplayer modes.  Tales of Symphonia: It's an RPG where you can actually manually control all four party members with four players, but it's a long ass game. I managed to beat it with my brother, and we clocked in about 40 hours.  Mario Party 5: I don't know why I traded this game in, but I remember all of the mini-games being pretty fun.

Most expensive and best option is to get an early cube and component cables.   Second option is to get a wii with component cables.   3rd option is to get an svideo cable for your cube (most modern TV's don't have an svideo input)   If you're determined to play on your modern TV, an aftermarket scaler/deinterlacer will work wonders. I use a dvdo edge.   Last and cheapest option is to just get a tube TV. Sony trinitrons are incredible and you can find them as low as free on Craigslist /Kijiji."
Gamecube,28v1oh,Socksfelloff,3,Mon Jun 23 11:42:07 2014 UTC,"thanks, im unsure what input im using...its got the red, white and yellow plugs. Will look at the scaler you mentioned"
Gamecube,28v1oh,Socksfelloff,2,Mon Jun 23 12:42:11 2014 UTC,"That would be composite. As far as video is concerned the yellow plug is the only plug used.

Gamecube,28v1oh,PhotoJim99,2,Mon Jun 23 15:26:39 2014 UTC,"S-Video helps massively (if your TV has the capability - mine doesn't but my receiver upconverts and has S-Video ports).  Your best option might be to get an older Wii with the GameCube ports, and a component video cable - much cheaper than trying to find a GameCube with component cable (surprising but true).  Another option:  pick up an SD television, ideally one with S-Video.  These devices were made for them and the picture will be really good if the TV is in good condition."
Gamecube,28v1oh,Socksfelloff,1 point,Mon Jun 23 15:52:01 2014 UTC,As hard/expensive it is to get the gamecube component cables I suggest you take a look for wii component cables.

Gamecube,28v1oh,PhotoJim99,1 point,Mon Jun 23 15:58:54 2014 UTC,I'm surprised.  They're fairly simple to manufacture.  I have two sets - one I used with my Wii U due to a bug with Wii audio over HDMI.  I don't think I paid over $20 for either set.

It's called the ""SD Media Launcher"" and you can get it here: http://us.codejunkies.com/products/gcnwii-sd-media-launcher__ef000589.aspx  Basically, the way it works is it comes with a disc you put in your camecube. You put your homebrew apps on an SD card and insert it into the adapter (which in turn goes into one of the memory card slots).   Turn on the GC and you're presented with a menu of homebew apps on the SD card that you can launch.  There's actually a lot of different apps you can run including emulators but what you're looking for is a homebrew app called Swiss."
Gamecube,28noni,stuntmanmikey,2,Fri Jun 20 19:27:33 2014 UTC,I don't think that the Sd Media Launcher is the one used in the video as the memory card used with the kit is not inserted into the console and the sd reader is inside the disc housing.

Gamecube,28ef7v,Deviouscake,4,Tue Jun 17 20:35:12 2014 UTC,I like 7
Gamecube,28ef7v,Rapidzx,2,Tue Jun 17 23:01:51 2014 UTC,"I'd say 4 Is the best as the mini games are original and constantly fun to play, 5 is also good but there's less skill involved and more luck based events"
Gamecube,28ef7v,Notwithoutcause,2,Tue Jun 17 22:29:45 2014 UTC,7
Gamecube,28ef7v,timotie87,2,Wed Jun 18 02:28:47 2014 UTC,"My favorite is 5. Favorite mini-games, and it has great side modes (score competition, hockey, volley, custom vehicle fight).  I don't remember about the relative quality of the board game to the other mario party though (I never played much this mode)  If I'm not mistaken played 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8"
Gamecube,28ef7v,Powy,2,Wed Jun 18 06:52:07 2014 UTC,I really like 5. Mostly because of that one game mode where you could build your own tank and shoot each other down.
Gamecube,28ef7v,redditsucksdiscs,2,Wed Jun 18 15:14:11 2014 UTC,It has to be either 6 or 7.
Gamecube,28ef7v,LongHoang,1 point,Fri Jun 20 16:12:40 2014 UTC,"Six is my favorite. You don't have to pay to use items (except if you buy them) and the price of stars/minigame rules differ between day and night, which adds a bit more variety to the game. 5 would be my next choice. I thought 7 was a little weak."
Gamecube,28ef7v,batman_is_tired,2,Tue Jun 17 23:08:20 2014 UTC,"6 is interesting, because the Day/Night feature can really fuck you, or boost you depending on the action.  Which I feel can be too much random involved to make it un-fair seeming.  But if you play with others and your kicking ass at mini-games, then its okay for people to get it, and make it a bit of fairness."

Gamecube,28doo9,tomcatgunner1,2,Wed Jun 18 06:52:56 2014 UTC,"In my experience, the system is very solid. the official memory card also. But you should avoid second hand and unofficial controller. Yet my first controller still works perfectly. I would give a go to one of those packs"

Gamecube,28bd58,peterthomas6,1 point,Tue Jun 17 10:32:15 2014 UTC,"TS2 was hands down one of my favorite FPS, and the only one that made me question whether I thought GoldenEye was really as cracked up as everyone said. Sure, 007 has nostalgia and all that, but TS2 just had so much more to love. The main storyline was a little sketch, and you're kind of just plopped down in the middle of Siberia and that's it.  Also the Virus game mode? Epic. Pure euphoria. I also liked Assault a lot too. This is coming from someone who doesn't really like FPS games to begin with."
Gamecube,28bd58,cardflopper,1 point,Wed Jul 2 18:31:17 2014 UTC,"I totally agree, while 007's gameplay was great it just didn't have the charm TS2 had. I spent many a weekend playing this game with friends when I was younger."
Gamecube,28bd58,low_kix,1 point,Fri Jul 11 02:59:20 2014 UTC,Really fun game; had good times playing it with my younger cousin.  The amount of content in this game is very impressive; and it doesn't feel like filler. There are some very interesting modes for team and deathmatch play.
Gamecube,28bd58,BCProgramming,1 point,Sun Jul 6 17:06:10 2014 UTC,I bought this game recently because I've heard good things but have yet to play it. I think I'll do that so the come back and share my experience!
Gamecube,28ca72,Gamecubeboy,2,Tue Jun 17 03:51:18 2014 UTC,"you can't replace just the control stick mechanism, you need an entire new circuit board because its all one connected piece (when I say ""can't"" I don't mean its impossible I just mean it requires skills, patience, tools and equipment that most would not have). But you could try taking the shell off and removing the hair and other junk that gets stuck in the control stick mechanism.    and as far as the stick caps themselves, cheap knockoffs can be had easily on ebay"
Gamecube,28bnsg,FIRST_DATE_ANAL,2,Mon Jun 16 23:41:06 2014 UTC,Depends on what you mean by reasonable price. I've got one that I will probably never use. Any Wii U games you'd be willing to trade?
Gamecube,28bnsg,pathartl,1 point,Tue Jun 17 04:39:10 2014 UTC,I'm hoping to spend $50 or less. I also have Need for Speed U and Scribblenauts Unlimited that I'd be willing to trade.

On the off-chance that you and your friends have GBAs lying around and can track down the GCN to GBA cables, Loz: Four Swords Adventures is really quite fun. Can say the same for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, but like LoZ:FSA you need GBAs and cables."

Gamecube,289apn,tyrone118,1 point,Sun Jun 22 09:41:43 2014 UTC,"Animal Crossing is one of those games where you can play for as little or as much as you want each day, so it's perfect if you want to take a break from the other games you have on the go.  It has some multiplayer aspects to it, however the only one that involves simultaneous play with another person is if you are playing an unlocked NES game that has multiplayer. You can have up to four characters in the same town, although only one can play at a time, and you can also trade items to other people using codes."

Alternatively, Star Fox Assault was a pretty good party game too, due to the fact that (if enough multiplayer matches are played) you can have so many modes to choose from. And that's about it."

Gamecube,288ec6,Duwt,3,Sun Jun 15 22:26:48 2014 UTC,"Its tough cause this is a rare controller, and ideally you'd want it to be all original.  So by refurbishing it I think its looses some of its appeal, but ultimately no one wants a busted controller so I think by replacing the parts with better ones you would only be increasing the value of this otherwise semi-usable controller.  Its like this... Fully functional original controller (100% value) ""well-loved"" original controller (60% value) refurbished controller (80% value)"
Gamecube,288ec6,Gamecubeboy,3,Sun Jun 15 23:01:27 2014 UTC,"This indigo/clear controller is rare? I've got one from back during the gamecube's days that's still in pretty good condition, and I have no idea where we got it. I assumed that we simply got it with the console. I'm in New Zealand, so surely it wasn't only released in Japan? Huh, what would a fully functional one go for?"
Gamecube,288ec6,Tomling,3,Sun Jun 15 23:57:07 2014 UTC,"About as much as a normal indigo controller, maybe a little more.  I wouldn't personally call it ""rare"" so much as ""foreign"".  A better example of a rare controller would be the one that was clear on both sides.  That could go anywhere from 70 to 100 bucks.  Edit:  I just found one on ebay with English packaging, so it must have been released outside of japan at some point down the line.  If the thing's real, it would have had to be an incredibly limited release.  Like, less than the spice orange controller."

Gamecube,282ggn,misfitsfiend,4,Fri Jun 13 17:43:35 2014 UTC,"I posted my quickly made tutorial on the subreddit somewhere... let me go fetch it real quick.  EDIT: found it    Here's my process for painting my GameCubes: NOTE: I'll say this now since it'll get lost in the text. I sand ALMOST every coat, with 1000, 1500, and 2000 grit sand paper. I use 1000 grit for the primer, 2000 grit for the base, 1500 grit for the main color and 2000 for the clear coat. You don't have to sand every time, you only need to sand if before you start, the gamecube has some dings/scratches. And while you're waiting for it to dry, inspect the paint if it has a bit of texture/dust on it. Like I said before, I'm more of a visual explainer than a verbal one.   2 coats of Primer, both are medium coats. With the primer I use, XIM 400 White primer, I typically wait a day or two for it to dry so it can adhere properly (It's worth the wait because the bond will become very strong). This is what I use, it's pretty expensive though: https://go.o-geepaint.com/products/spray-xim-white-primer-sealer%7CXI30081.html I normally get it from my local Sherwin-Williams store, it costs around $17 there. 2 coats of the base color, IF the base coat I want isn't white. Typically wait about an hour between coats. I normally use the .99 cent black or gray MATTE spray paint at Walmart. I use matte because gloss can be a pain to paint over. Once you add the last coat, let it heal for 24 hours. 2-4 coats of the main color. I normally get my paint from home depot, Lowe's, Walmart, or Autozone (if I want to paint with metallic since automotive paint is very durable). Again, about an hour between coats. The first coat is a light coat, with the coats gradually get more dense. But not too dense where the paint starts to run. Try and use either Krylon or Rustoleum paint. Not like you won't find it wherever you go because they're typically the go-to spray paint. Once you add the last coat, let it heal for 24 hours. Finally, 4-8 coats of clear coat enamel. I normally do 4 coats if I'm using a gloss enamel. Or 8 coats if I'm using matte. An hour between coats is best and about medium coats throughout. Be careful with using matte clear coat, you have to look carefully to see if you're spraying evenly, because it's very easy for the paint to not be distributed evenly. Here's my choice for gloss: http://www.rustoleum.com/product-catalog/consumer-brands/stops-rust/crystal-clear-enamel/ And I'm still experimenting with matte clear, but here's my current go-to pick: http://www.rustoleum.com/product-catalog/consumer-brands/painters-touch-ultra-cover-2x/clear Right after adding the clear coat, let the pieces sit, wherever you're sitting them, for about a week so the clear coat and heal properly. This is where painting is tough for some because they'll assemble the console after the hour has passed. I've done that from time, and I'll normally mess it up somehow because the paint has only healed for about an hour. Knowing how to do this was natural for me, my dad is a housepainter with 25+ years experience, and I work with him part-time so the knowledge rubbed off onto me. I think I'm going to be making some how-to videos, so be looking forward to that. :) Again if you have any questions, let me know and I'll gladly help.   Sorry if it turns out to be on giant paragraph, I'm currently posting on mobile right now.  Also, I've yet to paint the jewel on a GameCube so I'm not too sure how I would go about painting that. I think lightly sanding it with 1000 grit under running water and letting it dry would help the primer stick better...... you know what. I'm going to try that right now. After the Spain vs. Netherlands game is over."
Gamecube,282ggn,VGIII,2,Fri Jun 13 19:57:21 2014 UTC,"Wow, awesome tutorial, I want to do this now. Would the same steps work on an original NES?"
Gamecube,282ggn,Brackner,3,Fri Jun 13 20:41:06 2014 UTC,"I don't see why not. It should be easier to sand too since it's very flat. The thing I would see a problem in is the power and reset buttons. I haven't played around with the NES much. Also I forgot to mention about the stickers. It's al a matter of personal preference.  I take them off completely then place them back on. The easier route would be carefully covering them. I say carefully be cause if you overshoot while covering it, once removed, the orinal color of whatever you're painting will still be there. If you under shoot it. Then you paint on top of the sticker."
Gamecube,282ggn,VGIII,2,Fri Jun 13 20:49:57 2014 UTC,I would most likely remove the stickers all together. Isn't the NES a bit more textured than the GCN though? Would it need more or less sanding because of this? How would I go about recoloring the buttons?  Thanks again for all the info!
Gamecube,282ggn,Brackner,5,Fri Jun 13 21:04:34 2014 UTC,"The NES is has a bit more texture on top half, but has nearly no texture on the bottom half. I would probably just take more time sanding because of the texture difference. With gamecubes, I do normally about 1 medium strength pass, then a second low strength pass afterwards. For the NES, I would 2 medium strength passes, or until I see that it'd enough to under on. You don't want to get rid of all the texture. Just enough so that the original texture and the newly created texture is enough for the primer to adhere too.   As  for the buttons..... I'm not too sure. I've never painted an NES before. Just 64s and GameCubes.  EDIT: Give me a few minutes while I disassemble my spare NES.  EDIT 2: Ok, so after further inspection, it is possible to take off the buttons. It's difficult to explain in words, so I'll try to see if I can make a picture tutorial.  EDIT 3: Here you go! Hope this helps! https://imgur.com/a/FyWKr"

Gamecube,27ew33,Brainforester,3,Thu Jun 5 20:38:27 2014 UTC,Im in the US and I have the same converter.  When I plug my NES or my SNES I get the same type black and white picture. My N64 or Game Cube however has no problem scaling the picture correctly with the composite or the S-video. Did you try turning you monitor off and on to detect the correct refresh rate? Thats about the only thing I can think of. Sorry if it doesn’t help.
Gamecube,27ew33,BondoMondo,1 point,Thu Jun 5 22:46:50 2014 UTC,"Hey thanks for the advice, but it didn't work. :( I made this album to help a little http://imgur.com/a/bvTJZ#0  As you can see there's something weird going on and the color is actually transmitted in the signal somehow."
Gamecube,27ew33,buMf00d,2,Fri Jun 6 07:18:50 2014 UTC,The monitor does not support 60hz. If you try to play 60Hz games on an old tv (or monitor in this case) it will always be in grey.   For tvs you had the option to use a different type of RGB cable so it would display at 60hz but seeing as you're using a PC monitor with VGA I think(!) you're out of luck.
Gamecube,27ew33,buMf00d,1 point,Fri Jun 6 07:30:57 2014 UTC,I am using VGA on a PC monitor. I googled a little bit more about my monitor and as far as I understand it should support up to 75hz... http://www.cnet.com/products/dell-1901fp/specs/ or is there something I don't understand here? Thanks for the answer.
Gamecube,27f2r0,TheDarkMusician,3,Thu Jun 5 21:43:09 2014 UTC,"honestly, completely remove the cable, remove a section of the rubber to expose the wires, re-attach via color coding, wrap in electrical tape done (for more of a professional look, you can get the same plastic overlay, at hardware stores, cut a section, slide it over the exposed wires, glue, or heat for a seal (your call, both work, I prefer heat so that there isn't that little line)) and viola you have a good as new cable"
Gamecube,27f2r0,tomcatgunner1,2,Thu Jun 5 23:01:12 2014 UTC,"+1 to that. Just cut the cable off were broken, strip the wires and reattach them all. (Should be color coded)  I have fixed tons of controllers this way."

Gamecube,27919b,PaintedBlack666,2,Wed Jun 4 01:40:00 2014 UTC,I have no problem selling double dash but melee I would have to think about. I would say about 15- 20 with double dash because I believe I only own the disc without the case.

Gamecube,27919b,SgtPhalen,1 point,Thu Jun 5 03:40:53 2014 UTC,Yeah if the price is right. Been looking for one for a while! As long as the disc is good and has the case that'd be great.

Someone chipped a hole through the cinderblock rear wall from outside the property and broke into the adjacent unit. All that was in there was a car, they got upset at doing all that work with nothing to steal and set the car on fire. That unit and two units to either side were lost before the fire could be contained. Thankfully, the insurance company replaced everything.  PSA: Make sure your possessions are insured before using a storage locker!"
Gamecube,274kkv,alexh86,3,Mon Jun 2 19:02:40 2014 UTC,"Yeah, should've buckled and paid the insurance fee. Only rented for a few months so I figured it was unnecessary, but lesson learned. Didn't have a huge collection, but lost a snes, a dreamcast, a genesis, and a neo geo cd with about 75ish decent games :(. On the plus side though, they stole some of my terrible artwork, so at least some people like it!"

Other people use it and Phantasy Star Episode 1+2 to load homebrew and backups onto their gamecubes as well, but I would not be one of those people. XD"

The GameCube controller is one of the easiest controllers to take apart and clean as long as you have a tri-wing screwdriver to open it up. Then it will be a Knight in SHINING Silver Armor.

Gamecube,26kwl1,mzajac14,2,Tue May 27 13:36:26 2014 UTC,"I only picked this up again recently - I just love it. It's so much fun to play and fling your monkey around.  The course design is really solid, loads of different elements to them, especially in the later and decidedly more challenging levels.   Overall, it's the simplicity of the gameplay that I adore - just get this monkey in a ball over there. That's it.   I haven't been able to play multiplayer since I picked it up, but I bet it would be great fun.  Having only picked it up last week I haven't completed all the Expert levels yet, got up to around level 20 I think. I keep losing all my lives on level 7."

FE7 and PoR are both great for a first game; they both have a good tutorial and both have a sequel if you liked the story. Heads up though, 8 is not 7's sequel, 6 is. 7 is actually a prequel to 6, and FE8 is just a standalone. Great game still, but easier."

The term ""video game console"" is used to distinguish a machine designed for consumers to use for playing video games on a separate television in contrast to arcade machines, handheld game consoles, or home computers.  Although Ralph Baer had built working game consoles by 1966, it was nearly a decade before PONG made them commonplace in home theaters. Through evolution over the years, game consoles have expanded to function as CD players, DVD players, web browsers, set-top boxes and more.

P.S. - Just my personal opinion but the way i differentiate collecting/hoarding is displaying. If you got 20 gamecubes sitting ina box in a corner where no one can see or touch then it's hoarding. Just my opinion.

Gamecube,26333v,pokemontrainerjoey,1 point,Wed May 21 06:46:51 2014 UTC,Hey is there a tutorial you used to paint your gamecubes. I wanted to do a custom nes. I want to know if I need to treat the plastic and what kind of paint to use. Thanks ! Nice collection !
Gamecube,26333v,donaldtrumpwinning,2,Wed May 21 17:34:17 2014 UTC,"I didn't use a tutorial, it's all common knowledge for me since I paint houses for a living. But I did write up a pretty detailed list of things I use for painting. Let me find it and I'll edit my message in a bit.   Edit: found it! Here's my process for painting my GameCubes: NOTE: I'll say this now since it'll get lost in the text. I sand ALMOST every coat, with 1000, 1500, and 2000 grit sand paper. I use 1000 grit for the primer, 2000 grit for the base, 1500 grit for the main color and 2000 for the clear coat. You don't have to sand every time, you only need to sand if before you start, the gamecube has some dings/scratches. And while you're waiting for it to dry, inspect the paint if it has a bit of texture/dust on it. Like I said before, I'm more of a visual explainer than a verbal one.  2 coats of Primer, both are medium coats. With the primer I use, XIM 400 White primer, I typically wait a day or two for it to dry so it can adhere properly (It's worth the wait because the bond will become very strong). This is what I use, it's pretty expensive though: https://go.o-geepaint.com/products/spray-xim-white-primer-sealer%7CXI30081.html I normally get it from my local Sherwin-Williams store, it costs around $17 there.  2 coats of the base color, IF the base coat I want isn't white. Typically wait about an hour between coats. I normally use the .99 cent black or gray MATTE spray paint at Walmart. I use matte because gloss can be a pain to paint over. Once you add the last coat, let it heal for 24 hours.  2-4 coats of the main color. I normally get my paint from home depot, Lowe's, Walmart, or Autozone (if I want to paint with metallic since automotive paint is very durable). Again, about an hour between coats. The first coat is a light coat, with the coats gradually get more dense. But not too dense where the paint starts to run. Try and use either Krylon or Rustoleum paint. Not like you won't find it wherever you go because they're typically the go-to spray paint. Once you add the last coat, let it heal for 24 hours.  Finally, 4-8 coats of clear coat enamel. I normally do 4 coats if I'm using a gloss enamel. Or 8 coats if I'm using matte. An hour between coats is best and about medium coats throughout. Be careful with using matte clear coat, you have to look carefully to see if you're spraying evenly, because it's very easy for the paint to not be distributed evenly. Here's my choice for gloss: http://www.rustoleum.com/product-catalog/consumer-brands/stops-rust/crystal-clear-enamel/ And I'm still experimenting with matte clear, but here's my current go-to pick: http://www.rustoleum.com/product-catalog/consumer-brands/painters-touch-ultra-cover-2x/clear  Right after adding the clear coat, let the pieces sit, wherever you're sitting them, for about a week so the clear coat and heal properly. This is where painting is tough for some because they'll assemble the console after the hour has passed. I've done that from time, and I'll normally mess it up somehow because the paint has only healed for about an hour.  Knowing how to do this was natural for me, my dad is a housepainter with 25+ years experience, and I work with him part-time so the knowledge rubbed off onto me. I think I'm going to be making some how-to videos, so be looking forward to that. :) Again if you have any questions, let me know and I'll gladly help.  Sorry if it turns out to be on giant paragraph, I'm currently posting on mobile right now."

Gamecube,25sosf,tas197,3,Sat May 17 15:44:20 2014 UTC,Get it resurfaced
Gamecube,25sosf,n0cus,2,Sun May 18 04:04:38 2014 UTC,"This is probably your best bet, what n0cus said. See if there are any shops nearby that offer resurfacing. All it takes is a scratch deep enough across the TOC of the disc for it to not play.   If you have the money, you can get one of the resurfacing kits and do it yourself. However, I strongly recommend getting one of the decent models, and this can be a definite YMMV experience. However, you might be shelling out just as much money to simply order a new/better condition disc if you go that route."
Gamecube,25sosf,illegalsandwiches,1 point,Mon May 26 04:04:06 2014 UTC,Can you get me a link to a few resurfacing kits on Amazon?
Gamecube,25sosf,ObesityNinja,1 point,Fri Jun 6 23:04:05 2014 UTC,"I can try. The SkipDr's in my opinion can be hit or miss; I've had good luck and bad luck with them, as there is really no way to determine how ""repaired"" the disc is unless you take it out, whip off all the white/grey gunk, and check it. You can potentially use a SkipDr to grind down a disc right to the label.   Aleratech units are pretty good: http://www.amazon.com/Aleratec-240131-Disc-Repair-Plus/dp/B000E4K2GO/ref=sr_1_3/182-6505880-2674130?s=audio-video-accessories&ie=UTF8&qid=1402102665&sr=1-3  There are some on there that I have only heard, by name, like the Digital Innovation ones. But, you are looking at spending 25-35 for a decent disc cleaning and resurfacing doodad that may clean your disk up.   I would almost check around to see if there is a place located in your town, or near you, that would clean. Most retro game shops in my area will repair discs for 3-4 dollars."

If it were me, surrounded by a few places that offer it, I would take it to them. If I had a few discs that I would like cleaned up, I would order a kit.   I would start your journey by consulting the Google Overlord and searching for retro game stores/movie stores/second hand stores that may offer these services. If you are located in the US, there is a chain of stores called ""Play n Trade"" that offer CD/DVD/Game disc repair. I have heard of some Gamestop/EB locations that used to offer it, back in the day. There are also some places online that you can send your disc to and they will repair it, for a fee of course."

Gamecube,25rc8y,Gamecubeboy,1 point,Sat May 17 02:52:18 2014 UTC,"That's cool, man! My SO and I decided to get a gamecube with lots of party games for social gatherings at our apartment. It really is the coolest console I've owned and it makes me want to get the Wii U instead of the other consoles (originally had my heart set on the ps4).   I also discovered the awesomeness that is ebay couple of days ago. Managed to snag 20 games (sadly just cds) for 65 gbp. It had smash bros, kirby air ride, luigi's mansion etc etc.   I can't wait for them to arrive!"

Gamecube,25qlrj,Stereosexual,2,Fri May 16 20:04:51 2014 UTC,"The more adaptors you use the more likely the signal will be slightly delayed.   Your best bet for the clearest signal would be to find a gamecube component cable (which is around $200ish), or use a Wii with component output to play the games in the highest quality the actual GC hardware could output.  That being said, hooking the gamecube to the tv with composite would be perfectly acceptable, but less clear than S-video would be. It's a matter of tradeoffs."
Gamecube,25qlrj,retnuh730,1 point,Fri May 16 21:59:13 2014 UTC,"Oh there's no doubt that it does, but for most people its more reasonable to grab a wii for $40-60 than a set of component for $200. Wish I would have grabbed them when they were $70 a year ago."
Gamecube,25qlrj,legodawg0088,0,Tue May 20 04:09:43 2014 UTC,I figure S-video (already have the cable) to HDMI wouldn't be bad. Pretty much just wondering which adapter would be best for this.

From the (very) brief amount of time spent playing it, I'm not a huge fan so far. It tries to tack on some of the RPG like elements of the GB games, but then wraps it up in a VERY slow paced platformer like the old-school games. I much prefer the original Mega Man / X titles, and only bought this to help with my Mega Man collection. That being said, I will probably give it another shot at a later time."

If you really enjoy building chip folders and dont mind some platforming and SO MANY METAURS, its a good time.   It just sucks that you can't actually move around as lan, he just teleports to places on the map. Stuff like this is just dissapointing from capcom. MMBN was already a small playerbase and it just alienates them furthur. Theres a lot they could do with the IP but dont. I think it would be cool to see megaman battle network come back a free to play mmo style game, with more navis simultaneously on bigger grids.

Gamecube,24qgti,Cephelopodia,2,Mon May 5 02:53:20 2014 UTC,Fzero always contained the Arcade tracks. You just have to finish the game properly.
Gamecube,24qgti,longjohndevine,1 point,Mon May 5 09:29:14 2014 UTC,I thought that the way to access it was by plugging your memory card into the arcade F-zero then into your GC.
Gamecube,24qgti,SirSparkle,1 point,Mon May 5 13:30:37 2014 UTC,"That was one way to do it, yes. You could take your memory card back and forth and unlock new tracks and cars between the machines.

Gamecube,24qgti,Cephelopodia,0,Mon May 5 17:48:06 2014 UTC,"No, you finish the game in master mode, and it gives you the tracks. (I don't remember buying them with the tickets in the shop, but the link below says that it is required)  It's not actually FZero AX, its FZero GX with an AX cup featuring the tracks from the arcade version.  They have always been available. I cannot understand the way so many people talk about this as if its a big secret. When the real secret is, that they simply aren't good enough at games nor have the patience to actually finish their games.  AND THEN SPEND THEIR TIME COMPLAINING THAT A NEW FZERO HASNT BEEN ANNOUNCED, WHEN THEY HAVENT EVEN FINISHED THE LAST ONE!!!   It's pretty hard I guess, I couldn't do it again without practice, but back when I actually finished the game, I was good enough to do all those requirements on Master repeatedly.  Was playing GX recently and must admit I've lost my touch, but it wouldn't take much practice to get back up to speed.  http://www.gamefaqs.com/gamecube/560617-f-zero-gx/cheats http://www.gamefaqs.com/gamecube/560617-f-zero-gx/answers?qid=42019  Do you know that Rainbow Road is the last track in Mariokart???!

Gamecube,24qgti,HughRistik,1 point,Mon May 5 20:46:54 2014 UTC,"It always had the tracks and characters unlockable, yes. But the recent discovery of that the entire code for AX is there, as well.

Gamecube,24qgti,longjohndevine,1 point,Mon May 5 17:53:25 2014 UTC,"To me, it's more about being able to finally play an arcade game I was never able to find in an arcade, as close as possible to the original.  You can still beat the GP on Master any time you like. I did some years ago, and then my save file got corrupted... Don't feel like going through that again, but I would like to take a spin around those otherwise unobtainable tracks in new cars.   To each their own I guess."

Gamecube,24pwed,steelserenity,1 point,Sun May 4 20:41:09 2014 UTC,"I love Value Village - I love thrift store hopping (and I've been to my fair share) but Value Village always seems to have the best finds! Congrats, enjoy your awesome new stuff! :D"
Gamecube,24phwl,lowonbits,3,Sun May 4 18:03:34 2014 UTC,I thought I would share some Gamecube finds I just now got around to posting about. I mainly go for cartridge based games but didn't want to pass these up. And I recently found a great deal on a Gamecube.
Gamecube,24phwl,Opask,3,Sun May 4 18:04:59 2014 UTC,"Keep up with your blog thing, I enjoyed looking through all your posts!  Good Job on fixing that copy of battletoads by the way its a great and humorous game."
Gamecube,24phwl,Lazlogator,1 point,Mon May 5 02:44:55 2014 UTC,"I envy you so, so much dude, you can almost never find this stuff where I live! It was a great find, especially that Pokemon XD! Great idea to post this btw, I like looking at others collections and finds."
Gamecube,24qa5o,Deviouscake,3,Sun May 4 23:11:25 2014 UTC,"It's for GBA to GBA stuff, like trading Pokemon and what not. So you'd need a GBA to do stuff with it.   It has nothing to do with GC games. To do the LotR tie in stuff you need a GC to GBA cable."
Gamecube,24qa5o,Gamecubeboy,2,Mon May 5 00:59:05 2014 UTC,Its for the gba link cable.  Anything you could do with two gba's you can also do with your gameboy player and a gba  http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/164924/2486361-gba_link_cable_en.jpg

Gamecube,24nxam,___heisenberg,5,Sun May 4 01:50:46 2014 UTC,"nice list. i think melee deserves 1-10 and pikmin and paper mario got robbed. never played a few of these, also"
Gamecube,24nxam,_HeroOfTime,3,Sun May 4 02:00:39 2014 UTC,"dude i missed out as a child- only got pikmin 2 yrs ago... if i played it for as long as i played the games ahead of it, it might have been higher"
Gamecube,24nxam,HoneyBear55,3,Sun May 4 02:03:51 2014 UTC,Good list except I noticed you didn't have the Legend of Zelda the Wind Waker or Twilight Princess.  Just not a Zelda fan?
Gamecube,24nxam,HoneyBear55,1 point,Sun May 4 04:01:17 2014 UTC,yeah thats it- i don't know why just never really happened for me
Gamecube,24nxam,HoneyBear55,2,Sun May 4 04:05:39 2014 UTC,"Eternal Darkness deserves a mention. Nonetheless, this is a solid list."
Gamecube,24nxam,longjohndevine,2,Sun May 4 04:13:11 2014 UTC,never got around to playing it- whats it like?
Gamecube,24nxam,potentialPizza,3,Sun May 4 04:15:16 2014 UTC,"It plays like Resident Evil, but is very unique in some of its storytelling and innovations. You play as several characters throughout centuries of history all dealing with the impending return of evil gods that slumber within the Earth. Your characters have a sanity meter which heightens hallucinations. It's super spooky and will totally mess with your head, even going so far as to tell you your save file is corrupted or controller is unplugged even when it isn't. At the time, it was the most unique game I'd ever played."
Gamecube,24nxam,Deviouscake,2,Sun May 4 04:25:54 2014 UTC,well then it makes sense that game isn't on my list- most of these i got while i was a child. now that I'm 17 i would really enjoy something like that though
Gamecube,24nxam,shortydude3932,1 point,Sun May 4 04:28:13 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it's not at all a kid's game. The supernatural stuff is spooky even by today's standards."
Gamecube,24nxam,Sirge,1 point,Sun May 4 04:30:05 2014 UTC,I wouldnt consider it on top 20 gamecube. Wouldnt put it above REmake.  The list is strange. Its his favourite games from his collection and not the best games for gamecube.  No zelda. Metroid prime in 19th lol.
Gamecube,24nxam,Newwackydeli,2,Sun May 4 09:41:20 2014 UTC,The fact that Kirby Air Ride isn't there means you haven't played it.
Gamecube,24nxam,FlameMammoth,2,Sun May 4 04:59:05 2014 UTC,i swear if i had a few honorable mentions it would be there; such a fun game
Gamecube,24nxam,FlameMammoth,2,Sun May 4 05:03:02 2014 UTC,No zelda games?
Gamecube,24nxam,FlameMammoth,1 point,Sun May 4 23:13:16 2014 UTC,No Custom Robo? I apologize to your deprived childhood
