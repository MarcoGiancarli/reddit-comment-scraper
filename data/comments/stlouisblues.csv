stlouisblues,3dz61w,BigStick7,32,Mon Jul 20 18:42:41 2015 UTC,Play better than Oshie.
stlouisblues,3dz61w,Vanscoten,12,Mon Jul 20 19:25:24 2015 UTC,"He's just not as good as Oshie, plain and simple. I think Brouwer will be a solid player for us, but don't expect him to come in here and tear shit up."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,gruesome2some,29,Mon Jul 20 20:16:41 2015 UTC,Osh never really tore it up for us. I expect Brouwer to play a better sixty minute game than Oshie. But we'll just have to wait and see.
stlouisblues,3dz61w,Vanscoten,6,Mon Jul 20 20:17:54 2015 UTC,"I'd be ecstatic if brouwer can match Oshie on a sixty minute game. Don't expect him to match oshie in any sense. Brouwer will likely fill a bottom 6 roll and we'll need Stastny, fabbri or jaskin to fill the hole Oshie left. It sure won't be brouwer. There's a reason it was a 3 for 1 trade. Don't expect one of the return players to fill the loss. The main complaint was Oshie playoff production, but that doesn't seem to be mentioned for brouwer.  Look at top 90 players points per game and Oshie is right in the heart year over year. Not a super star but a legit first line player that also kills penalties and plays sound defense.   This move might be the right one but it's disappointing how much the fan base is shitting on Oshie now..."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,Thats_Debatable,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:21:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, and I also think that we don't need Brouwer to fill Oshie's hole. I'd prefer Brouwer takes over for Jaskin on the 3rd line and we give Jaskin a crack at the top 6 and see how he handles it. I'm just afraid we will be gun shy and put Jaskin back on the 3rd line if he doesn't produce right away. He is young and that will come with some growing pains, but I think it will be worth it if we can turn Jaskin into a 2nd line winger."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,gruesome2some,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:00:48 2015 UTC,"My concern with moving Jaskin up is balancing his delevopment and Stastnys impact. Stastny is a great playmaker and imo made Jaskin look more complete than he was. Still a young player and is continuing to develop. So, might become a legit top 6 player this season or next."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,Thats_Debatable,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:45:28 2015 UTC,TLDR: vanscoten's comment was debatable.
stlouisblues,3dz61w,notoriousTRON,26,Tue Jul 21 16:43:10 2015 UTC,"He was literally one of the hottest players in the league for over a month in both of the last 2 seasons.  Sure, he was never an elite player and never will be, but Blues fans shitting all over him after this trade is getting real old, real fast.  I think it was a necessary move, but I for one, appreciate the impact Oshie made in his time in St. Louis."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,gruesome2some,11,Mon Jul 20 20:23:45 2015 UTC,"Hey now, I'm not shitting on Oshie. I love the impact he had on the fanbase, he was for sure the fan favorite for like seven seasons.   I do expect Brouwer to be better on our team though. He's an assistant captain, something Oshie never was. Brouwer has averaged more goals than Oshie during the seasons, Oshie does have more assists and points however.   But Oshie's value took a huge drop when OT went to three on three. Less chance for a SO, less chance for Oshie to shine as the skill player he is."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,Vanscoten,14,Mon Jul 20 20:44:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't meant to imply that you were shitting on Oshie cuz you really weren't. I've just seen it all over /r/hockey and this sub since the trade happened.  Also, Oshie was an alternate captain here.   And his value didn't really drop all that much from the 3 on 3 OT because GM's aren't too concerned about how good a player is in the shootout, they care about what you do during the actual game itself. Your shootout ability is the last thing they are worried about."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,gruesome2some,2,Mon Jul 20 21:11:07 2015 UTC,"He was an assistant captain, you're right, not sure what I was thinking there. But all I'm saying is that I expect Brouwer to at least put up the same numbers as Osh, maybe even a bit better."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,Vanscoten,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:44 2015 UTC,"Prepare to be disappointed. Brouwer doesn't have even close to the offensive ability Oshie does. People have hyped up his goal scoring being supposedly better than Oshies, but he scored fewer 5on5 goals/60 than Oshie. Assists aren't even remotely close. If Fabbri has a great camp, Brouwer may find himself on the fourth line opening night."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,Thallis,4,Tue Jul 21 18:34:35 2015 UTC,"Why would you expect Brouwer to be better?   A few extra goals during the season? They both have scored 0.25 goals per game for their career. Oshie adds better defensive positioning, and better playmaking.  Brouwer brings some size and physicality.  I'm really curious as to what you think Brouwer will bring."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,bluemandan,9,Mon Jul 20 21:30:49 2015 UTC,"This is what sucks and I think it's what this article was getting at.  Brouwer is going to be compared straight up to Oshie now. But without all his powerplay points with Ovechkin/Backstrom, and playing defensive minutes in our system, I'd probably peg him for 30-35 points. Oshie could easily pass 60 with his new linemates. That'll suck for Brouwer."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,medkit,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:48:47 2015 UTC,"For one thing, Brouwer is 6'2"" and Oshie is 5'11"", size is something you can't teach. You said it yourself, Brouwer brings size and physicality. We can't really say much until we watch him play in the Blues system. I mean, a few extra goals could help. Brouwer also brings much needed playoff experience, he's been there way more than Oshie."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,Vanscoten,3,Mon Jul 20 22:35:46 2015 UTC,"For one thing, Brouwer is 6'2"" and Oshie is 5'11"", size is something you can't teach.   AND THIS RIGHT HERE, THIS IS BIG CASS. HE'S SEVEN FOOT TALL, AND YOU. CANT. TEACH. THAT."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,CowboyMarv,0,Mon Jul 20 23:33:10 2015 UTC,"have you ever watched Brouwer? he hits people but with very little effect. a difference of 3 inches is irrelevant. There is nothing Brouwer does better than Oshie. Playoff experience is just great, that's what we need. That's why Arnott and Langenbrunner and Ott all made such an impact. Brouwer has much worse playoff production stats than Oshie, which I didn't think could be possible."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,JustPlainSimpleGarak,3,Tue Jul 21 00:18:29 2015 UTC,"Brouwer does not have ""much worse"" playoff stats than Oshie, they have very similar points per game in the playoffs. Brouwer is also a lot closer to his regular season production in the playoffs than Oshie is."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,gruesome2some,-2,Tue Jul 21 12:55:56 2015 UTC,"Be honest, do you have an Oshie Jersey that you wear to bed every night?"
stlouisblues,3dz61w,Skinflaps55,2,Tue Jul 21 00:32:58 2015 UTC,Nah I don't. I stopped buying jerseys with names after I got burned hard by one Erik Johnson.  I wouldn't mind a Steen jersey though. Maybe a less common guy like Jaskin.
stlouisblues,3dz61w,gruesome2some,2,Tue Jul 21 12:57:28 2015 UTC,Man.  I love me some Erik Johnson.  ;)
stlouisblues,3dz61w,psychedellosaurus,2,Tue Jul 21 13:37:35 2015 UTC,"I'm glad he is working out for you guys, that one curly headed kid we got in return has been okay ;)  But seriously, if you happen to have a Shattenkirk or Stastny jersey we should definitely trade!"
stlouisblues,3dz61w,gruesome2some,3,Tue Jul 21 13:43:06 2015 UTC,"Ah, man.  I'd so trade you if I had either of those jerseys!  And I agree, I don't think the trade has ended too terribly for either of us.  :)  Seriously, though.  December 13.  I'll be there, and I can't wait!"
stlouisblues,3dz61w,psychedellosaurus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:45:42 2015 UTC,"Safest jersey buys right now would probably be Pietrangelo(assuming he continues to sign here I don't see him retiring anywhere else, unless he plays a few years elsewhere at the end of his career), Steen(a bit older but he seems to like it here and isn't showing signs of slowing down anytime soon) or Tarasenko(obvious)."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,alexfig88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:21:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just kind of came to terms with the fact that in the salary cap era is it hard to keep players their whole career or even that long unless they are one of your franchise players.  If I got a jersey with a name now, I think I would rather go with a more obscure player that I like. Something that most fans wouldn't be wearing at a game."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,gruesome2some,4,Tue Jul 21 18:29:18 2015 UTC,I'd go for a Reaves(less common but you can still find them) or maybe a Jaskin like you said.  Or go crazy and get a Brodeur :)
stlouisblues,3dz61w,alexfig88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:46:10 2015 UTC,I'd imagine no one has a PRV jersey lol.
stlouisblues,3dz61w,gruesome2some,9,Tue Jul 21 18:59:33 2015 UTC,"Agree with you completely here. People have really turned against Oshie on the various forums. But he can crack 60 points, which is very valuable, and plays a strong defensive game too. He took a paycut contract for St. Louis and was a fan favorite for a struggling franchise. He was a very solid first liner no matter how you cut it. He just wasn't elite.  But Brouwer isn't either, and he's not a first liner like Oshie was. He's not going to bring the points OR the defense OR the ticket sales that Oshie brought. It's a bad fucking trade. I do like Brouwer and I wish him the best. I'm going to do my best to not hold the trade against him personally but I'm sure the greater fanbase will once they see him on the third line."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,medkit,5,Mon Jul 20 23:42:32 2015 UTC,"it's so confusing to see these people who hate on Oshie and try to discount him / say things like ""I'm glad he's gone"" or ""we're better off without him"" as if it's some kind of addition by subtraction scenario. There's the (painfully) vocal minority on HFB that makes me wonder if I'm watching the same games as them."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,JustPlainSimpleGarak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:24:04 2015 UTC,"There with you.  I just don't see how they passed over Berglund and moved to Oshie instead.  Ntc blablablah he's never going to ""blossom"" and he is dead weight.  Keep hoping, Hitchstrong."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,Sobie17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:16:55 2015 UTC,"Well Hitch wasn't the one who moved Oshie, the Capitals may not have been interested in Berglund, and Berglund has not been a part of the leadership during the last 4 years but Oshie has."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,gruesome2some,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:22:48 2015 UTC,"Sure, but don't you think there is input from coaching staff before trades?  I'm not saying Berglund was necessarily going to be moved for Brouwer.  But, it's like they don't even shop him for picks or trades to at least free up cap space.  It's almost as if they're satisfied with mediocrity."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,Sobie17,2,Tue Jul 21 15:17:23 2015 UTC,"Sure there is, but that is all. They give their two cents and then Army makes his own decisions.  What gives you the impression that Berglund has not been shopped around? Because I get the opposite impression. The last 2 years at every ""high trade"" point of the season Berglund's name has been mentioned in several rumors. That tells me that teams know he is available and have at least talked to Army about it, but he felt like the right deal wasn't on the table so he didn't pull the trigger.  Berglund is not the problem with our team, and he is excellent at his current role on the team and he actually performed better in the playoffs than he did during the regular season. We need more guys like that on our team, not less. Unless we are getting a great return for him I don't want him to be moved for the sake of moving him."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,gruesome2some,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:26:20 2015 UTC,"This was not a 1 for 1 trade. Calling it a ""bad fucking trade"" this early is just plain stupid. We picked up the Caps' #1 goalie prospect and a 3rd, which is nothing to sneeze at."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,balls_of_glory,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:42:38 2015 UTC,"I sneeze at it. Goalie prospects aren't worth much at all, especially this early in their development, and can be picked up easily with late picks. Copley wasn't Washington's #1 goalie prospect either. Grubauer is and he's the same age (23). And Holtby is only 25. Copley has only played 26 games in the AHL, I'm not really buying that he's the next Patrick Roy.  A third round pick is a throw-in too. I evidence this by the fact that 90% of this sub probably doesn't even remember why we didn't have ours this year. Look back at the third round of a draft like 2010 or 2011: It's a dice roll.  If you think these throw-ins make a significant part of the trade you're simply wrong. The move was for Brouwer. Play the ""early"" card all you want, but on the face of it this trade sucked and was just a change for the sake of change."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,medkit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:14 2015 UTC,"Also we have a LOT of quality goalie prospects at the moment.  Allen is still young, then we have Binnington, Husso, Copley, Lundstrom, that guy from St. Louis(Luke something?) and some other guy in Finland IIRC.  Granted only a few might actualy turn into something but it's interesting Army chose a goalie prospect over a forward prospect, something we sorta need.  Oh well, I'm sure he knows what he's doing."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,alexfig88,0,Tue Jul 21 18:24:28 2015 UTC,Oshie is better than Brouwer. 3rd round picks are usually shit. Goalie prospects more often than not are shit as well. The trade was shit.
stlouisblues,3dz61w,EastSaintBoogieMan,6,Wed Jul 22 01:32:24 2015 UTC,"Honest question,  Why is Brouwer always called a veteran at 29, but Oshie isn't at 28?"
stlouisblues,3dz61w,Jimmers1231,16,Tue Jul 21 03:32:15 2015 UTC,Because Oshie still looks like he is a freshman in college.
stlouisblues,3dz61w,minorthreat21,7,Tue Jul 21 05:59:07 2015 UTC,And Bouwmeester looks like his high school math teacher.
stlouisblues,3dz61w,hd186,4,Tue Jul 21 13:17:33 2015 UTC,Because he has more playoff experience and acts a little more mature?
stlouisblues,3dz61w,TheGhost-of-Abbazaba,2,Tue Jul 21 12:14:03 2015 UTC,"I think it has something to do with Oshie being labeled as one of the new ""kids"" that were brought into the organization to turn things around. He was an essential part of this new era and the re-branding of the franchise."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,gruesome2some,9,Tue Jul 21 13:32:53 2015 UTC,I think Brouwer reads like a Backes type.
stlouisblues,3dz61w,mdknights_23,4,Mon Jul 20 21:25:44 2015 UTC,"I think he'd be perfect for 3rd line RW, but Jaskin is a perfect fit there as well. I love his style of play, but you don't hear about a lot of 2nd line grinders."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,The_Tarasenkshow,7,Mon Jul 20 22:22:58 2015 UTC,"In a perfect world, Dmitrij would make the leap to 2RW this season.   Not saying he will, but he has some experience under his belt and has been projected to be a top 6 forward. It would be huge for the Blues if he could."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,ae_89,2,Tue Jul 21 04:29:31 2015 UTC,"I hope we at least try Jaskin out for the first half of the season at 2RW. He seems like he could be a very good 2nd liner, but we have to be willing to let him make some mistakes and not take ice time away from him when it happens.   If it still hasn't worked out around January we can try Brouwer out in that spot, pick up a rental at the trade deadline, or even move Backes back to RW."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,gruesome2some,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:55 2015 UTC,"I agree, in a perfect world that would happen. However, then we would have no place for Rattie. Our RW is very confusing, especially considering that Frank and Lehtera almost always play together, despite Lehtera being a 2/3C and Frank being a 1RW."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,The_Tarasenkshow,5,Tue Jul 21 12:10:42 2015 UTC,"Rattie hasn't even shown that he can contribute effectively in the NHL, while Jaskin obviously has. I don't see why we would potentially stunt a players progression just to save a spot for an undersized forward who hasn't proven a damn thing.   Rattie's clock is ticking, hopefully he can get it together this season."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,gruesome2some,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:28:14 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think Jaskin should take precedent, but we should realize we are jam packed on the RW."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,The_Tarasenkshow,4,Tue Jul 21 16:46:00 2015 UTC,I think the overlooked part of Brouwer is that he's gotten 43 point in the last two year with 3rd line minutes. I think he could get pretty close to oshie's production if he played some 1st or 2nd line here and there.
stlouisblues,3dz61w,TheeVande,3,Tue Jul 21 16:58:11 2015 UTC,"Oshie and Brouwer put up just about the same goals per 60 minutes 5x5 time over the last three seasons (0.69 vs 0.67), but Oshie doubled Brouwer in A/60 (1.31 vs 0.65). Oshie played about an extra 1.5 minutes at 5x5 a game.  Oshie did have slightly better teammates 5x5, but a significant part of Brouwer's production comes on the PP, where Brouwer had the luxury of playing with Alex Ovechkin and Nicklas Backstrom. Oshie actually beats Brouwer at P/60 on the PP (4.82 vs 4.46), but Brouwer's goal totals were bolstered by a ridiculous personal shooting percentage (over 20%!) and again, excellent teammates.  Finally, over the last three seasons, Brouwer ranks sixth among Washington forwards in 5x5 TOI/G (4th if we discount Mike Ribiero and Mikhail Grabovsky, who were each there for only one season), and first among right wings. Saying he was playing 3rd line minutes is just wrong. He was a 2nd line winger who got some time on the first line, especially on the PP."
stlouisblues,3dz61w,lugnut92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:47 2015 UTC,Well I stand corrected.
stlouisblues,3dz61w,TheeVande,3,Wed Jul 22 00:13:57 2015 UTC,"He was on the 1st PP unit with Backstrom, Ovechkin, and Green for the past 3 years because he's big. Take away the points there and he scores less than Berglund with more minutes."
stlouisblues,3dzn4f,bleedblue002,5,Mon Jul 20 20:44:13 2015 UTC,Because he almost definitely wouldn't make Canada's team.

stlouisblues,3dwz8s,bluemandan,5,Mon Jul 20 12:32:20 2015 UTC,"Good list, I feel like Barclay Plager has to crack the defense somewhere, and CuJo, Glenn Hall, and Jacques Plante are hard to leave out of the goalie discussion.

I helped Ryan Reaves buy a TV, Oshie bought like 5 iPads once, Kelly Chase even came in during a shift once to get his home theater set up.  Halak returned a portable/travel DVD player once.  This was when he was out with a hand injury.  I asked him how the hand was doing and he seemed significantly surprised I recognized him.  He said ""OK"" and was pretty quiet the whole time."

I met Brad Boyes, DJ King, and all the rest from that dismal year.  The highlight came when I meet Andy Murray. I shook his hand and told him it was an honor to meet him. Then I asked for a favor since it was my last game of the season. He asked what it was.   I asked him to bench Eric Brewer. Flabbergasted the coach began to site Brewers many accomplishments including winning the gold cup for the Canadians.   I told him I understand but he's a defenseman, and he shouldn't go behind the opposing teams net so often. That's why we gave up so many breakaway goals that year. I also told him it was rude of me to ask such a favor and that it's his team and he needn't listen to me. Then apologized as I walked away.

Sobotka came in to buy chewing tobacco (skoal extra pouches).  He threw down his hundo to pay, and I told him I was a big fan and wished him luck.  He didn't really have much to say -- his english isn't great.    The next night he scored the game winning goal against the Sharks in the playoffs and then broke Dominic Moore's nose in an end of game scrap.  All while chewing that dip I sold him.

stlouisblues,3dvx79,danglebot,6,Mon Jul 20 05:41:01 2015 UTC,"I was pretty young and was on a mini-mite team in Kirkwood that had named itself the Mini Blues. Now, I was young so this actually may have happened the next year when I was a Mite playing for the Kirkwood Stars, but the point is I was young.  We were wrapping up a practice when out of nowhere this huge guy gets on the ice. So, little me thinks it's just another coach so I pay no attention to him while the rest of the team is losing their minds and skating over to him. It was Bryce Salvador. So he started playing in a little scrimmage that we ended the practice with and when I got off the ice I finally learned who he was!  I also met Joel Quenneville at the Chesterfield rink a couple times, Jamie Kompon at camps at Kirkwood, Craig and Jay Woodcroft at Northern Edge hockey camps at Kirkwood, Al Macinnis (can't remember where, I was young), and Brett Hull at a stick and puck! Growing up in St. Louis was definitely memorable! Unrelated but my uncle and I also met Pujols at a car wash one time!  Edit: Finally home so I can edit this part in: I got off the phone with my dad and apparently little me also met Rik Wilson and Bernie Federko, and the part I do remember is playing against Keith Tkachuk's son's team out in Creve Cour. He was the head coach of that time so I actually got to meet him multiple times!"

At the time, I worked at a radio station that carried the games. On our way there, I stopped at the studio and grabbed a mini disc recorder and a mic. When we got there, I asked one of the bar employees if I could talk to some of the players. They sent me to a back room, where all of the players were just hanging out.  There were legit media people in there too, but I was secretly basically just a fan who had a microphone.  I stayed back there all night, eating pizza and such with Tyson Nash,Scott Mellanby, Brent Johnson, Fred Braithwaite, Sasha Khavinov, and a handful of other players. My friends that I was with were pretty jealous, because they had to pay $5 for a handshake and an autograph out in the bar area. It was pretty cool."

A small town, Oakawville, I think 1000 people ish (45 min across the river on the ILL side) had a kickball tournament.  I had been in it several years in a row.  We played the first few games then people heard rumors that Petro was playing, I was just like, um ok whatever, no way but ok.  Then low and behold, the next game we played them.  We lost by 2 runs on a bullshit call (I was fired up, alcohol may have played into it)  After the game Alex came up and said it was a BS call and my team should have won.  Was pretty sick.  We chatted for about 45 min and had a beer or two until he had to play again.  I didnt even ask for an autograph tbh, it was just amazing talking to him for that long and have a beer.  He actually ended up parking next to me and I had a month old F150 Raptor  and he said he wishes he could afford one, lol.  It was a few months before his big contract."

stlouisblues,3dvx79,HoldMaahDick,3,Mon Jul 20 15:05:05 2015 UTC,"2009, I went to a random Golf tournament at Old Hickory in St. Peters, Mo. that was put on by a Printer Maintenance Company (had boards ad) that had raised funds with the Blues for a Charity. Saw that there was a Blues jersey up for raffle. I put in $40 for the charity because I thought it would be cool to get an authentic jersey of my favorite team and give to charity at the same time. Golf begins and I get pretty damn drunk. Then I hear in my stupporness that there is an actual player playing with us on the course. I am, of course freaking out at the prospect of seeing a Blue.  So, of course I am kicking ass (in my own mind) and just have a great, but nervously anxious time. We get done and all the nerves go away when I was handed a 10 oz pork steak. I am furiously eating away when I hear the raffle is going on. As most do, I am secretly only interested in the jersey I donated to. Then the moment of truth. The Grand Prize of the jersey. The announcer begins that the raffle will be drawn, but first he says ""There is something a little special about this jersey... It is signed by the 2009 team!"" My stomach jumps to my throat. Holy crap, my extremely nearly sober mind thought. I can win this and be awesome! The vague shape of the announcer then says, ""So here to announce the winner of the SIGNED BLUES JERSEY OF THE WHOLE TEAM IS DAVID BACKES!"" Cheers and shouts and people going nuts! Holy Flipping Balls, it is my favorite player and he is right on the other side of the room. He thanks the support of the Company and money that was raised for the charity. Then he says calmly and as professional as a Silver Medal Olympian. The winner is TriConX!  I was stunned, floored, and sick at the same time. I jump up drunkenly yelling ""Yesss!"" I hear laughs and cheers in the background as I take my walk up to the podium to meet my favorite player and get my new amazing jersey. The rest is a blur and I don't remember much other than David's arm over my shoulder and with one hand holdin the jersey and my opposite hand holding it in front of us with the biggest, drunkest grin on my face I have ever had. He then looks at me and says ""It looks like you had a great time out there today"". I turn to him and reply, ""You bet your ass I did Mr. Backes"". The rest is a blur and my buddy drove me home with the jersey on my lap and repeating over and over ""That was so f'in awesome.""  Sorry for the long rambling. It probably isn't as cool as any of you other diehard fans, but before that day I hadn't won a single raffle in my life  and I won't need to win another."

I had to do a double take a few and told her ""I think that was Brett Hull"" rand back to find the guy at some jewelry store. I walked up to him and said something along the lines of ""I don't want to annoy you just shake your hand"" this was during the Keenan years so 97-ish?   Al MacInnis- Was playing a hockey tournament at the St Louis Ice sports complex- that's what it was called at the time. There were 2 rinks separated by a common area. The Blues were coming off practice when we were getting started at the other rink and they came over and some of them in full gear just got on the ice and scrimmaged with us. I played goalie at the time and spent about 20 minutes trying to convince Al Macinnis to take a slapshot in the breadbasket. He refused...prob cause I was in high school.  Federko/Twister- Some roller hockey tournament at Wash U in high school. Bernie and Twister were taking slappers at the slapshot speed test thing and hanging out with the tournament kids. They are both crazy nice guys.  Ty Conklin/Jaro Halak- My wife got me a goalie meet and greet with Conks and Halak after some Detroit game. I got them to sign a Goalie stick in the Bud Light zone. That goalie stick has about 10 goalie signatures at this point.  Ken Hitchcock- Playing hockey at the rink in Brentwood. His wife plays hockey with us regularly. I was in net and took me a while but Hitch was right behind me watching us play. He hung out for about an hour after and just talked hockey with everyone."

It was me, my older brother and my younger brother against pronger and our youngest brother. They demolished us... At one point he was standing on my older brothers chest and palmed my head and my brothers head and lifted us both up to let my baby bro score.

You have even more complications when you factor in teams that take the bus or train on shorter trips (like within the metro-division), to teams that have to fly to their next destination (majority of Pacific division teams, outside the LA/SJ/ANA swing).  MLB does it the same way the NHL/NFL/NBA does it where you play the majority of your games within the division, less games within the conference, and lesser games outside the conference.   NHL might already do this, but the best way to off-set travel costs for teams is to just pool and split the difference between all 30 teams instead of having one team pay for 50k miles of travel compared to 33k of the least traveled team, have the expenses pooled and split amongst the teams as a ""travel tax"" or ""travel incentive"" depending on the over/under of costs."

Schwartz has that hustle and awareness that Oshie used to have. He hasn't been spoiled or demotivated yet, so hopefully he should continue to get better and better."
stlouisblues,3de93r,dusthimself,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:37:35 2015 UTC,I believe Backes could be better than Kesler without the C. Could be determinant of value if we tried to trade him.

stlouisblues,3de93r,ryanb6321,3,Wed Jul 15 17:51:10 2015 UTC,Bit of an overpayment in my mind.
stlouisblues,3de93r,MacerV,2,Wed Jul 15 16:33:09 2015 UTC,I think it is time to start fielding offers for David Backes.
stlouisblues,3de93r,bleedblue002,2,Thu Jul 16 02:14:02 2015 UTC,The biggest advantage Kesler has had over Backes is that Kesler has always had another great C on his team and was used appropriately. Backes has never had such luxury.
stlouisblues,3de93r,Qwadruple,2,Thu Jul 16 13:30:12 2015 UTC,Stastny?
stlouisblues,3de93r,danglebot,2,Sat Jul 18 00:53:59 2015 UTC,I saw this title and got excited that maybe we had traded for Kesler.  The letdown when I clicked...
stlouisblues,3de93r,c-9,3,Wed Jul 15 18:06:07 2015 UTC,"Funny, my reaction was ""oh man I hope they didn't sign kesler!""  Not that he is a bad player, but we've got that type of player all over the lineup."
stlouisblues,3de93r,ElliotAsbed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:42:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's an overpayment for sure. For the first couple years of the extension it'll seem like an alright deal, but as he ages it's gonna turn fast. He's a really physical player and his style doesn't exactly produce guys that put up points well into their late 30's and 40's. Takes a toll on your body to play that way."
stlouisblues,3de93r,sixsixeightsix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:04:20 2015 UTC,Kesler - .59 points per game/career Backes - .64 points per game/career    The market will allow Backes to make just as much as Kesler just did.  Bai Backes.

stlouisblues,3da8ko,psychedellosaurus,2,Wed Jul 15 18:02:52 2015 UTC,"Shattenkirk was our only defenseman last year who had even an above average shot from the point. Pietrangelo is average at best (when he even hits the net). Gunnarsson and Bouwmeester are below average. However, we have plenty of guys ready to push for a spot in the NHL who have rockets from the point. Edmunson and Parayko have absolute cannons. Lindbohm's has an average shot, but it is effective because he seems to find a way to put it on net more times than not."
stlouisblues,3da8ko,bleedblue002,2,Tue Jul 14 18:55:04 2015 UTC,"If Petro was just a bit more accurate, I think he would have an above average shot. It is a bit odd that we have several forwards with better point shots than any of our defenseman. I'd say Steen has the best point shot on the team."
stlouisblues,3da8ko,gruesome2some,2,Tue Jul 14 20:57:15 2015 UTC,With Brouwer in the mix and a potential shift of Backes back to the wing (I'll believe that when I see it) We'll see some bigger guys around the net.  I'd like to see MPI or Fabbri take Otts spot in the lineup with Ott sticking around as a 13th or 14th forward.
stlouisblues,3da8ko,Robby712,8,Tue Jul 14 18:48:54 2015 UTC,"Fabbri will never play on the 4th line, period. It's just not what that line is for. MPS is pretty much the same story. I could see him being an energy guy like Porter was, but Porter was/is much better along the boards than Paajarvi is, and was much more physical to boot. Ott is in the lineup on opening day unless something catastrophic happens, in which case it's time for us to ""unleash the Beach."""
stlouisblues,3da8ko,simiotic24,2,Tue Jul 14 20:48:56 2015 UTC,"I never said move him to the 4th line, I just want him bumped from the lineup.  The other guys have more to offer.  I know Bergy has his haters, but he's a solid possession guy.  He could do Ott's job minus the stupid penalties/half-hearted fights.    Bergs is a highly paid 4th liner and Fabbri on the 3rd line."
stlouisblues,3da8ko,Robby712,4,Tue Jul 14 21:05:23 2015 UTC,"I disagree about Bergie, but it's a fair point/matter of opinion. Sorry if that original post came off as aggressively-worded; just typing fast! I hope Fabbri is ready for the big time, I guess we'll see at big-boy camp"
stlouisblues,3da8ko,simiotic24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:47:09 2015 UTC,"No worries.  I've also heard a few folks mention they'd like to see what Fabbri has to offer at camp and then move Bergs before the season starts...but I doubt that happens (A preseason trade)  Bottom line is, I think we all want to see Fabbri on this team next season..."
stlouisblues,3da8ko,Robby712,5,Tue Jul 14 21:51:09 2015 UTC,"It is almost impossible to get value for a roster player during the preseason because every team wants as many open roster spots as they can get to look at prospects.  If Bergie is moved to make room for Fabbri, it will be after the 9 game tryout."
stlouisblues,3da8ko,Downvote_Comforter,0,Tue Jul 14 22:51:20 2015 UTC,"If Fabbri makes it, Ott will be bumped out as the extra forward or he'll swap in with Brodziak and Reaves.  1 of those 3 will have to sit every game.  This also means that someone like Jaskin or Brouwer will have to play on the 4th line, which is unfortunate.  I'd probably just go with Brouwer since he'd probably get a lot of PK time.  And Berglund is a great 3rd liner, good 2nd liner on some teams.    I'm actually really curious to see how Berglund reacts to his best friend Oshie getting traded away."
stlouisblues,3da8ko,westc2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:01:18 2015 UTC,"While I agree we need more shots on net, I also recognize that sometimes we funnel the puck toward the net and make it look like a shot. This helps keep possession and tires out the opponent's D.   If anything we need less shots right at the goalies' center mass.    DISCLAIMER: Please don't look to the Wild series for examples of successfully funneling the puck."
stlouisblues,3da8ko,thefootisconstant,0,Thu Jul 16 12:09:52 2015 UTC,I agree completely. Petro and Berglund were several sources of feelings of despair and anger last season when they touched the puck.
stlouisblues,3da8ko,beepbeepimajeep05,7,Tue Jul 14 19:37:09 2015 UTC,"Pietrangelo?  No, he was our best/secnd best defenseman."
stlouisblues,3da8ko,alexfig88,8,Tue Jul 14 22:01:56 2015 UTC,He was our best 5v5 defenseman by far. Both offensively and defensively. He outscored Shattenkirk 5v5.
stlouisblues,3da8ko,bleedblue002,4,Tue Jul 14 22:05:50 2015 UTC,and (by his standards) he had a mediocre year
stlouisblues,3da8ko,Philbob99,7,Tue Jul 14 22:12:45 2015 UTC,"He was our best overall player from when the calendar turned to March through the playoffs, IMO. Tarasenko included. He controlled the flow of the game. He scored 16 points in his final 24 games, which is on pace for 55 points over 82 games. This all coincided with him changing the angle on his stick blade. I am expecting a huge season from him."
stlouisblues,3da8ko,bleedblue002,4,Tue Jul 14 22:17:30 2015 UTC,"Shooting wise, he was horrid. He couldn't hit the broad side of a barn."
stlouisblues,3da8ko,beepbeepimajeep05,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:33:07 2015 UTC,"You aren't wrong, his shot was pretty erratic as much as I love the guy for his D and puck moving wizardry"
stlouisblues,3da8ko,ElliotAsbed,0,Sat Jul 18 06:25:16 2015 UTC,"More point shots?!?  I'd like Less point shots.  It seems like nearly every non-Frank goal was scored as a deflected point shot, or a rebound from one."
stlouisblues,3da8ko,Jimmers1231,2,Wed Jul 15 17:21:57 2015 UTC,This made absolutely no sense. You would like to see less point shots but just said every non-Frank goal was scored as a deflected point shot?
stlouisblues,3da8ko,Jimmers1231,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:36:49 2015 UTC,"Correct.  And when we couldn't get a point shot off, we were lost out there.  It was the primary source of our offense.  When we couldn't get shots through, or our D were aggressively pressured, we often lost our composure and couldn't get the puck to the forwards down low to cycle lower."

Makes for nice math, but it's totally unrealistic.    Also, part of the issue over the long term has been the Blues' relative success...making the playoffs nearly every year (and every year for like 24 seasons in a row) meant they never got the top-end draft picks, unlike some other teams that bottomed out occasionally and then would go on to pick up very high draft picks, who tend to be the superstars of tomorrow."

It seems like that's the biggest factor going into the playoffs, even moreso than the seed, is past season's success.

Of all those years, only TWO did the Blues lose to teams that did not go on to win the cup (or were cup defenders)."

Gives me time to grieve, get angry, 'reboot,' get excited for the new season, and build my hopes up again. If the NHL had a schedule more along the lines of an EPL where you've got just a shade under 3 months between the end and beginning of the season, I'd probably go insane."
