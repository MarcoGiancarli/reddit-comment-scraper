Broadway,3e0hrg,itsiggyiggs,-6,Tue Jul 21 12:43:30 2015 UTC,In New York city?  Disappointing.  Move it to the middle of the country so A) It's more affordable B) More people can attend.  NYC already has Broadway.  From 10:00 to 10:30pm is like a mini-con almost every night of the week as the theaters let out.
Broadway,3e0hrg,jeremyosborne81,5,Tue Jul 21 14:19:13 2015 UTC,"Umm - there's a reason it's in NY. Who do we want to see at Broadwaycon....let's think about this for a moment...oh, right, people who live and work in NYC!  If they moved the con to Wichita, how many Broadway stars do you think would show up?   That said, I got my tickets last round and can't wait."
Broadway,3e0hrg,teacherdrama,-3,Tue Jul 21 14:36:06 2015 UTC,That's just NYC elitism.  Are they doing it for fans or just a cash grab from people who are already there?  I think we know the answer.  There are CONs all over the country for various industries and celebrities come from all over the world for their fans.
Broadway,3e0hrg,jeremyosborne81,2,Tue Jul 21 15:07:01 2015 UTC,"You sound bitter. Again, they're bringing people to the con who are theater people. They live and work in NYC. ALL of them live and work in NYC. Why would they put the con ANYWHERE else. It's a BROADWAYcon. Locating it where people can go see shows kind of seems like a no-brainer. If you don't like it, live closer to NYC.   Comic books can be bought anywhere. Movies can be seen all over the world. Televisions are all in our homes. Broadway is ONLY in NY.   I doubt they thought for more than a second about WHERE this would take place."
Broadway,3e0hrg,teacherdrama,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:15:37 2015 UTC,THEATRE happens everywhere.  There are THEATRE fans everywhere and it's completely ridiculous that in our current day and age the gold standard is isolated in such a tiny space on Earth.
Broadway,3e0hrg,jeremyosborne81,4,Tue Jul 21 15:22:34 2015 UTC,"You've now crossed into absurdist territory. You can go see your shows wherever you live, I'll be heading to Broadway to see the best talent the world of theater has to offer."
Broadway,3e0hrg,teacherdrama,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:28:55 2015 UTC,Here we have an example of the privileged unable to acknowledge how privileged they are.
Broadway,3e0hrg,jeremyosborne81,2,Tue Jul 21 15:33:34 2015 UTC,"How old are you?  Privileged because I know that NYC is where the best talent performs in the theater? Seriously?   Dude, it's not like this is a new development. Broadway has been where the best of the best go (excluding maybe the West End) and it has been for more than a century. I'm not privileged because I can go to NYC - I work hard so that I can afford a home in an adjoining state. I can barely even afford to see shows once or twice a year - don't give me bullshit about me being privileged.   Like I said, if you want to see the best in the world, go to Broadway and see them. No one's stopping you. You sound ridiculous complaining that they won't come to you ""in the middle of the country.""  The founders of Broadwaycon are doing a pretty impressive thing in creating this con in the first place. I'm SURE there are more theater fans in the general area of NYC than anywhere else in the country. It only makes sense for them to have the con there (and, indeed, if it were anywhere else we would all be saying ""why the hell is it THERE?"").   Don't push your whining on me. Am I lucky I have access to Broadway where I live? No - I attribute THAT to my choice to live here and my hard work to make sure I can afford a house in the vicinity. Privilege has nothing to do with that."
Broadway,3e0hrg,teacherdrama,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:42:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, right. I forgot only those who can afford a couple thousand dollar trip to NYC deserve to see Broadway stars."
Broadway,3e0hrg,jeremyosborne81,3,Tue Jul 21 15:47:14 2015 UTC,"Do you want to see them for free?  Seriously?   Look, I agree the price of Broadway tickets is INSANE. It's WAY higher than it should be. Back in the fifties and sixties, Broadway ticket prices were cheaper than movie tickets. Ticket prices have gotten WAY out of control, but that doesn't change the fact that the best talent IS in NYC. That's not going to change anytime soon."
Broadway,3e0hrg,teacherdrama,2,Tue Jul 21 15:58:48 2015 UTC,"Is this theater con? No, It's BROADWAY con they want BROADWAY stars there. It is cheaper for everyone to have the con in NYC. If they had it elsewhere, ticket prices would be thousands of dollars because they would have to pay for all the stars transportation. Have you SEEN the list so far? They can have so many people because those people just need to jump on the subway.  It also gives a chance for shows and stars currently on Broadway (which they have announced already) to be able to attend. Otherwise, they could only get people who aren't in shows right now, which would suck."
Broadway,3e0hrg,bwayc,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:42:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, right. I forgot only those who can afford a couple thousand dollar trip to NYC deserve to see Broadway stars."
Broadway,3e0hrg,jeremyosborne81,3,Tue Jul 21 15:47:11 2015 UTC,"It isn't a couple of thousand dollars! If you think that you just don't know how to internet. You can get a round trip flight from your area for less $200. The hotel is really reasonable and if you don't think it is, you can find another hotel. People who are going found ones for less than $100 a night per person.   Also - NO ONE DESERVES TO SEE BROADWAY STARS. There is no deserving when it comes to this. I am done - you are just a fucking moron."
Broadway,3e0hrg,bwayc,2,Tue Jul 21 16:01:41 2015 UTC,I'm from Canada so it's all just as inconvenient for me. At least I can go see a couple shows after the con this way.
Broadway,3dvwt4,orangeorchid,23,Sun Jul 19 23:45:11 2015 UTC,"The moment a performance is put on film, it becomes a really tricky matter for the unions that represent each party. Directors, writers, and actors all have different unions for their stage work and their screen work.  For example, ""screen actors"" are protected by SAG/AFTRA and screenwriters are protected by WGA, which dictates how much residual pay they receive every time their work appears in a broadcast. ""Stage actors"" belong to AEA and playwrights belong to Dramatist's Guild, and don't get residuals in the same way. So to broadcast a live performance for a paying audience, a production would have to make sure everyone was covered by all relevant professional unions. And for network television, that gets costly and far beyond the budget of most theatrical productions.  But also, the obvious reason: there's a huge difference seeing something live. The show might be the same, but  the experience is vastly different. Live performance endures because people enjoy seeing live performance; something about taping it kills a bit of that magic."
Broadway,3dvwt4,Omgbackflip,3,Mon Jul 20 00:41:34 2015 UTC,"Good info here.  I wonder how they did it for Memphis, whose DVD version (which was on Netflix streaming for a long time) was wonderfully done.  I would love to see more shows do that.  I would even pay for it."
Broadway,3dvwt4,readparse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:34:28 2015 UTC,That's kind of what I suspected.
Broadway,3dvwt4,wish_to_conquer_pain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:11:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering this.  There are performances I've loved a lot that I really wish I could have a copy of, or things I missed that I wished I could have seen, and I've always wondered why they don't just record more shows.  I mean obviously it wouldn't have the same impact as a live show, but it would still be fantastic to see, especially to relive memories of things I've seen live."
Broadway,3dvwt4,nowhereman136,9,Tue Jul 21 03:14:49 2015 UTC,"I wish they did this after they closed, or as a publicity for one last ticket sales boost.   RENT, Company, Into the Woods, Passing Strange, Les Miserable, Shrek, and Billy Elliot have all be released on DVD"
Broadway,3dvwt4,NLaBruiser,7,Mon Jul 20 02:06:50 2015 UTC,"I understand and respect both the fears of ticket sales being damaged AND the numerous Unions involved.  Still a shame that they couldn't record a performance, sit on it, and release it, say, a year after the run closes on DVD so that those of us who can't access New York could enjoy at least a version of the show - even if not live.  I'm in KC, and trips to  NY are rare and usually for work - enough so to keep me from having time to catch a show."
Broadway,3dvwt4,RadicalDreamer89,3,Mon Jul 20 13:22:44 2015 UTC,"Still a shame that they couldn't record a performance, sit on it, and release it, say, a year after the run closes on DVD    Precisely this.  I would pay a ridiculous price for a professionally recorded DVD of Mark Rylance in Jerusalem."
Broadway,3dvwt4,icancook2,3,Mon Jul 20 17:18:46 2015 UTC,That performance still haunts me.

Broadway,3dvwt4,alivesince1985,3,Mon Jul 20 23:59:30 2015 UTC,"As an Australian, I would happily pay to stream theatre. Why don't they just geo-block it so that people in the USA can't watch it if its on Broadway?   By the way I know there's too much red tape, but gee it would be nice."
Broadway,3dvwt4,rocksplash,2,Mon Jul 20 01:52:35 2015 UTC,"Digital Theatre often records West End shows,  which could be a good sub. The Catherine Tate/David Tennant Much Ado is one of the funniest things I've ever seen."
Broadway,3dvwt4,Yoyti,2,Mon Jul 20 15:37:20 2015 UTC,"The stated reason is that they think it'll reduce ticket sales. I think this is pretty much bullshit. And even so, gives no reason not to release films after shows have closed.  That said, some shows do televise. Keep an eye on Live From Lincoln Center and Great Performances on PBS. They've done Light In The Piazza and South Pacific among others, plus concerts from Avery Fischer (including Carousel and Sweeney Todd), and operas from the Met (including this past season The Merry Widow featuring Kelli O'Hara). Of course, most of the time, these are just available online for a limited time, and then are never legally available again.  And some productions do release professional recordings for purchase, including Into The Woods, which was on Netflix for a period of time. Last I checked, Netflix also has the 2006 revival of Company, as well as the 25th anniversary of Phantom, among others.  Yeah, it's pretty annoying, but there are videos out there if you know where to look."
Broadway,3dvwt4,notacrook,8,Mon Jul 20 00:19:24 2015 UTC,"I think this is pretty much bullshit   And I think you pretty much don't know what you're talking about.  Apart from the fear of yes, decreasing ticket sales, theater is created, designed, and made to be a shared experience in the theater.  It looks, sounds, and feels so much more real and transportive when you see it live.    A recorded show will never capture as much grandeur as the live in the flesh performance.  Edit: Fixed an erroneous autocorrect."
Broadway,3dvwt4,Yoyti,14,Mon Jul 20 00:27:45 2015 UTC,"I agree that seeing a show live is so much more than seeing it recorded, which is part of the reason I don't think releasing recordings of shows for purchase should significantly decrease ticket sales. While I'd rather see a show live than on film, I'd rather see it on film than not at all. Quoth Sondheim, ""The tapes are not supposed to be definitive, I replied, they're simply a record of events, and I for one would prefer to see a frozen performance of Laurence Olivier in Oedipus Rex than none at all."""
Broadway,3dvwt4,notacrook,0,Mon Jul 20 00:44:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the vast majority of shows are not Laurence Oliver in Oedipus."
Broadway,3dvwt4,Yoyti,0,Mon Jul 20 16:49:05 2015 UTC,"No, but some of them are Audra McDonald in Porgy And Bess, or Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel in Wicked, or Chita Rivera in The Rink or The Visit. Lots of legendary performances that would be great to see preserved for anyone who couldn't see them live."
Broadway,3dvwt4,notacrook,0,Tue Jul 21 01:09:59 2015 UTC,"Lincoln Center Library shoots most shows, and a vast majority are available to watch at the library in NYC."
Broadway,3dvwt4,Yoyti,0,Tue Jul 21 01:13:37 2015 UTC,I am aware. People in NYC also have access to a lot of live theater. Doesn't help anyone out of the city. What's wrong about releasing them for legal purchase after the shows have closed? Would cut down on people illegally recording shows and selling bootlegs too.
Broadway,3dvwt4,notacrook,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:19:36 2015 UTC,"It's not what theatre is, and it's not what theater should be."
Broadway,3dvwt4,Yoyti,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:22:10 2015 UTC,"No one's arguing that theater isn't better live. But live theater isn't available to everyone. I would jump at the chance to see Sunday In The Park With George live, and I'm sure I would enjoy it a great deal better live than on the thankfully legally available DVD. But am I to be forbidden from experiencing it even in the ten-percent-as-good film form while waiting for a revival to come along? Recording shows does not detract from theater, only makes it available in some small form to people who can't experience it in full."

My husband and I, each spring, fly up on a Tuesday and see three shows, leaving Thursday morning or maybe afternoon. We usually go straight from the plane to the TKTS booth, then quickly by the hotel and barely have time to eat before our show. So usually we are in whatever we traveled in: jeans, a solid t-shirt, and a cardigan and some flats. We pack very lightly, so we don't have room to bring an extra set of clothes just for Tuesday night.  Wednesday we end up dressed a bit more nicely but certainly not in anything goes approaching fancy.  We don't need to be dressed a certain way to behave well and appreciate the experience. I do dress up to see local productions because I have the benefit of my entire closet. I probably end up dressed never to see community theater than Broadway."

I'm not hauling around New York in a skirt all day, and I'm not wasting the precious little time I get in the city each year running all the way back to my hotel to change so that I don't offend some other audience member.

I had no idea it was her first time in the role, she really fit in seamlessly. It was pretty cute seeing her family two rows ahead cheering wildly when they announced her going on and at curtain call the whole cast tackled her with hugs. I did stage door afterward and the old woman next to me asked her how she remembered everything... her answer was a simple ""Muscle memory."" (The whole cast, kids and adults, were very sweet and kind.)   Also it was adorable watching the kid actors hanging around playing ninja freeze tag with one of the ushers while they waited for Michael Ceveris to come out so they could get milkshakes.

Broadway,3c34s3,readparse,3,Sat Jul 4 14:53:59 2015 UTC,I don't know much about it but my best guess was Disney is not really into the idea of doing a Hunchback musical more geared toward adults. Especially with all the frozen hype. I would absolutely love a recording of this show!

I saw it at the Papermill Playhouse and there was nothing but raw talent on that stage.   They're in the process of recording a soundtrack for it - http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Exclusive-THE-HUNCHBACK-OF-NOTRE-DAME-Cast-Album-in-the-Works-20150515  You're also correct, despite the music by Alan Menken and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, Disney did not know how to market it because it was not really a kid's show, but had Disney's name attached to it. Rather than overcoming that obstacle, they just decided to not move it to Broadway."

While she is bummed about not transferring to Bway, she understands the difficulty of moving this show over. Disney would never put their name on this when so many people die. Also, Frozen is their main focus, so with that and Lion King and Aladdin still going strong, they have enough on their plate.  Plus, they had issues trying to handle the onstage choir. That's a huge amount of people that cannot happen on Bway. They were all volunteer for these productions, but that is not allowed on Broadway. No way Disney pays that many contracts.   I'll definitely be picking up the cast recording!"

Broadway,3c3zqc,TheCasalex,2,Sat Jul 4 15:34:55 2015 UTC,"Quick question, is it true that for Broadway auditions if you are not in equity they will not see? Or is it just that you have to wait until everyone from equity is finished?"
Broadway,3c3zqc,tboycey2,2,Sat Jul 4 22:42:52 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain that they won't see you if you are not equity, unfortunately."
Broadway,3c3zqc,AnnAshford,5,Sun Jul 5 02:01:40 2015 UTC,"There's a rumour that they only posted this casting notice to get publicity, and everyone (except maybe Krysta because she's getting treatment in California) is transferring with the production. So, even if you were equity, you'd have to be like Barbra Streisand level talent for them to consider you."
Broadway,3c3zqc,tkookookachoo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:08:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would be surprised if they didn't bring everyone over. I didn't see any real need for recasting except for maybe if they wanted bigger names in any way but with a production like this that's so specific casting wise, that probably won't happen"

Broadway,3bl4u0,At_the_Roundhouse,4,Fri Jul 3 05:08:14 2015 UTC,"Same performance, and I totally agree with everything you said. There's no one who plays the role as sincerely as she does, not that I've ever seen, and she is an original cast member so why not? You could also tell just how much she loves that role, that show, and Howard Ashman (especially during ""Somewhere That's Green [reprise]""). I thought it was a really fun, exciting, beautiful experience."
Broadway,3bl4u0,howaboutwenot,4,Fri Jul 3 15:33:10 2015 UTC,I saw it on Thursday and let me tell you I had no idea she was in her 60s until I read your comment. She looked and sounded fabulous. It was a really fun production.

Get a feel for the genre and then find an artist that has something very similar to that style or feel. I don't know Kinky Boots well enough to help you out I'm afraid, but that is the best advice I can give. If, however, you would only like to be ensemble, get a general feel for the overall musical genre of the show and find a band that embodies that and use a song from them."

Broadway,3agm4p,spoilz,2,Sat Jun 20 23:56:49 2015 UTC,"I mean, they sing a song called, ""Thank Heaven for Little Girls"" (which was sung by the uncle in the movie, not the aunt). Gigi basically gets with a man who is a lot older than her and has seen her grow from a little girl to an ""acceptable age to not be out in society alone"".  It's creepy.

Not that Sara isn't a stellar actress; I just feel like this is the wrong medium for this type of content.

I think it takes a totally different kind of talent to dial down what you've learned on stage (playing to the back of the room) to restrain yourself playing only to a screen audience, up close and personal. She still has the chops to do it live, as there are live clips of her singing this in public (I just thought this one was more apropos).   The musical number itself was a part of a larger ""musical episode"", where the character you see was in a head trauma incident, and the songs going on around her are a mental defect. Just to put it into context."

Tonight (quintet): Tony's part sends shivers down my spine and it shows a lot of confidence, excitement, romance, and overall joy between the couple."

You also should find songs that fit your look and type, if you're going for an audition.  Look for songs that showcase the best ""you"" there is."

Broadway,3a54v7,EmmaWestEnd,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:36:24 2015 UTC,"This is going to be hella detailed, so I'm sorry it's a rather long read. But I hope it really helps you!  For most auditions, you'll need at least one piece from the ""Golden Age"" (pre-1970) and at least one Contemporary piece (1970-Present). Some even separate the Contemporary into two categories (1970-2000 and 2000-Present). First, please check out the various lists online of ""overdone"" audition songs before you proceed. I'm sure everyone behind that table would be pleased to hear something that isn't done to death. Wicked, RENT, Grease, Les Mis, and Andrew Lloyd-Webber's works immediately spring to mind as ""overdone.""   Next, think of how difficult the piece is for an accompanist to play and how easy it would be for you to describe the tempo. Most songs composed by Sondheim, Adam Guettel, and Jason Robert Brown (among others) are very difficult for accompanists to sight-read, which can hinder your overall audition greatly. For something a little easier to play, but not as well-known, you'll need to be able to accurately describe the tempo to your accompanist. I know this isn't direct song advice, but it's something to keep in mind when selecting music!  Now for the fun part: Music! I had a whole list made of tenor audition songs for a friend, but I've misplaced it so I'm trying to replicate this from memory. For Golden Age pieces, you'll want to look into shows like My Fair Lady (""On the Street Where You Live"") and Gypsy (""All I Need is the Girl""), and even the Rodgers and Hammerstein collection (Oklahoma, South Pacific, etc.) There are others, but I'm totally blanking at the moment. (I will possibly add more if they come to mind later)  As far as contemporary music goes, you're very lucky because more modern works are very tenor-heavy. In addition to the ""usual suspects"" (Next to Normal, Grease, RENT, etc), I suggest checking out the following shows/songs:  The Secret Garden (""Lily's Eyes"" or ""Winter's on the Wing"") Parade (""Old Red Hills of Home"" or ""It Don't Make Sense"" - this is a JRB show but I believe these pieces may not have overly difficult accompaniment) Kinky Boots (any of Charlie's songs) Carrie (""Dreamer In Disguise"") 35MM (""Cut You a Piece"") Unauthorized Autobiography of Samantha Brown (""Run Away With Me"") A Year With Frog and Toad (""I'm Coming Out of My Shell"")   If you're looking for something by new and emerging composers, NewMusicalTheatre.com has an awesome search tool that you can use to narrow down by voice type, song type (ballad/uptempo/etc), and other categories for the songs on their site. These songs aren't always as well-known to those behind the table, but, in my experience, they're pretty interested in hearing something new. Plus, a lot of these newer works have that high pop tenor range you're looking for. (NMT sells music by Pasek and Paul, Drew Gasparini, Ryan Scott Oliver, and others.)"

There are hundreds of thousands of musical theatre songs. Help us out.   Otherwise the only advice I can give you is that if you're a white girl, don't bring in ""Your Daddy's Son"" from Ragtime. Last year four different white girls at the program I teach at brought that in. They were all from the South. We had a good chuckle about it in the teacher's lounge."

It sounds like you already know Next To Normal - why not just do a cut from that? If you do Superboy and the Invisible Girl, I recommend doing a cut starting from the second verse and ending at ""I'd fly far away from here"". ""Everything Else"" probably has several good 16 bar cuts as well. If you're okay with being typed, you might also want to look at ""Breathe"" from In the Heights or other similarly ethnic (I hate that term, but that's the industry for you) roles.   Steer clear of Les Mis, Phantom, the other Euromusicals. They're done to death, as is Rent (and Hairspray).   If you've got a belt, take a look at ""Now You Know"" from Merrily We Roll Along. It's a fantastic alto belt number that very few people use. Finding a good 16 bar cut from that can be tricky - I recommend the final A (""because now you grow"") to the end. Also look at the final A from ""You've Got Possibilities"" (It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's Superman) if you can belt up to a C or C# (I don't remember how high it goes), ""Ordinary Kind of Woman"" from Pippin, and another song whose name escapes me. Whatever. I'll remember it. Or I won't.   These are a crapshoot because I don't know anything about you or your voice or material. But. They should at least help you triangulate something. Really, these songs are just to hear you make sound come out of your face, so just don't pick something that doesn't have anything to do with you or your voice and you'll be fine.   Also, heads-up: These programs can be very stressful for people recovering from eating disorders. You'll be taking dance classes and performance classes with people of all sorts of body types, and depending on the program you might hear some things. Make sure you have a support system in place. Plenty of these intensive programs are incredibly positive and supportive, but there are one or two that are not (and even in the nice ones, comments slip) so take care of yourself. And have a good time!  And BE MORE SPECIFIC WITH YOUR QUESTIONS, especially once you're in NYC. We don't like having our time wasted here. Except for me. I'm begging to have my time wasted so I don't have to start prepping for my goddamn summer program."

I've heard pianists balk when handed the sheet music. I've heard lectures from music directors about how ""if the pianist plays it wrong, he ruins your audition, and if he plays it right he upstages you"". I've played classes where teachers said ""I'm sure you were just fine, but that song is so hateful towards women that I just can't pay attention when people sing it"" after a few bars. DON'T DO IT.

If you have to choose one, though, I also vote for The King and I. Not only are Kelli O'Hara and Ruthie Ann Miles's performances worth the price of admission alone, but the whole production itself is an absolute stunner.

I want to go back tonight and see it again. I'm so happy that I saw it with Darren Criss; I thought he was absolutely perfect for the role! I've been listening to the soundtrack, but I don't think Neil Patrick Harris has the same rockstar quality that Criss has.   Thanks again for the rec!!"

Broadway,39lj9f,thesweetestpunch,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:30:32 2015 UTC,Depends what you consider off the beaten path. I vote Fun Home or King and I - those productions are of the scope and quality you can't get anywhere else.
Broadway,39lj9f,6dayna6,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:12:09 2015 UTC,"Like everyone says, Fun Home is great and I would highly recommend it. If I were you I'd go see a show with dinner at the Westchester cafe if you live nearby. West Side Story plays off broadway there and I hear the tickets are reasonably priced with good quality. Sucks that you are going to leave New York though, sounds like fun going to see different shows all the time."

From there you kind of feel like you're looking down on the show, but after a few minutes it's normal. I still loved the show! You could see everything and can actually really see all the dancing from up high.  I'd recommend calling the box office. Sometimes these tickets are ""partial view"" and you actually can't see everything. But otherwise they always can see well. It's designed that way!"

Broadway,39gbw8,toronto34,4,Thu Jun 11 15:11:41 2015 UTC,I love the article.  I love that this has made news other than all of the Broadway forums and media that I follow.  I saw a feminist group post an article about Jeanine Tesori and Lisa Kron that has NEVER posted one thing that has been related to theatre.  The outpouring of dedication from fans from the compassion of the actual people involved in making this musical happen has been SO fricken beautiful to watch.
Broadway,39gbw8,broadwaylove,3,Thu Jun 11 23:34:04 2015 UTC,"I love this show and this article. I wholeheartedly agree that the tony win gives it life in smaller theaters, where it otherwise would've been a hard sell. Something Rotten will become the next Spamalot.

Broadway,39bend,JLMandell,3,Wed Jun 10 16:51:30 2015 UTC,I am so excited for this season! I saw Hamitlon at the Public and have never been more floored by a piece of theater. Really the best show I have EVER seen. I am so excited for it to finally be hitting Broadway this summer and for a lot more audiences to be introduced to it.  I'm also really excited for Allegiance and Therese Raquin! The story behind Allegiance sounds so interesting and it could really make for a beautiful show. And I've been a Keira Knightley fan for as long as I can remember and I want to see how she does on the stage.
Broadway,39abwi,dropsomeknowledge,37,Wed Jun 10 11:42:00 2015 UTC,"Eh I really love it and most people (people who like musicials anyway) know do, though there are a few who don't. ""Broadway"" isn't really a genre, there's different kinds of musicals just like there are movies, it's not like Phantom of the Opera and Le Mis are meant to have anything in common other than that there's music. One is a sad story of unrequited love and the other is a much more action packed drama.  You wouldn't wonder why you liked Saving Private Ryan and not Casablanca, they're not the same type of movie at all, and yet both are popular."

It was the longest running show on  Broadway before Phantom,  and yet I've hardly met anyone who likes it. I like it for sentimental reasons but even I think it's pretty boring, but I guess enough people liked it to keep the seats full for over 10 years."
Broadway,39abwi,sanmateomary,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:22:41 2015 UTC,"I also have sentimental attachment to it (my daughter played a kitten in a local production -- her first show ever), and I wonder how I'd feel if I didn't have that attachment.

I didn't follow much of the story then, but the music got me and I found the whole show memorizing (even though I had no idea what was going on). Fast forward 15 years later, I frequently watch the 25th anniversary show on Netflix and I saw it again recently when it came to my city. Even though I found the touring show sub-par compared to the 25th anniversary show, I still thought it was great because of the music. There is just something about the melodies of Angel of Music, Music of the Night, and All I Ask of You."
Broadway,39abwi,Ihaveanotheridentity,5,Wed Jun 10 21:11:19 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved Phantom when I saw it on Broadway during its heyday. That being said, it's completely forgettable.

I would never see it again though."

Broadway,39abwi,thesweetestpunch,8,Wed Jun 10 16:07:58 2015 UTC,"A common theme with the mega-musicals of the 80s is that they were written for a particular time and market and have not aged well. They've also generally seem poor upkeep. Of them, Phantom is the only one left in its original production. Most of them were actually never very good to begin with, but opened during a decade that saw so few new musicals that it was very easy to stand out with a piece of well-manufactured schlock. Because of the tourist audience taking over, hits had to appeal to an international audience, where broad-strokes drama prevails (this is what's happened to the movie industry btw - any big budget piece has to play in China, which means the disappearance of specific and culture-specific humor in large-scale pieces).  Why is it still open? Well, let's say you don't see a lot of musicals. You don't know about theatre. You don't even know what the Tonys are. All you know is that Phantom and Wicked and Lion King are famous. You don't want a kid's show and you want something romantic ad suspenseful. So you choose Phantom because you're only seeing one show and aren't interested in doing any research or taking any chances. It's also the only musical you've ever seen on a professional level, so literally anything will be exciting to you.   Phantom (generally) counts on international prestige and people with low standards and no prior theatre going experience for its market.   Are there exceptions? Sure. Lots of teenagers just discovering theatre dig Phantom, and I don't begrudge them that -whatever gets you in the door. I'm sure lot of old people go to remember the original thrill of that chandelier drop (which is, btw, the lamest special effect I've ever seen on a stage).   But for the most part, Phantom sucks. Most of the people in the industry know it, most theatre fans know it, and the producers count on tourists, particularly the ones who don't speak English, not knowing it."

Broadway,39abwi,labchipmunk,3,Thu Jun 11 00:21:12 2015 UTC,"Different people like different things.  Webber is certainly not for everyone.  Webber I think wrote for a very specific time period in theater so by today's standards he is the standard,  while before he was breaking the standard. Also I fell in love with Phantom after I had read the novel. I also fell in love with Cats, but again that was after I read the poems. The musical brought new dimension to something I already loved. I think at this point for a lot of people Phantom go in with expectations, because its Phantom, and then are surprised when it doesn't quite hit those expectations, and so they decided they didn't like it."

I was actually upset after I saw the stage version - I wanted to love it, I thought as a Broadway lover I should have loved it, but I was completely underwhelmed.  I understand the importance of Phantom in the theater community and what the show did for Broadway, but it is not a show I would highly recommend to anyone if they were going to see a show."

At least Phantom of the Opera has beautiful costumes and sets, and harmonically interesting music (I'm a music major).

Broadway,39abwi,marley2012,2,Thu Jun 11 07:07:55 2015 UTC,"I loved Phantom, but I can see how people wouldn't. I absolutely love Les Mis as well, but I loved Les Mis for much longer, and love it more. I like the effects, story and music, but really most of it is personal preference. It also kind of depends on what actors you get, as they may inhabit the characters better. The ""big three"" musicals are Phantom, Les Mis, and Wicked, but they're all very very different. I'd say Phantom is more ""classical"" music and romance, while Les Mis is more drama/action, and Wicked is more fun than the first two. ""Broadway"" doesn't really translate into one type of musical. For example, there is a difference between musicals that have names like ""Music of The Night"" and ""Spooky Mormon Hell Dream"" just as an example."

I only appreciate Phantom for what it did for theatre, other than that I also find the story to be a bore after seeing it several times.

Broadway,39abwi,Yoyti,2,Thu Jun 11 00:24:31 2015 UTC,"Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables do have some things in common:   They were both produced by Cameron Mackintosh They were both based on classic French novels, which were written within 50 years of one another. They are both ""sung-through"" musicals, which means they have almost no spoken dialog.  Music from start to finish. They won consecutive Tony awards for Best Musical (1987 and 1988) They were both smash hits, and were both on the list of the 10 top-grossing musicals of all time (Phantom is 2 and Les Miserables is 8) They are both tragedies (one more tragic than the other)   Having said that, they have some important differences.   Les Miserables is very stirring and uplifting, despite its tragic ending (spoiler, sorry).  Phantom has beautiful musical moments, but it's more stuffy (because it's about an opera company). For the same reason, the singing in Phantom is often more operatic.  Much less of the typical ""broadway"" type singing.  Les Miserables has more of that. The production design and lighting of Phantom is very dark.  Les Miserables is pretty dark also, but less so. Les Miserables is much more of an ensemble piece.  Phantom is really all about two characters.   I say all this to say:  I love Phantom, I do.  Part of it has to do with the circumstances under which I was introduced to the music.  I was in a drum and bugle corps in 1988, and one of the corps we competed with played music from Phantom and it was lovely, and performed very well.  When I heard the album, I just thought it was wonderful.   But I never saw the show, until my son appeared in a very well done high school production of it.  I always knew that it ends up being a sad story about a sad phantom (Is he a phantom?  Is he a man?), and my son's school's performance captured that aspect of it very well.  So I don't know (or care) exactly why I like it.  I just do."
Broadway,39abwi,readparse,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:44:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed pretty much one-hundred percent, but not that the singing in Phantom is more operatic. Christine is pretty much universally sung classically (and Carlotta, for obvious reasons), but beyond that I've heard most of the roles go both ways in both musicals. Cosette is usually sung classically, Eponine is usually not. Valjean, Marius, Enjolras, Fantine, and Javert I've heard go both ways. The 10th anniversary concert recording tends more toward classical with Javert and Fantine, but the 25th anniversary has a more classical Valjean. Similar thing with Phantom. Sometmes Phantom and Raoul are sung classically, sometimes they're Broadway belted. It's down to the interpretations of the singers and the casting directors and the rest of the production. It's just that Christine has one operatic cadenza in Act I of Phantom."

The show can be significantly worse than it was at opening and still be as successful as it is based on name recognition alone.   If you're coming from China and you've heard that you HAVE to see a Broadway show and you've seen the Phantom mask before, you're gonna choose that one. And, like most international tourists, you'll have no similar product of better quality to compare it to.   You'll be like the tourists that keep the shitty Times Square restaurants open. They've probably seen more action than Phantom and they suck, too."
Broadway,39abwi,DarthSunshine,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:52:31 2015 UTC,It's one of my favorites that I've seen.
Broadway,39abwi,thuk6,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:14:07 2015 UTC,"I love it, partly because it's the only musical production that I've seen,so far.  At least Les Mis is coming to Asia next year..."
Broadway,39abwi,ScoochMagooch,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:56:10 2015 UTC,I love it because I played the title role at my school this year and Ramin is my favorite singer
Broadway,39abwi,tkookookachoo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:35:44 2015 UTC,"It's hit and miss for me. My parents adore it but I've always been iffy on it. Some songs I find breathtaking and others are eye rollers. The story is great though. I've mostly only had a problem with some of the music, never was a huge Webber fan."
Broadway,39abwi,jcaternolo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:19:07 2015 UTC,"This is a question that is actually quite complex. Phantom, because it has not cleaned house production wise since it first opened, is still and always has been a show from the 1980's. Because of this, the show is EXTREMELY tired (go see it in New York, you'll see what I mean). When I saw it, no one was truly in it. Very lazy performances, and the audience was mainly a lot of sneezing Asian tourists. This is why I'm excited to see the new tour, as it just arrived in LA, where I live. This new/fresh cast and relatively different production, plus the excitement of performing in a major city, should allow for better performances. Anyways, back to the original question, yes people do like it because the music soars (pun intended) and what other musical drops a chandelier over the audience?"
Broadway,39auwr,toronto34,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:29:59 2015 UTC,"I was surprised to hear it and then terrified at the outcome.  I really wanted NPH to say ""Miss me yet"" when he came out to present..."
Broadway,3999sg,toronto34,2,Wed Jun 10 04:27:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's a totally baffling choice by CBS. Book and score are critically important categories, arguably the most important of all. Not to disparage the other categories, but you can replace the cast, director, costume design, light design and scenic design and the show itself would remain. But if book or music is replaced, it becomes something else. The writing is the show."
Broadway,395z29,eilonwymagic,3,Tue Jun 9 14:27:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not a dance guy, so personally, I wasn't a huge fan. I'm into the musicals more for the singing and the story, both of which didn't blow me away here. At the same time, I can recognize that the choreography was an act of beauty. It's just not my cup of tea."
Broadway,395z29,BU_Rob13,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:16:15 2015 UTC,Yes it was much more of a ballet which I personally LOVED!
Broadway,395z29,marley2012,2,Thu Jun 11 14:02:05 2015 UTC,seeing it in August! Can't wait! Especially since one of the theatres in my area is a producer.
Broadway,395z29,Homo-Erect,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:46:50 2015 UTC,I loved it!  The choreography of the changing sets was so fascinating.
Broadway,395z29,PartManPartOwl,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:00:40 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen it yet - but am very excited to see it the next time I'm in NYC!  As a ballet nerd I'd recommend checking out the DVDs of Wheeldon's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and The Winter's Tale. Both have much the same creative team as AAiP (Wheeldon, Bob Crowley, Natasha Katz etc) and are brilliant! Whilst they're pure ballets, they also have a big dose of theatricality. Plus, you might be able to spot Leanne Cope in the corps (its been a while since I saw the DVD but I think she plays one of Alice's friends)."
Broadway,397dka,sabina_darling,17,Tue Jun 9 20:02:34 2015 UTC,"It's interesting that you don't think Kelli should've won because it was her time, but that you wanted Chita to win because it's her last show."
Broadway,397dka,notacrook,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:12:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't want her to win, I wanted Beth to win, but I figured that this being her, more than likely, last Broadway show, that more votes would go her way."
Broadway,397dka,scrambledbrain,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:11:17 2015 UTC,"Most likely, Chita DID get a share of nostalgia votes. They just weren't enough."
Broadway,397dka,sahdu,11,Wed Jun 10 06:04:54 2015 UTC,"I saw each of the performances for this category and IMO Kelli O'Hara's win was deserved. She was really great.   That being said, the category that I was most disappointed in was featured actress in a musical. Sydney Lucas was unbelievable and I'm shocked she didn't win. Especially given that I felt Miles performance was mediocre at best. I'm wondering if the Fun Home women split the votes. Oh well!"
Broadway,397dka,broadwaylove,3,Tue Jun 9 21:55:16 2015 UTC,"Supporting Actress: I completely agree. All three women do an AMAZING job, and probably split the votes. I was almost positive that Sydney would win.   And Kelli was really great, an amazing performance even by her standards, I just question was it really the best?"
Broadway,397dka,jabberwocky_,3,Tue Jun 9 23:13:43 2015 UTC,"I totally agree on that!  I was also 100% expecting Lucas' name!  But from all of the forums, I've heard that Ruthie has been ridiculously exception in TKAI."
Broadway,397dka,broadwaylove,2,Wed Jun 10 06:50:14 2015 UTC,"I thought Ruthie Ann Miles performance was stellar, polished, and perfect. Fitting in tune to the rest of the production. The role itself, I believe, isn't as strong as Kuhn and Lucas's respective roles in Fun Home. However, I think she did the best with her material and outshone the Fun Home actresses (who probably did split the vote a bit). I was rooting for Lucas for her speak, enthusiasm, and performance. Choosing ""Ring of Keys"" was a smart choice for the show and Lucas. Her career is certainly going to take off after her contract ends with Fun Home due to her number and talent."
Broadway,397dka,broadwaylove,5,Thu Jun 11 15:07:09 2015 UTC,"I lost you when you said you counted out Kristin.  Regarding last year… I saw Sutton, Kelli, AND Jessie and I thought Jessie deserved every inch of that Tony.  Kelli would have been my second choice, because Bridges remains one of my favorite shows to this day and she was fricken brilliant in it, but Jessie was ridiculously on point on stage.  Suttons performance didn't do anything for me, in fact Joshua Henry stole the show for me during Violet."
Broadway,397dka,oddlyaware,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:06:14 2015 UTC,"I should confess that I am a HUGE Sutton stan, so that influenced my opinion on last years. As for counting Kristin out, that was partly because I didn't like the role she played. It didn't have enough substance for me, compared to the others in the category."
Broadway,397dka,FunnyDyke,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:15:47 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see where you are coming from (though still disagree).  Ugh these awards give me heartburn.

Broadway,397dka,manat23ee,2,Thu Jun 11 17:57:45 2015 UTC,"I think Jessie Mueller deserved to win last year. I absolutely loved her performance. And although Kelli probably had her strongest performance that year, I'm glad Jessie won and in my eyes the right person received the tony.   As for this year, everyone I know said it was between Kelli and Kristin. Very few thought it would go to Chita or anyone else. They can give Chita an honorary one, but it would've been ridiculous to just give her a Tony bc it's her last show. I'm glad Kelli won. I'll be seeing both her and Kristin's show this month. In a way it's best Kelli won, we can stop talking about ""When is she going to get her tony?"" And just enjoy all the performances now without that hanging over the Tonys' heads."
Broadway,397dka,ScottVGun,2,Tue Jun 9 20:18:40 2015 UTC,"I was really happy to see Kelli win. 6th times the charm, right? But I do wish that Beth Malone was given a better chance. Fun Home is an extraordinarily unique piece of theater and she's  tremendous talent."

Broadway,395zmb,NLaBruiser,2,Tue Jun 9 14:31:28 2015 UTC,"You guys are very likable. And as I skipped around the video you have great insight into what you're talking about.  Some thoughts: You speak a lot more loudly than your sister. By speaking into one mic you're either going to have trouble hearing her sometimes (like in this video) or you're going to be too loud comparatively (if you boost the volume to get her audio up). Maybe lavaliers, or headsets with individual mics and volume? Just a thought. Also, 20:00 is just too long for me to watch, so I'd split it into bottom 5 and top 5 if you're going to do top 10s in the future.  Still, that's nitpicky. You're off to a good start!"
Broadway,395zmb,tr0pix,2,Tue Jun 9 18:48:35 2015 UTC,"First off, I love the passion you two have and I love that it's a brother-sister duo - make it's unique-ish!  Just a few quick pointers from a production standpoint to give the videos the best chance at viewership...   Pacing, pacing, pacing! - I like the little things you are putting in (""musical theatre at its best..."", random pictures, writing your lists, etc.) but make sure you speed it up. They had a tendency to go a little too long causing me to lose a little focus. If the pictures aren't completely necessary...don't use them! All they will do is create little hiccups in the pace. Don't give the audience to chance to even think it's taking too long! Framing - Make sure that you are both in the frame of the video! Your sister was not fully in the frame most of the time. We wan't to see her, too! :) Length - Try getting your video below 10 mins! I know that's tough with what you were doing (a top 10 list) but find what you absolutely need to say and then only say that. Some banter is good though...especially being brother and sister. Make us want more...not less! I know you all said it won't be as long next time! Also, yes...sing next time!!! :) Music - Maybe have music going the whole time?! Music adds a layer to videos that keeps the audience engaged as long as it isn't distracting. Find an instrumental track from a song that is relevant to the particular video and put it in the background! See what you think.   All in all, cool! You all are passionate and motivated about musical theatre and I will always encourage that! Can't wait to see your next video!  If you all have any questions, feel free to PM me!"

Like /u/DorakoDo said in the Tonys discussion thread:   Yeah, I just feel like broadway 'insulted' itself a bit for not giving SR a single award for the actual show (Christian Borle deserved his, I'm just saying that it should have won something like book, score, or hell, even costumes). SR just seems to be exactly what broadway is at its core, and I think people realized that when they saw 'A Musical' live.

Broadway,38yufe,WWHarleyRider,2,Mon Jun 8 22:11:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just feel like broadway 'insulted' itself a bit for not giving SR a single award for the actual show (Christian Borle deserved his, I'm just saying that it should have won something like book, score, or hell, even costumes). SR just seems to be exactly what broadway is at its core, and I think people realized that when they saw 'A Musical' live. Furthermore, as an Alabama native, I just dont think a tour of Fun Home is going to do well in the South. I'm fine with it's subject matter, but trust me, I'm the minority. When The Book of Mormon came to Birmingham, the only reason it did so well was because A) Even all the Baptists and Catholics down here are fine with making fun of Mormons, and B) Most people that came had season passes and didnt research it beforehand, and it's the first time that's mattered, because nothing had been done like Book of Mormon before. With Fun Home, people arent going to make that mistake twice. Also, it'd be like if Elder McKinley was the main character. McKinley was fine with the South because sure, he was gay, but he wasnt the MAIN character. I just doubt that Fun Home will sell very well anywhere south of Indiana due to its main subject."
Broadway,38yufe,rifrif,6,Mon Jun 8 19:22:42 2015 UTC,"When people talk about stereotypical Broadway, generally they mean something like Anything Goes. Very glitzy, conventional overture, superfluous chorus, tap number somewhere in there somewhere, absurd Gilbertian characters, and a happy ending. But the Hammerstein revolution brought about a very different kind of musical, and Broadway hasn't had a single ""core"" since Carousel. There are shows of all sorts going around, several of them briefly touched upon in Something Rotten's A Musical, but a show itself can only be so many, and one song with a lot of shoutouts does not a show make.  A show like Gentleman's Guide, or Honeymoon In Vegas, or Book Of Mormon, fits the bill of the Broadway stereotype pretty well, and still manages to feel fresh and modern. This is very good for them. (Overtures have gone a little out of fashion.) Something Rotten, however, better fits Sondheim's description as a meta-musical, ""which makes fun of its betters by imitating their cliches while drawing attention to what it's doing, justifying its lack of originality without risk of criticism."" Something Rotten feels like a parody.  Something Rotten has some incredibly clever moments, intricate lyrics, and so forth. The music is mostly unremarkable. This does not mean bad, but the music is not at all the selling point of the show. Sets and costumes are what they are, Christian Borle's vehement praise of his pants notwithstanding.  Whether or not Fun Home will tour well is irrelevant. It's a question of what's actually the better show. Musically and lyrically, Fun Home is rather uneven. One song I'll absolutely love, the next will just be a drag. But it is a highly unique show, like nothing seen on Broadway before, and it seeks, not to be a flashy ""look at how much I love musicals"" hit, but to create characters and tell a story through the medium of theater. And that's what Broadway is about. Not about the overtures, and choruses, and tap numbers, and all that jazz, but about telling stories through the medium of theater.  But if you really need a love letter to musicals, I must draw attention to Curtains. Of course I think Kander and Ebb were snubbed this season (I expected The Visit if nothing else to get score), so maybe I'm leaning on them, but Curtains is a show that celebrates the feel of pre-Hammerstein Broadway without ever mocking it, and at the same time, telling its own unique story in its own unique way. Curtains was nominated for eight Tonys in 2007. It won one, for David Hyde Pierce in the lead. Like Something Rotten, it lost most of its nominations to a new and unique show, unlike anything else seen before on Broadway. Spring Awakening"
Broadway,38yufe,Yoyti,2,Tue Jun 9 02:22:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think that 'unremarkable' is a very fair word to place on Something Rotten's music, or the score of any musical for that matter. One could say that music from what people consider some of the best musicals is 'unremarkable.' Spring Awakening: 'It's all 4/4 sorta rock-folk music.' H2$: 'It's all upbeat jazz with a bit of a latin undertone.' American Idiot: 'It's just Green Day.' Sweeney Todd: 'It's exactly what Sondheim usually does.' Those all seem sorta generalized and unfair for those musicals, yes?   With Something Rotten, I first heard about while I was on a trip in NYC. Week before they started previews, posters for it damn near everywhere. I forgot about it when I returned home until I heard that they were on The Today Show, which I missed. When I finally watched that on YouTube, the first thing I noticed was not all the jokes in 'God, I Hate Shakespeare,' it was all the background singing in the parts like 'How can you say that, how can you say that.' You know what it reminded me of? Queen. I thought 'hey, that's pretty cool, I like it.' Fast forward to when they were on Jimmy Fallon, and premiered 'Hard To Be The Bard.' Oh look, they did more sorta Queen background vocals, but they're shorter, and less chorusy. Awesome, a bit of a change! Then when they released the whole album, and I heard 'A Musical' for the first time, I didnt even hear the Sweeney Todd reference until my fourth or fifth time listening. It was just hidden enough where I felt happy to have noticed it eventually.  I'm sure I'd be impressed with Fun Home's music as well, I just agree that it only won because it was 'edgier.' I thought for sure that if anything was going to beat out Something Rotten, it'd be An American In Paris, another musical that I personally thought could've swept. It did much better at the awards than Something Rotten, but I feel like it also could have done better than Fun Home."
Broadway,38yufe,kbarnett514,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:40:41 2015 UTC,"PREFACE: I know the Tonys include lyrics and music under the same category. I don't think this should be the case, and in any case, as I am primarily a musician, I will be speaking exclusively about music.  First off, Sweeney Todd is hardly ""exactly what Sondheim usually does."" Sondheim creates a unique effect for every one of his shows depending on the setting and desired style. Compare Sweeney Todd to Company, or Sunday In The Park With George, or any of his other shows. Very different, and well-suited to what each musical intends to do. Musicals I consider to have remarkable scores include most of Sondheim, The Light In The Piazza, Carousel, Candide, most of Jason Robert Brown, and so on. These are connected and consistent scores that are best suited to the story they are trying to tell.  Among other things, the score of Something Rotten is unconnected, inconsistent in style (which works somewhat in its favor because of the sort of show it is, but doesn't do so well taken on its own). Any individual song can be good, but you've got to take the score as a whole. Several of the numbers seem haphazardly thrown together; even God I Hate Shakespeare I felt rushed itself with its form. (And I know I said I'd be talking exclusively about music, but I just can't forgive the rhyming of ""penis"" with ""genius"".)   The main point here though, is, again, that any individual song can be good, but you've got to take the score as a whole. The score of Fun Home is uneven so far as my liking of the songs, but it creates its style and sticks with it, and includes leitmotifs very tastefully.  For what it's worth, the first time through both cast albums, I enjoyed Something Rotten, and just didn't get Fun Home. As I've listened to them more, Fun Home has really grown on me, and Something Rotten has really grown old fast. Maybe they'll oscillate. Who knows.  I don't know that I agree about Fun Home Best Musical winning just because it's edgier. Billy Elliot won over Next To Normal, Spamalot won over The Light In The Piazza, and Jersey Boys won over both Drowsy Chaperone and The Color Purple. Sometimes edgy shows win, sometimes edgy shows lose.  I do agree that I thought An American In Paris was the most likely to get it, though. I think it probably has the most round-the-board appeal for everyone."
Broadway,38yufe,Pianoman338,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:46:08 2015 UTC,"I saw it in a preview, and it was amazing. It should have swept, but the more edgy show won simply because it was simply edgier. Which is sad. SR is a fun show that (with some exceptions for language and such), the whole bloody family can see and enjoy. Simply for that alone, never mind for it's individual elements (all of which were amazing during the show I saw), it should have won.  If I were a betting man (not a rich one), I'd bet you exactly what your last point was. It will do great in the NE, NYC, most of the Mid-Atlantic, and the West Coast, but when you move into Middle America and the South, it will absolutely flop. Something Rotten has absolutely nothing to prevent it from being a huge touring success."

Broadway,390sf5,notgoodonchips,2,Mon Jun 8 12:25:50 2015 UTC,"I have read it twice, once in high school because I wanted to, and then again in my junior year at university for an English class.  The most obvious difference I could think of was that the musical took away the literary references, which are a major part of the comic (It's a bond that Allison shares with her father, and he was an English teacher), most notably to the story of Icarus and the life of Oscar Wilde.   I would definitely recommend reading the graphic novel before seeing the musical, as I think it was more powerful as a drama seeing it unfold on stage that way, but I don't think that it necessarily needs to be done that way."
Broadway,390sf5,ME24601,3,Mon Jun 8 20:25:34 2015 UTC,"I actually just read it last week.   So, I believe it's mentioned in the musical that Bruce Bechdel was an English teacher. Well, Alison shares an affinity for literature with her father, and a rather large part of the  second half of the GN is spent comparing the lives, conflicts, and interactions between Alison and her father with those of the characters in the books she's reading.   The time in her life when Alison is discovering her sexuality (As well as the secret life of her father) overlaps with her consumption of a lot of classic literature, and for those of us who aren't so familiar with the plots of the stories to which she refers (much less the subtle character dynamics and interactions she uses to draw comparisons with her family), the GN seems a bit esoteric and even daunting after a while.   I'm glad I read it, because it provided some extra background on the story that helps me appreciate the plot of the musical, but I would be lying if I said I really enjoyed it. No doubt it was really therapeutic for Alison Bechdel to write, and the intended audience seems to really love it, but I guess it's not really for everyone. The musical has broader appeal."
Broadway,390sf5,JayB127,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:19:04 2015 UTC,"I've been a big fan of the novel since it was released, and was hesitant to see the musical as a result.  What if it didn't do it justice?  I wouldn't know how to feel.  I am extremely attached to the memoir and I'd be absolutely heartbroken if the show didn't get it right.  I saw the show on Saturday night and was blown away.  It was my birthday, and seeing the show felt like a once in a lifetime experience.  To see that they won best musical the next day -- wow.    I'll do my best to explain a comparison without giving anything away:  The show absolutely captures the spirit of the novel.  The heartbreak, the fear, the sarcasm, the fun - it's all there.  I was especially interested in how they approached the ""adult Alison"" portion of it, and was initially hesitant, thinking that watching Alison observe her past and draw cartoons on stage would be pretty corny.  But it works.  You get to watch her watch herself, and sometimes you forget she's there, and when you look at her after getting lost in a scene, ... it's either heartbreaking, hilarious, or both.  One thing I absolutely love about the memoir is how Alison is using her stories and illustrations as a way of understanding her family and herself.  She doesn't whack you over the head with her conclusions, so as a result, you feel like you're there learning with her.  It's all very intuitive instead of being explanatory, and it's a journey rather than a destination. The musical has the same feel.    My SO didn't read the novel beforehand and he absolutely loved the show, and now he wants to read it.  But if you have a chance, read the novel first, and then see the show.  I think it's more powerful that way.  Also, the novel goes into much more detail than the show, so it's fun watching what specifics they chose to portray.  Some characters don't get the depth of exploration they do in the memoir, and some get more.    It was an experience I'll always remember!"

To me, EDEN has too many ""big"" songs without enough book support to merit their epicness. (I have the same problem with WICKED, although that seems to have survived a shitty book.)  Also, the book oddly doesn't tap into the universal archetypes that make musicals attractive. If you can't connect to the material, the material won't fly."

Broadway,38v8rj,willynatedgreat,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:49:49 2015 UTC,"I meant to imply that the book to EDEN doesn't tap into universal archetypes (which I find ironic since it's based on the Bible). WICKED, on the other hand, does tap into some of those things. Although with WICKED, I find the novel to get to much more of the girlfriend/sister relationship than the musical does."
Broadway,38px4a,mkwierman,17,Fri Jun 5 21:00:05 2015 UTC,"If they're not added to the ensemble, they generally just sit in the dressing rooms and wait for their part (if they only show up late in the show) or wait for curtain call. I know the actress playing Phoebe in Gent's Guide does the opening with the ensemble and then goes backstage and watches like half a movie on her tablet until she has to go out almost 50 minutes later for ""Inside Out"". Patti LuPone once told a story (I think it was in her book) where, during her run as Fantine in Les Mis, she had turned off the audio feed that she had backstage to keep up with where they were in the show so that she could read a magazine, and she lost track of time; she had almost read the whole thing when the stage manager burst in and told her that she had missed her entrance cue and so Patti had to throw her Fantine dress on and run onstage, and by that time, Colm Wilkinson had been quietly dying for about sixteen measures. So mishaps can happen like that."
Broadway,38px4a,Khaytra,3,Sat Jun 6 02:21:43 2015 UTC,I was gonna tell the Patti story! Here's a link to the excerpt from her book.

Broadway,38px4a,saint_tami,5,Fri Jun 5 23:36:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was my assumption.  I would be surprised if any show can justify somebody who has only a few minutes on stage, because there are usually so many small parts to play -- and it could never hurt to add to the chorus."
Broadway,38px4a,readparse,5,Sat Jun 6 00:08:25 2015 UTC,"If they are qualified as a principal actor, Equity specifically prohibits them from ""appearing in a part in which they would not be recognized"".   Edit: See below clarification"
Broadway,38px4a,DackJ,0,Sat Jun 6 13:53:25 2015 UTC,"Ummm what? Marius is onstage in Les Mis more than anyone else in the show because of all of the ensemble work he does before his character is truly introduced. In the same way, Fiyero does the opening of Wicked, but not dressed as Fiyero. I don't know how factual your statement is."
Broadway,38px4a,tkookookachoo,2,Tue Jun 9 22:54:00 2015 UTC,"I should have specified – Equity makes the final call on that. I assume that in Wicked and in Les Mis, those are both ""artistic"" choices and as such can get away with it. This is (usually) not specified in an AEA contract, but usually included in either the rider or in the casting breakdown provided to the company by AEA, to prevent greedy directors/producers from saying ""well, you're not in Act 1 at all, BUT, we are going to put you in as an ensemble track that in absolutely no way relates to your principal track so that we don't have to hire another actor!""  Source: I work with AEA Production Contracts daily"
Broadway,38px4a,DackJ,12,Tue Jun 9 23:22:31 2015 UTC,"Short answer is be backstage in their dressing rooms.  They would still need to be at the theater at half hour but not necessarily get ready until later in the show if they appeared only in the second half.  If it's a lead, they likely just have a back stage hobby, reading, movies on an iPad etc.  An exception is they could be another role in the show in the ensemble where they're not going to attract attention as the same actor.  For example, in Les Mis, the actress that plays Fantine is on the barricade in act 2 dressed as a boy."
Broadway,38px4a,cwithac,4,Fri Jun 5 22:25:57 2015 UTC,"The actress who plays Fantine is on the barricade in act 2 dressed as a boy.   TIL, thanks!"
Broadway,38px4a,DarthSunshine,2,Sat Jun 6 06:00:18 2015 UTC,"There's actually an interesting story (that I can't find at the momet) about Patti not wanting to be in the rest of the show as another character or in any of the A2 rehearsals, and somehow the solution from the creative point was to make her a boy in A2.  Does anyone know the actual version of that story since I've royally missed important details?"
Broadway,38px4a,notacrook,6,Sat Jun 6 15:02:10 2015 UTC,"In Matilda, Michael Wormwood and Rudolpho have very little on-stage time, but they are actually in the ensemble for the rest of the time as the big kids. I believe Michael Wormwood wears an orange-curly-hair wig, so he's barely recognizable. Unless we're talking about Teen Angel in Grease. That's some pretty short on-stage time."
Broadway,38px4a,TanSquaredPlz,3,Sat Jun 6 03:37:40 2015 UTC,"Often they hang out in the greenroom and chat.   I worked as a dresser on a one woman show with no changes. I was required to be there for emergency sewing and doing laundry, but it was basically 2 hrs of reading a magazine or chatting with the ASM who also had very little to do."
Broadway,38nrtb,dropsomeknowledge,3,Fri Jun 5 12:18:11 2015 UTC,"Something Rotten is hilarious! The music is great and the comedy is perfect - very meta, if you're into that sort of thing. I left thinking that it was the best piece of musical comedy I've seen in a long while. Finding Neverland is truly touching. With melodies you'll remember long after and a heartwarming story, it's a great show. Gentleman's Guide is more refined humor, a bit offensive at times, and sure to make you smile, tap your toes, and leave feeling good. Its score is less memorable, though."
Broadway,38nrtb,puffinprincess,3,Fri Jun 5 18:37:08 2015 UTC,"Out of that list I would recommend Gentleman's Guide. It's very funny, beautifully done, and has all the good elements of a ""true"" Broadway show. If I'm remembering correctly it's at the Walter Kerr, which is one of the smaller Broadway theaters (seats less than 1000). That would work in your favor because it means most of the seats have a good view. I would recommend going as close to the stage and as near to the middle as possible on your budget as my general rule of thumb for ""good"" seats. That being said, I've seen it twice (once from house seats once from the balcony) and it was amazing both times. Balcony gives you a bigger overview of everything, which is nice because the set is spectacular. The only area I would advice to actively stay away from sitting directly under the balcony. Otherwise you should be good!"
Broadway,38nrtb,Yoyti,2,Fri Jun 5 13:28:37 2015 UTC,"I second the recommendation for Gentleman's Guide. It's a fantastic show. It evokes the feelings of classic Broadway without parodying or mocking it (I'm looking at you, Something Rotten), and holds together really nicely. It's got substance, which a lot of comedies don't have. It's very clever, the music is a delight (and the orchestrations are fantastic (I am inordinately fond of the bassoon)), and it's basically if Kander and Ebb teamed up with Gilbert and Sullivan.  (Speaking of shows that evoke the feel of classic operettas, I thought The Visit (by Kander And Ebb)was wonderful, but you seem to be going more in the comedy direction, and while The Visit is a dark comedy like Gentleman's Guide, Gentleman's Guide puts the emphasis on the comedy, while The Visit puts the emphasis on the dark (and also the romantic; it really is a dark spin on The Merry Widow). The Visit is, however, one of the cheapest shows on Broadway right now (you can buy rear balcony seats for $20), so maybe look into it. Really fantastic music.)"

I've loved their stuff from South Park to Cannibal! for years and I love theatre so when I heard about the musical, and they were doing it with Robert Lopez... Needless to say I was beyond excited. They have formed their own film studio though, so there is always hope for a film in the future. The musical is like perfect to me though and I know they'll take their time to make it right or not make it at all if they ever decide to do the movie adaptation"
Broadway,38cd9i,LouisIV,2,Thu Jun 4 12:18:47 2015 UTC,"Me too!! I've been in love with SOuth Park & Matt and Trey since I was 13 and my aunt bought me and my cousin tickets to see the movie - I'd never watching the show before. So it's funny how in all the interviews about BoM Trey has to explain how everything they do is a musical, because that's how I was introduced to them. And I saw Ave Q when it opened in London (also when they were writing the first BoM songs) and I was insulted that the writers thought they could get away with being ""edgy"" with shit South Park did 10 years ago, only to find out 6 years later that Bobby was directly influenced and fully acknowledges it (you know, the whole thanking them in the Playbill for the inspiration).  lol, yeah, ""Important Studios"" lolol. They considered ""Very Important Studios"" but thought it was too pompous, lololol. I'm not ruling out a BoM movie, but knowing them, again, I really don't have ANY hopes - that way I can be super stoked if they do make one!  Where do you live? Have you seen the show? I just saw it for the 20th time two days ago! I can't get enough and gahhhhh. S.W.I.M. has quite a few bootlegs, if you're interested. :D"

Broadway,37ssvq,alivesince1985,2,Sat May 30 02:37:45 2015 UTC,"My main problem with this song is that too many of the jokes are in specific and blatant references to other shows. Les Miserables may be popular now, but in ten years, that joke might not land at all. Besides it's kind of cheap ""let's laugh because Les Mis doesn't have talking."" Something well done, I think, is in the dance break, where in the brass you can hear snippets from Gypsy, West Side Story, and The Music Man, but it's all in the same style as the general dance music. So if you know those tunes, and catch them in the dance, you'll smile at the reference, but if you don't get the reference, it doesn't make a difference because it doesn't seem out of place. The ideal reference is one that if you don't get it, it's not conspicuous, so while you might not be getting everything out of it, you're still not losing anything."
Broadway,37ssvq,Yoyti,10,Sat May 30 03:09:50 2015 UTC,"You're really doubting the longevity of Les Miserables? That's the one you have a problem with? If there are people still listening to Something Rotten! in 10 years, I dare say they'll get the Les Miz jokes.  I do agree with your points on references in general, though."
Broadway,37ssvq,saxman481,-1,Sat May 30 03:25:39 2015 UTC,"That was just a hypothetical example. But what's popular comes and goes, and I know people are musical fans, or starting to become, but know nothing about Gypsy or The Music Man, or other shows that a lot of us just take as givens. My point is that unless it's that integral to the plot (like Shakespeare is in Something Rotten, so references to him get a pass), you shouldn't count on your audience knowing anything outside of the show. Same thing with adapting a book to film, or a book to stage, or a film to stage. You don't want the audience to have to depend on the original to understand the adaptation. But here it's worse, because while it's easy for a potential ticket buyer to Google Les Miserables and then find out about the book it's based on, with the eclectic references in Something Rotten! there's no way for the audience to know in advance what original to be familiar with."
Broadway,37ssvq,Yoyti,3,Sat May 30 03:36:57 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point, but couldn't you say that about the whole thing? It references William Shakespeare, The Renaissance, The 16th Century etc etc. And couldn't you also say that about a load of musicals?   I mean sure there's been a few times I've gone to musicals/plays and haven't understood the references - Peter & The Starcatcher (I hadn't seen Peter Pan), and It Shoulda Been You (I'm Australian, no Jews near me) - so I totally get where you're coming from, but that's not going to stop me from loving the hell out of this song and the whole musical. It's stupid, it's catchy, and was just wonderful to watch."
Broadway,37ssvq,Yoyti,3,Sat May 30 03:29:12 2015 UTC,"Shakespeare references get a pass in Something Rotten, because he's so integral to the show. Anyone who's done any cursory research on the show will know they should be at least a little familiar with Shakespeare before seeing it.  If a musical is an adaptation, it should take care that the audience does not have to depend on the source material. This is true of any adaptation. But still, it's not as bad an offense, because it is incredibly easy to Google Les Miserables, and find out all about the book it's based on.  With this song, there are a bunch of random references out of nowhere, with no reason to expect the audience to get them, and no way for the audience to know in advance which musicals they should have seen before this one, and the references are so conspicuous that if you don't know what they're referencing, they leave a gaping hole.  The Book Of Mormon handles this very well. A lot of the songs are homages to other shows, but if you don't know what they're homages to, it doesn't take anything away from the song, and you won't even know you missed a reference. Here, with a lot of the lines, it's clear that a reference is being made, so if you don't get it, you know immediately that there's something that you didn't get. And because the specific references being made are so random, and musical theater so broad, there's basically no way to do your research ahead of time, nor any apparent reason you should see to need to do research in the first place."
Broadway,37ssvq,teacherdrama,0,Sat May 30 03:45:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you sound like someone with sour grapes about not getting some references. You didn't get the references? Too bad - go do some research or shut up about it. I got most of the references in A Musical with no trouble. I found a video done by the composers that outline all the references in it, and there were a couple I even missed (I've been a musical theater fan for nearly thirty years and own nearly 2500 cast albums).  I wasn't upset I missed them - I was more impressed than anything else.   And if you think people aren't going to get Les Mis references, your judgement is questionable to begin with..."
Broadway,37ssvq,Yoyti,2,Sat Jun 6 21:58:35 2015 UTC,"It's more the references I did get that upset me. I watched that video, and was thoroughly impressed with some of the references. Like that single bar of underscoring from Putting It Together that I totally missed. What I have a problem with is getting cheap laughs from quoting somebody else. The musical quotes from Gypsy and West Side Story and Sunday In The Park With George were very good references, because if you got them, they were good, but if you didn't, they were subsumed in the greater scheme of the song so they didn't stick out like a sore thumb. The Annie reference is something that just sticks out at the audience to make them say ""Hey, I got that reference,"" and if they didn't, it says ""this doesn't make any sense."" There are a million better ways to write jokes than to just bounce off of the success of others, and a million better ways to do it tastefully. The Book Of Mormon did it tastefully, because nowhere does it jump out at you as saying ""this is a reference I am or am not getting."" Something Rotten cannot claim that.  The Les Mis, like I said, I gave for the sake of an example, but you never know what musicals are going to be the hits fifty years from now."
Broadway,37ssvq,teacherdrama,0,Sat Jun 6 22:48:08 2015 UTC,"See, as much as I like Book of Mormon, I disagree. There are references, for example, to Wicked and to Lion King that are CLEARLY references that someone fifty years from now might not get. I don't think there's any question that those moments are references. I don't think any of the references that are made, in SR or in Book of Mormon, are ones that the majority of people wouldn't get. Most, if not all, of the audience gets the Annie reference. It's not like Annie is some obscure show. On the same token, Annie is going to be around longer than Something Rotten. It's not like it's making a reference to The Light in the Piazza in an obvious way - the shows that are obviously called on are ones that have already shown they have legs. Les Mis, Wicked, Annie - these are the staples of musical theater. Let's be honest, if you didn't get those references, you most likely aren't watching Something Rotten anyway. I don't think there's anything wrong with that.   If you go back to old vaudeville shows, there are references to other shows made. We don't get them now because the references are so obscure now, but that doesn't mean those references shouldn't have been made to audiences that DO get them.   Listen to Sondheim's song ""I'm Still Here.""  There are tons of references to pop culture most people today would have no clue about. DOes that make the song any less listenable today?"
Broadway,37ssvq,Yoyti,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:08:50 2015 UTC,"(First off, I totally forgot about the Lion King reference in Book Of Mormon. Is Wicked referenced directly? I thought it was one of the songs the music of which is clearly a parody of Wicked; because if you don't know Wicked, that won't stand out, you'll just suppose it's the style of that song.)  My main problem is that a show that could have stood perfectly well on its own felt the need to pad everything out with something so cheap just to get a few more laughs, and it worked too well, and now the show's being hailed as the greatest thing ever. And the references are so conspicuous that they overshadow what else there was to appreciate. I was liking A Musical until it turned into a five-minute medley of filler.  W.S. Gilbert made a lot of topical references in his librettos. A lot of them manage to work without getting the reference, such as the character of Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S. Pinafore. Other times, it's traditional to update the line to whatever's funniest at the time, such as a ""Wesleyan Methodist of the most bigoted and persecuting type"" in The Gondoliers becoming a ""Westboro Baptist"". This even happens when the original joke wasn't topical, such as Pooh-Bah's assorted titles in The Mikado. But this is a lot harder to do in songs, and it leaves the Captain Shaw line in Iolanthe hanging like Buquet's corpse in Phantom.  I'm Still Here is an entirely different beast. Follies is a mood piece, and what's being sung matters less than that the audience understand the tone. I'm Still Here never gets any laughs of understanding, nor should it. Those references were outdated when they were made. The show premiered in 1971, and most of the specific references were from the twenties to forties. And that's the point of the song."
Broadway,37ssvq,teacherdrama,0,Sat Jun 6 23:49:09 2015 UTC,"Right - I understand that with Follies. I'm just pointing out that the references clearly go over people's heads (now and then) but it doesn't stand in the way of understanding the song. I don't think people not getting the Annie reference in A Musical are going to not get the song because they didn't get it.  As far as Wicked, if I remember from the show correctly, the staging is also very much a reference to Wicked. I don't think it's just in the music. An example of that from BoM would be The Sound of Music reference in I Believe. If you get it, great, if not, nothing missed.  I agree with you that that type of reference is better in that it's more subtle, I'm just arguing that there's nothing explicitly wrong with references that hit you over the head either.  I wrote a YA book set in a theater school where I peppered references throughout. On counting, I had well over 100 references to musicals throughout the book - some explicit, some far more subtle. The subtle were more fun to write, but the obvious references are necessary because most people aren't as much of a theater geek as I am. If I wanted any chance of making the book potentially commercial, I needed to make sure I included both types - so the die hards would get the hidden references, but most people would catch obvious references to The Sound of Music or what have you."
Broadway,37ssvq,Yoyti,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:31:51 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but I find it frustrating that they felt it was necessary, given that the show has a lot of worth without the references, and adding them in just feels to me, (and I've said this word a lot, but I can't think of a better one), cheap.  Maybe I'm just an overly ""do it for the art"" kind of person, but in that video, the writers said the ""I believe it's pronounced..."" line got the biggest laugh of the evening. I think that draws attention away from lines that should get more laughs and are absolutely brilliant, such as the incredibly clever rhymes ""you're not even close, you remember that, dammit/your play's got to be in iambic pentamet/er"" or ""the wiz o'/the Eliza/bethan stage."" That's the sort of thing I think the show should be acknowledged for. Not just piles upon piles of references that even have the slightest potential to date the show or restrict its audience."
Broadway,37ssvq,teacherdrama,0,Sun Jun 7 00:49:12 2015 UTC,"I think it's the difference between musical theater fans and the casual viewers. I get your point (again, I totally did that in my book), but the casual viewer is not going to pick up on the two second reference to Sunday in the Park with George. I'm willing to bet 95% of the audience got the Annie and Les Mis references. Those references are necessary if you're doing this kind of show for that very reason - if they want the casual theater goer to understand and appreciate the show, they're going to have to throw them a few bones. Those kinds of jokes allow the more subtle jokes to get through.  And I totally agree that the lyrics are brilliant throughout the show. I think we have to remember that only a small percentage of the audience is really going to appreciate and relish those lyrics - for the majority of people they hear it once and it's done. The hit you over the head lyrics allow the writers to do far more subtle and cool things than they would be able to get away with otherwise. My personal favorite reference is to ""Joseph..."" (a show I find average) in the song Something Rotten. It's just a very clever use of music and lyrics to make the reference."

Broadway,37ev7e,ZoruaUnited,2,Wed May 27 02:54:05 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how much broadway tickets were to If/Then but normally tickets are cheaper on tour. The only difference with If/Then will be Idina. Is she is in your performance expect to pay broadway prices. You can check your theaters website for other touring shows to get a general idea of seating and price structures. If Idina is not in your show you can probably wait and get rush tickets or discount tickets closer to the show - especially for week night performances.
Broadway,37ev7e,Jonnyg42,2,Wed May 27 14:54:47 2015 UTC,It was fairly easy for a lot of my friends to win the lotto tickets for If/Then when it was on Broadway so they were only paying $35 (I think it was?) a ticket. It definitely will depend on if Idina will be in it then.

Broadway,378av0,Eldi13,6,Mon May 25 18:21:43 2015 UTC,"Wicked is a super popular show and they don't offer any discounts or coupon codes. Weeknights are cheaper but it looks like $90/seat is about the cheapest right now for a full view.   Most of Wicked's action is in the center. Partial view means you'll miss some scenery and maybe some minor movement (plus see slightly backstage, which is distracting for some people) but nothing major. Sit in the farthest back partials available - Row G is barely a partial view but Row BB is significantly partial.   Don't go to the TKTS booth, they won't have any for Wicked. (But if you want to see a second Broadway show, go visit them. Here are all the shows at TKTS: http://www.entertainment-link.com/tkts.asp)  Wicked Lottery Rush: A day-of-performance lottery for 26 select orchestra seats for $30.00 each will be held daily. Each day, 2 ½ hours prior to show time, people who present themselves at the Gershwin Theatre box office will have their names placed in a hat. 30 minutes later, names will be drawn for 26 orchestra seats at $30.00 each. This lottery is available only in-person at the box office, with a limit of two tickets per person, cash only. Photo-ID required."

I'd imagine it would be, but I might have up to four people with me to enter their names. Do you think the show would sell out if we were to wait to purchase our tickets the day of, assuming we didn't win the lottery?  At this point, I'm kinda leaning towards the partially obstructed view down front, just 'cause it'll be so much closer than the very back of the mezzanine..."

According to one of the guys who works there, fewer tourists show up to that one because most are leaving town on Sunday nights and wouldn't make the show anyway. I've entered maybe four or five times, and won twice! Once I went with four people who each entered (you can choose if you want one or two tickets) and we had two winners so we all got to see the show! I recommend doing the lottery because its a fun experience too. But if you are on a tighter schedule it can be difficult to pull it off, especially if you're trying to plan to see shows on multiple nights."

Broadway,36zgnh,rozzingit,2,Sat May 23 13:38:14 2015 UTC,"Here's some real inside shit: If you're unable to find any available tickets for the time you're looking at, find out who the standbys are for the two main leads. Oftentimes standbys will have some social media thing you can follow that alerts fans when they're going on (I know A.J. Holmes did when he was Cunningham standby on Broadway). When they announce they're going on, call the box office a few times to see if any ticketholders have cancelled and released their seats. These tickets are typically right around the budget you're looking for.   Otherwise: go through official sales, and look at Wednesday Matinees and Tuesday nights (do they play Tuesdays?) since those are usually less busy theatre nights. Don't count on weekend tickets; the tourists already snatched those up."

Broadway,36se0b,saxman481,5,Thu May 21 19:49:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Parade lasted out its contractual run. Would it have done better commercially? Probably not. Jason Robert Brown doesn't have a good track record with longevity."
Broadway,36se0b,icancook2,6,Thu May 21 21:13:01 2015 UTC,"Parade had its faults originally, though fortunately it was later revised, and fixed pretty much all of them.  Bridges I have no idea why it failed so much as it did. That could just be because I'm bitter about having missed the chance to see it.  JRB doesn't have a great record with shows. Even The Last 5 Years, though never actually on Broadway, only lasted two months off-Broadway. 13 and Honeymoon In Vegas each only lasted about a hundred performances too. I have to wonder why that is, given that his shows tend to be really good, and everyone always seems to love his work."
Broadway,36se0b,Yoyti,7,Fri May 22 00:49:25 2015 UTC,"The problem with Bridges was the book. They expanded the story to include Francesca's family, which worked to build her character and explain her motivations, but slowed the pacing of the show down and introduced songs that stuck out from an otherwise heavenly score.  The Last Five Years had to be confusing when it first opened. The 2013 revival did well because it had developed a big following by then, but I totally get why it originally flopped.  Honeymoon in Vegas was an adaptation of a 90's movie that isn't popular, and got quite a bit of flack online for its (at least perceived) racism and misogyny.  13 was terrible, as was Urban Cowboy. In my opinion, anyway. I, for one, completely understand why they flopped.  To be a JRB fan is to have one's heart broken at regular intervals."
Broadway,36se0b,saxman481,3,Fri May 22 01:01:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 13 I don't like, except for a few individual songs.  For Last 5 Years, I'm not sure how much I buy into the confusing card. Company lasted over seven-hundred performances. Sunday In The Park With George also did pretty well in its original run. More recently If/Then lasted four-hundred performances, which, if not a huge success, is still four times the run of most of JRB's shows.  Bridges I'll take your word for, since I didn't get to see it, unfortunately.  As far as Honeymoon In Vegas goes, I don't think what material a show is adapted from hugely matters, so long as it's not actively considered bad. Is the movie actively considered a bad movie? Or is it just a movie that happened not to get popular, or is it just sort of meh? I watched it and thought it was just sort of meh, but I'm not a huge movie person, so I leave a lot of movies feeling like that. I didn't think it was misogynistic, certainly not any more so than a number of very popular shows, and while I guess I can see the racism card being played, that's also a wild card, considering shows like The Book Of Mormon and The King And I."

All of those other musical are linear, whereas they have a discernible beginning and end. For the last five years, you start at the end, then directly go to... The beginning?

Broadway,36se0b,amflemmy,2,Fri May 22 02:41:24 2015 UTC,I can only imagine how fabulous that show is.
Broadway,36se0b,Yoyti,2,Fri May 22 06:52:07 2015 UTC,"I don't want to say Merrily We Roll Along or Parade, because both of those were flawed shows that eventually got fixed, nor do I want to say Anyone Can Whistle, because I haven't actually seen it, so for all I know, it's only good as a cast album -- though my research does show it to be highly flawed.  I think I'd go with Soul Doctor, from just a couple years ago. It lasted 66 performances on Broadway, but I quite enjoyed it. It was about the life of Shlomo Carlebach, a rabbi who took 60s music and pop sensibilities and put them into his tradition, and essentially became something of a hippie rabbi. I would say part of its failure was that it would mostly appeal to people who are already versed in Jewish tradition and music, but that doesn't account for Fiddler On The Roof. Plus, most of the reviews seemed to be positive. Shame there wasn't a cast album."
Broadway,36se0b,saxman481,2,Fri May 22 00:59:43 2015 UTC,Soul Doctor   That show is crazy. I'm pretty sure it's already had 3 New York productions. Someone with money really loves it.
Broadway,36se0b,Yoyti,1 point,Fri May 22 01:11:44 2015 UTC,I saw Anyone Can Whistle at City Center Encores...there was a reason it flopped. Even a cast including Donna Murphy and Sutton Foster couldn't help it.
Broadway,36se0b,pleasereview,1 point,Fri May 22 12:09:39 2015 UTC,"That's what I figured. And having read the script, I don't know how it could be saved. I just love the songs."
Broadway,36se0b,nickyardo,2,Fri May 22 21:02:00 2015 UTC,"I actually really like The Times They Are A-Changin'. The entire cast was really talented, and the music is fun. It was bad, sure, but fun."
Broadway,36se0b,tkookookachoo,2,Fri May 22 02:22:44 2015 UTC,I really liked Ghost
Broadway,36se0b,nickyardo,1 point,Fri May 22 06:56:54 2015 UTC,"Ghost wasn't necessarily a huge flop, but I agree. It was a show I really didn't expect to enjoy but was thoroughly surprised by. That show had some quality music."
Broadway,36se0b,of_mice_and_meh,1 point,Sat May 30 00:28:11 2015 UTC,It really did. I love the music
Broadway,36se0b,theblakesheep,1 point,Sat May 30 02:20:35 2015 UTC,Maybe the person who said that was referring to the revival? The original run was almost four years. It was not a flop.
Broadway,36se0b,of_mice_and_meh,5,Thu May 21 19:56:15 2015 UTC,"It was a critical flop, and I think it may have never turned a profit, if I remember correctly"
Broadway,36se0b,icancook2,4,Thu May 21 20:43:39 2015 UTC,I never knew that. It's amazing it ran for that long and didn't make any money.
Broadway,36se0b,comixlover13,3,Thu May 21 21:48:02 2015 UTC,With a song as popular as 'This Is The Moment' none the less.
Broadway,36se0b,broadwaylove,2,Fri May 22 06:56:20 2015 UTC,You are correct.
Broadway,36se0b,cassiebanaszek,1 point,Thu May 21 21:13:44 2015 UTC,"I've always enjoyed Drat! The Cat! I originally discovered it because I love Susan Egan and tracked down the 90s recording.  Looking up history of the show, I was surprised to see the original production only ran 8 shows, especially given it had a good cast and a couple songs went on to be hits for Barbra Streisand.  Her then husband, Elliott Gould,  was in the cast as was Lesley Anne Warren , Jane Connell and Charles Durning."
Broadway,36se0b,Bruin_In_Iowa,1 point,Fri May 22 08:09:32 2015 UTC,"I have never seen a production of The Baker's Wife (and obviously for good reasons, so I've heard at least), but I'm actually pretty guilty of playing the shitastic sounding cast recording all of the time.  But it never made it to Broadway, so does that count?!  I wish I liked Side Show more (especially the recent revival… saw it in DC), but I just couldn't get into it!  I wouldn't exactly call these flops but Bridges and Big Fish are a big favorite of mine as well.  I guess you could call Big Fish more a flop than Bridges, though."
Broadway,36ravz,singoutlouise,4,Thu May 21 14:28:38 2015 UTC,"There might be an actual name for them, but on my course we just call them stand alone songs. Hope that helps!"
Broadway,36ravz,SquareTed,1 point,Thu May 21 15:37:18 2015 UTC,"Sure, that's a fair name for them. Thanks!"
Broadway,36ravz,smoklahoman,3,Thu May 21 15:39:58 2015 UTC,Try to look for smaller up and coming composers. They have a lot of cabaret style stand alone songs. Kerrigan and Loudermilk comes to mind.
Broadway,36ravz,RaeADropOfGoldenSun,2,Fri May 22 00:19:10 2015 UTC,"Sure, I know where to find them, thanks for the suggestions! I was more looking for people's opinions on what the style of song is referred to as. Seems people are mostly suggesting ""cabaret"" is the genre."
Broadway,36ravz,1kidney_left,2,Fri May 22 00:23:36 2015 UTC,I've always called them cabaret songs or cabaret show tunes.
Broadway,36ravz,thesweetestpunch,3,Thu May 21 21:31:50 2015 UTC,"If you are trying to label the types of songs that you might typically find in the Great American Songbook, which principally consists of Broadway, of film scores, the most generic title would be a ""standard"". Some call them American Standards. But outside the US, you would call them what they most closely resemble, like a blues standard, jazz standard, or even pop standard.   Hope this helps."
Broadway,36ravz,The_Vile_Prince,2,Thu May 21 18:49:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input!  I always assumed that 'standard' implied that the song was well known in popular culture and covered often. I guess the kind of songs I'm talking about are covered in the theater scene often enough, though."
Broadway,36ravz,The_Vile_Prince,2,Thu May 21 18:54:09 2015 UTC,"I'll eat my hat if ""Taylor the Latte Boy"" is a standard. It's a Cabaret standard, but not a standard.   Like how in attractiveness, a Los Angeles 4 is a Mississippi 10."
Broadway,36ravz,thesweetestpunch,1 point,Thu May 21 22:26:28 2015 UTC,"Hah I don't like it either, just figured it was a recognizable example."
Broadway,36ravz,thesweetestpunch,1 point,Thu May 21 23:32:20 2015 UTC,"""Till I hear you sing,"" from Love Never Dies... Maybe?"
Broadway,36ravz,missfarin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:10:29 2015 UTC,Is that a suggestion of a song in that genre? My question was specifically about songs unassociated with existing shows.
Broadway,36rvcv,TheEpicSax,5,Thu May 21 17:00:31 2015 UTC,I would suggest checking out the Today Tix app. Code KSUAL for $20 off first purchase. The cheapest Broadway show they have is The Visit for $25.
Broadway,36rvcv,redsonya1976,2,Thu May 21 17:19:14 2015 UTC,"Seconding TodayTix app. TKTS is obsolete and inconvenient. Shows to see right now are The Visit, Something Rotten, Fun Home, The King and I, and Hand to God."
Broadway,36rvcv,thesweetestpunch,2,Thu May 21 18:00:02 2015 UTC,"Fun Home and Something Rotten in my opinion are the best things showing right now. Hand to God is also very good from what I've heard (one of the few I haven't been able to see yet). If you can get tickets magically then Hamilton is the hot OB show right now, soon to be moving to Broadway."
Broadway,36rvcv,spoonfedkyle,1 point,Thu May 21 19:24:39 2015 UTC,"Are you a student? If so, you can get discount student tickets on tix4students.com to plenty of good shows - Fun Home, Les Miserables, Something Rotten, The Visit, etc.  An American in Paris is a hot show no one's mentioned yet."
Broadway,36ksv3,czere,2,Wed May 20 02:53:37 2015 UTC,The show that is...that wasn't a very effective post title!

Broadway,36ksv3,mgrevan,1 point,Wed May 20 02:54:11 2015 UTC,The show has maybe one or two good songs. Other than that it's kind of forgettable.
Broadway,36e6ly,missfarin,19,Mon May 18 18:05:14 2015 UTC,"Wow, they are batting a thousand with casting this role."
Broadway,36e6ly,NLaBruiser,9,Mon May 18 20:08:20 2015 UTC,I'm indifferent about casting... I was more shocked by finding out that Idina and Taye got a divorce.

Broadway,36e6ly,MovieGirl424,8,Tue May 19 01:52:29 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Hedwig's been a dream role of mines, and seeing another african-american play it on broadway is like, ""Woah. It's actually happening."" Very curious on what changes they'll do for costuming, he's got the same skin tone as I do."
Broadway,36e6ly,atc593,15,Tue May 19 04:17:02 2015 UTC,And Taye Diggs was also in Hurt Locker: The Musical... This is going to be fun.
Broadway,36e6ly,jakielim,3,Mon May 18 21:50:43 2015 UTC,"Haha, good catch!! Maybe they'll change the playbill to have NPH in there instead or something :P"
Broadway,36e6ly,melcrawmeow,6,Tue May 19 17:41:51 2015 UTC,Beyond happy about this!
Broadway,36e6ly,broadwaybaby616,5,Mon May 18 18:42:24 2015 UTC,Really delighted!  I wanted to see this with Rebecca Naomi Jones but was hesitant about Darren Criss.  This is perfect!
Broadway,36e6ly,desolee,3,Mon May 18 20:44:46 2015 UTC,Holy shit
Broadway,36e6ly,AmazingCavalieri,2,Mon May 18 19:21:59 2015 UTC,He has an awesome voice. I am glad he is going to be singing in something again!
Broadway,36e6ly,Entershakira,-10,Mon May 18 22:24:36 2015 UTC,"This is all wrong. Aside from the obvious racial issues, his voice is not stylistically right for Hedwig at all. So disappointed."
Broadway,36e6ly,notacrook,3,Tue May 19 03:59:53 2015 UTC,Aside from the obvious racial issues.   ...what?
Broadway,36e6ly,melcrawmeow,1 point,Tue May 19 15:02:56 2015 UTC,"The only time I see race as an issue in theatre casting is the shows that revolve completely around race, like Hairspray for example. I see way more of an issue with a 29 year old playing Hedwig, who had already moved to the US and had a sex change when the Berlin Wall fell."
Broadway,36e6ly,notacrook,-2,Tue May 19 17:44:15 2015 UTC,"He's black. Hedwig is post-Nazi Germany. I dunno if you were aware, but there were hardly any black people left after the Holocaust. Plus, recall his surprise in original scripts when he sees Luther, the first African-American he's ever seen."
Broadway,36e6ly,notacrook,5,Tue May 19 15:44:30 2015 UTC,"So what about Norm Lewis when he played the Phantom...or when he was Billy Flynn in Chicago?   I dunno if you were aware, but there were hardly any black people left after the Holocaust.   There were hardly any black people in that part of the world before the Holocaust.  While it's true that the Nazi's were no fan of African people of any kind and they put them at the bottom of the social totem-pole, there were actually Afro-Germans that served in the Nazi party and the Nazi Youth.  That's not to say it didn't fucking suck to be black in Germany, but to claim that there are no Black people in Germany because of the Holocaust is pretty ignorant.  Nazi policy in some regards actually was to have no official policy for the handling of Afro-German specific concerns as they deemed the population too small to warrant the policies.  Since you seem so determined to follow the logic of the production as it was presented in 1998 that would make Hedwig around 35 at the time...counting backwards that makes her born in the mid 60s, about 20 years after the end of Nazi rule.  Do you have the same problem that MCH, NPH, and Darren Criss are all too young to be playing Hedwig - because by your logic they should all be almost 50 in real time.  Have you seen the Broadway production?  Do you know that they revised it to work with their new location and to make the piece feel natural on Broadway?  Why wouldn't they be able to do the same with that single line about Luther?  And even then, couldn't it be rewritten so that it's actually a more impactful line.  Luther is the first black man that he's seen that isn't his father - it makes the infatuation seem a little more real and intense too.  Let's also not forget that Taye Diggs is an amazing performer who is going to kill it as Hedwig, that JCM and Steven Trask are heavily involved in this production and they've extensively modified the show already to customize it to individual performers.  Oh and one more thing?  In that original off-Broadway production?  Hedwig was even played by Ally Sheedy who contrary to popular belief, is an actual woman."
Broadway,36e6ly,Adelaidey,1 point,Tue May 19 16:25:06 2015 UTC,"Well, I see your point about Afro-Germans. Just an aside though - every actor you mentioned aside from Darren Criss is around that age.  And Darren Criss is too you to play Hedwig, just saying. I have seen the new Broadway production, one with NPH and once with JCM. And while I agree Taye is an awesome actor, he hasn't done well in recent endeavors. And even if, his style is all wrong for the ""punk rock star of stage and screen""."
Broadway,36e6ly,crashboom,1 point,Tue May 19 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"MCH and MCH are both 10 years younger than JCM (who I'm equating to being the ""correct"" age for the age of the character if, for some reason, this was real life).  Andrew Rannels is 15 years younger.   he hasn't done well in recent endeavors   And those recent endeavors are...?   And even if, his style is all wrong for the ""punk rock star of stage and screen"".   According to you."
Broadway,369gu7,golden_light_above_u,4,Sun May 17 14:03:34 2015 UTC,"Jimmy Fallon and Lorne Michaels were in the audience when I saw It's Only A Play...everyone was mobbing them for pictures (well, mostly Jimmy) and intermission ran long because the ushers just could not control the crowd. A few people even tried to take pictures of them during the first act while the show was going on. Always cool seeing famous people at shows but I wish audiences could still remember theater etiquette!"
Broadway,369gu7,flyingpigsfly,1 point,Sun May 17 21:45:07 2015 UTC,"They did a good job with the Clintons -- they seated them after the house lights went down, and then whisked them out at intermission before the house lights went up. During the intermission they re-entered, and that's when everyone went nuts. I think they let intermission run a little long to let everyone get a good look, and then the place settled down for act 2. Probably having Secret Service there kept people a little better behaved."
Broadway,369gu7,Homo-Erect,2,Mon May 18 00:37:02 2015 UTC,Awesome!

Broadway,35o49s,melcrawmeow,4,Tue May 12 02:23:27 2015 UTC,"A 29 year old as Hedwig makes no sense to me. He looks as young here as his age, but was supposed to have already moved to the US when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. Silly."
Broadway,35o49s,missfarin,2,Tue May 12 17:04:00 2015 UTC,"Weirdly, it didn't affect the performance as much as I thought it would, although they did add in a line that pokes fun at Darren's youth (something about concealer).   Sorry, thread hijack."
Broadway,35o49s,melcrawmeow,2,Wed May 13 14:00:06 2015 UTC,"Someone else I know saw the show and enjoyed him also. I'm really partial to MCH so maybe that's why a 29 year old glee kid is so off-putting to me. Theatre obviously doesn't always stay true to age, but this one in particular bugs me."
Broadway,35o49s,BaldEagle88,-6,Wed May 13 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"As someone who does theatre professionally for a living, I'd like to give you a whole hearted, fuck you for taking pictures during a performance."

Broadway,35o49s,BaldEagle88,-4,Tue May 12 22:03:02 2015 UTC,"Any actor I know, myself included will talk absolute shit backstage if we ever see anyone in the audience with a phone. It can also come back to bite you in the butt if you're waiting outside the backstage door."

No. On a rare opportunity they have found them if it gets really bad. But usually an actor will come backstage and say, there's some bastard house R snapping photos."

Broadway,35o49s,BaldEagle88,0,Wed May 13 20:19:28 2015 UTC,Like I said. It happens once in a blue moon when they actually send someone out to grab someone. And we know that it will be more commotion than taking a picture it will. It's just the principal of the matter. You're told not to do it. It's in the rules.

Broadway,35nrrw,alivesince1985,5,Tue May 12 04:23:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I'm being rude. I just don't see the fascination with FN. It's a good show, but it's not a great show. The music isn't memorable, the choreo isn't that crash hot, the whole thing just felt a bit clumsy. I was happy I saw it, sure, but would I see it again? Probably not.  Don't even get me started on It Shoulda Been You.  Meanwhile, no Hand To God nods? Only the one Something Rotten achievement?"
Broadway,35nrrw,alivesince1985,3,Tue May 12 04:44:09 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm with you on ISBY. Awful, just so bad. Hand To God, I dunno. It was hilarious but I feel like the ending left a lot to be desired. And Something Rotten? I guess you liked that one. I liked the show, but the score was so unbelievably bad. Like, they are pushing ""I Hate Shakespeare"" as one of the signature songs. I can't even at that. Even FN had a better score than Something Rotten."
Broadway,35nrrw,Homo-Erect,0,Tue May 12 11:16:41 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah I liked SR! a lot. I can remember a lot of songs from it too (Welcome to the Renaissance, Put On A Musical, I Hate Shakespeare, Will Power), whereas I can't remember a single one from FN without looking it up. Hand To God I was standing up as soon as it ended I found it that good, but of course I understand that it's each to their own, and that's the beauty of theatre I guess.   As for SR! pushing I Hate Shakespeare, well I guess it reveals a bit about what the show's about for people who haven't got a clue. If they see that it's about a couple of guys competing with Shakespeare in Shakespearean times, then the story and humour will flow from there."
Broadway,35hhm9,zeroace123,13,Sun May 10 12:25:55 2015 UTC,"Broadway shows rehearse in studios in NYC. There are a number of studios that are particularly desirable for productions, mostly for their location and size. The three nonprofit producing entities on Broadway (Lincoln Center Theater, Roundabout, and Manhattan Theatre Club) each have their own rehearsal studios that they rent to other producers when they're not being used for their in-house productions. The only commercial Broadway house with its own rehearsal studios (that I know of) is the Lyric. Most of the others are much too small.  During rehearsals before tech the show is generally being loaded into the theatre - it's impossible to rehearse on the actual stage when that stage is still being built. Usually the actual show furniture and many of the show props are used in rehearsal, though sometimes rehearsal versions are substituted. Often, mockup versions of any set pieces that actors directly interact with - doors, stairs, platforms, so forth - are used in the rehearsal hall; this is especially important for shows with a lot of choreography.  Rehearsals for replacements often happen in much smaller studios than the ones used for putting up a whole production, and there are usually fewer (if any) scenic elements involved. Replacements get a put-in rehearsal on the actual stage with tech, usually within a couple of days before their debut.   Understudy rehearsals generally happen anywhere between once per week and once or twice per month, depending on the needs of the production. They happen on the actual stage, but usually without tech or costumes. Generally speaking, rehearsals on stage tend to be limited, as they're expensive for producers - in a Local 1 house, most of the crew has to be called in and paid, per union rules, whenever any activity is happening on stage."
Broadway,35hhm9,amarkit,5,Sun May 10 16:03:41 2015 UTC,"You are correct and your wife is wrong, so you may want to just drop this argument forever.  There are a few rehearsal studios with spaces large enough to tape out a Broadway stage (so if there's an upper level in the set and a staircase, the actor can be standing in the taped out section where the upper area will be, and then ""walk down"" the taped out steps). The actors don't rehearse in the actual venue until just before the audiences start coming, when all the technical elements are put into the show."
Broadway,35hhm9,zac850,4,Sun May 10 13:07:45 2015 UTC,"I've been listening to Penn Jillette talk about his upcoming run on Broadway on his podcast... he made the point that union regulations make it rather costly to rehearse on the actual stages.  If I recall correctly, he cited a cost of a few grand just to rehearse, but they may be hyperbole/my failing memory."
Broadway,35hhm9,ElPolloRacional,2,Sun May 10 14:47:47 2015 UTC,"Not the actors union, but the stage hands and tech unions require a certain amount of staff be on hand for all rehearsals on stage. It can be quite cost prohibitive."
Broadway,35hhm9,Brnny202,2,Sun May 10 15:37:10 2015 UTC,"(Quick disclaimer that I've never actually experienced this firsthand and this is all knowledge I've gathered peripherally, so any and all corrections welcome!)  Generally, a show is rehearsed in a studio. They won't actually start rehearsing in the theatre until tech, which is when they run the show with the full sets and lights (and, eventually, costumes) before previews. For replacements, I believe the process is largely the same – they start in a studio until put-in day, when they run the show with the cast, on the set, in full costume. I think understudy rehearsals may occur in the theatre, but not necessarily with full sets, costumes, and cast."
Broadway,35hhm9,missfarin,1 point,Sun May 10 12:49:53 2015 UTC,You're both right. Most Broadway shows and theatre in general are rehearsed in studios and on the stage. Usually starting in the studio and moving to the stage. Some theaters have a studio underneath or above the stage that if not being used for storage these days can be used for rehearsals. Some set pieces will make their way into the studio rehearsals.  Also remember most Broadway shows are workshopped in other cities before coming to NYC. Seattle and Portland actually being the most popular workshop cities at the moment. They will rehearse in a studio or in the theater there before a small run or closed performances before coming to NYC.
Broadway,35hhm9,Brnny202,1 point,Sun May 10 15:40:54 2015 UTC,"Rehearse in a studio till the actors get their bit right (lines, blocking, choreography), then move into the theatre to add the technical aspects (lighting, sound etc). The stage plan is marked on the floor, and some elements may be put into the rehearsal space to make it ""work"" better, say having a raised rear platform for RENT.   EDIT: Should say this is all ""in general"". I have known shows have the sound design created in full in the rehearsal room for instance."
Broadway,35hhm9,FireFingers1992,1 point,Sun May 10 23:53:32 2015 UTC,"It depends entirely on the show, but getting into specifics:   The current in vogue place to rehearse a broadway show is at the New 42nd Street Studios, just off of times square - http://www.new42studios.org/  Usually the production will rent out the entire studio the entire length of their stay in the rehearsal hall (so that no other companies use it, for example) and will often move in versions of all the furniture, props, and scenic elements in the show.  Scenery that isn't interacted with isn't represented - but furniture always is.    Unless it's a specific item that is unique or needs to be worked with, something that is similar but not the show prop will be used in the hall.  Most broadway stages are surprisingly small, most of those theaters are almost 100 years old, so the whole stage footprint can often fit into most rehearsal rooms (and rehearsal rooms that don't fit the whole stage wouldn't be used).  Even big dance shows with full ballet numbers rehearse in these spaces.  Usually before a show moves into the theater the show is completely staged and choreographed and there are several run-throughs of the show (for producers, invited guests, designers, etc.) so that it can go in as hassle free as possible in the theater.  As others have said, being in the actual broadway theater is insanely expensive.  Part of this is because the union stipulates crew minimums, depending on the type of rehearsal - but the other part is that broadway theaters are complex places, and usually during the course of the rehearsals leading up to tech in the theater, the show is getting loaded in and installed into the space.  So rehearsing on stage would mean pausing work on stage, or paying overtime to rehearse in an off-time of load-in.  Depending on the show, some understudy rehearsals can happen on stage (usually with plays or unit sets) where it makes the most sense to have the people interacting with the actual set, but these rehearsals are usually without lighting, sound, costumes, props - etc.  Its basically an empty stage that serves the place of a rehearsal room."

Broadway,35f54m,JohnMiltonJamesJoyce,6,Sat May 9 19:19:04 2015 UTC,"I saw it last week. Gorgeous costumes. Beautiful score. Great singing. The book (which I was not familiar having never seen the film or read the book) was VERY difficult to follow and VERY dark. It was a very depressing show -- from start to finish. I still don't quite know what happened or what it was about, for the most part. Yah, I got some of it, but I couldn't describe in one sentence what it was about. During Act II, I started thinking of all the shows I have seen that had darker/heavy story lines -- and even Les Mis provided some comic relief (i.e. the innkeepers) to keep things light on occasion. I just couldn't recommend this show to anyone. And that's a bad sign in theater. (But this is just my opinion. I do know some people who liked it.)"
Broadway,35f54m,OrnaMint,2,Sat May 9 20:15:14 2015 UTC,"I really like the book, so maybe thats it. It also deals with a lot of themes that fascinate me"

That show just didn't work for me. I live in San Francisco and just returned from an 8-day trip to NYC and saw 11 shows. (2 were Off-Broadway.)  DZ was my least-liked by a long shot. I just found myself completely bored during the show. I met some people sitting around me -- all New Yorkers and the feeling was mutual amongst everyone. So I figured the show wasn't going to last very long. When I arrived home, the news broke that it was indeed closing.  I think this show will have a hard time having a life beyond today. I just can't see community or regional theaters doing it. I don't see high schools doing it. If given the chance,  I might consider seeing it again -- just to see if there was something missing that I just didn't get the first time. I'm glad you enjoyed it though. It did seem to have some die-hard fans. :)"
Broadway,35f54m,OrnaMint,4,Sun May 10 07:00:45 2015 UTC,"I thought it was awful. The cast was great but the book was horrible and I never cared about any of the characters except for Zhivago's wife. The music was beautiful but nothing we haven't heard before. There were a couple of times I thought I'd heard the song before. Isn't this from Jekyll and Hyde? Isn't this from The Secret Garden?  The set was awful. I'm very big on sets and it was just relied heavily on unnecessary projections. The one with Lara turning while Zhivago sings had my entire section chuckling. Also, the ice palace was a huge moment in the movie so that should have been absolutely brilliant but, as I read in a review, it seemed like leftover sketches from Frozen.   Also, the second act is waaay too violent. I know it's the revolution, but you don't need to show a woman slicing open her throat or point blank headshots to convey that there was a revolution going on.   In Les Miz, they included a bit more comedy (Thenardiers throughout the show) and besides for the brief lighthearted song in the very beginning where they had the russian style dancing, there was nowhere for the audience to take a breather.   Now I am a Russian history buff. I have read about 7 books on the Romanovs from Peter the Great to the last Czar Nicholas II and his family. I knew this story and was excited because I wanted to love it. I even had friends working on the show and I was hoping the best for them, but this show just had too much. I just felt awful for Zhivago's wife.   As the weeks went by during previews and it finally opened, I was coming across more people who saw it. More than just a few said they fell asleep. That's not a good sign.   I'm glad you liked it and hopefully they will make an album because some of those songs were noteworthy, but I have to say I agreed with the critics. When I saw they notices I thought ""yea, they nailed it on the head."""

Broadway,358pwa,Jonnyg42,2,Fri May 8 02:17:16 2015 UTC,"With or without Idina this was an incredible show. I saw it without her. I actually feel her involvement might have been part of its failure, because the show attracted Rentheads and Wicked and Frozen fans, and If/Then was nothing at all like any of those. And she was a headliner. I don't think it would have been as bad if she show hadn't been marketed with her as the sole selling point. I'm not an Idina Menzel fan, I saw the show for the show, and I absolutely loved it. It wasn't just Idina (I saw Jackie Burns, who was fantastic), it was the whole cast and the whole show. At times the staging got a little confusing, but I liked it very much.  I feel like If/Then was the latest incarnation of Allegro/Merrily We Roll Along, and in a decade we'll be looking back at it and seeing exactly what went wrong, and then some new show will try to fix it, but then something else will go wrong, and then that'll be a failure, and we'll never get to see a musical about people reflecting on how dramatically they've screwed up their lives be successful in its own time."
Broadway,358pwa,Yoyti,4,Fri May 8 03:35:31 2015 UTC,"Idina carrying the show is interesting because it seems to have both helped and harmed the show. On the one hand, it's quite probable that a less-than-great show would not have survived as long as it did without her star power. (When I saw it, the general feeling on the audience during intermission seemed to be ""What the hell is going on? Why am I watching this? Is this interesting or just confusing"") At the same time, though, her star power drew in a crowd that wasn't necessarily the target demographic, which didn't do much for creating a fan base and audience."
Broadway,358pwa,BU_Rob13,2,Fri May 8 04:07:27 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the show had some serious flaws.  It's hard to get tourists to a show that's very much an ode to a city they don't live in. Tourists aren't going to be very interested in any of the city planning stuff, nor will they have any connection with songs like ""Ain't No Man Manhattan"".  The narrative took some weird turns that made it feel very ... forced. Without spoiling anything, during ""The Moment Explodes"", I felt the story had gone completely off the tracks.  Lastly, the score just wasn't that exciting. The great songs were ""What If?"" and ""Always Starting Over"". The good songs were ""You Never Know"", ""What the Fuck?"", ""Surprise"", ""Hey, Kid"", ""Some Other Me"", and ""I Hate You"". Everything else seemed uninspired - especially songs like ""The Moment Explodes"" and ""It's a Sign"". Even the good songs weren't anything better than standard Broadway fare, and with so many dull and tedious songs between them, I just was never very excited for the music.  I personally had no difficulty following the staging. They used lighting tricks and the glasses to make it somewhat clear whether Liz or Beth was on the stage. This wasn't obvious to everyone, but I think we can chalk it up to people not paying attention early on. For instance, I had a friend who was baffled by this musical, but when I pointed out the glasses, she apparently had missed the dialogue early on that made it obvious which Elizabeth wore glasses. That's kind of on her, not the show, in my opinion."
Broadway,358pwa,Yoyti,2,Sat May 9 18:09:06 2015 UTC,"Why does it have to pander to tourists? There's Lion King and Phantom and Chicago and Wicked for that. I have nothing against highly commercial shows, but not every show needs to have the same target audience. And Company is just as much an ode to New York City, and is highly regarded even outside the city! And before you tell me that while Company praises NYC, that's not the point of the musical, well, New York isn't the point of If/Then either.  I felt the score was great. The only song I didn't like was It's A Sign. Some Other Me felt a little forced into the show (like they were trying to say ""just in case anyone didn't get the whole premise of this show halfway through act two...""), but the song itself I liked. Also wasn't a huge fan of Ain't No Man Manhattan. The score in general I think held up quite nicely. Certainly I think it's a step up from Next To Normal. If any significant improvement could be made, maybe a couple of songs could do with cutting a verse.  As far as the narrative, remember that the Beth timeline is Liz hypothesizing what would have happened if she'd went with Lucas, and the Liz timeline is Beth hypothesizing the reverse. The narrative turns are there because Elizabeth has to bring herself home. (To that end, I did not like the final scene, and think it should have just ended after Always Starting Over -- perhaps rewriting Always Starting Over such that it covers Liz and Beth both.) The Moment Explodes was, I thought, wonderfully executed, taking in the whole song, scene, and context. It seems ridiculous because it's one of those things you think will never happen to you, but that's what everyone thinks, and then it happens. Similarly with I Hate You. The two are parallel songs in the two timelines. Yes, these are crazy things that the audience never could have predicted, but these are things that do happen, and this is where Elizabeth's crazy hypothesizing brain takes her. I'm sure anyone in the audience with a crazy hypothesizing brain could relate."

I don't see any shows booked in any of those places at the end of November, but you can check it out when your trip gets closer.  There are also a lot of options for locally-produced works.  If you don't get a chance to see a show, you might want to check out the tours of the Winspear.

Broadway,34jr7d,ggl,5,Fri May 1 19:16:51 2015 UTC,"If they say partial viewing, they mean just that - you will not be able to see the entire stage. Sometimes the partial viewing means you're just missing a few feet of the left side of the stage. Sometimes it means you're sitting behind a pillar. Only way to know for sure is to ask the box office.   And here's some copypasta I leave everywhere on this page when someone mentions wanting to see a megahit:   The longer a show is on Broadway, the worse it tends to get. Ensemble members get lax, new cast members' styles don't mesh with old ones, the band loses its luster and discipline. Some of the people you're seeing/hearing have been doing that exact show eight days a week for 10+ years, and their energy has gone from ""I'm on Broadway"" to ""ugh, this goddamn song again."" For a big hit show that's been running several years, you're almost always better off seeing the national/international tours, they tend to be better maintained and fresher. If you're seeing a show on Broadway, a new show or recent hit (under 3 years) will almost always guarantee both a cheaper ticket and a more lively, engaging experience.   Source: I work in the industry and you won't believe the stories I've heard from the long-running shows."
Broadway,34jr7d,thesweetestpunch,5,Fri May 1 20:08:07 2015 UTC,"I saw Wicked about a month ago for the first time on Broadway since I was 13. Ten years later and it was still absolutely magical. So the cast has done it before... Most of them haven't been doing it since it opened, and it is still their job to make it great for the audience. I saw Lilli Cooper as Elphaba (she's the standby), and I was SUPER IMPRESSED.   I get what you're saying (I had a seriously lackluster experience at Phantom in '09), but as someone who recently saw Wicked I just wanted to chime in with the other side of things."
Broadway,34jr7d,broadwaybaby616,-1,Fri May 1 20:37:31 2015 UTC,"Ensemble and band have the option to remain indefinitely with the show, so while the leads may be fresh, all the people doing the rest of the work on the show can be a whole mixture of things. I saw it about a year and a half ago and while all the individual actors were doing great work, the whole show seemed out of balance and it felt like there were a lot of excellent people who weren't on the same page. For most of them, their job isn't to make it great for the audience - it's to get through their track without doing anything worth firing them for.   Also, the band was about 1/2 subs and the sound design had gotten pretty terrible; a friend in the orchestra pit told me that he was pretty sure they were just muting the woodwinds and strings because of how lackluster they were.   That said, yeah, everybody has their own experience and a lot of it comes down to your standards, the state of the show, and what the show means to you (and age - there are a lot of things I'd tolerate from a show I loved in my teens that now I just can't turn a blind eye to). Even with everything I said didn't work, I still had a great time because I was seeing Wicked. But for the amount of money I was spending, I probably could've had a much better time at two different musicals, with better seats. And if I'd just gone to see Wicked while it was touring some nearby city, I probably would've had a cheaper seat and a much better, more tight cast and band.   Edited for clarification."
Broadway,34jr7d,thesweetestpunch,5,Fri May 1 20:44:56 2015 UTC,Most of the ensemble members have contracts that last for the duration of the show   Ummmm no ensemble members are not contracted to stay with a show forever and get trapped in a hit show.  Ensemble members who stay with a show for years choose to do so.
Broadway,34jr7d,rozzingit,-1,Sat May 2 01:22:16 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand. Ensemble members (and band) have the OPTION to continue with the show indefinitely. Both AFM local 802 and AEA have a grace period on Bway shows where they are able to fire for any reason; after that ensemble and band require a clear trail and grounds for dismissal for firing to occur.   Ensemble members will still audition for other shows, but in a long-running show (in an unstable, competitive market) many choose to stick around year in and year out. Some chorus members have been in Chicago and Lion King for well over a decade!   But the reasons they choose to stick around are often ""I can't book a better gig"" or ""I'm afraid to leave this gig for another"", so the quality dips. Some shows get a really bad, lethargic culture near the end of their run (this happened to nearly all of the 80s megamusicals)."
Broadway,34jr7d,thesweetestpunch,2,Sat May 2 01:47:02 2015 UTC,"I saw Wicked a few weeks ago. I was somewhat skeptical; I tend to be very critical when it comes to musical theater (and I'm a music person primarily, so I pay very close attention to the orchestra), and I wasn't sure Wicked would live up to the hype.It definitely did. I was totally blown away. But when I saw Phantom (with Peter Joback, no less!), I found it somewhat lackluster.  I would guess that it's really that shows become less stable the longer they run. When I saw it, Wicked was very good. Maybe a few months ago, it wasn't nearly so. When you saw it, I guess it wasn't as good. I imagine it gets a pretty big jump up when large portions of the cast and company are replaced, so it's largely a new company. (The ensemble members and orchestra are not contracted to stay in a show forever. I don't know where you're getting that from.)"
Broadway,34jr7d,Yoyti,0,Sat May 2 01:33:06 2015 UTC,"They're not forced to stay in the show, but they have the option and management needs a real good reason to dismiss them; no ""we want to start fresh with a new ensemble and band"" unless they close the production and start a new one. It's like tenure."
Broadway,34jr7d,thesweetestpunch,4,Sat May 2 01:48:51 2015 UTC,"The advice at the end of this post is unfair and misleading.  Yes shows tend to age - they don't look as sparkly and they don't look as fresh, but to pretend that things get intentionally worse during a long running show is ridiculous.    All of these mega shows have resident directors who see the show and give notes, they have music directors who ensure that it all sounds up to scratch, and they have dance captains who maintain the choreography through the show, especially with new ensemble members.  This might've been more a problem 10 years ago, but Broadway has increasingly been turned into a collection of different brands (directors, composers, designers, playwrights, etc).  All of those people are invested in the show and it's upkeep (because of both art and the royalty check).  I saw Wicked for the second time nearly 10 years after I saw it originally (2004 and 2014) and while the show feels a little dated from a spectacle standpoint - I was still as into the show and the performances.  If the band is 1/2 subs and the subs are not great, that sounds more like a problem with the music department.  These shows are mega businesses and are treated as such.  Not every show takes its tenure as seriously and sometimes perfect situations arise where all the swings are on and half the band is on vacation, and the understudies are on for both the leads.  Source: I'm also ""in the industry"".  Edit:  Not posting this to criticize, and I'm sure your points 100% valid - just wanted to offer a differing opinion."
Broadway,34jr7d,notacrook,0,Sat May 2 20:38:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that shows like Mormon and Wicked are tighter ships than the Euro musicals were - a friend I mine has been with Mormon for two years and they still ride him and the team pretty hard.   Even if the production is totally pro, though, it's simply impossible to stay totally engaged and invested in a show you've been doing in the same theatre for YEARS.   I've just never as an adult been able to justify the expense of a hit show. Even if the band is still on point, they're playing the same notes that they've played 800 times before. They might still be tight, but they won't be fresh. They'll be faking the freshness."

I've just never as an adult been able to justify the expense of a hit show.   Me either.  But it's a hazard that comes with being in the industry.

I've seen Rebecca with JCM and with Darren, and while I loved Lena Hall to pieces, I like Rebecca's take on Yitzhak a lot too. There are enough differences for her to make it her own, and her voice is fantastic."

I, too, have been slightly skeptical since they announced the casting, but word of mouth has been good so far (especially considering who he's succeeding), so I'm sort of in the middle right now, but veering towards excited — especially because I've been dying to see Rebecca, and it's been a few months since I've seen the show and I've missed it. I'll be sure to report back!"
Broadway,34elfs,missfarin,2,Fri May 1 12:58:56 2015 UTC,"Okay, just got back from seeing Darren. I thought he was good and that he'll grow into the role as he settles into his run. Like /u/crashboom said, he does particularly well on the punk rock numbers – his renditions of Angry Inch, Wig in a Box, and Origin of Love were particularly great. His Hedwig/Tommy scenes were also really lovely and definitely the part of the story he connected to most strongly. I feel like he needs to settle into Hedwig's physicality and femininity a bit more, and that he needs to take a little more time to let the jokes really land (but that's more down to him getting used to having a real audience). But he's definitely embracing the ""organized chaos"" that is the show: he fell off the chair when he climbed up for the carwash during Sugar Daddy and ended up pretty much humping the guy's face instead before dancing back down the aisle.  Rebecca, who I was most excited to see, was absolutely fantastic! Her Yitz is a lot surlier and more sullen than Lena Hall, but there were some really sweet moments with Darren, too. And her Long Grift gave me chills.   The show also continues to hold up beautifully. I can't wait to see who they get for the next Hedwig!"
Broadway,34elfs,missfarin,2,Sun May 3 03:25:27 2015 UTC,"Glad you liked it!  Funnily enough, I saw him a second time today at the matinee, unplanned... a friend of mine won lottery and texted me asking if I wanted to come, so I figured what the hell! Even though it was only his fourth performance, I thought he'd already settled down noticeably into the role and changed a few things (for the better) with his delivery, so I think it'll continue to improve. I agree he pushes some jokes too hard instead of letting them just roll off, but again I noticed he had pulled back with that compared to opening night so it'll get there. Also, his Origin of Love was bounds better this time around and I think Wig in a Box may be his best vocal. I love it.  I love Rebecca. I was standing outside the theater talking with friends after and she walked by, I blurted out ""You're amazing!"" and she was so sweet and lovely. Stepping into that role after Lena Hall is almost if not equally intimidating to Darren following JCM's footsteps, and I give her kudos to making it her own rather than doing a carbon copy of Lena's."
Broadway,34elfs,crashboom,2,Sun May 3 03:34:00 2015 UTC,"That's great to hear! I could tell a lot of it has to do with him getting used to the rhythm of the show, the audience, etc. I'd be curious to see him later in the run.   And I completely agree about Rebecca. I really love what she's doing with the role and that it's so different from Lena. I hope she stays for a stretch."

Even folks that have praised the show, and off conversations/comments on broadway.com vlogs and articles never really pointed to any one performance being amazingly stand out. I think even you said that Matt Morrison's role was a little too ""safe"" for him and from what I've seen on the vlog and official show clips, and tv performances I totally think that's a fair call. He seems more like a root for the ensemble to play off off instead of a leader the ensemble follows/reacts to. It's tough when you have so many kids involved in a show."

So secret they've sent nominators home in separate town cars in the past. It just turns out some shows aren't enjoyed. That's life.   Not saying people weren't left out or anything (I don't personally care), but no one was ""snubbed,"" it's a misconception."

Broadway,345d81,katiekilobyte,3,Wed May 13 06:29:02 2015 UTC,Featured Actress in a Musical is so on point this year.
Broadway,345d81,notacrook,3,Tue Apr 28 18:35:21 2015 UTC,"Re - Finding Neverland:  I have no proof, or inside info and it's just my own PURE SPECULATION/biased opinion from years of trying to read between the lines - Tony committee voters seem to really take off LOTS of points and give very little credit to shows with featured kids because talent/them being there just because they are a somewhat talented kid tends to be a tough call.  I feel like Matilda for example, worked around that by having extremely outstanding performances by the adult cast members to pull the weight (edit: not that Matilda didn't have it's own exp with snubs too of course), and made it more of a (in the head of a nominator or critic) ""well yes this is a kid friendly show and there's lot's of kids, but the show wouldn't have a leg to stand on beyond just being a kids singing /dancing chorus without these amazing adult characters and their outstanding performances."" From what I've read and heard of Neverland, the lines are blurred a lot more in that sense, and not to mention the balance between the songs and the 'play' seems rough at best even coming from its highest praisers.   Laura's latest vlog seemed to indicate the cast was aware , maybe not of a total snubbing, but to not set their expectations very high. It's sad though, for the actors. Broadway is a tough critic in itself (just general public, non critics/non nominators) and the show is doing pretty well box office wise, and is filled with talent, but the execution of the show as a totality and the story's history have worked against it.  I am looking at it currently a lot like Honeymoon in Vegas. If they had made it ""loosely based on, or inspired by"" instead of a true stage adaptation, I think it would've fared much better. To me if you're having trouble with meshing the songs and play elements in a fluid way, the root of the story you're telling needs changes, and the more changes you make, the less faithful it is as a true adaptation.  I'm thinking here also of ""Love Never Dies."" To me, if it had been able to get out from under the coattails of Phantom (not that I even pretend to know how that would be possible), not been called a sequel, and been presented as more of just, a new story, in a similar fantasy world, it could've done a lot better (and I don't mean as it was because that's contradictory), but in that it would've allowed for more dramatic changes in the book itself, granted you could see it and ""get it"" without knowing anything about Phantom (though that's kind of like watching the Harry Potter movies and never having read the books, I dunno how the story would have a grip on you and you wouldn't be super confused).   I just think ""New, and somewhat similar"" fares much better on Broadway than ""Riding the coattails of, and pretty much the same thing as, or continuation of."" :)"
Broadway,345d81,LadiesWhoPunch,12,Tue Apr 28 15:20:29 2015 UTC,What about Fun Home though? That should has featured children in it and it's tied for the most nominations.
Broadway,345d81,katiekilobyte,8,Tue Apr 28 15:23:53 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the kids in that show out performed the rest of the cast (and not in the bad kind of way).

Broadway,34498d,xoarar,3,Tue Apr 28 05:23:19 2015 UTC,"Saw it 2 years ago with Oona as Matilda and the rest of the OBC, and it was incredible. We were lucky enough to get cancellation producers' seats, so we had a perfect front-on view from the mezz, but everything from the story to the songs to the amazing set were brilliant. It's coming to Australia (albeit with the touring set - no popup tables for us), but I'll happily go see it again, and the soundtrack gets a play on long drives quite regularly."
Broadway,34498d,alivesince1985,5,Tue Apr 28 05:04:18 2015 UTC,"I saw it twice and adored it.

Broadway,345g4f,notacrook,10,Tue Apr 28 13:25:01 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree with this.  All three of the shows you mention were so superior to Finding Neverland in many ways.  Of course all of this is just my opinion, and you're free to have your own - but saying things are ""awful"" just because you didn't like it is unfair.  Finding Neverland was messy storytelling.  There were some truly beautiful moments, and there were moments that I thought were not only underwhelming - I just didn't care.  Yes politics gets involved at some level - but this isn't the Oscars.  There aren't any ""for your consideration"" ads in playbill."
Broadway,345g4f,notacrook,-14,Tue Apr 28 14:49:26 2015 UTC,There is no opinion involved here. THE VISIT was a bad show that is given recognition simply because the theatre community still feels the need  to bow to its legends and not be honest with them.
Broadway,345g4f,notacrook,8,Tue Apr 28 15:45:54 2015 UTC,"Chita might've been a reason the show bowed on Broadway, but she isn't solely what makes it good, bad, or otherwise.  It's a Kander and Ebb with a strong previous production pedigree helmed by an acclaimed director.  Chita didn't make it bad, and she didn't make it good - but I sure as shit saw it to see her on stage (and I'm also a John Doyle fan - who also isn't nominated but should be).  And by the way, all of this is opinion.  What makes a show good or bad? Opinion.  Just because I thought a show was moving and gorgeous and you thought it was a generic wreck doesn't make it bad or good.  That's impossible to quantify (at the very least impossible with the shows you keep defending)."
Broadway,345g4f,rocksplash,7,Tue Apr 28 16:10:43 2015 UTC,"David Cote of Time Out summed it up best, I think:   Harvey Weinstein snubbed—or was he? The widely panned Peter Pan musical Finding Neverland did not receive a single Tony nomination, which some have seen as a defiant gesture toward the show’s producer, Hollywood superpower Harvey Weinstein. And yes, Weinstein has made a lot of clumsy missteps in his dealings with the Broadway community. But the truth is that Finding Neverland just isn’t very good, and in a year with so much competition—ten original musicals, plus five revivals—it was roundly outclassed. Finding Neverland didn’t need to be snubbed: It earned its lack of recognition."
Broadway,345g4f,notacrook,5,Tue Apr 28 18:29:33 2015 UTC,"Finding Neverland is overwhelmingly commercial and simplistic. It's a patchwork of disparate ideas and themes, and doesn't work well as a whole. There are a number of good performances, but it's got a forgettable score and appalling choreography, and is a big poppy musical based on a small, intimate movie.  I think it could have worked if it had been less anachronistic, and wasn't so blatantly trying to be the next Wicked. Which, incidentally, is also terrible."
Broadway,345g4f,sound2503,-12,Tue Apr 28 15:30:59 2015 UTC,I'm not even going to grace that reply with a well-thought-out response. Wicked is terrible? OK. Let's see you bring a multibillion dollar musical to the table. Then you can talk. Why do you think it's trying to be Wicked? It's nothing like Wicked.

The prices for orchestra seats look pretty good.   The thing to know about todaytix: rather than email you tickets or having you pick them up at box office, they have a concierge (in a red vest) show up outside the theatre thirty minutes before showtime to hand-deliver.

Broadway,34200n,zac850,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:22:11 2015 UTC,"Here's how it works  Shows put out various discount codes in various places in order to entire people to buy tickets. Usually a show will alternate where they put discounts to avoid over saturating a certain outlet. So for instance, I might offer a discount this month to the Playbill Club, next month to Broadway Box, the month after that to Telecharge, and so on.  TodayTix knows where to look for discounts and what price the discount gives in each area. You click buy and TodayTix sends someone to the theater box office to buy the tickets. They'll then meet you at the theater with your tickets before the show. I think people actually now just give TodayTix their own code at whatever the best public discount is, so TodayTix doesn't start skewing code tracking.  So they're not doing anything you couldn't do for yourself if you knew where to look for discount codes, but for (I think) $5 a ticket service fee, it's a decent deal."

Broadway,33nxde,Yoyti,4,Fri Apr 24 01:43:06 2015 UTC,"Rodgers and Hammerstein are a good place to start. My favorites are Carousel and South Pacific. The King And I, Cinderella, The Sound Of Music, and Oklahoma also have movies you can watch. Just make sure you're watching the original Cinderella with Julie Andrews.  Then there's Lerner and Loewe. My Fair Lady is a classic. Also Camelot, Brigadoon, and Gigi.  Then to go a little later, West Side Story, which has a very good movie adaptation. So does Gypsy.  Stepping fully into Sondheim, there are OBC video recordings of his three collaborations with James Lapine. Sunday In The Park With George, Into The Woods, and Passion. Those and the 1981 video of Sweeney Todd with George Hearn would be the best place to start with Sondheim, since opinions on film adaptations of his musicals are very divided. There's also a terrific production of A Little Night Music from 1990 from the NYCO that you can find on youtube. All things considered, A Little Night Music might actually be the best place to start with Sondheim."
Broadway,33nxde,Irishman318,1 point,Fri Apr 24 10:45:28 2015 UTC,"Of all those, I personally wouldn't bother with Passion. It's ideas and themes are done better in other works, plus the music is rather erratic and all over the place, dragged down by some lazy lyric writing.  If you feel the need for dissonance and semi-opera, go ahead, you might enjoy it. It's by no means a horrible show, but it's probably the weakest of his works."
Broadway,33nxde,Yoyti,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:07:46 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The music is terrific. The style of Passion evokes the romantic Italian operas of Puccini, like La Boheme or Manon Lescaut, and does so perfectly. All of Sondheim's works are distinctly in their own style. If you don't like whimsical comedies, you probably won't like Forum. If you don't like light operetta, you probably won't like A Little Night Music. If you don't like Italian opera, you probably won't like Passion. What I don't like about Passion is how much I want to yell at the characters, but the music is gorgeous, and I'll take it over Forum any day."
Broadway,33nxde,Irishman318,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:17:16 2015 UTC,"I was going to say Sweeney for the light operetta style, but that works too.  And, yeah, the characters aren't very likeable. Not sure if that was the purpose or whatnot, but I knew there was something I left out."
Broadway,33nxde,Yoyti,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:41:39 2015 UTC,"Sondheim said that he feels the reason Passion was a flop is that people found the characters too relatable, and that the audience was uncomfortable sympathizing with a character like Fosca. Of course, it just takes one look at the success of The Phantom Of The Opera to see that audiences have no trouble sympathizing with a monster, and Fosca is much less of one than the Phantom (mostly on account of the fact that she doesn't abduct or murder anyone). It's probably the reason Assassins didn't really take off, though.  I can forgive Fosca's behavior from a spectator's point of view. She's had one experience with love that didn't go well, and has been cooped up sick ever since. Her mental instability is, if not relatable, at least understandable. It's mostly that Giorgio is a horribly naive idiot that annoys me."
Broadway,33nxde,Irishman318,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:55:49 2015 UTC,"That's probably why Beauty & The Beast is more well known and more universally loved, because they can also empathize more with the Beast, despite how basic his reasons for being turned are.  I dunno, I could be some charlatan for my opinion, but I think Beauty did it better than Passion."

Broadway,33nxde,roonerhasit,2,Fri Apr 24 02:59:41 2015 UTC,"I second that Dogfight recommendation. It's probably one of the best shows that I've ever seen - live OR bootlegged. On a similar vein, There are a few videos of various productions of Parade available online.  Rodgers and Hammerstein is essential when exploring the theatre world. The Sound of Music and The King and I are my fave R&H shows, but Cinderella is also wonderful. My favorite ""Golden Age"" (pre-1970) show is Fiddler on the Roof, and I know the movie is on YouTube and is very close to the actual stage script. Another older show that you should look out for is Gypsy. I also recommend A Chorus Line… I managed to find a video of the Original Cast from 1975 on YouTube and it may still be out there! If you want something a little lighter, try looking for something along the lines of Newsies or the 2007 Grease revival. Neither are spectacular, but they're fun and entertaining, and both have fantastic casts.   I'm not big on Sondheim, but I'd try looking for Into the Woods before Sweeney or any of his other works.  **EDIT: I would like to add that, while I've watched many videos in my day, I usually don't watch them unless it's a production I've already seen or a cast/show that is no longer running. I recommend finding shows that don't have productions currently touring the country or running in your area because seeing something live is always a better experience!"

(all 3 won tony for best musical). Rent is a classic you should know. As is a chorus line. Recent faves newsies, matilda, fun home. Checkout sondheim and rogers and Hammerstein.

Broadway,3337c4,Actorperson,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:17:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, but the question still stands.  I am wondering about actual Equity Principal Auditions.  Obviously these actors have done enough to get into the union, but may not have an agent that is strong enough to get them into a scheduled audition, or no agent at all.  Thus, they go to open calls.  I doubt if Equity has any records, and they probably wouldn't let it out if they did, not wanting to admit that it might be easier to win the lottery.  So this is an informal attempt to find out if they are a TOTAL waste of time.  I suspect that some of the smaller regional and summer stock theatres that SEND A DIRECTOR to NY to cast will actually hire someone from an EPA, but not Broadway or the bigger name theatres that are forced to have them by Equity rules.  Anyone?"
Broadway,3337c4,spoonfedkyle,-2,Wed May 6 20:44:10 2015 UTC,"I work in casting. Its not a total waste of time, but from a casting stand point unless someone really blows you away with something that isn't commonly seen by represented actors, there is no logical reason to see them again. For example, I worked an EPA a few months ago for well acclaimed broadway show. We saw 460 people across the day. 50% are fan boys/girls of the show or people that have no business being there. 20% are current students in training programs that are there for ""experience"". 20% are people who have no training (or worse couldn't get into training programs) and aren't particularly talented. The last 10% are people who are trained/talented and just don't have representation for one reason or another. For this particular EPA we called back 8 people. However, four of those eight we cast in our production."
Broadway,3337c4,scrambledbrain,6,Sun Apr 19 03:21:06 2015 UTC,"Your audition doesn't really sound like an EPA. 460 people in one day -- that would be over 60 people an hour. Maybe you had an open call?  Equity Principal auditions are not open to the general public. Fan boys, no-talents, no-training, students ... these folks only get into an EPA if the producers want to see non-union people, and time permits. Equity cards, while not necessarily the bold indication of skill, aren't given away to just anyone who wants one. You need to either work enough to earn it or get cast in something that provides it.  And in my experience (nearly 20 years on the casting side of musical theater from Broadway to summer stock to regional to cruise ships) -- there's enough casting from EPAs for them to be worth it. Obviously, more people come from submissions and targeted appointments, but for the qualified and talented, an EPA is one of many ways to get a strong foot in the door."
Broadway,3337c4,spoonfedkyle,1 point,Sun Apr 19 04:56:43 2015 UTC,You're absolutely right. I get them mixed up all the time. Disregard what I said.
Broadway,3337c4,scrambledbrain,3,Sun Apr 19 05:14:58 2015 UTC,"Well, regarding open calls -- yes, THOSE are usually a waste of time. Unfortunately, in the non-union world, they're often the only option."

Broadway,32vh4v,321crayonsarefun,3,Fri Apr 17 01:23:32 2015 UTC,"Matilda is significantly cheaper than most shows, you should also be able to find discount rates. I keep getting an ad on Facebook for 45% off, I've never clicked through though.  Matilda is cute, really cute. It's got a decent amount of humor and the special effects are really well done. It's a decently great show, but it is also missing that amazing wow factor that so many Broadway shows have. There's a reason it's not as expensive as Wicked, but at the same time it's really cute and enjoyable - and quite possibly the perfect amount of wow for kids."
Broadway,32vh4v,rachycarebear,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:51:10 2015 UTC,I would second Matilda. Try out the lottery before the show if you want really cheap tickets. The lottery is significantly less busy than some of the other shows.

It felt like a very tired production that was way too small for the massive space it has. The music doesn't suit the production and really doesn't aid or progress the story in any way, and it deserves to be a lot more of an intimate show. The set is great, but that's about it - and I hate being negative about shows, especially new ones. :("
Broadway,32j3ng,bicureyooz,6,Tue Apr 14 04:55:51 2015 UTC,I've seen Stephanie J. Block on Broadway twice (9 to 5 and Drood).  Phenomenal.  Always very nice at the stage door too.
Broadway,32j3ng,adamshell,2,Tue Apr 14 06:13:12 2015 UTC,Always very nice at the stage door too.   Have you ever seen Idina Menzel at stage door? Is that a contrast to her behavior?
Broadway,32j3ng,rachycarebear,2,Wed Apr 15 22:23:27 2015 UTC,"I saw Idina Menzel after If/Then, but I don't think I got any autograph from her or anything.  The door was just completely mobbed since it was right in the middle of the Frozen / Oscar hype.  She didn't really have a chance to be exceptionally affable or nasty either way, there were just too many people.  The few interactions that I did see were nice.  It was the second or third busiest stage door I had ever been to (Ricky Martin and James Franco were the only two that compared).  I didn't mean to indicate that she was unpleasant, just that Stephanie J. Block was really nice for someone who headlines shows.  Lots of times you'll see the stars stay inside after matinees or just go out another exit or something but that's never been the case with Block."
Broadway,32j3ng,adamshell,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:47:23 2015 UTC,"I stayed after If/Then and she was very stand-offish. I've always wondered if I just saw her on an off-day for her (this was also right after the Oscars, so it was a madhouse) or if she's just like that at the stage door.  I've never seen Stephanie J. Block, so I don't have what to compare it to."
Broadway,32j3ng,rachycarebear,2,Thu Apr 16 04:35:20 2015 UTC,"It's gotta be tough for them.  The vast majority of the time stars come out and give autographs. The few times that hasn't happened was usually due to weather or extremely large crowds. Quite frankly, I don't blame them.  I've never feared for my life more than when I faced a stampede of women young and old chasing Ricky Martin down the street in his car.  That's not an exaggeration either, I felt like I was going to be trampled.  But when the crowd dissipated Michael Cerveris came out and had a 5-10 minute conversation with me.  It was great!"
Broadway,32j3ng,adamshell,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:42:43 2015 UTC,"Almost no one came out when I saw Matilda this year because it was something like 7 degrees outside. There are barricades out, which does seem to help with the large-ish crowds, and I've met a few stars who seem to be genuinely appreciative of the fact that you came out to support their show (generally more likely to happen on smaller/less popular shows). Most also seem to interact to people somewhat - thank you to compliments, quick commentary on the show, etc. It's one of my favorite parts of going to a show.  The other big issues with If/Then signings being so close to the Oscars was that other people came out (LaChanze, Anthony Rapp, etc) and a good portion of the crowd didn't know or care who they were, which I imagine was about as unfun for them as it was for us."
Broadway,32j3ng,rachycarebear,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:15:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know what you mean.  A lot of times what will happen in situations like that is the headliner will come out, sign a few autographs, and either leave the theater or go back in.  Then the crowd will disperse and everyone else will come out for the people who care about the rest of the cast.  I really like that because it really allows for some good conversations.  The best is when you have a great ensemble cast of Broadway people (and no ""Hollywood"" celebrities... or at least people who don't really understand Broadway).  Newsies did this perfectly.  I'm convinced that that show reached 1,000+ performances because of their stage door presence."
Broadway,32j3ng,adamshell,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:51:56 2015 UTC,"I loved what First Date did - you had to have a Playbill or a ticket, something that showed you attended the show, in order to get a signature from Zachary Levi. They announced that right after the show and a good portion of people left so that when the rest of the cast came out, everyone who was there appreciated them, chatted with them, knew who they were. It's one of my favorite stage door memories.  Newsies was really nice, too. I saw it on Kara Lindsay's last day so a lot of the cast was fairly emotional, but they really did a good job of interacting with everyone and whatnot."
Broadway,32j3ng,rachycarebear,1 point,Thu Apr 16 13:39:59 2015 UTC,I saw it three times on Broadway (Kara Lindsay once) and they were always really good.

It's just like going to the movies, in that there will be stuff that's perfect for you and stuff that in a million years you'd never enjoy. I think when people haven't seen a lot of theatre - especially at the NYC level - they think of it more as a theme park, ""let's go see the best show!"", not realizing just how subjective that is and how much the quality and experience varies from show to show.

Broadway,32ajca,manat23ee,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:39:36 2015 UTC,"I love varieties of music. West side story is a good example because it has a lot of fantastic music by Stephen Sondheim and its a beautiful story. I'm more into musicals and plays with catchy songs, and ones that are well thought through."
Broadway,32ajca,quizzical,2,Sun Apr 12 16:04:31 2015 UTC,"On the Town is by Bernstein, who composed West Side Story (NOT Stephen Sondheim - he did the lyrics :) ), but it's a very different type of show - similar ""modern New York"" musical energy but a much looser, more madcap, and less tuneful show.   Something Rotten is pretty much a perfect musical entertainment - frothy, fun, and with amazing staging (it's the same director as Aladdin, but with stronger material). Fun Home is much deeper and forward-thinking, and the buzz I've heard is nothing but raves.   Gentleman's Guide is...meh. I know a lot of people here swear by it but I and just about everyone I know found it smart, funny, and remarkably underwhelming, especially since it's an orchestral-style score being played by a chamber-sized pit. Don't even bother with the jukebox musicals (Mamma Mia, Jersey Boys, Beautiful) - you can see them in any town in the English-speaking world, and Beautiful is the only one worth writing home about.   The King and I is one of the greatest musicals ever written, but I haven't heard buzz about the current production so I can't speak to it - reviews will be coming out shortly if you keep your eyes peeled. On the 20th Century is a solid musical entertainment, from what I hear, but nobody's too excited about it.   Just avoid all the big ticket shows and you'll be fine. Book of Mormon is really the only one worth the price. Hamilton is awesome but impossible to get. Wicked, Chicago, Les Miz, Phantom, and Lion King are all shows that tour everywhere, will be around forever, and are just not worth spending your whole paycheck and trip on when you could see something unique to New York's theatre scene for a third of the price.   It's a shame Honeymoon in Vegas closed before you had a chance to see it - that was Stephen Sondheim's favorite show on Broadway this season."

Broadway,32ajca,misschae,3,Sun Apr 12 13:25:52 2015 UTC,"West side story will not be playing.   Right now the new musicals with the most buzz are Something Rotten and Fun Home. Those are the front-runners for best musical Tonys.   The front-runners for Best Revival are On the Town and The King and I.   On the Town is a great production with a beautiful orchestra and an ugly set.   Gentleman's Guide is alright, but definitely won best musical because it came out in a weak season. The ""big"" shows - phantom, wicked, Mormon, lion King, Chicago - are almost never worth the ticket prices which are often 2-3x the cost of any other show, and which attract much less well-behaved audiences."
Broadway,32ajca,smers,1 point,Sun Apr 12 13:30:58 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for the show that does the ""traditional Broadway musical"" the right way, I'd go to see On the Town.  It has the singing and the dancing and the sets that one should expect from Broadway.  Book of Mormon would also fit this mold if you don't mind spending the money and aren't offended by some crude humor.  Unlike /u/sanmateomary, I'd suggest you stay away from On the 20th Century.  The music is very opera-like, the dancing is shoehorned in, and the plot is just lacking in so many ways.  Kristin Chenoweth and Peter Gallagher are incredible, but unless you specifically want to see them, I'd avoid this.  If comedy is more your thing, then A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder is very eccentric.  The music is good and the plot is funny (borderline campy).  There's not much ensemble work, it mainly centers around 4 leads, and there isn't much dancing, but it's entertaining.  There are three very popular ""jukebox musicals"" out right now (musicals that predominately feature one musical group's music)-- Jersey Boys (Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons) and Mamma Mia (ABBA) and Beautiful (Carole King).  If you like any one of those groups / artists, those would be good bets.  Mamma Mia is leaving Broadway soon so this would likely be your last chance to see that.  If you just want to be blown away by spectacle, Aladdin's probably the way to go with that.  I haven't seen it, but Disney usually knows how to do that right.  There's another ""traditional"" musical out there now-- The King and I.  Others that might fit that kind of feeling would be An American in Paris and Finding Neverland.  And then there's the longstanding musicals like Wicked, Phantom of the Opera, Les Mis (Revival), Chicago.  There are other options.  Feel free to ask questions and I'll try to help you out."
Broadway,32ajca,sexualpotato,1 point,Sun Apr 12 08:35:44 2015 UTC,"Since I saw you were buying multiple tickets, consider joining the Playbill Club. They always have some great discounts for select shows.   http://www.playbill.com/club/offers  Not sure if the link will work since I'm on mobile but it's easy to find on the Playbill site.   My show suggestions: Wicked (if you haven't seen it on tour), On the Town, Aladdin, Beautiful, and Matilda. They're great for a first show and for families, especially if you or someone else seeing shows with you is younger. If age/subject matter isn't a concern (13 and older), I'd suggest Book of Mormon, Fun Home, or Hedwig and the Angry Inch.  Also, if you're there at the time and can get tickets, Hamilton opens this summer and it looks fantastic. It's getting a LOT of buzz."

For initial starting out, stoked, radio-blasting excitement: Book of Mormon, Rent, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Mamma Mia (last one is a toss up; you either love it or you hate it). Those are my top-volume, adrenaline, singalong songs. The stuff that just gets you going.   Once you're into a groove but not as high-energy, Les Miz, Phantom of the Opera, Wicked. These are more... Some singalongs, some ballads, some halfway between. They'll keep you up but aren't solidly bringing the high-emotions and needing-to-dance-along feelings.   When you're just cruising, that's what the new stuff is for. Add some stuff that you haven't heard that much (or at all) before. You're already trying to stay awake for the drive and if you've got a couple soundtracks ""on-deck"" that you've been meaning to check out, it's the perfect time. You're more open and likely to actually listen so it could bode well as far as staying cognizant AND finding parts that just speak to your soul.   And when you are really getting bored or sleepy and aren't even paying attention to the new stuff because you don't already know it, that's when you revert to step one to get yourself back in the right frame of mind.

Broadway,31tjhd,djup92,9,Wed Apr 8 01:18:36 2015 UTC,"Gentleman's is a fantastic show, it's very British humor (think Monty Python). The music isn't at all jazzy, it's very opera-like, similar to Phantom.  I'm curious what you mean by appropriate, because Book of Mormon is another show that's a favorite of mine, but it's highly offensive, being written by the guys behind South Park. It is, however, hilarious if you enjoy that offensive comedy.  Wicked is always a fan favorite as well, that's why it has done so well for so long."
Broadway,31tjhd,mrgilly94,2,Wed Apr 8 01:57:43 2015 UTC,I don't know that I'd say Book of Morman is offensive. The Mormon church pledged their support of it when it came out.
Broadway,31tjhd,spoonfedkyle,2,Wed Apr 8 23:03:54 2015 UTC,"In that respect, the BOM is one of the few pieces of media that even tries to paint Mormonism in a positive light. That's the biggest reason The Church likes it, it one of the few things that even tries to show their positive qualities.  The humor it utilizes is the same crass, offensive humor that people like South Park for. I have a couple friends who loved the soundtrack, but found the show itself mediocre because they didn't like that style of humor. So I would still argue that it's an offensive show, but that's to be expected by something written by Trey Parker and Matt Stone."
Broadway,31tjhd,mrgilly94,-5,Thu Apr 9 00:46:39 2015 UTC,"The music isn't at all jazzy, it's very opera-like, similar to Phantom.   Excuse me, Gentleman's Guide is not at all similar to Phantom. Phantom draws from rock sensibilities and romantic grand opera material. Think Verdi and Puccini. Gentleman's Guide draws from operetta, French and German, and, of course, English. Think Sullivan and Lehar.  Phantom parodies and pastiches opera. Gentleman's Guide lives in it. Both are terrific shows, but don't ever let me hear you try to compare them on the grounds of ""opera."" Opera is as varied an art form as musical theater. Honestly, they're really the same art form anyway. There's comic opera, tragic opera, opera in between. There's opera with spoken dialogue, opera with secco recitative, opera with accompanied recitative, opera with no recitative at all. Opera in regular modes and modulations, operas built chromatically. Operas about everyday people doing everyday things, operas about gods battling over the fate of the world.  So many operas. Some musicals draw directly from them. Rent from La Boheme, Miss Saigon from Madama Butterfly, Aida from Aida, and so on. Some are more distant. Rodgers wrote music in a classical style. Does that make his musicals more operatic? Who's to say? Sondheim's musicals tend toward the more musically unified, is that what makes a musical operatic? Is it Andrew Lloyd Webber's grandeur? No. In the end, opera is just another descriptor for certain subsets of musical theater. It's all on the same field. So does Gentleman's Guide draw some influence from some operas? Yes. Does Phantom? Yes. Does this mean that they are comparable shows by any stretch of the imagination? Most certainly not."

Broadway,31tjhd,Yoyti,2,Wed Apr 8 20:12:20 2015 UTC,"It did come off a bit intense, but nonetheless I'm impressed. Damn. =D  I agree too, it's a too often over..or accidentally (unaware-ly?) stated thing regarding Phantom, so I feel you on that. I'd personally describe Phantom as more aggressive Pop music inspired by opera, sung in a dramatic theatre style, yet non-operatic way - with Operatic motifs peppered in here and there.   And any correlation to Gentlemen's guide as far as relating it in a context of being non-traditionally 'Broadway' sounding....>>> ehhh...Gentlemen's is certainly closer to Broadway jazzy, sure not in the most traditional way and more modern, but it's very much there at least in regards to being more-so than phantom. Any similar leanings regarding Phantom are certainly at least to me, not even in the same universe :)"

I'd very loosely suggest : Book of Mormon, Wicked, Hedwig if you're looking for humor. Mama Mia! as well for comedy and being pop/rock based (Abba). Wicked has an amazing,deep story with some very feelings inducing moments but they are very quickly turned back to humor. Mormon and Wicked are both gonna infringe on that Broadway/jazzy vibe often but Wicked especially has very ""heavy"" guitar and rock style drum infused numbers."

Moreover, looking at the actors nominated that year-- Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells for Book of Mormon, Norbert for Catch Me, Joshua Henry for The Scottsboro Boys, and Tony Sheldon for Priscilla (though admittedly that one I don't quite get, I don't remember him at all from the show.

Broadway,31kxhb,spoilz,9,Mon Apr 6 01:40:51 2015 UTC,"No question, Fun Home.  Gentleman's guide is a fun, funny show with a so-so score that gets the job done and has one outstanding song, but most of the show is carried by one actor (Jefferson Mays). I think it won best show because of a weak season; in this season it wouldn't have stood a chance against Fun Home, Something Rotten, or Honeymoon in Vegas - all three of which are better shows with better scores, better sets, and better staging (but Honeymoon is closed).  Gentleman's Guide is a good enough show that gets the job done. Fun Home is a brilliant show that innovates and knocks you out. See Fun Home."
Broadway,31kxhb,thesweetestpunch,5,Mon Apr 6 04:26:20 2015 UTC,"Can't judge against Something Rotten, but I think Gentleman's Guide is a lot stronger than Honeymoon In Vegas. Honeymoon had a lot of bits that felt thrown in or random, and on the whole I think Gentleman's Guide held up better. Both of them were fluff, but Gentleman's Guide has a lot of substance too. A great example of how a comedy doesn't have to be frivolous. I was smiling during Honeymoon In Vegas, but Gentleman's Guide had me grinning like a madman.  And just one standout song? I've Decided To Marry You gets press just because that's the one they've decided to push. Poison In My Pocket, Poor Monty, Better With A Man, and Sibella all struck me as particularly good songs among the whole terrific score. The only song I felt was sub-par was Looking Down The Barrel Of A Gun."
Broadway,31kxhb,Yoyti,4,Mon Apr 6 15:51:34 2015 UTC,I decided on Fun Home. I'm really excited. Thanks to everyone who helped me pick. I'm going to try and add Gentlemen's Guide for my last day as a matinee. We'll see. But I got Fun Home for now since I keep hearing such great things.

Broadway,31kxhb,jabberwocky_,3,Mon Apr 6 11:36:33 2015 UTC,"I Decided To Marry You is IMO the outstanding song. The crowd receives it well, it plays into the farce of the show, and delivers hilarious plot points. Monty gets to show the audience just how clever, mad, and skilled he (the actor) is. The other songs just don't quite match this number."
Broadway,31kxhb,thesweetestpunch,1 point,Mon Apr 6 13:28:35 2015 UTC,"I've Decided to Marry You, the number from the Tony's. It's the only number that the audience whoops for."
Broadway,31kxhb,Yoyti,3,Mon Apr 6 15:40:37 2015 UTC,"I would say Gentleman's Guide. Yes, Gentleman's Guide is fluff, but it's fluff with a backbone, it never fell flat, and the music is terrific. (I am a little biased because I love double reed instruments, and it's orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick so there's lots of bassoon.) But really, cleverest lyrics since Wicked, darkest comedy since Chicago. Incidentally, if you haven't seen those shows, consider seeing one of them instead. Both terrific shows. There's a reason they've been running over a decade each.  One show I really want to see, but I haven't yet so I don't really know how it compares, is The Visit. Also dark comedy, same people who wrote Chicago, sounds like terrific music.  Also look into The King And I, if for no other reason than that it's a classic.  But do some research. Listen to whatever music you can. I know the Gentleman's Guide cast album is on both Spotify and Youtube officially. Come to a decision based on your own preferences. There are lots of great shows running on Broadway, I'm sure you'll enjoy whatever you end up seeing."

It's a hilarious show, especially if you enjoy British-esque humor. It's a blast to see, and stage-dooring for it was one of my favorite stage doors. Jefferson Mays is quite possibly the nicest guy I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. In addition, the man playing the lead Monty Navarro (his name is Jeff Kready), I was lucky enough to see his first performance in the role while he was still understudy, and can safely say he is incredible in the role.

Broadway,31bbcw,UrNotAMachine,7,Fri Apr 3 18:45:37 2015 UTC,"Well, Tim Minchin is involved, so I'm excited."

The King and I was fantastic, though Ken Watanabe as the king wasn't as great as the rest of the cast. The scene of ""Small House of Uncle Thomas"" is worth the price of admission alone.   It Shoulda Been You was fun, light, accessible. I hope it becomes a sleeper hit -- there's a lot to like about it.   On the 20th Century was LOTS of fun, and very beautiful. I wish there had been more tap dancers (just four) but Kristin Chenoweth is in top form.   I wish I had seen Fun Home.  I haven't heard much about Gigi -- have any of you seen that yet?"

And the few people I have talked to about it have liked it and said I should go see it.   I've heard good things about Gigi. They changed it up so it's not some creepy old guy singing ""Thank Heaven for Little Girls."" Instead the aunts sing it. Also, they raised Gigi's age. I was worried about Vanessa Hudgens, but from what I've heard, she holds her own. Everyone I've spoked to though has friends in the show so they may be a bit biased, but I think I'm going to try to see this one."

The music was beautiful and the costumes were amazing, but the chemistry between the two leads needs some work. However they have another 2 weeks until it opens so I'm hoping they can improve on that.   They rely on projections a lot for their sets and some of them distracted me from the scene. However some of the projections were really amazing and useful to the set. Right now, I probably wouldn't recommend it to people since it is long (2hr40min) and didn't leave me wanting more. I really want this show to succeed though so I'm hoping they can improve on it before the official opening.   I'm seeing Living On Love this weekend so I'll add to this on Sat.   Things I've heard but haven't seen: I've heard fantastic things about Something Rotten. It's selling really well and everyone who has seen it is raving about it. Friends are telling me that Gigi is great. Wolf Hall is amazing. I've heard mixed things on Finding Neverland. It Should've Been You is fun.   edit: 4/5 I saw Living on Love which is cute. I got free tickets and really enjoyed myself. I wouldn't say it's a 'must-see' but it's 2hrs of an enjoyable evening.  Gigi- I also saw this on Saturday night. Absolutely fantastic! I have to admit I wasn't expecting Vanessa Hudgens to be very good, but she was just what the show needed. The cast is incredible and it's a great revival of this show."

Really incredible performances (no surprise), and the play itself is very fun -- less about issues and more about the relationships between Queen Elizabeth II and her prime ministers. I recommend it, if only to experience Helen Mirren live on-stage.  I have tickets to The King and I on Memorial Day weekend and I can't wait! I'm hoping I might be able to marathon Wolf Hall that weekend as well -- I'm a Tudor history nut, and I really enjoyed the books.  Also on my list: It Shoulda Been You, Fun Home, Skylight, and Gigi. And, of course, Hamilton next season.   Edit: Hand to God. Definitely want to see Hand to God."
Broadway,3186sw,Yoyti,2,Thu Apr 2 20:25:08 2015 UTC,"1) Fun Home, go see it. Its a uniquely incredible experience all around. Being in the round gives it a different atmosphere than your typical broadway show. It really has a feel of inviting the audience in to come play. Also, one of the best child performances I've ever seen in Sydney Lucas.  2) American in Paris is great if you love brilliant choreography and beautiful projections (seriously you won't see better this year of either). If you're looking for a great story or incredible singers see something else.  3) Something Rotten - Fantastic, entertaining standard broadway musical. Had me in stitches for a good part of the show. Nothing you've never seen before though.  4) On the 20th Century is one of the best produced of all the shows currently playing. It doesn't have the best storyline or any songs that will really stick with you, but its a hoot and really fun for the performers and dancing.  I've seen most of the others, but those are the four that come to mind. Feel free to ask me about anything else."

I'd love either in the role. I can't believe I just dreamcast Eddie Murphy in a musical but I was really impressed by his performance in Dreamgirls though I don't know how much of that was ""movie magic""  Also, my secondary dreamcast for the Lion is James Monroe Inglehart. He's apparently done it before and killed it (to the surprise of absolutely no one), but Tituss is a much bigger name right now outside of the Broadway community.  Who are we dream casting for the witches? Someone on BroadwayWorld talked about trying to get Aretha Franklin for Evillene - talk about a great marketing campaign if they got her!"

Broadway,30ufns,teacherdrama,3,Tue Mar 31 21:28:47 2015 UTC,"co-produced by Cirque du Soleil’s new stage theatrical division   Unlike Sound of Music, Peter Pan or Grease, I'm actually hyped now"
Broadway,30ufns,King-Slime,6,Tue Mar 31 00:53:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is going to work for the same reason I don't think Peter Pan worked. Suspension of disbelief. In live theater, we're more forgiving of things like sudden random choruses and dance sequences and atmospheric weirdness and a lot of things that usually wouldn't fit. Solo songs notwithstanding, The Sound Of Music is mostly devoid of these, and I actually liked the broadcast of The Sound Of Music. But Peter Pan breaks the fourth wall, among other elements that really only work on the stage. And if the production had gone full-on movie, or full-on filmed stage show, maybe it would have been okay, but the way it was done, it felt like Peter Pan couldn't decide whether it was a stage show or a movie. The Wiz has similar elements that make me worry.  The Music Man is a more grounded musical. Most of the choruses are brought about in the framework by Harold Hill's smooth talking, the music follows naturally from the setting, and on the whole, I think it would work better in this hybrid format than The Wiz.  Plus, if they did The Music Man, Christian Borle could play Marcellus or Mayor Shinn, and he could become the John Ratzenberger of NBC live musical broadcasts."
Broadway,30ufns,Yoyti,3,Tue Mar 31 04:18:12 2015 UTC,What's the use of wondering?  They already made their decision.
Broadway,30ufns,teacherdrama,2,Tue Mar 31 21:30:31 2015 UTC,I wonder why they changed it from The Music Man? I honestly feel like this is a better pick. It'll be more fun for audiences via TV.
Broadway,30ufns,spoilz,3,Tue Mar 31 00:39:30 2015 UTC,"They'll probably get a bigger audience with The Wiz than with The Music Man since it's comparable to The Wizard of Oz which everyone knows. Also, less child actors to work with."

Broadway,30ubm1,76slideytrumpets,2,Mon Mar 30 23:50:40 2015 UTC,"Really, Wicked just isn't worth seeing anymore. It's the most expensive ticket I've ever purchased and the show's become very loose. Yeah, it has some of the best talent & writing on Broadway, but after ten years it's become really flabby...the pacing no longer totally works and even though the orchestrations are some of the best ever written they no longer have that exciting shine that an engaged pit orchestra can give. When a show runs for too long, people start phoning it in...some shows (the Mendes revival of Cabaret, Chicago) have a lot of room to change with the personalities of new actors and they stay fresh. Shows like Wicked (or Phantom, which hasn't been exciting for a decade) just aren't able to do that sort of constant revamping.  They're great because a lot of people get regular employment, but what kills me is that people who've never seen a show before are absolutely adamant that they're seeing Wicked (or Phantom) or NOTHING...and they end up seeing one of the most expensive and least fresh shows."
Broadway,30ubm1,thesweetestpunch,3,Tue Mar 31 00:25:27 2015 UTC,"I'd do Aladdin for a Broadway date over Wicked. Both of these shows are in my top ten of the ones I've seen.  Both are going to be expensive.  If you're looking for a romantic date though, I'd go for Aladdin. Wicked is more about friendship and a ""not as tragic as it could have been"" end, while Aladdin has a higher energy, more romance, and ends on a happy note that seems a better way to end a date. Depending on the type of people you are. Wicked still is powerful and fantastic and a must see."
Broadway,30ubm1,cecwildcat1,2,Tue Mar 31 02:42:47 2015 UTC,"Wicked is fantastic, I think you can buy tickets directly through their website but I'm not sure of the price difference. Also make sure you absolutely buy for the correct date, no refunds a lot of the time."

Broadway,30ubm1,ellechase,2,Wed Apr 1 01:16:46 2015 UTC,"If it's your first time going to broadway, any show that's been open for several years is going to be very expensive and a little bloated. Meaning, the audience is rowdy and the show's pacing tends to get uneven. The band is also bored stiff by then...lots of subs in the pit and very little ""sparkle"" left in the score. I saw Wicked when there were five subs in the pit and the sound team had basically muted the strings and winds by halfway through the first act due to intonation issues.   Tickets for either show are in excess of a hundred dollars for the worst seat in the house.   My recommendation? A bunch of new shows with ridiculously good press just opened. Fun Home, Something Rotten, and Honeymoon in Vegas (the romantic comedy of the three) are all open, fun, exciting, exceedingly well-reviewed, and have good tickets for much, much cheaper than Aladdin and Wicked."

As a musical, it's an entirely original idea, which can't be said for most of Broadway. The choreography is top notch, and there is a lot of wink wink nudge nudge reminiscent of Spamalot and Book of Mormon. A lot of inside jokes about musical theatre that can go right over the lay person's head I thought, but it is still universally funny across the board.  Now seeing a show in previews does not wholly represent the final product. Knowing this, I thought the 2nd act was rather unrefined and dragged a little and I have insight from a cast member that the 2nd half will be trimmed a whole bunch.  Either way, there were several really memorable songs and moments that I would only expect from that creative team. Christian and Brian and the rest of the cast are amazing and worthy of every bit of stage time. Go see this show before they mark it up and you won't be able to find a seat."

Broadway,30j5t1,minipolliwog,5,Sat Mar 28 02:13:50 2015 UTC,"And there are plenty of ways to see theater at lower prices. The nonprofit subscription bases, TKTS, TDF, rush, lotto, TodayTix. Regional theater, tours, off-Broadway. Why must it be the hottest ticket on Broadway right now? Bullshit. Broadway is commercial.  You're worried about art dying out? You should donate to all those school programs that are cutting their theater and music programs. You're absolutely prioritizing the wrong thing if you're worried about ""art"" in this culture."

And no, art isn't the only thing I'm worried about, but I am worried about the theatre dying out. Just because one thing concerns me doesn't mean other things don't. Your logic is faulty. I think more performances should be professionally filmed and sold, or aired on television, or at least made available so young people can get into the arts. What a horrible fucking idea, am I right?"

Broadway,30lh1x,inconceivable42,4,Sat Mar 28 13:21:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it was a flop. It had 722 performances and ran for a year and a half on broadway. It also won some audience choice awards for best new musical that season. It may not have been a huge success, but it definitely wasn't a flop.  Either way, OP's title is just silly."
Broadway,30lh1x,spoilz,3,Sat Mar 28 14:18:35 2015 UTC,"It was a flop because it didn't recoup. That's the technical definition. It can run a long time (like Spider Man) but still never recoup if the ticket prices are low and capitalization high.  Whether it was a HUGE flop is something no outsider will know and is open to interpretation, since the producers just don't release partial recoup numbers."
Broadway,30lh1x,minipolliwog,-1,Sat Mar 28 14:49:24 2015 UTC,"I just googled a bit and I don't think there is a technical definition of ""Flop"" for broadway shows. It's just kind of if a show closed within a few weeks (Carrie), then it's considered a flop. Or did a show get horrible reviews (Spider-man), but still play a decent amount of time because people kept throwing money at it, it's a flop. I don't think a show recouping it's initial investment determines if it is a flop or not.  Sources:  1  2  3"

Broadway,30lh1x,icancook2,1 point,Sun Mar 29 02:16:38 2015 UTC,"I'm still not seeing an official ""technical definition"" of flop. The reason my sources were so bad was because those were the closest websites to providing a definition for ""flop"". That smithsonian page just talks about shows that flopped, still not providing a definition of flop. That list is not factual but subjective. An opinion.   Again, the point I was making in my previous post was that there is no technical term for flop you can classify any show as a flop pretty much if it had a poor run, bad reviews, and in the case of ""Pipe Dream"", was the least successful running show for Rogers and Hammerstein. It's all completely subjective. That's the only point I'm making. OP said Addam's Family was a ""Huge Flop"" because it didn't recoup their investment. Which I disagree with. May be a flop for that reason, but I don't think it's fair to call a show that won audience choice awards and ran 1.5 years, a huge failure. But if that's how OP wants to define huge flop, that's for OP to decide. But don't try and tell everyone there is a technical definition for Huge Flop when there is not."

Personally I prefer Sondheim over Webber solely because of how edgy, daring, and ruthless Sondheim can be. Don't get me wrong, both are amazing and are fun to watch; I've just always found more depth in Sondheim's works. But I can also understand why people don't like him. Many of his works are highly critical of our society. His music is different from what most composers write and many of his works are making massive statements about the human condition. Those are intense things to drop on an audience.   Tldr both are great for different reasons"

I can understand people being put off if they don't like patter for instance, or his use of very similar melodies (I challenge anyone to listen to Into the Woods and not occasionally slip into Sweeney Todd. Yes, I'm a casual Broadway fan)"
Broadway,2zmdw6,UrNotAMachine,2,Fri Mar 20 14:51:07 2015 UTC,"I've seen many of his shows, ""Into the Woods"" ""A Little Night Music"" ""...Forum"" ""Anyone Can Whistle"" etc... I'm not a music major by any degree so excuse me if I'm not using the right phrasing here. I think he's an amazing lyricist, but he's more or less all over the place with his melodies. I don't leave a show humming a tune because I personally can't remember any tunes after I've seen one of his shows. Sure, now that I've seen or heard some of his work multiple times, I will know the tune, but not initially. I'm a fan of the classical type approach and he's definitely more modern in many of his songs. If I just took his lyrics, I would think they are poetry and he's a brilliant poet. That's probably why I like his work for WSS and Gypsy best. He didn't write the music, that was Leonard Bernstein and Jule Styne.  edit: also, thank you for being civil instead of calling me names for having a different opinion than everyone here."
Broadway,2zmdw6,Irishman318,2,Fri Mar 20 15:59:08 2015 UTC,"Have you tried Merrily We Roll Along? Most of the melodies in that show are very golden-age (50s & 60s) and, if you'll excuse the term, ""hummable.""   Most people's issues with his melodies really come down to the amount of repetition in his shows - your typical musical repeats the ""hit"" melodies several times - many repeated choruses, many reprises, plus overture. The majority of his shows don't allow for that. Merrily has much more repetition than his usual scores, and it makes the tunes stick better. Remember that at the time West Side Story came out, it was dismissed as being unmelodious and overly complicated (Bernstein's score for On the Town was chucked from the film for the same reason), so oftentimes melodies are about amount of exposure more than anything else.   From a compositional standpoint, the majority of his melodies have nothing setting them apart from anything by Strouse, Rodgers, Bock, Kern, or Porter; the fundamental melodies are constructed and organized in the same way and are usually around the same level of baseline difficulty. What separates him from them is simply that he doesn't repeat the same lyrical sections as often, and that those sections are often surrounded by more challenging material that pulls your focus."
Broadway,2zmdw6,UrNotAMachine,2,Fri Mar 20 16:46:08 2015 UTC,"I would argue that Sondheim repeats his melodies more, but he also repeats them in more fragmented and varied ways, most notably in Sunday In The Park With George. Frankly, I find all his shows hummable.   I'm not sure how much I buy into the whole repetition thing, though. One of Sondheim's best known songs, Send In The Clowns, is sung late in Act II, and is then only briefly reprised near the end. The night waltz tunes get more coverage in that show than anything else. And the songs from Follies everyone knows are Losing My Mind, I'm Still Here, and maybe also Broadway Baby, but each of those songs are only sung once, and not reprised at all. But there's a leitmotif that is present in at least three songs, Don't Look At Me, The Road You Didn't Take, and In Buddy's Eyes, and yet no one ever seems to go around humming that. Where Sondheim isn't hummable is in his polyphony, but even then, except for cases of complete chaos like in Anyone Can Whistle, there's usually still an overlying arc that's not tough to distinguish. Heck, I even find City On Fire hummable!"
Broadway,2zmdw6,Yoyti,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:05:32 2015 UTC,"All the songs you mentioned got a lot of coverage in cabarets, recordings, films, etc though. Repeated exposure applies to re-hearings, not just in the context of an evening or cast recording. And leitmotifs don't really count - many audiences don't even notice them, especially not in vamps."
Broadway,2zmdw6,UrNotAMachine,1 point,Fri Mar 20 19:22:22 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, but it baffles me that some of these songs caught on in the first place. I consider Send In The Clowns to be one of Sondheim's more mediocre songs, not bad, just not wonderfully terrific. If I had my way, the hit song from A Little Night Music would probably be The Miller's Son, which has the added bonus of actually working out of context. To the casual listener, Send In The Clowns may sound fine out of context, but if you really look at the lyrics, it doesn't. (I love the acting imagery he uses, since the character is an actress who sings it.) When Barbra Streisand recorded the song, she requested Sondheim write an extra verse to go where there's a dialogue in the show, to bridge the character gap that that dialogue covers. The song, I think, is a lot better for it.  What about A Little Priest? It doesn't get a whole lot of coverage outside the show (if any song from Sweeney Todd does, it's probably Johanna, which is also iterated several times over the course of the show, but let's face it, A Little Priest is pretty context-reliant), and even in the show is only iterated twice, once in the song proper, and once in a fragmented form at the end. But it is still, I think, at least, undeniably hummable. Comedy Tonight similarly, but then that's the first and last song the audience hears in that show, and it's not fragmented or combined or otherwise manipulated the second time around, so I guess bookending the musical with it helps it stick."

I enjoy his music, but he seems to have inflated his ego with age, kind of looking down his nose at other works that don't try to pose hard questions. There is a time and place for everything, but theater doesn't have to be all grit and wit and thought.  Hell, even his latest work is a tad bit shitty (looking at you, Passion... Beauty and the Beast did it better ) and he still rolls around making inflammatory remarks, thinking he's hot shit. I mean, goddamn, half of Six is basically a semi-handjob of self praise, with some sprinklings into how he did things (because, let's face it, the man has maybe one show left in him, at most).  TL;DR: I enjoy the artist within him, but not the man himself"

He's one of the fathers of the modern musical and has taken so many groundbreaking risks so I personally think you're allowed to be difficult and opinionated if you have the work and experience to back it up. His strong opinions on how things should be are probably part of the reason he's such a success in the first place. And he usually only speaks ill of the work of dead composers, which is why you always see him holding his tongue when he's asked about ALW in interviews."

I was sad not to see a full video recording setup when I took my seat, but I understand it would have been risky for a once-off performance. Any hopes of the full footage being released were dashed when there was some mic issues (like Ramin's mic not being turned up for almost all of his entrances) and the situation that happened during ""Where will you stand when the flood comes"" - that was stressful but one of the joys of live theatre I guess :P  I'm sad that there's not a full video available of it - I would lock myself in a room with full surround sound and watch that until the end of time"

Glad to see the original stars will be taking it to Broadway.   This was actually the reason George Takei started using social media -- to promote this musical. His Facebook popularity has given him a whole new audience and he's bigger than ever. All to promote this musical he feels so strongly about.

He is an actor whose career I am excited to watch and follow. Just because many have not heard of him except for his spot on Glee, it does not and will not define his career.

Broadway,2ygcgn,ankk09,18,Mon Mar 9 16:17:09 2015 UTC,"The score and actual ""play"" are lackluster, bordering on sophomoric. The theatricality is amazing. If you want to introduce children to live theatre in a way that makes it distinct from other art forms, nothing is better.   If you're an adult, save your money and go see Honeymoon in Vegas (it is much better than it's advertising indicates) or Gentlemans Guide (i didn't dig it, but a lot of people did). Or the upcoming Fun Home. If you want to spend more money on a seriously great show go for king and I or Hamilton (good luck getting tickets for that).  It all depends on what you like, though. There are all kinds of musicals for all kinds of tastes. For my tastes, the best deal on Broadway right now is Honeymoon in Vegas. It's fast, it's funny, it's tuneful, it's silly, it's an absurd romantic comedy in a throwback kind of way. And their advertising sucks so tickets are dirt cheap through the TodayTix app. Perfect play for a husband looking for a good date show.   If you like stuff that's more methodically paced and where the material is more subtextual, try The King and I. You like quirky dark dramedy? Fun Home. You like cutting edge? Hamilton. You like a really entertaining show that suddenly gut-punches you out of nowhere? Try Cabaret (warning, that closes in two weeks but t is basically a perfect stage musical). You want something entertaining that is adult-intelligence but kid-appropriate, with a new twist? Try the roundabout revival of Into the Woods.   Musicals are like movies, there are a ton of them out there that cater to every taste in the world. Some of it you'll love, some of it you'll hate. Tell us what you like and we can give recommendations!"
Broadway,2ygcgn,thesweetestpunch,3,Mon Mar 9 17:05:47 2015 UTC,"Just picked up my tickets to Hamilton when it moves to Broadway! I hadn't even heard of it before - I wasn't paying attention, but it sounds AMAZING."

Broadway,2ygcgn,thesweetestpunch,6,Tue Mar 10 04:16:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Boring story (especially if you already know it inside out), but the costumes and scenery and dancing are all incredible. I saw it when I was 8 and again when I was 23. The second time around I had free tickets, so I probably wouldn't have bought them again, but I appreciated the production value a lot more as an adult. I'm glad I got a second chance in that regard."
Broadway,2ygcgn,BlackRockKitty,2,Mon Mar 9 20:33:10 2015 UTC,"I've heard mixed reviews on Honeymoon in Vegas. One of my friends LOVED it, others not so much.  I've got a ticket for Hamilton in April before it moves on to Broadway, and everyone I know who has seen it says it's phenomenal. Agreed that Cabaret is fantastic, I saw it twice and really adore it. My personal favorite show I've seen is Hedwig. If you like glam rock and raunchiness it's pretty much perfect."
Broadway,2ygcgn,crashboom,6,Tue Mar 10 23:48:02 2015 UTC,"I already commented, but want to add: Musical Theatre is an entire art form, a category as large as Movies or Music is. It encompasses everything. So if you're asking ""what should I see?"", that's silly because there's no ""this is the best musical, you will love it no matter what"". There are genres within genres when it comes to musical theatre and a whole range of opinions. You tell us what kinds of things you like and what kinds of things you dislike and maybe we can steer you towards something good.   Also, there are ways of seeing musical theatre outside of crazy ticket prices. The TodayTix app, for starters. Then there are filmed stage musicals (not musical movies - totally different form!) on DVD that are great for dipping your toes in the water, like the 1989 taping of Into the Woods that you can rent off Netflix. And then youtube has lots of the Live from Lincoln Center musical theatre series, where you can watch things like South Pacific.   Tell us what you like, we'll help you out."

It's what we in musical theatre nerdism call a spectacle - where the show is so popular because of the production - extravagant costumes, impressive acrobatics, gigantic sets. Shrek was a spectacle. Pippin would be a spectacle, were it not for its very deep ending. Hairspray is a spectacle. Wicked borders on being a spectacle, but its plot and music make it a cut above. But The Lion King? Definitely a spectacle."

Easily one of my favorite theatrical experiences. Real shame it's closing. It leans too much on Idina Menzel, when in reality it actually holds up really well on its own."
Broadway,2yemkf,minipolliwog,3,Mon Mar 9 20:48:45 2015 UTC,"I think the publicity following Frozen got a little out of hand, which no one could have predicted, but also because that demographic isn't for this show. It seemed to become a double-edged sword because the ""fanzels"" - a seemingly younger demographic than what's targeted in If/Then - came out in force and unfortunately spun positive buzz into ""See it for Idina Menzel,"" which I'm not sure did the show any favors. That buzz certainly hurt the show whenever Idina was out... But with mixed reviews, perhaps this outcome was inevitable.   This is also why I'm very curious how this is going to do on tour."

Broadway,2yemkf,howaboutwenot,2,Tue Mar 10 00:44:25 2015 UTC,"I would go a step further and say that the show is better without her. Let's face it - when people buy tickets for this show, the vast majority of them are buying to see Idina Menzel. If this show were to go out on its own without all the unnecessary star hype, I think it would do just as good if not better."

Broadway,2yah32,MaryJaneHolland88,3,Sun Mar 8 00:43:38 2015 UTC,Would you be willing to share a little more about what makes Wicked/Dancing Through Life so important to you? I love tattoo stories.
Broadway,2yah32,northern_belle,9,Sun Mar 8 01:47:20 2015 UTC,"Yea! I'd love to! It's a long story so bear with me.   So as long as I can remember I've been a fan of the theatre, and musicals in general. I have a couple other tattoos and I knew I wanted one that showed my love of theatre. I thought about getting the theatre masks, but that just didn't sit right with me. I thought long and hard about it until my friend said, ""why don't you get a quote from your favourite musical?""  Good idea, right?   Now I had to find my favourite show. Would I choose Moulin Rouge? My favourite movie since I was 11. The Last Five Years? Wicked? I ended up choosing Wicked because I thought tattooing something from L5Y would be too morbid. I also wanted to do an homage to musicals in general. Wicked is fairly well known, and I've seen it twice. Once in New York, and Vancouver, BC (close to where I live.) I thought about the quote for a while as well. I had a top 3:   I'm Wicked through and through Everyone Deserves the Chance to Fly Dancing Through Life  I ended up choosing Dancing Through Life simply because I resonate with the song itself. To me it's about going through life trying to be more carefree and not stress about the small things. Plus, it's also my favourite scene in the show.   I hope that's the answer you're looking for! I'm absolutely in love with it. I can't stop looking at my foot!"
Broadway,2ycljm,mhaydar,6,Sun Mar 8 17:02:12 2015 UTC,"The latter, most likely (might hurt ticket sales), but also because selling recordings goes against what live theater is about. BoM is still doing EXTREMELY well in weekly gross, even during the worst time of year.   A live theater recording for public purchase is rare. They did it for RENT's closing performance for historical reasons, but otherwise the only legit recordings live in the NYPL/TOFT archive for industry insiders and theater students (class viewings, etc.). I don't believe the industry will move to video sales anytime soon, because it goes against the very fiber of live theater: in-person experience, ephemeral art."
Broadway,2ycljm,minipolliwog,3,Sun Mar 8 17:23:02 2015 UTC,"I personally disagree with this argument. For 99% of people these shows are not available due to distance or cost. Once a show closes on Broadway and tour, a film release could follow (as they did with Memphis) and while obviously not the same, is still a great advertisement for theatre. Would seeing a filmed concert experience keep you from seeing an artist in concert? Or comedian?"
Broadway,2ycljm,minipolliwog,3,Sun Mar 8 20:24:40 2015 UTC,"The counter is then, so what?  What about Broadway is a right that should be made more available to people rather than being a privilege for those who have the means to travel? (Be careful about treading into those murky waters of ""people deserve to get cheap tickets."")  Approaching the argument from the point of view of ""people deserve to see it"" will always fail because this commercial entertainment is a luxury. A more persuasive argument might be, ""If they release an official recording, they can get more revenue to recoup!""  Except what will be the initial publication costs, and how many must a production sell to break even to start profiting? Most cast recordings don't even recoup, and those have been quite available to the masses for some time and are seen as great advertisement for their respective shows, assuming the show is still open when the OCR is released.* That only indicates how small the market truly is.  Now, it's really up to the producers whether someone will one day actually try a commercial video release as an experiment, but it's pretty obvious that Broadway productions this day and age are targeting a very particular middle-upper-class demographic, one that's capable of travel."
Broadway,2ycljm,minipolliwog,4,Sun Mar 8 20:53:56 2015 UTC,Wow. That's a really elitist view.   I think the more people that can see theatre (and not just the remakes and film rehashes) the better. You and I are going to disagree.
Broadway,2ycljm,kmccoy,1 point,Mon Mar 9 05:31:51 2015 UTC,"""Businesses catering to specific demographics are elitist."" You have a naive view of the world.  Disney World raised its rates. Well, they're being elitist and should lower them. There aren't enough IMAX theaters around and the tickets are too expensive. Elitist. Cirque du Soleil is damn elitist for not coming to my city and being expensive on top of that.  I don't have a horse in this race, except that way too many people insist privileges for anything should be rights. Broadway is a commercial industry, and merely an entertainment industry at that. Take a step back from your little corner and look at where that sits in the world, ultimately."
Broadway,2ycljm,kmccoy,1 point,Mon Mar 9 13:54:56 2015 UTC,"The Memphis DVD was released while the show was still on Broadway and before the tour started.

Broadway,2xycdy,Clarabella_Baby,10,Wed Mar 4 22:07:46 2015 UTC,Ramin doesn't think Ramin is the best phantom.
Broadway,2xycdy,GlobindobinButler,12,Thu Mar 5 01:28:43 2015 UTC,"Ramin Karimloo is in my opinion, and everyone else's that I know the best Phantom there has ever been. Watch the 25th anniversary at The Royal Albert Hall with Sierra Boggess. Not only does he hit every single note PERFECTLY, the tone and emotion i his voice is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Also listen to 'Till I Hear You Sing' from Love Never Dies which is the sequel to Phantom. Read the synopsis of LND to get a full understanding of why he's singing the song. I suggest you watch the 25th annivesary of Phantom a couple of times to really see and focus on the emotion Ramin potrays. Look at the way he holds his hands and the presence he has on stage. I can't stress how perfectly Ramin portrays the character of Phantom. Honestly, mark his every move on your script. Perfection."
Broadway,2xycdy,nataliecakar,6,Wed Mar 4 23:25:29 2015 UTC,"Ramin is a machine. His Valjean is just as good as his Phantom: See Who Am I, and Soliloquy. Oh, the things I would do for a cast album of Ramin in Les Mis.   See also Seth Rudetsky and Ramin."
Broadway,2xycdy,sonofapants,6,Thu Mar 5 01:26:01 2015 UTC,"Saw him last summer as Valjean. Did not disappoint. Highlights: Bring him home (obviously), but the best part of the show was the end of the Soliloquy. Good Lord. I thought the roof would collapse."
Broadway,2xycdy,Pianoman338,4,Thu Mar 5 03:00:47 2015 UTC,"I remember the theatre being completely silent during Bring Him Home.  Ramin is so great, and really friendly - I was at the stage door after the show, and he stopped to talk to anyone who started a conversation."

The emotionality that he puts into that role is above and beyond what I have seen before. I usually shed a few tears during Phantom, but I sobbed liked a child when I saw the 25th, because he is so damn good that I was totally immersed. I would kill to be able to see his Valjean on bway."

Broadway,2xlgn5,Goforitconnect5,12,Sun Mar 1 20:53:17 2015 UTC,"Granted my memory of the storyline is a little faulty, but I'm pretty sure that's not the only reason why it happens. I think the general purpose of the song Contact is to connect sexuality to death. As far as ""It's over"", you might be drawing too literal of a connection between the sex and the distancing of the couples."
Broadway,2xlgn5,Mdb8900,-1,Sun Mar 1 21:37:27 2015 UTC,"You may be right, but I'm thinking especially about Collins and Angel. Collins goes on to immediately sing the reprise of I'll Cover You, which in the stage version (though not the movie version) is his mourning the end of their relationship. To my knowledge there is no indication prior to Contact that anything is awry with their relationship. What do you think?"
Broadway,2xlgn5,Yoyti,18,Sun Mar 1 21:47:34 2015 UTC,"Isn't the reprise of I'll Cover You Collins mourning Angel's death? Because Angel has AIDS and that's part of Contact? I don't even like Rent, but I've never found that particularly confusing."
Broadway,2xlgn5,minipolliwog,2,Sun Mar 1 21:56:53 2015 UTC,"Right, so going from Contact to the reprise, Angel dies (edit: see below). But the other couples were already having problems before Contact (e.g. Maureen/Joanne with Take Me Or Leave Me), so it's not a big stretch. Not perfect execution, but it's not like Jonathan Larson had a chance to fix things himself..."
Broadway,2xlgn5,-chimerical-,5,Sun Mar 1 22:03:32 2015 UTC,"I always took 'Contact' as more symbolic than anything else. I'm not sure how I would define it in terms of what I think is actually happening, but in all the years I've been listening to this soundtrack and all the times I've seen the musical I've never seen 'Contact' as Angel dying during sex, if for no other reason than because I don't think by this point in his illness he would be physically strong enough to have sex. (Worth mentioning also that, in addition to Maureen and Joanne's issues, by this point in the show Roger and Mimi are not only broken up, but have made an effort to distance themselves from one another, so I'm not sure I think they're actually having sex either.)"
Broadway,2xlgn5,exedore_us,6,Sun Mar 1 23:41:07 2015 UTC,"Contact is a fever dream, not Angel dying during sex. S/He is clearly in the hospital during Without You. It also sets up the autum season, transitioning out of a quiet summer."

In the case of Collins/Angel, their ""It's over"" is different from the other couples', understood by the previous scene where Collins is nursing a dying Angel."
Broadway,2xlgn5,Mdb8900,6,Sun Mar 1 21:57:09 2015 UTC,You're right. There's nothing awry with their relationship except the part where Angel dies.

Broadway,2xlgn5,-chimerical-,5,Mon Mar 2 19:33:16 2015 UTC,"I've always viewed the song as more symbolic than literal, as I touched on in a response to another comment here, but I think it's worth pointing out that by this point in the show, Maureen and Joanne are very much on and off and Roger and Mimi aren't together at all. The two numbers leading up to 'Contact' are 'Take Me Or Leave Me' and 'Without You', and by the end of each of those songs I don't really think of either couple as together. (I also don't think that, given the emotional distance between Mimi and Roger at this stage, as well as the way they don't seem to have spoken in a while when Mimi confronts him in 'Goodbye Love', they're having sex anymore.)"
Broadway,2xlgn5,Chriias,5,Sun Mar 1 23:53:27 2015 UTC,"RENT, among other things, is an exploration of relationships and sex. Throughout the musical we have seen these relationships dissolve and I believe ""Contact"" is the climax of that unraveling."
Broadway,2xlgn5,RolandKa,3,Mon Mar 2 18:28:02 2015 UTC,Rent is probably my all time favorite show.  That said:   If you think about it most of the relationships really aren't that healthy and don't have a very good story arc.  You could argue that the only couple that is in a relationship you'd want to be in ends in death. If you think a little more...  For a musical all about the artists of the east village none of them are very successful or even very talented.  Angel plays a bucket on the street.  Maureen stages a weird protest that gets shut down by the cops.  Mark's Magnum Opus is basically a video of all of his friends smiling while he rides around on his bike.

Broadway,2wyl3p,ftewbo9,5,Tue Feb 24 05:33:44 2015 UTC,"Here's how TodayTix works (this ends with me suggesting you go to the box office yourself and save $10):  The show puts out discount codes through different groups / organizations in an attempt to move specific blocks of seats. It's mid-winter, perhaps they're having trouble getting the mid-mezzanine and partial view orchestra seats to sell. So the general managers decide to offer discount seats to the Playbill Fan Club group, to see if that discount gets people to buy tickets.  TodayTix knows the discount sites to keep an eye on, and passes that discount along to you, plus a service fee (I think it's $5 a ticket?). You order your pair of tickets on the site, and one of their people walks to the Gershwin box office and gives whatever the cheapest discount code they can find is, and buys that pair of tickets to hand to you. As they buy from the box office, there are no extra telecharge / ticketmaster fees.  Fair enough business model, I don't mean to imply anything else. And the fee is fairly small, fully within the realm of paying extra for extra convenience. But you could also do this yourself. Setup an account at the Playbill Club, and head over to Broadway Box and see if there are discount codes (there might not be, Wicked usually sells well). Then take a code if you find one, or else just yourself, and head to the box office and buy your tickets directly with no added fees.  If you can get enough people to use the referrer code to save more than the fees TodayTix charges go for it, you're saving money. But there's nothing they do that you can't do by hopping on the 1."
Broadway,2wyl3p,zac850,2,Tue Feb 24 11:29:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the thoughtful and detailed response.  Their service charge is pretty cheap. I'll check it the site but I figure if, say, 5 people use the referral code that's $100 off the already discounted price.   I didn't know that the seats are there because they were harder to push. Seating at the movies doesn't matter too much, or at least it doesn't compare to how a good seat impacts the performance on a Broadway show. I'll keep that information in mind."
Broadway,2wyl3p,icancook2,2,Tue Feb 24 12:26:37 2015 UTC,"/u/zac850 is not quite correct. I work for a company that occasionally sends tickets to TodayTix. We give them their own discount offer, sometimes it matches our other offers, sometimes it doesn't.  Today Tix offers you convenience and, like you said, if you even get a few people to purchase tickets using your referral code, you are ahead!"
Broadway,2wyl3p,zac850,1 point,Wed Feb 25 02:37:02 2015 UTC,Smart you give them their own code. They would just grab our public codes. Messed up my tracking sheets.

Broadway,2wyl3p,crachelmazing,2,Tue Feb 24 05:46:39 2015 UTC,Thanks a bunch! I'll apply the code when I buy the tickets in a few weeks. If you end up purchasing any tickets between now and then using my code would really help me out too.

Unsolicited advice: Get some tickets to Honeymoon in Vegas if you can. One of the best shows in town, but the Producers have been terrible about advertising it so tickets are cheap and a rear mezzanine ticket will usually get you bumped by ushers to one of the front rows of the mezzanine. It's not unusual to get front-row mezzanine tickets for $40 each, and again - one of the best shows in town."

It's going to be hard to buy the idea that he's had the life experience to have gone through what Hedwig has gone through. But you never know, right?"
Broadway,2w7pex,missfarin,3,Tue Feb 17 18:59:54 2015 UTC,"JCM was 35 when Hegwig started. Darren Criss is 28. Young, but not totally implausible. The fact that he's played a high school student for the last five years doesn't help matters, though."
Broadway,2w7pex,QuasarMonsanto,2,Wed Feb 18 01:10:27 2015 UTC,"Well, to play devil's advocate JCM was 35 in 1998 which made it convincing that he lived in in East Germany before the fall of the berlin wall for a lot of his life.

Broadway,2w0ulv,bagpiper,16,Mon Feb 16 01:50:15 2015 UTC,"I think a long-running show would need to be below nut or a certain potential gross percent for significant stretches for producers to consider shuttering, as pure business decision.  At the lowest point of the season in the past few weeks, Wicked has always stayed above 75% gross potential. The Lion King didn't dip below 90% despite falling over $1.5 million in the month of January (!).   Another example is RENT. It ran from 1996 to 2008: The data on BWW starts at 1997, and for that year at least for the months with data, percent gross potential never fell below 100%. In 2000, the average was about 79% gross potential with a low point of 60-something% seats sold in a particular week. By its closing in 2008, the average was 63% gross potential."
Broadway,2w0ulv,minipolliwog,9,Mon Feb 16 01:13:25 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't be surprised if Phantom closed in the next few years. I love it,  but it could really use some time to rest. It's become a tourist trap instead of the game changer it was."
Broadway,2w0ulv,kylepierce11,6,Mon Feb 16 00:19:51 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you. I saw Phantom on Broadway a couple of months ago with Norm Lewis, and I was completely shocked by the number of people there who seemed to not be interested in the show at all (like they were on their phones the entire time). It has definitely become a total tourist trap."
Broadway,2w0ulv,bcapiro,5,Mon Feb 16 04:38:28 2015 UTC,"I saw Phantom a couple years ago with Peter Joback (well, I saw it with my grandmother, but Peter Joback was starring) and the theater was half empty and felt kind of dead (the show was still great, though). My grandmother predicted that Phantom would probably decline over the next couple of years. (I mean, we may just have happened to attend a less full performance, but still.) Of course, it's still here. It may be perpetually ""hanging on"" for a while.  Meanwhile, I saw If/Then a few months ago, and even without Idina Menzel (ticket refunds or exchanges were offered), the theater was near packed and felt very alive. There was a hell of a lot of applause at the key numbers. And If/Then is closing in a month. Does run time have an inverse relationship with audience engagement? I heard similar things about Bridges, that everyone in the audience seemed to love it, but it closed so quickly I didn't get to see it for myself. It seems like sort of a crapshoot what lasts and what doesn't.  I definitely feel that sooner or later some member of the cast is going to get seriously injured when the chandelier lands wrong or something (if the show runs long enough, it's pretty much inevitable that something will eventually go wrong), and then the show is going to have to close for a month or two for legal or publicity purposes, and then it'll definitely start winding down if it hasn't already."
Broadway,2w0ulv,Yoyti,3,Mon Feb 16 12:34:48 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen Phantom, but when I saw If/Then back in previews there may have been a lot of energy in the audience but most were only there for Idina. From what I saw then and have heard since, the show wouldn't survive without Idina - and I highly doubt she comes cheap. As opposed to say Wicked, where they can replace the cast and get newer, cheaper stars, If/Then is stuck paying for someone who costs top dollar - which means they have to make that much more to stay solvent  The show also received lackluster reviews and didn't win any awards (with good reason, in my opinion). It doesn't have the pull to bring people back over and over again and it doesn't have the fame of a classic that a show like Phantom can bank on to bring in tourists.  I'm honestly surprised that If/Then held on for as long as it did. The cost of the cast is likely very high and I just don't see how the show is bringing in enough to make it worth it."
Broadway,2w0ulv,rachycarebear,3,Mon Feb 16 14:38:10 2015 UTC,"I saw it on a day Idina wasn't there, which is why I felt justified in making that statement that there seemed to be a lot of energy in the audience. I was there because I thought the show sounded interesting. I couldn't really care less who played Elizabeth. And while the reviews were lackluster, most of the people I've talked to really enjoyed the show and talked highly of the whole thing, not just Idina."
Broadway,2w0ulv,Yoyti,2,Mon Feb 16 17:48:56 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, if Idina Menzel negotiated a percent gross contract instead of salary or on top of a minimum salary. I doubt we'll ever know, but apparently Hugh Jackman sometimes does that.  If the show was losing significant money every week for some time, it would have been shuttered sooner, though it did get a $5 million advance over the $10m capitalization. I doubt David Stone is a straight-up idiot to keep pumping into a losing show for a year, so instead I suspect the costs are lower than people might assume. It'll still close at a loss on Broadway, but there goes the tour."
Broadway,2w0ulv,minipolliwog,2,Mon Feb 16 15:16:43 2015 UTC,"I should clarify: there's a difference between not making enough money and actively losing money. If If/Then was actively losing money, I assume it would've closed a while ago. However, considering the probably high expenses and subpar ticket sales it is unlikely that it is making enough money to justify the costs, especially when the people (and theater) involved could be moving onwards to better and more profitable ventures."
Broadway,2w0ulv,rachycarebear,2,Mon Feb 16 16:53:59 2015 UTC,"It does appear the various cast members have been auditioning and doing other things, though (I think a couple left for other shows, and LaChanze and James Snyder filmed some TV episodes?). But the various cast and crew are being paid a salary to union specification regardless, so the show not making enough money is more a concern for the producers and investors. Well, and the venue, but they're apparently not so low that the Richard Rodgers wanted to kick them out quickly, which is what happened to another show recently.  I don't think being in a middling commercial show like If/Then is actually holding any of the cast back, but instead launched several cast members like James Snyder further into the spotlight in terms of visibility. Idina Menzel's star power there does have some benefit."
Broadway,2w0ulv,minipolliwog,6,Mon Feb 16 17:03:14 2015 UTC,"Probably not for a really long time.  The shows you named are all ""gateway"" Broadway shows, for newcomers or tourists, and thus will always be in demand."
Broadway,2w0ulv,jennyinthetardis,2,Mon Feb 16 01:21:52 2015 UTC,I think Phantom will probably wind down within the next 5 years or so. I wouldn't be surprised if Wicked played for another decade.
Broadway,2w0ulv,Princess_Batman,2,Mon Feb 16 03:38:22 2015 UTC,"When they start to dip more in revenue, they will make a push for ""final season."" To try to squeeze out a little more profit.  Phantom will be first. I'm looking forward to the shows eventually being open to high schools and community theatre."
Broadway,2w0ulv,btbcorno,2,Mon Feb 16 04:17:05 2015 UTC,"Cats has been open to amateurs in Australia for about 5 years, and Phantom for about 1."

Broadway,2vr6bb,stephhaddad,7,Fri Feb 13 10:41:36 2015 UTC,Bought it on iTunes and watched it twice already! I feel like it translated to film quite well. It helps that the talent is amazing.
Broadway,2vr6bb,metaphoricalgoldstar,5,Fri Feb 13 10:46:19 2015 UTC,"It's only available for rent in Canada so I did that, watched it, cried, and then downloaded it until I can buy it!"
Broadway,2vr6bb,amyyholley,2,Fri Feb 13 11:00:33 2015 UTC,"You guys are really lucky, we unfortunately don't have it here in Australia yet. It's starting to look like we won't get it at all"
Broadway,2vr6bb,gr8ver,5,Fri Feb 13 12:17:00 2015 UTC,"I was devastated by the end of the film. While I love the music, this story always makes me feel raw and heartbroken at the end but I think the film captures it all beautifully.  If you don't feel sad at the end of this show, they did it wrong.  This, with its little bumps and small but realistic flaws, captured the story perfectly for me."
Broadway,2vr6bb,coldblindjack,2,Sat Feb 14 06:41:25 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. I ended the movie with tears streaming down my face, but it was so beautiful and such a cathartic experience. The ending sequence on the stoop...It was so well done."

Broadway,2vr6bb,missladyofshalott,6,Fri Feb 13 15:45:37 2015 UTC,Bought it off iTunes at midnight. IT was astounding. The best movie musical I've ever seen. Bar none.
Broadway,2vr6bb,missladyofshalott,4,Fri Feb 13 16:14:25 2015 UTC,"Great film! The way they shot The Next Ten Minutes, Goodbye Until Tomorrow, and Nobody Needs to Know was beautifully done. I was kind of worried about Anna Kendrick's performance based off the trailer, but she did really well!  The way they shot Summer in Ohio was a bit weird though and compared to the rest of the soundtrack Moving too Fast and I Can Do Better than That sounded out of place. They should've given us more Betsy Wolfe though :\"

Broadway,2vr6bb,envy_adams,2,Sun Feb 15 23:31:26 2015 UTC,Watched it on demand on Fios.  LOVED it.  Kendrick and Jordan were both perfectly cast. My favorite part was the fight during If I Didn't Believe In You when we got to see both of their faces - it looked totally natural and was just perfectly shot.  Definitely one of the best movie musicals ever done.
Broadway,2vr6bb,LurkAddict,2,Sun Feb 15 03:06:21 2015 UTC,"I bought it on itunes and just finished watching it and as it is my very favorite musical I, of course, was upset about certain small things but even though I will always love the original soundtrack better, the singing was overall beautiful. I liked the way they conveyed the story. The whole movie looked beautiful and it gave me true emotions. Yes, I cried. Overall, I've been waiting for this movie for a really long time and it didn't disappoint me nearly as much as I was scared it would. I liked it. I will be watching it again."
Broadway,2vr6bb,lilianegypt,2,Sun Feb 15 03:39:02 2015 UTC,"Is it going to have a wider release in the US?  It's not in my city at all, and I'm in my state's capital.  I could watch it on demand, but I prefer the theatre going experience when possible."
Broadway,2vr6bb,BatmansBrokenBack,4,Fri Feb 13 18:51:37 2015 UTC,It's only showing in a few cities this week and then they're releasing to more cities next week. They're still adding cities so maybe they'll do an even wider release depending on how well it does on demand?
Broadway,2volvi,GlobindobinButler,6,Thu Feb 12 19:40:08 2015 UTC,Did anyone else see Micheal as Hedwig last time? What were your thoughts?
Broadway,2volvi,missfarin,6,Thu Feb 12 19:41:56 2015 UTC,"I saw him three times and am warring with myself over whether to buy a ticket for next week. That should give you an idea of what my thoughts are going to be, hahaha!  But seriously, I've been a fan of his for a very long time (I was lucky to see him as the Emcee in Cabaret back in 1999), and I knew he could do musical theatre, but even so, I wasn't prepared for how incredible he would be in the role. His physicality, his voice, everything just completely floored me. And I really loved his approach to Hedwig -- there was a vulnerability underneath the tough exterior that made his performance so compelling. If you can catch him next week, definitely do!"
Broadway,2volvi,katiekilobyte,2,Thu Feb 12 21:46:49 2015 UTC,"So jealous, I want to see him and John both so bad!"
Broadway,2volvi,jyost1,3,Thu Feb 12 23:39:45 2015 UTC,"I had the pleasure of seeing JCM on his opening night. It was the closest thing to a ""religious"" experience I have had. He was spot on and so playful with Hedwig and the show. You could tell he was so happy to be there, just pure joy all over his face and performance, yet at the same time painfully vulnerable. I still get goose bumps talking about it! See him if you can!  Very sad I won't get to see Michael C Hall. NPH sounds very interesting in his portrayal on the OBC recording. Haha."
Broadway,2volvi,broadwaybaby616,2,Fri Feb 13 02:54:34 2015 UTC,So agreed about John's opening night. It was glorious.
Broadway,2volvi,melcrawmeow,4,Fri Feb 13 16:04:40 2015 UTC,"I saw him twice, and god he was amazing. Voice a lot more gritty than, say, NPH, sounds much more rock and roll, so that depends on personal taste. His Hedwig is so emotional and raw, and he really pulled it off. Highly recommend! Also he is very sexy in those hot pants at the end hehe. It also helped that I was in the front row and he laid on my lap."
Broadway,2volvi,tokenfemale,1 point,Fri Feb 13 00:47:31 2015 UTC,"I did...and I thought he was fabulous!   I am a bit sad though, I have a ticket to go next week.

I guess Hedwig is more controversial than being busted (in six ft under) having random unsafe gay parking garage sex ? I loved how they stressed how dangerous and dramatic the unsafe sex aspect was surrounded by such other dramatic madness, that show was done so perfectly. <3   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8_M7i0-7I (vid won't embed, semi nsfw [male gogodancers scantly clad] rave scene from Six Feet Under)"

Broadway,2vntyc,jakaleidoscope,16,Thu Feb 12 16:01:52 2015 UTC,"Hey folks,  I know you're all excited to see it, but if you torrent the L5Y film, it's going to be a lot harder for future musical films to get produced, especially more off-the-beaten-path ones like Last Five Years. So suck it up and wait for a regional release to come your way, pay full price, and send JasonRobertBrown a tweet about it.  Edit: Downvote away, you know that if Jason Robert Brown were here he'd be saying the same thing, and you'd be upvoting it. Don't steal from the composers you love, and don't demand that they personally appeal to you for you to do them the simple courtesy of paying for their product."

Broadway,2vntyc,stephhaddad,3,Thu Feb 12 16:07:38 2015 UTC,It will be released on iTunes on the 13th. I'm sure you can download it there internationally. This also means there will probably be a torrent soon after (if you're into that).

Broadway,2vce6z,NPRPatrick,2,Mon Feb 9 21:34:10 2015 UTC,"Hi, Patrick,  Like hell we would go! Whenever a musical has a live showing in movie theaters, I'm there! I saw Memphis and Company when they were shown through Fathom Events and Direct From Broadway. This would be a wonderful way to make Broadway shows more accessible to the public who either can't pay for expensive Broadway tickets or can't go to NY to C a musical (see what I did there?).  My thoughts on the experience - I think it was surreal. To see the musical in a theatre like that is close to, if not, the best way to see a musical. The problem with going to see a live musical is a) the talent might be off the one night you go b) Normal tourists normally get cheap seats, which end up being nosebleed seats (the one time I saw WICKED live, I thought it was less impressive when I'm higher than Elphaba during defying gravity LOL)  The advantage of a live theatre event like that is the best performances have been spliced together. This means you still get the thrill of live performance, with the best angles thanks to cameras and the the perfection of finding the best performance from each show. It would really be a great way to introduce more people to musical theatre and to see shows they wouldn't see otherwise.   Another problem with Broadway is that the shows are so darn expensive, the normal tourist sees one, maybe two. Showing them through movie theaters gives the fan a chance to see more than they would in NYC. It also opens up more revenue opportunities to the composers and broadcasters - more seats over more states = more cash income! And it would also work for die-hard Broadway fans so that, in the event that a movie adaptation doesn't live up to our impossibly high standards, we can still go back to the live filmed performance.  I hope that helps. If you have anything else regarding the subject, feel free to contact me at writer4ever365@gmail.com. Thanks!"

I was always worried this would happen, and I'm obviously still grateful for the opportunity to see JCM as Hedwig, but a lot of circuitous planning went into getting tickets for his previously-announced final performance, so  I think it's understandable for me (and for my mom who is flying from MO to meet me to see the show) to be a bit disheartened.   It will still be amazing, but a bit of the excitement I was feeling has waned."

It's just that knee-jerk reaction to an aspect that I was really excited about not being in play anymore, lol. My mom and I did the same trip last year to see NPH just because I had no idea if it would get extended and I wasn't going to lose what might have been my only chance to see it on Broadway.

Broadway,2uw2wd,toronto34,1 point,Thu Feb 5 18:09:45 2015 UTC,Yeah but it was great with Lea Salonga and Terry Leung. Does this mean they WON'T be cast?
Broadway,2uw2wd,sanmateomary,1 point,Thu Feb 5 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"It doesn't mean they won't be cast but it doesn't mean they will either. If the director thinks someone didn't do the part well enough for their liking they can cast someone else, or maybe the actors won't want to go to NY from CA which will result in a different actor playing their part. There are a lot of variables when it comes to stuff like this."
Broadway,2uw2wd,minipolliwog,1 point,Thu Feb 5 20:57:21 2015 UTC,"I really hope Lea Salonga will continue with it. I'm not very familiar with Terry Leung, though. And there are more Asian actors on Broadway now, so there are some nice choices.  Anyway, I'm rooting for this!"

I saw it here when it was at The Old Globe and it was a really wonderful and touching show with a lot of potential.

Broadway,2uokyr,saxman481,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:42:34 2015 UTC,"I recently made a chronologically accurate playlist of the 2012 Encores! cast recording of Merrily We Roll Along, and decided to do the same with The Last Five Years. However, there are two tracks that include two songs each, and those songs take place at different times!  Explanation: A Miracle Would Happen takes place just after the wedding, and When You Come Home To Me takes place just before. Goodbye Until Tomorrow takes place at the end of their first date, and I Could Never Rescue You is when Jamie leaves Cathy.  So I fired up Audacity and split them up! A Miracle Would Happen isn't perfect, since When You Come Home To Me is right in the middle, so a smooth transition wasn't really possible, but I did the best I could. Also, I wanted to cut off I Could Never Rescue You before Cathy comes back in for the final big medley part, but there just wasn't a good place to do it without cutting Jamie off prematurely. So that's why I left the the way it is.  Suggested playlist, with why I ordered them the way I did:  Goodbye Until Tomorrow (Cathy at the end of their first date)  Shiksa Goddess (Jamie calling Cathy to ask for a second date - I'm not 100% sold on this order, as it could be him calling after meeting her once to ask her for a first date, but I tried to avoid too many instances of the same person singing twice in a row, and it works either way)  I Can Do Better Than That (Cathy asks Jamie to move in with her)  Moving Too Fast (Jamie says they've already found an apartment together)  Climbing Uphill (Cathy laments her lack of success and confirms they're living together)  The Schmuel Song (Jamie encourages her to keep trying)  When You Come Home To Me (Cathy nails her next audition, feeling inspired and supported)  The Next Ten Minutes (Jamie proposes and they wed)  A Miracle Would Happen (Jamie begins to resent married life, and Cathy is clearly still there, going to his parties with him)  A Summer In Ohio (Cathy leaves for her gig in Ohio and pressures Jamie to visit her)  I'm A Part Of That (Cathy, back in New York and feeling she'll never succeed in acting, resigns herself to just being the wife of a successful author)  If I Didn't Believe In You (Jamie encourages Cathy to keep trying)  Nobody Needs To Know (Jamie cheats while Cathy is again in Ohio)  See I'm Smiling (Cathy is visited by Jamie in Ohio, and expresses her frustration with his distance and her suspicion [or perhaps knowledge] of his cheating)  I Could Never Rescue You (Jamie leaves Cathy)  Still Hurting (Cathy cries)  I just listened to it now, and Jamie's pre-If I Didn't Believe In You yelling is still at the end of Climbing Uphill, but you kids are crazy if you think I'm gonna edit it out (which would mean cutting off the end of the last note), reuploading, and posting a new link for just a few words of yelling."

I was completely consumed by the music, the sets, the dancing, the story - LMM is a freaking genius and if this doesn't win the Tony (once it makes it's inevitable move to Broadway) I'll be SHOCKED. I bought the book the show was inspired by yesterday because I was so swept up by the story. So incredible.

Broadway,2tuvh1,MFoy,1 point,Tue Jan 27 19:15:17 2015 UTC,"Weird that some cancelled for tonight. I was up there a year or so ago when NYC got 14"". My play still happened. Got out afterwords, went to Times Square at 11 pm, and it was a ghost town. It was awesome."
Broadway,2tuvh1,ally-saurus,3,Tue Jan 27 21:39:43 2015 UTC,"A lot of times, the shows simply follow the subways, as far as closures. The logistics of getting the cast and crew to the theater, alone, are daunting in that case. I know that when Hurricane Irene prompted the city to shut down the subways, pretty much all the shows followed suit immediately.   By contrast, back when we had the huge blizzard in 96, trains stayed running and shows for the most part did too. Same in 2010, as far as I recall. I think it depends largely on what call the city makes as far as transit. So I think that as far as shows canceling proactively, it depends a lot on the caution of the city government.   (Not that that explains the Disney shows being closed tonight - just the relatively more cautious approach to closures in general.)"

(Before you chew me out for putting Schwartz, Sondheim, Porter and Gilbert all on the same list, they all have very different styles, but all of them write awesomely clever lyrics.)  Given that a ""glancing blow"" is already an established idiom, I think this line works rather well. You want a weak rhyme? Look at the end of the song. He rhymes ""strange thing"" with ""changing."" Now that's a weak rhyme."

Like others have said, the audience doesn't pay to see you, they pay to see the folks on-stage.   That said, a friend of mine recently saw Phantom, and someone at the far end of her row was singing along. Loudly. Even though she'd gotten lots of dirty looks from the people around her.

I'm not saying he's without guilt, but just saying ""He is a convicted child molester. Debate."" makes it sound a lot worse than it is.

Broadway,2temmg,matthewdov,5,Fri Jan 23 14:38:29 2015 UTC,"I know it sounds like it's just for kids, but The Lion King is pretty great in that ""massive scale epic"" sort of way.   A lot of people also love Beautiful. I thought it was a guaranteed failure when I heard about it but it got stellar reviews and has sold waaaaaay better than I imagined it would.  Kinky Boots is a new fave for many, same with Matilda. And if you venture one block west you can see Avenue Q at New World Stages (off-Broadway), which has been around for ages and which lots of people still enjoy.  A big part of enjoying theater, for me, is remembering that every show is different. Just like how it was sort of like you didn't know what to expect when you walked into Les Mis, and maybe you sort of worried that it would be kind of lame - that's how it is walking into almost any show. No show except Les Mis is as...sweeping and emotionally all-encompassing as Les Mis; no show except BoM is as hysterical as BoM in the same ways as BoM. Every show will leave you feeling different.   It's a bit like how, you know how kids who don't enjoy reading will nonetheless get sucked into Harry Potter, and then ask what they can read that is ""like Harry Potter?"" Really there is only one Harry Potter - it's amazing and totally unique - but that doesn't mean there aren't other great books out there. But it's hard to recommend one if a kid is resistant to the idea of something that isn't ""exactly"" like HP - not in plot but in scope, emotional significance, etc. Try to see some other shows with the same relatively blank slate that you saw the first two with, and see how you like them!"
Broadway,2temmg,ally-saurus,2,Fri Jan 23 17:09:24 2015 UTC,"Wow! Thanks for the lengthy reply. Unlike film or music, where there are decades of movies or albums to cherry-pick from, it seems that the ability to experience the best of theater really comes and goes."
Broadway,2temmg,ally-saurus,1 point,Fri Jan 23 17:56:14 2015 UTC,"No problem!  Yes - that is one of the hardest things about theater, really - that you have to catch it while it's there. It's also one of the riskiest - what if your old favorite show comes back around again, but the new production sucks!? etc. But the come-and-go nature is also one of the most fun things about theater. No two shows are ever the same - I mean even the same show itself, the same production, no two are ever REALLY the same. Some nights an understudy is on, some nights a subbed guitar player, some nights the audience is full and tipsy and laughing uproariously and other nights the audience is all blue-hairs chuckling quietly, if at all. These things all change the show itself - I can say that even doing a show eight times a week over years on end, it was always different in sometimes infinitesimal ways. It's like that old saying: you never stand in the same river twice.    Sometimes I think it is nice, in the age where almost every single thing ever can be located on youtube the morning after it happened, to have something that is still so fleeting, something shared only by the people who were there for it. Sometimes it gets me down. Oh well!  Anyway, back to possible show suggestions, it is sort of cheesy but it bears mentioning: Phantom of the Opera (Broadway production) is a classic by now. It definitely feels dated - holy crap, that synthesizer alone - and is no longer anywhere near the technical marvel it once was, but if you feel like it, it's not a bad one to see. I don't think it holds up as well as Les Mis (which predated Phantom by a bit) even in the unchangeable ways (music, plot, etc) but it's an experience, especially if you are able to remember it in context (ie basically think of seeing it in the 80s).  I get the impression that you're a NYC local, so touring productions are not much of an option (or, let's face it, a need) for you. I hesitate to recommend them to NYers sometimes just because it can be hard for them to live up to the ""caliber"" of the Broadway production, since they face such different obstacles. But if you live within a couple hours of a major touring venue, it might be worth the drive to see the touring productions of Newsies and Pippin, as well. I really loved both of those productions on Broadway and a lot of their charm was talent-based (as opposed to scenic etc) which is easier to translate to a tour. Once was also a scenically subtle show that depended on a great cast and good story-telling, and thus would probably tour well.  Good luck!"

Wicked is what really drew me into musicals and it's a phenomenal extravaganza in terms of music and sets. I love gritty type musicals, and Cabaret has such a fun gritty atmosphere, it's very playful but very dark, and the ending left me stunned and speechless. Chicago is very fun and my mom who isn't into musicals, still talks about how much she enjoyed it years later.   Definitely the best way to experience theatre is live, but since I often can't, I watch a lot of cast recordings. The 2006 production of Company at the Lincoln Centre (it aired on PBS's Greats Performances), is my favourite. It's available on youtube or you can rent it from amazon. The first time I watched it, there were a couple of songs I found a bit boring, but over time, the more carefully I listened to it or had situations that made me relate to the feelings they convey, the more I love it.  I definitely agree with /u/ally-saurus's analogy. You get sucked in by a Harry Potter, and then find out there's such a wide variety of literature in the world, and generations of prolific authors. Maybe once you get into Hemingway or Shakespeare, you may find that you've outgrown some Harry Potter type books, but you'll likely still have a soft spot for it. I certainly found that I was first was drawn to the big, flashy productions but these days, smaller esoteric ones are what I prefer."
Broadway,2temmg,UrNotAMachine,2,Fri Jan 23 22:20:24 2015 UTC,The 2006 cast of company is on broadway not Lincoln center. However I agree that it's brilliant! Also most Sondheim shows have been professionally filmed so those are all highly recommended viewing for OP.

I will also second what /u/ally-saurus said — it's hard to recommend shows that will rival your experiences with Les Miz and BOM. When I saw my first Broadway show (coughnumberofyearsago) and decided I wanted to learn more about musical theatre, I went to my library and borrowed whichever cast recordings looked interesting to me and took a listen. When I found one I liked, I would try and find more that were written by the same composer or from the same time period, and soon I had an enormous musical theatre library of my own and was giving myself a crash course in musical theatre history at the same time. So, listen around and see which shows move you, and, yes, definitely see some more to get an idea of what you like."

Not every show I've seen since has lived up to that (If/Then, I'm looking at you) but most have been incredible in their own right.  Newsies won't make you laugh out loud, but the choreography was incredible. Rock of Ages doesn't pack an emotional wallop, but it's an all-encompassing experience that sweeps you up."

Broadway,2temmg,MandyMay15,1 point,Fri Jan 23 16:53:43 2015 UTC,"Hedwig and the Angry Inch has the best music I've ever heard. The Phantom of the Opera is my favorite but if you liked BOM more than Les Mis, I would say don't bother with it and see Hedwig. My second favorite show is Cabaret, which the music is really good, not amazing, but the story cannot be talked up enough. It takes place in pre-nazi Germany. It's funny, and dramatic, and risque, and sad all at once. I liked Kinky Boots a lot, too. The music was good, the story was good, but the message was the best part.  You should know that BOM is… well… special. If you were into it for its particular use of humor, there's nothing else that's like it on Broadway.  Go see Avenue Q, it's off-Broadway. If it was the music, or the set, or the acting, the shows I mentioned are on par."

Broadway,2t4pnw,Entershakira,15,Wed Jan 21 03:23:10 2015 UTC,"I have been drinking, so you're getting an entirely honest answer here.   It just didn't FEEL right.   I dunno how else to put it. I saw the original cast on Broadway and multiple times on Broadway after, as well as a couple tours in various cities. Always loved it, although definitely appreciated some casts more than others.   The movie felt too slick, too produced. The stage show feels more rough & raw - kids expressing themselves as best they know how. I think of the very end of the show, the flashes of pictures on the screen. Pixelated, but still there, just like Mark produced it. All of the rough edges were lost in the movie to me.   I have seen the movie once. In a theater, the day it opened. I thought it was okay as a movie...but it was missing a spark. I own it, though, as well as the soundtrack. Just...never been compelled to watch or listen again.   I've watched the recording of the stage show a ton, though, it speaks to me much more. The filmed version of the stage show has more heart to me, and is a better representation of the story.   Sorry for rambling, but as someone who loved/loves rent, interesting question, and you got me thinking :)"
Broadway,2t4pnw,tokenfemale,3,Wed Jan 21 03:39:21 2015 UTC,I totally agree with the rawness you said with the old one. The OBC recordings sound very under produced and yes raw where as the movie soundtrack sounds super polished. I appreciate the answer! I never understood the hate for the movie but I had a feeling it was something I wouldn't get since I never saw it on stage.
Broadway,2t4pnw,minipolliwog,12,Wed Jan 21 03:45:10 2015 UTC,"Well, not everyone hated it. Technically it got mixed reviews. The casts were fine in both, I thought. One criticism I've seen is that both stage/movie versions didn't have the best plotting/writing... But there's a historical reason for that, since the original creator Jonathan Larson died on the night of dress rehearsal before previews.  So normally a show goes through previews and is hopefully edited to a better form, right? I read that without Larson, the director and producers had to figure out changes that they believed Larson would approve. Awkward situation. And then the film came along and the director there tried to stay accurate to Larson's vision, but that doesn't always work; the cheesiness/campy factor seems magnified, perhaps.  The actual stage version is extremely minimal to remind the audience of the homelessness. Grey. Bare props like metal tables that the actors moved around themselves and repurposed heavily across scenes. The band was on the stage itself, IIRC. Scenes with actors would cut into another ending scene, actors would stay on stage, and the audience would just have to imagine that it's a different scene...  The entire production had a rough feel that doesn't quite translate to a film spread across clean sets. But I wouldn't say it was terrible either, just different. I did appreciate that they used most of the original cast.  BY THE WAY, the very last show of the original Broadway production (2008) was filmed live, and you can still buy it. It doesn't have the original cast, though I believe they still make an appearance."
Broadway,2t4pnw,RocheCoach,1 point,Wed Jan 21 03:47:20 2015 UTC,"And if you don't want to buy it, you can watch it for free on Youtube!"
Broadway,2t4pnw,gr8ver,4,Tue Feb 17 04:34:16 2015 UTC,"For me, I love the stage show and the movie failed to capture the energy that came with the stage productions by making the scale too large. Everyone looked too well put together to be the struggling artists that they claimed to be and as much as I adore the original cast members, it was too easy to see that they had aged out of their parts -- something that is really easily overlooked onstage due to the distance.  Also, the vocals were super over produced. These are Broadway people! They don't need the tweaking the way movie actors might and especially Adam's voice sounds fried throughout.  He sounded great when I saw him live, but I really dislike how they made him sound in the soundtrack."
Broadway,2t4pnw,minipolliwog,2,Wed Jan 21 09:24:27 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, the sound was definitely a bit overproduced. I had mixed feelings about the release of the movie soundtrack, though hearing the differences in certain tracks was interesting (""Take Me or Leave Me,"" I think Idina Menzel's voice had matured). I also haaaaated Adam Pascal's hair in the movie."
Broadway,2t4pnw,RocheCoach,1 point,Wed Jan 21 22:31:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with this perspective, but in retrospect. These guys auditioned for a stage musical, which has an entirely different set of requirements you would need to audition for a movie. I think the movie version of Light My Candle is sort of the elephant in the room - he sounds like shit in that song. But he sounded exactly how he should have sounded on stage, with the open body and voice projection. He sounded like a rock star, and that was the point. But when he's singing at studio volume, it's just...not his range.   Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp were absolutely the low points of the movie, and it sucks, because they're both really good performers."
Broadway,2t4pnw,LadysPrerogative,4,Tue Feb 17 04:36:12 2015 UTC,"The choices made effected the entire tone of the movie and lost the heart and soul of RENT. It may be a small thing but things like in the Tango Maureen, in the stage production the exchange goes ""I've hired an engineer."" ""Great well nice to have met ..."" ""Wait she's three hours late."" In the movie the gender of the engineer is switched to male for no real reason, and it makes no sense with Joanne being a kickass, feminist, lawyer. She would have hired a female engineer on principle. It just demonstrated a lack of understanding about the characters and the show. Then there is the entire thing about the commitment ceremony that was added. It just didn't fit given the tension most of the characters had with their families. Overall they just missed the mark. Especially when you take La Boheme into consideration. (I was lucky enough to see Rent twice on Broadway and the 2009 tour with Anthony Rapp and Adam Pascal. I also had the privilege of seeing La Boheme at the Metropolitan Opera.)"
Broadway,2t4pnw,yummixx2,1 point,Wed Jan 21 14:28:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the small lyric changes bugged me too. Maybe I'm just being nitpicky at this point, but I hated Idina's delivery of ""Hey mister, she's my sister."" It sounded like a croaky, smoker voice, really different from the high OBC delivery."
Broadway,2t4pnw,LadysPrerogative,2,Wed Jan 21 23:29:29 2015 UTC,The difference in sound from the OBC recording is probably because her voice has changed as she's gotten older. Remember Rent was her first major role and she was around 24. The movie was ten years later.
Broadway,2t4pnw,minipolliwog,1 point,Thu Jan 22 02:39:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. People's voices change with age, not just in puberty. Her voice was definitely different in the movie. And her voice now sounds different in If/Then compared to back then."

Broadway,2t4pnw,yummixx2,2,Wed Jan 21 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say I hated the movie. However, the stage version just seemed to nail the feel the story was going for (Like how the set design was minimalist and intentionally cheap looking). Plus, the music is definitely more true to the time setting. The movie was more polished, which is normally a good thing, but in this case, it works against the story. I will say, though, I preferred some of the movie's vocals over the stage vocals."
Broadway,2t4pnw,SCurry34,2,Wed Jan 21 23:23:35 2015 UTC,"I think I'll be in the minority given the other comments, but I enjoyed Rent greatly. However: I was in high school when it came out, hadn't seen the stage version, and was just starting to get ridiculously into musicals. So I feel like I was exactly who they were targeting. When I finally saw the recorded last show of Rent, I realized just how different the two were, and I feel like anyone who knew and loved Rent as a stage show would have at least a few issues with Rent the movie. Some things just don't translate as well to film, and the raw edge and desperation of the lifestyle seen in Rent was one of them."

Broadway,2t4pnw,minipolliwog,5,Wed Jan 21 03:58:47 2015 UTC,"Considering how a number of Broadway actors were hired for that (I never saw it), I wonder if they were trying to do an homage?"

How do I choose?!""  Any director worth their salt would've chosen Ivy in a heartbeat for that role, and if they took an entire season to make up their minds, everyone in the Broadway rumor mill would've immediately taken the stance of ""oh, he's obviously just trying to get into the farm girl's pants""."

I went in having seen only that little clip of her doing this song and thought ""It's going to be just okay, but I can live with that.""  The movie (I thought) is fanfuckingtastic. One of the most faithful adaptations I've ever seen, great use of the original material, great little cheeky bits, and it is visually STUNNING. A gorgeous movie in every way. They've done some things with the film that just aren't possible on the stage but that bring the songs to life in a whole new way (a part of that, summer in Ohio). JRB said during the q&a that he cried when he saw ""a part of that"" because they had managed to do with it what he had always wanted to convey on stage but that he couldn't due to the show's format.   They also did something really lovely with my favourite song, ""if I didn't believe in you"". That one had a lot of the audience reaching for Kleenex or holding our breath. I wasn't a Jeremy Jordan fan before this film, but now I can really dig it.  I hope you end up loving it as much as I did!"

Broadway,2szyng,tatamama,6,Tue Jan 20 00:57:37 2015 UTC,"O Cabaret! I can answer this!  1) For this show, anything as long as your bits are covered. It's a cool venue, set up with cabaret tables and the like. Warning - you will not get a playbill until the end of the show. 2) 30ish minutes should be fine. 3) Theatre opens an hour before curtain. You can purchase drinks and snacks from your waiter/waitress, who will be appropriately dressed in skimpy black clothes. The actors will come out and stretch and you will be very excited.  Most of all - have fun! Cabaret is great, Alan is great, Danny Burstein is the most amazing actor you can see onstage now, and you will have a GREAT time."
Broadway,2szyng,icancook2,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:51:18 2015 UTC,I was curious about the playbills--why were they handed out at the end?

Broadway,2szyng,youdontlookitalian,2,Fri Jan 30 04:42:13 2015 UTC,"1) literally anything. I've gone to shows in dresses and I've gone in pajamas, it's about the show, not you. However in Cabaret right after the intermission 2 people in the orchestra go on stage, so you probably don't want to go in pajamas. 2) half hour to an hour depending on your speed. 3) as long as you're in the doors 1 or 2 minutes before showtime you're good, especially with the unconventional seating since there are tables and you don't need to crawl over people. I prefer to get in a little after when the doors open, so like 30 minutes before showtime.  Go to the stage door when I saw Caberet in was a matinee so Alan Cumming and Michelle Williams didn't come out, but they sent pre-signed playbills out for the people waiting. I don't know if he and Emma Stone do that now, but it's worth a shot."
Broadway,2szyng,GlobindobinButler,2,Tue Jan 20 16:23:49 2015 UTC,"I dress as nice as my ticket price. if i paid full price, i'll dress up! if i got cheap seats, even if they're orchestra, i'll usually wind up casual.  Gramercy park is pretty close to midtown west, but studio 54 is on the north end of the theater district. also you're traveling during the same time everyone else is trying to get to the theater district. I would leave 45 minutes, but it also depends on whether you're walking, taking the train, or taking a cab. cabs can be excruciatingly slow in midtown pre-theater.  As long as you have your ticket, you don't need to be early; in fact, i usually hang out at a bar (if you drink) beforehand because the drinks at bway shows are VERY VERY VERY EXPENSIVE (My husband ordered a double of something when we went to cabaret and luckily i asked the price before they made it. thirty bucks for top shelf liquor, 25 for a large glass of wine). Also the lines to the bathrooms are crazy and very very long.   try not to bring a lot of stuff. seating esp in the orchestra for that show can be very cramped.  also: they may do a bag check and ask you to dump out any water bottles or any liquid.   cabaret is super fun, have a great time!"
Broadway,2szyng,alexlady,2,Tue Jan 20 17:45:40 2015 UTC,"You're going to have a great time. I saw it last year with Michelle Williams and I just bought tickets to see it again with Sienna Miller. Everyone else has covered the basics.   If you're interested in a meet with the actors, the stage door to Studio 54 is down the street. If you're exiting the main doors onto W54, exit left and take your first left. You should see crowd barricades about halfway down the block.   Alan did not pose for pictures but did sign Playbills. Michelle Williams did both (and was a total sweetheart.)  Enjoy!"

No one really cares how you're dressed, but generally semi-formal attire will suffice. It's an occasion to dress nice, if you so choose.  -Can't help there, sorry. Only visit NYC on occasion, and haven't done enough to really know travel times. Maybe like 45 minutes before you want to arrive?  -House opens (aka you can enter the theater) typically 30 minutes before the show starts, so try to aim for arriving 30 minutes early at the least in the event of unexpected delays.  -If you want signed things (such as any purchased memorabilia or the Playbill given to you at the very least), go to the Stage Door after the show. Many of the actors exit from that door as a way to meet/interact with fans and give out signatures.  -Everything gets more expensive the closer you are to Times Square.  -NEVER TRAVEL ALONE  -Don't talk to the people handing out books/cds/etc on the street. The reason New Yorkers are stereotyped as cold and unapproachable is because the people who approach strangers on the street are usually scam artists."

It will also cause delusions in large doses and can kill you eventually.  As a working actor who loves what I do I see far too many young people with the attitude of ""I love acting, and I'll do it until the day I die and if other people can't handle that then screw them.""  Yes, that's true.  Its also incomplete.  You also need to be talented.  For every persecuted genius in the theater community there are 9 people whose friends and family are legitimately looking for the kind way to communicate that they probably don't have what it takes to make it in the world of performing.  Maybe this is just me getting cynical, but this attitude of ""Never give up on your dreams, hang those who talk of less"" will only get you so far if your talent can't prop up your dreams.

Broadway,2sntxp,adamshell,3,Fri Jan 16 22:32:58 2015 UTC,I agree. Although I do think it's weird that Idina's understudy is Jenn Colella considering she's a lead in the show as well.
Broadway,2sntxp,adamshell,10,Fri Jan 16 21:04:50 2015 UTC,"Jackie Burns is Menzel's standby.  It's a shame that she's not going to be able to take the week.  Quite frankly, I think her voice is better suited to the role."

Broadway,2sntxp,melcrawmeow,3,Sat Jan 17 08:58:55 2015 UTC,This must really be upsetting to her. It's a shame that she doesn't get a chance just because audiences are so desperate to see Elsa from Frozen. It's not like this is a one woman show.
Broadway,2sntxp,adamshell,2,Sat Jan 17 22:07:30 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that she knows that it comes with the territory.  And it's not like she hasn't existed in Idina Menzel's shadow before-- Burns played Elphaba in Wicked for a long time, but every time someone listened to the cast recording, they'd hear Menzel.  It's just frustrating for fans of Broadway and fans of Burns (like myself) but this is the way the business works.  I'm fortunate that I had the opportunity to see her last summer during Broadway in Bryant Park sing songs from If/Then.  She killed it.  Way better than Idina Menzel for this particular show / part.  I was actually a little let down when I saw the show, but part of that is because I just didn't think it was executed well-- a problem that both Menzel and Burns wouldn't be able to fix."
Broadway,2sntxp,melcrawmeow,0,Sat Jan 17 22:13:29 2015 UTC,"I'm sure she knows it comes with the territory, and a ton of people have played Elphaba at this point, but that doesn't mean it's not a disappointment for her."
Broadway,2sntxp,minipolliwog,0,Sat Jan 17 22:16:50 2015 UTC,"Get a chance? Jackie Burns has had many chances already, but the incoming audiences have spoken by way of refund line... With tourists taking up 70% of Broadway audiences, Idina Menzel just has that much more star power over other Broadway actresses like Jackie. Besides, I'll bet she's contracted to a pretty penny to just sit and wait.   I have my doubts that this is upsetting to her. Jackie has stated in a few interviews already about how difficult it is to be the stand-by for Idina Menzel's Broadway return where the audience is noticeably and sometimes very vocally disappointed when she comes on for the  headliner. It's a different kind of stress. She was even told in her face by a couple tourists how much they did NOT want to see her. Dang. Being a stand-by in this situation, which the producers did not foresee at all with Frozen (however, If/Then is NOT child-friendly AT ALL, so most of the audience is actually familiar with Idina from Wicked), is extremely trying for one's self-esteem, I imagine. Jackie is a trooper, but an entire week of half-houses would be depressing too. She'll get her own show in the future.  Though frankly, seeing the abuse Idina Menzel gets across social media when she misses is rather incredible too. I just don't understand people. It's not like anyone WANTS to get sick.  @adamshell: It's literally not possible for Jackie Burns to be ""better"" than Idina Menzel in a show developed entirely around the latter's singing and acting (and the other leads, obviously). Rather, you personally prefer Jackie's voice or different take on the singing (not acting since you didn't see that, I guess).  Anyway, another note about the dark week, January-February are brutal for Broadway shows, so while they let Jackie come on for several planned dates last year, this coming week would've been a particularly low point with Idina anyway."
Broadway,2sntxp,melcrawmeow,0,Sun Jan 18 02:47:06 2015 UTC,"Jesus. Didn't really need to read a book about your take of the broadway business, which you state in another comment that you're not a part of.

Broadway,2sntxp,minipolliwog,1 point,Sun Jan 18 02:55:56 2015 UTC,"I wasn't replying to only your post, but specifically you don't follow the interviews for the cast, so I pointed out what Jackie Burns herself has said about her experiences as the stand-by (thus a more educated opinion).  Also, only the detailed financial aspects require being in the business. It's entirely possible to learn a lot about how Broadway works without actually being in the business, don't you know that?"
Broadway,2sntxp,ryanispomp,3,Sun Jan 18 03:15:49 2015 UTC,"As a Broadway newbie, I get the sense that this doesn't happen much... but has it happened ever? I'm sure a show has been paused for more significant reasons, but I can't imagine a show actually taking a week off because its star is."
Broadway,2sntxp,minipolliwog,5,Sat Jan 17 01:58:47 2015 UTC,"Jackie Burns is the stand-by while Jenn Colella is the understudy who chose not to be listed in the playbill. Jenn has gone on exactly once when all freaky conditions were met (I think Idina taking ill, Jackie Burns out for family emergency).  For going dark, keep in mind that Idina Menzel is the headliner. Headlining a Broadway show has different expectations compared to merely being a lead. If the headliner isn't in a show, the audience is offered a REFUND. The producers for If/Then went further to offer a second show voucher (when Idina would be on) to people who chose to stay and watch the show with the stand-by, extremely generous.   But look at how the marketing is and the type of audience the show has attracted, which wasn't what the producers intended, probably. Every time Jackie Burns (and Jenn once) went on, the refund line was horrendous and weekly grosses took a significant hit. Normally the stand-by only has to cover a couple days here and there for illness, but Jackie Burns DID go on for at least one scheduled vacation, and that week's grosses weren't pretty either even when her fans knew about it ahead of time. I felt bad for Jackie, and felt bad for the cast in general.   FWIW, I did like the show and thought the writing was intriguing (didn't find it confusing except for one spot), but for a show with mixed reviews and no Tony wins, people are going to bet a whole lot more on the star draw.  So If/Then going dark that week makes total sense. This isn't the only show that has done that when a headliner is out, but I can't remember the other examples off the top of my head. Broadway shows live and die by their weekly grosses, but it's also important to keep in mind that around 75% of Broadway shows close without recouping (""flops""). If/Then's run is rather average there."

Broadway,2sntxp,minipolliwog,1 point,Sat Jan 17 05:58:46 2015 UTC,"The cast gets paid vacations after working so many number of shows, so it's probably that. Not to mention theatre rental still costs money, so the actual equation probably looks something like this: (net profit) = (gross ticket sales) - ((salaries) + (rental) + (actual running costs))  Given the producers' decision, their math likely shows that (gross ticket sales) falls too much to offset (actual running costs) when Jackie is on. This way, they'd lose less.  Note: I'm going off various things I've read about these situations and am not actually in the business (Broadway business looks seriously way too stressful)."

Yeah maybe he took advantage, but so did this girl (wanting to jump start her career) who by the way went to his house a month later for another encounter and sent him numerous friendly emails thanking him over the next four years, into adulthood. She didn't go looking for legal action till James received an inheritance. These are the reasons he was able to make a plea for so little jail time. This wasn't child molestation, it was jailbait.  He did his time, he has spent 8 years with a stunted career because of it. He had had no incidents since then. Maybe its time to stop looking at everything as black and white and treating our justice system likes its purpose is some permanent means of self satisfaction for the victim.

Broadway,2s855r,piratelemonade,5,Thu Jan 15 06:17:18 2015 UTC,...Isn't he a bass?
Broadway,2s855r,Yoyti,3,Tue Jan 13 11:41:55 2015 UTC,"The highest note the phantom sings is an Ab, which a bass/baritone with a strong upper range should be able to hit."
Broadway,2s855r,broadway_bro,2,Tue Jan 13 13:47:29 2015 UTC,"Ab4 (I'm assuming you're talking 4) is not in bass range. That is a baritone note tops. As a bass, and singing in a choir with over a dozen other basses, I assure you, our highest regular note is an E4. I don't know what bass rep you've been reading, but even the most evil composers don't take us above an F4. There's a word for the sort of ""bass with strong upper range"" you're talking about. It's baritone.  Also, Phantom only goes to an Ab4? That seems extraordinarily low for ALW..."
Broadway,2s855r,Yoyti,2,Tue Jan 13 21:22:43 2015 UTC,"Choral music and vocal training is very different from musical theatre ( I've done a lot of both). I have friends who are basses who can sing pretty high as well (one friend ranges from around B1-the highest I've heard him sing is G but it wasn't strained, and the other ranges from around B1 to c#2 to a high A.   Now of course I'm not saying it extremely easy for them, of course they can't sing those high notes as easily as I can (I sing tenor 1) But basses have inherently huge ranges because their vocal cords are stretched the most (or something to that effect don't exactly remember the exact reason why)  Now yes the ordinary bass shouldn't be able to sing that, but basses who are trained in musical theatre have especially strengthened  higher registers (that's really true for all music theatre singers, I can sing up to a Bb or B, the other tenors I know who are only choral singers struggle with F#s and Gs)."

We just barely made it to TKTS by 7pm and had only a very small number of options for shows starting 7:30pm or later. We chose Rock of Ages for no real reason, but the show was incredibly well done and so funny I was literally laughing out loud.  I hadn't really done much research on the show and didn't expect to like it because I'm not really a fan of the 80's rock scene and that much noise tends to make my head hurt, but it was absolutely incredible."
Broadway,2s56ud,rachycarebear,3,Tue Jan 13 18:38:18 2015 UTC,"I saw Rock of Ages without knowing too much about it and it was fantastic! So happy I went, even if the seats weren't great.  On the flip side, I went to see Mamma Mia because I'd heard such great things about it and loved the movie, and I hated it! Very disappointed, I don't know why I didn't enjoy it really, I just felt it was really boring and a bit of a let down. And I chose that over seeing Bonnie and Clyde which is now one of my favourite soundtracks :("
Broadway,2s56ud,saint_tami,2,Mon Jan 12 10:34:51 2015 UTC,Mamma Mia is one of the only shows I have ever desperately wanted to be over as soon as it started. Bonnie and Clyde however was well done.

We decided to go at the last minute for an anniversary weekend. Enjoyed the staging and actors, but what got me most was the fact that the arrangements and orchestrations were practically 100% true to the original 70s album. So the fuzzy guitar tones, electric pianos, etc, were all there, just like they are burned in my brain from decades of listening to that album. Loved it.  OK, so I guess I didn't answer the real question, but honestly, I didn't know what to expect from a 2012 production of a 1970s show."

I had rolled over it since I had heard it was largely about a bunch of people getting together and recording an album, which didn't really strike me as a story I'd be interested in. It seemed too jukebox, and since I'm not a huge fan of that style of music, I never really bothered to look into it. But when my grandparents called and asked if I wanted to go see Once with them, well, I'm not about to turn down a day at the theater with the family.  And I was awestruck. I don't think it was the best show at any individual thing. I've heard better scores, read better books, seen better stages, but not many, and it was just so well executed.

Also if your in the city you could try rushing the show. The tickets are about $40 each that way but you'll have to wait in the cold for the box office to open.
Broadway,2s5e6q,Erjr95,2,Mon Jan 12 16:52:31 2015 UTC,what do you mean by rushing the show?
Broadway,2s5e6q,Erjr95,1 point,Mon Jan 12 17:12:38 2015 UTC,Rush tickets are a selection of tickets made available to the public on the day of the show starting when the box office opens. Many different shows have rush policy's. Most range from $25 to $50 with a limit of two per person. Also some rush may be limited to students with a valid ID only. Most shows will have their rush policy on their website.
Broadway,2s5e6q,BU_Rob13,1 point,Tue Jan 13 02:00:11 2015 UTC,"Actually, you can't rush Aladdin. Aladdin offers a lottery system, not rush tickets.  Show up at the theatre 2.5 hours before the show you want to see. Don't be late! You'll each (both you AND your boyfriend) put your name in the drawing for tickets. They'll draw names 2 hours before the show. If either one of you have your name drawn, you'll be able to purchase two tickets to see the show for $30 each. They can be anywhere in the theatre, and I mean ANYWHERE, from partial view to front row orchestra. They will not necessarily be together, but they will generally be in the same section.  This is by far the cheapest way to see the show.  NOTE: Aladdin takes cash only for lottery tickets. BRING CASH.

Broadway,2s0g5j,rachycarebear,15,Sun Jan 11 00:09:53 2015 UTC,"I am disappointed in how soon shows close on Broadway these days, but I can't say I am surprised. It's a very good cast in a sadly mediocre and predictable show. I'm glad I saw it, but once was enough."
Broadway,2s0g5j,saint_tami,6,Sun Jan 11 01:28:39 2015 UTC,"Generally I'd agree with you that shows close really soon, but in this case I'm not sad to see it go - in my opinion, the show really wasn't that good and just limped along due to an all star cast. I'm excited to see what'll take its place as there's a decent chance it'll be a better show."
Broadway,2s0g5j,stopbuffering,7,Sun Jan 11 02:01:57 2015 UTC,Yea this show was only surviving due to Idina's name. I was passing by it one day(matinee time) when she wasn't in and they were warning people outside that she wasn't in it for that performance then explained how to get refunded. I have never seen that done before for a show.
Broadway,2s0g5j,stopbuffering,4,Sun Jan 11 03:28:59 2015 UTC,I think the general rule is if there's an understudy for an actor/actress who's name is above the title you can ask for a refund. I'm pretty sure this isn't set in stone but I've heard it mentioned a few times in different places and Jeremy Jordan mentioned it in one of his interviews as a typical guideline theaters follow.
Broadway,2s0g5j,saint_tami,4,Sun Jan 11 10:34:56 2015 UTC,Yea I think your right. It's just unusual for them to stop you before you enter the theatre to let you know she's not in.
Broadway,2s0g5j,stopbuffering,3,Sun Jan 11 15:06:15 2015 UTC,"It is, but I can understand why. They probably didn't one time and had people get to their seats and not realize the change until it was announced. Then the show was stalled because so many people walked out right after the announcement. Or they figured that would happen and wanted to prevent an issue like that."
Broadway,2s0g5j,BU_Rob13,2,Sun Jan 11 15:39:09 2015 UTC,"My immediate reaction to hearing about the understudy was ""well if she is good enough to understudy for Idina, she is probably amazing."" No need for refunds."
Broadway,2s0g5j,saint_tami,2,Sun Jan 11 15:45:07 2015 UTC,"Unless they could guarantee I could see Idina in another performance before I left New York then maybe I'd ask to view a different performance but I'm with you, I'd like to just see the show."
Broadway,2s0g5j,saint_tami,3,Sun Jan 11 15:55:37 2015 UTC,"I had tickets for a day when Idina was out, and their policy gives you three options.  1) Full refund, as long as you get it before curtain time.  2) Replacement tickets, for a show of your choice, in the same section or better. Call the box office to receive them within 7 days of the show you want to see, and they'll put you on the list to get them unless it's sold out.  3) See the show with the understudy AND receive replacement tickets, same as above. No additional cost.  That third option blew my mind a little bit."
Broadway,2s0g5j,Yoyti,2,Thu Jan 15 09:06:29 2015 UTC,I have heard this a few times as well. I believe it is true.
Broadway,2s0g5j,BU_Rob13,8,Sun Jan 11 15:45:31 2015 UTC,I think they also got lucky with the timing of the whole Let It Go/Oscars/Adele Dazeem thing that ratcheted up her fame.
Broadway,2s0g5j,Yoyti,3,Sun Jan 11 05:36:36 2015 UTC,"She AND Anthony Rapp were out the day I saw it and they passed out a little flyer about how to work the refund if you wanted it. I think the less savvy in the audience assumed Jackie was Idina anyway as they look and sound almost identical from the audience. Jackie was great, by the way."
Broadway,2s0g5j,BU_Rob13,2,Sun Jan 11 04:19:31 2015 UTC,This was the day that Jen Colella took over...I only know this because I think broadway.com tweeted it.
Broadway,2s0g5j,RolandKa,2,Sun Jan 11 04:30:45 2015 UTC,"My aunt said that if it hadn't been announced, she would have believed Jackie Burns was Idina Menzel on an off day. She also agreed that Jackie Burns and the show was awesome."
Broadway,2s0g5j,Yoyti,3,Sun Jan 11 13:15:43 2015 UTC,"Actually, they go even further than that. I had tickets for a day when Idina was out, and their policy gives you three options.  1) Full refund, as long as you get it before curtain time.  2) Replacement tickets, for a show of your choice, in the same section or better.

Broadway,2s0g5j,TownCrier73,2,Thu Jan 15 09:05:38 2015 UTC,"I was at one of those performances. I didn't go for the refund. I saw the show and loved it with or without Idina Menzel. My parents saw years ago a revival of Forum starring Nathan Lane, and he was out at the performance they saw, and refunds were offered. They didn't go for it, saw the show, and loved it with or without Nathan Lane."
Broadway,2s0g5j,Yoyti,3,Sun Jan 11 13:17:28 2015 UTC,"Basically, this. I'm surprised that it closed because I expected Idina Menzel to carry it further by virtue of her name alone, but I'm not really saddened by it. I found the music fairly mediocre and the story predictable. The best part of the musical was the cast and the premise, which I think had strong potential."
Broadway,2s0g5j,Yoyti,10,Thu Jan 15 09:03:08 2015 UTC,"This show has some clever elements but its always been ""The Idina Menzel Musical"".  It doesn't have the legs without her."
Broadway,2s0g5j,saint_tami,4,Sun Jan 11 07:15:53 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm the only person here who actually liked If/Then. I didn't even see Idina Menzel! I saw Jackie Burns and she and the show blew me away! There were a couple of rough patches (I didn't really like the last scene), but on the whole it was a terrific experience. The book was well woven together, the score was fantastic (Except the sign song. I'm not quite sure what the deal with that was), and the whole cast, not just Idina Menzel (whom I didn't even see) was incredible. It's also the first time I've seen a show and really appreciated the lighting design.  I guess in a way, If/Then is the next iteration of Allegro and Merrily We Roll Along (especially in the being confusing and not lasting long on Broadway), except this time the protagonist is cynical from the start. Is that part of why the show was a failure? Broadway audiences no longer want stories of cynical people learning to give the world a shot, they want stories like Pippin or Chicago or Wicked or Phantom about idealists becoming disillusioned with the world. Even the comedies on Broadway, Gentleman's Guide, Book Of Mormon, tend toward the cynical. Maybe if If/Then were told backwards..."
Broadway,2s0g5j,BU_Rob13,7,Sun Jan 11 13:12:12 2015 UTC,If/Then is the next iteration of Allegro and Merrily We Roll Along   If/Then is no Merrily We Roll Along

Broadway,2rsr95,Pianoman338,17,Thu Jan 8 23:38:31 2015 UTC,"Another discussion point: in a lot of stage-musicals-turned-movies they cut out or de-emphasize songs in order to cut down on time (Into the Woods, Grease, Cabaret, for a few examples). Since Wicked runs for about 2 and a half hours, do we think they would shorten it at all? Remove any songs or move them to the background?"
Broadway,2rsr95,PlanetXpressDelivers,6,Fri Jan 9 02:25:55 2015 UTC,"In terms of songs, I'm guessing that, if anything, they'll cut ""Dear Old Shiz"" (it's like a minute long and not really relevant to anything).  Maybe bridge the gap between Act 1 and Act 2 more smoothly, with a shorter passage of time like they did for Into the Woods (rather than a couple of months? weeks? that it is with the intermission).  Overall, though, I honestly am not sure what they would cut."
Broadway,2rsr95,Frodoholic,4,Fri Jan 9 02:48:18 2015 UTC,The ending songs for Act 1 and the beginning songs for Act 2 are always awkward because they are relatively unnecessary in movies since there are no breaks.
Broadway,2rsr95,Pit_Player,5,Fri Jan 9 03:49:55 2015 UTC,"The problem is that they tend to be (some of) the most dramatic songs in the show (especially for Wicked, everyone knows Defying Gravity) so cutting them out is usually a bad idea."
Broadway,2rsr95,Frodoholic,10,Fri Jan 9 05:59:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they obviously wouldn't cut Defying Gravity lol."
Broadway,2rsr95,Yoyti,1 point,Fri Jan 9 06:21:34 2015 UTC,"It works for Wicked, though, because Act II opens with just as much intensity, so they can bridge them pretty easily.

Broadway,2rsr95,Rawrzimon,8,Sat Jan 10 01:22:33 2015 UTC,Or I think it'll play in the background as they're coming to school.

Even if the opening wasn't cut, No One Mourns The Wicked can still be cut down. One Short Day will also probably be cut down. The Wizomania bit doesn't even really make much sense on stage, so I don't see why it should make any sense at all on film. Dancing Through Life and Thank Goodness can also probably be partially cut down.  As for cut altogether, Dear Old Shiz, Something Bad and A Sentimental Man can probably all be cut completely without too much fuss."

Broadway,2rsr95,katiekilobyte,14,Fri Jan 9 02:46:01 2015 UTC,But Lea Michele is the young Idina! She has to have every role that Idina ever had!! Ryan Murphy has anointed her! /s
Broadway,2rsr95,Rawrzimon,11,Fri Jan 9 03:33:13 2015 UTC,"I actually think Lea Michele would make a good Nessarose. She's got that kinda mean look to her, or she could in the right role.  If they're gonna have known names in the show, I would love Beth Behrs to play Glinda, she's playing almost the same character on 2 Broke Girls and nails is, and IMDB says she can sing. Brittany Snow would nail the part but I don't think her voice is strong enough for the character. Evan Rachel Wood could be a good choice as well but again I don't know how strong her voice is.  Anna Kendrick could be a good Elphaba, we know she can sing the part cause she's sung For Good on stage with Kristin Chenoweth and definitely held her own. I think Naya Rivera would be great, she's a great actress (definitely one of, if not the most talented from the Glee cast), and while she's mostly played the sexy roles I think she could pull off the reserved Elphaba. Abbie Cornish suits the part. Zoe Saldana too. I love the Lupita N'Yongo suggestion from /u/Rawrzimon!  Jeremy Jordan for Fiyero because he'll be coming off the (hopefully!) success of The Last Five Years.   Darren Criss would make a cute Boq, and no one could deny that he'd bring in an audience, Daniel Radcliffe would be my top choice though, and Jonathan Groff would be good too.  I've always imagined the studios would pick Meryl Streep for Madame Morrible, especially after Mamma Mia, and she'd do it well. Emma Thompson or Ellen Burstyn would be good too.  Stephen Fry, Geoffrey Rush, Daniel Day Lewis, Ben Kingsley and Richard Gere would all make good Wizards, but Joel Grey is pretty famous enough to re cast in the movie (if he's still acting?)  Hugh Laurie as Doctor Dillamonde please. Jeremy Irons also good.  It wouldn't surprise me if they try to fit musical golden boy Hugh Jackman in there, and I think it'd be fun if he did a sort of cameo as Elphaba's father in the opening. But I can also see them cutting that whole thing so who knows.  Of course I would love to see a slew of Broadway actors and actresses get the parts, but realistically a big movie studio isn't gonna take a chance on a total ""unkown"" cast. I think the main three will be names people know, and I'm sure much of the ensemble, but I'd really prefer if at least Elphaba was a Broadway vet. I think it draws you more into the story when you're watching the character and not the actor up there.   DO NOT WANT: Any Disney kids or boy bands, that means no Demi Lovato, Selena Gomes, Zac Efron, Justin Bieber, Harry Styles or any of One Direction, Cody Simpson, Miley Cyrus, Debby Ryan, Vanessa Hudgens, etc and so on and so forth. Just, NO.  EDIT: Fixing some formatting.  EDIT 2: This is also assuming all these people can sing!"
Broadway,2rsr95,northsoutheastwest7,2,Fri Jan 9 12:48:16 2015 UTC,"Daniel Radcliffe   Yes I was thinking him for Boq too! I had the great pleasure and honor of seeing him from great seats in How to Succeed and it will forever be one of the most astounding performances (thx to the entire cast, esp Rose Hemingway & Mary Faber ) of any show I've seen. I bet he has his eye on it. I'd have no qualms if it happened!"
Broadway,2rsr95,cassby916,2,Sat Jan 10 03:41:39 2015 UTC,"I got to see him on Broadway too, it was one of the best shows I've ever seen. I was lucky enough to see Darren Criss too, and while both performances were great, I really liked the kind of innocence Dan's Finch had, how he kind of seemed to fall into the situations he does, but then the spotlight shines on him and he smiles at the audience and you know it's worked out how he planned. Darren's Finch in contrast seemed more manipulative. Rose Hemingway became one of my favourites too because of the show, she was just great. I probably enjoyed her more than John Laroquette (and definitely more than Beau Bridges!).  If they made a How To Succeed... movie I'd love Daniel, Rose, John and everyone to do it!"
Broadway,2rsr95,Adelaidey,1 point,Sat Jan 10 10:00:52 2015 UTC,"Yes! I've seen clips of Darren and agree, I love him though.   I can so clearly heard Daniel's finch voice singing ""Because you are so beautifuuuuulll!"" to Nessa. :)   Agree with that if they made a Succeed movie too. John was FANTASTIC as well. I loved how he made silly gestures in his chair when the scenes ended and pulled offstage, showed he was clearly loving what he was doing and having a blast. I nearly peed myself many times during their Old Ivy/Chipmunk scene, lordy. Just their astronomical height difference alone was comedy genius not to mention their incredible talents and stamina! I felt like I needed a nap after it, some of Dans sweat hit my face when he swung his head/hair once and I felt so bad for him bc i'd seen him in interviews before the show mention how sweaty he gets, it was like a water park up there!"

Broadway,2rsr95,Yoyti,6,Fri Jan 9 06:02:30 2015 UTC,"Please, not Demi.  She's already tried to channel Idina once.  I sort of think Samantha Barks could do it.  She's really had a chance to prove her chops, but I don't know if she has the name recognition for Hollywood."

Broadway,2rsr95,Yoyti,1 point,Fri Jan 9 18:30:59 2015 UTC,"I don't really know who I want as Elphaba. Samantha Barks could be good. Maybe even Sutton Foster, though she might be a bit bright.  For Galinda, Leigh Ann Larkin. (Actually, come to think of it, she might not be a bad Elphaba either.)  Fiyero leaves room to stunt cast. Jeremy Jordan could be good. Or Neil Patrick Harris for a super big name. (Or he could be good as Boq.)  For Boq, again, stunt casting room. Daniel Radcliffe could pull it off. Or possibly Jim Parsons.  For the Wizard and Madame Morrible, since it's not going to be an active run, eight shows a week, we can probably work in some older theater legends. Joel Grey could even reprise his role as the Wizard maybe. Or George Hearn. As Madame Morrible, for some theater stunt casting, maybe Angela Lansbury or Julie Andrews?  Younger choices for the wizard could be Boyd Gaines or Christian Borle (who also might not make a bad Boq. He perhaps looks a little old for the role, but then makeup and CGI and all that stuff.)  (Also, I would kill to see a production of Wicked with an older cast. Specifically, Patti Lupone as Elphaba and Bernadette Peters as Galinda. If for no other reason than it would be endlessly amusing.)"

Broadway,2rsr95,nerfherder912,1 point,Fri Jan 9 02:01:14 2015 UTC,"so to throw out a theory.  I saw the announcement of the movie from Kristin Chenowith's facebook page, and then like 5 minutes later there was an announcement on Idina's facebook page saying that the If/Then musical is ending the run March 22.  Possibility that it could be an original cast?"
Broadway,2rsr95,Entershakira,3,Sat Jan 10 00:54:36 2015 UTC,"This makes me sad, because If/Then was easily one of my favorite Broadway experiences. Even without seeing Idina Menzel (and Jackie Burns was terrific) the show was magnificent. Terrific book, terrific score, terrific cast, terrific direction, pretty good sets, the costumes were kind of generic, but it's a musical about normal people in NYC with little reason to dress like anything special. First time I've really appreciated lighting design in a show too. The only thing I really didn't like was the last scene.  Even so, I doubt it, because even if Idina Menzel was going to be in the Wicked movie, that's no reason for the whole show to close. Jackie Burns was fantastic when I saw the show. Idina may be awesome, but she's not irreplaceable. Case in point: Wicked has been running strong a decade without her."

Don't learn something just for this audition unless you are specifically asked too.   Don't Worry if you don't get to finish your song, being cut off doesn't mean they hate you! It just means they've seen enough, for better or worse.  Mostly just be ready for a really stressful/boring time. Those things are Massive, and you will do a lot of sitting.

But thanks for setting up that expectation. It'll save me some heartache down the road."
Broadway,2ro7b4,missfarin,2,Thu Jan 8 21:05:51 2015 UTC,"Marking your music pretty much just means making sure your cuts are clearly visible, noting down any rests or holds you might be taking, tempo changes etc. The pianist has less than 30 secs to look it over and he/she will just barrel through it as best they can. Being clearly marked just make sure they play it the way you want them too.  Break a leg at the audition!"
Broadway,2ro7b4,missfarin,1 point,Thu Jan 8 21:11:55 2015 UTC,Piggybacking: also make sure to be clear about the tempo of the song when you give your music to the accompanist. I used to tap it out softly against my thigh while singing a tiny bit from the first bar.

Broadway,2ro7b4,ThatGirlWithTheBook,4,Thu Jan 8 21:24:18 2015 UTC,"Everyone's given great advice. I have two last bits:   In addition to preparing a song you're comfortable with, make sure it has a solid 16-bar and 8-bar cut. It will be tempting to choose an 8-bar cut that shows off your biggest notes, but I've been at auditions where casting directors say outright that they would much rather see a cut that shows acting range, as opposed to having you scream at them. If they don't specify how many bars to sing, you can usually go for a whole song, as long as it's not something like Meadowlark, but if you want to make a cut, 32-bars is a good benchmark. If this is a true open call, you will likely encounter newly minted undergrads who cut the line and/or sign up themselves and 50 of their friends. It's not at all fair, but karma will get them, so hard as it may be, try not to punch them. ;-)   Break legs, and be sure to report back!"
Broadway,2ro7b4,HappyMooseCaboose,2,Thu Jan 8 13:31:59 2015 UTC,"My song is 38 bars so hopefully they'll let me sing it all.

Not that I am personally opposed to risque performances, profanity, or other adult themes in high school theatre, some of the themes of modern shows are quite adult in nature, and if made into a film, they would perhaps be rated R (if uncut/unedited).  You need to be 17 to watch an R-rated film without adult supervision, so having a theatrical performance with similar themes (RENT, Spring Awakening, etc.) being done by a group of 14-18 years olds is certainly going to drum up controversy.  Do I wish that there was more openness to adult themes at the high school level?  Yes, and not just in theater.  But I understand the current sociopolitical state of affairs that cause theater programs to shy away from those topics and themes."
Broadway,2rjkl3,ilessthan3math,1 point,Wed Jan 7 18:41:09 2015 UTC,"I'm in high school right now and heavily involved in theatre. The censorship is pretty ridiculous, and it's mainly to appease bitchy/bigoted parents. When we did almost Maine the director cut out the chad and randy scene (sucks because that's my favorite scene) because it would be ""offensive."" We also have to cut out every use of the word god in vain for UIL (a state competition for high schools) because it's ""sacrilegious."" And keep in mind this rule is for a STATE sponsored competition.   But, in all honesty, the censorship isn't all that bad. We're doing les miserables in a couple weeks and cutting out nothing, and another school in my district did jekyll and Hyde last year uncut. But don't think there weren't upset/offended parents that complained to the principals, and those complaints lead and have lead to in the past teachers getting fired along with other consequences for the department."

Broadway,2qqb2r,Yoyti,2,Mon Dec 29 22:04:43 2014 UTC,iirc shortly after Chicago Rob Marshall was trying to seure the rights to Pippin via New Line Cinema in the same 'staged film' style for Chicago but got to work on Nine before and the project just kinda faded away.  At least it could be worse...
Broadway,2qqb2r,King-Slime,1 point,Tue Dec 30 04:08:17 2014 UTC,"I agree; I have no idea how they would do this.  Losing the live audience would mean removing the entire concept of ""Magic to Do"" (Join us...) and the Finale, among the other meta elements, as you said.    I wish they would just make a DVD of the Broadway revival (preferably with the original revival cast) and leave it at that.  Hopefully this movie will be at least decent."

The fact that they played it instrumentally in that scene helped console me, but I still teared up when I realized they'd cut it.  To be fair, I was crying like a baby for the last half of the movie, so I may have been a little over-emotional at that point."

The song maybe they're magic is very twisty and funny and we came to the conclusion that it is the central thesis of the whole show.   How weird then that they cut it and not ""you've changed.. Getting us through the woods"" that song has always struck me because all they do is argue and bicker and he dithers, then suddenly they are singing a love song.   Anyway, don't you agree this lyric is a major theme in this show?   If you know what you want then you go and you find it and you get it. And you give and you take and you  bid and you bargain or you live to regret it,  There are rights and wrongs and in betweens no one waits when fortune intervenes  And maybe they're really magic, who knows?  Why you do what you do that's the point all the rest of it is chatter If the thing you do is pure in intent, if it's meant, and it's just a little bent, does it matter. .....Everyone tells tiny lies , what's important really is the size. Only three more tries and we'll have our prize with the end in sight you'll realize, If the end is right it justifies the beans."
Broadway,2qgj5z,savagela,2,Sat Dec 27 07:45:08 2014 UTC,"I love the lyric and your sentiment here. For the sake of contrast, I might argue that the lyrics make the case for moral ambiguity to obvious and early. We have just seen Emily Blunt push the beans on the Baker and Jack and choose deception. We see her rip the hair and tackle Cinderella.  The Baker on the other hand only secures the Cape - his first attempt is thwarted by his conscience. He is presented the prize only when he does change from baker to butcher in hurting the wolf."

I cried a number of times, thought the casting was top notch, the singing was fantastic, and they made it move fast enough so it didn't drag.  Yes, there were issues in my mind too. I was VERY sad when I realized I wouldn't be hearing him sing ""No More"", but their inclusion of it in an instrumental form helped soften the blow. I never liked ""Agony"" in the show, but their rendition of it in the movie was so spectacularly over-the-top that I was laughing nonstop.  Every change they made to the movie was made for a reason, and without a narrator telling the WHOLE story, some stuff that got cut (like Snow White & Sleeping Beauty) really was unneeded. You have to remember the movie was over two hours long as it was. Whole families went to see this, and if it hit 2 1/2 hours, you'd have meltdowns left and right in that theater from cranky kids in need of a break/potty/snack.  So personally, I thought it was incredible. I'm gonna go see it again very soon."

Broadway,2qgezn,zac850,4,Sat Dec 27 00:59:21 2014 UTC,"I think it would have been pointless to have the ""Agony reprise"" because they shortened the time span between Act 1 and Act 2 in the film, the Agony reprise is supposed to be about the princes getting bored witht their wives, but not enough time in the film has gone by to make that plausable. I'd say the 2/3rds of the way dragged a bit for me but overall I enjoyed it very much and look forward to seeing it again."

I didn't expect the cuts they made because you can't have ballad after ballad in a movie...bullshit! It's what you chose to film. At least attempt to keep the spirit. I didn't know they cut ""No More."" I was really looking forward to it, especially considering they cast Simon Russell Beale. I held some hope it would be on an uncut blu-ray or something, unfortunately all I found were the feeble another ballad excuses and that they never filmed it at all :(  You can still show something good. If you're going to cater to the lowest common denominator...add, don't subtract."
Broadway,2qgezn,glitteryballs,3,Fri Dec 26 17:15:58 2014 UTC,"I have no problems with the cuts that were made to change the presentational aspects to cinematic; ""agony reprise""(snow white, etc."", ""no more"", narrator, rapunzel's twins.   However I do not like how ""I guess this is goodbye"", and the baker and baker's wife arguments were cut. Along with the general removal of death and the language of the script. For example, Jack's mom wasn't struck on the head by the steward and instead fell on a log that appeared. Also the change of Jack's line ""Providence! Milky white, my hen, the owners!""   It was a great film though."

Broadway,2qgezn,SparkleShit,2,Fri Dec 26 23:32:45 2014 UTC,"Personally, I really enjoyed this movie. The acting, especially the Baker and the Baker's Wife, was superb, and the singing for the most part was really good. Daniel Huttlestone especially impressed me with his rendition of ""Giants in the Sky"". I also really enjoyed ""Agony""; the over-the-top, comedic acting made up for the somewhat lackluster singing abilities. Like the rest of you, I was rather disappointed by some of the songs that were cut, particularly ""I Guess This is Goodbye"" and ""Maybe They're Magic"". ""No More"" was another one that I would've particularly liked to see, but I can understand cutting the songs for timing purposes. Generally though, the movie remained very faithful to the stage version, and the things that they did cut made sense. I think the overall tone of the movie stayed the same as the musical- comedy mixed with darkness- and the actors conveyed that well. This is definitely one of the few movie musicals that I would recommend to just about everybody."
Broadway,2qgezn,neutered_nutcracker,2,Wed Dec 31 15:50:47 2014 UTC,My opinion doesn't mean much because I've never seen the stage musical but I've always enjoyed the soundtrack and as a lover of musicals I thoroughly liked the movie and I would see it again.

The lyric is:  **People make mistakes  Holding to their own  Thinking they're alone  Honor their mistakes,  Everybody makes  (Fight for their mistakes)  One anothers terrible mistakes.**  So while the author's intent may not be wrong, taking the lyrics out of context to say something other than what Sondheim intended isn't necessarily right, either.

Broadway,2q544u,thurg,7,Tue Dec 23 04:14:11 2014 UTC,"There are different casts for different productions of the same show. So a show like Book of Mormon would have the Broadway cast in NYC, a London cast (called the ""West End"" cast), and any number (usually 1 or 2) of tour casts touring the US and occasionally internationally (especially to Asia). Though they all are performing the same show, it's very rare in the modern theater age that any one performer would travel with any show."
Broadway,2q544u,16note,3,Tue Dec 23 05:07:44 2014 UTC,"To expand a bit on the already great answers here. Since it's been established a show can have many different locations and tours:  On Broadway or the West End, IDEALLY you're supposed to be seeing the best of the best. The highest tier performance you can see anywhere. Everything from the cast to lighting, sound, orchestra, and the set.   Differences between a tour of lets say WICKED and the Broadway version:   Often the orchestra is smaller, therefore the music is altered a bit  The constant travel can make actors worn out faster, that in addition to missing their families, etc can lead to non-amazing performances, or lots of people bailing out and tons of cast changes. Again, this depends on the show and is a thing that a ""professional"" ie, anyone that made it through the audition process, should be able to handle, but we're all human. Doing a role like Elphaba is VERY demanding and the amazing actresses that do it on Broadway basically do nothing else but that while they are cast, and live either in bed, in their dressing room, and very little in between. So you can imagine all the travel involved with a tour and wearing out an elphaba, maybe she wont feel like doing the most epic defying gravity that night, etc.  They are on different stages every few nights, sometimes this means having to cut a part and use different blocking/staging if there's no trap door lets say, or the stage height clearance is too low for the lift during defying gravity to go all the way up.  The crew can be smaller as well and different cities every few days, make costume issues more scary. For example if a costume rips, especially one in wicked with all the hand sewn beads etc, sure there will be a costume person on hand, but they may not have the time, they may be great at everything except hand sewing beads, etc. So then they have to scramble to find a shop that can do it, in time, etc and maybe they won't so this could lead to more craziness that can affect the actors stress levels, tire them out more easily, look less comfortable on stage, etc. Whereas a Broadway show has all those people in house, and if not they can go right down the street and have it fixed in an hour.  Sometimes, not always (it can be the other way around), very talented (often younger, though not always) cast members audition for the Broadway show, and are instead offered a spot on the tour to ""get their feet wet"" and if they do well on tour are then offered the role on Broadway. I won't say this means the tours are a lower caliber BECAUSE of that, but depending on the show and casting, you may get very talented performers but one's that aren't very experienced in a professional setting, and with everything you can learn all you can in school, but there's certain things you just can't get until you go through the experience. This can lead to various things like if the show messes up, some more ""green"" actors may just go blank in what to do, where more experienced actors have a built in second nature with the crowd and are comfortable breaking the fourth wall a little bit because everyone saw what messed up and making the crowd laugh while the problem is fixed, etcetc. And that's not to say that sort of thing doesn't happen on Broadway. Also with Wicked in particular, it is still ""owned"" and ""run"" by one central group of people. So if it were a business all the other shows going on all over the world would be their ""chain stores."" They are very heavily involved in the different productions that happen to make sure the Wicked ""brand"" stays true to its nature. :) Sometimes foreign shows can be changed a little to make more sense to that audience's culture, and obviously singing in a different language is going to sound different, but at the core it is still the same story, same show.  Also let's say on the West End vs Broadway, you're going to have more or almost all English actors, and their accents are going to affect the way certain lines are said. So it can certainly give the show a different ""feel,"" than it would have on broadway.    Now as far as Shows having casts pulled locally, that AREN'T an official tour. The simplest way to put it is like with something like Fiddler on the Roof. Sometimes there are full community productions, but then there are some community theaters that have ties with Equity (actors union) and so they'll cast everything locally except a few of the main roles, enabling a community theater to have a professional, seasoned actor flow in from NYC, LA, wherever, to make their production better. This happens more with older shows because they are available for use in that setting. Like with Les Mis for example, if you are going to do a performance that is done in public to a large crowd (I think they turn a blind eye to smaller productions, idk) you have to pay for usage of the ""book"" and the score, and they'll send whatever theater their copies of the score, full with suggested sounds to use on the keyboard to get it right. This is especially true if you are going to do say a cover album of Les Mis songs, and sell it."
Broadway,2q544u,katiekilobyte,2,Wed Dec 24 14:55:40 2014 UTC,"In this case, the show is just the script. Book of Mormon is doing very well so there is a cast on Broadway as well as another cast doing the tour."
Broadway,2q544u,sonic_cherry,2,Tue Dec 23 04:53:06 2014 UTC,"It depends on the show. Any group of actors can do any show, but for shows under copyright, you have to have permission from the owners. For a show like Book of Mormon, there are two groups with permission to perform it right now: the official Broadway cast and the official Tour cast, which tours all over the world.   At some point in the future, the owners may choose to allow other groups to perform the show, but since it is a very popular show right now, maintaining exclusivity to those casts is more valuable than selling performance rights to other groups would be."
Broadway,2q544u,underthere,3,Tue Dec 23 04:59:12 2014 UTC,"ah, so it's like with musicians.  chopin can be played by any musician and a musician can play any pieces in their repertoire.  that does lead me to ponder, would true fans of the book of mormon have to go see both ensembles as they are technically two interpretations of the same piece of original material and surely the different dynamics between the cast should warrant multiple views.  also, to what extent are the two performances identical? is there an business standard for the minimum extent?"
Broadway,2q544u,missfarin,2,Tue Dec 23 09:05:36 2014 UTC,"The content of the show (script, music, choreography) will generally stay the same — there may be slight adjustments made depending on the venues the tour visits — but every actor is different and they are encouraged to put their own stamp on their performance, so, to stay with Book of Mormon, you won't see an identical interpretation of the role of Elder Cunningham from Josh Gad (original Bway cast) and Ben Platt (current Bway cast).   And, yes, there are people who will see the show on Broadway and then on tour, or multiple times on Broadway if they want to see a new cast, because the piece is different every time. It's one of the best things about live theatre, I think. :-)"

You can get half price tickets at the TKTS booth in Times Square, but selection is limited. I haven't been there in a while but if I recall correctly the shows you mentioned don't usually show up there. You can download the TKTS app from the App Store and it will tell you what's on sale on any given day so that will give you a general idea of the shows that they have.   Broadway shows are much more expensive than West End shows, so allow for that (but the exchange rate should work in your favor)."

Broadway,2q0xh9,mrgilly94,2,Mon Dec 22 03:13:57 2014 UTC,"Research the theatre's rush policy online before showing up and expecting to be able to get in. Each house has a different policy for how these tickets get sold.  If you don't have your heart set on a certain show, try Broadway Roulette. It's a great way to branch out and get some very reasonably priced tickets.  If there is something you are dying to see, buy tickets now. You likely won't get discounts to the shows you mentioned since they are the Empire State Building of Broadway shows."

At 3pm every day in Times Square ticket booths open up for discounted tickets, definitely use those to your advantage. Unfortunately, it's a bit harder to get shows like Lion King, Phantom, Les Miz, etc. because they're so in demand (and the phantom is like the new version and idk how to feel about that). I would suggest maybe buying those tickets in advanced, and using the kiosk for other shows, there are a lot of great shows this upcoming season that are worth seeing!

Broadway,2pyq4v,tiffownsthis,3,Mon Dec 22 06:29:26 2014 UTC,"This is slightly spoilerish...  As far as I know between the German production and La Jolla, they added a little bit, reinstated two songs (""The Court of Miracle"" and ""In a Place of Miracle""), and replaced ""A Guy Like You"" with a song called ""Flight into Egypt"".  IRC, ""A Guy Like You"" was the only song that was dumped from the movie version (The gargoyles a no longer characters either, and are replaced by the ensemble which represents the Cathedral as a whole, which Quasimodo communicates with when he's alone). They even incorporated the Boys II Men song ""Someday"" to be sung by Esmeralda and Phoebus.  I loved everything they did with the music and can't wait for a cast recording."

After the show, go to the stage door (If I remember correctly for Les Mis it's right outside and to the left when exiting). Many of the actors will come out and sign Playbills and whatever else you throw at them. Keep in mind that they usually have black sharpies, so if you bring a black item for them to sign bring a backup marker that will show up."

When I went (Admittedly it was when the show was still pretty new) the crowd got so big that people had to stand across the street. This is because of the actor playing Valjean, Ramin Karimloo, he's a big deal in the theatre world.  But if you leave immediately after curtain call, don't doddle and fast-walk to the door you should be fine. I'd recommend figuring out where the stage door is exactly before you see the show so you aren't left lost.  Have tons of fun!"
Broadway,2py5ck,Pianoman338,1 point,Sun Dec 21 10:20:28 2014 UTC,"If you're sitting on the left side of the theater (stage right I guess?) it's easy to bolt out a side door, since that's right next to the stage door. When I saw the show I was on the outermost edge of the seating right next to the door, and I was able to get a pretty good spot at the stage door when the actors came by.  Also, I'm not sure if this still applies, but when I went it took a while before the principals came out - it was mostly ensemble members for a little while, and Valjean/Javert/Eponine/Thenardiers took a while to come out (I didn't get signatures from the actors playing Marius, Cosette, or Fantine, but it might just have been the day)."
Broadway,2pwfrp,bicureyooz,6,Sat Dec 20 17:55:04 2014 UTC,"When giving out tickets to Tony voters for Broadway shows, the seats are almost always dead center, 6 or 7 rows back. So I'd argue that's a pretty prime spot.   That being said, it ultimately comes down to personal preference. Some people want to be as close as possible to the action, others might want balcony to get a more birds' eye view, some people like the far side extremes so they can glimpse a little wing action, etc..."

Broadway,2pnll2,Entershakira,5,Thu Dec 18 05:13:13 2014 UTC,"Pay scale. Norbert is going to get a bigger check than some young kid. Wicked is notorious for wanting to change the cast out so no one gets too comfortable and the fans don't attach a face to the show, thus keeping the show itself the ""star"" and allowing the producers to keep the pay lower."
Broadway,2pnll2,johnny_smith,3,Thu Dec 18 16:02:53 2014 UTC,"With Fiyero, they are probably casting people who look more the part than Norbert did (his temporary replacement when he hurt his back was 5'10"" Taye Diggs). Norbert's first real replacement was Joey MacIntyre, who I think is very much in the vein of Norbert in terms of looks. Sebastian Arcelus was also a high profile Fiyero, and he is very much in line with Norbert's looks. Then you do have the traditionally pretty, like Kyle Dean Massey and Aaron Tveit. So the answer is along the lines of ""an attractive person who can sing the role.""   Do you have any more examples? I see a ton of shows and I work in the industry and I don't really think of this as something that happens."
Broadway,2pnll2,icancook2,1 point,Thu Dec 18 05:41:23 2014 UTC,"Another reason is Norbert was with the show for quite a few years in workshops before it came to Broadway, so when he was originally cast he was closer to the age of many of the current actors who play the part. This can be seen in other shows as well."
Broadway,2plexj,legolas927,3,Wed Dec 17 17:43:25 2014 UTC,"I would go for that seat. The Broadhurst has good sight lines in general, and the only time you risk obstructed views is on the side. Most of the action in Mamma Mia occurs at stage level anyway (no flying or anything like that — although some actors do end up on top of the taverna set, which I don't remember being that tall), so you wouldn't miss anything if you end up under the mezzanine overhang. Hope this helps!"

Broadway,2p4m9p,jakaleidoscope,31,Sat Dec 13 00:03:37 2014 UTC,"I always taught my students it meant to look beyond the outside of someone to their deeper selves. Being nice is easy. The wolf is nice to Little Red. Cinderella's mother was a force for good in her life.  Her father married the stepmother, and though he may have been nice to her, the stepmother certainly wasn't. The Prince is ""nice"" but he's certainly not a ""good"" character.   The witch's line is a little more difficult and introduces a third concept that is just as important as ""good"" and ""nice"" - being ""right."". The four who are left at that point in the play are trying to do what they think is right - which is protecting Jack. It's a nice thing to do, but is it ""good""?  What if the giant kills hundreds versus sacrificing the one boy?  Is it still ""good""?   You missed the end of that lyric which is important - ""I'm just right, I'm the witch, you're the world.""  She's saying that everyone tries to be nice but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're good or right. She's advocating for doing the right thing (sacrificing Jack) even if it means it's not necessarily nice or even good.  Remember, she goes on in the song, ""You're all liars and thieves like his father. Like his son will be too, oh why bother? You'll just do what you do...""  In other words, the world goes on being nice, trying to be good, but it doesn't mean they're ever going to be right.   I think the theme is one that echoes throughout the play - people are always trying to be nice in their effort to being good, but that doesn't mean their actions are ""right.""  I think if you take the lesson further in the play - to No One Is Alone, you see that the characters start to realize that maybe the witch isn't so wrong. ""Witches can be right, giants can be good, you decide what's right, you decide what's good.""  It plays into the whole idea of the theme of growing up.  Sorry to go on for so long - I used to spend literally about four weeks of the year doing this play and discussing these issues with my students."

Broadway,2p5ort,noonelikesyouamy,3,Sat Dec 13 18:29:20 2014 UTC,No problem! I really wish more shows did tapings but I see why they don't. It probably costs a lot and takes a lot of time out of their show schedule which makes it not really worth it.
Broadway,2p5ort,Yoyti,5,Sun Dec 14 04:22:00 2014 UTC,"Actually, most shows nowadays are filmed. There archived at the NYPL for the performing arts and you can make an appointment to watch them. But you have to watch them on-location, so they're only available to people in NYC. But the shows are recorded. (And when you think about it, they have to be. How else are they going to get footage for commercials and promos?)  I understand not releasing them while the shows are still running, but you'd think they'd be made available for purchase after the show had closed."
Broadway,2p5ort,ally-saurus,1 point,Sun Dec 14 22:52:17 2014 UTC,"Most footage for commercials and promos is called b-roll and comes from a specific, dedicated day in the theater without audience; they usually perform key scenes or moments but not the whole show. It is pretty rare to find footage of an entire show that matches that sort of quality.  Filming a show with camera angles and video definition that is good enough to use for commercials, or good enough to officially present to a viewing public, is really tricky to do during a live performance. For example, when Fathom Events filmed a recent musical for movie broadcast (which later appeared on Netflix) it required a full camera crew to be in the theater for several performances in a row. They had to set up cameras on platforms in the audience at strategic locations, which meant they couldn't seat audience members in or near those locations. There were trucks of generators and equipment on the street for the duration of the filming process. etc.   I don't know much about what's available for viewing at the NYPL at Lincoln Center but I do know that while NYCB filmed most of their shows to be viewed later, the quality was NOWHERE NEAR what you see in commercials/promos and was very, very difficult to see much in at all. I mean you can hardly see who the principal dancers are. It was basically a camera at the back of the house with the record button hit at top of show, lol. Way better than not seeing the show at all, though!"

He has a really natural and comfortable physicality, he acts the hell out of the role, and he can sing like a rockstar. I've been a huge fan of MCH for ages (I was lucky to see him in Cabaret), but seeing him in Hedwig gave me a whole new level of respect for his talent. I'm hoping I can catch him one more time before he leaves."

Broadway,2ord02,NextFlightHome,9,Tue Dec 9 15:08:06 2014 UTC,"Ehhh I would wait until they are a little bit older, maybe somewhere between 6 and 8. At these ages they will still be young enough to be completely enchanted but they will have a bit more self control and ability to sit still. Even though your 4 year old may be able to sit through a show right now, they are probably devoting a lot of energy to not being wiggly instead of paying attention. Remember, a Broadway show is probably going to be at least 2 hours, so that is A LOT of sitting haha.  Plus, at these ages they will have memories of the experience. As a performer, some of my favorite audience members are 6-10 year olds because they are old enough to be respectful audience members but young enough to have their minds blown."
Broadway,2ord02,mbordley,2,Tue Dec 9 15:38:29 2014 UTC,Thank you! That's what we're going for. We want them to remember the experience and I know long term memory starts around 3-4 but we definitely want it to stick. We have the opportunity to try it out next summer (the traveling Cinderella comes to our city) so we'll see how that goes (tickets were inexpensive and we're seated near an exit if we need it).  P.S. I'm 34 and still have my mind blown!
Broadway,2ord02,LurkAddict,2,Tue Dec 9 16:19:59 2014 UTC,"I agree that they should probably be older for a Broadway show.  It depends on the kid to know how old.  As a fellow audience member, it's important that kids can sit still, be quiet (except for reactions, applauding, etc... talking loudly through the production is not cool), and generally not disrupt my viewing experience.  As a someday mother, I would add to that list that they should be old enough to remember it.  Broadway shows (traveling, off or actual) are expensive.  It's not worth it to spend that money on something they won't remember in a few years.    I would definitely do a test run with Cinderella.  With cheap tickets and an easy escape, it will be a good indicator of how they might do with a bigger production."
Broadway,2ord02,PERSIANCATS,1 point,Tue Dec 9 17:36:00 2014 UTC,"Also, some theatres don't allow young children in, even for perfectly fine shows. Definitely wait until around age 8 or so, they'll be able to remember it well and be able to fully appreciate the experience."
Broadway,2ord02,puffinprincess,3,Tue Dec 9 20:11:44 2014 UTC,"I really think it depends on your kid. I know 5 year olds who can sit still for long periods of time and 8 year olds who are bouncing off the walls after 15 minutes. It sounds like you've already got some trial runs under your belt, so that's a good place to start. But you need to keep a few things in mind when considering taking your kid to a show.   Bathroom lines are INCREDIBLY long at intermission, will they be able to hold it through the whole show? Nothing is more annoying to an audience member than being asked to get up mid song/scene so some kid can go pee and then having to get up AGAIN when they come back. If you're concerned about going to the bathroom in the middle do your best to get seats on the isle so you can move without disturbing anyone  Theaters on Broadway are probably much larger and darker than your local youth theaters, will your children be ok in an environment like that? (will they be scared?) Broadway shows (even the ones more geared towards kids) are probably longer than what you've taken to them before. You say they've recently been able to sit through a whole youth performance...but was that already stretching it? If they were starting to get antsy close to the end they might still be a little away from being able to go through an entire Broadway performance. Your youth theater is geared towards children...so people probably don't mind if they move around or make small noises or ask questions/male comments throughout the show. Even at a kid friendly production, people will likely be less forgiving. They've paid a lot of money for their tickets, and they don't want the experience interrupted by a kid messing with their coat or ""whispering"" not so quietly to mommy. ticket cost is also something to take into consideration. If you do get to the show, get part of the way through, and then have to leave for one reason or another will you be ok sacrificing the cost of your tickets? The theaters will not reimburse you because you had to leave part way through since your child got scared."
Broadway,2ord02,MovieGirl424,1 point,Tue Dec 9 17:12:01 2014 UTC,Thank you for your thoughts. The bathroom point especially is huge. I'm male so my line goes very quickly and it wasn't something on my radar.
Broadway,2ord02,UrNotAMachine,3,Tue Dec 9 18:34:58 2014 UTC,"I was four when I saw my first. I sat through The Sound of Music completely memorized...and I have ADHD. Acted up the entire way there and then didn't move once in the theater.  You know your kids. If they're ready, they're ready. Age is less important than their ability to engage with and appreciate the show.  As for memory making: I remember my first experience pretty well. I ended up majoring in theater. I believe my early intro to the theater world greatly contributed to this."
Broadway,2ord02,tokenfemale,3,Tue Dec 9 19:38:09 2014 UTC,"I was 4 at my first show (Peter Pan with Cathy Rigby). It would depend on how well behaved your kids are, though and the specific theatre's age policy."
Broadway,2ord02,quigonjen,2,Tue Dec 9 20:44:23 2014 UTC,"That was my first show too, at the same age!"
Broadway,2ord02,Itsme888,3,Tue Dec 9 23:43:23 2014 UTC,"I was 5, I think.  I remember the actual show (Jerome Robbins' Broadway) vividly--one actor had his hula skirt fall off and kept going.  When I asked my parents if that was planned, they told me that it was not, and was ""part of the magic of live theatre.""  I can trace my love for theatre and acting to that precise moment."
Broadway,2ord02,rachycarebear,3,Tue Dec 9 20:48:00 2014 UTC,"Whenever you decide to take them, make sure they see MATILDA! I was 17 when I first saw it and my mind was blown :) I think that it's an easy story to understand with lots of colors, movement and laughs to keep their attention."

Broadway,2ord02,ally-saurus,2,Sun Dec 14 12:49:12 2014 UTC,"I  haven't take my kids to Broadway yet and probably won't for the next bit, because I know it's something I want them to enjoy and not something where I'm focused on what they'll enjoy.  It depends hugely on the kid - can they sit? Can they follow the storyline well? Do they frighten easily? It's long and dark and loud, so it depends how your kids do with that sort of thing. For my kids, my younger will probably be ready for a Broadway show ages before my older one just because they've got such different temperaments.  For the sake of your fellow theater-goers, please don't bring a kid before they can behave for the whole outing! I went to a matinee and got stuck in front of a kid who kept kicking my seat and behind a kid who kept throwing his arm up and accidentally (I assume/hope) running his fingers down my calves. That's uncomfortable whether it's done before or during the show!"
Broadway,2ord02,groudhogday,2,Tue Dec 9 18:21:57 2014 UTC,I was 4 or 5 when my parents took me to my first Broadway show (Beauty and the Beast). I went to high school productions and other performances and my parents thought I was ready. You should be a good judge of how well you think she will be. Check out the time length of the show you are interested in because that might be a concern.
Broadway,2orw7s,LaceBugg,3,Tue Dec 9 17:55:03 2014 UTC,"Disclaimer: I saw If/Then in previews, it's always possible things have changed since then. That being said, the only reason to see the show is if you want to hear Idina Menzel live (which granted is a pretty awesome experience). Other than that, skip it. The storyline is clunky and hard to follow, but also trite and cliched. The characters are poor developed, the choreography is sadly basic. The humor is more trying too hard and less actually funny. Overall, it's not a fun experience and I'd only go again if I had nothing better to do that night and got the tickets really cheap.  Rock of Ages is laugh out loud funny. There's a fair amount of interaction with the audience, it's very meta so the cliches are incredibly well done. Definitely something I'd want to see again. The only possible downside is that it's a relatively loud show - it is, after all, about the 80's rock scene."
Broadway,2orw7s,rachycarebear,1 point,Tue Dec 9 18:28:58 2014 UTC,"I had been hearing that about If/Then, I want to see her sing but I'm not sure it would be worth the cost of the tickets and time to not just love the show. Thank you for being honest about this one 😳  I LOVE the soundtrack to Rock of Ages and actually enjoyed the movie as well so it's so excited to hear this one is fun! 😃😃"
Broadway,2orw7s,rachycarebear,2,Tue Dec 9 19:02:06 2014 UTC,"That's my logic for If/Then - if I'm spending that amount of money and time (plus the hassle of getting a babysitter), I want to see something awesome. Thankfully, most of Broadway qualifies!  Also, forgot to mention that for If/Then the signing was a real bummer. I went right after the Oscars, so some of it was crazy random strangers trying to meet ""Adele Dazeem."" Most of the cast was fairly nice, as you'd expect, but Idina Menzel rushed in, rushed out and signed as quickly as she could while barely interacting with people. The signing is a huge part of the Broadway experience for me, so that also negatively impacted things.  I hadn't seen the movie or soundtrack before the show, so I can't compare but Rock of Ages was literally laugh out loud funny. It's closing in Jan, I believe, so I'd grab a showing before then if I could."

Broadway,2orw7s,_fivebyfive_,3,Tue Dec 9 21:31:53 2014 UTC,"I saw Cabaret last month and was really surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  Alan Cumming was outstanding!  And it was worth the ticket price just to see the theater at Studio 54.    Of course Hedwig is great - Michael C. Hall is killing it!  Book of Mormon was so hyped up.. it was funny, but I didn't think it was THAT funny.  But if you like South Park type humor it might be worth it.   Haven't seen the others, but want to!"

I love it more than I thought I could love a show, I wish they would re-record the album with MCH. Not that I don't LOVE NPH as well. I just wasn't able to see him when he was in it. The last one we went to, My husband got the ""car-wash"" and he took off my glasses and licked them! it was unreal.   I was worried BOM would be more of a hyped up type of thing.   We did see Kinky Boots the last time we were in the City. That was pretty great as well, I was in tears the whole second half!"

I think Pippin was the most visually impressive, If/Then the most impacting, and Gentleman's Guide the most fun. Make of that what you will. Take into account the music too. Gentleman's Guide is a sort of pseudo-classical style, If/Then is a sort of symphonic rock deal, and Pippin is... Pippin."

Cabaret is also fantastic, and I've heard great things about Emma Stone (I saw it with Michelle Williams, who I really didn't enjoy — I almost felt like she was in a different show from everyone else on-stage).

Very angsty, ala spring awakening, but with more headbanging pressure cooker stuff. Are We the Waiting is not a bad little song, otherwise I'm not sure of the other male songs that could have a good audition cut."

Broadway,2oqpjp,roonerhasit,3,Tue Dec 9 14:16:17 2014 UTC,"I, too, saw it on Broadway a lot and find myself listening more to the Broadway album than the original (the vocal arrangement on Holiday gives me chills every time). It's such an exhilarating show, although I really wish they hadn't added that Good Riddance finale — I thought just having it end with Whatsername was so much more powerful, but I'm definitely in the minority on that.  Agree with the poster who says Are We the Waiting is a good audition song. Boulevard of Broken Dreams could also work, or Know Your Enemy."
Broadway,2oqpjp,missfarin,2,Wed Dec 10 18:40:12 2014 UTC,"I saw it 5 times. I really adored it, but I was a huge fan of the album and I could identify heavily with the story (it reminded me of where I came from and how you can never really escape). The staging was frenetic and the actors threw themselves into it fully - it was where I truly realized how great Alysha Umpress is."

Broadway,2oqpjp,ScottVGun,-2,Tue Dec 9 19:30:25 2014 UTC,"I didn't see it on Broadway, I saw it on tour in DC summer before last, and, well, it was certainly the worst musical I've ever seen. My high school did a better job. Some of that is certainly seeing a touring production, but at the same time, there were just insane problems with the script not making sense chronologically, the arrangements murdering the original songs, etc. etc.   My wife is very much into the whole punk/emo/hardcore scene, and when she saw it, she was on the verge of tears. Where as I had issues about the plot making sense and the story being awful, she had issues with how much of a blatant violation of the entire punk ethos it was. The costumes looked like everything that punk is supposed to rail against (according to her), and it looked like whomever picked them out just bought a bunch of stuff at hot topic, as opposed to actually dressing people up the way these supposed hardcore kids would dress. She wanted to leave at intermission, and I talked her into staying.  I used to be a big fan of Green Day. I have not been able to listen to them at all since I saw this."

Broadway,2oqpjp,roonerhasit,2,Tue Dec 9 14:15:31 2014 UTC,"I have seen American Idiot (AI) on Broadway A LOT and on Tour.  The Berkley, NYC and official Tour shows all do not have intermission.  Are you sure it was a tour and not a local?    The staging was fantastic and the outfits were true to form of mid 90s punk on Broadway.  If you didn't like the orchestration, I can see that as a sticking point as they definitely ""Broadwayized it"" with more strings and choral arrangements, but this is supposed to be a Stage show and not a Punk/Pop show.  I have heard the arguments on the story as well and I can see where people are coming from.  AI originally was the story of one boy's journey through his struggles in late 80s to 90's America and his disillusionment with that culture.  In the Broadway show they split it into three stories to better stage it.  Personally I liked it split into three stories as it helped to better spread the message and give different people three different situations to relate too that still reflect the struggle of the American Youth in the 90s.    I enjoyed the show and enjoy this story and orchestration.  I'll foot note it by staying I enjoyed both of Green Day's Eras (their Early Punk sound to their more Pop Punk sound) and I enjoy General Broadway arrangements, so this will obviously appeal to me.  I just feel bad that you saw a bad production because I feel this is a good show and is very much in the spirit of how Larson saw Rock Operas to be staged and orchestrated.  Edit: Had to fix a word."
Broadway,2oqpjp,Rebelpilot,1 point,Tue Dec 9 18:37:11 2014 UTC,"Not that I'm leaping to the show's defense, but AI didn't tour in the US summer of 2013. Also, it's 90 minutes straight through... no intermission..."

Broadway,2od9fy,btbcorno,3,Fri Dec 5 21:20:28 2014 UTC,"THIS. I understand the dancing necessity and all, but it made the Wendy/Peter dynamic so strange"
Broadway,2od9fy,let_the_sun_shine_in,2,Sat Dec 6 04:25:24 2014 UTC,"I think if anything it normalized it. Peter and Wendy were OBVIOUSLY older actors, so it helped to have some older guys to make them seem a little more age appropriate.  Although I guess then you throw Wendy's brothers into the mix and it kinda ruins the whole effect."
Broadway,2od9fy,Raddersons,1 point,Sun Dec 7 00:01:00 2014 UTC,"Probably the same reason why the Newsies were grown men...   Although, to be fair, at least some of the Newsies were still in their teens."
Broadway,2od9fy,LuminousFlair,3,Mon Dec 8 03:31:31 2014 UTC,"I liked it better than the Sound of Music, but watching Christopher Walken was very cringey. He seemed drunk or something and it was next to impossible to understand what he was even saying. Allison Williams was ok but she I feel like she was trying too hard and that made her fall short."
Broadway,2od9fy,noonelikesyouamy,3,Fri Dec 5 20:11:04 2014 UTC,"Walken was the best thing out there, 10/10 would watch again.  I'm pretty sure he was drunk the entire time he was out there though. That's what it honestly seemed like.  The set was decent, the hideout was awesome but the forest areas looked too much like it was ripped from Seussical. The CGI for Tinkerbell really annoyed me, because they could have used a laser or projection or something that would have been used in a stage production. I don't want to watch live arts for CGI that can only be done on TV."
Broadway,2od9fy,mrgilly94,2,Fri Dec 5 21:36:15 2014 UTC,"Spoilers below, of course  I assume it's original script, but I found it weird and somewhat disturbing how Wendy talked Smee into killing himself and it didn't even phase her.  She didn't even blink.  She forced a man whose face looked identical to her father's to commit suicide, she killed a person, and didn't seem to have any emotional response in doing so.  We all saw how Peter Pan killed Hook by forcing him to leap into the water and be torn apart by the giant crocodile that the Captain had spent so many years fearing.  But that's not quite as weird.  I'm sure Peter has killed plenty of people before so killing a man probably wouldn't impact him quite as much.  Though you would think he would have more of a bittersweet reaction to killing his arch enemy.  But mostly I was just surprised by the lack of emotion from Wendy while killing another human being for the first time.  Most importantly... Captain Hook killed the Teddy Bear!  Michael fell to the ground crying, but was back to being fine moments later.  He was up and smiling again after watching Hook be thrown to the crocodile.  Is the Teddy Bear moment in the original script?  Or was that Christopher Walken adding to the script in rehearsals?  Hook just threw Michael's iconic bear overboard... and nothing happened.  There wasn't a reaction other than Michael's quick two-second cry.  I assumed Pan would fly down and grab it after.  Or a mermaid would grab it or something.  I figured there would be a heartwarming moment when Michael was reunited with his bear.  But nope... his beloved bear is gone forever.  No attempt to get it back, even though it's probably floating.  It's okay though, he did get over it within seconds.  Watching Hook get killed cheered him up.  Still I was surprised and saddened to see the famous Teddy Bear killed in such a quick and uneventful way.  Tl;Dr:  A weird lack of emotion from the Darling kids during some seemingly life-changing moments."
Broadway,2od9fy,sabrefudge,2,Sat Dec 6 11:31:45 2014 UTC,"Regarding the teddy bear and the Darling children's reactions, the only explanation I can think of is the fact that in canon Neverland, you forget things almost instantly. In the original text, Peter forgot the Darling children's names frequently. In the musical, the Darling kiddos (nearly) forget entirely about home and their parents, so I would chalk Michael's reaction to either canonical forgetfulness brought on by Neverland... or just bad acting. Likely it was a combination of both.  I've seen the show a couple of times and I never remember the teddy bear being nabbed like that, so who knows?"
Broadway,2od9fy,dayafterxmas,2,Sat Dec 6 17:10:58 2014 UTC,"The direction seemed really odd to me. Like it couldn't decide whether it was a stage show or movie. Sound Of Music had this to an extent as well, but Sound Of Music has much simpler sets and requires much less suspension of disbelief, so it wasn't as glaring. All in all I liked the casting, though I would've preferred a Hook who could actually sing. I actually kind of liked Allison William's belting, since it made her sound more boyish. I did not like the added CG effects with Tinkerbell and the faerie dust and all that.  I think I preferred Sound Of Music, largely because Peter Pan has a lot of elements that just work a lot better on a live stage. Even movie musicals that are essentially just transpositions from screen to stage have this issue. When you can see the edge of the stage and the audience it somehow makes it easier to be large choreographed dance sequences (Sound Of Music only has the one formal dance sequence that's at a party and thus makes sense), choruses bursting into song at the drop of a hat (the only chorus in Sound Of Music is the children, and they are a chorus within the show, and they don't all burst into song at once randomly -- solos somehow don't have this issue), and breaking of the fourth wall (Sound Of Music doesn't have any.) So while I think the quality of the shows was pretty comparable, I think Peter Pan was probably a poor choice of show for this sort of production."
Broadway,2od9fy,Yoyti,1 point,Sun Dec 7 02:19:27 2014 UTC,The one in 1960 with Mary Martin was just miles better. The people in that one were actually acting. Imagine that!
Broadway,2od9fy,MovieGirl424,1 point,Sat Dec 6 04:21:38 2014 UTC,I thought it was a huge improvement from SOM. Maybe I'm crazy for this but two things: 1. Live audience! Give these actors some reinforcement for energy/the shows are created for applause. 2. I also think it would feel less unnerving if it were a stage instead of a soundstage. ... That could also be the strange sets though.
Broadway,2od9fy,let_the_sun_shine_in,1 point,Sat Dec 6 04:29:00 2014 UTC,"I was very disappointed in Allison Williams's acting. She lacked breath control in many parts and seemed to fall out of character quite often with the poor accent and general mannerisms. In fact, her mannerisms were, to me, the worst part of the show. Peter Pan is supposed to be whimsical and clever... Williams didn't do either of those. All of Peter's funny or clever lines were delivered very poorly or delivered like any of her other lines. She brought nothing to the character and was the biggest disappointment of the show for me.  Regarding Walken, one of the reviews I read said it best: ""Christopher Walken played Christopher Walken in a pirate wig."" He could have been the most badass Hook ever, had he actually committed to doing so, but it was a halfassed effort. His dancing was fun though, so not a total disappointment.  I appreciated that they stuck with tradition on Peter being played by a woman but what happened to the tradition of Hook being played by Mr. Darling? This is not a slight on Christian Borle though, who was one of the many highlights. The other ""many highlights?"" All of the supporting cast... who are, not surprisingly, the ones with actual Broadway and/or theater credits. Imagine that!  Why couldn't Kelli O'Hara have played Peter? Sure, NBC would not have been able to get the so-called ""star power"" that Williams allegedly brought to the production, but O'Hara would have KILLED IT in the role. Rigby and Martin were not spring chickens when they performed the role and look at them now! They're the most celebrated actresses to have ever performed the part!  I liked the change of Indians to Islanders. The racist stuff in the original would not have worked these days, so bravo to NBC for actually hiring a Native American consultant for that change.  Bravo to the supporting cast, again. It was fun spotting all the former Newsies cast and other Broadway veterans.  Overall, I enjoyed the show but the supporting cast totally carried it, just like they did in SOM."
Broadway,2od9fy,dayafterxmas,1 point,Sat Dec 6 17:26:13 2014 UTC,"I wanted to like this. I so, so did. Having seen the Mary Martin tv and the Cathy Rigby stage versions, I had high hopes for this live version. Sadly, I'm disappointed.  My two biggest problems are Hook and Peter. Really not great acting here. Both did not display very much emotion that differed from their established base line. Where was the color and reaction to each plot development? Peter, you're supposed to be a immature little boy, not a emotionally reserved smiling doll. Hook, where's the hate for Peter and utter fear of the croc? And their ""epic"" final sword fight? Very anti-climatic. (Although, Hook's death was okay.)  Other than the obvious lost adolescents and the very odd logic of the pirates being able to go to/from Neverland at will, the show was just long and drawn out. I did enjoy some of the songs they added and the choreography (like Vengeance), I got bored halfway through. And I adore the Peter Pan cannon! It wasn't at all exciting for me until the very end when Wendy tells off Smee and he decides he deserves to drown. Dark, yet comical. Smee seemed to be the only character I really liked and could connect to. Even Wendy's push for diplomacy was weird. I don't know if this was brought up for comedy relief of the boys totally ignoring her or for the irony of forcing Smee into the water, but it felt like they were just holding to the age old stereotypes of who boys and girls should be.  Though I have a lot of negative things to say on this version, I would place it over the Mary Martin one for a few reasons, namely the fact that they cut out the painful ""Mysterious Lady"" scene. I am glad I saw it, but it did not measure up to what I was hoping or the beauty that was the Cathy Rigby show."
Broadway,2od9fy,PhantomPhanatic9,-1,Sun Dec 7 05:58:22 2014 UTC,"I thought it was fine. Allison Williams was ok, she didn't really seem to have emotion when she sang. Dunno, if she's ever acted before. But, it was cool."

Broadway,2o665f,toronto34,5,Wed Dec 3 17:35:35 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't say I hate watched, I watched to see Audra McDonald, Christian Borle and Laura Benanti kill it. Honestly, I had low expectations for Carrie Underwood and I will never understand why she was cast. I respect her for giving it a shot and having the guts to go out there, but she really can't act and her voice just wasn't suited to this style. I still give her mad props for giving it a shot.  I really do think that a lot of theatre people (myself included) were mad that this big event based around musical theatre had somebody who wasn't a member of the community in the leading role. I think even if she had been somebody like Lea Michelle who is well known, but started her career on broadway (or at least in theatre), people might have been a lot more receptive."
Broadway,2o665f,mbordley,6,Thu Dec 4 13:16:18 2014 UTC,"I honestly cannot figure out the amount of hate that The Sound of Music received. It wasn't the movie, it wasn't the greatest live performance I had ever seen, but it was far from the worst and it was free. It also paved the way for them to make more live shows. You have to start somewhere and I thought they had a pretty good start. I can't wait to see how they grow and develop these performances. I'm incredibly excited for Peter Pan."
Broadway,2o665f,stopbuffering,10,Wed Dec 3 21:21:15 2014 UTC,I think the majority of it had to do with the poor casting choice of Carrie Underwood.

I'll never understand people getting upset about something before the person even gets a chance. Apprehensive, sure, but to say it'll be terrible or even just bad is a bit goofy."
Broadway,2o665f,stopbuffering,7,Wed Dec 3 22:35:07 2014 UTC,"Did you watch it? She did not do ""fine"". Carrie has a beautiful country voice, but it does not fit with the score for this musical. She is also a poor actress. She was very stiff and did not do the role of Maria justice."
Broadway,2o665f,shippfaced,2,Wed Dec 3 23:05:33 2014 UTC,"This. And pretty much all the child actors were pretty bad. When the majority of the characters are terrible actors, it's just not good.   But I agree that it was a good start and I hope NBC learns from those casting decisions and makes sure to find a better cast of singer-actors than just singers. I think they recognized that and can already be seen with the casting choices of Peter Pan."
Broadway,2o665f,spoilz,0,Thu Dec 4 04:04:57 2014 UTC,"I did watch it. A few times actually and have listened to the soundtrack a few times (a friend would play it pretty frequently). I enjoyed it and her performance. She was perfectly fine in the role. Again, she was not the best but it was definitely enjoyable. I honestly don't know many people who actually disliked her performance.   But you don't need to agree with me on how well she did or not. My point was I think it was ridiculous to get upset about a casting choice before they get a chance to actually perform. It creates a bias and upsets people before there's anything to get upset about. If you didn't like her then oh well. You didn't like her; that's that. You don't need to get defensive when I say she did fine. You can just say you don't agree and be done."
Broadway,2o665f,stopbuffering,1 point,Thu Dec 4 01:34:17 2014 UTC,"Her doing fine is different from not liking her. She objectively did the best she could but it was a poor performance. It was not a ""fine"" representation of role."
Broadway,2o665f,raganthelion,1 point,Thu Dec 4 04:34:53 2014 UTC,"She got all of the lines with appropriate emotion and sang the songs with appropriate pitch. There were barely any mistakes and she recovered incredibly well from the trip in the beginning. She did fine. You don't have to like it and you can focus on her stiffness as much as you want but she did the part and it wasn't bad at all.   I'm not sure what you were expecting from their first live televised show. It's a new thing so it's a little more difficult to get more professional stage performers. She did a fine job for paving to way to new and better performances. I enjoyed it, I'll probably enjoy Peter Pan, and I hope people can realize what they are getting, can enjoy these for what they are, and will support them in the hopes that professional stage performers decide that this is worth their time."
Broadway,2o665f,stopbuffering,2,Thu Dec 4 15:07:55 2014 UTC,Definitely not difficult to get professional stage performers. They got some incredible people involved and just chose to put someone with star quality in the mix.

Barrie is supposed to be an anguished, angry person when he sings it - his ideas are being shot down and everyone he loves is leaving him.  May have just been the performance.  Laura Michelle Kelly is still great.  The kids were excellent actors/singers at the ART; it's nice that they are still on the show.  They were not double cast, though, which was odd.

They want to pick musicals that could bring the biggest audience; musicals that most people already know, are kid friendly, and not difficult to get the rights to. They are also probably a little limited because I could see it hard to get the rights to some musicals (some might be waiting to see how they do with these musicals before deciding if they can handle their musical).

Broadway,2nibdw,WWHarleyRider,5,Wed Nov 26 20:05:48 2014 UTC,I know we are all sick of film adaptations but I kind of liked August Rush. It's charming and cute and the music in it is good. Similar vibe to Once. But what a random movie to adapt into a musical.
Broadway,2nibdw,groudhogday,3,Wed Nov 26 20:10:21 2014 UTC,"I agree that adaptations going either way don't usually work but I think this one could be one of the exceptions. And definitely agree about the Once vibe; what a good show, sad to see it end."

Broadway,2ndcg9,lizzie-lemon,4,Tue Nov 25 13:45:11 2014 UTC,"Lion King is beautiful, but it has run forever and it will run forever and it will tour forever. I would suggest going to something that won't! Same goes with Mamma Mia, Chicago, Phantom, Les Mis and Wicked.   If you're taking a group of theatre students, I think Aladdin, Matilda, Side Show, Cinderella, Kinky Boots  (if you think they are mature enough) or Motown would be good.   I don't know how much they would appreciate shows like Beautiful, The Last Ship, Honeymoon in Vegas or Once, If/Then has some language but the plot is pretty clean, but it is a little hard to follow (granted, I've only listened to the score)  Cabaret and Hedwig is probably a little racy for the younger ones."
Broadway,2ndcg9,justr,3,Tue Nov 25 13:58:52 2014 UTC,I just saw Aladdin and as a 20 year old I really enjoyed it so I'm sure your students would love it as well
Broadway,2ndcg9,katiekilobyte,3,Tue Nov 25 18:26:39 2014 UTC,"Toss between Book of Mormon and Wicked. (I'd pick Wicked, unless you have a bunch of 'tough guys' in the group [though i've known many a tough guy to cry at Wicked])   Both of those are the best all around I think. Wicked changed my life, and continues to, and even if it's too much and off putting visually to some, it is funny and the pace is quite gripping. Mormon may make some of the adults uncomfortable in the sense of ""oh god we just put this in front of these kids"" but they will love it most likely.   If you have an open minded group with you, add Hedwig and Kinky Boots in there, both absolutely great, plus with Hedwig the kids can get the ""wow that's dexter"" thing going on.   Things i do not recommend for worry of teen boredom or for non-super into theater people: Phantom Lion King Jersey Boys (most likely to bore imo) Carole King Mamma Mia! If/Then Les Miserables (even though it is one of my favorite things ever it seems to rank as most complained about by people who were 'forced' or 'dragged' along to a show with a loved one)  Wild card toss ups that would at least entertain even if they weren't specifically ""liked"": Motown Aladdin  Bonus:  This is Our Youth  It's a straight play but getting great reviews and also has the ""celeb factor"" of Michael Cera, it is pretty much the most directly relevant thing other than Wicked to teenagers currently on Bway  If for whatever reason you happen to have a group with a large number of queer/lgbt folks scratch everything and pick between Hedwig and Kinky Boots, hands down a teen seeing that stuff represented on a world stage like that would love it."
Broadway,2ndcg9,roonerhasit,3,Tue Nov 25 19:52:53 2014 UTC,"Thank you! This was extremely helpful, we're now deciding between Wicked, Book of Mormon and On the Town (or something like that), though I will suggest Our Youth and Hedwig to the other staff :)"
Broadway,2ndcg9,katiekilobyte,4,Wed Nov 26 01:29:18 2014 UTC,"Depending on ur students, book of mormon might be controversial. There is a song whose chorus is ""fuck you god in the ass.""  just fyi. Ive seen most of those shows and think wicked is your best bet."
Broadway,2ndcg9,katiekilobyte,2,Wed Nov 26 02:16:05 2014 UTC,"Yeah Mormon is a tough call. Your comment^ made me think, past the adults feeling weird about having taken the teens there (even though I think 9/10 teens would adore it and laugh until their ribs hurt), but actually if there happened to be one or more very conservative/sheltered teens in the group, they might actually be super uncomfortable, maybe freak out and refuse to go back in after intermission, and make a huge deal out of it. It's certainly in the immature/dirty as hell category. So def keep that in mind jinglebellpenguin! The content is nothing you wouldn't see on the front page of reddit every day, but not everyone likes that kind of thing."
Broadway,2ndcg9,rothie,2,Wed Nov 26 07:10:53 2014 UTC,"On the town would certainly please the adults in the group. It's the quintessential ""BIG BROADWAY"" show. Lots and lots of dancing. Most meta, all about NYC and sex. Sailors trying to get laid and expressing that via more dancing :) A lot of comedy, very hyper. Even though it's a classic style and in the 1940's I think it would still resonate with teens in a way. Maybe. I would certainly add it to the entertaining even if not particularly liked category since the story isn't deep or witty like Wicked/Mormon. Well, it's witty in its humor but I suppose I mean there's no social commentary other than 'let's party and have an awesome time.' If your group is more girl (or gay male) heavy there's TONS of sexy men in it!  Alysha Umphress (the cab driver) is the star in my eyes, i'd see it just for her! Tons of sexy women too. I guess sexy is just a good word to sum it up, lots of body contact, lusty dancing (but not as outlandishly sultry at a strip club or burlesque night type like Cabaret or Chicago [though it gets close]) :)  The thing about Broadway is it will entertain pretty much always no matter what, so even if you choose On the Town and get a few groans because it's a ""classic"" style, those people groaning will still (hopefully) be like ""I don't really like this but WOW this is huge and these people are super talented and i'm laughing."" :)"

I saw a matinee so I should not be terribly judgmental but it was like..i describe it as it woulda been great if i'd seen it at Myrtle Beach or something, but on broadway it seemed REALLY poorly done. The girl that played the wife was the stand out star in that show, and the bass player cant remember that actors name but he's fab, had a small cameo on Smash. Anyway, it was just not a good performance that I saw and know that, and I totally get why a lot of people love it, but it didn't appeal to me personally and I can see teenagers  possibly feeling really disconnected from it. God this sounds horrible but I suppose it's just honest. My parents were in town and saw it with me and they love that kinda music and they were really disappointed. We saved the day by scoring great seats to How to Succeed right before it closed with Dan Radcliffe and THAT blew me away!  I'm glad you enjoyed it though, it's been on my list to give a second chance to because I saw it having a lot of potential but I dunno. Maybe it was going through some backstage drama or something but a lot of the people in the show seemed like they wanted to be doing something else, there were line flub ups, missed things here and there. There was a gunshot that went off what seemed like to late, like someone reacted before it went off which coulda been just the actor. I shouldn't be going this deep into it, I'm glad you loved it! :)"

If you are going any later than January 6th, you'll have to take Pippin, Cinderella, Rock of Ages, and Once out of the equation. The Lion King is amazing and truly an experience. The prices are outrageous though because that's the 'go-to' show. Kinky Boots is a fantastic time, but you need to make sure that your students are open to drag queens and just plain old fabulousness. I personally LOVE Beautiful, but that's because I was raised on Carole King's music. Jessie Mueller is amazing though and I have spoken to a few of her castmates and they call her the ""Meryl Streep"" of Broadway. She's a chameleon and can do anything.   The only one that I would definitely strike off your list is If/Then. If it wasn't for Idina Menzel, that show would no longer be running."

The one album though out of all those amazing albums that got the most attention was Tapestry. My goodness I can zoom back to just randomly putting it on because my mom had said it used to be something she listened to often, though I wouldn't be into it to at least give it a try.

Broadway,2na6mh,golden_light_above_u,2,Mon Nov 24 17:59:49 2014 UTC,"We saw it last weekend. (Rumor among the ushers as we were leaving was that Sting was in the audience watching the show that night...)  The music was good, although some of the songs didn't seem to fit in as well as I'd hoped from listening to the non-deluxe album. Would have preferred the original concept, which included songs such as ""Practical Arrangement"" and ""I Love Her But She Loves Someone Else"" instead of ""What Say You, Meg?"". I thought the former songs were stronger then the latter, although I may be biased by buying the album first. [I did sorely miss my favorite song on the album, ""Ballad of the Great Eastern"", but I wasn't sure how it would fit into the play even while listening to Sting's album...)  The acting was great, but the story book definitely wasn't as strong as the music. I really couldn't find myself caring who ""got the girl"", and didn't think the resolution of that (major) story-line was strong enough. (I wonder if they could make it stronger in some way by making the Author character Gideon's brother. It would definitely add a bit more tension, and fit into the fathers and sons theme of the show.) I also had some problems with suspension of belief, such as how they were going to build a large ship without the yard owners pemission, why the shipyard owners let the materials in, how Gideon, a third-class sailor, was going to become Captain, etc.  The set was good, although simpler than I would have expected from a non-travelling show. I was really hoping to see a ship grow as the show progressed.  Overall, a good show, but it probably could have stood a few more months tuning up before ending up in New York."

I don't know if this is a factor in the show's success, but Sting's album ""The Last Ship"" is neither a typical Sting album, nor is it a cast album of the actual show. It's got a bunch of songs that are not in the show, and the show's got a bunch of songs that are not on the album. Although both the album and the show are good in their own ways, I wonder if there is too much of a disconnect for people.    Of course the ""meh"" reviews are the biggest factor, and it may just be impossible to overcome the lack of excitement from the critics. We saw it a week after open and really enjoyed it, but I came away feeling like it was going to have trouble."

Broadway,2mxhub,acal3589,36,Fri Nov 21 00:01:20 2014 UTC,"In the stage version, the actor playing Merrick generally goes without makeup for a variety of reasons.   It allows the audience to use their imagination, making the character appear as grotesque as their minds can think up.  Which can often be more impactful than simply showing everything. A realistic makeup effect to portray Merrick's condition would be somewhat expensive and be a very long/complicated process to apply before each show and take off after each show.   The appliance would also be very large and heavy on the actor, which would take a huge physical toll on the performer having to act under hot lights for hours with little-to-no breaks. The elaborate mask element would be concealing much of the actor's face.  In the film, they used very advanced makeup techniques and close up shots to let the actor's performance show through.  On stage, this would be more difficult.  You wouldn't want anything that might interfere with what little view the audience has of the actor's expressions from way back in their seats. Using no makeup also creates a far more fascinating challenge for the actor.  They must portray their deformity entirely through performance, rather than relying on a costume.  They must convey the deformity through the way they stand and move, the way they contort their face and posture, et cetera. The lack of makeup also shapes the audience's perspective.  We see Merrick as he sees himself.  A man.  A human being.  Not a monster.  Not an animal.  The audience isn't distracted by his deformities.  The audience is entirely blind to them.  For this reason, it makes the performance all the more disturbing.  Because we don't see a grotesquely deformed oddity standing on that stage.   We don't see the ""monster"" that all the other characters on stage are seeing.  We see the man trapped inside the monster.  A man, a normal man no different than anyone else, being singled out and tormented and shunned by his peers for no real reason at all.   EDIT:  Oh my gosh... Reddit Gold?!  I've never had this happen before!  I never thought I'd say anything worthy of being given gold.  Thank you very much, anonymous gold giver!"

Broadway,2mpksb,sanmateomary,2,Tue Nov 18 22:30:52 2014 UTC,"I saw it when it opened in Australia.  Having knew nothing of the book and the film, it was a musical that I enjoyed immensely.  The strength to me were in the music/score and how it evoked emotion, and it captured well the thoughts and experiences of one individual among times of conformation and change.  If I really had to critique the staging in my version weren't the cleanest and the sets were sort of hit and miss but they don't stand in the way of a great story and music (and maybe well be altered on Broadway).    There were many songs I really enjoyed (there are quite a few clips on youtube, even if in Korean) and would highly recommend.  'It comes as no surprise' had, in my opinion, surpassed 'I knew him so well' from Chess as the best broadway female duet, my jaw dropped in that scene due to the bittersweet emotions and the restrained but natural delivery.  Other standouts songs include 'Now', 'Ashes and tears', 'When the music played' and ""Love finds you"".  I saw it twice and loved each time more than the last."
Broadway,2mpksb,Katsudonna,3,Wed Nov 19 04:51:55 2014 UTC,"In fact found a review I wrote back in 2011.  Somewhat long so apologies in advance.  I went into this show deliberately without any research, having neither seen the movie nor read the book, I wanted to judge the musical on its own merits, and of course, to find out what happens at the end.  It was a trying and tiring midweek night. I went to the show underslept and overstressed but came out mesmerised and energised.  Dr. Zhivago is no light hearted drama or mindless comedy.  Set at the beginnings of the Russian revolution the subject is serious and heavy.  Gratuitous violent is evident by the number of gunshots and deaths on stage.  However the show never dwells a moment too long on the horrors of revolution.  It is a brisk paced show, covering an incredible span of years in a few mere scenes in Act 1, and it's a credit to the producer and writer who cuts at just the right level of detail and pace.  There is plenty of action and the story rarely stagnates even amidst a number of somewhat complex relationship polygons.  Props and stage settings serve well in the scene to paint a bleak and apathetic Moscow, sets while not overly extravagant serve their purpose well.  Costumes are well designed and set the themes and tones of characters and events thoughtfully.  A variety of black and white projections and backdrops add dimension and nostalgia to scenes.  Without doubt, music is the star of the show.  Dr. Zhivago is a musical heralded most strongly by the strength of its music, and all due credit to Lucy Simon, the composer and Amy Powers the lyricist.  It puts the music of a MUSICal back to its place of prominence.  It's been said that 'words make you think a thought, music makes you feel an emotion, but a song makes you feel a thought'.  Indeed in Simon's score this is what she does best, using many a seamless transition between word and dialogue to advance the story at a comfortable pace.  Every song is placed most appropriately and just long enough to leave you wanting more.  Each songs is specific enough to be tied to particular scenes rather than try to be a pop hit in its own right, and I believe this is a very wise decision for Dr. Zhivago versus many modern productions that unfortunately equate commercial appeal with shallowness, overengineered pop hits and 'star appearances'.  If one were to pick a flaw perhaps it's in the slight lack of contrast between the music styles.  Simon's score and orchestrations are irresistibly lush and pleasing, with mellow strings, woodwinds and pads all adding sweeping grandeur and vibrant colour to the otherwise grey Moscow skies or the red frontlines of war.  Personally as a fan of these instruments I can't get enough, but at times it does seem at odds superimposed over the naked atrocities of war and the brutality of revolution.  Yuri Zhivago is a dreamer and idealist, patriotic and moralistic, yet caught in the the currents of a sweeping transformation and anarchy through the destruction of all things good and evil.  The revolution is alive- you are forced to confront it, feel it, change with it or die to it.  The musical envelopes the audience unapologetically to the chaos of the day and you, as with Yuri and Lara, had to choose to conform.  Although Antony Warlow was ill on the night, his understudy Anton Berezin played Zhivago with dashing sentiment and wisdom.  Singing was top notch by all the cast members,  with special mention going to Lucy Maunder as Lara, who's voice switched effortlessly from innocence to despair, sweetness to anguish.  Her performance of 'when the music played' was a highlight of act 1.  The duet between Tonia and Lara in Act 2 is another outpour of emotion that is as dignified and emotional as it could be, and both actresses dueted with overwhelming sincerity, highlighting what to me was one of the most heart touching moments of the show.  The lyrics of this song is beautifully placed and comfortingly subtle.  The duet 'Now' between Yuri and Lara is rightly a showstopper.  This was the song that ignited my interest in Dr. Zhivago and I don't think one could even get sick of this item.  It was perfectly placed in the show, and its reprise equally heartwrenching.  Other songs of mention include the Zhivago/chorus juxtaposition of 'Ash and tears' and the powerful quintet of 'Love finds you'.  Lucy Simon really excels in writing haunting melodies and harmonies that blend like the finest velvet and exquisite chocolate.  Vocals in the show are just stellar.  Lyrics by Amy Powers are very strong overall- a couple of spots were a little predictable, but overall is well matched to the richness and tenderness of Simon's music.  An admirable effort.  One could draw many parallels of Dr. Zhivago and revolutionary musicals such as Les Miserables or Miss Saigon.  It is equally grand and sweeping, and built strong characters one would strongly bond to.  I believe it had carefully distinguished its theme from the other two classics and while it doesn't tug quite as much at the heartstrings, I believe the revolutionary themes and relevant issues are more prominent leaves one at the end of the night with many questions and reflections of such events.  Dr. Zhivago is not a musical for everyone- it is a serious subject, but carefully executed so it's never a moment too heavy, and never a moment too light on many complex and confronting themes.  It does not try to be all things to all people, but raises questions for the thinker, empathy in the feeler and much honey to the ears for ballard lovers like myself.  Times may be changing for musicals, where many shows strive for popular appeal and family friendly entertainment.  However, as a musical, Dr. Zhivago- like her protagonist, sets herself apart in adhering to the traditional expectations and ideals of a good musical- to use music and stage to rush one into an all encompassing experience of joy and pain.  On this note, this show will endure."

Broadway,2mbik2,Warlach,1 point,Sat Nov 15 23:22:23 2014 UTC,"Kinky Boots over Matilda makes sense. If I owned a theater somewhere in the US (as a good percentage of the 800somad voters do), my guess would be that a future Kinky Boots national tour would benefit more from a ""Best Musical"" award than Matilda. You've got good name recognition on Matilda between the book and the movie, the parents will bring their kids, you'll fill your theater. Kinky Boots is a harder sell, sure Cyndi has some name recognition, but it's not as easy a sell as Matilda would be, especially people who might be on the fence based on the plot blurb in the season brochure.  So, were I thinking about all this, I'd vote for Kinky Boots over Matilda.  As I think I've said before on this sub, show business is a business. Tony voters are not necessarily voting only for what they thing has the most artistic merit, and for that matter they were not made voters on their ability to judge artistic merit.   I can only assume that this is true of the Oscars, Grammy's, and so on as well."

Kinky Boots is a harder sell, sure Cyndi has some name recognition, but it's not as easy a sell as Matilda would be, especially people who might be on the fence based on the plot blurb in the season brochure.   It's funny, but after that award I heard the reasoning the other way around: Kinky Boots was written by Lauper, a favourite with the baby boomers, and based on a popular film with a happy story. It's an easy sell, so seal the deal with a Best Musical sticker slapped on it. That and the fact that Matilda was too dark and complicated which... no, I'll come back to this.   As I think I've said before on this sub, show business is a business.    Yes, the business is - but the premier awards should not be. Kinky Boots is fun but it's absolute fluff, and I can't believe any organisation can claim to crown a show Best  Musical of the Year and then ignore something as brilliant, original and moving as Matilda (not that I don't admit it has problems.)  The award isn't Most Profitable Musical, it's not Thing That Will Probably Run For Ages Like Bloody Cats. It's Best Musical, and while I understand all the reasons these things happen - there's a reason in my Tony Tipping Comp even I took a long time to decide which of the two shows to back for winning the gong, even though I knew which certainly deserved it - but that will never stop me calling it out as nonsense.   Tony voters are not necessarily voting only for what they thing has the most artistic merit,    This is one of the big problems. In tech terms: it's not a feature, it's a bug.   and for that matter they were not made voters on their ability to judge artistic merit.    This isn't just a bug, it's a swarm of them.   I can only assume that this is true of the Oscars, Grammy's, and so on as well.   Oh of course. It's the same crap that sees Scorsese win for The Departed because he ""deserved to have won by now"" even though it's by far one of his weaker films. It's the reason Dicaprio will no doubt win a Best Actor award for a film that's probably not his best performance. And yeah, there are just as many financial concerns going on and influencing decisions, along with sentimentality and 'Oscar Bait'. The one thing you can at least say is that the Oscars won't just give whichever mindless action film, probably a Transformers film, or a super hero film, Best Picture just because it was popular at the box office.  The thing is though, that doesn't make it any less nonsense.  Yes there's a massive history of it - look at pretty much every Sondheim show, for example, but especially Sunday In The Park with George - and it's something thats endemic of large scale award shows, but I don't think it's too much to hope to be better. To think that we could reform a broken process so that a catchy show where one of the main songs mostly includes the word ""yeah!"" repeated ad nauseum doesn't beat out a gorgeous and nuanced show that catches the voice of children perfectly and takes people on a moving journey about confidence and individuality.  Anyway, I'll stop ranting - and I hope I don't come off as railing against you, it's just a major frustration with the awards. That said, I don't have much actual hope anything will change. Still: rage, rage against the dimming of the house lights ;)"
Broadway,2mbik2,Warlach,1 point,Sat Nov 15 17:42:48 2014 UTC,"Maybe while they're rearranging this section of the Tony's, they can finally combine score and orchestrations into one award, and split off Lyrics to its own. Because while music and lyrics can easily be considered separately, the only way you can possibly judge a score without judging the orchestration is by listening only to a piano reduction. The orchestration is part of the score and that's that. Besides. More and more composers as of late are doing their own orchestration, so you may as well just combine the awards. Orchestration as its own award can be redefined to only apply to revivals with different orchestrations from the original, and musicals like Bullets Over Broadway that take pre-existing songs, but re-orchestrate and re-arrange them for the show. The Disney shows are a little weird, since while most of their music is from the pre-existing movie, most of them also do contain a number of new songs written specifically for the musical."
Broadway,2mbik2,Yoyti,1 point,Sat Nov 15 18:21:09 2014 UTC,"I think you probably identified the reason for not doing that as the importance of the orchestration award differs from show to show. Sure some composers do orchestrate but not all of them, and your point about revivals show where it's still good to highlight the skill good orchestration takes.   I'm personally happy to have them as separate, albeit obviously related, awards, although the same reasoning the Tonys gives here for Sound - that people don't understand what they're judging - would certainly be on your side for dropping the orchestration award.  That said, as a librettist I'm more than happy to have a change of winning Best Book AND Best Lyrics one day ;)"
Broadway,2mbik2,Warlach,1 point,Sat Nov 15 23:20:36 2014 UTC,"Well, like best original score is only available to new shows with original scores, I would make best orchestrations only available to revivals and jukebox musicals, and expand score to be awarded to the orchestrater as well as the composer.

You clearly aren't delusional about your talent, unlike many people, which would be how you embarass yourself. The audition panel for these schools will definitely have seen hundreds of people less talented than you, and unless you do something insane they won't remember you as horrible and certainly not embarassing.  However, you demonstrate a huge amount of self awareness with this post, which is something that the panel will like. Depending on which school you're auditioning for they may want different things, but most schools will be looking for someone they can work with to make them into a great performer. If you are aware of the areas you need to improve in, which you clearly are, then that makes their job easier. They don't need you to be a brilliant performer when you start at their program, they need to be able to turn you into one by the time you leave.   Go into the audition well prepared and rehearsed, work with a voice teacher on your song, an acting coach on your monologue, do some dance classes, and if you can find someone with whom to do audition prep, do that. And for the love of god and all that is holy, make sure you have sung your song with a live pianist before you go to your audition.   Walk in confidently, showcase your strengths, only acknowledge your weaknesses if asked about them. Be kind, open, and honest during your audition.   If you don't get in, then you're no worse off than you were before auditioning. But if you do get in, you get to embark on this freakish and wonderful and horrible experience we call theatre school."

I saw him in the original Hedwig run off Broadway - have been a fan ever since I saw him in the Secret Garden as a kid, and really only went then because he was in it.

I just started college a couple months ago, and signed up for voice lessons. (Again, something I never would've done.) At my first session, I sang I'm Not That Girl and Popular to give my teacher an idea for my voice. (Keep in mind I had never sung around anyone else before this... not even my mom, who is basically my best friend.) Afterword, my teacher practically demanded that I join their choral ensemble group, which I did, and I love! Just last week when I was practicing for a voice recital, she told me that she wants to enter me in a musical theater competition next year hosted at another college, which I find really cool.

Broadway,2l03p3,Yoyti,5,Wed Nov 5 18:41:08 2014 UTC,"Stephen Sondheim writes a lot of mini-operetta numbers, that incorporate a large amount of plot into a number, with plenty of theatricality. These include Simple from Anyone Can Whistle, A Weekend In The Country from A  Little Night Music, Chrysanthemum Tea, Please Hello, and (to an extent) Someone In A Tree, all from *Pacific Overtures, Opening Doors from *Merrily We Roll Along, and the Prologue from *Into The Woods.  Sondheim's also great at writing mad scenes, where characters go crazy. These include Getting Married Today from Company, the entire Follies Sequence from Follies, Epiphany from Sweeney Todd, Franklin Shepard Inc. from Merrily We Roll Along, Putting It Together from Sunday In The Park With George, The Last Midnight from Into The Woods and Another National Anthem from Assassins.  Some other favorites from Sondheim's oeuvre include There Won't Be Trumpets, Marry Me A Little, Another Hundred People, Everything - from - Evening - Primrose, The Miller's Son, Pretty Women, Johanna Quartet, Finishing The Hat, Color And Light, Move On, On The Steps Of The Palace, No One Is Alone, Something Just Broke, Everybody's Got The Right, I Read, and many many others.

Broadway,2kn3jo,NoPowerOverMe,2,Wed Oct 29 03:23:52 2014 UTC,"To clarify, the ghost refers to David Belasco, whom the theater is named after.  He was a prominent figure in theater in the late 1800s-early 1900s.  He wasn't a true bishop (he was actually of Jewish descent) but he was nicknamed ""the bishop of Broadway"" because he wore black clothes making him resemble a bishop.  His ghost has reportedly been seen by actors and others in the theater before so that is why Hedwig mentions him.  I saw NPH and he did not come out in a cape afterwards either so it seems like a one-time thing for him."
Broadway,2kn3jo,ladybirdluck,2,Wed Oct 29 18:25:00 2014 UTC,"Wow, with such rave reviews going around I'm so psyched to see MCH in December!  The ghost reference also happened with NPH and Andrew. Broadway shows in a similar style to Hedwig will sometimes have a funny little connection to the theatre they're in just for laughs, and this one was the ghost of the bishop.   The only time I saw it tied up was with NPH, when at the end when he emerged for curtain call, he was wearing this big black cape with a collar, made to look like the bishop. Basically it was funny little ha-ha to tie up the ghost joke.  However when I saw Andrew, he didn't wear the cape, and thus left the joke hanging, but it really didn't hinder the show at all. I wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't seen NPH do it before. Did MCH wear it at the end? If so, that would be him tying up the bishop bit, but if not then I guess it's something they just decided to do away with."

However, the actual song itself isn't as important as some other factors you need to consider when picking an audition song.    What is important in an audition is that you demonstrate your ability to sing in the style of the show you're auditioning for and your ability to connect emotionally with the material you are singing (your ability to act while singing).  How well does it fit the style of the show and the role you're trying to get?  It is also a good idea to pick a song that showcases your personal strengths as a singer."

The one thing I can think is how much i hated that character when I saw it done at a college in the New York area. I just couldn't stand him. He is constantly interrupting the show and then complaining about people who interrupt the show. Maybe I just had no suspension of disbelief because the person playing him was very obviously a 20 year old college sophomore."
Broadway,2jvwm2,NotARedShirt,3,Tue Oct 21 13:26:11 2014 UTC,"Well, if there's no budget, I would obviously recommend the tables on the floor (near the stage). The show is really immersive and on occasion interactive, so seat close by are great fun. The table seats on the risers are pretty good too- less interaction, but the sight lines are pretty good. I can't speak for the mezzanine seats, because I didn't sit up there, but while I'm sure the view is fine, the ambiance and overall experience will probably be very different. If you are under 35, I would recxomeb do joining HIPTIX (and adding the premium to the subscription). Hiptix is a program for people 18-35 to get cheap tix for Roundabout shows. The free subscription gets $25 seats in the mezz, and the premium subscription (something like $75/year) gets $25 seats in the orchestra.  Hope you like the show!!"

Broadway,2jh6uc,FancyPigeonIsFancy,5,Fri Oct 17 03:10:10 2014 UTC,"It was like a totally different than when Neil did it. Neil was a drama queen attention whore who you couldn't help but love, Andrew was a foul mouthed bitch, but you also loved his Hedwig. His singing was of couse beautiful, tear me down was his song. His accent seemed to come and go but I was admittedly looking for it, otherwise I wouldn't have noticed. One of the great things about this show is because it relies so much on the actors personality, each Hedwig is a different character. For instance, John Cameron Mitchell's Hedwig was purely comical. His delivery of lines that both Neil and Andrew made more sad like ""I laugh because I will cry if I don't."" Andrew was funny instead of dramatic the least often, but when he was funny he was freaking hilarious. I can't wait to see how MCH does the role."

Broadway,2j218t,melcrawmeow,3,Mon Oct 13 11:43:19 2014 UTC,"I don't think you'll have much luck finding cheaper tickets in advance. Once does however have a general rush the day of the show. You can go to the box office when it opens and get tickets for 30-40 bucks. It's less reliable and the seats might not be great, but if you get there early, you will get tickets. If you can get away to the box office by yourself, you can still surprise her with the tickets.  Here are the details of the rush policy, from Playbill.com: ""Once General Rush: $35 (Tuesday-Thursday) and $40 (Friday-Sunday) - a limited number of general rush seats will be sold for each performance, on the day of the show only, when the box office opens. Rush tickets can be purchased by cash or charge at the box office. On 2-show days, rush tickets for both shows will be sold when the box office opens. Locations will be at the theatre's discretion. Each patron in line may purchase a maximum of two (2) tickets."""
Broadway,2j218t,HereistheChurch,2,Sun Oct 12 21:29:56 2014 UTC,Awesome. Thank you so much. By chance do you know when the Box Office opens on Saturday?
Broadway,2j218t,melcrawmeow,2,Mon Oct 13 02:07:27 2014 UTC,I would not rely on rush or lotto for a trip of this magnitude. You might still get shut out of tickets and that would make it even worse... to be standing right there and not be able to get in.

At first she got tricky when they started limiting how many stage tickets you could buy, then one of our bosses called the theatre (we work in Broadway) and told them they weren't allowed to cancel her orders, then two of the actresses put in official requests that the seat she sat in only be sold to her.

If you're a lucky person, head along to the theatre of your show 2 and a half hours before showtime to enter the lottery (depending on the show - some don't have a lottery, but most do).   My gf and I from Australia ended up seeing 13 awesome shows using these techniques, hopefully you get the chance to see just as many, if not more. One things for certain though: you'll love them.
