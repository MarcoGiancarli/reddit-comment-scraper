FreeEBOOKS,3e2nn4,femtoparsec,2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:53 2015 UTC,sorry.. this doesn't show as free on .com / .in
FreeEBOOKS,3e2nn4,jmd_akbar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:33:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. Apparently amazon did not match the price of 0.00 for India. Currently a price match is the only way to make a book permanently free on amazon. You can help by clicking the ""Tell us about a lower price""-button on amazon and linking the itunes version.  Another way to get a .mobi version of this book for your kindle is via Smashwords. Here is a direct link to the .mobi-download."
FreeEBOOKS,3e2nn4,jmd_akbar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:55 2015 UTC,"I'm going to try the ""Tell us about a lower price"" button.. and see if it is available in india :)  Edit: it is available.. Just not matching the price to 0.00 here. Oh well. :)"
FreeEBOOKS,3e1p65,fedw9915,2,Tue Jul 21 07:31:20 2015 UTC,"Full independent review:  Some beautiful poems here! While it's tempting to itemise each one and elaborate, I'll take the quick way out and generalise, inserting a few exceptions.  I don't think the ""gritty language"" writes were handled very well, apart from ""Verbulasult"" which is excellent. The other ""crude"" compositions were just that.  I could read these poems often enough to want to keep a copy of the book. In particular, I would like to be reminded of ""Describing colours to a blind man"", ""Crumpled"" and ""He makes sailing ships"". Difficult to decide which is my favourite amongst this trio. Most of the others are readable to very good.  Well worth the time taken to read and digest these."

FreeEBOOKS,3dyih5,sodajonesx,2,Tue Jul 21 02:25:28 2015 UTC,I'm struck by how (for lack of a better word) porny the cover art is for a lot of titles. The romance section leaks out a bit into basically every other category (but that's probably a side effect of Amazon itself really)
FreeEBOOKS,3dyih5,Flash-Is-Awesome,2,Mon Jul 20 21:31:49 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong!  :)  I'm afraid we don't design the covers, but I can appreciate the fact that sex sells.  I suppose we've gotta follow the old adage and try to avoid judging a book by its cover!"
FreeEBOOKS,3dyih5,drunk-on-wine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:26:36 2015 UTC,The site looks good (my first time visiting so I can't compare with the old site). I see that the books are in the kindle format. Do you guys also provide some in the format that Kobo uses? Thanks
FreeEBOOKS,3dyih5,Flash-Is-Awesome,4,Mon Jul 20 20:21:40 2015 UTC,Hello fellow kobo owner! I love my little kobo glo. You should download Calibre which is an ebook manager/library. You can tell it to auto convert books to epub while copying to your device. It really is quite good and completely free.
FreeEBOOKS,3dyih5,drunk-on-wine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:56:04 2015 UTC,"Hello, Thanks for the help. I've never downloaded anything except books on my Kobo (I've only owned it for a few months as I'm still converting from paper to digital). How do I go about downloading it? From the Kobo website on a desktop? Thanks for all the help again."

Feist and Marvel this might be your thing, but it's quite unique as a story.  The link is to Smash Words, where you can download ePub, Kindle, PDF, and more for free."
FreeEBOOKS,3dz9oz,jarglue,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:07:45 2015 UTC,"Would be interesting to do a controlled experiment to see how much the mere presence of the word ""feminist"" in a title results in downvotes on reddit."

FreeEBOOKS,3ds392,jarglue,3,Sat Jul 18 22:35:32 2015 UTC,"I've paid money for this in hard copy, and I don't regret it. Free ebook is a great deal.  It's young adult so some may be put off by the voice, but it's a good story with info-dumps that Neal Stevenson would envy.   I wish I had read it at 15."
FreeEBOOKS,3ds392,ZarquonsFlatTire,3,Sun Jul 19 03:05:41 2015 UTC,One of my favorite books I ever bought.

FreeEBOOKS,3dqmvn,AinsleySauce,2,Sat Jul 18 14:43:08 2015 UTC,"Greetings again,  I created a book when I was around sixteen that exposes the raw exterior of the human mind. My mind. I considered not publishing it until mummy died but realized the world has become too fake and we hide too many thoughts. I want people to feel connected in the ways they thought they had to hide.  It's also lent to my blog of if suicide and sex are the equal and opposite reactions of reproduction. No this isn't a way to advertise it because there are no ads on it. I yet again just want to talk about things we aren't supposed to. It's called The Box of Chocolates Experiment."
FreeEBOOKS,3dqmvn,exceive,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:45:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks  I've downloaded it. I'm ridiculously busy right now, so I won't be able to read it right away. But I will read it (or at least start to) and if I like it (I tend to find something interesting in most human artifacts) I will review it. I won't give a bad review - if I don't like it I'll either make suggestions to you privately or be quiet."
FreeEBOOKS,3dqmvn,exceive,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:48:28 2015 UTC,smiles that is greatly appreciated but I hope you don't have the same problem I do of analyzing and gauging a book without immersing.  If you would. For me.  For my words.  Immerse the first time.  Critique the second ;)
