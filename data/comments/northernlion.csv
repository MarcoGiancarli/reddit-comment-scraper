northernlion,3dyiz0,Internet_employee,47,Mon Jul 20 16:02:15 2015 UTC,"I like it when NL talks ""real talk"", he seems so genuine and level-headed. In my mind he is one of the funniest personalities in media, not just in games. When he talked about there being other content creators you can watch made me feel I kinda have to disagree. I mean just about everyone could pick up BoI and start making videos, but to keep them as entertaining as NL, and still appeal to the ""hardcore"" crowd, it would be a challenging. Also about the negativity, I know the ""scumlord"" etc. comments are intended and kept as a joke, but I still feel kinda sad for NL. Hearing that kind of negativity constantly has to affect somehow. And it's a shame that the positive comments are a bit under the rock, at least thats how I feel. But anyways, keep making content NL you like and I'll watch it! you da man.  PS. that part ""I'll be here until you guys leave. I'll turn out the lights when I go"" was quite sad tbh ;("
northernlion,3dyiz0,villll,23,Mon Jul 20 19:12:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not being melodramatic when I say NL made me a better person. His unwavering optimism is contagious, he helps me improve my diction (I hadn't heard of hubris until I started watching NL) and his grace in defeat is exemplary. I'm 100% sure that he's one of the most genuine people out there."
northernlion,3dyiz0,crowdog09,2,Tue Jul 21 02:11:44 2015 UTC,Yes! And being genuine is something that's hard to find on YouTube now...
northernlion,3dyiz0,chickachoy,20,Tue Jul 21 13:34:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, hearing him talk about how the negative comments got to him from time to time was actually surprisingly hard to hear for me.

northernlion,3dyiz0,yosayoran,4,Tue Jul 21 05:51:08 2015 UTC,"I think I started watching/listening to NL around the release of Rebirth, I worked my way through his Vanilla content, on and off on the Rebirth content, and have spent the last 8 months or so going through his entire backlog of the NLSS on Youtube (up to mid-June of this year). To me he has become one of my favorite internet personalities because he's entertaining, knowledgeable, funny, and simply down to earth in a lot of ways while also having great chemistry with those he collaborates with.   In a lot of ways I also feel bad for NL. Generally speaking I see him as one of those personalities that makes him a jack of all trades, and using his Isaac content as an example, he can play both ends of the spectrum unbelievably well. NL is good enough to make crazy runs work and simply have fun with it, meanwhile he is also an incredibly good player to make most runs a winning run simply because he has a skill set, yet I would never really put him on that level of say Bisnap or Cobalt, but to me that's part of what makes him incredibly entertaining. Unfortunately I feel that puts him in this weird place where he is constantly going back and forth between trying to please those who want immaculate play and those who want crazy non-sense, and through his Isaac content we see that pendulum swing back and forth. In the end I don't think he will ever be able to please everyone. But at the same time, I love the way he handles himself.  Most importantly and I think this is why I really love his content, NL plays the way HE wants to play. Yes he may sometimes tweak himself to improve over the criticisms he receives, but in the end he's going to find the way that he enjoys, and that's what I greatly appreciate. Even with his content outside of Isaac he will play something until he feels he has run out of steam. I love that about his attitude and I think that has given us the best content over all in the long run. Nothing is worse than someone slogging through something they just don't care about or even outright hate just to appease others. I think it's unfortunate that there is a sizable portion of the fan base that want him to do things their way and expect him to be perfect at all times (because you know, all of us are just masters at everything and never make mistakes, what an IDIOT! /s), but that's just the way of the internet and people in general. I am glad that he does still take all comments into consideration whether they are positive and negative, but more importantly I love that NL is going to be NL and handle his content the way he feels it should be overall. Hell, it's the reason we are all here to begin with.  As you said, anyone can play BoI and make videos, but there is a reason NL has cultivated and kept the audience he has for such a long time, and a lot of it is because of the way he approaches his content and his attitude about it. With the exception of the Achievement Hunters, at this point I almost exclusively watch NL because his content is the full package. Top it off with the NLSS which may provide some of his best content because of the chemistry with his co-host(s) and guests and I find it hard not to love NL.  My only true criticism of him is I wish his Youtube Playlist management was better (seriously the last playlist he made for his content was Darkest Dungeon!).  tl;dr: NL can't please everyone, but he is generally pleasing in all aspects that make him, in my opinion, one of the best Internet personalities and entertainers out there."
northernlion,3dyiz0,otwem,28,Tue Jul 21 16:54:14 2015 UTC,Man nl is the best.
northernlion,3dyiz0,chickachoy,21,Mon Jul 20 18:21:50 2015 UTC,":( I've watched him for 2+ hours everyday since October. NL and the crew he hangs out with are such genuine people, that's why I never skip his videos even though my WatchLater is breaching critical mass. He's good at games and very fun to listen too. ❤️️"
northernlion,3dyiz0,mbreslin,3,Mon Jul 20 19:22:43 2015 UTC,Haha when I came back from vacation with no internet for a week I just sat down and filled up my Watch Later with NL.
northernlion,3dyiz0,Raykuza,18,Tue Jul 21 13:34:59 2015 UTC,"Not to go so far as ""all publicity is good publicity"" but I find myself always wanting to tell him not to get down because if he wasn't interesting nobody would mention him at all (including the haters.)   We're here because you're entertaining, if there is reasonable criticism then sure, consider it, otherwise just ignore the rest.   For example: By the time he clicks to go up to the cathedral after taking the negative I'm already laughing hysterically thinking ""oh god he's off on a tangent he's going to forget he took the negative I can see it coming a mile away."" and then I let out a huge laugh and ""I KNEW IT!""   The above may sound negative or meant to criticize his play but I genuinely mean it in the nicest way possible.  He makes mistakes all of us make, his humor and zaniness and tangents is what separates him any others I might watch.   I worry all the time that he will burn out on Isaac and the first Afterbirth announcement was a relief because I figured that would mean quite a while more NL videos."

northernlion,3dyiz0,chickachoy,16,Mon Jul 20 22:49:16 2015 UTC,"I've been watching NL's videos for maybe a month or so by now and it's amazing how quickly you can form a connection with someone who doesn't even know you exist. Usually with YouTube channels I get attached to I run out of content to watch pretty early on, but man, I don't think that'll ever happen with NL. It's amazing."

northernlion,3dyiz0,Ericcrash,-25,Mon Jul 20 20:45:20 2015 UTC,"I blame nl on the ""hate"" he get. Maybe because he apologize too much or because the way he tells jokes I don't know. But Check uberhaxornova or enb or markiplier. The fans are super nice and supportive and sure there is some trolls. But there's no ""scum egg head idiot"" circlejerk. Also why did nl start all of a sudden to reply to YouTube comments? Is he trying to do new thing?  Also I disagree with people who say the only reason he is big is because he is ""funny and entertaining"". He is but without tboi he will be waiting for the day he reach 100000 subscriber with nick."

I'm not sure if you've read the YouTube comments on thecreaturehub's channel, but it's pretty toxic(though a lot less than in the past)   I'm not talking about toxic people every channel have those. I'm talking about ""scumlord egg head idiot"" circlejerk and why 80% of fans participate in it. It's one thing having couple of bad apples and another when all fans call you scum (mostly with good intentions of course)   When Dex joined, there was hate, same with Spencer. People also tend to target Dan. Even now some people want Seamus to go. It's absurd to think that it's any person's fault for the hate they get (especially since its unprovoked)   All of what said is true except for seamus   and this is shown with NL too. It's stupid to blame NL for what a community of individuals does.    it's true. Some things he can't control but there is ALOT he can control. Any YouTuber have a relationship with his fans. How he shape his relationship with his fans is on him. For example when nl was in Japan the circlejerk was all time high. It's easy to say ""It's stupid to blame NL for what a community of individuals does"" but in reality it was his 100% fault. First the quality of the episodes was garbage tier because he rushed to boss rush and didn't make zanny runs when he could. Second there was literally only Isaac videos for two full weeks."
northernlion,3dyiz0,Chanewt,3,Tue Jul 21 14:16:33 2015 UTC,"All of what said is true except for seamus   Oh no, it definitely happens, especially before people found out he had a kidney stone. It's similar to how some people want Ze and Spoon to leave.   First the quality of the episodes was garbage tier because he rushed to boss rush and didn't make zanny runs when he could.    How is the quality of a video ""garbage tier"" because he doesn't play how you, a single individual, wants him to play? He's an individual too, and he can play how he wants, because the commentary will still be great.   Second there was literally only Isaac videos for two full weeks.    Considering the fact that his channel is popular for and mainly runs on Isaac, posting it nonstop(especially directly after the release of rebirth) was bound to happen anyways.   You say it's 100% his fault how he crafts the fans, but no it's not. It's very easy for communities on the internet to get out of control. There's a reason channels on YouTube that block comments are popping up left and right(even the creatures did for a bit. Partially, making the site was an attempt to filter the hate for certain members). Yes, he might have some blame in the ""northernscum"" circle jerk, but its far from 100%.   He jokes about himself sometimes, but that doesn't mean the jokes should be redirected back at him. It's common to joke about things wrong about yourself or about your decisions, but when other people do it back at you and point out your problems, the vibe is completely different. It's crazy to put the whole blame on him."
northernlion,3dyiz0,ryann_flood,2,Tue Jul 21 19:39:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to follow you all the way down that rabbit hole... But I will say you're not objectively wrong on some of these points.  Where there's smoke, there's fire - and NL never puts out any of that fire... He usually just let's it burn.    When you're on the top of the hill making between 300-400 dollars per 30 -45 minute Isaac video ( according to heartbeat analytics) it's hard to even care about him being hurt by negativity.  Every whine, every complaint... It all fuels his brand and increases his promotion.  So, while I'm sure no one likes to be a scum lord, I've never once heard him object to it.    Just my opinion.  But it sounds like old money bags Donald Trump complaining here."

You also hone, as with any job, social skills in dealing with coworkers (people you co-op with, podcast with, etc), with big clients (gaming publishers/devs/etc), with small 'clients' (their viewers), etc. It's not a super conventional resume by any means, but given how big new/social media is and will continue to be, it's a good collection of skills that could fit in with a good variety of places even if youtuber is the only thing on your resume - provided you were successful at it, of course."

northernlion,3d21ld,Honeycone,3,Sun Jul 12 23:55:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like I should explain how armor and damage works, since the game never explains it for you. In Fallout 3 it's simple, the amount of armor you have is just the percentage of damage negated, so 10 armor = 10% less damage taken. But you're playing Fallout New Vegas!   In New Vegas we have Damage Threshold (DT). The DT is the amount of damage you (or enemies...) negate. So if you have 10 armor and get hit by a 15 damage attack, you only take 5 damage. This is important to know, because some enemies out there have a high DT (giant radscorpions for example). That means you will be doing very little damage if you try to kill them with a fast firing but low damaging gun. Against armored opponents, it's better to use a slow firing, high damage gun.  So in conclusion, if you see a red shield next to their name, that means your attacks at under their damage threshold. If the red shield displayed is broken, that means you've overcome their damage threshold (via armor piercing bullets for example).   (I used the console command to add a perk which displays the amount of DT enemies have next to their name. The perk requires 70 Medicine and is called Living Anatomy if you want to get it legitimately. To use the console command to add the perk, press the button that's to the left of the 1 key, and type ""player.addperk 00146099"".)"

Anyway, here's my tip: Get lockpick and science up to at least 75 fast, you'll need it all the time, and after that beeline for guns to like 80 or something."
northernlion,3d21ld,BlamaRama,3,Mon Jul 13 14:35:00 2015 UTC,"Eh, that's how you play the game. NL said he wanted to do a speech focused playthrough. The game isn't that hard, getting the best perks isn't necessary to make the game beatable. I agree with your skill advice though."
northernlion,3d21ld,Celicni,2,Mon Jul 13 14:41:48 2015 UTC,Well here's the thing: Charisma has literally nothing to do with speech. It's a dump stat. It increases damage done by companions...Boone is already a killing machine without that. And there's VERY FEW (if any) charisma checks. So charisma is mostly useless.

His Isaac series is so strong despite him not always having known the effects and synergies of items or playing the ideal way, because he's basically mastered the mechanics, movement and shooting and dodging. He's fun to watch because he's good enough to try zany combinations and succeed on skill alone. Same thing goes for his Dark Souls runs, he was good enough at the game mechanics that he could get around not min-maxing or playing optimally.

northernlion,3cwly7,CanadianX_XBacon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:56:19 2015 UTC,King's Quest 5 or 6 would almost certainly be hilarious.
northernlion,3ctnmg,chickachoy,10,Fri Jul 10 18:05:36 2015 UTC,"That was great, I remember watching his first episodes of BOI when rebirth was coming out, it was hilarious listening to him say it would be just some episodes of BOI and then he would stop."

northernlion,3crcsy,ProfessorLoomynarty,2,Fri Jul 10 12:03:28 2015 UTC,maybe after duck game gets updated more

northernlion,3cpgjr,PiTheKhoz,2,Sat Jul 11 14:15:20 2015 UTC,Someone in the YT comments dreamt about losing the streak at 124
