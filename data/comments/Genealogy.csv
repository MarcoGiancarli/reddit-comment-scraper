Personally, I use Family Tree Maker because I thought it had the most robust and personalize-able system.  It lets you run all kinds of normal and interesting reports (age at death and causes of death, occupations, cemetery lists, your sources, etc... the sky is kind of the limit) and then I combine that with some of my own work and am putting it all in a binder for myself.  I am looking at making thumb drives or something similar for everyone else in the family though so I don't have to print out a ton of copies.  Good luck!"
Genealogy,3e6sqs,LyndseyBelle,2,Wed Jul 22 12:13:28 2015 UTC,"From my experience, any non-genealogist given a copy of their family history will be interested in only a few things;   Their direct paternal and maternal ancestry and how far back it can go A connection to a famous person, especially royalty What their grandparents were like when they were young   My suggestion for any book that you write is to start from your earliest known ancestor and move downwards to the present day, following that family only. Don't focus too much on uncles, aunts or cousins unless they have done something notable. Make it more of a story rather than covering every fact. If you want to show all the facts, do so with charts placed before/after each chapter, so that they can be easily skipped."
Genealogy,3e6sqs,knightonink,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:18:56 2015 UTC,I would agree with your list. Famous or quirky people usually let you tell more about the person and rely less on the facts found in vital records. That alone makes the story more readable.

I couldn't find a starting point that didn't get confusing after a while. The only people who will exactly relate to your ancestral tree are your siblings and the kids. Otherwise, there are whole sections that will bore many cousins, etc.  So, I've decided to write short stories. I have one called ""The Detective"" about my grandfather's cousin who became a NYC detective. Another one is called ""The Very Old Man"" about an ancestor whose obituary claims he was 124 years old. And I'm planning ""The Civil War Soldier"" about a 2nd gr-grandfather and, maybe, ""The Road to Andersonville"" about his uncle.  I tell the story, including source citations at the end so they don't interfere with reading the story itself (instead of footnotes on every page), and also include a diagram to show how the key people in the story relate into the modern family my readers will recognize.  I'm still not sure how it will work out because each story is still a work in progress. It isn't a comprehensive 'book' but it provides specific stories in 'bite sized' pieces.  One other thing. Diagrams and pictures help. A lot."

If you know the general dates and both family names, pull up the record book in the Civil Registry books by location and year and search through the index, usually in the front or back. Some towns also have individual index books too.   Search out genealogical groups and societies for your region as well, genealogy is a huge hobby and trade for many Puerto Ricans. These groups often have collaborated and have source material such as individual studies and church transcriptions which are an immense help when you are looking pre-1885. They are also a great resource for asking specific questions once you've done the research and hit a brick wall.   Lastly, Google is a huge help. Many folks have their trees and histories posted online through various websites. They shouldn't be taken as source, but are a great jumping point for direction and collaboration.

Most of the counties turned over their major records a few decades ago when the State Archives asked to consolidate them. You can also try the Maryland Historical Society or the Pratt library, my mother has had some luck finding information on Baltimore city relatives there. I'd say there is a fair chance that the sale announcement is for him but wills and probate records would certainly settle that, especially since he has a pretty common name.  Unfortunately, I don't think probate records will help much with his parents. What part of Baltimore County was he born in? Do you have burial records for him? Have you tried checking land records? My second stop after probate is always land records when looking for parent's information since inherited properties tend to be mentioned or listed in sales.   I'm assuming you're local to Baltimore?  Edit: I just realized we'd talked a bit about the Blevins line and now here we are talking about Baltimore!

In the case of Italian, this comes from the Latin ending -us or -um, which is very common.  In French the /o/ sound can be made in a number of different ways (-eau, -au, -ot, -aut, -ault, etc...). The -eau in Rousseau comes from the Latin ""-ellus"" which is a diminutive suffix.   Both Russo and Rousseau come from the same root (a word for red that is rare in Classical Latin, russus). But Russo simply means red, while Rousseau means literally ""little red"" and comes from the Latin ""russellus.""  So basically, it's because of lexical similarity plus the fact that /o/ is a common ending in both languages. But usually the French and Italian aren't actually the exact same word etymologically."

You can't even assume that people from the same area with the same surname are related.  As an example, one surname that actually is supposed to have one origin is the Irish Ryan.  All Ryans from Ireland are theoretically descended from the same guy.  However, it turns out that about half of the people in the Ryan project at FTDNA do not match the main group.

Genealogy,3dtdmg,ppden,2,Sun Jul 19 07:20:37 2015 UTC,"Alright there are seven documents. I've underlined the problem-text I need read for each one, and I'll give some context before each one in case that helps:  One. The first one is a marriage record. The husband's entry starts out ""Joannes Bubulka, agr, viduus"" which means ""John Bubulka, farmer, widower""...but I can't read the rest of the text in his entry which I've underlined in red. The wife's entry here is more typical (""Agatha filia Jacob Para, agr, et Eva natae Bieniek"" meaning ""Agatha daughter of Jacob Para, farmer, and Eva nee Bieniek"") inasmuch as it just gives the parents. But John's entry seems more complicated. Another record (his daughter's baptism) gives his parents as Adalbert Bubulka and Mariann Pluta, but I'm not seeing anything like that in this entry:  http://i.imgur.com/yGLU53r.jpg  Two. This second entry is a baptismal record. In the box for the father it says, ""Joannes Bogusz, hort, filius Casimir Bogusz et Hedwigis [MAIDEN NAME] natae"" meaning ""John Bogusz, a type of farmer, son of Casimir Bogusz and Hedwig nee [MAIDEN NAME]"" but I cannot figure out what the maiden name reads as, especially in terms of a plausible Polish surname:  http://i.imgur.com/S1ZAnhA.jpg  Three. The third is the marriage record for the parents discussed in #2. The husbands box starts ""Joannes Bogusz; Casimir Bogusz et Hedvigi natae..."" (""John Bogusz; son of Casimir Bogusz and Hedwig nee..."") but I can't read the maiden name again, and then there is a line that looks like it is abbreviated C.L. which I'm guessing is related to describing someone's occupation, either John's or Casimir's, and I see it ends with the word ""filius""/""son"".  The wife's box reads ""Jozefa; Martin Uroda et Mariannae se(?) natae Nowak..."" (""Jozefa; daughter of Martin Uroda and Marianna nee Nowak..."") but again I can't read the ""C.L.""(?) line that I'm guessing describes an occupation (I think I see ""hort"" in there; is this Martin's occupation?), though it ends with ""filia""/""daughter"":  http://i.imgur.com/kiWBPrx.jpg  Four. This is a marriage record, once again involving our Hedwig. The husband's box says, ""Casimirus Bogusz; Jacobi Bogusz et Theresie [MAIDEN NAME]..."" (Casimir Bogusz; son of Jacob Bogusz and Theresa [MAIDEN NAME]...) and then that ""C.L."" clause again, but I can't read the maiden name and don't understand the C.L. clause.  The wife's box says ""Hedvigis..."" but I don't see the maiden name and don't understand the rest of what is being said here though I see the word ""vidua"" which means widow farther town:  http://i.imgur.com/cMRpiWw.jpg  Five. Baptismal record. The father's box says ""Casimir Bogusz"" and then there is a word under that which probably describes an occupation but I can't read it. The mother's box (ignore the ""marianna"" above...that went with the previous record on the page) says: ""Hedvigis nata se(?) Adalbert [MAIDEN NAME?] et Marianna [Mother's Maiden Name?]"" followed by what I believe to be another C.L. clause (possibly saying ""hortus"") but the microfilm got pretty bad towards the bottom of the page. But most important are Adalbert and Marianna's surnames:  http://i.imgur.com/1T3VS93.jpg  Six. Baptismal record for Casimir. The father's box says ""Jacobi Bogusz"" with another word, again probably an occupation I can't read. The mother's box says ""Theresia..."" and then maybe says ""Josephi"" (her father) followed by his surname (ie, her maiden name) and then ""hort filia"", meaning ""Theresia, daughter of small-farmer Joseph [MAIDEN NAME]."" I'm mainly trying to figure out that maiden name. Theresa is also mentioned in record 4, if comparing both versions is any help in figuring out the maiden name:  http://i.imgur.com/Vc86vBz.jpg  Seven. Baptismal record. In the father's box it says ""Martinus Uroda"" with another word probably describing an occupation, which I can't read/don't understand. In the mother's box it says, ""Marianna nata se Antoni Nowak et Agatha se natae [Mother's Maiden Name]"" and then a C.L. clause where I can't discern the occupation (I'm assuming Antoni Nowak's occupation). There's also some bigger text underneath that I'm not sure if it's part of the box or just a signature of the priest or one of the witnesses. Mainly I'm looking for Agatha's maiden name:  http://i.imgur.com/lfnAdaN.jpg  Basically, there are four maiden names in there I'm trying to decode: for Hedwig (wife of Casimir Bogusz and mother of John Bogusz), for Hedwig's mother Marianna (the wife of Adalbert Whatever-Hedwigs-Maiden-Name-Is), for Agatha (wife of Antoni Nowak, mother of Marianna, and grandmother of Jozefa Uroda), and for Theresa (wife of Jacob Bogusz, mother of Casimir Bogusz, and grandmother of John Bogusz.)"

Olszow looks right and both Olszowy and Olszowka seem to be real Polish surnames that appear elsewhere. The other record Theresa occurs in now seems pretty clearly Olszowy.  Both Duralek and Duratek (probably a misreading of the L-with-slash) also appear in the records but they seem very very rare so it makes me wonder if there is another form of this name or something.

If I have trouble finding people, I actually remove information from the search rather than add more. I also go backwards or forwards in time to see if I can find out something about the person that might help me search for them in the time period I'm interested in.  I found your guy in the 1940 census with these parameters -- using wildcards is super useful and helps me find a lot of people.  I also like to use occupations to help -- these parameters also led to your guy.  The fact that he was born in 1888 would have made him about 30 years old during WWI -- meaning he likely appears in this database, U.S., World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917-1918   I struggled to find him, but since almost every male in that age range in the US appears in this database, I kept looking. I finally found him when I removed ""Albert"" and used this parameter -- he's listing himself under a nickname, ""Allie"". Here's the draft card.  This will hopefully help us find him in the earlier 1900/1910 censuses with his parents -- we now have two new clues -- an exact birthplace (Orange, Massachusetts, and more names he might be listed under -- we will want to look for Allie, Jason, or Albert).  Now I searched the 1910 census using these parameters.  And look what popped up -- he's living as a boarder with the Peterson family, maybe an uncle of his future wife, it looks like??  His first name was transcribed as ""Alla"" but it's pretty clearly his nickname ""Allie"" written on the form. He is listed as born in Massachusetts, with his father ""Canada French"" and his mom Massachusetts.  I went back to the 1900 census, and did a lot of searches, and I think this is the best candidate for your Albert. These are the parameters I used. I'm not positive it's your guy, but his own birth details (May 1888, Mass.) fit, and he's got his father born in Canada and his mom in Massachusetts. He's also living in the same county as what's on the 1910 census. Unfortunately though, he's not living with his parents, he's the nephew of these Heberts.  What I'd do next, to try and find the parents, is order Albert's Social Security application. This should contain his parent's names. You can order it through vitalchek by going to the record that you already have on your tree.   I'd also find out as much as I can about the couple he's living with on the 1900 census (and note that there's more Heberts, almost certainly relatives, in the spaces below this family on the census page, and on the page before them).  Good luck, hope you can find the father!!"

The suffixes -ina/-yna are added to noun-derived names ending in -a, and usually indicate a married woman; the corresponding form for unmarried women was -anka or -ianka (sometimes -onka or -ionka). So Mrs. Zaręba is ""pani Zarębina,"" and Miss Zaręba is ""panna Zarębianka.""  I must add, however, that in regional dialects you sometimes see -anka or -onka added to adjectival surnames, and even used for any female, so that a Mrs. Kowalski might appear as ""Kowalszczanka."" That is not correct in mainstream Polish; but you may run into in records from some regions, especially northeastern and southeastern Poland."

When you download your raw data and upload it to things like gedmatch, you get better triangulation because the large amount of SNPs tested - and can get a good Admixture profile (good ethnicity results if you want further breakdown of your ethnicity) You can also cull out medical data as the SNPs included are relevant to medical issues- if you want to go that route. The raw data can be uploaded to a multitude of sites to find that information out.  Ancestry and FtDNA remove alot of the relevant medical SNPs.  Ancestry you'll match with a bunch of people but you won't know 'how' or if it's real. It will be tough to figure out the connection as you can't see what chromosome you're matching on, how many SNPs you share, or how reliable the match is (whether it's just noise or a true match).

It can handle images, PDFs, MP3s, video files.  It is better able to tell the story and act as a digital scrap book than other programs I have used.  It is also better able to make odd connections.  I have it also so that you can compare what happened in a certain year across all lines, or what happened on the same day years apart, it wasn't until I entered it in this way that I realized my 2nd great grandfather died on my wife's birthday, though 76 years earlier.  One down side is that it does take a significant amount of time to properly curate all the detail and intricacies.  I can have a plain text version of a letter with links to what the letter is referencing without the paid of trying to decrypt someones handwriting and then manually looking for whom it is referencing.

The poster was a highlight of our family reunion last year and it allowed my more distant relatives to draw in their own families so that I now have an up-to-date tree with all the recent marriages and births.  Legacy Family Tree offers pretty good analysis too. It will alert you if a marriage date seems to early, if childrens' births don't fit the family well, if you're entering a duplicate person, etc. The software allows you to sync your tree to Family Search, but it doesn't offer syncing to Ancestry as far as I know.

Genealogy,3dcoyu,mofam_gen,3,Wed Jul 15 06:10:21 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming the 1897 date for Gretna Green should be 1827.    How old was Ann in 1827?  I see that she is marrying with consent of her father in the Manchester and Lancaster records, so I'm assuming she was underage, which is probably why they eloped to Gretna Green.  The closeness of the dates is strange.  Generally there had to be three Sundays of banns (basically an announcement in the parish church over the three weeks previous about the marriage).  My guess is they eloped, returned, and basically forced her father to give his consent to prevent a scandal, and then re-married."
Genealogy,3dcoyu,BookwormZA,4,Wed Jul 15 09:59:29 2015 UTC,"That sounds likely to me too. Elopement without banns or parental permission, return to Manchester, reveal all to the families and then force them into allowing an 'official' ceremony in the Cathedral.   Gretna was used not just because it was easier to get married there with no notice, underage and so on but also because frequently the couple had to spend hours getting there and then stay overnight before making the journey home. Even if the parents were fuming with rage, trying to annul a marriage when it was clear the couple had spent a night alone together in an inn or lodging house before returning to their families was just about impossible."

Genealogy,3dadx7,liah,7,Tue Jul 14 19:11:52 2015 UTC,"You might check into a Caribbean origin. After the War Of The Knives---which occurred from June 1799 to March 1800---many gens de couleur libres left Haiti as refugees for France, Louisiana, Quebec, and other French-speaking places. Based on the information you've given, I would lean more towards a Caribbean origin than an American origin, although either is possible.  In The French Colonies, the term gens de couleur libres referred to multiracial free people. Femme de couleur was a woman who was part of this group. Negre meant a black person of African origin (the feminine counterpart was negresse). Outside of the French Colonies, the various words for different racial classifications were used more loosely, but in the French Caribbean, they were scrupulously recorded and had very specific meanings.   Based on these racial classifications,  there's several possibilities for their origins. James/Jacques could have been a slave. He may have been born in Africa and survived the middle passage, he may have been born into slavery, or he may have been born to freed slaves.   Marie would not have been enslaved however; to receive the classification of femme de couleur she would have been born free and would have had both black and white ancestors. This is a term she would have used to refer to herself, and would likely have been a matter of pride. Gens de couleur libres were of a higher social status than negres, many being descended from wealthy aristocratic French plantation owners.  Marie's 2 daughters being listed as mulâtresse is not quite accurate, being the term specifically for the child of 1 black and 1 white parent. It's possible the terms were used more loosely in Quebec, and its possible it was a clerical error. If it was a clerical error, it may mean that Marie was especially light skinned and was perceived as white by the clerk---she may have been a quarteronne, octavonne, etc. Gens de couleur libres had widely varying ancestries and skin colors.  Anyway I hope this explanation of the French terms is helpful for you. :)"

Genealogy,3dadx7,wilfordbremley,2,Wed Jul 15 16:52:18 2015 UTC,"Depends on which direction you want to trace: forward or backward. For what it's worth, I was able to get a surprising amount of information on some blacks in the United States once. Using marriage records, I was able to determine the names of a former slave's parents. Using census records, I was able to determine where the individuals parents were born. From here, I used newspaper articles from the post-slavery era to determine their African ethnicity (Gambian), as well as the name of the individual's former owner. From there, I verified that the correct number of male and female slaves and their ages were listed in the Pre-Civil War census records for the owner. This was the maximum amount of information I could have hoped for.  A few things helped in this regard. First, the community the family lived in was very progressive for the day, and regularly ran newspaper articles about black citizens that portrayed them in a positive light. Second, the brother of the individual I was researching was a local celebrity due to his good-nature. They nicknamed him ""Commodore Perry Stout"", published interviews with him, and he was often entrusted with house-sitting for white families in the community when they left on vacation. In one such interview he was asked to name his former owner, which he did. This is the third factor, which is that the owner was a very wealthy individual who had a large amount of military prestige, making him easy to locate.   Thus, I highly recommend looking for newspaper articles on any and all of your individual's siblings and parents (if you know them), as well as their offspring. Look for obituary records as well. Often a child's obituary mentions a bit about his or her parents -- so you might find for example that ""so and so was a child of Jacques and Marie Robertson, who came to Quebec in 1800 from London seeking a better life"". If you can obtain the boat record for their immigration, it likely has a port of origin listed, this would be a good place to check as well. People did not always live where the most recent ship came from but, it is a possibility, and may also help you isolate the the general area from which they came.   You may want to do some cursory research on some topics in order to possibly rule out certain explanations. For instance, check whether free blacks were eligible for loyalist benefits in Canada. If so, check UEL records for their names. Check the slavery status in European countries to see whether a free black family could have lived there. Pay particular attention to France since they went to Quebec. Also, check whether period-census records in European countries would have listed free blacks, as well as the US census records (I don't know off the top of my head). If they were listed, you might be able to locate some potential candidates in the records for 1790.  Just some thoughts!"

Marie Cecile Negre dit St Jean   Interesting that her colour is part of her name, and I wonder how exactly 'dit' is translated here. Does that mean her surname is St. Jean, or she's from St. Jean? The only translation I know is 'said,' but clearly that doesn't make much sense here..   Marie-Josephte Brunet-Bourbonnais-Bellecour   Dat hyphenation! I wonder where she'll lead me.   The tree with all this information also claims that Jacques James Robinson was born in Georgia and has two very interesting images attached with the caption: ""James Robinson black soldier. Munster [sic] rolls and desertion paper indicates black soldier, From the records of the National Archives.""   Also very interesting! Considering he was from Georgia, I would've assumed a slavery link, but instead I got a soldier. Or perhaps he was a slave prior to that. I wonder how hard it would be to find more military records for Black soldiers - it at least gives me hope that there may be more documentation somewhere.   Just realized the dates on all three of those document images are in a range too early to actually match Jacques James Robinson if his birthdate really was 1780. Kind of puts a lot of the information on the internet in a really bad light in terms of accuracy, since a lot of people reference them. How no one has noticed this I have no idea.   I wonder if the birthdate is wrong, considering it's the exact same as Marie's - which isn't unheard of, obviously, but you never know. It is entirely possible that it's not the same man, though, as it's not exactly an uncommon combination of names, and considering how many different names this man seemed to have.   Lots of people have marriage between Jacques James Robinson and Marie Trottier listed as 1805 in Delaware. Doesn't seem like it could be true given the birth dates of their children you have listed.   Yeah, it doesn't seem to line up - they were documented in Quebec in 1800 (I think?), so it would seem peculiar to return to the States to get married, then return back to Quebec. It's possible they weren't actually formally married when they arrived in Quebec, or they had children out of wedlock while under the guise of being married, but that seems awfully convoluted. But how many James Robinsons could've married Marie Trottiers in that period?   The forward page from a family history group. It's in French, so I hope you can read that.

This source actually looks legit.   I wonder why he had so many aliases? This guy's a mystery for the ages. I wonder if he was running from something, or just fancied having a lot of different names, or if it was just the result of many, many translation errors..  It also negates the Delaware link as it documents him purchasing property in 1804.  This gives me a lot of food for thought. I can't thank you enough for taking so much time to help me out.

Genealogy,3d3x54,asciident,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:50:27 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're looking at English records, you're probably on the right track.  I've got plenty of English ancestry, and many of my relatives didn't move far away from where they were born.  In general, if a person married or died in an area, there's a good chance they were born there too, particularly the further back you go.    My first suggestion would be to look at FamilySearch, FreeReg and FreeBMD, all of which are free and can provide lots of information.  FreeReg provides transcribed parish records, although it doesn't cover the whole of England.  FreeBMD gives a link to the Civil Registration index of births, marriages and deaths for England and Wales from 1836.  This helps you locate the full record.    Don't forget to look at census records, which date back to 1841.  Depending on when your great grandmother was born, you should be able to find her with both your grandmother, and with her parents.  This will hopefully provide other family information, such as siblings, and year and place of birth.    So, use the other sites to see if anyone else with a similar name was born in that area around the time.  Bear in mind that ages may not always be an exact match.  Also, names and surnames may have variant spellings (eg, I have Newby / Nuby, and a Hellen / Helen / Ellen / Hellenor (same person!) in my tree), so make sure to do a broad search as well.    I'm quite happy to do a search of my own for you to see if I come up with any other alternatives.  After a while though, it can occasionally be a case of this is  the most likely possibility, this is the evidence, this is why I think this.  It's useful to keep notes as to what your evidence is, where you got it from, and what conclusions you can draw from it.  Good luck!"

I've got 120 hints, and all of them are on my wifes side.  Can I ask how you cope with finding the same person with loads of names?  How do you bottom that out.  I want everyone to have the right name, right DOB and everything.  Finding out that people might have slightly wrong spellings is horrifying!"
Genealogy,3d3x54,BookwormZA,3,Mon Jul 13 12:44:57 2015 UTC,"I have a master spreadsheet which I keep a list of all possible name variants (or nicknames), along with indications of whether I have BMD records, census records, military records and anything else.  Naming variations tend to be more an issue the further you go back, as fewer people were literate, so written records tend to be a best guess.  Early 1900s it is probably less of an issue.  As said elsewhere, the green leaves are more of a guide - don't trust them entirely, and definitely don't trust other peoples trees blindly; that way lies misery and despair (yes, I may be talking from hard experience here).    Try to keep a record of everything you search for and find; I've been blogging each couple and that has helped keep me focused on only one or two people at a time and allowed me to keep a record of where I found things.  Save images, and screenshot transcription pages.    I've been going back one couple at a time.  My general process has been along these lines.  1 - For David Newby, what were his parents names?  Is there a baptismal record image available, or only a transcription?  What proof is there that I have the correct person?  Also, marriage records often have the fathers names on.   2 - Are there any indications from census or other records as to where he was born?  3 - Do baptismal records in that area match with a potential David Newby; how many David Newbys, or how many Newby's were born in that area in a 5 year period each way?  If there's only one, then there's a good chance that is the correct person (bearing in mind that not every record is online or recorded).    4 - Often looking for siblings can help find a match to parents.  Are there siblings?  Search for the surname on its own.  Also, family names can get repeated; there are several David Newbys in my line.    5 - Are there any marriage records for my putative parents for David, particularly again in the 10 years leading up to his birth?  Do their ages make sense?  6 - Do my putative parents exist in a census record with David (bearing in mind that if a mother in particular has died and the father has re-married, the census may still indicate the second wife as the mother).  7 - Are there any estate files for a Newby that may have other family members names in.  With respect to census records, the UK ones only go up to 1911, so you won't be seeing your grandmother, but you should be able to find your grandfather.   Again, if your grandmother had siblings that were born prior to 1911, then search for them.    So, I'd search FreeReg / FreeBMD for your gran for 2 years either side of 1914.    Search for any siblings.  Search for any potential marriages between 1905 and 1914.  Hope that helps."

Looking in the births list for 1878 +/-1 I found a William Steadman in born in Birmingham Apr, May, Jun.  Is this likely to be my great grandfather?  I then found this page in the 1881 census in Birmingham, which lists a William Steadman aged 3 which fits the DOB I found for him.  Is this likely to be my great granfather William Steadman?

You can then also order his birth certificate using the details here.    There are several William Steadman's that were baptised in Birmingham.   Unfortunately none match up with a William Steadman born in 1878, but it does imply that William is a family name.    There does seem to be only one William born in Birmingham in 1878.  However, a check on FindMyPast also gives a three year old William Steadman who died in 1881; doesn't give his parents names though.

Putting the pieces together, if this is the same Ellen Jane from the 1911 census she would have been 20 when she married William in 1897.  Going back to the 1911 census, Ellen Jane the daughter (who died) is listed as 14 years old which means she was born when Ellen Jane the mother was 20.  It seems reasonable that Ellen Jane Hardware, got pregnant and married William, or married him and got pregnant shortly after and produced the Ellen Jane who was 14 in 1911.

Was this your thinking too?   It was apparently far from uncommon for brides to be pregnant on their wedding day - the fabulously titled My Ancestor was a Bastard puts the rate in the 19th century at around 20-30%. Ellen Jane Steadman's baptism is listed in the Warwickshire baptism collection on Ancestry; she was born 13 July 1897 and baptised on 24 July, so Ellen Jane the elder was definitely pregnant when she married (in the second quarter of 1897). Sadly Ellen Jane the younger died within a couple of months as her death is recorded in the third quarter of 1897.   Importantly that baptism record gives a few other clues: the father's name is shown as William Henry Steadman and the address is Little Park St, occupation machinist. It's hard to read the writing but it looks as if the family had moved to Much Park St in 1900 when Elsie Elizabeth was born. In the 1901 Census there is an Elizabeth Steadman aged 24 and daughter Elsey aged 5 months living in Much Park St - but no William. He must have been away from home. I can only find one William Steadman in the 1901 Census who seems possible to be him; he's a boarder in Alexandra St, Birmingham, and gives his age as 29 and birthplace Birmingham. (Edit: but he gives his marital status as single, so possibly not the same one).  Looking for all the Steadmans in the Warwickshire baptisms (alas, I can't link as my Ancestry links are .com.au) we also find that there were two William Henry Steadmans fathering children in Coventry at that time. The other family are William Henry and Rosa, who live in Colchester Street; he's a watchmaker. But he was born in Coventry and by 1911 he's living in Northamptonshire.  None of this answers whether they're your Steadmans but it might give you a few more leads to chase :)"

Write down everything you know about your family, whether it's confirmed or just rumour or names you were told once but only partly remember. Places, professions, family legends, names, everything. Then work back using those as clues - even though they may be exaggerated or misremembered, they are at least a starting point.  So you might want to see if there are other birth records which could be your grandmother, to give you an idea of how much confirming/denying you have to do. If there's only one which seems to fit, great - if not, start with the most logical one and see if you can confirm with more details later. Then I would try looking for the marriage record. Search for a marriage of a Thorpe + your grandmother's surname within a logical timeframe for her birth. You may find more than one. It's surprising how often that happens. It's difficult to confirm for absolute, incontrovertible fact that it's the right birth without other facts that add up. You might be able to find something in the census or a probate/will record that helps confirm it.  If any of these people were alive prior to 1911 you could try searching the census records, which are pretty amazing sources of info, and seeing if any of that matches up with the info you have. Probate records can be a good way to find names of next of kin and last addresses - I've broken down a couple of brick walls using the probate indexes. Don't underestimate the more obscure indexes either, like obituaries, directories, voter lists etc."

You do need to be more accurate with your search terms and wildcard uses though because of the credits used to work through the search results. Good luck!

Genealogy,3d1cby,shurigen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:49:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  In the marriage record, it lists her last name as Popiniak which is possibly (and likely) a misspelling of Papierniak.  Because, In Paul's Obit, there is an Anton Papierniak and in 1905, Anton is married to a Katherine Papierniak.  But, as your 1905 census states, Katherine is married to Paul Zwolinkski.  But, it couldn't be the same Katherine as Katherine was married to Paul and not to Anton.  And, the 1905 census of Katherine/Anton says Katherine is 30 years old which would have put her in 1875 and Katherine/Paul was born in 1868.  So, it's got to be a different Katherine.  Plus, as the ""extra bit"" about Paul's sister shows, it's got to be the same Paul which would make it the Katherine I'm looking for.  Could it be just a record's error?  The wrong Katherine?  Or is there a (better) logical explanation that I'm missing...  Since...Agnes's obit says, ""surviving sister"" and not ""half sister"" or ""step-sister"" Mrs. Paul Zwolinski; one has to assume that they have the same set of parents and that would make them Martin Trojorn and Tekla Chrobrin.  That matches with your earlier post of Katherine Mastey/Heinl's death record showing Agnes Trojan (sister of Katherine).

Was their a constant surname that was handed down generation to generation?  Or was it always the given name plus the father's name + sen/dttr and that's it?    As in, would Christian's father, Mons, said his second (last) name was Monsen or just Rasmusen, after his father?  If so, does that mean when researching you're not really looking for a long line of Monsen's, but rather just going step by step, learning the name of the previous generation's father based on the second/last name of whoever you are currently looking at?

So, yes, once the family came to the U.S., the naming practice ended/froze. Before then and in most Scandinavian countries today, the concept of a surname passed down through the generations is still weak. See also librarian16's third point. So, Mons Rasmusen's father was named Rasmu(s). You won't know his surname until you figure out his father's name. English used to do this, too. We have lots of names like Johnson, Hanson, etc. (the doubled s for the possessive often gets dropped). The Scandinavian cultures correct for gender for the women, too, though: -dtr, -dr.

I tried backing into these questions every which way I could think of. Amazing - thank you again.   Librarian16 , I believe you are probably correct too - that they came into town and registered the family. Mental picture of the family in the City Clerks office giving the clerk this info as he jots it down in this very book. Nice.   I am still curious about the word 'color' being crossed out. Wondering where this information was transcribed from? Not just for Sophrona, but historically at this place in our history."
Genealogy,3cxlj0,phronimost,2,Sat Jul 11 20:06:43 2015 UTC,"Here's how it generally went in small-town New England: The town clerk was obliged to record any births in the town, but at that time births would not have been reported immediately as a matter of course. Vermont clerks weren't required to report births annually to the state until 1857, so there was no urgency. A diligent clerk would have to visit each family and compile a family record, or else ask that they bring their family Bible to him for transcription. You can see that these family records were each compiled at once, in the same hand, on the same day. Other times you will find children added to the record as they were born.  The card that you found for Sophrona would have been created long after the fact by a later town clerk. The card has entries for ""Color,"" ""Mother's Birthplace,"" etc., that the original record didn't mention. So the later clerk (a guy named Henry West, who was only seven years old when the original record was made) crossed out ""Color"" and ""No. of Child of Mother"" and used those spaces to add the extra information found in the record."
Genealogy,3cxlj0,phronimost,2,Sat Jul 11 20:38:28 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Color doesn't work, cross it out and write ""born"" No. of Child of Mother doesn't work write ""Lyme NH"".   Well done Henry West.   Thank you for this historical walk through a city clerk's job in 17th Century Vermont.  My kids are talking about it - handwriting into books? Did they just carry it around? How did they save it? Priceless.   As someone who has worked as a DBA, I do understand the power of just one stroke of the pen and improvisation.   Edit: DBA = Database Administrator"
Genealogy,3cxlj0,librarian16,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:19:18 2015 UTC,"It's a miracle that any of these records survived. A small New England town might have had a building where meetings were held, but the town records were often kept at the house of whoever had been elected that year to serve as town clerk. It was a part-time job, and he would often work from home.  In the town just south of mine, all of the early records were lost when the clerk's house burned in the 1840s. Some were just plain lost. Occasionally you'll hear of a book of town records popping up on eBay.  You also have to deal with the penmanship of the various clerks. One 19th-century clerk in my hometown was up in years, and must have had a hand tremor, because the records he kept are barely legible.  It is amazing that, before the age of typewriters and photocopiers, every town, city, county and state depended on clerks to copy by hand the legal documents that passed their desks. Every deed registered had to be copied so the original could be returned. Preprinted forms were sometimes used, but often the entire document would have to be rewritten. Wills filed with a probate court were retained, but were usually copied into a separate book. I marvel at the endurance of these clerks. I can't write a check without my hand cramping up."

The card is a clerk's copy of the record from the original ledger, at some point. Vermont census taker skipped the 1850 Census designations of white, black or mulatto, I see?!

A couple of decades later we see 'Indian' for Native American.  Where she came from - I'm almost certain that is what is in 'No. of Child of Mother' field.  My family has a ""snuck under the side of a teepee"" story - but most families do, don't they? That statement is the whole story - no one can say more.

I actually own three different genealogy packages for Mac, and tried Heredis 2015 to see what it has to offer.  Overall, I like it quite a bit.  I think it has a nice implementation of shared events, handles event witnesses quite well, and does a great job with mapping, letting you see all event locations for a family at one time (they call it Family Migrations).  I also think the UI is quite attractive.  On the down side, I don't like the overly structured use of Places that they've implemented, which doesn't support a lot of what you encounter in historical records.  I also I feel they've made a few unusual UI choices, but that might just be me getting used to it.  I have encountered at least three bugs over the past week or so, and found that Heredis doesn't completely support GEDCOM 5.5.1.  They only support option you have is their forum.  Heredis is a French company and I think that something is getting lost in translation on the forum.  It's often that someone asks a question and the answer doesn't quite address what was asked.  Bottom line though is that the strengths outweigh the weaknesses for me, and I'm in the process of migrating my main family tree to Heredis.  Let me know if you have any questions."

SNPs present in other haplogroups may by chance mutate independently on another line but that is very rare and testing for that with individual SNP tests is a waste of money.

That will give you roughly 400 and some odd STR results, and most of the SNPs you're likely to run into with the R haplogroup.

Also, do any of the vital records for the children of James/John/Elizabeth indicate where in Ireland their parents were born?  Looking at the 1901 Irish census, the surname Gourley was predominantly Presbyterian, which would provide more evidence for your Ulster theory:  1901 Census of Ireland, Gourley, sorted by most popular religion: 293 : Presbyterian 95 : Church of Ireland 59 : Roman Catholic 11 : Methodist 10 : Breathern 10 : Episcopalian 8 : Church of England 8 : Unitarian 8 : Baptist 4 : United Free Church of Scotland 1 : Church of Scotland  Of course, nothing says that they couldn't have converted to episcopalianism once in America.   But the surname seems relatively rare - you can probably investigate all instances of the surname to narrow down which county is the most likely to have been their point of origin.  Have you tried looking at the Tithe Applotment books?   Griffiths valuation for the surname 'Gourley' would also be very useful, however the primary valuation was completed after the date you believe they emigrated. In this case, the valuators' notebooks, letterbooks etc. may be more useful, as the work in the north was carried out earlier, from 1826-1844. This link has more info.  Here's what John Grenham says in his 'Tracing Your Irish Ancestors' book about Prebyterian records (hint: PRONI stands for Public Records Office of Northern Ireland):  PRESBYTERIAN RECORDS  Dates  In general, Presbyterian registers start much later than those of the Church of Ireland, and early records of Presbyterian baptisms, marriages and deaths are often to be found in the registers of the local Church of Ireland parish. There are exceptions, however. In areas that had a strong Presbyterian population from an early date, particularly in the north-east, some registers date from the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.  The only published listing remains that included in Margaret Falley’s Irish and Scotch-Irish Ancestral Research (reprinted GPC, 1988). This, however, gives a very incomplete and out-of-date picture of the extent and location of the records. For the six counties of Northern Ireland, and many of the adjoining counties, the PRONI Guide to Church Records provides a good guide to the dates and locations of surviving registers.  The nature of the records  Presbyterian registers record the same information as that given in the registers of the Church of Ireland (see above). It should be remembered that after 1845 all non-Roman Catholic marriages, including those of Presbyterians, were registered by the state. From that year, therefore, Presbyterian marriage registers contain all the invaluable information given in state records.  Locations  Presbyterian registers are in three main locations: in local custody, in PRONI and at the Presbyterian Historical Society in Belfast. PRONI also has microfilm copies of almost all registers in Northern Ireland that have remained in local custody and also lists those records held by the Presbyterian Historical Society. For the rest of Ireland almost all the records are in local custody. It can be very difficult to locate these, as many congregations in the South have moved, amalgamated or simply disappeared over the last sixty years. The very congregational basis of Presbyterianism further complicates matters, as it means that Presbyterian records do not cover a definite geographical area: the same town often had two or more Presbyterian churches drawing worshippers from the same community and keeping distinct records. In the early nineteenth century especially, controversy within the Church fractured the records, with seceding and non-seceding congregations in the same area often in violent opposition to each other. Apart from the PRONI listing, the only guide is History of Congregations (Belfast: PHS, 1982; NLI Ir 274108 p 11), which gives a brief historical outline of the history of each congregation. An online version at <www.presbyterianhistoryireland.com> is more up to date. Lewis’s Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837) records the existence of Presbyterian congregations within each civil parish, and Pettigrew and Oulton’s Dublin Almanac and General Register of Ireland (1835) includes a list of all Presbyterian ministers in the country, along with the names and locations of their congregations.  Brian Mitchell’s A New Genealogical Atlas of Ireland (Baltimore, Md.: GPC, 2nd ed., 2002; NLI RR 9292 m 36) maps the locations of historical Presbyterian congregations in the nine counties of Ulster. A brief bibliography of histories of Presbyterianism is given under ‘Clergymen’ in Chapter 12. For Dublin especially, Steven Smyrl’s Dictionary of Dublin Dissent: Dublin’s Protestant Dissenting Meeting Houses, 1660–1920 (Dublin: A. & A. Farmer, 2009) is an excellent guide to the congregations and their records."

Down seems to have the largest number of Gourleys. If they were Presbyterian, it seems from Grenham's description that none of the religious records are available online or are indexed, and are only partly centralized. The only chance you would have at finding these needles in the haystack are if you determine from US records what town, parish or townland they lived in, go to PRONI in Belfast, then find the associated presbyterian records, and then sifted through them manually until you came upon the dates that you've found. Otherwise you could look around on the internet to see if any one has transcribed or indexed presbyterian records.  If that's the case (and we're assuming thats most likely since the 1901 census has the majority of Gourleys as presbyterians) then your better bet would be using Griffiths valuation and the Title Applotment records, since they are not religion specific."

Genealogy,3cjqal,williamlawrence,6,Wed Jul 8 13:18:40 2015 UTC,"It's quite common across the board. I think it happened to some because they really didn't know their age/DOB and just guessed. Sometimes, census records were taken by a person who didn't speak the language well and could have messed it up. In some cases, if the family wasn't home, the census takers would ask the neighbors about your ancestors. Birth dates are often approx. dates based on the age given."
Genealogy,3cjqal,ConfusedGamer307,4,Wed Jul 8 13:25:31 2015 UTC,"I think in addition to the reasons /u/ConfusedGamer307 listed, some people just straight up lied. I found that in each progressive census the women in a family ended up getting younger and younger.  Also, sometimes it depended on what month the census was done in. One year I noticed everyone had a one year discrepancy in their reported age compared to what I expected from prior census' (that they would be exactly 10 years older) and that was because one census was done in August and the other was done in January."
Genealogy,3cjqal,RegularOwl,5,Wed Jul 8 14:31:05 2015 UTC,"Yep.  My great-grandmother definitely lied about her age, as she got less than 10 years older every 10 years.  She ended up losing 4 or 5 years total.  A funny story related to that.  My grandmother is currently 96, and doesn't look like your typical 96 year old; she was fairly spry before an accident, and still gets around well with a cane.  Anyway, in 2000, the census taker came to their door, as my grandparents hadn't sent the form back yet.  So, he asked them about their ages, and he was fine to believe that my grandfather was 84.  He absolutely refused to believe that my grandmother was 81.  She finally said ""fine, I was born in 1929"", making herself 10 years younger.  That's what's on the 2000 census.  My dad and I had a lot of fun telling her that she committed a federal offense."

Genealogy,3cjqal,knightonink,2,Wed Jul 8 15:32:22 2015 UTC,"The day of the census matters a lot. I'm not going to look it all up, but some years it was January 1st, some years it was June 1st or other dates. (Imagine trying to count everyone in the dead of winter.) If a person was born in April, he would be a different age depending on the date of enumeration. That only explains a one year fluctuation. If a person's age changes more than two years from decade to decade, then consider a) bad at record keeping (illiterate), b) don't know and don't care (it's just not important), c) knowingly lying to a government official (I ain't got no still in the woods, either), d) trying to make a person younger or older (""Oh, look. Mabel gets younger and younger each year."")   I double checked my great great grandfather's Census records. He was born before 1850 and died 90 years later, so he was enumerated 9 times. Based on his reported age, his birth year only fluctuated between 1844 and 1845 that whole time.   TLDR: You are a different age each Census depending on what time of year the Census was done."
Genealogy,3cjqal,CovingtonLane,2,Wed Jul 8 16:22:37 2015 UTC,"This is very, very common. 1) People back then had such poor literacy skills and had just too many other day-to-day concerns to worry about to make ends meet that they really didn't care about specific dates as much. 2) Sometimes the census enumerators interviewed the person themselves and got the correct date; other times the person in question wasn't available, so the enumerator was forced to find a proxy who knew as much as possible about that person but may still have had to guess at specific dates. 3) If your ancestors are from places where the old Julian Calendar was still in use and then later immigrated to an area using the newer Gregorian Calendar, then two different dates could in fact be correct for the same person under their respective calendar systems. 4) Most official government documents these days require signatures at the bottom verifying accuracy, etc.  In the old days signatures weren't necessarily required, so the government official could fill the paperwork out even after the person left--and without the person still there, any incomplete portions remaining (like birth year) might just be estimated by the government official.  Even if the respective person was still there, they may be too functionally illiterate to review the document completely for accuracy.  Some people were able to sign their names but read little else."
Genealogy,3cjqal,theduder3210,2,Wed Jul 8 16:37:38 2015 UTC,"1) check the census...in some cases the question was ""age on next birthday"", in some ""age on last birthday"" (And as Covington!sne notes some yrs April census, some June) 2) no, they didn't always know their actual birth year...the year of the famine, the year of the flood, two years after my brother Amos... 3) they fibbed! freely! often! my grandmother was four yrs older than her husband...shocking! and we have records reporting a whole range! of birth years ..including the old country birth certificate that gives the game away. For late 19 th c immigrants I've seen age swings of as much as 6 years, same person. Most truth telling seems to be in draft cards and naturalization and passport applications."
Genealogy,3cjqal,librarian16,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:54:15 2015 UTC,"This is something that got me too.  However like everything else we do we need context.  Back then, it really didn't matter if you were born in 1890 or 1888.  You were Baby, Child, Young, Adult, Old.  If you were a capable body you were capable, simple as that.  It mostly boils down to ""It didn't matter enough"" for them to care to get it right.  The earlier census may (probably, definitely?) were done by someone who knew them since birth and would likely be better able to get the year correct, while later in life when they have moved out and are dealing with their own children's information, it slips and they get the year wrong.  Intentional or not, it is an interesting effect that I do believe is a widespread problem in the census records."
Genealogy,3cjqal,arrakchrome,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:35:41 2015 UTC,"Before the SSA era began and certainly before the easy sharing of data between government entities, there was plenty of fibbing about ages, miscommunication, and information gotten from third parties (it wasn't uncommon for an enumerator to ask a neighbor about a household that wasn't answering the door). Some people genuinely did not know their own birth dates, even if they were otherwise literate. My own great-grandfather was a policeman who wrote police reports, read newspapers, etc. According to his children, he was not 100% sure about the day, month, or exact location of his birth."
Genealogy,3cjqal,asciident,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:53:33 2015 UTC,"To continue with what I just wrote on this thread with a more personal example, one of my relatives actually ""changed"" her birthdate, so government documents conflict for her birthday.  She was born in a rural area, and by the time her parents got around to going to town to register her birth, they had forgotten the exact date and estimated it.  She then used that estimated date most of her life--but since it was a) only estimated and b) also happened to be three days away from a major holiday, she started celebrating her birthday only ONE day from that holiday instead when she became older--so visiting friends and family could celebrate both the holiday and her birthday while they were still in town.  By the time she died, the new date that she used was considered the ""correct"" date on newer legal documents, her obituary, her gravestone, etc. (technically, it may have even been her real birthdate, since her original birthdate was only estimated--but the date that she used the early part of her life was probably actually more accurate)."
Genealogy,3ch1tk,MrQuestionAsker888,3,Tue Jul 7 21:13:45 2015 UTC,"Some of these may or may not relate to you. I'm not sure quite what to make of your birth certificate or your christening transcriptions, but I'm going to link some of the stuff that I've found just in case it's of assistance.  1851 Census  George Juden (b. 1843) on the 1851 Census is found living in Beeding, Sussex, with his (quite large) family. Father Richard Juden (b. 1799), Mother Mary (b. 1803). His siblings are Richard (19), Alfred (16), Mary (14), Caroline (11), Walter (11), George (7), Frederick (5), Elizabeth (3) and Harrt (Harriet? 6mos).  If we assume that Richard and Mary married sometime in the year before Richard Jr's birth, we'd be looking for a marriage in approximately 1831-32, which pre-dates the registries. FreeReg doesn't seem to have them either.  By 1861, George is living as a boarder, with Thomas and Harriet Muzzell and their children Sarah and Ellen. 1861 Census  What makes this particularly interesting is that while I was looking for a marriage between George's mother and father, Richard and Mary, I found a marriage for Richard Jr to Bengemina (also spelled Benjamina) Muzzell.  Incidentally, if these are the right Judens, Walter and Caroline, while close to the same age, weren't twins. They do seem to have been born less than a year apart, though. There's also another George Juden, born 1845, in the same registration district as the 1843 George Juden. I think you might have a few different Juden families here, all in close proximity to each other, and all giving their kids the same names. What fun. ;)  If there's anything I can do to help out, I might be able to tackle this again, but I think your best tactic is to work at this from another angle (through the rest of the family perhaps).

Genealogy,3cevpk,arrakchrome,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:43:31 2015 UTC,This is a long shot however:  http://imgur.com/gallery/I1NVW  This is a letter that was written with some kind of cryptography.  This isn't my cup of tea so I don't even know where to start.
Genealogy,3cevpk,wilfordbremley,2,Tue Jul 7 23:46:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know that this is a cipher per se. It is more of a cryptic shorthand. It seems to follow some general rules but the person who wrote it doesn't stick to them all the time. Here is a rough description of the shorthand:   Each word begins with the first letter of the word. If it is a single letter word, such as ""a"" or ""I"", it is simply written as such. Two letter words are usually terminated by a ""-"", which takes the place of the final letter. E.g., ""by"" becomes ""b-"".  Rarely, three letter words are terminated in the same way, in which the last two letters are replaced by a single hyphen. E.g., ""and"" is sometimes ""a-"".  Most words which are three letters or longer end with the final letter of the word, with every letter in-between being replaced by a hyphen. E.g., ""that"" becomes ""t-t"". Sometimes the first or last two letters are written in order to avoid ambiguity when using more unusual words. Sometimes, common English shorthand gets combined with this cryptic shorthand. E.g., ""received"" becomes ""r-cd"", ""without"" becomes ""w-o"".  Sometimes longer words with multiple syllables have the first letter of each syllable written, with the letters between each of those replaced by a ""-"". E.g., ""depended"" becomes ""d-p-d"".  Sometimes multiple exceptions are combined, e.g., ""blindfolded"" becomes ""bl-f-d"".    In my opinion, this is a transcription of an interview, possibly police or court in nature based upon the structure. The same person wrote down both the question asked as well as the answer. The first page is easier to figure out than the second. Also, the questions are easier to figure out than the answers.   On the second page, the writer seems more excited/rushed/sloppy. He starts writing the questions and answers on the same lines. Some ""-""s become "".""s and sometimes they are omitted altogether.   In my opinion, this describes the initiation ritual of a group.  The key to figuring out the topic is to determine what is meant by a specific term that appears multiple times in the document: ""R-l A-h p-e"" -- see lines 5 and 21 of page 1 where it is mentioned. Also, it appears multiple times on page 2 as ""RAPm"".   EDIT: Does this stand for Royal Arch Purple?  I transcribed as best I could most of the first page. Here is what I got. Sorry there are a lot of blanks.  http://imgur.com/XfBQhUK  After that point, the context is difficult to follow. The interviewee names some people by initials. Interviewer starts asking how to get ""there"". The interviewee gives a bizarre answer that I think says ""by way of dry land"". There are a bunch of questions with short answers, and then the interviewer asks the interviewee ""what was asked of you?"". The interviewee tells him but it is heavily shorthanded and hard to say what it means. After this point it appears that many words are being reduced to single letters. E.g., interviewer asks ""C- y m?"" Interviewee answers ""I c-."" Interviewer asks ""H- d- y- m?"" I assume this is   ""can you [make/meet]?"" ""I can."" ""How do you [make/meet]?""  The interviewee answers ""B-6"", and the interviewer asks ""Why B-6?"". The interviewee explains something about not ""12"", and the interviewer presses further about ""12"".  Key here is that what comes next is not a conversation about measurements. The ""x""s are used to denote when one person stops talking and the other starts.   Seems that the conversation goes:  ""Were you given a number?"" ""I was."" ""What is your number?"" ""2 1/2"" ""Why 2 1/2?"" ""It's 2. And a half."" ""What's 2 and a half?"" ""I-T-O-R-T-T-O-S a-t - 1/2 t- o- m-h"". The interviewer asks more about the 1/2, then about the RAPm. The second page ends shortly after.  Hope that helps.  EDIT: R-l A-h P-e = ROYAL ARCH PURPLE?????? Thought just occurred to me."

These three documents were all recorded on the same day (27 Aug. 1856) in Book O, Vol. 8, pages 141-144. I've uploaded them as two images here and here.

It says, I think, (knowing little italian, I might be wrong) that he married Maria Giuseppa de Siano, in the presences of Gennaro Asprea? and Domenico Mattera. This is the ancestor i'm looking for records about and trying to clear up the confusion.  Note: I am 98% sure that his parents names are Stanislao and Carmela. He has a brother Vincenzo, and I acquired the names off of his records."

Im willing to help but dont want to sign up for a wild goose chase.  Can you hook me/us up with the 100% known info and documents you have. For example, the earliest census with the people you are looking for, how you know the years of birth, who is your direct descendant, who the descendants wife is, were they married in italy, how you know the parents are carmela and stanislao, and how you know this is the correct town to be looking in. This will help tons.  As an aside, if you know the parents are 100% stanislao and carmela then what I would do is first find their marriage records then comb all the births forward from there; that should rake out all the siblings.

Genealogy,3c8ka0,Lydie325,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:02:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know some things!  :-)  John and James are the names of two of Joseph's sons, and in the census they don't seem to live far from Joseph, so despite the common first names, I assume they are his sons.  Reason (which is how the name should be spelled) is an interesting case.  His descendant also did a Y DNA test and at the 25 marker level he matched my uncle perfectly.  When we went to 37 markers, there was a one-step mismatch.  He must be related, but possibly not closely.  He is the right age to be Joseph's son, but he's not in any lists of those siblings, and there is that one step genetic distance.  His descendant was rather bummed when we went from perfect match to ... not so perfect.  She has researched Reason Coffman to the best of her ability, but he is her brick wall just as Joseph is mine."

We have had a bit of difficulty in determining his death date and place.  He was born about 1836 in Terrebone, Quebec. He was a baker by profession. He married Rosalie Seguin on 18 August 1863 in Roxton Falls, QC. Together they had about 11 children between 1864 and 1888 (Joseph, Rosalie, Alexina, Arthur, George, Armand, August, Marie, Louise, Laura, and Pierre). He preceded her in death, which means he died prior to 26 October 1921. She died in Lowell, Massachusetts. However, we also know that the family lived in Rhode Island for some time.  Any clues would be greatly appreciated."

It is still possible that it is not him, because I am pretty sure that Joseph's father was Augustin. But that wouldn't be the first time such a record was wrong.

I'll list them here in case you happen to find them or want to look. Otherwise, I would love to hear about your experience searching there for a time I can get there myself! I've only done online research and face to face research with family.  -Very Rev. Joseph Zelechivsky 1890-1980. His death record should be here since he passed away in Providence. I'm hoping there is info on his parents and birthplace (I believe it was Borynia, Ukraine though I'd love confirmation).  -Walter Nahod 1919-1963. Again, looking for the death record. I'm not sure it will hold any new info but I'm curious nonetheless.   -Stella Zysk (Zisk) 1896-1985 and Nickolas Nahod (Nachod) 1896-1936. I'm looking for death records for both. I also believe their marriage certificate is in RI. The date is June 17 1918 and the names on the record are Stella Zysk and Nicolaj Naked. I know so little about either of these people and I am hoping these records will hold some clues on where they came from.

The State Archives won't have the death records of Joseph or Stella. The State Archives only carries death records older than 50 years.  Since Joseph and Stella died in the '80s, those records would likely be at the Rhode Island Department of Health (http://www.health.ri.gov/records/howto/getacopy/), where the records are private and obtaining a copy costs money.  Likewise, the State Archives only carries marriage records 100 years or older, so unfortunately the Archives wouldn't likely have Stella and Nickolas's marriage certificate.  But it's close enough that I will try.  I will look for Walter's death record as well as Nick's.  I'll also see what I can find with respect to the other records."

That closest I have to weird intermarriage isn't a biological relation at all. Man named John Stansby was an indentured servant to my 9x great aunt (Mary Wells)'s father-in-law. Upon his release he married Anne Wells, Mary's younger sister. Anne Died. John marries the widowed Mary Sprye Harmer, my 8x great grandmother.

I am talking about places like Corsica, Sardinia, or Sicily.  My ancestors are from a small island called Ischia, which is off Naples. I have traced ancestors back to the 18th Century, and all but three people were born there, lived their whole life there and died there. I have found the same last names all over the place.

Both sets of Great-Grandparents were married at the same church in Greenwhich Village by the same Pastor, 2 years apart.

The Church was Anglican, not Catholic... That's important because my G-Grandfather was Catholic, so it was likely his wife's church, the bride.  I don't know anything about her father.  If it was her church, it was likely her father's.    Being that I don't know anything about her father, my G-G-Grandfather, the possibility exists that he is somehow related to my other G-Grandparents.

""What were your favourite things about being a kid in the [1930s]?"" - ""Who are the people you remember best from when you were little?"" - ""What did you want to be when you grew up?"" (etc.)  Personal questions open the door to talking about all sorts of thing - thoughts, feelings, perceptions - that you can't get anywhere else.   Like /u/robspeaks says, most of the hard facts you can get from official records. Other intangible stuff just gets lost. I wanted to know what my maternal great-grandmother was really like, personality-wise. I had heard so many stories about her, some of them amusing, some of them disturbing. I met some distant relatives (including a great-aunt on my paternal side) who happened to have known her when they were young. ""Tell me about her"" was the best thing to ask, because then they just told me their own thoughts/perceptions. And later I could piece all of these things together to come to an understanding of my own that I couldn't get from any official records.   Certainly ask if you can record while you chat. That way you're not too busy writing to listen. And don't be afraid to go on tangents. If your grandpa wants to talk about his best friend when he was 9 or what it was like to work in a cotton field when he was 14 -- just let him talk.   Also, you could ask him what family stories he remembers being told by older generations. He may recall hearing a rumour that Johnny wasn't really the father of Mary's baby....or that great uncle Walter moved away from home and never got in touch again because he was ""peculiar"" and didn't get along with his dad. Old family stories (even the really far-fetched ones) may hold a kernel of truth and may point to long-buried secrets...  I find all of that stuff utterly fascinating!

Genealogy,3bzmdq,sesquipedalianish,2,Fri Jul 3 13:56:20 2015 UTC,"I've found it's best to let their personality dictate how the interview goes.  If your grandpa is on the quiet side, you should make sure you're prepared to direct the conversation.  If he's a talker, it's probably best to give him the occasional nudge but otherwise let him yap away on whatever topic he likes.  Definitely record it if he's comfortable with that.  It's great to get names, places and dates, but those usually are things you can find later anyway.  If my grandfathers were still alive, I would be asking them stuff you can't find in a census or on a birth certificate.  So my main advice is don't get too hung up on the details.  Figuring out what your grandpa has to say is more important than checking things off a list."
Genealogy,3bzmdq,robspeaks,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:27:44 2015 UTC,"I had the pleasure of interviewing both of my grandparents before they passed away.  I had different experienced with each, yet both are telling and both were very helpful.  First, research what you already know.  This will tell you gaps in your knowledge of their lives.  This will also tell you some of the more interesting things about their lives you may want to focus on.  Second, draw up several questions.  This may be fill in missing information, further detail what you have a little on or just to confirm what you already know.  Leave these questions open ended or extremely specific.  What year did you move to X?  Tell me about your parents?  Three, let them know at the start the purpose, what you are looking for, and how it will go in general.  Also let them know that if they are uncomfortable answering something that it is okay (and it should be okay!), some topics people don't like to talk about; maybe some people don't talk money, others may have had a terrible PoW experience wile others may have been a part of something horrific and are willing to talk about it.  You don't know someones answer or reaction until it is asked so you have to make it okay for them to say that you have to move on - and respect their choice to not talk about it!  Four, let them talk.  People as they age tend to take their time in remembering details.  If you lead them (intentional or not) you may be getting false information.  If they can't remember move on, this is something else that you should lay out with them in Step 3.  When I conducted mine I went in a more chronological manner, instead of jumping from time frame to time frame.  I let them go on, but once that story arch was done I brought them back in time to the next thing.  Whatever makes sense to you to do, but this worked for me.  For me Grandpa was a story teller (as am I; can you tell?) so it didn't take much to get him to talk.  Just a little nudge about what we wanted to talk about next.  Grandma was harder, I needed to ask a lot more questions.  I got far fewer stories but a lot of useful information.  Five, find a quiet place to conduct an interview.  Let people know who may be around what you are doing and tell them you are not to be disturbed.  I was lucky that my mother took the other out for a few hours while I conducted the interview, so I had a whole quiet house.  Six, set aside 2 hours, or more for the process.  Seven, try to get a historical context.  For instance my grandfather was a logger during the end of world war 2.  Ask about how they perceived huge world events.  Ask about things you have heard about, like loggers being exempt from the draft, did people purposefully become loggers to dodge the draft?  He was on the west coast, did they have any military interactions?  The answer was yes and yes, the military actually gave camps of loggers pistols and rifles.  And finally, if you can, record it.  Taking notes takes time and you don't capture the essence of what is being said.  You can also miss details and slow the flow of the interview.  Good luck!"
Genealogy,3bzmdq,arrakchrome,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:57:14 2015 UTC,"Ask the same questions a couple times in different ways throughout the interview, often times you will tease out little bits of information that didn't come to mind the first time. Don't do it in a way that will annoy the person :)      Sometimes you will ask something like ""Tell me about your grandparents"", and that is good, but afterwards, try to be more specific, use things you can piece together. They may not think of telling you about your great grandmother's love of collecting stamps, but if you ask ""Did they have any hobbies"", you may find out something new.   At the same time, try not to wear them down.  Ask mostly about his opinions and his experiences, details and dates you can get later.      He is the doorway to even older relatives, while you are interested in him and his stories, you also want to know what stories the older relatives told him before they died.  Very important, if possible record the audio or video, with their permission. If they are not comfortable at first, push the issue gently.

Genealogy,3bvvg4,GallusMagnus,2,Thu Jul 2 17:13:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not the OP, but there is a tool that allows people to upload photos of graves and let others transcribe them, much like how BillionGraves does it now. Right now, there are no photos to transcribe though.  There are two major problems that I think need to be fixed.  1-There is no way for people to link photos of the same grave together before uploading them. Thus, if someone uploads two photos of a grave, say a full shot and a close-up of a name, the photos may get separated with no way to find what grave the close-up belongs to if the surname isn't included. This is especially problematic with a single grave containing multiple family members. Often, the surname is given once either on the top or the back of the grave. If one takes a close-up photo of the given names, the surname may not often be included.  2-There is a bug where multiple people download the same batch of images, which makes one lose their work if someone else uploads the transcribed data first. This problem often happens when there are few photos to transcribe.  EDIT: One more problem.  3-The report function doesn't work at all. If there is a grave in a foreign language that one doesn't understand, they can report it if they can't read it (someone else will transcribe it, the photo isn't discarded). However, when I've reported foreign graves, I've seen the same ones appear again in the queue for me to transcribe."
Genealogy,3bvvg4,GallusMagnus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:15:36 2015 UTC,"1--I think there is a way to link, I've seen photos with a little white infinity symbol on an angle - like a chain link.

If you're new to research, it can be difficult to know what your looking for, especially for such a specific historic case.

Do you have any of that information now, or would you be able to ask other members of your family? Word of mouth is always a great resource with family research!

Genealogy,3btoio,giunta13,2,Thu Jul 2 01:42:14 2015 UTC,"Here's another example of the term, except this one is a ""maestro magliettiere.""  From what I gather, a magliettiere would have shaped iron with a maglietto (a diminutive of maglio). The process is described here:   The primary cell, the fundamental productive unit of colonization introduced by the Genoese capitalist merchants was the ferriera, the plant where the iron-ore was transformed into iron by a system of direct reduction. Flanking the ferriera was the maglietto (hammer). Here the semi-finished product (quaroni) coming from the ferriera was transformed (by heating and beating) into products used by smiths (da piano, verzella,  stazzola) and in some cases into products ready for trading (nails of big dimensions, blowpipes etc.).   The connection between this profession and the word maglietta (T-shirt) is explained here:   Maglia is mesh, maglione means sweater and maglieria means knitting. Two sets of words with similar spelling seem unrelated until we look at cotta di maglia. Cotta di maglia is chainmail. The interwoven forged metal rings of chainmail are assembled in a pattern that resembles knitting. In this light a maglio is a mallet specifically used for the creation of chainmail (maglia).   Maglietta would be a small mesh, such as that used in making T-shirts."

Six months after my grandfather was born.   Will Smith, I can not find anything on him. I know he died before Jeffie, so time frame should be 1911-1912 on death. I believe his most likely locations were Warren County, Sharkey County, Humphrey County, or Yazoo County, MS.  Family rumor says Will Smith's father was named ""Caney Bayou"" Smith.

With German records from protestant parts of Prussia I know I need to find the marriage record, with a bit of luck this allows me to tie 3 generations together.   But when I got the marriage records of my relatives who got married in the USA it was a complete non-event (nothing but names and ages), even though they were recent immigrants and got married in a protestant church built by German immigrants. :(   With a typical German marriage record from Prussia during 1815-1874 I can expect full names, names of both sets of the parents, dates and places of birth for both groom and bride, information whether the parents are still living and if yes where, profession of the groom, professions of the fathers of the groom and the bride.  If I get lucky I can also find out whether the parents have been remarried, the death date and place of burial of the parents if they are deceased and place of last residence for the parents.   Finally, if any illegitimate children have been born to the couple before the marriage I'll also find out in the marriage record.     So is there any kind of record in the USA that has similar details? What is usually your best primary source?"
Genealogy,3bambs,floramarche,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:31:17 2015 UTC,"It depends on when and where. Each state began gathering vital statistics at different times, so what you'll get varies depending on where you are.  The state I am most familiar with is Ohio. Marriage records were kept very early, as soon as a local government were formed. These, like the one you saw, gave only the names of the people marrying unless one was underage (and admitted being so). In that case, the parent or guardian would sign the marriage license (a separate document until the 1870s or so) giving their consent. It wasn't until 1898 or so that marriage records began providing the parties' dates and places of birth, occupations, residence, parents' names, and whether either had been previously married. If the answer to this last question was yes, initially the only information about those previous marriages was their number. Starting around WWI these began specifying if the previous marriage(s) had ended by death or divorce, and after some time the dates of these were given also.  Birth and death records were kept by the county from 1867-1908. These give the names (rarely full), and date and place of the event. Birth records gave the parents' names, including mother's maiden name, and where they lived. Death records gave the deceased's age, sometimes specified in years, months, and days; their occupation, if any; their residence, marital status, and cause of death. Their parents' names were occasionally given toward the last twenty years of this period, but this is rare. Birthplaces were often given, but usually only at state level. The first 10 years or so, record keeping was somewhat haphazard, and even after this it's not unusual to find no birth or death record for an individual.  After 1908 the State began holding birth and death records, and these specified all dates, locations, and parents' names.   No records give parents' occupations or birth/death/burial locations. Nor was the existence of illegitimate children acknowledged except on their own birth records, if they had any.     These vital records are still the best primary sources available, heavily supplemented by census, estate, and land records. Local newspapers and county histories are also very helpful up to a point. Church records are really hit-or-miss -- even if you can identify what denomination they belonged too, there's no central repository for records, meaning each church holds its own records. Fire, flood, congregation collapse, carelessness, all mean the records are gone. This is also a problem with cemetery records -- if you're looking for a burial that happened pre-1860 or so, and there's no stone, it's very unlikely to find a record."
Genealogy,3bambs,asciident,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:06:59 2015 UTC,"As /u/floramarche mentioned, the availability and detail of many records in the US depends a lot on the state or locality and the era. IMO there is no one best primary source, but rather we have to piece together many sources: censuses, birth records, marriage records, death records, naturalization where applicable, marriage records, military records, land and will/probate records."

I can't quite figure out why the marriages are only now being officiated by the priest as they do mention both marriages being registered by lawyers the year before...  edited to add: I have just realized that maybe the consanguinity wasn't discovered until after the marriage was first made, which may mean that the couple(s) needed to re-marry once the bishop gave his permission."

Genealogy,3b8312,IonaMull,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:16:19 2015 UTC,Awesome! I believe one of the surnames is Sacré as it's written in a very similar manner to other records and Sauvé is not one I've seen so far.  This consanguinity issue is a strange one; especially as it looks like one of the ones marrying (Pierre Guillon) had parents that were related. I say this as everywhere in the records it shows the maiden surname of the mother and here it's the same as the father. I can only assume that she was also a Guillon by birth.  I knew it was an odd family!!  Many thanks again.

The fact that they refer to the lawyer as ""former"" (ancien) is a little intriguing too. And I had never seen the terms ""insinué"" (I translated it as registered, but it apparently was a process where someone else than the father would be making a donation/dowry to the marriage) and ""remué de germain"" (which I translated as once removed, but I am not entirely certain it is right).   I wanted to attempt figuring out who's related to who in the long list of uncles and cousins... did you make sense of it all?"

I found this record in Lafayette County probate files in which Lillia, ""a female Child and a Bastard"" between five and six years of age, daughter of Fannie E. Edwards (""of very low and degraded Character""), was bound as an apprentice to James D. Butler in 1895. Butler was living near the Tedder family in 1885. I take it that Fannie was Tisha's sister Frances, and that she married Alexander Edwards in 1890."

I do not know what happened to her 1st husband, I had just assumed he died. It seems to me that his death would have caused such a hardship that she would have not been able to take care of her child. Although this is sad and is quite emotional for me, I am elated to add another piece to the story of these 9 sisters! I can't thank you enough! How did you find this? I'm fairly confident that a general search in familysearch did not bring this up or else I would have already seen this. Also, would this have been considered an adoption?

I think that was the only Tedder record in the index, but you might want to check for related families.  I don't think that this would have been considered an adoption, but with all the requirements placed on Butler to care for the girl, it's similar to a guardianship.  With this added information of Fannie's state of affairs in 1895 (and not knowing when her first husband left the scene), I think it's at least possible that she could have had another child out of wedlock in 1893 and given him the Tedder name.

R1a is maybe 18000 years old, and is a very large group. There are two possible ways to be positive for some and negative for other of the mutations:  Some ancient skeleton could be recovered and tested, and only have some of the mutations - meaning he would be an uncle to Mr. R1a.  There are a few (200 people on familytreeDNA) who split off the main tree around that time - e.g. the R1a* project. It it always possible to have split off at after any mutation. But it is rather rare to find someone who did.  Thus we generally assume that having one means have all - unless proven otherwise.  Two notes:   Some testing methods can give false results - especially false negatives, so focus on positive results, and if you suspect a negative, get a specific test done for that one.

Genealogy,3b1l37,Thundercat9,3,Thu Jun 25 05:55:28 2015 UTC,"They mention some sources - tax lists and church records but only generally, as in ""all the information in this section came from church records""    This is exactly how German churchbook records are sourced. If you have the year, the last names, the type of event and the place it is very easy to find the churchbook entry again because these entries are sorted chronologically. If you want to be super accurate you give something like  ""Baptism 9/1845"", meaning you want the baptism entry number 9 in the year 1845.    So ""churchbook -name of town here- Baptism 9/1845"" is how you source those entries. Some genealogist try to be super accurate and give page numbers, but many churchbooks I have seen have 2-4 different systems for the page numbers. Meaning one person started numbering the pages and then the next person came along, did not like the first system, started over. For this reason page numbers are not used.   Additionally there are two versions of churchbooks out there, the original and the dublicate. The dublicate was created at regular intervals from the original and kept at court. Theoretically both versions should contain the same entries. In practise some entries or remarks in the margins are only contained in the original  and some entries or remarks in the margins are only contained in the dublicate, so it helps to write down ""original"" or ""dublicate"". Note that the pages are numbered differently in the original and in the dublicate, this is another reason page numbers are not used.   Both the original and the dublicate are considered primary sources.     I'm working my way through the family name on Familysearch (Deutschland Geburten und Taufen, 1558-1898)    Keep in mind that this collection contains only a very small amount of the total births and baptisms in Germany during that time. So if things don't match up, don't fret too much.    how accurate is familysearch for German records?    Depends upon the source material.  Please read: https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Germany_Births_and_Baptisms_%28FamilySearch_Historical_Records%29  https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Germany_Births_and_Baptisms_%28FamilySearch_Historical_Records%29/Known_Issues  If the entry in that record is derived from original churchbook entries they are very accurate, apart from the usual transcription error. If it is from IGI or other user-submitted geneaologies the accuracy is up in the air.    Are there any other online sources for Protestant German church records?     Try Archion.de   how would I confirm that information?   Probably through records kept at local archives in Hannover, Bremen, etc.   Records on who was mayor at a given time often go back quite far, one of the towns I am researching has records on it mayors going back to the 13th century and yes, those are freely available in the town archive to anybody who asks. (Personally I hope I can get that far back, but it looks doubtful.)"

Your best bets are genealogy sites like Ancestry, FamilySearch and MyHeritage in the hope that family members have posted their tree there. Once you got a name and birthdate and have established contact with one family member this can open lots of gates, they can tell you who got married, who has children, etc.   I had some luck with getting the full marriage certificates, marriage certificates from that time period often have remarks concerning the children in the margins.

Genealogy,3ap6j5,BookwormZA,9,Mon Jun 22 11:06:04 2015 UTC,"My gggg grandmother, Elizabeth Watson, died in Oct 1898.  As she was over 100 at the time of her death, there were a few news stories about her, and she was termed the Leathley centenarian.  Her first, and only, photo was taken when she was 101.  (I have photos for her, her daughter, her grandson, and her great granddaughter). She was also mentioned in a few books, and I was able to pick up her fathers name, George Cutt, that he was a labourer for the local parson, and that his brother had fought at Waterloo, and where she was born.  She would have been born around 1795 near Doncaster in Hampole, Yorkshire.  Strangely, this would have made her over 30 when she married, and her age in the census increased faster then normal!  There was indeed a George Cutt who lived in the correct area who would have been the correct age to have a child in 1795, but he was a master weaver, not a labourer.  He also did not appear to have a brother who could have fought at Waterloo.  He also did not appear to have a daughter, only two sons, George and Stephen.    The younger George was born in 1788, married in 1804, and had a daughter called Elizabeth in 1806.  Strangely, George was just 16 when he married and his wife, Ruth, was 19.  There's no record of a child arriving just a few months later though.  This George was a veteran of Waterloo as well (appropriately for this week!), and appears to have worked for the vicar in Hampole.  The likelihood is that this is the correct father for my Elizabeth, and that she was only in her 90s when she died.  It also makes her in her 20s when she married which makes more sense.  Her youngest daughter was called Ruth too, which makes me more confident I do have the correct family.    So I, sadly, no longer have a centenarian in my family.  But I do have an interesting tale about how family stories need to always be confirmed."

Due to his date of death, I believe he fought in the Eighth Battle of Isonzo, located in Slovenia. These battles were notorious for harsh winter conditions and difficult geographical terrain. The italian (his ethnicity) casualties reached over 300,000.  Antonio Cappello, son of Carmine, was born August 19, 1895 in Sant'Ambrogio sul Garigilano (Frosinone), Italy. He died at camp from wounds sustained in battle on October 18, 1916. This makes him only 21 years of age. His place of burial is unknown, but thanks to this subreddit, I may have found where he is buried. His remains may either be located in one of two WWI monuments - Oslavia or Redipuglia.   We posses only one photo of Antonio and a single story.   The story goes that he was on leave from the army, sent home for a day rest. His sister, Florinda, picked him up at the train station and brought him home. She promised to cook him his favorite meal, Polenta. However, the wood she was using was wet and it took time to get the fire going. Antonio was going to be late for his train back. So they ran, all the way to the train station. Antonio made it.

This is Mahala Holiday on the 1840 census, I'm not sure who else is with her on the record, you'd have to take a look at the record itself not the summary but it might show Parthena with her family.  This is Mahala Holiday on the 1860 census. She was born in 1799 on this record and appears with what seems to be four children of hers, two called Johnson and two called Holiday. Parthena would fit between the two older children and they are the Holiday kids. The children all say they were born in Louisiana but Mahala says she is from Tennessee.   On the 1870 census Mahala is with her son Washington and his oldest child, Mary, still claiming a birthplace of Tennessee and apparently the same age she was on the 1860 census!  On the 1880 census she is still with Washington and he now has Mary and five other children though who he's having them with is a bit uncertain as neither the 1870 or 1880 census has a mother for the kids listed on it. Mahala is now from Georgia and has aged twenty years since the 1870 census...  I can't seem to find a death record for Mahala though which is rather annoying."

For instance if you know the name of his wife, you then search for births (approx. 20 years after their date of marriage) with the surname and mother's maiden name (ancestry lets you do this).  Then you have a list of his children.  The next step is to find these children's marriages.  Sometimes this is impossible to pinpoint but often unusual names or middle initials will let you find them definitively.  Then you start again as above with births for the surname and mother's maiden name.  For British records these go up to births in 2005.  Keep repeating this cycle till you get to the present day.  As for getting touch, if the name is unusual then you find them on facebook or 192.com.  I am happy to look this all up for you but won't have access to my laptop till later today.

The immigration years for Herman Sr and Anna in the 1910 census plus the birth years/ places of the children really raise some questions.   Especially since the immigration year for Anna clashes with the info from the 1905 state census:  https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:23BD-T16  I tried searching for an Anna Rohl/Röhl/Roehl from Germany at castle garden but got too many hits.   Going by the info in the 1905 state census the whole family must have immigrated in or around 1892.   Searching castlegarden I find a Herman and an Auguste Rohl who immigrated 02 Jul 1891 coming from Bremen on the ship München, their destination is Iowa. Curiously no trace of the older children who are supposedly born in Germany. I checked the passenger departure lists for Bremen, sadly the records for the ship München start in 1923.   That said, there is an Anna Rohl who travels from Antwerp to New York on the ship Westerland as an Infant, she arrives 29 Oct 1891.   I think it would be interesting to look up the original records ( I think they are on ancestry) and see who else is travelling with Herman and Auguste Rohl in June/July and in October with that Anna Rohl. If her parents left her behind, who brought her over to the USA?   Another lead would be to check whether there are any church books of Lutheran churches in Jasper county.   Finally I would take a closer look at the families whose members are interred in the Old German Lutheran Cemetery in Kellogg.   If the 1891 arrival I found is your family, they knew they were headed for Iowa. Chances are high they had friends or family members already in Iowa, people who helped them secure farmland.   Maybe this person can give you some pointers:   http://www.prairierootsresearch.com/jasper-county-kellogg-historical-museum/"

Genealogy,3akq04,genialgenealogy,2,Sun Jun 21 03:49:49 2015 UTC,"Regarding Siegfrieds baptism record, FamilySearch has non-indexed microfilms for several churches in Dortmund. It would really help if you knew whether he was lutheran or catholic because that would rule out some possibilities. I don't know whether FamilySearch has all churches, I doubt it, but it is a start.    I find it hard to believe that Sigfried came to the states alone, given how young was (about 15), but maybe I'm wrong.   I would not be surprised if he went alone.   At that time low-class and lower middle-class boys finished school at about 12, they were then sent into an apprenticeship that usually lasted for 3 years. So at 15 he would have just finished his apprenticeship and be expected to go on the ""walz"", ie start his journeyman years. That means a three-year period of wandering, seeing the world, working abroad and learning.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman_years  Those journeyman years could take somebody quite far away from home, if there are people from Austria popping up in Königsberg (today Kaliningrad) and people from Hamburg showing up in Swiss records they are usually former journeyman. Especially younger brothers often went off like this, often in search for the young widow or only daughter of a master so that they could take over the family business. :D  I am pretty sure that this is what happened to one of my ancestors, he married the young widow of an old master within a few weeks of the old master dying off and then took over the old master's business.    So a 15 year old in ""kluft"" (ie traditional journeyman garb) boarding a ship bound to the USA would not raise any eyebrows at all.   EDIT: After playing around with German genealogy sites a bit I think you might want to contact this woman for help/advice:  http://wiki-de.genealogy.net/Benutzer:Holtkamp  She has copied, transcribed and indexed several churchbooks of small villages that are part of Dortmund today.  2nd EDIT: Have a look at the adressbook for Dortmund in 1894.   http://adressbuecher.genealogy.net/addressbook/547474b21e6272f5d110329b  It has 12 entries for Gruenewald and one entry for Gruenwald.

Colors > Invert Colors > Desaturate > Luminosity File > Export As... (Select TIF or PNG) Open the new file with ImageJ - a free image analysis and computational program used by scientists. I mod /r/ImageJ, and have some background working with digital image processing. Image > Type > 8-bit (Just because of the edit to presumably black-out informtion, I do the next two steps... it helps the Subtract Background step.) i) check the histogram (CRTL+SHIFT+H) ii) based on that I use a simple macro command: changeValues(210,255,200); (Plugins > New > Macro... then paste that command and run with ""CTRL+R"") Process > Substract Background (set radius to 200) Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast (use ""Auto"" or manually adjust sliders to the desired appearance) File > Save As > PNG (Done!)   The image has an uneven background, hence why I edited it with ImageJ, otherwise, the Brightness/Contrast tool in GIMP could be used. If you're having trouble with an image, feel free to ask, and I can see what can be done... I have a few more advanced image processing tricks in the bag. But as others have stated, having a good quality image with no reflections, even lighting, etc...  to work from eliminates most of the complications.  I also did the other image in the same fashion: using a smaller radius (50) for the background subtraction helps with the reflection a bit, but it still reduces the available contrast."

The Melissa Vernon I found did marry a William ""Billy"" Lemons in 1875 and they had a son, Hardin Lemons, born 31 Nov 1876 and died in 1962. I sounds like you have some of your research as multiple people. Let me know if I can help you with anything else."

And beyond your parents, there is some variability, so you may actually have less than a quarter of a grandparent's DNA.  Because of this, there is a sharp dropoff in the likelihood you will match a cousin once the relation gets too distant.  I believe it's roughly 50/50 whether or not a fourth cousin will show as a match, and the odds plummet beyond that.  People might also be interested in the racial makeup of parents and grandparents, which could be different from your own.

Finally, you build family trees for your cousins to find out how they're related, and then you have one or two of your mom's ancestors.

If the death certificate mentions that he was institutionalized, then you could attempt to make a records request for him from that institution.

Genealogy,3a5m7t,MurphysLab,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:30:56 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of visiting Oudtshoorn, South Africa a few years ago. A century ago, the ostriches there were mainly farmed to provide ostrich feathers for hats:    Horse-drawn carriages made large, dramatic hats fashionable. Ostrich feathers are some of the most intricate and grandiose in the world so it only made sense to use them in this new rage. During this period of the late 19th and early 20th century, South African ostrich farmers made a fortune. However, the good times came to an end. Henry Ford began to mass-produce the automobile which made large stylish hats for women virtually obsolete. The onset of World War I put the final nail in the coffin of the ostrich feather industry. The same barons who were making a fortune soon found themselves on the verge of poverty. The future of the ostrich industry looked very grim indeed.   While there I was told that the big change in ~1913 was automobiles. In that year, the Ford Model T's price dropped to $525 (or $12,600 with inflation). That was equivalent to the average annual wage in 1913. And with the drop in price, production increased by 150% to 170,211.   The Smithsonian Magazine article from /u/SlimPikinZ seems to place the whole change on the Weeks-McLean Act, but the market in Europe for feathered hats seemed to end at the same time."

Also, the sleeves and fit of the bodice indicate something near the turn of the century, as in the previous decades, shoulders would have been more fitted and the sleeves would have been stiffer and more structured, as seen here and here.

He's using DNA data to find relatives, and then using those relatives' surnames to determine where your ancestors are from.

Anyway I'm not 100% sure I buy it...when I plugged my own surname in there, three possible counties came up, none of them the county where I'm actually from.

I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with making educated guesses based on DNA and historical sources, so long as I remember that's all it is.  As /r/robspeaks says, nothing with Y DNA is going to tell you anything about anything except the straight male line, so only your father's father would be relevant.

All things considered, though, I may still take him up on it, depending on what he tells me the cost would be.  I'm waiting to hear back.  It seems to me that what he's doing isn't a whole lot different than what the National Geographic did with their Genographic Project.  They did have to operate on the premise that there can be a valid connection between genetic markers and geographic location, given that historically most humans have died within 40 miles of the place they were born.  (That's the premise I remember reading at their website).  In this case he would be positing that Irish surname clusters would have stayed relatively unmoving throughout the centuries, and that may well be a reasonable premise.  Lacking ""paper"" documentation of my Irish ancestry, this approach might be the best  I could do.  It's more like historical guesswork using DNA facts than an actual DNA study.  But that might be good enough for me."
Genealogy,3a4x39,robspeaks,2,Wed Jun 17 19:40:38 2015 UTC,"It's good enough for a lot of people, which is why I'm sure he's making money.  People don't necessarily want a fact as much as they want something that scratches their itch.  As long as you are aware, there is nothing necessarily wrong with that.  But you should be aware.  The main issue is that your Y-DNA matches are based on your STR results, which is a string of numbers.  The general idea is that Y chromosomes are passed down from generation to generation and over time, small changes occur.  This allows us to distinguish different lineages.  You and your father would likely have the same results.  You and a fourth cousin would likely have one or two differences.  You and a 10th cousin would likely have a handful of differences.  You and someone who is not related will have a ton of differences.  Seems fairly straightforward and it's the reason FTDNA sorts your matches by the number of differences you have and cuts it off when the number starts to get high.  BUT, it isn't that straightforward.  Without getting too scientific, sometimes the numbers go up and sometimes the numbers go down.  That means that the numbers for separate lineages can actually come back together.  That alone puts the biggest of asterisks next to any analysis of your matches.  An example would be if a man had two sons, and one had a difference in his DNA.  But then in the next generation, the difference reverted to the original, or maybe the other line also developed the same difference.  Stretch that out over centuries.  There is a Y-DNA haplogroup called M222 that a significant percentage of Irish and Scottish men belong to, including myself.  M222 can be thought of as a man who lived about 2000 years ago and everyone in the group traces their direct paternal line back to him.  This group exploded in a relatively short period of time, which means there are many lineages out there today that show up as matches for each other when really there is no meaningful relation at all.  I know of one man who has literally thousands of DNA matches on FTDNA because of this phenomenon.  I would love to see Origenes analyze him.  STR results are still meaningful, but SNPs are a more reliable way of determining the relation of different lineages.  SNPs are a different animal though."

And aesthetically, I find the banner space (with person's name) across the top to be entirely wasted space that takes up far too much of my monitor.

The interface between FTM and the website seems a great deal better to me. I did experience and report the disappearing Save button on some Ancestry document pages. And I do not like how it cuts off part of the heads of my ancestors in the online tree. I did square the photos up nicely for the FTM tree so they really need to coordinate those two. When I paste pics into the box in my recipe software, it always fills the box, never cutting off the edges or the top. Ancestry should be the same way.  What I would really like is for improvement in the search algorithms. For instance, when I search for names beginning with GN, Ancestry typically returns names starting in KN. How goofy is that? My only choice, then, is to always use the Exact mode."

Change angle and lighting if that helps. I've done this a few times. Taking several photos is to be sure you have it.  If you have to take several photos to get the entire record you can stitch the images together using Microsoft ICE (image composite editor) or a similar app. Just be sure to keep the same angle and lighting.

I would recommend you look at www.wtg-gniazdo.org for further information on research in the Wielkopolski area.   The Polish state archives are slowly scanning and putting the churchbooks and civil bmd records in their possession online and the Genealogical Society of Greater Poland is indexing them using the site Basia. Sadly there are currently no records for Białykał or Lubin indexed on the site. That usually means that the state archive in question has not made records for this area available.   But the state archive in Poznan has tax records for Białykał (aka Weisskehle, that is the German name).    I would recommend you write to the state archive in Poznan and request they look your family up in those tax records.   http://www.poznan.ap.gov.pl/  EDIT: Also have the state archive look whether they already got the bmd records for Zieliniec before 1914/1915."

For Stephen's birth certificate you could write to   Urząd Stanu Cywilnego - Września ul. Fryderyka Chopina 9 62-300 Września Poland  http://www.wrzesnia.pl  Theoretically the birth certificates might also be already at the Poznan State Archive, births older than 100 years are supposed to be archived. But in practise the registrar's office tends to keep the books for a few years longer.   Since they are older than 100 years, the certificates are public record and you should be able to get the certificates for both siblings provided they were both born in Zieliniec."

Genealogy,39loht,loewinluo2,6,Sat Jun 13 06:23:21 2015 UTC,"I believe that the name of Fredericka's father on her death certificate is ""Ivo Vallier,"" and that it is incorrect. Ivo was actually the name of her brother.  Ivo Vallière from Baden was a physician in New York as early as 1860. His will, dated 24 Nov. 1873, mentions his ""beloved sister Fredericke Vallière,"" and appoints Otto Frass one of the executors. This marriage record shows that Ivo's wife was a Frass as well.  This appears to be Ivo's family in 1860. I suspect that you are correct that this is Fredericka in 1860, living with the Henry Vallière family. Henry Jr. was living with Ivo in 1870, and is mentioned in his will as ""my cousin.""  Also mentioned in the will is Ivo's sister Louise. A Louise Valliere, daughter of Anthony and Helena (Herr) Valliere, born about 1842 in Offenburg, married in Manhattan in 1876. I believe that Anton and Helena (Herr) Vallière were Ivo and Fredericka's parents as well, and that the birth records here refer to them. (Johann = Ivo, Anna Maria Friderika Valliere = Fredericka, Luise Sophie = Louise.)  This register from the University of Heidelberg shows an Ivo Vallière of the right age studying there in 1853. Under ""Geburtsort"" (place of birth) it says ""Zell b. Offenburg,"" and it says that his father was a surgeon in Zell. A record here confirms that Anton Valliere of Offenburg was granted a license as a second-class surgeon in 1823."

It all fits so perfectly, but it does bring up a few questions.  If Johann Vallier is the same person as Ivo, do you think it's safe to assume his full name was Johann Ivo or Johann Yves Vallier?    I think it has to be him because Otto Frass is a very unusual name, so for Otto and Fredericka Vallier to be listed as part of his will, that is the most convincing piece of evidence.  But it makes Otto and Fredericka's story that much more confusing.    Ivo was married to an Emma Frass, but although I have the Frass family reasonably well-documented, I don't have an Emma listed as a first or a middle name of any of Otto's sisters, although I suppose it could have been a cousin.  The families clearly knew each other for two marriages to have occurred between them.  I wonder if they knew each other before or after immigrating.  Why was Otto in Mississippi during the Civil War?  Why was their first daughter born in Alabama?  Perhaps the Otto Frass I have immigrating to New Orleans is not the correct Otto Frass, although I am fairly certain the one captured during the Civil War is correct because of his profession listed.

Ivo and Emma's marriage record supposedly calls her ""Anna Karoline Frass.""  It was the passenger record that /u/loewinluo2 found which allowed me to find Ivo and Emma, and to connect them to Fredericka.  Otto and Fredericka must have known each other from the old country, though it appears that they didn't marry until several years after their arrival. Given that their first child was born in Alabama, I think it's quite likely that Otto Frass of New Orleans is the same man. Maybe he went to the deep south for adventure or fortune, was caught there when the war broke out, and came back for Fredericka once the Confederacy had fallen?

All I knew was that Gregor and Carolina had a son named Otto Joseph August Frass in Baden-Baden.  Gregor and Otto were both shoemakers.  There was an Otto Frass (shoemaker) captured during the Civil War from Baden.  He married Fredericka, and referred to himself as ""Otto A. Frass"" in one directory.  I knew all of these things probably made him Gregor's son, but I didn't know until now when you sent me record of Anna Karoline's record.  And actually, Anna Karoline is a new sibling I did not have record of, so that's helpful too!  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you."

If you look a couple of pages later, you'll find two other dishonorable discharges at Fort Benjamin Harrison around the time of Raymond's discharge, with references to ""G.O. 4"" and ""G.O. 14."" There are also dishonorable discharges in Florida (G.O. 98), Cuba (G.O. 73 and G.O. 7), and New York (G.O. 39). Presumably these General Orders were the orders ""by which [these courts-martial were] constituted,"" i.e. the convening orders.  Edit: Upon further research, only the dishonorably discharged got the ""not h&f"" notation, so it probably indicates that their tenures in the Army didn't end honorably and that they failed to fulfill their contracts."

Since it's one of your eight great-grandparents' identity you have a question over you're either going to get very low-focus knowledge from a DNA test, a rough idea of where he was from and whether it fits with the rest of your expected heritage, or you're going to be looking for specific matches and cousin hunting. If you just want to know where he might have come from on a rough basis, do the test, look at the results and you'll have that info. If you're interested in getting a name for your grandfather's dad then you're going to need to go 'cousin hunting'. To increase your odds, put your results into 23andMe and FamilyDNA's databases so you can find matches in both. If you can, get your mother, one of her parents or siblings to do a test too so you can definitely say a match is maternal or paternal. And finally, don't forget you have lots of genes not just your Y chromosome and you could just as easily match a female descendent of your mystery great-grandfather as a male one, you really don't want to limit your odds by only reading one bit of your report!  Edited to add: Definitely worth doing. I confirmed both my maternal grandmother's parents via a 23andMe DNA test and finding cousins. I'm in the UK, the great grandparents were from Hong Kong/Macau and the cousins are in San Francisco. I've had a blast discovering that side of my family tree. :)"

It's up to you which parent is shown as the preferred on your profile and tree, but this way you'll have them both linked to you. Looks like this. (In my example, Annie is the non-preferred parent. On George's profile, she is not seen, but when I go to her profile, George is listed among her children). That's what I'd do."

The old Welsh tradition was to list your ancestry by generation paternally as your surname so you may find John ap Daffyd ap Gryffud ap Llewellyn etc. up until the 1500s.   From the middle ages there was a concerted effort on the part of the occupying English to bring Welsh names into line with their own and people started to drop their long patronymics, sticking with just one. It means that you have HUGE amounts of Jones for example, which is ""son of John"" basically, because these people all at the time their ancestor chose to switch to the English system of naming was the son of a John, rather than any kind of genetic familial link. The same with Davies for David etc.   Be aware in this sense that you will find a lot of people with the same names, who aren't related to you in the slightest and you need to be doubly sure of your research with supporting evidence.

Before computer software got so nice, I organized my files in a complex system that was very beneficial.  In my 'A' Files, I kept a folder for each family group (as in a couple and their children). The first page had the family group sheet. The title of the folder was Last Name, Father's Given (Father's Birthday), Mother's Given (Mother's Birthday). Inside was all of the census copies, the newspaper clippings, birth certificates, death certificates, etcetera. I also kept log files inside that had details on my sources, addresses, phone numbers, a to do list, etcetera. A child's records stayed in that folder until I found a marriage for him, then all of those files were moved to their own family group folder.  In my 'B' Files, I had various subject files. I had a file on every town that had a lot of family in it including the town's history, good sources, complete census records for the tiniest towns since one way or another I was related to just about all the people living there. I had a file for each secret society such as woodmen of the world. I had a file for each war with extra history and a list of my family found participating in them. Stuff like that.  In my 'source' files I had printed family histories from other genealogists. Original stuff that couldn't go into one family group file.  I had interview notes and research trip notes as well there.  In my 'Aids' files I had maps. One of those big trail maps that showed how most people migrated across the US and what dates each new town sprung up and linking them to the towns the founders came from. That was invaluable. All my genealogy reference books were kept there, too.  These days, I've gotten rid of all that junk. I keep just a few things organized by subject only. I have a file full of original birth, marriage, and death certificates (all scanned and attached to the appropriate computer files), original newspapers, boxes of original photographs that I plan to one day scan and cull down to the best pieces only, and the original family histories and biographies.

If you check YouTube, blogs, and webinars, you will find people telling you how they organize their genealogy documents. You just need to pick one, or figure out your own method, and go with it. No one way is right, which is why there are so many people teaching it. The trick is to be consistent with whatever you choose to do.  And now is a good time to do that, while you have 400 people. The more people and records you get, the longer it takes to reorganize everything.  Many people try to go completely digital. Some will toss all papers, but many will keep things they paid for, like certified copies. Digital copies can be backed up in multiple places, so even if something happens to the originals, you still have all the scans. Most of the records I have are scanned from microfilm, so a paper copy holds no special value over a digital copy."

Genealogy,396w1a,DanishWonder,2,Fri Jun 12 04:40:08 2015 UTC,"Just depends on your goals.  My dad's family and my father in law's family have lived in the same town for over 300 years.  They even immigrated roughly at the same time.  So I wanted to know if my wife and I were related (we are not, at least after 1700, and we share no DNA).   So that was one major reason I wanted to include my distant cousins.   But as I researched, I thought it was cool connecting with distant cousins and sharing stories, so I decided to start including them.  Many times, these distant cousins have given me photos and stories I would not have had otherwise."

Right now I have about 850 people in my tree, but it will probably get smaller before it gets any bigger.

But it seems that letters are addressed to my great-grandmother, Maria Nizowitz. Sender name is Mary Bych (other letter says Nizowitz). As you can see, the sender had the same second name as my great-grandmother (until changed later).

Genealogy,396p2k,phronimost,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:19:40 2015 UTC,"These photos, letters and postcards are all messed up, but I will try to organize them in chronological sequence.  1. 1936. It's a separate photo, picturing a man in his 40-60-ies. Ink handwriting on the backside: ""Jon Nizovetz"".  2. 1944. Three photos:  a) A photo picturing the same man as on the 1936 photo (if the data from that first photo is correct, it's Jon Nizovetz) with three girls named Olga, Elena and Rosa (possibly in their 20-ies). Ink handwriting in the back is in Russian, Jon Nizovetz is describing who is pictured on the photo.  b) Jon Nizovetz's son Philipp (possibly in his 30-40-ies), a military officer. It's all said on the back of the photo. And also there is a writing in different ink color: ""1944"" - that's where from I get the year they took the pictures. Ink handwriting on the backside is also in Russian.  c) Philipp, two small girls (5 or less y.o. by the look, one of them named Varvara or Barbara) and Jon Nizovetz's brother-in-law. There is a name mentioned - Stephan (or Steven), I think it's the name of Jon Nizovetz's brother-in-law. I suppose, one of the girls is Jon's granddaughter and one is Stephan's granddaughter. Ink handwriting is in Russian again, but barely readable.  3. 1963/1964. Separate photo, picturing two women (in their 40-ies), a man (in his 40-50-ies), a boy (looks like he's 12-14) and an old woman (in her 60-70-ies). Ink handwriting on the back says that two women are Olga and Ruzia (photo is small, but these women look like Olga and Rosa from the photo 2-a), man is Olga's husband Jan, the boy is Ruzia's (Rosa's) son and the old woman is Mary Nizowitz (Bych), signing the photo herself (she wrote ""and this is me myself"", not mentioning her name. Ink handwriting is in Polish this time, it says ""October, 1, 1963"" on the back and ""JAN 64"" printed on the front. At last a hint of an address: ""Philadelphia. U.S.A."" (and that's all that is written).  4. 1968. A postcard, signed on Dec 25 1968 by the same handwriting as Mary Nizowitz (Bych) has, but is not signed by any name (I think, all these photos and postcards came in envelopes, which are lost) Address line says: ""Brooklyn N.Y. U.S.A."". Ballpen handwriting is in Polish.  5. 1971. Just an empty envelope. At last, a full address. Also, Brooklyn, NY. I'm sending you the details in PM.  Also there is a postcard with no date written and a piece of paper with an address of Mary Bych. Both have the full address and both addresses are different between each other and the address on the envelope of 1971. Both are Brooklyn, NY, though. Handwriting is ballpen. Postcard is in Polish. The address on the postcard says ""Mary Nizowitz"". So I can't really tell, when she changed the last name. 1971 envelope says ""Mary Bych""."

The Es are pretty consistent in the document. But it is the first few letters that throw me for a loop. The Ds in the document are moderately loopy much like the second (or maybe third to last) letter in her name but if it is a D then there is an additional tail that could be an R.

Genealogy,394jhu,SmithFamilyKeeper,8,Tue Jun 9 05:17:39 2015 UTC,"Angelo's World War II Draft Registration Card does say that his wife was Anastasia, and that he was born 20 Aug. 1889 in Naples. I believe that this is his World War I card, which says that he was born 20 Aug. 1891 in Cessa, Italy (i.e. Cesa, just outside of Naples). In both 1917 and 1942 he was working for the DL & W Railroad.  The 1940 census gives his wife's name as Anastasia, the 1930 census as Elizabeth. The obituary of daughter Viola, born 1925, confirms that her mother's name was Anastasia.  I believe that this is Angelo in 1920, living with his parents Thomas and Concetta, and that this is the Togno family in 1915. His parents are buried here.  The 1920 census says that Angelo and his father came over in 1906, and that his mother and brother came over in 1908. Here is Angelo Togno, born in Cesa, arriving at Ellis Island in 1907 with his father Tomaso. They were headed to Netcong, New Jersey to join Tomaso's brother Guiseppe. Italian women often traveled under their maiden names, and here is Concetta Verde arriving with children Teresa and Angelantonio (a.k.a. Frank) Togno in 1909. They were going to join husband and father Tommaso in Netcong.  (This Angelo Togno should not be confused with the Angelo A. Togno who was born in 1898 and died in 1978. That Angelo was a son of Joseph Togno, and was apparently a cousin of your Angelo.)  I found a deed in Morris County records (book 2458, page 580) where Angelo and Anastasia's children sold land  in Netcong, ""Being the same premises granted to the Grantors herein under the Last Will and Testament of Anastastia C. Togno who died on March 17, 1975 and said Last Will and Testament was probated in the Surrogate's Court, Morris County, on March 30, 1976."" Another deed from 1983 (book 2690, page 420) refers to land of ""Angelo Togna and Nastasia Ciaraffa Tonga,"" and says that Angelo died 13 Nov. 1966."

Genealogy,394jhu,maryfamilyresearch,2,Wed Jun 10 01:51:19 2015 UTC,"I've got some experience with Caserta records - I have ancestors in the area... took me a while to figure out how it works... but basically, in southern Italy:   From about 1865 on, each comune (town) has record books that keep civil b/m/d information. The books for each year have the records in chronological order.   Records after ~1875 use a very similar format - fill in the blanks - you don't need to know too much Italian to pull dates and names.  Sure, it helps.  But if you learn months and numbers, you're most of the way there. Before 1875, many records were freehand.  They can actually contain more info, but Italian really does help there. Familysearch and ancestry.com have them organized in general as birth records, marriage records, then death records (atti di nascita, matrimonio, morte) for each year.   Many books have an index at the end that cross-references back across the year, so you don't necessarily  have to search through 100+ records in a comune... not to say I haven't done it. Ancestry organizes the records a bit better... but Familysearch is free.   Poke around - you'll get the hang of it.  If I were you, I'd be looking at indices of the expected years of birth of Angelo's siblings.  And, since Angelo appears to be firstborn, I would look at the marriages from 1887-9... they probably wouldn't be married very long without having kids.  Edit:  Yes, they got married in 1889, 38 weeks before the first child was born.  Here's the marriage index for 1889, which points to record #17 for Thomas Togno and Concetta Verde.  Summary: on 28 Nov 1889, at 5:55PM, in front of me, Dominico DeMichaela, official of the state, appeared 1) Tommaso Togno, age 26, farmer, born and resident of Cesa, son of Angelo and of Theresa Terriero (Ferriero?), resident of this town; and 2) Concetta Verde, age 23, farmer, born and resident of Cesa, daughter of the deceased Gennaro who in life resided in Cesa, and of Cesaria Esposito, resident of this town... yada yada witnesses yada yada publication of marriage banns, yada yada signatures of witnesses, but the bride and groom aren't signing because they're illiterate.

The parents were married in 1880. I can't find the record online. A Karol Daliga was married in 1860 to Katarzyna Bystrzak - could be the same person. Note also the marriage in 1892 of Jan Daliga (son of Karol and Katarzyna). There is a link to the scan of this marriage. Many of Karol's and Jan's children can be found on the site."

I'm still taking a look around.  Edit:  [Here is an article about her...]( It won't upload!) She is in Texas in 1921- a graduate of the Lamar School.  They throw her a ""Dancing party"".  This is a ""good family"" as my mom would say.  My guess is she got pregnant and was shipped off to a relatives house. I know a bit about ""good Jewish families"" in the 1930's.  It may have gone like this or not.    Most marriages were arranged by the parents.  In the 20/30's sister was going to college. This means they were expected to make VERY good matches.   Marrying doctors and lawyers.   Ruth, no doubt, would be a BIG disappointment if she got pregnant.    A match would be made with some Jewish guy that was not local.  My guess is that's Barney.  EDIT: So I think Sandra Correne Bernard Simon was ""Sandra"" - Barney and Ruth's daughter.  Her mother, Ruth Hyman Bernard (according to family tree),  died in California in 1999.

Genealogy,3922ff,ACEaton1483,2,Mon Jun 8 18:10:37 2015 UTC,"If you look at the Ellis Island website, and type in the family name of Pisacreta (no first name), you’ll see there quite a number of Pisacreta’s, and a few from the Santa Lucia di Serino area, in roughly the same time period that Maria Luisa emigrated. Keep in mind spelling variations and abbreviations for the town/area. Passenger manifests are available to review (some are harder to read than others), along with the “Passenger Record” (look at tabs at the top of the page).   For example, in 1912 there is a Ma Fiorino Pisacreta, from L. Lucia S. Lerino, Avellino, age 57, female, on the ship: Berlin. I would suggest a review of the Pisacreta names, and note those who may be siblings/cousins/family of Maria Luisa’s – it’s a place to start.   This website, Imagines Maiorum, contains information on the Alvig(g)i family, including the marriage date of Sabino and Maria Luisa Pisacreta. (Listed in Generation V): Sabino Alviggi, son of Michele Alviggi and Gaetana d’Aure(i)a, married Maria Luisa Pisacreta 10 Jan 1901, Santa Lucia di Serino. The site is pretty interesting, and includes contact information for the site owner – it may be worth contacting him to try and get more info, and perhaps ask him to do some lookups.  And here’s a site, The Italian Side, which looks to have some information regarding the Avellino area, and some genealogical search tips regarding Italian civil and parish records."

Genealogy,390l5j,Moolemon,4,Mon Jun 8 11:06:04 2015 UTC,"My great-great grandmother, who lived in Dublin, taught at the art school and we knew her husband, Bernard, had run off at some point (old family story) and when he came back she wouldn't let him in the house. An amazing redditor on here this week did some researching for me as he has access to The Irish Times.   We found out that Dora, my g-g-grandmother, had started learning at her art school through a first prize art entry in a competition. She won about 6 or 7 awards that made the paper in total. Then she married Bernard, had 8 children, still winning art awards, and then all we knew before this research was that he had run off and she hadn't let him in the house when he returned. This week I found out the reason why, maybe!  Her husband Bernard got into debt with a loans company/the Catholic loan sharks (""St. Theresa's Loans Co!""), and when he borrowed money from this company, he forged his wife's signature. They started suing him and her for their money back when he was late paying it back and they had to go to court. This poor lady had to contest that her own husband forged her signature, and she eventually won and was let off.  After that, there are no more newspaper articles about her winning awards, and she died ~5 years later, of cancer. There is a newspaper obituary about her in the paper that says the loveliest things about her and she seems like she was such a nice lady.  I've been able to send all this information to my auntie, who started compiling a blog about Dora around 5 years ago. Here is the blog, if anyone is interested!  It's been an exciting week! :-)"

Genealogy,38ws8d,drumma1316,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:33:28 2015 UTC,"I just returned from a trip to Norway to meet 40+ relatives. Here's some tips that I hope might be helpful from how I contacted them:   I had an address from another relative who corresponded with them 15 years ago. I had no idea whether this address was still valid or if the relative who lived there was still alive but my experience was that someone somewhere in my family had some sort of contact info which gave me a place to start. This may be the hard part in your situation but I would put money on someone in the family knows where these girls are or how to get a hold of them. The hard part is figuring out who knows what. I talked to a lot of family members before I got any leads on contact info. I wrote an old-fashioned letter explaining why I was interested in meeting these relatives in Norway. I included email, phone, and address contact info for myself so if they received my letter, it would be easy to contact me quickly. Sending snail mail seemed the best way to go here because the post office often knows where people have moved to if the address you have is old. Once my relatives received my letter, they were able to contact me and put me in touch with 40+ others so the book just kinda flew wide open once I got one person. If they get to meet their sisters, they should bring info about themselves and their family as well as photos as the sisters will probably be interested to learn about this other family they may not have known about.   Hope that helps!"

I've researched German Quakers, Irish immigrants in Baltimore, colonial Marylanders, even a Wallon ancestor but these damn mountain folk are the most complicated branch of my entire family tree.  The upside is that a relative of the co-worker had done genealogy work for their branch. I have over 50 pages of family history but since it has very little evidence attached (I have a history degree and I'm a stickler for documentation in my research) so I can only use it to find the connection.

No biggy.  a couple days later, my mind starts going over it and over it, what would be the likely hood that his family has a surname in my tree?  So I fire her an email, and ask what part of his family is from newfoundland (I assumed wrongly, that it was his Dad's family... It was infact his mom's family. Her maiden name, and my mom's maiden name were the exact same. Of course it was a very common name, especially for Newfoundland.  So I asked for more details from her, and got a few more tidbits about great grand parents. Which helped a lot, It took me a few hours to make the connection. I was amazed, I was her husband's 5th cousin. Neither of us were born near Newfoundland.  It took a couple days more for it to dawn on me, that our kids and her kids are now 6th cousins.

I will remain optimistic, however, because the only articles I've seen declaring every European of European descent a relation of Charlemagne are based on mathematics. And to be completely honest, I don't think any of their calculations took into consideration exactly how rampant inbreeding was. (I expected rampant inbreeding and still didn't expect it to the extent that I'm finding it.)  So I admit it is perfectly plausible - and even rather probable - that you're correct. But until it's proven one way or another, I intend to continue on. Call me crazy, I guess.

Genealogy,38pw0s,gregbard,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:03:48 2015 UTC,"Mathematics is a pretty exact science. A family in Europe would have to live as hermits for generations to avoid being a descendant of Charlemagne.   If you compare the number of unique ancestors a person theoretically has, with the actual historical number (this is called ""implex""), you will discover that the inbreeding is far more than you probably already suspect.  If a contemporary living person traces back to just the year 1000, that is an estimated 40 generations. 2 to the power of 40 is just over a trillion. The total world population in the year 1000 was only between 250 million, and 350 million. That's 2800 to 4000 times as many ancestors one ideally has if they were unique, as compared with the actual number of historical ancestors, many of whom married 2nd, 3rd, and 4th cousins without even knowing it.  A complete file of Charlemagne's descendants has at least a billion people, for sure. You might as well turn the project over to the Mormans, who have a whole religion's worth of people working on it, and no where near compete."

It has a great search function, is very well organized, and makes it possible to easily include quite a bit of information on a person. The best part, in my opinion, is that it's compatible with basically every program/website that uses the basic GEDCOM genealogy structure, which most do.  I will have to switch eventually to something that I'll have to get back to you on, because I can't for the life of me remember what it's called. This is because when using Gramps, the database/file is stored on the actual computer. I estimate, by the way the program is beginning to slow a tiny bit in loading the file, that I can add at most another 3,000 people before it becomes so slow it's almost unusable. The program my husband found for me to switch to keeps the database/file online (locally), making it possible to add as many people as I need to without rendering it unusable.

Genealogy,38lkrj,arachnae,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:37:39 2015 UTC,"I made this same post on The Straight Dope, but I thought you guys would be interested as well. The links aren't available, but you get the picture.  ""Okey dokey, I think I've cracked the mystery.  Zamloch is an Americanized version of the Czech surname Zemlicka.   How did I come to this conclusion?  Carl Zamloch is the son of Anton Zamloch. Anton Zamloch is list as from Austria. A google search of '""Anton Zamloch"" born' on Google returns a result for ""Anton Zemilewski."" At first, I thought Zemilewski might have been his real surname, so I clicked the link.  On that same page, I found a link for an ""Arthur Zamlocke"" in the 1920 United States Federal Census, with the name ""Anton Zemlicka"" listed below that. ""Anton"" matched the name perfectly and ""Zamlocke"" was close enough. Plus, the birthday was about right, so I was intrigued. I searched for ""Carl Zamlocke"" on the off-chance he was listed under that surname, too.  And lo and behold, he was. His 1920 Census entry lists him as ""Carl Zamlocke,"" with a father named Anton, a mother named Elizabeth and a sister named Nettie. But how could I be certain this was the right family -- the Zamlochs (and therefore the Zemlickas) -- and not just another family whose surname really was Zamlocke originally, whose dad and son shared the same name as the Anton and Carl I was looking for?  Well, this proved it for me. Listed is a death notice for Anton Zamloch, aka Zamloch the Great, who is survived by ""Carl Zamloch, manager of the Oakland ball club"" and ""daughter Nettie Zamloch"". Plus, this link biography lists his wife as being named Elizabeth, so that is further proof that I have the right family.  So, I conclude Zamloch == Zemlicka. Further, I theorize Anton Zamloch (sometimes spelled ""Zamlock"") was the magician's stage name, while Anton/Arthur Zamlocke was his Americanized public name.  Zemlicka, by the way, ""is a metonymic occupational name for a baker, from žemlicka, diminutive of žemle ‘bread roll’"". ...  An addition:  Perhaps Zamloch is a Germanized version of Zemlicka, and Zamlocke is the Americanized version of Zamloch.""  http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showpost.php?p=18519988&postcount=5"

The majority of European records is neither online, nor indexed, nevermind searchable. So even if they are online or available through familysearch it often means slugging through a lot of records in the hope of spotting a certain last name, looking at the scanned or filmed images of the original record. If you need to do this for every village in say, Prussia, you could spend a lifetime searching for the birth record of your ancestor.   So it is very important to find some sort of document in the USA that states the exact place of birth. Ancestry can be a good resource for this.

Genealogy,38g00k,ppden,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:36:20 2015 UTC,"Nelson is not a first name, so either he was a Niels, or he had two surnames ""Nielsen Knudsen"" - a custom common in that area. Niels is very Danish - Nicolaus is the German equivalent. Knudsen is the Danish version of the surname, Knutzen is the German variant. The actual spelling is likely to be dependent on the writer's preferred language.  Even though the area was previously Danish, German was frequently used.  The emigration records may have something, use wildcards - I get 99 hits for ""Knu%, Ni"". You'll need to compare destinations and ages with your ancestor. But it probably does not include German citizens.   I think familysearch has ship lists from Hamburg and Bremen - that could also be an option."

Genealogy,38cppv,Murklins11,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:03:11 2015 UTC,"My great-grandfather has two potential mothers and I'm not sure how to prove which one is his real mom.  His father was married in Canada, had two daughters and a son. One daughter died within a year. His wife died in January 1912. In December 1912, he is in Illinois and remarrying and just barely not having a baby out of wedlock. Records he himself would have filled out indicate he believed his father's second wife was his mother, but I'm not sure.   What makes sense to me is that my great-grandfather was the son of the Canadian wife, but if that's so, what happened to his other sister? And why was his step mom so sure he was four years younger than the Canadian birth record I found states? (In the 1920 census, he should have been 15 if I'm right, but he's listed as 11... same in 1930, he's 21 instead of 25). Shouldn't there be some record of a 7 year old immigrating with his father? Aaah. The other option is that the immigration record is wrong and the 1920 census is right (ha), he actually immigrated in 1907 instead of 1912, had a first son out of wedlock in 1908/1909 and then gave him the same name as his Canadian son who is either dead or abandoned.

Genealogy,38azbp,mg85,6,Wed Jun 3 01:15:24 2015 UTC,"Hey, no questions are dumb.  Many people are still learning how to interpret DNA.  The first answer is really that there is no timeline.  Here is basically how the ethnicity reports work:  A group of scientists or anthropologists collect DNA from native people in different regions.  They become the reference population.  These are people who have supposedly been in that local area for 500 year, 1000 years...who knows.  There is no rule, but their DNA is supposed to be more ""in tact"" than the rest of us who have moved around and had children with people of other ethnicities.  So then the testing services compare your DNA to these reference populations.  If you match one of the sets to a certain amount, you have X% of that ethnicity.  But it's really kind of a guess and it's totally dependent on the reference populations (which are really basically random, however the original scientists wanted to define them).  There are many different admixture and ethnicity tests, they are all slightly different.  For your second question: You could infer that it came from your father, but you would really have to test him to confirm.  DNA can do weird things.  Sometimes a DNA base pair is not determined in the test and results in a ""no call"" which is a blank space.  Put a few of those in the right spot and the ethnicity report might give a different answer.  It's unlikely, but there are small things like this that make the difference between ""certainty"" and ""probably""."
Genealogy,38azbp,DanishWonder,3,Wed Jun 3 02:26:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of this.  The results merely compare you to reference populations, and specifically populations that exist today.  That makes certain categories tricky given the history of various regions and the changing borders and ethnic makeup of countries.  Keep in mind that your average European will not test as 100 percent anything.  It's not an exact science.  My grandmother was born in the west of Ireland and I haven't found a trace of anything other than Irish in her tree, but she has traces of Scandinavian in her results.  It's easy for me then to brush off the Scandinavian in my own results as either noise or Vikings or something.  But if I had a more mixed family tree and hadn't been able to test other members of my family, things like that could be misleading.  So many people come away wondering where the mystery category in their results comes from, wondering if someone was adopted or something.  Maybe they were, but it's not that simple.  Just because someone comes up with ""German"" DNA, for example, doesn't mean they have immigrant ancestors from Germany.  I'd be interested to see how your average Swiss citizen would come out.  I also agree with the second part.  Less than one percent of anything should be considered suspect."

Genealogy,38985b,arc4angel100,6,Tue Jun 2 18:50:08 2015 UTC,"Okay, just to clarify what happened with the records for adopted children in that period, in 1949 Parliament had effectively dropped 'an iron curtain' between the birth mother and the adopting family. The mother would have no knowledge of where the child went and the child's birth certificate was amended: the long version that you have to order from the GRO would have the original details of the biological mother on it but the 'short certificate' was re-issued with the adopted parents' details on it to camouflage the adoption from everyone else. So it may be that your dad's half sister never knew she was adopted, there wasn't really any reason to order the long form birth certificate unless you were told you were adopted since the short form is standard and used for applying for a passport, driving license etc. The situation changed in the 1970s but whether she knew of/looked for her birth mother really does depend on what the adoptive parents told her about her origins because between 1949-1975 it was all about the child getting a 'fresh start' and burying the secret.

Genealogy,383wr6,ACEaton1483,4,Mon Jun 1 18:31:40 2015 UTC,"It's this kind of thing that keeps me interested in this topic of family history. We are connected to our past. I love finding similarities between myself or close relatives and ancestors.   Recently, I've started to ponder starting a farm as a lifestyle for my future family. I brought this up to my mom and she said, ""Well, most of our ancestors were farmers all their lives. We should have it in us to be able to do that!""   Obviously it takes more than DNA passed down through generations to be a good farmer, but I think it's worth exploring. I think about it often and it makes me want to know everything about the people in my tree to see what else we have in common."
Genealogy,383wr6,Littlefeat8,5,Mon Jun 1 19:00:21 2015 UTC,"Recently, I've started to ponder starting a farm as a lifestyle for my future family. I brought this up to my mom and she said, ""Well, most of our ancestors were farmers all their lives. We should have it in us to be able to do that!""   I often wonder about that. I have a white-collar job, but I enjoy tinkering with things and my hobbies all involve technical processes: film photography, cycling, etc.   Going back up my family tree, I wonder if there's a connection to be made. My dad's skilled labor, he's been an elevator mechanic for almost 35 years. His father was a machinist at Jones and Laughlin steel mill near Pittsburgh before joining the Navy, where he was a signalman and quartermaster (responsible for the ship's navigation and communications equipment). His father was a machinist in a steel mill. His father-in-law, also a machinist and general handyman. All of my dad's cousins had jobs as machinists at steel mills or other heavy industry, or were enlisted in the Navy in mechanical roles.   You have to go back 5 or 6 generations to find farmers or general laborers instead of machinists or mechanics. And even after my grandfather brought his family to Virginia in the early '60s, my dad and uncle found jobs in mechanical fields; my dad's an elevator mechanic and my uncle worked in the shipyards. It's only in my generation that you see people go to college and work in traditionally white-collar fields.   I really do wonder how much of that is environmental (you live in Pittsburgh and you're of a certain social class, you're going to be working with your hands) and how much of it is innate interest and talent."
Genealogy,383wr6,tagehring,2,Mon Jun 1 20:48:08 2015 UTC,"Interesting thoughts. I think environment plays a part for sure. If you live in a coal mining town, your dad, grandad, and everyone else you know is a coal miner, it will probably take little effort to go into the coal mining industry.   Then there's the classic story of the one who breaks the mold. They go off and do something totally different with different reaction results from their family.   I feel lucky to be from a wide range of talented people. My lineage includes a carpenter, artists, farmers of course, a fireman, stone masons, textile people, etc. I feel I should at least look into these industries of my family's past. I have found that I usually end up with great interest in the occupations or hobbies of my ancestors. I think there may be a reason for that.   Hopefully, I will be able to pass on my passion for family history to my children. If for nothing else, to give them inspiration for what could lie in their futures.   Also, I think these days are maybe less desperate times. Kids have so many options as far as career paths go. If there isn't a long standing tradition of a family business to go into by default, it really is wide open for them."

It is not Russian, my best guess is that it is either Ruthenian, Belorussian or Ukrainian, most likely Ukrainian. You want somebody who has Ukrainian as native language to decipher that.   The rest of the document including the writing is German with German kurrent script.   For the record, it is not a passport for travelling, but a military document functioning as ID and recording everything related to his service.  First picture:   Inft. Reg. No. 66 14th Kompagnie 1902 (year he was drafted) 266 (no clue what that is, you need talk to a expert on the Austrian military before WWI)  Second picuture:  He was a ""Gefreiter"" in the K.u.K. Infanterieregiment  Ferdinand IV. Ch. von Toscana Nr. 66 14th Feld-Compagnie  At the time he was drafted, he lived in Remete, Tersö, Maramaros, Hungary.   Page 4: He was born in Remete, Tersö, Maramaros, Hungary in 1881. His occupation is ""Landmann"", ie farmer. No distinguishing marks. Speaks and writes Ruthenian and Hungarian. Is 171 cms tall and needs shoes size 11.   page 5: his phyisical examination for the draft was on 1st April 1902.He has to do 3 years regular service, then 7 years in Reserve and 2 years as ""Landwehr"", so 12 years total.   He finished his regular service on 31st Dec 1905.   Cannot quite read the second to last box, it is supposed to state what kind of (professional) training he got. The writing is hard to read, but the last words translate to ""well trained"".   Last box with the big slash means he did not serve in any wars or battles.   Page 6 no medals, nothing really remarkable, signature and date of the commander of his regiment  He had a medical examination on his last day in regular service (Dec 23rd 1905) and the doctor gave him a clean bill of health.   Page 7: (notes on service) The time between Oct 1st 1905 to Dec 1905 is counted as first service in the reserve.   Page 8: some writing in Hungarian with dates after his release, I think he went to those places with the stamps and registered as stranger there, getting a stamp in his military passport just like a civilian would.   Page 9 - difficult to read, cannot decipher the military lingo, I think it is a statement that he does not have to attend military reserve service in March 1906 because of his service between Oct 1905 to Dec 1905. (see page 7 above)  Page 10 - here is registering his stay in the USA at the Austrian consulate in Pittsburgh, as a soldier who is technically part of the Landwehr and could be drafted again he has to notify the Austrian government of his location.

Genealogy,382fzq,JacksonGuitarguy,3,Mon Jun 1 11:06:04 2015 UTC,"I just signed back up with ancestry and have been digging in, so this a great place.  Here goes, my 8th Great-Grandfather, Storm Van Der Zee.  The logs of the ship: The Arms of Rensselaerwyck. Sailing on its voyage from Amsterdam to New Netherland and return, 25-Sep-1636 to 7-Nov-1637. Sunday, 2-Nov-1636, High seas and severe storms pounded the vessel, and noted by Skipper Jan Tiepkesz Schellinger, and we read: ""this day a child was born on the ship, and named and baptized in England stoerm; the mother is annetie baernts."" Logged November 2, 1636  at  lattitude 41 degrees 50 minutes on the Arms of Rensslaerswyck.  His family settled at Normanskill near Beverwyck, and he engaged in trading lumber, furs and tobacco.  In 1656, Storm was delivering planks to Manhattan.   By 1658 he was in business for himself, or as a partner of his father, as can be inferred from the fact that he was taking debtors to court, and was in turn sued by an employee for wages.  The records of one of his Manhattan business deals survives: he purchased 486 lbs of tobacco from Allard Anthony, but for more than eight months neglected to pay the price of 243 boards.   Finally, Anthony had him arrested and imprisoned, which was inspiration enough: Storm mortgaged a warehouse and lot in New Amsterdam to pay the debt. Although the warehouse is called Storm's in the court record, the description of its location shows it to have been his father's, strengthening the impression that they had a partnership.  In 1661, Storm was convicted of smuggling and his merchandise was confiscated. He should've known to drop his cargo at the first sign of an Imperial Cruiser.  Storm had several business dealings with his brother-in-law Roeloff Swartwout. In 1662 Roeloff paid a creditor with wheat of Storm's, repaying Sotrm with a lot in Beverwyck. Roeloff settled another debt by selling his wife's inheritance to Storm, who used her share and his own in paying for merchandise imported from Amsterdam.  Storm kept a tavern for years, a combination bar/eating place which was used for social and even business activities.  On 24-Feb-1679, Storm and Hilletie van der Zee filed a joint will, and Storm was sick. Besides the usual financial provisions, there was a statement that the survivor should see that the children were taught reading, writing, and an honorable handicraft. By 6-May Storm was dead, for on that date Harme Rutgers sought a replacement for him as coadministrator of Hendrick WILLEMSEN's estate.  And that's only one small piece of what I've learned of my family. Apparently my roots to the USA go back to the earliest settlers in nearly all my primary family lines. And I'm working on tracing Storm back and it looks like I may have gotten as far as Norway in the 1500's."

About 10 miles down the road in another town in the same county a lives Augusta 13 whose been a resident since as early as age 7     That next year about 5 months into the war Fred joins the Volunteer NY Infantry.  He serves honorably until the company is mustered out 2 years later at in South Central New York.     Just one month later in the same NW NY county the veteran soldier re-enlists in the NY Volunteer Calvary.  He serves 2 more years until the surviving company is mustered out in Virginia two months after the war ends in 1865.     After the war Fred travels back to NW NY  where he takes up Farming again. But was his motive finding work or for the love of a lady?        About a year after the war Augusta and Fred have married and assumed a mortgage on a deed from the Burns family.   A year later the couple has a son Lewis and 2 years later comes another son and brother Earnest my grandfather.     In 1869 Augusta and Fred sell the deed back to the original Mortgage owner Mr Newton.  The family continue to reside for another year in the same county and Fred continues his trade as Farm Labour.     Heresay is later in 1870 the couple moved to Port Huron to pursue work in the Timber industry.  Where Fred goes to work in the forest one day and never returns.  There was a Great Fire in that area of Michigan in 1871.     Six years later in 1876 Augusta and the boys are living in Dwight and she has re-married and had another son to her new husband.  Augusta and her 2nd husband continue to live out their lives residing in Dwight where nearly 60 years later they are laid to rest.     Fred however it seems is not dead as Augusta claimed, he is living in Hastings another timber town 3.5 hours west of Dwight.  Where he also has remarried and now has two daughters to his second wife Amanda, who sadly dies a few years later at only 25 from consumption.     An hour and a half north west and 10-12 years later with both duaghters Fred has traveled to Muskegon and married his third wife Malinda. His daughters are each married off at age 16.. Fred and Malinda live together in Muskegon until her death and he then resides with his youngest daughter until his death a year or two after..  ::Story assembled from civil war records, census records, land records, mairraige registers, birth & death returns and death certificates::  Thank you :)"

Genealogy,37ynni,LVenemy,2,Sun May 31 14:47:56 2015 UTC,"Because you put FREE in all capital letters, I'll tell you how to do genealogy research on the cheap: CHECK YOUR PUBLIC LIBRARY!  Many public libraries have access to Ancestry.com and other databases which have everything you need.  As for free sites you can access from home, far and away the best free genealogy resource is https://familysearch.org/.  There are also the LDS Family History Centers, where you can also access Ancestry.com, Fold3, etc, for free.  And plus, when you have exhausted the digitized resources on FamilySearch, you can order a microfilm from that site for a small fee and view it at one of these Family History Centers.  Also, Google around for NYC-specific free databases, as well as databases for your county in Mississippi.  Now, for research tips.  When starting out with ancestry research in the US, I would start with the 1940 census.  The US census was taken in every year that is a multiple of 10 (though 1890 was lost in a fire), and 1940 is the most recent one that is publicly available.  So, let's say your grandparents were alive in 1940.  Were they living in New York City or in Mississippi?  If they were born in Mississippi but moved to New York by 1940 they shouldn't be too hard to find because the state or country of birth is listed on the census...not that many New Yorkers from Mississippi!    If they lived in Mississippi in 1940, start searching for them in the county where they lived.  If you don't know the county, it might be tricky to track them down.  What I would do is search for them along with their siblings:  it's hard to search for John Buckley, for example, but if you're looking for John Buckley AND Peter Buckley AND Robert Buckley AND Mary Buckley in the same household it narrows the field considerably.  This is particularly true if a sibling has a very unique first name.  (There's a Zilpah in my family tree who has made things easy for me.)  But be aware that their names could be misspelled, they could have nicknames, they could go by their middle names, one child could be out of the house for whatever reason, etc.    That should get you started.  When you find them in 1940, just keep going back until you can't go back any further.  That way you have a solid basis of each branch of the family tree: who they were, where they lived, and (roughly) when they were born.  (Oh yeah: expect huge discrepancies in age.  I have one relative who was listed as 60 years old on one census and then listed as 60 years old on the next one ten years later.  Be extra suspicious when the ages are multiples of five.)  Good luck!"

Genealogy,37weiy,BreakforPuppies,2,Sun May 31 03:15:29 2015 UTC,"It looks like the years 1871-72 were particularly significant in Alsace, in that the population had to decide whether to stay and become German or to emigrate (and remain French), according to the Treaty of Frankfurt). It sounds as though your Mr Ober might have been among those who had to make that choice.   Given that the area had recently been at war, I wouldn't be surprised if local records had been affected, unfortunately. There's also a chance that he could have moved several times (perhaps first to somewhere else in France?).   Oh, and bear in mind that the territory of ""Alsace-Lorraine"" was only created by that treaty in 1871, so his parents birth records won't use that term, even if they were born within that geographical region.   Have you seen the episode of Who Do You Think You Are with J K Rowling?

Genealogy,37weiy,BreakforPuppies,2,Mon Jun 1 03:21:15 2015 UTC,"Have you seen this Alsace-Lorraine citizenship card yet?  The birthdate is off by a couple of days, but the place is spot on.   Here is the source info from Ancestry:   Ancestry.com. Alsace-Lorraine, France Citizenship Declarations (Optants), 1872 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2010. Original data: ARFIDO S.A. Les Optants d'Alsace Lorraine. Série 43. Paris: ARFIDO S.A., 2006. © ARFIDO S.A. Source Description Alsace-Lorraine was a territory ceded by France to Germany in the Treaty of Frankfurt (May 10, 1871), as a consequence of the Franco-Prussian War. It included most of the region of Alsace and about a quarter of the region of Lorraine. In 1872, those who elected to retain their French citizenship rather than become German, submitted statements in the town hall and published the fact in the weekly ""Bulletins des lois de la République française"". This data collection consists of index cards created by ARFIDO, a French genealogical and research association, from the original published lists. Each index card contains the name of the declarant, their birth date and place, the declaration date, the number of the original legal bulletin, the name of their spouse (if married), and their home address.   I didn't see any citizenship cards for a Peter or a Marie/Mary that were living in the same place as Antonie, but I did find this card for a Marie who could be his sister. It says they were living in Versailles in 1872, but that both Antonie and Marie were born in Brumath.   I also found this birth record for Antoine Ober, born in Brumath on 30 October 1853. His parents were listed as Joseph Ober (34 year old mason) and Madeline Enger (31 years old). The fact that his father was a mason might be significant if Antonie was a bricklayer. There was no other record for a Antoine Ober born on 27 October 1853 in Brumath. You can browse the parish registers for yourself here.  It looks like his wife reported his parent's names, so it's possible she got it wrong. You might have to do a little more research to confirm this is the correct birth record and that the death certificate is wrong."

She might have decided to keep it to herself, for some reason, even if that meant taking ""the blame"" for having had a child out of wedlock. The fact that you have access to the estate inventory and they don't make a mention of the father point to the name of the father never being known.   What I would do, if I were you, is to order a copy of the court records for the same year for that parish, just to make sure.

Genealogy,37vvqc,sockerkaka,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:05:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, that would often be true. Sometimes it would be more than that, especially if the mother was dependent on the father, somehow (her boss, landowner, priest, teacher etc). If the mother was very young and the father wasn't, that would also sometimes make a difference.  I don't think I've ever seen a court record that clearly states ""ordered to pay twice as much as..."", it usually just states the amount. Different courts and clerks worded things very differently as well, so you never really know what to look for. If I were you, I'd look for the name of the mother and the child but keep the total sum in mind as well since you can kind of figure out what would be reasonable based on what the mother paid."
Genealogy,37vvqc,sockerkaka,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:22:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I meant I didn't know what double would look like since I'm not familiar with their currency.

FWIW, I've always assumed the boy's father was named Per (because he initially became Peter Persson) but that happened after his mother died, so I kind of think he was just given a last name for the sake of having one. When his mother does pay her fine, she doesn't actually show up herself. A man named Jonas Larsson (though of no relation to her) evidently brings her written confession and presumably the money. I'm now kind of wondering if maybe HE is the father. He was married at the time and on the household records, they actually made a note by his name which translates to ""tends to drinking.""  I wonder if perhaps either A) he threatened her to not say anything or B) offered to pay her if she kept quiet about it since he already was married and had kids of his own"

Genealogy,37nzj3,TheManWithTheBigName,3,Fri May 29 01:17:45 2015 UTC,"Let's start with Mary. Some descendants of Pierre Pilote of Frampton, Québec, ended up in Moose River by way of Waterville, Maine, so I checked to see if Mary could have been a daughter in this family. Marie Albine Pilote, daughter of Pierre and Henriette (Laterreur) Pilote, was born and baptized 15 July 1863 at Saint-Edouarde-de-Frampton. This matches the birth date of Mary Giroux from the 1900 census.  As for Louis, I suspect that he was a little younger than the U.S. censuses say, that he too had relatives that settled in Waterville, and that this could be his naturalization record. Most of the Giroux family members who lived in Waterville came from Beauceville, and the only Louis Giroux I can find from that area was born and baptized 21 Feb. 1856 at Saint-Francois-de-Beauce, the son of Charles and Mathilde (Lachance) Giroux. (Other sources give his mother's name as ""Martine."")  This Louis Giroux married 30 Oct. 1876 at Saint-Georges, Québec, Marie Roy. On 26 Aug. 1877, the day after her birth, Marie Giroux, the daughter Louis and Marie (Roy) Giroux, was baptized at Saint-Georges. I believe that this was the daughter of Louis who died at Moose River in 1893. The 1910 census confirms that Louis had been married twice.  This (not-to-be-entirely-trusted) Ancestry.com page for the family says that Louis died 12 Jan. 1925 in Moose River."

Often, Ancestry and FamilySearch are working off images of the same microfilm that is housed at State Archives and the indexes are different or the algorithms that the search engines use to return results are different.  FamilySearch has a lot of town and county vital records on microfilm that are not fully digitized. I alway search their catalog by geographical location first for vital records on microfilm. It looks like Dane County Wisconsin has quite a few birth and marriage records from the mid 1800s to 1907.  Microfilms are only $7 to borrow from your local Family History Center.. The caveat is that sometimes you have to get the index first and then find the volume that contains the original record. I usually try and find indexes online for free at first.   It also varies widely by state/county/town. For example, West Virginia has an amazing set of digitized vital records online for free.   I work in archival digitization. It takes a herculean effort to digitize and index these records. Most cash strapped states and counties don't really have the resources to do this, so I don't expect these records to be online anytime soon (unless maybe they partner with Ancestry or FamilySearch).

Maybe contact them or Prince George's County to see if you can locate the original record.   If Elizabeth was married before and Maddox is not her maiden name, it might be difficult to find her maiden name (and as a result a record of her in the 1850 and 1860 Federal Census).   Have you searched historic newspapers yet? I know there are quite a few for the Balitmore/DC corridor. There may be an obituary for a Mr. Maddox, but if it was before 1871 it may not list a surviving wife by her first name.   Also, FamilySearch has a large collection of records from Maryland Register of Wills completely digitized for many counties, including Prince George's and Baltimore City. Maybe search the indexes for the Maddox family to see if you can find a possible father or maybe first husband. It's a long shot, but it's something to look into.   This 1860 Federal Census record for a Betty Maddox is somewhat interesting.

Genealogy,37in45,essari,1 point,Wed May 27 23:44:50 2015 UTC,"Francis' family is originally from Calvert County, it is where he was born and raised. His mother remarried shortly after his birth to a man named Ogden in Baltimore County. They lived in Calvert County for at least 20 years afterwards. Between 1860 and 1870, Francis' mother and step-father moved to Baltimore. This is an incredibly common migration for families from Calvert County. Nothing out of the ordinary here really. It was also common for single men to move to Baltimore from Calvert County looking for work, and then move back home after they were married. Single women also moved to Baltimore for work as well, but this was less common. It just seems that a widowed Francis moved with his elderly mother to the city.   What seems to make the most sense to me is that Francis met Elizabeth in Baltimore, or in a nearby area. They then left Baltimore, stopped to get married in PG. I don't understand why they wouldn't marry in Baltimore or DC instead, unless Elizabeth was from the area. But we can't assume. They then continued south to Manassas, a modern suburb of DC. They probably arrived in Manassas shortly after they were married. It was an important railroad junction during the Civil War (two battles were fought there) and the couple probably arrived by rail. Manassas wasn't even incorporated until 1873, at least a year after the couple arrived. This move has always baffled me. I have no clue why they would have moved down to Manassas for 2-3 years.   The move back to Calvert County is less confusing. Its where Francis grew up, and I've seem the migration back to Calvert County after marrying happen multiple times in my tree.   I agree it could offer a clue to where she was from. I figure she or her family probably lived either in Prince William County, DC, or PG County.   Francis, for the most part, was a farmer. He also owned a Funeral Home and was an undertaker. While in Baltimore his occupation is just given as ""laborer"".   Don't have any info on the church, or even the town, they were married in. Just PG. The index is all that seems to be available and the minister's name that is given was illegible."
Genealogy,37in45,essari,1 point,Thu May 28 00:17:32 2015 UTC,"The 1900 census gives me a lot of problems. First, it says Francis and Elizabeth have been married since 1862, which isn't possible as Francis would have been married to his first wife at the time, since his children from that marriage were born in 1862 and 1868.    If I recall correctly, the 1900 census lists the date/age at first marriage.  So 1862 would have  been the year of Francis's first marriage.  You may be able to determine from this if Elizabeth was previously married if the ages/years do not match up."

Also, I don't know where you got the information that the 1784 George was a dwarf, but think that would have kept him out of the military.  Have you made any attempts to get his marriage record?

Genealogy,37edd4,essari,1 point,Wed May 27 17:40:01 2015 UTC,"That's the problem--there isn't much information on James. It's believed he may have been born in New London, CT in 1745, and had the migration route of CT->MA->VT->NY. He settled in Ulster Co., NY with his wife Abigail Camp and is thought to have had around 15 children. However, only half of his children have been documented.  Good point about George Minard (the dwarf) not being able to serve in the military. I found that information in a booklet on the history of Rockingham, and yes you're correct, the birth dates don't match up. This leads me to believe that the George Minard (son of William Minard of Rockingham) was the dwarf, whereas my George Minard was born to a different father (possibly James given the similar migration paths). Also, James had at least one son that migrated to Elgin Co., Ontario, which borders where George Minard resided for a bit with his wife and children. I can't remember if I was able to find a marriage certificate or not, but I don't think I ever did because I don't seem to have it within my files..."

It seems like you've hit the nail on the head in some ways because his wife was from New York, and her father was a Loyalist during the American Revolution (despite being born in the US). George Minard also fought for the British during the War of 1812. James Minard (the second option I have for his father) spent a bit of time in Ulster county, NY, and was a Quaker pacifist aka Loyalist."

Most Loyalists were ""U.S."" born, and New York was largely Loyalist in persuasion. Quakers were pacifists, but they weren't necessarily Loyalists (some were, some weren't--many NY Quakers were of ""minority"" (Germans, Dutch) populations who didn't care about English problems one way or the other). The VT Quakers were mostly English.  Ulster county at the time was probably the largest settled area outside of NYC, with pretty good probate, land, and tax records. You'll have good luck researching there.   Vermont is pretty sparse and difficult for the time frame.  Vermont was also considered part of NY or NH, depending on whom you asked at the time. Many ""Yorkers"" found themselves living in Vermont after the Rev. War.  If you have information on his wife's family, I would look earnestly where they were living for your Minards. Did he receive Loyalist land in Canada (Ontario or Quebec?). Most families tended to stick together, and it wasn't super common to let a daughter marry an entirely unknown person/handsome stranger."

For example, thanks to various records I know a lot about my grandma's family members who were murdered in the Holocaust; I'd never leave those facts out of a family history report, but I'm not going to go bringing that up to my 90-year-old grandma in conversation.

Genealogy,37cmsw,VividLotus,1 point,Tue May 26 20:35:56 2015 UTC,"True, but to be fair, you can also find out many of those things via non-DNA-related genealogy, or even by mere happenstance without making any efforts at genealogical research. As an example of the former, if you reseached your great-grandma's family and discovered that both of her parents were immigrants from Scotland, that'd be the end of her story right there.  As an aside, I'm not sure whether having one Native American great-grandparent would necessarily always show up on a DNA test. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable can confirm or deny. But to make a long story short, you definitely don't get 50% of your DNA from each parent; a person whose father was 100% French and mother was 100% Japanese aren't necessarily going to get a 50/50 split between those two groups on a DNA test, and this seems to be even more the case when it comes to great-grandparents and beyond."

And why skies are almost always completely overexposed in most older photos and photos of flags with red & blue look a bit odd.

Richard III was identified using mitochondrial DNA, which survives in buried bodies far longer that nuclear DNA. mtDNA is passed from mother to child, so scientists found two living people who shared both matrilineal ancestry and mtDNA haplogroup with Richard. Even this was not conclusive proof, as thousands of Richard's contemporaries would have shared the same haplogroup, so other historical and archaeological evidence was needed to make the identification.  There are also Y-DNA tests which could prove that a living man shared patrilineal ancestry with long-dead royalty, but again, this would not prove descent, but only that they shared a common patrilineal ancestor. And it would not be useful tracing ancestry through a daughter, as only men inherit their father's Y-chromosome."
Genealogy,378jfo,phronimost,2,Mon May 25 20:05:12 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the breakdown. I figured it couldn't be as easy as matching DNA tests. :(  Do you have any recommendations on my next step in proving some sort of relationship?
Genealogy,378jfo,ppden,4,Mon May 25 20:39:03 2015 UTC,"The quick answer: Y-DNA tests can match strict paternal lines. mtDNA tests can match strict maternal lines. Both go as far back as you want, and Y-DNA as close to the present as you want.  For mixed lines, you have autosomal DNA. But this thins out quickly, so you will likely not correctly match anyone beyond 5th-7th cousins.   To prove the connection you mention, you could trace maternal lines, until you have two live maternal descendants of Elizabeth and Mary Jane respectively, and then test their mtDNA."

Genealogy,378jfo,rogue780,1 point,Tue May 26 14:47:12 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. mtDNA alone does not prove the relationship. But if you combine it with statistical knowledge of how rare the specific haplogroup is, and the fact that you have an already suggested relationship - then you can possibly get close to a proof.  On the other hand the test may, as you say, be used to rule out the relationship - and that has value as well."

Genealogy,377vuz,fxvet,2,Mon May 25 16:33:27 2015 UTC,"There is an explanation here:   In 1634 the Privy Council authorized the patenting of lands under the principle of granting patents to any person who qualified as a planter. In practice, the acreage was awarded to the person who paid the transportation cost of the emigrant and not to the settler himself. This method, called the headright system, was employed as the major means of distributing virgin lands in the 17th century.    More on the headright system here.   Individuals who could afford to do so would accumulate headrights by providing funds for poor individuals to travel to Virginia. (During the 17th century, the cost of transport from England to the colonies was about six pounds per person.) This system led to the development of indentured servitude where poor individuals would become workers for a specified number of years and provide labor in order to repay the landowners who had sponsored their transportation to the colonies."

Even within the past thousand years, Ralph and Coop found, people on opposite sides of the continent share a lot of segments in common–so many, in fact, that it’s statistically impossible for them to have gotten them all from a single ancestor. Instead, someone in Turkey and someone in England have to share a lot of ancestors. In fact, as Chang suspected, the only way to explain the DNA is to conclude that everyone who lived a thousand years ago who has any descendants today is an ancestor of every European.

Also from my research, my mother's ancestors include English, Welsh, Irish, French, Dutch, German, Danish, and some others. Mostly northern European. My DNA results support this in general, geographic terms.  But there is also some tiny portion in the DNA that indicates some southern European and central Asian. Central Asian?

Once you get a relative who is alive in 1940 and you know where they lived, check out the 1940 United States Census records. It will show said relative with their family. Keep stepping back each census, 1930, 1920, 1910, ect following said relative until you have their parents. Then, continue going back in the census with their parent's names. This works well as far back as 1850. Some censuses can be found online for free, while some are behind pay sites like ancestry. Also, never forget your local library.  If you know where someone was married, check the courthouse for marriage records. If they were born or died after about 1910 (on average), the state probably has birth or death records you can obtain. As you get more advanced, you can look through old newspapers archives as well. Military records are available as well.  I'd say in the beginning, the primary thing to do is to ask a narrow question and stick with that.

If you're really motivated search for your state of interest's census page on familysearch's wiki, and you'll usually be able to find free copies of every census on Internet Archive.  For example, here's Virginia's page.  Unfortunately though, they're just images with no index, so you'll have to go through every single image trying to find what you're looking for.  Although you can usually use information from familysearch's census indices to narrow down where you need to look, like page number and county, that sort of stuff."

Genealogy,36vzqb,simthembile,1 point,Fri May 22 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"As other have said, start with yourself, your siblings and your parents.  Record their names, their spouses and kids, dates of birth, marriage, etc. Move on to your aunts, uncles, grandparents and great-grandparents - their names, names of their siblings, spouses and children, dates of birth, marriage, death.  Soon you'll have the beginnings of your family tree, and you'll probably haved learned some new things already.  Once you have some definite names and birthdates from the 1940s or before, you can start searching on Ancestry.com for more.  It's easy to get caught up in internet searches on Ancestry and other sites, but your most important resources are your oldest relatives - they will have stories and first-hand information that you won't be able to find anywhere else, and (unlike internet archives) they won't be around forever.  Interview them, and audio/video record it if possible - years from now, you'll be glad you did.  My great grandparents died when I was a teenager - I sure wish now I could go back and ask them some questions about the family.  The more you learn, the more you'll want to know - it gets addictive fast.  Good luck!"
Genealogy,36vzqb,GogglesPisano,2,Fri May 22 19:05:41 2015 UTC,"I was lucky. Mom knew a lot of names and birth dates. She made note of them over the years. Her mother, too. Between those two I had five generations instantly. Write down what you know, but as soon as you can, write down what your family knows. You can work on proving everything at a later date, but you never know when a critical source might die. Interview your oldest relatives first.   Proving: Documents, including birth, marriage, divorce, and death certificates. Family Bibles were often used to write down this information and will be accepted for proof. Other records include census records, draft registrations, burial records, city directories, obituaries, and more. Frequently you get more than one family member listed. Informant, next of kin, parents, survivors, etc. Read for all details.  I know some people who are only interested in their direct lines - their direct ancestors. Don't be this person. I have found 5th cousins with our common ancestor being an American Revolutionary War Soldier. I found a 2nd cousin who lead me to the cemetery where our 2nd great grandparents were buried. She knew all along, but wasn't computer savvy enough to make the information public.   It's a great hobby."
Genealogy,36vzqb,CovingtonLane,1 point,Fri May 22 21:31:40 2015 UTC,"My advice is start with what's free - your local library is a great resource, there are free resources online and there's free software you can download to your computer (though most online services have free versions for building your tree, etc.).  And start with what you know (as /u/TCamp3 put so well).  One thing to be aware of right from the start - it's hard work and very time-consuming, once you get past what you know.  You'll pick out the 'low-hanging fruit' and get some really motivating results, but you'll eventually find many brick walls that will take you (possibly) months to break down.  The good news is that, by the time you get there, you'll either have given up because you weren't really interested enough or you'll have caught the bug and will keep going because the challenge makes it worthwhile!  Happy hunting!"
Genealogy,36vzqb,Fijjit,1 point,Sat May 23 12:25:59 2015 UTC,"Learn as much as you can from relatives. The important thing once you get to searching records is to know where and when people lived and what where their exact names. However not everyone remembers formalities in such details, but rather life events, so just talk to people, try to draw up a family tree with them, find out how much they interacted with people they tell you about, when, where, how old were they themselves and people they talk about, important events in their life, what they did for living etc. That's going to give you at least rough idea where to look and how reliable their memory is. Try to find get your hands on documents and pictures that you have in your family and learn everything you can from those. Once you've done that look up resources you have available in area they were from - vital records and censuses are obvious thing, but it also can be worthwhile to look through old newspapers, phonebooks and such - even most unnotable people leave some paper trail."

Genealogy,36vop9,somethinginsideme,2,Fri May 22 15:20:55 2015 UTC,"Here is what my sister has to say:   I do not claim to be an authority, but here is what I can contribute:  The Romans occupied Britain for about 400 years, up until about 400 A.D.  (it was Celtic before that)  So, if this person has any Southern European DNA, it's possible it could come from Roman blood, although from what I've read, Roman soldiers didn't really mix much genetically with the population.  It could also be something ancient, like from migrations of people after the Ice Age when there was a land bridge connecting Britain to Europe. However, if it's a small percentage, this could also be ""noise"" in the data.  (A corruption of the data.)   (You, Mom and I also have a tiny bit of southern european DNA that I can't explain, either.)   As the Roman occupation started to decline, Germanic tribes (Jutes, Saxons, Angles) from Northern Germany and Denmark came and settled, mostly in the east, and generally melded over time and generally came to be known as the Anglo-Saxons and ran England. That was in the 400s till about 1066.   Meanwhile, Viking/Norse invasions/settlements of England, Scotland and Ireland happened in the 700s and 800s.  They were mostly in the north (so there is a lot of Norse blood in Scotland, for example.)  There was some duking it out with the Anglo-Saxons for a while.  So, Anglo-Saxons pretty much ruled England until the Normans came from France and conquered England in 1066.  Here's what makes it more confusing:  the Normans were originally Vikings who settled in the Normandy region of France, and even though they acclimated linguistically and culturally with the French, they were still of Scandinavian DNA descent. So, after several generations of being in France and acclimating with the French, they conquered Britain. At his point, they were probably bringing both French and Scandinavian blood, but they were French-speaking and would have had French names.  The Normans also eventually invaded Wales and Ireland. I don't know much about Normans in Wales, but I know there were definitely Norman settlements in Ireland, so yes, there would be ""French"" DNA and French-influenced last names in Ireland.  This person should Google ""Hiberno-Normans"" to learn more about Irish families who are of French descent.  in fact, this website claims that Norman surnames make up 10% of modern Irish surnames.   So, anyone who has roots in the Isles is likely a mix of all these things.  That's why it's confusing when 23andme decides to label someone as ""British/Irish"" and then also ""Scandinavian"" and ""French/German"", because ""British/Irish"" should already encompass those."

Under ""Place of Birth"" for Anna and her two eldest children, the word Russia is preceded by ""Novozipkoff."" This must refer to Novozybkov.  On 24 Feb. 1912, Chane Karasik of Novozybkov arrived at Ellis Island in New York aboard the S.S. Birma from Libau. She was accompanied by her husband Gilja, and their children Isaak, 11, Moisey, 9, Basse, 4, Itta, 3, and Chaim, age not given. Their contact in the old country was father Jankel Karasik of Novozybkov. They were headed for Baltimore to join Chane's brother M. Rosinsky, 24 High Street. The 1912 Baltimore City Directory shows Max Rosinsky living at that address."

I don't think Bessie is his wife in 1920 because tt would be weird that he came to the US in 1914 and left his wife back in Russia for 8 years until she came over in 1922. It's not solid but it could be the right guy.  But, yeah, aside from going back and double checking everything I don't know where else to look for new info.

So the story of Harry actually makes sense here....  Facts we know:    Annie came to America in 1912 (as Chane, with Gilja).  Grandfather confirms that she had some involvement in the fish industry. Told me that his bathtub would often be filled with fish! Abraham (Al) Jacobson (later Al Karson) was born in 1921. Sometime between arrival in the US and Al's birth, Annie became ""Jacobson"" and married Herman. No one knows if ""Harry"" walked out on them or if he died.

Genealogy,36scem,sixinabox,5,Thu May 21 18:59:27 2015 UTC,"Of course it is! It's totally fine, and people do it all the time. I mean, think about it: that's what historians do. They research interesting people from history, who are not (in the vast majority of cases) related to them. And even if you only research your own family, chances are good that you'll also be looking into people who aren't really quite related to you. For example, maybe your great-great aunt married a really interesting guy, and you research him. You're not biologically related to him, you never met him. But there's nothing wrong with researching him. The obvious caveat here is to always be honest; for example, there are some records that you cannot obtain unless you can prove your relationship to the person (even if they are deceased), and obviously it's unethical and probably illegal to lie in order to get those records. But in terms of public records that are freely available, or records that are allowed to be searched or obtained by anyone who asks, there's no problem.  From an ethical standpoint, the one personal rule I have is that when it comes to families other than my own, I refuse to research/report on (even if asked directly) anyone who is still alive, or whose status is unknown but their date of birth was <100 years ago. Since I help a lot of other Jewish people research their family history, this means I end up with a lot of genealogy reports that end in the 1940s. If I was unable to confirm someone's death, I wouldn't report on anyone who was born in the past century. Even for my own family, I have asked older individuals if they wish to be included in the genealogy reports and photo album I distribute to the whole extended family. If they say no, I keep that information privately, and won't add it to any semi-public documents until after their death.  When it comes to people who were alive in the 19th century, however, I think researching those people is both a fun idea, and a neat thing to do because you may be preserving the memory of people who are currently unknown to any other living person."

Never feel guilty for researching anyone who's definitely not alive/born over 100 years ago.  I happily 'borrow' family trees from friends and exes to just explore new-to-me databases and learn more about niche subjects periodically. I have no Irish roots for example but I've worked on a friend's Dublin based line just to get a feel for what's available and how to research there. I looked into one of an ex's lines because I knew it included railway navvies and I wanted to see how often/where they moved and what sort of conditions they experienced.

Adopted members of my family are of course in my tree, because they're my family member in every way other than the biological. The spouses of ancestors are included in my tree because they're still part of my family, and because on a practical level, finding others who are researching them may also give me info about more directly-related family members.  The only people I do exclude are boarders or others who lived with a family member but were never a part of the family by any definition other than perhaps emotional sentiment, and friends. I have separate trees for some of these people, however.  I think it's nice to have a direct-lineage family tree somewhere, but I don't think ""drawing the line"" anywhere really benefits anyone. Some food for thought: some of the most valuable and helpful information I've gotten about my own family came from people to whom I'm not biologically related, or we're extremely distant relatives (e.g. my great-great grandmother was their great-grandmother's stepmother). If I drew the line and only included direct ancestors or very close relatives in my tree, I'd never have connected with these people.

Genealogy,36rfah,Forever_Forgotten,1 point,Thu May 21 18:43:00 2015 UTC,"This assumes I have only one tree; I have several. I will mention two.  The first is my Rozell tree, where I am attempting to document all Rozells from a specific part of New York State. This is an attempt to track down an estimated 9 missing children of my 5th great grandfather Peter Rozell (1753-1863; not a typo) from his first marriage, who according to newspaper accounts were almost all boys. I have good sources and have documented his 13 children from his second wife whom he married at age 56 (she was 17), but his first family remains largely a mystery. Inevitably for a surname study, I will end up documenting non relatives, but this is fine as they may be able to help other researchers.   The other tree stemmed from a project I did in undergrad school more years ago than I like to admit. A local family loaned the history department more than 60 letters written during the Civil War by three brothers, and my job was to transcribe them. I still had my photocopies of the letters and a copy of the transcript. Out of curiosity I decided to build out their family tree, and through this I was able to connect with a family member in Texas who had no idea these letters existed. I sent her my copies of the letters, though I kept my transcript. I got to ""know"" these three brothers through their letters and didn't want to part entirely with all my copies. Someday I will make an electronic transcript of my transcript (my copy is typed).  But to give an idea of how attached I got to these three, I actually cried when I found out one of the brothers did not survive the war; one of the letters was from the youngest brother who had been given leave to accompany his oldest brother's body home. My prof, alarmed by my reaction, asked me what was wrong. ""Henry's dead!"" I sobbed. With a look of patience combined with mild exasperation, my prof said, ""Of course he is. He born in 1830."""

Laying out details in a different format to the one you're used to helps you reconsider what you are seeing. It also forces you to consider research questions and issues line by specific line rather than blurring them together. I have two lines in one area but focusing on them separately like this really highlighted the difference in researching them and made me tackle specific questions that I might not picked up on if I had just kept working with FTM, visual trees and fan charts. Researching an unusual surname, looking into everyone who had it and creating a super-tree of them all is called a One Name Study. They work best when done by someone with a ton of experience researching and who knows how to organise their records. They give the ability to create a fantastic resource and knock down lots of brick walls for other people and possibly your own branch of the family.  Similarly there are One Place Studies that reconstruct family trees for a specific village or settlement. It needs to be fairly small unless you want to work in a group but it can be fascinating and a very good challenge for a researcher as it forces you to really know the area and your research could take you in any direction - you can't know in advance where researching the people of the area will take you."

The picture is a little too grainy to tell much about his jacket, but it seems to have very wide lapels and high-set sleeves, which means it's probably a frock coat. It's black, and he has a white shirt and a shawl-style, light colored waistcoat underneath.  His hair is slightly long, and has been combed forward and over his ears.

But it only refers to the father's brother.  For the mother's brother, they used a different term...which is avunculus.  This is derived from avus, which means ""grandfather,"" plus a diminuitive suffix, so it literally means ""little grandfather.""  So I think it has just as much of a masculine tone as patruus does.   The fact that it's second declension (singular -us, plural -i) doesn't help either, because most of those nouns are masculine.  Nor does it help that the English word avuncular means uncle-like.  It's just weighed down by all of this baggage that makes it awkward to use as a collective noun.  If this is just for your own purposes, just go with it.  But if you intend to share this software with anyone, I would suggest not using any sort of coined term for ""auntuncle.""  You're just going to confuse everybody..."

There are dozens of words derived from ""pat-"" meaning father, whereas there are are few, indeed only one or two that are derived from ""avuncul-."" In fact, there is a sense in which the word ""avuncular"" applies just fine to aunts because aunts are ""uncle-like"" in that they are also the sibling of an ancestor. Furthermore, I think ""avunculi"" being so close to ""avuncular"" will confuse very few people who are doing genealogy.  So basically I disagree with all of your points.

The Sharks didn't like the idea for this reason: they thought the improved utility of the new boxes was not substantial enough to warrant their investment.  Most people don't really have problems with the traditional boxes, so there's no reason for them to seek out an new alternative, especially a more expensive one.  As Mark Cuban said, ""You're overthinking.  You've got a solution and you're trying to find the problem.""  I kind of feel like I could apply those same words to you.  You can't expect people to just decide to start using the term avunculi, because if they really needed it, it would have been coined by now.

Do you speak for a great number of other people, as for instance, the president of a regional genealogical society which has already seriously considered the issue? If not, you aren't in a position to speak to whether or not it is an issue. If so, then you shouldn't be dismissing an issue being brought up to the group by a person who shares its interests.

Father William Gray (32), Mother Annie (25). Children Robert (7), William (5) and Thomas (3). Thomas was born in Hamilton, Lanarkshire. The source citation is Parish: Hamilton; ED: 27; Page: 54; Line: 15; Roll: CSSCT1901_339, but all I can see is the index record, not the original. Cross checking on findmypast, William Gray (father) is listed as a coal miner, born in Old Monkland, Lanarkshire. Annie was born in Glasgow, Robert in Airdrie and William and Thomas in Hamilton. The ship manifest you have is, I think, from the Melita, sailing from Glasgow in 1929. William seems to have left in 1928, on the Athenia. His occupation is given as labourer, and the address is 3 Holyrood Street, Burnbank. Hope this helps."

Genealogy,36gsjt,codythewolf,14,Tue May 19 07:27:35 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately family crests/coats of arms only belonged to specific people, not everyone with the same last name, so the truth is most people do not have one.  The only exception is if you are lucky enough to trace your line back to someone who did.  Most of the stuff you see is just companies trying to make money off the idea.  If you are still interested in learning about your heritage, people here are generally very helpful and enjoy doing a little friendly research.  If you post what you know about your most recent deceased ancestors (no living people), we might be able to assist you.  You might get more of a response by creating a new post to that effect though, as family crest posts are extremely common here."
Genealogy,36gsjt,robspeaks,9,Tue May 19 08:28:01 2015 UTC,"This is entirely correct. They are called 'arms' (the crest is just the top portion of a set of arms) and few people are the rightful owners of them. You may bear arms if you are the rightful owner having been given the honors or if you have inherited the honor. No two people carry the same arms. Your brother would have differencing marks, and your sister would carry a version in the shape of a lozenge. What you see in the US is a commercialization of other people's arms from historical registers. They look up the name and just pick one because there are often multiple arms for the same name.   And different nations had their own customs and laws. Germany was very tight about their arms, as was England but other countries not so much. Many people in France, bourgeois especially, were forced to buy arms as a revenue enhancer, so there are books full of arms purchased for this reason. They are still not your arms.  But in America arms are not legally recognized and much commercial blarney has surrounded the whole thing.  On the other hand you could be 'armigerous' and not know it, that is one could be the rightful carrier of inheritable arms. The odds are heavy against this however. Anyway it is probably more legitimate for you to design your own arms and have them registered.  edited for sp."

The only family I can claim any descent from that I know was armigerous at one point was the Gates family (the Gates who were mixed up in the Jane Grey plot), but given that the last Gates in that line to me was my fourth-great-grandmother Alvira Gates, there is no way I have a snowball's chance of a claim on that.

Genealogy,36fg0a,harv4276,2,Tue May 19 00:27:14 2015 UTC,"This is what I would do.  I'm assuming you're based in the US.  Start with your grandparents.  Locate them in the census.  The US census was taken every year that is a multiple of 10, with 1940 being the most recent year available (1890 was destroyed in a fire, though).  Here is the 1940 census.  Put your grandparents' names, birth years, and residences and they should pop up.  If you're lucky they'll be living with their parents (your great-grandparents), so voilà, you have names for them!  The census will also say what country they were born in.  If your great-grandparents were born in the US, just keep going back in the census until you can't go back anymore.    If they were born elsewhere, time to start looking for immigration records!  What you really need is some document that states what city they were born in (naturalization record, death certificate, passenger manifest, etc.)  Check Ellis Island's records for any information.  Some of the censuses have the year of immigration listed, so be sure to search by that (plus or minus a few years).    Once you've located the town they come from, it's time to start looking into records from the old country.  For your Jewish side, JewishGen is THE website to use.  Can't help you with the German side, my family's Irish and Italian.  A few beginner's tips I wished I had known:  – TALK TO YOUR FAMILY.  Your grandparents (if they're still living) will give you more information than you'll EVER be able to find online.  I kept on telling myself ""You know, I should really talk to my Great-Uncle Bill, he'd be able to help me""...and he passed away before I had a chance. :-( Also your parents, aunts/uncles, cousins, etc...talk to EVERYONE.  – When going through documents, expect there to be inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and misspellings galore.  This is especially true of census records.  Use your common sense to determine the information that is most likely to be correct.    – Ancestry.com is worth the money.  That being said, it's not quite cheap, so if you don't want to shell out the cash, there are alternatives.  Check your local library—a lot of them have access to databases (including Ancestry) that would normally cost you an arm and a leg.  Also, locate the nearest LDS Family History Center and see how they can help as well.  Good luck!"
Genealogy,36cvcj,LaceratedCantaloupe,4,Mon May 18 11:06:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I didn't discover it this week, but it's still interesting. My fourth-great grandfather was born in Regensburg, Germany in 1824.  He left home when he was 16 and traveled the country to find work.  When he was 24, he came to America.  He kept in touch with his family back home, including his older brother, Leonard.  Leonard had three daughters, and my grandfather told him he would try to gather up enough money to bring the four of them to America.  Unfortunately, he could not get enough, and Leonard and his daughters stayed in Germany.  (Leonard eventually died due to a horrible infection in his leg, but that's another story).  His daughter Henrietta ended up having a son-in-law named Wilhelm Brodmerkel, who was the Obsturmführer of the NSKK (National Socialist Motor Corps) in Regensburg during Kristallnacht.  He was killed on September 11, 1939 during Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland.  He also had two sons, both of whom were killed in the war, the elder in '44 and the younger in '45.  TLDR; My 4th-great grandpa told his brother he'd try and make enough money to bring him and his daughters to America, but couldn't do it.  The brother then died a gruesome death and his grandson became a prominent Nazi in Regensburg."

But there is a way around it - copy your sister-in-laws tree to MyHeritage and upload your tree to ancestry and then connect them.    Are you using FamilyTreeBuilder? If yes, create a gedcom-file and send it to your sister-in-law and or upload it on ancestry. You sister in law should be able to do the same, ie create a gedcom file that you can then upload to MyHeritage.    I submitted a request to become a member of his ""family site"", but I don't know what that does for me.    You get access to the tree he has built and to all the records. If there are photos of people or documents, you can see them. Depending upon the rights given to you by the owner of the tree you can also change records and add to them.    MyHeritage also has a bunch of things that pop up like Smart Matches, Record Matches, and a Discovery Hub. These all appear to be services associated with MyHeritage's Premium account set up. Is it worth spending the money (something like $90 a year) on these features?   Depends. I have been using MyHeritage for quite some time, but so far I have not needed to pay for a premium account. I had several smartmatches to other people's trees and in all cases I have been able to get in contact with the people in question without paying for MyHeritage Premium thanks to google, facebook and telephone directories.   The record matches I got were all to FamilySearch collections, so all I had to do was go to FamilySearch to view them for free.   Discovery Hub is AFAIK a search function to the site. So far I have been able to find what I need elsewhere with some google-fu and sleuthing.   So unless you really want/need access to that one document that is only available on MyHeritage I would not pay for the Premium account.    I found a bunch of DNA test kits.    Essentially there are three basic types of tests:  1) Autosomal DNA (the typical Ancestry/23andMe test) 2) Y-DNA for the male line, it specifically focuses on the Y-Chromosome 3) mtDNA or mitrochondrial DNA;, this is DNA that is passed down through the maternal line and the tests focus on that  All other additional tests are either fancier versions of those and or a combination of several tests.    but should I get DNA tests for them? If so, which ones?   Depends upon what you want to find out, some tests are better for certain things than others. But if you haven't got a clue I would recommend autosomal, ie the 99USD Ancestry/23andMe/etc test."

Genealogy,366rzy,ppden,1 point,Sat May 16 22:30:17 2015 UTC,"Yes. We know that my grandfather's mother was a carrier (my grandfather's older brother was a hemophiliac) and her father (grandfather's grandfather) died young of a hemorrhage, so was likely also a hemophiliac. I presume that at least his mother was a carrier as well (I can't find much on his parents but I did see that they are listed as having one daughter and one son with a huge gap in between so I'm wondering if they had some sons in between who died young from the disease. Great-great grandfather was born in the late 1800s, so it was actually astonishing that he lived to 40.)   If anything, I'd have a small chance of being a carrier (unlikely, since the gene would have to come through my grandfather and he didn't have the disease and thus is unlikely to have the gene defect) but I'm not super worried about it. Mostly I'm just curious about it because it's such a rare disorder."

Genealogy,366rzy,ppden,2,Sun May 17 03:31:29 2015 UTC,"I'm just thinking out of the box now:  Do you still have live family member with the disease? When you buy an autosomal DNA test/Family Finder test from 23andMe or FamilyTreeDNA, you also get results from the X-chromosome. They only test non-disease carrying DNA. Through them it is possible to find others, who match parts of the X-chromosome.  One caveat is that the X-chromosome has odd inheritance properties. As you know men have theirs from their mother, and females have one from each parent. All the autosomal chromosomes are mixed and split (pairwise) in the mother before passing them on, so a child will have 40-60% from each maternal grandparent. X-chromosomes can be inherited completely from one maternal grandparent and non from the other, 0-100%. See this blog post"

The insane asylums kept records of each patient and what they were being treated for.  The wikipedia article I mentioned was helpful, but they left out a section on women in insane asylums.  Sometimes elderly women with no family to take care of them were sent to asylums.  Worse was when a woman who had a baby out of wedlock was sent away--either because she had ""morals"" or because someone (even a family member) had raped her.    Women could be sent away for what we now recognize as postpartum depression or postpartum psychosis, too.   Women who didn't act as a ""normal"" woman should could also be sent away--for being lesbian or dressing in men's clothes."
Genealogy,366rzy,roland19d,1 point,Mon May 18 23:56:37 2015 UTC,"No, I've never been able to find any records from the hospital itself. At least none that are available to the public. I only know what happened to her because of family lore and census records. In the 1910 census, she was recorded as being in her husband's household and by the 1920 census, she was listed as a ""boarder"" at this facility (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traverse_City_State_Hospital). Her youngest child was born in 1915, so I know she didn't go to the hospital any later than that. 1920 was also the year her husband died of a hemorrhage and I haven't been able to figure out if that happened before or after she went into care. On his death certificate, she is listed as the widow and her residence is given as the one from the 1910 census, so I suspect that his death and her confinement to an asylum happened in pretty close succession.   That's part of why I don't think she was railroaded into treatment. I think her husband, the dominant male figure who would push for commitment in those kinds of cases, was dead and she had four children, the oldest just 13 years old. The kids went to live with her parents, suggesting that she did indeed have extended family who would help her and didn't have to go to the asylum.  Also, it seems that the Traverse City Hospital was known for being pretty progressive when it came to the treatment of mental illness, so I strongly suspect that she had some genuine mental problems. I suspect she had some sort of depressive disorder (possibly triggered by the unexpected death of her young husband). That's something that is well-represented in our gene pool.   Once she went in, she never left again. Her eldest daughter was my paternal grandfather's mother and she almost never mentioned her mother again and never visited her. Great-great-great grandma spent 50 years in the asylum and died in her 80s."
Genealogy,366rzy,paperhat,2,Tue May 19 00:36:34 2015 UTC,"This is something that can be done powerfully with genetic genealogy.  What you would need to do is know what gene is the cause of the condition, look up the location of the gene on the genome, then find relatives who share a segment of DNA at this location. If you know that you share a segment of DNA with a relative and you know your common ancestors with that relative, you can then attribute that shared segment of DNA to those common ancestors (excepting endogamy) and thus all of your ancestors on that line to that ancestral couple.  It's fairly easy to do this if you have had your genome genotyped by 23andMe because you can both look up the locations of genes in the Raw Data browser as well as see exactly how you share DNA with matches in the database with the Family Inheritance: Advanced chromosome browser. You could also do this having tested with FamilyTreeDNA or AncestryDNA, but you would have to look up the location of the gene somewhere else and AncestryDNA does not have a chromosome browser. You are only able to know what segments of DNA you share with your AncestryDNA matches if you can convince them to upload their data to GEDmatch.com."

In 1842, the Scottish physician Alexander Taylor (1802–1879) advocated Pau for a winter cure. The success of his work was important and Pau became a popular holiday resort for the British.   and   At the beginning of the 20th century, Pau was still a resort town where European nobility spent the winter. Good English, American, Russian, Spanish or Prussian society met in the Béarnaise city. Many public amenities were from this period, including the Pau Funicular to connect the station to the upper town. Next to these public amenities, wealthy foreign visitors were building villas to improve the conditions of their stay. First built in the centre of town, these residences spread out more and more to enjoy the great outdoors and popular views of the Pyrenees. Between 1850 and 1910, many residences were thus built and still evoke the splendour of this period, today. This golden period of climate tourism in Pau stopped abruptly at the outbreak of World War I.   My guess would be that she was either sick and had gone there for spa therapies or she was part of the holidaying set, either hints at her, her husband or one of their families having some money.

Link on Ancestry showing referencing microfilms to the regiments. I don't have access so I don't know how good the info is.  Considering James was born in England and Ellen was born in Ireland, I think its likely they met/married in Canada. Maybe he met her while serving in Ontario, brought her back to QC and she went back home once he died?"

The most likely would be this one born in 1811.  There's no marriage record for him though.  Do you have any other information, other then his name?"

He had four children, Hannah, John, Samuel and James, was in the 68th foot infantry, things like that. I can't seem to find anything on his movement to Canada, or when or where he married Ellen. There appear to have been a decent number of Porters in the area at this time, so it's possible that they met in Canada, but I haven't found any marriage record thus far.

Genealogy,361wlv,BookwormZA,1 point,Fri May 15 13:56:15 2015 UTC,"FreeReg isn't necessarily exhaustive, but the fact that pretty much all of them are in Yorkshire may help narrow down your search.  I see that there are a few more listed in that 1810, 1815 timeframe on Ancestry, again mostly in Yorkshire.   I'd check all the births in that time frame, and then eliminate all of those that can be seen in the 1841 / 1851 UK census."

We don't have so many plans to include census data at this time as so many other sites do that that it seemed like our place in all this was to provide the visualisation.  I'm really sorry you've had problems with the gedcom upload.  Please can you tell me how big is your gedcom file (file size and number of people)?  We can help work out why it is crashing if you send the file to mail@zoompast.org.  It might simply be that it's slow because our system is heavily loaded just after the launch.  The visualiser has place of birth and death as well as image, biography, e-mail, weblink and more for each person but it only shows the info that's actually present in the database - i.e. if place of birth is not entered it just leaves off the info until you add it by editing that entry to the tree.  Please be persistent and help us get through these initial teething troubles - we're really keen to solve your genealogy visualisation for you."

Genealogy,361r30,willardd,4,Fri May 15 11:02:04 2015 UTC,"Broke through a brick wall on my fathers side.   My grandfather left my grandmother when their family was very young. Only ever met him once at my father's (his son's) funeral and he subsequently died a few years after.  In asking my grandmother about him she kept drawing blanks on a lot of needed detail due to her age and how long ago with was 'with' him. So for a good while I was stuck.  Discovered another man whom shared my surname and lived in the area I lived in. The more I found on this man the more it seemed like he would be a fit as my great grandfather, but I just couldn't find it anything that made it a solid fact.  Rang my grandmother for another chat and thought id tease in some information without revealing too much so that maybe it would jog her memory but wouldn't run the risk of tricking her into thinking the info I was giving her was correct.  She started to reminisce about her first husband and was telling me some things that happened etc until she mention that whilst she couldn't remember his name she always remembered his nickname 'Blue'.   Possible hit! The other person I found had his nickname 'Blue' mentioned in his funeral notice in the news paper but I didn't feel it was enough evidence. So i needed a back up question. So i asked where she and him had chosen her first son's (my uncles) name from.  She remembered easily that it was because her first husband had a brother in the family that didn't live past the age of 2 before he died. I had also discovered this thanks to a little bit of research I had done on the mystery man.   It was enough to make me 100% certain I'd found the link I needed which exploded, with the help of research of course, the family tree out and got me a further 200 years back.

One thing I found interesting about it is that the card suggests that he was deployed to Gallipoli, which is very interesting indeed. It seems though that the British War Medal section was scratched out when he had the Victory Medal and the 1915 Star. Perhaps the writer was just trying to write ""same as the above""?

Genealogy,35yux0,gimmebackmyfamily,4,Thu May 14 17:39:46 2015 UTC,"/u/SwampRabbit has it. In newly settled forested areas, the first homes to be built would have been log cabins made from the timber felled on-site. Frame homes would usually come later, once a sawmill could be established, or else would cost more because of the expense of transporting milled lumber over rough roads.  Log cabins required hard labor to build, but the materials were cheap and the building methods were pretty simple. Frame homes made with milled lumber required less physical labor to build, but the materials were more expensive at first. In addition, early frame homes often required employment of a skilled tradesman called a house carpenter, housewright or joiner. Nowadays, anyone can frame a wall using a pile of two-by-fours and a box of nails. But building a sound wall using post-and-beam construction methods is not something just anyone could accomplish.  There are accounts in my hometown of early settlers building their own log cabins with the help of neighbors. But when it was time to build permanent homes, they usually hired a professional. One particular house carpenter is credited with framing 150+ homes in my area."
Genealogy,35yux0,phronimost,2,Thu May 14 20:32:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This is exactly the kind of answer I was looking for.  A lot of what you said makes sense. My ancestors arrived in Canada in the 1780s, shortly after the American Revolution (my ancestor and a couple of his cousins were loyalists).   Where they started out in the 1780s, however, and where their offspring were living in 1851 are two separate places in Ontario. I don't know when they made the move. It's certainly possible that they were early settlers who'd had time and the inclination to make a frame house the hard way.   But as you and /u/SwampRabbit pointed out, they probably built it after there was a sawmill in town. My big clue is that, ten years later, in the 1861 census, my great-great-grandfather is listed as a ""carpenter""--he was one of the ""laborers"" from ten years before. At that point, he is living in a frame home of his own with his young family, and his parents are still living in the original frame home.  Though maybe my great-great grandfather wasn't a very good carpenter, because he left Canada in 1863 and moved his family to Michigan where he built a log cabin. It seems as though he was a farmer from then on, since there's a book from 1883 where the townspeople of his little town in Michigan are profiled, and it gives his occupation as ""farmer"".  Thanks again for informative reply!"
Genealogy,35yux0,phronimost,1 point,Thu May 14 21:00:03 2015 UTC,You're welcome!  Another consideration is whether the person owned his land or was squatting. A squatter might be reluctant to erect a permanent (and more expensive) structure on land to which he had no legal title.
Genealogy,35yux0,thewonderfullavagirl,1 point,Thu May 14 22:27:34 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer : I am not an architecture historian, but I am an architecture student in Canada. I have had a few history classes where we covered building techniques.  In the 1850s, in Canada, a frame structure most likely referred to a Balloon-frame build. These were widespread after nails became readily available (during the industrial rev.).   Balloon-frame structures were similar to current two-by-four structures, but they used continual vertical studs, that would reach 2-3 floors high. (We don't use these anymore because A) less available trees and B) 8m studs are hard to carry home from the hardware store in the back of a toyota) These structures were actually really easy to put up, because you just needed to make sure the pieces were straight and nail them together. (Whereas before nails were used, you would need skilled labour in order to make dove-tail joints and such) Balloon-frame houses were extremely easy and fast to build, especially in rural areas where labour was easy to find. (They had plenty of disadvantages though, especially in cities where fire could easily spread through them, because of the long individual pieces)  You are most definitely correct in saying that these houses would only be built once there was a saw-mill"
Genealogy,35yux0,phronimost,1 point,Fri May 15 01:35:27 2015 UTC,"Balloon framing was certainly popular in the American Midwest in the 1850s, but it would take longer to spread into Canada.   As fast as local sawmills started up and blacksmiths could cut nails for siding, timber framing became the norm in Ontario, and it continued to be well through the nineteenth century.  Balloon framing thrived on capitalization and mass production and was seldom tried in rural Ontario before 1870."

Genealogy,35yux0,SwampRabbit,3,Fri May 15 03:27:50 2015 UTC,"You might check resources about architectural history in your part of the world.    My first thought is that a frame home requires much more labor or technology to cut and plane the pieces of wood than a log cabin. It may have been more expensive to build that way with hand labor or much cheaper to build that way if a sawmill was available since you could get more lumber out of each raw log. It could also have been indication of wealth/class, i.e., an aspirational, fancy, modern style. Or maybe it was simply a function of the technology and machinery available in that town at that time. The first settlers in the area would probably have to build with logs. Later settlers, perhaps with access to a sawmill, would use a sawmill and build frame homes to save on raw material inputs.  <\not an architectural historian>  As for occupation, several families in my tree are pioneer settlers who eventually farmed a lot of acres...but first they had to clear the trees off those acres. My most successful farm family branch started out cutting trees and farming on the stump land until they got around to pulling the stumps. They started a mobile sawmill business and made extra cash by going around to the neighboring farms to cut wood for all the other settlers who were clearing land too. It's entirely possible that your farmers were woodcutters when they first settled there."
Genealogy,35yux0,DanishWonder,2,Thu May 14 18:08:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not the expert you seek, but my guess would be that a framed home would be much cheaper because it uses less lumber.  It probably was also less comfortable because you need to insulate between the frames, so I would assume the house was probably colder/draftier especially in Canada."

The letter is available on a public and free newspaper database, the ancestor presumably wrote and signed it himself, there is nothing controversial in it at all (it's about the town's centenary celebrations) and as for being a private person, he was interviewed in the local paper at around the same time so he obviously didn't object to going public with some things!

Perry Swain  Martha is probably Mattie A., who married William Smith. Here they are in the 1900 Census. She died in 1907, and is buried in Lake View Cemetery, in the same lot as Martha Thompson.  I think this is them in the 1870 Census, with mother Martha given the name of Mark. The children match up well, and the Rachel Hawkins in the household may well be Rachel Aukens. John and Eliza Speed are the first entry on the next page.  I went through the FreeBMD Index, which lists marriages in England, from1840-1850, looking for entries that have Robert Thom(p)son and Martha/Mattie Johns(t)on on the same page. has one entry in which both a Martha Johnson and a Robert Thompson appear on the same page. Checking the Norfolk Registers on FamilySearch shows that this isn't your ancestors' marriage. So Robert and Martha were married either in Scotland, Ireland, or the U.S. There is no findable marriage record for them in Cuyahoga County.  No naturalization record appears for Robert or Martha Thompson in Cuyahoga County. At this time, women automatically took their husband's naturalization status, so you won't find anything for Elizabeth Thompson independently."

Genealogy,35u2a9,somethinginsideme,2,Wed May 13 15:14:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's presumptuous to say they are both illegitimate. Perhaps their fathers died when they were young and they did not know their names. Perhaps they were never asked for their fathers names and the clerk did not have that info when filling out the marriage record. Perhaps only one of the two betrothed was present for the paperwork and just did not know the name of the other's father.  Trees on Ancestry list Benjamin's father as John Eckles Jeffries but I can't 100% confirm that. In fact, I don't trust that because John, wives, and children never appear in Virginia except for Benjamin who somehow lived his whole life in VA while the rest of his family spend their whole lives in Missouri and Nebraska. I think those trees are inaccurate.  Your Ancestry tree has David Dudley as Bertha's father?  Have you attempted to obtain a copy of either one's birth or death certificates? If not, try that first.  Also, since both Benjamin and Bertha died after 1938 one of both of them likely applied for a social security number. You can request a copy of their social security applications here. If they knew their fathers' names, they should be listed on their SS applications."

Most geneaological and historical societies will do searches for a fee if distance is an issue. Church records listing baptism information may have his parents information. Legal and land records may also have useful information. It is likely there is a probate record for his father which would list his mother's name and any siblings.

In the past, they have maintained a list of ""approved"" researchers. And (2) the Boston chapter of the Assoc. of Professional Genealogists, which is just what it sound like. Any researcher who belongs to APG is probably as skilled (and trustworthy in both an academic and business sense) as anyone you're likely to find. (They do not set prices.)  I have to say, though, that $15/hour is extremely low these days for a researcher who is expected to actually be creative in finding information., as opposed to simply looking up local records you've already identified. I don't take clients any longer, but I was getting twice that rate a decade ago. And I was right in the middle of the pack.  You have to think of hiring a reputable genealogist as being the same as hiring any other skilled researcher with special knowledge. These aren't hobbyists --  they're in business. Be prepared to write a check as a retainer. And remember: You're paying for the time and effort spent on the research, NOT for producing the result you may be hoping for. In fact, any supposed genealogist who promises to find the proof for whatever family myth you want to pursue is likely not someone you want to deal with.  I have occasionally hired a colleague in a distant place to hunt up a record for me, simply because it was cheaper, but nearly everyone who gets bitten by the bug wants to climb that courthouse ladder themselves.

Germany has only been a united country since 1871, before that every small little state had its own records and own ways of doing things. For this reason records vary a lot.   While most professionals can research all areas in Germany, it makes the most sense to hire people who are locals to the area. It is simply cheaper if you don't have to pay a researcher from Munich to drive to Hamburg, plus most researchers will usually be quite familiar with local archives and the available records there.   Googling the city and genealogy usually gets some hits.   As for how much info they need depends heavily upon the available records and the place in question.

Pens that had to be dipped in ink could be very messy with the ink if not using proper technique. Also, as someone else in this thread pointed out, writing so much information (like all passengers on a ship, their destinations, points of contact, etc.) could be done much faster in cursive.

Genealogy,35gt0o,Morphiate,2,Sun May 10 05:18:10 2015 UTC,"I think the best place to start is to set out what you already know in some sort of tree form, you can get fancy programs or just sketch it out.  It would be best to find out all you can about your grandparents then their parents then their parents etc to make sure you're searching for the right person (depending on how common their names are).  You can search for births, deaths and marriages. How easy this will be will depend on the state.  For Victorian records you will need to pay just to search for them, other states will just charge you to get a copy of the record. Google the state and bdm and you will find where to search.  If you have the name of the ancestor that was transported then google 'convict records', databases for convict records can also depend on which city they were transported to. Ancestry.com.au has some transportation records, but you may be able to find just as much information as they provide for free.  Some helpful free resources Newspaper records http://trove.nla.gov.au/ National Archives http://www.naa.gov.au/  If you live in a capital city the state library will also be very helpful, and you can get free access to ancestry.com.au. Smaller libraries also have subscriptions to databases but will be less likely to be able to help with specific research.  Also, you may be able to find information on your Aboriginal ancestors, it will be more difficult though. Once again this can depend on your state (I know SA has some resources). Even if you can't find out about your specific ancestor you may be able to find out what happened to the tribes in the area they came from."

Genealogy,35g8v6,wdm42,3,Sun May 10 01:36:00 2015 UTC,"First, some advice: for scanning, always use a high resolution (600 dpi/ppi) and always save an original, untouched copy as a TIF image. Note that some scanning programs have automatic retouching enabled: don't use this. It can result in the loss of features that you won't be able to go back & retrieve unless you scan it again.   Now, once you have the image, I recommend an image editing program called GIMP, which is a free, open-source alternative to Photoshop. The biggest change needed - the fading and discolouration, can probably be solved using curves. The modification that you use on one image, can, by the way, be saved & applied to others."

The will probably specifies that anything sold has to be divided equally among the children.  It doesn't mean that the siblings were squabbling over it, or that they weren't speaking to each other. It's just a legal requirement. It does reveal, however, that at the time of this newspaper, the family doesn't know where Peter is.

I'm a genealogy geek with a background in sewing and costume design.  This is a lovely studio portrait of a Victorian family. The background is fake, probably a painted drop, and is being used to suggest domesticity. Backgrounds and composition of studio portraits in this era tend to be imbued with meaning, and this background would be considered appropriate for a young family.  The Mother: Her back hair has been loosely pulled up into some kind of bun on her crown, and her front fringe is very curly, but short enough to show her forehead.  She is also wearing a basque, which was a tightly fitted bodice with a high collar, slightly high-watered sleeves, and a line of embellishment down the front. They were very trendy in the 1880's, and you see them in many old photos (ladies liked to show them off.) Her skirt is harder to see, as the baby's christening outfit covers much of it, but I can see enough detail to make out the horizontal apron drape. Here is an old photo of a woman in a very similar outfit.  The Father: He's wearing a short, striped sack jacket. It's got somewhat small, narrow lapels, and the bottom is slightly cut away. Only the top button is done (this was to show off your pocket watch and vest.) His trousers are narrow, and are of a different stripe pattern than the jacket. His hair is very short and doesn't appear to have any products in it, and his mustache reaches down to his chin.  The children: The little girls are wearing dark, knee length dresses with large white lace collars, and the boy is wearing a long, warm coat that looks like velvet, buttoned all the way up with a ribbon tied in a bow at his neck. He looks right around breeching age, but without seeing his bottom half its hard to know if he'd been graduated to knickers yet or not.  This photo was definitely taken in the 1880's, and I would date it to the middle of the decade sometime. I would concentrate your search to that time period, maybe 1883 to 1888 or so, and see what you come up with."

Thanks for your input on this little mystery.  Since phronimost's comment a few hours after yours suggests that the photographer was probably only in Cheboygan for, basically, the 1890s, and your information puts their fashions more in the 1880s, I may have to assume the picture is from pretty close to 1890.  I suppose it's not unreasonable to think that they may have been wearing clothes that were a couple years out of style?"
Genealogy,35d6ir,Sergeant_Fancypants,0,Sun May 10 04:27:56 2015 UTC,"These clothes would still have been in style in 1889 or 1890, so the photo definitely could have been taken then. My estimated dates are always just an approximation, and there are a lot of factors in assessing people's clothing styles. If this was a working class family, then they would wear their clothes for longer before replacing them with newer styles, for instance.   I wouldn't call them out-of-style. 1890's Michigan was not the frontier. The women there would have had access to catalogs, magazines and stores showing off the latest fashions, so assuming they were wearing clothes several years out of date just because they were in small town Michigan isn't really accurate. I've only seen that among women who lived out on the frontier, on the fringes of civilization. American women in Victorian times were avid magazine readers---there were numerous magazines that catered to them, showing plates of the latest Parisian fashions, which they would often copy on their sewing machines or order from catalogs.  It's always good to have multiple sources on anything you're researching. Based on their clothing and phronimost's research, I would give the photo a date of circa 1889 or 1890, yeah."
Genealogy,35d6ir,phronimost,2,Sun May 10 05:40:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I wasn't so much assuming that they'd be behind the latest fashions because of their location, but more because, like you said, a working-class family maybe wouldn't always be able to buy new clothes.  Of course, after I posted that, I realized that, first, it was probably a lot more common back then for people to make or at least alter their own clothes, and second, the children's clothes obviously couldn't have been something they'd been wearing for a few years.

Moses was living in Cheboygan in 1890 (when he appeared in the 1890 Census of Union Veterans), in 1896 (when he remarried), and as late as 1898 (when he filed for a patent). He lived in Maine in 1900, but subsequently returned to New Hampshire, where he died in 1901. He was buried in Warner.  So Moses came to Cheboygan and began his studio probably in late 1889 or early 1890, and left Cheboygan about 1898-99.

Genealogy,35a1oe,tejaco,3,Fri May 8 11:02:05 2015 UTC,"Forty years ago, my grandfather told me his mother once received a letter from a woman who was searching for her father.  Seems my great-great-grandfather had two families.  My grandfather was curious and interested in looking into it, but his mother was so upset by the letter that he let it go.  My uncle inherited all the things from that side of the family, so I asked him if I could look through his storage bins for the letter, and this week I FOUND IT.  The details I remembered were not exactly right.  The woman writing addressed it to a brother of my great-great grandfather.  How it came to the daughter-in-law of the man involved I can only guess at, but it looks like a letter she found not one she received.  The sad thing is, it appears that no one answered the letter's writer.  The woman was the only daughter of my great-great-grandfather's first wife.  She writes that she was raised by maternal grandparents until age 7.  She's now 27 and has learned the whereabouts of the uncle she is writing to, and would he please write her back and tell her where her father is?  It could be bigamy, or it could be that her mother died, since she is not mentioned anywhere in the letter.  But in that case, why keep her existence a secret?  Deadbeat dad?  Maybe, but he went on to raise nine children with his second wife.  Anyway, letter found!"

I'm super excited. I have a lot more to do, but I seem to be hitting a wall, so now I'm going to have to try to track down birth records without paying for each and every single one... however, I learned some pretty cool things (and some not so cool things, lol), so I'm pretty proud. I found out my mom had an uncle, who was born and died on the same day in 1923, that no one ever mentioned. I found out that my Grandpa, who claimed to be Cherokee (said his Grandma was full blooded) was full of it. His grandparents were English, Irish and Scottish, not a Native American as far back as the early 1700's that I can find. Sucks, because I've been told my whole life that I'm part Cherokee, and it looks like it isn't true. Found out that I've got a lot more Scottish ancestors than I thought, so I kind of want to do the 23 and me to see what percentages there are. There's also quite a bit of German on my dad's side, though mostly Scottish.   I'm also brand new at this, never thought I'd make it as far as I have. It all started because there was a suggested post on facebook that was a shirt with my last name (maiden) on it, and I wanted to know more about my family name. Next thing I knew, I had a binder half full with notes and scribbles and was elbow deep in names and dates, lol. Now I've got a giant stack of papers printed out for my mom's side of the family, a giant stack of notes about my dad's side, and I'm waiting for my dad to send me a book with some of our family tree in it. I'm related to a war general from the revolutionary war, the lead singer of a metal band, Sir Francis Drake, an author who was in Time Magazine in the 60's and John Muir, the naturalist.   This is seriously awesome. Oh, I also found out that I qualify for the Daughter of The American Revolution, though the person I spoke to wasn't entirely sure how, they knew it was true though because apparently my Grandmother was a part of it, or something? I don't know, lol, and I'm not sure that it's something I'd want to join, but it's cool to know."

Wikitree has really good rules in place for what should be private, and what shouldn't, and they have trusted lists where you can just make certain profiles viewable to people only on that list (there can also be multiple managers of a profile, who can make significant changes).   There are multiple ways to view groups (not only trees, but each profile has clickable links to other immediate family). You can include images (and link multiple profiles to a single image), you can also use free spaces to create a page for something like a significant place, an important family pet, etc.   One of my favorite things is that you can create categories (like if you want to post everyone who came from a specific town or are buried in a specific cemetery).

Start a family tree, and enter as much information as you know about your parents and grandparents.   Then you start searching. Census records are very useful when you are first starting out, look for them. Census records are released to the public after 72 years, so the most recent census you can search in is 1940. See if you can locate your grandparents in the 1940 census. The record should list their age, place of birth, and other useful information.   Family Search's guide for beginners  I would recommend giving this a read, it should help you in getting started."

For myself, I use index cards for individuals and family lists.   In general, you should work backwards chronologically: burial, death, life events (marriage/immigration/military/occupation/education), baptism, birth. That is to say that the information you dig up on the more recent events will give you the clues for the earlier events. Your goal should be to find the date and place of each of these events.  There is good free software out there like ""Gramps"", that is a little complex, but doable.  Other than familysearch, you may need to request documents from churches, cemeteries, and public records offices. Once you have info on a few generations back, you will find that there are a lot of descendants of these people out there, and the job gets easier because someone else has done the work.  Good luck"

You can transfer the DNA test from Ancestry to FamilyTree for a discounted rate as well.   My Grandfather never knew his dad and his mother always told him he died when he was born in a car wreck but would never give his name. He was born in 1925 and he had and older sister who was born in 1923. I have been helping my dad and my grandfather search for over a decade now. He and his sister were both born at home and there was no birth certificates. We did the autosomal DNA test on ancestry a few years ago and got no hits. We all gave up (his mother was mean and both his sister and him had not spoken to her in 50 years and she died in 93 without telling anyone anything. there is a lot more on the mean part but that's another story lol)   On a whim over Thanksgiving I transferred the DNA test to familyTree DNA because my friend who does DNA testing said they were more accurate with their origin results than ancestry. The day after we got the results back a woman contacted me asking why I had her half sister in our tree and who was my grandfather as they matched DNA. Turns out my grandfathers mother in 1925 ran off with a neighbor kidnapping their sister from their dad while pregnant with my grandfather. We surmised that she had claimed to this neighbor that she was pregnant with his kid or might have actually thought that.   My grandfathers father had remarried and had two kids who are still living and we were able to meet with them this past January and give some closer to everyone. A very happy ending!   So I would say do not give up! If the father lived and had children or had siblings who had children you maybe able to make a DNA connection.

You won't know if her father's name is on the certificate until you get it so I'd start there.  Not sure how old your grandmother is but if she was born in the U.S., you might try looking her name in the 1940 census (it's the most recent census available for research here.)  You can look it up on Ancestry.com if you have a subscription but if not, perhaps some here with an active subscription would be kind enough to look it up for you if you gave them the details they'd need.  If she's listed in the census, it might show all the members of her family at the time the census was taken.  If she's on there, It doesn't guarantee that her dad will be listed there with her but it's a good place to check.  I know it's not much but I hope this helps you get started."

I also prefer to check their online catalog before I go so that I have any call numbers I need ready before I get there, that way I can get started on my research as soon as I arrive. They actually have pretty nice digital archives too!  When you arrive, you will have to apply for a card if it's your first time...but it doesn't take very long. You also cannot bring certain items into the archive, but they have lockers you can put your belongings in. Oh, and be sure to bring a pencil because no pens are allowed!

Genealogy,353fpc,Ragleur,2,Wed May 6 21:02:00 2015 UTC,"US.  I'm curious to see if there's a relation between how recently someone immigrated and if a married person is named Mary, due to the similarity between Mary and marry. I'm wondering if it's possible that the name Mary was the most popular female by far for decades partly due to poor English skills of immigrants and laziness of census takers."
Genealogy,353fpc,Ragleur,1 point,Wed May 6 21:05:36 2015 UTC,"So, just so I understand...your theory is that immigrants who were not actually named Mary were put down as ""Mary"" by the census takers because non-English-speaking husbands were trying to say that they were ""married"" to this woman and the census taker misheard this as ""Mary""?  And that this is the only reason why Mary is thought to have been so popular at that time?"
Genealogy,353fpc,Ragleur,1 point,Wed May 6 21:11:59 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. I'm not saying it's the only reason it was so popular, but it might have made it seem more popular then it actually was. I'm just curious if there's anything behind the idea."
Genealogy,353fpc,brianjz,4,Wed May 6 21:17:46 2015 UTC,"I mean, if I'm being honest here, I don't think it makes a whole lot of sense.  I mean, if a husband who only spoke a little English were trying to say that he was married to this woman, he would probably say ""She is my wife"" rather than ""We are married.""  And he would certainly introduce her by name.  Besides, it's not just in the US that Mary was always extremely common, but also in England and Ireland.  Not to mention Marie in France, Maria in Italy/Spain...I think it's just due to the fact that there simply aren't a whole lot of female figures in Christianity (there are only 188 named women in the entire Bible, and most of them are obscure) and that Mary is by far the most prominent.  But, if you wanted to pursue this research in spite of all this, here's what I would do.  • Buy subscription to Ancestry.com  • Choose a census. (Let's say 1900)  • First name: Mary  • Immigration year: 1899  • Note number of results.  • Repeat with every preceding year.  • Also, search ""Born in: USA""  • Note number of results."

You might sort through them to figure out how many of them you can trace (Ehrcke/Ihrcke). The c in Mecklenburg actually makes the vowel a long vowel (MAY-klen). The extra c in Ehrcke/Ihrcke probably does the same thing. Normally in high German, a vowel plus a double consonant makes a short vowel, but Mecklenburg is weird that way :) Also, Ida is a fairly common German name, so I wouldn't stress too much about variations on that."
Genealogy,352l9g,gimmebackmyfamily,2,Wed May 6 20:21:47 2015 UTC,"Is it possible she had a German name like ""Marie Dorothea X"", and went by Mary for sometime and Dora later in life?    Yes, but for this you'd need to find her baptism record.    Parchim, Mecklenburg   Quite a few records from this area are available online. I am not familiar with research in the area at all, so I am sketchy on the details.    Johann Friedrich Ihrke   That is the most likely variant. Johann almost always comes first. ""Fritz"" is short for Friedrich. A boy/man might be called ""Fritz"" all his life, he might even sign with ""Fritz"" and being named Fritz in many documents. But his official baptism, marriage and death records will almost always say ""Friedrich"".    Could Ida have been a ""Frieda""?   Ida and Frieda are different names. Unlikely. Ida is a very old German name that is actually becoming popular again.   http://www.beliebte-vornamen.de/6505-ida.htm   Another wrinkle: looking through the 1880 census, I found another Ihrke family in the same area (Sauk), headed by John and Augusta Ihrke. John appears to be a few years younger than Fred/Fritz--perhaps they are brothers?   For this you'd have to check out the original baptism records. Census records where they live close together or travelling on the same ship would be clues that you could find state-side, but confirmation can only come from the original churchbook records.   (In the case of my relatives, I know that two families are related despite having different lastnames - they travel on the same ship, come from neighboring villages, they live together as neighbors for years and I know that the one family had a set of cousins with the other last name, but until I can find the marriage record of a Carl Friedrich born in 1826 to a Sophia born in 1826 and the birth record of their son born 1856 in Germany, I just cannot prove the connection! It does not help that the two names are very common in the area that I am researching.)   While the name Ihrke is not that common, it seems to be a dime a dozen in the area where your ancestors come from.   http://www.verwandt.de/karten/absolut/ihrke.html  http://www.verwandt.de/karten/relativ/ihrke.html  So please be careful about jumping to conclusions."

Also, it might be helpful to track down marriage and death records of Fritz Sr.'s younger and older kids to see who the mother is listed as -- maybe there's a discrepancy there between Mary and Dora."

Information about whether there are matches, and how close each is, is available to anyone who does testing through Sorenson, FTDNA, Ancestry, GEDMatch, or 23andMe.  That is the whole point of how those services work -- you wouldn't submit a sample and then not be told if you had any relatives unless you had a warrant!  While the other 4 only give you a way of contacting the match (and their name if they offer it), FTDNA also gives you the person's name and email address without contacting the person via the in-site email, though you can choose to be ""anonymous"", though hardly anyone does since people want to be contacted by relatives since that's what they paid for.  So, in my interpretation, the police in this case were treated the same as any other customer.  So, sure, the title is then technically correct, but so is, ""Ancestry.com and every other personal DNA service caught sharing DNA matching data with their customers because that's what they were paid to do.""

I'm fully willing to accept if he is not my biological grandpa, but I wanted to check. If it were an issue with how he performed the test, I would expect his ancestry information to look off.

Edit: Here is the story about my uncle. I don't know much. My grandma was seeing a soldier and got pregnant with my uncle. My uncle's baby book says that his bio-grandparents came to the hospital to see him after his birth. After that, nothing is known about where the family went or what happened. My grandma had tight lips. I don't know specifically when my grandparents met. I will have to ask. They got pregnant with my dad, and married while pregnant with him.  If there was any indiscretion or lying, I wouldn't put it on my grandpa. My grandmother's family had a lot of unknown or unclaimed in the mix. My grandmother herself didn't know anything about her own father. Both boys look a lot like their mom, and the girls look like their father. (Not that looks alone prove anything.)  The kids found out about the adoption by going through paperwork to take for themselves when they were adults. My grandpa felt horrible about hiding it from the family when the kids were young. I worked for a PI in a previous life, so he asked me to take over the tree and to find my uncle's bio dad. That sincerity and honesty that he showed is why I don't believe he's telling stories.

Genealogy,34r8gr,BlankPages,7,Sun May 3 21:32:45 2015 UTC,"It seems however that Ancestry nonetheless did violate their agreement, via Sorenson:   Sorenson promised volunteers their genetic data would only be used for “genealogical services, including the determination of family migration patterns and geographic origins” and would not be shared outside Sorenson.   By doing DNA testing for law enforcement, and checking those results against the database, they, without question, used the DNA data in their database outside of the stated limitations of its purposes. The subsequent warrant is immaterial to that question.  Second, Ancestry has failed to introduce adequate safeguards, such as encryption by an outside contractor, which would prevent them from being able to disclose such information to law enforcement; that's their moral duty to their customers."
Genealogy,34r8gr,MurphysLab,4,Sun May 3 22:08:29 2015 UTC,The fact that the data is obtainable is why people should be concerned.  So law enforcement follows proper procedures to get that genetic information.  Great.

Out of respect for others, we should refrain from providing any personal DNA data to any government-accessible (including by warrant!) database.  I doubt that any genealogist, let alone the majority, actually obtain informed consent from anyone from whom they solicit a DNA sample; they themselves do not fully realize the potential consequences of their actions in the current legal environment.   And most important, it's why WE, as a GENEALOGY COMMUNITY, should work together to get the rules and the systems used changed, for the sake of those already placed at risk and for the future."

Genealogy,34onp1,catsformydowry,3,Sun May 3 02:53:25 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a perfect case for some DNA genealogy, and specifically for Gedmatch and their Lazarus tools.   First, if you can get anyone from the adopted children's lines tested, along with descendants of the children of their adopted parents you would get some answers pretty quick. Next you would want to track down descendants of the other two possible families from the passed down stories and start doing more comparisons. If Vernon had many children I would recommend having as many tested as you can afford.  This is not a cheap and easy option, but you may well get lucky and find that some people in these lines have already been tested. My recommendation would be to start on a site like ancestry and start messaging anyone who has the adopted boys or their adopted or suspected parents and ask if they or anyone in their immediate family has been tested and start running comparisons on Gedmatch (which again is free and you can do even if you yourself have not had a dna test done."

Genealogy,34m27z,hepatitisburger,1 point,Sat May 2 11:00:15 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll bite. I took an ancestry DNA test as my father was adopted. I've written to the Orphanage he was adopted from 'hours after birth' and hope for more info. That happened earlier in the week and they should get started mid-week on the request.  I've got 2 DNA matches of 'High Probability' of being 1st-2nd cousins. I've reached out to the first cousin match (no response) and got nowhere so I moved on to second cousin (ongoing communication). Turns out 2nd cousin is daughter of 1st cousin who isn't 'good with computers'. We've messaged back and forth and ended with the dreaded 'no one remembers'.  Considering my father passed ~18 months ago at the age of 65, it's likely those that knew much have passed too. Or he's a well kept secret baby.  Moving forward, should I just hope the Orphanage search pans out or keep gently hammering the only lead I have by trying to link relatives proximity to the orphanage area, sharing photos etc and hoping it jogs a memory?"
Genealogy,34m27z,T1theinfamous,2,Sat May 2 15:46:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly I would try and get a hold of your cousin's family tree.  A second cousin match on ancestry was one of the only ways I was able to find my mom's birth family.  The first thing you should do is try and determine which side of 1st cousin's family you're related through.  Try and find other matches of yours who belong to the same family as 1st cousin.  For example, if 1st cousin's mom was named Susan Kimbrough and from Page County, VA and you match several other Kimbroughs from northern Virginia you would probably be related through his mother's side.  By doing this you'll be able to pin down exactly which family branches you share.  Next you'll want to do the same thing for spouses of 1st cousins' aunts and uncles.  For example if Susan's brother James' wife Barbara O'Bannon was from NYC and you also match several O'Bannons from NYC and Ireland than James and Barbara would likely be your paternal grandparents.  Also, don't give up on the orphanage.  Even if they can only give you non identifying information (which was the case with my mom), that info can help you nail down which of 1st cousin's relative you are descended from.  Edit: Oh yeah, also try and use uncommon surnames, not anything like Smith, Johnson, or Jones."

People spend years trying to prove connections.  It could be that you can do it in days, but to suggest that mapping out the family trees of two different people from scratch is something that should generally only take a day is just silly."
Genealogy,34kc8r,robspeaks,2,Sat May 2 04:18:01 2015 UTC,"For you and your roommate to be related ""by blood,"" you have to share a common ancestor.  Trace your own direct ancestors in the area of that cemetery back as far as you can, and then start a new tree at ancestry.com that begins with your roommate and goes back through his grandparents.  If you can get both of you back a century or so without any common ancestor, then you aren't very related.  If you want to spend some time and money, you can each get a DNA autosomal test, upload the results to gedmatch.com, and do a one-to-one comparison of the results.  That free site will tell you if you are likely related and how closely.  If you can trace both you and your roommate's direct ancestors and none of them are the same, you could still be related by marriage somewhere, but that gets messy enough that I don't have any systematic advice for you on how to look for that."
Genealogy,34kc8r,tejaco,2,Fri May 1 22:48:36 2015 UTC,"So cemeteries are very interesting.  You get people buried in places aren't related and sometimes it takes some work to find how people are related.  I have a cousin who had an ancestor who was a jeweler in New Orleans.  The jeweler's got a nice tomb in one of the beautiful old cemeteries.  Buried in the tomb are the jeweler, his sister, his wife, his sister's husband, his wife's second husband and his parents, his son-in-law, his son-in-law's mother, and his son-in-law's aunt's husband.  (But not the aunt!)  So just because everyone's in a ""family"" cemetery doesn't mean that they're all blood relation.   The problem is that genealogy is detailed detective work and it's not often quick.  You only did one surname branch.  It's very possible that you're related through some of the names that don't get expressed when you only trace the male line back.   Least work? DNA test both on the same service (in this case, I'd go for one with chromosomal mapping like 23andme) and then compare results.   There's a chance (which increases as the generations in-between increase) that a paper family tree match will not show up in a DNA match.   I do this sort of trace all the time on DNA matches when I'm trying to find the connection.  For my local situation, I dig up obituaries from the newspaper.  They're indexed and available with a quick search.   You could also take it in the opposite direction and start with the cemetery and try to figure out how everyone buried there is related.  Pull it up on Find-a-Grave (or add it, if it's not there)  Document the names and dates and connect people together. Who maintains the cemetery? Do you have a local funeral home which makes arrangements for people to be buried? Can you go to them and ask for burial records?"
Genealogy,34kc8r,j-uno,3,Fri May 1 23:19:16 2015 UTC,"WikiTree is the answer. You would need to include your tree, along with all of the details that you have, to-date, to back up the connections that you make; likewise, entering your friend's family tree as far back as it's able to go. As you go further back, each tree will connect with the Global Family Tree. Once that happens, WikiTree has a special tool which can check to see if there is a blood relationship. Here's an example of it in action: Beyoncé and Ellen are 10th cousins. (French Canadian family trees go way back, so there tend to be lots of connections!)  Also you can obtain additional records from FamilySearch.org... lots of other free stuff too, depending on where you live."

Generally someone would say their name was Nora/Norah and the person writing would put the name down however they thought it was spelled.

So you very likely have Jewish heritage.  However, three percent is too small to attempt an estimate of how far back you would have to go to find it.  It could be a great-great-grandparent, or it could be much, much further back, beyond the scope of modern genealogy.  There is no way to narrow down which branches of your tree it could have come from without testing relatives.  Also, I'm not sure what you mean by Celtic blood.  Are you referring to the 22 percent Irish?  That is far too high a percentage to attribute to vikings."

Genealogy,34gd3o,whiteraven4,1 point,Fri May 1 17:55:52 2015 UTC,"All I'll say is that it would be highly unusual for someone without relatively recent Irish heritage to come up as 22 percent Irish.  The category is specifically Irish, not Celtic.  The way the analysis works is that groups of living people are tested and DNA signatures unique to certain populations are identified.  That means DNA designated as Irish is almost exclusively found in people with Irish heritage.  Ancestry used to have a broader British and Irish category, but their research progressed enough that they created a separate Irish category.  My heritage is almost entirely Irish and it checks out in my case.  If it was half that percentage, then maybe it could be very distant.  But the simplest explanation for 22 percent would be that you have a grandparent with mostly Irish heritage.  I'm not saying that's definitely the case, just that it's the easiest explanation."

This gradually went on, letter-by-letter, from the early 1900s (after immigration) until around the start of World War II, and then they finally stopped altering the name.  As far as I can tell, they didn't make these changes through any formal process (it appears that the government may not have even cared all that much at the time either--at least, I suppose, not until all those federal government social programs started being offered during the Great Depression, and then the services that were being provided needed to be tracked in some way).  These ancestors only changed a few individual letters of the surname though and not the name as a whole.  However, another wing of my parent's family outright changed their last name to something completely different right around the start of World War II, and they did it through their county's probate court to make it official.

Genealogy,34btox,Puggy31,18,Thu Apr 30 07:43:43 2015 UTC,"My big tip is this: Map addresses in Google maps. Just c&p the address from whatever document you find it in. You don't need the zip, just the house number, street, and the city/state/country depending. Paste it into Google and search, the maps should be the first thing that comes up. Look at both the street view, and the big overhead view of the surrounding area.  Some things I have been able to learn doing this:    I've been able to identify houses in unknown old photos, which helps me identify people and likely dates of the photos.  I've been able to figure out why a person was born in a certain place---that town was a bit bigger and had the only hospital, that's most likely why she traveled there to give birth. I've been able to figure out where the current county seat is, so I could travel there to go through old records for a small town that no longer exists.  I've been able to see patterns of marriage and settlement, which before the modern era were usually heavily influenced by available roads and trails between different areas. One family I studied, all their children had married and moved to the same town, about 40 miles away from where they grew up. They had no family there. Looking at a map, I noticed there was a major highway between them that followed a waterway. Then, looking at old maps, I saw that the waterway was a major travel corridor in the 1800's. The family probably traveled there regularly for trading and for social get-togethers.   In other words, it just helps me to deepen my understanding of a family that I am learning about. Geography influences a lot of our lives."

I made a visual representation of everybody on census list, much easier to keep track of people and notice things than by doing it all in your head. In the particular area at least it was normal for census to list unrelated people as a hosehold e.g. farmer and all the farmhands, plus they don't pay much attention to women.- a total mess. I made a diagram using genoPro (noting this because I figured that using software rather than pen and paper would make it less messy and this particular one also allows to find people easier than image processor would) - for each census I wrote down all people living at a household, if they had moved to a different household I wrote down what's going there as well, if people in same household were related I made a family tree. Then I circlead each household/year situation and drew arrows to where each individual reappears at the next census. I noticed this way that in one case a person I assumed was just a servant was acctualy farmer's daughter who had returned to live with parents after death of her husband and that her sister had moved to household of my other ancestor where the only person with that name and age was ancestor's wife meaning that my greatgrandparents actualy were cousins.

Both FamilySearch and Ancestry.com offer guides on first steps (and next steps). I'm sure the other big genealogy sites do as well.  Whatever system you choose to record your tree (be it paper, a website like FamilySearch or Ancestry, a program like Family Tree Maker or Gramps, or even something else entirely) the first step is always to record absolutely everything you already know. Names, connections, any dates for birth/marriage/death as well as other life events, any and all locations... Looking at US ancestors the next step after that often includes looking at the US Census. The last one released to the public was 1940."

Here in Dec 1925's anniversary notice they have 5 kids living (not named).  In the 1931 obit I posted there are still 5 kids is a decent estimate for death dates. I think FWH was dead by Dec 1925.

The letter confirms that he had grown up in the Pacific Northwest, and might explain why he felt restless living in the East and headed back west soon after.   The game is scarce in this part of the country—even the cotton tails.   There is better hunting and fishing in Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana than most any states now, and a man will always find a hearty welcome out there, too. Most of the farmers have all their land posted down here and there has been so much stuff destroyed by more sportsmen, that it is hard for a man to get a permit to hunt on it.   The wife listed on his World War I Draft Registration Card, Mertie Smith Hale, was living with her sister in 1930—supposedly still married, but without her husband. She was buried here, again with no husband in sight. I think her husband abandoned her around 1922-23, headed west for some good hunting, and ended up at the altar again in Golden, Colorado on Christmas Eve, 1923.

Jones who died in 1932 and was buried in Manchester. She was living in Lexington, Kentucky in 1920, and with her lived a nephew Francis Jones, born about 1901 in Ohio. This was evidently Frank Martin Jones, the son of Oras Jones.  I found Florence's estate file here, and it establishes that Oras Jones and his brother William were her nephews, and that Sarah (Jones) Knowles was her niece. They are listed among her next-of-kin here. This document also lists some half-siblings, which helps us find Melinda (Thompson) Jones' second family in 1880. Her second husband was Caleb Jones."

It's nice because you don't have to delete relationhips between people, which can take a while.  Searching like this also will let you see right off if anyone else is already researching that person.  What I do to make separate unrelated families all appear on the same tree is: that I go to the ""search"" button. It is the third button from the left on the top of the screen (all the buttons on the top of the screen are grey). Put your cursor over that ""search"" button and a new menu will appear. I select ""search all records."" Then I put enough info in the search box that I know it will bring up the person I want. Tons of records then come up on the next screen. I select a record that I know goes with my person. The new record info comes up and there is are two green ""save"" buttons (at top and bottom of screen). I hold my cursor over one of those ""save"" buttons and a new menu opens. It asks if you want to save this record to ""someone in your tree"" or to the ""shoebox."" I select ""someone in your tree."" A new page shows up called ""Attach record to someone in your tree."" Scroll down to select the tree you want to save the person to. Now look for the green writing in the bottom right-hand corner that says, ""add this to a new person."" New screen comes up with the person's name and info in it (you have to select if the person is living or deceased). Click the orange save button at the bottom left hand corner, and it will save that person to your tree. Do you need to start a brand-new tree for these people? Then before you do all that, go to the main screen and select ""family trees"" from the grey buttons at the top of the screen. Scroll down until it says ""Start a new tree."" You need to fill in at least one person who will be on this tree. At the bottom of that screen it says in orange ""continue"" or ""cancel."" Select continue. Now it will ask for info about the dad. Add some data here if you want. Select ""Continue."" Finally, after all these steps, it will ask you to name the tree. Select save and you are done.

That way if anyone contacts me about someone on that tree, I can say I really don't know much about that family--things could be wrong, but this is my best bet.  Sometimes I get feedback from the people I am searching for to let me know I am on the right track, other times not.  Since I am not an actual descendant who has family lore to fall back on, I could still be making mistakes.  I link all the outside data from Family Search, newspapers, etc. that other Reddit searchers find.  This also means I have less people on my own trees.

Ultimately, it is wrong to think of Ancestry as a ""tree"". It's really just a database of information that  GUI appears tree-like.  And for me, I find that the easiest way to create new unrelated people in trees is to just have a ""master person"" and attach the new person as a spouse.

The one on the left has a much higher hairline and the more bony face of a young adult. On the hairline alone, I'd say the one on the right is younger.

What you see on the upper right is the overlay, and the bottom left is what that final adjustment looked like.   The nose lines, mouth lines and hairline match up pretty close, but even then, the older photo, which should be of him younger, has a higher hairline than the newer photo. The chin can narrow quite a bit when a person smiles, the nose can scrunch a little and ears can raise. That said, the ears just seem much flatter in the younger picture, even accounting for a more left-facing angle.   I would say it is close, even to the point of being related, however, based on these pictures, the things that would suggest to me that they are not the same person would be the shape of the ears, the higher hairline on the younger picture, the shape of the eyes and the distance between the corners of eye pits across the brow.   I think there would need to be more pictures of the same person from different angles to see the variations, but if I was in a court of law and had to make a decision, based only on these two photos - based on what I see here, I would say they are not the same person."

Genealogy,33omyx,Sergeant_Fancypants,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:39:59 2015 UTC,"There's certainly a resemblance, mainly in the lower mouth/chin area. Where it was taken could be significant to the styles of the time it was taken. It could be general like, New York, Montana, London, Germany, etc. That way you can look up other shots from the decade and see if you see any similar styles. The collar of the shirt isn't consistent with most styles from the late 1800s, so that could push it further out, but it certainly looks older than the profiles from the 30's."

Genealogy,33omyx,Sergeant_Fancypants,2,Fri Apr 24 18:29:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not good with facial features but I can date the photo on the right for you.  He is wearing a shirt with a brightly striped pattern and a soft, attached spread collar. With it he has a striped bow tie, and over it he is wearing a leather jacket. His hair has been given a deep side part and slicked back with some Brilliantine, and then his natural curls have puffed up the top a slight bit, and the sides have been combed back at an angle.   So first thing: You've been given a wrong date. This picture is not from the 1890's or 1900's. The brightly striped shirt with the soft collar date it to after WWI.  Second thing: His totally clean shaven face---even the sideburns have been buzzed off---was a style from the 1920's. They associated it with health and sanitary hygiene. His distinctive hairstyle also dates it to the 20's. And the leather jacket puts it most likely in 1927 or later. Charles Lindbergh, after making his famous flight across the Atlantic that year, was photographed by Time Magazine in a leather jacket, which started a HUGE fad among men.  I would date this photograph to between maybe 1927 and 1933."

Genealogy,33lgly,bexxy27,7,Thu Apr 23 14:11:51 2015 UTC,"Most marriage records are not online.  If the marriage was in Oklahoma, you will likely have to contact the county it occurred in.  That said, Oklahoma didn't become a state until 1907, so I don't know what kind of coverage exists for old marriage records.  As for the California index, it clearly refers to one marriage, not two.  You can see that the registration number is the same.  The bride obviously had two names, possibly because she had been married before, and they wanted to make sure she was indexed under both of them.  You can find other examples of this on the same page.  As for why an already married couple were getting married again, maybe they split up and got back together.  I've seen that before."

One of the records is her maiden name, the other is her married name.  As /u/robspeaks mentions, this could be a remarriage of the same couple (hence why her name was already McLain).  Can you confirm Martha's maiden name was Pate?  Perhaps they were married in 1902 and this was a renewal of their vows for their 50th wedding anniversary?  If that was the case, you may want to check the newspapers in Santa Barbara for that time.  They may have mention of a 50th wedding anniversary put into the newspaper."

Genealogy,33kiy9,coalshinconfidential,5,Thu Apr 23 06:55:44 2015 UTC,"Geraldine was living with parents Floyd and Maud in San Francisco in 1930, Berkeley in 1920 and in Placer County in 1910. This last census says that she was the stepdaughter of Floyd E. Townsend, and that her mother had married once before. It says that Maud and Floyd had married in about 1908-09.  Here is a 1908 marriage record for Floyd Everett Townsend and Maud Jewell. Floyd's World War I Draft Registration Card confirms his middle name, and gives the same address as the 1920 census.  Here's a 1902 marriage record for Sam R. Jewell and Maud Townsend. Maud's death record confirms that her maiden name was Townsend. She and Floyd are buried in Colma, California.  Getting back to Geraldine, we find a death record for a Geraldine Jewell Boyd, born 6 Feb. 1901 in California, died 3 Mar. 1995 in San Francisco. (The Social Security Death Index gives the year of her birth as 1903, which is more likely.) The surnames of both parents are given as Townsend, indicating that her stepfather Floyd was listed on the record rather than her biological father. Geraldine is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, Colma. A Frederick A. Boyd is buried in the same cemetery and, based on the similarity and proximity of their grave markers, as well as records such as this, was quite possibly her husband."

That led to the other census records, which led to the marriage records, etc.  The key is to know how much or how little information to put in the search form. Put too much information (or restrict the search to ""Exact Matches"") and some relevant results may be omitted. Put too little and you'll be swamped with too many results. There's a bit of an art to it—especially when researching names that are easily and often misspelled. In this case, the names were all spelled correctly, so everything fell into place quickly."

I have a separate drive on my PC for genealogical research which is mirrored to Dropbox. I have a directory of folders listed A, B, C, D, etc. and inside the appropriate alphabetized folder are the surnames I'm working with (some of the surnames are nested for various reasons, like to document people who are not blood relations but are connected to a specific surname or families from other marriages not in my lineage).   Every person who I acquire  any documents for gets their own folder under their surname. I use a standard naming convention with their birth and death date right in the file name so there is no confusion about people with the same names generations apart. So death certificates, birth certificates, baptismals, service records, civil records, photos, etc. all follow the same naming convention. In every folder there is a .txt file with notes. Anything and everything that gets put up on Ancestry or goes into FTM goes into their respective folder and any notes or conjecture goes into their .txt file.

When a narrative is ""complete,"" I just save to pdf and attach to the person in the database. This information can always still be updated or changed when needed."

Genealogy,33dvob,Betwixting,3,Tue Apr 21 19:30:54 2015 UTC,How do you organize your information within Evernote?
Genealogy,33dvob,Puggy31,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:04:27 2015 UTC,"One way I use Evernote is like index cards. You can have separate ""notebooks"" full of totally searchable notes or cards. I have one book for families in which I keep all the info that cannot be stored in FTM or that cannot be searched in FTM. Another notebook is for genealogy resources. It will hold documents and can take audio notes. I suggest downloading and playing with Evernote to see if you like it. Easy to use and very intuitive. And it uses cloud storage so you can take all your info with you wherever you are researching."

Genealogy,33dvob,lilmonstertruck,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:04:54 2015 UTC,"I use a combination of things: keeping properly named files organized into folders, Gramps, and OneNote.  I keep digital copies of all records (birth certificates, marriage records, pictures of gravestones, pictures, etc.), organized in my Genealogy folder on my hard drive, that I also have backed up to Copy (cloud storage). Within my Genealogy folder, I have 2 folders, Mother's side and Father's side. Then, within each of those, I have folders for: Birth Records, Census Records, Death Records, Immigration Records, Marriage Records, Notes, and Photographs. Within those, I have the appropriate individual files, each named (in general) in the following way: Lastname, Firstname - date - description. Description depends on the type of file, like Certificate of Birth, Death Certificate, etc. Certain files, like census records and others, are named slightly differently. I organized my files this way because I felt that it would be easiest for me to keep everything organized, and to find the exact file I was looking for. When I set up this file storage system, I knew that that I was going to use genealogy software as well, and that I only needed to store the files in a logical way that would allow me to easily find a particular file I wanted.  I also use Gramps. If you haven't tried it recently, you might want to try it again. Just in the short time I've been using it, there have been upgrades that have improved usability, for me. It does have a bit of a learning curve, but only because it is so complete and full-featured. Everything is pretty intuitive, I have found. So, I use Gramps to take care of keeping track of individuals, families, events, places, source information, and links to the files I mentioned above. I also have my Gramps database backed up to cloud storage, and I make sure to make backups when upgrading to the next version of Gramps.  To help me keep track everything, I use OneNote. I have a Genealogy notebook with general notes, tips, to do lists, etc. and I also have other notebooks that keep track of specific families I'm trying to research or piece together properly. This is helpful to keep track information that other people have posted online, but that doesn't have documentation (no birth records, marriage records, etc.) to back it up. I don't trust it enough to put it into Gramps, but I can put it in OneNote to keep track of it, so that I have hints that might help to point me in the right direction so I can find proof."

When I realized my grandmother was born 3 months before her half brother it really hit home.  And that both ladies had at least two children after my grandmother was born.  But that was in 1933.  Women at that time didn't have a lot of choices.  And they had moved away from all the family.  My great grandmother was 6 when her mom and step dad got married.  So it wasn't like she was a teenager and already turning into a woman, which is creepy but when you think that a lot of girls were getting married at 16 or 17 then not as bad as it would be today.

Honestly, as a woman, the whole subject can be a little disconcerting, even without the possibility of incest. They married so painfully young, often to men decades older. And they had so many kids. It's one thing to know it abstractly; it's another to actually see the dates and calculate the ages and imagine a face, y'know? I've already run into one ancestor with (at least) 14 children— which he managed by having three wives in rapid succession. They'd have a bunch of kids and die, and he'd immediately marry another. The last wife was only 12 years older than the first kid. Who knows, maybe they were happy. But… yeah. :/"

Spurred by your suggestions, I backed up a little and start searching sideways, which got me some more info. Some useful, some confusing. Mostly confusing, actually— these documents are a mess! (At this point, it’s not so much a brick wall blocking my path as a giant pile of rubble.) But I know a lot more now than I did before. For the curious, here’s where I am now:   The birth registration listing Jacob as Alice’s father is in fact a clerical error! /u/gregbard nailed it! Turns out there are two versions: an original (with serious water damage), and a copy. I can make out enough of the original to see that Jacob was actually the informant (witness). He wrote: “Jacob Miller, present at birth, father”— meaning Kate’s father, presumably. Looks like they just messed up when they transcribed it (the “father” box is right next to the “informant” box, and Jacob didn’t quite stay inside the lines). The box for the actual father is blank on the original. So that solves that! It’s very possible that Alice’s father was some other relative. I should have considered that, but I got stuck on Jacob because of the birth registration snafu. Anyway, Kate had 4 brothers and 3 brothers-in-law. And I've found 5 uncles so far (her granddad was prolific!). I’m still working on cousins, but that seems less likely… would that that really have been so scandalous back then? Worth whispering about?   At any rate, it finally soaked in that no, whoever it was is probably not going to be recorded in official docs as such. But who knows, I might find a clue somewhere along the way. Upside, there’s a ton of records! Downside, they’re confusing as hell. This parish seems to have been populated by three huge families who intermarried all over the place and bred like rabbits, so everyone's got the same last names, and the same given names variously remixed. (In fact, turns out Kate’s married and maiden names were the same. Hat tip to /u/OxfordDictionary!)   So… yeah. It’s going to take some time to straighten it all out.

Genes we inherit from our forebears are a grab-bag, and it's possible that you didn't ""grab"" any of the NA genes.  When we say things like, ""he's got his grandfather's nose"" that can be actually true, and if you didn't get that nose, you can't necessarily pass it on. (This is a dopey example, but) I have to agree that to get none whatsoever of your maternal grandfather's genes seems unlikely, but what if he was himself only half NA?  Or a quarter?  Since he was adopted, I assume his actual parentage is unknown.  Of course, your grandmother was supposed to have NA ancestry as well, so it's quite surprising if you dodged all of those genes, but I suppose it could happen.  Get a sibling tested.  OTOH, for some (possibly romantic?) reason, people do seem to like to claim Native American ancestry, and it often isn't true.

Genealogy,33ea6y,UnDire,12,Tue Apr 21 23:13:06 2015 UTC,"It is incredibly common among both white and black Americans, actually. Many, many families have the story of the Indian ancestor, usually very vague. It's sometimes called Cherokee Princess Syndrome. ""You know, Great-Grandma was a Cherokee Princess"" being the stereotypical story.  Both sides of my family had versions of it. I haven't done DNA testing (yet), but I've done years of genealogy work, and I have never found a single piece of evidence even suggesting someone was NA. When I was in Oklahoma a few years back searching for documents, I learned that this is actually a huge part of Okie culture, so common that it's become a humorous cliche. Newspapers made fun of Elizabeth Warren for the whole Indian ancestry thing, but she is from Oklahoma, and apparently most Oklahomans just shrugged their shoulders; they all have those stories in their family tree.  Have you ever heard of an old pre-code movie named ""Call Her Savage'? It's a perfect illustration of the racial stereotypes people had about Indians. Basically, the main character is this Texas heiress; her wealthy father cannot control her. She runs around with lots of men, including non-white men (specifically a handsome Indian dude that works for her father), drinks, smokes, gets into catfights. She runs off eventually, marries badly, is abandoned, nearly turns to prostitution, and is permanently disowned by her father.  Eventually she returns to Texas to her mother's deathbed confession that the wealthy asshole daddy isn't her real father; her real father is an Indian. This explains why she is so 'untamable and wild', and allows her to go back to the handsome Indian dude, who has always loved her, and live with him happily ever after.  This idea of Indians being wild and free and unable to live in proper white society was very common. Can you see why many people would want to claim some of that in their family tree? Back in the day, it kind of gave them an excuse for bad behavior. It was also a convenient excuse for white people with darker complexions---being part NA sounded more romantic than being part black or part Jewish or something. These 'explanations' get passed down through the generations, and they become part of people's identities, which is why so many people have trouble letting go of them, like your parents. My Grandfather was the same way, he insisted he was part Cherokee til the day he died and refused to believe anything to the contrary.   Your experience is a lot more common than you have any idea."

So I know it's not always a 50/50 split between the parents, and so I'm inclined to believe that my oldest got more DNA from my husband, then our middle daughter is likely 50/50 or close to it, and then my son is more me than my husband.

Also, addresses get listed separately sometimes even though they're the same when I've entered them using a slightly different format (e.g. if one source gives both town and county, but another just gives the town), which can be frustrating, but is understandable.  Everything that's listed as a ""residence"" is searchable (and very helpful in getting an overview of which family members lived in the same house, for example.

Garza revolution (1891-1893) and his precursor Francisco Ruiz Sandoval; I have stumbled upon Dionicio Martinez who was at the time a well known ""bandido"" of Webb County and Northern Coahuila and Tamaulipas. So far I have built up a chronology spanning from 1888 to 1914. I ignore if it could be the same person, in any case that Dionicio Martinez ended up taking over Monclova Coahuila in June 1914 from the Carrancistas forces but not as a Villista, but as a major for Huerta's Federal army. I've also seen the El Tordillo conexion with a birthdate of 1868, which matches a comment in an article where he is described as ""having killed already 4 men before the age of 18"" about 1888. I don't know if it's the same person, but I can give you the biopic I've built so far (In Spanish but I can translate it to English). Most of the data I gathered from The Laredo Times & Galveston Daily News, at newspaper.com; other sources (I unfortunately have no access to) would be the District Courts of Webb County or Spanish speaking newspapers of the era (late 1890s early 1900s) such as La Voz de Nuevo Leon (Monterrey, NL); El Duende (Nuevo Laredo, Tam).. if this is the same person; hope this helps!"

There are several other tribes in the modern Tennessee area that could have been his heritage, including the Yuchi. If you look at a language map (use the Smithsonian one), you'll see that Tennessee is largely blank, because the tribes who lived there were mostly exterminated before contact was even made. So he or his family could be a survivor from any number of un-named tribes - particularly because they lived on a road. They could even be from one of the Carolina or Virginia tribes, forced west, and then stopped the first time nobody was looking. It's possible that the connection to his SC wife is actually from a connection to SC for himself.  As an example: My own aboriginal ancestry comes from Virginia, but many of them fled the civil war. Two brothers went through TN and ended up in TX. My own direct ancestor ended up in NW Illinois. Some others scattered to Ohio.  As far as what you can do now, there are several things.   Check any available ""Free Negro"" lists for TN or AK. Aboriginal people were routinely listed as ""Black"" or ""Negro"" and marked as ""Free Negro"" and thus had to be tracked on the local registries. Note that aboriginal people often inter-married with slaves, and so you may have direct ancestors who were african slaves as well. Also note that aboriginal people were routinely enslaved, too, and then counted as Africans. The ""race"" category on censuses is far more a political decision than any matter of historical fact - entire tribes were marked ""Black"" and others were marked ""white"" - based on their ""civilized"" properties. (If you're interested, there's a book by Jack Forbes on black/aboriginal relations and politics of race terms in the 19th century.) You can fish through the Dawes Rolls, but it's unlikely he's on there. If he was, he'd have moved west with whatever tribe he was a member of. Likely, he was what was called a ""Mulatto"" or ""Half-Breed"" - a term that did not distinguish reliably between african and aboriginal ancestry. DNA testing may be of some help, but the ancestry is far back and DNA testing will give you unreliable information about ethnicity - particularly for aboriginal ancestry (They'll often calculate that you're middle-eastern or some such.) A direct male descendant is also worth testing, but it's unlikely as well, because the majority of ""half-breed"" people had a white father and a ""half-breed"" mother. Meaning that the YDNA will come out as European. But you might get lucky that way and it will tell you something (happened in my case with Autosomal). It'd be best to test matrilineally (meaning his sister's daughters, etc), and it's best to test as far back as you can (oldest relatives)."

Many of the slaves are of age to fit the description of Thomas.  Would explain 1. why he's named Mays/Mayo, 2. why you can't find him in 1850 or before, 3. why you can't find his parents or siblings. (Slaves did not have any of this info recorded. Often, their father was their owner.)  It may be worth checking. The name ""Illia"" is smudged on the Slave schedule. A likely candidate is Lilia Mays, who was 39 in 1850 in Gibson, TN. She owned $2000 in real estate (!) and employed an ""overseer"" among other things.

All those slaves had to be transferred as property. So you never know what you'll find.  Estate inventories for Gibson @ Familysearch start in 1836, going to 1872. Wills from 1824.

I'm trying to get a better understanding of the civil war experience of my ancestors. I'm extending this to cousins of my ancestors, as well.  Since many men in the military are unmarried or just starting a family, it turns out that many of the soldiers who die in wars do not have children (or that their children are adopted young and the actual parentage is difficult to discover). I've really enjoyed learning about these people's lives, service, and sacrifice. It has definitely broadened my feelings of personal connection to the time period.  Just to encourage you, here are some specific things I've found. I've found brothers-in-law who fought for opposite sides. I've found officers (on both sides, including one who led a company of the 1st Arkansas Colored Infantry). I've found people who fought in the Indian wars, river-navy men, deserters, casualties, letter writers, and pictures.  My recommendation is to build a big tree, because that is fun, but definitely to look at relatives, especially in more recent generations. Also, by the way, marrying cousins and in-laws is really common and wouldn't have been seen as disturbing in many situations."

Genealogy,336ew7,SplashyMcPants,2,Mon Apr 20 23:59:34 2015 UTC,"Well, that's a loaded question, because I love plat maps :)  Early on, Michigan was divided into ranges and counties, and within a county, into townships, and within those, into sections. All one big grid system.  A section is a plot of land that's 1 mile by 1 mile square, or 640 acres. From there, the sections were divided up into farms, usually in 40 or 80 acre plots, again forming a grid.   On your plat map, you'll see each map is divided into numbered squares. Each one of those is a section. The reason you see these listed in the map book is that in early days, before roads and villages were created or founded, people navigated by section number - ""You're looking for the Jones farm? That's in section 26, southwest corner."" You also see them in historical documents - ""John Smith ran a cooper shop and a mill in Section 3 of Commerce Township for many years...""  Also, you'll note that if you put a modern map over a plat map, you'll see that most of our north/south and east/west roads fall on section boundaries.  A bit of trivia: the federal law that defined this (it was refined later) was the Land Ordinance of 1785. In it, they set aside specific sections within each township for dedicated purposes, for example section 16  - the center section for each township - was set aside for public administration and education. If you look at section 16 on any given plat map, you will probably find there are a lot of schools and government buildings there.  Today, sections don't mean much, but they are used on survey documents and in the legal descriptions of plots of land.  Plat maps are fun.

Does that mean that a family member, say a cousin, has done a lot of work and posted that work somewhere?  And has the tree you've found provided any kind of documentation or reliable sources carefully linking all the people in it together?  A great many of us can link a few ancestors to  reasonably-well documented ancestors who go a fairly long way back but, at a certain point, many of those lines become mired in legend and lore.  There are a notoriously huge number of terribly inaccurate trees out there, lots created by amateurs, a number of well-known ones created by well-known pseudo researchers.  I, frankly, don't see how you can avoid doing the research yourself, taking clues from others, perhaps, but verifying everything.  If you don't do this, you may have found a ""tree"" but the odds are that, past the point of sufficient supporting documentation, it's not really anyone's.  Edit:  To answer your question, if I can't find adequate evidence to support adding someone, I don't include them.  The ancestor then remains the blank, the question for further research.  It sure saves the time of having to delete a pile of people who shouldn't be there and the huge waste of time of hunting down parents of ""ancestors"" who aren't even mine.

When you get that far back, you can't really know.  As an example, with the discovery of Richard III's bones, it's possible the current royal family doesn't actually have a direct paternal link to Edward III (although statistically it's more likely the break occurred elsewhere). And if a line as well documented as that could be inaccurate, your easily could be too.  But even ignoring paternity issues, historians can easily be wrong, especially if their source could have been written by someone with a certain political goal in mind. Back then, genealogy was something that could be used to help someone's claim to the throne and other things like that. And people with certain goals didn't necessarily care if it was true or not.  If it was me, I wouldn't consider it true also because I don't have the  knowledge to accurately evaluate historian's claims myself. I would suggest at least doing more in depth research to understand why historians think something is true before you accept it.  And you could always have two trees. One with only proven information and one with everything. But honestly, I doubt any one will ever be able to prove something as far back as 45 AD without a time machine."

Genealogy,32tapo,bsami,3,Thu Apr 16 15:22:11 2015 UTC,I believe this just combines data from 23andme's relative finder and Familytreedna's Familyfinder. If you look under type: anything with a V is from 23andme and anything with a F is from FamilyFinder.  Your closest relatives are listed first by total cMs then by largest cM.

Genealogy,32tapo,2pc_and_a_biscuit,2,Thu Apr 16 21:20:11 2015 UTC,you are probably right.
Genealogy,32tapo,jayhawk03,4,Fri Apr 17 02:27:26 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that there are many ways to use the tools. I use GEDmatch , 23andme, FTDNA, and ancestry to try to identify where I inherited specific segments of my DNA. For example, my brother and a known (to us personally) maternal 2nd cousin all have tests on 23andme and GEDmatch. Our common ancestor is our great grandfather James.  My brother shares the last 1/3rd of chromosome 15 with our cousin. I share only a small bit on the end of that chromosome. You can use the 1-1 test in GEDmatch to see where identical segments between people start and end.  When my brother was conceived he got 1 copy of chromosome 15 from our dad (containing our dad's parents DNA) and 1 copy from our mom (containing her parents DNA). At conception those 2 chromosomes swap DNA between themselves so that my brother's resulting pair of chromosomes 15 contain DNA from both of our parents (and grandparents, and great-grandparents, etc). This is called recombination. Same goes for me.     I can use the Family Traits tool on 23andme to see where my brother and I are  100 percent identical, which means that he and I got exactly the same recombined DNA from our parents, half identical, which means that 1 of the chromosomes one of us got is different at that location, or not identical, which means we got entirely different DNA on both chromosomes at that location.    At the exact location where I share no DNA at all with this cousin, my brother and I are ""not identical"".  What that means is that anyone else who matches my brother there, but doesn't match me got that DNA from the same ancestor somewhere down our maternal line (James or one of his ancestors). Anyone who matches me there but not my brother shares a common ancestor with us on the paternal side.     So now I can go looking on GEDmatch 1-many tool for people who meet the above conditions and possibly find other people who are related to James Perry. Email them to see if they want to compare notes or family information and possibly establish that this, or some of this, DNA came from James's maternal line. I always try to establish a paper trail to the new match. I also only try to identify places where there a significant amount of shared DNA and a high number of SNPs. Really small shared segments can be identical purely by chance instead of a common ancestor.     If people cooperate then slowly but surely you can triangulate segments of DNA down to specific people and lines of your ancestry. I also reach out to closer matches that are estimated no more than 3 or 4 generations away from a common ancestor and see if they are interested in trying to establish a paper trail between us.  ETA: This is a nice graphic explaining how it works. The blog has a lot of other helpful tutorials on it as well."

Theoretically it is possible that they had the money but it seems unlikely. They both own ~ $1800 in property in 1860.

Pietro Baroni and sister Giulia arrived in 1899, and were also bound for Trestle. Here they are in 1900, living in Plum Township. Julia was living in Trestle when she married in October 1900.  Martin's baptism record, and those of his siblings, may well be found in the church records of Tenno, which are not yet online at FamilySearch.

There was a Joel Robinson who lived in West Springfield in 1810 with (among others) three young boys. One of these boys was named Rufus (he was a boatman who died in 1855 when ""carried over the Dam""). This Joel Robinson had a brother Lewis who lived in Springfield.  So we have claims that Joel R.

If you look at the ancestry message bords, you can see posts from 1999 where people replied in 2008 or 2014 saying ""Hi, I think we are related. I am descended from Y and X is his brother. I got info on their parents. Please email me...."".   There are also cases where a distant cousin who inherited the family bible suddenly becomes interested in genealogy and decides to put the family tree online. Unknown to him, the family bible contains the info several other researchers have been desperately looking for for decades.   So put your info and your tree out there, hoping that another researcher will find you. Be prepared that it might take you years to crack this."
Genealogy,32owmr,maryfamilyresearch,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:15:44 2015 UTC,"Hi /u/maryfamilyresearch.  I was hoping my edit would be clear that I do understand some records might never be found and some answers might never be had.  However, this was my first experience with a professional genealogist and was hoping this burning question would receive a little more attention than ""He may have died.""  Secondly, I was not expecting records from 3.5 hours of research, but was expecting maybe a little direction?  Some leads or sources?  Yes, I have been researching for months, but I have never done anything like this before and expected that professionals might have a network, some strategies, and data that I don't know how to access.  I guess because I'm new to this, I didn't think that was out of the question.  While what happened to Jacob Lohe might remain a mystery, I still would like to know answers to ANY of the following questions:  What were his parents' names?  What were his siblings' names?  From where in Germany did he come?  I would also like to know the same for his wife, Anna Lutz.  In all honesty, do you think it's asking for too much for a professional with experience researching German immigration to New York in the 19th century to find any of those answers in 3.5 hours?  I would really like to know because I would like to find someone else to hire and I had previously thought that wasn't asking for too much, but I wouldn't want to throw my money away again."

I am a newbie at this myself, but I think yes, it is too much too ask.   Yes, a professional genealogist has search strategies that can lead to faster results. But in the end it often comes down to meticulously searching for records with the right last names and then checking every record with those last names on whether you got the right person. This is not something you can do in 3.5 hours.   As a German I know that Lutz and Lohe are two common German last names. New York City at the turn of the century had 3.5 million people, a large chunk of them German immigrants. (IRRC approx 15-25%?) They were dirt poor, so they left very few records. In the records were they show up, clerks with English as first language often horribly mangled the spelling.   To give you an example, look at this census entry:    https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/M2C5-GTT  The family name is Koelsch, btw.   The only way I have been able to find this entry in the census records was to look at every entry in the county seperately. This was only doable because the county had only 2500 inhabitants and because I knew they had to be there. In New York City such a search strategy would be impossible.   To get back to your problem, Lohe is a name that is associated with processing leather, a profession that only needs water. Consequently it is spread out all over Germany with more than one distinctive peak.   http://www.verwandt.de/karten/absolut/lohe.html  This is the map for the variant Loh:  http://www.verwandt.de/karten/absolut/loh.html  It is a name that is less frequent than others, but still too frequent to draw any conclusions on where the name might be from.  Lutz is even more frequent.   http://www.verwandt.de/karten/absolut/lutz.html  There have got to be quite a few of Lutz and Lohe immigrants on the ship lists. I did a quick search on castlegarden and ellisisland, Ellis Island had 91 hits for Lohe and Castle Garden 36 entries. No Jacob. Even if there was, without an approx birthdate he will be hard to identify. This being the 1900s and him being an adult, chances are he was born in the USA to parents of German descent. While the biggest wave of immigrants was between the 1850-1910s, a few German immigrants came in the 1750s."

However, I never intended to enlist the help of Reddit again because I do not want to wear out my welcome, so I did not include any information regarding the two in my original post of my reply to you.  I did not expect someone to provide me with any more help so thank you!  Unfortunately, because I did leave out that information, you had no way of knowing that Jacob Lohe himself reported he was born around 1850 in Germany, immigrated around 1870, and married Anna Lutz in New York around 1884, by which time he was already naturalized.  Anna reported she was born around 1860 in Germany, immigrated around 1880, and was then married.  No marriage certificate exists, and I have been unable to find a passenger manifest or a naturalization record for either (I know Anna would not have her own naturalization at this point in time).  Thank you anyway, I will continue my extremely frustrating search for these two ancestors with no beginnings or endings."

It is a German name, but variants I can easily imagine are Loche, Loh, Löhe, Loeh. Castle Garden also seems to switch N and H and a,o and u. I prefer searching German departure lists because they are more likely to preserve the German names, sadly departure data for Bremen is not available for the time peoriod you need.   Another reason you cannot find him might be because his first name is different. I have a guy who went by J. Christian on the emigration records, but all state side records give his name as John, occassionally John C. If for example your ancestors German name was Gottlieb Jakob Lohe, he might have dropped the Gottlieb and decided to go by Jacob after arrival in the USA. For Anna it would be really useful to have an exact birth date or an exact year of immigration. Do you have her death certificate?"

I didn't include any information in my post because I didn't intend to ask for Reddit's help, but Reddit is helping out anyway!  You guys are the best.  I have seen the name spelled Lohe, Loh, and Lowe (although of course Low, Loeh, and others are very possible).  It has been suggested that it is possibly a change from Lowenstein, but this remains unsubstantiated so far.  On the census records, he is listed as Jacob Lohe.  On some of his children's marriage certificates, he is listed as Edward Lohe.  His eldest son was named Edward, so it would make sense to be a family name, meaning I am likely looking for Jacob Edward Lohe, Edward Jacob Lohe, or any of those combinations with the previously mentioned name change possibilities.  I do not have an exact birthdate for Anna verified in the records, although the census states it is 1860 in Germany.  She says she immigrated in 1880, which again is unverified by the records.  I do not have her death certificate in my possession, but I have viewed it at the NYC Department of Records.  Her parents were listed as unknown, and her maiden name was listed as Lutz."

This made it a very popular Jewish name. Do you know the religion of your ancestors?   Edward is not a German name. The German equivalent would be Eduard. Another close German name would be Ewald, Ewald could easily become Edward in an English setting. But both Ewald and Eduard were fashionable names in the 1890 to 1920s, for somebody born in 1860 those names are quite unusual."

One thing I've done if the evidence isn't conclusive is to add a person to my tree without connecting him to anyone. I had a Joseph D. King in South Carolina (middle name unreliably reported as D'arby), and had found several records for a Joseph Derby King in Canada that I believed (but couldn't prove) were the same person. The timeline and other details were consistent, but there was no firm link. So I created Joseph Derby King as a separate person on Ancestry, with no relationships to the rest of the tree. That way I could continue to save and collect the records belonging to Joseph Derby King, and expand on his family, in hopes of eventually connecting the two.  In the end, it was probate records that proved it. I wrote to the county archives where Joseph D. King lived in his later life and asked for any probate or land records associated with him. I got back copies of deeds where the children of Joseph Derby King by his first wife in Canada relinquished their claim on their father's South Carolina property so that his second wife could inherit it free and clear. Clear evidence that they were the same person.   It was definitely one of my most exciting breakthroughs, to have finally proved what I had suspected for a long time.

Genealogy,32jdcw,CrimsonHairless,9,Tue Apr 14 06:58:11 2015 UTC,"Joseph's World War I Draft Registration Card says that he was born in Santa Caterina Villarmosa in Sicily. (His presumed brother's card says St. Caterina, Sicily.) FamilySearch has birth records from that town, but unfortunately online access to them is limited. I found an 1878 marriage record for a Calogero Giunta and Antonina Pistorio indexed here. Indexes of births for 1879 and 1888 are not available on that website, so we can't confirm that Joseph and Charles were brothers by that method.  A Giuseppe Giunta from S. Caterina, born about 1879, arrived at Ellis Island on  22 Nov. 1901 aboard the Lombardia. The manifest appears to say that he had previously lived in the U.S. from 1892(?) to 1900. Someone with access to Fold3 can pull his declaration of intention and petition for naturalization and perhaps confirm that this was your Giuseppe Giunta.  Using information from his naturalization index card I found the record of Charles Giunta's arrival at Ellis Island in 1907. It says that he was going to join his brother Giuseppe (his last name difficult to read) at 412 No. Eden Street in Baltimore. The 1908 Baltimore City Directory shows that ""Jos. Junt"" was living at that address. I suspect that this was your Joseph Giunta, and that this is confirmation that the two men were brothers. Since you have their dates of birth, Santa Caterina Villarmosa civil or church records should help confirm both that they were siblings and the names of their parents."

The Hatfields and two Jacobs families appear in the 1840 Census in Hamilton County, all in Jackson Twp.: George S. (aged between 30 and 40) and Mary (aged between 40 and 50). George S. also appears there in the 1850 Census, aged 45, which makes him highly unlikely to have been Nancy's father.  A History of Hamilton County, Indiana lists only one Jacobs among the early settlers, George S., who arrived in 1838. George S. might be the same George S. Jacobs who lived in Byrd Twp., Brown Co. OH in the 1830 Census. A number of other Jacobs families lived there at the same time. It's possible that the 1840 Mary(who is of an age to have been Nancy's mother) closely related to George S., and came along with him to Indiana or followed shortly after.   Unfortunately, Indiana's probate and land records don't appear to be online. Perhaps the local historical society would be willing to do lookups in their indices and see if any Jacobs' appear there between 1836-1850.

I know people who have had their personal photos stolen by someone who made them go viral for one reason or another, and unless you can afford an intellectual property lawyer to work long hours tracking down all of the offenders, the photos will keep proliferating - most people sharing them quite innocently, not knowing their origins. It happens on Facebook when you share a photo privately to friends...and all it takes is one person to download it and upload it to share with other friends for the same thing to happen.

Genealogy,32dwrd,dwellersire,4,Mon Apr 13 00:06:38 2015 UTC,"This is speculation, and may be completely wrong, but I wonder if Roy's father's name was not Edward but George.  I found this 1891 docket entry in Allegheny County probate records. Mary A. Harper asks the court to appoint a guardian for Royal V., George T. and Archibald W. Harper, all under the age of fourteen. I'm wondering if ""Royal V."" was your Roy V. Harper.  There are a few words missing from the record. After the boys' names, it should read ""sons of ______, late of Allegheny County, decd."" Who was their late father? Another docket entry from 1890 fills in the blank. In 1890 Annie E. and Mary Harper, minors over fourteen  years of age, daughters of the late George T. Harper, petitioned for guardianship. (Michael McBride would be made guardian of all five children.) We find George and Mary A. Harper living in Pittsburgh in 1880 with daughters Anne E., Mary and Stella F. Stella died in 1882, which explains why she does not appear in the probate records. The father, George T. Harper, a native of England, died 8 Apr. 1889, having shot himself nineteen days earlier. Here's a docket entry that mentions George and his widow. This newspaper article gives the grim details of his death.  I have found no further record of Royal V. Harper, unless he was Roy V. Harper. From what I can gather Royal's brothers George and Archibald were born about 1884 and 1886, respectively. As Royal is listed before them, it might be assumed that he was older, and thus born between the census in 1880 and his brother's birth in 1884. Roy V. Harper, born December 1882, fits nicely into this family.  One further piece of speculation: Mary A. Harper, a widow, married Edward Malley, a native of England, 1893 in Pittsburgh. She was born October 1854 in Pittsburgh, which agrees perfectly with the age of George T. Harper's wife in 1880. Perhaps this explains the name ""Edward Harper"" given on Roy's death certificate. Edward was possibly the name of his stepfather."

I know on the English census, illegitimate children were often indicated; did that ever happen on the US census?  Otherwise, is there another sibling to Mariah and Lee?

None of the sources on that tree list them as anything other than ""Nutt"" so I have no idea where that came from - BUT I decided to look into it. It appears that somewhere around 1940 the Nutt family began going by McNutt. Perhaps the name McNutt was also used in the 1800s?   I believe this is Mary's sister, Callie's death record.  She is listed as Callie McNutt. The birth year is way off but the name and location match and birth date of May 16th matches Mary's death certificate which makes sense if they were twins. Unfortunately the certificate (available on Ancestry) does not list her parents.  And here is one of James Thomas's children listed as ""McNutt"".

Genealogy,325v84,canis11,6,Fri Apr 10 20:59:32 2015 UTC,"It depends what you're looking for.  Autosomal DNA passes down through both your paternal and maternal ancestors can be used to predict your ethnicity/regional ancestry percentages, and possibly find cousin matches dating back a couple hundred years.  Paternal DNA passes down only father to son through the Y chromosome, so only tests a single branch of your family tree.  Thanks to the Y's relatively high mutation rate of the non-recombining region, testing can be used to find relatives dating from a couple thousand to a couple hundred years ago.  Testing this will get you your paternal haplogroup, and help find the regional origins of your paternal line and surname.  Mitochondrial DNA passes down mother to daughter (or to son, but ends there), and can be looked at similarly to paternal, but has a much slower mutation rate and size.  Testing this will return your maternal haplogroup and a regional guess at your maternal origins.   Geno 2.0 is pretty good test if you're interested in finding your paternal and maternal haplogroups, while also getting you basic regional ancestry breakdowns and Neanderthal/Denisovan percentages.  The autosomal coverage is probably the lowest on the market, and they don't offer a matching capability or the ability to contact others.  They do allow you to transfer your results to Family Tree DNA for free. Chromo 2.0 by BritainsDNA is in a similar category to Geno. It's somewhat more expensive but has better and more targeted coverage of the Y, especially for paternal ancestry from northern and western Europe.  This offering does not provide DNA matches. 23andMe tests autosomal, paternal, and maternal DNA, and has a pretty sizable database (I'd say second largest) and good matching algorithms.  Their ethnicity breakdown is one of the best and detailed that I used - it provides overall percentages, ethnicity breakdowns of chromosomes, and can phase/split your results if you get one or both parents to test.  A limitation on this one are that there's no guarantee an anonymous match will respond or accept a request to share info.  Since it started out marketing as mostly a health tool, there are users that have no interest in the genealogy side of things.  The maternal haplogroup got me the same result as Geno 2.0, but 23's Y coverage is one of the lowest, many years out of date, and is only really good for predicting which continent or continents your paternal ancestor is from. AncestryDNA has the largest database, all the users are genealogy focused, and many have family trees to go with their results too so you can look for shared ancestors by name.  This offering provides ethnicity percentages, but does not have a chromosome browser or provide paternal/maternal results. Family Tree DNA has some of the broadest à la carte testing options available on the market.  They also provide an autosomal test with matching/ethnicity on par with 23 and Ancestry, but with the smallest database of the three.  If you decide to test with 23 or Ancestry you can transfer your results to FTDNA for free and you get the first couple of matches free, but you'll need to pay to unlock all of them.  On the other hand, FTDNA's paternal database has no rival and is perhaps the largest and most comprehensive one out there.  They mostly test Y-STRs (short tandem repeats) unlike Geno/Chromo/23 who test only Y-SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms).  If you want Y-SNPs in FTDNA, you can transfer your Geno results for free, test single SNPs, test SNP arrays if available for your haplogroup, or get your whole Y chromosome sequenced for the most detail.  FTDNA also offers MtDNA tests on par with Geno/Chromo/23 and full MtDNA sequencing.   This page has a good comparison table of the different tests, with prices.  Having testing with almost all of these groups, I'd say 23andMe is a great place to start out.  If 23's paternal results pique your interest, you can do further testing with FTDNA.  If you find yourself wanting more matches with comprehensive family trees to look at, you can try out Ancestry too.  And as floramarche said, you can transfer your autosomal results from 23/Ancestry/FTDNA for free to gedmatch.com for cross-company matching."

Genealogy,323ieo,hopelessbookworm,13,Fri Apr 10 07:36:16 2015 UTC,"Tread carefully here - There's another thread from a few days ago that lists the many blog posts discussing false positives in this new feature. I myself received a suggested ancestor who I 100% know is not mine.  My family were in Sicily and Scotland back to at least the 1700s, even if you say that someone who thinks they are the father isn't - there's no earthly possible way that I have a great great grandfather from Salt Lake City."
Genealogy,323ieo,Djangoinspired,4,Fri Apr 10 08:22:16 2015 UTC,I myself received a suggested ancestor who I 100% know is not mine.   How do you know that it wasn't a product of infidelity though? You can never 100% discount something.
Genealogy,323ieo,pe5t1lence,7,Fri Apr 10 14:43:55 2015 UTC,"Nonpaternity events (when someone thinks they are the father and actually aren't) typically happen roughly 2% of the time, but even if so - whoever would be the real father must have been in contact with the mother and so logically must have been in the same area.  My grandmother remembers her grandparents vividly as Sicilian farmers who never left their village, perhaps the father isn't correct - but then the only person to replace him would be another person from around there or passing through. To say that a man who spent his entire life in the United States in a period when my family (and his man) were seemingly far too poor to travel anywhere and definitely not to return back, seems far fetched.   In Genealogy you have to go with the most logical possible explanation whenever it presents itself until you have further evidence, I can only surmise that the DNA clue is a false positive and it needs more work (like others have done also). If these matches are in the right region or even of the right ethnicity, I'd give it a much closer look but as it stands it's almost impossible."
Genealogy,323ieo,Djangoinspired,3,Fri Apr 10 17:40:44 2015 UTC,I think this will be a more common problem as DNA is used for genealogy in addition to paper records.  I can't imagine that in my 12 generations of research no one passed a kid off as their husbands when it wasn't.  Related to this topic.

Genealogy,323ieo,essari,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:14:08 2015 UTC,"Oh I know! :) Right now it's just a compelling theory that makes sense to me. I still need to place the Forrester family in the right area during the right time, and I may never have a piece of paper saying that these are Tomas' grandparents because of his abandonment, but that's still more than the family has had in 150 years."
Genealogy,323ieo,donkeykonguk,3,Fri Apr 10 21:16:54 2015 UTC,"Good luck!  I've been manually tracking couples that show up frequently among matches, and finding some promising clues. For example, there are some where I've originally thought there couldn't be a connection, but months later, I'd learn that someone close to the couple had lived 20 miles from my known ancestors in Ireland. That tells me that, at least in some cases, I am on the right track. It's cool because the unexpected connections (names, locations, ethnicities) stand out more among matches, and those can be fascinating (for example, even though my grandparents didn't leave Ireland until the 1920s, we have a ton of DNA matches that point to the US Southern colonies. My working theory is that some families sent one son to the Virginia plantation, and another one to the Ulster plantation, both of which occurred in the first quarter of the 17th century. Even though I don't have certificates to prove descent (and in some cases, they may not exist), I can build up a case on Unexpected DNA matches and historical documents. I hope the new ancestry feature would help me find some of these common ancestors, but it hasn't yet. It sounds like ancestry may have oversold the power of the feature, but I think the basic idea is very compelling."

Genealogy,323ieo,Gersthofen,3,Sat Apr 11 07:33:44 2015 UTC,"So, AncestryDNA has a new feature which extrapolates the identity of previously unknown ancestors based the test subject's matches.   I have little faith in the accuracy of this new ""tool"" from Ancestry.   I think it is misleading and dangerous.  For the past year I've been doing better than this manually in Excel with the AncestryDNA Helper  (Link to Yahoo Discussion Group).   Group Description  This group is for primarily discussing Jeff Snavely's tool to help investigate your matches at Ancestry.com. Jeff's tool is a chrome extension that will allow you to scan and download a list of your matches and the genealogy information on their DNA page including a list of ancestors found in their short display trees, notes, frequency of that name found in your list and many other helpful features. Discussion on how DNA genealogy works, requests for help, information on sales at Ancestry, new tools at Ancestry DNA etc. are welcome but we try to stay focused on Jeff's tool and it's use. To obtain Jeff's tool go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ancestrydna-helper/hjflmfphflaeehhpdiggobllgffelfee?hl=en-US It's FREE but we encourage you to consider a donation to Jeff for all the work he puts into this tool!"

Genealogy,324niw,Oracle365,3,Fri Apr 10 15:28:54 2015 UTC,"Here is the info I found, with help from Phronimost below.  William's early life info---- William Sherman McCracken was born 30 Sep 1875 in Jasper Co, Iowa.  His parents were Levi McCracken and Calista Jane Barker.  Their marriage index record gives his mom's name as Jane Barker.  His mom died in 1878.  He had an older sister named Sarah who was born in 1872 and died the same year Levi was born. http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=86118407 http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=86118465  In the 1880 census, Levi has been sent to live with the Joseph and Rachel Stout family.  Originally I thought that perhaps Rachel was Levi's aunt, but her maiden name is DeWitt--I haven't found any link between them.   Levi has gone to live in Dawson Co, NE.  He is staying at the house of Francis S. Clay, who is a shoemaker.  Levi's profession isn't listed. I thought perhaps Francis was related to Levi, but Francis was born in New Hampshire.  Could still be a relation somewhere.  Or!!!! they served in the same Civil War unit?  In Nov 1885, Levi files for his Civil War pension as an invalid.  (He served in Co. E of the 97th Pennsylvania Infantry.  The pension record doesn't show where Levi is living at this time.  1885 Iowa census--Levi is back in Jasper Co, Iowa living at the Sarah Teed household.  Sarah is born in Pennsylvania, maybe she is a relative?  1890--no census records or veterans schedule available for Iowa  In 1896, William married Anna in Boone Co, Iowa.  1900 William and Anna are living in Washington Co, Iowa with kids.  1900 Levi is boarding at the house of Mary Stock in Jasper Co, Iowa.  1901 Levi dies May 12, 1901 and is buries with a veteran's headstone in Marshall, Iowa.  I found info on Calista Jane and Levi before they were married. Do you want it or do you want to explore yourself?  Here is the page I made for Levi http://trees.ancestry.com/tree/77233487/person/44397706475?addnew=1&msg=ne&et=census  and William Sherman http://trees.ancestry.com/tree/77233487/person/44397706438  I can give you the source info if you want to send for any records.  More thoughts--Levi probably had brothers who also served in the Civil War.  You could send for his pension and service record if you want to know how he was wounded.  We could figure out how to send for Calista Jane's death record if you want to know why she died so young."
Genealogy,324niw,OxfordDictionary,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:18:47 2015 UTC,"Man that is awesome I, can't thank you enough. I would love any info on Colista Jane and Levi before they were married, I have seen the census records for Levi 1850, 1860 & 1870 with father James McCracken and mother Sarah Lucas Templeton, before I start heading down that road I want to get copies of all the records I can get a hold of.  I was looking up how to send for the pension and service records for Levi and saw an article mentioning Form NATF 86, I will work on getting a copy of that, hopefully it won't be too difficult.  As for Colista (Calista) Jane Barker's death record, I would imagine I should try to get a death certificate from Jasper County, Iowa."
Genealogy,324niw,OxfordDictionary,1 point,Sat Apr 11 21:22:00 2015 UTC,"Let me know when you figure out how to order the pension info, since I want to send for my g-g-gpa's too!   I want to hear about Calista Jane's cause of death when you get the certificate, too.  She died so young, I wonder why?  I also saw the census records that look like Levi's parents were James and Sarah McCracken.  I will look at those again, but I agree that you should confirm as much as you can with death certificates and stuff.  There were tons of McCracken families in that area and as you said, a lot of people on Ancestry trees seem to have them confused.  Adding in your previous post that u/phronimost answered that confirmed William Sherman married his first cousin--there is a lot to get tripped up on."

I would like to offer, for your review and information, a complete transcription of pages from the ""Family Record"" of William McCracken and Mary Elizabeth Bell, as recorded by their grandson; Richard S. McCracken on February 8, 1914.  First, grant me leave to provide what is ""known"" as background information, leading to the birth of William:  Descendants of James McCracken, Sr.  Generation No. 1      1.  James1 McCracken, Sr. was born 1753 in Immigrant Ship, and died 1814.  He   married Sarah Rebecca Greenwood, daughter of Joseph Greenwood and Mary.  Family documents, contributed by the researcher, Samuel Lewis McCracken (great-grandson of the aforementioned William),  tell us the story of James and two brother-in-laws; Casper Hockenberry and Arthur Bell.  In 1774, James was married to Sarah Rebecca Greenwood.  Rebecca¹s sisters, Ann and Mary Elizabeth married Casper and Arthur respectively.  We know James and Casper served together in the Revolutionary War as members of the Cumberland County Militia.  Sometime after the war, the three men along with their families traveled up the Susquehanna River and settled what is now Clearfield County. Hockenberry did not settle in this area but his descendants eventually ended up in the Chest Creek area.  To quote Samuel Lewis McCracken, ""Bell and McCracken both settled on the banks of the river above Curwensville, near the breast of the big dam recently built. ... Pennsylvania Archives show that James and Sarah McCracken purchased 400 acres in Huntingdon County.... They are both buried in McClure Cemetery, also near the breast of the dam.  Bell has a marker, but McCracken has none. We are trying to have one put up through the SAR and the DAR.  McCracken later moved from his home near the river and relocated directly above his original location.  His new home was erected where the present town of Bloomington now stands...""  Three of the sons of James; Thomas, John, and William married three of the daughters of Arthur Bell; Rebecca, Mary and Rachel, respectively.

I found a marriage record for Esther McCracken here.. https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XJ4Q-TP3  This Esther was married in Calhoun Co, Iowa.  Record doesn't tell us the date and year, but Esther was born 1849, daughter of James McCracken and Sarah Templeton.  According to censuses, your Levi (b 1845) had a sister named Esther born about 1848.  We know her parents were James and Sarah McCracken, but not Sarah's maiden name.  I think we can confirm that Sarah's maiden name is Templeton because we have two sources giving that info--the marriage record and the USgenweb family history."

Jackpot: http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=mccracken&GSfn=william&GSbyrel=all&GSdyrel=all&GSst=50&GScntry=4&GSob=n&GRid=24162755&df=all&  Someone linked an obituary for us!  Looks like he was born in Colfax, Iowa on Sept 30, 1875 and lived there until he moved to Chelan in 1938.  This is great, but we still need to confirm it by looking at records.  So go back to FamilySearch and add his birthplace (Iowa) and birthyear (I put 1873 to 1877 since census takers don't always get the years right). I get this result  https://familysearch.org/search/record/results?count=20&query=%2Bgivenname%3A%22william%20sherman%22~%20%2Bsurname%3Amccracken~%20%2Bbirth_place%3Aiowa~%20%2Bbirth_year%3A1873-1877~%20%2Bfather_givenname%3Alevi~%20%2Bfather_surname%3Amccracken~%20%2Bmother_givenname%3Acolista~  First result is a WWI draft card for William Sherman--living in Johnston County, Iowa.  Excellent.  Click on the camera icon to see the whole thing.  It confirms his birthdate and gives his nearest relative as Mary McCracken--his wife.  We still need to find records showing William Sherman earlier in life, so now we need to look at censuses.  They were taken every 10 years, the latest one we can see is 1940.  The obituary told us he moved to Washington in 1938, so we know he'll be on the 1940 Washington census.    The 1930 census is here, in Eldora, Hardin Co, WA. The wife's name is different than the one on the 1917 WWI draft card (did first wife die and he remarried?), but all the kids from the obituary are listed there so we know it's the right one. New info says both his parents were born in Pennsylvania.  That's good info to know--it could help us confirm him on other censuses.   It also shows us that his youngest son was born in Minnesota (all others born in Iowa).  Youngest son was born  https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XMJD-GPZ  1920 census. Dad's birthplace Pennsylvania, mom's is Iowa.  https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M81C-YLW  1910 census.  At this point I am realizing there were a lot more kids than are just shown on the obituary. Some must have died early.  If you look at the 1910 and 1900 census, they show you how many living and dead children the wife has had.  https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:ML1Q-P8N  1900 census:  https://familysearch.org/search/record/results?count=20&query=%2Bgivenname%3Awilliam~%20%2Bsurname%3Amccracken~%20%2Bbirth_place%3Aiowa~%20%2Bbirth_year%3A1873-1877~%20%2Bfather_givenname%3Alevi~%20%2Bfather_surname%3Amccracken~%20%2Bmother_givenname%3Acolista~&collection_id=1325221  There was no 1890 census, it was taken but burned up.  Now something new:  Iowa 1885 census--looks like William (right birthdate) but living with a family named the Stocks--he is 9 years old.  He is the only McCracken living there.  https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:H8QY-53Z    So for some reason, he is not living with his parents in 1885. Here's another census report for a William McCracken living in Iowa in 1885.  We can rule him out because although he is about the right age, he was born in Missouri and his mom in Virginia.  Now to hopefully find out why your Wm. is not with his parents.  I tried looking up all Levi McCrackens in Iowa, found one boarding the the Stock family in 1900.  Not sure yet if it is the same Stock family.  Levi's birthplace and birthplaces for his parents not right.  But things are not always right on censuses. This Levi is widowed.  https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M929-BV2  This Levi McCracken, boarding with the Lacy in 1895 was born in Pensylvania in 1845.  https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VT36-X2W  Looks like we will have to research the different Levi McCrackens more.  I though you said that your Wm. may have been adopted by the McCrackens--can you link the 1880 census you were referring to?  Editted:  okay, forget I wrote anything for a bit here, I just realized I can look up those death certificates on Washington state archives which might explain more. But I will keep this census info here just in case I wasn't barking up the wrong tree."
Genealogy,324niw,OxfordDictionary,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:05:55 2015 UTC,"I went to the Washington State Digital Archives.  There is a death record for William Sherman McCracken--parents were Levi McCracken and Colista Barker. There are no records for Levi and Colista.  My theory right now is that Colista died before 1895 in Iowa.  Levi couldn't care for William on his own, so William was sent to live with the Stock family.  Maybe we will find that that Mrs. Stock was related to either Levi or Colista, since Levi looks to be living with a Stock family in 1900 Iowa census.  I think that Levi probably died between 1900 and 1910 unless we find him on another census somewhere later."

Genealogy,31xqdz,CrayzeeDayzee,8,Wed Apr 8 23:49:51 2015 UTC,"I would contact Sewerby Hall and ask you how to get in touch with their archives.  http://www.sewerbyhall.co.uk/visitor-information/contact-us/  The archives should hold the records showing if a house was settled on your great-grandma. There might be diaries that mention your g-gma and why she was allowed to stay, and there definitely would be estate books that showed estate expenditures.  Have you watched Downton Abbey?  I have read a lot of social history about this era.  Female and male servants were on separate wings.  Only the housekeeper and master of the house had the only keys to the door of the female servants wing.  Doors to the individual female servant's rooms didn't locks--that meant that the housekeeper could come into a room at any time and make sure her maids didn't have any contraband.  It also meant that the lord of the house could enter female servant's room and have sex with them--whether the maidservants wanted to have sex or not.  In 1913ish, only 4% of all births in Great Britain were illegitimate.  But 50% of those moms having babies out of wedlock were maidservants.   Given that info, it doesn't mean that the master/lord of the house had a sexual relationship with your g-gma.  She could have had a romance going with a male servant or chap from back home.   But the fact that she was allowed to stay at the house to give birth (usually, any maidservants who found herself in the family way would have been made to leave the house so she wouldn't influence the rest of the housemaids with her loose morals) shows that something about her situation was not normal.  Also just want to throw this out here--she could have carried the baby to term without anyone else knowing about it.  Maids wore big aprons to keep their clothes clean (so nothing form-fitting like we would wear today).  Maids were still wearing corsets during that period, too.    It's also possible she was too malnourished to be having her monthly period regularly--that makes it a lot easier to not realize you are pregnant.  Also could mean that whoever was doing the maid's laundry might not take notice of the fact that she wasn't bleeding monthly.  (Though a big benefit to working at an estate like this is that servants probably ate a lot better than farmers and village folk did).         So all that to say, it is tempting to say that the baby was the master's illegitimate child, but there are other options too so you can't really know until you contact Seward House to see what they know."

Nicholas would've been dead by the time she or her siblings were born but she is the oldest and might have heard stories. My dad remembers Nick being a big guy and said there is a picture floating around somewhere that I am desperate to find! I agree with your assessment of the arrival records. That seems the most likely candidate. I have no idea if he and Stella met in Russia/where they are from or if they met here. I'll have to search for her arrival records to see. The 1930 census says she immigrated in 1913. Also, that is really interesting about the spinning mills. I am shamefully unaware of the history of Eastern Europe/Russia at this time period so I thing I'll do a little research today on the geography at the time. I would so love to trace back farther if I can. I think my next stop might be finding his death record since I'm in RI. Thank you so much for all of your help and insight!"

A Rhode Island census that uses Nicholas (on 7 Arc Ct) and the city directories that list him at 7 Arc Court as Michael.  He lists his date of birth as May 16, 1890"

I wonder if Nicholas was maybe his middle name? I know the census records aren't always 100% correct. The added ""c"" in the name makes sense with the theory that the pronunciation was changed when they came here, especially knowing census takers often wrote phonetically.

Genealogy,31vo4n,somethinginsideme,1 point,Thu Apr 9 11:43:47 2015 UTC,That's definitely a good question. It's certainly possible there was trouble in the marriage or something. Perhaps Mike is a sibling? Not sure why Stella would be listed in directories with Mike if that is a different person than Nicholas but who knows. I just searched for a Mike Nachod on the Ellis Island site and found this although it doesn't seem to be the same man in the 1925 census if the birth years are correct.

It should be possible to further investigate the story through Y-DNA tests. familytreeDNA is the company, which offers most in that regard. It can get expensive though - so you'll have to decide if it is worth it.  The price range is between $169-$595 depending on the level of testing. They have discounts all the time, so pm me for $20 discounts - or wait for the father's day sale.  Take a look at this project run by volunteers.   While Uzbekistan has friendly people and beautiful cities, it does not have a rich population who can afford DNA-testing. You can easily get skewed results with more matches from other countries. My own ancestry is Polish, but for the same reason, I match a lot of people from the British Isles, and only a few from Poland. My Polish matches are closer, though."

Genealogy,31t6h8,halberdierbowman,2,Tue Apr 7 23:39:28 2015 UTC,"just brainstorming.  if you are sure that none of them are going to have more than 2 littles you could always just do a reverse family tree adding the littles as parents of the big. This would break down if you have more than 2 though. Seeing what you have posted it looks like several people have 3 or 4 littles that they have had over time, but never more than 2 at a time.  If you put it in normally, most of the family tree software is designed to show you the ancestors of a single person or one generation of descendants of specific couple, but doesn't often show multiple descendants. All of the programs I have seen require you to click on each descendant individually to see their descendants.   if you plug it in normally then each big will be able to see all of the littles they have had over time even though they may only be concerned with the 2 at the bottom.        What I would do is a combination of the two. Keep a main record using any genealogy software plugging in each person as the father or the son of another person. you will start with your founding dozen and their littles. you can plug in the other 20 that it appears were never big to another person. for record sake if you want. put in their time that they were active in the fraternity as their birth and death dates.   Then each semester generate a temporary family history with everything in reverse so that each big can see the littles as their ancestors and if there is a big whose previous little is now a big to somebody else they will see the new littles as grandparents. This way you can print something out quickly that has contact information for all the parties involved. Since this record is temporary you can be creative with this part and print out the family records like they have in family bibles with the branches and leaves and such in the background. You can find numerous examples of these by doing a google image search for ""family tree"" If you want you can quickly put text labels using Paint, Photoshop, or Gimp. Put ""Big"" as the trunk and ""Little"" as the branches, or put the big of a big as the trunk and the next big as the branch and the littles as the leaves.   Anyway I hope this helps."

The problem is, as of right now we have nothing to verify that the people in this record are your William & Jessie.   William is from Frankfort and Jessie is from Sherburne which are both relatively close to Syracuse and Jessie's middle initial is E. according to the 1925 NY census. The same census shows us that William's middle initial is T (it is indexed as J but it definitely looks like a T to me). So this record makes sense, but it's just an assumption until we can prove Jessie's maiden name, Also, at the moment, we don't have anything that says your ggfather;s name was Wilford or Wilfred. He goes by William on every other document. Though, Wilford might explain why Fred is listed as ""Ford"" on the 1925 census.

Potential problems include:   Those people with the same last name could have at one point had an ancestor who ""picked"" that name, and therefore could be entirely unrelated to any other families with that surname. Also, that many who DNA test then get immediate family to test also ""skews"" the data toward a particular family cluster rather than a particular surname.  Genetic distance is more variable in actuality than numbers strictly suggest, particularly if you're dealing with populations with isolated gene pools (e.g. Arcadians, colonial Mass.)."

Genealogy,31jvst,Bernardito,2,Sun Apr 5 20:15:45 2015 UTC,"Well, it's rather problematic since many places you listed are ambiguous:   Bockenem: I guess you're talking about this one (Wikipedia) close to Hildesheim (Wikipedia). The GenWiki page lists an Ortsfamilienbuch (one-place study): Brauns, Günter W.: Ortsfamilienbuch Bockenem (ISBN 978-3-936557-15-2). The catholic church books (St. Clemens 1832 - 1953) seem to be in the Bistumsarchiv/diocese archive Hildesheim. Genealogy.net's meta search engine doesn't list any interesting entries for either Hennings or Hahn in Bockenem. Obendorf: There seem to be at least three villages of this name one in Schleswig-Holstein (north Germany), one in Thuringia, one in West Prussia (today: Obodowo; West Prussia). The last one is the only real municipal, which would make it the most likely one. But it seems like it was tiny: a population of 179 in 1905. There are Oberndorfs that seem more fitting, e.g. Oberndorf an der Oste in Lower Saxony (Wikipedia). The other ones are rather far south. Losen: I guess it's one of the two Lossen, Silesia. Either today's Losina or today's Łosiów (Wikipedia). I guess the latter one is more likely, because the first one had only a population of about 350 in 1939 (vs 1.608 for the latter one).   For Hamburg there are a lot of digitized address books available, which you can search directly. The 1895 address book lists an Adolph Hennings on page 212, but he's listed as ""Procurist"" (=company officer with statutory authority), which seems too much for a young person. Hamburg's state archive has a nice list of hints for family research, sadly in German only.  The family names are also regrettably not very helpful by itself. Meyer, Hahn, Kaufman(n), Scholz are (very) common names in Germany. Selzer seems to peek rather in west/south-west Germany. You can take a look at verwandt.de which maps a family name distribution according to today's telephone books.  Just a general remark: In Germany before about 1900 it's very important to state/keep track of the confession of a person. In Silesia for instance the population was roughly split in half between catholics and protestants. You won't find any records for protestants in catholic church books, or vice versa."

Genealogy,31jvst,maryfamilyresearch,2,Sun Apr 5 22:16:57 2015 UTC,"In the tradition of the best romance stories, he followed them back to Germany and they got married in Hamburg,    Do you have the marriage record? I suppose not bc otherwise you'd have the exact birthdate and places of birth for Adolph and Maria and confirmation of family lore on their parents.  Hamburg has a general register of birth, deaths and marriages that in various incarnations goes back to 1811. So while it is a big city and thus tedious to search, it is far less tedious than it could be. (Berlin, I am looking at you!)  The Staatsarchiv Hamburg has parts of this register available online, see http://www.hamburg.de/kulturbehoerde/digitalisate/332-5-standesaemter/4133090/start/  Do you have an approximate year of when they got married? Also, did they get married in Hamburg proper or in one of the small places just outside Hamburg? There are plenty of places that are now part of Hamburg but were not then, they all have seperate registers.     If you find them in the register you could order the marriage record from the state archive with the information from this register.   Ancestry also has quite a few records from Hamburg available, so if you got a membership check there. But note that not all records are online.  Searching in the register for you, I found an entry for an Ad. Hennings with the remark  2. 671 - 95    I would interpret this as register entry number 671 in year 1895, which is just the info the state archive would need.   Since his bride was born abroad, I would recommend you also request the ""Nebenakte"" or ""Sammelakte"" which should contain all the papers they had to bring in order to get married. It might therefore contain a lot of interesting records. At the very least you can expect to find Maria's birth certificate.   Since this was an international marriage, you should also get in touch with the Landesarchiv in Berlin which has the old records of Standesamt I. Standesamt I in Berlin was and is responsible for all birth, death and marriages of German citizens abroad, some of their records go quite far back. They handed over their oldest records to the Landesarchiv a while back.   Once you got the marriage record, you should then be able to get hold of the birth/baptism records of Adolph and Maria.   Hamburg has civil records that go back further than usual in Germany, starting in 1866. So if Adolph was born in Hamburg at around 1868, chances are there is both a baptism record at a church and a civil record of his birth in the files of the old Zivilstandsamt, the predecessor of the Standesamt today.   http://www.hamburg.de/kulturbehoerde/familienforschung/4307636/tipps-fuer-die-familienforschung/  Looking at that link it seems like the state archive of Hamburg has a fuckton of records that could be relevant, so maybe plan a visit there.   Regarding Adolph's parents, I suspect they might have gotten married in Hamburg - if Adolph was born there.   EDIT: Standesamt I in Berlin was and is responsible for all birth, death and marriages of German citizens abroad,"

I kept my tree private, turned off member tree hints, and found a probate record for an ancestor that either nobody else bothered to look for or took the time to transcribe. The document clearly laid out the immediate family and goes against what the unsourced book from nearly 100 years ago says.

The book that mentions the family represents a source that is an authored narrative. What sources the author used are not listed. The informant of that information is undetermined. There are no known records that support a different father. The book was written after the family members would have died.  So on one hand we have an original record, created at the time these people were alive (or most of them) and the wife is giving testimony about her deceased husband and listing the names of their children. On the other hand we have a book that says the children have a different father, with no understanding of where that data came from other than possibly incorrect assumption.

I'll look into increasing the mouse wheel sensitivity, it's a fine balance.  It's not the only way to explore though, you can just click on areas of the genealogy to zoom in.    We thought about the problem of people getting lost when exploring so implemented something to help with this.  If you look at the top left of the page underneath the search you will see text that tells the number of links between your current position and the 'root' of the tree - when you move your mouse curser over this it expands and you can see a full list of every person on the genealogical path between the place you started (the root) and your current view.  It gives not just the name of the person, but also the relationship to the previous person in the list (e.g. mother, father, sister, husband, wife, brother etc.).  This shows where you are immediately and you can click on any person in the list to navigate back.  You can change the 'root' or 'focus' of the visualisation by zooming onto any person and pressing the root button on their part of the genealogy - this enables you to see the visualisation and relationship pathways from the perspective of any person you like from the genealogy.  I'm going to look into providing more information on the screen at a time without zooming in.  From what I've seen traditional pedigrees also have the problem that you can get lost in them (especially when you start exploring cousins rather than just ancestors), but in general I agree with you that there is no one size fits all solution to genealogy visualisation.  Do please experiment more with ZoomPast and let us know if you think of anything else to suggest.  Thanks again."

However, I think Ancestry has about the best pedigree visualization showing about 4-5 generations at a time that expand to the next 4-5 after clicking.  So on my screen I can easily see at least 8 generations from my root person with no confusion at how they flow.   By the way ZoomPast is set up intrinsically you can't show that kind of ""depth"" without zooming.  I realize I'm a corner case.  Very few people have trees as large as mine, so maybe ZoomPast works for others!  There is no ""one size fits all"""

Genealogy,31d2jl,thenoctilucent,2,Fri Apr 3 22:46:15 2015 UTC,"I usually find it's best to start with the simple explanation before trying to explore more unusual explanations for a person disappearing from the records.   The fact that Anna is listed as widowed in the 1930 and 1940 census is a good indication that Michael probably died between 1920 and 1930.   Fortunately, they lived in a major city that had city directories. I found an entry for Michael & Anna Maronowicz living in Milwaukee from 1920 until this entry in 1923. In 1924, Anna was listed by herself, but she was listed as a Mrs. which implied she was married or once married (this includes being a widow). Usually city directories list the name of a widow's husband, but not always.   Given this, a good next place to look is to search for a death record of Michael between 1923 and 1924. There are some Wisconsin death indexes online, but most of them are incomplete. Only the Wisconsin Department of Health Services has the complete index for deaths occurring after 1907. I would contact them to see if they have an index search service.   I also searched newspapers for an obituary or any additional information. You're right, Frank was quite the bad apple and there were many stories about him committing crimes, getting caught, and subsequently doing time. The earliest one here shows that he was in New Mexico on his way home from California. It doesn't mention anything about his father. I didn't find an obituary or death announcement for Michael either in any newspaper.   Also, Frank wasn't living with his mother in 1930 because he was at the Wisconsin Industrial School for the Boys. It seems to be some type of juvenile detention facility. He seems to be a troublemaker for most of his life.   Sure, it's entirely possible that Michael changed his name and went to Chicago to be a bootlegger, but if he didn't want people to find him while he was living, it's going to be ten times as hard to find evidence of him after he died."

From what I understand, if you get your name changed, then the name change gets attached to your birth certificate.  So the birth certificate would still be in the original name.  If the birth certificate doesn't include the reason for the name change, let me know and we can get that info from the probate court.  So my suggestion is: send for Evelyn's birth certificate.  It costs $21.50 and you can order it here.  The info you need to provide is:  Complete legal name of child:  Evelyn Dimatteo Date of birth:  21 Nov 1929 Mother's maiden name:  Krause City or county of birth: Cleveland, Cuyahoga Co, Ohio You can also give them the state file number:  1920072565    You were wondering where the name Parker came from.  I researched his mother, Charlotte Krause.  Her dad was born in Germany and her mother was born in Hungary. (Charlotte was born in Ohio)  And you already know that Evelyn's dad was born in Italy.  So it is a real immigrant melting pot!    I thought maybe Parker was a family name on Charlotte's side, but now I think that Evelyn was just going for a completely new American name.

People in the US are descendants of people who migrated to the US from a number of different countries, over the space of hundreds of years. Their history is many people coming together, with different nationalities and ethnicities, to make a new country. And, as the OP observes, in many cases those ethnicities effected how their ancestors were treated. So it's a big deal where you came from.  People outside the US just see how people left their countries to the US years ago, became US citizens, acquired new history, new accents, perhaps even a new language. They're no longer natives of the country they came from, they're Americans.   Then you put the two together. Let's use the most antagonistic combination of a Scottish-American visiting Glasgow, and talking to a Scottish-Scot. The American, identifying as Scottish and wanting to share common ground with the Scot, declares ""I'm Scottish"". The Scot hears another American tourist ""pretending"" they're Scottish when they're quite obviously American, gets very annoyed. The American gets punched.  /s on that last sentence, obviously.

There seems to be two (or more) main viewpoints within American society in regards to hyphenations. Hyphenate or not.  The roots are from the 1890's when it was used as an insult to new American citizens who were born in Ireland and Germany. They were somehow seen as being less American and not worth trusting. Woodrow Wilson is supposedly quoted as saying:   ""Any man who carries a hyphen about with him carries a dagger that he is ready to plunge into the vitals of this Republic whenever he gets ready.""   From what I have witnessed (and please call me out if this seems overly incorrect) the majority of people who choose to hyphenate are white.  This leaves the American only responses to people whose ancestry is either Asian, African, or Native North/South American. This is without regard to the length of time that they family has been in America.   I am not sure that I could really do justice to the reasons behind this. I know that the ""Where are you from?"" question is usually not posed to whites as often and perhaps not with the same intent.   At what point do we lose any connection to another nation?

My guess is that Woodrow Wilson is referring to people who refused to fully assimilate into American society.  In my experience, the hyphenation as you called it often matters more to minorities because they are usually not as far removed from the original immigrants. In addition, its quite common for Native Americans to affiliate themselves with their respective tribes. I think you are more likely hear someone claim to be African American over say Nigerian American because the experience of being black in America is the more unifying bond. These are just my anecdotal observations and I'm sure Americans of these ethnicities are much more qualified to answer.  With regards to the last point you make, I think it depends very much on what you mean when you say I'm X. I would never attempt to equivocate my sense of being Irish with an actual Irish persons. I simply want to draw attention to what an American means when they say ""I'm X"" (how it is really just a shorthand for something else) and because of the important role ethnicity has played in American history it is important to many of us."

My mom's side embraces their German side because our family there was royalty, and we're descended from some pretty important historical figures on that side. However, my dad's side barely even mentioned our heritage until I went to Ireland a few years ago. They said my dad's paternal side (which we don't really talk to anymore) is Irish. When I visited Ireland, I almost felt as if I was coming home, so to speak. No reason for it, I just felt like I belonged, despite my Irish side being in America for generations and being essentially unknown to me until just before my trip. Since that trip, I have identified as Irish so as to embrace that aspect of my heritage. I'm actually planning on moving there in the next few years, and that for me will be the highest form of homecoming I could possibly have."

Genealogy,311u2j,shanew147,2,Wed Apr 1 14:49:37 2015 UTC,"Griffith's are a type of Land Taxation records, and include the name of the head of the household, the person they leased from and some detail on the property (area of land, etc), and would help with a more precise location if you can find a possible match fro your family, e.g. name of townland or town and street, if that's of interest (Parish records may not give a detailed location).  The dates of this survey vary, but for most of Killanny civil parish are from 1861.  Tithe Applotment Records are from the 1820/1830s, again the dates vary, and are a type of Taxation payable on eligible land to the established church, i.e. Church of Ireland. These only applied to certain types of agricultural land, and do not cover all areas.  For details after 1880 you would be better searching civil records, as most of the NLI Films cut-off around 1880 - so the GRO is the the best option to go for these. I would start with the birth of your ancestor to confirm exact location and parents names, then work back to their marriage etc.... Once you have likely references from the BMD Index, you can order research certs costing €4 from the GRO to see the full details.

Also worth checking neighbouring registration districts in case he was born at a relative's house, but definitely worth checking the parish records for his baptism if you can arrange that.  For some registration district it's possible to view the local copies of the registers (as opposed to those in the GRO) in case the record was missed out of the quarterly returns, or is in the GRO registers but missed out in the indexing, might be worth checking if this is possible to access these in this case... presumably Carrickmacross Superintendents District."

It seems unlikely that the mother, who was marked as furnishing the information, would forget about her daughter, so that's out of the question. Maybe she lost track of time and thought the daughter was born more recently (maybe April 3 or something) than she was.  I'm convinced from other sources that the information I have on the then-infant and her parents is correct.

It makes sense to assume that the family always lived in Maryland and you should search for a ship passenger list there, given son William's birth in Maryland a year after they arrived.

It may not go in exactly that order, and may include outside names as you suggested, but I've found that they USUALLY include at the least the father's father and mother's mother before branching out to godparents/saint's.

If you look at the 1910 and 1920 censuses, a grandchild named Freda (Fredricke) Cavey lives with William and Fredricke.   That likely means that Anna died before 1910.

Now I am writing this sucker in Word!  As far as Henry saying he was naturalized in 1903 on the 1920 census, while on earlier censuses it looks like the family was naturalized in 1900.  I don't know--maybe he was old enough when he immigrated that he had to file his own paperwork?  (Have no idea on that, you'll have to research naturalization policy).  Or maybe it is just a mistake--wife giving out the wrong info, or the enumerator got mixed up?  Hopefully once you find William's paperwork it will show.    Earlier you said the family might be Catholic because Henry and Annie were married in a Catholic church.  The baptism documents from Westphalia that you linked all say ""evangelisch.""  That means they were Lutheran­--Catholic would say ""katholisch.""    I agree that Maryland's online archives are a PITA.  I think that next I would contact the historical or genealogical society in Pigtown and/or Washington village.  Looks like your family stayed in that one neighborhood the whole time.  Ask them which Lutheran church German immigrants would have gone to.  Since the 1940 census says Fredricke still speaks German at home, I would look for the German-speaking church in the area.  They might have funeral records and if Anna re-married, it might have happened there.    But on the other hand, Henry got married in a Catholic church.  Which could mean that either he converted to marry Annie, or that the whole family became Catholic, or that the family didn't attend any church in the U.S.   You should also check out any German language newspapers in the area (or newspapers targetted at German immigrants).  They might have more complete obituaries than an English language newspaper.  Sounds like you aren't new to genealogy, so you might have already tried this.  :)  Ok, I finally completed a message that i can copy and paste that won't get lost!"
Genealogy,30umhe,maryfamilyresearch,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:17:37 2015 UTC,"Henry's 1920 FC says he was naturalized in 1900, Frederike's says she was naturalized in 1890. I don't have data on this for Anna or Wilhelm so I can't corroborate. I am just curious as to why they would be different. Henry would have been about 5 when he immigrated with his parents, only 12 in 1890 and 22 in 1900. So if his parents were naturalized in 1890, he should have been naturalized with them. That is my confusion. But of course, it could just be misinformation on the enumerators part. Although, I was able to make a quick stop at the archives yesterday after work and looked through the index there. I wasn't able to find Wilhelm of Frederike's name but there is an index record for Henry Hellman in 1900 (I didn't have enough time to view the record. I have to make time to go back, I guess).  As far as German speaking Lutheran churches in the area, there were two in the area around the time that they would have immigrated. Martini Lutheran Church (which opened in 1868) and St Thomas (which opened in 1889). St Jerome's was the German language Catholic Church in the area. It is possible they converted, in fact its likely that at the least Henry did as his daughter married a man from a Catholic family as well. They were (all?) buried in Western Cemetery. I haven't been able to find information on which churches buried there unfortunately. At least Frederike and Paul were buried there, according to their death certificates (Paul died at the age of 14 after accidentally drowning).

Genealogy,30to1x,ogrossman,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:07:01 2015 UTC,"There are many aspects to consider when contemplating the hiring of a professional researcher.  In order of importance I'd consider the following:  Expertise in the area and era of research: There are many researchers who might profess experience in a particular location or time period.  It is generally difficult for the general public to evaluate these claims so we must trust the expertise of other researchers.  I'd suggest contacting local historical societies and libraries in the area in question.  If they have a local history and genealogy section in said library, ask to speak with the librarian in charge of that section.  Let them know the family names you are researching and the dates in question and ask for their recommendation of a researcher for that target.  Keep in mind that when dealing with antique language variations one may also have to ensure that the researcher has formal academic training in the language of that area and era.  Prior work and references: Once you find a researcher to be considered ask for references first.  Make sure you specify that these references be from clients and not merely personal acquaintances.  Once you have a list of references contact them and ask if they might be persuaded to let you examine a sample of the work they were provided.  Do not be offended if they are reluctant to do so.  Professional services produce commissioned work and it is generally costly.  Many clients may consider it private material and be reluctant to part with it.  If this is the case ask them about their personal experiences with the researcher.  Did they meet timelines for deliverables?  Did they maintain regular contact and update the client with discoveries? Were there any reservations they had about the researcher's work? If none of the clients are willing to provide samples then contact the researcher again and request samples directly from them.   Evaluation of prior material: Check the citations the researcher provided in the work.  Can you confirm the facts stated from the authority cited?  If the citations include online links do they resolve correctly when examined?  Are the citations clear and recorded in a consistent manner? Is the language factual or does the researcher indicate guess work or cite legend as fact?  If the data is strictly sourced from online sites or other trees posted on sites such as Ancestry.com be -very- cautious.    Certification of Researcher vs. Certification of Research: There are many genealogical societies that endeavor to provide a ""certification"" for their membership base.  If the certification is based only on membership in an organization it has little merit.  If the certification is based on records of class attendance and academic performance from an online institution it is slightly better but still bears careful vetting.  If the certification involves accreditation from a major university or school it is better still. Some research may be certified through the application of a stringent peer-review process.  This involves the submission of a paper before a board of other researchers (generally five or more with published material) who have contractually agreed to examine the material and ensure it has been vetted prior to the acceptance of said work.  Work that has been subjected to this process is considered the most highly graded of the genealogical trade.  This is not a cheap process as all researchers involved have to be paid.  Best of luck in your research, Happy Hunting :)"

Genealogy,30tvzk,emkay99,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:03:14 2015 UTC,What do you think of TNG ? => http://www.tngsitebuilding.com/  It seems similar to TMG (at least the online part if I am not mistaken) and is still actively being worked on. I would be very interested to hear your opinion on this. Thanks
Genealogy,30tvzk,oddjobbodgod,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:55:28 2015 UTC,"I've played around with TNG a little and my biggest problem with it is that the developers have apparently slanted it heavily toward Mormon requirements for family research. And their interests are mostly not the same as mine.  The list of events & facts especially (or ""tags,"" or whatever) seems restricted, which is always a bad idea, because human experience is unlimited. Even with TMG, I've sometimes created my own tags -- ""mistress"" for an unmarried couple's relationship, for instance, and ""migration"" for managing multiple changes of residence in the 19th century where ""immigration"" doesn't really apply.  TNG also seems heavy on graphical display, to the detriment of other approaches. Maybe, being an old-time librarian, I'm just more oriented toward text than pretty pictures. A nice display is fine when you want to print out a chart or something for a family reunion, but it's not very efficient (in my experience) when you're simply reviewing or analyzing your data on the screen.  I'll add that the graphics-heavy approach is popular with genealogical software designers because Family Tree Maker is popular -- and FTM was invented by a company that got its start doing corporate organization-chart software. They were looking for a new market and genealogy came to mind because they, too, were Mormons. It's kind of an unintended consequence.  EDIT: speeling"
Genealogy,30tvzk,emkay99,1 point,Wed Apr 1 12:24:00 2015 UTC,"That does not look like a nice piece of software... it may be powerful, but from what I've seen the UI will be taking a lot of that power away from the user from the get-go.   Having recently forayed into genealogy I've found no piece of software that both looks powerful enough and presents my data/information in a way appealing to me, so I'm thinking about starting to write my own piece of software in my free time (I work as an iOS/OS X developer).   I would be interested to hear what you'd look for in a product, and what you could suggest I could look at to get myself started!  EDIT: Apologies if the first sentence came across offensively, I perhaps should have put more emphasis on the ""look"", I simply mean visually the UI does not look fantastic from screenshots I could find: but if that's not something that matters to many genealogists perhaps that's some advice you could impart on me!"
Genealogy,30tvzk,oddjobbodgod,2,Mon Mar 30 21:18:22 2015 UTC,"The UI looks exactly like what I would want in a genealogy program, actually. It doesn't waste a pixel. Mostly because it doesn't force you into a set of fill-in-the-blanks. You're not limited by what some designer decided was the ""right"" way to lay out your research. (I've been doing this stuff since the early '60s and I almost always know better than they do.) There are a gazillion tags available -- and you can create new ones if you want them for special situations.  I've done workshops on TMG for 20 years now, and I like to tell attendees that the program bears a resemblance to a box of loose, plug-in parts. The program is customizable to an almost unlimited degree. If you're an experienced researcher, with a number of different projects going, that's a big plus.  In order to do those workshops, I've experimented and played around with a number of other programs, just so I could answer people's questions intelligently and so I could make meaningful comparisons. I've honestly never found anything that even comes close to TMG in terms of power and customization."
Genealogy,30tvzk,emkay99,1 point,Mon Mar 30 23:10:41 2015 UTC,"Not forcing you into a set of fill-in-the-blanks sounds more like a UX issue than UI to me. Personally as a startup I'd look for something a bit more modern and clean and less intimidating, which, when I needed it to be could be powerful at the same time! I'm not trying to criticise, more gain some insight on what users would want.   20 years kind of says it all really, and although that may be great for people who have been researching for as many years has the software has been around I feel it might be intimidating for both new/young Genealogists and elderly users. I feel if I could make something clean and nice-looking with all the power of other software it could do a lot for people around the world.  If you're interested in giving any advice I'd be really interested to get some input!"
Genealogy,30tvzk,girlgeek_glasses,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:32:33 2015 UTC,"I feel it might be intimidating for both new/young Genealogists and elderly users   It kind of sounds like you're in danger of confusing the software -- which is just a tool -- with the research methods. And I've run into that frequently, especially among younger novice researchers. People whose research training and experience postdate the personal computer revolution and the Internet frequently have expectations that don't apply when you're dealing mostly with archival records.  You have to understand that the methodology behind good genealogical research hasn't changed in many generations. We've only moved from paper & notecards and pencil for recording and organizing results to a hard drive and a database. You still have to understand what good research consists of, the need for properly cited sources, the difference between ""primary"" and ""secondary,"" etc. The software won't help you do better research.  When I go off to root around in a courthouse, one that doesn't allow cameras, cell phones, scanners, or laptops on the premises (which is probably 50%-65% of all the courthouses I visit), I'm still using a notepad and a pencil, just as I was 30 years ago. And my methods in terms of what I'm looking for and how I evaluate it are exactly the same, too. What methods I use to organize my data, electronic or otherwise, are immaterial.  And younger, newer researchers also need reminding that the majority of useful information still is not available online. Ancestry is very handy, and I use it heavily -- but they don't have everything. Not even close. Especially when it comes to locally-created records.  By all means, use whatever software you're comfortable with. But confuse the container with the contents."

His pants are very narrow and slightly short with turned up cuffs and a crease in front, and he is wearing high-topped shoes to match the short pant legs. He also has a flat cap in his hand. This is a young man, probably between 16-25 years of age, and was definitely taken before WWI. Suits looked different after the war---they tended to be much baggier and more elaborate. During the war able-bodied men would have worn their uniform on an outing like this; they would be subject to ridicule and exclusion if they did not. I would date this photo to between 1910 and 1915.   The second photo is a man wearing an American WWI military tunic, and the eyes and ears do look very similar, as does the shape of the chin.

Genealogy,30twdy,othervee,2,Wed Apr 1 14:32:45 2015 UTC,"So I looked on TheGenealogist.com, which lets you do combinations of search terms and gives much more accurate results than Ancestry does. There's no Alfred Smith as a crane driver prior to 1901 so he had another profession before that. I wonder if he was a general labourer on the docks. Your Alfred Smith in the workhouse in 1911 gives his birthplace as Poplar. The 1901 entry gives his birthplace as 'Cubbert Town'. I think this might actually be Cubitt Town, which is on the Isle of Dogs and close to Poplar. That seems to have been a big area for the docks and shipbuilding, which fits with him being a crane driver. I note that a lot of his fellow inmates are stevedores, etc.   I've found a couple of possible marriages for Alfred in Poplar and will try a few other tricks tonight when I get back from work. The workhouse records for Poplar may be online in the London Poor Law records, although they are generally not indexed - do you have access to the full Ancestry records?  One other thing - the school records seem to give Lily's birthdate as 18 June 1891. Her father may not have actually remembered what her birthdate was, although normally I find dates are more accurate the closer they are to the event (birthdates on death certificates are generally less accurate than those on marriage certificates, for example). It's probably worth searching a few years either side.   And I agree the union thing is a red herring. They have to put professions on birth and marriage certificates. I doubt there was a union for crane drivers, it would be more likely to be a union for dock workers that he belonged to."

Genealogy,30twdy,ptegan,2,Wed Apr 1 03:01:51 2015 UTC,In 1901 Alfred is a patient in a hospital for the poor (Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum).  Lilly's school records mention the word institutionalised. I don't know if that means that she was boarding or more likely she was schooled by the state as she had no one else to care for her ?   EDIT: Her school records say that she was born in June 1891 (this was recorded when she was only 4 so is probably correct. If you look on FreeBMD you'll see that there aren't a whole lot of Lily Smiths born in London in 1891 so someday you'll have to order a bunch of birthcerts until you find one that lists Alfred as the father.

I really wanted to believe he was able to provide, but it doesn't sound good. I thought that as he always wrote his profession after his name, that he might be in the union, and carried it like a title. But there are a lot of Alfred Smiths in the union, and no way to id them.  I've done a lot of research on workhouses and if he was injured, it might have been his only option.  At any rate I am determined to find their info and my grandmothers mother.

Though it's mostly a matter of your hands not being steady enough. (Or my hands, anyway.) I usually just take a gazillion photos, either with a small digital camera or with my iPhone, and download them to my laptop afterwards. (And I use the phone's dictation function for interviews, too.)  The problem is, many courthouses don't allow you to bring in cameras OR cell phones OR scanners. Partly because they already have a photocopier for which they charge $1/page and they don't want to lose that income. On my summer 2014 research tour across the Midwest, I found this to be the case in probably 65% of the courthouses I hit. I just expect the expense, and if it's for a client, I pass it on to them.  Small public libraries and local historical societies don't usually care one way or the other. And, of course, a scanner isn't much use in a cemetery. My tech-dependency in field research has shifted considerably since the '90s. Basically, a laptop and an iPhone take care of all my needs most of the time."

Like another poster said slight movements can be aggravating, but most of the time the scanner auto corrected the movement and the rescan I did was unnecessary.   No need for a computer as it uses a microSD card for storage, some would see this as a pro or a con since they can't view the image on a monitor. You can however inspect it on the small display of the scanner, it will at least help determine if it scanned at an angle or if anything was cut off. The quality is top notch and it saves in either PDF or JPG at Lo (300dpi), Medium (600dpi), or Hi (1050dpi).

Genealogy,30luh7,happilyemployed,1 point,Sun Mar 29 02:09:04 2015 UTC,"Well, Hunt (from the verb ""to hunt"") would mean ""Jagd"", a common German surname related to that word would be ""Jäger"" (=hunter).   But ""hunt"" is phonetically very similar to the German pronounciation of the word ""hand"", so I think ""Hand"" is the more likely source of the surname.  Another issue to look at would be low-german (last) names. Along the coastline there are a few distinctive dialects that survive until today, some like Frisian are even considered seperate languages.  And since Dretke ""peaks"" not too far from Hamburg, consider the possibility of an English seaman falling in love with a local girl and settling in Hamburg."

Genealogy,30lhlr,aspie65,1 point,Sat Mar 28 13:44:05 2015 UTC,"Ok I have had a look and I think that there is some problem with the name.  As far as I can ascertain he was born Paul Louis Cordier in 1882 in Camberwell.  By 1891 he was living with an aunt with one brother Alfred (born Peckham 1880).  Following Alfred back to 1881 the parents are given as Pierre Louis Cordier and Emily Elizabeth Smith ( I know this sounds off track but bear with me).  Pierre dies in 1882 the year Louis is born and Louis never appears on a census with his mother, in fact in 1901 he is prison.  So it is possible that he never knew his father's real name and that the name given on the marriage certificate is wrong.  Another fact to consider is that Pierre was a pastry cook so the profession is right.    In my experience names change a lot but locations and jobs don't.  Hope this helps.

I just need to figure out if there's any way to know for sure that its the right person... What would you recommend I do in terms of what certificates to buy?  One more thing, The only really viable death I can find for Louis Charles Cordier is in 1922 in Brighton, but this is one of his children, born in 1925. It could just be that her mother gave her the last name of the rest of her siblings(the ones that survived...) after perhaps a one night stand?

Genealogy,30kgoa,coherent_cat_lady,0,Sat Mar 28 13:15:21 2015 UTC,My best guess:  Name is almost certainly Edgarman  Em ployer looks like Ohio Miss & Labour Co.  Didn't find much via search but I would guess it's either Missouri or Mississippi (there's a county in Ohio by that name) Missouri was granted statehood in 1821 so was well established by WWI.  Do you know if the family was in this region then?  Good luck!  EDIT: looked again at the above comment linked to ebook. The name then could be Ohio Mill & Labour Co. But the second line still looks like it might abbreviate for Missouri or Mississippi.

As in...Antonio Perez was born to a Francisco Perez and Juana Martinez--its highly probable you'd find a baptism index referencing him as Juan Antonio Perez Martinez or something similar. There are often a few names shaved off on later documentation. Always try to trace info through siblings if you cant find anything  directly searching  your ancestor.

Genealogy,30e9k5,WintersOP,6,Thu Mar 26 17:52:30 2015 UTC,"You said in your previous post that Louis had a cousin Emile. Emile Mary, born about 1891, was living with his unmarried aunt Cora Reggio in 1910, and a Reggio cousin was living with him in 1920. So presumably his mother's maiden name was Reggio.  A Elizabeth Helena Reggio and John M. Mary married in Orleans Parish in June 1888. (There is also a marriage from 1895 between John M. Mary and Eugenie Marie Cornu de Liverniere; Eugenie was living without her husband in 1910.) This page says that Emile was the son of John Morgan Mary and Elizabeth Reggio. This middle name is confirmed by a 1896 birth record found here. If Emile was the cousin of Louis A. Mary, John Morgan Mary could be the brother of Louis's father.  Edit: This tree has John Morgan Mary as the son of John Emile Mary and Eulalie Felicite Bosque. Here's the family in 1880. John Morgan Mary's birth record is here, and his parents' marriage record is here.  Edit: I believe I can account for John's brother James through his death, so that leaves brother Henry, born about 1872."

They often report using the name people in that area knew the person as. In addition, when you get married in general, you have the legal option to change your name and may want to drop the ""extra"" surnames. E.g., I have a woman in my line whose husband died suddenly shortly before the birth of their daughter. They hadn't been married more than a couple of years. Many newspaper articles over the years switched back and forth between going back to her maiden name or compounding the maiden name and married surname. Another woman married a second husband, but papers local to where her first husband lived and died continued to refer to her as Pauline K. West, now Mrs. Arthur Baker.  Not sure I can help you with the Mary surname, though. That sure is a doozy to figure out at this point!"

When researching Stephanie I thought she is someone that may not be hung up with societal norms (and by your families' description of her) so her motives and actions could be a little bit more difficult to figure out. One thing about Louis is he went to college.  That was unusual and I wonder if that was due to support or influence from his father.  When I was researching the school (Loyola was called Jesuit College back then)  there were very few students.  I think about 10-20 per class.  It was heavy on the dentistry and medical.  It really made me wonder if Dr. Louis A Mary could be related. No luck finding Louis's records at Loyola.  The woman from student records checked for records and I looked though the yearly bulletins.

If they do have licensed attorneys, their contingency fee structure  or they method they use to solicit clients may not be considered ethical or legal. It may be unethical or a conflict of interest to pay witnesses (such as professional genealogists testifying to a family relationship) on a contingency basis (ie, if they only financially benefit if they win, they have a higher motivation to falsify testimony)   (I am not a lawyer, but these seem like reasonable concerns to me)."

He had never married and had no children. All his siblings were dead. The law firm handling his estate had to go up in the tree to his parents (also deceased) and document all their descendants. So, the starting point was one set of my great grandparents. The researcher was looking for all the living direct descendants, not spouses. My father was deceased, so his fraction of a fraction was divided up between me and my siblings. I think I got about $2,000. I hope that makes sense. I'm saying it is possible.   But from the 1930s? That's a long time for someone to be researching/looking for relatives before finally finding you. Proceed with caution.

Try looking at Probate records for the grandparents in question. That might lead you down a good path.    But, IMO, for any type of recovery of funds that's 80+ years old, you're going to want a lawyer to ensure that nobody ends up coming after you (or your heirs) as they might be claimants as well.  Since you're going to need a lawyer, might as well use the ones that know the situation already.  Maybe that's path of least resistance, but if you do enough due diligence to ensure that the law firm is ""for real"" and not a scam, then 70% of whatever is available is a lot more than what you started with."

It was a thrilling moment to be able to find an heir who had no idea about the branch of the family that was about to hand him hundreds of thousands of dollars and change his life, and the best part was being able to explain that I was not part of some group that wanted a share - that the attorney would call later with the paperwork and the details.  If the grandparents left an estate in the 1930s, and they think there's some fraction that could head your way today, you may be able to figure out who got that money, and confirm all their descendants, and find who died recently, as their will might desire to pass it to any other descendants of the original bequest."

Essentially my husband's Great Grandparents were named (along with the wife's 11 other siblings) as beneficiaries of  the 12th siblings insurance policy. She died childless. Who knows why but none of these siblings knew about the policy.  This firm is tracing the heirs of those original siblings.  So about a dozen of these letters went out.  The gentleman I spoke with had the genealogy correct all the way back to the 1850's in Ireland.  I doubt a scam artist does that much genealogical work.  Anyway, it is a legit firm.  The 30% as explained to me is partially for the work done, but also when the case goes to probate they pay the lawyer and court costs out of that 30% too.  The only thing that has to be signed is a form allowing the attorney to represent my MIL as an heir to the estate.  It was very interesting and at the end of it he asked if I might be interested in a job!

Genealogy,30c0gt,poolecl,2,Thu Mar 26 12:13:01 2015 UTC,"After doing some digging, I think I found the incident that prompted him to draw up the will in the first place. And it's fascinating. Turns out he was caught up in the civil war in Nicaragua and almost executed.   From the New York Times, August 1856:   TERRIBLE RETALIATION FOR THE DEATH OF SALIZAR: Probable execution of Dr. Livingston Ex-United States Consul at Leon - Letters from the American Minister  From the following letter of Mr. Wheeler to the British Consul at Leon, we surmise that the latter had written to the American Minister, informing him that Dr. Livingston, formerly United States Consul, had been taken prisoner by the adherents of Rivas, and in revenge for the death of Salizar, would probably be summarily executed  Letter from Mr. Wheeler:  ""I received last night yours of the 6th inst. relative to Don Mariano Salizar. As you seemed to anticipate, he was captured in the Bay of Fonseca by the forces of this Republic and on Saturday night last, was brought to this city. On Sunday morning, in company with Padre Vijil, at his request I went to see him in prison, and offered to him any services that might be in my power. He seemed conscious that his fate was sealed, and requested that I would have forwarded letters to his wife, and made other requests which I have complied with. He was shot on Sunday last, the 3rd instant, between 5 and 6 pm in the public Plaza.   But you inform me that this occurrence has placed Dr. Livingston in the same predicament. There is no connection between them, and no parallel in the cases. Salazar was one (and a most prominent one) of the faction revolting against the lawful Government of the Republic, and a General in their forces. He knew that he was liable to the penalty of treason. Dr. Livingston is an American citizen, and loved and respected, and owes no allegiance to the authorities of Nicaragua, much less to a disappointed faction; nor has he ever been mixed up with the parties by any overt or belligerent act. As Consul of the United States and a citizen of the satne [sic], he has been resident ten years in this country. He has been recently absent to the United States, from which he has just returned, where he had been to procure medicines and other articles to aid in the comforts and ameliorate the condition of the people of Leon. So unconscious was he of any suspicion of danger, that he left his family (a wife and five young children) in Leon, and passed through here in the last arrival from New York, to join his family.   ...Can the cold-blooded murder of an excellent and accomplished gentleman connected with one of the best and most honored names of our country, the father of a young and helpless family, and in nowise connected with the present state of affairs in leon (for he was absent in New York when they broke out), bring Salazar to life, or remedy the alleged error?""   He was apparently released and sent to La Union, El Salvador, where Irene was born. Mystery solved."

Genealogy,3080xc,Tardislip,2,Wed Mar 25 05:15:51 2015 UTC,"Being without segment matching, AncestryDNA is much less useful in this regard. On 23andMe, once you have shared your profile with a match you can see how they share DNA with any of your profiles or others who have shared with you. You can collect this data and see how each segment of DNA was inherited and track down its origin in your common ancestors. Thus, if you are not able to immediately make a connection to another match but their shared segment overlaps where you share with a confirmed relative, this method is able to provide direction in where to look.  23andMe's Ancestry Composition also breaks down your ethnicity into 100 SNP segments on each chromosome, so you can see exactly where your Scandinavian ancestry lies. Testing your grandparents will immediately tell you from which of them you inherited this and segment matching at those locations with more distant relatives will be able to place that Scandinavian ancestry in more distant ancestors."

FTDNA has pretty basic chromosome browsing - but you can  export it to DNAGEDCOM.com which has a great Chromosome browser with complete triangulation.  FTDNA will allow you (for a fee) to import AncestryDNA, but not the current test of 23andMe DNA.  So if it was up to me now, I think I'd take the test in AncestryDNA.   Import it from there to FTDNA and to GEDMatch and import the FTDNA to DNAGEDCOM.  I am curious if anyone sees any problems or weaknesses with this approach?

This is what he says the note says:  ""The comment of Bengt says that his residence has been unknown for three years and has only now been reported.

For example, try looking at where the Irish immigrants who ended up in the same area as your ancestor came from. Were there any other McGintys in the area (in the US), and, if so,  what info survives about them? Irish surnames, unless very common, tend to cluster in a few counties. There are online tools to show you where most McGintys lived in Ireland. Search for ""irish surname map search"". Check for Irish surname books-I like the one by Edward MacLysaght. His entry on the name locates it in County Donegal, also showing up in North Connaught and County Monaghan. That can at least narrow your search a bit. Consider taking a DNA test at ancestry.com or 23andme.com - you may find matches with certain surnames or locations showing up. Search for any other books or genealogies you can find on McGintys on google books or amazon. Also try US or Irish newspaper archives online for obits etc. search for McGinty genealogy posts online.  Don't get stuck on just one spelling of the name as these can vary for many reasons. Over time, you may be able to piece the puzzle together. Good luck!"

That lead posted by phronimost looks promising... if the Monaghan connection pans out, then on the place to start is with RootsIreland (pay-website) - they have transcripts of many Catholic, Church of Ireland, Presbyterian and some Methodist records for the county, but as you can see from their source list your dates could be a problem.."

Genealogy,30741d,ZhouLe,1 point,Wed Mar 25 00:42:14 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is to re-upload from a new, cleaned-up tree from FTM.  You can start by exporting your FTM tree as a backup that includes only certain individuals. It is much easier to include what you want as opposed to exclude what you don't want. In the export menu you can select ancestors up to 99 generations, including all spouses, and their descendants up to 15 generations (15 is the max for some reason). Add any others manually that are not covered by this that you know you would like to include.  Export this, open it as a new tree. Now go through your ancestors and see how far up each branch you feel comfortable taking a line. I personally use ""Firstname ±Surname"" to mark people are pending evidence to prove or disprove connection.  After you mark them, disconnect them from their parents. Disconnect anyone in your tree that you want to trim from the person that connects them with you. Marking and disconnecting are the most tedious part, but you don't have to do this for everyone; only the individuals at the border between what you want to keep and what you want to trim, (For example, if you want to remove Cousin Johnny and all of his spouses, children, their spouses, grandchildren, etc. you will only need to disconnect Cousin Johnny from his connection to your tree: His parents.)  Once everyone is marked and disconnected, export another backup the same way you did the first. This should leave you with a nice, clean, trimmed tree.  Re-upload to Ancestry and the hints should start to be added immediately.   (For example, if I delete Cousin Johnny who is 2x removed or whatever from my Cousin Boyd, if I decide that my Cousin Boyd actually DID have a Cousin Johnny, when I re-enter his information, will all the old hints still appear?   They should, but the hints are generated dynamically based on the info already there. So if the first time you had Cousin Johnny's birth year in, but don't have it now, you may not get all the hints you had before. If you ignored hints previously, when you re-add the person they will not be ignored (afaik) and you will need/be able to check them again.  Hope this helps. I had to do the exact same thing you did because I made some pretty foolish mistakes early on when adding people. Starting over may allow you to re-evaluate all the source documents to catch any mistakes and to make things are documented and sourced in your tree correctly, but that can be a pretty big undertaking depending on the size of your tree. It gets wearisome re-doing work you have already done before and already know the answers to."

For example: “Tzvi” which means deer translated into Yiddish as Hirsh; “Aryeh” which means lion translated as Leib; and “Ze’ev” which means wolf as Wolf. In the original Hebrew, these names are based on the Torah’s comparing Tribes such as Naftali, Yehuda and Binyamin to admirable qualities of such animals (swift, strong, stoic). Therefore, the translation was often affixed to the original Hebrew as in Naftali Hirsh/Tzvi Hirsh, Yehuda Leib/Aryeh Leib or Binyamin Wolf/Ze’ev Wolf. >   http://ohr.edu/explore_judaism/ask_the_rabbi/ask_the_rabbi/3316  So Louis' immigration records may list him as Tzvi or Aryeh, which I have not seen much of, or as Hirsh or Leib. Since he chose the name Louis, I am thinking he originally went by Leib. His father was Yaakov or Jacob.  . .

How I found mine was nearly dumb luck but I kept fiddling with the specificity ratings on ancestry and just reading through lists of irrelevant search results. For me, I had many relatives that got married in the next state over because they lived right on the border. If this might apply to your relative, check neighboring states and counties.

Heck, maybe your g-g-grandmother had a kid with a relative of her dead husband - stranger things have happened.  If the birth certificate doesn't exist or doesn't have a father's name, and there's no or unreliable family history, then DNA is a good way to go. There are a couple of different approaches - Y-DNA if you are male or have have male relatives, or autosomal. Either way you'll need to identify family members of likely candidates, and test as many people as you can in your own family and in your candidate families."

Genealogy,304p3z,ortund,3,Tue Mar 24 13:40:13 2015 UTC,"So the best advice is to start by writing down (paper, digital, doesn't matter) absolutely everything you already KNOW. Who you are, who your parents are, who your grandparents are. Names, dates, places, etc. etc. Everything you can think of.  Then you can start constructing a basic family tree. Doesn't much matter where you do this as long as you can get comfortable with your tools. If you want to do it digitally, try FamilySearch or Ancestry.com for example (they are only 2 of many possible computer family tree tools). Btw Ancestry is free to use in terms of constructing a family tree. It's access to their records databases that they charge for.  Once you have everything you already know recorded and organized you can direct your research more effectively. The big genealogy websites have tons of guides, tutorials, resources, etc. on how to do things. Examples:   FamilySearch's learning center Ancestry's learning center Cyndi's List for Africa   Here are some questions to help you get started based on what you posted - you don't need to answer them here (unless you need more help), they are just to help you take the next steps after you get organized:   Can you interview parents, aunts/uncles, other family members for more details than what you have here? When and where was Arthur Young born? When and where did he marry Margaret? Who would have held records (birth/marriage/death/census) for Rhodesia from the period before they moved to South Africa? How can they be accessed? How can you find similar records for South Africa?"

Genealogy,304p3z,SwampRabbit,2,Tue Mar 24 14:34:57 2015 UTC,"I did a quick search for Arthur and Margaret on Ancestry.com and I found a birth record for one Lawrence Raymond Young. Is he your father or uncle? You don't have to be specific if you're worried about privacy--if he's a relative say yes or no.   It says he was born on 23 Oct 1911, and the birth was registered on the 13th of November. It lists his parents as Arthur Young and Margaret McCardle--so there's a maiden name for you.   Except--there is a glaring problem with this birth record, because you said Arthur was born in the mid 1900s. He would have been far too young to sire this boy Lawrence in 1911. So either you have your birth info wrong, or this isn't your Arthur. Ah well.     Now, once I inputted this new maiden name into the search box, a family tree popped up. Now, when it comes to others' family trees I urge you to use them with a grain of salt--especially if they're unsourced, like this one is. It's very unclear whether the Margaret McCardle in her tree is your Margaret McCardle at all. But I'll give you the basic info this person has on Margaret, to see if it triggers something in your memory.  This person has Margaret's birth as 12 April 1873, in Greenock. She also has her death as 12 Apr 1959, in New Zealand. So you see, I'm very doubtful as to how related her Margaret (who was also married to an Arthur Young) and yours are.     To be honest I think I'd need more information to find anything substantial. I also tried familysearch.org, which I recommend you use because it's free and has a big database, but I can't really confirm whether or not any of the records are for your relatives due to lack of data."

Since this is more recent family history, a lot of records that would be useful are probably restricted (birth, marriage, divorce, census records are all probably not accessible). A better starting point might be talking to people within the family to hear what they know. Sure, some of this may be incorrect, but at least it will give you some leads to investigate.   Leo Wood isn't exactly an uncommon name, so it will be hard to pinpoint him in records. Since he had an affair with Ruth at least 9 months before 16 July 1961, they must have been living near each other. You might want to look in City Directories for entires for the Whittaker family and Leo Wood living near one another.

Surnames: Schneider, Lehmann, Chiron. I haven't yet been successful in tracing them back to Alsace.  That index record for Michael's naturalization led me to a full copy of his record: 1 2 from here.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have a more precise DOB or location. However, it does list his ""exact"" date of arrival: August 1871 (I've often found these to be incorrect, though). Perhaps most helpfully is the listing of the person he came over with, ""George Keuikflin?"". The handwriting is really crappy for both instances of the surname, but it appears to be an uncommon one either way. Hopefully someone here more familiar with French/German names can help decipher it.  Rusch and Schaffer are both common names, but George's looks fairly unique. There are multiple tools for checking the surname density in France. Here is one example, which will let you zoom into a commune level. If you figure out George's surname, it may provide a hint of where to look for Michael's origins (and likely his wife).  People on the Alsace Ancestry message board are very willing to do emigration index lookups if you post all the information you have in an organized fashion. Include: names of all family members that immigrated, date/year of immigration, language spoken (if known), and their religion (if known). You might get lucky.  As best I can tell, in Alsace, any information you have is pretty much useless without specific knowledge of which commune they came from.

I think I had the birth year slider restricted to +/- 5 years (around 1836). The French revolution was and is a powerful influence on that region. I think that many people there probably felt more of a connection to France than ""far away"" Prussia, where decisions were being made more in Berlin. Find some history of that region in that time period to read up on. It is quite helpful to know the political and cultural climate that your ancestors were dealing with."

Film number 805545 should contain the baptism of Johannes Frommknecht and potentially the marriage of his parents.

Alban's baptism will be on film 2061078.   Note some of these films contain records from more than just one community - the last film for example also has records for Altdorf, a village 5 miles away from Aitrang. This is good news because it was not uncommon for relatives to live in neighboring villages and this way you can easily look them up too.

Do you know where John is buried? Many Jewish headstones will have a HeBrew inscription on them that will give you the father's name, something like ""Here lies Chaim, son of Moische"". If his father was born in the UK and has an English name, then this will probably only give you a hint as to what his name was (many men with the Hebrew name Moische had the English name Morris or Moses), If he was possibly born in Eastern Europe then the Hebrew name is likely his birth name. If John's sons were Benjamin, Morris, Samuel, and John, then his father may be one of those exact names or something like Moische or Mendel for Morris, Shmuil or Scholem for Samuel. Benjamin would be something quite close to that, such as Benyamin. John isn't something I've seen a lot of with Jewish men but according to wikipedia, it would be something like Yohanan. There are just common name trends that I have come across so they aren't truly name equivalents."

Thomas and Angelique's son Pierre was married on 27 January 1835 to Catherine Baillergeon.

His parents' names may be listed in the marriage record of his first marriage to Flavie Mire, listed in the above record as Thomas' deceased wife and a native of St-Constance in Montreal.  On a final note, I am unsure if the Thomas Blais and Marie Angelique Dodier who married in 1794 are the couple who were the parents of the children mentioned in this thread. The names Dodier and Doyer are certainly similar. Also, assuming the birth year estimate on Nos Origines for Marie Angelique Dodier is incorrect and that she was perhaps 16-18 at the time of the marriage, she would have been only in her early 40s at the time of Louise's birth in 1819."

Genealogy,2zydjz,somekidoffthestreet,5,Mon Mar 23 00:28:43 2015 UTC,"No problem! As you get used to it, you'll start to think about what sort of records you should be finding for each person.   Some sort of birth record: in the US post-1880 or so, this will be a city, county, or state record generally. In Europe, which is likely where at least some of your lines originate from, pre-1850 in most places you'll have to rely on church records, which are almost as reliable if a little bit more difficult to find. Census records: in the US, the census was taken every ten years (as you probably know by now). the latest available is 1940, the earliest for some select areas I believe is 1790. state censuses are also sometimes available, usually taken on a non-federal census year. some countries have their equivalents, like Sweden with their household examination records taken by the church. I can't think of any other examples right now. City directories: Sometimes it takes some googling, but most large cities had city directories fairly often. it can be hard to pinpoint ""who's who"" with common surnames, but if you have an address from another record (e.g. censuses, or b/m/d certs), it can be helpful for proving when someone moved to a new place. (e.g. a family pops up in Cleveland in the 1880 census, but they're still popping up in city directories until 1876 in Philadelphia, then they might've already been in Cleveland in 1877). Marriage records: Often well-indexed on Ancestry or FamilySearch, they can have parents names, addresses, or witnesses that lead you in new directions. I've found them at the city level, county, and state (in the US). In Europe, church marriage records can contain similar information. Death records: Seems like you've got some experience with this, but don't be afraid to reach out to county/city archives if you think someone died there but you can't find them in any online indices. they usually have indices on hand, and can check for you over the phone at least if a record exists. Only downside is that they can be expensive to order a copy. Burial records/Graves: in Cleveland, death records for pre-1890ish didn't really exist, but they did keep what they called cemetery interment records. so, almost the same thing, just under different names. graves can have information, but be careful - it's often incorrect, but they can be very useful for plotting out who's who of a family if you get a family plot. Find A Grave is great, if there isn't a memorial page for someone in your family and you create one, you can make a ""photo request"" to have someone photograph the monument. BillionGraves is another site for this. Newspapers: Often times, local library systems will have a searchable catalog of newspapers. so, if you know the death date of someone, you can often find an obituary with more (and sometimes more reliable) information. if you're lucky and they're indexed with fulltext, you can search by article contents. I found an article about my 3rd great-grandmothers 101st birthday party this way, with a full list of all the cousins that were coming to visit. (shout out to nosy midwestern towns in the 1940s). often times, they're not in one central location, but the local library for an area will almost always have a link to what's available on their website. if not, call up and ask, they're usually happy to help and some will even make copies and (e)mail them to you for free.   More important than what sources you use are how you use them. ""Trust but verify"" is the slogan for family trees you find floating around on the web - whether on ancestry, familysearch, or any other site. if whoever made the tree is still active, they'll often be receptive to a question like ""got a source for the death dates of all these people?"" ""oh yeah, my great-uncle had them all recorded in a family bible."" Bam, now you've got a (low quality, but better than nothing) source that might give you an idea of where to look next for records.  People in genealogy are very willing to help: this subreddit, the Ancestry.com message boards and more specific forums/discussion groups/email lists. And don't be afraid to take your research offline, too; some of the most important records I've found I've had to order through the mail or over the phone. A very underused resource is the FamilySearch microfilm, if a record on FS doesn't have a picture attached but there's a little microfilm # underneath it, consider ordering it if you think the record might be of some use. Also, your local library probably has more resources than you think. I found out recently that because of the large Irish immigrant population to my city, the library has ~30 books on Irish immigration with names and background information that could be immensely useful. Completely free!  Sorry this got really long, and a little obnoxiously condescending in some ways, but I do hope it helps. I'm not an experienced genealogist myself (been going at my own tree pretty hard for only a little less than a year), but I've learned a lot just from frequenting this subreddit and being thorough. You'll come across people who have been doing this for decades, all with different things to say, but the basics are generally the same. Good luck in your research!"

Of course the record doesn't list his parents, but I found multiple other trees with a Johan Ludvig Backman listed as a child of:   Father: Petter Anton (Pehr) Backman  Birth 5 AUG 1763 in Loviisa, Södra Finlands län, Finland  Death 20 FEB 1829 in Göteborgs Kommun, Västra Götalands län, Sverige (Sweden)  Mother: Julie Elizabeth Adelaide Campaigne de Boissimenè  Birth 9 APR 1779 in Paris Frankrike (France)  Death 18 FEB 1858 in Otterstad, Sverige (Sweden)  The only problem is, those trees do not list any other information on Johan Ludvig, only that he is a child of those two. No birth date or location, or death date or location. Do you by chance know any of his siblings names? Those parent records list Johan Ludvig, Charles Henri, Julie Sophie, and Fredrik Wilhelm (all last name Backman).  I hope this helps somewhat anyway."

Edit: And here, again from the Bee Lick column: ""Mrs. Mary E. Brown and her daughter, Mrs. Delia Thompson are visiting Mrs. B?gu? Brown at Preachersville.""  Edit: I think I've been able to piece together the family. I found other newspaper articles that show that Mary Brown was also the mother of Mrs. Bell Delaney, born in 1868, who is buried in the same cemetery as Delia Thompson, born in 1878. This site has two marriage records for Louisa Bell (Brown) (Rodgers) Delaney, and one for Cordelia Brown, who married W. D. Thompson on 10 Jan. 1894. Cordelia and half-sister Laura Bell were living in Rockcastle County with parents John and Mary Brown in 1880. Mary was John's second wife, as shown on this page.  In 1900 we find Cordelia and husband Will Thompson living in Crab Orchard, Kentucky (also David Southern's hometown) with daughter Maud, aged 5. They were living in Montgomery County, Indiana in 1910 with daughter Maude, 15. Here's the gravestone of Maud's father, William D. Thompson.  So Maud was only 15 when she married David Southern, which might explain why they eloped and why her parents were misidentified on their marriage record.  Edit: Notice that the 1910 census indicates that 15-year-old Maud was recently married, but living without her husband."

(assuming this was a murder-suicide that happened within a day or so). If not, it's sounding unlikely. If so, it's unusual enough for three generations of a family to die on one day that there must be some mention in the papers, even if it was just a car accident or something. So, second step - library, especially one which has the local papers of the day archived.   Have you checked what their headstones say? They may not mention murder-suicide, but if the cause of death was something else they might be on the headstone.  You could also post the names (even just surname) and place here; someone else may have posted newspaper articles to Ancestry or some other genealogy site."

Digital images of death certificates can be found by searching here.  The certificates have a lot of information, not always reliable, depending on the knowledge/memories of the informants.  But it might be a place to start, especially if you know when and where Elizabeth died.  Her children's death certificates may have her maiden name.  There is a tree on ancestry which says that Elizabeth's maiden name was Elizabeth Louise Smeltzer from Goderich, Huron, Ontario.  That tree has no reference to another marriage and, indeed, offers no documentation for her marriage to Silas Reynolds.  I'd therefore take that with a grain of salt but it might be worth researching.  Arthur is identified in the census as Silas' stepson, so it's not unlikely that her first husband was, as you say, a Spencer.

On the 1880 census, a stepson named Arthur Spencer is living with them.  He was born about 1869 in Michigan.  Arthur may have been an illegitimate child, but it's also possible she had an earlier marriage to someone who's last name was Spencer.  I will keep looking and see what i find.  Looking again at Arthur on the 1880 census--his parents' birthplaces were Ireland (father) and Canada (mother).  Elizabeth has the same parents' birthplaces.  So two possibilities for Arthur.   He is Elizabeth's younger brother (they are 18 years apart in age). He is her son--that means that the father was an Irishman who lived in Michigan as of 1869."
Genealogy,2zvfyy,OxfordDictionary,2,Sun Mar 22 06:01:15 2015 UTC,"In the 1930 census, she is living with her daughter Ella.  It asks how old she was when she marrried, she says 16.  So now it seems more likely that Spencer was her married name, and we still haven't figured out the maiden one.   Her name is given as Elizabeth L Sharp, just as it was in 1920 census.  It says that she is naturalized (you could send for the naturalization record) and that she immigrated in 1874.  Yet we know she was married in 1870 and a resident of Midland, MI at that time.  (Plus the census saying her son Arthur was born in 1869 in Michigan).    Likely, 1874 was the last time that she spent time in Canada.  I had ancestors who I knew lived in the United States, but their immigration year on censuses is given as years later.  This is because they had gone back to the home country to marry girls from the home village, then came back to the US.  Maybe Elizabeth went back to Canada for a while to take care of elderly parents?

This is assuming you are in an area and researching an era where modern Death Certificates are/were used.   There is a chain of custody, basically, that a body goes through when handled from death to disposition. The Death Certificate will catalogue the steps of this.   There will usually be a line that is simply ""Burial, Cremation, or Removal"" with a place and date. You should also be able to get a funeral home, embalmer, crematory, and/or cemetery.  If you are looking at a time period before a modern death certificate, much more than 100 years ago or so in the U.S., then you may be out of luck.  This is the sample Death Certificate used on Wikipedia and is completely representative of the nature of the records I have come across.

The second source being if the remains are interred at a cemetery or memorial location, and the last being the records of the funeral service that did the cremation.

It really makes no attempt to explain why you might have certain results. Does my 22% Italian mean that I am part Italian or that some people in Italy are Arab?   Of all the possible regions, and the write ups that come with it, the section on the Middle East is horribly short and lacks any effort compared to the rest. They really offer no information of use. With the Italian connection it mentions historic migrations, breaks down demographics. With the M.E. it does no such thing, it focuses on Jewish Migration (its own category) and offers gems like:   While this area is better known for deserts or the Mediterranean climate along the coasts, you can actually ski at six different resorts in Lebanon.   It does attempt to connect you with others that show a high possibility of relation, but they almost always have no family tree (or its locked to viewing) and rarely respond if you message them.

'One-to-one' compare is the most helpful for this particular exercise, as it allows you to look at a specific kit in comparison with yours. It will then tell you if you match and what chromosomes you share DNA on, how many total cM of DNA you share, the longest individual strands, and how many generations you are from each other. People who match one or both of 2 kits - This is very useful if you have a known connection and want to see who else in Gedmatch has matched with both of you. So, as an example using my kits. Me, my mom, my mom's aunt (her mother's sister), and her cousin (that aunt's son) have all been tested, so if I run any combination of our 4 kits through this test I can be fairly sure that those matches will be on my mother's mother's side (I say fairly, because my mother and father are actually like 8th or 9th cousins, so they do have very distant matches to my dad's side!).   I personally have an excel sheet of my gedmatch 2-person comparisons that only shows the matches that have matched at least two of the kits I am managing or watching. I have colour coded them for my mom's mother's and father's sides, my dad's father's side (I have not had anyone tested on his mother's side yet), and yet another colour for the few people that have matched both of my parents sides.   It is then just a matter of emailing them, looking at each other's trees (infinitely easier when they are on Ancestry) or common locations and narrowing down possible shared ancestors.

Genealogy,2zp4qx,maryfamilyresearch,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:43:10 2015 UTC,"FYI, ""Einwohner"" in a rural area dominated by farming has a secondary meaning aside from ""resident"" that has been lost today.  In the 19th century there were different designations for farmers depending how much land a farmer owned and how much rights they had. (Their rights were associated with certain plots of land.) Words like Vollspänner, Hüfner, Huber, Halbspänner, Gütler, Kätler, Kossath, Gärtner, Einwohner are all relevant.   I cannot find a link at the moment for the exact definition of an Einwohner in Westpreussen in the 1890s, but I would guess that your ancestor probably owned a small house and a small garden for vegetables and maybe a goat and some chickens, but he had no land to farm and needed to work on other people's farms to make money and get by."

Start by look for specific events you know dates for, like marriages or births, then start reading the court recordings (they liked to mention all the lawsuits at the time).  Obviously, seeing marriage records at the courthouse for yourself is good. Sometimes they are not indexed, or are misspelled.  Finally, books in the genealogy section of the library.

Translation:  In the year 1884 on the twenty-fourth(1) of January, after the previous proclamation(2) (????), the signee married the unmarried teacher Alois Ullrich, born on 14 September 1859, legitimate son(3) of the farmer Magnus Ullrich and the Katharina née Stelzenberger(?) from Birkenfelderhof(?) and the unmarried Maria Manger from here, born on 15 May 1864, legitimate daughter of the house painter (limer?) Franz Manger and Elise née Deckert from here. Witnesses Valentin Schwarz from Hainstadt and Karl Ullrich from Hochhausen Buchen. 24 January 1884. Rachner(?) Pastor(abbreviated)   Sorry that I couldn't read everything. If you could provide additional photos of the upper-right area and maybe copies of other entries, I could give it another try. Usually the priests used the same formulation over and over again.  Notes:   (1): This word looks a little bit like ""eins"" which means ""one"", but the number twenty-one in German is ""einundzwanzig"". This could be a strange way to write the number. But I guess that the pastor's ""v"", ""n"", and ""e"" all look the same. (2): I think that he's talking about the publication of the intention to marry. There were some requirements to publicly announce when a couple wanted to marry. I don't know if this applies to your ancestors' region. (3): For unknown reasons Google Translate translates ""eheliches Kind"" to ""illegitimate child"", which is exactly the opposite. To make it clear, Alois was born from a married couple. (4): To me it looks like ""&unterzeichneten"" but the context would suggest ""Unterzeichneten"" (=signee). I guess the author has just a strange capitol letter ""U"". (5): I still cannot read this part, but the context suggests that it states where the marriage publication was published. In other records from french-occupied areas I saw terms like ""after the first publication on [date] at the mayor's office and the second publication on [date] at the city hall"". (6): My godness! Do you see where the ""i""'s dot is? (7): I couldn't find a place with that name. The ending ""-hof"" means that it is a farm. Could be that it doesn't exist today or that it isn't that far away from the town such that it deserves its own name. (8): Most likely the places are this Hainstadt and this Hochhausen (no English wikipedia articles). There's another Hochhausen in roughly the same distance in the east. But they don't mention different parishes, municipalities etc. so it should belong to the same (Mosbach) region.   Final note: Thank you for tagging your post with ""[German]"".

Genealogy,2zhm80,flaszlo,9,Wed Mar 18 17:35:08 2015 UTC,"I've been a regular user since discovering FS. It's probably been my primary resource, and I've tried to exhaust the records on it prior to turning to paid collections. I think that it's a real gift to everyone who wants to discover their family history. I use it for lots of stuff:   Find records via search Find alternate spellings (very helpful) Browse unindexed / church records (very useful stuff in there) to be able to provide a persistent link to a document / record to build a collaborative tree   Useful additions / suggestions:   easy entry of alternate spellings of an ancestor's name limitations on bad merges: some people see a ""proposed match"" and merge solely based on the computer telling them that maybe it's the same person, leading to some very poor actions. There needs to be a way to prevent this. I would suggest requiring arbitration before merging any profile with at least two citations.  private contact method / email forwarder / email masking. I'm reluctant to list my email on my profile, but I'd be willing to have something that could forward an email to me if a cousin wanted to contact me. Showing record suggestions on the main tree or in a separate page, not just the descendancy view or on profiles. The record suggestions are very helpful, but also mostly hidden / requires lots of searching. Addition of a next-record button. When browsing an indexed census where the ""household"" is not given, usually one can find a relative by going to the ""next"" record. I was only able to do this after figuring out the base-30 PAL in the URL... why, by the way, is that used!? It seems made to obfuscate things... poorly. Can you explain? Having a button to let one go to the next/previous record in an index would be helpful."

The only reason its not first is because I use Family Tree Maker to store my tree, and its easy to use the Ancestry hints to get myself started.  As soon as those hints are exhausted, I go to FamilySearch.    In going to FamilySearch I hope to find:   Images of original documents Possible alternate spellings or translation errors (the search on FamilySearch is more forgiving on alternate spellings) Un-indexed images to browse through in hopes of discovering ""genealogical gold"".

Even if it they need to go through some kind of committee or something before being added to the record, but it would be nice for those names that are commonly misspelled or transcribed wrong.  ""Shockey"" on handwritten documents easily becomes ""Shockley,"" ""Shackey,"" or ""Sharkey"" so I know I'm probably missing a bunch of people.  I've even come across people in the Censuses that aren't brought up in searches because of the spellings, despite all being from the same family and/or neighbors.   Also, the usability of your source box sucks!  I find it so much easier and faster to just bookmark the page to my favorites; from there I can easily rename the link as well as organize it into specific folders, organize them alphabetically, etc.   Your site is my No. 1 go to site followed closely by Find A Grave.  edit: Also, possibly some way to delineate collections that have had records added or new collections added in general?  I often go through past searches and find that some collections have grown, but I can't tell until I search through them again (and that's sometimes 100s-1000s of records).

Genealogy,2zhm80,Manhigh,3,Wed Mar 18 23:48:46 2015 UTC,"I know you can't do anything about this, but I use Family Search often, and it was much more helpful to me when you showed the images from Cook County, IL. For marriage certificates, the images would show the church at which the people were married or at least the name of the officiant. From there I could look at the marriage records of the church and see who the witnesses of the marriage were, because they were often relatives. It also gave the address at which the bride and groom lived.  For baptisms, I could find the church and the Sponsors, who were also relatives quite often.  Without the images, my research has been really hampered. I know the county gave you a lot more records if you took the images down, so that people would be required to pay $20 or whatever to buy a copy, which may not even be the correct people. I know for $7 or something I can have the reel sent to a Family History Center, but again, it might not be the right people, and no one has been able to tell me if the microfilm contains the images or if it's just a microfiche of text.  So I understand why you did it, it just has really stopped all my Cook County research."
Genealogy,2zhm80,ogrossman,2,Thu Mar 19 01:28:24 2015 UTC,Ancestry is also my primary method.  Like /r/Derevko I also use it for alternative transcriptions/indexing.

You could also allow users to  have access to the digital images of the Cherokee applications  to the US Court of Claims, 1906-1909:  https://archive.org/search.php?query=eastern%20AND%20cherokee%20AND%20applications%20AND%20mediatype%3Atexts  Additionally you could extend searches with the google newspaper archives."

I also consider myself fairly advanced at searching. I think FS's UI makes a lot of advanced queries possible in a way that paid sites do not. The primary feature I can think of that's missing is going from an image to the indexed records that link to it. That would be especially useful when you're forced to go through a census page by page. Also, I wouldn't mind being able to see more than 75 results per page. I used to just change it to 200 in the url but that stopped working a while ago. Finally a question, does the search for ""other person"" also contain the spouse and parent, or is it any relationship except those?

You guys have a TON of really good resources that ancestry hasn't touched yet. The problem is that they aren't indexed and have to be browsed manually. This is a big problem.  Keep doing what you are doing in terms of integrating source material with family trees on familysearch.org. I'm very impressed by the fact that search results are automatically noted as being ""attached"" to points of my tree - saves a major headache in duplicating source information on trees Similarly it would be helpful to have a feature whereby any source already linked to a familysearch.org tree can be excluded from returned search results."

At any point you can view anyone (deceased) in the tree by using the ""find"" function. For instance if you wanted to research the Degarmo Family line you could do a Find by ID Number: L4BR-YND and view Jacobus Villeroy Degarmo in the global Family Tree, even though he is not part of your Family (maybe).

If you can find that, then you can use standesamt.com to get in contact with archives around Germany.

Also, go get those pictures and stuff; they will most likely help you out. And if you get them, but you can't keep them, use a scanner to store the pictures.

It also has different templates that you can use and if you have any coding skills you can modify the templates to create a unique look.

The 1920 census said that Minnie and the kids came over in 1912, four years after Hyman. That allowed me to narrow the search a bit more.  A few more details from the manifest: Minnie's name is given as something like ""Meinder"" (possibly her name was Meinda or Minda). Her nearest relative in the old country was her mother ""P. Zielow???"" (I can't make out the whole surname.)  If you're going to do genealogy, you'll have to learn to decipher things like this. Transcriptions and indexes can be helpful, but are often incorrect. I've been doing this for a couple of decades, and (as you can see) I still get stumped.  Perhaps because of incorrect indexing, I have not been able to find manifests for Chaim/Hyman or Jacob. Hyman was naturalized in 1948, and his naturalization records should give his date of arrival and the name of the ship. You can order a copy here."

Genealogy,2zctik,taniapdx,2,Thu Mar 19 01:09:12 2015 UTC,"So there are a few things that you want to do to get started. First, make sure that you have connected your results to your tree and that you have as much of your tree available online as you can source. I would recommend having your tree public, or at least having a tree public, even if it only includes the stuff you can source beyond doubt. This will greatly increase the number of contacts you get from other users, as I know for me, I usually won't contact people without trees unless they have matched at either a very high rate or matched more than one of us (my mom and a couple of her cousins have also been tested).  I have also made a few 'templates' for contacting people, depending on if they have matched me, my mom, the cousin on her mom's side, cousin on her dad's side, or my great-uncle on my dad's side who was also tested. This letter includes info on my direct line, a few of our 'mystery' areas that we are hoping DNA will help us solve, as well as links to the gedmatch profiles for all of my known relatives. I have had so many contacts through doing this. Some don't go anywhere, but others have led to some great relationships with distant cousins (which is important to me).  Also, go through and check all of your 'hints' (inside the DNA tab) and see if Ancestry thinks it knows how you are connected to people. I would say my success rate with this has been in the 80-90% range. There have been a few where I knew right away that the suggested connection was wrong, but for the most part, the site's software gets this right. I then go an follow those lines as far down the rabbit hole as I can and once I have confirmed a connection, I always email the other person to share what I have found.  It's a great tool, and of course the more you use it and add to your tree the more 'circles' (a newish feature) you will start seeing, and these will help to show who among your matches have also matched each other. It's probably the feature I am most excited about in the past year or two of Ancestry's DNA project."

He appears to have married Climena Perkins in 1866. Climena was living in Chelsea in 1880 without children, and married Peter C. Cain later that year. She died in 1905.  His marriage record and some of his children's birth records say that Arthur was born in Norridgewock, but one gives his birthplace as Smithfield.  I have found only one confirmed child of Ephraim and Climena: a son Ora who was born about 1870 and married in 1895. I suspect that Arthur was his brother, and that both were taken in by other families after their father's death.

Your second point is a big problem that I'm trying to figure out a fix for. It's actually made me consider cutting out the ""connecting trees"" aspect of it all, but I feel like being able to do that helps in research so I decided to keep it.   The first step to preventing people from just wanting to connect would be to require proof from the person who wants to connect that you can compare to your own research to see if it's the same person. That cuts out people who just click connect based on a suggestion.  To improve suggestions, the algorithm that handles that process may have to compare documents that are uploaded to the profiles of possible connections. This brings up questions of privacy, however, so I'm not too sure if I'd want to do that. If I did, then I'd add to privacy settings the option to opt out of that process so that their documents aren't available for automated comparison."
Genealogy,2z6uar,camsta1905,7,Mon Mar 16 04:37:03 2015 UTC,"First of all, good luck with your project. One of the best ways to learn is by trying something concrete.  I'll share some of my experiences from the worlds of start-ups and genealogy:  Competition is plentiful. Geni, myheritage, wikitree, familysearch, etc., as well as many off-line products. To get users, you will need to provide something unique. What will make users choose your site rather than the other?  Genealogists are individuals with very different requirements and opinions. At some point you can not satisfy everyone. Maybe you should concentrate on the best features of your site, and make them really good, accepting that it will not suit everyone. Too complicated/too many features kills you by increasing the development costs to income ratio.  Do/invent as little a possible yourself. If someone already made the feature you want, use it. It saves you development time, and especially debugging time. Take a look at [http://www.tngsitebuilding.com/]. Spend your time (or someone else's) developing a visually appealing/intuitive/easy to use interface, and let TNG handle the database.  Do you want to cater to experienced genealogists or new users? Experienced genealogist have high requirements, are usually beyond online records, and mostly use their sites as cousin bait. New users requires online advertising, modern ideas such as gamification, and easy access to records.  /u/Gersthofen has the right idea. I would choose one feature and make it good. Interface it with the other sites and GEDCOMP uploads. A GEDCOMP based migration map has been on my secondary TODO list for a year, as I have a done manual ones a few times. I don't know if I'll ever actually make one, but if the service existed, I would use it right away."
Genealogy,2z6uar,camsta1905,7,Mon Mar 16 08:32:55 2015 UTC,"Jesus, I would use the shit out of this.   BUT: This is insanely ambitious, there's a reason ancestry charges the money it does. They have to pay for every archive they have on their site, they have huge datacentres to store all the user info and documents.  However, that is not to discourage you - if you have a long term goal and have a business plan set out etc I would be 100% behind this and will be happy to give constructive advice.  If you are just planning to build a gedcom upload/editing/design tool then I think there's already a lot out there that would be difficult to compete with, to be brutally honest.

Her death cert is Marie Stackhouse of Philadelphia 1916-1955. We have determined that she has been listed in the census as Eva Incarvite, Neva Hitchens, Nivia Incarvite and was using Marie Stackhouse at the time of her death. Her brothers are buried under the last name ""incarvito"". My mother was a ward of the state as her mother died when she was 5 and was sick before then so we don't have any real info although it has been requested from the state of PA. I have found the last living cousins and they are ignoring my emails :(  We can't find a birth cert or school info for her or her brothers (they are both dead but were not a mystery like she is!) I have scoured every document I have come across (which is how we know that she is the same person despite all the name changes). Is there anyone that can help?"
Genealogy,2z5ki7,loewinluo2,1 point,Sun Mar 15 20:05:07 2015 UTC,"To answer your question as best as I can-  She is buried in Holy Sepulchre cemetery in PA under the name Marie Stackhouse. Unmarked grave paid for by her mother Carmella Incarvito (according to direct contact with the cemetery) You can find her brother Jerry and his wife constance buried there with marked stones. We think her name is similar to Neva and may have been misheard in the census and also translated from written documents incorrectly. So it appears she went from ______ Incarvito to Marrying a guy briefly named Layton Hitchens so she got his last name for a bit (name on marriage license was spelled ""Nivia"" but that was short lived although we can't find a divorce cert. So then we see her in the 1940 census as Neva Hitchens. My mom's half sister was born in 1945 (she died about 15 yrs ago and my mom and her were estranged so she had no info either). My mom's sister was told her father's last name was Stackhouse. It is listed as my mom's last name at birth although she was always told as a child that it was not HER dads name, but her sisters dad. We can't find her married to any Stackhouse or anyone else after Hitchens so we think this may be an ""assumed name"". My mom was told from the family that fostered her (never adopted) that her mom was the black sheep which I can imagine as she had 2 kids by 2 different men while possibly being married to a 3rd.  The informant listed on her death cert is a Bert Stackhouse, but we have no idea who the heck that is and we are not even sure the relation if any or if it is a male or female. We have searched every lead we have had."

They lived on Morton St at the time and I gather were catholic as I know the catholic cemetery checks that stuff! Carmella was my great grandmother but I did see the weird name business where she calls herself Marie in that one census. I think they both have had Marie in their name. Go figure my mom's name is Marie and her sister was...you guessed it - Carmella! clearly they liked to recycle the same names!

Genealogy,2z4gbt,asciident,6,Sun Mar 15 14:06:47 2015 UTC,"In Sweden, patronymic names went out of fashion in the decades around 1900. Usually the names stopped being patronymic and became family names (such as Andersson today) or people chose new names. I don't know when this occured for emigrants to America, although I assume it happened when they arrived.   As to why you would change names away from Anderson, it might be boring to have such a common name. Many new names were influenced by nature, yes. Sometimes it referred to the place they came from, maybe an iron mine in this case? It could also be that they just liked the name.  The Swedish spelling is Andersson, yes, but many used more Americanized names. For example, Charles instead of Carl.  Women used -dotter in their patronymic names, this also stopped around 1900. The most common spelling would be Eriksdotter if this were earlier during the 19th century. I would spell it as it appears in the records, so Erickson. Going back further in time, names are usually standardized in Swedish genealogy, meaning an Erickson would be corrected to Eriksson. However, that doesn't really apply to the 20th century."
Genealogy,2z4gbt,Imperishable,4,Sun Mar 15 14:28:44 2015 UTC,"The patronymic naming system became confusing when the population started to increase more rapidly. It became difficult to figure out who was who and therefore countries like Sweden started to require (by law in 1901) people adopt a surname so they could figure out who was who. In the late 1800s and early 1900s people in Sweden started to take a surname. So people were already starting to adopt surnames in Sweden and if they hadn't already they would have when coming to the United States.  When people from Sweden emigrated to the United States they would often decide to change the spelling of their name to ""Americanize"" it a bit more and help fit in. Women would typically take one of the first names of their father and then end it with ""son"". So while a girl might have been born in Sweden with the name ""Maria Eriksdotter"" (her father being Erik) she would commonly have taken the surname Erikson, Erickson, or Ericson in the United States. They wouldn't typically double the ""s"" when taking a surname in the United States. So they would typically take ""Anderson"" rather than ""Andersson"".  Another thing to note is that when Swedish emigrants came to the United States and took a surname, it would typically be based on one of their father's first names, as mentioned above. It was common for people in Sweden to have multiple given names (what we would call the first name) but they didn't have last names. For example one of my Swedish emigrant ancestors was born as ""Johanna Sophia Eriksdotter"". Her fathers name was Erik Gustaf Andersson. It took me a long time to find her in the records because when she came to the USA she took the name ""Johana Gustafson"". So she took a surname based on her father's second instead of ""Johanna Erikson"" as I had expected. Here are a couple of references for additional info.

I guess this theory is basically about the black plague. The commoners all died while the aristocracy remained safe behind their walls, so they created a new generation to fill the gap left in the population. It's very logical, pure natural selection, and I guess nature knows what it's doing with population control.  i think it's enlightening to think about ancestry because it's a method of tapping into the collective unconscious. You can see the process of natural selection through human growth as a civilization. You can find what shaped human nature."

Genealogy,2z3ms0,Omega037,1 point,Sun Mar 15 06:25:41 2015 UTC,"As you can see here, William the Conqueror is a descendant of Charlemagne, so one leading to the other isn't strange.  However in the case of these kinds of historical records, you have no way of knowing whether it was really William's butler who was secretly the father or if there was a concerted attempt to change historical records to establish legitimacy of William by making him a descendant.  Given that recent studies have shown that when chosen at random, something like 10% of people's fathers aren't actually their fathers, the probability is very high that a tree going back 30 generations has some listings which were not true.  This of course is lessened greatly if it is a matrilineal line.  As for the connection to Millard Fillmore's grandfather, records in the US from the late 1700s onwards start to get pretty good (and by mid 1800s, very good), so it is very possible that this connection is correct.  Just make sure that the evidence isn't simply some other Ancestry/Rootsweb user's tree and has actual documentation (census, birth/death records, newspapers) backing  up each of the links."

It is interesting that some of these are from areas where people emigrated to Poland in the 1600s/1700s.   http://de.academic.ru/pictures/dewiki/72/HolyRomanEmpire_1618.png  Migrants were often catholics who (after having been under catholic rule) fell under protestant rule. The terms of the Peace of Augsburg from 1555 meant that the confession of the ruler dertermined the confession of his subjects. If the ruler was protestant, he could ask his catholic subjects to convert or leave. Quite a few went to catholic Poland rather than make the perilous journey across the ocean to the American continent."

Genealogy,2z0cfs,tflight,5,Sat Mar 14 14:20:46 2015 UTC,"My suggestion, and the common philosophy when starting genealogy, is not to start by researching on the web. Start first by writing down information that you know. Your parents dates of birth, their marriage date, etc. Then move on to your grandparents and again write down what you know. Then ask some close family members what they know-- write it down.  From there you can start researching online. The sites and techniques you use will vary depending on the location and time period you are searching, however ancestry.com and familysearch.com are common places to start.  Keep a critical eye on the data you retrieve and an open mind. Never assume the data is correct simply because it is in an ""official"" record. If something doesn't match your expectations work both to prove it wrong and to prove it right in order to uncover the likely truth.  And perhaps most importantly, write down where you found the information in a way that will help you find it again when you need to refer back to it. That is an area almost everyone wishes they did differently when they started. Don't worry about properly formatting source citations to any sort of academic standard, just make sure you or someone else would be able to go back and find the same information you found."

My father told me when I first started that I already knew more about his family than he did. The only thing I would add to the excellent advice above is not to stop searching just because you found a possible match. I remember being SO excited when I first found my paternal grandfather's birth record with his parents names on it that the person I added to my tree as his mother turned out not to be his mother at all. There should have been a number of red flags, but I was so excited about finding a ""match"" for this hole in my family tree that I let my enthusiasm get the best of me, despite normally being pretty cautious. Be guided by your reason, not your emotions. Realize that this will likely be a difficult puzzle to put together and that there is a distinct possibility that the first ""match"" you find might not be the one."

Likewise if they were living in the same proximity and someone in the household was working in some sort of a high ranking military or political position then there could be an ounce of truth to the rumor.

I will try to reach out to Philadelphia historical societies and the local libraries, as suggested above."
Genealogy,2yyjqh,Chestnut1,2,Sat Mar 14 14:46:02 2015 UTC,"I figured it might be another location to check out - is that where the Demings were from?  Also, I had no idea how many McGraths there were in Philadelphia at that time - wow. Do you have any information on siblings?"

Genealogy,2yx3mu,ogrossman,3,Fri Mar 13 18:49:33 2015 UTC,Just a heads up.  Some public libraries have Fold3 accounts that are free to patrons.  You might consider checking with your local library.  If they have the service be sure to bring a thumb drive to save any documents you find there.
