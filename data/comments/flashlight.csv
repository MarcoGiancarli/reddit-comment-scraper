flashlight,3e4ule,Bemo98,2,Wed Jul 22 05:15:17 2015 UTC,Sees good. How about the LM?
flashlight,3e4ule,kazamayy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:20:51 2015 UTC,I'd say around 900-950 lumens. It has surprisingly long throw too.
flashlight,3e4ule,Alvendam,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:48:01 2015 UTC,What batteries does it use?
flashlight,3e5ays,Rumzdizzle,4,Wed Jul 22 01:53:31 2015 UTC,"I think you will be satisfied with the Nitecore as they make great lights. A simple, 2xAAA tail clicky that is rugged as hell and will last you forever for $20 would be the Streamlight Stylus Pro."
flashlight,3e5ays,Jaunt_of_your_Loins,2,Wed Jul 22 02:26:26 2015 UTC,"Have the Stylus pro on my wishlist, prob use as a filler item sometime.  Only knock is the lack of a low mode, but I am in need of some flashlight for my new place so prob get one for nightstand."
flashlight,3e5ays,bob60626,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:45:03 2015 UTC,"It may be a dinosaur compared to newer stuff, but I -really- like the one I got my girlfriend. I put two Eneloops in it, slid it in the sheath, and put it in her purse. It's just the right amount of light for the scenarios she'd need a light for."
flashlight,3e5ays,emarkd,3,Wed Jul 22 03:58:14 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the Nitecore is a fine light because Nitecore makes fine lights, but I can tell you that the FourSevens Preon is definitely a fine light because I have one.  The anodizing that FourSevens uses on the Preon lights is almost sticky, like satiny, and just feels great in the hand.  Its also a bit brighter than the Nitecore but 30 lumens isn't a lot.  The bigger difference would be the emitters - the XP-G2 in the Preon would probably be a bit more floody than the XQ-E that Nitecore is using.  That's generally a good thing for close-up edc use, but if you want a bit more throw then then Nitecore will probably offer that.  But here's the big one - the Nitecore is only 2 modes and the lowest one is 32 lumens.  That's a lot for a low.  I'd much rather have the 2 lumen low the Preon adds.    Either light will be fine but I personally think the Preon is well worth the price difference."
flashlight,3e5ays,mcfarlie6996,2,Wed Jul 22 02:17:57 2015 UTC,"Good point on the low setting...  I am big on battery life.  My only concern is accidently activating the click on the preon, seems to be an issue.  However I have always wanted one because they are great lights, prob going to go ahead and pick one up, and maybe a preon 1 for edc due to twist top."
flashlight,3e5ays,emarkd,2,Wed Jul 22 02:22:55 2015 UTC,The XP-G2 that the Preon P2 uses is also more efficient than the XQ-E on the MT-06 if that helps reassure you any more. I'd also get the Preon P2. No question about it.
flashlight,3e5ays,emarkd,2,Wed Jul 22 02:49:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it could be accidentally activated depending on how you carry it.  But if that's a concern just leave it clicked on and use it like a twisty.  It'll work either way.  Or just get the P1.  It's a tiny little thing and honestly very bright with a 10440 in it.  Runtimes are abysmal with that cell though."
flashlight,3e5ays,emarkd,2,Wed Jul 22 02:52:35 2015 UTC,yeah I didn't think about twisting the p2 off as a saftey...  really like so many of the 4sevens though...  going to get the p2 but just saw the p1 in toxic green and that looks awesome.  Prob gonna end up buying 3 lights or so.
flashlight,3e5ays,kazamayy,2,Wed Jul 22 03:04:44 2015 UTC,FourSevens does make some great lights.  If you decide to buy both a P1 and a P2 be aware that they're completely modular and interchangeable.  You can screw the flat tailcap off of the P1 and it'll go right on the P2 to make it a full-on twisty.  Same for the head - they're identical on those two lights.  It's a good chance for you to do some neat color coordinating.
flashlight,3e5ays,Natanael_L,2,Wed Jul 22 03:09:43 2015 UTC,did not know that...  I think I would like a clicky p1.  Thanks!

flashlight,3e2w9h,emarkd,4,Tue Jul 21 18:13:55 2015 UTC,"This is the one I bought.  No idea if its a good one or not, but it seems to work well enough.  McFarlie and I are in the middle of doing some swapping around to compare numbers and see how close our meters are, but neither of us bought expensive equipment.

flashlight,3e2w9h,emarkd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:28:34 2015 UTC,Ah yeah that's the one that kept coming up at the top of my searches. Good to know someone else has it too.
flashlight,3e2w9h,emarkd,3,Tue Jul 21 18:29:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I bought it off of amazon reviews and recommendations too.  I don't know much about light meters so I just took a chance.  So far, so good.  The numbers I'm getting are pretty close to what is expect, so at this point I trust it.  It's probably not accurate enough for any really important work but for a little hobbyist poking around, it'll do."
flashlight,3e2w9h,mcfarlie6996,2,Tue Jul 21 18:43:53 2015 UTC,That's good to know! I suppose the main objective anyway is to see if there's a big relative difference between the manufacturer rating. Did you end up getting the caliper you linked to below? I read a bit more about it now too and I think that'll be a good choice for something to start with.

There are even cheaper ones on amazon but this one seems to have good reviews for a ”middle of the road” kit.  It's no Mitutoyo, but it should work nicely.

Not sure is one is better than the other.  Oh shit, I just noticed that it's digital to auto-input into the computer! The data cord is much much extra!  Was also thinking about buying this Temperature Gun Infrared Thermometer since I'm going to be including runtimes on Turbo for my reviews now."
flashlight,3e2w9h,mcfarlie6996,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:17 2015 UTC,"I've got an infrared thermometer gun and had considered doing some runtime tests.  Could be interesting.  Logging and recording all this data takes a lot of time though, especially if you're gonna add output at each time check."
flashlight,3e2w9h,emarkd,3,Tue Jul 21 19:13:32 2015 UTC,Well that's why I was hoping the Data logger would do most of the work so I could just set it and forget it because right now the only method I could think of would be taking data every 5-6 minutes or so on my light meter until it got to 10% of what it started at. I'd only record on Turbo and maybe the next lowest mode as long as I'm not expecting a runtime over 6 hours.

It meets all your criteria except budget and its not that far out of line there.  What else don't you like about the zebra?  Other than that, I really like the olight baton line.  And I don't think the magnets would be strong enough to screw anything up.  Leaving it stuck in an engine is another matter I guess..."
flashlight,3e2tn1,emarkd,6,Tue Jul 21 16:05:47 2015 UTC,"It's almost entirely the price tag. $70 is about as high up as I can justify spending, and that's already after a few leaps of ""well $60 isn't much more than $50,"" etc.   It's the best of the best, and it's tempting! I love the human element of the design, and I love the huge recessed button, and I'd love to be in the master race. But not at that price point, not just yet.   As for the light's performance-- nine times out of ten, I use my flashlight for less than an hour a day and very rarely is that hour spent lighting up beaches from balconies :)  I know you're trying to get me set up with the best, though, and hope I don't sound like I'm brushing off advice that I asked for in the first place."
flashlight,3e2tn1,emarkd,3,Tue Jul 21 16:22:13 2015 UTC,"No, not at all.  I understand, everybody's got a budget.  I hope you find exactly what you're looking for but I don't really have the knowledge to help you narrow down your list.  There's no bad lights on it though.  Someone with more hands-on experience with those lights will be along soon."
flashlight,3e2tn1,mcfarlie6996,3,Tue Jul 21 16:28:35 2015 UTC,"The biggest benefit besides the size is the 11 different possible brightnesses available to you. You pretty much never have to settle for an output like lights that only feature 5 brightnesses, if that makes sense."
flashlight,3e2tn1,emarkd,2,Tue Jul 21 16:33:15 2015 UTC,"It makes total sense. You tailor the brightness setting to exactly what the situation calls for, instead of being like ""well Ultra Medium Moonfire™ mode is a little bright here but it'll work.""   I actually first learned about the SRT series when it was on a group but deal right after I ordered my Foursevens and kind of regretted it, haha."
flashlight,3e2tn1,emarkd,4,Tue Jul 21 16:42:08 2015 UTC,"You tailor the brightness setting to exactly what the situation calls for, instead of being like ""well Ultra Medium Moonfire™ mode is a little bright here but it'll work.""    This is true of the SRT line but just so you know it doesn't get nearly as dim as the Zebralight.  My SC62w has at least 2 settings that are lower than the lowest output I can achieve on my SRT7.  I'm not trying to change your mind, just do realize that the SRT stuff has a minimum brightness and it doesn't taper evenly all the way to zero.  Once you hit a certain level (which is quite low, just not ""Zebralight"" low), it just goes off."
flashlight,3e2tn1,emarkd,5,Tue Jul 21 17:18:20 2015 UTC,"Yes! And to clarify, I got my orangereds mixed up and thought he was talking about the SRT there, not the Zebralight.   I love a good moonlight mode, but I don't have as good of an idea of what 0.1 lumens looks like next to 0.5 or 1.0. And I understand it's logarithmic so at that level it's quite a difference.    Most of the time I'm using moonlight mode I'm trying to avoid waking up my wife at home, or bunk mates on the road. If you were in a sleeping bay with eight to two hundred dudes in bunk beds, and had to dig through your backpack without waking them up, how many levels would you go for? What about just walking through your bedroom without tripping on dogs or waking your SO?"
flashlight,3e2tn1,mcfarlie6996,6,Tue Jul 21 17:31:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I saw what happened there.  Personally I keep my lowest setting on my Zebralight at 0.06 lumens.  It's perfect for poking around without waking my wife or checking in on sleeping kids.  The 0.01 setting is too dim to be useful to me but the 0.06 is just right.  The next step up, 0.4 feels about twice as bright in use but its still plenty dim that it probably wouldn't disturb anybody.  The 3.4 lumen mode is getting pretty bright and I wouldn't want to use it for nighttime stealth."
flashlight,3e2tn1,fluffman86,4,Tue Jul 21 17:50:07 2015 UTC,Just for some context (and forgive me for pressing for more info here!) roughly how far would you have to hold the light from a book to be able to read it at 0.01 lumens?
flashlight,3e2tn1,fluffman86,5,Tue Jul 21 18:16:32 2015 UTC,"Hard to say - my eyes aren't great to start with.  Id think a few feet for sure if you wanted to strain a bit.  Sitting here in this bright office I've got no good way to test it, even though I definitely have the little light with me like always, but I'll see if I can come up with a better test this evening."
flashlight,3e2tn1,mcfarlie6996,4,Tue Jul 21 18:20:20 2015 UTC,"You know, just knowing that 0.01 lumens is somewhat, barely usable at a few feet is good enough for me. No need to test it on my account, though it is appreciated!"
flashlight,3e2tn1,mcfarlie6996,3,Tue Jul 21 18:24:19 2015 UTC,SRT? I was talking about the SC62w.
flashlight,3e2tn1,mcfarlie6996,3,Tue Jul 21 16:45:53 2015 UTC,"Aw man, too many people being helpful here, haha. Didn't check the context.   I can see the benefit in that. I've read a little into the SC62w UI but not a ton-- at any given time, you have access to a handful of main modes and then user-programmed submodes for each of those, right? Maybe?"
flashlight,3e2tn1,mcfarlie6996,7,Tue Jul 21 16:53:00 2015 UTC,"Just watch this.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWJFQegalhU  You end up with 3 modes picked by Zebralight, 3 picked by you, all 6 of which are accessed in less than a second, plus your choice of a strobe/beacon mode."
flashlight,3e2tn1,mcfarlie6996,3,Tue Jul 21 17:12:58 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's what I thought. So you select three modes that suit your regular needs. It would be pretty rad to have low, medium, high, landing gear inspection, cockpit inspection, exterior inspection."
flashlight,3e2tn1,emarkd,4,Tue Jul 21 17:22:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you get that. 6 modes with instant access.   High:         H1 930 Lm (PID, approx 2 hr)   or    H2  577 Lm (PID, approx 2.5 hrs) / 326 Lm (3.9 hrs) / 149 Lm (11 hrs)  Medium:    M1 65 Lm (30 hrs)    or    M2   30 Lm (66 hrs) /11 Lm (172 hrs)  Low:         L1   3.4 Lm (16 days)   or    L2   0.4 Lm (2.5 months) / 0.06 Lm (4.6 months) / 0.01 Lm (5.5 months)  Beacon Strobe Mode: 0.2Hz Beacon at Low / 0.2Hz Beacon at H1 / 4Hz Strobe at H1 / 19Hz Strobe at H1  So High 1 is always 930, M1 is always 65, L1 is always 3.4.   The secondary modes are programmed. I have mine set to 149, 30, and 0.4.   Each group (H, M, L) has a memory of whether you left it in H1 or H2 etc.   So a single click from off gives me H2 at 149, double click while on in that mode is 930. Click to turn it off and back on and it remembers that you were in H1 instead.   Double click from off is M2 at 30, double click from there is 65.   Long press from off in this case is L1 at 3.4. Double click to lower the out put to L2 at 0.4. Turn it off and long press again and it stays in 0.4 until another double click.   Long press will also cycle the groups based on your preference. So if you last used H2, M1, and L2 it will cycle those three. Long press from any mode will automatically lower to your preferred mode in the low group.   Triple click from off takes you to your preferred strobe or beacon mode. I have mine set for fast strobe. Double click to cycle those modes.   Hope that makes sense."
flashlight,3e2tn1,Mongrel80,4,Tue Jul 21 17:42:02 2015 UTC,"Man. Do you ever just spend hours blinking that thing through all of its modes and trying to find the absolute perfect setup? Because I 100% would do that. On like a weekly and obsessive basis. That's my new answer as to why I can't get one.   If I'm reading that correctly, you have ""instant"" access to the Low, Medium, and High setting you used last and ""quick"" access to each mode's alternate setting of what you didn't use last, right?   And by ""quick"" I just mean there's one brightness setting you're stepping through to get there-- if I used M2 last and wanted M1 I'd double click into M2 and then again into M1? If that's the case, that's really well thought out. You'll never step through a brightness level that's radically different from where you're trying to go. All with one button.   Goddamn, that's so cool."
flashlight,3e2tn1,emarkd,4,Tue Jul 21 18:12:40 2015 UTC,"Adding to Fluffman's comment, the ""3 picked by you""(H2, M2, L2) are the ones you can customized/change to your preference which only take about 15 seconds."

Unfortunately there's really not really much of a selection for 18650 XM-L2 type lights that also feature a Red LED. Most are XP-G2 type lights which are still a great option but not the best type of emitter for close up work. As for micro USB lights, I'm not aware of any that feature a Red LED.   The only additional light I'd suggest is the Nitecore MH20 which should be easy to find the switch with gloves on. It also features quick easy access to Moonlight & Turbo."

flashlight,3e2tn1,mcfarlie6996,4,Tue Jul 21 16:37:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the EC21 would be a better option than the MT20C just because you have that instant access to the Moonlight mode also. It does lack the tail-switch though which is easier to find with gloves on but either way it look like it'd take two hands to access the shortcut modes because you have to hold the side button and then activate the tail-switch. Additionally,the EC21 would probably be your best option if you're for sure wanting a Red LED option."
flashlight,3e2tn1,emarkd,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, looking at the MT20c's UI had me envisioning holding it and having to do kind of a ""hang loose"" deal. I love and am used to forward clicky switches and momentary on, but I don't think that would cut it for me.   Thanks for the insight!"
flashlight,3e2tn1,Zak,2,Tue Jul 21 17:00:13 2015 UTC,"Also, thanks for bringing up LED types-- honestly, I've sort of glazed over that aspect and don't know much about it. So my understanding is that the XP-G2 emitters tend to have a more tightly focused hot spot and XM-L2s are a little more floody?"
flashlight,3e2tn1,Zak,3,Tue Jul 21 17:09:00 2015 UTC,"Pretty much yes. If you have both emitters at 400 lumens, the spill would be the same brightness on both but the XP-G2 would have a brighter, tighter hot-spot because of how the optics work on the smaller LED surface of the XP-G2."
flashlight,3e2tn1,Mongrel80,2,Tue Jul 21 17:17:38 2015 UTC,"I can see how that would affect up-close work, for sure. Thinking about it, though, most of my up-close outside tasks are looking at small chunks of a larger object at a time, like going down a wing and looking for missing screws or checking bigass pallets for secured straps so it wouldn't be a huge drawback. And I'd think in a low to medium brightness level in an enclosed space, the light would bounce around and disperse pretty well anyway.   Maybe that's me me rationalizing it though, haha."
flashlight,3e2tn1,Mongrel80,3,Tue Jul 21 17:36:32 2015 UTC,You're correct for the most part.

flashlight,3e2tn1,FivePtFiveSix,3,Tue Jul 21 18:17:47 2015 UTC,"Generally yes this is true, but the reflector design also plays a large role in the beam profile.  An XP-G2 can be fairly floody as well if the reflector makes it so."

flashlight,3e2tn1,BestLightStore,4,Tue Jul 21 17:38:35 2015 UTC,Have you looked at the Nitecore SRT series?
flashlight,3e2tn1,tonyhburns,2,Tue Jul 21 16:20:45 2015 UTC,"I have! I always liked that you could dial in exactly what setting you wanted your light to turn on in, as long as you had your detents memorized, but I'm a little wary of its one-handed operation for changing modes. I'd rather hit a clicky switch a couple times to cycle up to medium than try to hold the light and twist the bezel selection ring at the same time.   It would make a cool hiking light, I think, being able to signal your buds with different colors.  edit: looked it up, not the bezel after all"
flashlight,3e2tn1,tonyhburns,4,Tue Jul 21 16:31:00 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the smaller lights, but I have no problem using my SRT7 one-handed.  The light is easy to hold with most of my hand while spinning the ring with my thumb/index finger.  It's super smooth so it doesn't take much effort to turn."
flashlight,3e2tn1,tonyhburns,3,Tue Jul 21 16:37:41 2015 UTC,Really? I always figured the detents' resistance in the mode selection ring would be about on par with like a a clicky pen. Not super stiff but nothing I'd want to have to move laterally with my thumb. Not so much?
flashlight,3e2tn1,tonyhburns,5,Tue Jul 21 16:47:56 2015 UTC,"Nope, you can definitely feel them and they're solid, but not hard.  I hate to use such a cliche phrase but it really does feel like a ""well-oiled machine"".  In fact if it weren't for the much smaller size, I'd probably say the Nitecore SRT stuff is my favorite flashlight interface, even above my beloved Zebralight."
flashlight,3e2tn1,tonyhburns,4,Tue Jul 21 16:51:14 2015 UTC,"...That's pretty high praise for the SRT, coming from you!  I'll level with you, I have a minor little concern/misgiving with the SRT series. While you have the useful and unique advantage of being able to activate the light directly into any setting, you do so at the cost of always having to remember what setting you had it in last. I'd be compelled to turn the dial all the way to one side and then back it off into where I want it (or at least give it a good wiggle to ensure it was in the wider ""infinite adjust"" arc) to make sure it wasn't going to go off in strobe or something."
flashlight,3e2tn1,mmjpatient0912,4,Tue Jul 21 17:20:19 2015 UTC,"Yep, you're right.  I often do the same thing - check the setting before I click the tailswitch.  But that's assuming the tailswitch is even off.  There's a standby location in the ring too and it doesn't pull very much power in that mode, so I often leave it there.  On my SRT7 there's the added benefit of a tiny red led in the side of the head that blinks when in standby, which makes a good nightstand locator beacon for the bedroom.  So then I just have to pick the light up and click it either forward for white or backward for red and never touch the tailswitch."

flashlight,3e2khz,HedgeRunner,3,Tue Jul 21 13:49:40 2015 UTC,Don't recommend this light at all. Way too many twisting components and the interface is confusing as well. Only thing I like is USB rechargeable but I'll be buying a new light soon and throwing this in my backpack.
flashlight,3e2khz,tacticalzombie,2,Tue Jul 21 18:37:55 2015 UTC,"This seems to be an older model, honestly I don't think I'll recommend this over the P12 or the MH12. Anyone who has this light can offer comparisons?"
flashlight,3e2khz,mcfarlie6996,2,Tue Jul 21 13:50:10 2015 UTC,"My problem with it is that Strobe & SOS aren't hidden so when you're in the User Defined mode it goes Strobe, SOS, Low, Med, High, repeat. I dislike flashing modes and hate having to cycle through them. Also not a big fan of all of the twisting parts. Head twists, USB cover twists, tail-cap twists. I owned it for about 10 mins before putting it back in the box and selling it taking a small loss and got the UC40UE instead. But this is just my opinion and there's others on here who really like their MH2C."
flashlight,3e2khz,brandon7s,2,Tue Jul 21 14:01:44 2015 UTC,"I've had an MH2C for a few years and I'll agree with you; too much twisting, and having strobe+SOS in the standard rotation is just silly.   There's definitely better lights for the money, though I do like mine.. probably more of a sentimental thing than anything else though. It's my first REAL flashlight. It also has quite a bit of throw, though you could spend less to get the same throw these days."
flashlight,3e2khz,tacticalzombie,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:08 2015 UTC,I can't for the life of me figure out how to change modes on this light. Is it possible you give me a walkthrough like I'm a five year old?
flashlight,3e2khz,brandon7s,2,Tue Jul 21 20:15:15 2015 UTC,"Well, there's really only two different modes. Twisting the flashlight head all the way clockwise (I think it is that direction, don't have it in front of me) puts it in turbo mode. Now whenever you press the tail clicky you will get max brightness out of the light.   Then there's the ""normal"" mode. Unscrew the head of the light by maybe a 5th or so (you'll see the brightness change if you have the light switched on), and this will go into normal mode. Now click the tail switch on and off in quick succession. It will rotate between low, medium, high, and then strobe. Once you settle on a mode that you like for a few seconds, turn the light off. Wait about 3 second and then turn it back on. It'll start out on the last made you used instead of cycling, as long as you didn't press it on and off in a short span of time from each other.  That's really all there is to it. If you can't get the light to exit Turbo mode and go to normal, try unscrewing the light with your grip on different spots. The light has at least 2 different places it unscrews, and I think it may actually have a third. Gotta experiment to find the right locations to grip."

Cause there's no sub modes to cycle through there, right?"
flashlight,3e060a,undress15,2,Mon Jul 20 23:49:18 2015 UTC,Zebralight and Armytek need to just merge... My 2 favorite companies. Armytek's build quality and power with Zebralight's UI would be awesome.

I will say though that my zebralight has been extremely robust so far.  Its been beat, dropped (from tall heights, like ladders and such), thrown, covered in grease/paint/mud, submerged numerous times, etc, and never missed a beat.  I know Armytek claims a much higher shock rating in their specs which is awesome, but Zebralight is clearly doing a good job building a quality light.  But I do agree with you about the power.  There's nothing wrong with my SC62w for an edc, but zebralight doesn't even make a ""real"" thrower or any sort of larger light.  I'd be really interested in seeing them expand their product line."
flashlight,3e060a,undress15,2,Tue Jul 21 01:48:22 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree with everything you said. Normal people don't need anything much more robust than Zebralight. They are tough in their own right. I just have a thing for overbuilt/over engineered things. Plus they are 2 headlamp giants. At least to flashaholics. The coolest thing is that both companies are really young. Sky's the limit.

The ZL is rugged enough, and the UI is, IMO, far superior.  I do however wish that ZL made a wider selection of flashlights. The Armytek Dobermann looks like it has a good modest throw in a relatively small package. They are talking about offering it with a XP-L HI which should be terrific."

flashlight,3e060a,emarkd,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:24 2015 UTC,"It is indeed a fair bit of clicking. Takes a little bit of getting used to, but I think I won't even notice it shortly. The most difficult thing for me to do so far is to remember what mode I used last, so that when I single click after a while of inactivity I don't blind myself, haha.   I tried holding down the button after entering Max mode, but it seems like it just goes right back to main.  I just tried comparing beams from the Wizard Pro and my SC62d. The Wizard is a fair bit brighter, even considering that it has a lot larger flood angle and no hotspot. I wish I had a 62w to compare it to. The d model is not one I would have chosen for myself if given an option. It's only 320 lumens on max."

I'm an Electrician and have been working up above a grid ceiling in a 30k square ft retail store getting it ready for opening. This light was a must as the old headlamps I had were pretzels and energizer cheapies that just didn't cut the mustard. The I never really learned the user interface fully as I either didn't receive, or immediately misplaced the manual when I got the light.  I'll be honest, it took me quite a lot longer than I'd care to admit to figure out how to put the headband together. But once done, it fits great.  Generally speaking I'd or click the light on and hold down the button cycling through the three usable brightness settings I needed. Generally the low was ok for work within 3' of my face. Like Brandon mentioned, the beam spreads nice but not a lot of throw past 15' on max. That was generally good enough. I sometimes used my nitecore hammer to supplement the headlamp.  Anyways when using the lamp on high, the runtime was ok and would ramp it self down a level when the battery could no longer supply that level. A nice feature rather than going totally dark on me.  I recommend this light with a couple of spare batteries.  I have maybe 10 hours of use with this light.  Cons would be the band/ light can get warm and a bit heavy after some extended wear. Also, I have gotten the band dirty, washing it could be interesting on longevity. I think a mild hand washing would suffice. Does anyone know if replacements/ spares are available?"

flashlight,3dxjlj,joey_kayo,3,Mon Jul 20 10:36:57 2015 UTC,"Richard (RMM) for mtnelectronics.com is helping me out. I asked him about some recommendations via email. This was his response.  Hi Joey,  The smooth reflector will help with throw.  The ringiness isn’t usually too bad.  Dedomed is definitely the way to go.  A dedomed XP-G2 will give you maximum throw, at the sacrifice of some lumens, but a dedomed XM-L2 is a good balance.  For the driver I’d go for an FET driver which will maximize output.  If you want to use wire on the springs, I’d recommend going with some 24 AWG or thinner wire.  I really like all of the Arctic Silver products for thermal pastes, but remember that a little bit goes a long way.  I see most guys overdoing it with the paste.  You want a very thin layer of paste, since its job is to fill in the small scratches, not be the main thermal carrier.  Make sure when you do the build to also copper braid or wire the spring on the tail cap switch.  Thanks, Richard"
flashlight,3dxjlj,Zak,2,Mon Jul 20 15:57:12 2015 UTC,Even better than thermal paste is soldering the MCPCB to the pill.
flashlight,3dxjlj,fritzb314,2,Mon Jul 20 20:08:22 2015 UTC,You could use a new XP-L HI (high intensity) which is specified for up to 3A and a fet driver with about 5A. And soldering the MPCB to the pill won't work if it's not made out of copper (which I highly doubt).
flashlight,3dxjlj,Zak,2,Mon Jul 20 22:10:49 2015 UTC,"And soldering the MPCB to the pill won't work if it's not made out of copper (which I highly doubt).   It's brass, and soldering a Noctigon to it using a heat gun worked for me."

flashlight,3dxjlj,AbraKedavra,2,Tue Jul 21 00:08:01 2015 UTC,"this would be a possibility and has the advantage (depending on what you like best) that there is no PWM (puls width modulation). However, the output current is with 6 A too high but can be adjusted by changing a resistor. Otherwise just a Nanjg linear driver with some stacked 7135 ICs to increase the output current. I think around 4.5 A should be perfect, not too much since I think the heatsinking isn't the best and otherwise you might damage the LED. And you should make sure to use a copper PCB for the led. Intl-outdoor has some or you have a look if you can get sinkpads somewhere."
flashlight,3dxjlj,mcfarlie6996,2,Tue Jul 21 08:09:50 2015 UTC,"XP-G2, dedome, higher current, are maybe what you could start with.   I'm sure /u/chadzy and other people will have more.   EDIT:XP-G2"
flashlight,3dxjlj,AbraKedavra,3,Mon Jul 20 11:01:59 2015 UTC,"Just so there's no confusion, use the newer XP-G2 instead if you go this route, 15% brighter.     I made a Convoy S2+ dedomed XP-E2 @2.1A with a smooth reflector and tested it with a light meter getting 297 meters of throw. Not sure if using a XP-G2 would beat those numbers."

flashlight,3dxjlj,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:38:00 2015 UTC,"Sound like some pretty good numbers. Why the XP-E2 vs the XP-G2? Also, is 2.1A the max for the XP-E2? I read that the XP-E2 has a tighter beam, but I don't know how hard it can be driven compared to the XP-G2.  Just saw that you recommended the XP-G2."
flashlight,3dxjlj,mcfarlie6996,2,Mon Jul 20 12:10:03 2015 UTC,"Fuuuuu' ... I wrote this long comment but somehow got logged out in the process so it never saved... So lets try this again.  So I like to use this page for the graphs but you can't expect the same results because the does his test using a 1lb 25mm pure copper barstock which helps get these much higher numbers because the copper draws away the heat really quickly allowing the emitter to get amazing results. It's kinda like people jogging in cool temperatures vs hot temperatures. Our body can't perform as well when we're overheated, if that makes sense.   As you can see in the graph, the XP-E2 starts to plateau at around 2.4A which there wasn't much of a difference @2.1A so I kept it at that to get better runtime and I feel like it'd be risque to push it to 3A. I'm honestly not sure how hard you can push a XP-G2 but I wouldn't go much past 4A and I'm guessing you'd need to a quite a bit over 3A on the XP-G2 to match the throw results that I got on the XP-E2.   Here's a comparison of the difference in sizes between the emitters. You can see that the XP-E2 is smaller which helps make a tighter beam, especially with such a small reflector on the S2+."
flashlight,3dxjlj,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:34:07 2015 UTC,"I feel you. I've had that happen. Just know that I REALLY appreciate the knowledge you're dropping on me.   Man, it's tough. I see the XP-E2 is smaller which will help get a more focused hotspot and further throw. But I'm just not sure if the extra lumen output on the XP-G2 when pushed will outweigh the size difference."
flashlight,3dxjlj,mcfarlie6996,2,Mon Jul 20 15:51:29 2015 UTC,You'll get more usable spill using an XP-G2 but you'll need over 50% more power to it to get comparable throw which means shorter battery life on max output.
flashlight,3dxjlj,Chadzy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:01:31 2015 UTC,"Just to make sure I understand, I would need 3A on an XP-G2 to get the same throw as an XP-E2 at 2A?   Just keep in mind that battery life is not a priority. Just want to really push the led for the max throw. I will be using a high drain battery."
flashlight,3dxjlj,Chadzy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:10:42 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm not really sure without actually testing one. I'm just assuming that you'd need at least 3A.

You'll need good higher drain batteries and not your typical Panasonic NCR18650B 3400mAh types. Efest makes some good one.   ""As with all current-modded Vinh lights, you really need to use high-drain IMR/INR/Hybrid cells to see max output. The best performance that I saw was with an Efest IMR 18650 2500mAh (35A rated), supplied by Vinh. Frankly speaking, this is by far the most output I've seen in the 1x18650 class."""

This battery will easily handle the 3A which you wouldn't have the XP-E2 up that high and then you'd have max runtime with the high capacity cell.

I'm also still thinking about this light you mentioned. Seems like it would be a good amount of lumens and in a very small package! And I could save a bit of money.  Also would I get the 16340 battery for it or will my cr123 3.0v work just as good?

How urgently you want to do that will depend on whether you actually find yourself emptying the battery you have regularly.  As for the SC32 and EC11, I'm a lot more sensitive to width in my pocket than length, within reason, when carrying with a pocket clip. I would expect a 3.8"" light and a 2.9"" light to be pretty similar in terms of comfort. If you're not using a clip, a much shorter light might help.   Also would I get the 16340 battery for it or will my cr123 3.0v work just as good?   Do you want to use the light, or just keep it for emergencies. Buying CR123s gets pricey if you're actually using it, but they have excellent shelf life if you're not."

flashlight,3dw8a5,TFS_Jake,4,Mon Jul 20 03:20:38 2015 UTC,"Very few brands include the battery with the light, especially for 18650s, because they're not cheap. But they are very common.  You buy one charger and maybe a couple of batteries and you can run all your 18650 lights off the same setup. It's saves you money in the long run if you buy multiple lights, or other items that use the same type battery.    Does the nitecore come with all it needs for recharging, or just a cr123 that you'll have to replace when it's dead in two hours? (I bet neither)  And no, sorry, I don't have a helpful comparison.  They're both super powerful lights though."
flashlight,3dw8a5,emarkd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:24:48 2015 UTC,"That makes sense :). So I just remembered I have an extra 18650 that came with my Guardian 1300TL. I also have extra cr123a's. So that means I can get the Nitecore e11 or the sc62w correct? :D  It says cr123 for the nitecore, will the cr123a work?   Also I'm guessing your recommendation is the sc62w between the 2? If my battery will work with it I think i've decided my purchase :) Hopefully this will be a comfortable pocket light  Edit: looks like the e11 uses 18350 also.

Totally different battery.   Also note that the 18350 IMR battery in that deal is 700 mah. An 18650 battery is up to 3400 mah, so you get more than 4 times the runtime. Edit: double checked. Nitecore lists the EC11 runtime with a 700 mah 18350 at 30 minutes on the 900 Lumen mode. Zebralight lists the SC62w runtime at approx. 2 hours.  You'll get a little more runtime on the EC11 if you use CR123 batteries (same as CR123A), but at the cost of reduced output and the cost of batteries (they aren't rechargeable). There's also RCR123 batteries that might give you a decent compromise.  But yeah, either way, I prefer the SC62w - it's a bit longer, but it's a bit thinner, has a better (IMO) interface, and it definitely has a better tint (neutral white vs. cool white on the EC11)."
flashlight,3dw8a5,JimTokle,2,Mon Jul 20 04:44:43 2015 UTC,"Ok thank you for clarifying that! So this will set me up with the correct battery for the max lumens?   Seems like a great package deal. I like the SC62w but I think I'm going to have to go with the nitecore due to its length and the red LED mode is great for me at night. And I could also try using it at lower lumens to save battery a bit. But battery time shouldn't be a huge deal, it should last me a long enough time to where if I really needed another light, my backpack would be close, probably in my truck.   Conclusion: I really want that amazon package. Is that going to set me up with everything I need?  Thank you all for your amazing help"

flashlight,3dwuy3,sam_j978,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"Never charge over a 1C rate if you want to have the max life of your battery packs.  From my experience with r/c cars and airsoft guns, when it comes to your battery packs, anything over a 1c rate typically will create a lot of heat which is bad for the batteries.  The easiest way to figure out what 1C rate would be is to take the capacity of the battery in mAh and convert that to Ah, then just look at the number you have left.  That'll be the max rate you should charge that battery / pack at.  So if you had a 2500mah battery... convert that to 2.5Ah, drop the ""Ah"", and you have 2.5 as your 1c rate.    Since I have an electrifly trition 2 EQ charger that I use for my hobby batteries, I use it for charging pretty much everything (Li-poly airsoft / rc car batteries, NiMH AA & AAA batteries, and Li-ion 18650's).  The beauty of it, is not only to I have a charger that does everything for nearly every battery type I have, but it also lets me gauge the health of the battery by showing me the amount of charge (in mAh) that it was able to put into the battery.  I realize a solution like that might not fit the bill for the OP, but others out there might have overlooked adding a charger like this, that can be used for a various other things that might need to be charged."

Also, most of these chargers need a 12v DC power supply.  I just modified an old computer power supply with banana plugs to hook up to power the charger.

However, I am not quite as keen about the twisty + soft press UI on my Eagtac D25LC2 that also came on Friday, but my gripe there is less about the twisty and more about the zillion strobe modes that are always at the end of two cycles through the regular modes. I'd prefer those modes to be super hidden like they are on the MX25."
flashlight,3dvpa1,mcfarlie6996,2,Sun Jul 19 22:46:59 2015 UTC,Can you walk us through the UI on both of those lights? I'm curious how they vary between each other.
flashlight,3dvpa1,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:28:01 2015 UTC,"Sure! Here's the basics on both:  MX25L3C  The UI for the MX25L3C is divided into two groups. The main group, which is turned on by default, just has four levels, divided into tactical mode and regular mode. You switch between tactical and regular mode by going to the highest level, and then adjusting back and forth between that and the next level down 10 times within 5 seconds. These are the levels for the main group:    Tactical Regular    1810-1545 1810-1545   760 760   Strobe 1 145   Strobe 2 19    The automatic stepdown from turbo happens after 200 seconds, but you can make it only step down by 10% instead of 25% by first going to the lowest level, and then shifting back and forth between the next level up 10 times within 5 seconds (see the pattern here?).  Another nice feature of the main group is that you can momentarily access turbo from any of the other levels by pressing and holding the switch (the light will return to whatever level you're rotated to once you disengage the switch).  The auxiliary group is accessed by going to the highest level, and then down to the lowest or second level within 1 second. Doing this repeatedly will cycle through a bunch of auxiliary modes: Strobe 1/2 -> Hi-Flash -> SOS 1/2 -> Beacon -> Lo-Flash  I don't have much use for any of the auxiliary modes, or the tactical mode in the primary group, so the regular mode with the four levels is something I can just leave as is.  D25LC2 Clicky  As with the MX25L3C, the D25LC2 has two mode groups, which are access by loosening or tightening the head. Once you have the mode group selected, the rest of the UI is via soft-press of the rear clicky switch.  In the first mode group (head loosened), the soft-press sequence is: Low -> Med -> High -> Low -> Med -> High -> Strobe (I/II) -> S.O.S.(I/II) Beacon -> Low-Flash  As you can see, the sequence for the flashy modes will always be inline after two sequences of L>M>H, which is 5 additional modes you have to get through to return to Low.  One neat thing about the D25LC2 is the moonlight mode, which you can toggle by loosening and tightening the head 3 times in quick succession. This mode lowers the output of every level in the first mode group.  The second mode group (head tightened), appears to be for tactical purposes and is just: Turbo -> Strobe."

It's my current favorite light with a tail clicky, but it doesn't give you instant access to low and high modes. Instead, it uses a second mode button near the front of the light to change modes and cycle between 1, 70, 240, and 1000 Lumens. It's currently $44.41 on Amazon. See these two links for more:  The ultimate tail clicky with a mode button light comparison  My thoughts on the subject  The P12 and MH20, like all nitecore lights, use a cool white emitter. If you're going to be camping and out in the woods, I'd suggest looking for a Neutral or Warm white emitter. In that case, my current favorite light that I both EDC and set on the nightstand each night is the Zebralight SC62w. You can see my thoughts on that light in the thread linked above, as well."
flashlight,3dw1br,fluffman86,3,Mon Jul 20 02:36:43 2015 UTC,Thanks.  The Zebralight is nice but quite a bit more $$$.
flashlight,3dw1br,fluffman86,4,Mon Jul 20 03:36:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, just saw you had trouble finding the button on your Olight. If that's the case, then you'd definitely be able to find a tail switch on the P12, but the mode button is going to be just as hard to find.  I think the MH20 button would be a bit easier to find. Looks like it's a bit bigger and bumpy so it should be pretty easy.  And yeah, the SC62w is $85, but they are based in the USA so you deal with their Texas office if you need warranty work. Nitecore is based in China and warranty claims are handled through authorized dealers.  Honestly, there aren't a whole lot of 18650 lights that I'm aware of that give you direct access to moonlight and turbo. Those that do pretty much require an electronic switch, and that usually isn't placed in the tailcap.   Other options are the Nitecore EC20 for $40-something - it's the same as the P12, but instead of a tail switch it has just the mode button. That'll be almost as hard to find as the Olight S-series - maybe even harder.   The two best options right now (that I'm aware of, and hopefully somebody will prove me wrong) are the Nitecore MH20 and Zebralight SC62w. The SC62w has a deeply recessed button that's easy to find (it's always opposite the clip) and the MH20 has a nice looking, raised, large button as well. If you got the MH20 on sale, that's awesome, but its normal price is pretty comparable to the SC62w and at that point I think the SC62w has the better interface and better bang for your buck.   Now if you gave up the choose-your-own-mode requirement, things get a lot simpler since you aren't dealing with an electronic switch anymore and a simple tail switch would work. In that case, you could get something as inexpensive as a Convoy S2 for $15-20 and have it customized to always start in Low mode or High or have a memory, and the price just goes up from there.  Oh! And then there's the Nitecore SRT series. Just saw an SRT5 on Amazon for $64. It uses a selector ring so the output is infinitely adjust from low to high, and you can set it before turning it on. The SRT series is normally way out of budget, though."

About the ""reverse clicky"", OP. I don't think any reverse clickies exists that you'd have instant access to a Moonlight & Turbo but I believe that's a couple Forward clicky lights do exist that have instant access to these modes. I'll try to find these few rare lights if you're interested but it's much easier to find lights with side switch that have instant access to Moonlight & Turbo like the Nitecore EC11, EC21, & EC4, and the MH20. Other brands light the Olight S20 & S30 are similar to where they have shortcut modes to get to the modes.

The community here seems a bit more accessible and accepting though, so I really like it here best.  But the issues you describe are really a result of the different website technologies.    Reddit was originally a link-sharing service but happens to have a good commenting system in place that we can use for discussion, so its become a lot more than its original design.  I maintain that the search here is also absolutely terrible.  CPF is a traditional vBulletin forum.  There are millions of them spread out all over the internet because its free software that anybody can use to open their own forum website.  They're really fine for most forum-type activities but I've always hates its lack of threaded conversations.  You really only get one main line of communication and if you don't keep up with things long discussion threads get very cumbersome.  I'm really not sure what BLF is built on (Drupal maybe?) but its another traditional linear forum.  Some of us older guys who've been hanging out on Internet forums since nntp was still a popular way to communicate are just used to them, I guess."
flashlight,3duz7z,storl,6,Sun Jul 19 19:35:11 2015 UTC,"I like the ability of forums to handle long term conversations.  How many times do you see conversations go on for months or years on Reddit?  That's the norm on cpf.  You can find the thoughts from people on a particular light back to when it was first announced, let alone actually released.  Both formats have their uses.  If you don't like search, make sure you search the appropriate forum only instead of the whole site and search title only.  You'll get a lot better results."
flashlight,3duz7z,emarkd,4,Sun Jul 19 20:15:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is nice how folks tend to keep things better organized on those old-school forums.  That's a matter of the way the community behaves though - there's no reason Reddit couldn't be used the same way, but I do think the way threads are sorted here algorithmically instead of chronologically does have an affect on behavior.  There are some huge, long threads on Reddit though, so the underlying software would easily support those super long threads like on cpf or blf if us users used it that way.  My biggest gripe with reddit search is the way results are returned.  It really does a terrible job ranking those results before displaying them.  Old stuff is often emphasized above more recent results, which makes no sense for the way content on this site is created."
flashlight,3duz7z,mcfarlie6996,2,Sun Jul 19 20:40:38 2015 UTC,"I like the ability of forums to handle long term conversations.   That is actually the best part of it because we've had several times here that OP or another will look for additional information on the post that's 2+ days old and it's going to be rare if anyone sees it. I know I've told people to create new posts because otherwise I'd be the only one commenting on the comment/topic and I'm pretty sure /u/fluffman86 advised someone one too recently.   BUT, I wish there was a way to filter that also so I can only see newer posts and not some thread that was started years ago."
flashlight,3duz7z,emarkd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:34:29 2015 UTC,"Odd. I don't mind the forum setup one bit. In fact, I navigate a couple of them on a regular basis and somewhat enjoy them. I guess part of my problem may be I am not very familiar with the subjects I am researching, unlike the other forums I visit."
flashlight,3duz7z,AbraKedavra,2,Sun Jul 19 20:55:20 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to give the impression that I minded an old-school linear forum because I don't.  I do like threaded conversations though, so that multiple lines of thought on a subject can be discussed together.  If you and I were having this discussion on cpf if would be intermingled with my discussion thread with /u/storl which isn't quite as nice - perfectly functional, but a bit more cumbersome in my opinion.  Maybe I misunderstood your original issue though."
flashlight,3duz7z,JimTokle,2,Sun Jul 19 20:59:25 2015 UTC,"You know, I've sort of disliked reddit because of what you're talking about, but now I understand how it's meant to be used because of your example. Thanks for that!"
flashlight,3duz7z,mcfarlie6996,3,Sun Jul 19 21:04:23 2015 UTC,"I know I started out on CPF.  Both BLF and CPF are treasure troves of information, but yes, the sorting/order of posts sucks, and so does the search."
flashlight,3duz7z,JimTokle,4,Sun Jul 19 19:55:29 2015 UTC,"I visit them for information, but don't have accounts there. The people on CPF seem pretty uptight. Saw some guy get threatened with a ban for joking about strobing his ex-wife. Doesn't seem like my kind of place, other than the vast amount of information."
flashlight,3duz7z,Ishango,4,Sun Jul 19 21:05:32 2015 UTC,Well we wouldn't ban you but we'd strongly discourage any strobing of anyone else. We had a post a week or two ago of someone wanting the brightest strobe light so he can shine it at his neighbors when they're trespassing and pretty much no one helped him and commented how they discourage that type of behavior. You guys are awesome!!
flashlight,3duz7z,Chadzy,2,Mon Jul 20 00:38:30 2015 UTC,"I totally understand discouraging that behavior, and I would never condone it myself, but this guy was just cracking an obvious joke about how he strobed his ex-wife. And a mod threatened him with a ""vacation from CPF"". I'm sorry, but some people need to lighten up."
flashlight,3duz7z,mcfarlie6996,2,Tue Jul 21 00:35:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I frequently visit CPF, but mostly on Tapatalk. There's a wealth of information there and personally I don't have any difficulties navigating their site."
flashlight,3duz7z,Spaced_Inv8r,3,Sun Jul 19 19:14:15 2015 UTC,BLF suits me much better. Recent posts is really all you need to look at.

flashlight,3duz7z,fluffman86,2,Mon Jul 20 00:40:15 2015 UTC,"Oh boy... So now Reddit is the way an internet forum should be sorted and searched?  I've been a member of many internet forums over the years and they all basically operate the same way.  I find them easy to navigate... sometimes they're a bit of a pain to search, but I much prefer the chronological format versus the Reddit format.  Reddit isn't easier to search- but it might be unfamiliar if you've never been a member of any internet forum other than this one.  Threads seem so ""of the moment"" here, that any long form discussion is pretty much discouraged.  You often have to search over dozens of threads to find information you want because posting on old discussions yields little benefit.    I dunno, I understand that it's different and things can be resorted- but I don't have to like it.  As far as the merits of searching the two sites in question.  I prefer CPFs search function over BLFs- but that shouldn't be a reflection of which site I prefer."

flashlight,3duz7z,hermeslyre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:02:43 2015 UTC,Hello!
flashlight,3dupt7,SaintZvlkx,3,Sun Jul 19 17:40:27 2015 UTC,Well did you like you LD10 because the LD11 is the upgraded version of it from what I can tell. I'm a little disappointed though that they got rid of the 13 lumen mode on the new version but they did add a 300 lumen mode for those who have 14500 Li-ion batteries.   Additional possibly better options would be the Thrunite T10  which honestly looks quite attractive with how slimline it is. 3 pretty nice modes with the lowest being quite dim at 0.3 lumens.   Next we have the L3-Illumination L10 which I'd definitely get the 4 mode option with the added moonlight mode.   And last but what I think is the option is the Thrunite Archer 1A V2. 4 modes with an XP-L emitter which is going to give highest efficiency in its class.
flashlight,3dupt7,mcfarlie6996,4,Sun Jul 19 18:07:55 2015 UTC,I almost feel obligated to recommend this although it's a little outside your requirements. The Zebralight SC52w would be an excellent option too because of the compact size and ridiculously amazing User Interface. 6 instant modes plus 5 additional modes to reprogram that takes less than 15 seconds. I have H52Fw and love the variety of different outputs that I can choose and program to my liking. It's a side switch and a little over your budget but it was worth every cent to me. You're looking for an EDC? This is it!
flashlight,3dupt7,mcfarlie6996,4,Sun Jul 19 18:18:29 2015 UTC,"It's so hard not to recommend them, isn't it? ;-)  And for another bump in price, there's the SC62w. Same size head, slightly larger body, but it takes an 18650 rechargeable battery so you get much longer life and up to 930 Lumens. I leave mine set at 140 for high (which is what you asked for) but it's nice to be able to jump to 930 when needed.   I carry it in the 5th pocket on my jeans so it's really tiny and powerful. I also keep the low modes set for 3.4 and 0.4 Lumens which are great for poking around the house at night, and at 0.4 I can shine it right at my kids while they're sleeping and not wake them.   https://i.imgur.com/6JNmbY1.jpg  Tagging OP /u/SaintZvlkx"
flashlight,3dupt7,fluffman86,3,Sun Jul 19 18:28:07 2015 UTC,with a super low mode as well.   That's a quote from OPs post.  Is there even another light on the market with the sort of super low moonlight modes zebralight offers?  Nothing comes to mind.  The SC52 may be slightly over budget (only by $9) but its definitely a strong contender for what he wants.
flashlight,3dupt7,emarkd,5,Mon Jul 20 00:47:19 2015 UTC,"Well.... how low of a low can you go before it's just too low to know?  Lol, ZL's lowest is hardly recognizable but even the last 3 lights I linked are 0.2 lumen and less. But... I do love the rest of the modes/features on the ZL. I have mine set to H1: 475 Lm / H2: 102 Lm; M1: 47 Lm / M2: 11 Lm; L1: - 2.6 Lm /  L2: 0.32 Lm (sometimes 0.06 Lm). I find this the perfect setup where it gradually gets brighter."
flashlight,3dupt7,mcfarlie6996,3,Mon Jul 20 01:20:47 2015 UTC,"I think you convinced me! Just picked a SC52w up. Looked into the SC62w as /u/fluffman86 recommended, but I already have a high-lumen light (Nitecore MH2C) and even the SC52 is getting a little too large for easy pocket carry alongside all the other crap I have on me. Plus I do like easily available batteries. The sheer amount of mode customizability of the ZebraLights seems a little daunting, but I'll hold off judgement until after I've had a chance to test it."
flashlight,3dupt7,mcfarlie6996,3,Mon Jul 20 01:49:09 2015 UTC,I used to be really sceptical of the UI on the Zebralights with its 6 modes plus 5 programmable modes but working 15 mins of playing with the light I perfected how to use it and can reprogram modes writing 15 seconds. So easy and so convenient. Zebralight deserves a medal of awesomeness for that! My only regret was not buying it sooner.
flashlight,3dtpuw,patriotik,5,Sun Jul 19 10:51:46 2015 UTC,"If you liked the 52, just get the 62. No reason to talk about any other lights, imho."
flashlight,3dtpuw,TFS_Jake,3,Sun Jul 19 11:42:03 2015 UTC,"I'm seeing a trend here. Currently at the top of my list. The H600w Mk II is looking nice too, for climbing at least. May end up getting the pair."
flashlight,3dtpuw,fluffman86,4,Sun Jul 19 11:58:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah sounds like you want the 90 degree version.   SC62w is a normal flashlight.   H600w is a 90 degree light with essentially the same beam pattern as the sc62w or maybe the SC600 mk II.   H600Fw is the same as the above but with a frosted lens for a floodier beam and smoother transition from hot spot to spill. You don't get as much throw with this.   H602w is a 90 degree light with no reflector so you get all spill and no hot spot. You don't get much throw with this at all.   I already have the sc62w so I'm leaning towards the H602w. If you only want one light that does it all then either the H600w or Fw would be a better choice.   Edit: if you're looking for tough as nails, check out ArmyTek as well. I love love love my Zebralight but ArmyTek is tough."
flashlight,3dtpuw,fenrisulfur,2,Sun Jul 19 12:26:35 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll check it out. Needed a good rundown of ZL models like this.
flashlight,3dtpuw,emarkd,3,Sun Jul 19 12:37:39 2015 UTC,"I myself am incredibly happy with my H600w MkII. I had a ZL AA 180 lm and the difference is astonishing.  Although it is nice to have access to 1000 lm I like the 300 lm option, you also get 4 hours of runtime out of a pannie 3400 mAh, that is completely true.  The low mode is really good as well, I use the next lowest to check on my kids in the dead of night I can shine it on their faces without them noticing it.  One thing as well, the headband is very comfortable as you get a band over the top of your head, I have had mine on for nearly a day and in the end I stopped feeling it, made me look like a fool when I went grocery shopping with it on my head by accident.  P.S. I am not a ZL rep, just an avid fanboy."
flashlight,3dtpuw,emarkd,4,Sun Jul 19 22:57:01 2015 UTC,"I was incredibly happy with it   I've already expressed my love of the SC62w in another comment here, but if you don't mind, what happened to your '52? Did you lose it or did you manage to break it?  I'm just curious because (excepting one defective unit) I don't think we've ever talked about a broken zebralight around here.  I don't work in an extreme environment like you seem to but I've been pretty hard on mine at times and it just keep going.  I'm curious just how much abuse they'll take before they give up."
flashlight,3dtpuw,Zak,4,Sun Jul 19 12:38:46 2015 UTC,"It stood up great. I hauled it with me everywhere. We use bicycles where I live, and I was hauling my kit home in a bag in a pretty heavy storm. The bottom of my bag came apart, and my light either wound up covered in mud or in someone else's pack. Never saw it again. This was a year ago, and I've been frustrated and making due with terrible mini maglites since. I miss that light every day. Ready for a new one."
flashlight,3dtpuw,brandon7s,4,Sun Jul 19 12:46:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry you lost it but I'm glad to hear it never really failed you.  Honestly if you loved that light you'll absolutely adore the SC62. And since you've already got 18650s its a no-brainer.  I carry my SC62w in my back pocket every day of my life and would be lost without it, too.  Let us know what you decide."
flashlight,3dtpuw,mcfarlie6996,2,Sun Jul 19 12:51:27 2015 UTC,"making due with terrible mini maglites since   If you want some cheap spares that run on 18650s, look at the Convoy S-series: budget flashlight starter kit."
flashlight,3dtpuw,Zak,5,Mon Jul 20 19:18:25 2015 UTC,"Everyone here is recommending the ZL SC62, and for good reason. I would bring another light to your attention though: Armytek Wizard Pro. It's a 90 degree angled flash light, headlamp style, and very similar in specs to ZL's offerings. The main reason I mention this light is due to its more strenuous fall rating of 10 meters. I think it has better waterproof rating as well, though I'd have to double check on that.  It is tough to beat Zebralight's UI though, and since you already are familiar with it I think the SC62 or one of the headlamp variants would be a great choice."
flashlight,3dtpuw,mcfarlie6996,4,Sun Jul 19 15:15:09 2015 UTC,"Came here to recommend Armytek as well. This brand offers the highest impact rating(10m fall) and highest IPX-8 rating(10m submersible) of any brand(if you don't include dive lights). The Wizard link is a great flood light which is perfect for close quarters.   If you're looking for something with a little more reach then check out the Partner Pro which has 188m of throw. Also has a tail-switch for Momentary/On&Off and a side switch for the modes.   If you're interested in even more throw, the Viking Pro offers 370m of throw. Also this one has and even higher rating:  ""highest IP68 dust- and waterproof standard —  more than 5 hours at 50 meters depth; Reliable body — stands up the recoil of any gun gauge and falling from 30 meters height."""
flashlight,3dtpuw,mcfarlie6996,3,Sun Jul 19 15:38:01 2015 UTC,I'm really starting to lust after the Partner Pro. Thermal regulation. Daylight tint. No PWM (I think). More claimed abuse-resistance than pretty much anything else on the market.

flashlight,3dtpuw,Zak,3,Tue Jul 21 12:04:31 2015 UTC,"Can I inquire as to why you want a replaceable LED? Their lifetimes are so long it's almost irrelevant.   Anyway, how about the SC52's big brother, the SC62?  It's small, 18650 powered, bright, great UI, well rounded levels and sounds like what you need."
flashlight,3dtpuw,Dc5e,2,Sun Jul 19 11:09:01 2015 UTC,"Only because I wasn't aware that they had a long lifetime. If that's the case, then it doesn't bother me if they're not field replaceable. Previously, my style of purchasing things that I depend on is to find the unit I like, then buy components to support it at the same time. Looks like that's not needed here. I'm a few weeks away from the States by mail, so I try to stock replacement parts if they're needed.   Thanks! I'll look at it."

flashlight,3dtpuw,Zak,4,Sun Jul 19 11:19:31 2015 UTC,"LEDs don't fail suddenly unless they're defective, in which case they fail almost immediately, or they're subjected to extreme overvoltage or overcurrent. If the latter happens, your light has bigger issues than a dead emitter.  LEDs do lose brightness over time. Most Cree emitters are rated for 50,000 hours until they only put out 70% of their original output. After a full career of using your flashlight 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week for decades, you may notice it's slightly dimmer than when you got it. Continue for a lifetime and it may eventually fail. A replacement emitter will correct this problem."

This light makes an awesome candle!   then:   This light can't tailstand!   Seriously? I get it if you want to make a really proud button. That's perfect for a super tactical light. The Nitecore P10/P20 does that well. This light looks like it has a great tactical button, but this look way more like an EDC light.   Secondly, why won't they let the light stay in moonlight mode? If I want moonlight, I don't want to start the light in the second lowest mode, move UP to an even BRIGHTER mode, then move down to the actual lowest. Were they even thinking when they designed that?  The twisty head to adjust the brightness is fine. Maybe not as smooth as the magnetic ring on an SRT, but the clicks seem nice too. The interface for switching from diffuser ring / both / primary LED looks fine, too.   Everything about this light looks AWESOME as a whole, but those two issues are absolutely deal breakers for me. Heck, I could even do without the tailstanding. All they would have needed to add would be a single extra click to enter moonlight, or even the ability to stay in moonlight after turning off the light.   I hope they fix those issues in the next version."

However, I'm just like fluffy here and don't understand how you can make a light with obvious candle-like features but not make it tailstand?  I guess it would make a good wand but with a little ring around that button it would be much more useful, and for me it is a dealbreaker.  If this light could tailstand it would be very compelling."

I've used my flashlight a lot (an mini maglite) and I can't name specific things but it's quite useful.  Size - Needs to EASILY fit in my pocket. Period.  Battery Type & Quantity - Don't care about quantity. Debating between AA or AAA and 18650. I'd love to see options for both.   Price Range - $10-$50. I'd prefer something between $20 and $30.  Type - For the moment, a handheld flashlight.  Lumens - Probably 150-500. More if I can get them.  Switch Type - I don't like the twist, but I'm open to almost everything else.

flashlight,3dsoks,mcfarlie6996,2,Sun Jul 19 22:45:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't particularly like any of them. They're fine lights just none particularly stand out as far as size/weight/specs/output goes.   Of those, the Streamlight is my favorite. Triple click for Low, Double click for strobe, single click for high. Decent enough interface. Downsides is it's only 155 Lumens with less than 100 meters of throw (saw you mention that elsewhere). Only two modes, but that's fine given the interface. I would really like 3 - one at a Lumen or less, and another a little brighter than 11 (maybe 30), but 11 and 155 is a decent compromise.   Eagletac is a little dimmer (127 Lumens), but you adjust the output at the head. That's not ideal for me, but it's WAY better than the foursevens lights you linked - you have to twist the head to turn them on, and that's an absolute deal breaker for me. Worse, you have to keep twisting the head back and forth to adjust the brightness.   Also, for pocket lights, all of those are a little long. If you're dead set on AA, I'd check out the Zebralight SC52w. It's $59, so just out of budget, but it's thin, tiny, uses only 1xAA, and hits 280 Lumens, with programmable modes all the way down to 0.01 Lumens and a great interface to boot.   You've seen mcfarlie and emarkd talk about it, so check out the picture of the SC62w next to the Mini Maglite. The SC52w has the same head as the 62, but a slightly thinner and shorter body. The 2xAA lights you linked are about the same length as the Mini Mag.  Here's a review of the SC62, and it will give you an idea of the interface for the SC52: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWJFQegalhU  Edit: Also, Zebralight is an American company, with lights made in China (like Foursevens)."
flashlight,3dsoks,emarkd,2,Sun Jul 19 23:36:57 2015 UTC,"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31k9F35txeL.jpg  Streamlight has a longer throw. 115m to be exact. If it's your favorite, I might just do that.   Concerning the zebralight, I'd prefer a metal exterior if possible.   I think I'll get the streamlight soon and then get a small or keychain model later."
flashlight,3dsoks,mcfarlie6996,2,Mon Jul 20 00:03:07 2015 UTC,"I saw the 115 meters nominal throw, but that's calculated as to how far the light will throw and produce 0.25 Lumens. So usually that means you subtract about 30% for usable throw, which will put at less than 100 meters. It's good for comparisons, though.   The Zebralight is metal, and quite tough. I carry the SC62w daily. Well worth the extra $10. And at nearly double the lumens you should get a solid 100 meters or more of usable throw (though I'd love for /u/mcfarlie6996 to test that theory with his light meter and H52w).   Oh, and don't forget that you're also getting a nicer tint with the Zebralight - the W stands for Warm and a warm or neutral tint looks a lot better than the cool tints on the other lights."
flashlight,3dsoks,mcfarlie6996,3,Mon Jul 20 01:23:41 2015 UTC,"Just a note, I have the H52Fw so it's frosty and would have little throw and nothing worth noting really. But I'll test it out when I test my next review light."

flashlight,3dsoks,Zak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:33:32 2015 UTC,"I mentioned that in my post above:    [The Eagletac is] not ideal for me, but it's WAY better than the foursevens [M2A] lights you linked - you have to twist the head to turn them on, and that's an absolute deal breaker for me. Worse, you have to keep twisting the head back and forth to adjust the brightness.   Some lights, like the Nitecore SRT series, use a control ring to change brightness. That's an OK interface. With the Eagletac, you click the head into the position you want, then use the tail switch to turn the light on. It's only got a few outputs, but it's still an OK interface - not great, just OK.   With the M2A, there is no tail switch - you tighten the head of the light to turn the light on, like an old mini mag. Twisting the head of the light to turn it on is a poor interface, in my opinion. It's hard to do one handed. Then if you have to twist the head back and forth, off and on, to go from Low to Medium to High, that's even worse. Then you have to do it all over again to get to strobe and the special outputs. THEN it forgets what mode you were on after just 2 seconds of being off!  From their website (with paragraph breaks added since they don't know how to do that):   To turn the Mini on tighten the bezel (the head of the light) fully down. The Mini will turn on when the bezel is fully tightened and turn off when the bezel is loosened.   To select a different level of constant output turn the Mini off and then on again within 1 second. This will select the next level of constant output in the following sequence: Low -> Medium -> High. If the Mini is turned off for 2 seconds or longer it will revert back to Low.   The Mini has 4 special output modes: Strobe / S.O.S. / Beacon (Hi) / Beacon (Lo). To access these modes quickly switch through two full 'cycles' of the regular outputs starting with Low. These two full cycles must be completed within 3 seconds: Low -> Medium -> High -> Low -> Medium -> High -> Special Outputs.   In other words, you couldn't pay me to use that light."

I have never handled a USB light, but I own several Fenix lights, and their build quality is all superb. Going by that, I think that I would at least trust one from them if it fit my needs.   I just really prefer being able to charge my batteries separately, and carry as many spares as I need. I bought some neat silicone battery sleeves from Illumn, and there's a pocket in my work shorts that's perfect for carrying an extra battery.  USB charging is a cool feature, no doubt, but it's just not for me."

But my day to day life I'm not going to be draining an 18650 a day, not have access to spare 18650s, not have access to my other flashlights, and their batteries (Nimh/14500/16340).  The size/weight addition is important to me because I like my EDC lights small and compact, and I, maybe irrationally, trust my charger more than an in light charger, and if 1 in a million chance anything were to go wrong while charging I don't have a battery venting in a sealed tube.  So it has it's place, and if I find myself taking around the world 6 month backpacking vacation then I'd probably pick one up, but for me now, I don't look for the feature.

I bought mine several years ago, so maybe the brass pill has changed?  I don't know if I understand the problem.  So the brass thing is called the pill.  The driver is too big in diameter or too big in height? Is the pill too shallow on the driver side to accommodate the chips? These convoys come with a very similar style driver to the qlite usually... So it should work in theory... Go to budget light forum and search for my convoy s6 review.  I can't help you right now other than I remember taking pictures of it.  Also you can find my convoy pictures on Flickr under mhanlen1.  Hope you can find something that helps in the meantime until I can get home and look at the thing and see if I had to do anything...

flashlight,3dpzv1,Spaced_Inv8r,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:06:06 2015 UTC,"I think some of the other replies have it right.  The driver is too wide to seat itself deep enough into the pill all the way.  There is a small inner lip, which may be to give spacing for wires/chips so they don't get smashed when tightening the ring.  So it looks like a dab of solder is the way to go.  I will check out your pictures later on and see if I missed anything."

I have the device working, but I cannot seem to get the driver to seat properly in the bass(copper?) housing.  It seems to be to big to sit inside of the inner lip. Due to this, the brass ring cannot be threaded on due to the chips on the driver being almost flush with the top lip.     What do you mean ""brass ring""? There shouldn't be a brass ring that connects to the housing. Are you sure the ring isn't for the tail switch?   P.S. Make sure you pull those wires inside from the LED.

At least not for the few minutes I had them running. The way I test is by shining both at a wall at the same time and visually gauging brightness as well as by seeing whether one hotspot will slightly outshine the other's hotspot when they are overlapped.  That temp chart seems to validate my findings. What a difference in temperature for no change in brightness that I could discern."
flashlight,3dp4y6,Chadzy,3,Sat Jul 18 11:59:33 2015 UTC,100 lumens difference at such brightness is hard to tell with the eye. Even though I'm guilty in participating in the lumen war it's all for fun.  When it comes to practical purposes there really is no benefit.

flashlight,3dmy1c,campfire,7,Fri Jul 17 16:03:27 2015 UTC,Several lights in that size class are substantially brighter if you run them on a 10440 lithium-ion battery. The direct-drive Peak Eiger Ultra X will put out maybe 500-600 lumens if you use an IMR 10440 and less on a standard 10440. This version cannot run on 1.2/1.5 volt AAAs.

I'd rather carry a spare 18650 than a USB charger that I'd have to sit around and wait on. In the rare cases that I think I'll need more than a couple of 18650s that I need to swap out then I definitely want an external charger so I can charge 2-4 spares while using my light.

Hmm.   I don't understand your question.  Do you mean ""Is there an 18650 light that can accept AA batteries?""? I want to say I did see something like that once, but it didn't have onboard charging and wasn't any of the popular models.  Or did you mean ""Do any rechargeable AAs come anywhere near the performance of 18650s?""? The answer is no. It takes four good NiMH AAs to equal the capacity, in watt-hours of one 18650. Those four AAs will have twice the volume and three times the weight."

So if I was using a AA version of any given light, I could expect 1/4 the run time.  Not sure that's a trade I'm willing to make....if I ever get to travelling enough in bad places that this is a problem I'll just buy a more suitable light."

A direct comparison is hard because you won't find any single-AA lights with the same maximum output as modern 18650 lights. A few AA lights can run on Li-ion 14500s, which are the same size as AAs, but I don't know any off the shelf 14500 lights that hit 1000lm. With real AAs, Zebralight probably comes the closest with the SC5, which can hit 500lm for a few minutes running on a rechargeable AA Eneloop.  When compared with an 18650 light's lower modes, the AA models will have about 1/4 the runtime at the same output. So will 14500s. Alkaline AAs will not be able to achieve higher power outputs and will have a very short life in a high-output light designed for NiMH rechargeables, or will quickly drop down to a lower mode."

But it's not usb rechargeable. If this had a usb port and a few more lumens it'd be my DREAM light. Damn.   Well that's definitely a new light that I have not seen yet. Looks a lot like the EC21 but with an added tail switch. There might be a USB version yet to be released for this that we don't know about yet (I'll talk to my contact at Nitecore and see if I can find out more). Looking at their series last year, the MT series and the MH series were nearly identical with the MH series being the UBS rechargeable version of the MT lights. They have since added to the MH series with the MH10, MH12, & the MH20 but yes none of those have the red led.

If you need more than that, regularly, you may as well carry something more beefy!  How long do you think it could take to get a response from nitecore.  That impulse buy trigger is twitching, haha!  The MT20c is so damn TINY! I drew a relative size diagram on a piece of paper and it's just sitting there daring me to disbelieve.    The MH20 is about the same size, but lacks the rear tail button, or red led.  Double the output though. Decisions, decisions."

flashlight,3dm6xp,Mexicanpizza1,6,Fri Jul 17 12:00:48 2015 UTC,"For EDC, you're going to get a lot of recommendations for the Zebralight SC62w due to its small size, neutral tint, smart thermal regulation and clever UI. If you haven't considered and rejected it, you should consider it.  You may also want to look at the Armytek Partner C2 Pro, a dual-switch light similar to the P12 and PD35. It has better impact resistance, better water resistance, a near-moonlight 2 lumen mode, better tint options and active thermal regulation instead of timed step-downs from the highest modes. It's about the same price as the PD35, and this is an objectively better feature set.  Otherwise, I'd go for the P12. The PD35 is a fine light, but the P12 has a moonlight mode, the ability to tailstand and a lower price. I think the two were about the same price a year ago, and then there was no obvious winner."
flashlight,3dm6xp,Zak,2,Fri Jul 17 12:13:59 2015 UTC,"PD35 owner here, picked it after holding both lights and liking the look & feel of the Fenix just a little better.   The P12 rolls easily without the ""tactical"" ring and doesn't have as nice a clip. On the other hand it has a nifty battery indicator light built into the mode switch and my PD35 came without any grease on the threads.   Nitpicking, sure, but the lights are just really similar."

P12 seemed like an absolutely awesome light, and it is! It's awesome for the price and awesome for what it is - a semi-tactical light that works well on a belt pouch.   What the P12 is NOT is an EDC light - for me at least. It's too big and too heavy. The SC62w is MUCH smaller, and yes, the warm tint really does make that much of a difference. It's much nicer, much easier on the eyes, and more faithfully produces more correct colors when lighting things - especially when you need to tell the difference between orange and red wires in a computer case or something.  See this comment chain here:   https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/3coic2/need_help_choosing_a_flashlight/csyilbn?context=10000  That'll give you tons of info on the P12 and why I like the SC62w better, especially my response to tinniertdog.

Nitecore has had QC issues lately as reported by a lot of people, and their warranty service is known to be a nightmare. I would not buy a light from them, or recommend that anyone else do so.   I have a PD35 and I love it. I'd recommend that you spend the extra money and get one if that's an option that you considered. It's just a better quality light. And the output settings are spaced out way better than the P12.   Yeah, it can't tail stand or SOS, but is that really a big deal? The only real negative is 14 lumens being as low as it goes, but I'll trade that for not having to jump from medium to turbo."
flashlight,3dm6xp,fluffman86,2,Fri Jul 17 14:24:27 2015 UTC,I dropped my p12 from waist height onto tile and it broke. Won't turn on. Can't fix it myself no apparent problem just won't turn on. What a piece of shit.
flashlight,3dm6xp,Zak,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:05:07 2015 UTC,That could happen to any light. Contact your dealer if it's under warranty.
flashlight,3dm6xp,fluffman86,2,Fri Jul 17 17:54:41 2015 UTC,Seriously. It's rated for drops from that height.
flashlight,3dm6xp,JimTokle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:49:13 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile, I LIKE the jump from 240 to 1000 Lumens since that's right at double the apparent brightness. No need to cycle through an extra mode (unless they added in a 15-20 Lumen mode, that would be nice).  Plus, I use my flashlight to tailstand under desks and on my nightstand all the time - it's incredibly useful and would cost Fenix an extra 1/10 of an inch of metal if they just designed the tail correctly."
flashlight,3dm6xp,fluffman86,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:40:47 2015 UTC,"That's fine, the output settings are a matter of personal preference, and tail standing can be a legitimate complaint.  That still doesn't address the inferior build quality and awful warranty service.   Like many things in life, you get what you pay for. The P12 is slightly better on paper, but not in actuality. Especially since the new PD35 Tac evens the score as far as pure output numbers go."
flashlight,3dm6xp,JimTokle,2,Fri Jul 17 15:43:33 2015 UTC,"PD35 doesn't even the score because it still lacks a moonlight mode and nobody cares about the difference between 950 and 1000 Lumens - you probably won't even be able to tell a difference, assuming they're using the same beam pattern. You could definitely a difference with the P12 since it had more candela and more throw and a tighter beam, but overall Lumens wouldn't matter that much.   Edit, you make a fine point on the warranty service. Not arguing that except to say that in general the authorized dealer should handle that."
flashlight,3dm6xp,mcfarlie6996,3,Fri Jul 17 16:16:45 2015 UTC,"I will admit that I would love to have a moonlight mode. I find myself using my 14 lumen setting most of the time anyways. I'm actually really interested in an SC62w just for how low it can go, and the customizable output settings."

flashlight,3dl4ba,d_c_d_,10,Fri Jul 17 03:45:14 2015 UTC,"I was contacted a while back by /u/Louise_Lee to review the Thorfire Mini Telescopic Camping Lantern. You can find plenty of cut and dry technical reviews, but I like to use lights before I throw in my 2¢. I took this little light on 2 over night kayaking/camping trips and here's what I have to say about it.  Technical stuffs from documentation   High: 65 Lm Low: 15 Lm Takes 4 hours to charge to 100% capacity 1 minute of cranking gives you 4 minutes on high, 11 minutes on low Fully charged runtime on high: 40 min Fully charged runtime on low: 4.5 hours Weight 168 grams   Real life stuffs from experience  Design  Nice compact little package, and the weight is unnoticeable in your pack. The lantern diffuser is thick enough that the underlying LED doesn't blind you. The ""handle"" conveniently located on the bottom of the light so that if you hang it you can utilize both the lantern mode and the direct beam. The hand crank (more on this later) is well designed, stows away securely and you can use it without busting your knuckles. It also has some grippy little feet to secure it of slanted surfaces.  Gripe: has to be charged with USB, or a USB to outlet adapter. It comes with one wire for charging the light, and another to charge the iPhone, that's a lot of wires to keep track of.  Modes  It's a 2 mode light, Low/High. The modes are spaced well enough that the low is usable, but low enough for those times when you want a ""low light"" that won't blind you, and in lantern mode high is enough to light up a 40' diameter campsite, and when in beam mode the damn thing actually throws over 200'.  Gripe, I am a CRI nerd and the CRI of this light is taxing on the eyes. It's not the worst I have ever seen, that title belongs to 4/7s, but it does take a while to regain night vision after you turn it off. But this is more of an emergency light and I think this small gripe would be negligible under emergency circumstances, The CRI is easily out-weighed by the functionality.  Runtime  I used it only on low for one trip and only on high for another.   When on low, it ran for about 5 hours before it dimmed to about 50%, then I went to bed. It was more than enough for one night.  When on high, I got almost an hour out of it before it dimmed to 50%. The output diminished over the next 2.5 - 3 hours, but it was still usable light. After about 4 hours it was a dim glow.   Hand Crank/iPhone Charging  From totally dead, I turned the handle about 25-30 times and got 10-15 minutes light out of it - worked as I expected… but I wanted to know about the iPhone charging capabilities. I played on my phone until it was completely dead, plugged it in and started cranking. Not gonna lie, it was freakin' work. I had to crank on it for a good 8-10 minutes before the phone registered 1%. I quit timing this process, but I was able to get it to 4% - which was enough to send a few text messages and check my location on the maps app.   Honestly, I usually carry a 3000mAh iPhone charger when I go out, but next time I think I will leave that at home and just use this all in one lantern/torch/charger instead.  Durability  Drop Test - Yeah, I went there.   Waist high - 3 drops onto concrete, A-OK.  Shoulder height - 3 drops onto concrete, some scuffs, but no damage.  High as I could reach (roughly 8 1/2') - 3 drops onto concrete, no significant damage, works great. Came open once, but no damage.  Tossed straight up about 15-20 feet over concrete - tossed it up and caught it… I decided I like the light too much to find out how it would handle the fall.  Note: The documentation specifically says ""Do not drop or hit this product"".  Water Resistance  As you can see from the pics, I played with it in the rain and it handled that just fine. The documentation does not mention water resistance/proofing, so I assumed it is not… but what the hell, I dunked it anyway - I'm that kinda dude.  Submerged it 3 times in about 18 inches of water for 5 seconds… light is fine. The light is quite buoyant, so it is safe to assume that it will be fine if you drop it in a puddle.   Conclusion  I like this light, it'll really come in handy in any day pack, emergency bag, or when the next hurricane hits."

It can be considered pre meditated and you will be at fault in any confrontation. It is not illegal to carry a big ass flashlight. My Dad used to carry a 4D Maglight in his truck for this very reason.

Hell I even had one of those holster rings cops wore on their duty belts to carry my own big maglite, which I did often while camping or riding fourwheelers, or just playing in the woods.  Good times, for sure.  I've really got a soft spot for maglite and hate being negative about them.   But the bottom line is that times have changed and a big maglite doesn't make sense anymore.  It was different when the best light you could buy also doubled as a good bludgeon, but nowadays carrying that bludgeon means making big sacrifices in your light and im not willing to do that."

That was great 20 years ago when rechargeables sucked and costed a fortune but nowadays that just doesn't make sense.

flashlight,3dk5f8,fluffman86,3,Fri Jul 17 02:33:00 2015 UTC,"You probably want a flashlight that uses 18650 lithium-ion batteries, even if you think you don't.  The advertised runtime for that Maglite is misleading. The FL1 standard measures output 30 seconds after activation and measures runtime until 10% of that output. Three alkaline D batteries absolutely cannot maintain enough current for 625 lumens out of any current LED for 16 hours. It probably steps down to a much lower output after a few minutes, but if it does not, it will rapidly grow dimmer, then run for a long time at a much lower output due to the limitations of the battery.  It's a pretty good club if you need to carry an impact weapon but pretend it isn't a weapon."
flashlight,3dk5f8,Zak,3,Thu Jul 16 23:26:02 2015 UTC,"You probably want a flashlight that uses 18650 lithium-ion batteries, even if you think you don't.   That post focuses almost exclusively on lumens and energy density. Given that even basic AA/AAA LED lights can put out plenty of usable lumens and runtime for regular users, I'm not really sure I buy the ""even people who aren't enthusiasts should use 18650's"" argument. Whether the Maglite lives up to its stated lumen output and runtime doesn't really matter for most people - all they care about is that it is enough for most situations, which it is.  Don't get me wrong, I prefer 18650's too, but there are significant advantages to using cells that are more common, especially for casual users. In the case of this maglight, I think the only advantage is the heft and maybe runtime. But I wouldn't fault someone for choosing a nice AA light over an 18650."

You can scrounge up some AA's from a remote, a drawer, a neighbor, or the corner store. Not the case with 18650's.  I'm not sure why you're fighting this so much - more common items are by definition more convenient. That doesn't mean 18650's aren't great, just that there is a place for AA batteries."

Then I've got one in the light and one fully charged, while waiting for a full charge for the rest. Seriously, it isn't hard to make sure you always have one available that's charged. With common usage, one single charge can last months to begin with. If you're without charged batteries just 0.5% of the time, the risk that your power goes out right then is tiny.   You really are not that likely to end up without power for your flashlight.   Old laptop battery packs actually often do contain 18650's."

flashlight,3dk5f8,juaquin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:17:11 2015 UTC,"Not trying to start another debate like the one you got into here with Nathanel, but if emergency preparedness is your goal you should at least consider something that runs on CR123s.  The shelf life on those cells is much better than alkalines.  Plus they're readily available on store shelves which seems important to you.    On that note, most (not all) 18650-powered lights can also run on 2xCR123.  So you can really have the best of both worlds - a super strong 18650-powered light that'll run on readily available cells with crazy shelf-life in an emergency."

flashlight,3djgqi,EverGoodHunterMe,3,Thu Jul 16 19:37:07 2015 UTC,"I think you want an Armytek Partner C2 Pro and an Armytek Viking XP-L. Armytek claims higher ratings for toughness and waterproofing than most lights, and the reviews I've seen give me no reason to doubt that. The Partner is a general-purpose light, and the Pro version has a separate mode switch for ease of use. The Viking is a compact thrower for distance use, but not so much of a thrower as to be unusable up close. Also check out the Olight M20SX Javelot, and even more compact dual-switch thrower.  You might also want to consider a light that can be either a flashlight or a headlamp. The Zebralight H200w Mk. II is a great choice."
flashlight,3djgqi,Zak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:59:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'm liking the armytek ones, I've also done some research and whats your opinion on nitecore p36 and p20s?  Also what kind of problems will I run into when in extreme cold? I'd be needing to use it in temps as low as -45C. Although primarily it'll be used within temp ratings."
flashlight,3djgqi,Zak,2,Thu Jul 16 20:47:53 2015 UTC,"The P20 is fine, though I think I'd rather have a P10 or P12 because they fit in a pocket better. The P36 uses a much larger LED (it's actually an array of, I think 64 tiny LEDs on one die) and produces a very large hotspot. The tradeoff is it needs to produce more total light to get the same apparent brightness, which drains batteries faster.   Also what kind of problems will I run into when in extreme cold?   From what I could find, Li-ion battery performance is reduced in extreme cold, but they should still work, and running a flashlight on high will warm them up. Do not attempt to charge Li-ion batteries in sub-freezing conditions or when the batteries themselves are cold-soaked, or you may damage them. I've also seen it claimed that IMR (sometimes labeled as lithium-manganese) cells don't like the cold. It's safe to assume a Li-ion battery is not IMR unless it says it is.  Lithium primary CR123s may perform a little better in the cold, though they're starting from each CR123 having about a third the capacity (in watt-hours, not amp-hours) of an 18650, so it may not matter.  Armytek is a Canadian company and may be able to comment on extreme cold."
flashlight,3djgqi,Zak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:02:46 2015 UTC,"I think I am leaning towards the armytek ones, so now I suppose I need to buy a 18650 battery and charger. Do you have any suggestions on that?"
flashlight,3djgqi,Zak,3,Thu Jul 16 21:33:38 2015 UTC,"The Panasonic NCR18650B is /r/flashlight's favorite cell. 3400 mAh batteries from flashlight companies use that cell with their own wrapper on it; they're all the same and they're all good, but some cost more than others. Keeppower's 3400 mAh also an NCR18650B. Plain Panasonic-branded cells are good too, but it's best to get them with a button top for compatibility with some flashlights.  Some people will tell you to get a protection circuit. This is a PCB that acts as circuit breaker if the battery is shorted (but not under all possible conditions), overcharged or over-discharged. Lithium-ion batteries can vent hot gasses or catch fire under any of those conditions, but it's extremely unlikely any flashlight, or charger that's fit for use will cause them. With or without a protection circuit, any good 18650 also has a pressure relief valve that will also interrupt a short circuit as well as a thermal fuse that shuts it down if it gets dangerously hot. In any case, you should physically protect your batteries from shorting by keeping them in an enclosed device or a plastic box. The protection PCB also introduces another component that might possibly perform poorly in cold weather.  Nitecore i2, i4, D2 and D4 chargers are probably the most popular around here. The Miller ML-102 power bank/charger is also awesome for the power bank function; I recommend everyone who owns 18650s get one, but I prefer a multi-slot charger as my main charger.  Do not buy any batteries or chargers with ""fire"" in the name; they're lying about everything except maybe the fire."
flashlight,3djgqi,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:41:01 2015 UTC,"So I could get an extra 18650 and use that charger to also charge my phone? That's awesome, but how vulnerable are 18650s? Would I be worried not having it in a hard case?  Is this what you suggested?"
flashlight,3djgqi,fluffman86,2,Thu Jul 16 21:52:26 2015 UTC,"So I could get an extra 18650 and use that charger to also charge my phone?   Yes, that's the idea. I don't recommend storing the battery in the ML-102 because it has some parasitic drain and no physical protection from shorting, but it's not terribly dangerous either as long as there aren't loose metal things in the same compartment with it.  Yes, those are NCR18650Bs. Those are flat-top cells and a few flashlights require button-top. Armytek flashlights can use either, but if you might be buying a Nitecore in the future, button-top is a better choice. Also, look at that shipping time before you order."
flashlight,3djgqi,undress15,2,Thu Jul 16 22:02:29 2015 UTC,"I guess I should mention this...  The Partner features a Head Tighten for Turbo and a Head Loosen for the other modes. This is its Pros and Cons with the con having to twist each time if you want max output which using my Predator as an example, it's a two handed operation. The pro is that when the head is tighten, you know it's going to be max output when turned on like if there was an intruder or something.   The Prime on the other hand uses only a side switch with a hidden Turbo, two(Partner has 1*not hidden) hidden moonlight modes(these are nice), and 3 main modes. Pros: moonlight modes are easily accessed from off so you never have to worry about blinding yourself(con: only can be accessed from off), Turbo is hidden and easily accessible with a double click to get to max output(con: must be on first to get to Turbo).   Many of Armytek lights are unique if I must say but they are tough as fuck. I encourage to look at the manual for any light you are interested in because everyone has different preferences when it comes to User Interfaces... Except for Zebralight... Everyone loves Zebralight's UI.   Speaking of them, the SC62w makes a great camping light with its 11 modes(6 instant, 5 spares which can be programmed in 15 seconds) from as bright as 930 lumens down to 0.01 lumens which is practically non-useable because of how low that is. The 0.4Lm however makes a great nightlight and the beam pattern itself is fairly floody which is great for close up.  I saw you mention the P36, this review is excellent and if anything watch the video. What I love about this light is that the light uses a rotary switch which means midway through changing the 10 modes, you can rotate it back the other way instead of having to completely cycle from low to high to bet back to moonlight mode. It's also going to be floody too but this light will have some throw because of the sheer power of 2000 lumens though.   If you're looking for something with more throw I'd definitely check out the Armytek Viking but I encourage you to get the (warm) version because colors will look much more nature. The Cool White tint on mine isn't the most appealing on my eyes and the colors. Optional diffuser to use close up.   If you're looking for even ridiculous about of throw than that then the Olight M2X-UT Javelot and the M3SX-UT Javelot might be the guys for you. The first one is a compact single 18650 light that throws 800m and the second light uses two 18650 batteries and throws 1000m. I'm going to let these two excellent reviews do the talking: M2X-UT & M3SX-UT  I still have 1000 characters left... what should I talk about...  1 to 2 18650 type lights still open the door to a lot of possibilities and this isn't even updated with all the brands and brand new modes. Maybe if you could help narrow what you're looking for with each of the possibly two lights you're looking for we might be able to find that perfect light. Camping can be an array of lights from close range to set up tents and such to needing a lot of throw to spot potential threats but general use makes me think or a indoor/backyard light where more flood the better because you'll be working hands on.   One last note: Nitecore lights require Button-Top batteries in order to work because of how they are designed. In case you buy something from that brand. Otherwise the rest of the brands(as far as I'm aware) use both Flat-Top & Button-Top batteries.   TL;DR: Gotta catch em' all!!"

flashlight,3djakw,mcfarlie6996,2,Thu Jul 16 20:09:45 2015 UTC,This meets pretty much every spec I set out...  on the first reply!  Thanks.  I will seriously consider this light.  930 lumens blows anything I've been looking at out of the water.
flashlight,3djakw,Zak,4,Thu Jul 16 19:26:33 2015 UTC,"930 lumens blows anything I've been looking at out of the water.   That's why we love our 18650s here. Lights that use the 18650 and Cree XM-L2 emitter are typically 800-1000 lumens and definitely blow everything else in their size class out of the water.  The SC62w also uses a neutral white emitter, which many people prefer to the cool white found in most flashlights. It's similar in color to direct sunlight. There's a cool white version with a few more lumens, but perception of brightness is logarithmic and your eye will not be able to see a difference between 930 lumens and 1000. It will be able to tell neutral white from cool, and most people prefer neutral.  Armytek also makes some lights as bright as the SC62. The Partner C2 Pro is a good choice, having an electronic mode switch separate from the power button for a more convenient interface. Armytek lights are known for their toughness, and Armytek is the only flashlight maker I know of using daylight tints, which are between neutral and cool. Oddly, they don't advertise that fact at all and just label their daylight lights ""cool white""."
flashlight,3djakw,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:49:29 2015 UTC,"So when I look at the Armytek lights,  I want to buy the regular one not the one that says (warm) beside the name?"
flashlight,3djakw,Zak,3,Thu Jul 16 20:47:25 2015 UTC,"I like daylight tints best of all the available LED tints. Some people like warm tints, which look more like incandescent bulbs, though not quite as yellow in most cases."
flashlight,3djakw,mcfarlie6996,2,Thu Jul 16 20:49:31 2015 UTC,"Although the warm version of lights are 10% dimmer, you won't be able to tell with the naked eye but the colors of everything look MUCH much better with the warm colors than with the Cool White tint. I, along with many others here, would easily choose the Neutral/Warm tints vs the Cool White tints. I almost feel like /u/Zak's comment was a typo, ""which many people prefer to the cool white found in most flashlights. It's similar in color to direct sunlight."" but hopefully he can clear it up."
flashlight,3djakw,mcfarlie6996,3,Fri Jul 17 03:36:27 2015 UTC,"Armytek's ""cool"" is actually daylight - 5500K. I really like this tint. Zebralight's cool is 6500K, which is meh. Zebralight's neutral is 4500K, very close to sunlight, which almost everyone will prefer to 6500K. Armytek's ""warm"" is 4000K, kind of warm-neutral. I'm not sure that's better than 5500K.  As an aside, I've used a 2700K flashlight after an emitter was sent to me by mistake. It almost looked orange and was definitely not to my liking relative to 5500K daylight. I'd probably take 6500K cool over this too. I wonder how the world looks under CRI-90+ cool white. Where do I get XHP35s so I can find out?"
flashlight,3djakw,mcfarlie6996,2,Fri Jul 17 11:50:54 2015 UTC,Oh I see. I thought you were referring to all lights and not just the Armytek.
flashlight,3djakw,Natanael_L,4,Fri Jul 17 12:00:56 2015 UTC,"No. If I was buying an Armytek, I would go for daylight (""cool""). If I was buying a Zebralight, I would go for neutral. If somebody was selling a 90+ CRI 6500K XHP35 light, I'd probably buy that over other tints just to see what it looks like."
flashlight,3djakw,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:04:56 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm not the biggest fan of the Cool White Predator XP-G2 that I have but maybe that has a different Kelvin rating than the XM-L2 lights but I can't seem to find anything on it. It's definitely Cool tint and doesn't look like a Pure White like the recent Nitecore lights I've reviewed.

flashlight,3dj2zh,morthawt,2,Thu Jul 16 23:56:19 2015 UTC,"See, some lights, like the Fenix UC35, have a micro USB port built into them. So you just plug in the cable, put a battery inside, and it charges inside the light.  How most of us do it is having an external charger. So you take the battery outside the flashlight, and put it in the charger to charge.  Some of these too can be connected via USB, for example the Nitecore UM10 or Miller Ml-102. Others have their own connections directly to AC, like the Nitecore i2.  If you're intending on having just one light, then a charger integrated into the light might be what you want. These are more expensive, however.  If you intend on purchasing another lithium ion battery based light, especially if it is in another battery size(think 14500 or 16340), then the external charger route is preferable."

First off battery capacity is for runtime and not brightness(there's certain exceptions) but on a fresh 18650 battery, you're looking a ~40 lumens, ~320 lumens, and ~800 lumens if I go off this graph with worst case scenario.    -is the blink in the low mode annoying when actually using low?    It only blinks once but no, just make sure you don't turn it off right after unless you want to change modes.   -how would I know the voltage is getting low and should change/charge the battery? I would be using protected 18650's as the site says they fit.   My method, pretty much when your high looks like medium, charge it, but the batteries have protection so you don't have to actually worry about anything and just charge it when it's lower than normal."

flashlight,3diqui,Zak,2,Thu Jul 16 17:55:20 2015 UTC,"In addition to what people have already said, the Qlite driver is a buck driver, meaning it reduces voltage to the desired level and cannot increase voltage. LEDs require a minimum voltage to light up at all, and for the XM-L2, that's a little under 3 volts, which happens to be about where you want to stop discharging a Li-ion battery. This light, and most lights designed to run on a single 18650 cannot over-discharge your battery, though you should recharge it within a couple days of draining it completely to avoid further self-discharge.  Your protected cells should also shut off completely if you put a load on them while they're already discharged too far."

flashlight,3de0hi,emarkd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:37:38 2015 UTC,Trying to to the math but uncertain. Our cost here is 12c per kwh.. Bulb cost 250 initial but using 250 less watts. Bulbs usually run 8 to 10 hours a day. Another main incentive for us is heat. Barns get dusty and with dry straw there is risk of fire with a high temp bulb as well as glass being put in the stall.   10 year warranty on bulb.

flashlight,3dfqmg,nicknameknick,5,Wed Jul 15 22:33:54 2015 UTC,"So... 15mm excludes AA since the battery itself is 14mm. You're not going to have a lot of options that are blindingly bright in that size class and absolutely none if you want to use alkaline batteries. Furthermore, most of the super-small lights that are super bright are multi-mode and I'm not sure any of those can be configured to start on high.  Your best bet is going to be to get a light that can run on the 10440 lithium-ion battery. This is a 3.7 volt rechargeable the size of a AAA that can deliver up to 3 amps (for a few minutes). A few lights designed for AAA can run on it and provide increased output. The Streamlight Microstream and Pelican 1910 might fit the bill, being simple single-mode lights. Both have forward-clicky switches (momentary for half-press, locked on for full press).  Another option is the Peak Eiger with the added momentary button. The most blinding version will be the Ultra X, which requires the 10440 battery and cannot run on standard-voltage AAAs. Unlike other LED flashlights that regulate power using a driver and current-limiting circuit, the Eiger uses a piece of quantum-tunneling composite material that becomes more conductive the more it's squeezed. Pushing the momentary switch squeezes it. Tightening the head also squeezes it and locks the light on.  Or you could listen to fluffman86, go a little bigger and step up to the 18650-powered SC62. You probably want an 18650 light even if you think you don't though possibly not for this application if you're extremely sensitive to bulk."

It starts on low every time, then you have to cycle up through the modes. That's better than starting on high and going down, but I'd rather pick my mode.   But it's not much smaller than an SC62, and your runtimes with that much output on a AA are absolutely abysmal. 130 Lumens is a great all-purpose brightness, and 50 is too if it's pretty dark. But compare 1.5 hours at 130 Lumens with an AA vs. 150 Lumens for 11 Hours on an 18650 in the SC62w.   E12 is 19mm diameter x 90mm long. SC62w is 24.4mm x 96.5mm"

They will not fit diameter wise in my Convoy S6, and have some problems in other similar Convoy tube style lights... and The length is a problem in my Spark SG6. Also it does not fit due to length in the battery carrier of my Acebeam K40M. Since it is one of the largest batteries you might want to check reviews on a particular light to see if it fits protected cells. It's not just Panasonic's either- sometimes protected cells of other brands also have trouble due to length and width.  The problem comes with adding a few millimeters of a button top and bottom protection circuit.  Plus they often have an additional wrapper holding the protection circuits on."

flashlight,3dfd5n,Zak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:44:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not a throwy light at all because of the large MT-G2 emitter which prevents from getting a tight beam. The only possible way to get more throw is to get a larger reflector which the Thrunite TN35 has which ends up producing 2750 lumens and 518m of throw but even that number isn't really impressive for a thrower. The TK61 on the other hand is one awesome son of a bitch which I picked on up ~15 months ago but even that is getting out-classed."

Sorry for the potato beamshots, my iPhone 6 doesn't take very good ones (better ones to come on Friday when I get my new camera).  First impressions:   I love the detents in the selector ring and the ramp up is nice The red/blue flashing strobe is very gimmicky and I wish it was at the other end of the selector if it really needs to be there The length is perfect to carry clipped on the inside of my back pocket (so that it edges outwards when I'm sitting) It's a bit too long to carry comfortably in either of my front pockets, but I've mostly moved to carrying my EDC light as described above Placement of the clip and clip tension is good All threads came nicely greased Emitter came nicely centered Forward clicky switch is a bit of a harder press, and I can't seem to engage it very easily with my thumb resting completely horizontal over the tailcap; it seems easier to use my index finger to engage the button Tried Nitecore NL147 14500/750mAh, Panasonic Eneloop 1900 mAh, and Keeppower 14500/800mAh batteries and all of them fit perfectly with the included extender   More to come, but this seems like a great addition to go into my EDC rotation that includes my MH20 and ZebraLight SC62w!~~~"

flashlight,3deym0,Zak,2,Wed Jul 15 19:51:38 2015 UTC,"There's a ton of good stuff out there in the $50-100 range.  Since you said ""distance and power"", I'll mention the Olight M23 Javelot, which is at the upper end of your price range and puts out 1020 lumens in a tighly focused beam. It throws to 436 meters by FL1 standards and will definitely be useful at 350 or more.  If you don't need that much distance, throwers like this aren't ideal for general use. The hotspot will be small and blinding up close. The low end for usable throw with 1000 lumen pocket lights is about 150 meters, and there are a ton of options in that category.  For a truck light, try the Olight S30R Baton II. It just got an update - looks like a more efficient LED. The big selling point with this one is the magnetic charging dock, which seems like a good fit for something you're keeping in your truck. A battery and charging station is included.  Another good onboard-charging light is the Nitecore MH12. Haing a separate mode switch is convenient, and there's a MicroUSB port right on the light, so you can plug it in to just about any phone charger. A battery is included.  I know you said size doesn't matter, but you might not know just how small 1000 lumen lights can get. The Zebralight SC62w is /r/flashlight's current favorite light, I think. This will fit comfortably in a pocket, and with thermal regulation and a more efficient driver (technical explanation on request), it will stay brighter for longer than most.  I'd also suggest taking a look at Armytek's product range. Like Zebralight, they use thermal regulation and extra-efficient drivers. Their advertised durability and waterproofing is significantly above average, and many models use TIR optics, which provide a more gradual transition from hotspot to spill than a standard reflector. The Prime and Viking models seem particularly suited to your request. Armytek mentions both ""LED lumens"" and ""OTF"" lumens. ""OTF"" means ""out the front"" and is directly comparable to what most other flashlights advertise."
flashlight,3deym0,fluffman86,2,Wed Jul 15 21:17:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to reply!! That MH12 is unbelievable.. I really like everything about it. Can you please explain why there isn't an adjustable beam on it? Like a maglite can be adjusted by turning the head.. The rayovac I own can be adjusted by pulling the head out. Is this a feature offered because the light is cheap? Poorly made? Or because of such a high output, the MH12 doesnt need human adjustment?  Edit  http://www.armytek.com/products/flashlights/outdoor-and-camping/armytek-partner-c2-xm-l2.html  I found this and really like the specifications on it, good deal and good light or not?"
flashlight,3deym0,BestLightStore,3,Wed Jul 15 23:31:53 2015 UTC,"Zoom lenses absorb up to 40% of the light, which is kind of bad. The hotspot and spill beam shape of a reflector or TIR lens is generally more useful than the even spot of an aspheric zoom lens. Movable reflectors like maglites have work poorly with LEDs. It's bad for waterproofing and durability. Very few people find they want this feature after seeing the output of a typical 18650/XM-L2 flashlight like the MH12.  The Armytek Partner is a good light. I'd probably go for the Pro model for the separate mode switch. I like that they're using a daylight tint in their ""cool"" white LEDs instead of the bluish 6500K found in many flashlights."
flashlight,3deym0,Zak,2,Wed Jul 15 23:49:56 2015 UTC,"First I want to go ahead and second everything Zak has told you already.   I have the Nitecore P12, which is exactly the same as the MH12 you mentioned except the MH12 has onboard USB charging, while the P12 you remove the battery to recharge.  The MH12 is a great light with a tactical momentary switch, and you won't go wrong with the ArmyTek either, though I don't have that one.  The thing about the MH12, though, is that it has mode memory which is awesome for when you're using the momentary switch, but occasionally you'll be outside with a blazing 1000 Lumens, and then you'll forget to turn it down and have to cycle through the modes to get back to what you want. Another thing about the P12/MH12 is that it uses a cool white tint, which is fine if that's all you're used to but not nearly as nice as a warm white LED.  Personally, though, I carry the much smaller Zebralight SC62w that Zak mentioned. It fits in the 5th pocket of my jeans and it's just TINY, but you still get 930 Lumens, and in a nice, warm / neutral tint unlike the Nitecore lights. Plus, the user interface on this thing is just awesome - you've got instant access to whatever mode you want instead of it just automatically going to high or wherever you left it. So when I wake up at night and want to look around the bedroom or something, I can hold the button for a half second and get straight to my Low/Moonlight mode, or when I first pull it out of my pocket I can go straight to facemelting High mode whenever I want. Check out the review below to get an idea of the modes:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWJFQegalhU  If you're going to be carrying around a light every day, then the SC62w is the light to get. It's probably close to the perfect EDC light. I know you said you wanted a truck light, but if you get this Zebralight you'll want to carry it everyday, I promise. See /r/SC62masterrace for lots of love for that light.  OK, so all of that said, if you definitely want a truck light that won't get used often, then you probably want a 1xCR123 light. 18650s are AWESOME but they will drain over the course of a couple months if you don't use them. If you're using your light every day or even every week or two, then 18650 is the way to go. If you just want something that never gets used, though, then you'd want a primary battery. For that, I'd recommend the Solarforce Z1, based on /u/mcfarlie6996's review here: https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/3bl2i9/a_couple_unboxings_that_im_actually_impressed_with/"

You'll probably want to hold off on recommending that for a couple weeks.  I do agree that the MH12 would be good for most of /u/Beastydrummer's purposes, though."

Mack is one of the only canadian Peak light dealers as well (limited models choices) and for a while had Martac lights too (unforunatley no longer). Still nowhere really to get a good deal on a zebralight in Canada though. Finally - Amazon.ca can be useful for some lights as well.

flashlight,3dehpk,AbraKedavra,2,Wed Jul 15 19:15:33 2015 UTC,"I have dealt with fasttechs customer service several times.  I returned a nitecore ea4 and swapped it out for a Sunwayman because the nitecore was damaged by moisture.  Another time one of their programmable flashlights swapped out for the same model.  Both times returns were handled by sending it to a Florida warehouse that verifies the product... Then sends the info to their China headquarters... Takes about 1 -2 weeks depending on mail and how fast the Florida warehouse gets around to it.  Another time a few small things never got to me and they gave me a store credit.  Customer service was good but slow.  I don't know how well they would process a full refund... Since I agreed upon store credit all times.  That and batteries have taken over a month to get to me on occasion.  I'm not advocating they be placed on the list... But if you're on the fence at least about fasttech... They're legit... Sometimes slow, but they have taken care of any issues I have had.    Gearbest seems ok... But I feel their customer service isn't quite as professional as fasttechs... Mostly good experiences seem to come from them... But they seem to really fuck up a handful of things.  This is coming from a guy who gets an occasional cheap free thing to review from them.  I have also bought 50-75 worth of stuff from them too.  One light had a faulty switch but I did not pursue a refund or exchange, and instead gave it away.  That was about $25.

flashlight,3deqy6,AzraelGrin,5,Wed Jul 15 18:21:44 2015 UTC,"The Nitecore P12 will be a closer option to the TN12, and it's a bit cheaper. The Nitecore MH12 is identical to the P12, but has built in USB charging. Personally, I recommend against the TN12 for many reasons. See the post below for my thoughts.   https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/3coic2/need_help_choosing_a_flashlight/csxjx3p  TL;DR: Pay special attention to the mode levels of the TN12. 0.3 to 20 Lumens is fine. 20 to 280 is a HUGE jump. Roughly four times the lumens is about twice the brightness to our eyes, so that jump is about 4 times the brightness. 280 to 800 is less than double the brightness. 800 Lumens has the same runtime as 1050 and your eyes won't be able to see much difference. ThruNite's redeeming quality is the Neutral white option.  The Nitecore MH20 is shorter than the P12/TN12 and would probably make a better EDC light. What were you looking to do with your light? I especially like the fact that this light gives you instant access to Moonlight and Turbo modes, no matter what mode you left it in. That's one of my gripes with the P12/TN12 - if you're outside using 1000 Lumens, and turn off the light and go to bed, you'll turn it back on at 1000 Lumens and have to cycle through to get the mode you want. Be sure to check out /u/mcfarlie6996's review of the MH20 over at bestlight.io.   The MH20 has better mode spacing than even the P12/MH12, and it's WAY better than the TN12. I'd like to see customizable modes, but the only real problem I have with that light is the fact that it's cool white only. I'd love to see a Neutral White tint available in Nitecore lights.  So if I don't like the cool white of the MH20, but like the design and interface, what do I recommend? The Zebralight SC62w, of course! Smaller head than the MH20, front clicky button with instant access to different customizable modes, and a great warm tint. Check out the interface in this review here and be sure to check out /r/SC62masterrace for more reviews and pictures and stuff."
flashlight,3deqy6,fluffman86,2,Wed Jul 15 18:52:15 2015 UTC,"Oh wow. That was extremely helpful. I just want a nice flashlight, that is bright. Also, I'm currently in school to be a cop, so I really like the tactical look of the MH20. I was leaning towards the MH20, but I think you just sealed the deal for me. :)"
flashlight,3deqy6,fluffman86,3,Wed Jul 15 18:58:53 2015 UTC,"That's why I asked what you'd be using it for. As a cop, you're going to want a light you can hold and control while also shooting your pistol. That means you're going to want a tailswitch and a tactical light, not so much an EDC light.   Therefore I recommend the Nitecore P10 or the Nitecore P20. They each have a momentary power button on the tail, plus the mode button is ALSO on the tail, and the mode button ALSO doubles as a momentary button for instant access to strobe.   Then if you also want a smaller, less tacticaool light get the Zebralight SC62w since it'll be a good bit smaller than the P10/P20 and ride in a pocket more easily, while the P10/P20 pull holster duty."

See the recent review by emarkd  ArmyTek Predator or Viking are kind of mid range throwers.   Convoy C8 would be a great inexpensive choice. Check mountain electronics for customization options like de-doming. Right customization could get you around 400 meters, but others know more about them than me.

Assuming around 0.5A at 4.5V (down to 3 or so), 3 D batteries should provide at most 20 hours.

flashlight,3dcrsz,Redarax,3,Wed Jul 15 06:45:14 2015 UTC,"Your eyes need something like 3.5 times the lumens to see double the brightness because we see brightness in a logarithmic scale.  Going from 240 to 500 won't look like a lot, but 240 to 1000 is noticeable.  There's a reason they do outputs like that.  I personally would prefer something around 500 lumens just for battery life, but also keep in mind that the 1000 lumens is going to drop to 5-600 lumens after five minutes or so because of heat anyway.  Some other lights in that size with built-in charging options are the Fenix UC35 and Olight S30R (get the new version about to ship)."
flashlight,3dcrsz,storl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:01:39 2015 UTC,The s30r interests me a lot.  What's the new version you're talking about? And also the s30r is the same as the s30r II baton on their website correct?

flashlight,3dcrsz,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:35:53 2015 UTC,"Your eyes need something like 3.5 times the lumens to see double the brightness because we see brightness in a logarithmic scale   I second that. I got a Qlite driver with custom modes from Mountain Electronics running an XM-L2 U3 at 3.04A with 100% and 50% modes. The difference between 1200lm and 600 looked like maybe 10%. The driver malfunctioned shortly after I got it, so I asked for different modes when I sent it back for replacement. 100% -> 40% only looks like about a 25% reduction in brightness, which is exactly what I was going for; it's the manual step-down from full power to avoid burning your hand, but still a good high mode.  I'm rambling here. 240lm will look half as bright as 1000. That's a reasonably choice for mode spacing, but of course, there are other lights with their own ideas about mode spacing for anyone with different preferences."
flashlight,3dcrsz,fluffman86,3,Wed Jul 15 14:10:57 2015 UTC,"That jump is actually only going to look twice as bright because of how we perceive output as /u/storl mentioned. Any jump less than that wouldn't look like it really changed much at all. The spacing is actually fairly good on the MH12 IMO and I own one myself if you have any questions in particular. I really do think you'd really like it.   Just to make a note of it so you're aware, the Olight S30R II uses a charging dock and doesn't have a micro USB port in the actual flashlight just so you're aware. Besides that though it looks like a great flashlight and Olight has shortcut modes for instant access to Moonlight, Turbo, & Strobe which is really convenient."
flashlight,3dcrsz,storl,2,Wed Jul 15 12:17:04 2015 UTC,"Yep. I have the Nitecore P12 which is the same light as the MH12, just without the onboard USB recharging. I really like the modes for the most part. 70 is sometimes just a little too bright, but otherwise I pretty much leave it set for that.   The Fenix UC35 that was also mentioned has the following modes: 14, 50, 180, 460, 960. The mode spacing is nice, but the Fenix lacks a moonlight (1 lumen or less) mode, SOS and Beacon modes, a battery voltage check, and it cannot tailstand. All of that adds up to where it's not a good buy, IMO.  I think you'll do fine with the MH12."
flashlight,3dcrsz,mcfarlie6996,2,Wed Jul 15 15:06:06 2015 UTC,"I actually prefer the charging via magnetic like Klarus or via a separate charger like Klarus.  Yeah, it's proprietary, but those little rubber flaps love to come undone and micro-USB ports are known for being finnicky."
flashlight,3dcrsz,JimTokle,2,Thu Jul 16 03:03:17 2015 UTC,The Klarus types I wouldn't mind so much but the Olight having such a large base would be a deal breaker if I'm looking for a light on the go.
flashlight,3dbicj,mousersix,6,Wed Jul 15 00:02:04 2015 UTC,"Ability to focus and spread the beam pattern. Sometimes I will use the flashlight to point to objects so having a tight spot focus is nice.   You probably don't need this. Zoom lenses are actually pretty inefficient, robbing you of as much as 40% of your output. Modern pocketable lights can get usable light out to 200 meters without the need to change focus. Is that far enough, or do you need more?  The Nitecore P12 is a good option for about $45. It has a mode switch separate from the main power button, so you won't change modes by accident, and it remembers the last mode you were in. It runs on a rechargeable 18650 battery, and I've seen kits on Amazon with a battery and charger as low as $55. The MH12 is the same light with onboard USB charging. It's $70ish, and the battery is included. Both can use CR123 batteries as well."

Most flashlights are tested, by the manufacturer, for 1 to 1.5 meter, 3 to ~5 feet, impacts on a hard surface. The ones that tell you they do, at any rate. The flashlights that can survive longer falls will probably break your budget.  On an earlier point, what do you mean by 'nearly equal'?"

The ML-102 from the budget starter kit can charge 18650s from a USB solar panel, which might be good for some camping scenarios (and utterly worthless for others)."
flashlight,3db64f,Zak,2,Wed Jul 15 01:21:54 2015 UTC,"Any particular reason for the 2xAA battery configuration? I ask, because you can get much higher runtimes in a battery not much thicker than an AA and a little longer. Here's a post by /u/Zak titled You want an 18650 flashlight, even if you think you don't.  So at your current price range, the Nitecore P12 is a great choice.  You can get it in this kit or that kit.  You might save a couple dollars buying piecemeal, though, since the P12 has dropped in price a bit and the kits haven't.  Battery option 1  Then you could pick up a Nitecore i2 or i4 or d2 or d4 from illumn.com and that'd help you save on shipping. That battery and those chargers are cheaper than the amazon options below, but shipping costs vary the price a bit.   Battery option 2  These Olight batteries have the same basic Panasonic NCR18650B as the Keeppower or the Nitecore 3400mah batteries above, but each have been wrapped by their respective company with a protection circuit.  If you want integrated charging on the light itself, then you'd want to check out the Nitecore MH12. It's the same light as the P12 with the same modes, just has the built-in micro USB charger. I can see how that'd come in handy, but I'd just as soon save the money and swap in a fresh battery and charge the dead one externally.   So now that the links are out of the way, why get the P12 over a AA light? Well, you get a lot of power in a pretty small package. All the way up to 1000 Lumens, plus a 240 Lumen mode, a 70 Lumen mode that'll last more than a day on a single charge, and a 1 Lumen moonlight mode that's really useful. It also has some pretty neat hidden modes like Strobe, SOS, and Beacon, and it can tailstand like a candle. The mode button has a small LED under it that will read out the batter voltage and blink when it's time to charge up.  Here it is with some of my EDC stuff.  Here it is next to a 1xAA light and a tube a lib balm.  Overall, it's a pretty swell light.  Edit: Posted all of those american links for a P12 and forgot you were in Canada. I had planned most of this post in my head before seeing your budget or location. Amazon.ca has the Thrunite TN12 available for about $55, and it's a very similar light. I don't like the mode spacing as much, but it's still a fine light and it's available in Neutral White.  Now that I've suggested that, let me say that I still like the light, but I mostly carry a Zebralight SC62w now. It puts out almost as much light as the P12, but in a much smaller package. That's the SC62w between the 1xAA little cheap cree you saw above and a lantern, along with the P12 on the right. I know it's out of your price range, but well worth it, IMO. You'd use the same 18650 batteries and chargers that I linked above for the P12.

flashlight,3db64f,jay76,2,Wed Jul 15 01:06:35 2015 UTC,The jump from 20 lumens to 280 is what throws me off.
flashlight,3db64f,fluffman86,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:12:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like /u/Zak said it compares favorably as far as the general idea for a light, and the people who have one like it.  But like you said, There's not much difference to the eye between 800 and 1050, and they both have the same runtime! That's just craziness.  And while 20 is probably fairly useful, 280 is blindingly bright in most situations. I know the 240 Lumen mode is on my P12, so I mostly use the 70 Lumen mode. But the 70 Lumen mode is a little too bright for some situations, and I really wish it had a 15-20 Lumen mode. Meanwhile, I've never wished for anything between 240-300 and 800-1000. I just haven't seen that as a very useful range.  My ideal modes for a P12/PD35/TN12 styled light would be 0.5-1, 15-20, 50-80, 250ish, 1000. So that's 5 modes total. PD35 is missing moonlight, TN12 has a stupid 800 Lumen mode and misses a useful ""everyday"" strength, and the P12 misses a low, but hits the mark everywhere else.  Just as a reference, I keep my SC62w set for 30 with a double click, 140 with a single click, and 3.4 with a press hold. I find that to be really useable on a daily basis, with 0.6, 65, and 930 set as the quick alternate modes with a double tap. The P12 has a 70 (instead of 30) that's a little too bright and the 240 and 1000 is rarely used because they are insanely bright for most indoor applications."

flashlight,3db64f,dkon777,2,Wed Jul 15 13:06:58 2015 UTC,No that's probably legit since that's what they sell for in the US. Nitecore is a Chinese company so it makes sense.

I need more than one 18650 because most of my flashlight use is when I go camping, and I am away from a charging thing for at least a few days. In the long term, the 18650s are most likely better value for money, but I don't have the money right now to pay for all of that at once.

Sounds like you need this: https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/3d0cvb/the_budget_flashlight_starter_kit/  Save money on the front end with a cheaper light, then batteries can be as little as $14 for a 2-pack. That 2-pack will last as long as 8 AA alkaline batteries on a single charge. I'd rather save up and drop the money in a solar charger and 18650s. You'll be able to pack WAY lighter, too. I've never been in a position where I could buy batteries but couldn't charge them. Not that I would buy them at a camp store where they're closer to $1/each.   And if you absolutely positively cannot swing enough money for a light and 4-6 18650 batteries, then I'd suggest getting the $5 mini cree 1xaa light from Amazon for now and letting that hold you over, rather than spending $50 now for (an admittedly nice) 2xAA battery that's not as bright and doesn't last as long on a set of batteries."

It seems far less than 2x a single 18650 battery light, but OTOH this is designed to not step down, and other lights aren't measured by actual output in life but by the time it runs when set on the given mode. Although the runtime is still pretty awesome, I don't really go camping often (never, actually), so it won't be a problem for me.

You're right. 240lm for 7:45 hours is barely better than the P12's 240lm for 6 hours, and the P12's FL1 chart is with the 2600 mAh cell too. The P12 does not step down in 240lm mode, so it can't be that. Runtime to dead is 7.3 hours with a 3100 mAh cell on 240lm in the P12 test I linked, which is actually slightly better than the calculated 7.15 hours, so I don't think it's that the P12's advertised specs are too optimistic."

flashlight,3d9srd,zeroair,2,Wed Jul 15 01:12:39 2015 UTC,I don't think it has to do with the cast in particular and I also don't think it a significant difference vs screwed pieces but the fact that the screwed pieces are just surfaces pressed tight against each other acts as a resistance sort to say of heat being effectively transferred throughout the body. Don't quote me on this and it's just my best educated guess.

flashlight,3d8igt,utspg1980,6,Tue Jul 14 13:51:12 2015 UTC,"Yes. Amazon is pretty good at policing bad sellers, and anything sold by Amazon itself is going to be what it says it is. Just watch out for the marketing: performance claims about super-cheap Chinese flashlights are usually lies. Also, don't buy batteries or chargers with ""fire"" in the name, as that part might not be false advertising. Daily use, but with self defense in mind. Lumens are a measure of total light output; candela is a measure of intensity. A 100w incandescent light bulb is about 1600lm and 100cd - it won't blind anybody. A flashlight with only 350lm but 5000cd will definitely ruin an attacker's night vision. A flashlight that uses the 18650 Lithium-ion battery is a good idea, which includes most USB-charging lights, but many more that use an external charger. The Nitecore MH12 is probably the most popular USB charging light on /r/flashlight right now, but the Zebralight SC62w, which is much smaller seems to be the overall favorite."
flashlight,3d8igt,Zak,7,Tue Jul 14 11:28:40 2015 UTC,"anything sold by Amazon itself is going to be what it says it is   Not trying to be argumentative, but this isn't necessarily true. The issue is an Amazon practice commonly called ""co-mingling"".  It works like this:  Suppose Seller A is a legit business selling good products. This could be an authorized third party seller or Amazon itself.  They have authentic merchandise which is sent to Amazons warehouses for fulfillment.  Now assume Seller B is a crook selling counterfeit goods. These are the same goods that Seller A sells, only they're  cheap knockoffs.  They also send their items to Amazons warehouses for fulfillment.  Now you come along as a careful consumer and order an item.  You choose Seller A because they seem more trustworthy, or maybe because its Amazon themselves.  But here comes the problem - Amazon doesn't keep separate inventories. Items from Seller A and Seller B are co-mingled in the warehouse because, as far as Amazon is concerned, they're the same item with the same sku. So the one you receive is the one that was in the closest bin to the warehouse worker who pulled the order, no matter which seller stocked it in for fulfillment.  You just received a counterfeit item from a trustworthy seller because of Amazons warehousing practices.  The good news is that Amazon is very quick to handle these sorts of problems when they happen, but its still on you as the buyer to report it and deal with the returns. So Im not saying nobody should be buying from amazon, I still do it very often myself, but you can't assume anything bought there is completely safe if it comes out of an Amazon warehouse."
flashlight,3d8igt,emarkd,4,Tue Jul 14 12:30:46 2015 UTC,"The issue is an Amazon practice commonly called ""co-mingling""   I didn't know about that. Interesting. Come to think of it, I've seen ""sold by X and fulfilled by Amazon"" a few times."
flashlight,3d8igt,Zak,6,Tue Jul 14 13:33:44 2015 UTC,"Most Amazon sellers use Amazon for fulfillment because its a lot easier than doing your own shipping, plus its the only way to get your items eligible for Prime.  If it comes to you in an amazon branded box then it came from their warehouse.  There are sellers that handle it themselves though, often because Amazon charges more if they do the shipping.  So if you buy from a known trustworthy seller who ships themselves then you've got no worries.  But then shipping is often slower and those orders are never eligible for Prime.  You'll see sellers offering ""free 2-day shipping"" sometimes to make up for it."

Unless you can't use any other real option as self defense a flashlight is okay. i.e. if a guy pulls a knife on me i'd rather have a pistol than a flashlight. You are basically buying yourself a hypothetical couple of seconds on a determined person. Use these seconds to get a head start running/screaming.

It's also good in combination with a pistol, or mounted on a pistol to make it easier to be sure what you think is happening is actually happening before you shoot somebody.

Mostly for daily use or Self Defense?   Daily use, never have needed it for Self Defense yet.   How much lumens is enough to blind/dazzle someone if they are attacking you?   It's more about the intensity of the hotspot but 300+ is a good starting point.    For a noob, what is a good one for self defense/in case of emergency? Is charging by USB a good feature? Are there any trade offs? The smaller the better.   There's nothing wrong with USB charging and it's an excellent feature to have on the go when traveling. I like the Fenix UC35 although the Nitecore MH12 is more or less a little better. Pretty much, the UC35 has better mode spacing but the MH12 can tail-stand, has Strobe memory, voltage check, & moonlight."

The smaller the better.   The main trade off of having a built in USB charger is size/weight. You have to increase the size/weight of the flashlight to incorporate the charging mechanism.  If your main priority is to have the flashlight as small as possible, you should look at a separate charger.  USB charging is also slower, I'm told."
flashlight,3d8igt,Zak,5,Tue Jul 14 13:45:26 2015 UTC,"If your main priority is to have the flashlight as small as possible, you should look at a separate charger.   True, though the Nitecore MH12 is the same size and weight as the P12 and the MH20 is pretty small.  USB charging does not need to be slower than an external charger for a single 18650, but it depends on the USB power supply you're using. A 500ma PC USB port won't charge as fast as a 2A tablet charger. It also depends on the charging circuit in that particular flashlight."

flashlight,3d8igt,Zak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:01:23 2015 UTC,A bit of extra length doesn't bug me when carrying with a pocket clip. Having the tail stick out a bit makes it easier to grab anyway. Extra width is extra obnoxious though. It's the main reason I haven't pulled the trigger on an SC62; the head diameter is about the same as the SRT5 I currently carry.
flashlight,3d8igt,brandon7s,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:09:32 2015 UTC,"I prefer to buy all my stuff on Amazon, since I have Prime. If you get it from a Prime enabled item then returning it is a piece of cake for any reason, including fakes (which has never happened to me). I use mine for when I run, which is at night most of the time. I also typically run on wooded greenways where there are no streetlights. Without a flashlight I wouldn't be able to see even a couple feet in front of me. My other main use for them is finding things in the dark, haha. I don't live or go to high-crime-risk areas, so never had to worry about using a light for self defense. I certainly could if I need to, though. I can blind myself with about 300-400 lumens, just by being silly and flashing a mirror in front of me. I'd go with something 700+ lumens just to be sure though.  The best light for discouraging potential aggressors would be the light that you'll carry the most. This means you need one that will always have a charged battery in it and be small enough not to mind carrying. USB charging feature is handy for folks who aren't general light hobbyist who have several different batteries on hand to pick from and who have multi-port chargers. If you have one light and one battery, I'd go with a USB charging light. Size is a bit more personal. I like my lights to be less than 4 inches long, which is why I love my Sunwayman V11R and my Zebralight SC62. I'm more inclined to carry those than my 4+ inch lights just due to the size."
flashlight,3d8cyz,Spaced_Inv8r,3,Tue Jul 14 08:28:37 2015 UTC,"So I reviewed this one back in January, and it seems to have been my least watched review.  I'm guessing because of brand recognition.  This is my 2nd most used light after my Armytek Predator Pro, and my loaner light.  I've simplified the light and gave it three modes.  On/off controlled with the tail switch and the electric switch up front controls the three modes- moonlight, mid, high.  That said, the light is kind of expensive.  And it's hard to find on sale.  I was able to grab my Armytek at a recent sale for $55 instead of $109.  I feel like this is an awesome $50 light but not an $80 light."

However it has 4 well spaced modes and IMO, the beam pattern is quite useful. I appreciate the extra throw vs the popular 1” flashlights. I also like the 5000K tint of the neutral white model a little bit better than many of the warmer “neutral” tints. Likewise, my PT10 is one of my most used flashlights.  The PT10 is discontinued, but can be found at a discount (due to a very minor defect in the battery indicator) for about $44 from illumn."
flashlight,3d8cyz,mcfarlie6996,3,Tue Jul 14 09:41:30 2015 UTC,"I've seen a few reviews of the PT10 and it looks like they improved the things that needed it on the PT11.  It's rugged and solid and flexible in its operation.  I feel like the programming could be just a bit refined, and it seems there are a bit too many arbitrary parameters that can be customized.  But it's an easy flashlight to operate once you've programmed it, which is why it's a good loaner or even you're go to light.  Turn it on here... Change modes here.  And I don't mean the $40 retail as a slight... I feel like many fenix lights are overpriced too.  My rationale is, if you can get a cheap well made light for $20-25 then a $40-50 light should be a big improvement.  I'd say the armytek is about a 70 light in my opinion."

Sorry /u/AbraKedavra :P  Given OPs budget and the fact that he's in Canada, I think ArmyTek would be a great choice for him. ArmyTek lights also tend to be rated for their drop/shock/water resistance, while Zebralight isn't.   All that said, I wouldn't trade my SC62w for a Prime at all. The Zebralight interface is awesome and usually pretty consistent across lights, while ArmyTek isn't. Plus, the SC62w is a bit smaller than the Prime, and I think the button is much better - the Prime button sticks out just a little, while the SC62w button is deeply recessed and easier to find.   So yeah, top choice is still Zebralight, but if you're going to pay an arm and a leg to get one shipped to Canada, then I think ArmyTek is a fine option as well."

If you're looking for long term storage then I agree with the others that you should use CR123 batteries because they have excellent shelf-life but do not try to charge these types in these flashlights. They're non-rechargeable. 18650 batteries, although have higher capacity than 2 CR123 batteries, slowly drain a little quicker than CR123 batteries and after 2 months or so would probably match in capacity because of how much quicker the 18650 batteries drain.

flashlight,3d7xj9,MountainMike79,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:00:49 2015 UTC,I love my PD35! I carry it as a backup on duty. It is a little big for off duty carry but it comes with a holster that I'll throw on my belt on some off days.
flashlight,3d7xj9,bigpapadragon,3,Tue Jul 14 17:59:30 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend he check out the Nitecore SRT7, the Olight M18 Striker and the Klarus XT11. All of these put out 800-1000 lumens and run on a single rechargeable 18650 battery, which is the battery of choice for flashlights these days. As a backup, they will run on two CR123s, which have a very long shelf life.  I chose three examples with very different user interfaces to show some of the variety available suitable for police work.   The SRT7 has infinitely variable brightness, multiple blinky modes and secondary colored LEDs. Control over all this is by rotating a ring to the desired mode. The cool thing is you can tell what mode it's in without turning it on by feeling the detents on the ring, so it's not likely you'll get modes you don't want. The M18 Striker has only high, low and strobe modes, and always starts on high. There's only the one button. It's extremely simple, which may be exactly what a cop wants in a high-stress situation. The XT11 has a tail switch and a mode button, also on the tail. Pressing the main switch from off always gets you high. Pressing the mode button from off gets you strobe, which may be desirable to disorient an aggressive person."

You can't get much smaller and brighter than that. Plus, the neutral tint is much better for everyday use, IMO.  That said, while I love the side switch, if he doesn't have a nice light with a tailswitch for using with his gun, or a gun-mounted light, I'd recommend the Nitecore P10 or P20. They have 2 buttons on the tail. The primary button turns the light on and off, or can be held for momentary power. The Mode button will change modes when the light is on, but can be held for an instant strobe mode."

flashlight,3d4nrm,tonyhburns,7,Mon Jul 13 14:22:06 2015 UTC,"The only disadvantage I see with that light is the jump from 7 lumens to 459 lumens. The T25C2 has a similar beam pattern, and adds an 85 lumen mode.  IMO, a 70 - 100 lumen mode is a very useful; especially with that beam pattern. Having that mode available will also extend the runtime significantly.  The other flashlight that is about that size that I've been considering the is the new Armytek Dobermann. Note, this is just an FYI; not a recommendation. Personally I'm waiting for some reviews before I take that leap myself."
flashlight,3d4nrm,nm1000,2,Mon Jul 13 17:18:17 2015 UTC,The only disadvantage I see with that light is the jump from 7 lumens to 459 lumens.   Holy shit that's stupid. There is a Med mode(208Lm) but it's a part of the Tactical program(Strobe-Med-Turbo).  Armytek is a bit odd from light to light and you really need to look at the manual to see how the UI is because there's some that are nice and others that are unwanted. I'll look more into the Dobermann to see if the UI is practical.

TX25C2 for example:   Twist the head to select between three output levels. You can pre-select the desired output level before turning on the flashlight.  To access auxiliary levels, starting at head tight position (1st level), loosen to 3rd level and then tighten the head within one second to enter auxiliary setting. Repeat to cycle through all settings. Turn off the light or loosen the head to quit."

flashlight,3d2mr1,imautoparts,6,Mon Jul 13 00:59:29 2015 UTC,Looks to be an older version of this. The specs say it's a 100 (from the bulb type) or 168 (from the advertised power consumption) watt halogen producing 4100 lumens.  The higher wattage number is more consistent with the advertised output.

flashlight,3d2mr1,Magneticitist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:39:07 2015 UTC,But IR is heat energy. One of the properties of LEDs is that they only radiate a very narrow spectrum.  This is why white LEDs use a UV LED to illuminate an RGB phosphor coating (like florescent lighting). Brighter LED bulbs require heatsinks because the byproduct heat generated is not transmitted as IR energy the way they are in incandescent bulbs. If a similarly powered flashlight were LED I would assume it would have burnt the user's hands long before the paper or cup.
flashlight,3d2mr1,Calamity_Jesus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:29:11 2015 UTC,"There's more IR than you might think in white LEDs, generated by the phosphor, especially with warm tints, though far less than incandescent. Visible light is also absorbed as heat, and I've heard of very high output LED flashlights that could scorch paper well before the body gets too hot to hold."

The Nitecore MT21A has a throw of 200 meters while the Fenix PD35 TAC also has a throw of 200 meters. This means their hotspot is the same intensity although the PD35 TAC has 4 times the output.

These aren't really custom-fitted; the Noctigon 3x board and Carlco 3up lenses are commercially available items.

flashlight,3d1l4q,tf2honeybadger,4,Sun Jul 12 19:46:39 2015 UTC,"Why not both? I've heard good things about Fenix support, though I don't own a Fenix myself. I'd contact them, and they'll probably have you send it in, and while you wait you can get something with standard 18650s.  If you want to stick with Fenix, then check out the UC35. It's just like a PD35, but has built in USB charging. The mode button is near the front and it supports standard 18650s.  If you want to keep the mode button at the rear, check out the Nitecore P10 and P20. They don't have a USB port though.  There's lots of other good lights out there, too, so before I overload you with suggestions, what are you looking for in a light?"
flashlight,3d1l4q,fluffman86,3,Sun Jul 12 20:38:14 2015 UTC,"They're very good. A while ago I had an issue with an LD20, they asked me to send the head back to them. I'm in the UK but apparently mine came through their German distributor so their UK distributor wouldn't be able to do anything with it. I said I would be able to send it to Germany and they said I would have to send it to their repair facility in China (why the even told me about Germany I don't know) or they could send a new replacement head. The LD20 is discontinued now so the replacement head was from an LD22 which was a small but very welcome upgrade. They sent it fairly quickly.  Whether or not you want to replace it, it'll be worth emailing them to see what they'll do."
flashlight,3d1er4,ninjamailman,7,Sun Jul 12 18:55:08 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure what you're looking for is a Zebralight SC62w. See /r/sc62masterrace for tons of links and commentary on that light. I carry one daily and it's awesome. As much as 930 Lumens and as little as 0.01 Lumens. Instant access to any mode you choose - 11 total + hidden flashing modes. You don't have to cycle through them at all.   It uses a single 18650 battery. I'd recommend a keeppower 3400mah from illumn.com (~$12) or an Olight from amazon (2 for $25).   For a charger I recommend a Nitecore i2, d2, i4, or d4, also available on illumn or Amazon.   Watch this video to get a good look at the light https://youtu.be/EWJFQegalhU"
flashlight,3d1er4,fluffman86,3,Sun Jul 12 19:32:31 2015 UTC,Sweet yeah that definitely seems to be a popular light over here. I'll be sure to check that out! Thanks for the info on the batteries as well.
flashlight,3d1er4,fluffman86,3,Sun Jul 12 20:53:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah that thing will blow the P2 out of the water. Less than half and inch thicker, but more than an inch shorter. The button is on the side, deeply recessed so it's easy to find without being easy to activate in your pocket. I've never had mine turn on when I didn't want it to. If you're really worried about accidental activation you can twist the tail cap a quarter turn to lock out the button."
flashlight,3d1er4,mcfarlie6996,3,Sun Jul 12 21:08:38 2015 UTC,"Just a note to everyone. Although there's 11 modes, you only have access to 6 of them at any given time. The other 5 modes are used to be programed in place of half of the 6 modes as to take the place of another mode. The programing is really easy though and can be set up and changed in the matter of 12 seconds(I just timed myself). All in all the SC62w will be one hell of an awesome EDC."
flashlight,3d1er4,fluffman86,2,Sun Jul 12 21:10:02 2015 UTC,"I've been reading a little more about it and all the modes sound complicated when written out but every review/comment I read says it's easy so that wouldn't worry me. Any particular reason why SC62w and not any other variation? Is that a ""better"" color?"
flashlight,3d1er4,mcfarlie6996,3,Sun Jul 12 21:28:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah the light is really easy to use in practice.   I recommend the SC62w (warm / neutral tint) because I prefer the color. If you happen to look at beam shots online of most lights, they'll take place on a white wall. So if you compare a cool white or pure white light on a white wall to a warm tint on a white wall, then the warm tint will look yellow and nasty.  But in real life, when you're trying to tell that orange wire from the red one in a computer case, or when you're walking around in the woods, the neutral or warm tint is going to look much nicer.   Think of it as the difference between an incandescent lightbulb and a fluorescent lightbulb. Generally, most people will find the light from the incandescent, even though a little yellower, to be more pleasing."

The SC62 is the Cool White version and although it's technically brighter, you will not visually be able to tell a difference of 10% in output. The ""w"" stands for warm and is much more appealing to your eyes along with colors of objects look more natural."

flashlight,3d1er4,fluffman86,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:25:26 2015 UTC,I always refer to them as hidden because you don't cycle through them with the press hold. So many other lights out there you have to cycle through every mode to got back to low that a lot of folks don't want strobe. It's nice to have strobe as long as I don't have to see them every day.
flashlight,3d1er4,Magneticitist,2,Mon Jul 13 12:42:02 2015 UTC,"lol i likes some hidden modes.. and after much consideration i can agree to the zebralight being one of the top superiors, but i feel like the Nitecore MH20 is edging it out right now in my mind. The Zebralight also seems so small framed, especially at the head, i don't see how it can maintain a true ~3A draw for long enough without literally getting too hot. if i knew it was just generally brighter than the MH20 then i would end up going with the SC62 instead."
flashlight,3d1er4,fluffman86,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:24:29 2015 UTC,"MH20 looks great, but the bigger head is a bit of a drawback and the lack of a neutral white option is a deal breaker.   The Zebralight SC600w Mk II is a better choice if you're worried about heat dissipation and better throw. You're right that the SC62w gets hot quick."
flashlight,3d1er4,Magneticitist,2,Mon Jul 13 20:16:19 2015 UTC,so the consensus is that the neutral white option pretty much appears the brightest?
flashlight,3d1er4,firematt422,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:36:57 2015 UTC,"No, cool white looks a bit brighter and generally is a few Lumens brighter in a given light.   But neutral or warm light looks better and is more useful."

There is also the Microstream which is the same but with only 1 AAA instead of 2 so it's about half as long but shorter life.  I know rechargables seem to reign supreme around here, but honestly, I'd rather just throw out the old batteries and put in new. I've had my Stylus for 3 months and it's still on the first set.  The Stylus runs $20-30 depending where you get it, Microstream I've seen anywhere from $12-20."

flashlight,3d0vep,emarkd,3,Sun Jul 12 19:14:22 2015 UTC,"This is a good point, but how do we represent that in the list or communicate it effectively?  I mean, you're basically talking about value so should brands be ranked somehow for value?"
flashlight,3d0vep,Zak,4,Sun Jul 12 20:12:33 2015 UTC,"It might be better to simply say ""these manufacturers are generally known to build quality products and are more or less honest in advertising"" or some such. To me, that doesn't imply anything about value for the money, while ""you should not be disappointed"" implies that nobody is selling an equal or superior product for a quarter the price.  And for beginners reading this post, no that's not even a slight exaggeration. I'd rather carry and use a $50 Nitecore P12 than a $200 Surefire P1R. The Nitecore is smaller, brighter, has adequate modes and has a better user-interface. The Surefire might be better built, but not better enough to matter."
flashlight,3d0vep,fluffman86,2,Sun Jul 12 20:24:14 2015 UTC,"I like the phrasing you used in your first paragraph if we want to stay pretty neutral. Personally, I wouldn't mind having a section that says something along the lines of ""these manufacturers are generally known to build quality products and are more or less honest in advertising, but also generally do NOT provide a good value for the money."" Then you could have some of the traditionally great flashlight brands like LED Lenser, Surefire, Streamlight, and Maglite listed as a quick reference."
flashlight,3d0vep,Zak,3,Sun Jul 12 20:58:10 2015 UTC,"I'd normally try to stay even more neutral than that, but the mindshare these companies have is pretty huge, compounded by the fact that it's nearly impossible to find good flashlights in retail stores.

As for flair I also think it'd be a cool idea too but I believe the reason they've never done this before is because they want the dealer's flair to stand out in comments.

Rayus flashlights.  I know many people aren't that familiar with them, but I have reviewed and own 4 of their lights.   They offer high end features like programability and advanced drivers.  They are similar in quality to Sunwayman and Nitecore.  I think they only started out last year.  They are based in China, as evidenced on their website- and through personal experience when dealing with their customer service.  A few US websites like Illumn and Tech Tool Supply carry them.  Skilhunt is another.  I have reviewed three of their lights.  The DS10, the H02, and the H02C.  I wouldn't consider them a budget light, but they are a bit more budget friendly than Fenix, and the like.  But they make unique, decent quality lights nonetheless.  They are made and headquartered in China.    Lumintop.  Made in China and manufactured there.

I typically run my PD35 in the ~200 lumen mode, with occasional jumps up to 500.    Also you'll probably want a little flood in your light. When I used my LD20 as my bike light, I found myself having to turn the lamp further into the turn to see where I was going. If you're mounting on to your helmet instead of the handlebars, disregard this.    I've used these for mounting my lights, they're pretty flexible: http://www.amazon.com/Two-Fish-Lockblocks-U-Lock-Mount/dp/B001P9EWKE    Does Japan have any restrictions on bicycle headlights? Kinda like Germany where they're only allowed to output so much. That's also why German bike lights have more optics to focus the light on the ground rather than letting it blind people coming the other way."
flashlight,3d0isr,johnpc,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:42:08 2015 UTC,AFAIK Japan doesn't have any technical restrictions as far as headlights go.  Basically (again AFAIK) the law says 'you must ride with a rear reflector and a front light after dark' with the penalty for not having one being around $500.

I never really cared about flashlights, I only bought a decent one to use as a headlight for my bicycle. That's the only reason I visited this subreddit. I visited the other day to find a good camping lantern and subscribed just out of habit I think.  I was on a tighter budget than you, and I wound up with a Fenix E25. I use it on the medium setting which is 55 lumens. It's plenty bright. The high setting at 130 would probably piss off drivers, and it wouldn't last long enough for my uses. I will say, using a flashlight as a headlight is not ideal. I have since switched to Revolights and I haven't looked back. I do kind of want a tiny flashlight to mount on my helmet though, for seeing street signs. But the weight is really annoying because it pulls at your helmet, and just kind of feels weird.  You want the Portland Design Works Danger Zone for a rear light. Just trust me. Grab their 15mm wrench as well if you ride FG/SS, it's a lifesaver.  edit: don't bother with LSD NiMHs (Eneloops). Alkaline or lithium rechargeables are the only way to go. The NiMHs just don't provide enough voltage, so the light starts to die very early."

flashlight,3d0isr,MountainMike79,8,Sun Jul 12 15:12:56 2015 UTC,"What you're asking for is not possible with current technology. Flashlights that fit in your pocket cannot dissipate heat quickly enough to maintain 1000 lumens for more than a few minutes without an external source of cooling. Some have a timed step-down. Some have a thermal sensor. Some have nothing, but still lose brightness because LEDs don't work as well when hot.  Furthermore, the largest capacity battery that's generally pocketable, the 18650 does not hold enough energy to power current emitters at 1000 lumens for 2 hours. It takes 9-10 watts to get 1000 lumens, and the best 18650s hold about 12 watt-hours. All other rechargeable batteries have lower energy per volume than the 18650.  What you could get is about 500 lumens for 2 hours, which is roughly the medium mode in a lot of 1x18650 lights. Some thermally-regulated lights will also likely last 2 hours on high at something less than full output. Perception of brightness is logarithmic, so 500lm will actually look about 75% as bright as 1000 and probably produce acceptable results. The Zebralight SC600-II, Zebralight SC62 and Armytek Prime are possibly-suitable thermally-regulated lights.  Your other option is a non-pocketable light with two or more 18650s. Many of these contain a lot more metal and have a lot more surface area to shed heat. Two 18650s can provide 1000lm for two hours with runtime to spare."

There are some really low capacity 18650s out there and it wouldn't surprise me to see them in use in cheap products from China. Note that their claimed capacity is not reality-based (e.g. 6000 mAh claimed; 1200 mAh tested).  With good quality 3400 mAh cells, a high-binned XM-L2 and quality optics, you should get about 75 minutes per cell at 1000lm real-world (aka OTF lumens) initial output or 1200 or so lumens from the LED without the optics (aka LED lumens). Depending on the light's driver, this could stay above 50% for the vast majority of the runtime, or drop considerably during the first 5 minutes.  If you have one of those battery packs that charges from a wall wart, I'd be very suspicious of it using the correct charging algorithm; it might be unsafe. I'd probably build a replacement battery holder and charge the cells externally on a more trustworthy charger."

flashlight,3czqzt,Magneticitist,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:48:29 2015 UTC,"ok so with the XB-D i had 2 to play with. the first i torture tested and decided to see what i could feed it with no heat sink. i was able to run it continuously scorching hot feeding it an amp for long durations and didn't get the hint to stop feeding it til it got to about 2 amps. it finally burned out on me when i fed it 3 amps for a few seconds with no heat sink.  so the 2nd emitter i sinked to the flashlight body, no copper involved all aluminum. i have actually fed it 3 amps for short bursts but not long enough to make any assumptions, and fed it 2 amps for long durations. it takes a little longer but it causes the flashlight to get almost as hot as my XM-L2 light does when fully driven indicating that the emitter is indeed dissipating and enduring some serious heat."
flashlight,3czqzt,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:55:19 2015 UTC,The XB-D is an althernative to the XP-E(2) emitter. It's also rated @ 1A max but of course you can always push things further. Which 3A sounds like an about right breaking point. Here's a graph of the XP-E2 to which the XB-D should have similar but slightly higher numbers if you wanted to know an approximate output.
flashlight,3czqzt,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:01:12 2015 UTC,"ok this was something i was a little curious about when first testing. when i first noticed i was going to be able to push the emitter at twice max rating, it got me wondering if the light output was going to be more efficient than an XM-L2. I'm sure theres a longevity trade-off, but the XB-D is supposed to deliver 135 lumens per watt. At the 3 watt max thats realistically just over 300 lumens just like an XML at 3 watts, but technically the XB-D is supposed to supply just a tad more lumens a that 3 watts. that is a slightly higher efficacy than the XM-L2. So at roughly 6 watts, what would output more lumens? the XB-D or XML?  that graph you linked only shows less than 400 lumens at roughly 6 watts, so is Cree just not advertising the specs right?"
flashlight,3czqzt,RaunchyFeet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:27:55 2015 UTC,"it got me wondering if the light output was going to be more efficient than an XM-L2. I'm sure theres a longevity trade-off, but the XB-D is supposed to deliver 135 lumens per watt.    Well the XM-L is 160 lumens per watt and the XM-L2 is 170 lumens per watt but as the overall output goes up, the lumens per watt goes down.""The XM-L2 LED offers the unique combination of high efficacy and high lumen output at high drive currents, delivering an unprecedented 1198 lumens at 116 lumens-per-watt efficacy at 3A, 25ºC."" Either way the XM-L and XM-L2 will offer more lumens per watt over the XB-D.    That graph you linked only shows less than 400 lumens at roughly 6 watts, so is Cree just not advertising the specs right?   Maybe the original post would help with this answer but one thing you're not taking into factor is heat. You know the candela intensity for throw that all manufacturers show? Well the standards are to take the test reading @ 30 seconds because an LED isn't as effective when it starts heating up. The reason for the difference vs Cree's stats may be be due to the reason that he's using a large copper sinkpad which quickly drains all heat away thus he's able to push the emitters that high. Having a 4 inch copper heatsink isn't exactly an option though in a flashlight."

flashlight,3czpeh,50_Trails_Of_Snails,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:54:47 2015 UTC,"My response whenever this comes up is appropriate here as well, so I'm copying it. Also tagging /u/MixedWithFruit since he's considering one as well.  Oh, and /u/muchape, we could do a better job recommending a light if you tell us more.    I'm going to recommend against the UC35. Below is a chart I made comparing the features of the Nitecore P12, the Fenix PD35, and the Thrunite TN12. Note that the UC35 is the same as the PD35, it just has USB recharging built in. The Nitecore MH12 is the same as the P12, but also has USB recharging.    Nitecore P12 - 2015 Thrunite TN12 Fenix PD35    1000 1050 960   N/A 800 460   240 280 180   70 20 50   1 0.3 14   Strobe Strobe Strobe   Remembers Strobe N/A N/A   SOS N/A N/A   Beacon N/A N/A   Tailstand Tailstand N/A   LED Battery Check N/A N/A   Cool(ish) White Only Optional Neutral White Cool White Only    Strobe is hidden on all three, just hold the mode button to access if you need it. Only the P12 will stay in strobe mode after turning the light off and on. The others you would need to re-enter strobe mode. I think that's a nice tactical feature, and I like having the extra emergency modes as well.  I find the main Lumen levels on the TN12 to be really wonky. The 800 Lumen mode isn't much different than the 1050 mode, and it has the same runtime. Also, the jump from 20 to 280 Lumens is MASSIVE. The one redeeming feature of the TN12 is that it's available in a Neutral White tint. When the TN12 was $45 and the P12 was nearly $60, it was a great deal. Now that the TN12 fluctuates from $45 to $50 and the P12 has dropped to <$45, I just can't recommend the TN12.  The Fenix PD35 is really nice, and the most expensive of the three. The UC35 is the USB rechargeable version of the PD35, like the MH12 is to the P12. The modes are well spaced, without a huge jump between each set. Note that our eyes view light output logarithmically, so it takes about 4x the number of Lumens to appear twice as bright. The two things the PD35 really lacks is that it doesn't have a 1 Lumen or below moonlight mode (which is really useful when it's pitch black as it helps preserve your night vision) and it can't tailstand upright like a candle because the button is too long.   With the P12, you have a pretty big jump from the moonlight 1 Lumen mode up to 70, but I find 70 to be pretty comfortable for most work. 70 to 240 is right at double the brightness, and the jump from 240 to 1000 is right at double the brightness, so I find that to work really well, and while I would like a 15-20 Lumen mode, I've never wanted anything between 240 (which is really really bright) and 1000 (which is STUPID bright).  Oh, and one of the most overlooked features on the P12/MH12 is the battery voltage check. Hold Mode while you click on the tail switch, and it'll read out the current voltage by blinking the little blue LED under the mode button. So 4 blinks, pause, 2 blinks means you have a fully charged 18650 at 4.2 volts.  I also want to throw out that while I love my P12 as a holster light, I've mostly stopped carrying it daily since I got my Zebralight SC62w. I prefer the smaller size, which is easier to hold in my mouth, but I still get nearly the same light output, and I get it in a warmer tint that's just gorgeous. You also get near-instant access to your customizable modes, and much lower low modes are available. See /r/sc62masterrace for lots of extra info.     A little more info: The Olight linked below is nice but uses a proprietary charger that you have to keep with you, while the UC35 and MH12 use standard Micro USB cords. The SC62w that I suggested uses rechargeable batteries as well, but you buy the charger and battery separately."

flashlight,3cys7e,FED321CBA,3,Sun Jul 12 00:38:21 2015 UTC,Is the light output the same between the bars and your brother wants more? Or is his actually dimmer?
flashlight,3cys7e,TFS_Jake,2,Sun Jul 12 01:08:17 2015 UTC,"You don't want to swap the LEDs.  That's a big undertaking, and may not be very productive without other changes anyway.  Here's what I'd do:   Find out which actual emitters are in the thing.  Can you get us a good up-close shot of one of them?  Like with a macro lens camera?  Maybe we can help you figure it out. Measure the current draw.  See if its actually pulling that 24 amps.   From there we can figure out how hard the emitters are actually being driven and if there's anything we can do to drive them harder.  That would be the best way to get more light out of this bar, I think."
flashlight,3cys7e,emarkd,3,Sun Jul 12 01:55:22 2015 UTC,"You don't want to swap the LEDs. That's a big undertaking   Buying that many emitters without the volume discounts the manufacturer gets will also cost more than the product's original price.  The product description say they're ""3 watt"". Based on what I can see of their appearance and what I know to be commonly used, these emitters are likely Cree XP-Gs. Those can take quite a bit more than 3 watts each if you can keep them cool enough."

flashlight,3cys7e,supersillier,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:57:39 2015 UTC,"If the leds are surface mounted soldered, IMO it's worth it to replace them. Desoldering is almost impossible. Plus finding a matching power source is also difficult. Much easier/cost and time effective to either buy one from a more reputable brand which is known to have a lumen output guarantee, or add more lights."
flashlight,3cys7e,Magneticitist,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:29:43 2015 UTC,"if nearly 300 watts is not enough light for him, i think replacing the leds on the board is not going to solve the problem anyway. at that point it would take more than just emitter replacement, you would need to not only replace them but make sure your replacement string is being fed more current. IMO it may be easier to simply increase the total current consumption of the board, being that its probably being driven rather ""safely"". if you can find a way to up the watts going into the board yet also keep the emitters from overheating that would probably be a better bet, although i wouldn't recommend that either unless a lot of forethought and math is done ahead of time."

I'm talking a stupid amount of lumens output"
flashlight,3cys7e,WoodchippersRus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:07:17 2015 UTC,"well just basing my thoughts regarding this idea based on my experiences with emitters and what i have seen in the market, idk if aluminum would get the job done. i'm sure even their factory design can be pushed a little harder, as with most things, and if u were to mill an alu bar with even more mass or intuitive heat dissipating design, then sure i bet you could drive the leds much harder.. but all of that depends on the leds and their ratings. i over drive a lot of leds from 3mm to power emitters as do a lot of other people here, but that doesn't mean in some cases the emitters are not losing some longevity in that process.. something that could take away from having a $100 light bar in the first place.. take a DIY 100 watt emitter for example. have you seen the heat sinks on those suckers? just being able to drive an led @ 100 watts without a FAN is pretty impressive. or ballsy. i mean just try to think of any electronic device that runs that many watts (or 300) without some type of fan. i would imagine with the light bar, part of the physics plays a role being that the emitters are spread out so its like a 300 watt emitter that has its ""emitter cells"" spread out rather than bunched together, making the heat generated by those watts easier to dissipate along an aluminum frame. Copper would surely be an improvement, but why would they spend the money when they can just use alu and make sure they aren't driving heat-magnets.   ok now more directly back to your original point however.. when you say outperform i assume in the context of overall performance per price. i'm sure the guys here could collaborate a more efficient version, but if you are talking just plain building something WAY brighter? fuck yea that would be easy. it would be a monster but if you have a big ass truck with a big ass battery and don't mind burning up your gas to keep the alternator going, or simply have a commercial generator, OR just a mains outlet obviously.. i would just keep adding 100 watt emitters til that 50 inches was used up lol.. would definitely have a serious fan on that bitch. it would literally be a light/heater combo at that point."

flashlight,3cyado,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:23:19 2015 UTC,Can you define adjustable brightness? This word has different meaning to different people on here.  I'd still like foy you to answer that question but I went ahead and found a couple options. First is the HL30 (2015) which takes 2 AA batteries and has the a small red led on the front but I doubt it'll be useful anything past 10'. Second is the Fenix HP40H which uses a Red Cree XP-E2 which means it's going to be good and bright with 150 lumens. This runs off 4 AA giving you improved runtime but the battery pack is located on the back of the head. Of course both lights have the normal White Cree XP-G2 LED in them also providing good output and runtime.   I'm guessing you want a light that uses AA batteries because you use rechargeable batteries?
flashlight,3cyado,Natanael_L,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:32:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Adjustable brightness either with a slider or different 'modes' altogether. I mean like a low/med/high and red. Red doesn't HAVE to be too bright, but is ee that the HP40H also has low/med/high modes for red. This looks promising. Thank you so much for your recommendation! The HP40H may be the one.  As for AA batteries, I think its just because it is so easily accessible and cheap(er). Is there a reason why you ask?"
flashlight,3cyado,Zak,3,Sat Jul 11 22:39:43 2015 UTC,"Li-ion 18650 batteries have a so high energy density and lifetime compared to alkaline AA that it isn't even funny. One standard 3400 mAh 3.6 V 18650 battery lasts as long as 4-5 of the very best AA batteries on one charge, while weighing less and taking less space. Then you can charge it 500 more times. Not to mention that it performs better under load (moar light!). Would you rather store 2x 18650 batteries or 10 AA's for when your current set of batteries run out? Not to mention that you save money on it quickly.   You can get a good 18650 3400 mAh battery for $10-12. And it gets you the same energy during its full lifetime as over 2000 alkaline AA's. How cheap can you get those batteries?"
flashlight,3cyado,mcfarlie6996,2,Sat Jul 11 22:47:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for not being too hard on me, haha. I was ignorant. In that case, would you be able to recommend a site to get such battery, and more importanly have a headlamp suggestion for me?"
flashlight,3cyado,Zak,4,Sat Jul 11 23:02:57 2015 UTC,"We generally recommend the Panasonic NCR18650B around here, as it has the highest capacity and is of good quality. For maximum compatibility, you should get the button-top version, not the flat-top. Nitecore lights in particular often don't like flat-tops.  Some people will tell you to get a protection circuit. This is a PCB that acts as circuit breaker if the battery is shorted (but not under all possible conditions), overcharged or over-discharged. Lithium-ion batteries can vent hot gasses or catch fire under any of those conditions, but it's extremely unlikely any flashlight or headlamp will cause them. With or without a protection circuit, any good 18650 also has a pressure relief valve that will also interrupt a short circuit as well as a thermal fuse that shuts it down if it gets dangerously hot.  I would get them here. Every other 18650 sold there is also of good quality. Most 3400 mAh cells sold by flashlight manufacturers are actually these with a protection PCB and a different wrapper. They cost more, but it's the same cell inside. You can also buy them on Amazon, but not every 18650 cell sold on Amazon is of good quality. The ones from major Asian electronics makers you've heard of like Panasonic, LG, Sony and Sanyo are fine. Anything with ""fire"" in the name is lying about its capacity and may, in fact cause a fire."
flashlight,3cyado,PriceZombie,3,Sat Jul 11 23:28:20 2015 UTC,"Well Alkaline batteries are in no way cheaper. Sure there's a larger upfront cost with rechargeable batteries and a charger but they'll pay for themselves in time and much sooner depending on how heavily used the flashlight is. They're especially be worth it if you're like my roommate who buys the cheapest pack of Rayovac batteries and can't figure out why the batteries drain so quickly.   Additionally, 18650 rechargeable batteries have the same energy as 4 Alkaline batteries and they're actually not much bigger and especially take up less space than 4 AA batteries. This is why the Nitecore HC90 will get the highest vote in this thread because we all love our 18650 type lights but of course I'm still going to suggest AA types as requested.  Honestly I can't believe I'm linking to /u/zak's thread but he makes a great point about how 18650s are superior over Alkaline but either way you go I'd still recommend rechargeable AA batteries. Eneloop is easily the best of the best out there and most recommended but even the AmazonBasics rechargeable AAs are a good option."

I got really tired of typing ""no, really, if you're actually using your light, here's why you don't want the batteries you think you want"".   Additionally, 18650 rechargeable batteries have the same energy as 4 Alkaline batteries   An 18650 has about the same energy as four good NiMH AAs. If you put alkalines under the same load, you'll need quite a few more because their effective capacity drops dramatically as load increases.

I'm wanting a Zebralight H602w which should be pretty comparable in size and weight.   Which of the headlamps that you showed is your favorite? Or rather, which headlamp is your favorite in general?   More importantly, which beam profile did you prefer? Standard reflector, frosted lens, or bare emitter? Right now I'm leaning toward the H602w which is a bare emitter like the SG6 you reviewed, but was also considering the H600Fw with the frosted lens."
flashlight,3cxao2,fluffman86,2,Sat Jul 11 17:11:13 2015 UTC,"Weight is fine.  I prefer 18650 sized lights, and don't find them uncomfortable at all.  There's maybe a subset of people who only like the tiny plastic lamps you get at REI, because of the weight.  But the lamp doesn't feel heavy in the least.  I prefer the TIR optic of the Armytek, because I prefer a bit more throw than a bare emitter allows.  But that's just my opinion as I feel like those bare emitter folks often are more vocal about why those are best.  I feel like you need to use a higher mode on a bare emitter because the light where you need it strongest is always the direction you're facing.  I feel like a TIR optic and a frosted lens are very similar... at least a frosted lens over a reflector is...  But yeah my Armytek is my favorite.  Best tint and best optic for my taste.  But, it does have PWM on firefly one which I can see in general use from time to time.  The updated Armytek apparently has fixed that issue.  I'd like to review a Zebralight sometime, but I don't think it'd offer me anything better than the collection of headlamps I already have."
flashlight,3cxao2,nm1000,4,Sat Jul 11 19:12:28 2015 UTC,"First things first; thanks for all of the reviews. ""According to some statistics I just made up"" -- priceless.  The Zebralight offers a unique UI. I've both a Spark SF5 and an Armytek Tiara. There is much I like about both, but their UIs are a disappointment having first owned a Zebralight SC600.   I feel like a TIR optic and a frosted lens are very similar.   It's true that the Tiara (which has a TIR) is very similar to a frosted lens over a reflector. But that isn't because of the nature of a TIR; but because the Tiara has a honeycomb pattern on the surface of the TIR. Other Armytek lights (Partner and Prime) that use a TIR have a fairly conventional hotspot + spill beam pattern.  I'm one of those that finds something very appealing about the perfectly even beam of a bare emitter and prefer it over a honeycomb TIR/frosted lens where the added throw isn't needed. Perhaps it relieves my brain from trying to process some extra information about whether it's missing something if I don't sweep the beam. I don't have any confidence in that explanation. I just know I like a bare LED.   I prefer handheld (not angled) lights, so I don't have a lot of choices in either bare LED's or frosted/honeycomb lens lights. My favorite bare LED light is my Fenix PD32 with the reflector removed. I have a Armytek Prime which is a perfect fit for a Surefire F04 frosted lens, which is a great combination."

flashlight,3cty0c,firematt422,660,Fri Jul 10 19:20:53 2015 UTC,"I love lights because they represent something remarkable to me.   Since the dawn of man, we've been perpetually frustrated in our efforts to explore by many things– distance, predators, hostile environs unsuitable to travel– but worst of all in its regularity, duration, and unconquerability was Night.   It comes each day, without fail. It is all-encompassing and existentially terrifying in its unknowable depth. It quiets talk, slows movement, and steals time. And for years, centuries, millennia, eons, we have fought against it.   Fire was our first blow in this ancient battle. With fire, we beat back the shadows, and saw that it was good. We fashioned torches, then candles, then lanterns, and we were able to move in the darkness without fear of unseen attackers, absent the timeless danger of stubbed toes.   But it was not enough.   With the advent of electricity, illumination sprang forward as never before. The oldest of the lucky men who witnessed this transformation of society grumbled among themselves that such light wasn't natural; that we were fools to meddle with nature in this way, that artificial light would be an insidious presence in civilization, tempting us with convenience at the expense of our natural state.   But we did not listen.   Soon, towns and cities across the globe glowed at night brightly enough to be seen by ships across Great Lakes, brightly enough to be seen even from the ships newly buzzing across suddenly accessible skies. It was the Age of Light– and it is the age of light, and it always will be, from then forward.   But still we found ourselves frustrated.   Science and new technologies had given us cheap, warm light in our homes and on our streets– but for those who yearned for the exploration of days past, diving deep into the ocean or hiking into ageless woods, night still meant an end to a day's journey.   And so we persevered.   We created packages of electricity and called them batteries and we created lights small enough to carry. And we made them smaller and better each time until we came to today, a magical time for flashlights, when you can buy a light that will shine for a kilometer, or one that's 900 lumens but smaller than my big toe. They take batteries and use LEDs that represent billions of dollars of R&D, decades of engineering and refinement, and they're still working on it.  Many creation myths begin with a point of light. A beam erupts from the darkness, piercing it, driving it away utterly, and so the universe is born. I'm an atheist, but I get a small thrill when I light up a field or send a pillar of light into the sky. There's a reason we shot two beams of hope and resilience into the empty air where the twin towers stood.   Light is life.   TL;DR Flashlights represent the best of humanity, and I lose my keys a lot.   EDIT-   Well, this is enjoying rather more attention than I'd imagined.

They are testaments to workmanship that is still put into products. Looks like you're a machinist or involved someway with that field. All of these lights have machined components. The nice ones have crazy nice fit and finish for mass produced pieces. I actually got my start with machined copper lights and they are just awesome. It's more than a light maker to me. It's like a little work of art. That's just me talking build and aesthetics. Not even going to delve into the intricacy of the electrical and light systems.

flashlight,3cw8ms,mcfarlie6996,2,Sat Jul 11 14:46:41 2015 UTC,Anyone thinks Nitecore get good neutral white light?
flashlight,3cw8ms,utspg1980,3,Sat Jul 11 14:48:06 2015 UTC,Are you asking if Nitecore's current lights look like they're Neutral white?  If so then I would say no. They're slightly on the Cool White side but definitely not bothersome. The hotspots on the lights I reviewed have had a pure white tint while in the spill you can notice the Cool White tint. Also on the lower modes you can notice the Cool White tint in the hotspot.
flashlight,3cw8ms,mcfarlie6996,0,Sat Jul 11 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't this be more largely determined by what LED is used, as opposed to the brand?  i.e. a XM-L2 vs MTG2 will have more effect than Nitecore vs Thrunite.  Yeah the material used for the reflector and effect this as well, but I'd say the LED is #1."
flashlight,3cw8ms,utspg1980,2,Sat Jul 11 22:12:59 2015 UTC,I'm not entirely sure what you're asking. The majority of Nitecore lights use an XM-L2 although I'm unaware of the bin they use but a good guess would be the U2 bin. OP's original question is confusing and unclear but I mentioned my comment based off the 4 Nitecore lights I've had/reviewed in the past couple months which all used an XM-L2 and I would say none of them were Neutral white but slightly on the Cool White side.   I'm not sure where I brought up different brands though but maybe it's a misunderstanding. Yes MT-G2 emitters are completely different and are naturally more on the Neutral/Warm side although I have no personal experience with these types yet.
flashlight,3cw8ms,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:44:20 2015 UTC,"I guess my viewpoint is that OP's original question is mistaken when he searches out a brand for Neutral White.   It's further misguided when he asks if Nitecore is a good brand, and you reply that no, it's not a good brand for Neutral White. Note: I'm not familiar enough with any of the brands to know if one company favors XM-L2s and some other company favors MT-G2s.  I think it should be explained to him that he should look at the LED type, not the brand."
flashlight,3cw8ms,fluffman86,3,Sat Jul 11 22:53:45 2015 UTC,"I still think you're misguided a little so let me give you additional info. XM-L2 is a LED type but all Cree LEDS get classified into bin types which are mainly their performance groups. The U3 is the highest bin offering the highest output/efficiency but are not very common in flashlights vs the U2 bin. Further more, these bin(also called groups) come in a variety of tints as you can see on the left side of this chart and so XM-L2 can easily be found in a Neutral White tint along with a Warm White & up to 90-CRI but Nitecore just doesn't use these types. Part of it has to do with the bins. The U2 bin offers one of the highest output/efficiency but typically with the U2 bin it's more common to find the Cool White tints although it is possible to find a Neutral White tint if you know what to look for.   I guess I should also mention that OP works as a representative of Nitecore which I was hoping he'd mention that in the post that I suggest that he should do. They're trying to gather information on why people like a Neutral White tint so much and if they should incorporate it into their lights. I know this because him and I have been talking because he'd like for me to do further Nitecore reviews for them."

They're trying to gather information on why people like a Neutral White tint so much and if they should incorporate it into their lights.    Ohhhhh. This puts the OPs question in a whole new light (har har).  It's their competitor, but I have an Thrunite TN11S V2 in neutral white, and it does give a nice, pleasing color to me. It is quite obvious when used in conjunction with my headlamp, which is a very cool white. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend that light if someone asked me for a neutral white light.  To me, it is most noticeable when outdoors. When I'm inside, I don't care much about cool vs neutral. But when outside, neutral white really makes greens and browns light up much more naturally.  If OP is wondering if it's ""worth it"" to incorporate neutral white, I would say their biggest buyers would be outdoor users. So maybe they should consider a line marketed to ""the outdoorsman"" or hunters, campers, etc. That kind of audience.  I don't see people of the tactical/police/military necessarily really going gung-ho for neutral white."

Everybody's buying power banks, and I see the ability to carry however many relatively cheap spare batteries for it as you want as a huge plus. Add to that the fact that most people have never seen an XM-L2/Li-ion flashlight, so they're likely to be very impressed with the output. The only manufacturer of possibly-good products in this category I know of is Powertac."

It runs on a single removable 18650. I think a product like that would be huge with the mainstream consumer market if they were exposed to it. Just hearing or reading that it exists is not enough.

I have the 3 and the 6, and a buddy has the 7. The smart ring is the best UI I've found. Being able to adjust to whatever level you need, before you turn it on, is just such a convenience.

He got it at the recommendation of a coworker who had the same model, and has been happy with it for the past few months.  He works at a factory and uses it to detect oil leaks in the machines. Some of the machines at his job are giant presses bigger than a house, so the beam must be good enough to find an oil leak from 30-40 feet away.  I tried it on money and my drivers license and it worked like a charm.  But being $20, and including a battery and charger too quality can be a concern...but so far t's survived 4 months in a rough working environment so there's that.

flashlight,3cscse,mcfarlie6996,2,Tue Jul 14 16:26:17 2015 UTC,"Cool. I always thought the dome was a nessecary part if the LED, like the glass in a traditional lightbulb. Thats neat. How does a smaller emitter give you more throw than a larger emmitter of the same brightness? Would you have to give it a higher current?"
flashlight,3cscse,sLaughterIsMedicine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:36:06 2015 UTC,"Well the reflector is circular and is designed to reflect from the center most part of the circular part but the further out the light is from the center of the reflector is then that light isn't being focused as precisely as possible because it's hitting the reflector at different angles. The XP-G2 is smaller and by pushing it to higher outputs, you can get more lumens per mm2 from a more centered area. Make sense?   It seems miniscule considering how small both emitters are but it actually make a big difference. This XinTD C8 has a 1.75"" head diameter and uses an XP-G2 emitter and throws 500m(according to my test) while the XM-L2 version probably only throws 375m(educated guess). Now if you were to dedome the XP-G2, it'll probably bump it close to 600m or more of throw. Unfortunately I don't know exactly numbers since I've only had my hands on the domed XP-G2 version but there's no other light out on the market that beats this XinTD C8 XP-G2 in that size."

flashlight,3cscse,Ramrawd,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:47:01 2015 UTC,"Throw. LEDs have a tiny little lens on them protecting them from contaminants and focusing the light a tiny bit before it even leaves the flashlight. By removing this, you let a little extra light through and lower the point from which light is emitted, allowing a tighter focus with the same size reflector."

flashlight,3cscse,Magneticitist,2,Fri Jul 10 18:30:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the original tint of the light plays a large role in it too because there's a tint shift after dedoming."

flashlight,3cscse,GnashRoxtar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:41:37 2015 UTC,Gasoline is a solvent that dissolves whatever is used to adhere the dome to the substrate. What I don't like about using the gas method is that it tends to cause a nasty tint shift.

flashlight,3cscse,emarkd,2,Sat Jul 11 02:46:04 2015 UTC,"you let a little extra light through    This may be technically true, but dedoming usually results in a reduction in total light output.

flashlight,3cq0eh,lxivbit,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:50:39 2015 UTC,"Infinitely variable ring is perilous because you never know what mode you will be in when you turn the light on. So maybe adding some smarts to it would help.  When you turn it on it goes to the last setting. Turning right flips through your normal modes: low, med, high, turbo, starting with low. Turning right flips through your strobe modes: beacon, sos, slow strobe and fast strobe. I think it would be cool to be able to reverse the order of the modes. Having fast strobe first would make it way more tactical.  Please make this light. Would be awesome."
flashlight,3cq0eh,Zak,2,Fri Jul 10 00:53:54 2015 UTC,Infinite is fine as long as the range of motion isn't huge and there are detents at the ends. The Nitecore SRT series does it right and the Sunwayman V25C does it wrong. It's not hard to estimate the brightness before turning on.
flashlight,3cq0eh,lxivbit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:51:02 2015 UTC,"The way I was thinking was no detents. Mode selection depends on the direction you are turning. You turn right, you get first intensity mode. You turn left you get the first strobe mode. You continue to turn to change intensity or strobe mode. You can never go backwards. You want to go back you have to just keep looping around.  We had a guy in here that wanted no strobe on his light, this fixes that problem. I think a switch on the ring mechanism that kept you from changing directions easily might be good. So when you try to change directions you get resistance but keep putting pressure on it and it flips you to the other mode.  I don't know if this is a good idea or not. Just throwing it out there for debate."

flashlight,3coic2,tinniertdog,6,Thu Jul 9 14:36:56 2015 UTC,"My favorite belt light with a tailswitch is the Nitecore P12.  You can get it in this kit or that kit.  You might save a couple dollars buying piecemeal, though, since the P12 has dropped in price a bit and the kits haven't.  Battery option 1  Then you could pick up a Nitecore i2 or i4 or d2 or d4 from illumn.com and that'd help you save on shipping. That battery and those chargers are cheaper than the amazon options below, but shipping costs vary the price a bit.   Battery option 2  These Olight batteries have the same basic Panasonic NCR18650B as the Keeppower or the Nitecore 3400mah batteries above, but each have been wrapped by their respective company with a protection circuit.  If you want integrated charging on the light itself, then you'd want to check out the Nitecore MH12. It's the same light as the P12 with the same modes, just has the built-in micro USB charger. I can see how that'd come in handy, but I'd just as soon save the money and swap in a fresh battery and charge the dead one externally.   In your search, you'll probably see the Fenix PD35 and the Thrunite TN12 recommended as well. Both of those lights are very similar to the P12 - they all use a tactical tailswitch with a separate forward mode button to change modes. All are fine, well-built lights, but they each have their own set of features and mode settings.    Nitecore P12 - 2015 Thrunite TN12 Fenix PD35    1000 1050 960   N/A 800 460   240 280 180   70 20 50   1 0.3 14   Strobe Strobe Strobe   Remembers Strobe N/A N/A   SOS N/A N/A   Beacon N/A N/A   Tailstand Tailstand N/A   LED Battery Check N/A N/A   Cool(ish) White Only Optional Neutral White Cool White Only    Strobe is hidden on all three, just hold the mode button to access if you need it. Only the P12 will stay in strobe mode after turning the light off and on. The others you would need to re-enter strobe mode. I think that's a nice tactical feature, and I like having the extra emergency modes as well.  I find the main Lumen levels on the TN12 to be really wonky. The 800 Lumen mode isn't much different than the 1050 mode, and it has the same runtime. Also, the jump from 20 to 280 Lumens is MASSIVE. The one redeeming feature of the TN12 is that it's available in a Neutral White tint. When the TN12 was $45 and the P12 was nearly $60, it was a great deal. Now that the TN12 fluctuates from $45 to $50 and the P12 has dropped to <$45, I just can't recommend the TN12.  The Fenix PD35 is really nice, and the most expensive of the three. The UC35 is the USB rechargeable version of the PD35, like the MH12 is to the P12. The modes are well spaced, without a huge jump between each set. Note that our eyes view light output logarithmically, so it takes about 4x the number of Lumens to appear twice as bright. The two things the PD35 really lacks is that it doesn't have a 1 Lumen or below moonlight mode (which is really useful when it's pitch black as it helps preserve your night vision) and it can't tailstand upright like a candle because the button is too long.   With the P12, you have a pretty big jump from the moonlight 1 Lumen mode up to 70, but I find 70 to be pretty comfortable for most work. 70 to 240 is right at double the brightness, and the jump from 240 to 1000 is right at double the brightness, so I find that to work really well, and while I would like a 15-20 Lumen mode, I've never wanted anything between 240 (which is really really bright) and 1000 (which is STUPID bright).  Oh, and one of the most overlooked features on the P12/MH12 is the battery voltage check. Hold Mode while you click on the tail switch, and it'll read out the current voltage by blinking the little blue LED under the mode button. So 4 blinks, pause, 2 blinks means you have a fully charged 18650 at 4.2 volts.  I also want to throw out that while I love my P12 as a holster light, I've mostly stopped carrying it daily since I got my Zebralight SC62w. I prefer the smaller size, which is easier to hold in my mouth, but I still get nearly the same light output, and I get it in a warmer tint that's just gorgeous. You also get near-instant access to your customizable modes, and much lower low modes are available. See /r/sc62masterrace for lots of extra info."

If you don't mind, I was just wondering if you could share all the reasons you are carrying a Zebralight over the p12. Thanks again!"
flashlight,3coic2,fluffman86,3,Fri Jul 10 11:58:21 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah man.  First, let me say again the P12 is a fine light, and my favorite with a tailswitch + mode button. I like it as a tactical light, and I miss the momentary on feature of being able to hold the button half way and release when done. The SC62w can't do that. The P12 also has mode memory, which is great for the momentary feature. So I can set it to Moonlight or Low or whatever, then just half press to bring it on momentarily.   The problem with mode memory is that it ALWAYS remembers. So if you set it for 1000 Lumens outside, then turn it off and go to bed, well when you wake up to check on the wife and kids or take a leak or just poke around in the dark, it will turn on with the face melting 1000 lumens. For the most part, I just left mine in the 70 Lumen mode, but if I wanted to drop to 1 Lumen, then I'd have to cover the lens, turn on the light, click the mode button 3 times to drop to moonlight, then I'd be good to go. That's not ideal, but it can work.  The SC62w, on the other hand, uses a unique interface that allows you to access any mode group from off. It's a little complicated written out, but simple in practice. As a basic 3-mode light, 1 click from off is High, a double-click from off is Medium, a long-press from off is Low, a triple-click from off is Strobe/Beacon, and a quadruple click from off will blink the light 4 times for a full battery, all the way down to 1 for an almost dead battery. I'd suggest recharging at 2 blinks. 1 click while the light is on will always turn the light off.  So that's simple, but only 3 modes. If you want more, then use one of the button press series above to access the mode group you want, then double click to change modes to one other pre-defined mode within that group. So personally, for me, I have mine set so that a single click is 140 Lumens (personal H2), then a double click while on is 1000 Lumens (the default H1). Three clicks is fast strobe, and a double click will cycle through low beacon, high beacon, slow strobe, and fast strobe.   Like I said, a little confusing to read, so it's best to watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWJFQegalhU  The initial reason I bought an SC62w was for a trip to Disney. I wanted something small enough to slip into my pocket and carry it in Florida heat all day. It came in handy more than once, too, with late nights at the park and I was able to grab it and find stuff that the kids had dropped or poke around in a diaper bag or whatever. The SC62w is only 3.8 inches and stayed securely clipped to my pocket even on roller coasters. The P12 on the other hand is 5.5 inches and I didn't want to have to bother with security inspecting my big tactical light in a holster. They saw the clip to my SC62w once, but I just showed them the little tiny light and everything went smoothly.   Once I did that I realized I really liked having it clipped in my cargo pocket on my shorts as it was much more out of the way than having the P12 next to my Leatherman Rebar on my belt. I also found myself preferring the Neutral tint to the Cool White tint of the P12. It's better at color reproduction and much easier when I'm punching down wires (not often, I generally do user support, but sometimes punch down ethernet cables). I miss that my P12 was easier to clip to my hat, but the SC62w is easier to hold in my mouth. The P12 can throw a bit farther (nominally 232 Meters) on high outside, but the SC62w is no slouch (at 150 or so meters as calculated by the community). Here's /u/emarkd's picture of it lighting up a beach from an 8th floor balcony. So the SC62w can't throw as far, but I like that it has a much broader beam with more spill, which make it better for working up close and even walking around in the woods, IMO.   Oh, and when I first got the P12, I just KNEW I wanted a tail switch. It makes sense, right? You can't lose a tail switch because it's always on the end of the light. Which is fine for just turning the light off and on, but makes it a bit more difficult to change modes. And while an overhand grip is great tactically, it's not as comfy just walking around at night with the side switch. Even so, the Mode button on the P12 is kind of hard to find, especially when wearing gloves, but at least I can get the light turned on. Since it was so hard to find, I thought I would never want a side button. Lights like Olight or ArmyTek use kind of small, slightly raised buttons and I don't know how much I'd like that. Zebralight, on the other hand, deeply recesses the button so it's easy to find, plus since the clip is screwed to the side of the light, you'll always know the button is on the opposite side. I love that because it's just like drawing my Spyderco or Byrd knives when they're tip-up. When you draw the SC62w your thumb naturally falls to the recessed side button. It's always just right there.   So that's a long write up. Let me know if you have any questions!   Edit: thanks for the gold, anonymous stranger!"

No word yet on whether removing the sticker will help.   If those turn out to be a dud, the next I'd suggest is Olight 3400 mah 18650s from amazon - 2 for $25 or so. Note that almost all name brand 3400 mah 18650 batteries are rewrapped Panasonic NCR18650Bs with an added protection circuit.   If you're ordering from Zebralight direct then they sell a flat top 18650 that'll be guaranteed to fit. You'd think any of them would work but some are slightly different and the SC62w if so tiny that it'll make a difference.   For the charger I'd suggest a Nitecore i2, i4, d2, or d4 from illumn.com or Amazon. /u/Zak can also suggest an interesting USB charger that'll charge one battery and also serve as a power bank. I'm mobile now or I'd find it for you. Or you can search his post history.   Now here's where the SC62w has failed me: I haven't found a decent holster for it yet. D-: Try looking at skinth and see if they can help, especially if you want one holster for your multi tool and light combined. They tend to cater more to 2xAA lights, though. Another user mentioned getting one for his SC62W but hadn't reported back yet.   You might find a small pouch for a generic small multitool or for a 1xCR123a light. I just pocket mine, though.

Now im thinking of it, Does the miller charger has an LED that says if charging is done/finished? And, I think i have a 1800MaH Li-Ion cell laying around, probarly 18650, but im not home now, so i cant check.  Maybe i'll first get the S2+Charger, and then buy new batterys and C8 later  EDIT 2:  Nvm about the led question :P i found it out already"

flashlight,3cln3h,mcfarlie6996,3,Fri Jul 10 01:26:52 2015 UTC,Yeah. They are not very forgiving to people who are not as educated in the matter. I really feel bad for the people who want honest information. I'd prefer to frequent the subs that want to educate people and welcome them.
flashlight,3cln3h,fluffman86,2,Fri Jul 10 01:39:05 2015 UTC,Honestly I'd want people to ask questions then to try to figure it out on their own because a lot of it you just can't find on your own because you don't know any better. I wish I learned about this sub way before I learned from starting off with all of my crappy lights. Half the problem is these cheap companies claiming their lights do 2000 lumens when they'll actually do 700 if you're lucky. And don't even get me started on the batteries.

flashlight,3clj2b,TFS_Jake,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:25:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  USB-chargeable lights are very slow to charge. You might be better off, just carrying a spare or two with you; then you have the convenience of a lighter light in your pack, but with plenty of run time, and you can charge the batteries, at your leisure back at home.  I would highly recommend an XTAR VP-2, or VC4 - both excellent chargers, with slightly different feature sets.  It depends on what your needs are. http://www.edcforums.com/threads/xtar-vp2-and-vc4-nitecore-i4-v2-and-d4-chargers.121077/  USB charging of a light, is only as good as its source, and the cable you're using to charge it.  What USB source would you use to charge your light?"
flashlight,3clj2b,david57strat,2,Wed Jul 8 23:13:38 2015 UTC,I have a 27 watt solar panel that has 2 amp USB outputs.

These are great suggestions guys i really appreciate it.

flashlight,3clj2b,Zak,2,Thu Jul 9 12:42:19 2015 UTC,"Dude, i think you just changed my life!!   But it charges uprotected 18650s, someone explain? Can/should i put unprotected 18650s in my flashlights? Or can/should i use protected 18650?"
flashlight,3clj2b,fluffman86,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:36:05 2015 UTC,"There are three kinds of protection in 18650 cells:   PCB circuit breaker, which is what's meant by ""protected"" and ""unprotected"". This protects against overcharge, over-discharge and shorting. Good chargers also protect against overcharge. Almost all flashlights designed for 18650s protect against over-discharge. Plastic boxes and common sense protect against shorting. Pressure-relief/current-interrupt device, which breaks the contact to the positive terminal and lets gas out in the event gas starts building up in the cell, which can happen in the event of overcharge, shorting, reverse-charging and similar abuse. Thermal fuse, which interrupts current if the cell gets hot, reducing the chance it will overheat enough to get in to a chain reaction that makes it catch fire or explode.   I'm not a big fan of protection PCBs. They add resistance, sometimes cause fitment issues and give a false sense of security by protecting only against scenarios I think are minimally likely. I recommend unprotected button-top Panasonic NCR18650Bs for the best performance and compatibility.  Protection circuits may, kindasorta help prevent one of the possible failure modes with a light that uses multiple 18650s in series. If one cell is charged much more than another in a series configuration, the low cell will be reverse-charged. This is bad, and may cause it to overheat, vent or even explode. Over-discharge protection might interrupt the low cell if its voltage is low enough and prevent this from happening. I don't recommend you rely on this; if you're using a series light like the MH40, make sure both cells have the same state of charge.  If you want to use protected 18650s in the ML-102, you can trim the plastic behind the negative spring and bend the spring a bit until it fits. Unprotected cells may be a loose fit after that."

flashlight,3clj2b,david57strat,2,Wed Jul 8 21:34:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think there are any 2x18650 lights with USB charging. There are a couple 26650 lights with onboard charging, which will get you longer life, though not as much longer as the increased volume should. One is the Powertac Hero. The other uses a proprietary modified 26650 and I will not sully this post with its name. There are multi-18650 lights with non-USB onboard charging like the Nitecore MH40.  I think you'll have to make a compromise here. Also be aware that you said ""throw"" and people jumped straight to the M3XS-UT Javelot. Am I correct in assuming that what you want is a throwy general-purpose light like the MH25 that's still useful up close for something other than starting fires and scorching retinas?"

flashlight,3clj2b,Zak,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:51:30 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of 2-18650 lights that have serious firepower, available; but I can't think of a single one that is in-light USB-chargeable, for 2 18650 batteries.    I have a Nitecore P25, which is USB-rechargeable, and an excellent thrower, for its size. It's very similar, in output, to the the MH25 you mentioned, with its larger head, and has a great user interface.  The P25 also has the additional side switch (for mode changing.  That lighted side button also functions as a battery meter, when you install batteries. It's been a really solid light, for me. If you're going to be pack-carrying this light, it shouldn't be an issue.  How much throw do you need out of the light you're seeking?  The P25 is rated to 320 meters (10 meters further than the MH25).   The Blue light around the side switch also acts as a low battery warning lamp.  Overall, a really nice, well-built light.  http://flashlight.nitecore.com/product/p25  If you're doing close-up work, but wanting to use this light, you can always use a standard 40mm diffuser, and your bases will be covered.  I use the stock diffuser that came with an Olight S35, and that works fine on the P25, Fenix E50, and Nitecore EA4 :-)"

flashlight,3cjrfp,mightybonk,3,Wed Jul 8 16:43:05 2015 UTC,"I'm really surprised to hear of Nyogel not working well with o-rings in a flashlight.  I have 70 lights, and use Nyogel 760G in all of them.    I don't own any lights that are titanium, or brass, but I do have some stainless ones.  Personally, I don't think it makes a difference, what metals you're using, as far as waterproofing a light.  The lube needs to interact well with the o-rings, to insure proper waterproofing of the light, regardless of the metal.  One of the most important things to remember, when lubricating your flashlight threads, is that you're not just trying to make the threads work smoothly, but to also keep the flashlight, as waterproof as possible.  Definitely, use  a non-petroleum-based lubricant on flashlight threads.  The wrong viscosity of lubricant will make the that lubricant ineffective, as far as keeping the light fully waterproofed; and you won't really notice the difference (if you use the wrong lubricant), until it's too late (the light gets dunked in water, or some other fluid, and water starts leaking into the light; then, game over :-(  Which formulation of Nyogel are you using on your flashlight threads, and what is the problem you're encountering with the Nyogel, on those threads?"
flashlight,3cjrfp,escape_your_destiny,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:56:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input.   I've got 2 lights having problems with the Nyogel 760G, and they both have EPDM o-rings - which makes a black sludge on the threads. I switched 1 for fluorosilicone o-rings (still waiting on a response from the maker of the other light about the size of the o-ring on the other) and it resolved the issue. I was just wondering if it was better to keep the EPDM o-rings and change lubericants, or change the o-rings and keep the Nyogel.  I guess I am looking for the best combination for sealing as well as thread protection."
flashlight,3cjrfp,bazilbt,2,Wed Jul 8 22:16:47 2015 UTC,"Did your two lights come, stock, with those EPDM o-rings?  It sounds as if the o-rings are the problem; not the lubricant.   O-rings that were designed to work well in plumbing applications, where they're rarely changed out, may not be a problem; but when you're routinely cleaning/lubricating threads/changing batteries on a flashlight, it's very different. The last thing you need it a bunch of build-up let on the metal parts, once you take the pieces apart - especially if any of your lights change modes, (twisty switches, for instance, where you need the best contact between the two metal pieces, for the light to function properly).  I'm sure you already know this.  If it's only the two lights, it may be worth researching where to get replacement o-rings.  Just out of curiosity, which lights are they?  I could do some more research, if I knew what lights we were discussing.  Just my two cents' worth.  I hope this helps."

flashlight,3cj532,Zak,2,Wed Jul 8 12:49:31 2015 UTC,Does it actually output 996 lumens? Why is it so cheap?
flashlight,3cj532,BananaHamSalad,2,Thu Jul 9 01:13:11 2015 UTC,"It's probably 996 at the emitter and more like 850 out the front. Human perception of brightness is logarithmic, so you'd likely have a hard time telling the difference between the 850lm and 1000. I could barely tell when I had a driver with 100% and 60% modes. The components and drive currents they're using are absolutely capable of producing around 1000lm at the emitter though.  Several factors go in to the S2 being cheaper than premium-brand Chinese lights like Nitecore and Fenix:   Warranty - the Convoy doesn't have one that I know of. Body material - I think it's a softer alloy than some so it's easier to machine. Convoys are surprisingly thick metal though. Machining - the shape of the body is pretty simple, making it easier to manufacture. Switch and UI - premium lights usually have forward-clicky switches, multiple switches and fancy UI features. The Convoys just have a reverse-clicky switch and power-cycle to change modes. Forward-clicky switches that can handle enough current cost dollars while reverse-clicky switches cost cents. Optics - I've seen better beam shapes than the S2, and the lens doesn't have a fancy anti-reflective coating like most more expensive lights.   That said, I have some Convoy hosts I'm using for a homebuilt project and I'm really surprised they can put out this level of quality for the prices they charge. I really wish they'd add a dual-switch version of the S-series. They have a larger dual-switch light called the L4."

Might even fit on a key ring. Uses AAA batteries which are easy to come by, and you might already have on hand from other things.  There are definitely better lights out there, but if you are just getting into flashlights, comfort is a huge factor as to whether you will actually carry it with you, so comfort is one of the deciding factors in whether you'll have the light with you when it gets dark. Once you've carried a light for awhile you'll have run into all sorts of uses for it, and so you'll tolerate a little more discomfort and will be okay to go with a little larger light, since you'll better appreciate the trade off. Then you can go get a bigger light that uses fancy batteries, and get a fancy charger, and all the other stuff. But if you do that now, you might find carrying the bigger light is uncomfortable and just leave it in a drawer.  EDIT: Another little 1xAAA light would be the Thrunite Ti3, which is at the $20 mark. Tops out at 120 lumens, but as long as you are indoors, that's probably enough. For outdoorsy stuff, where you might need to see across a field, or light up the other end of a warehouse, it's not going to be enough. But lights that are enough for that are going to be large enough that you'll probably notice them in your pocket and end up taking them out and leaving them in a drawer."

flashlight,3chqjp,Zak,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:10:43 2015 UTC,"Here's what would make me go buy one right now: offer a charging base small enough to attach to the light with a twist-lock of some sort so it won't get lost, effectively transforming it in to a MicroUSB charging light like the MH and UC series on demand."
flashlight,3chqjp,emarkd,4,Wed Jul 8 12:31:43 2015 UTC,"One of the issues with USB charging is that it adds bulk and weight to the light, which is not really a good thing when you're looking for a small pocketable light.  Don't get me wrong, there are pocketable lights with chargers built-in, but most good ones don't have that.  So for me, the light you want is the zebralight sc62w.  I carry one every day clipped in my back pocket.  Its very small but puts out enough light to light up the beach from an 8th floor balcony.  And its got great levels - turbo lasts about 1.5 hours, down to the lowest of lows that lasts 5.5 months.  It runs on 18650 li-ion batteries, so if you don't already have that you should budget in about $12 for a good cell and another $10 for a good charger.  I could go on and on, and usually do - /r/sc62masterrace  Any questions, just ask!"

You can clip them to your shirt (you'll have to find your own clip for the H600). They're very small, and the user interface is excellent."
flashlight,3chqjp,nm1000,3,Wed Jul 8 01:35:06 2015 UTC,"IMO, you want a diffuse beam for up close work. Perhaps it's just me, but I find a hot spot problematic when working up close. I'd much prefer a pure flood in that case. But a pure flood isn't practical in many other situations.   The ""F"" (frosted lens) versions of the Zebralight headlamps and flashlights are a good compromise between a conventional beam and a pure flood. There is a owner of a brand new H52Fw on this list that might chime in soon.  Armytek makes some excellent headlamps with similar diffuse beam profiles. Armytek also makes the Prime, which is a handheld model with a very nice general purpose beam profile -- that happens to be a perfect fit for a Surefire F04 frosted lens. The Prime plus the F04 is a great combination. The F04 slips over the front of the Prime and gives you a nice smooth beam."
flashlight,3chqjp,mcfarlie6996,5,Wed Jul 8 00:56:48 2015 UTC,"There is a owner of a brand new H52Fw on this list that might chime in soon.   Omg omg that's me! Actually someone else got one a couple days before me too.   So I know there's this whole hype about 18650 batteries and how they're superior but they're absolutely correct. So let me explain why I chose the H52Fw. I got this for its size and because I'll strictly be using it for hands on work. Because of this close proximity I can keep it on a lower output and have fairly good runtime. Plus I got plenty of Eneloops batteries when needed. I also got it to use with my 14500 batteries getting even higher output(~500Lm) but at the cost of runtime.   This light is pure flood and even with the 18650 version I doubt it'll reach 150 feet but the flood is very very nice casting an even beam of light in front of you which is what I wanted after trying to use a reflector type headlamp working on my car. And don't even get my started on the UI.   Ok, fine... I used to read about the UI before owning and was like ""this thing looks annoyingly complicated"" but holy crap was I wrong and regret not owning one/any of these lights sooner...  Trust me, I've had my hand on about 20 different flashlights and there's no UI like this offering 6 different outputs off the back asking with 4 additional outputs to program into the main sequence. And I memorized the whole process in 15 mins and it's so effin' easy, awesome, and convenient to have all of these extra modes!  Now the 18650 version is what you're going to be looking for with its higher output and much much longer runtime but now it'll be up to you to decide if you want a Floody version or a normal version. There's a slight size difference with the 18650 version but you'll still be blown away with how small it is compared to the battery.   TL;DR: GET A ZEBRALIGHT, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"

flashlight,3chqjp,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:45:40 2015 UTC,Actually I'm totally content with their line and see no need to expand into lights that throw like the Viking. Can you imagine having 6 modes on a Viking? Like my Predator I can't see myself using any other mode but Turbo. It's a light designed for throw and so that's what I'll be using it as. Still nice to have the other modes just in case though. The Viking is a little more floody-er although it's still designed for throw but still wouldn't be the most useful up close. This is just my thought on it all though.

I think my SC600 has a great general purpose beam pattern. But, for my purposes, the PT10 might be a bit more useful[1]. I do use the low modes of the PT10 much of the time. I would very much like that same flashlight with a ZL UI -- and more modes would be nice too (but not without the ZL UI).  [1] why that is true is harder to explain in words than it would be to demonstrate -- sound familiar? So, I won't waste a lot of space, but be assured I've given a lot of thought ;)  FWIW, I haven't seen Rayus mentioned very much. I think my PT10 is a quality flashlight -- I like the 5000K tint.

You can enter the strobe function from moonlight mode, but you can't exit it from there. Pressing the mode button in this state simply causes the light to go dark. Subsequent presses of the mode button seem to have no effect.   This is interesting. You think this could possibly be used as a lockout feature when storing the light in a bag or something? Maybe not the most practical method but considering you can't lock it out at the tail-cap, this seems like a viable option."
flashlight,3cf0ll,lanmansa,2,Tue Jul 7 12:45:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I enjoyed doing it.   Yeah, maybe you could use that as a lockout. I tried to measure the amperage draw with the light in this state to see if there's anything electrical going on and didn't see anything, but then my meter is only good down to milliamps, not microamps. Regardless, if it's pulling power in this state it isn't much."
flashlight,3cf0ll,AbraKedavra,3,Tue Jul 7 14:14:19 2015 UTC,"Great review, one of the most detailed I've seen so far. This sub is making me learn so much about lights that I never knew about until a couple months ago. I feel so...enlightened (pun intended). That sounds like very good output at decent voltage. 1,200 lumens at 2.33A? Sounds good to me. This thing is a bit on the large side for my tastes. Seems that it would be pretty decent for search and rescue."
flashlight,3cf0ll,wesinator,2,Tue Jul 7 18:43:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  One point though, I think this light has a buck driver in it and the emitter is probably getting more than those 2ish amps.  It can do that since it requires at least two cells, meaning input voltages are at least 4ish volts so there's room there to regulate that down, increasing the drive amps.  I really need to remove the driver from the light and check it directly.  But regardless of what's going on at the business end, there's really a nice easy load on the batteries."

flashlight,3cf0ll,wesinator,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:19:26 2015 UTC,I'm so torn between this light and the VN modded version of the m2x. I'm sure the m3xs will have much more battery life but the smaller size and more throw of the m2xvn is almost worth it.
flashlight,3cf0ll,mcfarlie6996,2,Tue Jul 7 17:12:17 2015 UTC,Actually the M2XVN only has about 10% more throw than the M3SX based off the the numbers a CPF member is getting. Now if you get the XP-G2 modded version then you'll see a 20% increase in throw but a smaller tighter beam/hotspot.
flashlight,3cf0ll,wesinator,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:44:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, thanks. That's good to know. I thought I saw that it was supposed to get 1600 lumens, so I thought that would translate to much more throw. Now I'm leaning more towards the M3XS. I just wish it came with a 1 18650 tube."
flashlight,3cf0ll,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:53:54 2015 UTC,"While increasing the brightness improves throw, it's not a large factor in increasing throw since the reflector plays a larger role and then since both lights are already dedomed there's no improvement there vs stock throwers that aren't dedomed."
flashlight,3cf0ll,wesinator,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:05:39 2015 UTC,"Like McFarlie said, lumens = output, not necessarily throw. If all (or most) of the extra light goes into the spill then you're gaining little or no distance, just better illumination in your immediate vicinity."
flashlight,3cf0ll,wesinator,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:39:18 2015 UTC,But these two lights have very similar if not the same reflectors where most of the light is tight like a laser beam. So I would assume that the increase in lumens would still noticeably increase the throw.
flashlight,3cf0ll,wesinator,2,Tue Jul 7 18:42:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, and it does.  The stock M2x is about 800 meters of throw.  According to McFarlie, the modded version reached about 1100.  That's a ~35% increase in throw, which is pretty damn good.  But its still only about ~10% better than this light, the M3XS.  I'm sure either one is awesome so I'm not trying to talk you into one or the other."
flashlight,3cf0ll,wesinator,2,Tue Jul 7 18:51:43 2015 UTC,"Additionally, the modded M2X is ~1400 lumens while the stock is ~1000 lumens and the M3SX is 1200 lumens."

flashlight,3ceq31,AbraKedavra,3,Tue Jul 7 17:25:31 2015 UTC,"You probably want a flashlight than runs on 18650s even if you think you want something else.  If you're willing to wait, you can get some decent quality, but cheap stuff from FastTech. They ship from Hong Kong mostly and shipping to most places in the world, including, I think everywhere that uses Euros is free. Be advised that some of the stuff there is absolutely not decent quality, so you might want to browse around, find something you think you like and ask if anyone here has experience with it.  This Convoy S2 is a good general-purpose flashlight. It is extremely well-built for the price, much brighter than the Maglite and should have better color reproduction with its neutral tint. The Convoy C8 is a similar light with a larger head and tighter beam. It's better for distance, but maybe overly tight up close. The Convoy L4 is the C8 with a separate mode switch, which I consider a big plus. The tint on this one is cool-white, which is more blue than the others and probably similar to the Maglite.   You'll need batteries. I recommend the Panasonic NCR18650B for its high capacity and excellent reputation for quality. Button-top will fit more lights than flat-top. I generally recommend these without protection circuits, but do make sure you keep them in a plastic box or inside the flashlight, charge them in a quality charger after use and don't short-circuit them.  You'll need a charger. The ML-102 is awesome because it's also a very good USB power supply for recharging a phone. For a multi-slot charger, the Nitecore i2 and i4 are excellent choices for the price."
flashlight,3ceq31,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:16:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! Color tint is not a real problem for me, and also, Do you really reccommend/need rechargable battery's? I have some laying around, but i will not use it that much, so i think akalines are fine?"
flashlight,3ceq31,GnashRoxtar,3,Tue Jul 7 17:26:29 2015 UTC,"Under very few situations do you actually want Alakalines. 18650s are a MUCH better alternative. I would agree with /u/Zak, go with the convoy. Everything put together, you'd come in under your budget even with the charger and battery.  Additionally, if you were worried about tint, simon, the manufacturer of Convoy Flashlights, would be happy to change out the default LED to a warmer one, if you buy through him at his storefront."
flashlight,3ceq31,GnashRoxtar,2,Tue Jul 7 17:30:56 2015 UTC,"The tint is not a problem, also, I would like to focus on a light itself first, and then spend some money on the battery´s. Yeah maybe im stupid, or weird. But in my opinion, there is something with the design of a maglite that makes it more attractive then the cheaper ones (and probarly better) they linked, I dont know. Is there actually something worng with maglites, i see that a lot of people on this sub dont reccommend them!  We have some rechargable Philips D cells laying around, with a charger. and also we have a lot of rechargable AA and AAA cells.  EDIT:  I just study'd the 18650 battery's and they seem promosing, I'll probarly invest in them if i have my light :)"

flashlight,3ceq31,Zak,2,Tue Jul 7 17:49:23 2015 UTC,"They have a great rep in terms of durability- I don't think I've ever heard of anyone breaking their MagLite except through taking its baton function too seriously- but about half of their line uses incandescent bulbs, which suck, and the others are mostly one-mode, twist-to-focus lights which are MUCH larger and heavier than the amount of light they produce justifies.   As far as I can tell, their current flagship, while miles ahead of where they've been for the past ten years or so, still falls short in terms of light, throw, weight, size, modes... there's really just not much to justify them, especially not at their prices. I'm sure you could find one on amazon for less, but everyone here will agree that they simply haven't kept up with the fast pace of lighting technology, and you'd be better served with something smaller, brighter, and cheaper."
flashlight,3ceq31,Zak,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:47:38 2015 UTC,"The heavy light function is actually quite good imo, it feels like you have a real flashlight in your hand, not like a piece of plastic ;) The light im planning on buying now needs to last for a while, i dont want to keep buying new flashlights, even tho they maybe cheap."
flashlight,3ceq31,Zak,3,Tue Jul 7 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"Oh you don't have to worry about that at all. Nitecore, Olight, Armytek, Fenix, Zebralight, and practically any other manufacturers you see here make theirs out of aluminum, which feels very solid in the hand. They also don't have moving parts like the maglite does in the head, which means they will last longer. I'm telling you, man, I know how you feel. Maglite is a venerable brand, for sure, and they have a classic appeal. But you're over-paying for an inferior product, by literally any definition."
flashlight,3ceq31,fluffman86,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:09:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks, some just look very plasticy 2 me"
flashlight,3ceq31,fluffman86,3,Tue Jul 7 18:13:19 2015 UTC,"That's because you haven't handled them.  There are plenty of manufacturers making rock-solid lights that will shame any maglite into submission.  They're generally a lot smaller than maglites, but that's because a lot has changed in the 40 years since maglite's design was put into place but Maglite is steadfastly holding onto the past.  So if you really want an aluminum baton with a little light at one end, then buy the maglite, but if what you want instead is serious lighting equipment, look elsewhere.  And please understand that I hate typing things like that.  I grew up using Maglites.  Still have them around.  I even bought one of their new ones, an XL200 I think, just to see what they're doing now.  Unfortunately the world of lighting has left them behind.  If they catch up in the future I'm more than willing to give then another chance, but right now they're just not the way to go."

I'm not terribly particular about beam specifics yet, but I noticed the tint on the SC62 is a little bit more yellowish than on the MH20, which I'm just fine with.  The main thing is that I'm going to much prefer the SC62 over the MH20 in terms of size for EDC, especially since I can carry the SC62 in my coin/watch pocket.

flashlight,3cd5h4,avaragewhiteguy,2,Wed Jul 8 16:45:17 2015 UTC,"These ""specialty"" batteries use a different material to provide power. Lithium batteries last about 10 years without discharging so they are good for long-term storage. They are designed to handle a higher amount of power draw from them without loosing capacity. I.E. AA will drop voltage when the flashlight is drawing at full power, whereas lithium or lithium-ion(rechargeable) can keep full power so they are more efficient.  TL;DR: CR123A works at about 3.7 volts and stays there longer. AA starts out at 1.5 volts and quickly drops down below 1 volt during hard use. So your light will dim faster. Higher voltage = brighter light.   Down side is that they are a bit more expensive than a AA. You could go with a light that can take an RCR123A (rechargeable CR123A) and get a charger for it. Just have to make sure the light can handle it. Lights like the OLight S10R I believe can do that as well as the Thrunite lights.  Let me know if you want further explanation."

Instead, why not get an ML-102 power bank and charger that takes removable 18650s? Then you can just pool batteries and limit the somewhat inefficient cross-charging to devices that don't have removable batteries."

You might want to look at the Nitecore SRT series. All of them but the SRT6 have a secondary LED for other colors. If you plan on using the red a lot, the SRT7 has three RGB LEDs instead of just one, so the red will be brighter. Mode selection is a rotary ring with infinite dimming from moonlight to max on the main LED and tactile detents for blinky modes and colors. Sure, there are extra colors you don't need, but the selector ring UI makes it easy to ignore the modes you don't use. The lowest price I see is $88 on Amazon.  The Panasonic NCR18650B is everyone's favorite 18650 here, and the Nitecore i2 and i4 are good chargers for not much money. Nitecore flashlights like button-top batteries, not flat-top."

With the selector ring in the standby position, its one click backwards to get to red and one click forward to get to white - although you do have to twist the white pretty far to get it to come on brightly.

I recommend the Zebralight H52w, or any of the other Zebralight headlamps (floody, pure flood, 18650 battery versions, etc). While they are headlamps, their shape makes them easy to use them as regular flash lights. I'd imagine being able to use it as a headlamp or clip it on your shirt would be quite useful on a canoe trip.

flashlight,3cadwi,Zak,4,Mon Jul 6 14:03:10 2015 UTC,"The favorite around here is the Panasonic NCR18650B. Fasttech has good prices on those, and I think they're not even counterfeit, but I'm not 100% sure.  Button-top batteries will work in more flashlights than flat-top. Protection circuits are circuit breakers attached to the negative end of the battery and usually trip under three conditions:   Overcharge Over-discharge - somewhere between 2.6 and 2.8 volts, usually Over-current - short-circuit, but also sometimes very high-drain devices   I think they're overrated because:   Any charger you should actually use won't overcharge the battery Unless your flashlight has a boost driver, the appropriate cutoff point for the battery and the minimum forward voltage to drive the LED are pretty close. Leaving the switch on for days after the light goes out will over-discharge the battery, so don't do that. The whole body of the battery is a negative terminal; anything that scratches through the wrap can bypass the protection circuit and short it. Keep your batteries in plastic boxes or inside flashlights so that can't happen.   You'll need a charger. The Nitecore i2 is a good quality 2-slot charger for under $15. The i4 is the 4-slot version for not much more. The Miller ML-102 is a 1-slot charger that acts as a USB power bank, which I highly recommend for that purpose, though maybe not as your primary charger being only one slot."

There are Panasonic-branded versions that do have a protection circuit, as well as a lot of third-party rewraps. 3400mAh cells sold by Nitecore, Olight, Keepower, etc... are all NCR18650Bs underneath.  You can use the 18650s you use for vaping in flashlights. It's my impression vapers usually go for batteries that can support the maximum current, sacrificing capacity if necessary. A typical flashlight won't put more than a 2-3A load on an 18650, so we tend to go for capacity here. I wouldn't spend anything on batteries to optimize for runtime with a cheap flashlight like that if you already have 18650s that will work though."

flashlight,3cadwi,Natanael_L,3,Mon Jul 6 12:37:40 2015 UTC,"Have a look at this chart. See how the emitter's forward voltage increases with current? Your light is doing to try to drive the emitter at about 3 amps. When the battery drops below about 3 volts, it won't be able to and the brightness will drop rapidly. You'll have no trouble telling when it's time to change the battery, and it won't be any different with protected cells as this happens at a higher voltage than the protection trip."

flashlight,3caggv,lxivbit,2,Mon Jul 6 11:46:09 2015 UTC,Actually combining the BC20 with rechargeable NiMH AA batteries would make a great choice. Fenix's BC series bike lights are excellently designed because the lens is actually designed similar to a car headlight in the sense that it lights up the path in front of you but doesn't blind oncoming cars and people walking. I strongly suggest getting a dedicated bike light over a normal light strapped to the bars. You seriously wont regret it.
flashlight,3caggv,mcfarlie6996,4,Mon Jul 6 14:22:42 2015 UTC,"I'm considering 14500 or 16340 sized torches. Would this be a significant tradeoff in terms of runtime?   Yes. The best 14500 is under 900mAh and 16340s are a bit less. The best 18650s are 3400mAh. You might notice that the difference isn't proportional to volume. The best 18650s have far higher energy per volume than other sizes, even semi-popular larger ones like 26650. I think it's probably that battery manufacturers are putting their best tech in to 18650s since they're popular for competitive applications like electric cars. Tesla uses Panasonic 18650s.  Lights designed to be bike lights like the Fenix BC30 will have a lens or reflector designed not to blind other road users. If you're riding in traffic, that or something similar would be a good choice.  If you're not riding in traffic, mounting a regular 18650 flashlight to your handlebars might be a good solution. Some of these are much lighter than dedicated bike lights. Since it looks like you're in to making things, you might even consider this for traffic use with a shade or diffuser to keep from blinding people. One concern would be heat: most of these lights put out 1000lm or so on their highest mode and can get hot enough to damage the electronics or battery. Some have a timed step-down to mitigate that, but the best option for continuous use is a light with thermal regulation. Two options that have thermal regulation and happen to be lighter than most flashlights are the Armytek Prime and the Zebralight SC62."

You really can get to any mode either immediately, or pretty fast. I've seen bits and pieces of the ZL UI on other flashlights, but none work in concert within themselves the way the ZL UI does.  The upside to ZL's choice there is that (in addition to immediate access to low -- always) you can ""flip"" between low and medium, without cycling through high. This is something I do a lot when walking around on low and need just a little extra light. I don't know exactly why, but I appreciate being able to go up to medium and then back down to low without cycling through higher modes.  As much as the SC62 is touted for it's size, for me it's the ZL's (all of them) UI."

P12 - 1 to 70 is kind of big, but not terrible as far as jumps from moonlight go. And I think 1 Lumen is a better moonlight mode than 0.3, personally. 70 to 240 is about double. 240 to 1000 is about double. I've never had a time I've needed more than 240 and less than 1000.   Again, that's just my opinion, I am not a lawyer, your mileage may vary, etc. etc. The TN12 is still a fine light, I just think the P12 is better, and as of right now it's cheaper as well.

Additionally, the User Interface is the best part because it's nice to have 5+ brightnesses along with hidden flashing mode instead of the cheap typical Low, Med, Hi, Strobe, SOS, repeat bullshit.

flashlight,3c9iq0,Zak,2,Mon Jul 6 18:42:27 2015 UTC,"I bought a Magicshine bike light from a local bike shop for $70. It was the most impressive bike light I'd ever seen at the time, being an XM-L driven from a pack of two 18650s. It has a round reflector and lense with no provisions to avoid blinding other road users and no real advantages over mounting a normal 18650 flashlight to the handlebars, but I had never seen one of those at the time.  I found this place before I bought a real flashlight. I had some idea what an XM-L or XM-L2 in a flashlight would be like from having the bike light. I bought an SRT5 for my first serious flashlight, and haven't really gotten anything horribly wrong since."

flashlight,3c9iq0,tonyhburns,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:11:34 2015 UTC,"I agree. But with the reflector set up that most good flashlights have, the emitter is exposed in the middle, and the amount of spill it has can be somewhat blinding for other road users. Vehicle headlamps have been made to a standard to allow some spill for this reason, yet not have so much as to cause a problem for other road users."

At first, naturally I was totally focused on output and so I ended up with an SRT7 (which is an awesome light, but much to big for me to EDC), eventually I ended up with an Olight S10 which has been almost perfect. I can just slip it into my coin pocket and forget about it till I need it. The only draw back was that the RCR123's would burn through juice so fast on higher outputs, so now I have a ZL H600w coming in the mail tomorrow! I'm willing to take a modest bump up in size for the sake of ensuring that I can use my light liberally, without having to worry about running out of battery at any second. So yeah, I learned that no matter how great the features/specs, the only useful flashlight is the one you have with you when you need it."

I got this last Christmas, shortly before I became the kind of person who reads about flashlights on reddit and CPF.  It's a $25 light (amazon) with a lifetime warranty. It's light and comfortable. It's been everything I've needed for household tasks, especially futzing around behind my TV/speakers/receiver situation. I think it puts out roughly 120 lumens on max. My wife reads in bed by the red light most nights. I like the single-button UI too."

flashlight,3c73n6,ggnorm,7,Sun Jul 5 14:14:39 2015 UTC,"I know you said you don't want a headlamp, but I'm still going recommend a H52w or H600w (or H52Fw, H600Fw for floody). These headlamps aren't shaped like your typical headlamps. You can easily take it out of the headband to hold it in your hand or clip it to your shirt with the included clip. They're incredibly small and light weight. The H52 takes AA or 14500 batteries while the H600 takes 18650. The output is very well spaced and easily programmable. I found myself cycling between all the modes as I needed last night when I went out to watch fireworks. The switch is recessed and I haven't had any accidental activations, though you could also unscrew the cap about 10 degrees to make sure it won't come on. They're right at the top of your price range, but I think they're well worth the money."
flashlight,3c73n6,Dc5e,3,Sun Jul 5 14:53:18 2015 UTC,Just got my H52fw and I agree. It's also easily a flashlight when you remove it from the headband. It's not gonna provide a 100yd beam or anything but it's good for every day things.

If you're just sticking this light in your knapsack and only using it for emergencies, then I'd suggest a 1xCR123A light. /u/mcfarlie6996 recently bought a Solarforce Z1 that's small and light (37 grams, less than 1.5 ounces) and looks like it'd fit the bill really well for you, and it's only $16.   If you get that and decide it's way too useful and you start burning through batteries and carrying it daily, then I'd highly recommend (as others have also) an 18650 zebralight. But for emergency use, less than once a month, go CR123."
flashlight,3c73n6,fluffman86,2,Sun Jul 5 21:28:41 2015 UTC,"I notice that people are reading what you wrote about weight and recommending the lightest of 18650[1] lights. How weight-sensitive are you? Would the 1.5 ounce difference between a Nitecore P12 (3 ounces) and Zebralight SC62 (1.5 ounces) help you, or were you just trying to exclude things that weigh several pounds like 4D Maglites?  [1] The 18650 lithium-ion cell is the One True Battery, being slightly larger than an AA with 4-6x the capacity and high instantaneous output for maximum brightness. Barring a specific reason for using something else, this is the battery you want. They're rechargeable."

flashlight,3c73n6,Zak,2,Sun Jul 5 23:39:04 2015 UTC,"Then what you're looking for is a single-18650 light. There are a ton of these. Here are a few that are popular here:   Nitecore P12 and Fenix PD35 - these are very similar lights from two popular manufacturers. They're at the larger end of pocketable, have a ""forward-clicky"" tail switch (half-press momentary, full-press lock on) and a separate mode switch. The Nitecore has an ultra-low moonlight mode while the Fenix has better mode spacing. Nitecore MH12 and Fenix UC35 - as above, but with onboard charging via MicroUSB port. Battery included. Nitecore SRT5/6/7 - rotating ring for a mode switch, infinitely variable brightness, tactile detents for blinky modes. The big advantage is that you can select a mode and know what it's going to be without turning the light on. Zebralight SC62 - extremely compact, innovative UI, neutral (less blue, but not yellow like an incandescent) tint option, cult following Zebralight H600 - can be a flashlight or a headlamp Olight S20/S30 - Poor man's SC62; S30 is slighly larger, brighter, longer throw. Magnetic tailcap may be convenient for some. Convoy S2/S3/S6 - semi-built-to-order flashlight available with a bunch of different LED and driver options. For most people, a neutral (3C is the common one, I think) tint and 2.1A driver are good. The mode selection and single-mechanical-switch UI are kind of lame, but they're well-built, as bright as any of the expensive lights (though you might need the 3.0A driver for that) and can be had for as little as $14.   A bunch of these are sold on Amazon with a battery and charger bundle. If you don't get one of those, you'll need a battery or two and a charger. The Panasonic NCR18650B is the battery most often recommended here, and the Nitecore i2 is a good entry-level charger. Some of these lights require a button-top battery and won't work with a flat-top."
flashlight,3c73n6,lxivbit,3,Mon Jul 6 00:00:22 2015 UTC,"Going on the small and light theme I think the Fenix HL10 would rock. It is small, light and is both head lamp and regular flashlight. You can detach the light from the strap.   If you want something a little beefier then I would go with the MH20. It has a 18650 battery, can do double time as a head lamp if you have a ball cap and flip the clip and it is bright. Great throw.  You mentioned the PD35 which is a great light. However the new Fenix PD35 Tac should be available on July 9th.  If you have any questions let me know!"
flashlight,3c73n6,mcfarlie6996,3,Sun Jul 5 14:48:24 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add to this that if OP is only using the lights for emergencies which hopefully rarely happen, then he might want to use CR123 batteries instead. CR123 batteries have an excellent shelf life over 18650s and so will hold their charge longer. Now this is only the case if the light will only be used once a month or less.  If you plan on using it more often than that then I insist on using the 18650 batteries which will provide better runtime over the CR123 batteries.   And to answer OP's other question, 99% of the lights we recommend on here are waterproof up to 1m deep so rain/moisture will not be an issue."
flashlight,3c73n6,cubenori,2,Sun Jul 5 17:08:52 2015 UTC,"To keep your budget low, I recommend the the thrunite tn12. You're going to have to get a charger and batteries for whatever flashlight you buy with a 18650 battery, which I feel is the best option for batteries."
flashlight,3c73n6,GnashRoxtar,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:52:57 2015 UTC,"If he's using it for emergencies only, he might do better to use CR123s just for the longer shelf life."

But also to make himself be seen if he's pushing the bike down the road to a safe spot where he can look at it. A small LED bicycle light with a rubber strap could also work well for this purpose.

flashlight,3c73n6,nm1000,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:11:33 2015 UTC,"Take a look at the new Armytek Partner C1 v2  and Armytek Partner A1 v2.  Like the Archer, they will weigh less than the PD35 and other 18650 flashlights. And they will accept Lithium primaries (longest shelf life) and rechargeable Li-Ion batteries for better economy. Note, always avoid AA alkaline batteries.  I like the wide hotspot produced by Partner's TIR optic, which IMO will be better for working up close. Armytek also offers the Prime series which is similar to the Partner, but with a side switch instead of a tail switch.  Armytek has a reputation for making durable flashlights.  The Zebralight SC52 series is also a very good lightweight flashlight that includes a model with a frosted lens for a very floody beam.  We may see a review here soon (I'm hoping) of the SC52Fw, which is the floody, neutral white version."

That said, you might be able to press something like a Nitecore MH40 or TM36 in to such service, keeping the charger plugged in while it's operating.

Off to searching I go.   *So I'm thinking this spotlight with some sort of AC to DC Converter. Honestly though I don't think anything that any company makes would make a good choice. What you require is a bright light. Bright lights create heat. Heat transfers to objects close to them which would be the body in this case.

flashlight,3c3o50,boomermax,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:31:52 2015 UTC,"Thought I'd share this in a separate post.  The Olight S20 and S30's magnetic base is somewhat weak and will not hold the light horizontally in a reliable manner.  To overcome this simply purchase one or two extra 3/4"" round rare earth magnets that you can stick on the end when you wish.  They cost about $2 and when you use magnets in series you increase the pull.  If you have an area you want to store the light, such as in your vehicle get a countersunk magnet and a screw and you will have a reliable strong mounting point.  A word of advice though... when purchasing a countersunk you will need to get the proper north south pole orientation.  I wish I could tell you which it was but when I ordered one of each the shipper sent them both stuck together with no labeling."

flashlight,3c3o50,AbraKedavra,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:45:59 2015 UTC,Yeah.  I was hoping to determine the pole so when I order additional for placement elsewhere I knew what to purchase.  They are cheap.  I guess I could gamble and purchase 1 of either pole and maybe get lucky.
flashlight,3c3o50,AbraKedavra,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:50:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess so. Or just purchase a magnet that has both poles marked(usually with N/S engraved or with the North side red). I have one and it's very useful for determining polarity in cases like this.   If you don't want to buy one, I guess you could get them at the Physics lab in your school/college/ or the nearest school/college if you're not a student."

Both run on rechargeable 18650 batteries. 1 battery is included as well as a charger for the light itself, but you can buy additional batteries for ~$12 each and a Nitecore i2 for another ~$15 that will let you charge the batteries separately from the light.   Both lights include a magnetic tail cap that would be perfect on a big metal bus - you could stick it practically anywhere."
flashlight,3c22wh,fluffman86,2,Sat Jul 4 01:41:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure onboard charging is a big benefit when he's talking about having spares on the charger while he uses it. The S30R looks to be $70 on Amazon while the standard S30 is $50. The S20 and S30 are great choices for the application with or without onboard charging, though I think the mode spacing may be suboptimal.  A 4-slot charger like the Nitecore i4 might be good for OP."
flashlight,3c22wh,Zak,2,Sat Jul 4 01:49:35 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, with onboard charging, I can charge on extra battery when I'm not actually at work. With the i4 charging five batteries is better than 4. (We have a thing for charging batteries on our work sites.)"
flashlight,3c22wh,fluffman86,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:39:20 2015 UTC,"Huh, last time I looked for the S20 and S30 I couldn't find it, or else it was really expensive from 3rd parties, so I thought they were discontinued.   Keep in mind that the non-rechargeable versions do not come with a battery. That's fine if you're buying lots of spare batteries and a Nitecore I4 or D4 charger anyway, but I'd probably spend the extra for the rechargeable version.  My reasoning / justification: S30 is $50, S30R is $70. That's a $20 difference. Minus a $13 battery (that you'd buy anyway, 2 for $26 on Amazon), difference is $7 to get the charger. That's worth it to me.   Then I can still buy the 2 pack of 3400 mah batteries and a charger and I'm only out an extra $7 for the convenience of having a built in charger, plus I have 2 spares instead of just 1 spare."
flashlight,3c22wh,fluffman86,2,Sat Jul 4 03:03:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you, between you and zak, you've got me really interested in these olights.  EDIT: however the review I saw did not at all impress me with magnet strength...."
flashlight,3c22wh,fluffman86,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:50:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I haven't used the Olight baton series personally, so I can't speak to the magnet strength. I've seen a post here of a guy (calling /u/boomermax) who stuck one up in his jeep, though he was using the much smaller 1xCR123A Olight S10R.  https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/38pzaf/found_perfect_spot_for_my_olight_s10/  A smaller, shorter, lighter-weight flashlight like that would probably make better use of the magnet, especially when used at 90 degrees to horizontal. All the extra weight at the end of an S30R might be too much for the magnet, but it should work fine when used vertically.  If you think the magnet might end up being an issue or not working correctly for you, then I'd probably pass on the baton series unless you wanted the S10R, but with that you're giving up a LOT of runtime - 650mah in their RCR123 versus 3400mah in an 18650. As /u/Zak mentioned the mode spacing isn't the best on them, and it looks to me like the button is really flat and might be hard to find.  If you wanted to give up the magnet, then I'd suggest (surprise!) the Zebralight SC62w. It uses a side-clicky button, but instead of it being flat it's recessed into the head, making it really easy to find. It's about an inch longer than the S10R, but half an inch shorter than the S20R, and still uses 18650 batteries for insane runtime (11 Hours at 150 Lumens, which is probably still too bright inside a school bus in pitch black night). You'd need to use an external charger with it, though, but with the runtime you're getting that shouldn't be a problem if you grab a spare. It's small enough to ride in the 5th pocket on my jeans, with about as much output as the S30R and a lot of flood light to work with, too.   Now to give credit to /u/bsarocker - he got me thinking about sticking a magnet to my light. I still wouldn't do it with a PD35 (or my very similar Nitecore P12), but it might be possible with a SC62w since it's smaller and doesn't use a tail clicky.   Check out /r/SC62masterrace for some more links and reviews about that light, and especially watch this YouTube review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWJFQegalhU"
flashlight,3c22wh,fluffman86,3,Sat Jul 4 04:31:58 2015 UTC,"Bear with me please, I'm new to this sub. I think my biggest hesitation towards the lights you and rocker are recommending is that they seem to focus more on precision lighting than flood lighting. My coworkers use about 4-5 of those mac lights I linked to light the entirety of the bus as bright as day, and I'll admit I've been a little jealous. More importantly, they're able to move about the bus at will without ever losing that light. We install camera/dvr systems, so the more light we have the better."
flashlight,3c22wh,nm1000,3,Sat Jul 4 05:16:46 2015 UTC,"I checked out the mac light a little more closely and I'm starting to get a better idea of what you're doing. The Zebralight I linked and the PD35 would both be considered fairly floody around here, but they're both more EDC style lights that you keep with you and use temporarily. The SC62w is probably floodier than the Olights I linked.   You could also tail stand the SC62w (not the PD35) and use it as a lantern by bouncing light off the ceiling, so that might be an option.  Oh, how about a Zebralight headlamp? It's is really just a 90 degree light that also comes with a headband, so maybe something like that would work. They make extra floody versions, too. The H602w has no reflector at all so it's just a wide wall of light. The H600Fw has a frosted lens to break up the spotlight. The H600w is going to have a pretty comparable beam pattern to the SC62w.   See this video for a look at the different beam profiles. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPU4-Z5t2h0  Edit: meant to add that the more I look at that Mac lights you posted, the less I think anything that's been posted so far is what you're looking for. Hopefully someone chimes in tomorrow with a true work light suggestion. I don't have much else to offer, though I will add that I think one of the headlamps might be more versatile."
flashlight,3c22wh,fluffman86,2,Sat Jul 4 05:36:40 2015 UTC,"First of all, thank you for your help so far, I hope I'm not being too difficult.  Secondly, you're right: headlamps are the second most important tool when we work night shifts, but I'm actually happy with my current one. Honestly, with the right hl, there's no absolute need of the floodlights. Just now that I have a little cash burning my pockets, I'm looking to upgrade to something I dont have to strap to my head.  Third(ly? Idk if that's even a word) You've brought to my attention that I should probably edit to better clarify my planned usage. I will update soon."
flashlight,3c22wh,mcfarlie6996,2,Sat Jul 4 05:56:33 2015 UTC,"Right, take a look at the linked ZL headlamps, especially the H602w and the video. Big wall of light, cheaper and brighter than the Mac lamps, and you don't have to wear it since you could still mount it to a wall or stand it on its tail and it'll throw at 90 degrees just like the Mac work light. Not your typical headlamp at all."
flashlight,3c22wh,boomermax,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:04:29 2015 UTC,"The pure flood produced by the ZL H602 and H602w is fantastic for the kind of work you describe. It would be my preference.  Armytek makes a headlamp with a floody beam (comparable to the H600Fw mentioned above) with a magnetic base.  http://www.armytek.com/products/flashlights/headlamps/armytek-wizard-pro-warm-xml2.html  Note, I sometimes carry an Armytek (similar to the Wizard) in my hand. A right angle flashlight isn't ideal to be carried that way, but it's OK."

flashlight,3c22wh,bsarocker,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:55:17 2015 UTC,"Allow me to shed some light on the various S-Series. (gratuitous pun not to be overlooked)  I own the S10 (non-rechargable), the S20r and the S30r both rechargable.  Of the 3 the S10 and the S30r are 2 of my favorite EDCs.  Due to the size of the S10 the magnet strength is sufficient to hold the light at any angle.  Not so much with the S20r and S30r.  Both of the rechargeable verisons have a smaller magnet to allow for the charging port located in the bottom but there is a very cheap easy fix to this.  Grab an extra magnet and stick it on the end when you need it to be really secure, take it off when you don't and stick it to the lid of your tool box.  You can even get a countersunk that can be permanently mounted in areas you want to store your light.  Magnets are sort of like batteries. The more in series the greater the overall pull strength.  As far as run times.  All 3 verisons will exceed a typical work day in the proper mode and all 3 are more than adequate for lighting up close quarters on medium.  In fact I would argue that 1000 lumens 4 feet away bouncing off your work area can be somewhat distracting in itself.    With all of this said, there is a reason I have all 3 although the S20 wasn't necessary and was purchased prior to the release of the S30r.  The S10 is not only better at utilizing it's magnetic base it is also a perfect size/weight to clip on the brim of a hat."

You'd either need to temporarily mount the magnet or use some weird 90 degree magnet mount.   But hey, you did give me a great idea for my SC62w: http://i.imgur.com/hDNUyVN.jpg  Right now it's just two hard drive magnets taped together. Works better (at least in my head) since the SC62 is a side clicky. One magnet sticks to the metal object you want to mount to and the other to the flashlight. I think I'm going to leave it as is since the tape will protect paint on a car I'm working on or whatever, and it can just be an extra doohickey to use when I need it without needing to permanently carry it or attach it to my light."

flashlight,3c0xox,bibamus,5,Fri Jul 3 19:28:37 2015 UTC,"Built-in charging has some drawbacks. First, it adds cost and complexity to the light. It's more parts to buy and more parts to tear up.  It also adds bulk - its something else you have to carry around at all times. Plus you can't use and charge the light at the same time. Going with a desktop charger and bulk cells means you can share the charger among lots of lights, plus charge spare batteries for longer runtime away from a power source.  You can have zero downtime if you keep a spare cell on the charger at all times. Lights dead? Just swap in the spare and go. And if your charger breaks you're only out the $20 or whatever you paid for the charger, not $100 for the whole light.   But that's just my opinion. I realize some people want it simple and prefer a built-in charger. There are lights with that feature and choice is a good thing.   SRT7 is a fantastic light. What don't you like about it, other than no built-in charging?"
flashlight,3c0xox,emarkd,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:04:56 2015 UTC,"With the Nitecore D2 Charger available for twenty bucks on amazon, there's literally no reason to get a light with a built in charger.  I got it a couple days ago, and it's really awesome. Comes with a plug for your standard house socket, but it also comes with a cigarette lighter plug (for the car), which I completely didn't expect. There is also a D4 charger, which can charge 4 batteries at once, but I'm not really sure I see the need. I don't really go through batteries often enough to warrant that.  So, OP, get a good charger, and let your flashlight be a flashlight, and your charger be a charger. In this case, there really isn't a ""best of both worlds"". Carry a couple of spares with you if you are afraid of running low. But with modern LEDs and modern lithium batteries, I've never run into the problem of running out of battery. (I have had a battery issue once before, using alkaline batteries in my 2xAA Fenix LD22, but it was because I left the light turned on overnight without realizing it. Great light otherwise, though I know you're not looking for a 2xAA light.)"

No, there's plenty of reasons to get one with built-in charging but one must meet that requirement. Example, I'm on vacation right now so my EDC is the MH12. I'm actually using it right now to charge my other battery from the flashlight that I left here back in March. I wouldn't want to lug around my 2/4 port charger with me. Example 2, a LEO who spends most of his time driving but here and there makes stops and house calls and such...  He can charge his light in between his stops to keep the battery at full capacity.

flashlight,3c0xox,PriceZombie,4,Sat Jul 4 01:47:14 2015 UTC,"I have the SRT-5, and I must say that I like it quite a lot. The ring selector is really awesome, and lets you make sure the light is in the mode you want BEFORE you turn it on (which can be a huge deal if you're in the dark and only want a little light and don't want to blind yourself).   You do need to remember the order of the things though, if you are trying to go into a mode other than constant on. There is a detent of some kind in the ring, so you can tell when you've gone from one mode to the next. Then the ""constant on"" settings are between two detents, so it's really easy to tell when you've got it set to constant on.  The SRT-5 also does blue and red, but I think I'd warn against getting one of the SRT lights JUST for that reason. They don't use the main LED for the red and blue light, but instead have a separate color LED. And the color LED is not nearly as bright as the main one. The red is good enough for reading maps in the car at night, but I've never tried to use it to navigate in the woods at night or anything like that. I'm not sure that it would be up to the task. The blue looks a little brighter (to my eyes, anyway), but it's still best for looking at things that are sorta close up and in the dark. Something else is that the color LED is offset, meaning that it doesn't get to take full advantage of the reflector (the reflector still works, but it's not as efficient as if the color LED was in the center of the reflector).  So, depending on what it is exactly that you plan to use the colors for, a filter might be much better.  And you are looking at the SRT-7, rather than the SRT-5. It looks like the main difference is that the SRT-7 has a much bigger head, and thus a larger reflector, so probably better throw than the one I have. I'm not sure how much that will help out with the color LED though, since I think it's still offset.  TL;DR: The SRT lights are great, but I wouldn't get them thinking the color LED will be able to replace color filters. In dark conditions, looking at things that are only a few feet away, they're okay, but even with a full moon, you might not be able to make much use of the color LEDs."
flashlight,3c0xox,GreenLizardHands,2,Fri Jul 3 22:13:52 2015 UTC,"They don't use the main LED for the red and blue light   And those few that do (FourSevens did one and there are some cheap Chinese lights) will likely use the XM-L Color, which doesn't come anywhere near 1000lm in any color.  The SRT7 uses three RGB LEDs (that is, each of the three is capable of all three colors). It should be brighter in those colors than the SRT5."

So, I'd still prepare yourself to be underwhelmed, but not disappointed. Should be fine for your purposes. And the low light mode is low enough that you should be able to use it for anything you'd use the red one for, in case you find the red inadequate.   I wouldn't use it as an EDC light, but for the use cases OP mentioned, I think it would be very good. Only reason I think it's not suitable for EDC is the size of the head. It'll make it uncomfortable in pocket for normal everyday pockets."

We don't know why she was fired because it is none of our business.  Even if she shared her side we only know... her... side.  Getting involved in a fight with only a smidgen of knowledge is admitting you are willing to not only be affected by mob mentality but you are also willing to propagate it.    As I admitted i only briefly skimmed the facts and do not have a thorough knowledge of them.  I chose to do so because I'm completely aware that even if I read all of the belly aching I would still come away with only a smidgen of knowledge as to the truth.  That being said... there is just something wrong with a flashlight going dark.
flashlight,3byqz6,emarkd,8,Fri Jul 3 11:54:26 2015 UTC,"I am (was?) a regular reader and occasional participant at /r/Iama.  I think that sub generates some fantastic content and really gives reddit a huge amount of credibility in the public eye.  Reddit as a company seemed to agree; after all they built an official app for for AMAs.  Victoria (/u/chooter) was a huge part of that process and I can't understand why they'd cripple it in this way.  While there are rumors floating around about the reasons, we may never know the whole truth.  But reddit as a service is clearly worse off without Victoria.  That said, I think its important to note what's going on in some of the other subs.  I watched the whole shitstorm play out yesterday afternoon on /r/OutOfTheLoop.  Reddit drama is best drama, right?  /r/Iama went private because they were caught unprepared without her help and didn't have a choice.  /r/science, /r/books, and /r/music followed suit quickly because they also host regular AMAs and relied on her.  Some other bigs subs followed suit just as a show of solidarity, a protest.  But this won't last.  /r/science is already back up.  As is /r/books.  That's two of the big four affected subs already back to business as normal.  Some of the protesters like /r/funny are still down, but again that won't last.  Let's be honest, if these sub mods think they can win a fight this way, they're wrong.  The admins will just demod them all and put a new team in place if that's what it takes.  You can't fight a fight against reddit on reddit - they own the site; we're just users.  If they keep this shit up we'll all find a new home (/v/flashlight anybody?) and reddit will die like Digg and many other sites, but the mods don't really have the power to affect or prevent that change, only the admins do.  So I guess what I'm trying to say is that no, I don't think we should get involved very much.  I think I'd support a dark theme, or a message in the banner or something simple like that, but I wouldn't take the sub private.  We're not directly affected by her firing and even if we were, I don't thing going private would accomplish much anyway."

They don't exactly have to justify why they do anything. The consequences of not doing so is another matter, but they still don't have to. Also, we don't know WHAT happened.   On the other hand, without the users, and more importantly the moderators, Reddit doesn't really exist. It thrives on user based participation. A big part of it is that it is so diverse that you can pretty much find anyone from any profession/gender/location/Random experience here. There's no Reddit without redditors. Victoria was apparently a very integral part of /r/IAMA, and even though AMAs are some of the most popular posts on Reddit(Heck, your president did one),the admins completely blindsided them, leaving them with no support system at all, pretty much gutting the subreddit.

The most popular rumors center around the Jessie Jackson IAmA or Victoria's opposition to certain management ideas for monetizing the IAmA process. If either of those are the underlying issue, I am inclined to take her side.  What we can reasonably comment on is the manner in which the situation was handled with the community. The administration left the mods of /r/IAmA in the dark without a flashlight and evidently screwed over several people who had IAmAs lined up. Even responses from /u/kn0thing, who did an excellent job handling community outreach from the earliest days of reddit seemed snarky and tone-deaf. Community sites require trust between the community and the owners/management of the site.  With that in mind, I do support some sort of protest. I don't think going private is the right answer for this subreddit, but a black header or the like seems like a good way to show solidarity.

I'm glad that /r/Flashlight didn't go down - many subs chose to disable submitting things which, if anyone's been skimming my post history they'll already know, has been my opinion on how smaller subs could show support. But the dark theme is a unique and good show of support.  I know I'm a little late to the ""party"" in replying here, but I figured I'd just put my opinion out there.

Only the Reddit admins and Victoria know why she was let go and the former party most likely will not comment on that. I personally think this should be disregarded in your decision. About the lack of feedback from the admins, I can't speak about that. I've never managed a subreddit, much less one as large as the defaults. As much as you feel that the community is a team, this should be a decision for the moderators as they are the ones that might know to what extent this issue is real and they are the ones that it affects. It'd be a shame to see yet another sub go dark but if it leads to a better experience for all parties in the future then it's definitely worth it. Sadly I don't think that the reddit admins could give two shits whether /r/flashlight goes dark or not, the few hundred users that frequent this sub are a drop in the bucket.

This is really the sc62's biggest feature - its tiny but still full-powered.  interface. Zebralights got the best single-button interface, bar none. The single-button part is important because that keeps it small (see point 1).  If we're not worrying about size, I'd honestly say a selector ring like my SRT7 is my favorite interface, but those things add bulk.

flashlight,3bxphz,Magneticitist,2,Fri Jul 3 11:44:23 2015 UTC,I don't own one ($$$$$) but I do periodically have access to one. Unfortunately there's no way to reliably measure lumens without a proper integrating sphere. There are homemade ones (several such projects on candlepowerforums show up if you google it) but they're very difficult to calibrate properly and are kind of a pain to build. I tried once and gave up because it was just too difficult to do right.
flashlight,3bxphz,mcfarlie6996,2,Fri Jul 3 14:39:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've read several of those candlepowerforums posts myself and have been tossing around several ideas.  Seems like there should be better options than milk cartons and the like, but I just haven't come up with something yet.    Honestly though, whatever we build doesn't have to be perfect to be usable.  Yeah it'd be nice to be able to absolutely measure lumen output but just having the ability to do comparisons between lights is quite useful.  For instance, a homemade lightbox may not be able to accurately say that Light A put out 983 lumens, but it could fairly accurately determine that Light A makes 10% more output than Light B, or that such-n-such mod added 5% more output to a light.  Those are useful things, too.  I'm going to build something, I'm just not sure what yet."
flashlight,3bxphz,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:45:08 2015 UTC,"as far as lumen measurement or at least a relative measuring device, what would be the major flaw in not using a light dependent resistor setup in a box? maybe the box is reflectively coated on the inside maybe not, but either way it seems like a total light measurement could be done that way. either that or i was thinking somehow the same general concept should theoretically work as long as the measuring device is attached directly at the head of the light so the only room the light has to bounce around is within the reflector itself. i used to think solar cells could be used for this also but now i think they are too dodgy when it comes to different factors like the angle of light or concentration of light on particular areas of the cell."
flashlight,3bxphz,AbraKedavra,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:45:57 2015 UTC,"what would be the major flaw in not using a light dependent resistor setup in a box?   Nothing.  I think that's exactly how an integrating sphere works, its just a perfectly smooth and reflective surface with the detector placed in the center to get the highest reading.  Plenty of people get very close using simple things like opaque milk cartons.  Those are generally lined with a white sealant that's kinda reflective so they do a pretty good job spreading the light around evenly.  And since its opaque cardboard they don't leak much light."

Make sense?   Like my MH12 reads the same as my P12 but my P12 reads ~20m lower than Selfbuilt.

flashlight,3bx0b3,GordoJones88,6,Fri Jul 3 00:18:25 2015 UTC,"Well dang. Guess I'll have to recommend the Zebralight SC62w.  It's pretty much the perfect little EDC light if you're willing to spend the money on it. It's tiny - almost smaller than the cheap $5 1xAA Mini Cree lights (SK68 clones) on Amazon. When I first got it, I didn't think my 18650 would fit because it's not much larger than the battery itself. The W version uses a warm tint which is just lovely and has a max of 930 Lumens, and a minimum of 0.01 Lumens and a total of 11 brightness levels. You don't have cycle through all 11 either - they pick 3, you pick 3, and the rest are hidden. Strobe is accessed by triple-clicking the switch while it's off.  It sounds kind of complicated, so just watch this review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWJFQegalhU  For lots of pictures and reviews (mostly by /u/emarkd) pop over to /r/sc62masterrace"
flashlight,3bx0b3,fluffman86,3,Thu Jul 2 22:00:26 2015 UTC,Sweet Odin that light looks awesome! Just watched a video on it. Love how you can program each mode and adjust the strobe. It also looks like the PERFECT size to edc but also use at work. The only problems I have with it are going to need to buy the charger and battery separate and lack of tail switch. Personally I don't mind having just a side switch but I am so used to griping the light in a fist  and adjusting the modes from the tail with my thumb so my dominant hand can draw and handle my firearm.  I do have a surefire with a ring grip I could strictly use on the range. I guess that would fix that issue.
flashlight,3bx0b3,emarkd,2,Thu Jul 2 23:20:38 2015 UTC,"Technically you can hold this light in an overhand grip and operate it with your pinky.  Its awkward and probably not ideal, but it can be done.  Its not really a very tactical light..."
flashlight,3bx0b3,fluffman86,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:18:43 2015 UTC,Yeah you said side or tail would work so I recommended that. If you're looking for a fully tactical light then I'd suggest the Nitecore P10. It has a forward tail clicky for on/off/momentary and an extra mode button below that on the tail so you never have to adjust your grip. You can even use the mode button as a momentary strobe button when the light is off.   Problem is that light is 6 inches long (like the P12 or PD35 - just barely pocketable) and doesn't have a moonlight mode so I wouldn't consider it for an EDC light.
flashlight,3bx0b3,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:58:49 2015 UTC,"We really need /u/emarkd to take a lux reading of his light because while this is an excellent light, I really wouldn't consider this a light with ""good throw"" vs lights like the PD35 & the P12."
flashlight,3bx0b3,emarkd,3,Thu Jul 2 22:16:36 2015 UTC,"I can do that in a couple of hours.  I don't have either of those other lights for comparison though.  You're right that its not a very throwy light.  I like to post this photo a lot showing how much light it puts out, but really this is from an 8th floor balcony and probably 250 ft back off of the beach.  Quick Pythagorean math and a Google conversion puts it at about 81 meters in a straight line.  I still personally think that's plenty of light for almost all EDC needs, at least certainly for all my needs, but other's uses may vary."
flashlight,3bx0b3,fluffman86,2,Thu Jul 2 22:29:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd like to see some more hard stats. SelfBuilt says it's 173 meters for the SC62 cool compared to 195 on a PD35. 72 feet isn't a huge deal to me.  http://i243.photobucket.com/albums/ff97/selfbuilt/2014/2014006/SC62-FL1-Summary.gif  I wouldn't consider my P12 to have ""good throw"" either, compared to a Javelot. And neither the P12/PD35 nor the Javelot would I consider to be pocketable. P12 is doable but...  Anyway, ""good throw"" is subjective I think, and the SC62w doesn't give me much less useable throw than the P12. Someone who's used to a minimag will say that either one has good throw just because of the sheer amount of light output, and when he's talking about about poking around a vehicle or around the house at night, sub-lumen is definitely going to come in handy."

flashlight,3bwbxk,Erik_TL,3,Thu Jul 2 22:56:12 2015 UTC,"I also have an SRT-7 but I use the Blue quite a lot where I work as a dim work light.  I work in a performance theatre and that colour changing LED basically sold me on the torch, I have worked on shows that put me above peoples heads or just outside the sight lines of punters and they still don't see me thanks to the blue LED.  I do get the feeling its still a very niche thing to have but for me its great!"

flashlight,3bu1so,SoySauceSyringe,3,Thu Jul 2 03:48:11 2015 UTC,"With Nitecore flashlights at least, no, your flattop batteries will not work. Those're made for buttontop batteries exclusively. Also, XM-L2 is just the LED used in the P10, not part of the actual name. And most strike bezels that come attached to flashlights are not very big, allowing you to pocket them bezel down. The only flashlights that come to mind with large strike bezels out of the box are Olight's M18 and M1X Strikers, which are pocketed bezel up.  How far do you want your flashlight to throw? How do you want your beam to be adjusted, actual tightening of the beam by turning the bezel or just dimming it with a ring or button?"
flashlight,3bu1so,BestLightStore,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:12:24 2015 UTC,"Olight's M18 and M1X Strikers, which are pocketed bezel up.   Well the M18 is bezel up but the M1X is bezel down. I think the M1X would be the best choice for OP and hits every requirement although I don't believe it has SOS(is this a must have?). Also, I think he meant adjustable as in having multiple modes from what I'm gathering and just used the wrong wording so the M1X hits that requirement well with its 5 modes. I also love the shortcut modes Olight has to offer:   From Off you can enter moonlight mode. Press and hold the side-switch and then click the tail-switch.  From Off half press once for momentary, two half presses for High and half press three times for Strobe.   Review here"

flashlight,3bu1so,MegaUBERhyperBEAST,4,Sun Jul 5 06:20:22 2015 UTC,"Other users have pointed out that Nitecores don't like flattops. This is only half-true; there's a plastic reverse-polarity protector on the positive terminal that works by only allowing a button top to touch the terminal. It's only held on by friction and can be trivially removed without damage. I did this on my SRT5 and now use it with flattop laptop-salvage Sanyo cells all the time.  On the subject of the SRT5, they're down to $60 on Amazon now and fit most of your other requirements. They don't actually have an explicit indication when the battery is low, but brightness will drop sharply below 3 volts, and if you leave it on much longer than that, you'll drop below the emitter's minimum forward voltage and the light will turn off.  The big selling point of the SRT series is the control ring UI. Brightness is continuously adjustable from 0.1lm to 750lm by turning the ring. Various blinky modes have detents when turning the ring, so you know what it's set to without having to turn it on."
flashlight,3bu1so,Zak,3,Thu Jul 2 11:19:05 2015 UTC,"I carry a Nitecore SRT5 with me about every day, and can confirm that it's an excellent light. I haven't ever tried using it with a flat top battery, but I just took the light out and looked, and it does seem that there is a plastic bit that gets in the way for reverse polarity protection, and it appears pretty easy to remove.  The bezel is crenelated a little bit, but maybe not as much as OP wants. Still, I think it's going to be a much better flashlight than anything with the kind of bezel OP wants. And since 99.9% of the time it will be used as a flashlight, and almost all of the rest of the time you're better off running than trying to use your flashlight as a defensive tool, I think it's probably fine. Plus, effective crenelations don't really make it that much more useful as a defensive tool. Either way you're getting hit hard with a solid chunk of metal. The fact that one of the pieces of metal is a little pokier than the other is never going to be a deciding factor in how things turn out.  If OP is dead set on the crenelations, I'd say get a P60 host (maybe the SolarForce L2P or L2T or something) and a P60 drop in module. The bezel on the L2 series is replaceable, and I think they have scary looking ones."
flashlight,3bu1so,GreenLizardHands,3,Thu Jul 2 13:02:26 2015 UTC,"It's a steel bezel with pretty thin edges. Getting whacked in the skull with it would be quite unpleasant, and I think more effective than something more spiky but made of aluminum. That said, I think blinding an attacker so as to have a head start running or fighting is the main offensive use of a flashlight in a fight and how good the bezel is for striking is secondary."
flashlight,3bu1so,Zak,2,Thu Jul 2 13:52:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  All these flashlights are basically solid bars of metal anyway.  If blinding the attacker doesn't work and you have to strike them, I think it would hurt pretty bad whether there's crenelations along the edge or not."
flashlight,3bu1so,emarkd,2,Thu Jul 2 13:55:07 2015 UTC,"I almost posted a similar comment as I've seen that plastic bit on my Nitecores as well.  I've got an SRT7 that I know is built that way and it looks easy to remove.  But in this review of the P10, Selfbuilt makes this statement:   The contact board in the head is also updated from the P12. On the P10, there is an electronic reverse polarity feature in the head (instead of physical). This means that all flat top cells will not work in the light now (i.e., only smaller button top accepted).   So I was afraid that they had updated the design on newer lights and that it wouldn't apply to the P10 OP is looking at.  I don't know though..."
flashlight,3bu1so,emarkd,4,Thu Jul 2 13:50:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, indeed. It looks like the P10 might not be so easy to get working with flat-top cells, requiring some soldering at a minimum. I therefore do not recommend the P10 for OP, but the P12 and SRT5 are viable options."

In fact they're one of the few brands who don't.  Most lights will take either style but Nitecore usually does some sort of ""reverse polarity protection"" that usually relies on the button top of the cell making contact with the anode pickup spring.  Other than that they're great lights and I'd have no problem recommending them if you wanted to buy a different battery, but that's not what you want to do and I don't blame you.

But yes in most situations with most flashlights you would be better off with a 3400mAh cell that's rated for less power handling.   The only other thing I could think of relatively consumer wise that these could be used for would be very high drain cordless power tools like cordless reciprocating saws (Sawzall) and maybe even leafblowers/hedgers things of that nature which would take a very high load to power their motors, especially things that have to cut through metal/steel like a reciprocating saw."

flashlight,3brovx,undress15,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:13:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've been literally dreaming of the 18650 coming to consumer/American culture for years!  It really has to at some point, basically any proprietary battery pack that can fit them already uses them due to how efficient and cheap they are.  Companies need to just make electronics even smaller by bypassing these packs and letting us use our own 18650s in some items.  Hell the other day I was saying I'd really love a wireless keyboard with backlighting and I think it would be entirely possible to make one that had two or even more 18650s located towards the back of the keyboard (it would have to be a bit thicker than some towards the rear to accommodate this but who cares)   They could make it use the most efficient LEDs possible and allow brightness control because it's not like you need it anywhere near as bright as some of the wired models. I just want to be able to see the keys a bit easier in the dark.  Put in a setting so it only lights up when you press a key (and then stays on for an adjustable amount of time unless another key is pressed like 5-30s etc) would save battery and I bet you could easily get a week or more of use out of it like this running on a couple 3400mAh 18650s.  That and imagine if you only used the backlight at night (made it easy to enable/disable) ... it would probably go forever without needing charging, could also enable it to be hooked up via a standard USB port for wired connection and slow charging (eventually all ports will be USB 3.0+ and then charging wouldn't even be that slow?)  I mean the fact the wired backlit models are already running off a USB 2.0 port (500mAH max?) says those lights don't need much power and some of those are very bright. I don't even need that level of brightness/bling on a battery model.  I would pay for this and this is just one of the MANY things 18650s could improve on.

I can't figure out why you'd have to send the light back to FourSevens for reprogramming, especially for a ""nominal fee"".  That seems like the wrong way to do a programmable light.

flashlight,3brpxt,Zak,2,Wed Jul 1 17:45:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, the UC35 can charge any 18650 by USB. So can the Nitecore MH12, MH20 and MH10, which are similar lights you should also be considering."
flashlight,3brpxt,Zak,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:02:40 2015 UTC,"I've just checked the 3 Nitecores you've mentioned.  Well, I've ruled out the MH20 since it is too small for my liking. The MH12 and MH10 are very similar. I've seen that they have an SOS and Location Beacon feature, which to be honest I can live without, especially since the SOS feature is probably the ...---... which can be done manually.  The UC35 offers 5 settings: 15,50,180,480 and 960 lumens. The Nitecores (MH 10 and MH12) offer 4 settings: 1,70,240 and 1000 lumens.   While the 1 lumen setting is good for (correct me if I'm wrong) a firefly setting, but there is a sharp decrease from 1000 to 240 lumens, I think due to that I'm picking the UC35 over the MH12 and MH10.

flashlight,3brpxt,Chadzy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:50:38 2015 UTC,"1000lm to 240 won't be as big a drop as you might think because human perception of brightness is logarithmic.

flashlight,3brpxt,Zak,2,Wed Jul 1 17:50:29 2015 UTC,It also allows me to use a battery pack if I need to   Are you talking about using a power bank that probably has 18650s inside it to recharge the 18650 in your flashlight? Better solution: get an ML-102 and share batteries between it and the flashlight.
flashlight,3brpxt,Zak,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:04:15 2015 UTC,"Ok, sounds like a good idea. But what torch do you have in mind then?"
flashlight,3brpxt,ebosh,2,Wed Jul 1 19:51:47 2015 UTC,"The UC35 and various Nitecore MH models are still good options, but if you consider the ML-102 a good replacement for having onboard charging on the light, there are a ton of good 18650 lights. I was suggesting it more as a replacement for other power banks, as charging a light from a power bank isn't all that efficient.   The PD35 and P12 are the UC35 and MH12 without onboard charging. The Zebralight SC62 is very compact and has a cult following. Various products from Olight and Armytek are excellent. I'm fond of the continuous dimming and offline mode selection on the Nitecore SRT series. The Convoy S-series is dirt-cheap and well-built."
flashlight,3brpxt,AbraKedavra,2,Wed Jul 1 20:12:19 2015 UTC,"given this, I'm opting for the UC35 since it is my first torch and the only device I'll have with the 18650 batteries for now. With this, I'll have a way to charge them immediately. I will consider this later on though"
flashlight,3brpxt,AbraKedavra,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:21:50 2015 UTC,The UC35 is a good choice. You won't be disappointed.  I'd suggest ordering an ML-102 anyway because they're dirt cheap and make an excellent power bank for phones and even have enough amperage for tablets (though it will take several 18650s to fully charge a tablet).

flashlight,3brpxt,tf2honeybadger,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:50:14 2015 UTC,Is the UC35 better in terms of capacity?
flashlight,3brpxt,fluffman86,2,Wed Jul 1 17:53:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, seeing As you can take any battery from 1600 to (currently) 3400 mah, and upgrade whenever you want. There is no guarantee that Fenix will make the UC40s custom battery in higher capacities."
flashlight,3brpxt,avaragewhiteguy,2,Wed Jul 1 17:58:52 2015 UTC,Not exactly. The UC35 comes with a 3200mAh battery while the UC40 comes with a 3400mAh battery.  Honestly they're so close in capacity that I wouldn't factor that in. 3400mAh is currently the highest* available and it's going to be years until there's a significant improvement in capacity of these types of batteries. The tailor battery does factor in for me but that's only because I have over a dozen 18650 batteries already. If a tailored battery isn't an issue then the only things left is the tail-switch on the UC35 and the extra mode(50Lm) that it also has because the other outputs are nearly identical. They both use an XM-L2 so emitter efficiency isn't a factor. Same throw distance and same body size too.
flashlight,3bqjux,MixedWithFruit,3,Wed Jul 1 09:59:23 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I will get any beam shots from this.
flashlight,3bqjux,mcfarlie6996,6,Wed Jul 1 10:26:27 2015 UTC,That's understandable for a lantern. Just give us some insight. How are the modes. How big of an area does the max output light up? How low is low output? Is it like a nightlight at that low of an output? Anything else you'd like to mention.
flashlight,3bqjux,adamjo91,2,Wed Jul 1 11:21:37 2015 UTC,"Modes are great. Mine lights up a 30' x 45' room really well. Low mode is very much like a nightlight and battery life on low is astounding.  Turned it on moonlight mode 11 days ago with the battery it ships with and left it, and it's still running. They say max runtime on moonlight is 600hrs, so we will have to wait to find out! :D"
flashlight,3bqjux,mcfarlie6996,6,Wed Jul 1 14:21:38 2015 UTC,I love that it takes a single 18650. That's a huge selling point for me because of the advantage these batteries have over Alkalines. This Fenix CL25R is definitely a close contender to the Thorfire lantern the /u/Spaced_Inv8r reviewed which also takes (two?) 18650 batteries.
flashlight,3bqjux,Spaced_Inv8r,3,Wed Jul 1 15:09:34 2015 UTC,The Thorfire can use 1 or 2 18650s because they are run in parallel.
flashlight,3bqjux,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:18:04 2015 UTC,I went for this mainly because I can recharge the battery in the lantern with micro USB
flashlight,3bqjux,Spaced_Inv8r,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:06:52 2015 UTC,The Thorfire has that feature also. Both are excellent choices IMO. The Thorfire has the advantage in runtime because of the two batteries while the CL25R is a bit brighter.
flashlight,3bqjux,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:16:49 2015 UTC,"One thing I have not tested yet is the runtime with all 3 AAs and the 2 18650 batteries.  It might be much greater.  A coworker saw my review and purchased one for camping, we'll see how well he likes it after this weekend.  Jeeze, I didn't realize the thorfire was $30 cheaper."

Since I didn't test the runtime this way,  I can't say for sure if the runtimes are affected.  I might try and test it in a few weeks so I can know for sure.  I was a bit busy when I made the review, and a long runtime test or two can add a single day or multiple days to my testing.  If I had a month or two with just a single light I could test every mode, but I don't have that luxury or want to devote my camera to weeks on end of runtime tests."
flashlight,3bqjux,BigDaddySodaPop,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:29:57 2015 UTC,I wouldn't either. Runtimes on High are more than enough info for everyone to gather vs claimed runtimes which we can make assumptions from that info for the lower modes.

flashlight,3bnp3b,Chadzy,4,Tue Jun 30 20:56:39 2015 UTC,"Inspired by this discussion earlier today, I decided to see for myself what's inside a protected cell.  I took apart a KeepPower 3400.  You can see all the steps in the imgur album, but here are my findings:    You can easily remove the protection circuit from one of these cells and still have a working battery.  The entire body of the cell is part of the negative terminal, so be careful or you'll short it out.  If you were really careful, you could probably even leave the positive button-top on there.  I didn't try because I had already shorted it out once and didn't want to push my luck.  The leftover cell still tested fine using my multimeter, works fine in my Nitecore D4 charger and works in my lights.  Its a working unprotected 18650.   For one final test, I took this newly naked cell and another KeepPower 3400 and put them in a direct-drive FET light.  The protected cell supplied 2.9 amps, right on for a 3-amp cell.  The unwrapped cell without the protection circuit jumped to about 5.5 amps in the same light!  So clearly the protection circuit was doing a good job limiting the current. adds a lot of resistance to the cell.*  *Thanks to /u/Zak for the correction."
flashlight,3bnp3b,Chadzy,6,Tue Jun 30 18:03:52 2015 UTC,"So clearly the protection circuit was doing a good job limiting the current.   Perhaps I'm mistaken, but it was my impression these protection circuits are circuit breakers, not current regulators. That is to say, limiting the current to 2.9A is not a design goal of the protection circuit - rather, it should trip and cut off power completely at 11.5A.  There could easily be extra resistance in the power connectors or the PCB itself, which would limit current as a side effect."
flashlight,3bnp3b,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:21:28 2015 UTC,"There could easily be extra resistance in the power connectors or the PCB itself, which would limit current as a side effect.   That's probably correct.  I'm not sure really.  Makes sense."
flashlight,3bnp3b,Stunner07,3,Tue Jun 30 18:23:54 2015 UTC,The amp increase is why I mostly have unprotected cells. You could rewrap it so that there'll be a less chance of shorting it.
flashlight,3bnp3b,Stunner07,3,Tue Jun 30 18:16:15 2015 UTC,"I've only got one light that really benefits from unprotected cells, so most of mine are protected.  If the light only pulls 2-3 amps then it really won't matter, and the protection circuits add a bit of, well, protection for these small lithium bombs we carry around in our pockets.  I really do agree with you though.  Li-ion cells are perfectly safe as long as you're not an idiot."

We've also got plenty of fire extinguishers around here, so I was prepared in any event.  But I didn't really want to have to do any of those things...

Whether it's bad or not is for you to decide, but many of us try to avoid those cells because you really have no way of knowing what you've really got. If they're lying about capacity, what else are they lying about?   EDIT:  These 3500 mAh cells are the highest capacity available, but notice they're in the 18650GA form factor, which is ever so slightly wider than 18650B's that most of us use.  I bought one just to check it out, mostly for the discharge rate, and it only fits in the barrel of one of my lights.  That's why you see so many 3400 mAh cells.

Before, I think, a triple click would go to low. They added the quad-click battery level check.  That's definitely a handy thing.

I currently have an SC52w, but I suspect that the SC62w that I have on the way is going to take over a lot of daily duty from it.  One thing I do like about the SC52w is that it fits mostly comfortably in the coin pocket of all of my shorts and jeans. This might not be an issue much longer because I'm switching to a Skinth OG pouch for my multitool and light (if the SC52w/SC62w fit in the side tube).  Also what's the stepdown like with regular eneloops from H1?"

flashlight,3bnznb,nm1000,2,Wed Jul 1 02:50:12 2015 UTC,Will this be your first light with a frosted lens?    Yes   Have you ever tried a mule?   Technically yes? I used to take off the lens on my Sipik SK98 when I'd go walking by the canal to flood the area in front of me.
flashlight,3bnznb,mcfarlie6996,2,Wed Jul 1 03:06:03 2015 UTC,"Cool!  I thought of buying a Sipik SK98 just for that purpose. My ""mule"" is a Fenix PD32 with the reflector removed. Many lights have a retaining ring near the front of the light holding in the lens and reflector. So, they leave the emitter down in a well, which doesn't make for a good mule. Many of the Fenix lights unscrew just past the emitter, leaving the emitter (nearly) fully exposed. However most Fenix lights threads are glued at that junction. But for some reason my PD32 wasn't. I love it, but it's limited to about 300 lumens. And the other mules that I know of (that aren't right angle) are AA models -- for example Spark makes one.  So I went searching for images of disassembled lights to find an 18650 XM-L that comes apart with a fully exposed emitter. And that's when I noticed SK98. It's still on my list.  BTW, even though I complain about the Armytek Prime's UI, there are things I like about it. It is the perfect size to take a Surefire F04 diffuser. It doesn't widen the beam a lot, and the center is definitely brighter than the edge (so it still has some throw), but there is no longer a ""spot"". That makes the Prime a very versatile light. FWIW, compared to the F04, the comparable Nitecore diffuser produces something pretty close to a mule. It widens the beam considerably and diffuses the hot spot even more than the F04."

I'm sure they'd make a great light, too, but I don't think ArmyTek makes anything nearly as small as these little Zebralights.    I've had mine since last fall when they were released and its been in my pocket every day since.  Its been completely submerged numerous times, dropped onto concrete from the top of an 8-ft ladder, tossed around many times by a curious 18-month old, and covered in paint and oil at times.  Its been a little tank.  I'm sure I'm not as hard on my lights as some people since I don't actually work in an extreme environment or anything, but I use my lights and this one has never faltered."

flashlight,3bnznb,nm1000,4,Tue Jun 30 20:10:11 2015 UTC,I've both an Armtek Prime and a Zebralight SC600w (which is very similar to the SC62w -- just a little larger).  Both perform very well and have similar beam patterns. However the Zebralight user interface is better (IMO) than the Armytek.
flashlight,3bnznb,fluffman86,3,Tue Jun 30 20:28:05 2015 UTC,"Interesting, care to go into any detail on why? You don't have to describe them both exactly, I can probably find that on youtube, but anything that sticks out to you would be appreciated!  Thanks for taking part!"
flashlight,3bnznb,Machmax777,3,Tue Jun 30 20:32:48 2015 UTC,"The short answer is that I can get to my most used modes much faster with the Zebralight than the Armytek.   From OFF, the Zebralight can go immediately to low and high. From ON, it can go directly to low, and very quickly to high. You always have pretty fast access to 6 modes.  The Armytek Prime often makes me wait on it to cycle to a desire mode. The UI shows some thought behind it and they have some good ideas, but it just isn't as well crafted. For example, to get to a low mode from ON you must first turn it off. Then turn it back on with a press and hold. But unlike the Zebralight, it doesn't come back on in low immediately. It must wait to make sure that it really is a press and hold, and not a click. So there is a delay before it turns on in moonlight. I typically prefer the next mode (about 2 lumens) so I must wait a bit more for it to cycle to low.  OK, I confess, that is a first world problem. However, because the ZL UI is better crafted it doesn't need to wait to distinguish a click from a press and hold, so it switches to low immediately (from OFF or ON). Furthermore I've programmed my Zebralight so ""low"" means 3 lumens. Therefore I don't need to wait for it to cycle through any of its 3 (yes 3) moonlight modes to get to my desired low of 3 lumens. However once in low, I can go quickly to a moonlight mode when I need to. And I could make any of the moonlight modes my default low mode.  I'll stop here. It may sound a bit complicated, but it is easy and efficient to use; even if the description is rather long.  For the record, the Armytek UI is not terrible. It just isn't as efficient as the Zebralight UI."

Not only to make my penis feel bigger, but it will definitely blind anyone I point it at, and as this is going on my defensive pistol, that and accurately identifying what's in my sights were the most important aspects.   I watched a few videos of it, and they addressed this claim, and none seemed too worried about it. Yes it's bright, but unless your shining it in a mirror you should be fine.  As a rifle light though? ehhh, it will definitely work, but a more dedicated tac light would probably work better.   I use an Eagletac G25C2 mk II on my AR, it goes up to 1000 Lumens, and honestly I've never had that be ""too bright"" unless it shine it at a white wall 10 feet away or less. However it can be used in dimmer modes so there's that.  I'd check out a more dedicated rifle light, they are very durable, the batteries are much better if you get one with 18650s, and almost always have kits for remotes, mounting, and plenty of brightness/ strobe modes built in."

flashlight,3bmjtr,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:30:30 2015 UTC,Oh nice. I just bought the same exact one yesterday too from Night Owl Gear. I plan on using rechargeable NiMH Eneloop batteries for the most part but a 14500 can get you about 200 more lumens on it if needed although the batteries will drain quicker at that high of an output. Personally I have these KeepPower 14500 batteries that work great too but they have additional brands. I'm pretty sure the Eneloops will offer the best runtime overall but the Amazon Basics are a good cheaper alternative if money's tight. They might have a charger combo pack but if you ever decide you'll want to use 14500s then you'll need a different charger for that. Otherwise I can guide you to a charger that charges both types.
flashlight,3bmjtr,AbraKedavra,2,Tue Jun 30 13:43:21 2015 UTC,Is the only advantage to the 14500 more lumens? I'll probably go with the eneloops. Is the standard charger that the eneloops come with good?
flashlight,3bmjtr,mcfarlie6996,2,Tue Jun 30 14:48:03 2015 UTC,Not really... You can't charge cells individually with that charger. You have to charge them in pairs.   The D4 & D2 are probably one of the better cheaper options to where you can charge a cell individually. I can't find the thread but there was some mention that the i4 & i2 aren't that good of a charger for NiMH batteries.   Hopefully someone else can give you additional options.

For anyone who doesn't want to read my very long post, here's the TL;DR:  The i2/i4 are piss poor chargers of NiMH batteries.  They work fine for lithium but they SUCK for NiMH.    I ran an i2 with Eneloops for a few years, batteries were undercharged EVERY time unless you leave them in the charger for 6-12hrs after the charge is done.    Almost any 4-channel NiMH charger you find on Amazon will do a better job than an i2/i4 when it comes to NiMH cells.  I'm currently running a D4 though, and I couldn't be happier.  A good full charge each time, and no overcharge."
flashlight,3bmjtr,mcfarlie6996,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:29:04 2015 UTC,Ok thanks for the help. One last question.. on the 14500 batteries they have a warning that says do not over discharge.. how do you prevent it from over discharging?
flashlight,3bmjtr,AbraKedavra,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:11:46 2015 UTC,"Both the Olight and the KeepPower that I linked have built-in protection circuit to prevent it. Otherwise for batteries without the protection you just don't let the battery drain 100%. When you see high output looking half as bright as it usually does then it's time to charge. If you discharge the battery too low(below 2.8V) then it most likely won't charge back up to the typical 4.2V and won't run/last the same. While I'd always recommend batteries with protection circuits, Zebralight actually make their lights with built-in discharge protection which you can find on their item page in the Features; ""Builtin over-discharging protection for 14500 batteries at 2.8V cutoff""."

If there's a problem isn't it most likely to be that? Then you'd (probably) have a perfectly fine unprotected Panasonic cell you could use - carefully.   Or am I missing something? I admit I've never tried it because I don't have a bad cell to experiment on and don't really want to ruin a perfectly fine protected cell to find out.

The first one would ""bounce"" up to 4 volts and then to 0. After a while, it would do the same again. The second battery may have done that once or twice, but then nothing. If it doesn't work in the flashlight, and the charger can't make sense of it, there is probably nothing that you can do.  <mild rant> Both came from the same retailer. The retailer suggested I didn't know how to use my own multimeter (note I began my career designing and building modifications to handheld computers). I misplaced the first battery before I could resolve the issue, so I let it drop. Sometime later I ordered an headlamp from the same retailer (they had the best price) and decided to order a battery; which had a similar problem. I just didn't want to deal with them again, so I ate the cost and ordered from from my regular source, who has supplied several batteries without issue. </mild rant>"
flashlight,3bmdmy,boomermax,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:56:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just came back to the charger and it was actually charging. I took it out and was like ""sweet"" and put it back in and back to registering nothing. I will keep messing with it."
flashlight,3bmdmy,mcfarlie6996,3,Tue Jun 30 13:03:14 2015 UTC,if it starts charging again leave it be until it reaches a full charge.  If the PCB has tripped it needs a certain amount of voltage to stay reset.
flashlight,3bmdmy,boomermax,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:36:01 2015 UTC,Have you ever seen something related for Eneloop batteries? I had one battery that was doing something similar last week and after the 10th attempt it finally started charging while its partner(xbox controller batteries) had no issue a all.

Your Z1 looks just as great.  I'm definitely a Solarforce fan.  This is the first time I've seen that carbon fiber body though.  That thing is sexy.  Its going on my wish list for sure.

flashlight,3bkiij,tonyhburns,5,Mon Jun 29 23:37:00 2015 UTC,If you're only measuring battery voltage and nothing else then even cheapy ones will do.  Anything actually serious (compared to just measuring battery voltage to see if they are charged or not) I would save money and spend more later.  Even a completely shit one should be accurate to two decimals of a volt.
flashlight,3bkiij,ABirdOfParadise,3,Tue Jun 30 00:38:24 2015 UTC,I use those free harbor fright multimeters and they're plenty good enough for voltages. For amps I have one that is shunt modded and can read amps higher than you'll need in a light.
flashlight,3bkiij,Chadzy,3,Tue Jun 30 01:28:46 2015 UTC,"UNI-T UT61D. I have a UT60A I got from Sparkfun when they were giving away free stuff. It's no Fluke, but it's a good meter for the price."

flashlight,3bkiij,FivePtFiveSix,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:55:27 2015 UTC,"While cheap, I don't like the lack of a 2A range. The jump from 200mA to 10Amp is a bit big for me. With flashlights you certainly will want to measure Amps in the 100mA to 2A range."
flashlight,3bkiij,markus_b,2,Tue Jun 30 17:04:16 2015 UTC,"you are what the cheap meters at harbor freight are made for.. i have tons of them. some people just need simple voltage or batt level measurement and none of the other functions. a cheap $5 meter is perfect for you. harbor freight is the only place i know to get them for $5 though. BUT even just for that $5 you get all the basic functions of a multimeter. a more expensive meter is either going to give you a wider range of measurement per function, add functions such as inductance, capacitance, hertz, temperature, etc.. those functions the average hobbyist will never need unless they delve into semi-complex electronics. If you want one that you can just consider decent to have for a while so you might as well spend more than $5, i'd recommend just finding one that has a resistance scale that goes up to 20 megaohms or higher, and has a built in transistor tester.  They sell a decent one at Walmart for $20 i believe, and it goes up to 20megaohm and measures temp, and also has a small light on the front and a built in voltage detector (can hold it near a wire and press the button and it will beep if the wire is live with ~50 volts AC or higher). It's got a yellow frame and comes with a little carrying bag. i have had a couple of them for about 2 years now and still saw them being sold at walmart about a month ago.  just grabbed one to see label and its made by Etek."
flashlight,3bkiij,Magneticitist,2,Tue Jun 30 05:28:16 2015 UTC,"I know this is a late post but there are a few meters that might be of use to you.   UT61E - Avoid UT61A-UT61D they are much lower quality meters. It has 20,000 count resolution (useful for monitoring a slowly draining battery) and a data connection to PC (serial). Input protection is pretty crap but if you won't use it on mains voltage that isn't an issue. External build quality is very good, with an easily readable display. uA/mA measurements as well. Amprobe 510 - Much better input protection than UT61E, with very valid CAT ratings but lower count 4,000. Has a bunch of nice features for all around use. uA/mA measurements as well Fluke 101 - Less features (in particular lacks current measurement) but the best input protection of the bunch."

flashlight,3bkiij,nedstaint,4,Tue Jun 30 00:11:06 2015 UTC,"Fluke is always a great answer when it comes to meters.  You can see my old Fluke 76 in this post from yesterday.  I've had that meter since, I think, 1996 - so its almost 20 years old.  I use it all the time and its never given me a bit of trouble.  I don't remember what I paid back then but it wasn't cheap.  However a quick Amazon search shows several models less than $100, so not too far off of budget."

flashlight,3bkiij,KamiCrit,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:24:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you everyone for the advice! I still haven't decided yet, but reading all of your replies and some other threads, I also discovered battery testers :) The ZTS MBT-1 seems to be one that several people recommend.  So here's my new dilemma. My medium term goal right now is to become as well-versed in all of the detailed electronics aspects of my lights and their batteries as you all seem to be, since this seems like such a fun realm to get into. So should I forget about the dedicated battery tester and just continue on my search for a halfway decent multimeter so that I can perform measurements on both my batteries and my lights?  Btw, after seeing the price ranges for these things, I'm okay spending a bit more, and I think my criteria has now evolved to want a multimeter that I can really grow with for awhile while I learn about all of the fun things :)  Does anyone have experience with/recommend the entry-level Fluke multimeters that seem to run from $115-155 (the 113 and 115)? I keep hearing Fluke, Fluke, Fluke everywhere I look."
flashlight,3bkiij,markus_b,2,Tue Jun 30 14:47:00 2015 UTC,"Fluke is the grand master of multimeters since decades. They are well designed, robust and reliable. But you'll pay a premium for the reliability and robustness. For what you do with flashlights it may be overkill."
