When the building is burning down they want you to call campus police, that's stupid, just for them to call the fire department a few minutes later than otherwise. That could make a big difference.  This image just makes me angry."
thereifixedit,3dwsji,Owyn_Merrilin,10,Mon Jul 20 07:14:45 2015 UTC,"It's kind of impressive in a way. When I lived in the dorms, there were inspections and you weren't allowed to have so much as an extension cord because of the fire marshall's rules. And here we see a school breaking much more serious rules than the ones mine got onto students for breaking."
thereifixedit,3dwsji,Toysoldier34,2,Mon Jul 20 07:26:17 2015 UTC,They have to set strict rules for students in the private rooms compared to a public hallway. They know the rules will be broken so they set them strict to meet in the middle. There also needs to be more regulation because they will make stupid mistakes that could cost a lot from others by starting a fire for instance.
thereifixedit,3dwsji,Deamiter,4,Mon Jul 20 22:47:04 2015 UTC,"At both my college and my work, you call campus security first and let them call 911. It takes an extra 30 seconds up front, but the dispatchers don't have a precise map of where each phone number is installed (since it changes weekly as phones are installed or moved). In many cases, the same bank of phone numbers could be used at locations miles apart, adding to the confusion!  If security is in the loop, they are immediately ready to escort the first officers from a known location to the fire, and later arrivals can follow the flashing lights. Otherwise, the police show up at the security checkpoint asking where the fire is, and the guard has no clue, wasting up to half an hour if the dispatcher got inaccurate information and everybody drove to the wrong gate.  Don't second guess security on this. They can be annoying and worthless much of the time, but coordinating emergency responders is something they're actually critical for at large facilities."
thereifixedit,3dwsji,Heretical_Infidel,8,Mon Jul 20 15:08:41 2015 UTC,"It takes a lot more than 30 seconds for the call to get from the reporting party to campus security to the local 911 in most cases.  You need to think about the time wasted explaining whats happening, when instead a student can just call 911 directly.  Calls from cell phones go to the state police from what I know and are filtered down to the city from there.  If you can explain yourself in a calm manner, that takes about 10 seconds.  From there, all you need to do is tell your local 911 what building it is.  I guarantee that the companies that are dispatched know what building is where, it's something that is trained on regularly.  Furthermore, every piece in my city has a map of every campus and office park, its mandatory to file one with fire prevention.  One last thing... if a building is on fire, everyone is going to know which one it is."
thereifixedit,3dwsji,Deamiter,6,Mon Jul 20 17:17:45 2015 UTC,"I was actually in campus security for 3 years in college, and while I escorted police a dozen times late at night (almost always for a medical), out of 5 or so cases where they called 911, only once did they give enough information to the dispatcher to save the 30-60 seconds it takes for us to get the dispatcher on the line.  In all but one escorts, the responding officer was NOT familiar enough to drive directly to the building even with clear directions. They (rightly) demanded we ride with them through winding campus roads to prevent confusion or mistakes.  At my work now, where security is actually professionals (not just college kids), they are incredibly efficient, getting dispatchers online in well under 30 seconds and dispatching ERTs and campus security within a minute for all fire and medical calls.  Further, in case of an evacuation, immediate response by security is far more important than slightly faster police response (assuming you can accomplish that by bypassing standard procedure). They're trained to evacuate specific buildings, and are easily as effective as police in the initial response.  Maybe if you've got clear directions rehearsed for emergencies, you respond extremely well under sudden adrenaline, and the dispatcher perfectly relays your instructions, calling 911 would be slightly faster. Maybe you're imagining a really simple campus, not the winding mess of unmarked, one-way private roads with ever-changing nicknames that many facilities grow into.   In any case, my experience is that even intelligent people give crap directions when the adrenaline hits, and following the instructions the police worked out with your specific facility will always be the best method unless you have explicitly (in writing) worked out an alternate procedure with the involved security and local dispatchers for a specific situation."

Car is now in the shop because I screwed up the repair somewhere along the line and lost brake lights. So basically I wasted 4 hours trying to repair the switch."

The OP's device therefore is designed for 6V (probably; check the next paragraph), but 5V is obviously close enough to work in this case. It probably runs slower on USB than it would with 4 good batteries.   When batteries are connected in series (+ to -), you add the voltage. When they're connected in parallel (+ to + and - to -), the voltage remains unchanged but they can provide more current and/or a longer runtime.  If an 8-battery device has 2 parallel sets of 4 serial batteries each, then USB might work as a substitute, but current draw could be a concern."

Not to mention the best way to insure your patch holds is not to have to use one in the first place.  There's a reason 99% of the things most people drill into stucco are under the protection of the eaves.  This pipe is 2' off the ground...why would the property owner risk inserting something into his stucco in order to hold a pipe which, presumably, is transporting water?  That's an unnecessary risk when there's an low-risk, very effective alternative.  By all means though, keep pretending you know what you're talking about.  I'm sure the guy that has no idea where to buy affordable seafood, how to shop and cook like an adult, and plays skyrim all the time is just an absolute expert on all things construction and home repair."
thereifixedit,2nenb1,Aliencj,-1,Tue Jan 27 01:03:37 2015 UTC,Ive built and renovated many houses. And string has never been an option. Btw tar paper is way old people use plastic now. Btw water passage is typically filled with a little spray foam or another type of seal.  Under protection of eaves... rain doesnt hit wall cuz of eaves?!?! Eaves protect the foundation. You sir are the real retard. Im glad u liked my profile. Tar paper... dead give away your an idiot. I guess I knew that when u said 30 30 sweep and said strings a good option. My house is string free. I bet your house is duct taped together and string ties the roof on.
thereifixedit,2nenb1,BrainTroubles,1 point,Tue Jan 27 05:07:16 2015 UTC,"Eaves protect the foundation.    Or not....  I mean...what the shit are you even fucking talking about?

I guess I knew that when u said 30 30 sweep   Do you have a better term for two 30 degree pipe elbows forming a sweep joint?  If so let me know, captain knowledge.

thereifixedit,2nenb1,BrainTroubles,0,Wed Jan 28 02:05:33 2015 UTC,I dont care what you say mr. Verified by internet. Eaves protect foundation by moving water away from house. Concrete is not water proof. Concrete is destroyed by water hitting it. Tar paper is old and shitty. They sell it to cheap ass holes. My experience? Repairing foundations and making them as waterproof as possible. Half the battle is making sure water is kept off the foundations with eaves. Man for an expert u sure are a dumbass. Try learning your field in depth instead of arguing string is part of a proper repair. Derp de derp.
thereifixedit,2nenb1,BrainTroubles,0,Wed Jan 28 02:25:28 2015 UTC,"When the gutters are clogged, the water overflows the gutters and drops directly next to the foundation.  This will be readily seen by debris hanging on to the gutters and splash back next to the foundation.  Commonly, a divot or trough may be cut into the lawn next to the foundation.  This makes the standing water issue greater as it creates a pond or creek.  Your foundation is made of concrete which is very porous.  Just like a sponge, it sucks up the water.  During a freeze, the water in the concrete freezes and expands and pushes apart the concrete.  That is where the cracks start.  Small cracks can be patched usually for $300 per crack.  Large ones may require jacking up the house to repair the foundation.  This expense can run several thousand dollars.  Source: not e how you fucking loser"
thereifixedit,2nenb1,BrainTroubles,0,Wed Jan 28 09:15:24 2015 UTC,"You have spelling mistakes I'm your posts too.  Also, concrete itself is NOT waterproof. So the other guy has a point. Eaves ARE there too help push rain water away from the foundation of the house. Just like the grade near a hole is supposed to slope away to help push water away from the foundation of the house."

thereifixedit,25bgg2,elkydeluxe,3,Mon May 12 22:32:05 2014 UTC,"Alright. So I did not follow a guide, but can walk you through a couple things. I kinda wish I had the time and supplies to make a video or something. Maybe this weekend?  Lets start with a list of what I had and used for this project. I had a wireless extender that had poor signal, a usb wireless adapter to connect my PC to wifi, and a router I was no longer using that had 3 pretty good antennas.  The first thing I did was pop open the extender to find the core of the problem was 2 pretty small antennas. I took the antennas out of the old router along with the wiring that attached the antennas to the router. I stripped the wire and soldered it to the same point the old antennas were using, and left the old ones in place. This resulted in a marked boost in signal strength both receiving and sending.  The reception at my computer was still lacking. The size of the USB adapter only had space for an incredibly small built in antenna. It was effectively the size of a staple. It was a tight squeeze but I was able to solder the router antenna in alongside the existing one for this device as well.  The result is a huge performance boost. I'll see about creating something more visual to help explain this weekend."
