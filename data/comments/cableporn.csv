cableporn,3dtvpo,abigviking,4,Mon Jul 20 07:08:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would not have used cable ties (or at least used velcro cable ties).  In a live sound setting, if any of those components or cables fail, they need to be changed out as quickly as possible.  The guitar techs and sound guys at a live show are like the pit crew at a race, speed and problem solving are of the utmost importance."
cableporn,3dtvpo,despicable_secret,18,Sun Jul 19 14:56:57 2015 UTC,"True, but in a live sound setting, you're not worried about the organization of your cables if 1+ fail. You'll just disconnect the cables in the ties and plug new ones in, and then fix the organization later.  That being said, I would probably use velcro as well so I can re-do the cables without wasting material, but it's a job well done with the zip ties."
cableporn,3dtvpo,wjdp,14,Sun Jul 19 15:32:33 2015 UTC,"If it is mine, I'm not even cutting the ties. I'm just pulling the offender and letting it dangle there while I plug in a new one."
cableporn,3dtvpo,115208,8,Sun Jul 19 15:46:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly, same thing on a larger scale with lighting rigs. If a 20/30m cable run fails you just run another alongside it and tape up the ends of the defective cable. No point taking a single cable out."
cableporn,3dtvpo,justanearthling,7,Sun Jul 19 18:03:44 2015 UTC,"Meh, this makes it very unlikely there will be a mistake in the first place. Cable failure on tour is low, more often than not the problem is with the patching. This makes it so patching mistakes will be extremely rare.  In the event that you need to troubleshoot, bring a new 1/4 cable to the party and worry about the mess later."

It still handles like the Vyatta CLI, but they have made a lot of changes -  specifically to handle their hardware. The community is great -  very helpful. They have semi-open alphas and betas for new firmware, too.   I can't speak for it under super heavy load, but I have this unit handling routing and dhcp for 5 vlans, as well as running open vpn, 3 ipsec peers, and a dns forwarder - there is about 8 people on it max at any one point in time though.

I loved how it felt, so I ordered a bunch (I'm an xbox developer, so I was able to get them cheap from MS) and I switched out all my HDMI cables for those... NEVER had a problem since.

cableporn,3d0onc,AllanCD,7,Sun Jul 12 17:36:12 2015 UTC,"Yea, I was kinda wondering why it wasn't grounded too, but figured this may have just been a splitter, with the ground block elsewhere where the drop comes off the tap."

Those are PPC AquaTight connectors that have a built in weather seal. The rest of them are PPC EX connectors. They seal around the cable when compressed, but the screw side has no protection and typically has a seal thats put on the splitter.

The middle box is intended for coax and telephone.  The pipe from the ground comes from your providers at the street.  The pipe on the right of the box that seems to stop half way down?  That one is an ""LB"" that goes into the house.  The pipe keeps water off your equipment and out of your house.  It should be properly sealed off so water doesn't enter your house.  A ""bond"" wire (green #6 AWG) should go from your bonding system (the same one that bonds your water pipes and gas line) up the right pipe into your cable/phone box and bond the ""demarcation"" point between the cable provider and your house coax in that box.  It should also bond your phone lines coming in.  This saves your house from minor surge voltages coming in off the line.  For outdoor coax, you're looking for a service entrance cap with the PVC coming down similarly."

cableporn,3cfk77,gordonator,0,Tue Jul 7 21:37:10 2015 UTC,"When you have a current spike, if your power cables aren't thick enough you'll get a voltage drop. When the voltage drops too far, your amplifier will clip producing distortion. To reduce that, you put really thick wires on the input voltage, to reduce the resistance there and therefore reduce the voltage drop.  The total cross sectional area(thickness) of all the speaker wires should, in theory, be the same as the total cross sectional area of the voltage input wires. In practice, you can get away with smaller speaker wires because the amplifier itself will loose a good bit of energy before it is delivered to your speakers. A typical class AB amplifier, theoretically 78.5% efficient. And most actual amplifiers are a fair bit less efficient than that."
cableporn,3cfk77,derwhalfisch,2,Wed Jul 8 02:33:58 2015 UTC,"nah man, it's all class d now,  approaching 90%"
cableporn,3cfk77,ROCK_SET,-9,Thu Jul 9 05:51:06 2015 UTC,"AC current is moving to the speakers, and because the voltage swaps very quickly, you end up vibrating the electrons rather than moving them long distances, as is the case with direct current. AC doesn't get as hot and has less heat generation than DC."
cableporn,3cfk77,linerror,6,Tue Jul 7 21:02:39 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with whether it is ac or dc, or how far electrons 'move'. Only current flow. AC absolutely gets as hot if the average current is the same. Lower voltages require more current for the same power, hence higher losses."
cableporn,3cfk77,BSantry,-4,Tue Jul 7 21:10:00 2015 UTC,"If the DC voltage is the same as an AC voltage, the DC will get hotter due to the extra time spent at max voltage. Not as much heat generation during the switch from positive max voltage to negative max voltage."

Higher voltage in the system does not imply higher losses over the conductors, only higher current does. 12v AC means RMS 12v, which is the same, from an average power perspective, as 12v DC."

cableporn,3cfk77,SeymoreBhutts,0,Wed Jul 8 14:27:42 2015 UTC,"You do realize that the fuses used in these amps are slow-blow so they can sustain power higher than what you calculated, right?  And there's nothing wrong with going above minimum spec required."
cableporn,3cfk77,datums,6,Wed Jul 8 14:50:41 2015 UTC,Looks awesome. might want to watch those audio/power lines crossing dont create any noise. I used to get a whine from the alternator that went up with rpm and chased it down to an audio line crossing a power line. Figured I'd mention it but with the quality/equipment I see you probably already got it sorted.
cableporn,3cfk77,ISkypeWithMyCat,6,Tue Jul 7 16:31:49 2015 UTC,"Always avoid running speaker or signal lines near or along power lines. If you must, cross them at a 90 degree angle, but never run them next to each other. Twisting the positive and negative speaker wires together is also a great way to eliminate noise. Twisted signal lines are a big help too."
cableporn,3cfk77,qroter,-3,Tue Jul 7 17:14:21 2015 UTC,With DC this shouldn't be a problem is my understanding.
cableporn,3cfk77,machzel08,8,Tue Jul 7 17:42:02 2015 UTC,Only with perfectly clean DC. The alternator puts out fairly clean 3 phase AC that then gets converted to somewhat uglier DC with a lot of high frequency harmonics by the rectifier.
cableporn,3cfk77,machzel08,2,Tue Jul 7 18:50:13 2015 UTC,"It still is. I've done a lot of installs, and before I started doing this religiously, there would be the occasional engine whine and noise. Afterwards, not there. I've installed and helped repair a number of audio systems in vehicles, home theaters, and stage environments as well that suffer from this same problem, and its usually a great place to start. While it may not always be necessary, it never hurts, so I look at it as good practice no matter the application."

cableporn,3c9t29,ThellraAK,8,Mon Jul 6 11:23:29 2015 UTC,"That's a bit of complicated work. For instance, how are you going to turn off the power to your existing breaker panel so that you can safely swap it out? Usually you'd call the utility to cut off power, but if you don't have a permit...  You can do it, but you probably shouldn't. At very least, if you do, get an electrician to sign off on the finished work. They usually don't like doing it, but if your work is well done (better than code, easily inspectable, well documented, etc.) then they usually won't mind (for a fee)."

cableporn,3c9t29,GldRush98,4,Mon Jul 6 19:41:10 2015 UTC,"Whole bunch of caveats there.  First, depends on where you are. E.g. in Chicago, you need a licensed electrician for damn near anything, from what I understand. Here in Grand Rapids, I can make almost any to-code change I want to my house's electrical system...exceptions being stuff that touches mechanicals (i.e. the furnace), or changing out the panel itself. That kind of thing at least requires an inspection.  Second, if you do something that requires an inspection, you can get burned by it after the fact if it comes up later that the house doesn't match what the city has records of. That might happen if, e.g., you hire an actual electrician to do some work. That electrician may be obligated to have his work inspected. Inspector comes by, sees other major work he doesn't have record of..."
cableporn,3c9t29,mikemol,2,Mon Jul 6 13:20:51 2015 UTC,"Fair points, and I agree. But if you forsee an inspection for other work, it's easy to get a permit for the work you've already done (without telling them that it's done, obviously) and to get an electrician to sign off on it. At least where I am.  Is it kosher? No. But there's no rational argument for telling a homeowner they can't do what they damn well please with their house so long as it passes code. Work that passes code is no safer if done by a licensed electrician."
cableporn,3c9t29,ahugenerd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:36:13 2015 UTC,"Is it kosher? No. But there's no rational argument for telling a homeowner they can't do what they damn well please with their house so long as it passes code. Work that passes code is no safer if done by a licensed electrician.   I agree...but it's not really possible to know if it passes code without a second pair of eyes. Otherwise, mistakes can be missed, even if the first party had nothing but the est of intentions.  (Note: IANALE)  The reason for the inspection is to ensure that mistakes were not made and shortcuts not taken. Case in point: I had my electrical service upgraded and panel replaced a couple years ago by a licensed electrician. Inspector never came by. (Phone tag trying to schedule inspection, and he stopped calling.) Just yesterday, I replaced a breaker with a GFCI breaker (because of a grandfathered lack of grounding conductors...), and discovered a pigtail with a bunch of nicks in the insulation in the panel. If the breaker had been on, while I was moving wires around looking for a neutral I'd lost, I'd have been in for a nasty shock.  Sub to /r/electricians; every now and again, you'll see some burned up connection where a lug didn't get tightened down enough, the connection was bad, had a high resistance and flamed out. Or where a wire nick caused the same problem. And at the same time, it's possible to overtighten, causing the same problem..."
cableporn,3c9t29,mikemol,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:50:39 2015 UTC,"I am subbed to /r/electricians, have been for years now...  To be entirely fair, the assumption of the entire code system is that only one set of eyes is required to determine whether a system is up to code: the inspector's. They don't rely on you to tell them that you think it's up to code, and they generally start by assuming that it isn't. If an inspector can do it, you can to, so long as you're familiar with your local code (not hard to find a copy of the NEC or CEC, just walk in to any electrical supply store).  As for your panel issue: it's likely an inspector works have missed that. More importantly, you're unlikely to get zapped by a nicked neutral at the panel assuming you have a bonded ground-neutral system. That's because shortest/easiest path to ground for electricity would be through the few inches of wire to the panel, not through your body. Keep in mind that this only applies when directly at the panel, and only with nicks. Anywhere else and the length of the run to the panel vs through your body could tip the scales the other way."
cableporn,3c9t29,ahugenerd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:45:15 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a nicked neutral, it was a nicked hot. And the point is to have a second pair of eyes.  The foundational purpose of the code is to make it so that electricians and inspectors don't have to think; all the heavy lifting and planning and second-guessing and risk analysis is already done, codified in words and calculated tables. It's not to make it presumable that only one set of eyes is necessary; that would require the presumption that that one set of eyes is infallible, which is silly. That's why ""signed-of by"" is a common idiom."

Wiring is clean, and I'd be proud to have done work like that."

cableporn,3btxmr,rfleason,3,Thu Jul 2 19:55:53 2015 UTC,"You could need it in a worst case type situation. Stop and go traffic on a hot night; A/C running, headlights on, motor near idle, tunes cranked up, maybe you spray some wiper fluid to clean the windshield and roll the windows up to not get splashed... It can add up pretty quick."
cableporn,3btxmr,elephant7,5,Thu Jul 2 20:25:24 2015 UTC,"You don't actually want to run a cap if at all possible. The reason is that while they deliver high amperage very quickly, they also draw amperage very quickly.   This can take a serious toll on your charging system, and for most users, it's unnecessary. The most you'll need is a good battery. I'm pushing a 1,000 watt amp and subs in a sealed box in a Kia with nothing more than an Interstate battery."
cableporn,3btxmr,Caseycrowe,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:58:11 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard it taking ""a serious toll"" on an alternator, so do you mind providing source?  I have used power caps before, because they basically help you ride through the draw of a bass hit instead of drawing directly from your battery (last system was a pair of 300w max 12s on a 800w amp, 4-ohm impedance, traditional ported box). Off the top of my head, I think my old car's alternator was 75A, so it was a significant improvement.  I am considering doing a box for my '15 Forester, which has a 12v 130A alternator with a 12v 48AH battery. Honestly, with all of the electronics of today's vehicles (I have the Eyesight system as well as the 440w HK system, not to mention other features), I'd have to say that adding a power cap couldn't hurt, especially as my music of preference is electronica (house, dubstep, trance) and rock/metal."

As a test, go to a car with a capacitor, and hook an analog voltage meter across the + and - leads, and thump the bass. You'll see the needle swing wildly as voltage goes up and down. What you SHOULD be seeing instead is voltage staying pretty steady but current going up and down with hits. (You may see that too, but voltage will fluctuate more with a cap)"

cableporn,3btdpp,Newdles,7,Thu Jul 2 01:10:52 2015 UTC,"It would be an issue, except only the fiber'd switch is going to have any significant number of hosts on it at all. The rest are just there to make all the other unused jacks in the building ""hot"". I built this rack fully for future expansion. There are actually 4 OM3 pairs in the fiber patch panel at the bottom; just need some patch cables and mGBIC adapters if we ever need to make things really flow."
cableporn,3btdpp,Newdles,6,Thu Jul 2 01:19:58 2015 UTC,"You should at least build aggregates from your ""hot"" switches down to your primary switch with the fiber uplink. This way you aren't daisy chaining switches and causing STP to go to shit. Design it like a small MDF with a single switch core. Run 2 port LACP trunks to each other access switch in there (from the uplink switch) and you will eliminate your single point of failure (sans fiber pair, but since you have backup pairs there you could always spin one up. Best practice would be to light it up and make the fiber uplink an LACP aggregate as well)."
cableporn,3btdpp,Newdles,7,Thu Jul 2 02:35:02 2015 UTC,"That's good advice, thank you for that. Now that I look at it again, I feel a bit silly for not just running them all to MDF uplink switch. The whole building's network is an unused WiP, so I guess I could qualify my lack of foresight by saying it's not ""done-done"". But yeah, the daisy chain was a bad idea."
cableporn,3btdpp,addrockk,8,Thu Jul 2 03:02:27 2015 UTC,"No prob. You don't need to run them ""all back to the MDF"". It would be a tremendous improvement if you just ran them all to the single switch in the bottom of your picture in this particular IDF. Do them in pairs so if one uplink goes down, you have a backup :). Other than this advice, the cabling is nice :)"
cableporn,3btdpp,Newdles,2,Thu Jul 2 03:43:55 2015 UTC,how would linking switched like this cause STP issues? There were no loops...  Are you just worried about number of levels?
cableporn,3btdpp,Newdles,3,Thu Jul 2 10:58:43 2015 UTC,Yes. It's just not good design. If this is happening in the IDF then you have to assume it's also in the MDF before reaching here.

cableporn,3br78o,Shadax,8,Wed Jul 1 22:13:00 2015 UTC,"I just assumed. Especially in a 'small office' it's rarely worth the investment to run CAT6 or higher.  ""But future proofing!"" Sure, but it's still going to be quite some time before 10gb Ethernet adapters and switches are cost effective to put everywhere so most people are still doing Cat5e."
cableporn,3br78o,sm4k,3,Wed Jul 1 23:04:22 2015 UTC,It's like another $10 for 300 ft of cat 6 over cat 5?
cableporn,3br78o,TED_666,8,Thu Jul 2 00:11:50 2015 UTC,"Remember, plain CAT6 is only good for 37m at 10g; to get the full 100m, you need 6A, and that is much more expensive, not just in materials, but the extra labor to work with the stiff cable."
cableporn,3br78o,lumberjackadam,3,Thu Jul 2 01:04:20 2015 UTC,I thought they had abandoned trying to categorize anything beyond cat6 officially?
cableporn,3br78o,TED_666,5,Thu Jul 2 01:07:42 2015 UTC,"6a is structurally distinct from 5/5e/6.  It isn't STP, but the pairs are essentially woven around a central core of flexible material.  This is why 6a is so much thicker and stiffer than 5/5e/6.  My understanding is that 7 is STP, and is being explored for 40GbE, and 7a is STP wound around a core like 6a is, and is experimentally able to carry 100GbE on copper.  edit - this may make it clearer"

cableporn,3br78o,Jyggalag,3,Thu Jul 2 04:30:23 2015 UTC,"Depends a lot from where and what you're buying but Monoprice has Plenum Cat5e for $189 USD and Plenum Cat6 for $280. That's more like $25 extra per 300ft. If you're running it above drop ceiling (as most small offices wind up doing), Plenum is what you have to use.  I have no idea how big the office OP posted that in is, but it wouldn't surprise me if that's north of 20,000ft of cable. That's a $1,500 difference to get started. Probably a drop in the bucket when you're talking about an office build-out, but if you're going to get the same performance out of the cable for the next 5-10 years, why pay it?"
cableporn,3br78o,sm4k,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:05:44 2015 UTC,Because you can sell serious future proof-ness?   Might convince some people to pay more?
cableporn,3br78o,TED_666,3,Thu Jul 2 01:09:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to upsell someone on Cat6 just because I can make a buck. If you're my customer and I explain all this to you and I tell you 'my professional opinion is that it's a waste of your money' and you still say 'thanks but install Cat6 anyway' you'll get your Cat6 and I'll happily cash your check.  My point is simply that by the time 10gb connections are justified for reasons beyond 'the cost of the cable' you're fairly likely to have other business requirements impacting the cabling such as ""we're expanding and need to move the rack"" or maybe even the entire office is moving.  I didn't say it never makes sense, but 99% of the time where people are asking about it, it's not worth the cost difference."
cableporn,3br78o,sm4k,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:23:09 2015 UTC,"Yes I totally concur with you.   I just hate pulling cable and fiddling around in spaces, so to me it's always whatever minimizes my time in hell.  I look at the numbers of the cost of doing cat 6 now, versus having a new pull in five years time. Then I start being disgusted about being in the space again and think that really cat 6 is a better investment.   Especially when installed properly and considering the opportunity  cost."

Usually available in fairly large sizes (2-3"" is relatively common), you can frequently get ends that screw on and the threads are over 3/4"" deep so they can span drywall.  You can also get longer pipes to spam whole walls, but that usually requires the use of PVC glue.   These are also readily available at most hardware/home improvement/plumbing supply stores, which is convenient.  Unfortunately, you'd need to run all the cable through the pipe before you installed it, which doesn't really work in this case."

cableporn,3bnqp9,-twenty,2,Tue Jun 30 20:56:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, TIL. I thought I would be buying up used ATA 186's and rigging them up into Bogen amps for the rest of my life."
cableporn,3bnqp9,vb2014,4,Wed Jul 1 00:46:28 2015 UTC,Looks really nice how does it work?
cableporn,3bnqp9,narco113,3,Wed Jul 1 01:30:11 2015 UTC,"I'm also curious. I thought that with it being IP that the speakers would be PoE into switches around the building and that this backend piece would just have one data port to distribute to them. Never installed one before, so what's with all the wiring? I see you labeled some wire pairs and also some ethernet with injectors there but what is with all the ports on the two boxes and what do they do?"
cableporn,3bnqp9,moredustythandigital,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:37:27 2015 UTC,The entry stations and master/sub stations are Cat5e/Cat6. There's only one LAN connection that really just provides the option to connect multiple boxes over a network so that you can have an entry station ring a master/sub station at a remote location.
cableporn,3bnqp9,collegeatari,2,Wed Jul 1 10:34:06 2015 UTC,Aiphone IS ?  I have done a bunch of IS-IP stuff and recently an IX system.  Looks good.  Lot of money hanging on that wall.
cableporn,3bnqp9,collegeatari,3,Tue Jun 30 19:17:09 2015 UTC,"You got it. Haha to the left of it is about 20,000$ worth of access control stuff in the black boxes. Not nearly as pretty though."

cableporn,3bieqo,whitcwa,10,Mon Jun 29 14:04:52 2015 UTC,What's the difference between the white and purple 1855? What brand device is this?
cableporn,3bieqo,bigjash1977,8,Mon Jun 29 15:07:32 2015 UTC,No difference in performance. The purple was provided by another group. It's nice to know where the demarcation is. It is a Utah Scientific http://www.utahscientific.com/products/productPages/UT400%20Series%202/UT400-S2XL.php
cableporn,3bieqo,zackofalltrades,6,Mon Jun 29 15:17:01 2015 UTC,"This seems like an awful lot of eggs in one basket if you had issues with it.   I assume on the other side it has a bunch of replaceable line cards, backplanes, and power supplies?"
cableporn,3bieqo,SuperGeometric,5,Mon Jun 29 17:10:54 2015 UTC,Redundant power supplies are external to the router. The input and output cards have 12 video each. They can be fiber or coax. The backplane is not accessible without removing front and rear cards. It has been very reliable. Only a couple of bad cards in 5 years.
cableporn,3bieqo,SuperGeometric,2,Mon Jun 29 17:31:10 2015 UTC,Most of them do
cableporn,3bieqo,imagreatlistener,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:18:40 2015 UTC,"Very high-quality construction. Redundant power supplies and likely the controller card is also redundant. Ins and Outs are in groups of 8-16 (12 on this model as OP explains) to keep failures small. Set up to alert the engineers if there's a problem. 24/7 phone access to engineers at the manufacturers for support. Parts overnighted at a minimum (some broadcast companies keep parts supplies at Fedex or UPS airport depots so they can immediately be put on a plane and sent out.)  Really high-end facilities (ESPN, national networks, etc.) will run a fully redundant system with a second complete router (with all the same redundant components) that can be used as a fail-over. Plus, you can do critical functions (get program to air, etc.) using other means if it absolutely comes down to it, using patchbays or alternative systems.  But yeah, a failure of the router would not be a fun day."
cableporn,3bieqo,soundman1024,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:37:09 2015 UTC,I haven't heard of a fully redundant router. How do they switch over to the backup router? This one has 88 spare crosspoints which can be mapped in place of bad ones.
cableporn,3bieqo,Specken_zee_Doitch,2,Tue Jun 30 12:44:02 2015 UTC,"One day there was some power work scheduled so I made sure that the power supplies were all working and plugged into different circuits. Normally we used 4 circuits, but during the work only 2 were hot. The breakers and power strips were rated at 30A- we needed about 22A. All was well for about 15 minutes then the router died. It turns out that the power strips had two 15 A fuses inside. Each fuse fed half of the outlets, and we were using only one fuse so it melted. Now we use 8 circuits."
cableporn,3bieqo,soundman1024,0,Tue Jun 30 12:46:39 2015 UTC,I know in ESPN's new Digital Center 2 they have two routers (one IP one baseband) and they have an additional one of each for redundancy as well. I am not sure how they manage switching over to the redundant router though.
cableporn,3bieqo,soundman1024,10,Tue Jun 30 13:28:11 2015 UTC,"Oh, the bandwidth. Uungh."
cableporn,3bieqo,imagreatlistener,4,Mon Jun 29 14:37:50 2015 UTC,If it's 1.5Gbps 720p or 1080i it's 6Tbps in and 6Tbps out. Double that if it's a 3Gbpa 1080p60 room.
cableporn,3bieqo,soundman1024,3,Mon Jun 29 22:29:28 2015 UTC,On a 4k 12g SDI router it's be 4 times that. Not that such a thing exists.
cableporn,3bieqo,imagreatlistener,7,Tue Jun 30 00:18:19 2015 UTC,There isn't a 12g standard out there. Just Black Magic with some proprietary hardware.
cableporn,3bieqo,soundman1024,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:34:04 2015 UTC,"Evertz has a router which switches uncompressed HD over IP. They claim 46Tb/s bandwidth with up to 2304 10Ge ports - each carrying 6 HDSDI, or 3 3gHDSDI, or 4k or even 8k!"
cableporn,3bieqo,TitanTechie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:03:27 2015 UTC,"Uncompressed UHD doesn't fit in a 10gig signal, so I'm a bit confused here. Unless it t does compressed UHF? Either way a 46Tbps backplane is pretty awesome."

cableporn,3bieqo,talones,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:28:26 2015 UTC,"My assumption would be 1.5 Gbps for 1080i, I think that's more standard for broadcast facilities where a router like this would be used. But either way, Holy video streams Batman!"
cableporn,3bieqo,soundman1024,2,Tue Jun 30 17:27:17 2015 UTC,The think it's an age thing. The new installations I'm seeing more 3G-SDI than HD-SDI at this point. Changed somewhere around 18 months ago.
cableporn,3bieqo,L00kBehindYou,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:52:04 2015 UTC,Do they actually utilize the full capability of those connections? Are they aiming to broadcast higher frame rates or what?
cableporn,3bieqo,mister_magic,2,Tue Jun 30 18:17:53 2015 UTC,Some trucks are starting to send 3G back to the studio. Not sure what exactly master control is doing with it when it arrives. Probably recording 60p somewhere and then converting it to 30i for broadcast and studio shows. Trucks that are being built are almost almost all 3G ready.
cableporn,3bieqo,__spinlocos421,2,Tue Jun 30 18:26:26 2015 UTC,All of my trucks are full 3G and now 4K. We're running all RossVideo gear. Smaller router than this one (144x144) but it's still a sight to be seen.

cableporn,3bcv1b,Draco1200,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:06:26 2015 UTC,"Probably the biggest difference is that nLight is a distributed intelligence system. All the devices wired together in a ""zone"" (read - room) can communicate and make decisions without central control. E.g. a switch broadcasts a message on a channel, and all the relays tracking that channel know to turn on. The ""backbone"" devices that OP posted are used to allow communication between zones, for scheduling changes via a time clock, and to allow configuration/monitoring via software."

cableporn,3bcwxr,ejkofusa,3,Sun Jun 28 01:44:58 2015 UTC,It's because they each go to a different panel.

cableporn,3bcwxr,terroran,2,Sun Jun 28 18:38:02 2015 UTC,"Well it's for sure delta-wye, you can tell by how its wired. I'm assuming 480-120/208 by the colored tape. It's not a code to use those colors, it's by far the most common use of those colors. And 480-120/208 is an extremely common type of small dry-type transformers."

The D2 is a digital stage rack – a set of analog inputs and outputs connected to a ADC/digital interface. MADI and Dante are two different protocols to transfer digital signals between a digital stage rack and a digital mixer.  The biggest problem with the regular hifi audio cables, are that they are unbalanced (just a signal + ground pair) – that can cause a lot of noise problems in a PA-system."

cableporn,3b55ds,iDev247,2,Fri Jun 26 04:26:10 2015 UTC,"Assuming all the wires are stripped and in the panel, and the service terminations are done, I'd do a sloppy panel in about 50 minutes, a decent one in about an hour and fifteen minutes and this would probably take two hours or so."

Austin won't allow any work in the panel without a license, but since it's nearly impossible to get a permit in Austin anyway because the city's planning and development org sucks donkey dong, it's sort of ""eh whatever"" unless they catch you. Houston and most other localities don't give a crap.   Definitely call your local city or county building department to find out what the laws are. I used to live in Bryan, TX and the building department was so easy to work with that I actually enjoyed having the inspectors over because we got to nerd out about houses for a while."

cableporn,3b55ds,DancingPaul,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:50:00 2015 UTC,"Not entirely sure I understand what you're asking, but in laymans terms:  The insulation on the energized wire should be removed to allow the maximum amount of wire to touch the inside of the circuit breaker, but there should be no exposed bare wire.  The only bare wire you should be able to see is the ground wire."

It was the Linesmen who were courteous enough to provide the materials and teach me a few Bowline variations that are handy for pulling.  We also used pull-bars, tuggers, and even a zoom-boom for various pulls because of angle-of-attack and support issues for the rigging.

cableporn,3b1wra,ssheth,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:36:24 2015 UTC,"It also tends to cost a whole lot. Depending on the size of the board and the amount of cables of course. I have to built 2 HVAC control panels with wire labels on them in a couple of weeks. One is a rather small one, but the other one is a fairly big one. With almost 150 data points (if I remember correctly) alone. Than you've also got the power circuits, relais units and a few other parts. So I fairly wild estimate would be: 300 different wire tags (also note that often have to re-tag a cable if you put it in serie. The 24V and 230V lines for example are very silly, since they often sit very close next to eachother but still require a new tag. It costs about €800-1000 on material alone; since we need all the numbers; a couple of letters and the symbol "" - "". We use slightly more expensive ones, because they are a lot quicker to install and they look very clean. So you've got to calculate the extra hours that you need to label it up aswell in your price. I personally need about 1 to 2 hours per panel. So €500-750 is being calculated for just labeling the wires in a control panel.   PS. I hate this, but in the end it always looks really sweet."

If you have seen how they set up their data centers, all wiring done before hardware comes in, these are supposed to be long term jobs so what they do is fine.

cableporn,3axzfd,vi0cs,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:31:34 2015 UTC,"Gasp - only a cable once in a blue moon? I work as a network admin for a company and our branch locations have 0 wire management because they eff things up all the time. We rarely even replace a cable. We have new standards that have come in but when we dispatch a tech on site, they mess everything up. It's really shitty techs more than anything that cause issues."
cableporn,3axzfd,vi0cs,2,Thu Jun 25 04:40:04 2015 UTC,"In long-term environments where cables aren't replaced often, yeah zipties can work.  But if you add/remove/replace more than a few cables a week, they are absolutely not a good idea. I've seen the video, and it takes the tech 20 minutes to do what should be a 5 minute job.  I'm a datacenter tech, and I could have done that whole replacement in a quarter the time if the bundles were secured with velcro instead of zipties. Not to mention, the tech didn't use boots nor did he certify the cable to make sure it's terminated correctly and can handle the traffic you're going to use it for. (And no matter how good you are, you still sometimes swap a pair or discover a defective RJ-45 end).  Sure, it works for their specific environment, but that video is not some absolute end-all debate killer when it comes to cable management, especially in dynamic environments where cables need to be manipulated frequently."

cableporn,3asakn,ImprovementDept,67,Tue Jun 23 02:43:28 2015 UTC,"That has to be a power transmission line and not a comm line, right? I've seen some undersea fiber links, and they're a lot smaller - still with substantial power conductors for amps, but nothing near as big as this looks to be."
cableporn,3asakn,elkab0ng,74,Tue Jun 23 03:07:53 2015 UTC,"That's exactly right.  The 3 big copper circles in the middle are power transmission lines.  Those run some insanely high voltage/current power to power the re-amplifiers that are needed every few hundred (I think?) kilometers.  The outer silver-colored cables are steel armor.  Those are there to (1) support the weight of the cable itself as it's being lowered or raised (it's raised to repair breaks) and (2) protect the cable from boat anchor and/or sharks (or something).  That one small circle in the upper-left quadrant, that's the actual fiber.  There are probably hundreds of individual fibers in there.    Each fiber may be running a hundred or so individual channels, each on a different frequency of light (this is called DWDM).  It's crazy stuff."

cableporn,3asakn,whydna1,14,Tue Jun 23 06:00:36 2015 UTC,"This is just totally a guess, but I'm betting it's for when you're making repairs and have to cut into the cable. The yellow blobs are above the fiber bundle and the blue blobs aren't."

cableporn,3asakn,whydna1,5,Tue Jun 23 13:48:17 2015 UTC,DWDM   If I understand it correctly you would use single mode for an ocean cable because multimode fiber doesn't have the same kind of range. Which limits your bandwidth. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

cableporn,3asakn,whitcwa,2,Mon Jun 29 14:13:12 2015 UTC,You're right. Plus they use DWDM because it puts all the carriers closer together enabling the use of Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers which greatly simplify extending the range of fiber.

cableporn,3asakn,Ninja_Fox_,2,Sat Jun 27 12:16:42 2015 UTC,"Part of it is that the more fibers you have, the more amplifiers you need to put in the middle of the cable (amplification is needed every 100-120km).

cableporn,3ark9u,djpyro,9,Mon Jun 22 23:25:42 2015 UTC,Audio and video
cableporn,3ark9u,djpyro,4,Mon Jun 22 23:45:06 2015 UTC,"Awesome.  Quite organized for a live production.  I see the RS-232 panel on the video pic, is that for the pitching speed gun?  Is there a standard protocol?  I thought everything was over ethernet for that now at the park."
cableporn,3ark9u,machzel08,5,Tue Jun 23 02:31:18 2015 UTC,"I've honestly never had to deal with any of that, I used to be a utility and occasional camera operator, nowadays I do audio. I seem to recall that there is a reasonably standardized protocol that house scoreboard systems can use to drive the graphics in the truck, I imagine that it is probably based on RS-485 rather than 232 due to the distances it needs to run."
cableporn,3ark9u,machzel08,3,Tue Jun 23 02:47:50 2015 UTC,"I like the lone Axia node. Get out of there Axia, this is an analog truck silly."
cableporn,3ark9u,machzel08,3,Tue Jun 23 04:01:34 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what Axia is... But these trucks are all HD, the only analog signals in the panel will be audio and things like feeds for booth monitors."
cableporn,3ark9u,MightyMike_GG,3,Tue Jun 23 05:02:30 2015 UTC,Axia is the white 1RU unit above the Pitch Speed thing. It's used for digital audio. Since the audio on that truck is analog (based on the connections) I found it odd.
cableporn,3ark9u,goggimoggi,3,Tue Jun 23 06:53:02 2015 UTC,"The trucks on this show are running analog audio everywhere, but that doesn't mean that some other network doesn't use that box for something when they're at this stadium, or maybe it's an interface unit that takes analog audio from the trucks and sends it somewhere, or something."
cableporn,3ark9u,MightyMike_GG,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:56:10 2015 UTC,"Of course, it was just funny to see a single node. Normally there are a few dozen of those converting digital or doing some routing."

cableporn,3ark9u,Soccham,5,Tue Jun 23 00:04:33 2015 UTC,"And, in my limited experience, there are often times many contractors needing different configurations for different events. Mess is inevitable and acceptable."
cableporn,3ark9u,APKaudio,5,Tue Jun 23 00:22:14 2015 UTC,"Indeed. One day the local Fox Sports regional is going to have a home show and an away show, so we patch what those shows are using. One day ESPN might be in here and plugs in for their show. Today we have three separate broadcasters in here, with four trucks, all patching in for their shows and getting in each others' way. It all packs back up in the truck after the game is over and the truck drives away to its next show. The only time I would see more effort put into making things more ""permanent"" is when we have, say, an entire home stand being covered by one broadcaster and we know things are going to be in for a week."
cableporn,3ark9u,APKaudio,-3,Tue Jun 23 00:27:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about what it's like for sports events, but most, if not all events I work with(mostly live concerts or similar) have all wireing (Power, audio, lighting, video, data) neatly placed and identified. Makes for much easier debugging and avoids conflicts between different contractors."
cableporn,3ark9u,doncox9,5,Tue Jun 23 00:50:54 2015 UTC,"I do concert production myself, we try to keep it neat enough to troubleshoot but for the most part as long as the cable goes from a to b and you know which cable in the pile is the one you're looking for, what the pile looks like doesn't matter too much."

Ive seen panels where all you have to do is move the wires and the insulation cracks off because of excess heat.  Extremely dangerous for anyone working in the panel"

cableporn,3aibw7,bob_cheesey,2,Sat Jun 20 15:24:51 2015 UTC,"The nice thing about the management arms is that if you have 8 network cables, need to open a box, and DON'T have it, you usually have to disconnect all the cables. Maybe they're already labeled and you already have an up to date rack diagram that tells you which ports they go into. Maybe you gotta spend ten minutes labeling all the cables.   With the arms, it's a non-issue, even for someone who works for the DC and doesn't know my setup. It makes a lot of sense if you forsee having to work on the hardware yourself. Most people don't actually do that (if it breaks they put in a new one and send it back to Dell) and thus I don't think the arms are super useful for them."

cableporn,3a7ok4,the_djeb,3,Thu Jun 18 00:02:57 2015 UTC,ELI5?
cableporn,3a7ok4,ulthrant82,3,Thu Jun 18 14:42:05 2015 UTC,"Unifi is a line of networking products within the Ubiquiti brand. If you use a Unifi router, a Unifi switch, and Unifi access points, then you can configure everything from one interface. You don't have to configure each piece of equipment individually, and when you need to make a change it will make the appropriate changes across all pieces of equipment at the same time. The configuration options can be somewhat limited compared to their Edge line or other brands, but they are going for ease of installation by allowing the most common installation options to be ""Unifi""ed in one GUI for an entire system. Sorry if that's more EL10"
cableporn,3a7ok4,ulthrant82,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:56:06 2015 UTC,"Nope that was perfect, thank you. What would be the benefit of getting a Unifi router, switch and access point over an all in one unit, such as most wireless routers?"
cableporn,3a7ok4,zerophaze,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:21:16 2015 UTC,Performance mostly. Also this style of system is easier to grow. You can add a second or third AP at any time. It's doable but harder with the all in one units.
cableporn,3a7ok4,godlycow78,2,Thu Jun 18 18:45:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, basically this. Specialized hardware gives you a lot more flexibility, performance, and scalability. Usually the more one piece of equipment does, the poorer its performance on any given task. It's the same way with AV equipment, you're much better off buying separate speakers, a subwoofer, an AV receiver, and a Blu Ray player than one of those all-in-one units. That way if any given piece shits the bed, or you want to upgrade, you're not changing everything."

Their hardware is great and if there's anything it can't do, much of their hardware is supported by OpenWRT/CommotionWireless and through that, with some fancy footwork, you can get them to do just about anything your heart desires. If you don't mind me asking, what's a run-down of your hardware/software? I've been trying to work on a centralized media/automation rack and I frankly don't even know where to begin. Great setup!"

cableporn,3a4n6h,bfut,73,Wed Jun 17 04:54:47 2015 UTC,It's pretty but wouldn't the beer get warm in all that exposed piping? Draft is usually in chilled lines until basically the point of distribution.
cableporn,3a4n6h,death_hawk,86,Wed Jun 17 05:46:17 2015 UTC,"Yup, that would be warm beer you'd be drinking unless a certain tap is pouring constantly. This looks more decorative I think the actually lines coming into the tap are on the other side of the wall."
cableporn,3a4n6h,randomizinah,35,Wed Jun 17 06:00:35 2015 UTC,I'm inclined to agree. Actually pushing beer through all that copper would be a nightmare.
cableporn,3a4n6h,munche,37,Wed Jun 17 07:36:24 2015 UTC,Plus purging the lines to sanitize them would waste a lot of beer. Our distributor says we should purge them every night... it almost seems like he wants to sell us more beer.
cableporn,3a4n6h,certnneed,30,Wed Jun 17 10:46:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, he does want to sell more beer, and so should you.   Dirty lines make beer taste bad, and it makes me buy less of it.   If it makes it easier, you can skip cleaning the Miller and budwieser lines."
cableporn,3a4n6h,DaveIsLame2,5,Wed Jun 17 16:55:34 2015 UTC,That's why we've only got a 1m pipe on the kegs. Less waste when we clean the lines at night. C'mon over and I'll buy you a beer!

cableporn,3a4n6h,GldRush98,9,Wed Jun 17 19:14:15 2015 UTC,"Purging a line with co2 doesn't sanitize it.  It will help prevent beer stone from developing, but there is no sanitizing going on."
cableporn,3a4n6h,WIBeerFan,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:21:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I misspoke. We purge them with water every night, run a sponge through the lines once a week, and they do a full sanitize once a year during our maintenance check."
cableporn,3a4n6h,certnneed,2,Thu Jun 18 01:42:06 2015 UTC,"That is WAY overkill and a waste of beer. Yes clean lines make a difference and should be kept clean for sanitary reasons, but most distributors and commercial line cleaners recommend every 1-2 weeks.   Our distributors actually pay a local company to clean all lines for free to the customer (they'll come as often as you like, but even the cleaning company agrees with this timeframe)"
cableporn,3a4n6h,Mbgt72,4,Thu Jun 18 03:34:11 2015 UTC,That is a lot of expensive copper just for decoration. But you are right it would be warm beer.

cableporn,3a4n6h,WIBeerFan,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:24:44 2015 UTC,I can confirm it is decorative.  Those style beer faucets have the shank on the back.  In this case it goes through the wall into their cold room.

Draft beer* just comes from the cellar as is, hopefully around 14oC, but plenty of craft beers will be served from a barrel on the bar so this isn't much of an issue.  But I agree with randomizinah; I've seen this done before in microbreweries and the beer didn't come through the copper.  *real ale, ipa, stout, etc - everything us Brits call beer (flat, uncooled, not lager)"

Not that I can't do cli stuff, but if I mainly just need to easily make 3 subnets, 3 SSIDs, configure POE type (these switches do passive and 48v), and configure multiple access points from one interface, it's pretty awesome. I have one of the edge switches coming for another install so I'm interested to see how they compare"

cableporn,3a1c2o,InterloperKO,3,Tue Jun 16 19:51:09 2015 UTC,"I don't have a switch, but I do have a UniFi Secure Gateway.  It is the ""same hardware"" as their EdgeRouter, so I assume the UniFi switch is the same as the EdgeSwitch.  It doesn't have a native web interface for configuration, instead relying on the Unifi Controller for all configuration.  (You can configure the Secure Gateway through the command line interface, as you can the Edge products, but the configuration gets overwritten without some hackery.)  The only things you can configure on the Secure Gateway are port forwarding and DDNS.  My Asus AC68 with Merlin firmware can do a LOT more than the Secure Gateway (IPv6, OpenVPN), but I can't see everything in a single interface as I can with my UniFi APs and gateway.  As the gateway matures,  I may migrate over to it as my primary router.  In the mean time, and with its limited capabilities today, I'm still planning on deploying it in a couple locations where I'm turning up Internet access, using the USG and a few UniFi APs.  Nothing fancy is needed and it makes my job of monitoring the status a lot easier."

Raspberry Pi's and the like are fine for people are reasonably tech savvy, but for people who don't have tech experience that goes much beyond using an iPhone, Sonos is great. There are also some features that just aren't easily duplicated in the distros that are based on squeezebox, one of the main things being grouping of multiple different rooms. In an installation that is 10s of thousands of dollars, a couple hundred extra dollars for the Sonos stuff is well worth it. A lot of times the Sonos app is intuitive enough for our customers that we don't even need to train them. As soon as someone makes a comparable option for the Pi, I will gleefully full racks with them."

cableporn,39xjf7,thekush,16,Mon Jun 15 18:23:20 2015 UTC,Yeah but in 1998 the OC12 and battery/rectifier plant would take up an entire 7ft rack instead of being able to mount it on a wall.

cableporn,39xjf7,munche,6,Tue Jun 16 04:12:29 2015 UTC,This is what the telecom wall in one of my sites looks like and it makes my heart sad. Especially since we switched our uplinks to fiber so a large chunk of the T1/DS3 stuff is useless now.

cableporn,39xjf7,MrSids,10,Mon Jun 15 20:44:44 2015 UTC,I prefer to screw in the black cable tie mounts so I pretty much never rely on the adhesive. It makes the zip ties a little more difficult to insert but I know for sure these will still be up years from now when I revisit the site. This project entailed installing a Flashwave 4100 optical transport shelf (seen on the left) to pick up the OC12 feed and convert it down to DS3 for the customer. Coax cable is then run to a DS3 handoff (seen mounted on the top right). I also installed the 48v rectifier (the gray box top center). It sure is nice to have this much space to work with for a change!
cableporn,39xjf7,pinkprofit,2,Tue Jun 16 02:02:40 2015 UTC,Did you bring a pre terminated coax or terminate on site?  On a board like this I personally wouldnt have left a big loop like that.  Kinda takes up a lot of real estate that the next guy could have used imo

cableporn,39u5mg,Tananar,4,Mon Jun 15 03:20:44 2015 UTC,"Because this is a Cisco 6509 switch chassis.

cableporn,39u5mg,f0urtyfive,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:24:12 2015 UTC,This only works if you are doing 1:1 port activation. I work in an environment where we change ports somewhat frequently and over cable for growth. Activating every port on the panel would triple the switch port density needed. Plus I greatly prefer to use chassis switches at the access layer vs 1U switches.

Could join the panels together with chases, stub up with EMT, label the doors further down off the jacket with a label maker. Helps trouble shooting later if you don't have to cut out a bunch of zip ties to chase out wires."
cableporn,39d0rl,machovanrandysavage,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:15:19 2015 UTC,"I normally don't wire panels with so many zip ties.  It definitely creates a bit of a pain in the ass when it comes to servicing later on, however, these ICT panels have terrible cable management and it's kind of a necessity to make them look nice.  It is a bigger service issue to have them mostly unstrapped when you have: lvt, station-z, 6c shielded, cat5e, rs-485, etc all in the same can.  They don't hold shape well together and end up being sloppy and difficult to determine what is what, keep general can tidyiess, etc.  EMT is not required by code so it isn't done.  Power supply and left can, while from the same manufacturer, don't have knockouts that line up (can you say poor engineering?)  This is a full out install from front to back of a brand new building, so additions aren't going to happen.  Service is likely many, many years away as we piped everything below ~15 feet that is exposed in the warehouse and office front.  This is just one of many panels I do regularly as demonstration, not really a show panel by any means.  Next time I do ULC work where EMT and the like is required I'll post it.  I actually just got a contract for 20 door access control and 48 alarm zones, so that should be a good one:)."

cableporn,3983ic,wartzilla,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:12:42 2015 UTC,"Harmonic distortion affects the entire grid a device is connected to, so the smaller the grid, the bigger the issue.

cableporn,3983ic,soulstonedomg,2,Wed Jun 10 13:45:51 2015 UTC,"Variable frequency drive would be overkill for just startup. The goal of a VFD is complete speed control throughout the operation of the motor. A soft starter is much more economical when you only need to throttle the startup.  So if you were starting up a crane, you would have a soft starter, but if you were operating an azimuth thruster on a ship you would have a VFD."

cableporn,3983ic,soulstonedomg,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:02:55 2015 UTC,Depends on the size of the motor and application. I do electrical design for marine industrial and most crane motors on a platform are around 400 hp and only require soft start.

cableporn,3983ic,autowikibot,3,Tue Jun 9 23:32:49 2015 UTC,"Motor soft starter:       A motor soft starter is a device used with AC electrical motors to temporarily reduce the load and torque in the power train and electrical current surge of the motor during start-up. This reduces the mechanical stress on the motor and shaft, as well as the electrodynamic stresses on the attached power cables and electrical distribution network, extending the lifespan of the system.   It can consist of mechanical or electrical devices, or a combination of both. Mechanical soft starters include clutches and several types of couplings using a fluid, magnetic forces, or steel shot to transmit torque, similar to other forms of torque limiter. Electrical soft starters can be any control system that reduces the torque by temporarily reducing the voltage or current input, or a device that temporarily alters how the motor is connected in the electric circuit.  Across-the line starting of induction motors is accompanied by inrush currents up to 7 times higher than running current, and starting torque up to 3 times higher than running torque. The increased torque results in sudden mechanical stress on the machine which leads to a reduced service life. Moreover, the high inrush current stresses the power supply, which may lead to voltage dips. As a result, the operability of sensitive consumers may be impaired.

cableporn,38wrnd,theskafather,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:39:21 2015 UTC,I am guessing we have come across each others comments :)
cableporn,38r3r9,asoBerNewt,3,Sat Jun 6 02:31:49 2015 UTC,Vintage! I like the hand sown wax string.
cableporn,38r3r9,CrazyAlice,2,Sat Jun 6 13:32:44 2015 UTC,"Why? TS/TRS has the same number of analogue connections. XLR patchbays are just huge, and expensive. unless this is for a wall panel to allow signal flow between studio rooms"
cableporn,38r3r9,JaredMason,11,Sat Jun 6 11:57:28 2015 UTC,"Believe  it or not, XLRs are still the de-facto connector in the theater industry. They're used on everything, because they provide balanced audio that never pops, in an incredibly reliable and durable connector (no way for them to get pins bent, or stuff shoved in the female connector.  Patch panels like this are often found on sound booth walls to patch from the stage inputs (with similar boxes) to a sound board, or the other way around."
cableporn,38r3r9,magmapus,8,Sat Jun 6 16:31:43 2015 UTC,I built an xlr patch bay for a live venue that does allot of quick patches on the fly. One plus is that If someone forgets to mute a channel and you have phantom power going through the line it won't pop like a TRS connector.
cableporn,38r3r9,TCRevolt,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:57:06 2015 UTC,"Usually it's TT if you want 96+ connections on a usual rack space (with less wear than trs) , with fat serial cables connecting in the back, one of which that might be the old fashioned printer cable (DB25)."
cableporn,38r3r9,SarcasticOptimist,-9,Sat Jun 6 13:15:32 2015 UTC,"I usually associate TRS connectors with unbalanced, stereo audio ins and outs. XLRs are unbalanced, single channel ins/outs."
cableporn,38r3r9,CrazyAlice,8,Sat Jun 6 13:35:41 2015 UTC,"XLR is balanced by nature, unless it's wired improperly."
cableporn,38r3r9,toasterinBflat,-4,Sat Jun 6 16:11:17 2015 UTC,"Right, and a TRS is usually used for stereo connections, or balanced on cheap ass gear."
cableporn,38r3r9,CrazyAlice,4,Sat Jun 6 17:07:19 2015 UTC,There is plenty of pro gear with balanced trs connectors. Hell most audio interfaces connect to monitors with trs.
cableporn,38r3r9,Binaryshadow32,-5,Sat Jun 6 17:28:05 2015 UTC,"Negative, the 1/4"" plugs that you're speaking of are speaker cables, those aren't balanced.  Most pro gear uses an NL4 connector or likewise."
cableporn,38r3r9,CrazyAlice,4,Sat Jun 6 17:57:23 2015 UTC,That's not even remotely true. It's not speaker cable for standard active monitors they're just trs cables
cableporn,38r3r9,Binaryshadow32,-3,Sat Jun 6 18:57:18 2015 UTC,"There may be tip, ring, and sleeve but you're running an unbalanced signal to them so you're only really using tip any sleeve. Bonus points if you can tell me the difference between ""cold"" and ""ground"" in ""your"" circuit."
cableporn,38r3r9,CrazyAlice,4,Sat Jun 6 21:07:04 2015 UTC,"No, TRS 1/8"" is usually a stereo connection. TRS 1/4"" is generally used for balanced line-level signals. Generally cheaper gear is using 1/4"" TS cable which is inherently unbalanced."
cableporn,38r3r9,soph0nax,-5,Sat Jun 6 17:27:47 2015 UTC,"I have about 3 pairs of headphones with 1/4"" TRS plugs."
cableporn,38r3r9,CrazyAlice,-1,Sat Jun 6 17:53:44 2015 UTC,"Professional audio equipment usually have both a trs and xlr i/o. Unless it has multiple channels to carry, then something like a db25 or similar multipin is used."
cableporn,38r3r9,TCRevolt,-1,Sat Jun 6 18:38:22 2015 UTC,"Now, if you said that you preferred XLR connections on a studio monitor because it combats interference better than unbalanced, or it locks in place, or some other reason then I'd agree with you... and if you said that you'd use a bi amped speaker and NL4 connection because your monitors have a build in cross over then I'd agree that you knew your ship... but you didn't give any reason, so I'm questioning your expertise."
cableporn,38r3r9,CrazyAlice,2,Sat Jun 6 21:39:38 2015 UTC,"Heh, getting on the defense. If you only encounter trs balanced outs on ""cheap ass gear"" then I'm questioning your expertise. Clearly in different fields."
cableporn,38r3r9,TCRevolt,4,Sat Jun 6 22:09:51 2015 UTC,"TRS cable is balanced, TS is not."
cableporn,38r3r9,quitepossiblylying,-3,Sat Jun 6 15:43:03 2015 UTC,"Not if the TRS is wired for stereo, look at a headphone jack, bro."
cableporn,38r3r9,CrazyAlice,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:59:14 2015 UTC,Headphone jack is dual unbalanced. Trs connectors in general are balanced. The only other time I generally think of a trs connector being unbalanced is if it's being used for an insert cable. Believe or not a connector can serve multiple purposes.
cableporn,38r3r9,TCRevolt,0,Sat Jun 6 18:34:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, clearly I know. We're saying the same thing."
cableporn,38r3r9,CrazyAlice,0,Sat Jun 6 18:41:35 2015 UTC,"We call ""dual unbalanced"" stereo where I come from."

cableporn,38aevf,JaakkoRuskea,3,Wed Jun 3 05:55:35 2015 UTC,You are correct the full load for this panel is 16.1 amps.. Requiring only 12awg wire
cableporn,38aevf,framerotblues,3,Wed Jun 3 14:22:14 2015 UTC,Dude your comment makes no sense. The weird thing is that sizing by the look of the compenents they are rated >100A.
cableporn,38aevf,JaakkoRuskea,6,Wed Jun 3 08:57:08 2015 UTC,"You can't judge a book by its cover, and you can't judge a circuit breaker's thermal load rating by its size. The branch breakers for each motor circuit could have a 10 amp trip rating (motor rated, will not trip under high inrush current)  but a 100,000 AIC rating, which gives them their physical size.   I can also tell you that by the size of the Schneider contactors and overloads at the bottom of the panel that he is not expecting to switch any more than 20 amps.   Now, let's explain wire diameters. You should know that mathematically, power is the product of voltage multiplied by amperage. The unit of measurement for power is watts. Horsepower and kilowatts are directly related; 1 horsepower is equivalent to 746 watts. Good so far?   If I am trying to power a 5 horsepower motor, I know that it will draw a little more than  (5 x 746) watts. If I take that product and divide it by different voltages, I can determine how many amps it will draw at those voltages. (There is a factor involved for single phase vs. three phase but I'm keeping this simple.)   3730W / 200V = 18.65A 3730W / 480V = 7.77A  Allowable amp draws for cross section of wire are set by the NFPA in the most current version of the NEC here in the US. There are ampacity tables calling out a conductor's jacket and temperature rating vs. its cross sectional size, and that determines the amperage that conductor can safely carry. (Below 600 volts, which is considered low voltage. Anything above that has its own separate rules.) This is based on the conductor resistance, the heat generated from that resistance, and the ability of that conductor to safely carry amperage while hot.   http://www.cerrowire.com/ampacity-charts  From the table shown, we know that we are drawing no more than 19 amps based on our calculations above, therefore we can safely use 12 gauge conductors (or larger if we so desire) in any temperature rating or stranding configuration.   There's your lesson in why 12 gauge wires are fine for this application."

Given the shine, it's also probably leaded solder.  The board in the last picture is scorched from trying to heat to attach the green and purple wires, or has flux residue that should've been cleaned off.  The leads on the passives are poorly and inconsistently bent in the last picture (R17's leads are even bent back on themselves). They're inconsistently placed, and the board is poorly laid out.  Overall, I wouldn't let this past QA, and whomever soldered it needs to be retrained and given proper equipment to use."
cableporn,383we2,swiftimundo,15,Tue Jun 2 00:21:48 2015 UTC,"Actually... the way the leads on R17 are bent is so the resistor doesn't pull itself apart when it's affected by intense temperature differences. There will probably be a lot of current going through that little resistor. It's an easy way to make sure the leads don't damage the component.   I dont know what the technique is called in English, but you often see the same bendy leads done on glass components such as diodes, and ceramic capacitors.  And like you say, the leads on all the ""flat"" components are too tight. You could easily damage any of those other resistors when they cool down after soldering them. Remember that metal contracts when cooled down, and this means that it will ""pull"" the component down towards the PCB, and if there is no leeway, it might pull the component apart. Especially resistors.  I've worked as en electromechanical engineer in my ""younger"" days, and just like you say... that PCB would never pass inspection.

cableporn,37z0l0,Sn0zzberries,9,Sun May 31 17:01:37 2015 UTC,"It's really less of a need but one thing is that your phone rebooting won't cause a data interruption and you don't have to worry about data starvation or jitter with separate lines.  Though most installs just give two drops to the same switch, nothing different and then have the voice vlan configured so that the phone will identify the correct vlan to hop on via LLDP or CDP.  Separate lines like this does present well to higher paid opinions and clients if you need to show off however.  Lots of reasons but at the end of the day it doesn't really matter."
cableporn,37z0l0,cerealcable,3,Sun May 31 19:29:16 2015 UTC,"FWIW at least on most Cisco phones, resetting/restarting the phone doesn't kill the passthrough port."

It's quite common to hear people using a variety of phones and I don't immediately think they're using Cisco anymore. Polycom really made a lot of headway and there are tons of cheaper options.

cableporn,37z0l0,WorldSailorToo,3,Sun May 31 21:43:42 2015 UTC,Best practices call for a mesh topology   Actually
cableporn,37z0l0,blufr0g,3,Sun May 31 22:35:03 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware of that.  This summarizes my understanding of mesh topology. In a commercial setting, what are its advantages?"
cableporn,37z0l0,WorldSailorToo,2,Sun May 31 22:48:59 2015 UTC,"From your link   Conclusion  The mesh topology is very handy and practical in the world today. Considering that information is flowing in every direction from an innumerable amount of sources, the mesh topology provides a layout that makes it much easier for this constant flow of data.   IMHO I like to imagine it to be like a star topology with a circle drawn around the exterior points (but the more redundant paths the better) so that all network components and end nodes have multiple transmission routes so should one path fail or their is a bandwidth overload their are many options for routing traffic. May require more administrator monitoring (tons of tools out there to do most of the work for you) but the end goal of having 100% network uptime is far more sustainable."
cableporn,37z0l0,blufr0g,3,Mon Jun 1 00:32:30 2015 UTC,Also from that same link   Disadvantages  Highly expensive  The layout of a mesh topology requires constant supervision and is very expensive to implement. However once implemented a mesh topology can bring back a lot of the lost revenue.  High maintenance  Mesh topologies are very hard to maintain and manage. They require constant supervision due to redundancies and failures in the network. However a capable team of administrators can manage a mesh topology without too much of a hassle   I must work with much smaller businesses than you do.
cableporn,37z0l0,WorldSailorToo,2,Mon Jun 1 02:42:51 2015 UTC,It costs more cable. The rest depends on configuring your routers and switches correctly and using decent network monitoring tools of which many are open source and or freeware.

cableporn,37qvv8,cnrtechhead,11,Fri May 29 18:27:37 2015 UTC,So much for shielding.
cableporn,37qvv8,xeon65,2,Fri May 29 18:53:42 2015 UTC,I don't understand what you mean?   Each of the thicker wires in the cable is actually a shielded single pair of wires.
cableporn,37qvv8,Dmelvin,3,Fri May 29 19:12:37 2015 UTC,"What I mean is you have to strip the outside casing to punch the individual wires down to the block.  Yes, you still have a ground wire, but you've lost the shielding around the wires.  In my experience, this introduces some noise into the audio signal."
cableporn,37qvv8,xeon65,11,Fri May 29 19:17:05 2015 UTC,Three words. Common. Mode. Rejection.
cableporn,37qvv8,cantsleepclownswillg,12,Fri May 29 20:55:31 2015 UTC,"That's not how 66 blocks work.   You don't strip the wire off at all.  When you punch down to a 66 block, there are ""knives"" that cut into the outer casing, and the top is cut off flush with the top of the punch-down.   Or are you talking about the aluminum shielding that has to be removed?"
cableporn,37qvv8,Dmelvin,6,Fri May 29 19:43:36 2015 UTC,"Yea, the outside foil shielding"
cableporn,37qvv8,xeon65,3,Fri May 29 19:47:26 2015 UTC,Agreed then.    I can't really think of any kind of termination that can handle this many connections in such a small space without pulling back the sheathing shielding at least a little bit though.
cableporn,37qvv8,Dmelvin,5,Fri May 29 20:21:41 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the punching technique, the wires have lost their symmetry (if they are using a balanced signal) so it introduces interference that can't be removed via swapping the polarity in a normal balanced system."
cableporn,37qvv8,GrayBoltWolf,2,Fri May 29 20:22:07 2015 UTC,Have you ever punched down a 66?  what does the drain connect to? 66 is meant for solid core cat3. Anything else doesn't punch down very well.
cableporn,37qvv8,mattfromtelevision,5,Fri May 29 20:13:58 2015 UTC,About once a month I'm punching down something on a 66.  I've punched down stranded wire just as easily as I have 24 gauge solid CAT5e.  Occasionally if the block is worn out you have to squeeze it back together a bit with a pair of needle nose before punching down.    This stuff is 22 gauge in the picture.  Should connect solidly to the 66.  Worst case is cut the wire off just a bit longer and use the blunt end to punch it down.
cableporn,37qvv8,Dmelvin,2,Fri May 29 20:20:48 2015 UTC,"Why stranded, it usually shreds and leaves you with additional issues. I pray to god you don't extend pots service using stranded cable punched to 66 block handoffs"
cableporn,37qvv8,Spartan5150,2,Sat May 30 11:40:36 2015 UTC,"The customer ran their own cable, and I don't have the authority to tell the customer that I won't use it.   I suppose in retrospect I could have scotchloc'd solid core to it and punched that down, but I don't know if I could have done that without causing a messy splice point."
cableporn,37qvv8,Dmelvin,4,Sat May 30 17:02:20 2015 UTC,We use those all of the time for audio.  It works fine for balanced signals as long as you don't have interference sources right next to the block.

cableporn,37qvv8,brokenarrow,2,Fri May 29 20:31:29 2015 UTC,Yeah the 25 pair I knew.  The other cable was new to me.  I have not seen an application where 66 blocks are used other than phone.  Learn something knew every day.
cableporn,37qvv8,ffatr2012,2,Fri May 29 21:04:39 2015 UTC,What's going to be sad is if they ever have to troubleshoot that 25pair with no service loop/extra cable tucked away.
cableporn,37qvv8,Spartan5150,13,Sat May 30 11:43:49 2015 UTC,"Okay, so everyone complaining about the noise introduction and loss of shield should take a moment to think about how twisted pair works.  For networking, twisted pair is two wires with a balanced signal carried on them- the signal on one wire is the opposite of the one on the other wire. The twist means any noise introduced is introduced equally to the signal and to the inverse of the signal; so when they're combined in an op-amp or differentiator, you only get the signal, not the noise.  Now- think about how tight the twist has to be on cat6 or cat7 for 1gigabit or 10gigabit Ethernet. Very, because you're carrying 350mhz+ of signal on that wire; the small size of the wavelength means larger twists will let noise in.  Then think about cat5 that carries 100baseT. The pairs only carry 100mhz signals, and the twists are looser, and the termination requirements aren't as strict.  Think about the cat3 that carries 10baseT, running at 10MHz; you can really be loose with the twists and terminations. In fact you can even use a punch down block to splice cat3.  Phone signals are even lower, maxing out at around 8-10kHz. Those work on crappy ancient barely-twisted pair, running for miles along the street and parallel to power lines, punched down on whole cabinets of 66-block.  So audio signals at a radio station, which do extend up to 16 or 20kHz, will do just fine on these 66 blocks. If you care enough about the shield you can connect it to a third punch down terminal, but if these are balanced signals, the shield is just insurance.  *edit forgot to call out 10baseT as 10MHz."

cableporn,37nj9o,bazilbt,4,Fri May 29 00:38:21 2015 UTC,"Not answering your question, but the “little copper tubes” are hard line — coaxial cable built with a solid metal shield instead of flexible braid.  (The big copper tubing in the last picture looks like it's a waveguide, which is another way to put RF down a metal tube — it's completely hollow instead of containing a dielectric supporting a “co-axial” center conductor. Waveguides have superior performance to coaxial cable, but must be of a width similar to the wavelength of the signal, making them impractically large at lower frequencies, and significantly bigger and heavier than coax even where they are used.)"

cableporn,377plj,loogie97,1 point,Mon May 25 17:41:24 2015 UTC,Some quick reasoning. http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/tip/Chassis-or-stackable  3850 switches have a limit of 9 (at a certain code level) but after 4 it's generally better practice to move to chassis. (For cost/TCO/features/horsepower).
cableporn,377plj,BaseRape,13,Mon May 25 17:49:49 2015 UTC,Give us your email to read the article   How about no
cableporn,377plj,douchecanoo,4,Mon May 25 19:34:16 2015 UTC,"The basic query was 'should I use stackable switches or chassis-based switches?' As was pointed out in the question, stacking several 24 or 48 port switches together is usually much cheaper than putting the same number of 24 or 48 port blades in a chassis, but the chassis offer better management.  What's interesting about this, is that almost all switch manufacturers make switches in both configurations. Perhaps they recognize that both have appropriate niches in the networking world, or perhaps they recognize that the question has turned into a religious issue, with a polarized administrator base that reminds me of a certain beer commercial. I can just hear the pro-chassis camp screaming ""Tastes great!"" and the pro-stackable camp responding ""Less filling!""  But how does one decide which is more appropriate for their network? I believe the answer lies in recognizing the advantages of the chassis, then deciding whether any of those features are useful in your situation, and if so, are they worth the extra cost?  Chassis-based solutions can generally do everything their stackable cousins can do, plus they have the following advantages:  Easy redundancy: external redundant power supply solutions are available for stackables, but more common for chassis. Redundant supervisor blades are also common in chassis, but I don't usually recommend them. I hear of line cards failing almost weekly, but in 15 yrs of networking, I can't remember ever hearing of a supervisor failure. Flexibility: it is easier to move ports around to different VLANs, span or mirror ports, and it's easier to upgrade or replace components in a modular chassis. Performance: stackable solutions are generally limited to 1 or 2 gigabits in and out of each switch. Theoretically, twenty-four 100Mb Ethernet ports would be capable of 2400Mb/s, and it's twice as bad at 4800Mb/s for a 48 port blade. Is this a problem? Rarely, if ever. However, chassis solutions use proprietary backplanes that can be much, much faster than the standards-based Ethernet protocol. (Some stacks (e.g. Nortel's 450T) do use a proprietary backplane.)  Features: chassis switches often support more queues and thresholds per port, so QoS is much more granular. As new features come out, upgrading your supervisor module is a whole lot less expensive than upgrading all your ports.  When you have to do emergency or routine code upgrades and patches, it's a lot easier to do it once, than once for each of 8 switches in a stack. Fewer electrical outlets are required and cabling solutions are more aesthetically appealing. Fewer IP addresses are required for management. Rack space is also saved. This isn't too important in most wiring closets, but in a datacenter, where floorspace is often more expensive than the equipment, it can be a major factor.  Many other components are being integrated into chassis. For instance, in Cisco's 6500 chassis, you can put VoIP Gateway blades, the super-fast Firewall Services module, intrusion detection and other blades.  So as you can see, the answer usually revolves around cost, as always, but cost can be a little more complex than it appears. Consider the ""Total Cost of Ownership"", including things like the potential labor savings from reduced management, and the extended useful life gained by upgrading components, instead of just the purchase price and the chassis becomes much easier to justify."

cableporn,377plj,Justinsaccount,2,Mon May 25 21:34:03 2015 UTC,"That was my first thought. I haven't worked in networking since 2009 but I remember the 3750's we bought had interconnects that were north of 16gbs. Combine that with the 10gb uplinks to the MDF, it begins to compete with the modular switches. All of the 45xx switches we racked did have 2 power supplies though."

cableporn,377plj,douchecanoo,0,Mon May 25 20:57:45 2015 UTC,"The only real benefit to a chassis nowadays is that they are slightly more simple to manage, and for a price can provide very high levels of redundancy. In the access layer I'm simply not seeing chassis' being used any more, while they still have an important role to play in the core/aggregation layer.  It's still cheaper to stack, you get better port density, stacking configuration is simple, you can get redundant power supplies (and Stack-Power!), loss of a single switch won't bring down the entire stack (compared to loss of a Sup card bringing down a chassis).  I'd personally only use a chassis if I had a requirement for something other than 1000BASE-T ports - eg. lots of SFP/SFP+ or QSFP. But I really don't get to play at that level much :("

cableporn,379ixg,DelphFox,4,Tue May 26 01:19:04 2015 UTC,"Why do you think velcro is faster?   I started off using velcro several years ago for cable management but over time I found their tendency to snag on and stick to other velcro strips to be a major hassle. Eventually I switched to using zip ties almost exclusively and have found them faster and less frustrating. Granted, I've never done cable management in the kind of environment shown in the video, so perhaps there are subtleties I'm missing.   Any good videos of someone doing a similar task with velcro?"
cableporn,379ixg,tomedunn,4,Tue May 26 07:54:55 2015 UTC,"Make sure the fuzzy side is facing out, and the hook side is towards the cables. No snag, no hassle.  At my old datacenter, we used velcro for everything, and it made life much easier. We were managed colo though, so we had machines constantly being added, moved, and recabled. Zip ties would have been an absolute nightmare, especially when you're working quickly or having to trace cables for clients.  Velcro does just as good of a job, is easier to work around, and reusable. There's very few situations in which a zip-tie would be preferable to velcro in my experience.  They also encourage proper cable management, and avoid someone being too lazy to properly bundle their cables due to the added time and effort that clipping all the zip-ties and re-tying a bundle would be.  It's not a video, but here's an example"

While I still feel zip-ties are the absolute devil when it comes to cable management, I can appreciate that they're not that much of a burden if you're only working with them once or twice a week.  But if you're doing anything more than that, velcro is far, far superior in many ways."

cableporn,36mjpc,GeneralBS,3,Thu May 21 00:03:44 2015 UTC,"Electricity running down wire creates a field. The amount of current running down that wire modifies the strength of the field.   Put your hand over a wire, your thumb running along the direction of the current. Your fingers are the direction of the field.   Coil this wire many times, imagine your hand in the same position. You will notice that your fingers are always pointing down into the coil. This is creating a very strong and overlapping magnetic field. This is why we have motors, solenoids, speakers, and nearly every form of magnetic control.   Thinking about this in reverse is how we generate electricity!   If you move a magnetic field quickly along the length of wire, a small electrical current is generated. If you put a bar magnet into a coil of wire where the poles of the magnet are facing the wall of the coil, and spin the magnet, you will create a constant stream of current. The faster you spin the magnet, the stronger the current."

cableporn,36mjpc,framerotblues,3,Thu May 21 04:31:03 2015 UTC,I've worked in hundreds of racks that had terminal blocks starting with 1. Actually multiple strips within the same rack starting with 1.

cableporn,36mjpc,framerotblues,3,Thu May 21 04:35:59 2015 UTC,"Each strip has a unique designation such as TA, TB, TC, etc. It's not always the case that every rack has multiple strips starting with 1, but I've seen many. We also have accurate (mostly) wiring and schematic prints."

cableporn,36mjpc,TerrorBite,2,Thu May 21 04:56:26 2015 UTC,Somewhere in the EU - brown / black / grey for line; blue for neutral; green/yellow for earth are the new harmonised colours.  Red / yellow / blue / black / green/yellow is much better#
cableporn,36mjpc,mr7526,2,Thu May 21 07:20:01 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, good to know that I can correctly identify the neutral :P  We used to use red for active(live), black for neutral and plain green for earth, but these colors have been superseded. The Australian/New Zealand Standard (AS/NZS 3000:2007 §3.8.1) still allows for these colors, since it specifies:   Neutral: Must be light blue, or black. Earth: Must be green/yellow. Active: Red or brown are recommended, but any color apart from green, yellow, black or light blue can be used. Multiphase active: Red, white and dark blue are recommended for the three different phases.   For cables with multiple phases where one of the active lines is dark blue, the neutral is usually black instead of light blue to avoid potential confusion. Although our single-phase cables all use the European colors now, our multiphase cables can't do the same since black is forbidden as an active color under our current standard.  It's relevant to note that section 3.8.3.3 of the standard explicitly deals with connecting to cables that use European multiphase colors or the old Aus/NZ standard: http://puu.sh/hV4mB/bfa1066031.png"

However we simply change that yellow to white, and have (red, white, blue; black; green/yellow) as our standard multiphase colors, so that should be good enough for you :P"

For example, if during installation, the cables were bent too sharply, or pulled too hard, this damages the cables and can cause packet loss and other issue for example.  For this reason, cables are often tested with something called a TDR. Time domain reflectometer. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-domain_reflectometer They're sufficiently expensive that the small bad companies/installers don't use them, unfortunately.  Any good installation should properly test the cables with this sort of tool. By the look of your installation, it looks okay, but not ""I've done this for years and years okay"", so I would guess your installers probably don't know about TDR's and ensuring the cables aren't damaged during installation. If you don't specifically look for the damage with a TDR, you might not ever notice since software and protocols (eg: TCP) can mask the faults!  No a simple cable continuity tested is NOT a TDR."

Sadly you're right that small jobs and many cablers don't use a TDR. Shame on them! If it's too expensive, expect crap work and results. I've seen many network issues that causes issues that could have been prevented by good cabling!"

It only checks that you didn't literally wire up your cables incorrectly. It doesn't check for damage (except for physical breaks).  You need a more expensive tool to actually check your cables properly.

cableporn,36efq9,Cloudpico,1 point,Tue May 19 17:22:54 2015 UTC,"No. If you want to pay less than that you can get something used. For a true certifier that works you're looking at about $3k. However, the older ones are often not accepted for manufacturer warranties, so you're looking at at least $5-6k for a used Fluke DTX series that are still allowed by Ortronics/Leviton/etc."
cableporn,36efq9,mattsl,0,Sun May 31 05:43:06 2015 UTC,"Besides that 10k one, is there one more logically priced?   To be honest, I don't know the day-to-day exact prices, but 10k is an average. There are some that might cost 7-8k, and some will be 15k+. Some do only copper TDR, some can also (with an addon module) do fiber optical TDR.  If you're a small one person installer, you typically will rent this for a day at the end of a job if you're a quality installer. Unfortunately many contractors do ""shit""/unprofessional work, and never use this tool to verify the work.  All medium sized and up, or serious professionals either own or rent one. The tool pays for itself after a few jobs.  Remember to check to see if you're contractor does this, and you'll find out if they're a real professional or if they do commonplace bad wiring."

I'd query OP's method on one thing: If this place has to replace a rear plate (which I have seen), there's just no space to lift the card back and up/out! Looming from the opposite sides means you can then put a new set of ties on, slip the ties backward, and then hinge a whole card out still connected to all lines. - And the rest of the router remains live.

cableporn,36ap9a,anothergaijin,7,Mon May 18 05:07:39 2015 UTC,They are frowned on in copper networking installs because crushing the cables causes possible signal propagation issues.

But each of those cables pictured likely go to a single wall plate, wireless access point, or camera.  Larger wires (or at least higher capacity) DO make more sense from one location to one location and they are used for that. But when you have 400 cubicles each one gets a dedicated voice wire and data wire."
cableporn,36ap9a,mister_magic,15,Sun May 17 21:41:32 2015 UTC,"Apart from flexibility, etc. a big reason is probably price, directed by demand. I was looking at multicore BNC cables the other day: A single metre of Belden 1694A cable costs £2.80, whereas a single metre of 10 of those bundled together in one big cable costs £49.85 (sold as Belden 7713A). There's simply no need for it if you can achieve it with individual cables, depending on the install.  If they have a common route over a certain distance, you could multiplex the signals into a single fibre cable, but these cables here likely all go and separate pretty quickly and go to different endpoints. For example, in this lecture hall, each chair has it's own ethernet port and needs a cable anyway. You could chain them up, but you'd need an active switch at each new 'branch', unnecessarily inflating costs."

cableporn,3664bz,stealth_inc,6,Sat May 16 15:25:09 2015 UTC,"we've tried lots of methods from factory numbered wire to pre-labeling before pulls. we found it's easiest to ""phone"" them out using a ""butt set"".  pretty much we pull the correct amount of wires to each device, then identify each one afterwards. you can see in one of the pictures where all the wires are tied up in the panel; they're being prepped for labels."

We try to keep things as easy and clean as possible as we support 130+ locations remotely with no high level support on site, just basic staff that we have to talk through things, so neat/clean, labeling, documentation, and pictures for reference are key.  Also now building redundancy into the design, such as lacp between the firewall and the main switch stack, then lacp between that stack and the POE stack, so each switch connects to each other switch so we can take any single failure and only lose distribution ports, the rest of the switches will remain live, beats the old days of daisy chain for sure :)"

cableporn,35m2zw,cabritar,2,Tue May 12 17:00:42 2015 UTC,"The patch panels make the building's cabling completely independent from the networking (or telephone, or video, or...) hardware. They provide a defined, easy to label connection point between your hardware and the rest of the building.  Sure, theoretically you could just put connectors on the end of the cables and plug them into a switch directly, however that would have a good chance of getting pretty messy quickly. (Also, regular connectors can't, or rather, shouldn't be used with these types of cables, but that's a problem that could be solved if you really wanted to.)"

cableporn,35m2zw,Craigk_c19,2,Tue May 12 02:42:36 2015 UTC,Go on Amazon and search for ICND1 and ICND2.  Buy the cert guides and study.  This is for the CCNA Routimg & Switching test.  Look for some videos online such as CBT Nuggets.  I work with a guy who is 19 and he self-studied his way into the field.  Then you can study for CCNA Datacenter.

They specialize in the installation of low voltage copper, fiber, and network stuff. My union has a classification for them and they make good money (top out at 38 an hour after 5 years) but it's a more labor intensive career than just plugging in patch cords.

Velcro tape use is spot on.  One suggestion to take your room to the next level would be a water leak sensor to put under that AC unit.  They do tend to start dripping at a completely random and inconvenient moment.  Test the leak sensor regularly to ensure it is still up to snuff.

I was against them at first however I have slowly changed my mind over time.  Sure you may be able to buy a shitty laptop for the same price but that's just a start.  You need to think about costs involved with accidental insurance, software licensing, and battery replacements.  The IPads have a heap of Apps dedicated to the early education space and a lot of them are free. It's also a very simple device to use for kids because it does not have a keyboard and mouse.  Kids do not quite have the fine motor skills down pat to drive a full laptop.  We use laptops in our middle and senior schools and they get absolutely trashed.  Kids drop them, install a heap of crap and just generally abuse them.  The iPad is a good fit and managed in the right way is an amazing piece of technology to aid in the development of young kids.  You could just use a whiteboard but when these kids get to the higher grade levels they will be left behind.  Seems to be s very tired way of thinking from some people.  Get with the times"

cableporn,35gfnv,nickadam,22,Sun May 10 12:44:58 2015 UTC,"No number 16?  Also, I fail to understand how iPads are supposed to be useful for education. iPads are for watching Netflix, looking at facebook, and playing video games. You CAN read textbooks on an iPad. It's more expensive, less reliable, shinier, and has a far shorter service life than a textbook, but you can do it!  Whenever I hear people talking about how tablets are going to change the future of education, they talk about overglorified ebook software with IM feedback or whatever. Woooaah nelly. Books you can read on a screen? Who woulda thought? We better spend millions of dollars on iPads so our kids can read books and instant message their teachers at the same time.  ""But the kids, they learn better if the lesson is presented on a $400 glass slate. That's just how the millennial generation parses information. Paper is boring to them."""
cableporn,35gfnv,f0nd004u,37,Sun May 10 06:17:34 2015 UTC,"There are tons of apps based around making learning more fun for the students. These iPads are shared by Grade 6-8 kids that in general have a pretty short attention span to anything that has to do with school.  The class I helped out with used these iPads to draw very basic algebra equations. I don't know the app but the teacher writes down an equation on the board and tells the class to simplify it. The class, with their ipads in hand, write down the simplified version of the equation and the first one to press the ""Finish"" button gets their equation screen-cast onto the board from a projector. If hes right he gets a point, if hes wrong someone else has the opportunity to chime in. At the end of class the teacher can give the student with the most points something special and the students that don't understand can learn from not only their mistakes but others mistakes as well.  Overall its a great way to make math a competition since most prepubescent kids like competitions and competing with eachother. Tablets are rarely used to replace textbooks in class since students will 1) get bored and 2) whats the point if they already have the print version of the textbook?  These tablets aren't meant to replace textbooks or to become glorified ebooks but are meant to make teaching, learning and the classroom overall more entertaining, interactive and stimulating to the students."
cableporn,35gfnv,f0nd004u,-22,Sun May 10 06:24:26 2015 UTC,"So, what you're saying is, math is boring. So we bought a bunch of toys so the kids won't get bored with it, because the teacher is somehow incapable of engaging the students on his/her own.  I'm great with the idea of math competition. We did that when I was in school (which wasn't that long ago). We would walk up to the board and try the problem instead of screencasting to the projector. And it didn't cost ten grand for the 30 slates and the projector and the classroom server and the software licenses; it cost a white board and some pens.  I would have spent the thousands on decent school food. Or real computers with keyboards. Or something REALLY cool like a tabletop electron microscope or half an auto shop or some other awesome STEM education tool. You can teach math in an engaging, fun, and competitive way without the tablets. And if you don't have to spend it, it's irresponsible to spend that kind of money on toys."
cableporn,35gfnv,almanor,9,Sun May 10 06:34:26 2015 UTC,This is a great example of a non-teacher talking to an educator.

You were the one that said this and OP never said anything about kids wanting or needing iPads, he did say however, that there are tons of educational apps. It seems here that all you have done is try to manipulate OP's points and suggest things that have only one use such as a laser wood cutter or a high powered microscope whereas tablets have many uses. Did it not occur to you that there are many many reasons why OP's school has tablets? Just think about that for a second."
cableporn,35gfnv,f0nd004u,-8,Sun May 10 17:00:50 2015 UTC,I don't have a hate of apple! I just have a love for making nerds irrationally angry.  I honestly think that tablets are toys and that we don't need to put toys in our kids hands to keep then engaged. I think its lazy teaching. And I would rather spend the money on a cool tool instead of toys.
cableporn,35gfnv,philal,4,Sun May 10 17:04:04 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, but that is sadly the way the current generations are being raised up.

She was irate that her child had dropped his iPad claiming it 'slipped out of his hand' because the case was 'slippy'. I have the exact same case and it is by no means slippy, but it didn't occur to the parent to check it before giving it to a child. Really does make me think some times"
cableporn,35gfnv,f0nd004u,28,Sun May 10 17:08:37 2015 UTC,This is a public middle school with no cafeteria. Why would they need half an auto shop?
cableporn,35gfnv,f0nd004u,-20,Sun May 10 06:46:50 2015 UTC,"Half an auto shop is what I could buy with ten grand, which is my conservative estimate for a cart of 30 iPads with the associated infra. A full auto shop has TONS of possibilities at the 6-8th grade level and there would be a lot of interest, I guarantee you. Tabletop imaging equipment would have more specific applications, but be equally as awesome. With that much money, I could build out such a badass biology or chemistry lab. I could have eighth graders doing gene splicing, for pete's sake! I could also build an AMAZING wood shop with ten grand. Enough tools to build and design a house.   And YES, school kids can and do work on cars, build houses, splice genes, and learn how to use electron microscopes in school.  You want them to screencast math equations to the projected white board 20 feet away from them. And give them imaginary points! Yippee. How inventive. Oh how technology has advanced education.  By the way, I'd bet a thousand bucks that if you started serving healthy breakfasts at that school, grades would improve."
cableporn,35gfnv,Charly_ZA,18,Sun May 10 07:05:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think you could buy ""half an autoshop"". You'd 1) need a building large enough to house all the equipment plus maybe a few cars and 2) have routine safety inspections/government safety letters and all the legal crap that comes with having students interact with such dangerous machines.  If a middle school even comes close to having a big enough room for the cars a ventilation system, hydraulic lift and power shutdown systems would all have to be added to meet the governments standards. This alone can cost over 10k not to mention the price of tools and hiring teachers qualified to run the shop.  I don't know if you realize but you can't exactly just take a tool box and a car to a school and create an auto shop. It takes planning and a whole load of money (more than what the iPads are worth 5 fold)  to make a safe environment where students can interact with cars. This is why you don't see middle schools with auto shops. Not worth the money and hassle since kids will probably have no idea what they're learning from cars."

A top of the line lab isn't going to change that. With a bunch of laptops though, they're much easier for young kids to use, don't require 20 minutes of logging on, booting up, sorting out issues, etc, the majority of the time it works just fine, and require just a few minutes to see up rather than half a lesson."

cableporn,35gfnv,suprasb,4,Sun May 10 07:20:52 2015 UTC,"Chromebooks are just over $200 and have a bigger screen and full keyboard. They are MUCH easier for schools to manage and deploy software to. In my area, Chromebooks are all the rage in schools and iPads are fading."
cableporn,35gfnv,suprasb,0,Sun May 10 11:49:59 2015 UTC,I agree. However iPads don't need a special login system that can be tedious to setup and hard to manage. They aren't the most efficient use of funds but they are a bit more practical when teachers need students to just Google something or use an app instead of spending time logging in and logging out of the chromebooks.
cableporn,35gfnv,f0nd004u,3,Sun May 10 17:17:58 2015 UTC,wtf 300-400 is way higher than I was expecting. You can definitely get a good netbook for that much.
cableporn,35gfnv,spacebulb,0,Sun May 10 10:32:51 2015 UTC,"I worked for a public school in IT that had a 1:1 iPad program for the high school. Every day since they arrived I had wished they had gotten Chromebooks. They are way under utilized for actual educational content and they failed to replace computer labs (another selling point that had been pitched) because they are a pain to type on.  The Chromebooks easily fit within the budget, are easier to maintain, and are better for productivity. I do, however, think that  iPads are fantastic for younger kids where there's a lot available in terms of interactive educational content.  On a side note, maintaining iPads sucks. Up until just recently enterprise management capabilities were compete shit. Also having to get your heat gun and prying tools out to do most repairs sucks."

cableporn,35gfnv,rtkwe,2,Mon May 11 00:44:56 2015 UTC,"It's not about buying the laptops but also setting up restrictions on what students can access, adding the laptops to the school network so students can access their files and retrieve them from the school servers and seeing if they are compatible with most educator software (sometimes licenses don't work on more than 1 system so a separate license has to be bought for all the software students use."

cableporn,35gfnv,andersonsjanis,2,Sun May 10 16:31:09 2015 UTC,"The iPads are most likely purchased and maintained using a big federal grant. I believe the school system in my county pays nothing or close to it for all the iPads/Macbooks that the students use, including the people who setup and maintain them.  Of course, federal money has to come from somewhere, and we're all paying for it indirectly with our income taxes, but that's a whole different can of worms."

cableporn,35gfnv,tornato7,1 point,Tue May 12 19:38:19 2015 UTC,"That all obviously depends on how exactly the iPads are distributed and how heavy the education is. But I can tell you one thing, having a laptop in highschool/IB was the best thing ever. Not having to carry huge books with me, the ability to always have a calendar, take notes really fast anywhere, never lose any documents, quick access to online resources. Sure it also meant that I would play WoW during boring classes, but I can't imagine going through high school again without a laptop. I imagine an iPad is pretty much the same."
cableporn,35gfnv,Bartalone,-5,Sun May 10 11:34:04 2015 UTC,"Laptop and iPad are two different things. Laptops are for working AND playing! iPads are for Netflix. This is my entire problem with the idea, obviously kids need computers and that's not up for debate."

cableporn,35gfnv,Jotebe,3,Sat Jul 18 17:03:43 2015 UTC,Chromebooks do a good job at minimizing login time since they are connected to the schools Google Apps account. The tablets don't really need to be logged into though.

cableporn,355zco,KnivesForSale,2,Fri May 8 18:05:25 2015 UTC,"begging   Suggesting.  Also, you would only be collecting public information. It's assumed that a post you make on reddit (like this one) will be read, and could be archived to be read by people 50 years in the future, if people really cared.  How about having a thread where you introduce yourself? Or PMing a bot which adds you to a whitelist after 1 day, and you can't make comments or posts until you're whitelisted. Or just start a timer when the user tries to make a post, and send a PM 1 day afterwards saying that you are now allowed to comment."

I'm a huge advocate of ""Rule 33: Lurk Moar"" so that is something I would support. But arbitrarily validating worthy posters seems strange. The basic format of Reddit (user submitted/user appraised) should take care of everybody's concerns. I mean, if it's a shitpost, don't upvote it. If 1500 people upvote a picture and the rest of the community gets upset about it, that's not something we'll be able to regulate with more safeguards in place."

Honestly, this looks like it could improve the sub at least a little, so I'm not seeing much of an issue.  Basically, what I'm saying is that the only thing that changed after I linked it was that the mods actually tried to do something about the shit."

I made no mention of how the women handle it, because it wasn't relevant to your question. I don't think the women (in 90%+ of cases anyways) want the white knights to come to their defense, but it still happens. Please do not put words into my mouth that do not belong there. Thank you."

Women, being people, are just as insecure as men, also people. Even the very pretty women don't believe they are pretty, generally speaking. I don't look at this photo and think, ""She's smiling for points."" I think, ""She's proud of her work and is putting her signature on it.""   Look at pictures of young girls and boys in groups. The girls are trained from day one to smile and ""be pretty"" for the camera. No one's really pushing the boys to smile. At a high school party, pull out a camera. The difference between each gender's reaction is significant. Same with wedding photos. Women have a different relationship with cameras. That's all.   I hope this doesn't sound like White Knighting, because believe-you-me I am not interested in any of that. I'm just trying to introduce a different perspective to your line of thinking. You seem rather certain, and I disagree. I grew up with a ton of sisters and girl cousins and my experience just doesn't grok with the majority opinion.  Lastly, you should try to find a job where people don't get yelled at. Jesus Christ, that sounds miserable. I had a boss that yelled at me for a short period. I quit and found something else. These days you can put in a formal complaint under ""hostile work environment"" and you'll be legally protected. Cowards yell. A boss of true character is capable of looking you in the eye and saying, ""This work is unsatisfactory. I expect it to be perfect by COB."" (Next time your boss yells at anybody, you should say, ""Uhhh... this guy on the internet says you're a coward."" /s)"

If OP thought their gender would gain them karma and took the pic with that thought in mind… then we're douchebags for falling for that ploy.    Either way, TALKING ABOUT OP'S GENDER IS WRONG. We're either giving the attention seeker the attention they want, or were giving a hard working cabler attention on something that's immaterial.   Some people like selfies.

Or maybe OP took one picture in which they needed/wanted a face in, and on a lark posted the same one here as well. It doesn't matter why the face was in it.   (Obviously, this all assumes that this was a legitimate post... original content, work performed by OP, et cetera. If not, then existing rules should handle it.)   Having run groups in the past, I don't think that we need to create special rules for the occasional wild occurrence like this. Mod sensibly, within reason, and watch for patterns. Oh, and Mods, you know that some dipshit will likely lampoon this situation or try to ""prove"" some gender bias that they have by being a copycat. Don't fall for it.  Edit: Or"

To me, everyone from a fresh-in-the-field cable monkey to a vet who can cable lace like Picasso should be able to post and I'll usually upvote anyone just for an 'atta boy/girl. Yeah, there are gonna be those who upvote it due to the human condition, but having a giant philosophical debate over the merits of what 'deserves' an upvote really comes off as a bit overly elitist and I wouldn't doubt it if the whole thing ran her / others away from being more active in the community.

Also, strictly speaking there's not really a lot of ""cableporn"" in that gallery.  And as far as ""making a stand against sexism"", it seems to me that taking a subreddit that's fairly explicitly about non-human pictures and making it into a subreddit that's somewhat about human pictures is in no way and under no circumstances a stand against sexism, either in general or in the industry. If you want to take a stand against sexism there are plenty of places where you can actually do that, but in my opinion defocusing the subreddit isn't doing that.

We're discussing banning selfies to codify the long-standing tradition of not putting people in pics here. Of the Top 100 posts on this subreddit 1 is a selfie, and it's the post in question.

This is a sub about extremely good cablework and nothing else. If you would change the content posted on the sub to appease your issue, whatever your issue may be, then you would destroy the content of the sub for your little issue, and you should instead leave and create your own space where people can post cables and their faces and see if anyone subscribes.

For me (I'm not even particularly fast or  experienced) it represents less than a day of work.  Let's be clear, /r/cableporn is for cables. Don't believe me? Think that's an opinion? Read the sidebar.   A place for sharing links to good-looking cabling (primarily data centers) that could be considered art (or porn) to the network junkies of Reddit.   This isn't ""good looking"" and it's not art or porn. The bend radii are too tight, the bundles are sloppy, and the management isn't clean or uniform.

We've been exclusively a content sub for as long as I've been here so that's how our rules are written. I would love to think that writing ""No personal attacks or harassment.

And while we're doing that, we should not be dicks. And, in general, folks who are the brunt of a little good natured ribbing (sexist, ageist, racist, or otherwise) should learn to be a little less sensitive and just roll with it.

If you want half-finished cabling with a girl in frame to head into the top 100 posts, reward that, and block any dissenting comments. That way lies literal cable porn, though.   I'll be honest, if the cabling at work wasn't such a shit-show, I'd be tempted to hire a bikini model and a couple of kittens and see what sort of high-score I could set."

cableporn,353uw1,zoidberg318x,2,Thu May 7 06:51:29 2015 UTC,Have worked in a dc now for a year and didn't know this. Thank you.
cableporn,353uw1,King_Tryndamere,31,Thu May 7 02:36:23 2015 UTC,"Just to reinforce the definition, I'll explain in my terms.  To understand an IDF, you need to know about and understand MDF's.  Essentially, an MDF is the main, or primary, wiring junction for a building or campus.  It can be, but doesn't NEED to be the location of servers, and/or the demarcation point for the service providers (it often is the server/equipment location, in small to mid sized locations).  In smaller locations, you may only have the MDF, and that's it.  Everything wired to one spot, and that's that.  IDF's on the other hand, typically just distribute from large-channel medium distance links (like 10GbE SX-MM fiber) to a floor or building.  All the network links in the zone (which, again, could be a building, floor or department), are trunked to the MDF, or another IDF.  Typically, the IDF only carries distribution and/or access layer equipment (see: Hierarchical internetworking model), where the MDF, contains the core infrastruture, and sometimes distribution/access layer equipment too.  in more complex topologies, IDF's cross connect to provide redundant pathing back to the MDF, and between IDF's.  ... that's the idea anyways."
cableporn,353uw1,MystikIncarnate,8,Thu May 7 01:18:35 2015 UTC,So kind of like a mini hub that takes the pressure off of the main hubs?
cableporn,353uw1,SomeoneCutCarlsHair,38,Thu May 7 05:02:24 2015 UTC,"It can, but typically not.  Really depends on the configuration.  Several factors come into play here...  The distribution layer, as defined by the Hierarchical internetworking model, in larger, more complex environments, can reduce the overall load (or pressure) on the core.  Under that Hierarchical model, the access layer simply multiplies ports (eg. wiring 90+ ports into a single stack of switches), that uplinks to the distribution layer by a high-speed link, sometimes even a stacking link, which can be rated to well over 35+ Gb/s (using a particular Catalyst model I happen to know the stats for off the top of my head, for reference).  The distribution layer, by best practices, should be where you do any filtering, access control, port security management, inter-vlan routing, etc.  As much as possible, so that you reduce the overall load on the core.  The core should only need to be concerned with relaying packets between distribution areas.  No filtering, no security.  Just mass amounts of packets travelling at incredibly fast rates of speed, inside the network.  In this context, yes, the distribution functions of the IDF can 'take the pressure off' of the main hubs.  To further your point, sometimes the IDF's are inter-connected (IDFs are connected to the MDF and other IDF's).  This means that inter-IDF traffic doesn't NECESSARILY need to go through the MDF.  Depending on the routing protocols, it could bypass the MDF entirely.  Again, depends on the topology, complexity and configuration.  Most commonly, IDF's will move distribution traffic to access level traffic; so it becomes little more than a glorified port replication.  Let's take a simple example:  one MDF, one IDF in a medium business environment, single campus.  To give a more real-world context to this, let's say, two joined buildings (highrise), with a bridge (""umbilical"") between them.  distance from the far walls is ~300m (900-1000ft).  Ethernet standards limit home-run cabling to 90m.  It is reasonable to think, that each building is ~150m across.  If you put a distribution facility (or frame) in the middle, the longest run from the MDF/IDF to any point in the single building, is 75m.  However, if you were to put the MDF in the middle of the two buildings, near the umbilical, you would need ~150m runs to make it to the outermost workstations, beyond the specs.  Introduce IDF.  have an MDF in the ""main"" building, with your servers, main rack gear, core network, and main distribution facility gear (including ISP, core switch, core router, distribution switch, and filtering equipment).  The MDF in this scenario is at, or near, the center-point of building 1.  run a fiber line across the two buildings ~150m of SX, MM fiber (which is rated to 550m), and use a 10GbE link (all access links are 1GbE in this example).  Install an IDF in the middle of the second building, uplinked to your MDF using the highspeed 10Gb/s link.  Then wire all home-run cables, from workstations to the IDF (~75m max).  The IDF has little more than a two-post rack, and a few switches with a UPS, but provides access-layer connections to all ports in the building.  A major purpose of using an IDF is to reduce the overall cabling required between zones, consolidating the data into a few (typically more expensive), longer-distance runs, back to the MDF, to join the network.  I've seen setups similar to this at a lawyers firm (they actually had one MDF, and three IDFs, the MDF was their server room, an IDF halfway across the building with the MDF, then up one floor, to another IDF (a few riser cables inbetween), then a fiber link to another building across an umbilical, to a third IDF), and at an airport I worked with (they had a backup set of servers, fiber linked to their main servers.  The backup servers were all the way across campus in another building, fiber linked, all running VMs with high availability, and fully redundant SAN arrays on both sides), and at a small business, which just had a building that was too long, half way down a hallway of offices, was an IDF, simply because, while the size of their facility was fairly small, end to end, was longer than 90m...  IDF's consolidate access layer connections (to workstations and access points) into broader connections back to the core.  To expand further, you can break it down even more.  Think of a college campus, several buildings, not far apart, but all share a network: core layer in the Hierarchical model is in the server room, which connects to IDF's in each nearby building, using fiber, each building has an IDF for distribution, which connects all levels (which requires riser cabling and floor sealing and separation for fire safety), to the core, then each floor in the building has an IDF for the workstations on that floor.  When you think about it at that scale, you start to understand the Hierarchical internetworking model a bit better: core, in the server room/MDF, to the building's distribution IDF, where the signal is ""split"" (typically via a multilayer switch) to each floor, and each floor, with access layer switches to multiply ports so all stations have a connection.  Core, Distribution, Access.  MDF, IDF, IDF."

cableporn,34kdln,sirnicolai,18,Fri May 1 22:26:44 2015 UTC,Oh do tell. I have never seen patch panels that do that.
cableporn,34kdln,dwarfman367,36,Fri May 1 22:41:04 2015 UTC,"Its a Commscope system called iPatch or imVision. There is also a little screen than tells you where each end of the cable is.   And some software which records everything and which you can use to send jobs to the little screen. So you send a job to the screen, send the tech to the frame and the screen tells the tech ""Patch X to X"".  I dont use the software as we are a hosted Datacentre with lots of different customers. But the panels will be super useful by the time the frame is full, will save heaps of time on maintenance (no frame book to update) and its higher density than my other frames."
cableporn,34kdln,novexnz,17,Fri May 1 23:18:38 2015 UTC,"for anyone interested in how they log which switch port is being used the standard is you terminate leads cut in half that are permanently patched into a switch at one end and terminated at the panel on the other. so one rack of panels is essentialy an extension of the switches but with connection logging. the panels above the ports have an IR sensor that detects when a lead is plugged in, and will then associate the next insertion as the other end of the lead."

cableporn,34kdln,novexnz,1 point,Sat May 2 18:28:09 2015 UTC,"Its expensive to set up, and you have to buy the screens to manage the panels. The way I justified it was against the cost of our existing Visi Patch frames.  Visi patch is modular, but only has 16 ports to 1U, and the cables cost 3 times the price of a normal patch lead. So when we factored in the cost of a full frame load of Visi leads, the ipatch - overall - became a little bit cheaper. And it was higher density.  But if you dont use a visi frame already then yes it might be a bit hard to justify."

Sorry Unitronics, but that seems like /r/crappydesign. Possibly done to save costs? The actual wiring does look nice. Although it looks like 24VDC goes to 0V and 24COM to V2."
cableporn,34e86b,JohnyZoom,2,Thu Apr 30 16:34:16 2015 UTC,Its actually an inner door (2 door enclosure). I noticed the 24com and 24vdc swap also but that's how its shown in my specs so Im gonna roll with it. Not a huge fan of unitronics either.
cableporn,34e86b,kaizam,2,Thu Apr 30 17:33:09 2015 UTC,"The controller is likely a touchscreen PLC and it's cost effective to put the I/O on the same PCB as the rest of the hardware.  Most companies offer a networked version where the I/O blocks can be placed remotely, but 5 feet of 16ga MTW wire per I/O channel is simply cheaper than remote I/O options in the same enclosure."

You end up with a huge door harness, unless you have a ton of pushbuttons and lamps on the door. An HMI usually eliminates the need for all the 'local' PBs and lamps anyway.  In any case, that's a nice, neat job on the wiring, OP! I would have 'cheated' and used wire duct ;) I have to ask though... Why no ferrules?"

Fiber can't be re-terminated in the field to get the perfect lengths so every cable is built to be a bit too long. Slack management is designed into all fiber panels for this very reason.

cableporn,34bhfh,tcuffe03,2,Thu Apr 30 18:01:47 2015 UTC,The time and complexity of the terminations really depend on the manufacturer of SM connector and their kits. 3M has a quick termination kit that can be done in under 3 minutes whereas TE's connectors may take 5-6 minutes.

This old cable management technique, taught to generations of linemen,  is still used in some modern applications since it does not create obstructions along the length of the cable, avoiding the handling problems of cables groomed by plastic or velcro cable ties.  Cable lacing uses a thin cord, traditionally made of waxed linen, to bind together a group of cables using a series of running lockstitches. Flat lacing tapes made of modern materials such as Nylon, Polyester, Teflon, Fiberglass, and Nomex are also available with a variety of coatings to improve knot holding.

cableporn,33pkdc,tcuffe03,3,Fri Apr 24 13:36:36 2015 UTC,Can you share a bit more about the design and layout of a fiber network like this?    I'm in a new development area and am considering trying to push for a municipal network to serve the new developments (it's a compact area with a mix of apartment/condo type buildings going in and a bunch of townhomes).
cableporn,33pkdc,marklyon,6,Fri Apr 24 17:31:39 2015 UTC,"In the MDF (1st Floor), we have an optical line terminal with (8) SM fiber outputs. I'm running 6-strand SM fiber to the 2nd, 5th, 7th, and 9th floor into a wall mounted fiber patch panel. From the patch panel, I'm a running (1) SM fiber jumper into a 1x32 optical splitter. From the optical splitter, I am running (1) SM fiber to an Optical Network Terminal which is in a residential enclosure in each hotel room. Also, from the splitters I am running the fiber to rooms on the current floor, floor above, and floor below. Then from the Optical Network Terminal, CAT6 is being run to date, voice, and video outlets in the hotel room. Hope this made decent sense."
cableporn,33pkdc,Zabren,3,Fri Apr 24 18:00:55 2015 UTC,Interesting. I make software that telecoms use to manage these networks. I don't often get to see actual fiber/cabinets/splices and all that. Thanks for sharing :D
cableporn,33pkdc,philal,3,Sat Apr 25 20:19:45 2015 UTC,Noob question here. Why is the cable wrapped around? I'm guessing there is a logical explanation because otherwise it wouldn't have been done
cableporn,33pkdc,MightyMike_GG,9,Fri Apr 24 17:09:16 2015 UTC,"Installers keep a lenght of slack for service purposes. That's what is wrapped around­. Not only does it make splicing way easier it allows for  repairs, equipment moves, etc..."
cableporn,33pkdc,philal,2,Fri Apr 24 18:01:12 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, thanks for the explanation!"
cableporn,33pkdc,setiprogram,4,Fri Apr 24 18:02:36 2015 UTC,We purchase the SM fiber in preterminated lengths and they come in standard lengths. Not every run to the rooms are the same so there's always going to be some slack. This was just the best way to manage the slack without having to splice the fiber to exact lengths. I prefer to keep the fiber from being augmented and keeping it to manufacturer condition.
cableporn,33pkdc,JmactheAttack,-2,Fri Apr 24 18:03:03 2015 UTC,There are 3 main reasons IIRC:   Fiber is somewhat rigid and cannot bend  Sharp turns produce a lose in signal It is big pain in the ass to cut and join fiber https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaLBlLbUrp4
cableporn,33pkdc,philal,6,Fri Apr 24 18:11:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what type of fiber you're using. This fiber is singlemode bend-insensitive fiber, and I can wrap it around my thumb without it attenuating."
cableporn,33pkdc,SmellyFinger,3,Fri Apr 24 18:14:53 2015 UTC,"You just presented us with a video on how to fusion splice a fiber. They also showed them using a precision cleaver to cleave (cut) the bare glass. I'm not sure if you realize this, but this is seriously the easiest method of joining two fibers. It isn't difficult at all and the actual fusion part is completely automated when using a modern fusion splicer. Better yet, if you have a fusion splicer, you can even get fiber connectors that you can splice onto so you really only strip and cleave then let the splicer do the rest."
cableporn,33pkdc,redditmoose,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:46:46 2015 UTC,Would they not count as sharp turns?
cableporn,33pkdc,drakontas,2,Fri Apr 24 18:13:02 2015 UTC,No. The newer singlemode fibers can commonly handle bend radii down to 7.5mm. Those fiber management spools are much larger than that.

LEDs are not there yet.  Hobbyist grower 19 yearolds who have 2 plants will debate this to death (if this was /r/trees I wouldnt even bother writing this) .

I haven't gotten the chance to shadow a service yet but I see them post pictures often of equipment I have only dreamed about"
cableporn,33hw3o,imagreatlistener,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:22:08 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of arenas and large venues that rent their equipment instead of owning. Churches always own, which gives them an advantage. A complex  high end system has no downsides if you have the time to install it right and it never needs to move. I won't comment on whether it's good or bad to spend so much on audio gear, because I too work in a church with expensive equipment (though not as much as this) and I consciously focus on not letting production be the goal of the church. I wouldnt mind my waves plugs live though..."

My church is a bit different. We have the talent needed to run a sound system but the equipment is predominantly from the 90s. We're finally throwing out the Minidisc players though...

cableporn,33hw3o,Cameroo,3,Thu Apr 23 15:19:08 2015 UTC,You're lucky then. See the funny thing is the senior pastor knows the importance of good equipment since he used to be in several bands and is an avid guitar player (he even built an exact replica of Van Halen's guitar years ago). It just comes down to approving money with the session for the sound system when we need it. There's still some good equipment but the sound booth was shoddily built and cables need to be replaced/rerouted. It's a mess. But it'll get there!

I do see one problem, that those relays are rated for only 13 Amps and the breaker might use more and the traces on the actual PCB are not too big. I have a similar project with the same modules and the PCB traces scared me.. Mine still works but is only being used for low current stuff, the biggest thing I've used is a 2kW heater and even that I feel is pushing it a bit."
cableporn,338keh,infinity2022,22,Mon Apr 20 15:01:37 2015 UTC,Well this system would require a complete rewiring of a home. Technically you would need to bring all the cables from all the consumers to the breaker panel which is not feasible at all. I have modularized it since then with encapsulated modules and wireless nrf based communication :-)  Also all 64 relays are eating up a LOT of AMPS at 5v (the PSU is 20A right now and i still have intermittent RPI crashes when i'm powering them all) :-)

But for outlets and things like that... make sure to check specifications very carefully because capacitive loads (crappy power supplies with no inrush limiting) and dead shorts will make a lot of them give up the smoke faster than a fuse or breaker would trip.  Test thoroughly before buying too many!"
cableporn,338keh,ThisWillPass,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:30:57 2015 UTC,Would inductive loads also make cause the magic smoke to leak out?
cableporn,338keh,bradn,3,Fri Apr 24 04:18:03 2015 UTC,"Generally not in disproportion to their VA rating.  That is, a 200W motor might have a power factor of .67, then you could have what looks like 300W to the switching device.  It just means that more current is being drawn when the voltage is lower than average, in comparison to how a resistor would draw current.  There can sometimes be problems of TRIAC/SCR type stuff of failing to turn off if the current waveform gets strange enough.  The thing is that they can only turn off at zero-current crossings and if it misses turning off or the load device somehow makes current flow (through a high enough voltage pulse or a fast enough voltage change to capacitively mess with stuff), it turns back on and then it's stuck on until the next zero crossing.  Inductive loads are dangerous to mechanical relays though, if the relays aren't synchronized to zero crossings.  It's surprisingly easy to kill relays with big motors.  The problem is that when the contacts are opened, current will continue to flow (inductor can supply enough voltage to strike an arc).  It can only happen for so long, but it can start to damage the metal surface and after enough times it will typically weld the contacts together.  Sometimes tapping it will free it, but the problem remains after a few more tries.  The capacitive loads are pretty easy to understand... a very beefy capacitor looks like a short circuit when power gets applied, and semiconductor junctions are pretty small.  If there's more heat than can escape fast enough... well, have fun with that."

Technically you would need to bring all the cables from all the consumers to the breaker panel which is not feasible at all.   Lot of effort for a rewire, sure. But plenty have been installed like that.   How are you powering the remote modules? Say for the lights? Is your cabled looped at the switch or the light? Makes me think at the switch is a better idea for future proofing.  Oh and just a tip, make those relays replaceable."
cableporn,338keh,glymph,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:45:31 2015 UTC,"the remote modules are powered locally from the distribution box. I have modularized the relay boards to sets of 4 solid state relays that fit in the distribution box with an atmega328, gets power from it and also sends it to another 4 channel module for the switches.

cableporn,338keh,z3rocool,1 point,Tue Apr 21 08:52:28 2015 UTC,i solved that problem by creating separated modules interconnected wirelessly by a NRF mesh network and by a 4 wire cable for rs485 communication
cableporn,338keh,TechIsCool,4,Tue Apr 21 08:57:11 2015 UTC,You want some latching relays. (I believe the ones you have - since I have the same modules from china - are non latching meaning you use power to keep em on!)  Not to mention if you get a power failure all those relay states are going to be reset to OFF.
cableporn,338keh,joshamania,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:20:39 2015 UTC,you're right and i had that exact problem with this prototype which made me save the state in a database and restoring it the second the system got power. The problem with this is how fast i'm restoring power as i cant do it too fast because the breakers may disengage
cableporn,338keh,joshamania,2,Tue Apr 21 06:15:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah so what you want is latching relays. They only use power to switch. (you can disconnect all power and they will remain in their previous state - useful if you're doing upgrades or work on the circuit too!)  You obviously still want to save state, but restoring state will be much easier.   I would look into some power monitor devices because why the hell not. I knew an IC that was dead simple for AC power monitoring (you simply get an analog out - so you need a lot of ADC's) but I forgot the part number. They were in the $2 range - so yeah that's a big extra cost but mega cool :)"

cableporn,338keh,ptinsley,8,Tue Apr 21 15:02:40 2015 UTC,No feasible is not true. Just not cost effective. Every Can in our Livingroom and Kitchen is run to a few junction boxes and then to the dimmers you can change any light to any dimmer. We did this at install and have switches the patterns about 5 times in the life of the room.
cableporn,338keh,nexxai,2,Mon Apr 20 15:53:53 2015 UTC,"Or you could eliminate switches and manual controls inside a home completely.  In one sense it would make the wiring of a home less expensive because of saved copper and wiring costs.  But...those SSRs mentioned in the thread...probably the best strategy...they're spendy...even your relay box looks incredibly expensive to build (compared to traditional wiring)...but I wouldn't necessarily let that stop you.  What you really need is a smartphone app based control system.    A Rpi might make a good server but a web interface I don't think will be very well received by users.  I've thought about how to do this a little and if one could set up a system that could determine what room a user is in via their phone...or motion sensors or something...it could be rather interesting.  I think the most unfortunate angle is that users probably aren't ready to ditch the whole light-switch concept...but one could make wireless controls for that too I suppose.  What you could do with that is shop it to investors...try to start a business...get bought out by Schneider Electric.  :-)  Though honestly, you can probably buy/make an off-the-shelf type PLC system that can switch 120v that won't have a huge impact on total cost of ownership.  It may be more expensive than a Pi, but when you're dumping 30 grand on home electrics, a couple here or there in PLCs isn't going to make a big impact on ownership cost."
cableporn,338keh,redditmoose,2,Mon Apr 20 20:37:10 2015 UTC,"You're completely right and to maintain the ""legacy"" of the switches i've designed a few atmega328+rs485 (if you really hate wireless)+NRF connectivity that act like regular switches and tell me which channel should i power."
cableporn,338keh,magmapus,2,Tue Apr 21 06:17:27 2015 UTC,Nice.  I do expect this to be the future of home wiring...I think it's just a matter now of when the market is ready to accept it.

cableporn,338keh,zombieregime,9,Mon Apr 20 18:02:49 2015 UTC,"I was advised to use a Pi, software, transistors, opto-isolators, and semiconductor dimmers as a control system instead of relays.  There's far less noise, mechanical wear, and failure, and you have built-in dimming control of your lights.  The problem is that the board I/O I was going to use was 5V, security stuff is always designed for 12V, and household line is 120V here so there's alot of power conversion.  Yes, it does need complete rewiring.  All of the groups of lights each need a separate feed.  These can be JB'd in a 4x4 beside the panel to 12 loads to meet code when there's no automation.  In the average new house, that's another $100 of 14/2, and $250 of labor just to wire it that way before you even do any automation with it.  Edit: I am interested in finding a 12V microcontroller I can run from my PC."
cableporn,338keh,michelework,7,Mon Apr 20 15:59:44 2015 UTC,"Edit: I am interested in finding a 12V microcontroller I can run from my PC.   I doubt you'll find any. Just about all ICs run on 5V or less, and something like a Raspberry Pi or Arduino are regulating whatever you send down anyways. You could use a PC power supply to regulate everything for you. It'll provide very clean 5V, 3.3V and 12V, which is everything you'll need."
cableporn,338keh,zz_z,6,Mon Apr 20 20:40:37 2015 UTC,"You could probably do something like running the actual control via ATMega chips (Arduino) and then controlling those from the Pi via serial, i2c, etc.  Arduino has much more robust IO for this sort of thing and it's 5v so you start from an easier base.  Here's an example of a circuit you could easily build to use with dimming.  Fairly easy to implement.  You might not want such a circuit on some circuits though ie inductive loads or electronics - for those, an SSR would likely be best.  If I was doing a new build, I would probably run wires to a main panel or sub panels depending on the house layout, and control from there.  For a retrofit, it would be fairly easy to build control units small enough to fit in a single-gang box and scatter them around the house.  Cost wise, a basic circuit with an ATMega controller would be less than $15 / channel.  Communication culd be done via something like the ESP8266, an xbee implementation, or something as simple as twisted pair wiring back to a central point for serial."
cableporn,338keh,seanandstuff,2,Mon Apr 20 20:50:05 2015 UTC,thats exactly what i end up doing. Atmega328 on relay/switch/sensor boards all over the house communicating to a rpi server that manages the entire power distribution in the home.
cableporn,338keh,Fuzzybunnyofdoom,2,Tue Apr 21 06:19:08 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty inexperienced, but can't you use a MOSFET or some other transistor in combination with an adequate power supply/regulator to get 12v, either externally or run through the arduino vin? Err... Probably externally if you want to keep it connected to pc, because you don't want the power supply and USB connected at same time."

cableporn,32yhou,LeJoker,1 point,Sat Apr 18 14:46:32 2015 UTC,"The long pedal on the right is a volume pedal.  The purple pedal is an envelope filter, so one of the many things it can do is auto-wah. So it is a ""wah pedal"" but not in the typical sense."

cableporn,32yhou,alfiepates,7,Mon Apr 20 14:58:38 2015 UTC,Awesome to see someone else using PowerCon. I switched many years ago and have never looked back.
cableporn,32yhou,canuck_tech,5,Fri Apr 17 23:45:18 2015 UTC,I noticed that too... what are the advantages? Just the locking?
cableporn,32yhou,kevinkace,2,Sat Apr 18 03:14:50 2015 UTC,"Locking, durability, more flexibility since all your connectors are identical, etc.   Daisy-chaining, too."
cableporn,32yhou,kevinkace,2,Sat Apr 18 15:03:55 2015 UTC,The advantage is that they are a locking connector. Its also not possible for the connection to become loose like a standard NEMA connector.  They are available in several amperage ratings as well and are made for heavier gauge cable.  This is because some stage power runs can be very long and cables are larger to reduce the volt drop. The are based on the SpeakOn design.
cableporn,32yhou,mrnotloc,6,Sun Apr 19 01:00:11 2015 UTC,Here are some more pics....  Pedal Board Pic 2  Pedal Board 3  Interface  Cable Snake  Signal chain.... Interface---EBVP Jr. (I added a Griffen Effects Buffer)---Boss OC-2---EH Bass Big Muff---WMD Super Fatman---TC Corona Chorus---Boss DD-5 (tap tempo w/ Boss FS-5U)---EH Small Stone Nano---TECH 21 VT Bass---Empress Compressor---Interface.  EBVP Jr. Tuner Out---TC Polytune---Interface. This allows me to send a signal back to the rack tuner in my primary rig. I have a second smaller rig that I need the board tuner for. Why not have just a board tuner you say? That wouldn't be fun. I like having the rack mount tuner.  Switchcraft and GLS Audio Plugs. Mogami 2319 cable. All audio and power cables custom made to length.  Edit:  Added signal chain.
cableporn,32yhou,EddieDean18,6,Fri Apr 17 19:37:47 2015 UTC,That's rad. A bass rig I take it? Can you explain the RRS/TAG?  I like the risers for the middle pedals. I need to redo my board. I always have trouble with the velcro being too strong and ripping off from the board or pedal instead of separating the 2 velcro pieces.
cableporn,32yhou,Koulokoe,9,Fri Apr 17 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"Your are correct. It is a bass board.  It's an interface that provides a place where all connections come into or out of the board. My bass signal comes in through G(guitar), out through S(send), and on to the Volume Pedal. The signal going back to the amp goes though the middle R(return), out through A(amp), and on to my preamp. The signal going through the top R starts at the tuner out on the volume pedal, then to the Polytune, out to the top R, through to T(tuner), and on to my rack tuner.  Let me recommend 3M Dual Lock instead of Velcro.  The adhesive backing on the Dual Lock is very good at what it does."

cableporn,32yhou,mattfromtelevision,2,Sat Apr 18 11:38:35 2015 UTC,"Here is a link to an EP I co-wrote and played bass on. I did not use this board on these tracks.  If I remember correctly I used the Electro Harmonix Bass Big Muff and the Boss OC-2 on the first and last track.  I toured with this band for a few years.  Since then, I've played with a couple of different people locally. I currently play in a cover band me and some guys started about two and a half years ago.  Sound&Shape: Now Comes the Mystery"
cableporn,32yhou,mattfromtelevision,4,Sat Apr 18 14:20:16 2015 UTC,"I've seen board like this before, and I've always been curious how you manage to step on the right one without a) hitting something else too, b) messing up the tuner knobs, or c) falling over. I'd injure myself quite seriously trying to use that."
cableporn,32yhou,pastanazgul,3,Sat Apr 18 01:54:21 2015 UTC,"That's a good question.  I've built a couple of rigs for myself over the years.  The first thing I always do is play around with the layout for awhile, to make absolute certain things are in the ""right for me"" place. Sometimes layout will follow your signal path and sometimes not. For instance, after the volume pedal, the signal goes to first to the Boss OC-2(brown pedal), then to the EH Bass Big(green pedal to the left), then back to the WMD Super Fat Man(Purple Pedal).  Why are they out of order like this?.... There is an incredible sound achieved when using an octave pedal(Boss OC-2) with an envelope filter (WMD Super Fat Man), and with the layout shown, I'm able to engage/disengage both pedals at the same time with one foot.  If I had layout followed the signal path, it would require two feet and some good balance to pull of a smooth transition.  The second and third row of pedals are on risers to provide clearance when turning those on and off.  The back row are set-and-forget units.  The compressor is always on, and if I need to tune, all I have to do is roll back on the volume pedal.  This mutes the signal going to the effects pedals/amp, but still sends a signal through the tuner path. So really I'm never having to reach back to the third row with my foot."
cableporn,32yhou,ZAMson,2,Sat Apr 18 15:02:50 2015 UTC,"The real answer is to know your board in and out. I can use mine without looking because I added to it pedal by pedal. It helps my first pedal was a wah and that's a pretty heavy use pedal compared to one you just turn on and leave. Balance builds up and slowly your board just becomes its own instrument. No one in the world can use my pedal board the same way I do, and I couldn't use OP's board the way he does"

Roughly 145 patches going into shiny new Cisco 3850's.   Unfortunately, I had two different lengths of patch cables so it got a little sloppy on the drooping ends on either side that I hope I can go back and clean up one of these days.  I have had a couple of opportunities to assist my Senior with a number of closet re-wires, but this was my first solo attempt.  I hope it meets /r/cableporn's expectations."
cableporn,32upl9,BaseRape,7,Thu Apr 16 21:37:00 2015 UTC,"The few cables coming from the left side and patching the right 12 patches drives me nuts.  Left goes to the left 12, right goes to the right 12.  Where are your doors for the vertical managers?"
cableporn,32upl9,Nicko147,2,Thu Apr 16 23:17:39 2015 UTC,"I forgot to explain on the wierdness of the small handful of cables that wrap from the right side of the patch panel around to the left.  These are patch cables for the wireless access points around the building. Since this was a new construction at a remote location our normal in-house team did not pull the cat6. A contractor did it, so all of the drops for the AP's are scattered all over the patch panel. (I asked if we could get that fixed and I was told ""Riiight..."")   So, when we patched in all of the AP's to test wireless connectivity and performance, I only did those patches first. Our standard is to have AP's on the first 6 ports of each switch with the number of AP patches spread evenly between the switches in the stack. These 15 or so patches are all wrapped around the left side and patched into the first 3 or so ports on each switch with the cables all bundled together separately form the rest of the cables. This bundle is then tucked behind the main bundle of cables on the left side. In retrospect, I should have kept that bundle in the front for easier access in case we need it.  And the doors are there, I just didn't have them on when I took the pic. I'll get a second pic when I go back out next time."

cableporn,32qqz5,novitus,1 point,Fri May 22 00:40:22 2015 UTC,500s are a fight and a half. Are those parallel runs the same distance? The low stub conductors look a little longer than the top stub route. Our local inspector would bust our chops if the runs were different lengths.
cableporn,32qqz5,Willycom,5,Thu Apr 16 03:17:53 2015 UTC,"Seriously? Yes, it even states in the code book that the conductors should be as close to the exact same length as you can get, but in reality that little bit means nothing. The wire are rarely, if ever, going to see anywhere close to full load on them.   And do you really think that the POCO guys hooking up the wires in the street transformer are making sure all of their runs are the same length? Hell no, all they are doing is making them as neat and short as they can. Or if it's a pole mount transformer, do you think they are measuring off their drip loops to make sure they are the exact same length? Not in a million years.   Don't be that guy who comes in and says they could do it better."
cableporn,32qqz5,ithinarine,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:22:13 2015 UTC,"I was just stating that the inspector in my area would point something like that out. I have re-read my first post and see that no where did I say that I could do it better, just that working with 500 is a fight. Having a ball busting inspector keeps you on your toes and makes you think and look at everything twice. I couldn't care less what the lineman do on there stuff, they are professionals and know what they're doing.  What they do is not gonna affect my passing a final and getting paid.   Of course they aren't ever going to probably see full load, and the possible slight difference isn't going to have any affect on the install. But if the code book says it, and the inspector calls you on it, you don't have much of an option."
cableporn,32qqz5,Willycom,0,Thu Apr 16 05:23:47 2015 UTC,Parallel runs absolutely have to be the same length. If POCO wants to melt their cables that is up to them.

cableporn,32qqz5,6matguy6,1 point,Thu Apr 16 08:52:49 2015 UTC,Do you have a source for that?
cableporn,32qqz5,ejkofusa,1 point,Thu Apr 16 11:29:52 2015 UTC,"I cannot find a source for my jurisdiction but will ask around.     But how do you guarantee the differences in cables after it goes through 90s that you don't know what way they have twisted and have a shorter distance in the pipe unless you are using a resistance tester (which I've yet to see someone do) before terminating. I've done at least 10 parallel services and we've done nothing more than cut the same length off of both ends which have us as close as possible to the same. And when the digital meters got plugged in and the loads applied, they were all still balanced.  Edit: formatting"
cableporn,32qqz5,6matguy6,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:14:50 2015 UTC,"You're right in theory. But in reality, with the size wire you're allowed to parallel, it doesn't really matter if one wire on a paralell run is 6 inches longer than another. That's why the code states you can't paralell anything smaller than a 1/0. When you start getting into the resistances of smaller wires 6 inches can make a big difference, but not so much with big wire."
cableporn,32qqz5,sparks277,1 point,Sat Apr 18 23:51:33 2015 UTC,"Ya, because one set of cables cable pulling 51% of the load and the other pulling 49% is going to cause one set to melt."

cableporn,32mopu,Rexxhunt,11,Wed Apr 15 01:34:33 2015 UTC,Are you sure that splice case is done correctly?  I'm pretty sure you need to fill half of it with rainwater and spiders and the other half with silicon.  Once that is complete you need to wreck 1/3 of the pairs and finish it off by wrapping it in plastic shit and call it a day.

cableporn,32mopu,savyur,3,Wed Apr 15 02:55:06 2015 UTC,what is this?
cableporn,32mopu,a_leon,6,Wed Apr 15 09:07:05 2015 UTC,It is a splice case (boot).Telephone cable can't be made in lengths long enough to support our geography. When one cable ends you splice it to the next cable. There can be 100's of pairs in some cases. Don't fret though there is a universal 25 pair color code that sorts out the whole thing. The gel is a waterproofing mechanism which is a giant pain in the ass but necessary.
cableporn,32mopu,shea241,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:05:29 2015 UTC,"Just to add to this: looks like this is a smaller cable, looks to only be a 200 pair."

cableporn,32mopu,blacknight75,6,Wed Apr 15 03:45:59 2015 UTC,Please explain.  I have always wondered what was done inside these 'capsules'.  Is it a bunch of splices?  What is the gel you speak of and how does the next person deal with it?
cableporn,32mopu,fateislosthope,3,Wed Apr 15 05:10:51 2015 UTC,This splice case is from 3m. It is just a bunch of splices. The gel is a two part mixture that self sets and solidifies within about an hour I believe. The splice cases are designed to be water proof and not really too serviceable. We've never had a problem with one. You can order extra gel bags so I'm sure you could pick the gel out and replace it if need be.

cableporn,32e8xp,rtra9631,15,Mon Apr 13 02:12:20 2015 UTC,"It looks like there are two runs in parallel.   So, not an electrician: I have a question. I work in the entertainment industry. 400A disconnects are fairly typical. I've always been told (and according to manufacture specs) that 4/0 feeder can handle 405A. But this comment prompted me to check NEC code and it clearly states that 4/0 is rated for 260A with a 90°C jacket. Why the huge difference? I assume it has to do with running through conduit and fires, whereas with a temporary setup, this is as much of a concern."
cableporn,32e8xp,AshamedGorilla,13,Mon Apr 13 03:08:43 2015 UTC,"The 4/0 feeder cable you are referring to gets a ""free air rating"" laid out on the ground.

cableporn,32e8xp,ejkofusa,10,Mon Apr 13 03:52:13 2015 UTC,Table 400.5(A)(2) is where the 405A number comes from. And only if it's a single conductor cable of certain types.
cableporn,32e8xp,electriple,2,Mon Apr 13 05:48:43 2015 UTC,"But you have to use 310.15(B)(16) for these cables keeping the rating at 75 degrees or less. 400.5 is for cords which some have a much higher rating that NM, TH, XH...  310.15(B)(7) is what you use to factor residential services."

Each of 4 bedrooms got a dozen 20A outlets, four of which were on their own independent breakers for possible use with medical equipment (He had very elderly parents, and wanted this capacity in case it was needed - all of the outlets throughout the house were special hospital grade).  Additionally, there were two separate lighting circuits put in the ceiling for each bedroom, a lighted ceiling fan on one and recessed lights on the other.  Not to mention the switched wall outlets for floor and table lamps, and the switched power strips under the window trim as ""candle outlets.""  The homeowner had organized the power and lighting circuits so every room would have at least 2 dedicated outlets and fan/light combo working off the gen-set.  The HVAC, refrigerators, dishwasher, laundry, and an emergency well were also on the emergency generator.  Anyway, we filled three 400A panels - one of which was tied to the gen-set.

cableporn,32a4oc,MarineTECH08,15,Sat Apr 11 23:41:54 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, so normally a boat this size has multiple battery banks with multiple charge sources. For example. 1000 AH lithium ion house bank, generator start battery, engine start battery, and thruster bank in this case. Charge sources on this boat include an 140 amp alternator with external regulator and isolator. Depending on battery type we need to set up differnt chargers, Inverters, solar ect. Happy to explain this system on proper detail if anyone cares. What your missing here is the DC motor for the thruster in the fwd locker.the box in the middle is a variable speed controller. I can give a very long answer as to why you wouldn't want any sort of engine for supply. On this size of boat power managment is key, and consist of almost all DC power. Also on this bank is the windless. So the conceptnis the only time the loads, windless and thruster, can be used is when the alternator is charging the system. This system will be able to run for about 8 years maitence free, as the batteries are sealed AGM, making it very economical."

cableporn,32a4oc,RulerOf,2,Sun Apr 12 17:27:47 2015 UTC,"Depends on the type of insulation and stranding.  If its welding or battery cable, its much easier because of the nature of the cable.  This type of cable is made up of many strands of fine wire.  Standard distribution cable (type THHN for example) used for large AC power services, would be a major pain to work with.  It has far fewer strands of wire and are much larger.  Ive worked with cable like this in the past and to make tight bends with it, sometimes a conduit bender is needed.  Nice work.  The braided sleeves on the cables, is it polyester or nylon?"

cableporn,32a4oc,fake--name,3,Sun Apr 12 03:16:25 2015 UTC,First time I have seen sheathing like that on marine wire.  Usually it is the plastic wrap...or nothing other then the normal wire rubber.
cableporn,32a4oc,Protocol2319,3,Sun Apr 12 01:23:23 2015 UTC,"Looking at the heatshrink over the sheathing and the battery terminals, and the colorization peeping through, I'd assume that the OP installed it themselves, rather then it being stock. It's probably standard insulation beneath it."
cableporn,32a4oc,jbranscum,2,Sun Apr 12 01:36:42 2015 UTC,What's with the braided sleeves?
cableporn,32a4oc,Cj145,2,Sun Apr 12 02:03:28 2015 UTC,"Mostly looks.  Sleeves like that don't do much for abrasion resistance but are great for bundles.  Hope they are not nylon, sulfuric acid dissolves nylon.  Even though those batteries are sealed, sulfuric acid fumes will escape and combine with moisture in air to make sulfuric acid that will collect on surfaces."
cableporn,32a4oc,NoRemorse920,2,Sun Apr 12 21:22:46 2015 UTC,Why would they have an electric bow thruster on battery operation?  Whats keeping those batteries topped off? CPP or is there a VFD on the other side of a rectifier?  How big is the wheel?
cableporn,32a4oc,jbranscum,9,Sun Apr 12 02:37:24 2015 UTC,"Usually because the motor pulls more current than the charging system can provide, or to allow function to continue if the main engine cuts. This allows use of a stronger thruster for longer than it would take to drain the main battery/bank. It  can also be made separate from the main system."
cableporn,32a4oc,mrpesky,5,Sun Apr 12 03:11:37 2015 UTC,"Seems like an obvious reason, surge capacity.  Edit: cable porn is filled with a lot of network and communication guys, so maybe it's not that obvious."
cableporn,32a4oc,NoRemorse920,1 point,Sun Apr 12 03:17:18 2015 UTC,"Its not really that obvious.. why not just have an engine/generator capable of providing the power?  I'm a ship captain, this DC setup is entirely unfamiliar to me."
cableporn,32a4oc,meltingdiamond,4,Sun Apr 12 03:28:22 2015 UTC,"I presume this is on something like a 50 ft sailing yacht, which would possible only have a 100 HP engine running an 80 amp alternator. Certainly not enough current to run the bow thruster, but since they are only used sporadically when docking, the batteries do the work, then are charged by the engine/power from the dock."
cableporn,32a4oc,broam,4,Sun Apr 12 03:57:08 2015 UTC,"I'm an engineer, and while ships themselves may not be obvious to me, solutions to problems are. Adding a buffer for surge usage (electrical, production lines, plumbing, etc...) Is often more economical and more efficient than up-sizing every component.  I do industrial robotics. Our robots handle product. When the robot has to handle a different task, we accumulate product and handle it when the robot frees up with the robot's excess capacity. If we didn't spend $20k on zero pressure accumulation conveyors, we'd have to spend $100k on another robot cell to handle the surge capacity. Not only is the first solution less expensive, but it takes up less floor space.   We do the same for air using local accumulation tanks for situations where we have high consumption pneumatic devices that are only occasionally run. This keeps us from sinking thousands into a dedicated compressor to meet the very short instantaneous demands.  Lastly, we do this with the electrical systems with capacitors to meet surge demand for components.  All I am saying is that in general, this local storage is very often an optimal solution for surge usage. I don't know the specifics here, or the requirements, but this sort of thing (bring ignorant on what's common on boats/ships) looks logical to me."
cableporn,32a4oc,Protocol2319,3,Sun Apr 12 04:06:03 2015 UTC,"why not just have an engine/generator capable of providing the power?    The same reason particle accelerator have capacitor banks. You can make a power source that can continuously power something with a very high pulsed power draw but you have to pay for it.   You pay for this big generator in cash(big generators cost $$$), in weight(big generators are heavy), in fuel(big generators use more fuel even at idle), and in space(big generators are big).  On a ship where every single one of these factors is an even bigger issue then something land based you want to have the least engine you can get away with so you install some really really nice batteries and skate past the problems nicely at the cost of increased cycle time for your high draw thruster."

Your line 2 main lead is too short to see the tip. I'm willing to bet $10 that you didn't use a torque wrench to terminate that aluminum. Leads are pretty inconsistent lengths, and some are too long. Seem to be having trouble getting your wires straight?  Try using double sided clear tape on the back of the panel, and setting each wire in place."
cableporn,31xf0u,redditmoose,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:36:38 2015 UTC,"I think you need to upload a picture of one of your panels since you have a lot to say about someone else's.  If you really want to prove your point, upload a video of torquing your lugs as well, because unless you're doing something that's been engineered at amperage, you're probably not torquing every single lug.  Also, every breaker has torque ratings too, do you carry a inch pound screwdriver to torque your breakers?  What about terminal strips?  I think you're just talking shit."

I use Wera's Series 7400 to torque panel mains and anything I must touch that's aluminum because of the impressively long list of panel fires caused by aluminum mains.  I use my cordless drill settings to torque breakers, screws on receptacles, and switches after having determined the correct torque last year.  My post was mostly out of concern for that aluminum because of its much larger thermal expansion coefficient, and its tendency to microfracture and crack.  This is especially relevant for lines installed here in Canada in the winter, but it's true generally."

(6 rooms total) there is also additional ones for AP's. i also have speaker cabeling for SONOs for the patio, Dinning room, Exercise room, and media room. in the rack is just networking (POE for two AP's, Switch, Router, wireless AP for the wireless cameras) i sold off all the large and in charge shit that was in the previous rack. *Drops go from my basement through a old laundry shoot that i went through to get to the attic, then down into each room.  Tools is quite a few Basics (Drill, Fishing sticks, Electrical tape, Little flags you mark utilities in your yard with - i used those to drill a SMALLLLL hole in the ceiling where i needed the drop to go, then push the flag through so you can find it in the attic) there is some other things like punch down tools, coax tools, CABLE TESTER!!, a good back for hunching in the attic for a couple hours, a good friend to help pull) yeah i plan on adding some other fun stuff i've got in the works, thats why i ran extra Carlon Tubes for future proofing the whole sha-bang. in the panel's i have a lot of room for if i want to add extra camera stuff *Leviton makes Beautiful ""Structured Media"" cabinets and devices to go inside (Get ready to open your pocket book though, my Cable splitter is $350) Monoprice for CAT6, coax, and speaker wire. *mistakes were doing it the first time, then having to redo the damn thing.

I'm also piecing together parts for a home automation system (Insteon is what I've bought into for now), but for the most part that is whole different beast and won't intermingle with the structured wiring project.  Before you went for Sonos, did you check out any of the other ""Whole Home Audio"" solutions like OnQ or Nuvo? Most of those systems will even fit nicely in a structured wiring panel.

It also looks like CAT6 is no longer manufactured with a spline, essentially making it equal to Cat5e.  The spline was used to separate the twisted pairs to cut down on xtalk.  current Next technology makes the performance difference between cat5e and Cat6 negligible.  It also speaks of 5e being tested rated at 400Mhz.  Which is higher than the standard for Cat6.    If you really want to 'future proof' your cable plant, Cat7 is the future."

Is it just like, a reaaaly big router so you can connect an entire school to a single network connection? Doesn't ""splitting"" the signal coming from the ""outside world"" lower the quality significantly? And where would a firewall fit into this configuration?"
cableporn,313mgb,douchecanoo,3,Thu Apr 2 04:01:57 2015 UTC,"In this picture there's only patch panels and switches  A patch panel is similar to a wall jack. Cable runs that go throughout the building have one side that terminates at the wall jack, and the other side terminates at the back of the patch panel. Those are most of the blue cables in this picture  A switch, to put it simply, is a device that can aggregate network connections. Your home router is actually a router that has an integrated switch. On routers, generally speaking only one interface can exist on one network. To allow home users to have more devices, they integrated a switch into those tiny boxes.  If you want to look up the OSI model, most switches operate at Layer 2 and deal with MAC addresses. Routers work at Layer 3 and deal with IP addresses. Now there are a multitude of exceptions, but that's the jist of it  The patch panels connect to the switch, so every computer ends up being connected to the switch in the end. The switch then has an uplink (the teal and orange fiber in this case) which connects to the core routing segment where big beefy routers figure out what goes where  A firewall would be installed at the edge of the network, between the ISP and the edge router (and a DMZ would be attached too if there is one). However, routers can filter traffic too based on access control lists to control access on the internal network"
cableporn,313mgb,Rothaga,2,Thu Apr 2 04:26:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply!  I can't say I fully understand yet, but I'm at least doing more research now.  I was doing some reading on Patch Panels, and this diagram on Wikipedia has me a bit confused. My understanding is that the switch would be connected to a firewall (facing a DMZ or the internet). First question, why can't the computers plug directly into that switch? Second question, why are 2 patch panels needed? If the computers can't be connected directly to the switch, then why are they not connected to the first patch panel?"
cableporn,313mgb,douchecanoo,3,Thu Apr 2 05:08:15 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that the switch would be connected to a firewall   The switches would be connected to a router, and one of the many routers on the network would be connected to the firewall. The firewall seperates the outside, DMZ, and inside networks from each other. Since only a portion of the inside computers are connected to this switch, the switch must be connected to either another switch or a router  As for the diagram, it's a bit different than what the OP has. I'm actually not sure what that diagram is trying to convey, as you can't just ""unify"" 5 connections into one on a patch panel. If you take a look at a patch panel, for every port on the front is a place for you to crimp one corresponding wire on the back. Hell, I'll say it, that diagram is flat out wrong  Here's an ELI5 diagram I made to try to explain (1000 hours in MS Paint)  http://imgur.com/09CFCyG  Actually this is easier to understand. Computers plug into wall jacks. Wall jacks have cable runs that go to patch panel. Each connection on the patch panel connects to switch. Switch connects to router at the bottom  http://nettech.webs.com/photos/Business/business%20network%20setup.jpg"

cableporn,313mgb,porkchopnet,2,Thu Apr 2 15:02:35 2015 UTC,"That wikipedia image is a poor representation.  Typically, you have a wall plate in the room with the computer with 1-4 jacks in it... one jack per device in the room. One cable per jack goes from that wall plate to a patch panel inside the local ""IDF"", like what OP's picture is.   The patch panel then connects to the switch. Why a patch panel? Isolation for troubleshooting and cleanliness are really top reasons...  Imagine you put 4 jacks in each room for future growth but only want to make two of those ports live (because you don't have the extra $35k you'd need to get enough switchports for every room to have 4 live drops). What do you do with the rest of the cable, and how do you neatly put it away so that you can quickly find and patch up Room 211 drop 3 because Mrs Sonso got a new printer? Are you going to un-loom an entire trunk of cable, find the one you need, pull it out, reloom the rest, then route the 211-3 cable properly? Not unless cable management is your full time job."

Whenever me and friends didn't do the homework, we'd go through to the server room and quickly shift around as many of the cables as we could, usually shutting off IT for the whole school for the rest of the day. This progressed until one time somebody who wasn't friends with us decided to do it alone without a lookout, and ended up being caught and subsequently blamed for the whole fiasco which at that point had been going on for months. Looking back on it we were actually a right load of little bastards."

cableporn,30wvu9,th82,7,Tue Mar 31 14:36:29 2015 UTC,Splicer snips (Klein Tools 2100-9 my fav)are popular but any cutting tool will work. The lengths are done one termination at a time by putting the cable where it needs to be and then cutting that length. It takes a little bit of practice but as you can see you will get plenty of practice doing data wiring. So many wires....

The un-jacketed cross connect cable used has the same twist as standard cat-6, but you have to be a bit more careful to ensure you keep the untwisting to a minimum when you punch down.  If performance is a huge concern, then there are patch cables designed for these blocks that will perform at or better than Cat6 specs.

I also doubt this is for DMX as I know from my install experience that ETC and other manufacturers who specify DMX over Ethernet protocols tend to frown upon making patch panels like this and would MUCH prefer you use a standard patch panel with a Professional grade Managed switch in the middle, no direct patches. They would never spec a panel like this from the factory as it doesn't allow for re-patching with any ease whatsoever.  My guess would be if this is located somewhere near the control booth or back stage that this is not used for any IP Protocol and possibly used for a custom protocol for something like Rigging Automation or possibly ClearCom/RTS/Telex."

cableporn,30q8hs,HabaneroNinja,9,Sun Mar 29 20:50:20 2015 UTC,These are giga-bix blocks. They can actually support cat6 speeds (and higher I think). So you can run things a lot faster than phone and fax. Regular bix blocks are for phone usually.
cableporn,30q8hs,cptsir,7,Sun Mar 29 21:44:15 2015 UTC,Have you used these before? I have never seen them. How do they support cat6 speeds with all those unjacketed wires touching?  I would think there would be too much crosstalk or whatever go get those types of speed?
cableporn,30q8hs,LtTentacle,2,Sun Mar 29 21:59:36 2015 UTC,"I've used bix and been around giga-bix, but I've never actually installed giga-bix. The reason these are different from standard bix is because the interior construction and materials prevent cross talk which would normally be terrible in a standard bix block.  Disclaimer: I'm not actually sure what the cross talk would measure in this situation - but I can speculate. Just looking at this image, I would agree that cross talk would bad from a cable touching point of view. However, they keep a very tight winding until termination, which I imagine is more important than missing the cables outer sheath because of how capacitance and inductance work."
cableporn,30q8hs,G1ant1nThe0cean,3,Sun Mar 29 22:22:08 2015 UTC,The GigaBIX strips include a pair separator that goes on the jacketed side of termination to keep crosstalk to a minimum.  I've done both Belden MDVO (Jack) terminations and GigaBix field terminations and following the manufacturer's termination procedures you'll see very similar results for cross talk/insertion loss/etc.  If there are concerns about the un-jacketed cross connect cable impacting performance there are special patch cables  (http://www.belden.com/docs/upload/DS_GigaBIX_PS6_PatchCord.pdf) that connect right off the GigaBIX Strip.

cableporn,30q8hs,BatMasterson5,2,Sun Mar 29 23:06:43 2015 UTC,"I've worked with GigaBIX in a datacenter setting the past, so I thought I'd weigh in with some stuff.   Bix vs 110. They look similar, but that is where the similarities stop. Plain old BIX was developed by Northern Telecom (became Nortel, became dead). 110 uses a knife edge against the patch panel to cut the wire, similar to how 66 did it. Bix punchdown tools actually have a tiny wire cutter scissor thing on the end that operates on the up-stroke of the punch down tool. That means that each re-termination doesn't put more cut-marks on the block. It also means the wire is cut reliably every time. There is a knob that could be rotated on the tool to lock out the cutters when so desired. Bix was also a 'system', the blocks snapped into modular frames, and there was a system of plastic D-rings that could be used to make a 'bix wall' out of a number of separate units (random GIS found this: http://www.ncomm.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/NComm-voice-BIX-block.jpg). GigaBIX had the same system, and OP's photo is actually a cheaped out install. The one that I put together was a 6 wide x 3 high configuration of 10 block modules, or 180 blocks. A 'proper' install has GigaBIX D-rings separating the panels both horizontally, and vertically, and then there's fancy metal covers that drop over the gaps created by the D-rings to cover up the patch wires. It looks kick-ass when complete. I preferred the system over plain old patch cables, because every patch cable was the right length every time. I kept a spool of cat6 GigaBIX patch wire (imagine cat6 without the jacket) by the cross connect wall. When I needed to do a cross connect, I would punch down one end, route the 'patch cable' through the D-rings, punch down the other end, which would cut my cable from the spool. Done. It made for a very neat cross-connect system. In my case, our core switches had RJ-21 ethernet ports (amphenol jacks in telco speak, the same connector used by 50-pin SCSI-1) . We were only running 100 Mbps ethernet at the time (rental dedicated servers), so a 25 pair RJ-21 could accommodate 12 ethernet ports, two pairs per port. Violet-slate did nothing. Our switch had 32 ports on each blade terminated on three RJ-21 connectors. From those we ran 3x 25 pair cat 5 cables (about 1/2"" diameter, and a 6 inch bend radius) to the BIX wall, 48 in total, I think. Those terminated on the back of one set of BIX blocks. The racks (30 servers each) had rack mounted BIX <-> RJ-45 patch panels at the top that terminated 3x 25 pair cat 5 cables, the other end of which was terminated on the BIX wall, on the back of another set of blocks. All of the per-server ross-connects were done on the front of the blocks. I got very good at my 25 pair colour code doing all of those terminations. It was handy when switch blades started to die: unplug three big connectors, swap the blade, plug three connectors back in.   Interesting times. As the company grew, I got to go through two more iterations of datacenter network cabling, life got easier when we could afford good top-of-rack switches, and fiber or twin-ax everywhere."

cableporn,30pt1h,MightyMike_GG,5,Mon Mar 30 12:05:12 2015 UTC,You should use a rope cutter to cut the ends of the sleeving and terminate it either with a tie wrap or a small piece of color matched heat-shink tubing. You might also want to to look at wire loom for your other runs. A great source for these kinds of products that would be close to you is cableorganizer.

cableporn,30k2ax,GorillaonWheels,2,Sat Mar 28 10:53:19 2015 UTC,"None of our cables have any earth protection in them. Some of our junction boxes on poles have modules like in OP's picture which are then (sometimes) linked to a ground/earth that runs down the pole.

If it was as easy as just swapping a short length, I completely agree with you, but I rarely see where that can be the case.

The modern demarcation point is the network interface device (NID) or intelligent network interface device (INID) also known as a ""smartjack"".  The NID is the telco's property. The NID may be outdoors (typically, mounted on the building exterior in a weatherproof box) or indoors.  The NID is usually placed for easy access by a technician. It also contains a lightning arrestor, fuse and test circuitry which allows the carrier to remotely test whether a wiring fault lies in the customer premises or in the carrier wiring, without requiring a technician at the premises. The demarcation point has a user accessible RJ-11 jack (a ""test jack"" or ""demarcation jack""), which is connected directly to the telephone network, and a small loop of telephone cord connecting to the jack by a modular connector.

cableporn,3090ei,lookatthatsquirrel,3,Wed Mar 25 19:50:26 2015 UTC,What is the purpose of the curl?
cableporn,3090ei,obtix,10,Wed Mar 25 16:10:43 2015 UTC,"A GFCI breaker works by checking for a ground fault across the circuit. It can only do this is if the neutral for the circuit is isolated. So instead of landing the circuit's neutral on the neutral bar, you land it on the GFCI breaker, and the breaker has it's own neutral connection (the coiled wire) that connects to the neutral bar. There's no actual purpose to the coil. You can cut the conductor shorter, but most electricians don't to facilitate changes in the panel at a later time.  Edit: The grey colored breakers are most likely AFCI breakers (Arc Fault Circuit Interruptors). They terminate the same way."
cableporn,3090ei,hollaverga,3,Wed Mar 25 17:06:08 2015 UTC,Thank you! I've been contemplating installed AFCI breakers on a few circuits in my panel so this helps.
cableporn,3090ei,obtix,2,Wed Mar 25 17:19:03 2015 UTC,"No problem. The biggest challenge you'll probably face is making sure the neutrals that are currently landed on the neutral bar will be long enough to make it to the AFCI breaker's neutral termination. You may home to rearrange the breakers and circuits a little bit to get the length you need. Then just be wary of the length of the hot conductor too, so you don't move a breaker closer to the neutral and then the hot won't reach.  Also, of course, please shut off the power and work extra safely."
cableporn,3090ei,hollaverga,2,Thu Mar 26 14:54:05 2015 UTC,Someone smarter than me will have to answer that one.
cableporn,3090ei,kerklein2,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:46:48 2015 UTC,"I""m not really sure.  I've installed GFCI with just a short neutral comparator line and seen no issues.  Perhaps those breakers like to have a bit of resistance on the stub line or they trip too easy?  It looks like he's trying to keep extra service length in there overall, as the lines coming it at the sides are given service loops while the top lines aren't."

cableporn,3090ei,redditmoose,4,Wed Mar 25 14:33:13 2015 UTC,"When running network cables, you keep the outter insulation on until it needs to be stripped to expose the inner wires. With power, it's stripped as soon as it enters the box. Why not keep it on? Seems it would make it neater and require less work."
cableporn,3090ei,hollaverga,11,Wed Mar 25 15:06:59 2015 UTC,"The individual wires all go to different places in an electrical panel.  With data cables, all the individual wires usually terminate at the same spot.  However, the main reason you keep the insulation on data cables until the last possible moment is RF shielding.  Even if the data cables are not shielded, leaving the insulation on still has a small effect on the capacitance of the wire, and hence overall bandwidth.  Also, leaving the shielding on makes it less likely that the pairs will untwist and change the electrical characteristics of the wire."
cableporn,3090ei,ikidd,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:05:36 2015 UTC,Or that you'll accidentally switch your pairs.
cableporn,3090ei,ikidd,3,Sat Mar 28 05:22:08 2015 UTC,"It's because the conductors are going to different locations in the panel. It's easier and neater to route the conductors if they are separated at the entrance to the panel. With networking cables you must keep them grouped together until the termination point to keep up the integrity of the connection. And with networking connections like Cat5 all the conductors terminate right next to each other either on a jack, plug, or patch panel."
cableporn,3090ei,whatnoreally,5,Wed Mar 25 17:12:38 2015 UTC,"Because the lines go to different spots entirely when in the box.  You'll see the neutral lines go to the right side and the grounds go left, while the power goes to the breaker.  One of the reasons network cables aren't stripped back is that the wires all get punched down right at the same connector, and the closer you start to unwrap  twists, the less noise you get on the line.  No noise issues with power so it's easier to just make a bar for the common lines."
cableporn,3090ei,liquoranwhores,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:14:39 2015 UTC,"You may already know this, but I figured I'd respond to your comment anyway so that others can be informed.  Untwisting more than necessary will make the connection more susceptible to noise, but you'd have to untwist quite a lot to make that measurable.  The more critical reasons to leave the twists intact are:  1) Crosstalk.  The pairs are twisted at different amounts to maximize the decoupling of signals from the other pairs in the bundle.  2) Impedance differential.  Untwisting the pairs creates a change in impedance, which causes some of the electrical signal to reflect instead of being transmitted through the connector (the connector also creates an impedance mismatch, as there is no such thing as a perfect connector).  This reduces bandwidth and decreases the S/N ratio, which obviously becomes more and more important at higher network speeds."

In Canada both of those bars are the neutral and the ground bars are bolted directly to the tub. You are correct in that at the service entrance the ground is bonded to the neutral. That bond is only to be done once and that is only at the service entrance. In lots of panels that I have worked on in the US the grounds and neutrals have been terminated side by each on the same bar. This leads to interesting situations if you end up losing a ground or a neutral on an individual circuit."

cableporn,2zs3qu,Ivanjacob,18,Sat Mar 21 14:51:13 2015 UTC,What I've always wanted to know is how were mod chips created. How did they work and why so many connections?  Was the modchip faking responses of authenticity back to a controller chip thus enabling pirate copies to work and if so why so many connections?  Did the console manufacturers deliberately make it such a difficult task ie they had thought about how hackers could get around the checks?
cableporn,2zs3qu,pawoodward,63,Sat Mar 21 08:00:10 2015 UTC,"The older consoles - pre-PS3/360 - had no intentional protection at all against modchips. More recent consoles do, however - but sometimes it's kinda ineffective (see: re-flashing the drive firmware on a 360).   The PS2, as you see pictured here, is being attacked over the memory interface. That's no longer possible on newer consoles solely due to the interface speed - you can't just solder long irregular wires to it and get it to work. The XBox has had several hacks that were injected over debugging ports left in. The PS1 had modchips that you could just plug into the parallel accessory port on the back; they probably had full memory access, and could overwrite the protection code.  No clue about the PS4 and Xbone, though - who cares about consoles when you have /r/pcmasterrace?"
cableporn,2zs3qu,ovnr,14,Sat Mar 21 11:03:14 2015 UTC,"There was a mod for the 360 later in life, I think it was called the ""reset glitch"" by the modding scene, where you could get the console to boot with extremely slow timings so you could do similar intercepts like this. It didn't really take off as much as the JTAG exploit and nowhere near as huge as the drive firmware mods.  Then you have the PS3 where Sony pissed off some Linux users who then found that they were fucking stupid and didn't bother changing the random seed for their private key..."
cableporn,2zs3qu,ERIFNOMI,5,Sat Mar 21 12:29:21 2015 UTC,The RGH (Reset Glitch Hack) is now the most popular for the 360 because it works on all devices (I think besides the really old ones) and is the most reliable.

cableporn,2zs3qu,ERIFNOMI,2,Sat Mar 21 15:22:07 2015 UTC,"Very true. I only know so much about it because after I got my Xbox One, I was researching what could be done with a 360."

So, they took away the ability to install Linux, which pissed off some hacker-types who ended up gaining full access through other means which lead to piracy. Great job Sony."

The white cables are likely connections to remote ports ( Desk PC ports, Server ports in racks etc.. ) These wont change.   However, the thing that may change is what server, what switch, what the end of the cable you want it connecting to may change.

cableporn,2zm6fq,guest13,6,Fri Mar 20 12:40:06 2015 UTC,My only recommendation is to cut the velcro in half long-ways. It looks better when its smaller and cleaner that way and you can wrap it tighter. Looks combed nicely though. Good job!
cableporn,2zm6fq,vivlav144,3,Fri Mar 20 04:08:47 2015 UTC,"I think with such short and controlled runs you could get rid of the Velcro all together ( don't get me wrong I love Velcro, but sometimes it's just a pain in the long run)"

cableporn,2zm6fq,clickwir,1 point,Fri Mar 20 14:17:55 2015 UTC,"It's home user grade equipment.   I like to imagine the equipment failed, how do you answer the client when they start questioning when they'll be back up, why it failed and why didn't you solve this problem before it happened.   For example, the HP 1810-24gV2 is around $240. No fans, lifetime warranty, managed interface, well established, reliable and HP is a high profile IT company that isn't going anywhere. Who's TPLink? Other than some consumer grade junk on websites, I've never heard of them.   How much do you save by going with the TPLink? Does that difference seem acceptable when the equipment has failed and they are down, loosing money and loosing faith in your IT abilities... Then you have to see if there's a warranty, hope it's still good and try contacting and working with a consumer grade company that doesn't care about your situation."

cableporn,2zhhv8,Viceroy_Fizzlebottom,2,Wed Mar 18 20:55:49 2015 UTC,"Cost. Ethernet is cheap and easy to run even between racks - consider 24 cables, 15m length @ $1/m (cost of cable and labour) is only $360. Patch panel is only $40, so that's $440.

cableporn,2zhhv8,shmerk-a-berl,11,Wed Mar 18 17:40:11 2015 UTC,Most of the pics on this subreddit seem to be structured cabling (think panel -> panel). Cabling that goes in and doesn't come out until either the entire cabinet is decommissioned or the entire data center is.
cableporn,2zhhv8,chriszuma,16,Wed Mar 18 19:48:32 2015 UTC,"Such a stupid argument, it would be a pain regardless of how the bundles were held together.  And that's even if you'd have to ""change one wire out,"" which is something that would more than likely never happen."
cableporn,2zhhv8,perpetualjon,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:54:32 2015 UTC,"Clearly you have never worked on a server rack. with Velcro I can take one loop off at a time pulling the single cable out then put that same piece of Velcro back on. saving resources, time, and the risk of cutting a wire when you're removing the cable ties."
cableporn,2zhhv8,ryanknapper,-3,Wed Mar 18 18:59:25 2015 UTC,"Not really dude. You can quickly take one velcro strip off, place the cable in perfectly, and then replace the same velcro strip. So much easier than cutting every single ziptie off and then replacing them all and having to cut down each and every one. Zipties are practically worthless for dressing cable.  Edit: Not to mention they're sharp as fuck."
cableporn,2zhhv8,a_tallguy,10,Wed Mar 18 19:25:13 2015 UTC,They're only sharp if you cut them wrong. If it's a permanent-ish installation I think zip-ties are cheaper and easier.
cableporn,2zhhv8,XxAExX,0,Wed Mar 18 19:47:27 2015 UTC,"That last shot (with all the zip ties) is an interesting approach to a punch-down patch panel. I'd be worried about making any repairs or troubleshooting an installation like that but I've installed many that just run the cables divided to each side but would be slightly less painful to separate to do a repair or test a single cable (like running a toner). I like patch panels that give a good few inches of individual cable running straight out of the back so I can isolate each run if I need to run tone or make an individual repair (like the patch panel above this one). Although, if this is a fully tested and qualified network, I'd be fairly confident that those cables will never be touched again until the building is torn down!"

cableporn,2ywkx1,EmcOnTheRocks,8,Fri Mar 13 14:50:14 2015 UTC,My guess based on the size of the coax is 800MHz public safety. There are likely antennas all around that tower and they trunk into a Voter system below.
cableporn,2ywkx1,SherSlick,7,Fri Mar 13 15:21:05 2015 UTC,Hello fellow LMR guy. There had to be some here.   Voter antennas on a P25 trunked system is a good possibility.

We almost always use a 1x32; but there have been times where I'm 45000 feet out, with a dozen splices in the fiber, and the optical loss budget has been exceeded. Those situations are few and far between but I'll use a 1x16 if I have to.  Usually, if I'm that far out, I'll try to place a remote OLT to reduce the loop to the customer so I can use a 1x32 splitter.  I don't work in many rural areas, so I don't get a ton of USF projects.

cableporn,2yvt9y,_-yoshi-_,2,Fri Mar 13 13:59:19 2015 UTC,I used 4 15A thermoelectrics and haven't found a more cost effective way to get that much amperage at 12v.
cableporn,2yvt9y,OnceUponNeverNever,2,Sat Mar 14 02:03:31 2015 UTC,The other microcontroller looking thing is an LCD module. The arduino activates thermoelectric elements and a pump in a water circulation loop via the relay blocks. On top of the arduino I wired some voltage dividers to feed temperature measurements to it.
cableporn,2yvt9y,th82,6,Sat Mar 14 02:00:17 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll bite, what is this?"
cableporn,2yvt9y,javi404,4,Fri Mar 13 15:14:41 2015 UTC,Some sort of cooling apparatus
cableporn,2yvt9y,rrab,1 point,Sat Mar 14 00:12:07 2015 UTC,/u/th82 is right. Rig that pumps liquid through a cooling block with a bunch of thermoelectric elements attached to it. Thermistors feed temperature measurements to an arduino and it actuates relays connected to the thermoelectrics to modulate temperature.

cableporn,2yh0iq,points4participation,2,Mon Mar 9 22:11:10 2015 UTC,The most important part is upgrading the boot code and software version. Just that alone will take you like 45 minutes. The SG500's are very buggy if you don't.

cableporn,2yh0iq,darkwing03,2,Mon Mar 9 20:01:54 2015 UTC,"Why would racking 3 switches and connecting patch cables take more than an hour?  The most time consuming thing about re cabling a cab is mapping everything out, which ports are on what vlans etc (assuming you're starting in an environment that's undocumented, but verifying the documentation takes time too). In this case it looks like 1:1 patch to switchport and the cable organisation and lack of colour coding suggests no VLAN configs. So an hour sounds about right to me"

cableporn,2yake9,PureMDC,1 point,Sun Mar 8 07:40:06 2015 UTC,As per Canadian Electrical Code 50%. It would just be considered as conductors in a race way. Because they are touching each other they lose any free air rating. Table 5C #of conductors is greater than 43 therefore correction factor is .50
cableporn,2yake9,m1stertim,1 point,Sun Mar 8 17:38:51 2015 UTC,Per NEC it's 40% I believe.  But I've never dealt with DC so I wasn't sure if the rules were different... I'd think that it'd be a lot easier to leave separation rather than running twice the wire necessary.

We want smart people (admittedly, preferably with some relevant experience) who can learn and do things. When we look at developers having open source showing the awesome things you can build is great - it shows us all that.  School? Yeah we don't care. I don't think paying money to a college necessarily reflects how smart a person is at all.

Beyond that: the blade constraints on bandwidth, drive space, single points of failure, and overall heat are issues for most applications though. Last we looked, at certain hardware performance points it's also more expensive in that form factor.  That being said, we did consider FC630s in FX2s for the web tier in Denver - but we probably won't go that direction. The 1/8th models coming out soon have some possible uses, though."

I then moved into a medium sized company owned by a large enterprise which transitioned into a senior role at the enterprise, then here.   I would say figure out what you enjoy and then keep pushing and working towards that (mmm super generic advice :)   Basically it boils down to write as much code as you can, always try to learn new skills and try to move into more advanced positions as the opportunities present themselves."

I then spent 5 years as the ""IT Guy"" at a small 5 person company where I got to play with everything available in Technet/MSDN. Before long I was managing AD, DNS, IIS, and SQL servers for the company, as well as helping do QA testing on their software product. After college I moved up to Software Engineer - Integration and Testing in a Linux shop (still mostly QA, but I also managed the dev/test lab and did a lot of automation) followed by Software Engineer - Full Stack Developer (ASP.NET, JS, SQL, TFS, VMWare, etc but with a heavy lean towards managing the build process).  Last fall I saw a Windows/Powershell position at Stack Exchange, and it just so happened to fit my skill set. I had enough Linux experience in College and a previous position to feel comfortable in a mixed environment, and a strong networking background to help troubleshoot when the sites go down.  Best advice I can give is learn as much as you can wherever you can. The Stack Exchange sites are great to motivate you to learn something new and help others (an added bonus is a public trail of work that employers can use to see your skills/interests). Also blogs and books are great resources, and if you need more structure you can go for certificates in whatever your area of interest is.   And when it comes to hardware, start with a home lab or supporting servers used for development. If you can find a mentor that helps, but I've found self motivated people with a desire to learn why/how things work and a passion for technology usually find a way to get hands on experience. Also check for College IT clubs, hackerspaces, or meetups in your area, which are great for networking and finding new opportunities."

cableporn,2y10qe,ccritter,1 point,Fri Mar 6 03:41:25 2015 UTC,Damn! And I guess a specific question would be how much space is used for the stack exchange website and database including any redundancies and separate servers
cableporn,2y10qe,gabeech,3,Fri Mar 6 03:52:50 2015 UTC,"Well we have many websites, so I'll try and break it down. The web server storage for the site is a rounding error, tens of megabytes. We're talking .net code, the CSS, the theme images, etc. Remember user images are hosted on our imgur instance, not our servers directly. Everything large is in the database.   We have 2 clusters, each have 3 identical servers.   The Stack Overflow cluster servers have a pair of 146GB 10k drives for the OS, 1x 2TB Intel P3700 PCIe NVMe SSD, and 24x 2.5"" 200GB Intel 710s in a RAID 10. We recently moved everything to the PCIe drives (since there's enough space to do so), and aren't using the 2.18TB usable on the RAID 10 (it's just an empty E drive). There are 3 databases of any size on this cluster: Stack Overflow (1.18TB including a 192GB log), PRIZM (614GB including a 216GB log), and Sites (359GB including a 117GB log). They are using 1.18TB of the 1.82TB overall.  The second SQL cluster servers have 293 databases and hosts pretty much everything else: all smaller sites, Careers, etc. They have a pair of 500GB SATA drive for the OS, 2x 2TB Intel P3700 PCIe NVMe SSD in a RAID 0, and 24x 2.5"" 1.2TB 10K drive in a RAID 10. Again we're only using that 3.64TB usable PCIe RAID 0, the 13.09TB usable RAID 10 is empty (we'll soon split some file groups for growth). The largest databases on that cluster are: Careers (193GB of which 50 is log) and TempDB (122GB of which 25 is log). Everything else is pretty small but totals up to 1.7TB of that 3.64TB overall used.  That's a breakdown of each - for totals just multiply by 3 everywhere since they're all identical. Hope that answers your question!"
cableporn,2y10qe,nhdw,2,Fri Mar 6 03:54:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that in depth reply! I'm a student who does webdesign as hobby and my databases are megabytes on shared servers haha, so seeing this type of scale is just crazy. I give mad props to whoever manages all that data and tables. Now you're running .net code so I'm assuming these are windows servers? And to think I worry about optimizing my websites for group projects for at max 12 concurrent users haha.  Edit: I also use stackexchange all the time for when I run into issues in programming"
cableporn,2y10qe,MethodH22,4,Fri Mar 6 04:12:20 2015 UTC,"That's usually me (to be clear: every dev is their own DBA, I do that and more of watch/tune everything), so thanks :)   We are on Windows for the web tier and SQL, but also have a great deal of Linux (CentOS, specifically) servers as well. For example our load balancer is HAProxy, our L2 cache (behind web tier memory) is redis, elasticsearch, exim, etc. all runs on linux. We also have service boxes running StackServer and some API endpoints on other Windows machines too...we're about an even split I'd say.  As for your 12 concurrent users: small things matter.

Did some more research into HTML5 and CSS3 standards, mixed with some google design standards and I've liked how everything is turning out.

Take any job that will let you do this. If you mean our day-to-day, our experience comes from all over so there is no magic answer there. Some guys are awesome at linux, some at windows, some at networking, some all over. We need a little bit of everything on the team.   Note: I'm a terrible example.

cableporn,2y10qe,OzOnline,2,Fri Mar 6 05:08:50 2015 UTC,Question: was the management provisioned all manually? Was there some auto-config system that you could start automatically via the network?  The few pictures I saw of the IDRAC configuration looked manual and it made me cringe.
cableporn,2y10qe,Do_the_Stu,3,Fri Mar 6 05:51:38 2015 UTC,"It was manual here. Should it be? No. But it had to be. Little did we know the Dell 13g servers ship, by default, with a static IP - it's always 192.168.0.120. That means we could only rack one server at a time effectively. It turns out you need to talk with your account rep to switch to DHCP by default. They do this ""because half their customers are in an environment where DHCP is not allowed.""  We have talked to Dell and have further requested that instead of their current configuration options: various .XML configs on a USB or via a known share, that they also support grabbing that XML via an HTTP request. It works by looking for something with its service tag specifically (e.g. abcdefg.xml), if not that then its model (e.g. R630.xml), and then falling back to a default (default.xml) on the share, for example.  We have pushed for an HTTP request doing the same that we can write a simple listening web route that grabs the config out of a shared data source that specifies how our network should be setup - for example out of our puppet hiera data or another common data store used for both. No one wants configuration duplicated in 2 places. We're working to eliminate all configuration duplication completely, and by using onePK on our Nexus gear we'll be able to configure DRACs, VLANs, etc. all via APIs with just a git checkin.  We're working on it - we have ordered hardware just to help automate provisioning even further. Once you're at PXE boot that's all automated already - we're working on automating the rest."

This isn't something I can answer completely even in a few pages of text - it needs to be a solid blog post with recent numbers for comparison. Given that Jason Harvey (formerly a reddit sysadmin) has recently joined our ranks I think it's time we write a fully fleshed out article on this with practical real-world experience on both sides.

cableporn,2y10qe,YodaLoL,0,Thu Mar 5 21:55:44 2015 UTC,"thank you, I'd be interested in that read. When you're talking about high performance applications, they are constantly releasing faster and faster processors / network / disk at AWS (c4 cpu series just released). However, building a 1.5TB of Memory / 72 core system is not possible, but I'm assuming that's for VM's anyway. If that is the case the max system you can acquire is something around 64 Cores and 128GB of memory...that should handle any processing needs one would assume. In addition, a lot of cutting edge processor-bound applications run on AWS like Netflix, etc. 100k+ IOPS is also possible, I believe it goes much higher than this as well. I don't have needs at my current position to talk shop about the performance ceilings of AWS but these are numbers I've been made aware of."

cableporn,2xyiny,k2trf,3,Tue Mar 17 20:09:10 2015 UTC,I'm tempted to take this stance as well; something can be amateur cable porn (oh god that sounds even worse now) and still be great -- the spam that occurs here is not in this category.
cableporn,2xyiny,djgizmo,1 point,Thu Mar 5 01:43:34 2015 UTC,"I agree.  As a newbie cabling human, I look at all of your excellent cabling jobs and I'm in awe."
cableporn,2xyiny,xLogisticsx,2,Thu Mar 5 10:42:28 2015 UTC,"I would also say you are being too lenient. However, my ideas of cable porn are not as strict as the complainers I see around. Sure, I agree that the recent 3 phase transformer post was not cable porn, but as a CATV technician, I find joy in seeing 5 or more coax lines well placed in a residential audit box or smart panel.  Essentially, you guys have a hard job because not everyone's standards are the same. If I had to make a suggestion, I would make the rules more strict to exclude everything but large scale cabling, boost your mod team to have near 24hr coverage, and then create a sister subreddit or two to cover other people's ideas of cable porn. /r/amateurcableporn, maybe?"
cableporn,2xyiny,Kris18,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:09:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I already gave my 2 cents a bit ago and there seems to be general agreement.  I'd like to also quote /u/Sodaxy, who explains how I feel:   IMHO you are being a bit to lenient. I'm not trying to attack anyone for their work or posts but if we look at things like this, this, this and this which are all posts with about 150-350 upvotes there are either barely any cables visible and/or the execution is sloppy at best. If we compare that to the posts that you gave as an example (here, here, here) I think anyone can agree that there is a definite decrease in quality, scale and overall execution of the cabling. Personaly I would prefer I we would come back to the ""original"" style of posts.    In their own right, those first few examples are beautiful, but they don't belong here and they definitely don't look anything like the examples you gave, /u/oh_the_humanity. To answer another question, I actually thought the moderation here was non-existant and that the team might've actually not been on Reddit at all lately or forgot the subreddit as a whole. I suppose that makes it clear I think the moderation has been way too relaxed/lenient.  Hope my feedback helps. Thanks, guys."
cableporn,2xyiny,k2trf,1 point,Sat Mar 14 13:58:29 2015 UTC,"I could say you are being too lenient, but that is only at first glance. I honestly think after something is reported (I do that every time I see such nonsense), it is removed fairly quickly -- you all have lives too.  I would like to ask which of the default report options the mod team would like such to be put in -- I usually pick spam, since it basically is when they disregard the subreddit rules like that. I spend most of my browsing time on the phone however, so I can't enter a custom one (as much as I'd like to specify which rule is being broken)."

I think you're maybe a wee bit lenient. I love neat data cabling, but I don't so much enjoy PEX tubing, conduit, or raggedy coaxial in a residential NID.

cableporn,2xrxqj,IamJacksLackOf,4,Tue Mar 3 14:14:14 2015 UTC,I like velcro 100% but with this rack it's going to be preconfigured cable lengths etc so we though the cables won't move around much but I don't know... things like cables for ASA's will be velcro because they will be moved about but the uplinks and power we thought zip tie
cableporn,2xrxqj,KlfJoat,1 point,Tue Mar 3 14:20:12 2015 UTC,"Zip ties can pinch harder than velcro at ""hand tightness"". That can lead to signal degradation on the higher end of the frequency range, and thus reduced throughput."
cableporn,2xrxqj,ProjectSnowman,5,Tue Mar 3 15:03:32 2015 UTC,"This is brought up almost every time the zip tie vs. Velcro discussion starts. Is there a source for this anywhere? Structured cable is always secured with zip ties and that never causes issues.   I'm a fan of Velcro for stuff that may move, zip ties for stuff that won't or shouldn't move."
cableporn,2xrxqj,KlfJoat,2,Tue Mar 3 16:19:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not an electrical engineer.  I could Google, but I'm afraid the best I can personally do is tell you my personal experience.    User complained of intermittent slow-downs and outages.  100Mbps Ethernet to the cubicle.  We replaced patch cables on both sides of the wall, changed ports, pegged the ports to 100, no dice.  Hooked the Fluke up, in-line, and set it to capture a day's worth of data.  Found that the headroom was getting smaller at certain times, for minutes at a time continuously, and that reduction would sometimes impact the connection.  Come to find out, whenever the user had a guest sitting in their guest chair, it pushed against the pole from the ceiling, and that squeezed the (lowest bid, Cat5) cable in the pole, causing the problems.  Extrapolating outward from that, newer (higher category) cable can take more abuse while retaining enough headroom for 200FDX or GigE to the desktop.  I wouldn't be concerned in infrastructure.  Plus, infrastructure usually gets certified after running.  But with the 10Gig FDX cables in a server rack, they are using every scrap of headroom.  I wouldn't want to run a rack full, using zip ties, and have to back even one wire out.    tl;dr An abundance of caution in rack situations."
cableporn,2xrxqj,ProjectSnowman,3,Tue Mar 3 18:34:58 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with you. When I use zip ties, I make sure I can still move the individual cables in the bundles. Stuff like power cords get zipped tight because they are so unwieldy and it shouldn't make a difference.  Fiber, Teinax, 10Gb, etc all get treated like they are wet pasta. Velcro that is just tight enough to hold it in place is all I use.  Running cable through power poles and cubicles is a nightmare. Most of the stuff has sharp turns and edges that kink the crap out Plenum rated cable."

It will likely be lost or stolen before it breaks and i assume there is a better warranty and customer service that comes with the Panduit brand."
cableporn,2xksf4,unknown_baby_daddy,6,Sun Mar 1 19:54:31 2015 UTC,"Opening up and inserting the cables in the middle of a pull is really easy with panduits comb. It slides well on the cable, not much friction. but the main reason for choosing panduit is that you can do 24 cables at a time wich most racks panels use or at least a multiple of 24.  Acom's 15 cables is a dealbreaker though.  My first one was stolen 4 days after i started using it by one of the others i worked with. Keeping it on me or locked in my toolbox from now on."

cableporn,2xg509,houtex727,4,Sat Feb 28 17:48:06 2015 UTC,"Notice how the top left set of fibers is anchored there, and the first 6 fibers immediately go into the splicing?   Ditto the other side?    That's not how I'd have done it.  If something went wrong with the splice, you've handcuffed yourself into doing something not-as-good for the fibers to resplice it.  You would loop it all the way around the tray back to the starting point, THEN do your fibers, so that you have that extra chance or two.  It does happen.  OR, and maybe we don't see this, you have an extra loop or two of cable for each side outside the tray, and so all this is moot.  There's slack, it's outside the tray.  Again, this also may be a case of he didn't have much of a choice and was lucky to get it this nice.  Been there, indeed.  And it really looks so satisfying, I'll grant. :)"

cableporn,2x3sng,ebauman,1 point,Wed Feb 25 15:34:25 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree with power! I forgot to mention that in my post earlier. I also track what is powered where. For switches/server/rackmount items, it's what circuit, and what plug number on that circuit (each rack has anywhere from 1 to 4 circuits each). For analog items that use wall or rack mount supplies (12vdc, 24vac, 48v/poe), I use the A-(B-)C-D method of other things, where:  A=Closet/location B (optional)=Rack number C=Circuit ID or Device number/name (the label on the device) D=Port/plug number  A rack device would be 2-1-UPS3.15-5 (Closet 2, rack 1, circuit UPS3.15, plug 5)  A wall mount device (power supply type) would be 4-5-11 (Closet 4, device/panel 5, port/plug 11)  I find that when I made the change and consistently applied this numbering/labeling scheme (also in my other post), my time spent tracing/locating things dropped to near zero. It also makes taking notes for the required information for each new device easy.  I'm totally open to any suggestions on how to improve this, as well."

Several columns, with things like end device name/IP, what switch and switch port it is in, what structured drop it is on, what data closet it passes through, etc etc.  I use a similar method for tracking ANALOG device information in my little slice of the tech world: end device, cable number, data closet it comes into, where on the block it terminates, what trunk run it cross connects to, and what physical port it lands in. Ex: device 141, lands at 2-1-5 (closet-110 row-110 number). Trunk 2-3-20 (closet-trunk 110 row-110 number). Finally data is what port it lands in the system.  Put those in sortable/searchable columns. Now if I have a device fail, and can trouble shoot in any direction quickly. Also easy to figure what is there if you have any of the middle point information.  I do something similar for IP devices, but I have a lot more analog than IP, by a couple orders of magnitude.  I'm sure others can home in with a lot more input."

cableporn,2wzq2w,Rah_BE,2,Tue Feb 24 22:59:03 2015 UTC,Every lightpack demo video I've seen doesn't do a good job of selling the product. The color grabbing from the display doesn't seem very effective.  I imagine the profile selection is no an automated process. So even time a different aspect ratio video plays you have manually change the profile?
cableporn,2wzq2w,Warlord_Shadow,2,Wed Feb 25 20:56:13 2015 UTC,"I kickstarted it so I've probably got some bias towards it. But as someone who needs to have ambient light while using a screen in a dark environment, it's great while adding another layer of depth.  Yes, setting each profile up initially is a manual process, but once you've done it the first time, you just need to click the tray icon to switch between each ratio (and it's not like many people chain videos with varying aspect ratios.)"
cableporn,2wzq2w,Hotcooler,4,Wed Feb 25 22:10:34 2015 UTC,"I use mine as an ambient light for the monitor (all leds set to a white-yellowish color), so there's much less strain on the eyes when it's dark.

This is a project that is a joint venture between universities called cloudlab (https://www.cloudlab.us/). Here is a description from that site of our platform:  The Clemson system, developed in close cooperation with Dell, will have three major components: bulk block storage, low density storage for MapReduce/Hadoop-like computing, and generic VM nodes used to provision virtual machines. All nodes have 16 cores per node (2 CPUs), one on-board 1 Gb Ethernet and a dual port 56/40/10 GBps card. Bulk storage nodes will provide block level services to all nodes over a dedicated 10 Gb/s Ethernet. Storage nodes will consist of 12x4 TB disk drives in each node, plus 8x1 TB disks in each node. The nodes are configured with 256 GB of memory. Hadoop nodes have 4x1 TB disk and 256 GB of memory. VM nodes have 256 GB memory each. The large memory configuration reflects the need for significant memory in VMs today and allows use to increase performance by reduced paging/swapping in the VMs.  The focus of this system will be to provision significantly sized environments that can be linked to national and international resources. It will also be able to directly connect to Clemson Condo HPC system with nearly 2000 nodes. The interactions between bare metal systems in the Condo cluster with VMs in the cloud system will allow prototyping of next generation HPC and CS environments in a SDN-enabled network."

cableporn,2wt7oe,Sniper98g,5,Mon Feb 23 00:16:31 2015 UTC,A place I used to work had a 50/50 spilt policy in place for cable management. I went up the chain to get a specific exemption made for 6500s and 4500s because of this.

cableporn,2wt7oe,JasonDJ,5,Mon Feb 23 00:33:35 2015 UTC,"No, left. You need a way to remove all of the cables running up the left side of the rack to access the fan tray -- that black handle on the left."
cableporn,2wt7oe,devtrue,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:54:14 2015 UTC,Gotcha. Let's hope we don't have to replace that fan often.
cableporn,2wt7oe,devtrue,6,Mon Feb 23 03:22:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know what your architecture is, but it's one of those things where if you have to replace it, you have to replace it because things are melting inside the chassis and you could fry eggs on the supervisors, which means it's going to be a mid day outage for half your network. Plan for it, in other words.   Since you apparently didn't read the deployment specifications on this chassis, let me call your attention to where it says that the sides of this chassis need to be clear for airflow. This means that you do need to monitor the interior temps, especially because you're running dense PoE gear. The cable you have running on the side of the chassis -- both sides, really -- is outside of specs and makes the fans run at a higher speed, makes each fan more likely to develop mechanical faults (and reduces the amount of time before you need to replace a tray), and makes replacement or protective shutdown during working hours (as opposed to a planned outage) more likely.   All of this goes in the ""ask me how I know"" file, by the way.   The way you have this cabled is pretty but really really needs to be rethought -- either that, or I hope you are a contractor and don't need to own this on an oncall/maintenance basis. The only way I have seen this large of a chassis cabled appropriately is with a full rack of patch panels on the right and open air on the left."

cableporn,2wt7oe,DrewR98,4,Mon Feb 23 03:43:22 2015 UTC,"Incidentally, I just spoke with one of our senior network guys and he says if that fan tray dies, the switch will power off anyway because it can't run for long without it. He said unless you have a spare fan tray sitting around, the switch will shutdown well before the SmartNet replacement comes in.  He also said that provided the room is clean, you should never have to replace it and there's no maintenance required on the fan tray so there's no need to remove it until it fails.   Since you apparently didn't read the deployment specifications on this chassis, let me call your attention to where it says that the sides of this chassis need to be clear for airflow.   This comment kind of irked me and I didn't know how to respond until just now.  Both intake/exhaust fans are unobstructed. We (the 2 less senior guys tasked with racking/cabling it) just didn't pay attention to the fan tray location as this was our first wiring of a 4500 chassis.  Turns out having it setup this way isn't really a problem at all. Just a tad messy if/when that fan tray fails."
cableporn,2wt7oe,privatefcjoker,2,Mon Feb 23 19:24:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I was typing that entire big thing on an iPad and I was probably terse. I meant that you hadn't known that was the fan tray and the deployment guide says not to cable over the left side, blocking it. So I had assumed you hadn't read the deployment guide, which includes those details.   In the chassis that I had a fan failure in (a much smaller chassis) there were multiple trays inside that cover and we could not swap them. It was a really old chassis though, so I have no idea if the monster you have has multiple fan trays where you can keep running while you swap them out."
cableporn,2wt7oe,privatefcjoker,3,Mon Feb 23 20:24:14 2015 UTC,I use these at work but i never understand how they work internally. Is each individual line card a switch and each line card(switch) is switched by the SUP?
cableporn,2wt7oe,IAmTheCreeper,3,Sun Feb 22 23:54:10 2015 UTC,"Sort of.  Each blade has its own software running on it that it downloads from the supervisor card when it boots. Each blade also can perform some local switching functions without involving the Sup.  Basically the sup makes all of the forwarding decisions, but once a forwarding action has been sent to the line card, it remembers the action and can forward subsequent frames without consulting the sup."
cableporn,2wt7oe,Kuonji,4,Mon Feb 23 15:15:55 2015 UTC,Yeap. Both SUP's in fact and they look like stacked switches from a console perspective.
cableporn,2wt7oe,matt10489,2,Mon Feb 23 00:02:42 2015 UTC,So the sups have both CPU's and ASIC's?
cableporn,2wt7oe,IAmTheCreeper,1 point,Mon Feb 23 12:54:25 2015 UTC,I'm not an expert on the 4500's (first one) but I believe the CPU's are the SUP's and ASICS are on the slots.
cableporn,2wt7oe,matt10489,2,Mon Feb 23 14:42:55 2015 UTC,"I knew the slots has asics, but if the sup switches the line cards then it would want a asic for that? I just never bothered to learn the physical rote the traffic takes when being switched vs routed."
cableporn,2wt7oe,linksus,2,Mon Feb 23 14:47:19 2015 UTC,Both SUP's talk to each other at 10G speeds. I imagine this is quick enough to share MAC tables and/or owners of slots for redundancy when a SUP dies. SUP's are hot swappable so I'm willing to bet they share their data in real-time.
cableporn,2wt7oe,matt10489,2,Mon Feb 23 15:06:36 2015 UTC,"Do a ""show red"" and make sure they are configured (and using) SSO - Stateful switchover.  If they are then yes, they are fully hot-swappable, though ideally you would manually failover the supervisors before removing the active one.  Also make sure that if you are terminating a connection into the interfaces on one sup, you are using a portchannel and the other port is on the opposite sup.  If you are using RPR, switchover will not be so rapid as the MAC address table and CEF adjacency table isn't tracked in realtime.  This is usually caused by running the two sup's running a different version of code."

cableporn,2wfoer,smd75jr,8,Thu Feb 19 16:56:14 2015 UTC,Probably a router. A switcher will typically have a more uneven distribution of BNC connectors as different groups serve different purposes. With a router it's much more regular as it's just input/output (and a timing reference input or two)

cableporn,2wfoer,roy20050,6,Thu Feb 19 19:32:28 2015 UTC,SDI video is a fairly standard way of routing video in the broadcast world. This is most likely a router/matrix. It is a box that can switch and distribute any input to any output(s).
cableporn,2wfoer,savyur,2,Thu Feb 19 20:31:56 2015 UTC,tl;dr: the broadcast video equivalent of a network switch
cableporn,2wfoer,smd75jr,6,Thu Feb 19 22:43:52 2015 UTC,They do very different things; a packet switch will inspect individual packets and address them to the appropriate output. A video router simply connects output X to input Y.
cableporn,2wfoer,toresbe,-1,Thu Feb 19 22:57:46 2015 UTC,3 sentences suggest a tl;dr... f¥€k I am getting old...
cableporn,2wfoer,savyur,4,Fri Feb 20 02:20:45 2015 UTC,"Probably a router. Though typically yellow is used for composite video (analog, not digital.) But it would be pretty unusual to have so much analog equipment nowadays."
cableporn,2wfoer,SuperGeometric,6,Fri Feb 20 00:24:12 2015 UTC,I'm guessing router. Could easily be a switcher though.
cableporn,2wfoer,soundman1024,4,Thu Feb 19 16:59:10 2015 UTC,I'm with you. Think it's a router. Can't tell the model from this pic though.
cableporn,2wfoer,wjc06,3,Thu Feb 19 17:15:14 2015 UTC,Looks like a 16RU Evertz EQX.  They have a number of different options so I can't really round it down beyond that.
cableporn,2wfoer,FreedomOps,6,Thu Feb 19 23:36:15 2015 UTC,Wow - is Thin Net still a thing?
cableporn,2wfoer,avatar307,4,Thu Feb 19 16:45:41 2015 UTC,That's an SDI video router.
cableporn,2wfoer,FreedomOps,6,Thu Feb 19 19:14:24 2015 UTC,"This is a 32x32 Evertz switcher... nicely cabled, but I should get a photo of the 576x576 one at my last job.  Edit: brainfart, sorry, sorry. I went by the description in the post this was a repost of. The standard notation for a switcher is the number of inputs by the number of outputs - a 32x32 switch would thus be 64 connectors. There are obviously more than 64 connectors here. I should've seen that. I think this is a switch with 32*32=1024 connectors, thus likely a 512-by-512 switch."

cableporn,2wcb3b,jesusmcpenis,2,Thu Feb 19 05:27:05 2015 UTC,"Actually, something I've wanted to ask for a while: in a lot of these data centre installs, often I've seen cables bundled and managed rediculously tight, so there is no chance of movement. Of a server. That's on rails.  So there's no way to slide the server out without unplugging everything. Is there any reason for this?"
cableporn,2wcb3b,coredestruction,3,Thu Feb 19 10:26:43 2015 UTC,"Well, with these servers, if the server needs to come out, unplugging three cables isn't a big deal. The rails we use are really simple so there's no cable management and the server isn't on a drawer system, so when the server is pulled from the rack, it it pulled all the way out onto the floor or a desk. But usually maintenance tickets are for hard drive replacements, which are all externally accessible anyway, so it's not much of a problem anyway.  There are other types (Like some Dell gear I cabled to) that are on drawer slides and have cable management 'arms' so you can pull the server out without removing it from the rack or unplugging anything."

cableporn,2wdk98,Visaly,7,Thu Feb 19 08:56:06 2015 UTC,"Two things:   You're in education, and you can't get an HP rep to get you a rate on a server that is less than two maxed out Mac Minis and a custom rail system? You may need to shop around for another rep. Or, buy used even! You are not using server grade equipment (or even the operating system the equipment comes with!), which will inherently add up your time in the long run. You've now spending twice as much time configuring two servers than one, even more time custom mounting them, and you stand a good chance of spending a whole lot more time troubleshooting when desktop hardware fails after being run as a server.   I've seen people rack Mac Mini's, and most of them tell you they do it because they have to. They run video/photo editing backend software that has to be run on a Mac, and Apple quit making servers. And they don't let you install the OS (legally) on anything else.  If you're not using the OS, and you don't want to pay HP, why didn't you make a custom box!?! Once again, you could have beaten this performance."
cableporn,2wdk98,bfbehrenshausen,5,Thu Feb 19 19:45:45 2015 UTC,I side by you in this entire diatribe... but you know the real answer as to why they have to use Macs.
cableporn,2wdk98,cyberjacob,2,Fri Feb 20 10:36:10 2015 UTC,"Density wise yea, figure 4 mini's with i7's 16GB ram, and maybe a 1TB ssd for storage, or less if storage is somewhere else. That can pack a punch. Wouldnt Mac Pro's (desktops) with higher end GPU's be better for render nodes or was space/cost an issue? (just curious idk alot about Macs being used for rendering and such)"

cableporn,2w8kmi,capptainclutch,19,Wed Feb 18 00:08:58 2015 UTC,"No! no no no.   Quite the opposite. The vast majority of Servers (including the Dells shown here) are ventilated front to back, they are designed to draw 100% of the the air through the front. When you space servers without using blanking panels you lose hot aisle/cold aisle separation. You now risk cycling the exhaust air through the intake."
cableporn,2w8kmi,My_usrname_of_choice,-9,Wed Feb 18 00:20:22 2015 UTC,"Depends how you're cooling them, doesn't it now?   Also if you're using different vendors, there's no guarantee this is the case. (router and switch at the top)"
cableporn,2w8kmi,capptainclutch,1 point,Wed Feb 18 00:33:09 2015 UTC,"You cool them with cold air..... I highly doubt this is using a water cooled system.  And like I said, virtually all servers are cooled front to back. Also, most modern rack mount switches are designed to have rear facing ports, so the side you see is still the exhaust.   I have come across fortinet and older cisco devices that are cooled side to side, they are stupid and defy industry standard. This is maybe 1% of a modern data center though"

cableporn,2w8kmi,consigntooblivion,5,Wed Feb 18 02:04:00 2015 UTC,IEC C13/C14 is much better to work with IMO. Rack power distribution with a row of IEC sockets.
cableporn,2w8kmi,anothergaijin,2,Wed Feb 18 02:24:32 2015 UTC,"That's nice and all, but in Japan getting 100V C13/14 isn't always possible, and domestic equipment will often come with nothing but NEMA 5-15P and only support 100V.

cableporn,2wbnnj,Bram9107,3,Wed Feb 18 16:20:53 2015 UTC,"In commercial electrical work, we hammer drill with a very carefully selected bit-size, and then insert anchors, followed by the correct size of round-head #2 square screws holding whatever zip ties, or 1 or 2-hole straps.

cableporn,2wbnnj,MinimusNadir,3,Wed Feb 18 17:31:39 2015 UTC,"Generally, the fastener will cover up the rough edge around the hole.  A good drill bit helps a ton, you can get carbide-tipped hammer drill bits, and they'll go pretty fast.  If you just don't want to drill, you can always use a powder-actuated nailgun to speed things up, but I think that drilling would be a better route.  Instead of drilling for each cable clip, you could do something like run a cable channel, which would only need to be supported at each end - less drilling, fewer holes."

cableporn,2wbnnj,da_kink,1 point,Wed Feb 18 19:29:54 2015 UTC,The only other options would be superglue or some kind of adhesive. Which would ruin your wallpaper.   Or dangle them from the ceiling ;)

cableporn,2wbnnj,Arch27,1 point,Wed Feb 18 18:08:35 2015 UTC,"well, you could glue on the fasteners, but depending on the kind of fastener, it would probably rip off the paper.  And I know that cable runs with adhesive on the back exist, but those usually fall off within a week."

cableporn,2w4q3t,cravines,6,Mon Feb 16 23:23:13 2015 UTC,good quality stickybacks like panduit brand will actually break the plastic before the adhesive lets go. but not many contractors want to pay $1/per.

cableporn,2w4q3t,imnotmarvin,4,Tue Feb 17 02:49:00 2015 UTC,"Looks nice.  In regards to your sticky backs, how do you prep for them?  I either find myself wiping the surface down with alcohol or sometimes resorting to hot glue to get them to stick.  I only ask because when I do something like this and come back to it in a year they have all failed and the bundles are floating.  Sometimes I turn my back any they have come unstuck.  I sometimes screw them down but not in the door of course ;)"

cableporn,2w4q3t,mx831,2,Tue Feb 17 00:26:18 2015 UTC,I put a few dabs of super glue on the adhesive backing. I've went back to panels that I built years later and it has held up.

cableporn,2vrveu,Armestam,6,Fri Feb 13 19:57:31 2015 UTC,The fixtures would be about 2000. The engine to power them all would be 2.5 times that. That's always the tricky part.  Each engine can power up 48 lights so the more you have the less cost per unit it works out at.
cableporn,2vrveu,DaveIsLame2,3,Fri Feb 13 20:44:51 2015 UTC,Whoa.  I could install twice the number of fixture in our building for the cost of one.  So the ROI on these things is pretty much nonexistent at this point (at least for small buildings).
cableporn,2vrveu,punch____,6,Fri Feb 13 20:56:08 2015 UTC,Yes and no. Brand new install where you are having to install electrical cables and all other light related equipment plus controls and sensors and the cost is more comparable.

cableporn,2vrveu,beautify,2,Fri Feb 13 16:06:36 2015 UTC,It's powered over Ethernet cabling but not PoE in the sense we all know it. The engines you can see there just push DC power and collect sensor stats via that cabling.

cableporn,2vrveu,mailerdeemon,2,Sat Feb 14 11:17:53 2015 UTC,That's awesome.  So the actual power is sent through the cable too or is that just for control?    Did not figure ethernet could handle more than a couple 100ma since it's just 24 gauge.
cableporn,2vrveu,mailerdeemon,4,Fri Feb 13 17:03:53 2015 UTC,Off the top of my head it's about 30W per cable.  It's relatively low current (300mA or so) but at 48V.
cableporn,2vrveu,Wetmelon,2,Fri Feb 13 17:53:39 2015 UTC,30W is more than enough to light a whole room.
cableporn,2vrveu,Wetmelon,2,Fri Feb 13 18:39:29 2015 UTC,It is with LEDs.  I suspect 5W across a 750x750 panel would go a long way.
cableporn,2vrveu,whatwereyouthinking,2,Fri Feb 13 19:14:47 2015 UTC,Yeah it's roughly 15W  for normal PoE or 30W for PoE+

Was once doing a remodel for a Johnson & Wales University and we were looking for a particular junction box above the ceiling tiles. We found it and immediately noticed that the cover plate was protruding a bit, and someone had taken the time to sharpie a skull-and-cross-bones onto the face.

Wtf.  I was helping at a cousins house that they just bought, entire residence done with bx, some of the shittiest work I've seen in my life. Only need two wires? run a 3 wire and just cut off the extra wire at the edge of the box. Random junction boxes in the wall, or wires in the wall just wrapped up in tape. Or outlets that aren't even connected. The entire thing was a total cluster fuck."
cableporn,2vo9wi,naturalorange,2,Fri Feb 13 01:14:27 2015 UTC,"What did you end up finding on the switch at your uncle's?  I had a damn line reading 24 volts when it should have been dead.  After jacking around with it for about 45 minutes tracing it through the house, I determined it was just induction from wiring somewhere along the way.    And your cousin's house sounds like quite a few I've seen that have had a few generations of ""handymen"" living in them.  One time there was an older man that couldn't get up into the attic anymore, so all the electrical he did was outside the wall/ceiling and covered with cord cover."

cableporn,2v9uqv,Accujack,3,Mon Feb 9 06:25:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  My mentor, and other people on my team suggested not using a metal backboard; reason being that if a loose, bare wire hits it, it will short out.

cableporn,2v9uqv,bloons3,3,Mon Feb 9 06:32:17 2015 UTC,I think that for FRC you are not allowed to use chassis as a ground.

The ROBOT frame must not be used to carry electrical current.  R27 is checked by observing a >10kΩ resistance between either the (+) or (-) post within the APP connector that is attached to the PDP and any point on the ROBOT."

cableporn,2v9uqv,Accujack,2,Mon Feb 9 07:28:56 2015 UTC,"I see that your project specifies that you not use the chassis as ground, BUT to answer your question:  If everything on the board is DC (or even if it's AC) you can use the chassis as the common ground. Yes, you basically hook everything that would eventually connect up to the battery negative (including the battery negative) to the chassis; you're just using it as a very big, fat, chassis-shaped wire.   The thing you have to be cautious of is if you're using multiple voltages that they actually do share a common ground, and don't have their own separate floating ground reference. Luckily, this sort of thing is generally uncommon, because of how convenient it is to have a shared common ground across different electrical circuits."

cableporn,2v9uqv,RogueLeader096,2,Mon Feb 9 22:11:19 2015 UTC,"I'd ground it to the negative terminal.  You're right that a bare wire hitting it will short out.  However, that's preferable to a bare wire waving around until it shocks someone.  The purpose of the metal backboard is to provide a place for the electricity to go other than into someone or (less bad) into another component that will blow up.  Put another way:  The danger of a short to the backboard is that something may not work.  The danger of not having a metal backboard that's grounded is that someone may be hurt."

cableporn,2uhkr5,Mythril_Zombie,26,Mon Feb 2 10:46:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I've brought this up a couple times in the past and others have agreed as well. However still, when pc cases and shit like that get posted, they still get 500 upvotes. The tipping point in this sub for me, I think, was when someone posted a picture of a little wifi router at home and it got 400 upvotes. I think the issue is the sub got quite popular recently, and a lot of newcomers don't know/understand that the sub is intended for large datacenter installations and things of that scale, so when they see anything involving cabling of any sort they upvote it. This is why all the shit content that used to float to the bottom now ends up +800"
cableporn,2uhkr5,Fohdeesha,7,Mon Feb 2 06:10:31 2015 UTC,Agreed. Cable management is not inherently porn. There is a sub for specifically computer case enthusiasts to faff about.

cableporn,2uhkr5,JEThree,8,Mon Feb 2 19:46:16 2015 UTC,While I agree average submission quality has gone down I do not think we should discriminate against non-datacenter scale projects.  I have seen worthy posts from all different types of installations and just because you are partial to datacenters doesn't mean we all are. I think we can all learn something from the many amazing wire managing artists among us and the place that we apply our work should not put anyone above another.  Good work speaks for itself.

But as proud as I am of my home server rack cabling, I don't think it's cable porny enough to actually post it here. I mean, it's good. But...it's not Jenna Jameson good.  Maybe we need a /r/cablesgonemild sub for people to post in...  And that's not to shit on anyone's parade. I realize a lot of the people posting are posting work they're proud of. But just because I'm proud of it doesn't mean it's actually pornographic.  One of my big peeves lately is dataracks with all the cables hidden behind panels. That's is not cable porn. That's the same thing as the fat chicks not posting more than their face on OKCupid.  ETA: and truth be told, when someone posts something that's nearly there. Maybe just a little off, I appreciate when the discussion floats toward the professional side of codes and best practices. The problem is that there's a slippery slope there. How porny is porny enough to allow those mistakes to slide? I usually don't upvote or downvote them, while I will critique. Maybe that's the solution?"

Wrangling wires inside a PC is not cableporn. PEX tubing (can't believe I have to say this) is NOT cableporn.

If you don't understand why something is ""messy"" in some way, question it so that it can be explained.

The very last PC-60 sold new in Sweden, pretty cool I think!  All the intake fans have dust filters, and every fan is mounted using some type of anti-vibration method. All the HDDs except for my Barracuda have rubber grommets. The sides and top have sheets of adhesive anti-vibration material on them, and for having so many moving parts it's surprisingly quiet. It blends into the background only three feet away. Being that it's situated about four feet away from my bed, silence is key.  Inside we find a 1.8ghz C2D, 2GB ram, and an assortment of fans and drives. The HDD rack is from a Fractal Design Define R4 case. The computer is used as a NAS, runs Windows for convenience, and it's mostly sitting idle when it isn't downloading torrents or streaming video files to my HTPC."

cableporn,2ug8hx,DonCasper,2,Mon Feb 2 21:13:57 2015 UTC,"Similarly it's kind of lame when an artist says they did something because it would look pretty. The following thought is unavoidably pretentious, but if you just made ""art"" because you wanted something pretty to look at you are no more of an artist than an engineer.   This watch is definitely art, but I think the artist could have made a better case as to why. Having spent most of my adult life around scientists and engineers, I get the feeling that a lot of the skepticism from STEM types regarding the value of art is because many artists are really crappy at explaining their art.  STEM types are naturally very skeptical, and these overblown explanations of art just sets of a bullshit meter.  I definitely have my friends who are probably close to incapable of understanding art, but I think the rest would definitely appreciate this as art if it was explained as being borne out of a desire to reevaluate our interactions with the digital watch.  The idea I'm describing of course is deconstruction, but the problem with using that word is that most people don't understand it intuitively.  In the sciences there is a movement that is anti-jargon, and it's gaining steam.  The idea is that a lot of people don't trust science because the results are inaccessible to them, and by using jargon we are barring average people from the discussion.  The proponents of this idea don't think all jargon should be eliminated, but rather use of jargon should be done very sparingly and only when necessary.  I've brought up this idea in my friend groups who are concerned with artsy fartsy stuff and social justice and it is actually a much more difficult sell.  This has always struck me as strange because social justice movements would definitely benefit from greater public understanding, though I am not really surprised that the art world would be intentionally exclusionary.  Regardless, the use of argot has always struck me as masturbatory; it seems to be used out of a desire to sound intelligent rather than a desire to communicate.  That being said, there are plenty of times when not using jargon makes conversation needlessly difficult."

Developed in 1933, The Hammond Organ uses a synchronous AC clock motor to maintain perfect pitch, based on power-line frequency stability.

There are special tools called flush cutters that perform this task.  Amazon link.  Regular side cutters are not good enough as they have a diamond style bevel on the blades.

And it'll start on the low-voltage side of the device, which is just awesome in so many obvious ways.  (NEC recommends against a second ground, but it is technically allowed.  A dedicated communications ground on a residential building needs tied to the main ground rod by direct run of #6 copper wire....which is always expensive, and why it's always a dumb idea:  It takes a lot of extra work to accomplish negative benefit.)"

I've worked on systems with Wilson Alexandria's that cost $120K , Esoteric CD player and external clock worth somewhere around $50k and then the amps of course are worth $70k and then all the cables...dedicated two channels system and with his turntable worth about $420,000 CAD  You're right some people just wanna spend the money, I was once the customer and wasted ridiculous amounts of money and considered myself a audiophile but eventually I got working with home automation and realized what I really liked was the flexibility of listening to good sounding audio in all rooms with B&W ceiling speakers.  I'm sick of sitting in a dedicated listening room to listen to my music, these days I have a Wilson speaker system with Krell amps for all 7 channels and I would rather watch movies than sit and critique a fricken album...I'm getting older and don't have time to waste worrying about the technicalities of sound.   I also have a background in recording engineering and was trained before digital and most people know that in a REAL studio you're not using overpriced esoteric cabling that costs $10,000 for a 6 foot run...instead your using plain old fuckin Beldin cable, and thats a fact!"

For 99% of setups, that will never be an issue. And, in the rare case that it does happen, it's fairly obvious and you can switch to a better cable. You don't buy a ridiculously expensive cable ""just in case"".  If the cheaper cable works, there is no reason to use the more expensive one, aside maybe from concerns about longevity. And if you do need to run cables that long, you're usually better off using baluns, as one of the responders in the thread you linked points out.  More to the point, the comment I was responding to said ""sometimes expensive cables work when cheap cables don't"" as a way of explaining the earlier statement that he'd had cheap cables outperform expensive cables and vice versa, implying that sometimes cheap cables work when expensive cables don't too. In other words: sometimes you get cables that don't work. It's not a very good argument in favor of buying overpriced HDMI cabling."
cableporn,2ua1ra,wanderingbilby,1 point,Sat Jan 31 16:40:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly, its data, 1s and 0s. Either they all go through, or none do. So any HDMI cable will work if made correctly by the manufacturer. For how long and under what stress with they last? Time will tell."

It's just wrong unless you start putting some qualifiers on it. In the lengths most people use (<10ft) you're more or less right. The only thing cheap cable gets you is cheap construction, meaning it's more likely to be DOA or break from being handled.  However, over long distance runs (large home theater maybe?), proximity to power or fluorescent lights, and other problem inducing situations, paying for higher quality cable can have tangible benefits (shielding, better adherence to standards, more rigorous QA, higher quality materials, etc). You get a product that will ""go farther"", hold up better, and suffer interference.  I do comm work for a company whose approach to everything is lowest bidder, and that combined with this mentality with copper ("" If it touches it talks"") has led to some really poor purchases in spite of my pleas."

On the ends of the baluns you have a short cable and it can be cheap one as long as the cable is built well it will perform the same as cables costing hundreds, I know because I installed for a high end vanity dealer and would test overpriced systems daily with cheap and expensive cables.  So if a guy needs a high end cable for 35 feet and somebody says ""We have a active cable for $800"" I would suggest they just buy HDbaseT baluns instead for less than $200 and the quality will easily be the same.  I run HDbaseT video with Crestron systems, Crestron calls it Crestron DM but in reality its just HDbaseT and running 100-300 foot drops is common and the video works perfect, no magical  overpriced cables and just using CAT6.  **Note I also own very high end NBS cables that are seriously overpriced that I got at a great price due to working for a high end vanity shop, my personal opinion will always be they are nothing more than the ego and cables costing thousands less sound the same to my 40+ ears that the audiologist says are perfect."

Same problem from the other direction.  I've used these 25ft monoprice cables which are less than a dollar a foot, and they worked pretty well - but I wouldn't want to use them for any application where they had to be unplugged much, because the cables are thick and stiff and the ends would obviously fail quickly.  For any run in the 25 - 35ft range though they work well."

I believe at that time we were also at HDMI 1.1 or 1.2 and now we are at 1.4 so anybody with these cables in wall from that time(like me) would have problems if they didn't run extra CAT5 at the the time, I ran plenty and for the rooms I need video to and I've already pulled new CAT6 just in case and use it with HDBaseT baluns"
cableporn,2ua1ra,custardnom,6,Sat Jan 31 14:53:16 2015 UTC,"Things like HDMI and USB have standards that need to be met, and these take into account that cables should work under every reasonable circumstance. That means fluorescent lights shouldn't be able to interfere. You're not supposed to run low voltage data cabling next to AC power cabling anyway, so that shouldn't matter. The only thing that matters is length, and considering these cables are (almost always) sold pre-fabricated at some specific length, then the right measures against degradation over length should have been taken in the design.  It's not even as complicated as it sounds to make a cable that meets these standards so only the cheapest of the cheap manufacturers will mess it up so bad that the cable might not work under reasonable use. The only other factor is QA and materials, but only in such a way that they contribute to the build quality, i.e., will the cable fall apart or is the cable more usable (bends better, for instance, or doesn't tangle as much). Most 'expensive' manufacturers of consumer cables like to gold-plate everything and it doesn't contribute to anything. And for every $0.10 of gold they put into the cable you end up paying $10 extra.  In digital cables, not 'either all the bits go through or none of them', but 'either the signal goes through 100% or the cable is bad', that is, as long is the cable is good enough (the signal goes through 100%), there's no point in making it better. If you want to connect your STB to your TV over 60cm distance then a $10 cable with a decent build quality will be just as good a buy as a $250 gold one with all sorts of made up analog-tier 'enhancements' given that if it doesn't work you can return it to the store. In fact, buy 2, so that you spent $20 and if either one is DOA or breaks because you keep re-plugging it for some stupid reason then you have a spare, and you still spent 92% less than if you had gotten the overpriced one."

That means fluorescent lights shouldn't be able to interfere   Shouldn't, but often do. This is why we buy shielded cable.   You're not supposed to run low voltage data cabling next to AC power cabling anyway   In a perfect world of course there are no problems or situations that you can avoid. However, I don't know anyone who lives in one. Maybe you do?   but 'either the signal goes through 100% or the cable is bad'   Certain systems only have so much tolerance for dB loss. There's a reason I can hook up a generic 48 port Cisco switch on a system with 10bB loss on 2 strands of fiber, but specialized equipment may only tolerate 5dB. Point being, it's not that black and white. Sorry."

cableporn,2u3s8d,WillsMyth,4,Fri Jan 30 01:29:34 2015 UTC,"Patch panels are a pretty basic concept. Rather than running your cables from the port on the actual device you use a patch panel to run custom lengths of ethernet (cat5, 5e, 6) to ports around an office/home then into the patch panel. Then you connect short patch cables from the patch panel to the interconnect device. This has loads of benefits, you can label patch panels so that you can easily trace ports plus other stuff. If you wish to distribute any type of cable around your building effeciently you would use a patch panel. They just make wiring much easier and better in general."

cableporn,2u3s8d,sobusyimbored,1 point,Fri Jan 30 02:08:54 2015 UTC,"Permanent cables installed in walls from one room to another that do not move are installed using solid core cables. They have better electrical properties for long distance cabling, but are inflexible and break easily.  Patch cables that go from the wall to a device are replaced frequently, but are rarely installed through walls because of the cost and expense of replacing cables pulled through buildings.  Patch Panels are the place where Patch cables are connected to permanent cables. The result is that you get a flexible, easily replaceable cable at the ends where the devices are that will be moved and changed, and better, solid core cables for the majority of the cable run distance for better quality data connections."

We have this cable ladder with about 20 thick gauge (000 if I had to guess) cable for the DMS and they all use lacing to tie them to the ladder and the way they turn around is just pure porn. I think of this subreddit when I pass by it. :P  I'd have to ask if it's ok to take a pic one day...  I attempted to do my own battery plant wiring with Telcoflex wire at home for my server stuff and it was #2 and it looks pretty bad, it's harder than it looks to make that stuff look good as it's so stiff to work with.   The 000 stuff and bigger must be quite something to work with.   For those curious the reason telco's use DC is because there is a battery bank tied in for power backup. The actual voltage is 54 volts which is the float voltage to keep the batteries charged.  Divide that by 4 and it's 13.5, which is what your car's alternator should run at to keep a 12v battery topped up.    You can think of it as a big online UPS (no switch over time).  The equipment runs on DC since that way you don't need to use inverters everywhere.  Your phone line is also running on 48vdc and when it rings it's about 170v AC.  There is a device called a ring generator that sends this pulse down the line.  You'll get a nice jolt if you're touching the terminals of a phone line that someone is calling. Been there done that...   There's a reason all ladders in COs are made of wood."

cableporn,2tt8hl,omg_nyc_really,4,Tue Jan 27 13:22:51 2015 UTC,Typically if you have a long run of -48v DC(it is actually around -52v--54v) power you will run a rather large cable and at the ends you will c-tap on a smaller cable to plug in to the equipment. What size of cable depends on how long the run is and how big of a load will be on that circuit.

They're much cheaper to buy (at least in the short run), and unless you are living somewhere where your tank water heater vastly exceeds your needs, you wouldn't save money from an electric tankless water heater.  If you live somewhere with natural gas, however, tankless will save you money, typically (there are always exceptions where electricity is still cheaper than natural gas, but that's pretty infrequent as it pertains to tankless water heaters). In any case, don't feel in the dark, they're not quite common knowledge over here, but 95% of people (maybe more?) have tank water heaters still and don't intend on changing."

In a brand new building you can do this, but when doing Reno, adding drops, moving drops, they get mixed in. You just don't have the time to rip everyone out and punch back down in logical order. Having the drops labeled at the keystone is what usually ends up happening.   I'm moving about 80 cat6 drops right now, we took over a building that used to be a bank, and now its gutted and we are putting in a totally new floor plan.

Depending on the office setup (if it's an open concept floor) Consolidation Points and MUTOAs are great for running more than enough drops than will be needed for day 1 operations.   Again, renovation work and people will most likely mess up the installation further down the line which will let you see all kinds of random shit like extra panels mounted randomly somehwere in a room with poor documentation because it was a ""get this shit done"" kinda day.

I've tried them and it's not worth the trouble imo, there will always be someone that doesn't give a fuck to use a blue cable where they should have used a yellow one.

Over time I have developed my own color scheme and stick to that for all my jobs and that's what I believe is the most important part. My color code is blue for access data, white for analog voice, grey for serial data, green for VoIP voice, yellow for uplinks, red for crossover uplinks and pink for servers. Cables are labeled on each side with matching color wrap around labels and for etherchannels and cable trunks I usually use same color braided sleeving and tie-wraps."

Im not dumb I can Google like anyone else, I wanted a more in depth answer by someone familiar with the history behind the term, not simply because it's from Kansas City. For instance perhaps it was code to lace like that in kc and at some point and along the road it became a standard nationally.   In the case of ""New York style cheesecake"" it came from plain slightly denser cheesecake becoming extremely popular in New York in the 1900's."

The first layer is always a Kansas City, with the running end of the the last half hitch going all the way around and sucking the bundle together. They layers above are Power Stiches where the running end is brought back across the top and tied to one of the stitches.  Very nice OP. That THHN stranded cable is a bitch to work.

cableporn,2t4f6g,codedit,13,Wed Jan 21 03:16:49 2015 UTC,"Not to be rude but this subreddit is about the dressing of cable, not the applications of. The cables installed are determined by the architect and RCDD assigned to the project, not me or the company I work for. The cat3 is for backbone ""pots"" lines. I.E. fax, and voice lines for elevators and fire alarm. Installing cat6A ensures they are ready for future technology, it is actually becoming quite common in commercial buildings to use it. Installing fiber to every room in a building is very costly, and computers, phones, and telemetry systems that these cables are for, do not connect using fiber."

cableporn,2t4f6g,douchecanoo,5,Wed Jan 21 04:25:54 2015 UTC,I must agree with OP on this one. There are many systems which you can't just transition to VOIP and fiber. You'd need to replace allot of hardware which would be an expensive opperation.
cableporn,2t4f6g,Diablo-D3,1 point,Wed Jan 21 11:19:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The cost of replacing all the hardware is probably a lot, lot, higher than running all this wiring.  As they do upgrade slowly, they have plenty of Cat6 to connect it to at that stage. I'm assuming, and correct me if I'm wrong OP, but each RJ45 outlet that these connect to are a double interface? Which allows for a computer, and later in the life of the hospital, a VoIP phone?"

I can see a 10 gigabit line being ran to just the workstation of the guy that reads those, if the hospital has one.  Everyone else in the building? The only reason to wire for gigabit is because thats what all computers come with now, and Cat6 is the cheapest thing per foot currently."

The building was being turned into a different type of office that didn't need the cables anymore.  It took 4 weeks to demo and probably had to pull 40 kilometers of data wire out of pipes. We had huge piles of scrap wire that you could lay on and sleep on if you wanted too.  That place was a nightmare.

I think some other friends took picture of me lying on it for reference.  Also,  my Samsung S4 can't take pictures worth shit unless it's in direct sunlight. Anyone else have this deal with their S4? I'd take more pictures if the camera was decent.   The building was 100 years old,  remodeled a dozen times,  had tons of abandoned pipes,  and had pipes running through the building that went to offices upstairs that we couldn't disrupt so we had to trace every single wire before we tore it down. Apologize for the bad photo,  the lighting conditions aren't ideal.   Small ball of R90 (Not Data). Imagine about 50-100 more of these and you'd have the scrap #12 wire. There was way more Data wire, but I have no pictures. Probably about 50-100 bathtubs full of data was pulled out and scrapped.

cableporn,2t2crk,rlaxton,3,Tue Jan 20 19:06:59 2015 UTC,Central Office. It's telco (telephone company) speak for the place where your individual telephone wire ends up and gets connected to the broader telephone network.
cableporn,2t2crk,Fascinating_Frog,9,Wed Jan 21 05:56:13 2015 UTC,Flexibility perhaps? 200 pair cat 3 cables are very stiff indeed. Possibly the minimum practical bend is more than the bend we see in the image.
cableporn,2t2crk,Coolbreezecurl,2,Wed Jan 21 06:16:47 2015 UTC,As a CO guy I would think flexibility is a big concern.

cableporn,2szg8q,Kraqoth,7,Tue Jan 20 02:49:48 2015 UTC,"Each pair has a heat shrink label that appears to indicate the location of both ends, troubleshooting this would be a dream.  Cables rarely go bad, the problem is almost always with the termination. That's where this installation falls short unfortunately, the pairs branch off the bundle at a right angle and go directly to the terminals, making them too short to be reterminated if necessary. The standard I go by is that without cutting any zip ties each wire should have enough slack at the point of termination to be able to be reterminated 3 times. It's easy to neatly add a short service loop to everything once you get the hang of it.  Spares have been provided in the unlikely event that a cable does fail, the bad one should simply be abandoned (properly capped and labeled of course), there's no need to remove it. Should you run out of spares just add the new ones on top of the existing bundle.

When I was in the field I weighed ~130 (I'm a skinny bastard) and bending pipe was the fucking worst for me since I didn't weigh enough even with leverage to bend a lot of commercial pipe. So I always love seeing clean pipe work since I could never do it
cableporn,2sukfz,nekoningen,5,Sun Jan 18 20:47:41 2015 UTC,"This is beautiful as hell. And so skillful. My 1st job as a sparky I put on 10lbs of muscle just bending pipe. Most of it was because for every 1 stick of pipe that would go up, there was 5 or 6 lying on the ground that I fucked up."
cableporn,2sukfz,anon12345,5,Sun Jan 18 21:33:19 2015 UTC,Haha I know that feeling. It really is an art to bend pipe by hand like that. The other journeymen I worked with always made me try and bend pipes that I had no hope of bending at all. Like full on standing on it with my full weight and not so much as a few degree bend. It's not easy for skinny dudes! Are you still in the field?

The inner 90 indeed is the middle pipe, and not the upper pipe.  I call bullshit on the rolled saddle, though, but it looks like they were avoiding the only preexisting receptacle on the wall there.  Tough call, not sure what I would do there."
cableporn,2sukfz,nekoningen,1 point,Mon Jan 19 01:09:01 2015 UTC,I don't think I can agree. See the way it dips down below the mortar line and then comes back up? That wouldn't happen with a rolled saddle. Perspective would make it appear in-line with the pipe heading to the left.

There was a period of a few years where it was permitted to use Zip ties for securing cables. Naturally, after a while, it was decided that we should never do that again!! Here's another shot on the same rack where you can see the cable runs side by side.  I think that cable lacing is definitely more work and more time consuming. But it does force you to do clean, elegant work that will last for decades."
cableporn,2swtbk,mus1Kk,5,Mon Jan 19 06:27:01 2015 UTC,"Could you explain why ""naturally"" you shouldn't use zip ties? I'm not much of a cable guy but I see them all the time so I'd like to see your take on that."
cableporn,2swtbk,bazrkr,1 point,Mon Jan 19 09:15:17 2015 UTC,"Main reason is best practice, you want to minimize any stress on the copper pairs to keep their transmission performance. Zip ties can easily be over tightened and kink a pair or two in a multi-pair and 4-pair cable, which can even fail a cable test if the run is long enough.   This form of cable lacing is almost never seen outside of a CO, and even then most should be using velcro straps as they are easier to replace and repair if needed.   The other form of cable lacing is seen commonly in aerospace where the lacing is one unbroken string along the cable to provide extra strength to keep things in place. I also use it myself for AV cable bundles as I can lace 3-4 connector cables together on the cheap without adding bulk with velcro ties (or worrying about the velcro snagging on anything in a bag)."

cableporn,2swtbk,LeisaHuston,0,Mon Jan 19 13:52:04 2015 UTC,One reason behind it is safety. You're not raking the back of your  hand  on a cut zip tie. That's what an AT&T  tech told me
cableporn,2swtbk,TheMagnificentChrome,1 point,Mon Jan 19 12:38:36 2015 UTC,"then use a zip tie cutter obviously, leaves a clean cut and you can set the tension so it's always the same tension.  http://www.3starinc.com/images/big/5048_140x140.gif"
cableporn,2swtbk,TheJizzle,1 point,Mon Jan 19 17:34:44 2015 UTC,"Okay, first of all, I agree that lacing looks better and it's technically better for the sake of the cables because it doesn't pinch as much. However, in these two shots, the main difference is that the lacing shot anchors the cables to the guide rings. The zip tie shot does not. If you had anchored the lines to the guides with the zip ties, the two pictures would be a lot more similar in appearance."

cableporn,2supb1,SikGT,2,Sun Jan 18 19:03:33 2015 UTC,"We used tuggers and one of those greenlee wire feeders. Kept tension very even but fairly loose so the pull went smoothly, and then let the tugger pull everything taut for a second.  Worked from the top of the can down, pipe by pipe, being super meticulous.  Everything on this job has been incredibly neat because the client wanted an industrial look so the vast majority of our pipe work and low voltage is visible.  edit to clarify, most of the circuits just pulled through this can. A few pipes went to the roof so we had to use it more like a giant conduilet or pull can, then fed back out the other way. That was a pain to say the least."

cableporn,2su5zd,Coshi,12,Sun Jan 18 19:20:49 2015 UTC,"Telephone system tech checking in.   Although it looks nice as is, I would be leaving 1-2cm more slack on the phone wires. It's a pain in the butt to try and troubleshoot when the wiring is tied down that tightly. At some point the guy will plug in a phone or fax machine that will permanently short causing the house to loose dial tone, or the guys hellion nephew little jimmy will squirt his juice box into an outlet that wasn't in use, then I have to try to pull each of the blue white pairs off one at a time to see which one is causing the short. I like to leave my job site looking the way I found it, if not better. My company doesn't usually make that possible due to time constraints.   And although this is totally not your fault, and varies by company, I'll let you have a peek into my daily life. If I have a no dial tone service call, my company gives me 80 minutes to fix it. That time includes driving from my last stop to the central office, making sure dial tone works leaving there, driving to the half way point (different companies have different names for them), making sure it is working leaving there. I then drive to the house and check at the protector on the side of the house to see if the issue is inside or outside. If the drop is over 8 years old, I have to run a new drop to the house, upgrade the lightning/power surge protection, filter the internet with a pots filter, and dedicate a new inside pair to the modem. If the old protector was inside the house (as it was in my area on all homes over 20 years old), I have to move the protector to the outside of the house run a new ground wire, and run a new cat5e to connect the new protector to the old inside wire. This is all even if it is all working at the side of the house.   TL;DR Please be nice to the phone company tech that will be there 4 years after you leave, 1-2cm of slack makes my day so much easier."
cableporn,2su5zd,xLogisticsx,4,Sun Jan 18 18:26:24 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile here in the UK, we have exchange based line test systems that will narrow down your short circuit to within 10m of the fault.  Failing that, a good old TDR will get you down to within 10cm.  If it's in the house, you still have the problem of isolating the particular extension that is carrying the fault and if it's just a low insulation or rectified loop, then your only option is to break down and isolate the low resistance with a multimeter.  And, our drop cables only get replaced when faulty.  Changed one only yesterday that was at least 40 years old.  But I will re-iterate your point on the cabling, please please leave us a little slack to work with.  In general, when dealing with POTS wiring, I will try and leave at least 10inches of slack from the end of the outer sheath on whatever termination I am doing."

cableporn,2su5zd,SomeoneCutCarlsHair,3,Sun Jan 18 17:56:00 2015 UTC,"Cable tech here.  Concerning the RG-6 splitters, an 8-way feeding an 8-way is terrible for signal quality. Each port has a loss of 11dB, so feeding 8 more from that loss would total 22dB. I don't know what kind of signal comes off of a satellite dish, but for cable that would never fly. 10dBmv is a best case level at the ground block, but actually  getting that isn't too common. Better than an 8-way to 8-way would be putting a 2-way before the two 8's. You would minimize signal loss to 14.5dB per port. Still, that is awful for cable. Any return path device would likely not work in that situation. Most DOCSIS 3 data equipment will not lock on a transmit above a 54dBmv. Having a transmit of a 39.5dBmv at the ground block is not likely. For satellite, I don't know if your setup would work, but for cable you should use an amplifier for anymore than 4 lines. Depending on incoming signals, using one could be necessary with less than that. One with no loss to the return path would be best. Extreme makes good positive forward and unity return gain amps, as well as unity forward and return amps. Good job on terminating the unused ports, though.  TL;DR: For cable services, use a good amp with no loss on return path on any setup with more than 4 lines. For satellite, I have no clue."

It's not an ideal setup but he doesn't wan't to pay for any extra SAT receivers and doesn't really care about video quality.  I totally understand the need for an amplifier but wanted to wait and see how the SAT box performed without one.

Do you notice a slow down when running them over TCP/IP? Also why not just run the VMs from your server internal storage? I'm not knocking it just curious.

cableporn,2suk00,Bafflepitch,8,Sun Jan 18 18:37:10 2015 UTC,I'm not OP but I'll take a crack at what's in the rack. From top to bottom.   Networked attached storage that is 8 bay capacity however only 4 bays are being used. Hopefully a RAID 10 for data reliability. Probably a backup server or file server.  Rack mounted power conditioner. This supplies power without fluctuating voltage or amperage for sensitive electronics. Some allow for remote monitoring of power usage.  Probably Cisco adaptive security appliance which is used for firewall and vpn. Depending how fancy he wants to be he can set up a DMZ with it I believe.  Cisco Catalyst 2960s gigabit switch. My favorite part of this setup. It has 4 sfp ports on it for expansion and typically used for fiber connection which he's using one for the downlink to the black Cisco Small business switch below.  Patch panel which is connecting to end points throughout building. Used for computers/internet connected devices.  Cisco small business switch with a fiber uplink to the 2960 Another patch panel  A server with IvyBridge Intel chips but what it is I'm unsure.  Dell PowerEdge 2900 which is a 9th gen PE server. Old but still great for lots of purposes. 8 HDD bays.  Battery back up so if the power goes out you can still do a graceful shutdown.  To the right is Panduit cable management which is glorious. I highly recommend it.    Hope this helps. If you have questions lemme know!
cableporn,2suk00,Jkuz,1 point,Sun Jan 18 21:38:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.   -More questions- Assuming you're correct(OP please confirm), this seems like an effective setup for a large house and maybe a work-from-home/small business setup. Otherwise, wouldnt having hardware of this caliber be overkill?  Also, even with this setup would the limiting factor(depending on location) be the ul/dl speeds from the ISP?   (At my house comcast is a major bottleneck due to substandard underground cabling. I also get speed well below what our plan advertises except under perfect, off-peak times.

I don't think it's much different than owning a super car though. You never can go 200+mph on the highway but it's cool to say you have that option.  You're right that the ISP is probably a bottleneck but in house networking can still be blistering fast. For example, at the university I used to work at we had a meteorology computer that had a dedicated 2Gbps up pipe and down pipe to the rest of the servers on campus to do fast calculations even though our ISP was only 150Mbps up and down for the whole campus.

But in other cases you will see multiple cables connecting one switch to another by trunking the NICs into a single unit.  With one Ethernet cable, you typically get 1Gbps. If you trunk 2 you can get 2 Gbps.  Also good for fail over."
cableporn,2suk00,swy,2,Sun Jan 18 20:31:27 2015 UTC,"If I understand correctly, you're asking why there are multiple cables connecting devices rather than just one.  Simple answer: switches are devices that connect to many endpoints (computers, phones, servers, etc), not just other devices in this rack. It's potentially safe to assume that one of those connections is a ""trunk"" to a router or another switch in the rack, but all the other cables are likely going out to the network.  In here, as OP has already mentioned, the switch has all of its connections going into a patch panel, which then connects out to all the various endpoints in your network. A patch panel seems unnecessary and strange on paper, but it makes for good cable management and organization to have a single point of termination on the rack, rather than a bunch of one-off cable runs going up and down the whole rack to each of the devices directly."

The rent is cheap for the 10x10 office, with no utility fees, but it had no wiring in the storage room. I got to tap on to a 20A line that was unused save for an float-switched A/C condensation pump.  I went to school to be an electrician, but ended up in IT. This was my fall-back trade.

I've even heard of systems that'll do both directions on one strand. (We have a dedicated fiber for TX and another for RX.)  The green SC fiber connectors are usually APC type connectors.

Cableporn, in my opinion, could be pretty cable management as well as a pretty facade with a lot of hidden cables.   For data racks, the only way you're getting away without using cable management is to alternate switches and patch panels and use super short patch cables. And even then, that only works if the ports all line up vertically, which means you can't use 24-port switches at all. Usually this only happens when you have a perfect storm of money, new construction, and someone with the wherewithal to pull it off."

Secondly, watch those tops fans if they are Phanteks ""Updraft Floating Balance"" bearings.  I kept reading threads that that bearing is really just a sleeve bearing and not good for horizontal mounting.  I didn't really believe them until 3-4 months in and they started making grinding noises.  Just a heads up, so you can keep an eye/ear on them, and possibly be ready with a backup plan.

All of the houses have integrated speakers in all of the rooms and almost all that I was in had massive home theaters. One house had a rack for just all of the satellite receivers for TV's in all of the 12 bedrooms and living spaces, this isn't even counting media and data servers and all of the networking gear for IP phones and internet."

I couldn't possibly do the housework myself, even splitting the chores with a partner. So you'd need a housekeeper in at least once a week.  Don't get me wrong: the house was the among the most beautiful I have entered, but I came to a realization: I have no idea how to spend a shit-ton of money on houses. I don't care.  I used to think I would buy a 9-foot Steinway and a nice car. Then it was down to just the Steinway.

Also seems like a very massive rig for a single household. What are the amps and processing?  I see what I believe to be some Crown XTi 1 series in the rear rack, why no spaces between them? It seems like there's plenty of room to allow for more adequate cooling purposes."
cableporn,2shs79,apcreddit,6,Thu Jan 15 09:45:32 2015 UTC,"I use them when I can, and it usually happens on longer runs. The output to these sub amps are unbalanced however.

cableporn,2shs79,apcreddit,1 point,Thu Jan 15 16:03:48 2015 UTC,why the mix of QSC and Crown amps? Is the QSC perhaps a 70v system?
cableporn,2shs79,jtenniswood,2,Thu Jan 15 23:20:41 2015 UTC,"The 70V is probably for the outside and BG inside stuff. For the ""home theater"" it's probably all 4/8 ohm."
cableporn,2shs79,bladzalot,3,Thu Jan 15 23:52:01 2015 UTC,I doubt there's any sources that have a balanced output. It's not going to make a difference in a rack as long as the RCA's are good quality cables and they aren't run along power wires.
cableporn,2shs79,Money_Box,4,Thu Jan 15 13:40:49 2015 UTC,"Ah the old unbalanced/balanced thing...It is home A/V where the sources never have balanced outputs. It also makes no difference in short cable runs. I can't even think of the many times that I have had to run unbalanced line level audio over distances it should not go due to a customer's budget. Even then I never left an install with noisy audio....Well, let's be honest, the USX tower in Pittsburgh was a nightmare of RFI. You could take a speaker with no wires to it stick it's magnet on the ductwork and actually hear a radio station!"
cableporn,2shs79,Money_Box,1 point,Thu Jan 15 13:47:22 2015 UTC,"Once you get into the high end stuff rather than buying powered receiver you buy pre-amp receivers where they do have XLR out. They range from 1500 for an entry level Martinez to 35k+ for the higher end stuff. In the end I don't know if it is really worth the difference. My college ran one of the preamps worth 25k for their admissions theater. Each speaker had a dedicated power amp. It was overkill for the size but they wanted to make sure they had the best when impressing students, even if you would never see it."

cableporn,2shs79,savyur,3,Thu Jan 15 17:43:18 2015 UTC,True.  I guess I was thinking more about when the cables are ziptied together vs. velcro.
cableporn,2shs79,bayareacoder,3,Thu Jan 15 18:08:12 2015 UTC,"It is a big PITA.  Interconnects don't usually ""go bad"" however. It's  mostly from misuse (pulling on the wire instead of the connector), or a bad termination. That's why you rule out the latter of the two by testing every single cable you make. That way your rack stays how you originally wire it; nice and neat."

There is no training teaching you how to do it, you have to figure it out. Rack management is a skill taken for granted but most people setting up and maintaining the racks don't know what they are doing, I know I didn't when I started.

Luckily they have started giving us a budget so we will be able to start buying patch panels and cables so we can clean up.   ""we need this now"" is also a big one, alot of the wiring that was just run has no labeling. so today my boss and i spent 4 hours running around one building unplugging, plugging in, and identifying where the runs go and if they are split pairs or solid runs.   we have one IDF that has all the ports terminated to patch panels, but the patch cables that were created are all around 3 feet. the planned cables for replacing will probably be 12 inches, and pre created."

I just started with this company in may and it is going to be hell fixing the wiring mess.  we have a retired 2nd floor idf that i didn't realize was still in use. we had a good 8 port switch in there that i pulled, found out the next day that a printer was still ran up into there. the printer in question is 4 feet from a switch that has been put in since. Sometime in the near future i plan on pulling back the line and plugging into the close switch. the 2nd floor idf runs back to the mentioned switch. It goes from the switch, runs up two floors, terminates, ran into a switch, ran back down 2 floors, to the printer."

The best thing to do is to piggyback another operation like a router or switch upgrade and ask for the the biggest maintenance window you can get.   If stuff like mapping the existing cabling, taking pictures, preparing labels is prepared in advance, mounting accessories, moving, labelling, recabling is relatively fast.  A small 12U wiring closet can be rewired in less than a couple of hours, full racks take around 4 or 5 hours.   Typically I try to get a maintenance window for 12 hours between 7pm and 7am and that's enough for :    whatever network maintenance I'm doing. redoing a couple of racks do a wireless survey cleaning up the mess   I'll then hang around until noon to make sure everything is ok.

You do have the capacity to map your ports (where are they coming from, and, where are they going.) Most simple switches with management have the ability to let you label a port. Best shops I've ever walked into have Cisco or Brocade, and I'm usually ok unless some fucktard plugged in the Cisco switches and left everything on the native VLAN. If that happens, all bets are off. I treat it like a place with a deployment of HP or Dell switches.  Seriously... Best place to start is trying to gather data, compile a port map. Next, who cares. Buy new cables and plan. When ready, you will hand the cables and clipboard to your mom and she could rewire it if you really made an effort.  And for the love of god... Label your cables, both ends, with info about where the cable GOES TO and COMES FROM for THAT SPECIFIC END OF THE CABLE. This means that info is reversed on both sides of the cable, so no matter which side you read, you know what it is connected to on the other side.  Source: I've done all the stupid things (trace cables, unplug the wrong one, found the switch in the rack that wasn't mounted and destroyed it.)"

cableporn,2sbnun,Kodomachine,2,Wed Jan 14 04:52:21 2015 UTC,"Like the other post, it's safety first for voltage on the line. However what's in the picture is called a TGB (telecom ground bar) with that wire (a TBB telecom bonding backbone) going to the entrance facility of the structure where it will tie into the TMGB (telecom main ground bar) if the facility is being built to code and standards.   The bar serves as a reference to ground for all components of a telecom room (think of all those grounding studs on equipment) to minimize contact and air electro-static discharges, and to ensure all electrical equipment is operating on the same reference 0v of a ground. This is why the system is recommended to all tie together at a single point before it's physically grounded, to keep away electrical gremlins."
cableporn,2sbnun,collegeatari,2,Wed Jan 14 14:43:45 2015 UTC,"Like water electricity follow the path of least resistance, grounding a device acts like a drain that can flush excess electricity that would otherwise ""spill over"" potentially damaging the device.  A shielded cable is a cable with an extra bit of conducting material wrapped around your cable pairs, it could be a wire, a mesh or a foil. Its job is to pick up extra electromagnetic or radio-frequency interferences that could leak inside or outside the cable.  Because the energy intercepted by the cable shield needs to go somewhere your shielded cables need to be connected to the ground usually through the patch panel itself connected to the grounding bar."

Your battery wires are piano-strung.  Not sure if it's just the camera angle, but your mounting may be off level for one of the boxes.  They don't look quite the same as each other?

I don't follow football, and didn't know who he was at the time. We had a private room in the back of the restaurant, no more than a dozen of us, and I was just talking to him about computers. I eventually asked him what he did for a living, and he just looked at me funny, smiled, and said ""I coach a small football team called the Miami Dolphins.""  He was really a nice guy, and the look on kids (and dads) faces when we walked out of the back room was priceless...   I guess I missed my opportunity to be an IT guy for the Dolphins."

cableporn,2s3mom,gheide,13,Mon Jan 12 04:40:38 2015 UTC,"Hey! A question I can answer. You would be very surprised just how much high tech is in sports these days. For the NFL in particular, email and a few other minor services (AD, etc) are provided by the league. But there are a lot of systems that are not. These include digital video capture (every game, every play,) tagging and serving of said video (by player, by play type, by team,) and coaching assist programs. Think of a couch being able to sit down with a player and pull up their plays, highlight them and what they did, etc. In addition, every team does their own scouting and draft day programming. In the case of the team I worked with they even had programmers on staff, year round. Then there are the ticketing and point of sale systems that are extremely important. Like any business they also have accounting, HR, legal, security, and other business systems on site. And of course none of this would be possible without the back end infrastructure, and a pretty solid backup strategy, IT deployment and support, etc.  For the team I worked with the IT staff was around 10 on-site (counting management, support, programming and part time help.) They had the assistance of people from the league office as well for certain problems. On game days, it wasn't uncommon to have additional help as well, many from local carriers for voice/data, many from the broadcast crew, some for the stat crew, etc.   All sports these days are high tech. I even know IT folks working for NASCAR, you'd better believe there is a lot going on there as well.  Source: Did contract work for, and later volunteered and helped locate employees for an NFL team."

cableporn,2s3mom,ranhalt,2,Mon Jan 12 04:54:00 2015 UTC,As opposed to what other kind of patch panel? Cat6 and up has keystone as the industry standard now.
cableporn,2s3mom,mattdahack,1 point,Thu Jan 15 02:40:45 2015 UTC,"Umm, a regular punchdown patch panel. Keystone panels are far from standard, and I've rarely seen them in use.  Keystone panels make more sense for A/V racks since you can get keystones for things like RCA inputs and hdmi. But if you're terminating dozens of network cables, you almost always use a regular patch panel since they're cheaper (typically half the overall price), easier to install, and look cleaner in the end. With a keystone panel, your cable needs to run perpendicular to the panel in the back. But on a regular patch panel, all your cables can run parallel with the panel in the back making a tight, neat bundle that can be yanked on without coming undone."
cableporn,2s3mom,ecib,6,Sun Jan 18 20:07:32 2015 UTC,"Cat6 and up is moving toward keystone panels. They're becoming industry standard. They also offer making your telcom room and location have matching, colored jacks. Here, for example, we do white, red, black, and yellow jacks for our locations.  You can run your cable parallel with cat6 keystones, you just don't use the strain relief cap. But it looks terrible, in my opinion.  I don't really see how being yanked on makes a difference. Proper cable management makes that a non-issue."
cableporn,2s3mom,mattdahack,1 point,Mon Jan 12 00:35:27 2015 UTC,agreed. Every higher end cable we've seen is keystone.
cableporn,2s3mom,PBI325,1 point,Mon Jan 12 09:06:43 2015 UTC,"easier to install,   A lot of techs dispute this and find it much easier to term onto a jack and insert into the keystone when working on bundled large diameter cables like 6A. And then again when it comes to certification and the inevitable ""touch-up"" punches on the panel side. Getting your hands and tools onto the 110 plane and to the right pair for a punch down can be very difficult (to say the least) without disturbing another cable. With a keystone you just pop it out, touch it up, and put it back.    Keystone panels are far from standard,    There is no standard here recognized by the industry, just preferences which, as we know, are often driven by inertia and often who gets what into the spec :)  Nothing non-standard (or standard) about a keystone patch panel at all though."

Now companies like Cox, Time Warner, or Windstream, they like to hire anyone who knows a little about cabling. Not the way to go IMO. However there are companies, several where i am from, that specialize in what we call ""Structured Cabling"". Any commercial construction that requires electrical work will hire an electrical contractor. Now a lot of times electrical contractors don't like to get into low voltage cabling like you see here, so they either have to employ a team of guys that do just that, or they hire a sub contractor to do it."

cableporn,2rwzsg,Aperron,5,Sat Jan 10 20:09:09 2015 UTC,"it is common practice to leave what we call a ""service loop"" at each end of the cable. For maintenance or rearrangements purposes. Making a physical loop cause lots of headaches when trying to add future cables or removing one for any reason. creating a back and forth path allows me to keep the cables neat and accessible, while still providing extra footage for possible future use. if you notice, all the bundles could (if necessary) take a much shorter path, and drop straight out of the sleeve and down to the tray. Allowing you a lot of extra to work with."
cableporn,2rwzsg,whizistic,6,Sat Jan 10 17:20:06 2015 UTC,"It is called simply a ""Data Rack"" or ""Server Rack"". All cables that are needed for internet, communication, access control, surveillance, etc. originate from here. Think of it like an old operator switch board, in the old days you would call the operator and she would ""patch"" you to the line you were requesting. Here all the ""patches"" are made in advance and stay this way. This is actually called an IDF, or Intermediate Distribution Frame. It is a smaller version and usually provides connections to a section or floor of a building. The MDF, Main Distribution Frame, is the center point that all the IDF's are fed from. hope this helps, i could go on and on lol"

cableporn,2rwzsg,a_leon,1 point,Sat Jan 10 07:30:28 2015 UTC,"I'm curious as to why you would prefer the patch panel?  They take up more room, don't terminate as cleanly and don't give access to the pairs to be used following telecom standard practices like 110 does. For a 300 pair cable I would much rather see a single 110 block versus 7 48 port path panels.  The only people that I've seen prefer the patch panel are people that are afraid of or don't understand how to neatly work with 110 cross connects."
cableporn,2rwzsg,leQuestionnaire,1 point,Sat Jan 10 07:55:02 2015 UTC,"I think patch cords look cleaner than 110 cross connects, full stop. I hate when the ""phone"" cabling is separate from the network cabling (e.g. on a backboard, not in a rack), because POTS is dying, and it is a waste.  Many times has a colleague used a 110 to rJ45 patch cord to connect a ""phone"" station cable to a network switch.    That said, If you are working where POTS is everywhere, dealing with > 300 pairs, sure, telco 110 is great. My MDF is 12 racks of nothing but 110.  In the OPs pics, the other end of that 100 pair should be in a real frame.    Basically, if you're in the VOIP realm with just those few POTS lines left (like burg/fire, credit card, bluelight) having all station cables be networkable cat6a and using a 25 or 50 pair cable punched down on a 24 port patch panel in the same rack that goes back to your frame means you can just use patch cords for cross connects, which I think looks better than any 110 I've ever seen. (though I admit it makes bridging difficult, so I do that on the other side).    Our design guide for telecommunications to buildings has gone from 2-pair per 125 sq ft to 50 pair per 15,000 sq ft. My PBX has lost 800 analog ports in the last five years. Half my DIDs come in on SIP trunks. Softphones are the future. Analog will be necessary for a long time, but we can hide its worts."

cableporn,2rw1m6,klui,1 point,Sun Jan 11 02:43:51 2015 UTC,Flapping. You only attached the top. If you push on the 110 block on the back of the patch panel it'll flap. If you put them diagonal it won't flap.  Switches and other equipment should both be on the bottom set if you're using 2 because physics dictates it'll stay stuck to the top by its weight.

If I was going to nitpick...which I am, just to be a bit of an ass...  I would have given a little more play between the shutoff valves on either side of the circulators and the pumps themselves. There's no real reason to have them attached directly. A couple of inches play would allow for easier replacement and service."
cableporn,2rtt88,AmishRockstar,3,Fri Jan 9 05:22:37 2015 UTC,"I see nothing wrong with the circulators attached directly to the valves, If you need to replace one its just four bolts.

I work in a chemical plant turning valves every day and this looks really nice."
cableporn,2rtt88,shrk352,1 point,Fri Jan 9 10:49:00 2015 UTC,"All good points you make, but I still like the separation. It gives you a little more room to switch them out for something with a bigger body in the future if needed.

Plus with the valves in the closed position and the arm on the valve I bet at least one of the bolts is harder to access."

cableporn,2rtt88,beartrapper25,1 point,Fri Jan 9 16:36:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I like the piping... I mean, you come off the heater and tee off to a manifold, but shoot off to another part of the room from there.  It feels like it could have been better planned.  Looks like someone just monkey patched more manifolds in as they went along on the cold side.  ""Oh, I need some water there.  Let's just put a tee here and a manifold!  Hmm, I need a filter for drinking water.  Here's a blank spot, now to find a water source close..."" I also can't tell where the input is, and there is no common flow to it.  The water goes left, then right, then up, then down...  Does the water heater have a pipe running out the side and the top?  My father redid the pipe in the house I grew up in and he had a main trunk line that everything branched from.  The trunk line run the length of the basement and he put in a tee where water would run to various needs.  It's all very straight forward where the water is coming from and the direction of flow.  It comes from the pump (well water), goes to a softener where another main is added.  The hard and soft water carries on parallel to the water heater where he branched and added a hot water main.  There are now three main pipes in parallel that turn to feed the house.  The hard water is used to run to spigots outside along the run and the hot/cold softened water is branched off where needed for the kitchen, bathrooms, and such.  I think if I had worked on the room here, I would have grouped the manifolds together a little better and worked on the optimal layout a bit more.  It looks neat and orderly, but as stated, it looks like it was placed on demand with little expansion consideration and then expanded upon."
cableporn,2rtt88,nschubach,5,Fri Jan 9 08:18:34 2015 UTC,"This is actually a very nice install. It is for both domestic water heating and space heating. The wall hung veismann is actually a 98% efficient boiler which needs to be piped with a primary secondary loop system. The manifolds are for radiant space heating where the tank is an indirectly fired domestic hot water tank. The webstone isolator valves on the pumps are probably one of the best things invented or circulator pumps. Makes swap outs a breeze. The pumps, regardless of whether they are grunfoss, taco, or B&G would fit the span. The pumps shown are very specific pumps for this application and should be replaced with the exact thing."

cableporn,2rtt88,thavi,3,Fri Jan 9 17:38:32 2015 UTC,7 waterpumps? Why on earth would you want to do that? You usually have one (maybe a second one for permanent hot water circulation) and a four-way valve instead.
cableporn,2rtt88,I-am-redditor,6,Fri Jan 9 13:56:00 2015 UTC,"So you can control the temperature in 7 different zones, I'd bet."

The pump would turn on if at least 1 zone needed heat.    It made the logic slightly more complicated, but that was an acceptable tradeoff."

cableporn,2rsb6d,Andalycia,3,Fri Jan 9 07:32:07 2015 UTC,"Well, signal strength is very important in coax. You have strict upper and lower margins, measured in decibelmicrovolts (dBųV).

cableporn,2rsb6d,javi404,3,Fri Jan 9 13:44:28 2015 UTC,"You are correct, there is more signal degradation with coax and we design to have the shortest length possible, but there are other factors at play for us.  With thousands of distinct signal paths we're very concerned with electromagnetic interference.  Were testing for analog signals and therefore the signal to noise ratio is extremely important.  We get more accurate results if each signal path is shielded independently.  In the digital world noise is much less of an issue.  Hope that answers your question!"

For example: if the Accounting office is room, 100 and includes ports 70-80, chances are on the switch you patched those ports are consecutive so you an apply a vlan to accounting by adding 10 consecutive ports on the same switch to that vlan, and not 10 random ports all over the place on different switches etc.  It may be more work, but it makes things cleaner at the panel and in your network config.  If its just a flat network with nothing fancy, then you can do what these guys do and just not give a shit which cable is patched where."

Anytime you hire these guys you need to make sure they are doing it exactly as you specified or else they take shortcuts like in that video, and its funny cause the guy was like looking for an answer and the guy doing the work was like ""this is easier.""!

They would install electrical face plates and leave gaps between the plate and the drywall, then just forget to use caulk to fill in the gap.  Or install an HDMI cable into a keystone jack but the cable just wouldn't work.  Of course, I did take one of the lowest bids, so perhaps that's another case of ""you get what you pay for""."

It is recommended by standards and it really helps.   B.5 Cable and patch cord identifier Cables and patch cords should be labeled on both ends with the name of the connection at both ends of the cable.    Any unique number on wrap around laminated labels at both extremity will work, it doesn't have to mean anything. It really helps tracing cables."
cableporn,2rls00,bazrkr,3,Wed Jan 7 11:39:29 2015 UTC,"While true it is nice to have these labels in place, it's not actually a ""recommendation"" at all levels of telecommunication environments. TIA-942 is a broad sweeping standard, but their TIA-606 (latest revision is B) goes into further detail on cable administration.   Mainly places that are classified as ""Class 1"" (being premises that are served by a single equipment room) do not need horizontal administration. Being that this looks like your typical TR, I'd say it has backbone cabling to an equipment room/entrance facility. So this is probably a ""Class 2"", which would be recommended by the ANSI/TIA standards to label the horizontal links along with the backbone lines (and it should have a labeled TBB!)  Also, while unique numbers per horizontal link are great, there are other factors to think about in terms of differentiating the patch cords from the equipment cords. Some great labeling schemes I've seen make it incredibly easy to understand looking at just the patch panel as to what the cord is and what equipment/WAO it's connected to.  The 606B standard recommends using colored patch cords, with green going to network switches, and blue for links to the WAO, white/grey for backbones, etc etc. Of course each location will most likely implement their own schemes, but it can cut down on the length of the label drastically.   Either way, the more you know!"

When using type SE cable, leave a service loop outside the panel, not inside.  I do this by leaving a large bend in the wire with extra slack that can be pulled in.  Deal with the slight extra effort it takes to get the wires in straight.  Once you get the hang of it, it is easy.  Also, strip the NM cable closer to the connector.  Then make sure all your lengths and bends are identical when approaching your connections.    The inside of the panel should look like the inside of a piano.  Everything straight and perfect, and in the proper place.  It takes time and plenty of errors to get to this point.  Not bad though, keep it up, take pride in your work, and you will get better.

cableporn,2rjpx3,toasterinBflat,7,Wed Jan 7 19:36:37 2015 UTC,Why are there those two loops on what I assume to be the main feed?
cableporn,2rjpx3,tinantron,12,Tue Jan 6 20:55:29 2015 UTC,"If you ever have to redo those connections for what ever reason, or change the panel to something that might have the main lugs lower, the extra wire created in the loops facilitates this. Also in bigger services such as 200A which uses 4/0awg aluminum, it makes it ALOT easier to put the wire under the terminals."

cableporn,2rjpx3,avatar307,1 point,Tue Jan 6 22:16:59 2015 UTC,"Two-phase electric power:       Two-phase electrical power was an early 20th-century polyphase alternating current electric power distribution system. Two circuits were used, with voltage phases differing by one-quarter of a cycle, 90°. Usually circuits used four wires, two for each phase. Less frequently, three wires were used, with a common wire with a larger-diameter conductor. Some early two-phase generators had two complete rotor and field assemblies, with windings physically offset to provide two-phase power. The generators at Niagara Falls installed in 1895 were the largest generators in the world at that time and were two-phase electric machines. As of 21st century, two-phase power was superseded with three phases and is not used in the industry. There remains, however, a two-phase commercial distribution system in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; many buildings in city center are permanently wired for two-phase [citation needed] and PECO (the local electric utility company) has continued the service.

cableporn,2rjpx3,CaptOblivious,1 point,Wed Jan 7 02:38:28 2015 UTC,"Nice wiring!   I have a question though, why they/do you call that a single phase panel?         It's clearly got 2 phases plus ground coming into it.       I find this question particularly vexing as I have Chicago's (apparently unique) 3 phase with a wild leg power in BOTH of my businesses.    (For those lucky enough not to have to deal with it, the wild leg = 220 to ground and the other 2 are 110 to ground and 220 to each other AND 220 between either of them and the wild leg, and frankly I have no idea how that works.)"
cableporn,2rjpx3,jeannaimard,2,Wed Jan 7 02:40:32 2015 UTC,"To understand this you have to understand the transformer which the power originates from. Those two ""Phases"" you talk about come from either end of a single phase 240 transformer. Thus it is a single phase supply. The transformer has a connection point in the middle of the winding called a centertap. This center tap creates a 0V point which splits the 240 in half because half a winding = half the voltage. This is why its called split phase. Because its one phase, split in half. If it was 2 phase there would be multiple windings connected to a multiphase supply."
cableporn,2rjpx3,mikemol,1 point,Wed Jan 7 04:58:19 2015 UTC,"It's single phase because there's only one active cable (the red and black).

Zip ties, due to their narrow width, exert a great deal of pressure more than velcro straps.  This pressure can fracture or even completely break the fiber.  Even if it doesn't do it immediately upon application, it can happen down the road when things are moved around and there is tension put on the bundle.  The corner of the zip tie can dig in to the casing and cause the fracture."

Worse yet is when a paper dip cable gets taken out by a car accident. Hours upon hours of listening for tone, and carding the pairs, ugh! I don't miss it at all. Unfortunately, most of the old timers have since left the business, taking with them a crap load of knowledge and craftsmanship.

Instead of running separate internet lines between their buildings, their IT guy said it was easier for him to setup some sort of microwave signal sender/receiver between the buildings for everyone to all share that one connection. And boy was their internet slow... his excuse for this was it made things so much easier for him to monitor and control the connections through one building rather than having setup through the three buildings used. Needless to say, at lunch I never came back. Thankfully I was pretty good friends with the owner and he completely understood that it was quite overwhelming with such an incompetent IT setup. Soon afterwards they ended up outsourcing to an outside company to come through and clean everything up for them."

I know that here in Scandinavia, the cable prices jump massively if you order some of the less ordinary cable - for large services, we usually stop at 240 or 300 square millimeter, and just run parallel after that."
cableporn,2qk9o9,Andalycia,3,Sun Dec 28 11:08:14 2014 UTC,Also factor in pulling tension. It's much easier to pull smaller cable. Also conduit fill. Most supply houses don't carry larger sizes but will have smaller in stock.
cableporn,2qk9o9,michelework,3,Sun Dec 28 15:01:23 2014 UTC,"FYI: 750kcmil is the largest you would ever pull for low voltage runs. Usually, you stop at 500kcmil. Anything larger starts to become a pain in the ass to work with."

When coming into an existing mess how do you avoid the massive downtime when reorganizing cables. If I went to my boss and told him I wanted to take down the data center for a couple hours(or days) to make it prettier I'm pretty sure he wouldn't think this was a good idea.

Most of the professional data centers and large business enterprise stuff is up to standard (well, mostly standard), as its a matter of air flow with proper designs. There is also a case to be made with channel link's properties as the weakest part of any channel is the patch/equipment cord for certifying a link for operation.   I'd suggest reading into the different data-center white papers for why a tidy data center (aka Equipment Room, MCR, MDF for web search purposes to avoid the data center buzz word) is important for a business. Especially important for businesses that want to ensure a 5-9's (or greater) of uptime.

cableporn,2q7sy0,cameron_,5,Tue Dec 23 22:00:38 2014 UTC,"If you are going to mount a smart relay to din rail, you might as well put din rail mounted terminal blocks.  It will make it look much cleaner.  Make the din rail longer to get the space needed for the TB's.  It also makes bringing in the field wiring easier for a cleaner look.  I work on a SCADA system that uses Modicon M340 modules and every terminal on the PLC has to be wired to a terminal block."
cableporn,2q7sy0,-mikey,3,Wed Dec 24 04:38:44 2014 UTC,Yup. Just make the din rail a little longer and snap some terminal blocks in there. Having the power open on that bus bar is a little worrisome as well.   Keep at it with the given advice and you'll be golden.

cableporn,2q6dpb,iaindings,3,Tue Dec 23 16:40:05 2014 UTC,"We spent a long time talking to them about this...they have to get all their kit tested by GCHQ (UK comms intelligence) before it can be sold over here. This is in education, so it's not critical anyway, but I know BT (who own 90% of UK telecoms backhaul) use huawei stuff extensively, so if it has backdoors then we're screwed on a national level :)"
cableporn,2q6dpb,iaindings,3,Tue Dec 23 17:03:08 2014 UTC,"Interesting but possibly nonsense - GCHQ won't even contemplate testing hardware themselves until a third party approved lab has done most of the validation work. There's only a few things CESG will look at approving and most fall under CPA (commercial product assurance) which is accreditation to be used for UK government security marked data.   I'm sure CESG are well aware of huwawei with the controversy they've sparked but they publish which products have been tested and approved - there are no huwawei devices on there. There isnt even a security characteristic ( the criteria they test against) which would apply to switches. They'll only approve products which are specifically security focussed. Now this isn't to say that you couldn't use these (or other) switches to run an IL5 network for example - obviously you need switches! CPA just makes it simpler to do the accreditation. Switches generally don't have a huge impact on the security of the system, any supposed ""back doors"" could be mitigated by not having internet access available to the devices - which would likely be the case anyway.  So I call BS on that bit, it sounds like a vendor trying to reassure you. I'm sure the issues have been blown out of proportion but  I'm pretty confident that CESG have done no evaluation work on them   http://www.cesg.gov.uk/servicecatalogue/Product-Assurance/CPA/Pages/Certified-products.aspx"

For anyone interested, here's a great example of how that could actually take so long: Thunderhead Falls by Phyter, one of the all-time best coasters ever made in the NL community. It was made with v1.x of the program which only had support for static 3ds models (the track, trains, supports and skybox are about the only things made within the program, everything else was done with something else, probably 3DS max or maya or blender). V2.x has a much more powerful engine (better graphics, support for scripting all kinds of crazy stuff into rides, multiple coasters in a park, etc), and a ride like this would be eerily realistic and jaw-droppingly good looking. And while I'm at it, it's available on Steam now!"

First there is a patch panel attached to the rear posts of the rack that have cable going to drops that are in an area that hasn't received new drops and thus the patch panel won't reach to the front of the rack.  For now I have the yellow patch cables running to it, but hopefully within the next six months we'll get approval to finish out and have completely new drops.  Also as you can see the cables running to the drops were hastily put in without any organization.  That is a project I'll have to undertake another day.

cableporn,2px1qd,yeahright04,5,Sat Dec 20 23:43:34 2014 UTC,Unless your switches support a stacking configuration I would suggest going with a star or ring topology (With proper STP). For your back side patch panel a low cost solution might be to add a front to back link with patch panels. This way you would be doing switch->cross-rack-link->patch-panel-on-the-back. You could also use this same link for backside server ports. Run all the front-to-back cables before begining punching them down and patch 1 whole side before starting the other ensuring perfect cable shaping.
cableporn,2px1qd,MightyMike_GG,1 point,Sat Dec 20 23:51:11 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the input.  I'll look into getting STP setup.

cableporn,2pe3dl,michal_m,7,Tue Dec 16 15:06:13 2014 UTC,"In Europe we use 10.7-12.75 GHz Ku band (10.7-11.7 Lo band and 11.7-12.75 Hi band). Polarity is either horizontal or vertical. Combine these and you get four combinations: H/Lo, H/Hi, V/Lo, V/Hi. There is one dish and it has quattro (not quad) LNB with four outputs, each output permanently carrying one of those band/polarity combinations, so you basically get all contents of this particular orbital position on four coaxial cables. The setup in the picture has eight cables so it's for two LNBs (both are probably on the same dish but it could be separate dishes as well). Now, those cables go to a multiswitch. The receiver requests one out of four of these combinations (by putting up 13/18V for polarity and 22 kHz signal for band) and the mutiswitch passes requested signal to the output from which the request came. Here we have two satellites so on top of voltage and 22 kHz signal there is also a diseqc signal sent to choose between satellites (LNBs). Theoretically the multiswitch could have infinite number of outputs. You can also create cascades to support enough receivers. Most receivers these days are PVRs with dual tuner (for independent preview and recording of different channels or VOD download in the background) so it requires two outputs from the multiswitch. Satellite signal takes up the 950-2150 MHz so multiswitches usually have terrestrial radio and TV input to add 88-108 MHz FM radio and (usually) 470-790 MHz DVB-T. Apartments have outlets with built-in filters and four outputs (2xSAT, 1xFM, 1xTV)."

cableporn,2phd07,journeymanSF,2,Tue Dec 16 18:14:25 2014 UTC,"That's good for wrapping and storing long lengths of cable that you intend to fully un-wrap upon the next use. Something like this is good if you are making a short connection that you intend to leave the same length either permanently or semi-permanently, and it requires nothing but the cable itself, so no zip ties, velcro, or other cable management."
cableporn,2phd07,ci5ic,21,Wed Dec 17 00:26:21 2014 UTC,How is this easily extendable? You'd have to unwrap it to extend it.
cableporn,2phd07,Chirimorin,9,Tue Dec 16 17:06:59 2014 UTC,Here's what I've been doing for years: Easily extendable cable
cableporn,2phd07,margaryna,3,Tue Dec 16 19:58:46 2014 UTC,"you wouldn't have to completely unravel it, you could just loosen enough to get the length you want and it would probably stay together"
cableporn,2phd07,Scylax92,1 point,Tue Dec 16 18:49:42 2014 UTC,"True, but you still need to unwrap part of it."
cableporn,2phd07,Chirimorin,2,Tue Dec 16 22:07:54 2014 UTC,It's pretty easy to unwrap.
cableporn,2phd07,ci5ic,0,Wed Dec 17 00:23:20 2014 UTC,I still wouldn't call it easily extendable to be honest.
cableporn,2phd07,Chirimorin,2,Wed Dec 17 08:41:54 2014 UTC,"Take the small end and pull it through the hole in the middle of the cable. The whole thing stays as one ring still, and now you have a slightly longer bit of cable sticking out."
cableporn,2phd07,uk_randomer,7,Tue Dec 16 19:10:37 2014 UTC,Looks like you'd have to unplug it to extend it. I wrap in a similar way but I don't consider it easily extendable because of that.

cableporn,2phd07,acidboogie,12,Tue Dec 16 20:09:20 2014 UTC,This is a fantastic way to destroy a $50 cable
cableporn,2phd07,douchecanoo,3,Tue Dec 16 20:23:19 2014 UTC,Where are you spending $50 on an iphone cable?  I dont think they are that expensive from Apple directly.
cableporn,2phd07,--seaker--,5,Tue Dec 23 14:39:29 2014 UTC,Care to detail how?
cableporn,2phd07,Housecarl_Winslow,1 point,Tue Dec 16 16:58:11 2014 UTC,How what? How to roll a cable?
cableporn,2phd07,My_usrname_of_choice,1 point,Tue Dec 16 19:15:28 2014 UTC,Yeah it looks braided almost. Otherwise what's special about it?
cableporn,2phd07,Housecarl_Winslow,1 point,Tue Dec 16 19:22:21 2014 UTC,Nothing. You just make large loops while twisting the loose end around the axis of the current large loop as you go
cableporn,2phd07,My_usrname_of_choice,1 point,Tue Dec 16 19:48:50 2014 UTC,Thanks! It looks more intricate than that on first inspection...I've been rolling cables in that method for ages though. I guess I'm just an amateur.
cableporn,2phd07,Housecarl_Winslow,-2,Tue Dec 16 20:09:37 2014 UTC,I thought I was in /r/lifehacks. Then I remembered that I've unsubbed from that shithole ages ago.
