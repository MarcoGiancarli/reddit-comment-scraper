In this situation, a laser sight works great, you can track your target (with the added bonus of using it for intimidation, which was the goal).

They are not asking for money, just asking for the business to shut down haha.  It reeks of personal grudge and this could really be awful for a tons of people as it could destroy marriages and reputations etc.  As well one of the sites looks like a sugerdaddy or essentially a prostitution ring:    Now with over 1,327,000 members  Established Men connects ambitious and attractive girls with successful and generous benefactors to fulfill their lifestyle needs.   I don't feel bad for anyone involved here.  Gonna break out the popcorn now"
Cyberpunk,3dxyzb,FearAndLawyering,28,Mon Jul 20 13:40:54 2015 UTC,"The Impact Team’s beef with Avid seems to lie with the Full Delete feature offered by AshleyMadison—a $19 service that allows users of the site to erase their profile, and all accompanying information. According to The Impact Team, that service is a lie—it claims that although profile information is removed, credit card details, including real name and billing address—remain online."

Cyberpunk,3dxyzb,ragnaROCKER,18,Mon Jul 20 20:54:40 2015 UTC,Dude's right though.
Cyberpunk,3dxyzb,refusetoargueonline,8,Mon Jul 20 20:58:32 2015 UTC,"Why? It's a personal choice that has very little impact outside of some, probably dysfunctional, dyad. It's scummy, but a lot of personal decision are that way behind the scenes.   Cheat or don't cheat, but unless we start airing all personal choices it should probably remain private."
Cyberpunk,3dxyzb,ragnaROCKER,5,Mon Jul 20 22:56:32 2015 UTC,"Cheat or don't cheat, but unless we start airing all personal choices it should probably remain private.    eh, it's subjective. it is fucked up when anyone gets doxxed, but on the other had fuck them. sometimes when you are a shitty person shitty things happen to you.  if this ends up getting some people that are being cheated on out of a toxic relationship without getting fucked to hard in a divorce and into a place where they can find someone that actually deserves their effort and love then good.  if some awful selfish assholes get some karma coming back their way then i am totally ok with that. and i don't think it is a bad thing that someone who is willing to lie and pull shit like that might not be able to pull it on someone else because there is warning/proof out there."
Cyberpunk,3dxyzb,refusetoargueonline,3,Mon Jul 20 23:05:14 2015 UTC,"I know, but neutrality in behavior is kind of assumed/owed people. Who decides morality and all that? I don't feel bad for them, but I don't see this as a good thing."

Doxing and putting out financial info is a bad thing. Cheaters getting outed is a good thing. Different facets can cause different conclusions."
Cyberpunk,3dxyzb,refusetoargueonline,4,Mon Jul 20 23:13:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing with you, but I'd love to know why you think cheaters getting outed is good.   Full disclosure, I basically cheated on my first real gf about 15 years ago. Not sex, but still crossed a line. I told her and we broke up because I felt super guilty, and I've never cheated since. I have no great bit of skin in this game."
Cyberpunk,3dxyzb,ragnaROCKER,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:27:19 2015 UTC,basically because if they are outed then the person they are cheating on now knows and can make an informed decision on how they want their life to go and who they want to spend their time/effort on.  otherwise they are in a toxic relationship based on lies and false pretenses.
Cyberpunk,3dxyzb,rossbot,3,Mon Jul 20 23:36:42 2015 UTC,"On an abstract level, cheating is bad because you're violating a contract and committing fraud.  On a tangible level, it can destroy a marriage, which has over and over again been shown to impede the success and prospects of the children from that marriage.  So yeah, please shove your libertine shit back up your ass and learn to recognize externalities and consequences."

Furthermore how many people will search through the entire thing?  Will it be put up in a way that CuriousHusband#42 can easily figure out whether or not his wife is on there?  Will you be able to look at it and see info like ""Jill Smith"" Credit Card #: 4111111111111111?"
Cyberpunk,3dxyzb,MobiusNash,2,Mon Jul 20 22:30:22 2015 UTC,"By ""social media turning this into a sensation"" I meant this spreading by social media and then make its way to every morning talk show, news page and eventually the evening news. Potential evidence against 40 million cheaters? That's ripe for that kind of treatment. What's trending on twitter is news these days.

Cyberpunk,3dxyzb,Kilted_Samurai,15,Tue Jul 21 01:16:49 2015 UTC,Thats interesting!  I wonder how many pre-nups could be nulled-and-voided as a result of this leak!
Cyberpunk,3dxyzb,Kilted_Samurai,8,Mon Jul 20 14:11:43 2015 UTC,"Here's what doesn't make sense to me. This ""Impact Team"" claims to be doing this because this company has a policy to delete your data for a fee that the hackers say is a lie. So they are punishing the company by releasing said data on the Internet. ""Hey cheaters we're defending your right to privacy by doxxing all of you. You're welcome."" What?"
Cyberpunk,3dxyzb,Lune__Noir,4,Mon Jul 20 23:56:48 2015 UTC,Its very hypocritical.  At the same time it shows the fact that AM are charging people to be removed from the site (thats like penalizing someone for deciding they wanna keep their marriage instead of cheating!) then not actually deleting the info.  The fact that some people paid $20 to be removed and their info is now in the hands of hackers because it wasn't removed... seems to be the point.
Cyberpunk,3dxyzb,hypersleepwalk,3,Tue Jul 21 00:08:12 2015 UTC,The problem with that is that you would assume that the people who wanted to have their information (profile pictures/contact info) removed would do so once they were done using the AM/EM service.  The Impact Team is threatening to release all of the clients data. Some or most of which likely still wanted to continue using the service.  Until today that is.
Cyberpunk,3dxyzb,Lune__Noir,6,Tue Jul 21 00:39:32 2015 UTC,"This is the kind of thing that scares me about the internet age. Not this situation specifically.. I'm not a member of that site. But this is a lot like an ongoing comic written by Brian K Vaughn called Private Eye. The plot is basically that sometime in the near future ""the cloud erupts"". Basically all digital information suddenly becomes public. Every text you've ever sent. Every email, every website you've ever visited, every comment on sites like this, all become public. Naturally a lot of lives are ruined, and now privacy is the world's number one resource. If anyone's interested in reading it, its really great, and Brian Vaughn is probably the greatest comic writer in the biz right now. And what's really great is he uses a pay what you want format for this book so you can pay absolutely nothing if you want. Here's the website"

Cyberpunk,3dxyzb,JIVEprinting,11,Tue Jul 21 01:54:03 2015 UTC,"A little analysis. Morality tale aside, I find this most interesting from an accounting perspective. This website has absolutely, positively no choice but to cooperate. Websites like these are not allowed to get hacked, it's big legal trouble if they do and the more people affected by data breaches and the more sensitive that data, the more trouble it is. This is a cataclysm. I'm interested how the hackers plan to prevent AM from reorganizing under another name, or if they do. The most they could really lose in that case is publicity investment, which is a far better deal than the myriad class action lawsuits and related trouble they're facing as is. (As usual, the decisive weapon is accounting.) However, I'm also outside my expertise and actually hesitate to talk out of turn this time. Anyone know anything?"
Cyberpunk,3dxyzb,KaptainKraken,4,Mon Jul 20 16:58:29 2015 UTC,"The gov cant really even try to defend them either because adultery is still against the law, and the law cant come to the aid of criminals.

Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing. After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered.""  The Resurrection was a crucial component of why so many thousands of stable, eminent priests and rabbis suffered torture and alienation all their lives for the name of Christ.  If Jesus had died like any other fringe philosopher, the New Testament would never have been written.  That's to say nothing of my own personal, established history of healing sickness and injuries by praying for people in his name.

Sincere religious beliefs absolutely can motivate people to do, or endure, brutal things. A great many Mormons were murdered (by the government itself at times) during the first century of this country's existence, rather than give up their religion. Is this evidence that Joseph Smith really received a revelation from Moronai?   Another good question to ask yourself: Why was such a remarkable event not recorded in any other contemporaneous text?

Those people deserve to have some kind of happiness in their lives, even if it's getting laid on the sly.  Some are swingers that like to have affairs and then get off on it again by telling their spouse all about it.  If that's their thing, more power to them.

While I certainly think cheating on your spouse is wrong, and a hugely shitty thing to do, I don't think this response is a punishment for that behavior.  The impact is heavy on the users, sure. Who else gets impacted? Every credit card company suddenly has to scramble to protect their assets. Families, even ones that were already dealing with the issues of relationship problems, suddenly have their problems in the spotlight. The government will step in and investigate the hack, pissing away tax dollars.

Some people in the fan replica community make props not as 1:1 reconstructions of those found in the source material, but as canon-consistent original pieces that would be found in the universe. Kaneda's bike would have been based on some preexisting motorcycle model in neo-Tokyo, so one can assume that other versions would exist, just like limited edition runs of vehicles in real life (Shelby GT mustangs vs. stock mustangs, etc.)   The maker of this bike probably enjoys inserting themselves into the Akira world in a small  sense by creating a bike with an authentic Akira-aesthetic that is uniquely theirs. The prop maker wouldn't be interested in creating Kaneda's bike, because it IS Kaneda's bike, not theirs.

And I don't put much stock in reviews.  But it was really poorly made.  It was edited like a bad student film, incomplete and rushed to completion for the end of the semester.

Aliens  come  to Earth  to  enjoy the  human  emotions  of sex and  violence  by  messing  with some  young  punks  and  fashionistas.   - Babylon A.D.:  Vin Diesel. Special  mention  for being both a  good  film  and a pretty bad  film.  I  thought  that the  first  part  of this  film  was  very  well made,  and the  last  part  was  very  poorly made.

We  build a  powerful  AI,  give it  control of the  nuclear arsenal, and tell  it   ""Your  mission is  to  stop  human beings from being killed.""

I also strongly recommend the work of the two more influent directors of the 'japanese cyberpunk' era.  Shinya Tsukamoto's The Tetsuo movies and Shozin Fukui's 964 Pinocchio and Rubber's Lover.  The japanese cyberpunk in the cinema has nothing to the with most of the western conceptions of the gender . It's all about the violent shock between flesh and meat , and what results from it . It owes more to the work of Cronenberg , and his 'new flesh ' concepts and  the industrial landscapes of Eraserhead than to Blade Runner."

Anyway, to me this is a crappy movie because it went out way too late, Johnny Mnemonic and Hackers were released two years before and yet still present a more interesting view of the hollywoodesque intertubes."
Cyberpunk,3dx4vs,luguergio,2,Mon Jul 20 15:17:07 2015 UTC,"I think anything is worth watching, one can always just stop it and move on. And it is not like you are paying much for it since both Nirvana and Until the End of the World are very hard to purchase, but easily downloadable elsewhere.  Another one I would recommend is Werner Fassbinder's 1973 film World on a Wire. This movie was made before cyberpunk ever existed, but is extremely important. Trailer."

I usually don't refer to wikipedia in discussions, but here I'm gonna do exactly that because you're specifically referring to Neruromancer  - without really understanding how the term punk relates to the story and its dramaturgy:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk   Like Case, many cyberpunk protagonists are manipulated, placed in situations where they have little or no choice ../.. These anti-heroes—""criminals, outcasts, visionaries, dissenters and misfits"" ../.. This emphasis on the misfits and the malcontents is the ""punk"" component of cyberpunk.   Like Damien Walter describes today's cyberpunk genre on The Guardian, I could use the same words about this subreddit.   ../.. cyberpunk was quickly ground down from a “dissident influence” to a worn-out sub-genre, as hundreds of books co-opted Gibson’s style but entirely missed his message."

One metaphor I've seen on reddit before was that Neuromancer was literature, while Snow Crash was more like a comic book. Comic books can be very serious and address real issues, but at the end of the day, they'll always be comic books.  I'm trying hard to make a film comparison, but I'm not coming up with two that are linked in the same way that Neuromancer and Snow Crash are. The best sort of comparison that comes to mind immediately is that Neuromancer was like the original Matrix movie -- serious, meant to be viewed as a story and not a telling of a story. Snow Crash is more like ""Brazil"", where things are just so over-the-top that you know on some level the filmmaker is kind of going wink wink see what I did there?"

I have a portable LED-based UV emitter expecially designed to fit a human's mouth and prescription glasses that automatically change their colors in response of ambient light.

Also if you look at the api its streaming from its not every second like the video makes it seem. Furthermore there is no indication of whether or not any of these deaths were militants or civilians.

If the ATF okeys this they risk having a bunch of automatic guns turn up with mechanisms that are technicaly bionic arms.

There is the often mentioned 10% rule, where of the full group of people who visit a site, 10% will make an account and occasionally contribute something.

Early days everything was text heavy simply because bandwidth didn't easily allow for much else. Hell, images were remade out of text to form ascii art as a workaround at times.  The whole ""picture is worth a thousand words"" things hold true. It is quicker to obtain information from a picture or video for us than it is to read through a series of paragraphs. Text language is useful or at least a better medium for many ideas still, and we see it used where appropriate. But now that it is so easy to create and spread pictures and videos, it isn't a surprise that this is the norm. I can upload a video of shenanigans with friends, or I can type out the story. Which will convey more information in the least amount of time to consume?  People not bothering to read longer articles, or watch a long video as opposed to just a still image or 5 second video is to be expected to, as the internet is filled with the masses...(continued in a different post as I speak of a different idea)"

And with a LOT more people online than say 6 years ago, you may not be interested in reading what all these yahoos have to say and you can get it mostly from the picture.  Problem is that pictures gives you only a literal glimpse and NOT the full story...  Not enough to get you involved really.  We have youths today that are more politically aware than any generation ever before.  Young people see politics, news, scandals, leaks, injustices, etc. like never before but they aren't voting more and don't even seem to be protesting more.  Snowden gets an upvote!  Police Brutality gets a downvote!  But people aren't invested enough to actually take it seriously (and vote at the polls).

The company wants you to anyway, because they want people to feel welcome at the business.  Don't ask people to be genuine in service industries, because you might not like what you find. And don't ask them to enjoy their job, because a lot of their job involves dealing with absolute dicks who request unreasonable and stupid shit.  Seriously, smiling all day is so tiresome.

I think consent culture is cool and actually not silly at all, nor have I found that it ""upsets the mood"" in any way.

It wouldn't really be a stretch of the imagination to see it happening to plastics or printed boards.   *edit: not the Oklahoma city bomber but the Unabomber
Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,Shock223,8,Wed Jul 15 14:02:19 2015 UTC,And it only took them 20 years to catch him!

Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,Roast_A_Botch,6,Wed Jul 15 14:15:02 2015 UTC,"both. either.   just building the bomb would be hard to do unnoticed. it's not like you can search for the anarchist's cookbook without getting some serious heat. even looking into pressure cookers could get you on a list. FBI also looks into industrial grade fertilizer sales and other chemicals that could be used to build explosives.   then, they're'd be drone printing and construction. probably more traceable than you believe. if you make it on your own, they can test the pllastic, find out the model of printer that uses it, and probably back track sales and ownership from that. also, it could very well be that printer makers would start incorporating identification in their models so that it'd be more easily traceable for law enforcement. going back to the original xerox copiers, this is a thing.  lastly, there's good old fashioned police work. who's got a grudge? who benefits? who's capable? chances are the hypothetical perpetrator would leave at least a subtle trail.  now, there is a good touch of human competency in bringing these pieces together to yield a conviction. not sure from what i've read about the NSA's tools that they'd catch someone in this perfect crime, but as Shock said, they got the unabomber, and that guy had just about the hardest trail to track ever. the more technology necessary to commit the crime and the more ""on the grid"" you need to be to do it, the better shot they'd have at nailing you."
Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,mo-reeseCEO1,15,Wed Jul 15 14:58:36 2015 UTC,"From what I remember, they only got the unabomber because someone ratted him out. Correct me if I'm wrong, too busy to Google now."

Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,maxstryker,4,Wed Jul 15 16:42:16 2015 UTC,it's not like you can search for the anarchist's cookbook without getting some serious heat.   What ? I had that in a text file fifteen years ago. You mean searching for a physical copy ?
Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,Narthorn,3,Wed Jul 15 18:39:11 2015 UTC,"Mmmm, yeah there definitly are some pitfalls."
Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,MLApprentice,3,Wed Jul 15 16:01:31 2015 UTC,"Explosives instructions are available on TOR(the anrachists cookbook is useless).  You can buy Ammonium Nitrate at Lowes, small purchases over time and spread out.  3D Printers can be made at home, with OSS, and you can order plastic online, to an abandonded residence, using burner VISAs.  You can still buy 2D printers that don't print yellow barcodes, as it's not a law but voluntary.  The Unabomber was not caught due to any police/fed work.  His brother saw a sketch, had been suspicious about Ted's activities for a while anyway, and it finally clicked.  He turned him in.  The feds investigated for 20 years and probably would've never caught him on their own.  The second(OKC first) largest bomb set off illegally on US soil was in Chicago by the Outlaws against a local chapter patching over to the Hell's Angels.  No one was ever convicted for it."
Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,Roast_A_Botch,3,Wed Jul 15 15:56:48 2015 UTC,"Depends on what kind of bomb we're talking about here.  If you want to get enough fertilizer for, say, a decent ANFO bomb to carry out a terror attack (plus any ancillary equipment needed), you're probably going to pop up on someone's shit list pretty quickly (especially if you have a high threat index due to various other red flags, like lots of overseas travel, keywords in searches, nationality/ethnicity, etc.) You can probably defeat that pretty easily by just stealing some, though, as long as you travel in an undetectable manner (don't use your own car because of license plate readers, don't bring your phone so it can't leave a trail of tower connections, pay for gas in cash, etc.)  Now, if you're just talking about something small to deliver for a smaller, more targeted kill? That's harder to track down and easier to get the materials undetected. A basic pipe bomb can be made relatively simply from numerous consumer-available materials. You could then use this as your ""bank job bomb"" (although you could just have an empty pipe with a wire running out of it; it's not like they want to find out the hard way if you're bluffing) or your fun-sized assassination device. The ubiquitousness of the materials makes it much more difficult to track, especially if you space out the purchases, use cash, and buy them at geographically distant locations.  Or you could not do all that and probably have a much happier life. That would probably be a better choice.  Hi NSA! (Hey, while you're reading this, I saw this great YouTube video a while back - you know the one I mean - can you send me the link to that? I cleared my browser history and now I can't find it again.)"
Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,NovaeDeArx,2,Wed Jul 15 14:44:47 2015 UTC,"All of what you've said is easily circumventable.   The anarchist's cookbook, and pressure cookers are small-time stuff to what you can do if you really set your mind to it.   Two examples already in the public consciousness, the Harvey's Wagon Wheel Casino bombing, and the Mythbusters' sawdust fireball experiments. Two fatality-free examples of a kind of potential lethality that outstrips your examples hugely.  I do not condone anything I have mentioned above, except the Mythbusters, those guys are great."

Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,Memitim,3,Wed Jul 15 23:48:15 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that just be drone pilots?
Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,magmasafe,52,Wed Jul 15 14:54:51 2015 UTC,Thermite. An explosion would risk the pieces being blown in different directions and not completely destroyed. Thermite is easy to make and would be a hotter more controlled burn. I wouldn't think it would be too difficult to keep the electronic non-mechanical components in some sort of double-lined casing filled with thermite and a magnesium strip. Then remotely triggering the magnesium strip to heat up and ignite would burn the rest of the thermite in a rapid but controlled incineration without too much concussive force.  Now I'm definitely on a list.
Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,Toribor,20,Wed Jul 15 16:07:50 2015 UTC,It's a large drone. You'd hear it and see it in time to get out of the way. The only thing thermite would do is make it shit out an iron egg. I would think that a bowling ball mortar would be more dangerous.
Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,MentalRental,13,Wed Jul 15 20:57:23 2015 UTC,"Not debating the practicality of the whole thing, just saying destroying the circuitry would be better accomplished with thermite rather than more concussive explosives."

Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,MentalRental,2,Wed Jul 15 15:05:15 2015 UTC,"If you were targeting materiel you wouldn't even need a separate payload; land the thermite drone on the engine with some nice, powerful magnets on the legs and ignite a hefty thermite charge.

If we can make them balance and throw a pole from one quadcopter to another, I don't see why we couldn't make them aim at fairly close range.

Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,Mouth_Full_Of_Dry,3,Thu Jul 16 01:28:04 2015 UTC,How about a weapon that has built in recoil dampening or uses gas for the cycling? (I think something like the desert eagle.. wiki confirms)
Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,Virtualization_Freak,7,Wed Jul 15 21:02:09 2015 UTC,.50AE despite damping is still going to have significantly more recoil than .22 magnum.  Probably too much for that drone platform. Also a Desert Eagle is 4+ pounds (unloaded..) compared to the ~1 pound PMR-30.
Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,Mouth_Full_Of_Dry,6,Wed Jul 15 20:54:01 2015 UTC,"You can always do a proof-of-concept test. If your drone can survive being kicked by a donkey, it might be able to handle a .50 desert eagle."

I was looking to overcome the lack of recoil for cycling; not saying such a large round is necessary.

Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,Virtualization_Freak,2,Wed Jul 15 15:02:52 2015 UTC,how about some compensating force like a small rocket blast from the back at the moment of discharge?
Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,CyFus,3,Wed Jul 15 15:48:27 2015 UTC,or just another rotor that turns on when firing or better yet a second pistol and they fire at the same time. Theoretically should still work with higher calibers as well

Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,nannal,161,Wed Jul 15 16:34:20 2015 UTC,it is soul calibur
Cyberpunk,3ddjwu,bobyd,2,Wed Jul 15 18:05:33 2015 UTC,"That is a FN Five-seveN. it shoots a 5.7X28mm round. The felt recoil would be minimal.  The Five-seveN is a delayed blowback weapon, this allows it to achieve a full cycle even if a user were to ""limp wrist"" (not provide proper support for the mechanism)  If the firearm were a short straight blowback design such as a glock. it would have quite a few issues cycling.  accuracy isn't as difficult as one would think, with a gyroscopic mount, one could easily achieve a balance for the bore line, and one could write software to use the cam to create a set of crosshairs for the bore line."

Also, the primary issue with the handgun on the drone is the lateral kick when the handgun is fired.  It would be interesting to add a single servo on the z-axis to keep the barrel level, allowing the drone to gain forward momentum to prevent the kick.  Another possible solution is to add a small lateral motor and propeller that would only engage a fraction of a second before the gun fired to prevent kick."

Building an ""unhackable"" phone is practically impossible for a huge range of reasons.  Three of the most important:  1.) Designing a secure phone that runs on inherently insecure infrastructure is solving the wrong problem.  The current mobile data ecosystem is woefully insecure and any phone you build, no matter how secured, will still have to place calls over the existing infrastructure.  Your updates and network traffic will still have to flow over existing links.  You can build crypto into certain services, but this only solves a narrow range of problems.  2.) In most instances, you don't hack the phone, you trick the user.  If your threat model for your mobile device only contains remote, purely technical threats, then you're going to get owned.  Most people's phones are owned when they install dodgy applications from an untrusted source. Or click on links in a spear-phishing email that takes them to a carefully crafted home page.  Or steal the phone while they're logged into it.  Or etc.  It's far easier to hack human beings than it is modern computers, even mobile ones.  OpSec must come first and human beings are almost universally horrible at OpSec.  3.) Users don't actually want the tradeoffs required for perfect security.  Ever tried to use well-configured SELinux running on secured hardware with strong multifactor auth and HSMs and etc.?  It's a pain in the ass.  If you're not protecting data that's absolutely critical to your continued survival, there's no reason to do it.  Security, like everything else in life, is a tradeoff.  All of this is excluding the fact that they're using proprietary ports and custom OS rewrites, both of which are almost guaranteed to introduce vulns.  Security is not a feature it's a process and the new shininess is almost always much less secure that the old, scarred, and hardened.  There's also the fact that they're using biometrics for auth, which is a terrible idea.  After all: if you think changing all your passwords after a breach is a pain in the ass, try changing your fingerprints."

On a recommendation from another redditor, I picked up Altered Carbon by Richard K Morgan instead and enjoyed the writing style much more.

Cyberpunk,3dfpt1,Funktapus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:51:14 2015 UTC,"I love his books, but I think you're very right here; the thing is that Gibsons books don't tell you ""the story"", or the major thing that is happening in the world, they show you how it interacts with the lives of our viewpoint characters. And of course, they're all used to the world they live in, so there's no place for them to do an infodump, and nobody for them to really infodump to.

Im almost done with Zero History right now, and at times the style is disorienting and confusing and there are a lot of odd atmospheric details that aren't necessary... but thats GOOD.  I feel like you guys missign the point a bit.  Ive read the two trilogies (bar the last 100 pages or so of Zero History) and listened to a great audio version of Burning Chrome.  Seen a few documentaries, read and listened to several interviews, all that jazz.  Not only is the plot (in the common sense of a thread of events and characters) seemingly the least important thing going on, disorientation is a major part of the experience.  I thought Holy Fire was a little confusing at times, didnt knreally know what was going on in a few places... jsut like the main character.

So my wife did surgery on a patient, and they have to see them for follow ups, which are free (for like 60 or 90 days or something like that)...that is the doctor can't get paid for the follow ups if it directly relates to the surgical procedure.  Well, the patient rolls in a few months later (say 6 months or so) for something unrelated.  The insurance kicks it back and won't pay because they claim it is STILL a follow up.  Now, imagine if this happens for 10%-20% of patients seen/month.    Insurance companies kick back claims in the hope the doctor doesn't have the time or energy to fight the number of claims kicked back.

As a matter of fact, there are a number of things that are considered standard of care that are expensive for the patient/insurance, but the doctor sees a big goose egg for.    I understand how private practice works and I understand, at least to some extent, the billing and coding end.  Can you explain to me how it works?  How does a doctor get paid more by doing more procedures, if they don't fall under the standard of care?

Took us three appeals, letters from my family doctor, my dentist, and the surgeon, and months of phone calls, to finally get the insurance to agree to pay for it, IF I GOT IT DONE BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR, which, thanks to months of fighting with them, left us about a 3 week window to get it done.

These follow ups are not 'free', they're included in the initial payment to the physician for the surgery. If the patient really and truly was seen for something unrelated to the surgery (left knee pain following a right knee replacement), modifiers need to be appended to the superbill.  If a procedure is done, modifier -79 (“unrelated procedure or service by the same physician during the post-operative period.”) needs to be added.  If an evaluation and management service is provided (e.g., work up for the knee pain), modifier -24 needs to be used (""Unrelated E/M service by the same physician during a post-operative period."")  When applying the diagnosis codes, it's best to use a different diagnosis code from whatever was surgically related.  There may be overlap with ICD-9 diagnosis codes since they don't specify laterality, but with ICD-10, it will be easier to state 'this diagnosis is specifically for the 4th finger on the right hand'.   Maybe your wife's experience is different than mine, but when I worked in physician billing for several years, I rarely if ever saw denials that weren't directly due to problems in the coding and billing of an account."

Symbicort is actually one of the most affordable maintenance inhalers right now because of the manufacturer's 25.00 guarantee program. The pharmacy will bill the primary insurance first, then the Astrazeneca coupon which is available for free online. The first inhaler is actually free, then the subsequent refills are then 25 a month. As long as you don't have a Medicaid or Medicare plan, everyone is eligible. If anyone ever has a problem with affording brand-named medications, ask your pharmacist about programs like this.  As a side note, I do feel OP's frustration.

They used a CFC propellant (inhalers may have been the last legal use for the stuff) and changing the propellant would mean they had to go through the whole drug approval process again.  There's not a chance in hell OTC adrenaline inhalers would be approved now, so production stopped and the supply eventually dried up."

Cyberpunk,3d9rna,appBlu,2,Tue Jul 14 18:52:55 2015 UTC,"I would take a different approach to this risk myself, but such things are a personal choice. This would be my line of thinking:  risk of buying correct medicine 100% that you pay $300, but 0% chance of death risk of buying medicine that isn't authenticated; pay $30 but 10% chance of incorrect medicine (article says 90% of medicines seem to be real). if you are in that unlucky 10% you will either have to pay $300+ then to go to hospital in an emergency as you have no cure on hand but if you won't be able to afford that cost (which is why you went online) the outlook is quite bleak. If this reasoning is correct, 10% of the time you take the chance of buying online you die."
Cyberpunk,3d9rna,Ironybear,3,Tue Jul 14 19:50:11 2015 UTC,"Expired or incorrectly manufactured medications can have hugely different side effects. Although the whole idea of the 10% killing you is a quite drastic estimation, it isn't completely untrue. You could have a negative side effect which could send you to the hospital, or if, for example, the inhaler didn't work as intended when needed, could result in death."

I never said that cyanide would be in the inhaler, nor poison as the other reply suggested. So, no, I do not believe there is any cyanide, in fact air or some other powder is probable.  What I DID say was that if they cannot afford the $300 for the medication, they will still not be able to afford the medication if they found out that what they bought was a dud and so would be in trouble."

The crime is only a necessity to get it that cheap.  I am in no way disagreeing with his commentary on the US healthcare mess; nor suggesting that doing what he needed to do to keep his wife healthy should not be his priority.  I just think the way it is written to be heroic is a little skewed.  If i wrote about how the huge cost of Lamborghini's in this country are astronomical.  I then realized I could buy a legitimate one on the dark web for a very affordable price; so I did, because it was the only way I was ever going to afford one.  this obviously paints a very different story...

A lot of hand labor goes into the Lambo.  The inhaler is mass-produced, the mechanism is probably made by dirt-cheap labor in a factory, and the actual medicine is probably also mass-produced in a dirt-cheap stable chemical factory process.  The drug company could make plenty of profit selling the inhaler at an affordable price, they choose not to in order to maximize shareholder profits at the expense of peoples' lives and financial security.  And they would probably fight tooth and nail to prevent facts regarding that from ever becoming public like they ought to be.

Another little criticism though: I felt like it was trying to be a Neuromancer-style story a little too hard.  Big picture is that I enjoyed it, but it doesn't stand out to me.  I think other stories treated all of its topics more interestingly than it did.  I love Schismatrix, though, for feeling more unique, for following more inspired ideas, and for following them much further."

The punishment is being used as a ""big stick"" to compel good behavior in most of the population.  2) It's probably for figuring out who just blew themselves up. Hard not to leave some DNA at the scene of a suicide bombing. Once they have a name, social media trail and other profile data can be used to build a list of people who had contact with the bomber. This set most likely contains other future bombers and at a minimum the people who equipped and trained the person."

Cyberpunk,3d942e,Femaref,10,Tue Jul 14 15:24:10 2015 UTC,"Offline? Very, very unlikely.   In Counter-Strike sadly that is no longer true. At ESL One: Cologne 2014 French player KQLY played on LDLC who made it to the semi-finals. In their quarterfinal match against Polish team Virtus Pro, KQLY pulled off this ridiculous shot. He was later banned by Valve's VAC anti-cheat software and admitted to hacking. LDLC won $22,000 and Virtus Pro left with $10,000.  Fellow French players sf from Team Epsilon and Emilio from Team Property were also banned.  As far as Adderall goes, that shit has been around competitive gaming for the last 15 years."

Cyberpunk,3d942e,L1nden,2,Tue Jul 14 18:44:00 2015 UTC,Don't they provide the rigs for each player?    Seems to vary. The problem you hit is that people get very used to a certian set of equipment.

Anarchy Online. This one had a lot of other stuff going on, but there were really strong cyberpunk elements mixed in with the other elements (and the game does take place on a distant planet completely owned by a megacorp.) It also lead to... Snow Crash. I didn't actually read it until much later, but I hung out pretty often at the RP clubs in AO, where Gridstream Productions would stream all sorts of industrial, techno, and metal.

This, the first piece of cyberpunk that really snagged my imagination wasn't Blade Runner, but was instead the Shadowrun game on the SNES, which I must have first played when I was around 12 or 13. Hackers and magic and dragons was just the thing to capture my adolescent attention. While I went on to appreciate more advanced cyberpunk as I got older, I've always had a special place in my heart for the Shadowrun universe (video and pencil and paper version both)."
Cyberpunk,3dbewt,ZincLloyd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:48:29 2015 UTC,"In about 1988 I found a three part article on ""the exciting new genre -Cyberpunk"" in a friend's computer magazine - the Games Machine.  It just intrigued me so much I had to buy them off my friend. I devoured the three part feature. It was like crossing into adulthood. It went out and bought the books and told everyone a new world was arriving.  It's odd to see this disturbing, prophetic, tech dystopia, vision of the modern world described in a kids magazine about video games.

Akira and Aeon Flux around age 7-9 on MTV, back when they started playing anime and other animation on MTV (don't think they still do).  Then as I started playing more games I got a demo of System Shock when I was 10 and played as much of that as I could.  Played Quarantine around the same age.  Played FF7 when I was 13 or 14, which I would say is definitely cyberpunk meets fantasy.  And G-Police when I was 15.  Since then my experiences have been all over watching whatever anime and playing whatever games I can get my hands on.  Stuff like Tron, Ghost in the Shell, Neotokyo, Hard Reset, etc.  Really happy to see more games, anime, and movies doing cyberpunk themes.  I guess as we progress more towards a cyberpunk-like world we will probably get more of that stuff.  Can't wait for 2077."

And even ignoring all the socio-political conflicts that are going on, which one could easily see in a cyberpunk light. Just going out for a walk at midnight on a Friday night in a big city is going to feel Cyberpunk as hell.   And any time I have travelled to Tokyo, I cannot help but feel that I have landed in another universe, 50 years in the future, where people look different, speak a language I no longer understand, the culture is different, loads of gritty diners where you can have some yakitori in a tiny space as the neon lights pour in through the windows.

Cyberpunk,3d1plt,Hellkyte,7,Mon Jul 13 02:58:22 2015 UTC,Historically pretty common. Bridges were a good place to build a house. You had a supply of running water and somewhere to go to the toilet. Access to the river as a transport link was always useful. Shops built on the bridge would attract passing trade.   Selling the rights to build houses would bring in money for the bridge builder.   Heh if there is a cyberpunk derivative set in the 13th century and it hangs onto the punk side london bridge would make an excellent setting. See:  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Claude_de_Jongh_-_View_of_London_Bridge_-_Google_Art_Project_bridge.jpg  I'm not aware of any modern bridge like that (certianly not on that scale although I can think of a few with buildings) the closest probably being piers.

Cyberpunk,3d2za9,Datathrash,2,Mon Jul 13 03:03:09 2015 UTC,I like this idea!  I especially like the bioluminescent angle.  Some of what I've seen can definitely look neon-esque
Cyberpunk,3d2za9,kuhzoo,2,Mon Jul 13 03:07:25 2015 UTC,"You can probably also mimic neon with LEDs and the right kind of fiber optic tubing.  Really expensive right now, but I know they've already invented glass that gives off light evenly across it's length.  I do see OP's point about the style of neon though.  Edit: glass that emits light evenly along it's length.  https://youtu.be/12OSBJwogFc?t=6m2s"
Cyberpunk,3d2za9,Metlman13,5,Mon Jul 13 19:49:37 2015 UTC,"I believe Neon Lighting first came to widespread use around the 1920s, being immediately associated with grand visions of the future and the gilded age that most of the 1920s was.  In the 1930s, it came to symbolize an era that had passed, as though a great age of the world passed, and came to be symbolic of a world that could restore itself to that glory.  In the 1940s and 1950s, it came to symbolize that the gilded age had returned and with it the grand, if not outlandish visions of a powerful science-driven future.  Cyberpunk is more of a Neon light genre because the ideal cyberpunk world is gilded. That is to say it is a society that is in denial and pretends like it has high class and posh while ignoring the seedy underbelly that has always existed underneath as the very framework of their own society they try to paint over and call something else. It also comes to symbolize that man has created its own stars and no longer finds amazment in the stars of the night sky, rather the neon lights that illuminate the city on a dark, cloudy night. In a sense, nature is so far removed from humanity that the only thing left that still connects us to nature is the raw, corrupt nature of our own species.   Indeed, in many cyberpunk universes, nature is described as mostly being dead, with the few animals still existing adapting to the urbanized and synthetic world the humans have called their homes."

Cyberpunk,3d2za9,m_bishop,3,Mon Jul 13 15:47:42 2015 UTC,"There are two things at play here ..   First, it's actually 2015, and LED strip-lighting made to look like Neon is already popular, and there's a ton of Neon still in service. We're starting to see giant TV screens, but those are way less reliable than old-fashioned Neon. So, to say that we need to 'retcon' it into the future is pretty silly. More neon is glowing now than ever before, and it might be fake-LED-driven neon in the future, but as a style it isn't slowing down.   The second thing at play is something Gibson often touches on in his writing ... that a big part of 'Cyberpunk' is about realizing that the only way the sort of future they talk about in 50's sci-fi could possibly occur is if, right before they start writing, everyone throws away everything, tears down every building, and literally starts from scratch with only the newest technology.   Cyberpunk is, at least partially, about how the past can simply keep running, right alongside the future. It's about how we don't stop using fire to cook, just because we've invented lasers, and how it'll all be adopted on an 'as-needed' schedule.   We're already seeing this, where you have someone sitting next to a stove from the 50's, with a laptop sitting next to it.   I think Neon will just still be around, for a really, really, long time, and the idea that we have to make some kind of extra-effort in our story-telling to explain it misses the whole point."

For example, if the suspect declares he has never been inside the house, and the owner said that the suspect has never been allowed in the house. Then they can corroborate evidence of DNA at the scene to the database to determine whose DNA it is and proceed from there.  This can be applied to any sorts of crime. My interest however is that one can get an accurate measure of how many in the world (large database), have a various type of blood. Through various technological advances, analyse the DNA to show abnormalities and compatible vendors.  Citizen_ID_0102441 has O Negative blood, and is compatible with Patient_ID_19390, who needs a transfusion and kidney replacement. Automated Email sent out for request of a kidney.

Cyberpunk,3cua1g,voyaging,51,Sat Jul 11 01:15:23 2015 UTC,Polarized glasses/sunglasses are vertically polarized to block the horizontally polarized light from glare such as the sun reflecting off the road in front of you. Apparently computer screens are polarized vertically as well. Note how the screens have been rotated 90 degrees for the installation. That would put their light 90 degrees out from polarized glasses thus blocking most of what they emit. Make sense?  Edit: spelling.

Cyberpunk,3cua1g,grumbel,9,Sat Jul 11 15:02:40 2015 UTC,"AFAIK most screens work by polarizing the light one way, and then modulating the polarization angle on a second angle to determine how much light to let trough. Hence it coming out at a certain angle."

(Which is not the U.S. living wage, mind you.)"
Cyberpunk,3cvm4b,illtill8614,9,Sat Jul 11 15:14:40 2015 UTC,"yeah that's true. brazil's prisons are hell on earth; horrifically overcrowded. emphasis on horrific. certain regions of brazil have an extremely violent culture, where murder and assault are commonplace; vast inequities remain between upper and lower classes across the country, and poverty and crime are pervasive. social conditions like these result in a never ending flow of criminal offenders, that the brazilian prison system has been incapable of handling w/ proper efficiency, to put it mildly. locking these ppl in cages w/ very little supervision, food, health care or other basic services is a recipe for abject misery. rehabilitation falls to the wayside as a result, and corrections officials do everything they can to prevent escapes. things are so serious that the prisons have basically said 'fuck everything else, we are just going to try to do our best to keep these crazy motherfuckers from BREAKING OUT....' but it happens anyway, from time to time.  as dangerous as some of the incarcerated criminal in brazil can be, when they are locked up they are vulnerable. to their enemies; whether they be rival gang members, organized crime, or elements of the police or local militias who engage in consistent acts of extrajudicial killings. the inmate is vulnerable to these threats in jail because they are immobilized, for one; and for two: they have no way to protect their loved ones. also, you get the weak who end up behind bars (think nonviolent offenders) for years because of brazil's pretrial detention policies with hardened criminals; exploitation is bound to take place.   all that being said to say this: prison gangs are about protection. inmates found needs for networks to protect themselves in such an inhospitable environment, from the multitude of threats they faced. federal detention and inmate transfers, in combination with social and political movements, spawned tightly-knit groups of like-minded individuals who innovated brazil's gang culture. since the recruits of these organizations were, by default, all criminals, organized criminal operations were the logical choice for financing. thus began power struggle within the gangs in prison, supported by their networks operating on the street; transfers and alliances spread across the penitentiaries and across the favelas and the other poor communities that many of bazil's criminals return to upon their release. with such a hotbed of intolerable conditions, criminal elements, and illicit markets of drugs/extortion/financial crimes, even extending to terrorism, prison gangs were almost promised to form  prison gangs in brazil conduct riots and strategic kidnappings, assaults and assassinations on the outside through messages sent to members operating on the street. this 'violence capital' serves to bolster extortion/protection rackets and facilitate political/judicial corruption; the resulting strategy for prison gangs to coerce valued political/business targets began to resemble the following: ""take the bribe or commit suicide, and if you want to go to war? we'll take it to the streets until the law folds..."" . this dynamic has played out in major cities and rural communities across brazil  the major brazilian prison gangs maintain command and control in the urban centers of SP and RDJ but have operatives throughout the guyanas, paraguay bolivia peru ecuador uruguay and argentina, and investigations have revealed links to transational OC groups like Russian mob and Italian mafia, as well as terrorist groups like the FARC and allegedly Hamas & Hezbollah. the bulk of their criminal enterprise is centered around the control of lucrative drug markets in the infamous favelas of RDJ and SP, as well as Salvador, Belem, Natal, Amazonas, Tri-Border region etc. Drugs may be primary for these gangs but rackets extend to robbery (eg explosives used in professionally-crafted attacks on ATM machines), prostitution, human/organ/eco trafficking and arms dealing, with brazil being the largest legal and illegal supplier of arms to south america.

Unlawful surveillance programmes are just the tip of the iceberg - British intelligence agencies have been extensively complicit in extraordinary rendition, the imprisonment of innocent people without charge or trial, and torture.

They ride around in group on those little electric boards. 1. very rare to have different style like this 2. incredibly rare be openly lesbian (from her Weibo).

Still, if I saw those two go past on a sidewalk, I wouldn't think to look twice.

That is quite rare to see people being openly gay on the mainland, I've always thought a lot of the guys were effiminate, especially with the hipster-ish tight shirts and pants dress style, holding hands, etc (and I suspect some one them are secretly gay and just in the closet) but it is indeed very rare to see openly gay girls.

It's easy to cut corners and make something that'll work for a week, but the wear you put on something when you add weight and movement just doesn't hold up to that approach to design.   So, you can save anywhere from %25-%50 on that kind of stuff by going for the cheapest version, but if you do, it'll be an order of magnitude less reliable, and it's never worth it in my experience."

It is getting to the point where the there's a space for brand-named generic goods.  Like, I can get a cheap USB or HDMI cable from anywhere. There's no way I'm going to pay for a Monstercable, but I am going to shop Monoprice or AmazonBasics because I assume they're doing some quality control.  Similarly, I'm not going to pay $70 for an OEM Qi pads and USB charger, and there are ones on the market for pennies.

Weird how those chemicals ""the evil government puts in the food"" aren't affecting them, and pretty much everyone I know. Guys some people are just stupid or comfortable with the status quo, not everyone is born a revolutionary or genius!

Cyberpunk,3cqoyq,appBlu,3,Fri Jul 10 15:31:05 2015 UTC,"Looks neat! Looks familiar too.  When's it due out?  Edit: Mid-September from the look of it. I'd definitely read a preview, sounds interesting."
Cyberpunk,3cqoyq,AdmiralMango,3,Fri Jul 10 00:42:23 2015 UTC,Looks more like Chris Cunningham's.
Cyberpunk,3cqoyq,luddist,3,Fri Jul 10 02:05:46 2015 UTC,"Sure does, doesn't it. The ""skin"" is more opaque like that, and the sides of the head have exposed metal bits.  Man, Bjork is confusing."
Cyberpunk,3cqoyq,AdmiralMango,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:20:36 2015 UTC,"I think it looks strikingly like the children in The Talos Principle.   I guess there are only so many ways to make an android :) Also, blue/white/black seems to be a very common color scheme!"
Cyberpunk,3cqoyq,Ruzihm,3,Fri Jul 10 16:35:00 2015 UTC,"Cool, same name as a youtube show called H+, which is pretty decent.  I'd love to check out the book"
Cyberpunk,3cqoyq,ironpotato,3,Fri Jul 10 02:18:38 2015 UTC,"H+ was JJ Abrams, yeah? Thought that was fab for a web series."
Cyberpunk,3cqoyq,joetravers,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:37:04 2015 UTC,I believe so. And yes it was pretty great
Cyberpunk,3cqoyq,ironpotato,2,Fri Jul 10 02:37:52 2015 UTC,Budget must have been sizeable. All I can remember were great artificial interfaces and an airplane crash.
Cyberpunk,3cqj1f,Mikroh,6,Thu Jul 9 23:38:47 2015 UTC,Have you seen the documentary?  Excellent work.
Cyberpunk,3cqj1f,chlordane2501,4,Fri Jul 10 02:10:51 2015 UTC,Excellent work!      ftfy
Cyberpunk,3cqj1f,neurofluxation,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:49:16 2015 UTC,Is the documentary available online?

Cyberpunk,3cr5l4,joetravers,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:49:57 2015 UTC,What is that?
Cyberpunk,3cr5l4,fausto240,2,Fri Jul 10 14:16:31 2015 UTC,The device? I believe it is a Kobo glo. As for the book...
