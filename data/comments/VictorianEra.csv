I know typesetting didn't have much rules back in the day, I think for the header it works, but some of your paragraphs will be more inviting to read if they're just a touch less squat."

It looks like you've only used the one. Typical broadsides used more than one typeface. Consider adding some frames or decorative elements. Dover Publications has clip art of genuine Victorian decorative elements and typographic motifs, available for purchase as digital downloads. Also consider varying the size of some of your type sections to emphasize certain information.Remember, Victorians loved excess and this goes for printed materials as well."

By this analogy can also say teachers are rosetta stones to students. Newspapers are rosetta stones for the daily reader. Journalists and scientists are rosetta stones for people. It's a shitty metaphor. it works but you might as well had called it the dog of victorian lit. because at some stretch it carries the same characteristics of a dog at some point.

O home! what dear magic is in that sweet sound, How closely it speaks to the heart, What a word of deep tenderness in thee is found, Oh who from such treasure could part; Could barter the joys of a sweet home of love, For a path in the wide world unknown, Could seek for vain pleasures and heartlessly rove, If they knew the true value of home. Some sigh to be wealthy, some seek to be great, Some envy what others can do, But oh I’m in my lowly estate, For the hearts all around me are true.

They were taken in quick succession with a 4-lens stereoscopic camera. When animated, they create something of a primitive film. They are believed to have been taken by a photographer employed by Mathew Brady.  The Marshall House came to prominence because it was where Union Colonel Elmer Ellsworth was shot and killed while taking down a large Confederate flag flying from the building on May 24, 1861.
