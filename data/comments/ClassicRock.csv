ClassicRock,3e1rnf,Jinbuhuan,2,Tue Jul 21 21:20:44 2015 UTC,She's on this album...
ClassicRock,3e09dc,BillyShears17,2,Mon Jul 20 23:29:10 2015 UTC,So much crap in high school!
ClassicRock,3dzk2k,eddiemarshall,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:23:02 2015 UTC,"On the Back In Black album, I think most of the songs (with the exception of the title track, which fades out) ends with a short Angus solo and then the final chord"
ClassicRock,3dzk2k,JoshDimmock,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:14:57 2015 UTC,Favorite line in the article   As guitarist Angus Young famously quipped in the ’80s after being told that a critic had accused them of recording 10 albums that all sounded the same: “He’s a liar. We’ve made 11 albums that all sound the same.”

When I wake up try to put these things together Of all the lovin' times that we did have I get static in my ears and a hazy picture And I hear your voice inside begin to laugh.  Chorus  I hope that it's only amnesia Believe me I'm sick but not insane Yeah,I hope that it's only amnesia My friends they don't look at me the same.  Sometimes I feel o.k. but when I talk I stutter I can't remember back a few minutes ago The doctors all come up with the same answer Boy if I'm that far gone there's no where else to go."
ClassicRock,3dpd0l,thetoysarealive,4,Sat Jul 18 04:03:55 2015 UTC,"If anyone doesn't know what this is from, it's ""It Might Get Loud"", and it's a great documentary all together (I saw it on Netflix years ago, I would think it's still there). The idea was to take three people with completely different styles and ideas and put them in a room with a few guitars and see what happened.   I'm not a musician, but watching these three just hanging out, talking musical styles and guitars, and jamming together is fantastic."
ClassicRock,3dpd0l,areallybadname,2,Sat Jul 18 12:03:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah it really is a pretty amazing documentary, great to see three different guitarists find their similarities and teach each other some of their differences"
ClassicRock,3dpd0l,11andGratiot,2,Sat Jul 18 17:36:17 2015 UTC,"It's not on Netflix any more, which stinks I'd like to see it."

ClassicRock,3dpd0l,ChristofMcGee,3,Sat Jul 18 23:55:47 2015 UTC,I think one of the greatest parts of this for me was when it was over one of the suggested videos was Jimmy Page teaching them Kashmir... so awesome! Thanks for sharing!
ClassicRock,3dpd0l,ChristofMcGee,3,Sat Jul 18 09:10:57 2015 UTC,"The entire documentary is filled with awesome stuff like that, it's called It Might Get Loud"

ClassicRock,3dpd0l,TheCleanupBatter,3,Sun Jul 19 01:43:35 2015 UTC,Anyone else think Jack White kinda looks like Quicksilver from Days of Future Past?
ClassicRock,3dpd0l,sobieski84,2,Sat Jul 18 10:00:43 2015 UTC,Even when Jimmy is playing Seven Nation Army he makes it sound like Led Zeppelin. It must be his guitar or something.
ClassicRock,3dnda6,eddiemarshall,2,Fri Jul 17 17:58:01 2015 UTC,Thats cool and all... but what a weirdo

ClassicRock,3dp0r3,DeadPrateRoberts,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:04:31 2015 UTC,I don't get why The Beatles Vevo dose not upload videos ever. Still nice to see.
ClassicRock,3dme6x,BillyShears17,2,Fri Jul 17 13:20:12 2015 UTC,"Never heard this song.  Someone in the youtube comments said John had a cold while recording, and he does kind of sound a little weird."
ClassicRock,3dme6x,DeadPrateRoberts,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:01:17 2015 UTC,I saw that as well. At some points he sounds like a nasally George. I always thought that was due to inexperience since it was their first album
ClassicRock,3dme6x,Hack_Fraud1138,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:40:13 2015 UTC,"This is from their first LP Please Please Me. I believe it was recorded in a 12 to 13 hour session while John had cold. Just listen to ""Twist and Shout"" that song nearly killed him."
ClassicRock,3dj3tv,AStraightLine,2,Thu Jul 16 18:04:05 2015 UTC,"Been loving this song recently and it's never been posted here before, hope this is the right place for it, enjoy!"
