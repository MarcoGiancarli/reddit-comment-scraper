NorthernAggression,3b3aif,DonnieNarco,5,Thu Jun 25 18:27:16 2015 UTC,"There was a conscious effort to merge northern libertarianism with southern traditionalism in the 1960s.  Buckley's National Review and Rothbard's Von Mises Institute were built for the sake of marrying two disparate ideologies.  Basically, the original libertarian  Republicans got walloped by FDR and the New Deal.  They could not get elected any longer.  And Northern Democrats were stealing the show, and winning majorities with conservative Southern Democrat support.    Southern Democrats (Dixiecrats) were pretty open to redistribution - at least among whites - and government spending on infrastructure, etc.  But they were often quite racist and socially very right.  Northern Democrats were fairly progressive.  Northern Republicans (there were no southern ones) were often libertarian by nature - wealthy northeasterners, industrialists, and banking interests, etc.    The way they figured to revitalize American conservatism and build an electoral majority was to smash together libertarian economic ideology from Northern Republicans and southern social ideology from Dixiecrats in the former confederacy.  It worked very well.  This is why major libertarian think tanks are in Auburn, Alabama, a short drive from Kileen, where the League of the South headquarters is, and the regional KKK HQ.  And the head of that think tank was Ron Paul's chief of staff - the guy who wrote all those racist newsletters.  And then of course there's Ron himself...  The Koch Brothers never wanted the Confederate stuff in their thinktanks, so they cast it all out for the most part.  That's why Reason and Cato are on the other side most of the time.  It's just a crazy history.  Libertarianism just got tied into neo-confederate movements.  That's how you get overtly confederate libertarian websites like this one."

NorthernAggression,3aoqvj,Liberty_Chip_Cookies,0,Mon Jun 22 07:04:26 2015 UTC,"Matt Guterl is great.  He cuts right to the point:   I object to the use of the flag for a few reasons. On the one hand, I don’t condone it because it’s a reflection of the great treason of the South in the 19th century, of its secession from the Union in defense of slavery, and its rejection of patriotism and nationalism. So just on political principles, the flag is a reminder that the South was once a rebellious and treasonous actor on the global stage.  But what is far more problematic is that there is no way to separate the fact that it is on all of those flag poles and on those license plates, that it's on t-shirts and coffee cups and other paraphernalia, precisely because it was resurrected in the 1940s and 1950s as part of a massive resistance campaign against the civil rights movement. It wouldn’t exist in our national popular culture without this moment, when African Americans fought for their equality, and the battle flag was recovered and redeployed as a symbol of opposition to it.  What was once a very blatant, full-throated defense of white supremacy has now become this gesture to heritage and history that is presented as though it has nothing to do with the civil rights movement. But it has everything to do with the civil rights movement."

I just thought it was interesting and relevant to share.  In case the NYT comes to require user log in from someone:  Confederates in the Jungle  By RON SOODALTER  MAY 8, 2015 7:00 AM May 8, 2015 7:00 am 61 Comments  The Fourth of July celebration has all the hallmarks of a scene from “Gone with the Wind,” or a county fair in the most unreconstructed corners of Mississippi or Alabama. The men, dressed in Confederate gray shell jackets, yellow-trimmed frock coats, kepis and plumed black slouch hats, cross the dance floor to select their partners, elegant young women in colorful hoop-skirted ball gowns. Arm in arm, they step to the rhythms of ancient dances, as the fiddle and banjo strike up the old-time strains of “Dixie’s Land,” “The Yellow Rose of Texas,” “The Virginia Reel” and “Cumberland Gap.”  Meanwhile, families gather around banquet tables loaded down with dishes that are the products of centuries-old Southern family recipes. Along the sidelines, vendors hawk rebel battle flags, Confederate campaign caps, and T-shirts, mugs and bumper stickers emblazoned with slogans like “Hell no, we won’t forget!”  Nearby stands a small stucco-walled chapel. An old cemetery, shaded by Alabama pines and bougainvillea, contains over 500 graves with stones bearing such venerable Southern names as MacKnight, Miller and Baird, Steagall, Oliver, and Norris, Owens, Carlton and Cobb.  The setting is, in fact, in the South – very far south, in Brazil.  The Festa Confederada is held as often as four times a year in Campo, an area carved out of the sugar cane fields outside Americana, a modern city of some 200,000 residents in the state of São Paulo. All the participants are “Confederados” – fifth-generation descendants of Southerners who immigrated here in the days following the Civil War. The entire scene – the dress, the music, food, even the conversation – is a carefully rendered homage to those disaffected rebels who elected to leave their conquered nation and make a new home in a foreign land.  By 1866, the future for countless Southerners appeared bleak. Not only had their bid for nationhood been destroyed; in many instances, so had their homes, their communities and their livelihood. The prospect of living under the harsh fist of the conquering North was more than many were willing to bear. As one Confederado descendant wrote, “Helpless under military occupation and burdened by the psychology of defeat, a sense of guilt, and the economic devastation wrought by the war, many felt they had no choice but to leave.”  There were other reasons. For some, the prospect of laboring alongside former slaves was unacceptable. And then there were those adventurers who hoped to find gold or silver in what was being widely touted as a tropical paradise. Whatever their impetus, for tens of thousands of Southerners, the promise of a new beginning in a new land was irresistible, and Latin America beckoned.  The Southerners’ knowledge of agriculture made them an attractive asset, and a number of countries, including Mexico, Honduras and Venezuela, competed to colonize the disaffected Americans. The most favorable offer, however, came from Brazil’s Emperor Dom Pedro II. Desperate to expand the cultivation of cotton in his country, he put together a proposal offering an impressive list of amenities, including the building of a new road and rail infrastructure for conveying crops to market. Brazil had been a strong ally to the Confederacy throughout the war, harboring and supplying rebel ships. And although Brazil had closed its ports to the African slave trade in 1850, it would not abolish slavery for another 38 years. Of all the Latin American nations, Brazil was the one with which the Southerners felt the strongest bond.  .  Photo  Joseph Whitaker and Isabel Norris, two early Confederate migrants to Brazil.
