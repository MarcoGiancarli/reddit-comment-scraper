Quebec in ~10 years could be interesting as their peak demands are on par with their peak generation. Ill guess will see initiatives to get people to switch from electric to gas heating.

Even with a 100% fossil fuel based electric system, ground source heat pump is better than using gas directly.  See David Mackay's excellent book:  http://www.withouthotair.com/c21/page_144.shtml  Manitoba is certainly colder than Britain, but ground source heat pumps work even in the cold.

Before that decision was made, the Confederate flag also represented the Southern States, a rural lifestyle, anything country, NASCAR, and so on.  There's a lot of people that value those things, but haven't caught up to or don't agree with the ""urban"" decision that the Confederate flag stands for racism.  This is similar to how Westerners are sometimes shocked by visiting a Buddhist temple and seeing swastikas.  Symbols are usually cultural, not universal and there is a cultural divide between rural and urban populations."

ontario,3ds35p,4ray,0,Tue Jul 21 13:00:01 2015 UTC,"A lot of your injuries as a pedestrian, indeed also as a cyclist, occur when you hit the ground in a slow speed collision, not from the initial impact.  The slower the speed, the less relevant the weight of the vehicle.  (You can be hit with a tractor trailer at a few km/h and it is just annoying.)  You are in error, getting hit by an ebike is not qualitatively different that a bicycle, the intial impact is not that much different, and the impact with the ground is identical once you are thrown off your feet. Besides and ebike is more stable and a cyclist is more likely to end up going over the handlebars and landing on top of you furthering your injuries.   You make the mistake of not including the ebike rider or cyclist in your assumption.  An ebike at 125 lb plus 200 lb rider totals 325 lbs.  A bicycle at 20 lbs plus 200 lb rider totals 220 lbs.  You should be comparing 325 lbs vs 220 lbs, a 6:4 ratio not 125 lbs vs 20 lbs a 6:1 ratio."
ontario,3ds35p,orillia3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:12:04 2015 UTC,"(I think you might have missed that the e-bike in OP's picture weighs 209lbs not 125lbs)  I agree most injuries when hit by a bicycle will be due to you hitting the ground. Even though the speed of impact between the cyclist and the pedestrian could be higher than the speed of your head hitting the pavement.   The pavement is the hard immovable object, and all the deceleration when your head hits it has to happen in a matter of millimeters . When the bike hit you,  the tire then the spokes then the front assembly all takes some of the impact,  by that time the bicyclist is probably separated from the bike and you get hit with an arm, a shoulder and head as well.  The acceleration your head feels from the initial impact,  unless you get speared by the bicyclist's helmet, isn't going to be a problem.      But that is also why I say it is qualitatively different from being hit by a 200lb e-bike.  While the impact of your head with the pavement is still going to be the biggest danger,  the 200lb  hard metal and plastic object will be able to give a large wallop all by itself. It isn't as soft as a 200lb human body."

During my commute last year I routinely paced e-bikes going 40km or more on that section, I've seen 60km on the downhill part.   The way e-bike drivers in that bike lane overtake and pass real cyclists is appallingly dangerous.  I've encountered e-bikes on the Martin Goodman Trail multiple times even thought it is a no motorized vehicles trail and seen a couple of close calls.

Cost the equivalent of a few hundred bucks a year. For a lot of people aged 16-20 it was basically a cheaper way of getting on the road. To drive a car on your own you needed a full licence after testing and then you would fall into the loving arms of insurance companies who spotted you were a teenager. Suddenly you were paying $3,000 a year for insurance on a beater worth maybe half that. Gas at well over $2/litre in the UK can hurt too. On my scooter it had a 7 litre tank and that was usually good for a week!  Anything under a certain horsepower is treated differently. I think in the UK it was 14 hp.

Your only point is that they go too fast for your comfort.  I walk faster than most people tend to. Should I get a license and insurance? That will kill the entire e-bike industry. Let's also make them gas powered!  They're allowed to go 32kmh and that seems reasonable. However, I don't think they should be treated as regular bicycles, either allowing them on sidewalks, or forcing regular bicycles off sidewalks and into the traffic that is not at all designed or intended for them. That's an irrational conflation, and can't either be treated as black and whit without a total redesign. I have seen some very green old ladies using the sidewalk to get their first experience with it.

Under the ORPP, 68% of employers will cancel their defined contribution plans.  So I will lose my 5% match and instead get a 1.9% match in the ORPP.  So excluding investment earnings, I will only be getting 101.9% of my paycheque.  That is a net loss of 3.1% of my income per year due to the ORPP.  It is actually going to actively harm me."

ontario,3dsms3,dougly,-5,Sun Jul 19 16:01:03 2015 UTC,"Well, first, they don't routinely waste money, its just something that happens when large governments try new things in attempt to make the lives of their citizens better. When working on such scale, mistakes can lead to great costs, but I'd rather have my government trying new things to make my life better than spend nothing and have stagnating government programs.  And, the reason that Wynne wants to use the CPP managers is BECAUSE they have an excellent track record with pension funds. Setting up a whole new system when one is already in place to do the same thing is wasteful. She is trying to reduce redundancy and waste by using the CPP backbone."

ontario,3dr3l1,SirWilfred,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:38:40 2015 UTC,"1) we have more than 3 parties in this country.  If you're new to the world of politics you should look up the other parties, too.  They may be closer to what you believe than the existing 3.  In particular the green party of canada routinely pulls in millions of votes and is represented the house of commons for part of ontario.    2)  NDP:    pro - unlike the liberals/conservatives don't have a history of blatant corruption, passing laws that infringe our basic rights(the NDP opposed C-51), etc con - will probably actually balance the budget so there's a chance this may involve unpleasant austerity measures like higher taxes on the upper classes, but given you're middle class you have little to worry about.    LIB:   pro - Aren't the conservatives.  Won't oppose sound policy like legalizing marijuana for ideological reasons alone. con - have recently voted in support of legislation that's against your basic human rights (C-51)   CON:    pro - if you live in a con riding they will occasionally invest in politically convenient, short term investments in your riding, and since they don't even really try to balance the budget for the most part they can spend money we don't have on your interests since the liberals/ndp will be forced to pay for it anyway should they ever form government. con - have recently passed legislation that's against your basic human rights (C-51)   Green:    pro - are trying to make the point that a lot of the political problems that canada has right now stem from Stephen Harper's centralization of authority in a single office - the prime ministers office, which 40 years ago wasn't even a single full time job and now has hundreds of government employees and a huge bureaucracy behind it, controlling and micromanaging all sorts of parts of the canadian government with consequences ranging to censorship of our scientists and public servants to a dynamic between the provinces that treats ontario like a second class province relative to the oil producing provinces. another pro - unlike the NDP, LIB & CON - they don't ""whip"" the vote, meaning if you vote a green MP in they will actually stand for your riding rather than the party line in votes in the house of commons.  If you vote for the NDP/LIB/CON you're voting for the party, which may or may not be good for your particular riding, but if you vote for the Greens, assuming they are competent enough to be responsive to local needs they will actually vote in your interests every time.  In the case of the NDP at least one MP has been kicked out lately (Bruce Hyer) for voting for the interests of his local constituents. con    - There's some places that the greens have a chance in and you may not live in one of them.

The employer choose to instead pay you without you actually working during your notice period. This is common. Now maybe you quit in the heat of the moment, and then they told you to get lost. That would be a different situation. This isnt legal advice and I suggest you contact a lawyer asap. It is free of charge for a 30min consultation (https://www.lsuc.on.ca/lsrs/) or you can contact a specific lawyer/group directly (which may not be free for a consultation).  stlawyers.ca has a radio show (am 640) you can call into to ask some simple questions. Or just give them a call.  edit: there are just so many different things that come into play that really any advice given here is almost useless. Only a person who does this for a living would be able to help you. After you have spoken with a lawyer, come back and tell us the progress you made. Also come back and tell us how many people were right, and how many people were wrong. That would be really interesting. Also dont trust the ministry, they arent on your side. Considering how our government runs things, would you really trust them with accurate and comprehensive advice?

When people, especially elderly people, are choosing a healthcare provider, they do discriminate based on race, religion, gender, and general appearance. It's just a fact of life. I for one am more comfortable with a male doctor, who's within 10-15 years of my age, who speaks fluent english. Because I'm able to relate to them more. Not only that, but the Ontario Human Rights Code specifically allows discrimination when choosing a healthcare provider.  If the company had said ""Yeah, we have a large amount of clients specifically requesting a caucasian nurse"", or ""We're in short supply of caucasian nurses and aren't able to accomodate the needs of our clients because of this shortage"", I would have supported the company. But their response doesn't suggest a service-based need for caucasian nurses, so I can only conclude that whoever wrote the ad is racist.

I'm not really sure how the business works, but it seems it's a service that provides elderly people nurses at their own homes.  It's a business that provides specific services to paying customers who may request customization of their services (they are paying for them after all). Their customer(s) are requesting a white nurse, so they require white nurses to employ for the position.

Just remember when the time comes that you find you're not hearing people properly, the first indicator is usually you have a hard time following conversations when there's background noise, go and get your hearing checked and get hearing aids. You really miss out on a lot of life when you don't hear what people say and try to cover it up by smiling and nodding.

ontario,3dklyk,lululiya,2,Mon Jul 20 20:27:39 2015 UTC,"If you're insistent on going to Georgian Bay, then check out Tobermory as well. It's cute, good Huron whitefish tacos, and there's camping as I'm sure you've already planned. As well the Grotto, check out Fathom 5/Flower Pot islands and the Bruce Trail in the park (amazing views). I like to do free-diving in the clear water (if you don't mind the cold). Then take the car-ferry to Manitoulin--Have fun with the gulls! If you really want to see the wilderness beauty of Ontario, you'll have to go north tho. I'm not sure if a week is enough time, but it could be. I'd go up to GB, cross to Manitoulin, then again back onto the mainland west towards the Sault and go up the coast of Lake Superior thru LS Provincial Park to Pukaskwa National Park. That is one of my favourite places in this province. It's camping, obvs. Choose the northern loop for a campsite if you can. Lots of trails and hikes and canoeing and bears. Beautiful place.   (If you do stop in LSPP, camping at Agawa Bay is nice and convenient (and close to the sacred Ojibwe pictographs). But it's also close to the highway so you may hear the big rigs at night. There are other quieter campsites further into the park but they're not as ~scenic.) Or you could stay in Wawa/Michipicoten. Lots of motels. (Plus, there's a little restaurant on Broadway in Wawa that made the best chicken caesar wrap I've ever had. Good pizza too. Dunno if that's still the case, lol. It's been a few years.)  I'd really say go all the way to Thunder Bay and check out Sleeping Giant. But that would be a 2 week trip, I'd say, to fully appreciate it and take your time along the gorgeous drive along northshore Lake Superior. Lots of scenic look outs, rest stops, and parks. And to apprecaite the parks as well. Sleeping Giant campground is nothing that exciting, unless you really like deer & chipmunks lol. It's all the hiking and biking trails that make it worth it. Stunning views. Same with Pukaskwa (plus wonderful canoeing/kayaking!). So you'd really need to give yourselves enough time to do those things.  I've done this trip from Toronto before but I can't remember how long it took. I suspect it was longer than a week but if you're sharing the driving, you could get back from Pukaskwa in 12 hours straight driving. I wouldn't recommend it however (I lived up north for 5+ years and the highways can be hard/dangerous at dusk/night, mostly cos of wildlife, and especially for those of us who are used to urban/southern Ontario driving).  If you don't want to go as far as Lake Superior PP or Pukaskwa, you can still go to Manitoulin and then once you leave the island, go east instead of west to Killarney Prov Park. It's wonderful too. And then you can just head back down to Toronto. It's only a 5 hour drive home from there. And, I mean, if you want to go to Algonquin, it's only like 3.5-4 hours from Killarney.  Sauble Beach is completely overrated. Don't waste your time. You'll spend more time looking for a parking space than actually at the beach. You'd be much better off going to Singing Sands and exploring closer to Tobermory. There are also other great smaller towns/provincial parks with nicer beaches along the 21 North from Goderich. I wouldn't bother going to Grand Bend or Wasaga either. See: Sauble Beach. (aka. Waste of time unless you're looking for expensive tourist-trappy chain-store covered and crowded beaches full of idiots and children. Wasaga is the worst of the worst tho. But I generally have issues with GB beaches around that area anyway. If you're heading that way, you'd be much better off going to Awenda and canoeing/kayaking to Giants Tomb on a calm day (be careful) or something, or hitting up Beausoleil Island/GB Islands National Park.) But... It all depends on what part of the province you're looking to see and what your interests are. If you're not super-nature/camping people, my suggestions may be of no interest to you. I would suggest the Toronto - Tobermory - Manitoulin - Sault Ste Marie - Lake Superior trip. You see a lot of beautiful parts of the Great Lakes and there are loads of places to camp along the way.  Sorry about the long reply. I just love Ontario roadtrips (especially when the great lakes or Prov Parks are involved) and used to take them every year. It's sadly been a few years since I've been on one... I miss it so much.  Basically when planning a roadtrip, think about the sorts of things you would like to see and what your interests are. If you're into natural beauty, hiking, wildlife, and scenery, then look at prov parks and such, especially coastal drives --the more remote (aka further north) the better. Even inland parks on lakes/rivers can be beautiful (Temagami springs to mind). If you're more into comfort, food, wine, or touristy things, check out the popular beaches and lakeside towns in the southwest. If you're into typical ""cottage country"" stuff like fishing, water-skiing, boating, or whatever, it's Muskoka/Parry Sound. If you're into adventure sports/pony-trekking/rafting, again, you'll look at prov parks and/or towns with those sort of attractions. You also have to decide how important things like electricity and cell phone reception are to you. The further north you go, and the less populated the parks/towns, the more ""rustic"" the camping can get. And if you go north of GB, do pay attention to the ""No gas for 90km"" type of signs. They mean it! Many of these sorts of areas are (were) cell-phone dead zones as well.  Just have a rough idea of the main things/places you want to see, plan for those and then just go with the flow. If you plan for every step of the way, it'll seem too rigid and stressful, getting from one point to the next in a certain time. And since you're willing to sleep in your car if need be, I don't see any problems with this approach. Roadtrips are all about stops, distractions, and detours. :)"

ontario,3dfgsr,You_Have_Nice_Hair,5,Wed Jul 15 23:53:51 2015 UTC,"Well that makes sense as people in the cities have more access to and typically more desire to drink other better beer. So lowering the prices might help pull in some customers.   In rural Ontario crappy mega brews rule supreme, so they can probably get away with a price increase, especially if other options are not available.

ontario,3dfgsr,spyd4r,-3,Thu Jul 16 00:13:19 2015 UTC,"They are correct. And it wouldnt be the brewers fault either. It would be the governments. The way it works now with the pricing structure for all the different brewers is a set price. You remove the economic advantages of having a consolidated distribution system, you add that cost onto what the brewers charge. And that price is not added by the brewers but by the retailers to offset the costs they would incur. Currently the beerstore operates at a zero gain that only covers those costs. This is advantageous to all since it reduces the cost of the product which in turn increases volume (more volume = more profit). The government would still demand the existing tax revenue (actually it is demanding more so expect higher prices either way) from any new system. Unfortunately, with decreased volume, the government has to increase the tax to compensate (much like how property tax is calculated).  But you say let the LCBO sell 24s? Great idea, except in that case the government needs to accept all the additional costs of distribution to: A) make the profit off the booze B) make the tax revenue. The governments system has higher costs. Just the lcbo itself has much higher overhead compared to the beerstore (which is basically a warehouse with a little dressing). In the end the government would loose money. Solution for the government? Increase the price to offset the loss associated with taking over the beerstore operations.  More craft beer!!! great idea, except one minor issue... Craft beer is taxed at 1/3 (partial taxes are paid per litre) less than the big boys. No wonder the government loves the big boys compared to craft brewers. So in order to allow more craft brewers, the government has to accept a loss in revenue. Well no fucking way the government is accepting less money. Especially the province of ontario which is in the debt shithole. Solution... increase taxes or charge things such as licensing fees. Wait, didnt the government announce grocery stores would need to now pay licensing fees? Who do you think will ultimately pay for that? The consumer when the products price increases to offset the retailers additional costs.  Many people fail to see its not the brewers that want a monopoly. They only want an efficient distribution system that keeps prices low. If prices are low, volume is increased and thus they can spread their costs (scale) and make more profit on their end. The brewers would love to reduce the prices, but the government has actually made it so prices cant go lower. Such as minimum prices for beer (to stop over consumption, turning poor people into drunks). The spin isnt coming from the beerstore, its coming from someone else who has a shit load more to lose, and we elected them."
ontario,3dfgsr,phillybrownpants,4,Thu Jul 16 05:18:26 2015 UTC,"The problem for a lot of us isn't the price, it's the selection and most importantly, convenience of purchasing. I guess I don't drink enough beer to care if the price goes up and neither do most of the people I know.  A great example of the stupid is Trinity Bellwoods beer. They want to open a second location (2 blocks from my house!) and also brew beer there. They've been told, according to the existing rules, if they want to sell their beers at one location that's made in the other location, they have to distribute it via the Beer Store and purchase it just like any other bar. This is the kind of shit that needs to go."
ontario,3dfgsr,tracer_ca,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:35:29 2015 UTC,"Well, as I said before,much of the rules are surrounded not by the interest of the beerstore but by the government.

ontario,3dbcnj,TweetPoster,19,Tue Jul 14 23:17:54 2015 UTC,I think going 140 is a bit extreme...
ontario,3dbcnj,turdovski,-8,Wed Jul 15 00:10:41 2015 UTC,You've never driven on the 401 between Dixie and Kennedy in Toronto (during the 20 minutes there isn't rushour). I get honked at constantly for going too slow at 125
ontario,3dbcnj,beartheminus,13,Wed Jul 15 01:17:53 2015 UTC,You probably got honked at because you're a left lane Larry.  Just chilling in the fast lane while people want to pass.
ontario,3dbcnj,ActionAxson,-1,Wed Jul 15 04:38:31 2015 UTC,"Im not actually unless for a brief moment of passing a truck in the centre lane etc, but does this mean you think people should be allowed to go 140 in the left lane?"
ontario,3dbcnj,beartheminus,4,Wed Jul 15 05:32:30 2015 UTC,I definitely think the speed limits need to be raised now that cars are so decked out in safety equipment. 140 might be a little too fast.   I just commented on the fact you got honked at. I feel like people only really get honked at when they're seriously obstructing traffic.
ontario,3dbcnj,ActionAxson,-2,Wed Jul 15 05:53:54 2015 UTC,"I was using hyperbole yes, I only got honked at once. But the amount of people passing me while I go 125 is staggering.   I also agree speed limit raise is in order. Not only that but a couple studies pointed out that speeding is not a significant factor in causing accidents, it just makes accidents worse. The contributor is distracted driving.  Raise the speed limit and crack down heavily on distracted driving."
ontario,3dbcnj,beartheminus,7,Wed Jul 15 06:05:47 2015 UTC,"That's really specific for an example of why 140 isn't, in fact, extreme. It's clearly not where this guy was pulled over. I've spent quite a bit of time on the 401, and I don't think I've ever been honked at for going too slowly at 125. If there's no traffic, the occasional speeder will simply go around. Maybe if you're being pokey in the fast lane you'll get the lights flashed, etc, but that's about it. 140 is a bit extreme."
ontario,3dbcnj,beartheminus,5,Wed Jul 15 06:13:04 2015 UTC,Oh I'm not defending it you have me all wrong. I'm just letting people know that 140 is the new 120 on the Toronto 401. I personally think we should make the 401 unrestricted like the autobahn in the express lanes only  but until then I'll go 120 outside of Toronto and 125 in the Toronto area so I'm not such an obstruction. That in itself is dangerous. Keep with the speed of traffic.
ontario,3dbcnj,Waffleman205,0,Wed Jul 15 04:43:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. 125 is the rule.  I actually remember an occasion, years and years ago, where two guys got pulled over for doing 125 (in a whole stream of cars doing the same), and they argued in court that they would be obstructing traffic to drive any slower. They were found guilty anyway, so they staged a bit of a protest by driving side-by-side down the 401 going exactly 100. They cause a massive traffic jam and were charged with obstructing traffic. They argued that that was stupid, because they were going the speed limit, and lost again."

The sooner you get one and registered as ""a driver"" on a car the quicker your rates will go down.   As a new [g2] driver on a new car you can expect to pay ~200-250/mo in insurance.  It drops quickly once you get your g after a few years.  The sooner you get it the sooner you pay less insurance."

As you get smaller and smaller, and then to residential, it becomes much more expensive per MW to service, and the demand fluctuates based on time/day, so you need a much higher installed generating capacity that is unused a large part of the time.   I'm not saying the small guy should get the shaft, but it's something to keep in mind. The Kidd Creek metallurgical plant in Timmins used to be the single largest user of hydro in the province, until Xstrata shut it down and started shipping the ore to Quebec for processing due to the cost of electricity in Ontario.  http://www.timminstimes.com/2009/12/07/xstrata-hinted-at-met-site-closure-two-years-ago"

It's just corporate code speak and what they really mean is ""we will be moving all operations unless we get a massive government handout"".  Even then, the biggest cost of manufacturing isn't electricity.  It's labour, materials and equipment.   I'm no economist, so I don't know if there is a long-term solution to this, but something needs to change.  With all of the free trade agreements, tarriffs are off the table, which will get even worse after we get the TPP rammed up our asses.

Sucks for Windsor but they need to stop putting every single egg in that basket over and over and over again and diversify into something else using the same market skillsets.  The problem for many years was that working at an automotive plant was incredible money for little to no education. Lots of people aspired to take these jobs because ""X,Y,Z was a plant manager and would get me in"".  I remember a girl I used to go to college with getting paid $22/hr to pump gas into cars. She sat on a stool, read and pumped gas for a few nights a week. My dad's friend ran a side business creating woodworking while getting paid 80K a year to sit ""unemployed"" for over 5 years.

Hell, we were still paying a ""Debt Retirement Fee"" for a debt that was already paid off until recently (http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/tax/drc/).  I don't blame the private owners, their responsibilities are to the shareholders.     I blame anyone (both the PC's and Liberals) for selling out everyone in the province over the past 25 years to make themselves look better to get re-elected and pretend to balance a budget.  Now that the privatization ship has sailed it will take a leader with a lot of guts to ever try to take it over again.   Having no plan for what to do with excess capacity except PAY SOMEONE ELSE to take the electricity we generate because we have no agreements with neighbouring grids or any way to temporarily store it is another big one.    Going in too fast with wind when we should have a more diversified approach that includes nuclear to get us away from fossil fuels.

Sure everyone touts the efficiencies of the private sector, but when was the last time a company passed cost savings into the customer? Hint: almost never   I feel like this is something people don't understand about capitalism. Capitalism can do some great things in a competitive environment, but the government needs to ensure that corporations are never permitted to hold a monopoly, because that's the opposite of competition. Capitalism does not function properly without an environment in which competition can not exist.  In this case and others (internet infrastructure is one we're failing at big time) we're looking at a ""natural"" monopoly. This is a monopoly that's not caused by a company taking advantage of market forces, but instead is a monopoly imposed by the physical laws of the universe. That is, we would love to have dozens of power companies competing with each other, but it's not practical to have every power company run power lines to every house. There's simply not enough physical space to do that. So we need the government to operate this shared infrastructure. We can privatize the billing and customer service, and generation can be privatized (except in unique cases like Niagara Falls), but maintaining the actual grid? That needs to be socialized."

That contradicts the headline in the article and confirms the exact point I'm trying to make:   ""Will prices go up? Of course they will. The only reason someone buys an asset is to make money on it,"" Opposition Leader Luke Foley said at Labor's campaign launch on March 1.   When utilities are government owned, there is only an obligation to break even. When it is private, a profit margin is required to satisfy shareholders.  If the utility is run well (which I agree, hasn't always been the case) the only way to extract profits is to either a) raise prices or b) cut costs - i.e. jobs.  Neither of which is good for the overall economy of the province.  How about a little more local history instead of from half way around the world.  (Source: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/wynnes-quest-for-full-valuethe-long-road-to-privatization/article23461789/)   The most obvious forerunner for what Mr. Clark and Ms. Wynne are contemplating was the privatization of Halifax-based Nova Scotia Power Corp., the province’s electric generation, transmission and distribution giant.  In 1992, Nova Scotia premier Donald Cameron wanted to improve the province’s credit profile by moving the utility and its $2.4-billion in debt off the balance sheet. The original plan was to sell more than half the company in an IPO so it could fund itself on the market. Nova Scotia eventually sold the entire utility in a share offering worth more than $800-million and the company’s named changed to Emera Inc. in 2000.  Two decades later, Emera has been successful in many ways. The company is financially solid and has expanded into the United States and the Caribbean. Still, Nova Scotians pay among the highest prices in the country for power.  “I think that experience is something of a mixed bag,” energy consultant Tom Adams said. “Although Nova Scotians pay high energy prices, Emera and Nova Scotia Power are good corporate taxpayers.”   Or:   In contrast, the electricity business in Alberta has been the wheelhouse of private companies and even foreign investors. Last year, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the power and utility arm of Warren Buffett’s conglomerate, bought AltaLink, the province’s largest electrical transmission company.   Do we really want foreign interests owning our electrical grid?"

Workers are much more efficient as well but instead of sharing some of that with their employees, businesses lay off more people and pat themselves on the back and pay out dividends and bonuses and watch their stock options appreciate.

FIT isn't a bad idea, it is just that the rates were too high. They didn't think of the long term. Exporting power just because allowing it on our grid would damage it, isn't that great of an idea either, we should be storing that energy.

ontario,3d54ue,patadrag,3,Mon Jul 13 22:39:41 2015 UTC,"It is very clear why we shouldn't: it's just bad coaching and bad team management.

The Blackhawk carbon offence is way too fast and before you know it, you're down 10 nothing.   I think he also meant to say that the main problem is that windmills are always caught flat footed. You can just skate around them."
ontario,3d54ue,fishingiswater,-3,Tue Jul 14 18:13:10 2015 UTC,"This is particularly what Corcoran wanted to talk about. Was it true, he asked me, that windmills and solar panels were what had reduced Ontario’s annual electric power CO2 emissions from around 40 million metric tons in 2000 to 10 million in 2013?  Of course that is not true, I told him: just look at the public record of power generation in Ontario (click here to see annual tables going back to 2010) and you can see that it was the massive addition of nuclear power to our system that chopped all that CO2. Wind, as you can see, played as much a role as a peashooter in a modern war."

ontario,3cy214,chretienhandshake,18,Sat Jul 11 23:44:25 2015 UTC,"I think people confuse Mountains as being THE definition of natural beauty.  Mountains are impressive, but they're not all the world has to offer.  Don't know the origins of ""Onterrible"", but I know people think B.C, and Alberta are the most beautiful provinces simply because of the mountains.  In my opinions, Newfoundland and Quebec have the most beautiful natural beauty. There are no mountains like the ones in Quebec and Newfoundland on the West Coast, the mountains on the East are ancient, and Ontario itself is partially made up of the oldest mountain range on earth(though it's been completely worn down the Canadian shield is the oldest rock on Earth and used to be a Mountain range).  I don't like how the Rockies are used as the standard definition of Canadian beauty, I love them, but the rock bed lakes and windswept pines of Ontario are in a league of their own too. The Mountains of Monteregie in Quebec and the Gaspe area are in a league of their own, as are the rockies.  Even the plains of the prairies are there own definition of beautiful, where else in Canada do you get some much sky?  Canada is awesome, and Ontario is too, it is unique in the world with it's land formations, stuff like the rockies can be found around the world, but the Canadian shield( I think Russia has some), and the Great lakes combined truly are a very unique thing in the world, Ontario, Michigan and Minnesota really aren't replicable anywhere else on Earth. NO where else are there so many Fresh Water lakes, in the world, no where else is there as ancient rock, and you really do not find rock bed lakes as often around the world as you do in Ontario. Rock lakes need to be experienced,pictures don't do them justice, it's like another planet, just mini lakes everywhere with nothing but steep smoothed out boulder shores."

I could totally get how someone would get the vibe if they just drove from ottawa to Montreal, nothing but urban sprawl. Some of Montreal's suburbs are beautiful though, Vaudreil-Dorion, Ile Perot(Is Vaudreil on there), even the island of Montreal itself has some awesome scenery especial on the mount.   All of Canada is awesome, the whole planet has natural beauty everywhere. Quebec and the East Coast in my opinion has the most natural beauty and human made beauty; the towns, Quebec City is awesome, Lunenburg Nova Scotia is just so unique, even St.Johns Newfoundland is actually a pretty little city.  Montreal, and Toronto are just too large, and have too many building that people just don't think to look hard enough for whats pretty. Toronto's Don Valley is actually pretty awesome, and the Scarborough Bluffs are awesome too; and they're in Scarborough the most disliked borough in Toronto."

It has nothing to do with the scenery.  Even though 9 times out of 10 it's meant in jest, these kind of slurs allow bigots and assholes to hide behind (a poor attempt) at humor.

I think it has to do with a certain attitude of people from Ontario. We group all Ontarians as being from Toronto, and everyone knows people from Toronto think they are at the centre of the universe. Probably has to do with how dense the population is in Ontario and the need to be more forceful to get around which comes across as being rude."

We should not have to worry that the messages we get from friends are actually from government spooks.  Not in Canada.  That is definitely not what this country is about. The Trans Pacific Partnership - putting copyright above our right to use the internet is madness in the world of 2015+.  Everything around us is becoming close to being connected to the rest of the world via the internet, from our cars to our clothing -- being forbidden from being able to use these things is just unconscionable, and as a musician it creates an absolutely toxic environment when dealing with potential fans. The Trade in Services Agreement - making it not legal for the government of canada/provinces/etc to require that software and hardware that runs such things as voting machines and critical infrastructure be publicly verifiable/open source.  We will be legally required to purchase from black-box vendors who may or may not have an interest in, say, rigging an election, or having backdoors to shut down critical infrastructure for foreign powers. The structure of the federal government has amassed way too much deference to the PMO.  Power needs to be delegated at the very least to the ministers who can be held responsible to the public.  Elizabeth May's Green Party is the only party willing to do this, unfortunately. From the very day of the apology to first nations groups (quickly followed by a racist slur within the house of commons by a conservative MP) to the change in rules allowing the federal government to disband first nations bands under dubious reasons, there has been a continual struggle against the interests of first nations people in canada.  We have a long way to go to undo the damage that first nations communities has faced at the hands of the government but the Harper Government has in particular been a source of a chain of injustices in and of itself.  Cleaning up the Indian Act so that first nations people on reserve are not treated so much as wards of the state would be a good start."

I couldn't see my family doctor anymore after she instituted onerous late/missed-appointment charges.  I was never late/absent, but they were so expensive that I couldn't afford even the possibility of being on the hook for them (e.g. imagine the TTC being late and costing you hundreds).  Now, because of those fees, I don't have a doctor."
ontario,3cv1ob,cat6_racer,2,Sat Jul 11 02:59:23 2015 UTC,Did you ever consider talking to your doctor about your concerns instead of walking away?  Clearly there have been issues or they wouldn't charge a fee but if you're not part of the problem they should be willing to work with you.    A friend is a physio and she had to start charging no show fees because the problem was getting so bad it was impacting her income.  As well there are only so many hours in a day and she hates wasting time when she could be treating patients.  GPs are finding the same thing.  If someone bails on their appointment not only does the doctor not get paid but they can't see another patient who needs an appointment because the no show didn't give them the option to pass that spot onto someone else.
ontario,3cv1ob,NOMDUPLUME,2,Sat Jul 11 15:11:01 2015 UTC,"I mailed a hardcopy letter to my doctor at the time and it didn't change anything, so yeah I tried ""talking to [my] doctor about [my] concerns"".  The only option many people have now is to go wait in a walk-in clinic or emerg. for 12 hours (or however long it takes before whatever you have is considered important enough for them to bother with).  Healthcare in Ontario is in trouble but nobody gives a damn."
ontario,3cv1ob,cat6_racer,2,Sat Jul 11 15:17:33 2015 UTC,"That is a shame. Unfortunately sometimes the dollars come before the patients. My doctor has a no-show fee policy but he only enforces it for habitual appointment skippers.    The system is definitely overloaded, there's no doubt about this. I think that was the point that OP was trying to make, that we shouldn't blow off appointments without a damn good reason when wait times for some procedures are nightmarishly long.  We all pay for it in the end."
ontario,3cv1ob,NOMDUPLUME,3,Sun Jul 12 01:18:58 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think it's a good idea overall.  In some cases yes, but overall no.  I've had a few health problems that led me to specialists with 6-12+ mo waiting lists.  Some of these people would contact me when my appointment was made then never again.  Yeah, I made it to my appointment 6 months after a memo was sent to me.  But charging people who forgot an appointment after that amount  of time seems just mean to me.  The confusion and 'thank god' I'm in the right place feeling that was there during those appointments was sincere.  And putting my parents in my place, well, I would never expect them to end up in the right spot at the right time without more assistance.  Unless there is a standardized method of contacting people and ensuring they know when their appointment is scheduled, a fee based enforcement will only harm the wrong people."
ontario,3cv1ob,KingradKong,2,Sat Jul 11 04:16:52 2015 UTC,If we didn't live in an era of smartphones and computers with calendar reminders I might agree with you but that's not the case.  Also most specialists will give you a reminder call if you ask for  it.  People in their 70s might not be on track with this but the rest of us are.
ontario,3cv1ob,KingradKong,0,Sat Jul 11 10:24:04 2015 UTC,"That is totally fair for a good portion of the population.  Except my parents don't even have cell phones let alone smart phones and they aren't near their 70's yet.  As for asking specialists, the times I've been to specialists with huge wait times, I get a letter in the mail months and months in advance and don't have the opportunity to ask them to call me until I've already visited my first time."

Proof of SSN includes proof not having an SSN, in which case you get a letter from the Social Security Administration stating you were never issued a SSN. Assuming you're a non-resident alien who is living in Florida that is doable. In which case you can then use your Canadian ID along with your two pieces of proof of address.  After you have all that documentation you'll need to take a course and then take a written test to get your Florida learners permit if you're under 18. It's then a one year wait before you take the in car test for your full Florida drivers license. If you're over 18 you don't need to wait for a year but still need to take the test. So you'll need a car in Florida either way.  After you pass the in car test you get your full Florida drivers license and can exchange it for your G2 in Ontario.

Since you're not an American you can't just choose to be resident there, you need a work permit or visa.  Edit: Just in case I didn't make myself totally clear you need Florida to be your primary place of residence. If you're a Canadian citizen you'll need to get a visa of some sort to live there (being a snowbird who lives there part of the year doesn't count). You're too old to get a visa with your parents (assuming one of them lives there), so you'll need to marry someone with a visa to work there most likely. Alternatively, if you can get a visa or work permit for the US it's even better. If you're an engineer/doctor/lawyer or other professional covered under TN status then that is relatively easy. If not it will be way harder.

ontario,3cseoc,toxiccandles,7,Fri Jul 10 12:01:05 2015 UTC,The thing that I have never heard explained is how do you ensure that that you have 0% - absolutely no alcohol - in your blood. If you had a drink 8 hours ago would there not still be a trace amount in your blood? What if you use mouth wash? If you use rubbing alcohol can you be sure that none is absorbed into you blood stream? Trace amounts of alcohol are common enough and 0% is perhaps an impossible standard.
ontario,3cseoc,nerox3,7,Fri Jul 10 18:27:24 2015 UTC,"And then there is the possible calibration issues with the testing equipment.  0% is a silly standard,  they should have specified less than 0.01% if in practical terms they don't expect the testing equipment to be accurate to more than 2 decimal places."
ontario,3cseoc,cbbrowne,3,Fri Jul 10 18:59:56 2015 UTC,"There is actually a (rare) medical condition where alcohol ferments in the gut.  If someone suffers to the extent that they've got a perpetually significantly high level of alcohol as consequence, that could well be cause to need to disqualify them from driving.  But suffering from it to a more moderate degree means that the person CAN'T blow 0%, and it's probably not a just result to deem them to have broken the law.  (Particularly if they had consumed NO drinks!!!)  Laws that are so, um, ""ungraduated"" in their seeming application don't seem quite right.  And it's risky to set such laws; if someone establishes that it was an improper rule, that could get the law invalidated altogether, which isn't what anyone (aside from those that WANT to drive over people drunk) wants."

If that process, and any appeals ends in the officer's favour, that means the officer deserves to return to work because they did not do anything wrong and not getting paid during that time is a hardship upon them which is undeserved.  Do we give that officer three years back-pay? Not to mention what they should do in the interim to support themselves - get a part time job in retail?  The question is not why do officers get to be suspended with pay, but instead why did this appeal of the police board hearing that fired the officer take 2 years to to work its way through that process?  Changing the law to suspend without pay will only result in unnecessary and undeserved hardship as well as undermining the idea of presumption of innocence. Better to reform the process."

It's a really good location, and close to everything, has all the amenities you want, it just seems like one of the most sterile places I've been too, super clean, super boring.  I've never heard any complaints about Viva, the best town in the GTA with a good bus system in Brampton in my opinion, it's about double the size of Richmond hill in population and size, so they have to have superior transit. Brampton is a lot sketchier though.  You don't hear about a lot of news or stuff going on in Richmond Hill, good or bad. Everyone I know likes it, and think it's a nice place to live though, I dated someone from there for about 3 years so I do know the area pretty well, and my grandma lives there. It just is super boring, neighbourhoods don't seem to get together like other small towns in Ontario, I never saw road hockey being played once.   There is just something about that town that I really really don't like, it's just got the blandest vibe you can think of.  Also a bonus for the bus system is you have the TTC that comes to the south side as well, so you have access to Toronto Transit pretty easy, my exes sister took the bus to work and to school(she went to York University) and she didn't really ever have a problem, or I can't remember her ever complaining about it or calling for a ride, I think it's decently reliable.  Like all major city areas, you are going to have decent transit systems, but delays are common obviously, you'll never have to worry about it never showing up though, the area is densely populated enough that bus routes are pretty regular.  In my town we have about 10 stops a day from Go Transit, and that's it, but I know in Richmond Hill you get a bus coming by every 20 minutes or so at the most."

Also check for parking lot cameras, there may be some if there's a nearby business.  I highly recommend reading fault determination rules in full, even in cases where you're moving in a parking lot; it's not 50/50.  http://assets.ibc.ca/Documents/Brochures/Ontario-Auto-Insurance-FAQ-ON.pdf  What can I do if I disagree with my insurance company’s assessment of fault?    If you do not agree with your insurance company’s decision and believe the decision does not accurately reflect the circumstances of the collision, speak to the claims adjuster handling your file. Ask which Fault Determination Rule was applied in your case. Bring any new information to your insurance company. Generally, an insurance company will revise or reconsider its decision on fault only if additional relevant information is provided. For example, if a collision occurred in which each driver stated the other had gone through a red light, an insurance company would have little choice but to assign 50/50 fault. However, if an eyewitness confirmed which driver went through the red light, an insurance company could review its decision. If your insurance company refuses to revise its decision and you still disagree, contact your company’s complaint officer. He or she will guide you through the company’s complaint handling procedures.   https://www.fsco.gov.on.ca/en/auto/brochures/Pages/brochure_claims.aspx#benefit  For more information on FSCO's dispute resolution services, visit our website at: www.fsco.gov.on.ca, or write to:  The Dispute Resolution Services Branch  Financial Services Commission of Ontario  Box 85 , 15th Floor  Toronto ON M2N 6L9"

And ya, I know not to drive without coverage this was a financial reason why I lost it ...my record is perfect otherwise, not even a speeding ticket...I don't ever has issues like this...shitty luck this time...  Will I be hit with a record now? Or is the report more for record keeping purposes just in case something happens down the road?..it makes sense to me for the insurance company to request it to determine fault, but since there was no occupancy in the truck, it was parked, and I've been otherwise forward, will the police consider it just a logistic matter?"

I would go with them when they drop the vehicle off to be repaired and let the shop manager know that you're paying for the repairs... you don't want to give someone cash that could ""disappear"".

You do not need to make an insurance claim if a police report is made--as in, there is no obligation to utilize an insurance company to repair your vehicle if you don't with to make a claim with them. Obviously that is up to the individual owner. Reading on, you already paid them? Hope you got a signed receipt for that. They can't make a claim. If you do happen to get a call from their insurance company, ask if they made a claim, if so, tell them you paid out of pocket for the repair to their vehicle.   How many days ago did the insurance company send you the dear john letter?  Don't know if there is a grace period between getting insurance companies.

It's not complicated at my low end of the economy, and the result has been that we raise prices.  If we didn't, we would eventually simply go belly up.  If energy costs were lower, or at least steady, we could firm up pricing and even begin to look at expansion. And that would mean jobs.  Since there seems to be no end to rising energy prices, we certainly can only continue to the point where the sheer unpredictability of it all forces us either out of business or we relocate to province that has lower and steadier energy prices."

Big machines, vendors around the world, employees, the whole bit. Energy costs aren't trivial overheads, but unless you're a raw materials processor, energy costs are such a small number on your budgets that it's disingenuous at best to say that they have any effect on our business growth. The state of the dollar has a FAR greater impact, for one.   Buddy with the meat processing plant is complaining about $5k/year (edit: per employee) to run the machines that each of his workers use to process his product in North Bay. Well I'd like to see what his likely-trivial rent is. And how big his massive shipping bills are to get product around this ginormous province. You can't look at one number like that and hope to get any sense of its significance. How many hours per day does the plant operate?  Ontario is THE BEST province in which to operate a manufacturing operation. We have access to WORLD CLASS talent, WORLD CLASS processors and suppliers, we are a hub for trade with the USA.

Some survey says people think energy is too expensive? I agree, they probably do think that because conservative asshats have been beating it into our skulls for the last several years. If we get into an evidence-based approach by looking at the books, energy is not that important to competitiveness unless you're smelting iron. If you disagree, give me some numbers. My numbers say it's not a big deal.  I do know how much we spend every month in electricity and gas compared out our revenue and profit. And from my perspective, it's pretty tiny, and some marginal reduction like 20% wouldn't be easing any useful pressure for me. It certainly won't make me more competitive - especially in the face of CAD swings such as they are.  Personally, I'd rather that I and my family and my friends can go outside in the summer and still be able to breath. And that future generations will have a well-kept environment that provides for them as it has for us. If you want to shoot for the bottom, I suppose that's your business.  Also, if you can't find good suppliers in Ontario, then I don't know what's going on. Sure, not everyone's up to par but tell me where in the world that isn't the case? You think the Germans blow gold pixy dust from their asses? That's not been my experience working with the Germans - they're rigid, risk and innovation resistant, slow and too deliberate, etc. You think Americans make the cheapest 1st world goods? Not been my experience either as we always send out multiple RFQs because they're all over the map and their quality isn't guaranteed to be any good.

You're right in that every model is different. I just can't imagine running a business on a model where energy prices cut that deep into your margins. To say that if we had a 25% drop in energy prices and you'd be wildly profitable - you must be on the brink then?  As far as world class... Our experience has been that we have several worthwhile competitors for the vast majority of our outsources parts and processes (raw materials like steel, aluminum, and engineering plastics, processes like heat treat and other metallurgical adjustments, injection molding, part suppliers like fasteners and seals) all within 1hr of our facility. And these guys are capable of quality and fast turnarounds, reasonable prices, etc.  Additionally, when we work with American or overseas vendors and customers, GTA is obviously a hub which makes shipping much easier.  I say world class because I know of a lot of areas in Canada and the USA that certainly cannot say this. Imagine shipping a factory run of aluminum extrusions across the province or from another province or state. I don't think you can make an argument that there's a better place in Canada than the golden horseshoe for manufacturing, and the same goes for much of the USA."

Except that if you're doing stupid things like weaving in and out of traffic or passing on the right, there's no leniency. You drive fast in a straight line and then slow down if needed for as long as needed if there's traffc in front of you, or you pass safely; it amazes me how many people in this province seem to have no conception of patience in moderate traffic. We could certainly learn something from that; it's not like we have a shortage of police (in general, province wide)."

Also about two years ago I was in the passenger seat and someone did a really FUCKING stupid pass and we were a foot or two away from a head on crash or rolling into the ditch- pretty much a true near death experience at 21.   Ever since then I'm not the same on that road. Or any tbh.   Doesn't help that my dad taught me how to drive and he's a paramedic, so lots of ""this one time"" stories."

That was a Sudbury-Ottawa round trip and, on the way back, I stuck to 100-105 and found that I did the same time as on the way out. I think it was mainly a combination of not getting stopped and not hitting traffic, but it was a good enough argument to get me to slow down on the roads and I've been pretty good since then."

But again, my Dad would remind me you don't save any real time between ~120 v. 110/100, but you're a heck of a lot more likely to get pulled over and the cost in the insurance hit will say with you for years v. the 5 mins you might save over a 6 hour drive.   And the reduction in reaction time that 10 km/h represents matters a lot more when critical distances are measured in feet; esp. on an undivided highway where you're putting so much faith in the opposing traffic to stay in their lane.  ^ this is what I truly took away from that moment that is still, two + years later, burned into my mind as a still image."

You mean the speed limit that was set about 40 years ago and hasn't changed since, despite the fact that we drive far better vehicles?  On the 400-series highways, the speed limit used to be 70mph/112kmh. You know why they lowered it? Because of the oil crisis in the early 70s. They lowered it to 60mph/98kmh. Not for safety, but to save gas. Then with metrication, they rounded it off to 100.  There's no reason we should be driving 20xx vehicles on 20xx highways with 1970s speed limits.  No doubt you'll counter with ""some people drive classic cars/sometimes the weather is bad/some roads are worse"", but those are all special cases that are answered by saying simply ""yeah, so those drivers in those conditions should slow down, and I bet they already do because common sense tells them where their safe limit is.""

Speed itself is not a cause for accidents/blah blah (that would be irresonsible driving, before some idiot chimes in and says all speeds above the posted speed limit will somehow immediately cause you to crash and kill a bus full of orphans) , it's the differences in speed between vehicles. A car travelling 100km/h on the highway is just as hazardous as a car travelling 180km/h, where the majority of the vehicles are travelling at 120-130 km/h."

Won't we please think of the children!   Is the guy doing 110 wrong, or is the 130?    Right now, legally, both of them are. If everyone except one guy is going 130, then the 110 guy is more wrong, because he's being a roadblock and a hazard to the rest of the motorists around him. If almost everyone is going 110, and one guy is going 130, it's not really a problem as long as people are using lanes properly and not sitting in the left.   yet the law, instruction and enforcement all say something else.   But, why do they say something else? The 100 km/h limit is because of an oil crisis 40 years ago, not because of any ideas of safety. So why the hell are we holding onto it so tightly?

Mortgage insurance (or CMHC insurance), from what I understand of it, is not related to the other three types of insurance. When purchasing a house and your down payment is <20% of the purchase price of the house you need to insure your mortgage with the CMHC. It's an additional cost to you and doesn't protect you in any fashion. Rather, it protects the lender in the event that the borrower can't make their payments. Even if you make a >20% down payment, it may still be in your best interest to purchase the insurance as it typically results in lower interest rates and admin fees.   Creditor insurance may cover your entire mortgage amount in the event of death, but if you're disabled and can't work the insurance will only cover the minimum payment of the insured debt - it won't fully pay off your loan."

ontario,3cf7x5,JiuJitsuPatricia,3,Tue Jul 7 14:05:40 2015 UTC,"They have to stand outside with the radar or LIDAR gun because they need to target specific cars to check their speed.  The car mounted radar doesn't work well in higher traffic environments because it can't isolate which car is tripping it.  Also, in this case, you're in the clear, but you can't always assume that once you pass a radar trap that you're in the clear.  In some cases they are simply clocking your speed and then calling your description ahead for an interceptor down the road to stop you.  But you will never get a speeding ticket in the mail.  Only the operator of the vehicle can be charged and they have to be in control when they are stopped.  It's not a charge that can be laid after the fact."

I'm fairly certain that the landlord has an obligation to cover all fees that the fire causes to tenants whom are not responsible for the fire.   But if the landlord has insurance on the rental property, then that would more than likely cover any loss of rental income resulting from the fire, as well as cover any costs to ensure the tenants needs are met.  If the landlord does not have insurance, you can apply to the LT board for help, but you might want to pursue the matter with a lawyer to ensure that you are compensated for all of your losses.  The landlord has to put you up in a comparable situation.  But seriously, talk to a lawyer."
ontario,3c9oor,Mirm83,6,Mon Jul 6 06:20:17 2015 UTC,"Talk to a paralegal. Lawyers don't do LTB.  As a paralegal, it sounds like them lease has been frustrated. The Board will likely make an order terminating the tenancy as of June 18th, thus requiring the return of the rent deposit.  Finally, tenants are responsible for carrying their own liability insurance. The landlord has no duty to compensate for losses caused by other tenants. The best bet to recover these losses is to sue the people who caused the fire in small claims court, possibly the landlord as well, for negligence.

The way I'm reading this is that your friends have decided to go to another place because the alternatives the LL offered aren't adequate.  The situation is further complicated by the fire which is the cause for the move.  Normally the LL holds the last months rent as a sort of deposit but in this case because of the fire the situation for them moving was different than it normally would be.  If they were current on their rent and didn't move into the other places, I don't see any reason why they aren't entitled to their deposit back.  My suggestion would be to try and not be argumentative but tell the LL that they are formally requesting their deposit back and failing that will be taking action to ensure their rights are enforced.  Don't do this verbally, put it in writing - email is best.  Wait a week and go the nearest LTB office - staff will give you the right form to fill out if the LL doesn't come through."

Side note to anyone else reading this - ALWAYS have renters insurance, and if your living space has a basement pay the extra for sewage coverage! We lost over half our stuff with our sewage back up, and had to stay in a hotel for several weeks while my LL made the house liveable again.

But I found it noisy and too open at our site, no privacy whatsoever. Crawling with people as well, kids screaming everywhere, parties/music going on, dogs barking. To me, SG is a place to enjoy over the course of a few days to a week. It's all the trails and sights and exploration of the park that makes it wonderful, and most of the best stuff isn't car-accessible. The views are indeed exceptional, but they require hiking and time to reach. It sounds like you're just making a quick stop. For just a quick night's sleep, I'd keep driving.  I also don't care for Pancake Bay that much. It doesn't really offer much other than a beach (which you can get from the much prettier Agawa Bay), and I found it noisier than Agawa. Both are beside the highway. Rabbit Blanket is nice, especially if you want some peace and quiet. Everytime I go there, there are barely any other people, even in the peak season. Agawa and Rabbit Blanket are both in Lake Superior PP. Also done Crescent Lake and backcountry at LSPP but those are probably not what you're looking for if you're just stopping by. Rainbow Falls is nice too.  If you don't mind going a little bit off the Transcanada (which if you were going to SG, you'd have to do as well), my suggestion is Pukaskwa NP. Easily my favourite park in Ontario (my second most frequented behind Agawa). Sometimes I'm torn between telling everyone how much I love it and keeping it to myself as my little secret, but hey, I've never been there and had it packed full of people anyway. It has a different feel than a lot of the provincial parks. Very laid back, not a lot of Ontarian family-vacationers. Not a party/holiday park. Quiet, private sites. It tends to be the more hardcore backcountry campers, locals, kayakers, lots of BC visitors, and Americans... mostly cos it's notably Ontario's only wilderness park. It's about halfway between Sleeping Giant and Lake Superior PP. Easy to drive into your campsite (choose the north loop if you can), and there are a lot of short hikes that you can do if you're time-limited. Even just take a canoe out into Hattie Cove for an hour or 2. You won't be going into the interior of the park of course, but even the area around the campsites/visitor centre has some lovely views and nice hike, and the Anishinaabe camp. I can't really decide which I like most. The Southern Headland gives great views over the park, but the Manitou Miikana was always very special to me. Bimose Kinoomagewnan is beautiful too, especially with the teachings along the way. And the beaches all have their own ""personalities"". (I doubt you'd be doing the day-long White River hike.) Do not expect to see caribou. Pukaskwa is very special for its woodland caribou but you won't see them. I've heard of people going there with the intention of seeing them and then complaining when they don't.  I've heard Kakabeka is nice, but like another poster, I've only ever seen the falls, not camped there."

Down my direction of Ontario we have an over abundance of power, with Wind Turbines and Nuclear.

I don't know, I don't live in the area, but I've always absolutely loved the Muskoka area for it's incredible natural beauty. Beauty which I know still largely exists even with large dams in the Bracebridge area. This issue seems like it would be easier for a local to really understand."

ontario,3c5j3t,oerich,15,Sun Jul 5 00:23:05 2015 UTC,"So would taxes levied on private sale of alcohol.  Of course, the trade-off is that, while the LCBO actively works to promote sales of its product, it does so in a limited and conservative way: makes alcohol look classy, emphasises the quality and range of products they offer (rather than a cheap price, a quick way to get drunk, etc.) and situates alcohol as something you drink over dinner or at a BBQ or after you get back from yachting around the... yacht... place... rather than a recreational activity on its own merits.  Private-sector vendors would not be so circumspect in promoting their product. Advertising would be more aggressive, and the tone would be less conservative, more inclined to ""give the people what they want"". (At the LCBO, the ads will never show a whole bottle of wine on the couch while watching reruns of The Golden Girls, but we all know this shit happens, right?) Obviously, Wine Rack isn't about to start selling their booze as ""the shame drink, for when you're lonely"", but they're happy to sell you a crate of wine coolers -- in fact, you should buy that whole crate, pre-chilled, because they'll give you a discount! Hell, buy three!  This plays into other questions -- how much does advertising really affect consumer behaviour? should we just allow people to buy however much alcohol as they want, of whatever type they want, on-demand? (isn't it paternalistic to say ""no""?) -- and it's turtles all the way down."

ontario,3c5j3t,TomCADK,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:04:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you for posting this, I would love to weigh in on this. The LCBO was one of the supply chains that I took a look at during course work in commerce during university. Full disclosure, I am biased in the sense that I believe the LCBO outdated and past its point of efficiency, also have some friends who went into importing higher end stuff in Ontario and hear their issues. I also looked into moving Ontario ice wine to international markets and the loops they put you through makes it almost not worth it. Also, most of my criticism after analysis lies with The Beer Store.  1. The relationship with the Beer Store It's important to recognize first of all, that The Beer Store (TBS) is not a nationalized entity but a private group with exclusive selling rights, granted by the LCBO in 1927. It also sells on average about 80% of beer sold in Ontario and is also the largest seller to restaurants, bars and etc. Apparently, something like 90% of people in Ontario are unaware of this and think sales are going to the government and that the government owns the assets of TBS. Supposedly, it was created for political reasons and also to help with the large quantity distribution of beer. It's ownership is comprised of 49% Labatt (ABinBev), 49% Molson Coors, and 2% Sleeman (Sapporo), none of which are Canadian companies. They also enjoy many selling privileges, have you enter wondered why you can't buy anything more than a 6 pack at the LCBO, you can thank TBS for enforcing selling rights.  TBS is listed as a not for profit organization, so they enjoy a list of benefits including certain tax exemptions that not-for-profit corporations enjoy. Here's where some grey area happens, some politicians argue that TBS operates on a break-even point. However, most recognize a change to needs to be done and that TBS has been reaching past their boundaries. Studies have shown that TBS makes in between $700 million and $ 1 billion in 'incremental profits' on roughly $10.9 billion in sales per year from being a near monopoly and charging their own prices in Ontario. This figure does not account for the beer sales from brewery to TBS, but profit from TBS to Ontario consumer. By the way, they don't add revenue to the government coffers, it goes to the breweries. Let's put this in perspective, the country's second largest grocery chain that operates in all 10 provinces is Sobeys. In 2012, Sobeys earned $16.29 billion in revenue and earned $339 million in profit. Granted, the government has announced it plans to tack a 'franchise fee' on TBS set a paltry $100 million in response to monopoly criticisms and the need to pay the province's deficit.  TBS has also been criticized for closing off competition towards other major brewers and micro brewers based in Ontario. TBS in store promotions are almost entirely based on promotions geared towards their brands and refuse other brands to exercise similar promotions in store.   Price comparisons with other provinces who have a liquor board also show that Ontario residents pay between 33.3% and 50% more for the same beer and believe the difference is going to the government just as the LCBO does. However, its important to recognize the the LCBO negotiates these terms yearly with TBS. There's plenty of evidence for collusion out there between TBS and the LCBO but I don't want to bore you guys. If you get bored then I seriously recommend checking out government subsidies to TBS as well.  2. Cost, Inefficiencies and Employee Salary in LCBO Sales were roughly $5 Billion (2013) and generated $1.7 billion (2013) for the government, which sounds good. However, studies and comparisons in other provinces have shown revenue for the government would increase for the government if the monopoly was dismantled. Also, consumers and government would benefit surplus form due to the monopolistic nature of the LCBO creating a deadweight loss society.   Some of the studies I posted talk about the inefficiencies of the LCBO and I want to point another one out about buying power (one of the largest in the world) and the Auditor General of Ontario agrees.  There are approximately full time 3,700 employees with approximately 260 making over $100,000 according to the 2013 Ontario financial disclosure. I'm all for good pay, but their positions are overpaid compared to industry counterparts and are less likely to be held accountable as well. However, it would also be important to check the financial reports released by LCBO to see employees so here's the 2013 and if go to page 95, you can see the employee cost breakdown, where total employee costs fielded around $435 million. There were about 6900 total employees, 3,700 of which are full time and were the only ones applicable for the benefits. Breaking down the figure, 3,200 part time employees earning $15/hour at 25hrs/week for 49 weeks of the year would have consumed about $58.8 million, this is just an estimated figure. Anyways, it was found that the labor cost in 2013 for a full time employee was around $100,000, and other figures stating average salary at $58,000, plus benefits and other costs. This was the same year they threatened to strike for salary. Bear in mind total median income in Ontario for 2013 was $31,820.  3.Pricing Argument  The single report that the LCBO guards themselves with is a York university report from 1994 that was partly funded and prepared by the union. The criticisms it received was heavy. There were mistakes and holes that challenges the credibility of the real facts in the report, from incorrect dates to manipulated numbers. One of the primes premises is that we would see prices drive up instead of down has no standing ground in the report. I will give them one though, variety will probably be challenged in rural areas. Comparisons with other provinces who have deregulated show price decreases. Here's what is important to remember, even though I agree tax are important, it's also important to remember collection and dispersion is expensive and that several dollars were used to generate $1 for the government from the LCBO and was backed by studies like this one, which I highly recommend.   There is also several different arguments against the LCBO that I can go further in detail if anyone is interested, e.g the prohibition theory behind the LCBO, transparency issues and etc.  Thanks for taking the time to read this!  Some of the studies I could find that I had looked at before  York university report from 1994  Independent University of Waterloo Study  Auditor General of Ontario Report  Crown 2013 Financial Disclosure  LCBO 2013 Report"

ontario,3c3qon,iCylon,19,Sat Jul 4 14:02:51 2015 UTC,"I agree males should be vaccinated too, but all of this (as with all medical reporting) is a bit misleading; offering Gardasil was controversial enough when it began and it's no wonder it started this way. Women are at higher risk because of cervical and vulvar cancer as well as maternal infection of the fetus. The cesarean section rate has increased to avoid transmission during vaginal birth. Those are bigger risks than for males, that's just a fact. And the HPV vaccine is available to males too, as well as older women and men, it's just not covered under OHIP; the province is examining doing so. I think it was less a cost factor alone and more the fact it was hard enough to sell parents on vaccinating their daughters, hell, it still is. Gardasil remains controversial and is blamed for reactions in females who have received it.  So no, it's not just a tightfisted province neglecting the health of boys. It's a hard vaccine to implement thus far with controversial opinions, and as usual the Post is doing its shoddy medical reporting solely to rake up muck. This paper does a horrible job on medical reporting regularly. This MRA type post title isn't helping."
ontario,3c3qon,thepanichand,-2,Sat Jul 4 16:25:43 2015 UTC,"Canadian Medical Association, the Canadian Cancer Society and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization have been petitioning the Ontario government to cover the cost of the HPV vaccine for boys  Alberta and Prince Edward Island already cover the cost of the immunizations for both boys and girls, and so too will Nova Scotia as of this coming fall. And there’s good reason for that: doctors say that the rates of oral cancers among men have risen dramatically over the past several years, with HPV present in about two-thirds of cases.    This issue seems pretty black and white. We have a vaccine we can use to prevent mouth and throat cancer. Instead of using it to help males, we have people such as /u/Zaneris who believe boys should only be protected through ""herd immunity"".  Am I the only one disturbed by that mentality?   Vaccination is not controversial. Paying 400$ per dosage is pennies in terms of preventative medication.   EDIT:  Please don't try and derail this important discussion by labeling it as a MRA type issue. This is about health and safety.   If we develop a vaccine for HIV/AIDS and we only gave it to men, saying that ""herd immunity"" would protect women, would you stand for that?"
ontario,3c3qon,DotAClone,8,Sat Jul 4 17:14:57 2015 UTC,"The title is written in MRA fashion; I object to that.   Cervical and vulvar cancers as well as fetal transmission are still bigger risks than oropharyngeal carcinoma comparatively. Only 1% of people with oral HPV have the type associated with carcinoma (type 16). Part of the reason only females were offered the vaccine is because if enough of them get it, males are therefore secondarily protected. This is flawed and doesn't account for gay males transmitting HPV, of course.  I'm not saying it shouldn't happen, I think it should, and likely it will; the province isn't stupid and knows that 400 dollars of vaccines is still cheaper than surgical/oncology care, but policy has to be written, risks and benefits analysed, and education implemented. Considering how resistant parents have been to vaccinating their daughters, it's a flawed project at best, anyhow. It's just not likely top priority considering how resistant parents are for their daughters anyhow.   My objection is to how this article paints it as some sort of gross neglect on the part of the provincial government, instead of being a vaccine fraught with controversy and noncompliance."

ontario,3c3qon,thepanichand,10,Sun Jul 5 16:56:20 2015 UTC,"This is the idea, but because it's been difficult thus far to get parents of girls to comply, it's not the current reality. I agree with vaccinating males because of this."
ontario,3c3qon,thepanichand,5,Sat Jul 4 16:58:42 2015 UTC,"And the boys affected in the meantime are what, collateral damage?"
ontario,3c3qon,subtle_mistakes,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:13:15 2015 UTC,Vaccines don't help people who already have the disease. They help prevent it from manifesting. So the discussion of boys who already have it is irrelevant.
ontario,3c3qon,SchrodingerE,4,Sat Jul 4 17:38:02 2015 UTC,"And if you don't currently have it but want to prevent it, you're out of luck."
ontario,3c3qon,mpd618,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:04:14 2015 UTC,"Public health isn't a matter of what feels more PC or how equality plays into it. You have a finite amount of resources and a finite budget, you allocate them to have the best impact possible. Keeping that in mind it's better to treat women with the vaccine, because of it's efficacy and epidemiology of the disease itself. It isn't that the government hates boys and prioritizes girls over them... it's a matter of spending your resources as best as possible. I'm a man, and not some feminist either, so don't think I'm speaking out of a proverbial vagina. If the community at large was better served by giving the vaccine to men alone, that's exactly what would be done.  As far as preventing it is concerned, don't be overly promiscuous, condoms and dental dams, and get yourself and your partner tested. If you're still scared practice abstinence."
ontario,3c3qon,SchrodingerE,3,Sat Jul 4 20:35:11 2015 UTC,"That's somewhat incorrect. You can still get HPV even without barrier protection. And abstinence really shouldn't ever be considered an option in any case. Only vaccinating females neglects the fact there is male to male sexual transmission, as well as poor compliance thus far for females with the vaccine. This is why I agree with males being vaccinated too, but it's stupid to blame it solely on cost alone."

ontario,3c2047,StarGehzer,6,Sat Jul 4 03:30:37 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Taxis in Toronto currently have to pay quite a high annual licensing fee, and they have to pay for a vehicle that is separate from their own personal vehicle. It's not just due to the differences in service that makes taxis unable to compete with Uber. There's basically no way for taxis to undercut Uber because Uber drivers don't have to pay these fees."

ontario,3c2047,darrrrrren,7,Sat Jul 4 14:06:00 2015 UTC,Personal liability won't cover the driver/vehicle at all unless the vehicle has commercial insurance.
ontario,3c2047,cargonet,2,Sat Jul 4 03:40:25 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. According to my insurance broker and company. Since there is no exchange of cash in the car. The passenger is covered under personal liability. No different then them being a friend your driving home, or being a DD."

Most understand that they can't lower their prices but they can at least improve the whole experience of taking a cab. Take a shower before your shift, get off your cell phone when you're driving, slow the fuck down and stop weaving in and out of traffic, don't lie to me about not having credit/debit available because you want cash and don't scoff at the tip that I leave you because you think you deserve more.

I can say the clarity of calls and my data connection has improved quite a lot recently. But I am inside Toronto so maybe infrastructure improvements hasn't reached outside of Toronto yet.   However Wind has always been extremely spotty service wise regardless.
ontario,3bvgk0,turdovski,3,Thu Jul 2 15:59:23 2015 UTC,The problem in my case is that it was working acceptably before. Now suddenly the reception quality has badly decreased. As if Wind had suddenly destroyed their cell towers?

My plan, although is high in comparison to Wind really gets the bang for the buck.  I never have any network issues. My LTE is fast and pretty much everywhere I go. I have family in rural Ontario and it works great, with 3G. Everyone else has no service.  Not to mention NHL Game Centre included in my plan and Roam Like Home is a good deal too.

ontario,3bwkqw,CubeTurret,3,Thu Jul 2 19:13:15 2015 UTC,"There hasn't been credible speculation about Ontario defaulting on debt but the issue is our government is vastly overspending and doesn't seem overly concerned about curbing spending.  As well, the government has no shame when examples of wasteful spending are brought to light - I'm not going to repeat the examples.  This debt has (at least) two negative effects.  Firstly, the debt interest has to be paid.  Did you know this year the total debt payments (interest only - none of the debt is being retired, in fact it is actually growing) is $10 and half billion dollars?  That's about 10% of every dollar the government of Ontario spends!  Think of how that money could be redeployed or better yet, how you could spend that money the government has to tax you to raise the money.  That kind of leads to the second issue.  If you are an international employer or even someone from Ontario looking to invest your money in a business, you know that this debt is going to have to paid soon so you will be less likely to start the business, or open a branch, in Ontario as you don't know if the government will raise taxes substantially.  It is often said businesses dislike uncertainty above all else and this is a perfect example of that.    As the government doesn't have money to spend you are going to see labour unrest from the civil service - the teachers are just starting to warm up.  Expect other examples in the next couple of years.  I'm an optimist so I think Ontario can rise above this current governments malfeasance but labour unrest in the short term and changes in the longer term are fairly safe predictions that I'll make."

We actually have pretty low spending per capita compared to the rest of the country, but the revenue has dried up quick.

The doom and gloom shit sells in media so they are prone to it, no one wants to read articles that say everything is fine.  Right now your seeing lots of doom and gloom because the economy is not doing so hot and since politicians like to take credit for job increases(though I would argue their influence is nebulous at best) people like to blame them when there are fewer jobs.   The economy follows a boom and bust cycle and this cycle had a particularly big bust. What your apt to see in the future is similar to what you have now, perhaps a little better, perhaps a little worse but we're unlikely to see a catastrophic event that causes major change.  With regards to the liberals failings in government that's just what you get when you have a long serving government which in this case is a result of poor opposition, both in campaigning and in the legislature.   Many people in /r/ontario like to blame the libs for a bunch of problems we are currently facing but don't make the mistake of thinking a different party would be any better. My opinion is that regardless of the party in power we usually end up in a similar place, perhaps a little left leaning or right leaning depending on the party in power but generally the same place. Politicians like to campaign on wedge issues and focus on the things that make them different from their competitors but they're mostly the same."

If everyone in Ontario put back for months on end they would stop pretty damn fast.
ontario,3br5hr,KaneHart,0,Sat Jul 4 19:53:35 2015 UTC,"Canada Post's main source of revenue is postage. Not your taxes. Companies pay Canada Post to deliver their flyers to every mail box within certain local regions to their business.  So no, you are at fault. You are making your local mail carrier's life difficult for no reason. If everyone in Ontario or Canada followed your advice of being difficult, then I think everyone in Ontario would do better without CP mail services, and look forward to getting everything delivered through the more expensive private companies. Your bills, any documents that you need to receive, anything that you want in the mail would be a lot more expensive.  All because you can't quit whining, and put some junk in the recycling bin. I mean how lazy can someone be to really complain about this? It takes what...3-5 minutes a week to take out your mail, sort of the junk and then throw the 'junk mail' in the recycling bin."

ontario,3bpflk,baseball-cap,55,Wed Jul 1 02:23:19 2015 UTC,"I'm from Bruce County.  Somethings that I think you might not know about in general.  People from small towns/the country tend to have a negative perception towards people from the city, that they are snooty, think they are better than you, kind of attitude (the term for this person is a citiot).  That being said, I think that small town people are, in general, kinder to their neighbours and to strangers as well.  There is also a much more relaxed feel in small towns/the country.  There is just a lot less, all the time.  Less cars, less people, less noise.  One of the biggest changes I found when I went to university in Waterloo was getting used to more people and cars all the time.  Some differences growing up: I didn't know much about certain things that someone from the city would assume was common knowledge, such as, how to use a public bus/the subway, that J-walking was a legitimate thing you could be charged with, I had never had a shawarma until university, things like that.  That being said, I know more about things like hunting, fourwheeling, snowmobiling, farming and things like that, than my city friends.  There are almost no minorities in small towns.  I imagine that there is more racism there than in cities, though I don't think it is that bad (it would have been much worse years ago).  In small towns, everyone knows someone, someway, somehow.  Everyone either is related somehow to someone, worked with them somehow, went to school with them, played sports with them, etc.  This leads to word travelling very quickly about anything that happens.  People tend to complain that there is nothing to do in small towns.  I disagree, I just think that there are different things to do in small towns that you might not be used to.  Now, I am completely biased but I love living in a small town and would not have it any other way.  I appreciate what the city has to offer, but I just don't think it compares to the small town feel.  I hope that answered some of your questions, let me know if you want something specific answered."

There was one gas station in town, two video stores, two convenience stores, a grocery store, a music store and an LCBO that had a section for beer in the back. The highlight of the year was the Fall Fair, we drove to Guelph to see movies (no theatre, or bowling alley, or anything really) and hanging with friends around bonfires was really popular. It was pretty awesome, but I knew I eventually wanted to move to the city...in big part because I was the only gay person I knew and I couldn't let anyone know because the general consensus seemed to be that it wasn't a good idea (high school ended in 1996)."

My favourite has always been small towns. The pace is slower, the people are kinder and more social with strangers. Neighbours become friends instead of just people you wave hello to in passing. Winter is more of a pain because small towns don't have as many plows and salt trucks but the summers are beautiful and things get busier because of cottagers. Another downside to small towns is that there isn't much cultural diversity, which is what makes living in the city exciting an interesting. You get a wide variety of different restaurants and shops that offer things from all over the world. In small towns you'll find mainly popular chains and a few mom and pop places. Entertainment is very different in small towns. You can hit up a local bar or drive out to a mall or theatre but I found I was mainly going to barbecues, house parties and other social gatherings thrown by locals. If you like camping and hiking though a small town will usually have great places for that close by.

It's nothing like pushing through traffic in the GTA where it takes 20 minutes to get 1 block away to the grocery store on a freaking saturday morning.   People in small towns generally don't care for the city, especially traffic. Some can handle it, others will avoid traffic like the plague because it just pisses them off, so they'll never drive in the GTA. They usually love camping, and somehow own a house, cottage, bikes, brand new trucks, boats, and other things. I say somehow because fuck that shit's expensive, and that's not including insurance, fuel, and other things.   Anyway, the air seems cleaner, it's obviously not as dense in population, it would be like heading out past Oshawa where there are smaller towns like Bowmanville, just not as many newer nice looking houses. The roads are also piles of shit. Your vehicle's suspension will not last long.   Speaking of vehicles, you can get away with a car, but it's more convenient to own a truck, or an SUV, preferable with 4x4 or all wheel drive. Why? 'cause they're higher up, and in some cases, you may want to put it in 4 because winters are long here. The shit they put on the roads will destroy a car. Trucks and SUVs also suffer, but they're higher up so they don't get it as bad. It also gets cold, like -40C for a week or more straight during Jan / Feb.

I can give you insight into Durham Region (medium sized) or actual bum-fuck nowhere (heard of Westport? Delta? 45 minutes away from Kingston). Look up the Letterkenny Problems series on YouTube, but understand it's not actually that different (I'd link you but mobile)  Small towns can have cliche nuggets but for the most part, not so much. Thanks, internet. Cultural ties are easier bridged with technology, in terms of manners you may find more conservative tendencies. Example, some Westport residents remember the first black family to move in. For some, it was the first time they saw a black person in real life. Depends where the small town is, how old it is, how connected it is, and general demographics. Feel free to ask any more questions!"

A real city, to ontario standard, was Québec, 7 hours away. Lifestyle wasn't the same as let say, Aliston, Ontario. There was nothing, including little law, you could use your ATV, snowmobile, from downtown into the forest, and then, it was infinite forest. Hunting? No body gave a flying fuck about it.   The other town I grew up in, was in between Montréal and Québec. It was polluted by city people. More people who didn't like hunting, more people who didn't like to see teenagers using ATV to get to the trail through the towns, so we had more law prohibiting everything. southern Ontario's small town is a lot like the last one. They are small, but polluted by city mentality of prohibition.  Best description I can give about living in small town.

Point is, the pros and cons for small towns vs. Big cities can vary depending on how you look at it. Sure you pay more to drive a but to stock up; but the drive there is usually a nice one.

Saying pricing is ""steep"" in Ontario is a colossal understatement. I'm 34, been riding for 2 years on a CBR250R and I am paying $980/yr (living at Yonge and Eglinton).  Get as much training as you can, as it will help a little.  Maintenance can and will be a bit pricy if you take it to a shop. If you are not experienced mechanically, then best have a professional do the work while you learn what you can here and there. My friend just had full service done upon purchasing a '06 Ninja 250 and he paid $325 for complete inspection, oil/filter change, adjustments and tune-up. Now, you won't have to pay that much that often, especially if you take care of the bike. Keep your chain clean and lubed, check your tyres every week as well, check brake fluid levels too.  Parts pricing can easily be sussed out online (revzilla, motorcycle-superstore, canadasmotorcycle, and a plethora of OEM dealers are a google search away).  Lastly, don't allow your emotions to take hold while you ride - always keep your head up and eyes moving and look for your exits (escape routes) and never target fixate on obstacles: you follow your gaze, so look between objects to get through alive and in one piece.  Oh yeah, don't forget to have fun :)"

ontario,3boodw,YorkP0rk,3,Wed Jul 1 08:31:13 2015 UTC,"Coming from a lengthened discussion with a southwestern city police recruiter I can tell you what you need to get at least an interview.  1. Network, like anything in life, network who you know, cold call/email recruiters and ask about the career to see if it is even for you 2. Finish undergrad, most hires are 25-28 years old with a degree. I say this emphatically. Do not waste your time at police foundations (it is, for 99% of program grads, a fast track to security) They send new hires to police college anyways where they will teach you the proper tools they use. Undergrad shows your ability to process intellectual thoughts. 3. Be social. Sign up for volunteer work, which i think is a given. It gives you something to qualify when they ask what you enjoy doing. The key is to not leave your schedule blank. They won't respect someone with plentiful hours of free time and no ambition to fill it. Even if it is the odd social friend hangout.  4. Athletics. This is two fold. There is the aspect that people with an athletic background, such as basketball or hockey, display abilities of working in a team atmosphere and gives a leg up over others. The other aspect is of course your own fitness levels. Don't be out of shape and lift a 20 pound dumb bell and you will be ok to pass the entry test.   Take your time while finishing undergrad to network with some people you may know or recruiters and see if it is for you. The entry level fitness test I think is around $400 or so to even apply and only last 6 months.  They hire quarterly, so if you decide this is for you, break down a calendar year into 4 and apply two months prior to that. Ie. April is one quarter so apply in February. This will give you the best chance to be pulled from the pile. And of course the recruiter will recognize your name already from your previous networking.  All the best in figuring out your calling."

The physical side is the beep test and a short course inclusive of jumping over barriers and an imitation of restraining someone. The link will provide a better detail than this so check it out. Click on the police constable link when the page opens. At 23, you are in the grey area of being hired as a cadet or a constable, but this will become more clear as you network.  The fact you are female definitely works in your favour. I will be honest in my opinion and say without an undergrad degree, it will be very challenging to get in. The way to overcome that is through your networking efforts as well as your extra curricular involvements."

Right now, there are tons of Ontario Colleges that have policing programs. You can check that out here. Unfortunately that means there are a high number of graduates for relatively few positions, making the field incredibly competitive. Police departments have the option right now to take only the best and the brightest and those with the best experience.  A running joke right now is that police foundations courses get you a job working security, and for the most part that is true. While they will give you a leg up over the general population, you can't rely on those diplomas and degrees to land you a job. In fact, the most attractive candidate are those with at least an undergraduate university degree in something like psychology and a couple years experience in the related field.   Some of the other posters here are correct, the RCMP is continually recruiting from university and college campuses, you may have even seen their booths around. If you're serious about policing you should definitely give that a try.   If I had to give you shot in the dark advice, knowing basically nothing about you, I'd say complete med school (if you can afford it/ grades are good/ have the motivation, etc.) Then apply for any and every police department you can, even if it means relocating.

Police don't ""serve and protect"", they do the politicians dirty work,   Again there is some of this, but smaller, rural policing allows for more Community type policing, which is probably more along the lines of what most people would have as their ideal.  At least we aren't the states as far as doing the bidding of the political elite and big business."

ontario,3boodw,ufd,-2,Fri Jul 3 17:11:13 2015 UTC,The Ontario Police College in Aylmer (about 30 minutes SE of London) is where you want to start.  Strangely they don't have a website that is easy to find - the link I've provided has contact info but is from 2006.  I think I heard once 80% of OPP officers graduated here.

ontario,3boodw,ufd,2,Wed Jul 1 02:54:35 2015 UTC,"As /u/AmosParnell indicates, you can not apply directly to OPC (Ontario Police College), you have to have been hired by a police service first, and you attend as a recruit/probationary officer.  Back about 30 years ago when I went through OPC, the police service that you were working for paid tuition, but that has changed.  Currently the rookie/probationary constable pays this and has it is garnisheed off of his/her wages (you get paid as a Probationary Constable while attending OPC).  I believe that the tuition for OPC is now $7500 but I have heard it is going up to $11,000 in the near future.  Contrary to what /u/EngSciGuy has indicated, not many dolts get through, the probationary period weeds them out.  Also, police services are aware that they require succession planning and the smart people seek out promotion or technical aspects of the job."

However, this law is more for devices that aren't part of your car, GPS, Ipod, Cell phone, etc   I usually change my radio station at a red light and have done so beside cops, however again don't pay to much attention if you sit there fiddling with it while the light goes green you aren't paying to much attention as it is."

In addition to being aware of their blind spots and noticing when a trucker is driving as if they're overtired etc, it's also that truck drivers often have more up-to-date information about conditions, accidents ahead, etc.   I learned this latter part after a pair of trucks stopped traffic ahead of me on the top of a large rise in the highway, and everyone in the jam was raging at them until emergency services showed up and we learned of the massive ten-car pileup on the other side of the rise that nobody could have seen until it was too late otherwise."

ontario,3bnb4o,TheDoubleDecker,2,Tue Jun 30 16:25:41 2015 UTC,"Call the cops and inquire about the car, may be in their database for whatever reason.  Any idea of when the car would have been initially towed?   Also, see what the bylaws for Barrie are with regards to towing. Locally, due to predatory towing practices a tow company is supposed to call in the car 15 minutes before they tow, and they have to call it in to the cops when they tow it to avoid ""my car was stolen"" reports.  How the lot is signaged will determine what will or won't apply.   My first question is; Who owns the property where this car was parked? Do the aunt & uncle? Or do they lease a storefront with a few parking spots? If so, contact the property owner and ask them whats going on. Any signs in the parking lot to the effect of: ""Unauthorized vehicles will be towed by XYZ company"" or ""Lot patrolled by XYZ towing, unauthorized vehicles will be towed""? If there is, make a phone call.  Don't get mad at them. They are doing the service the property owner has contracted them to do. Fly's, Honey, and all that. If they did tow it, see if they can provide who initially called in the tow.  If it is a case of the lot being patrolled by them, I hate to say it, but tough beans for not making a call to them to make sure they know that the car has been okayed to be parked there for an extended period of time. But bigger beans to the a&u for not doing so after giving you the okay IF they own the parking lot. If somebody else owns the lot, you essentially abandoned a vehicle on it.   If the car was there today, how long would it have been parked?  And yes, contact is supposed to be attempted by whoever wants to gain ownership (ie: tow company after having the car sit in a lot for X weeks will put a lein on it in order to gain ownership and recoup towing and storage fees). You could buy a used vehicle sellers package from the MTO and see if the car has changed ownership. You will need the VIN number for this, not the plate number (plate only gets you plate owner information: you).  One important detail, when you say you recieved no letters to your mailing address, was this mailing address the same as the address that is on the ownership? Ownership address is the only address that needs letters sent to it, there is no obligation on anyones part to play detective to find an address you are living at if it is not the one on the ownership.   How the hell do the a&u forget about a car? If they had it towed from their property, I'd be on them to provide fair market value to you for the car as it is their actions that caused the vehicle to be towed. Civil matter, so good luck with that. Are you in the habit of leaving the ownership in the car? The sellers package might reveal some shenanigans by the a&u if they forged a signature on the ownership to sell it...     You have some investigating to do, and I'd start with checking out the parking lot personally looking for what sort of signage there is."

ontario,3bnb4o,cykloid,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:10:27 2015 UTC,Check the local by-laws regarding the towing of vehicles from private properties. These matters are not legislated at the provincial level and the laws vary from municipality to municipality. You should be able to determine from that who would have the authority to remove vehicles from private properties. Do not call the police because they do not have anything to do with the removal of illegally parked cars from private properties. Call the local by-law department and ask them to check their records.

ontario,3bnddf,Lord_Canada,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:54:52 2015 UTC,"Finished my HBA from the University of Toronto in 2012. Went to the University of Windsor's Faculty of Education Program in 2013. I have also completed two additional qualification programs through the University of Toronto, both online courses.  The school part of teachers' college is easy. If you are doing well in undergrad, youll have no problem in the lecture environment. As long as you apply yourself decently, the class work is easy.  I did three practicums. One in Windsor and Two in Toronto. The Windsor Classroom was that class every teacher wants to have, quiet, settled and ready to learn. I had one amazing class experience and one poor class experience in Toronto. The poor class experience was what I was told was ""the norm"" for the GTA. The classroom is where youll learn everything, especially the reality of teaching. It is a great experience if you really want to learn how to speak infront of groups, learn to educate other meaningfully. If you want a teaching degree as a backup to pursue down the road or as you are looking for a job, I would recommend it.  I got out of Teacher's College and everything became a mess. Firstly, the school boards arent organized under any hiring authority. Youll bounce back and forth between applytoeducation, educationcanada and a few boards like Peel have their own private website. One of the two largest hurdles are knowing when occasional teaching positions become available to apply for and getting passed the board requirements. A good example was that I couldnt apply to Waterloo Region DSB for almost a year because they required all new OT applicants to have atleast one AQ, which lessened the school boards in my area. Then your fighting for a 30% hire rate.  I dont know your personal situation. If you have time to work toward a teaching career, I think its a fun job and I hope one day to get hired. However, its not a job you should aim for if you need a job 6 months out of school. Its a job you should expect in 2-5 years possibly never.  IVe already started looking at going back to school and upgrading my own skillset and unfortunately, leaving the teaching profession behind."

I found those classes really fun to teach, like the content.  I think my finding a job experience is pretty common. They told us in TC that it took between 2-5 years to get in, work toward LTO qualifications and then work into teaching. I dont think my situation is isolated.  I do think there is more I could have done to improve my chances of getting hired out of the college. I should have researched the qualifications for the school boards to be aware of the AQ's and taken an AQ in the first summer out. It would also benefit more to have references in lieu of your practicum reports. Upper Grand DSB required three references from people who have seen you teach to apply for their Intermediate/Senior supply positions and did not specify if it included practicum reports.  The only other thing I could suggest is being active in undergrad, volunteer, hell join your Workplace Safety Committee if your job has one.  While I dont think I was the worst candidate for positions, I definently could have done more to make myself a better candidate.  Actually, I am currently supplying for a private firm tutoring workplace preparation. Was a recent job and will hopefully give me a substantial reference down the road."

The Day Nursery Act has changed how many children you can have in your home, thus limiting your income. It could also affect the size of your own family if you're having your own kids. Your home and insurance are also factors to consider.  There are lots of options with starting your own, including registering with an umbrella cooperation which would find families for you, and give relief for personal appointments, etc. Some of these same corporations have multiple centers you can work in, from infants through school age in before and after school care. There are a lot of local home care groups you can join for support, and referrals, too.  It's tough to get into home care right out of school because many parents want experienced providers, but it could give you an edge if you charge slightly less to build experience.  Home care and center care are very different from a provider's perspective. Talk to both and find out what they consider to be pros and cons."

I think we pay more for hydro here than anywhere else in Canada. It's ridiculous.  Canadian craft beer is the shizz. Definitely look into microbreweries and try as many as you can. Actually, Toronto has a distillery district that you have to check out if you like beer - Mill Street Brewery is worth a visit! They have a restaurant and the food is incredible.   Do you like roller coasters? because if you do, you have to visit Canada's Wonderland in Vaughan (it's part of the Greater Toronto Area). Holy shit, it's amazing.   Oh, and if you get a chance to see the Toronto Symphony Orchestra play at Roy Thompson Hall, do it! They are phenomenal.  EDIT Forgot to add a few things. Here are some other places you need to visit: the Bruce Peninsula, Goderich (must must!! it's gorgeous!), Manitoulin Island, Niagara Falls, Sauble Beach, Wasaga Beach, Killbear Provincial Park, and Haliburton."
ontario,3bk0ju,iCylon,2,Mon Jun 29 22:56:27 2015 UTC,"I'll second a couple of your points. Moving up farther into North York or east into Scarborough can (and will) save you a ton. I'm up near the 401 and I'm able to use transit for my commute, which is about 1-11/2 hours.  PC Financial is also great. Although it may not have as many amenities as other banks (though we do have photo cheque deposits now, awesome) it's a great no-fee experience."
ontario,3bk0ju,orlywrking,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:10:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your suggestions. My girlfriend will love the orchestra so ill pay attention to anything I see from them.  I love beer, so I'll be sure to check out the distillery district.   Bills are expensive, got'cha."
ontario,3bk0ju,DomashnaRakija,2,Tue Jun 30 01:54:48 2015 UTC,"You will also be not to far from Niagara on the Lake, several wineries do music-in-the-vineyard evenings which is pretty cool. Once you get to the town renting bicycles will allow you to get to pretty much all of them.  Getting to the town without a car is slightly complicated, but the ""Go train"" system has some trains going to St. Catharines nearby, and buses right to Niagara Falls. There are a couple craft breweries, Oast House and Silversmith."
ontario,3bk0ju,DomashnaRakija,3,Tue Jun 30 07:03:35 2015 UTC,"Heyo! Ontario driver here.  Licensing  First off, I think your understanding is generally correct. You can pick up an International Driver's Permit when you're still at home, and it seems like AA has you covered there. Per the information here, you'd be allowed to drive in Canada with this permit for 90 days without issue. After that point, things get a bit more ""grey"" in the legal area.  [OH! Before I forget, you should get a ""driver's abstract"" before you leave home. Definite solid ""plan ahead"" moment here. May not need it, but will be awesome to have planned if you do. You can get it while you're abroad, but it's way easier when you're there. Just ask them to give you your driver's history if they don't know what this is - it'll make things easy for local licensing or renting.]  After 90 days, if you're still just a ""visitor/tourist"", then MTO still allows you to drive with your IDP, or 60 days even just with your local tartan license (source). However, if you're a ""resident"", the Ministry of Transportation in Ontario (MTO) requires you to pick up a local license (same source, next sentence).  (Just FYI - MTO is the provincial government department that issues and overseas vehicle licensing in Ontario. Each province in Canada would have a similar provincial department, however an Ontario license from MTO should allow you to drive in other provinces for short trips without issue.)  There's contact information for MTO on that first link. They should be able to give you guidance on whether the IDP is enough, or if you need to take the extra step of getting a local one. Here are details on the requirements - if you've driven for two years, your Great Britishness basically gets you the license straight away, with just a vision test (though the exchange thing may be required in that case, according to the link someone else posted).  Car Ownership - Buying & Registering, Renting/Sharing and Insuring  As for car ownership, you might want to check some local listings to figure out if the cost/benefit really works out for you. Toronto's an expensive town, both in terms of housing (rent, electrical (called hydro here), gas, etc.), and food, and going out, etc. Keep in mind that you'll have registration (relatively cheap, but required) and insurance on top of that.  One popular alternative in Toronto is shared cars. Autoshare, Zipcar, and Car2Go are all pretty viable options - the first two for longer trips (even overnight, or multi day, at greater expense!), and the last one for short, 1-directional jaunts. Check out the features, location and pricing to figure out whether this is a better approach, given costs involved with car ownership and insurance.  Oh, and on insurance - you're legally required to have a license and car insurance if you're gonna drive here. If you get a rental car, you can buy the insurance from them. If it's Zipcar/Autoshare/Car2go, they can provide that for you too, either monthly (like $7 for Zip) or annually ($70ish for Zip). But if you're buying, that can be a steep bill. Here's the legal bits (and a cautionary note that might dissuade you from buying a car), and here's a skeezy place where you can sample the cost of insurance from a single source (you'd want to compare it with other providers, like a major bank and a local insurance broker, to get a better deal). It's crazy complicated and confusing, but basic idea is, it's a private market for insurance, based on the statistical likelihood of that type of car getting into wrecks. Find a reputable insurance dealer, and pick a super safe car if you want things to go smoothly and cheaply.  Apologies  Whew. Sorry for the wall of text. Just went through the process recently, so it happened to be top of mind. PM me if you have other questions.  Ignore the haters - Toronto is an awesome place, particularly if you're gonna see it for all 3 seasons (long winter, short spring, short fall - and a couple days that people claim are ""summer"", but only because they've never set foot outside of Toronto). It gets a bad rep from the rest of Canada, but it's partly due to those same obnoxious people who have never left, and partly because of the obnoxious people who have never visited. Plenty to see in the city, and lots nearby too. Plan a weekend in NYC (cheap local flights with Porter - get on their email list and you can get 40% or more discount by planning that in advance), or Chicago, or Portland. Maybe get out the Rockies (a bit expensive, but awesome if you like big things). See a Jays game, or the Leafs. Go camping up north. Make a friend and visit their cottage. Go to Montreal. Check out Niagara falls. And check out one of the thousands of awesome restaurants, pubs, bars, holes in the wall, and whatever else there is here."
ontario,3bk0ju,digital-troglodyte,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:24:31 2015 UTC,"No need to apologise, your reply was exactly what I was looking for.  We're not dead set on buying a car, but having that option would be great.  I'm definitely used to the 'couple of day long summer' so I'll have no problem acclimatising myself I hope.   Our end of year plan involves taking a car round America for a month or two, hence the desire for a car. And it's been said by other commenters that renting under the age of 25 can be expensive. With that in mind, is buying a car still cost prohibitive on a modest budget?  Thank you for putting together your comment, it's much appreciated."
ontario,3bk0ju,kcurr,2,Tue Jun 30 01:49:55 2015 UTC,Do you have an idea of what you can spend per month on rent? I currently live in Toronto and know that rent can be expensive if you want a decent place.
ontario,3bk0ju,Uter_Zorker,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:11:02 2015 UTC,We were ball parking it at $1000-1300. That equates to about £500-600 a month which seems fairly reasonable when we split it. What sort of areas should we be avoiding?
ontario,3bk0ju,me_myself_iii,2,Tue Jun 30 00:33:09 2015 UTC,That's a good range. I currently live in Forest Hill which is a more expensive area and pay $1250 a month but that gets you a nice place in a clean and very safe neighbourhood. Only other area I've lived in was around Lansdowne Avenue and Bloor St. There was a lot more crime and questionable people in that spot. If you want to live in the downtown core it's a lot more expensive if you want to live somewhere half decent. Going north of the city or east out to the suburb of Scarborough you can find some nice affordable places.
ontario,3bk0ju,Canadave,2,Tue Jun 30 07:12:14 2015 UTC,"As far as Downtown goes, avoid the area along Sherbourne from College down to Queen, it's near the major rehab facilities/methadone clinic and has a lot of dope users. I've been followed while walking in that area.  You'll have no problem finding housing with that budget. Personally I recommend living along the Danforth. It used to be a run-down area but has a strong neighbourhood organization that's really turned it around. Or try the Annex, lots of students living there. I only look at areas with subway access, personally, and if you're not getting a car that should be a consideration.  Edit: People tell you to move out of the core if you want to get a cheaper rent but I live near the north end of the subway line and the rent here is roughly the same as downtown. You're more likely to get a nicer place if you move further out but in terms of money it's not necessarily cheaper."

ontario,3bk0ju,digital-troglodyte,2,Tue Jun 30 22:06:22 2015 UTC,"I used to work at an English school downtown Toronto (Victoria and King Street) and I really advise for you to try to find an apartment near a subway line. This will be the best way to get around the city. Driving in Toronto traffic is not fun. If you arrive at the beginning of September I recommend you buy a monthly pass. If not then just keep buying weekly passes until the start of the next month so you can save some money. You can buy these subway passes at any station. At the language school I helped students find accommodations through homestay companies (where you are matched to live with a Canadian family). However, most of these aren't in the downtown area and are houses. We did help finding space at some student residences at well (UofT, York, etc.). We weren't supposed to help students with searching for their own apartments but I know most of them actually searched for apartments through kijiji or craigslist. Hope this helps!"

ontario,3bk0ju,cdnmr,2,Tue Jun 30 07:13:10 2015 UTC,"In terms of finding a condo or apartment here, the most convenient ones (if you can afford it) are by subway stations.   A map for your reference: https://votetvparty.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/toronto-subway-map.png  If you're staying in the core, I'd advise getting a metro pass rather than a car. It's easier to get around seeing as Toronto's traffic is terrible. That being said, there is a wonderful parks system here in Ontario and Canada in general. http://www.ontarioparks.com/en   I highly recommend taking a roadtrip to a park and camping out for a bit.

Just driving from one side of Southern Ontario to the other, say Windsor to Cornwall, is over 800 km, or roughly the same as driving from Aberdeen to Bristol. And that's just one province, and not even the big part of it.  So if you plan on driving around the US and Canada, be sure to plan out what you want to see carefully and budget the time it takes to get there accordingly, because it's probably a lot further than you think it is."

I hear lots of things about the market going to crash up here like in the US. The thing is, is it seems to be an annual comment that it will happen ""in the spring"" or ""in the fall.""  My money is betting on when all the baby boomers start to retire and/or sell their homes to downsize (or even go to nursing homes for the much older bunch.) That seems to be the only real reason the bubble will burst when homes flood the market and no one is buying, so prices will drop. That's when I'll buy."

ontario,3bfd5n,straemer,-6,Sun Jun 28 19:26:41 2015 UTC,They can't legally force you to take them.  They can pay them out or let them accumulate.  Edit: Apparently they can.  I've been misinformed.
ontario,3bfd5n,DAWTSF,30,Sun Jun 28 19:28:41 2015 UTC,"Yes they can. See http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/es/pubs/guide/vacation.php    The employer has the right to schedule vacation as well as an obligation to ensure the vacation time is scheduled and taken before the end of that ten-month period.   Vacation pay and vacation time are two separate but related things. The law is intended to basically force employers to let employees have time away from work.  The employee can request to forego their vacation time but the employer must approve that. Apparently the government has to approve it too...   An employee can give up some or all of his or her earned vacation time with the employer's written agreement and the approval of the Director of Employment Standards. This approval does not affect an employer's obligation to pay the employee vacation pay; employees may give up vacation time, but not the right to vacation pay."
ontario,3bfd5n,SocMedEngage,10,Sun Jun 28 19:45:54 2015 UTC,Yes they can. Look at car manufacturing companies. The Honda plant near where I live has a shut down period for two weeks in the spring and require their employees to go on vacation. It's perfectly legal.

You can give up any of the vacation time you've earned if you and your employer agree, in writing, and the Director of Employment Standards approves the agreement. However, the employer is still obligated to pay you any vacation pay earned with respect to that vacation time.  Edit: Additional info on vacation pay. People often believe it's 2 weeks of pay, but you may actually be entitled to more than that.   Vacation pay is calculated as a minimum of four per cent of the wages (excluding vacation pay) the employee earned in the vacation entitlement year or stub period for which the vacation is being given.  Wages include:   regular wages commissions bonuses and monetary gifts that are not discretionary or that are related to hours, production or efficiency overtime pay public holiday pay allowances for room or board termination pay"
ontario,3bfd5n,zap_pow_bang,2,Mon Jun 29 02:47:43 2015 UTC,"You, as an employee, are obligated to provide your employer with ten days of unpaid leave.  Your employer accrues your vacation pay with each pay cheque and they are to use those funds to pay you when you take that time off, rather than pay your wage.  If you don't take vacation time, you are effectively forcing your employer to pay you an extra two weeks wages, since they have also had to accrue your vacation pay.  That is why the obligation is on the employee to use them or lose them.  There is no obligation to carry unused days or vacation pay into the following year, and any vacation days granted beyond the statutory minimum are a voluntary benefit from the employer because they are obligated to pay your wages during the extra days.  Vacation pay is only intended to cover two weeks pay."

I believe they're averaging $15 per hour now (compared to minimum wage $11 per hour for part time) for full time, and can transfer you anywhere if they feel necessary. They've dropped a good amount of full time positions to satiate their need for quick and easy, dime a dozen part time employees. It is preventing the good part time workers from progressing and gaining a liveable wage, as the full timers are not giving up their positions (obviously). I hope it works out in the employees favour in the end."

I could also argue sitting at a desk pushing buttons all day shouldn't warrant $25 an hour, but it seems office jobs (for example) are more socially accepted.   Nonetheless, liveable wage employment is becoming harder to come by these days, and regardless of your effort, you're just paid to be at a job for 8 hours, regardless of how much (physical/actual) work you do."
ontario,3b7vyr,gluten_free_asbestos,8,Fri Jun 26 20:04:11 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding? Office jobs come in two types, low skill jobs which pay poorly, and high skill jobs that pay well. A low skill job like a receptionist (or someone who sorts fruit) is easy to replace, and requires very few specialized skills, thus they can't demand a high salary. A high skill job like an engineer or accountant can command a higher wage because the qualifications for their job are much higher, and it takes a ton of time and effort to replace them.   A fruit stacker may be a physically challenging job, but literally any able bodied person can do it. If you can be replaced by literally anyone, with almost zero training, you can't expect a really high salary."

ontario,3b7vyr,The1stCanary,-1,Sat Jun 27 14:03:47 2015 UTC,"I don't consider $15/hr to be unreasonable, but $25/hr definitely is. If everyone in a grocery store is making $50,000 a year, then groceries will start to get very expensive very quickly. I'm all for a minimum wage that people can live on, but the idea that someone stacking fruit should make more than a teacher is absurd. And yes, teachers should be paid more too, and it would be wonderful if we all suddenly got a raise, but that's not the world we live in, and in the world we live in, there are a shitload of people willing to stack fruit for less than $25/hr."

There aren't enough opportunities available to those who live here, and are searching for liveable jobs.  ""regardless of your effort, you're just paid to be at a job for 8 hours, regardless of how much (physical/actual) work you do.""

You have a guy doing a job that requires zero training or experience, and you decide to hire a second guy because you'd like to double productivity.  You post the job listing and you literally get 50 to 100 resumes an hour.  You're flooded with resumes.  Then you interview people, they know it's a competitive process, and you absolutely will get people offering to do it for less.  Then you have someone doing something that requires a huge amount of training, expertise and experience, like an engineer.  They're designing the products you sell, and if they walked out the door, it would take you weeks to find someone with the right skills, and months to get them up to speed.  They walk into your office and say, the company down the road is hiring engineers for $10,000 more a year than I make now, give me a raise or I'm gone.  You give them a raise.  A guy stacking fruit never has that kind of bargaining power - you can't go and say, ""Hey, give me a $10,000 a year raise, or I'll go stack fruit somewhere else."", because your boss will laugh in your face and have replaced you with someone just as good as you at your job in half a day.  Put another way, most people making high salaries aren't doing it because they have prestigious jobs, they're doing it because what they do is highly valuable, and they have bargaining power.  People making low salaries don't have bargaining power."

Market demands. No one is going to go through years of university to be paid the same amount as a vegetable handler. More people would sort vegetables if it paid the same amount as someone who studied and worked for a career that has more responsibilities, but then you would have an over supply, so the salaries are adjusted to reflect that.  Who you ask? Companies will pay the smallest amount they think they can, and not a penny more. So when they pay someone $15 an hour to sort vegetables, and someone else $100k+ per year to manage the risk analysis, they are doing because the market demands it."
ontario,3b7vyr,wanmoar,6,Sat Jun 27 06:11:59 2015 UTC,"Well, part of your pay could be seen as the price for simply being at your place of employment, but if they just need a warm body I couldn't imagine that being worth much more than minimum wage.  Beyond that your wage is in theory based on the value you provide. There are high and low value jobs in both office and retail environments. Moving fruit around isn't really that valuable of a skill, and neither is photocopying and stuffing envelopes.   I definitely agree that office jobs can be seen as more ""respectable"" than retail jobs, even if they are not much different in skill level. It is probably because offices give you the resources necessary to do higher value work and it is harder to ascertain what exactly you are doing."

ontario,3b7vyr,neomikiki,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:18:51 2015 UTC,"If you are hired as a permanent employee, they start you at $22/hr with annual increases and full benefits.   False. Whether you're seasonal or permanent doesn't really matter. You'll start, depending on the position, around $12 and progress through the pay scales as you accrue hours worked.  If you're doing the general roles around the warehouse (classed as ""assistants"") your pay tops out about $23 but that'll be after you've put in about 10,000 hours. Most people, even permanent, tend to begin on part time hours (25-32 roughly) and then progress to full time if a full time slot becomes available. It can take years though.  If you're in a position classified as a ""clerk"" you'll usually be a dollar or so ahead of the ""assistant"" scale and it tops out about $25 after similar hours accrued.  Either way, for many people, to get over the $20/hr mark takes 4 or 5 years or more. People can jump ahead with promotions or becoming supervisors. Supervisors have to be paid more than the people they regularly supervise...as you'd expect.  The benefits are pretty decent as you mentioned."

Hydro is 85 USD/MWh and nuclear is 96 USD/MWh. Wind is also a good option (80 USD/MWh) which is why Ontario is adding more wind farms, like the Wolfe Island farm."

No wind is generally not a great option unless your geography matches well for it. Though even then you ideally have some pump hydro next to it to optimized use. The majority of power in Ontario will continue to be hydro + nuclear for a long time.  The rerouting power from Quebec hydro to Ontario isn't a solve everything idea since (as you say) it is expensive to create those high voltage transmission lines, and frankly Quebec's max output is about on par to their peak consumption, so we wouldn't want to be relying on them for significant amounts of our power anyhow."

ontario,3b5yqd,classypterodactyl,2,Fri Jun 26 12:34:53 2015 UTC,Awesome :D I'm pretty sketchy about the moose situation honestly. But I've heard they're most active at dawn and dusk so hopefully by driving mostly during the day I won't have any issues. I'm super excited to see the superior coast that everybody raves about
ontario,3b5yqd,RamenNoodlezHair,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:09:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, please be careful about the moose. I almost hit two of them when I did the drive a couple of weeks ago, and it was at dawn too (kind of a reckless decision on my part but I had to be in TBay for noon that day). Just be very careful."
ontario,3b5yqd,_doreah,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:56:00 2015 UTC,"Generally true. However if the bugs are bad they will be out on the highways in broad daylight to escape them (same with deer, bears and coyotes/coywolves). Usually in day time you can see them from far enough away, but if they're trying to outrun bugs, they make be faster/less predictable. And don't underestimate the moose (and deer) at night either. I've nearly hit moose a number of times, the closest call was actually during the night. The second one was actually during the afternoon coming over a blind hill/curve when it stepped out. I found deer to be a massive issue around Sleeping Giant. They were just everywhere, jumping out and hanging on roads.  I've hit bears as well, at night. And all my deer close calls were at dusk. Hit a beaver too. It wrecked my car more than anything else I've hit, so be careful. Even a porcupine can mess you up.  Keep all that in mind. I often drive under the speed limit at night when it's moose country. But it sounds like you won't be driving in the dark anyway. Basically ALWAYS be careful and vigilant on those highways, don't get complacent just because it's daytime."

It opens at the top of each hour during the day (takes about 15 minutes) to let boats through. Just across the bridge, there is the 3 Cows and a Cone ice cream shop which has local Farquhar’s ice cream (edit: apparently no longer made by the local dairy, but made to their original recipes).

ontario,3b0lqw,briskt,2,Thu Jun 25 00:31:13 2015 UTC,"In an announcement Wednesday afternoon, Industry Canada detailed the spectrum transfers, saying Wind will acquire 26 new licences for spectrum as a result of the transactions – 16 licences from the Shaw spectrum and 10 licences from Mobilicity.  Rogers will keep two of the licences from Shaw and acquire some of Wind’s current spectrum. The advantage to Rogers is that as a result of the arrangement, it will gain more contiguous spectrum. That means the blocks of airwaves are located right next to each other and make it easier to deliver more bandwidth and faster speeds.  For Wind, gaining the new licences will make it possible for the company to begin to deploy LTE (long-term evolution or fourth-generation) service while it previously only had enough spectrum to operate a 3G network. The spectrum at issue in the all the transactions is all in the AWS-1 (advanced wireless services) frequency band.  “This new spectrum acquisition means Wind Mobile now has a 20-megahertz AWS-1 corridor from Victoria to Ottawa,” Wind chief executive officer Alek Krstajic said in a statement. “This will significantly improve our network performance from Ontario to the Pacific, enabling us to deploy new technology and accelerate the development of our LTE network and other services.”"

When the prime minister does it, it's called foreign relations.  We might not like what he's doing as a matter of political policy, but engaging in closer relations with the United States at his level is anything but illegal.  Having provincial cabinet ministers engaging in the same sorts of relationships, especially if it is not even sanctioned by the provincial cabinet would be much more problematic.

ontario,3ardys,WilliamOfOrange,7,Tue Jun 23 00:02:51 2015 UTC,"Teachers have already made the money they will be paid over the summer. In some boards it's given to them as a lump sum at the end of June, while in others it's spread evenly over the summer months. Either way, it allows the boards to generate a significant amount of interest on the funds they hold back.  But I get it, facts take a back seat to frustration and anger."
ontario,3ardys,RambleMan,-10,Tue Jun 23 00:09:08 2015 UTC,"No, they have not, at most it is spread over the entire year, and if the boards lock the teachers out they will not be paid for those summer months.  They are paid for those summer months as they are supposed to be completing lesson plans and etc in that time. Instead most use it as vacation time or time to have a second job and earn more money."
ontario,3ardys,iamateacherinontario,7,Tue Jun 23 00:20:34 2015 UTC,"This just isn't true.   They are paid for days they are teaching, PA/PD days and statutory holidays. Permanent teachers have a portion of the money they make on these days held back and then paid out in one of the ways I mentioned above. Temporary teachers (those covering another teacher who is off on a leave) do not get paid this way. They are paid for the number of days they actually work during a pay period, and then get laid off over the summer so are paid nothing."
ontario,3ardys,Cadaren99,5,Tue Jun 23 00:30:08 2015 UTC,"Unless Ontario is different than every other way teachers are paid in Canada, they are essentially 10-month employees who's pay is withheld to allow for year-round pay cheques. As was said earlier in this thread, the money has already been earned by the teachers that they are paid in the summer.  Teacher workload studies have also demonstrated consistently across Canada that teachers on average work I believe it's 7-days a week (if you add up the hours they put in) while being paid for 5. So, in essence, they're NOT paid for those summer hours which would be overtime that they've already worked.  I don't know about you, but I don't work if I'm not paid. I work 8:00 to 5:00 with an hour for lunch. I leave at 12:00, come back at 1:00 and am out the door at 5:00. I'll be damned if I'm going to work two extra days a week without pay."

You have to let us worsen your working conditions or it will harm the stuuuuuuudents!""), except that they're actually advocating for things that seriously harm students' learning experiences, like increasing class size or reducing the amount of time that teachers have to mark or plan.

ontario,3art24,kall-e,7,Tue Jun 23 12:05:30 2015 UTC,"If you're moving because french isn't great, then Ottawa is a terrible choice.  The biggest employer in Ottawa are the Federal and Provincial governments, and both of those employers want bilingual employees in Ottawa.  (lots of people will tell you otherwise, but those people are all bilingual and should stop pretending, I have friends and family that live in Ottawa, and the bilingual ones have good jobs, the pure Anglophones work in Tim Horton's and Petro Canada, etc.)  There's opportunity in Ontario but it depends on what your field is and where you're going.  GTA is the only part of the province with generally overall positive employment prospects, but the cost of living is second only to Vancouver.  Getting a family doctor outside of the GTA or Ottawa areas can be a challenge in Ontario as well, but it's not impossible.  There's a lot going on and a lot of industries in the province, but a lot of the best jobs are in shrinking industries like manufacturing (which aren't doing a lot of hiring since many factories have a long list of laid off employees waiting for an opportunity to come back).  I wouldn't come here and expect an easy job search.  Teaching, for example, is hard to get into unless you're bilingual or in the GTA or surrounding area.  The rest of the province doesn't have growing populations so school enrollments are down.  That also goes for childcare industry jobs and non-education work in school boards.  IT industry has decent work in Ontario, both in Ottawa and the golden horseshoe (QEW) regions, and really anywhere.  I live in Niagara and have a few friends with decent IT positions that don't put them dealing with idiots on the phone all day long. There's also no buying alcohol except the LCBO (equivalent of SAQ) and Beer Store; you can't get it in convenience stores etc.  Liquor laws are more prudish here than in Quebec.

In my office there are roughly 100 people, not all engineers/ technical and probably 5 people speak French fluently.  My husband never has to speak French, even when dealing with donations etc.  Unless your field of work is strictly gov't related or service related, you should be just as fine finding work here as you would be elsewhere in Ontario.  My advice would be to not let the French thing worry you too much.  Also, I'm not in the IT field, but I have heard mostly good things about the prospects here in Ottawa.

ontario,3any2t,Holdmylife,2,Mon Jun 22 18:34:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely.  It's why qualified that it had the best camp sites haha.  If you can get into the Georgian sub-campground at Killbear, it is still the best IMO.  It's the only place at Killbear still untouched by the ash borer.  The beach there is incredible with its own little shield-inlet.  It's tough to reserve there until after labour day weekend though."
ontario,3any2t,darrrrrren,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:39:37 2015 UTC,Never been but it's on the list. We often do our car camping at Agawa Bay at Lake Superior Provincial Park. You get pretty spoiled by the sites right on the beach. Is Killbear similar?
ontario,3any2t,Holdmylife,2,Mon Jun 22 18:51:44 2015 UTC,I can't compare as I've never camped on Lake superior but the beach at Georgian sub campground at Killbear is absolutely gorgeous...  I can't recommend any other campground within the park.

A couple of years ago, on this very subreddit, I mentioned how the people in the lower rungs were going to be killed by the policies of the current gov't.  As jobs become scarce the number of people chasing any one job increases, so a couple of things will happen (and are now actually happening).  First wage pressure will go away.  If I employ people whom I know won't quit because there is little else out there, why should I give them a raise except maybe CPI?  Second, quality of the workplace will decrease.  If you do quit, so what?  I have five CVs in my email so I'm ready to replace you.  In 1997 it was not uncommon to get two, sometimes three pay increases in a year.  Unemployment was low (for Ontario), and employers were scared the best employees would jump ship.  We are now in the total opposite world."

ontario,3aeydd,tdhanson,2,Fri Jun 19 16:05:33 2015 UTC,"Ontario LL here.  I can't believe how much ""wrong"" there is in response to your question in this thread.  Firstly, if your lease is still ongoing, giving 60 days notice doesn't matter a whit.  I think you are mixing it up with giving 60 days notice at the end of your lease which is perfectly fine.  Secondly - and in conjunction with the first point - since you can't end your tenancy early your two options are to discuss it with your landlord and hope that they will agree to terminate the tenancy early.  Likely this would have been a viable option since your unit seems desirable but since you gave an improper notice they likely took it the wrong way.  Your second option would have been to proceed to sublet your unit.  In this scenario you choose a replacement and the LL can only disallow it for ""reasonable"" reasons.  What are the reasonable reasons?  Well, the case history on that has been fairly consistent that if you can point out someone has the income to meet the rent and won't disturb others, they are likely suitable.  However, you need to realize there is a liability on your part since they are effectively paying you and you in turn are paying  the LL, so if they default it could come back on you (BTW, you can't increase the rent as some have tried to do in similar circumstance in the past).    If you want to try and get your money back you could make a claim at the Landlord and Tenant Board but the issue is that it takes some time to get hearings set up and you are moving out of town.  Also, going to the hearing and starting out by saying you gave improper notice isn't likely to lead to a desirable result.  In fact, there is a very real chance that you could be stuck with paying your LL the money they are out in the time it took to find a new tenant which is complicated a little bit because of the mixed messages you received and the renovation issue.  Ultimately I would engage your LL in conversation to see if they are willing to accommodate you.  Likely this will fail in which case it should be a lesson learned that there are consequences when you sign a legal document which is what a lease is."
ontario,3aeydd,headoverheals,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:09:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response. To clarify, how was my notice improper? I am month-to-month."
ontario,3aeydd,headoverheals,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:30:08 2015 UTC,"I said if your lease is still ongoing - maybe that should be clarified.  If your lease was a for a fixed term - say 1 year - and the year is past, or if the lease wasn't for a fixed term, then 60 days notice is perfectly valid.  If you gave notice on June 1st for your tenancy to end at the end of July you are golden.  If you are worried about your last months deposit, my suggestion would be to have put it in writing when you gave notice that you will to be paying July 1 in lieu of your last months deposit. If you didn't do that my suggestion would be to send your LL an email (don't tell them verbally) immediately stating this."
ontario,3aeydd,headoverheals,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:38:22 2015 UTC,"Yes I've done all of this - gave notice on June 1st for tenancy to end at end of July. My last months deposit (July) was already cashed when I moved in a few years ago. In an attempt to recover this, I stated in my letter of notice that I would be attempting to find a tenant for July 1st.  LL began accepting applications as of June 1st but on June 17th decided to deny all applications and renovate the unit in August, thus I have no opportunity to recover my last month's rent. But I feel I've been jerked around since they've entertained applicants for half of June and have verbally assured me that the unit would be rented for July 1st and not to worry blah blah blah. I understand verbal agreements mean little to nothing but am curious if the RTA has guidelines for this type of situation.  Do I have any case to file with the LTB given I've been taken for a bit of a ride. Can I try to assign the unit even after notice has been given etc. These are things I want to know - if there even are any options."
ontario,3aeydd,somecrazybroad,2,Sat Jun 20 04:21:36 2015 UTC,"I'm missing something - why don't you just not pay rent July 1st, vacate July 31st and call it even?"

It sucks they kinda screwed you around with trying to find another tenant, but you agreed when you signed your lease to give 60 days notice for leaving, thus you have to. If they wanted to subsidize you for your time spent helping find a new tenant, that would be another thing altogether IMO."

The landlord will be renting the place out as soon as you leave, he just decided to steal your money.  Your proper course of action was to not pay rent on June 1 if you intended to move out on July 1, since after all you had already paid the last month's rent when you moved in, so you had already paid for June.  You can file a complaint with the LTB.  You can sue in small claims.  You can forget it.  Pick."
ontario,3aeydd,jellicle,0,Fri Jun 19 16:50:24 2015 UTC,"You can file a complaint with the LTB. You can sue in small claims.   And you'll probably lose.  You need to give 60 days notice.   The landlord will be renting the place out as soon as you leave, he just decided to steal your money.   If they don't reimburse you for the month of July (which they don't need to do) then you still have legal possession of the apartment for that month.  If they move someone else in and you find out then they are trespassing.  Most landlords wouldn't try this as its very easy to get caught and face very severe charges.  If you actually think they are going to attempt it then just visit the apartment (or have a friend do it) halfway through the month."
ontario,3aeydd,Galestar,-1,Fri Jun 19 18:32:54 2015 UTC,"And yet you ignore the landlord's legal obligation under the RTA to find a replacement tenant.  It isn't at all clear the tenant would lose.

People do NOT understand what end of life actually entails when they say do everything.  At that age, it pretty much ALWAYS fails and some crazy stuff gets done to the patient.  It's pretty much the only area where I think paternalistic medicine still has a place.  However, the clear error here is that there was very poor communication.  Medical futility is a valid reason to not do resuscitation, but that needs to be clearly communicated.  I also have to suspect she is 'modifying' what actually happened since if the patient was having a cardiac arrest he would not be breathing.  And if he was having difficulty breathing, a DNR does not preclude helping the patient, there's still lots of things that can be done.  If they didn't, then there actually is an error there."

Personally I think the most interesting, if slightly disingenuous, thing I've ever heard him participate in was his interview on the Canadaland podcast.  I think he'd be a bit of fun to go for a beer with, but in the interest of the country it's probably best if we keep him away from anything approaching serious journalism.  For the most part the content he creates is simply partisan hackery, which is a shame because I bet you I'm actually more disappointed in Wynne than he is.  He's just posturing, I had higher expectations from her.  As far as this particular story goes, I feel like I'm in /r/AskHistorians and need to request that he supplies references for everything he says, he's on the record having falsified any number of ""facts"" either intentionally or, I suspect, because he'a caught up in his own hot air to the point that he can't tell the difference.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/mackay-backs-off-from-comments-on-ontario-minister-michael-chan/article25033086/   The Globe and Mail has reported that CSIS cautioned Ontario in 2010 about Mr. Chan’s conduct, warning that the minister had an unusually close rapport with China’s Toronto consulate. The spy agency was never investigating the minister, nor was the minister ever suspected of a crime.   Do you really think that MacKay or the Ontario government would try to cover up the fact that a cabinet minister has gone full Manchurian Candidate on us?  I'm no fan of the Chinese government, but I don't really see how having a minister develop strong relationship with the consulate is a problem.  The innuendo that somehow he's a) working for China, and b) that this innately in opposition to serving the interests of Ontario is silly.  Government ministers routinely develop close relationships with diplomats from major economic partner nations.  So until there's more than a CSIS innuendo I'm not interested."

Was the heat in the house kept on?  Unfortunately for these people their Broker gave them poor advice.  This claim will almost certainly come out of the Broker's Errors and Omissions insurance.

ontario,3a7gus,BarrieMum,4,Wed Jun 17 20:47:34 2015 UTC,"As usual the bullying began at a young age in the school yard.  The problem of bullying will never be solved as long as it is tolerated at school.  I can't tell you how many times I witnessed bullying and other issues where the teachers literally turned their backs and pretended they didn't see or hear what was happening.  When even teachers, who are supposed to care about the well being of children in their care, feel that slurping their Timmies is more important than protecting a child you know we have problems that will not be solved any time soon."
ontario,3a7gus,Moos_Mumsy,8,Wed Jun 17 22:37:48 2015 UTC,"Teachers are always scapegoated when things like this happen but in truth bullying is an extremely difficult problem. Thanks for the completely unhelpful generalization, by the way - the vast majority of teachers care deeply about the emotional well being of their students.  I will tell you one thing with certainty, at the school that I work at bullying is dealt with seriously whenever possible (bullies are identified, counselled in the guidance department and monitored)  At a certain point it gets difficult because people are people. What rolls off the back of one person becomes world shattering to another.  I'm not victim-blaming here but there is a certain amount of conformity that is expected in society - we all know this. When students refuse to or are unable to moderate their persona sometimes they will attract bullying. This is very hard to manage in a building full of teenagers with limited resources. Some ""unpopular"" students seek attention again and again from more popular students and the resulting interactions look a lot like bullying as well.  What happened to this boy was a tragedy and I hope that we figure out how to prevent these sort of situations."
ontario,3a7gus,iamateacherinontario,-3,Thu Jun 18 12:03:38 2015 UTC,"I have 2 children who are just into adulthood.  Between them (12 years of school each) they would have had at least 100 teachers.  Plus all the other teachers in the schools.  Over that time I can think of maybe 10 who ""cared deeply"".  There were a handful who were OK and tried from time to time and then there were the rest.  The majority put in minimum effort to adhere to contractual obligations and did nothing beyond that.  They absolutely and clearly did not give a tinkers damn about their students.  They cared about their paycheques, breaks, lunches and time off.  If there's a school board where the teachers actually care it's no where near central Ontario.  As for dealing with high school bullies, they should not have arrived in high school thinking it was OK.  When the teachers in the primary grades turned their backs, they learned that bullying is acceptable at school.  Of course the parents are also to blame but it's a symbiotic relationship that could be broken if one of the entities were to so choose."
ontario,3a7gus,Moos_Mumsy,2,Thu Jun 18 13:13:53 2015 UTC,Sometimes the teacher getting involved too early on can cause bullying to be worse. It's a fine line as sometimes mild bullying (more like teasing)  works it way out.

Is there something we can do differently to empower those being bullied to just ignore potential sources of harm and focus on the positives in their lives.    We'll never be able to get rid of all the assholes out there, but we should be able to remove the impact they can have.  It's not so much ""sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me"" as much as it is ""why would I give a shit what you have to say to begin with"".  Bullies want an audience, the worse thing we can do is give them that."
ontario,3a7gus,SamgeeHD,8,Thu Jun 18 20:49:01 2015 UTC,"He was bullied from grade 1 all through high school, and had some fairly traumatic family experiences during that time. I've suffered from depression and had suicidal thoughts without ever being bullied in any significant way. I can completely understand how being consistently bullied over the course of 11 years would eventually get internalized whether you like it or not. Especially as the article and the other reply states, with social media there literally can be no escape other then to not participate. But not participating at all in social media can further isolate him from his friends, and provide more fodder for the bullies.   I guess my point is, the issue isn't that negativity affects these kids. I believe prolonged extreme negativity like this during the formative years of your life would have a profound impact on the psyche of anyone. I think it would take sociopathic tendencies to be able to withstand that unaffected.  That's not to say I think I know what the actual problem is. Though to me it seemed as though not enough people (teachers, principals) took it seriously enough. And lots of kids that age don't realize the impact that they are having on another human being. I think all parents should talk with their kids about bullying and the consequences it can have. I say all because, lots of parents are probably completely unaware of the way their kids behave towards certain people. Because in truth they might be generally nice pleasant people to nearly all the people in their lives, except for that one guy. Especially once someone has been established as the kid that gets bullied, in certain environments it can become self-perpetuating. Other kids bully to make themselves fit in and avoid being the one bullied themselves.  TL;DR Sorry about the rant. I just felt that the issue isn't that kids aren't impervious to negativity. Few adults are. Given the emotional immaturity and insecurity that lots of kids have at that age, I can see how this can get into a kids head and stick. It's very sad."
ontario,3a7gus,nanosci,5,Wed Jun 17 22:23:09 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is primarily social media.

ontario,3a7gus,factsbotherme,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:32:46 2015 UTC,"I agree there is no one solution.   Parents need to take more accountability for their kids actions. Educate them on how their words can hurt others (or land them with charges).   Schools need to get involved. They are educating - lots of anti-bullying messaging but they aren't dealing with the cases harsh enough. When families are moving to change schools - the issues aren't being dealt with properly.  This is also a great opportunity for the police to step up. Have them come in to the school and talk about the charges they can face whether it is harassment, child porn for sharing photos etc. And press charges when appropriate.  And we need to do more to help those being bullied. Bullies target those who will take it. We need to empower those being bullied with tactics to help them deal with the situation. These tactics could include counseling, verbal response training and also physical training. Confidence is a wonderful thing."

ETFO did release statements they had not tabled that demand at all. Not sure if this is poor research on the authors' part or if the Toronto Star article is clearly wrong.  Theres a whole discussion on that and their article very clearly indicates ETFO had released a statement.

Burlington - same as Vaughn, grew rapidly and now housing prices keep going up.   Oakville - see Vaughn and Burlington  Mississauga - huge city that is sprawl and more.

The Hamilton clean up he was talking about is, more local businesses are popping up in the downtown core. A lot of bigger companies are also moving into the area. Rogers just bought out 2 local cable companies in the Hamilton Mountain. Houses in the mountain area are increasing in value. It's basically a city on the rise."

That you can comfortably retire at 55.   Pay free for three years? I know plenty of people who have taking big pay cuts because they've had to find new jobs.

ontario,3a4dh7,untitleddocument37,2,Wed Jun 17 19:43:20 2015 UTC,"The article even states that ETFO is not asking for salary increases in the current bargaining.   “I have said all along that the current discussions are not about money,” president Sam Hammond said in a written release. “ETFO has not tabled a formal monetary position at the central bargaining table. Instead we have focused on non-monetary issues such as class size, fair and transparent hiring practices, teacher professionalism and other issues” such as more supports for special needs students.   Just for a minute let's pretend that it is 3% per year over the next three years plus cost of living increase. Let's do a little math   $3,200,000,000 ÷ 3 years = $1,066,666,667 per year   There are approx 76,000 teachers in the ETFO union.   $1,066,666,667 ÷ 76,000 = #14035.09 per person per year   DO YOU REALLY THINK THEY WILL BE GETTING THAT MUCH OF A RAISE? No, of course not. The school board is just throwing big numbers around to try to make ETFO look bad. As we already established above the real problems are the non-monetary issues such as class sizes."

ontario,3a4dh7,untitleddocument37,-1,Wed Jun 17 13:08:25 2015 UTC,That's exactly my point. I always remember having 20-30 people. I'm not aware that this has changed any.

ontario,3a4dh7,sonofamitch10,0,Wed Jun 17 14:19:32 2015 UTC,"The thing about class sizes is they change with times.  A new community will have a boom of K5 students ... then grade 1 ... then grade 2 ... as they age.  Over time people move, retire,etc whatever over a 30 year period enrollment will cycle/etc.  Unless teachers are willing to relocate multiple times in their careers they should just shut the fuck up about the occasional large class size."

I'm all for hiring more teachers so we can implement these smaller class sizes and actually focus on what matters : the kids education.   Unfortunately, reality comes into play and teachers aren't free. Will they take a proportional pay compensation cut for these class sizes? I didn't think so."
ontario,3a4dh7,sonofamitch10,-1,Wed Jun 17 14:23:05 2015 UTC,Sure one-on-one might be super duper but it's just not practical.  As long as elementary classes don't stray too much into 30 too long... I don't see the problem.  If a class is >30 students for say 5+ years running then it's obvious that another class might be necessary.  But just because you have 34 students this year doesn't mean you'll have 34+ next year.  It's not like kids born in the 2000s are a different species.  If they're not paying attention/etc in school look at the fucking parents who flake off any sense of trying to raise their kids.

At say 70K/yr 3% is 2100 * 3 years is 6300$ + benefits + hiring new staff.    * 76K teachers is 478M dollars which isn't trivial (that increase (not salaries themselves) represents 4% of our deficit).  They also didn't literally say 3.2B == salaries... they said the demands total 3.2B.
ontario,3a4dh7,untitleddocument37,7,Wed Jun 17 12:37:00 2015 UTC,"They're asking for more than just % though there is increased prep time and other scheduling changes that would involve hiring more staff.

On top of that, that doesn't even include the very lucrative pension plan which I'm told you have to essentially add another 10% on top to get a good feel for it."

ontario,3a4dh7,Hloden,2,Thu Jun 18 00:12:21 2015 UTC,"According to that chart a category A teacher at 1 starts at 44k, not 55k  Edit infact Any teacher in Step 0-4 Category A1-A2 makes sub-55k a year. Only Category 4 teachers make 55k+ off the bat.  Ive been gaming, so I havent had a chance to do a proper evaluation of the chart you posted.  So there are 53 pay grades on this chart.    13 of those pay grades are sub 55k (basically anything between 44k-54k). There are 5 Pay grades between 55k - 57k There are 10 Pay grades between 58-64k (including those two pay grades that are 300 over 61k)   Twenty-eight of fifty four of those pay grades are probably within what I would say is -/+20% of the average teachers pay, according to the Payscale website. Keep in mind there are only 53 pay grades, which means roughly 52% of this payscale chart makes within 20% of the median teacher wage in Ontario.  Also, this chart does not show how many teachers work within each pay-grade. So all we can take from this is that 48% of the teachers payscale is between 44k a year and 61.5k a year."
ontario,3a4dh7,Lord_Canada,2,Thu Jun 18 00:56:34 2015 UTC,"Those are a lot of assumptions, most of which are wrong.  From this site:  http://qeco.on.ca/?page_id=276  Category A:  No university degree Category A1:  Undergrad degree Category A2:  Undergrad degree w/ honours Category A3:  Undergrad degree w/ honours and specialist training (teachers college) Category A4:  Undergrad degree w/ honours, first class standing, and specialist training (teachers college)  All new teachers are at least Category A3, and many are Category A4.  It is also relatively easy to bump up to A4, since it requires just a few courses to do so.  The ""steps"" listed in that PDF are years of experience.  So a teacher with 10 years of experience, will almost certainly be A4, Step 10.  It isn't an evenly distributed chart by any means."
ontario,3a4dh7,Hloden,5,Thu Jun 18 02:41:24 2015 UTC,"Specialist Training is not Teacher's College. Specialist Training is a type of Additional Qualification you can take. Honestly, this really only removes category A and possibly A1 from my findings.  Category A2 - ""An acceptable three year undergraduate university degree plus Part I and Part II of a three-part Specialist qualification which is additional to the degree and basic teacher training.""  Category A2 is a standard out of University Teacher.  So we can remove 2 of the payscale slots, but that still means 26 payscale slots are relevant to the discussion.  Edit: Honestly the only reason I ended up in this discussion was because I was proving the TStar article OP posted was complete clickbait. We also have to remember that this is TDSB, possibly one of the hardest school boards to work in (even I wont work in TDSB and I dont even have a job, id rather wait).  I think theirs a good reason those teachers are paid those wages. Toronto is an expensive city to live in or even near and those kids are among the hardest group to teach. Ive done 2 practicums in TDSB and I wouldnt recommend it to anyone but the teachers who want a really challenging job.  Edit 2: I found the salary grid for 2008 for Peel Region, which shows much lower wages than TDSB http://www.etfopeel.com/files/memberSecure/Peel%20ETFO%20Collective%20Agreement%202008-2012.pdf  Its on Page 57-58. I am really sorry for posting this, Peel has the whole negotiation document. Category A4 in Peel makes 6k less than TDSB. Although it catches up in 2011."

ontario,3a4dh7,untitleddocument37,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:28:07 2015 UTC,"I think putting the average Canadian Salary within 1000 dollars of the Teacher salary actually makes your original point moot. Its ridiculous to make a statement to try and discredit teacher salary when your proven that teachers make within 1k of the Median salary.  Ontop of the fact OPs link is still clickbait bullshit, the actually wage difference between the average Canadian and a teacher in percentage is 2%.  As well, Average Canadian seems to include part time jobs, as a 20k  Food Services job is part time. So the Wokopolis figure does include part time services, meaning that if the payscale data represents supply teachers, your other point is moot."

They wanted me to stay until the posted schedule was done, which was another week. I was fine with that, although would have liked to have been done sooner.   Since you're so new to the job, it's probably more beneficial to the company for you to just finish off the day/week/schedule/whatever for them and be done.   If you don't have an HR person, just go speak with whomever you would be handing in your resignation to. If you don't want to work there another day, then don't.

ontario,39watd,lwh,28,Mon Jun 15 09:14:56 2015 UTC,The article doesn't touch on it. But I assume a major reason for the shift to low wage work is a result of the steep decline in the manufacturing sector. The service sector has largely taken it's place. But it's an extremely poor substitute in terms of quality of life.
ontario,39watd,Thermal--Shock,20,Mon Jun 15 09:49:18 2015 UTC,"That is where I am at on this,  I think it also produces less viable full time spin off jobs.  When you have a factory with 2 shifts running you have an HR department,  you have shipping and receiving clerks, you have logistics and all host of other well paid spin off jobs.  Food services and retail have traditionally been part time, chaotically scheduled and low paying jobs.  Shifting up the wage is fine and all but it doesn't solve the real problem that we don't need anywhere near the number of people we have currently.  Unionizing these jobs or making them careers simply reduces the number of these jobs available and makes entering the workforce more difficult.  These jobs have traditionally been starter jobs that a person uses to give them basic workplace skills that they then use along with education to move to a higher tier of job that pays more and offers them the ability to save for a home or to raise a family."
ontario,39watd,dittomuch,6,Mon Jun 15 10:51:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If you take into account the overall education level skyrocketing, you'll probably see that roughly the same percentage of the highest-educated folks are making a decent living. What's happening is people that aren't getting the education, instead of getting decentish manufacturing jobs, they're getting service industry jobs. Making a career out of job that was never meant to be a career is just...a bad idea."

Manufacturing employer here. This isn't true. Outsourcing is a complicated decision. There are definite drawbacks that have to be weighed against the drawbacks of Ontario.  One problem with Ontario is that it is difficult to fire long-term employees if you don't have a written employment contract. The written law establishes severance payout minimums, but common law governs what is actually customary. This means that if you fire someone, lawyers get involved... and that's costly, and benefits only the lawyers. This strongly discourages the hiring of long-term employees, especially if you can let someone else deal with it (i.e., outsourcer).  The Liberals are also fond of worthy-sounding initiatives that sound good but result in nothing but a steaming pile of ... paperwork ... for employers (and employees).

ontario,39ydl7,drpgq,8,Wed Jun 17 04:29:56 2015 UTC,"Ontario's Hydro has been mismanaged for years.  We have too much production when we don't need it and not enough when we do need it.    This results in Ontario needing to sell off production for next to nothing in order to ensure we don't have too much production to outpace demand.  Then when we aren't producing enough we need to buy power for considerably more than it would cost to produce it.    Then we get to the problems with the Hydro microFIT program (Ontario's solar re seller program).  In an attempt to promote greener power generation the power generated by individuals and businesses can be sold to the grid for a profit.  This sounds great for the people that are selling the power, but not so great for the ones paying for their power because they end up paying the huge difference in price.  MicroFIT partners can earn up to 54.9c a kWh, the average consumer pays between 8 and 16.1c a kWh.  So now that we know why microFIT is a problem we also need to look at how it's become a serious problem.  Enterprising individuals looked at those price differences and the possible profit margin and decided they wanted to start companies that would lease/finance solar systems to people that have good places to put them. They pay the person a percentage of the profits they make (minus the leasing/financing fees) and pocket the rest.  So the program that first started as a way for people to become more independent with their power generation turned into a collection of companies raking in huge profits off of Ontario consumers."
ontario,39ydl7,RDBRULZ,3,Mon Jun 15 20:55:19 2015 UTC,"The microFIT and FIT program has added very little to the current price of hydro.  The added price from the FIT program has been calculated to only be about 2-3c per kWh.  The initial price was correct and then the government waited to long to adjust it.  It is now at a good price at 34.4 and on the way toward market price. Also the average price in Ontario's is more like 22-26 cents per kWh.  You need to look at your bill and add in the debt retirement charge and delivery charge to get the real price. The reason the debt retirement charge is so high is because no nuclear plant has been any where close to on budget for any kind of construction.  The closest cost estimate to true cost for a nuke was I believe 87% overrun and others have been much higher.  When the cost is in the billions that adds up.  Also lots of government's have added more things to the debt that don't have any right being there.  It has been so high for so long people haven't noticed when they dump a couple extra hundred million on it.  Also the whole electrical infrastructure has been neglected over the 80s and 90s and has only recently been  getting major upgrades needed. And the time of day meters are also another whole load of crap.  They have been reviewed and not shown to add any positive value to the system.  I'm on my phone but can add links to stats if you need any or think I'm talking shit, when I get home."

ontario,39ydl7,stillrs,0,Tue Jun 16 23:29:17 2015 UTC,We already have peaking plants.  Solar and wind allows them to idle some of the time.  They are still needed for when a nuke or two goes down.
ontario,39ydl7,4ray,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:27:55 2015 UTC,"Nope. Peaking plants are for short term production, not for nuke outages. Solar and wind needs to be 100 percent backed up by other forms of production. Although we would have some peaking plants without solar and wind, we require more with the FIT program. That cost is never taken into consideration when the cost increase for FIT is quoted. Even when solar and wind is going we have to pay for the peaking plants to idle and pay for it as part of the global adjustment."

They have never been anywhere close to accurate in their cost estimates for nukes in Ontario. Nuclear power is a key part of our power now and a cleaner alternative that  coal or natural gas.  But it isn't cheap in this province.  That is also why the latest decision to build / refurbish Pickering (I think) needs to have its price looked at through the lens of past over runs.

ontario,39ydl7,4ray,2,Wed Jun 17 20:20:27 2015 UTC,"There's a question that can have a short answer (""because they can"" is in one sense absolutely correct) or a very long one. By ""high"" I expect what is meant is higher - not why they were high a decade ago. If so, realize the debt retirement charge has never changed so weak thinkers throwing nonsense like that out should be disregarded. Similarly, Ontario Hydro had a debt near $40 billion, but it was being managed. Manitoba Hydro has a debt of about $11 billion (it's production is about 1/4 of Ontario's) and Hydro Quebec's near $44.5 billion - both those province's have far cheaper electricity than Ontario. The debt retirement charge exists stil ""because they can"". The two big drivers of price increases in Ontario over the past decade are: 1. the global adjustment mechanism introduced in 2005, which gave the government a way to push the costs of political project spending onto ratepayers, and 2. the green energy act of 2009 (the ultimate political project).  There are periodic bill increases impacted by nuclear costs, sometimes driven by lucrative pension schemes (not uncommon in the public sector), and once by refurbishment work being completed at Bruce Power, but the day after day after day increases are due to the GEA and the global adjustment, both of which cause costs far in excess of the direct payments involved to power producers."

ontario,39vgs3,blackvariant,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:28:47 2015 UTC,"You've got some reading to do before you start lecturing others.   ...alcohol can grab and hold more water than straight gasoline. If the water concentration gets high enough, the alcohol and water will drop out of suspension, turning the fuel into a globby mess that your car's engine can't use. And it can happen at any stage of the transport, storage and usage process -- even getting worse as it goes along. In short, ethanol increases the chances that your car will be damaged trying to process and burn contaminated gasoline.   and   Many older fuel system components weren't designed to resist alcohol's corrosive properties, and as ethanol travels through the system it can cause considerable damage.   and   A 2012 study by Auto Alliance showed that some cars (model years 2001 to 2009) showed internal engine damage as the result of using an ethanol fuel blend. Damage to the valves and valve seats was evident in some of the cars tested. One of the 16 cars in the Auto Alliance study failed emissions compliance standards, which means it emitted more pollution than allowed by the EPA. The study also showed that cars running on E15 take a hit on gas mileage -- so they require more fuel to travel the same distance, which counteracts the benefits of diluting it in the first place.   http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/alternative-fuels/ethanol-damage-engine.htm"

ontario,39tack,Coal_Power,2,Sun Jun 14 15:46:45 2015 UTC,"What is the problem with cap-and-trade?  A major problem with cap-and-trade is “carbon leaking.” The Kyoto Protocol exempts developing nations from the carbon cap-and-trade requirements.  This seems fair since the developing and underdeveloped countries will have to burn a lot of fuel to improve the standard of living and infrastructure within their borders.  However, if a developing nation uses the carbon emission cap exemption to produce products at a lower cost for export to Canada where the production costs will be higher because of the carbon cap-and-trade, this could negatively affect Canadian industries that are exposed to international competition.  Some companies will have to shut down, while others may move to carbon cap exempt jurisdictions. With a carbon tax, the problem of carbon leaking can be addressed with a border adjustment tax.      One side-effect of the emission quantity regulating system that is not being talked about in the context of carbon cap-and-trade but has proven to be a problem in the case of dairy product quota or taxi quota is the economic rent seeking (profit) by the quota holders to the extent that it is creating barrier to entry and giving the quota holders monopoly power.   The monopoly power and the associated inefficiencies will develop in industries that are energy intensive but are immune from international competition. Thus, to prevent cap-and-trade induced carbon leakage problem as well as the monopoly power problem, it is much more efficient and economical to use carbon tax as the tool for eliminating CO2 emission negative externality and stay away from carbon cap-and-trade regulation."

The Cyprus Lake trail is pretty nice for novice hikers. The Bruce Trail is mere walking minutes away for anyone who might enjoy a more difficult terrain. My SO and I go usually every year, we spent 13 days 12 nights there about 2 years ago, easily one of the best camping experiences of my life. We can't wait to go back.   While in the area be sure to check out Singing Sands Beach, shallow warm waters and lots of sandy beach. There is also 2 looping beach focused trails.   I hope your visit is a phenomenal one. I've had a great time every opportunity I've had to explore the area."

ontario,39lbbk,Sockmonkee,8,Sun Jun 14 01:36:57 2015 UTC,"IANAL, but I thought one of the problems with quotas from a legal point-of-view is that they undermine the police officer's credibility in court?    If you're fighting a ticket in court, the police officer's testimony will always weigh higher than yours because they are deemed to be impartial with no motivation for lying.  If the police officer has a quota and faces work repercussions for not handing out tickets, then his testimony is just as suspect as your own.  At any rate, the whole system is fucked.  The only thing more frustrating than getting a ticket in the first place, is getting one and having the officer encourage you to fight it so they can talk to the crown about reducing the charge.  It makes it clear that this is  a game being played so that the police officer meets their obligations but also virtually guarantees paid overtime for court appearances.  If you're willing to talk to the crown about reducing the charge, then howabout ya just reduce it right now on the ticket?"

Convictions aren't a metric for officers, only tickets written and believe me, Officers don't struggle for legitimate charges to lay if they're looking. Drive to your favourite spot, and spend two hours doing seat belts, handheld devices, and stop signs all in one location.    guarantees paid overtime for court appearances.   Very few jurisdictions actually do paid overtime, they simply arrange for officers to work a day shift the day it is scheduled and call the officer in as needed.    If you're willing to talk to the crown about reducing the charge, then howabout ya just reduce it right now on the ticket?   Often times they can't, there are a huge number of offences that can't be put on a ticket, like ""Leave roadway not in safety"" about the only charge that truly fits a single vehicle accident. So they have to charge Careless Driving, the only ticket that has Leave Roadway Not in Safety as a lesser and included offence."

ontario,39lbbk,untitleddocument37,3,Fri Jun 12 17:54:05 2015 UTC,"The problem is would you rather cops be out patrolling or out trying to catch people doing 80 in a 60?  In reality speeders do cause problems and are breaking the law.  It's the ""this rock on my lawn prevents lion attacks"" scenario though.  If cops are visible out and about crime goes down.  From a suits point of view if arrests go down (who cares why) that means they're not ""busy enough""  So they send cops out to get the low hanging fruit which is traffic offenses.  It's like working IT.  If everything is working peachy they don't need you anymore.  It's when they cut your staff/services that then the next crisis becomes worse."
ontario,39lbbk,EngSciGuy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:55:01 2015 UTC,I don't follow the comparison. 'Hours on patrol' could certainly be a valid metric. Metrics on reactionary actions don't follow unless weighted against the total number of scenarios warranting said reactionary action.
ontario,39lbbk,untitleddocument37,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:08:01 2015 UTC,"The argument is they don't value hours on patrol.  They value results they care about (# of arrests).  They assume if you were out for a 10 hour shift and didn't arrest anyone then you weren't working.  It's like managers that value Lines of Code in software ... e.g. if you fixed a serious bug and removed 10  LoC today you had an ""unproductive"" day to many 80s-90s software managers.  Basically, it's a problem of resolution.  If you try to reduce a multi-dimensional issue to a single scalar you lack any sort of coherence.   If I judge a car salesman by the number of car doors he sold today I probably wouldn't catch the # of 2 door sports cars he was selling.  If I judge a doctor by the amount of stitches they used, etc...  The reality is cops should be busting people for driving offenses all the time.

This guaranteed income program would replace federal benefits for elderly persons and children, as well as Employment Insurance benefits for the unemployed. Subtracting these savings, the net cost of their scheme was calculated as $161.7 billion in 1999 dollars (or $200.3 billion in 2009 dollars).  They calculated the cost of a scheme that, in 1999, would pay the very modest income of $7,000 per year to persons age 65 and over, $5,000 to persons aged 21 to 64, $3,000 to persons under 21 (paid to the primary caregiver), and an additional $5,000 paid to each household, to be divided equally among adult members of the household.

It is also worth considering that such programs could remove aspects such as minimum wage.

ontario,39mv9r,biggerthanthegov,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:40:59 2015 UTC,"Typically the article contains no real mention of how this type of program will be paid for.    Higher taxation on the rich.    one more isn't going to cure poverty.    Some have suggested that 3000 USD for the poorest Americans would cut the poverty rate in half.   http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/10/how-to-cut-the-poverty-rate-in-half-its-easy/280971/   The only thing that has ever effectively cured poverty is a job and throughout history the only model that consistently provides jobs is capitalism.    And we're at the point where it has been suggested that automation is going to destroy more jobs than it creates. This trend will continue. A lot of people are behind on this, and haven't been paying attention. A universal basic income can work as a means of reducing or eliminating the economic impact of these jobs vanishing.   http://www.businessinsider.com/technology-is-destroying-jobs-and-it-could-spur-a-global-crisis-2015-6  Right now almost all the benefits of automation and improvements go to the wealthy. This system is ultimately unsustainable.  Capitalism works, but it inherently moves wealth upwards."

ontario,39l2xd,KevZero,6,Fri Jun 12 14:05:19 2015 UTC,"I went through something very similar to the man in the article. I was going through crippling depression, unable to leave the house unless absolutely necessary. To say you are put through an obstacle course to apply for ODSP is an understatement. I'm not claiming the process should be easy, but it's deliberately obfuscated to the point of lunacy.  Even during the best of times, negotiating the ODSP process can be a nightmare. I was going through the worst of times, and my ability to accomplish even simple, everyday tasks was extremely limited. Getting through the ODSP process was impossible for me on my own.  I went through every government social program I could find. I tried legal aid, and was told ""we won't help you"". When I asked if they could recommend someone who could, they said, ""No"". Flat out. The people I spoke to claimed they maintained no contacts or associations with any other similar agencies.  I went through about six months of runaround and rigamarole, bounced from one apathetic, uncaring agency to the next. The truth was simple and obvious: I was metaphorically drowning, and no one cared.  ODSP rejected my claim outright. I tried to appeal, but the process was confusing and difficult and I couldn't wrap my head around even filling out basic forms. Every time I asked for help from ODSP, OW, or other agencies I was greeted with blank stares and general apathy. During a time in my life when I needed help the most, I was consistently rejected and ignored.  It all worked out for me in the end, luckily for me. I have a good friend who is a volunteer adviser at Advocacy Hamilton. We had met for coffee one day just to chat and catch up when I told her the difficulties I was having. She put me in touch with Hamilton Justice, an organization that, amongst other things, provides legal assistance to those in need.  I had one meeting at Hamilton Justice. My lawyer had me sign a few simple forms authorizing the release of my medical records. They handled the paperwork and my appeal process, and I didn't have to even attend any of the meetings.  Basically, once ODSP found out I had a lawyer representing me, I immediately went from ""ineligible"" to ""eligible"" for ODSP. Nothing had changed about me, or my condition, or my medical records. The only thing that changed was that I had a lawyer who was willing to fight for me. That was what was required to motivate ODSP to do the right thing.  The one question my experience left me with was this: If an organization like Hamilton Justice existed that was willing to help me, why is it that no one in any government office seems to have heard about it?  ODSP, OW, etc. are more than likely aware of the existence of this organization. I don't like to be paranoid, but it seems to me like they deliberately don't share this information with applicants because they know that they will help people get ODSP. Not only do these programs not want to help, they don't even want to tell you who will."

The social workers are useless sadists who treat you like a deranged Ebola patient. They don’t answer phone calls, emails, and hide behind busy schedules so seeing one is almost impossible. My current worker doesn’t even answer email. He “doesn’t do email.” He also doesn’t do phones. If I want to see him I have to show up at his office between 3-4pm where he might have a “free hour.”  He wears sandals and Hawaiian shirts to work, and takes personal phone calls during our meetings. He parrots the lines the computer tells him to, and then ignores my answers. I get $656/month, but I’m only allowed to spend $376 on rent. I tell him Ontario Works doesn’t pay enough to rent an apartment, he says “That’s the way it is, and we all have to deal with it.” Okay thanks.   I’ve been suspended from Ontario Works at least seven times for various reasons, usually failing to file a form which I was either never told to file, or a form I filed and they lost. That’s when I think about going on a rampage. I think about how if I went to jail I’d get shelter, food, security, and education opportunities. Zero disposable income, inability to travel, the similarities go on and on.  What I’ve realized over the years is the workers are not there to help you. They do not care about you. Their job is to remove you from the system. I once told a worker I was in dire straits and being evicted. My landlord had sold my building and I had to move. I couldn’t find a new place because everything was too expensive, and nobody wants to rent a room to somebody on welfare. Especially somebody in their 30s. My worker sent me a list of homeless shelters and suspended my file.   Now I live with my parents in the middle of nowhere. My parents take $376/month rent and I keep $280. $60 pays my phone bill, $10 bucks is eaten up in bank fees, and I’m left with about $210/month.  Okay, so how am I supposed to find a job? I live outside the city. I don’t have a car. It’s like I’m stranded on island. “Well that’s the problem alright,” says my social worker.  I tell people Ontario Works should be replaced in favor of a basic income or guaranteed minimum income system. I explain to them how social workers are practically useless, the workshops are useless, and I’d be better off if the province just gave me more money.  They stare at me like I’m a deranged Ebola patient."

I can't speak to others with various disadvantages when socially dealing with a case worker. I'm on OW right now and I'm hoping to get a full time job this month. OW will provide $500 start up money, plus maybe $100+ more depending on expenses. I'm working with the 'plusses' of OW (""HEY! You! Get a job now!""). In terms of the concept of 'social welfare', well, OW doesn't offer a lot for that.

I'm not detracting from the points made, just going to share my story - we were on OW for a few months because I was too pregnant to work anymore and my husband unexpectedly lost his job. It was a scary time - we were blowing through our savings just to pay basic bills and we had no idea how we were going to recover, let alone thrive.  Our caseworker was amazing. He sat with us and did an in-depth interview and got us evey last penny he could. When my husband found a job, the caseworker made sure we still had medical coverage for the 3 month probation before our benefits kicked in.   Yeah, we had to be very careful with money those few months and live on the bare minimum and we had to cut off any unnecessary services (cable, unlimited internet) but OW kept a roof over our heads and food in our bellies. I don't know what we would have done or how we would have survived otherwise."

Vezina told the court that Muckuck resisted arrest, and when he was holding her at arm's length in front of the police car, she kicked him in the groin.

ontario,39gdo4,onerandomday,13,Thu Jun 11 17:35:30 2015 UTC,"Another big issue for ER/Hospital in general is ALC - alternate level of care.

I just don't understand how filling out a fucking report card is not considered part of their ""job"".

No additional time is set aside by the ministry to do report cards, which, seems wrong IMHO. So while I do not see this job action as being legal, I understand why they should do it. The ministry needs to re-hash the curriculum and set aside the needed time for teachers to do their job properly."
ontario,39cive,onerandomday,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:25:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone is arguing that report cards aren't one of the duties of the teacher, just that they don't need to be completed using the board software or containing comments.  If you look at the Growing Success document (which has replaced the guide listed in the section of the regulation you posted) you'll notice that what students are to be assessed on, and how is explained in very specific detail, whereas relatively little is said about actual comments on report cards. This is the section I found that seems to deal with comments in particular:   Space is provided on all progress report cards and provincial report cards from Grade 1 to Grade 12 for teachers to make anecdotal comments about students’ achievement of curriculum expectations or, in the case of the Elementary Progress Report Cards, progress towards achievement of the expectations. In writing anecdotal comments, teachers should focus on what students have learned, describe significant strengths, and identify next steps for improvement. Teachers should strive to use language that parents will understand and should avoid language that simply repeats the wordings of the curriculum expectations or the achievement chart. When appropriate, teachers may make reference to particular strands. The comments should describe in overall terms what students know and can do and should provide parents with personalized, clear, precise, and meaningful feedback. Teachers should also strive to help parents understand how they can support their children at home.   The problem here is with the wording; ""should"" is not exactly imperative. In a normal reporting period all teachers follow that suggestion, but during a work to rule it makes sense that they would not.  The reason they chose ""should"" instead of ""will"" for talking about comments could very well have to do with the current time-allocation for reporting. It's much easier to suggest someone do something without providing adequate time than outright command it."
ontario,39cive,auv226,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:12:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, but what the boards are stating is that they wont issue report cards at all, which seems contradictory to the ideas your posting that the board software does not need to be used. The unions are saying that they wont be issuing report cards at all when clearly, both documents are saying its a teachers responsibility to complete the report cards. You are also trying to construe the language to work in your favour, which is exactly how the government legitimized the back to work legislation, by suggesting that the unions were not following the guidelines set out in which they are allowed to strike.  As someone who went through Teachers College and got to experience teaching, I fully sympathize with the extremely frustrating amount of work that is packed into one workweek. However, I dont see this helping the teachers in any way to garner support. Youll have more people who are going to look at the Education Act and immedietly call the job action illegal.  This isnt a time to construe the language in your favour. You cant expect the government to respect any strike when they can look up the act as easily as I could and declare your strike illegal.

Some boards have decided that transferring these marks into the software would be too much work for principals, so have decided to cancel them altogether and blame it on the teachers.  This is definitely a time to construe language in one's favour. These are legal documents, and verbs like ""will"" and ""should"" are not chosen haphazardly.

I know from my own educational experience I knew some bad teachers as well. I wouldnt say my experience is in the ""very few"" range, but I could remember some instances of bad teaching.  An example I remember is our Grade 6 teacher making us listen to Don McLean's American Pie as part of our music ""lessons"". We had to copy down the song as she played it and then discussed what the song was about (which seems more like a literary exercise than music). We didnt learn anything about singing, verse, rhythm or anything about musical notes and if I remember correctly, I dont think we actually ever figured out what the song was about.  Also remember a Grade 7 Science Teacher who used to tell us stories about what she used to be ""allowed to do"" to students before OCT came along, even telling us she had this small foam ball gun she used to get attention of students, even admitted to throwing tennis balls at students.  She seemed miserable when she taught Science too. Everything was ""my boss says you have to learn this"". I dont know about anyone else, but I like to reinforce the idea that the things we learn even at that level can atleast have some real world applications.

The best time to learn is when you're young so having some sort of feedback on where to improve is very important. Plus, what are the school boards going to do with the extra 1 million dollars?  Also there should be 0 additional staff because these entries are the responsibility of the teachers and other staff at the schools. If that isn't manageable the teaching quality is definitely low too and that money needs to be spent on hiring.  This is just a bullshit reason so that the staff can be lazier and get paid more."

The bigger question, I think, is what is the provincial government going to do with the $40+ million they saved from the strikes in Peel, Durham and Rainbow?  I don't really understand your point about the additional staff though. No one is claiming that entering report card comments isn't manageable for teachers (the ones who typically do it). That work is being withdrawn as part of labour action. It also really has nothing to do with teaching quality."

Every teacher I have ever known does reports cards on their own time because they aren't given a day or two off teaching to do them. A high school I used to work at did report cards and parent-student-teacher interviews every six weeks, which damn near killed the staff.  So, so many evenings and weekends lost to write personalized comments about hundreds of kids, and almost every time (if not every time), the technology would fail and the networked data files for at least some of it would be lost and have to be re-created from scratch. The centrally government controlled IT asses also wouldn't open up accessibility from anywhere not on the physical network, so the teachers had to not only work through their evenings and weekends, but they had to do it at the school, which was a bigger slap in the face that required commuting, parking, etc. Oh, and they still had to do their lesson planning, marking, teaching.  I don't know what's in the contracts for the schools/boards involved, though. It is entirely possible they all have a gob of prep time built in for this type of work."

I remember when I was growing up and through high school even seeing her often working on grading and plans and other things until upwards of 9:00 at night.

Why do they have to be worse in order to not do the dumbest thing possible and leave them unfettered access to our market and economy, bleeding off our health and wealth under false pretenses? Are we that stupid? Is it normal for you to set the bar that low? For yourself or just others?  They're a toxic, garbage, novelty, stupid product on the face of it. Why shouldn't that be enough?

They both seem like they want to get better but our system is not set up to provide them with the proper help to get them healthy and back on their feet. I live in a town that is ravaged by heroin use and for a lot of the addicts here, if you want help and can't afford a private rehab centre you're basically screwed. You can get methadone but these people need more than just a bandaid."

ontario,39apq1,untitleddocument37,3,Thu Jun 11 11:32:51 2015 UTC,How can someone work on getting clean when they have no access to a rehab clinic for a safe detox? counselling to help them through whatever issue caused them to turn to drugs in the first place and a safe environment where they won't be surrounded by drug use. It's easy for someone like you to say when you've probably come up in a middle class family with access to everything you want and need and probably family support as well. Is it really a better solution to just leave these people in the streets or in a jail cell instead of helping them become productive members of society? Get your head out of your ass. Society will never improve if people have attitudes like yours.
ontario,39apq1,DomashnaRakija,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:52:13 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point.  Many people who abuse drugs don't want to get clean because they don't fight the urges and relapse 95% of the time even after getting sober for months.  Ironically, this is why distribution of drugs should be illegal because while not everyone is addictive [most are] once you're hooked you have better odds of beating cancer than getting rehab'ed.  And in various capacities there are services/etc for drug users just they get stretched thin and frankly people are tired of hearing about it.  The better solution is to focus on people who have a chance.  It's called triage.  You don't waste resources on someone who has a 0.5% chance of survival when someone with a 70% chance walks in the door.  I'd rather funds go in priority to schooling and yes drug enforcement (on dealers less so on users)."

People like this couple needed intervention before they got to this point, the motel should be a little more reasonable as well.  If you ignore the problem it just gets worse - the dealer will always be happy to see them, the little old lady getting harassed for money or some guy like me having his car broken into, less so.  And if they enter the legal system it'd be cheaper to pay them $100K/year each if they just promised to stay out of trouble, as a taxpayer I hate seeing people go to prison.  That's where the downward spiral ends, usually.  Expensive taxpayer-funded accommodations and nobody's happy with the result.  Prevention is cheaper"

ontario,39d7ge,Cow_Bug,6,Wed Jun 10 23:50:55 2015 UTC,"My thought is you shouldn't be entitled to it. Why should you get it? Were you looking for work at the time? EI is supposed to be paid for a brief time while someone is actively looking for work. Did you go into debt during this time or suffer any consequences that you haven't yet recovered from? If no, there's really no reason why you should receive back pay EI. This is tax payer money.   To add to this, you're talking a year back. If it was a month or two, perhaps then. Even if you've been charged an incorrect charge on your cell phone bill, you have 3 months to bring it to their attention."
ontario,39d7ge,RationalSocialist,3,Thu Jun 11 01:20:09 2015 UTC,"In theory it isn't supposed to be this way, but in reality EI is mostly income supplementation for seasonal workers.  I guess you can't really blame the OP for wanting to get every cent that may be owed to him, but I definitely don't love the whole concept.   EI payments are very meager. They could provide a lot more help to people who actually need it if they weeded out this crap."

Also you don't really count as seasonal. All things considered I don't see how you would qualify for ei. They only way I could see around this is to have an existing claim so on the weeks you don't work your report will indicate zero income, and then you will be paid for them (this is common in the construction industry, which I think is the general idea your trying to get) but otherwise I can't see you meeting the overall requirements for ei."
ontario,39d7ge,asisarnia,2,Thu Jun 11 23:18:01 2015 UTC,"Teachers do qualify for EI during breaks in the year, as do any seasonal workers.
