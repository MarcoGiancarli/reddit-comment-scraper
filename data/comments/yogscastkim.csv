yogscastkim,3e3lh9,NiteLite,4,Tue Jul 21 18:40:33 2015 UTC,"I actually also had a guy staring into my livingroom recently.  It was a middle-aged guy with a beard and shaggy hair last sunday. He just stood there, leaning with his elbows against the window sill and stared inside while I was playing TerraFirmaCraft on my PC.  He stood there for a bit, so I decided to stand up and ask him if I could help him, but as soon as I stood up he just turned and walked away.  Personally I suspect that it was some drunk guy on his way home from the pub or something, but it was still an odd experience."

I freakin love this series, it's my favourite out of all the yogscast mine craft series, this is like SOI level of intriguing! And I would really hate for episode 100 to be just a stupid recap.

yogscastkim,3dxy6h,TweetPoster,2,Mon Jul 20 13:20:23 2015 UTC,"You've most likely already played them but maybe it's been long enough to where you might consider replaying them and recording, but I think it'd be really fun and cool if you played like Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask or Super Mario 64. And if not, you might've already played this one too, the Sly Cooper games would be really fun too."
yogscastkim,3dxy6h,Sir_Bass13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:36 2015 UTC,"Personally I want to see Kim experience something by Platinum Games; the studio formed from ex-Clover (Okami) staff and Capcom's Devil May Cry team. Their work is literally ""all your favorite OTT anime moments"" made into action game form. Bayonetta 2 is the undisputed pinnacle of this but it takes approx 20 hours to beat the campaign, whilst the original is half that length. Or if this is just for a filler series, Metal Gear Rising: REVENGEANCE is only 6 hours plus 2 1-hour DLCs. You don't need to have played any other Metal Gear to enjoy it either: it's a spin-off set much further in the future."
yogscastkim,3dxy6h,AlloyMorph,5,Mon Jul 20 13:57:21 2015 UTC,"Oooof, I'm not really good at those games. My fingers and thumbs start suffering serious cramps. I've played a lot of Bayonetta (loved the story, stayed for the hair combos), and REVENGEANCE (slicy slicy watermelons), so I don't really think I could make a recording fun since I've played them both quite a bit, so it's not FRESH. Soz. :/"
yogscastkim,3dxy6h,nanosounds,4,Mon Jul 20 14:04:04 2015 UTC,"No problem, that just means you enjoyed them at your own pace! In that case, some more recommendations (assuming you haven't also played them already):   Heroes of the Storm highlight reels. I understand completely if this is one of your ""after-hours"" games that you don't want to record, but after seeing that DOTA 2 microseries I want to know what it's like when you're playing a MOBA and feel in control of it. (Or if you want to spoil us, livestream it with 4 other yogs!) Civilization V with Duncan showing you the ropes for a multiplayer game. Again I understand if you feel otherwise, but I've found the lack of fresh faces in the Civ FFA was letting it get a bit stale and you certainly seem to have the competitive determination to mix it up real interesting-like.  The Stanley Parable is what P.T. would be like as a comedy game rather than horror. It's also much better than Gone Home at telling a story IMO (though I'm biased for getting bait-and-switched by that game's marketing, which portrayed it as an Amnesia-like and ended up feeling really bland.) Terraria got a HUGE new patch recently, as in this game which started with only 3 boss fights now has 14. The crafting interface is much better now and items cost less materials to make, so a lot of the grind that was there initially is gone now. In my experience if you have 3+ players on a Medium world then the pacing is perfect and you can blitz through everything quite rapidly (Martyn played it years ago when it first released and Zoey loves all things Castlevania-like, and you seem to get on OK!)   Just my humble suggestions. Have a nice day Kim!  P.S: I'm assuming this is just to hold down the fort until a certain release on 22nd of September? ;)"
yogscastkim,3dxy6h,AlloyMorph,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:37:43 2015 UTC,"I would like to second Terraria. People often dismiss this game as ""2D Minecraft"", but it is so much more. I've never felt bored playing this game. Definitely one of the best vanilla experiences out there."

Quite a few of horror tropes in the game as well. Though it's mostly your characters in the game that'll go mad from the horror. If they're lucky.

yogscastkim,3dxy6h,SquirrelPowa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:40:03 2015 UTC,"First and foremost: GONE HOME YES.   Other suggestions:   -Transistor? Hella good game by the makers of Bastion, you may have already played it though. I like it because it's a shooty-type game that focuses more on strategy than actual keyboard mashing fighting. The story is absolutely killer, the art is amazing, and it's refreshingly progressive.   -Mirror's Edge x 10000  -Pneuma: Breath of Life? It's a pretty simple puzzle game set in a beautiful palace-museum kind of place, about a god questioning his own existence. idk if it'd make a full playthrough but you could check it out.   -Beyond Eyes! Idk if you've heard of it, but it's like a beautiful watercolor landscape and you play as a blind girl.  -No specific games, but more horror! I get so excited when I see that you guys are playing a horror game. Even when it's a bad horror game, it's awesome. The only specific horror suggestion I have is:  -Alice: The Madness Returns. The sick-as-hell trailer says it all.   (I was 2 paragraphs in to a recommendation for Sunless Sea before I remembered you already played it. )"

yogscastkim,3dwokj,Treya7,6,Mon Jul 20 03:57:21 2015 UTC,"I'm in my element here.  Feed The World episode 25 + Apprentice with Sjin & Sips as a sort of 'prologue' to the story.  Apprentice with Duncan:   Episode 1 - The Wizard's Apprentice (introduction) Episode 4 - Accident in the Workplace (The Great Fluxing) Episode 5 - Tower Escape (exactly what it says in the title) Episode 8 - Spring Cleaning (Flux spreading + more symptoms) Episode 10 - All Good Things... (for the lead up to...)   Galacticraft:   Episode 1 - Crash and Burn (how The Apprentice ended and all that) Episode 37 - We Have Lift Off (not necessarily story related, but a pretty important moment nonetheless) Episode 38 - The Old Castle (finding the ruins of the castle in the YCP world)   Flux Buddies Prime:   Episode 1 - PandaLabs (again, not story related but fairly important) Episode 26 - Tainted Forest (for random flux trance? She also says ""Join me,"" rather ominously, which is, um... interesting in hindsight...)   And then the raiding of the castle starts at episode 63, not sure if you need anything past that?"
yogscastkim,3dwokj,Aeverelle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:06:10 2015 UTC,All of this is great but I still need to flesh out the storyline in flux buddies 2. I'm definitely going to keep everything you have said in mind and I'm probably going to have to rematch the episodes you have listed. Thank you so much! I can't even begin to tell you how much this will help me!
yogscastkim,3dwokj,KoLycaon,3,Mon Jul 20 11:48:12 2015 UTC,Your idea makes me realize how long the story's been going. I think it would neat to see the story as it is together.  From the Apprentice I would think the first and fourth episodes with Duncan are important storyline wise.   The first (The Wizard's Apprentice) introduces Lalna to Nano.  The fourth (Accident in the Workplace) establishes Nano falling into the Flux Sphere.  The beginning of the fifth (Tower Escape) might also be of help as it establishes the dangers of flux and its initial spread on Nano.

yogscastkim,3dr5ar,evildrganymede,2,Sun Jul 19 00:07:06 2015 UTC,"The way it works for Dinos is that it's literally a diceroll for every dino that's off it's breeding cooldown nearby. That's ok when they're spread out, or there's only 2 of them, but when they're grouped like that, the low breeding cooldown of raptors creates a population explosion."
yogscastkim,3dr5ar,RGPFerrous,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:34:47 2015 UTC,"No, you SHOULD weaponise them and have them patrol the area. True, there are bellethornes,  and rather a lot of them. And Lalbabble and Specimen5 have angel rings. If you still had the crazy-mobs-mod,  I would've suggested you capture some oneshot skeletons and ben them up around the base, then use the super jumpy thingies by moses' pool to get out.  But still, you could do with a secret escape tunnel. Or turrets. Turrets are nice, everybody loves turrets.  And if someone gets past that, just kick the fu**er in the nuts and watch 'em squirm. unless they don't have any. In that case, stab them. Stabbing is always good in every situation."

yogscastkim,3dj01a,richbellemare,3,Thu Jul 16 21:51:25 2015 UTC,"I saw Duncan mentioning he couldn't find a reliable method to hide or keep things safe. If I recall correctly, you can use Warded Arcana from Thaumcraft, that allow you to create doors,  pressure plates and glass that are indistructuble unless by a wand held by the user who placed them and limit the access to whoever the placer wants.  Apart from that, I just think it's really cool to have a glass room that has everything completely safe in it but is completely visible to everyone. So close, yet so far. Please consider it as a solution, since you already did Thaumcraft research."

yogscastkim,3dj01a,K-guy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:14:09 2015 UTC,Fun fact: You can easily reproduce nether quartz with botania. No need to go to the nether ever again. Just drop it into a mana pool with the alchemy catalyst underneath it.

If 'Pistronics' is in this pack (I can't recall if it is or not), and if you have the energy to learn how to use it, you could always make a system like one of the Knight of Fangs' first Aura machines, a rotating 'hourglass' style Aura node system where the aura serves as the 'sand' in the 'hourglass', a lever turns the 'hourglass', and you ensure that no aura goes to waste."

Who could whip out their weapon the fastest, who had the superior arms, who would take the dominant position and who would be the last to collapse upon the floor? Sometimes the sheer duck firepower would render the less prepared ones unconscious, other times a net got involved which usually preceded a warm embrace and a vertigo-inducing ride through the clouds, yet more spectacular was when a winning streaker had their own projectile load explode in their face. There was rapid bouncing, thrusting of hard objects, face-first diving, high-velocity penetration and the occasional ducking in an open corner. Especially from Zoey, who ended up stealing the ultimate prize from Zylus.  Duck Game: take flight and make your friends look like utter quacks, or feather the storm and aggressively clip the leader's wings as you tell everyone to duck off!

Of course they'd still have to record the audio for the clones separately, but it does mean they could avoid a 'Lalnasaurus' situation where they can only film from certain perspectives so the second account name doesn't pop up.  The only thing they'd have to be wary of is that looking at the player will still reveal the real account through WAILA and similar mods.  (We also had a third person join us after a while, and there were three Lukas running around. It was a mess. Also, turning into the person does not actually consume the taglock.)"

For the record, I am still working on this mod. My progressed has been slowed quite a bit since I am temporary working two jobs at the moment.   A few of the bugs that were shown on the video, I have fixed in my private dev build. Also the gauntlet has a default max range of 64 blocks, which is why the dragon wasn't killed when you first tried it.  Also, Kim. Were there any other mods installed when you spotlighted this?"

Thanks so much for creating this mod - we've had a lot of fun with it :D  There weren't any other mods installed-  we just used vanilla minecraft with your mod.   On a side note, I was just wondering if you managed to backport this to work with 1.7.10? Sorry, I know it's a big ask, especially with you working two jobs right now, but I've got a project I'm working on at the moment that we'd love to use the Gauntlet mod in, but we're working in 1.7.10 :(   PS - I guess I owe you dinner now :D"

yogscastkim,3da19f,Barnabus_Bot,2,Tue Jul 14 17:47:12 2015 UTC,so what would happen if you put someone in the pocket dimension then threw them in the portal...
yogscastkim,3da19f,seavord,2,Tue Jul 14 19:17:44 2015 UTC,"Duncan, that White Stone is a Horcrux. You charge it by standing in midnight moonlight and when at 100%, a blow that would normally kill you instead drains the stone empty and gives you 10 sec of Regeneration and Fire Resistance. And a bit of nausea."
yogscastkim,3da19f,AlloyMorph,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:32:31 2015 UTC,"Also, on a Blood Moon (if those still happen, as I notice in the mainline RR3 series Lyinginbedmon is doing - Yokai Temple - that he's been talking about how they don't get blood moons anymore, I'm not sure if that's entirely part of the roleplay or if they tweaked the mod config, or just outright removed it, though if the White Stone is still in, then they obviusly didn't remove it I suppose), if you throw it on the ground for 10 seconds or so it becomes a Bloodstone (empty), which you charge by killing mobs, and grants you regen when in your inventory, based on how charged it is (up to a maximum of 1 heart per second with 400 kills/charges on the stone), but it drains completely when you die with it in your inventory. You can also use it to force a blood moon (to give yourself a challenge, or to get more bloodstones/give your allies a chance to get bloodstones for themselves) by making a pattern on the ground out of Obsidian, Netherbrick, Quartz blocks, and Redstone blocks, and right-clicking the center block with the bloodstone in hand.  (All info from the official RandomThings wiki)"
yogscastkim,3da19f,OmegaX123,2,Tue Jul 14 21:53:16 2015 UTC,"I love that you're getting into Aura Cascade. I've watched KirinDave and Lyinginbedmon do wonders with it on Sunless Minecraft/the early days of Knight of Fangs (the Absque Sole special pack of Resonant Rise 3). It's incredibly in-depth, but not ridiculously complicated if you put just a little time into it. It has its own enchanting system (which works alongside the vanilla system, meaning you can Aura-enchant a sword and then vanilla enchant the same sword for double the, for example, Looting or Sharpness). My word of advice is, either watch those series before going too far down the Aura pathways, especially Dave's Sunless livestream videos, or at least, if you choose not to do that/don't have the time to because of busy YogSchedules and real life, at least build a proper Aura Tower.  Aura Cascade is essentially the Science of Magic, while Botania is the Magic of Science (in the form of botany/natural sciences). I like the duality and mirroring there, and it means that your decision to put your Aura lab next to your Botania hut is that much more perfect."
yogscastkim,3d4j2m,Peperib,2,Mon Jul 13 13:40:15 2015 UTC,"This was actually brought up a while back, and Kim was reserving judgement until there was more information available. One can hope though!"

yogscastkim,3d4j2m,evildrganymede,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:41:22 2015 UTC,"The end was soo bad. First, the alien queen has the ability to give birth like a human. That was annoying, but only slightly bearable. Then, the alien has feelings, freaking eyes and a nose. That honestly ruined the entire alien persona that the franchise had built up over the past decade or two. I mean don't get me wrong, that thing was all kinds of creepy and terrifying. Especially in that scene where it held its hand up covered in that guy's blood and almost smiled. That looked like something out of creepy pasta, but it's just not right in an alien movie.  As I think Kim said in a Flux Buddies episode, Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection are good movies. If you don't think of them as alien movies."
yogscastkim,3d3qx7,MelodicCodes,8,Mon Jul 13 07:44:23 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Nano is the only one who has been confirmed to hear voices and Mother - Lalna has been very vague on what he does and does not experience when it comes to the Flux, but he is clearly not as affected by being in tainted areas etc. Tapping into a power that usually rots your mind seems hard, and something probably only Nano will be capable of doing. (At a price, of course.)  Alternatively, it won't be a concious effort on their part, but when push comes to shove maybe Mother could maybe give her 'children' a hand? I assume the existance of Nano and Lalna are advantageous to Her, She wouldn't want them to be in danger, would She?  And, it has to be said, Lalnable and Specimen 5/Echo haven't been amazingly competent, have they? I'm sort of hoping we can blame it on Lalnable not having sufficent information when infiltrating, and Echo on her being 'young' or the clone simply not being stable enough yet. While we don't know their purpose, I'd love for them to pose an actual threat.  (That's the thing I didn't really like about episode 85 - it just felt like everyone lacked rational decision making. Every character was passing the Idiot Ball around and the only reason why Nano and Lalna ended up alright is because Echo managed to out-dumb them. The build up was amazing, but the resolution was a little bit lackluster imo.  As a few others have said, I think a 'flip side' episode focusing on Echo and Lalnable would be a good way to go from here. It'd mean we could see how the evil counterparts interact with each other - and since they wouldn't have to contest against Nano and Lalna (who by default will almost always overpower them), they could reinforce their badassness.)  Lastly, either Echo's Flux is fake or it's real. It could be fake, because she seemed to have control over all mobs, not just the tainted ones. She didn't seem to have a specific reaction to the tainted area either, and couldn't be touched by the darkness.  If it is real though, her Flux looks to be slightly further along than Nano's, which means she could probably tap into Warp and Eldritch magic more easily than Nano can.  ... And if it is real, I wonder what Mother thinks of Echo?"
yogscastkim,3d3qx7,Aeverelle,3,Mon Jul 13 08:18:32 2015 UTC,"It's also worth noting that Echo herself seems to be a thaumturge due to her use of golems. I don't use their texture pack, but if those were flesh golems Echo was controlling, Echo could be one step ahead in gaining warp to overpower her foes.  One advantage Lalnable and Echo seem to have over our native Flux Buddies is ruthlessness; they will likely do whatever they can to obtain power, and while they may be somewhat of a 'goldfish poop gang' right now, they could easily grow into a larger threat due to their ruthless nature. Lalnable was cloning Kim for a reason. And this may very well be it.  All the more reason for the Flux Buddies to take the plunge into the Eldrich Abyss."
yogscastkim,3d3qx7,Aeverelle,4,Mon Jul 13 08:27:38 2015 UTC,"I think they're clay golems - those tend to spawn in those Artifacts towers.  I agree - and Echo seems to be a bit manipulative as well. I'm thinking Lalnable will either come fetch her out of the Deep Dark, or Lalna and/or Nano will eventually talk to her in the pocket dimension and she'll charm her way out of it. Nano seems to be very forgiving to her already and Lalna can be a bit gullible :p  And even moreso than being a thaumaturge, Echo seems to have inherited Nano's talent for witchery, which is nothing short of worrisome either."
yogscastkim,3d3qx7,DuIstalri,3,Mon Jul 13 09:00:07 2015 UTC,"The name 'clay golem' appeared when Duncan fought them, so there's no doubt that that's what they were."
yogscastkim,3d3qx7,LoneWolfIcy,3,Mon Jul 13 11:48:12 2015 UTC,"That may be true, but I honestly think it's more likely that Duncan and Kim will resort to more... traditional methods. I assume the ""gaping hole in the wall"" was a result of Nano's excellent use of the rocket launcher, and missiles are easier to acquire then thaumic knowledge."
yogscastkim,3d3qx7,CorenSV,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:25:00 2015 UTC,"Now, disregarding wither mother is part of warp or just something else entirely.  Do you really think that if the flux buddies started to delve into dark magic that it would end up going swimmingly? Neither lalna nor nano are very good at following instructions or acting with caution. Couple that with dark magic and it's an accident waiting to happen. (Granted, it would be hilarious to watch nano go all freaky when lalna starts pulling out dark magic stuff and starts setting it up next her noodle bar or something.)  Also, I don't think they really are that much of a threat just yet. Lalnable has done horrible things but hasn't been a direct threat. The one time he actually got close he was easily kicked of the property. Echo has gathered info but ended up being locked in both the deep dark and a pocket dimension she can't escape from without outside help. Both aren't really at the level of competence or villainy where grabbing for dark magic like that is even necessary.

yogscastkim,3d0y82,LoneWolfIcy,5,Mon Jul 13 00:02:56 2015 UTC,"I hate to be that guy, but...   In Michael Crichton's ""Lost World"", those camouflaging dinosaurs were actual dinosaurs (As opposed to Jurassic World's I-Rex, which was genetically engineered). If I remember correctly, they mention that it was speculated that those dinosaurs could camouflage, but paleontologists didn't have proof. Jurassic Park wasn't completely practical effects. In my opinion, Jurassic Park mixed practical and CG effects really well. In fact, there's a lot more CGI than you'd think. Including the scene Kim mentioned where the T-Rex is chomping on the car (FYI, same video as above, just timestamped to car part). I do completely agree though, Jurassic World would have been much better with more practical effects.   Also, if you guys think Five Guys is good, next time you guys are in the western US, go to In-N-Out Burger. In my opinion, it's better burgers and fries than Five Guys (plus they have delicious milkshakes). One of my biggest regrets about moving away from California is not being able to eat In-N-Out Burger anymore."

This video adds a real nice aspect to the discussion:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxQxS0AdBY  In the end, you're right to say that other headphones are a lot better and cheaper than Beats, you definitely pay for the design and the fact that you have beats and can show them off. For someone that doesn't care about that at all, it's stupid to buy them. And while Bose does have a lot better quality and/or is cheaper, you still pay a lot for the name, too. Yes, less than for beats but it's not like Bose headphones cost 200$ to make either."

yogscastkim,3cxmx2,Treya7,2,Mon Jul 13 10:13:17 2015 UTC,it is a really cool concept but the only way I see Kim doing both is if they script the whole thing and Kim records both separately and they stitch the audio together in editing.

yogscastkim,3csh2b,AlloyMorph,3,Fri Jul 10 12:16:05 2015 UTC,"Eli Roth has disappointed me in recent years, and also, he's more of a b-horror gore fest type director. My horror tastes rest with the more psychological/supernatural genres. I don't really like the grossly named 'torture porn films', like the later Saw films, Hostel (also directed by Roth), etc, mainly because they're just gross out films that aren't actually that scary.  Also, it's inspired by Cannibal Holocaust, a film that made me feel sick to my stomach for it's gratuitous depiction of sexual assault and graphic violence. It hit me especially hard when I found out that they actually killed animals during the shooting of the movie, and were originally taken to court because it seemed like a snuff film. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibal_Holocaust#Controversy)  Finally, I always worry about films that focus on indigenous tribes, as they always depict tribes people as idiotic, backwards, barbaric communities, and really, they're not. (on a side note, I really enjoyed the BBC's documentary series on tribes, literally called Tribes, which really portrayed indigenous life in it's highs and lows https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe_%28TV_series%29)  Given Roth's love for gore, tits and exploring the boundaries of taboo, I think I'll give this one a miss!"

But I think they went a bit to obvious with it. Because now lalna just looks like a moron for not figuring it out.   I mean, the wings are an obvious thing. And at multiple times while watching the video I really thought that it was impossible to miss that nano wasn't nano. especially for people who have done multiple series together.   The only thing holding my suspense of disbelief together on that point was the fact that she knew the passphrase. So maybe lalna thought it was impossible for any imposter to know that phrase. So it had to be nano.. even though she's being wierd and strange.  The dolls either picked up the passphrase. or lalna figured out the passport from the hint nano gave him as she chased him off in episode 51. maybe both.  She said hte answer came from discworld. He could have gotten his hand son the books and figured it out on his own.   Ignoring that though. I really found it creepy and omnious. Something bad has happened to nano. And we know that lalna is giving away info without thinking to much about it. I'm guessing that their computer and flowers will go boom in the coming episodes :P. Or at least be targeted.  And that tower in the end. the one that echo pointed out and then told him not to go into. I think it might be that nano is in there. (where else could they have stored nano?) But at the same time it's a trap for duncan.   Anyway. despite its obvious flaw. I still enjoyed the episode. I hope the tower is either a trap or a red herring. And that nano doesn't get saved for a few episodes yet. (Let lalna fret for a while.) She probably will be saved in the next episode. I mean, how would you handle one of the duo being MIA? Show her being inprisoned by lalnable and him gloating? Her trying to mount an escape operation on her own?   Episode isn't perfect. But I love the story stuff.

Duncan's issue with the Digital Miner is the size of the radius is too small as well as the minimum level, all of these can be accessed on the left hand side of the config menu in the Digital Miner. Duncan needs to set the radius to its max (just type a REALLY large number and it will default to its largest setting) as well as set the minimum level to o.

yogscastkim,3cbdey,Barnabus_Bot,5,Mon Jul 6 16:17:16 2015 UTC,"Just thought I would let you know that the sniper is a splat weapon kim, not a spray weapon. Unless you're someone who knows how to get kills and what areas to protect from enemies it's not recommended that you use it. You're better of using the roller if you want to cover large amounts of ground and using a different gun if you want to be mobile with the ability to rush ahead. Snipers should always stay behind someone if they are not in an area they control."

yogscastkim,3cbdey,SquirrelPowa,2,Tue Jul 7 02:45:51 2015 UTC,"Kim, if you'd like a sniper weapon that shoots fast and chargers just aren't your thing, I'd recommend the Jet Squelcher. It is a shooter weapon with a very long range that comes with the Splash Wall, a deployable barrier only your team can walk and shoot through, as well as the powerful Ink Strike. There is also the Custom Jet Squelcher, which is unlockable in single player. Its stats are the same as the Jet Squelcher's, but it comes with instantly exploding grenades and the Kraken, to better defend yourself in close encounters."
yogscastkim,3c9d1n,SquirrelPowa,3,Mon Jul 6 02:49:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, of course I'll play it. Just hope it makes it to full development!

It draws so many similarities to the silent hills demo that it's nuts. It'll send chills down your spine just watching the alpha gameplay, and it looks like the kind of game Kim and Hannah would really enjoy (in a masochistic way). Beautiful game, too. My favorite part of the video I watched was the Alpha and Omega framed on the wall in the starting room. Looking forward to it regardless, but it's something we should make SURE Kim sees."

As I recall the supposed Silent Hills was not going to be first-person gameplay but third-person.  Kojima did P.T. the way it is simply to make it ""indie"" and to introduce the kind of horror they wanna bring forth. Allison Road is probably a couple of guys' idea on: ""P.T. is a hallway.  We decide to do the whole house.""  I'm hoping that the Allison guys would focus on the principles of P.T. and that is to induce mind-freaking blowing psychological horror and mystery.  P.T. was great because it did with ""less"" and yet managed to show us a lot more."

I guess the crazed Lalna clone was obsessed with making his own NanoSounds clone for some... reason. Maybe he's just lonely and wanted a friend? Mayyyybe?

yogscastkim,3bwfxr,ShikadiLord,2,Fri Jul 3 05:09:57 2015 UTC,Dunno about anyone else but I'd really rather not think about what an evil Lalnable Hector would do with a clone of Nanosounds.  If the Nanoclone is sane and sentient and not corrupted by cloning the process or by Lalnable then she could need to be rescued from his evil clutches. Or she could have been brainwashed (or she may have just come out insane/evil anyway) so she could be the er... Evil-Lyn to his Skeletor? Or something.
yogscastkim,3bwfxr,evildrganymede,3,Fri Jul 3 07:52:10 2015 UTC,God I hate dolls...I get shivers just looking at them.
yogscastkim,3bwfxr,Wndrlndgabby,3,Thu Jul 2 21:43:43 2015 UTC,I just have this weird feeling that the nano clone while physically the same age as nano is psychologically and emotionally the age of a naive 5 year old who genuinely wants nano to like her.

When they went there, the wall was full of blood, and the 2 they stole were the 2 missing from the doll vision. That means the doll viewed the future. The other thing it showed? Dead Duncan."

Emilia's facial structure also seams a bit... chunkier? (I guess that's the word I'm looking for) than Kim's. Still both Emilia and Kim are quite beautiful in there own right.

yogscastkim,3bfb3z,John-Piece,4,Mon Jun 29 00:01:28 2015 UTC,"FYI Kim, a really good way to fight the Gaia guardian is to create a small floating platform high in the sky, or out at sea.  The Gaia guardian can only teleport onto solid blocks, with limited range.  Once you make a platform, cover it with bear traps, then watch as the Gaia guardian teleports itself into a beartrap, at which point, it's an easy win."
yogscastkim,3bexg8,Barnabus_Bot,4,Sun Jun 28 16:37:12 2015 UTC,"They seem to be different peopl that you're interviewing (see the absent tattoo in some videos)  Also, I'm bothered that Kim completely ignored the mention of taking advice from a Ouija board."
yogscastkim,3bexg8,Cha0sXonreddit,8,Sun Jun 28 20:37:53 2015 UTC,Didn't ignore it. Noted it down in my notebook to return to later!
yogscastkim,3bexg8,nanosounds,3,Sun Jun 28 22:01:47 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that the police interviewed both Eve and Hannah, meaning the videos could be either one, or could be one pretending to be the other.  Crazy!  I suspect the interview of 18/06/94 is Hannah filing a missing person report.  Eve almost certainly has the tattoo (if Hannah has Eve's tattoo, that would be excessively crazy) so 01/07/94 must be Eve."
yogscastkim,3bexg8,ttoyooka,2,Sun Jun 28 20:45:42 2015 UTC,"So, I was thinking that the tattoo was the way to tell them apart.  There are some videos with short sleeves and a tattoo, and some videos with short sleeves and no tattoo, and some videos with long sleeves.  But, if someone was really determined, faking a tattoo wouldn't be that hard, and it would be tremendously misleading."
yogscastkim,3bexg8,peterlawford,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:11:44 2015 UTC,I believe they're playing the same trick of switching up with the police that they did with boys.  Simon is probably the one murdered.  Wanted to comment on this before I watch #3.
yogscastkim,3bbeh9,Barnabus_Bot,14,Sat Jun 27 16:37:09 2015 UTC,"My guess: ""Simon"" slept with ""Hannah"", and then a third person (lets call him ""Lewis"") killed him"
yogscastkim,3bbeh9,eXistenZ2,8,Sat Jun 27 20:23:25 2015 UTC,"I like the mentions of palindromes to throw you off the trail that Hannah may or may not be her actual name (Eve is also a palindrome)  I think finding out she's Eve (probably) is supposed to be quite late game, and Kim was quite lucky. But then again, I have not played this game myself."
yogscastkim,3bbeh9,Cha0sXonreddit,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:30:34 2015 UTC,"Well, you get the name Eve as soon as you search for Hannah. There is a video with tap code in which she says ""Hannah Hannah Hannah why did you tell them about Eve"". From there it's like a snowball effect."

yogscastkim,3bbeh9,crystal-assassin,2,Sun Jun 28 02:23:07 2015 UTC,"This is probably going to get buried or not seen before the recording of the videos ends, but she did not fail the lie detector test because she got her name wrong. On lie detector tests, you are supposed to only answer with ""yes"" or ""no"". You cannot answer with ""Yes, I am Hannah"" or something like that. If you do that, you fail, no matter if you said yes before or not. So the failed test does not mean she lied, it means she might have, we don't know."

yogscastkim,3b9bjw,VaegaVic,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:44:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  As far as her weight in the drawing, she's intended to look average weight and wearing non-form fitting clothing. Admittedly, I do tend to favor a pear-shape when drawing ladies, but reviewing pictures and gifs of Nano like this one I would say that her figure isn't too far off. I do appreciate the critique though and if you could elaborate on how she looks 'plump' it might help me when drawing Nano in the future."
yogscastkim,3b9bjw,VaegaVic,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:56:18 2015 UTC,Of course! I think (THINK) it's the middle of her. Completely agree with the pear shape but I think the middle isn't as pear like as it could be. It's a bit thicker than it should be. Needs to be more triangular. Edit: left side of her dress is what's throwing it off.
yogscastkim,3b7k0c,Barnabus_Bot,7,Fri Jun 26 16:37:07 2015 UTC,I must say that was really nice characterization. Poor Ross got beaten in the process.

The blue and pink blocks (Manasteel and Elementium, if I'm recalling correctly) absolutely are needed as part of the ritual. The rest of the floor pattern is, as you guessed, just decoration/to show the distances needed (Lyinginbedmon did it in Yokai Temple in a way that looked similar to a sort of shrine/dojo/arena type of area)."
yogscastkim,3b38ea,OmegaX123,11,Thu Jun 25 19:34:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your advise. We actually put the whole thing together and activated the ritual in the weekend's episodes. And...I don't know if I should say this, because I'm tired right now and a bit burned out...but can I ask that in the future, you give your advise and criticism in a more constructive manner than one that can be taken as a complaint or negatively? That goes for all of you! (I've had a lot of messages tonight.)  A little background - when we recorded this episode, I was suffering terribly from the flu. You won't hear it because Colin edited a lot out, but I was coughing a lot, and I had to stop at one point because my voice broke and I had to get meds. I was also suffering a high fever. As a result of this, we changed the episode plan from what we'd originally intended (as I needed to be on point), so I had to do some last minute research into the Gaia guardian, which sent me in a bit of a panic, as I hadn't practised it off camera (something I do when getting to grips with Witchery, Botania, etc). So yeah, I got things wrong. I couldn't focus. I also couldn't delay the session as we'd already missed one because of my illness, and I was about to go to E3 and now Duncan's away at Glastonbury all week, so we needed to ensure we had enough recordings so the publishing schedule didn't run out.   I recognise my physical and mental wellbeing isn't full blast at the moment, what with still recovering from the clusterfudge of a decision to go to E3 while still having the flu. I'm not telling you all of the above for sympathy! I just wanted to give you some insight as to why sometimes, recordings just don't go to plan, and we don't have the luxury of re-recording.   This isn't an attack on you, Omega, so please don't read it as such! And I hope it doesn't come across as that - I'm genuinely sorry if it does. I just wanted to fill you in on what was going on behind the scenes and reassure you that future Botania stuff is properly researched beforehand. Well, apart from one other thing Duncan asked me to make last second and I couldn't quite make it work properly. But hey. We are all mortal. This is just a polite ask that if you do have advise (and I know you do, I know you're a frequent commenter here!), could you be a bit more gentle with it? It's not your fault, cos how could you know that I'm feeling a bit burnt out right now? The tone just stuck with me a bit.   Other redditors who read this - please do not down vote Omega - he has a very valid point that I dun goofed on the research and performance, and I know that's annoying to see us constantly fail to showcase mods in a good way. I'm getting back on track now that E3's done, and taking a proper look at the new Botania stuff that's dropped. Thanks for bearing with us when we mess up, and thanks for all your advise - it does make this a lot more fun when it's a group effort!   Right, bed time for me. Peace out."
yogscastkim,3b38ea,nanosounds,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:23:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reading the message the way I had intended it - as 'advice with a bit of frustration/exasperation' rather than 'attack' - and for explaining the situation better. I have to say your series and Sjin's solo ""Rule the World"" are my two favourite series on the server currently, and I certainly didn't mean any offence or aggression, just, well... I had just finished watching the latest ""Blast Off!"" before watching this video, and the three of them have a habit of doing the same thing (looking at 'what I need to do' without thinking of 'why or how I need to do it'), so after watching them farting about in that manner for the whole episode, then coming to your series (where I've come to expect at least some research done beforehand, if not on Duncan's part then at least on yours) and seeing what looks to be the same thing... I'm sure you understand. I apologise for phrasing it in such a way (I guess I'm used to other Yogs, especially Sjin and Sips, taking the 'mock-aggressive' ribbing style of advice post in stride, or at least presenting that face to the fans).  EDIT: It just occurred to me... This is a good week for 'getting noticed by Yogs' for me, even if this time wasn't in the best of ways/for the best of reasons. First Sjin-senpai notices me and comments in-video (re: the 'Sjinterfell looks like Kakariko Village' thing), now Kim-senpai notices me too!"

I totally get your frustration, and the double frustration of watching Blast Off and FB back to back! Sorry for my mega post - like I said, I was tired last night and I just really wanted to get it all off my chest.   I guess maybe I differ from Sips and Sjin because I really appreciate the advise and feedback because I always feel a bit on the back foot with Minecraft.

yogscastkim,3am8kv,Faalentijn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:54:47 2015 UTC,"1918 flu pandemic:       The 1918 flu pandemic (January 1918 – December 1920) was an unusually deadly influenza pandemic, the first of the two pandemics involving H1N1 influenza virus.  It infected 500 million  people across the world, including remote Pacific islands and the Arctic, and killed 50 to 100 million of them—three to five percent of the world's population —making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in human history.      Most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill juvenile, elderly, or already weakened patients; in contrast the 1918 pandemic predominantly killed previously healthy young adults. Modern research, using virus taken from the bodies of frozen victims, has concluded that the virus kills through a cytokine storm (overreaction of the body's immune system). The strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body, whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups.   Historical and epidemiological data are inadequate to identify the pandemic's geographic origin.  It was implicated in the outbreak of encephalitis lethargica in the 1920s.   To maintain morale, wartime censors minimized early reports of illness and mortality in Germany, Britain, France, and the United States;    but papers were free to report the epidemic's effects in neutral Spain  (such as the grave illness of King Alfonso XIII), creating a false impression of Spain as especially hard hit —thus the pandemic's nickname Spanish flu.  In Spain, a different nickname was adopted, the Naples Soldier, which came from a musical operetta (zarzuela) titled La canción del olvido (The Song of Forgetting). The operetta premiered in Madrid during the first epidemic wave, and Federico Romero, one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, Naples Soldier, was as catchy as the flu.

I have a friend who always had nosebleeds until her parents bought her a horse. Isn't it fascinating how being near to certain animals cures you? I mean, they tried one doctor after another, one said ""no tomatoes! That'll fix it!"" Consequently, no ketchup on her birthday. Ever tried eating stone hard chips without ketchup as a child? Freaking impossible. but yeah, that didn't work. Next idiot suggested no sugar. Guess what - didn't work!  Some genius said it's their family dog's fault. Funny thing, the dog was never allowed inside anyway. So on to the next theory: let her sit with her feet in a tub of water 30 minutes before bedtime.And guess how that turned out! So one day they go to another doctor and he says ""This is all rubbish. The only thing that might work is of you buy her a horse."" And that actually fixed the problem for good.  There you go, my story about nosebleeds.  Just to keep the theme going.  incidentally, don't windmills generate more power the higher up they are?

When you just have to blow your nose every once in a time and maybe cough you could still be productive, but with a nose bleed all you can do is just bend over a sink and let the water run while you slowly bleed out, while occasionally blowing your nose to make sure the mucus doesn't clog it up and give you a nasty suprise when you actually have to blow your nose.  The bath always looks like a crime scene after I am done, plus sometimes a few blood drops from the desk to the bathroom.  Even worse when I got it while being at school, or at work (I usually start taking drugs early so I never felt all that bad when I had a cold), especially since a nose bleed just happens without any prior warning."

To make this somewhat expensive multiblock you will need the following -one bucket of lava -one bucket of water -one cobblestone -one transfer node (items) -one to sixty four world interaction uppgrades -one to two hundred and six speed uppgrades  To create this simpel, yet functional cobblegen just follow these steps  1.create a hole one block deep one block wide and three blocks in lenght  2.put the cobblestone in the middle block with water one onw side and lava on the other  3.place you transfer node on the block of cobblestone and put 1-64 world interaction uppgrades in it  Suggestions to improve it further: 1.to store the cobblestone dont pump it into your ME system, simply place a deep storage unit ontop of the transfer node with a storage bus connected to it S(this storage bus will ofcourse be connected to your me system)  2.place speed uppgrades in a ratio of (roughly) one stack of speed uppgrades for every sixteen world interaction ones, this will prevent it from clogging up  3.you can also replace one of the stacks of speed uppgrades with a stack uppgrade, Beware though as you can only use one of these at a time and it makes no differenci if you put a stack of them instead of one  Hopefully this post has been helpfull to you and duncan I wish you the best of luck with your serieses (grammar dammit!) and good luck with your lives One of your subscribers -thegreenpact"

yogscastkim,3aj576,mykoira,2,Sun Jun 21 04:26:40 2015 UTC,"I know they both prefer Playstation   Kim mentioned in the video that she played most of her previous generation games on the Xbox 360 and that she is a fan of Xbox exclusives such as Halo and Gears of War. Also, Kim is a big fan of a lot of Nintendo exclusive games, so I get the impression that Kim cares more about the games than the platform.

I mean, Strawfingers was supposed to make a comeback in Feed the World 2, but I'm not sure if he ever did (correct me if I'm wrong, I didn't watch the later episodes of FTW2) and it's quite unlikely that there's going to be a Feed the World 3. Unless Strawfingers shows up in DruidZ: Regrowth, is there really any room for Sjin to use or explore Strawfingers?  I was immensely excited when Kim and Duncan started 'subtly' (:p) discussing Nano's origins in the Nether and her interaction with Strawfingers. And I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one interested in hearing her backstory either. It would be such a shame if Kim and Duncan had to avoid certain plotlines because Strawfingers isn't really their character."

If you'd specifically like some critique, I have a couple of suggestions that might help, but overall I think it's a good drawing.  That said, there are a couple of art-related subreddits such as /r/SketchDaily/ /r/redditgetsdrawn /r/artfundamentals and /r/artistspeakeasy that are a great community for artists to post work and improve.

yogscastkim,3a56p3,Dimnos,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:14:36 2015 UTC,"Alright, well first: I absolutely love the skin and the unhinged bottom wolf jaw. I think the anatomy on the animal is pretty good.  On Kim, the only things I would change are to bring her left eye down a little, and maybe in a bit. I have a tendency to draw my eyes too close together, so moving it in may be just my tendency to do that.  The other thing I noticed is that I don't think her left nostril would be as visible as it is. I think with her head tilted down and at a 3/4 view I wouldn't be seeing so much of the actual 'nostril'.  I really love the concept, the detail you put into the left eye (I'm a sucker for well drawn eyes), and the shape of the mouth. Also, I can see the circle guidelines for the head and I think you got the head a pretty good size. My art teacher always says people don't include enough 'brain' when they draw people at different angles, and I think you've done a really good job!  (I also can't get over that snout and nose on the wolf- too good. I love it!)  I hope my comments have helped, but I think what might help even more is taking the drawing in front of a mirror and looking at it, or using a digital program like GIMP or photoshop to flip the image so you can get a good feel for what looks good and what doesn't.  :)"
yogscastkim,3a56p3,Nuclear_Siafu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:56:41 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Thank you very much. It's interesting that it's such a struggle for me to be objective about the image. I didn't notice any of the problems you pointed out, but as soon as you did they were clear as day. I'll definitely try the flip trick.  I've been staying away from reference images which is probably bad. I should start using them, at least until my eye has been trained properly. What I'm trying to do is visualize the character the way that I want it and then draw it, making adjustments in my mind as I go along. Visualization doesn't work that well for me though as the image tends to come out distorted and deformed. Clearly still difficult for me to translate the 3-dimensional mental image to a 2-dimentional drawing.  As for the eyes, I've been trying to keep at least an eye width between the eyes which is apparently the standard. But technically, at a 3-quarter view, the one eye is viewed straight on and the eye on the right is view from a slight angle, which would mean that the one should be slightly thinner? I'm not sure if the differnce would be large enough to be that visible though and what the space between the eyes should then be (possibly an average between the widths of the two eyes). I know that the thinner eye is done in anime drawings. I don't know if I'm trying to be to technical with this. Maybe I should just try sticking to reference images for a while until I start noticing these issues and it may be easier to determine if it looks correct or not."

yogscastkim,3a28kv,Aeverelle,5,Tue Jun 16 20:17:15 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't it be faster to make a transfer node with a mining upgrade and a speed upgrade over a cobblestone generator?

So say you set the minimum to 0 and the maximum to 32, it'll only mine between bedrock and y=32, and the giant hole you're making won't come up to right under your base. It also means you can add an all ores filter (""ore"" with asterisks around it) and only get the valuable stuff at diamond/gold level."
yogscastkim,3a28kv,Torkmatic,3,Tue Jun 16 19:56:42 2015 UTC,"Instead of using a digital miner to get cobblestone use a transfer node to get it faster  Build it like this: Make a pit thats 1 deep 3x1, put cobble in the middle then lava in one hole and water in the other Put a transfer node on top of the cobblestone and then hook it up with transfer pipes to a chest  That should make cobblestone very fast"

yogscastkim,39gq9f,BulletBer,2,Sat Jun 13 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"""Lone wolves go crazy because they have to survive on their own"" (yogscastkim) and ""we should castrate the males, I don't want any competition"" (yogscastlalna). Wow. Just wow.  For two people in the 21st century who are so enjoying being werewolves, the two of you know embarrassingly little about actual wolves.  The socalled ""lone wolf"" doesn't exist. It's a very popular myth everybody likes to quote, but while it is true that a wolf might wander alone for a time shortly after leaving their pack, they always join other packs or even found their own. They can't survive on their own over a long time, only 10% of all pack hunts are succesful, so you might be able to figure out how good the hunt will be with just one wolf. These single wolves show little signs of agression during their time alone. Wolves can adapt to any circumstance with incredible speed so a wolf can even survive when living in a rural area for some time. Furthermore the wolf will not attack humans unless cornered and provoked. Provocation that leads to attacks is often the result of poor knowledge of animal handling. Leave the wolf alone and he will leave you alone.  The second popular myth is the pack hierarchy where the alpha rules and the rest constantly fights over rank. This, frankly, is complete and utter bullshit. Wolves are highly intelligent and highly social animals. Packs aren't just comprised of random wolves, most of them are of the same bloodline. There is always an alpha pair, founders of the pack, the parents. In regular wolf packs (12 - 15 wolves) only the alpha female will give birth to young wolves, but the entire pack will take care of them. In bigger packs (eg. Yellowstone Druids, in their best days 37 members) other females may also become pregnant, though this is rather rare.  If one of you took the time to actually look these things up you might find that there is even more to wolves that might come as a surprise. I am by no means a certified expert, but I have read many studies on these fascinating creatures. I highly recommend you do the same."

yogscastkim,38xu2d,Barnabus_Bot,2,Sun Jun 7 19:37:06 2015 UTC,I wonder if Kim has watched Blackrock? ...or SOI
yogscastkim,38xu2d,John-Piece,2,Mon Jun 8 02:22:06 2015 UTC,"I believe she mentioned previously that she's not watched either of them. Might have been in Nano's Village, though I'm stumped for where it was."
yogscastkim,38xu2d,RGPFerrous,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:27:17 2015 UTC,"I think so too, but I can only remember she said that she hasn't listened to the YoGPoD. Besides, she brought up Blackrock herself in this video and she has said that she has run out of movies to watch on Netflix, so maybe.... maybe... :)"

yogscastkim,38x6yg,RGPFerrous,2,Sun Jun 7 16:57:53 2015 UTC,"There is a vast world of weird erotica out there. There used to be (might still be) a Tumblr documenting them. Ones I remember were for example this one about weredeer (nsfw cover!) and all the things ""Chuck Tingle"" writes including ""My Ass Is Haunted By The Gay Unicorn Colonel"". Another one that caught my eye was ""Taken by the Tetris Blocks: An Erotic Short Story (Digital Desires Book 1)""  Which made me think that there is probably erotic fiction with anything you can imagine."
yogscastkim,38x6yg,cannotfoolowls,2,Mon Jun 8 15:33:37 2015 UTC,"That is a deep dark rabbit hole.  Not only is there erotic fiction of everything you could possibly imagine, there is just as much that you couldn't have conceived.  Much like the unspeakable horrors of H.P. Lovecraft."

yogscastkim,38x6yg,zakarranda,4,Sun Jun 7 20:00:13 2015 UTC,"Shifter erotica? That's nothing! Just look up on Amazon anything by Christie Sims. With such inspired titles like ""Seized by the T-Rex"" and ""Bred by the Ogre King"" how can you not refuse?  Heck I even found some in audiobook form."
yogscastkim,38x6yg,Beeronious,3,Mon Jun 8 10:41:18 2015 UTC,"So... I'm not even gonna effin' lie about this. Judge if you like, but I dare you to take a damn deep dark look inside yourself and every single hobby of yours is clean as a whistle.  The Kate Daniels series by Ilona Andrews. It's got it all. Strong female protagonist (and when I mean strong, I mean both well-rounded and ""forbidden words uttered and people die,"") viciously gory monster hunting, witty bants, magic, mystery, on point folklore, fleshed out worldbuilding, skin-crawly monsters...  and the Atlanta, GA chapter leader of werefolk is a grumpy, stressed out were-lion who can't decide if he wants to date Kate or bat her head off her shoulders."

yogscastkim,38x6yg,hazzer99x,2,Sun Jun 7 21:34:07 2015 UTC,"If you ever need a break from all this shifter romance nonsense and want to pick up something more believable I suggest the Air Force Gator series by Giant Bomb's Dan Ryckert.

yogscastkim,38x6yg,stayinyourlaneson,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:08:08 2015 UTC,"Paranormal or Supernatural romance is hot right now in the publishing industry.  So yes, there is zombie softcore, Griffin softcore and probably Naga softcore if you dug deep enough.  Quality-wise, it mostly varies between trite, cliche romance tarted up with Anne Rice trappings to the average True Blood or Supernatural episode.  If you want decent shifter romance, (where you don't want to beat most characters to death with a wet towel) try Patricia Briggs, Ilona Andrews or Kelly Armstrong.  I'm not into horror, but I would recommend Simon R Green, his most recent series' fall somewhere between Pratchett, Lovecraft and Bioshock Infinite."

yogscastkim,38x6yg,kimichitsuzuku,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:26:25 2015 UTC,"It's probably 50 Shades of shitfu**ing Grey inspired fafiction. I mean, when you go into the Were-genre, you'll find 2.7% of good writing and 97.3% of fappery and shit. For those over 90% the werecreature is a instinct-driven sexmachine, set to Fuck everything in it's path. remind me of the Wolf Within. That was bloody terrible. It was like ""Duncan McGuire is a monster Hunter. His aim is to protect the world from monsters like werewolves and vampires, in the name of the secret organisation [insert name here]. But fuck you, because if you were expecting monster hunting from a guy who's turned into a monster, you're not getting that. Instead we'll introduce the nurse who is a vampire, but that little fact is a secret. I mean, we're only trying to hint at it with the gracefulness of a drunken rapist. We will shove your face right into that fact, but don't worry, it's still a secret.""  I myself am currently writing a book. Started six years ago and worked it over and over and over.  What you'll find in the formerly mentioned 90% is the bare Fucking minimum.  It's a one time scribble slapped in your face with the words: Here you go. I want you to read this. I want you to listen to me, even though I have nothing to say.  At least these books are for free. Because charging anyone for them, like The Wolf Within, it's nothing short of a crime towards your readers."

yogscastkim,38tem8,Barnabus_Bot,4,Sat Jun 6 17:37:08 2015 UTC,"So, someone seems to have disabled the forced progression for the Twilight Forest on their server, otherwise they would have encountered a heavy snow storm with slowness debuff in the ice area due to not having required achivements unlocked. How are they ever supposed to learn/know stuff when they play by different rules than default? I can understand that not everyone likes certain features mod authors come up with but in my opinion one should have experienced those features at least once (preferably in a successfull manner) before they circumvent them. No wonder Duncan thinks this adventurous designed mod is vastly unfinished with a major feature he doesn't know of being turned off..."
yogscastkim,38tem8,PintsizedPint,6,Sat Jun 6 18:48:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's turned off.  Sjin & Lewis went to the Twilight Forest in DruidZ, and I believe that Sjin suffered those effects nearby the boss-areas."
yogscastkim,38tem8,Latorata,3,Sat Jun 6 19:04:54 2015 UTC,Didn't they kill the Naga almost immediately though? And Kim got blindness in that dark forest in the previous episode
yogscastkim,38tem8,Vamprat,4,Sat Jun 6 21:17:40 2015 UTC,If the progression is not disabled then they messed it up in some other way I guess. The boss progression order is as follows: Naga -> Lich -> Minoshroom Maze (unlocks swamp area) -> Hydra (unlocks dark forest area) -> Knight Phantoms  -> Ur-Ghast (unlocks icy area) -> Yetis -> Snow Queen (unlocks troll area) -> Giants and Trolls (unlocks thorn castle area) -> WIP thorn castle needing various items to get the achievements one after another.

yogscastkim,38pmzg,Bartjn,5,Sat Jun 6 18:02:11 2015 UTC,"Copying what I said on my blog about this:  I mean we’ve had ‘errors’ with the skin viewer before. (You know, with the whole fluxy thing which I missed because I was asleep. It’s up to you whether you believe the Yogs when they said they were errors or someone was legit trolling.)  In all honesty, I kind of hope that this is not legit? And maybe this is a bit petty, but it’s simply because I think it looks terrible :c  I mean, KD went out of his way to make Nano’s sapphire the only sapphire on the whole server (except for nether sapphire ore and stuff), why would Echo have one? I don’t approve :(  Also whoever changed it, just turned her flux into a uniform red. Which is supposed to be blood, I guess? Either way, it looks awful. And don’t get me started on the eye, which is the most obnoxious red I’ve ever seen.  The worst thing is, they missed a flux pixel. And there's also a pixel coloured red which was part of her hair. The red of the blood also blends way too much with her cheongsam to look any kind of decent."
yogscastkim,38pmzg,Aeverelle,14,Fri Jun 5 19:56:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's another weird bug. Haven't changed my skin in ages. Promise! And like you say, this one is just ugggggly."

yogscastkim,38jmcx,Barnabus_Bot,7,Thu Jun 4 17:37:06 2015 UTC,"Kim, since you're saying youre going to the twilight forest, heres a tip, since Lewis and Sjin were annoying me in Druids :P : in the new 1.7.10 twilight forest, youll have to follow the twilight achievments (escape, achievments, scroll through with the button on the botton left if you didnt know how to see mod chieves), starting with opening the portal, making a magic map and then starting with the naga. Youll both have to compelete these chieves or you wont be able to acces certain areas and biomes, or you will get severe debuffs when you enter them. Remember: after you kill them, make sure you get their drops, since they are a chieve too (4 example after Naga Slayer where you need to kill a Naga, you have to collect its trophy, and then its scales in that order) P.S. Duncans lightning gun counts as a natural lightning death, so you wont get a chieve AND the boss wont drop anything. You should do another Monster hunters with these new rules when Simon gets better, cuz there some new interesting bosses there that would be interesting to see you do XD Hope I helped! (and sorry for the wall of text :P)"

Unfortunately one of her brothers did not survive because he was too dehydrated weak by the time they were found. The wonderful woman who found them did everything she could to get them healthy again but was unable to keep them because she was pregnant and had a toddler as well. Nano and her sister were the two remaining when we contacted her and they were so bonded we didn't have the heart to separate them. They are now 5 and a half weeks old so we are still bottle feeding them formula but they appear to be happy happy and healthy.  I chose the name Nano (not only because of my admiration of kim) because she's so little and hyper and independent.  Thanks for listening!"

(1.5 hours * 40mph)  From this point both trains are running.  400 miles - 60 = 340 miles (distance to cover). Train X will need to cover 40% * 340 miles = 136 miles Train Y will need to cover 60% * 340 miles = 204 miles  It will take them 3.4 hours (3 hours and 24 minutes) from 6h30 to reach eachother.

Have the tracks been upgraded recently, but only in one direction? Is train X actually a dated model that should be put out of service due to safety concerns? Or is it simply a devious scheme from the train company to get people to pay extra to use the fast train?"
yogscastkim,387588,olorin_aiwendil,21,Tue Jun 2 10:39:17 2015 UTC,He's clearly based the trains on the UK train system. Will a train turn up? Who knows? On time? Probably not. Cancelled last minute? Sure. Leaf on the line? NO TRAINS FOR A WEEK.
yogscastkim,387588,jonsp1170,3,Tue Jun 2 11:14:22 2015 UTC,"Sooooo obviously a trick question.  First, train X was on the West Coast Main Line, traveling from Glasgow to London, so the distance was more accurately 399 miles, not 400.  Second, train Y never met train X, because train X disappeared.  You see, train X wasn't actually traveling slowly. Forty miles per hour was its average speed between 5 pm and 6:39 pm, when station logs officially note that contact was lost. The train actually stopped at about 6:06 pm, an hour and six minutes out of Glasgow, because a porter had discovered the body of one of the passengers--Professor Miles Throckmorton, of the University College London Institute of Archeaology--in the baggage car.  The body's condition was ... odd. Its eyes were shriveled and sunken--dry, funguous nuggets wedged in the back of gaping sockets--and its mouth was stretched so unnaturally wide in what seemed to be an expression of shrieking terror that the jaw had actually come unhinged.  Also, its skin had somehow petrified. When the panicking porter tripped over the corpse in his scramble to escape the baggage car, a large section of its cheek crumbled away in sharp, stoney flakes.  The (needless to say extremely shaken) porter informed the conductor, who immediately ordered the baggage car closed and stopped the train to investigate for himself. He then called Glasgow Central at 6:18 pm, asking for instructions. When the station called back at around 6:25, train X did not respond. For the next twenty minutes, the station tried without success to contact the train, finally sending another engine down the line to find it, but there was no sign of train X. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch was called in and the entire 399 mile length of track, as well as the surrounding area, was thoroughly searched, but the train, along with its 83 passengers and crew, was never found.  A few interesting things about the case:  According to the UCL Institute of Archaeology, Professor Throckmorton was returning from a visit to their Qatar campus. An archaeological dig in the area had uncovered some unusual artifacts, and the professor was so amazed by what they had found that he took it upon himself to personally transport what he considered the most startling piece back to London. The only description of the artifact comes from Throckmorton's last e-mail to Professor Pamela Chastaine, a colleague at the University. ""The fellow is astoundingly and disturbingly grotesque, carved with a precision and technical aptitude exceeding anything previously seen from this period. I'm not sure which possibility frightens me more: that it will turn out to be a masterful hoax, or that it will not.""  No photographs of the artifact exist. Apparently, all the cameras used to photograph the find were exposed to some sort of powerful static or magnetic discharge, which destroyed the SD cards.  It might also be worth noting that the conductor, in his last communication with the station, mentioned that the Professor's corpse was clutching a metal case about the size of a shoebox, ""hugging it so hard they're going to have to cut off his arms to get it loose.""  And finally, the last trick in the trick question: if you've been following along and doing your math, you might have noted where train X was when Glasgow Central lost contact--almost exactly 66 miles from Glasgow and 333 miles from London."

yogscastkim,387588,Mutantoe,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:43:34 2015 UTC,"The best thing you can do to help (coming from someone who overcame social anxiety after many years of struggling) is to stand by them and help them out every now and again. Invite them to join in small conversations, back them up if they find it hard, praise their input (where appropriate) and don't be afraid to swoop in and sieze the attention if they start to struggle. Half the battle is actually getting into a conversation in the first place, once you're there you start to learn how conversation flow works and all the other nuances that come with it.  If it's really bad, consider seeking medical advice. Many people overcome their anxiety on their own, but seeing a psychologist may also help.  I don't know how much of a confident person you are, but I will say one thing from personal experience: If someone talks over your friend, call them out on it, shut them down and then hand the discussion back to your friend if they want it, and change the topic if they don't. Nothing crushes self esteem like being talked over. Even a simple ""Excuse me, I don't think Friend Name was finished talking. (Turn to friend) Did you have something else to say?"" can help them get a handle back on the conversation when that happens."

In particular:   redstone - red cryothium - blue blazing pyrothium - orange glowstone - yellow (flows upward however) enderium - teal/green coal - black   I think some Tinker's Construct liquid metals can also be dumped into the overworld, but I haven't tried it. (maaaybe by piping the smeltery into a transposer? crazy speculation at this point)  Overall though, you can still get quite the variety of flowing liquids to make for a rainbow volcano if you really wanted to.

Perhaps we could remove some mods like biomes o'plenty from the modpack, as most people only use it for a few extra biomes while it takes up loads of space for loading dozens of other biomes that are unused/uninhabitable. Archaeology should probably be gone as well, as only a few people used it, the dinosaurs lagged said players (me included) to hell, and they only caused more lag by breeding when there were 2+ of the same species (especially raptors, those things were like kinky rabbits).   Perhaps Flaxbeard should go as well? I don't know about you guys, but I couldn't really find much to do with steam power other than fueling the jetpacks, and they weren't that great in regards to their shelf life.   Basically any mod notorious for causing massive lag, I'd advise that we search for alternatives within RR3 that do largely the same tasks as those mods."

Down here in Australia we have a weekly show called Pop Asia which is a music video show featuring Asian Pop. This show was a gateway into the genre. Honestly, most of it is me and my wife just snarking the music videos MST3K style.  However, I LOVE Big Bang and the show allowed me to discover Gangam Style weeks before it got big in the west. That gave me a hipster feeling.  I’ve also got a name for a sub-genre of K-Pop called “Line groups”. This is a very popular music video format primarily used for K-pop groups. The video usually has the females provocatively dressed, standing in a single line, gyrating in a sexualized manner. The camera will perform close-ups of each member, one at a time. Furthermore, they will change costumes while all dancing in the same line. I know a similar thing is popular in other regions, but the shot-by-shot similarity is very, very noticeable in K-Pop."

yogscastkim,37m2gs,Sightshade,6,Thu May 28 21:14:37 2015 UTC,"/u/nanosounds Don't get fooled by Duncan's missing knowledge. The Deep Dark is like he said pretty deep and dark but it also has double the amount of ore than the overworld. Obviously great for setting up quarries, the downsides are negligible (darkness starts to hurt after a while, mobs have more hp). Also since it's a dark and fairly flat place, it is great for getting Thaumcraft aura nodes.  A few things that might be useful/interesting to make with the unstable ingots: - Ineffable/Ethereal Glass playes can pass through but other entities can't, useful as door/fence replacement or for mob farms, if you ever make one - Etheric Sword to get a Soul Fragment, takes away 10% of your hp permanently but you can make a reinforced watering can with it, though you'll probably won't need it since you don't automate farms etc - Unstable Ingot Block can be used to make the so called ""Impossible Object"", a wonderful thing for decoration especially when combined with other stuff. Speaking of decoration, it would be nice to see some more non-vanilla blocks (e.g. Chisel 2 etc) used for further base building. - Builder's Wand like Duncan said very useful for building (*coughnano'svillagecough*).  The tools all still have their fancy names but apart from the Healing Axe they got stripped of their special abilities in a patch not long ago, making them 'just' diamond tools with infinite durability.  Also the Tinker's smeltery (Portable Tank on a drain) or an Igneous Extruder from Thermal expansion need way less effort and time to aquire obsidian than your suboptimal Tinker's tools. My favorite method is AE2's Anihilation Plane + BM's Ritual of the Serengating Nether producing 20 obsidian per second. Anway a Ring of Magnetization is generally a great help getting items in tricky situations like mining over lava!"
yogscastkim,37m2gs,PintsizedPint,3,Thu May 28 17:29:55 2015 UTC,"Hey, diamond tools with infinite durability isn't bad, though.  And honestly the abilities weren't great, except for the Hoe of Reversal."

yogscastkim,37m2gs,PintsizedPint,1 point,Thu May 28 20:02:25 2015 UTC,Yeah but it was buggy. It didn't work with non-traditional armors or damage reduction methods. Also didn't hit through enchantments on armor. Not nearly as good as a Tinker's Construct rapier.
yogscastkim,37m2gs,T_Weezy,1 point,Sat May 30 01:49:00 2015 UTC,"Fyi since version 1.2.5 of Extra Utilities from a few days ago, there are buffed up versions of the tools when crafted with the stable unstable ingots (now called mobius ingots) from the pseudo-inversion sigil. The Super Builder's Wand existed that way beforehand, but the tools now have special enchantments like efficiency X etc. Also the better version of the etheric sowrd is Kikoku, making it obtainable in singleplayer with more effort but also in a less entertaining way of being a pretty pink princess."

Kim! you don't have to have your wings in the hotbar, only your inventory! Also you can use Ineffable Glass as a ""door"" that lets players in, but not any mobs (since it doesn't allow mobs to go through, only players). Also the Ethereal glass does that too, its just decorated. Also the dark versions don't let light through them.   Also the rings can be in a bauble ring slot, but they are probs in the normal inventory so they don't take the place of a bauble or ring. ALSO, if you do go to the deep dark, bring lots of torches, the darkness kills you, but ore gen is doubled."

Sometimes if you're forgetful it helps to have the crafting overlay from NEI (click the question mark)   And lastly, if you want to be a bit cheaty  Use NEI's automatic crafting utility (shift-clicking the question-mark; might not always work with items that don't stack in your inventory), or, alternatively, As soon as you make an ingot, immediately turn it into nuggets, and craft them back into an ingot.

Chloe reacts negatively to punishment and admonishment (David, Joyce, Blackwell) and positively to sympathy and support (Rachel Amber). She's a broken person, and sees things in black-and-white: action contrary to her, even ones for her benefit, are viewed as attacks. If someone wanted to actually help (whereas both Kim and Hannah seem to have washed their hands of her), they'd have to reinforce Chloe's trust: ""I am your friend, I'm on your side."" Being hard-edged to her would be the same discipline everyone else has meted out.

Now how she gets into the vortex party for those who didn't get on the list is a mystery but it will get sorted.  Also the next episode title is Dark Room, and if you recall from what Chloe finds on the principle's computer Nathan wrote ""Rachel in the dark room"" over and over. I suspect we'll come even closer if not find out what happened to Rachel.  The three pictures at the end give some clue to what will happen, presumably she will visit the beach near the lighthouse. Max will find something on a laptop, I don't recognize the location of it. Then someone will have a gun that is different to the one Chloe stole from David, but the gun looks similiar to some other guns David has. The person is also wearing a long dark sleeve, and there are only a few people who wear something like that. Frank wears a dark jacket that meets the description, and he has reason to be mad with Max and Chloe. David's security outfit also fits the profile and the gun could be one of his, plus he could be angry with Max, or maybe he catches her at school sneaking somewhere. Another option could be Mr. Jefferson, but I haven't looked at his sleeves enough to tell. Other possible suspects are the principle or a police officer, but I believe the two suspects listed are the most likely."

That is, the Moon randomly zipped somewhere it shouldn't be in it's orbit.  The tornado in Max's vision is insignificant compared to this.

yogscastkim,36rp2r,SpaceShipRat,1 point,Fri May 22 20:54:57 2015 UTC,"Neither Hannah nor Kim seem to actually like Chloe, which is a shame. In my playthrough I was steadfastly loyal which made the ending so much more powerful."
yogscastkim,36rp2r,zakarranda,6,Sat May 23 03:32:55 2015 UTC,This is whats really clever about Life is Strange. Devs know that players are going to reload checkpoints/start over so they can get the ending they want so why not turn it into a game mechanic. I rewound decisions 2 or 3 times just because i couldn't decide on which choice i liked more (credit to the writers). I wouldn't be surprised to see more games in this style adapt the time rewind just for this purpose.
yogscastkim,36rp2r,theomega000,1 point,Thu May 21 16:53:19 2015 UTC,"I do that too, sometimes I like my first choice but I'll jet want to see what happened with the other choice so I'll rewind and then rewind again to go back to my first choice lol"
yogscastkim,36rp2r,Wndrlndgabby,1 point,Thu May 21 23:36:00 2015 UTC,We need a name for this. Life is Strange Syndrome? ALL OF THE DIALOGS! I like how Chloe starts calling you out on it. Especially when she begs you not to rewind the kiss X-) Edit: Formatting is hard :-(
yogscastkim,36rp2r,zakarranda,3,Sat May 23 03:41:37 2015 UTC,That was a difficult choice to make but I think you chose well. David is just doing stuff a bit wrong but he want to help.

yogscastkim,36rp2r,JDIrrelevant,3,Thu May 21 16:41:24 2015 UTC,"Well Kim did miss some dialogue with Chloe, if you talk to her after you kiss her she will admit ""I don't think anyone is good enough for you, besides me"". This has multiple interpretations of course, but it could support a possible romance choice between Chloe and Warren later on. Since if you accept the date with Warren, Max writes in her diary that she now has to think of an excuse to get out if it."
yogscastkim,36rp2r,virgash,1 point,Thu May 21 16:57:10 2015 UTC,"I sided with David as well, I mean he was right with his suspicions on Rachel that she was carrying drugs. I don't agree with what he did with Kate, but if he had asked her if anything was wrong instead of accusing her of using drugs because of her unusual behavior I'd think he was a great security officer."
yogscastkim,36rp2r,virgash,1 point,Thu May 21 16:47:47 2015 UTC,"Kim had a good point though, one I didn't think of in my playthrough, that Nathan might have planted the drugs on her."
yogscastkim,36rp2r,zakarranda,1 point,Sat May 23 03:29:47 2015 UTC,"True, but I could see her carrying drugs for Frank. Frank sells prescription drugs and weed so the drug type matches up, but Nathan buys his drugs from him so it could still be him planting drugs."

That's so freaking awesome, and I'm looking forward to trying it out. I haven't said anything yet as I'm super busy right now, but I cannot wait for the final version. I was thinking that maybe I could surprise Duncan with it in Flux Buddies? Do you know if it'll work with our RR3 pack? I'm not so good on the technicalities of MC, as you know :/ But yeah - AMAZING WORK!"

Its a 1.8 Mod, not a 1.7.10 mod. However, its not impossible for me to backport it. Once I get done implementing any sound effects and particles, I will see if I can backport it to 1.7.10."

yogscastkim,36q52z,OmegaX123,1 point,Thu May 21 16:21:41 2015 UTC,"If you do back-port it, you should think about talking to either the ""Superheroes Unlimited"" or ""Project Superhuman"" devs and see if you can work out an alliance (those mods sorely need something like an Infinity Gauntlet, being centered around the superhero 'ecosystem', and who better to do it than someone who's already doing it anyway?), possibly."

Since he couldn't go up stairs he got a key to the school elevator (off limits to normal students), but after his leg healed he kept it and we would use the elevator at our leisure.  Also I used a women's bathroom recently, and I had a hard time leaving all of the beautiful scenery. I never knew they had a Japanese garden with a koi pond in them. The smell of all of the plants was incredible, and I was surprised by the huge selection of wine in there. I understand why there was a queue for yours Kim."

Not to mention Kate's big scene at the end of that same chapter.  Another 80s child! 82 here, I won't ask you to reveal your year (both because of privacy reasons, the whole 'never ask a lady her age', and to a lesser extent due to the running joke among the fandom), but it's cool to know that one of my favourite YouTubers (at least one) was born in the same general 'era' so to speak."

yogscastkim,36i9n9,Jessica_T,5,Wed May 20 02:05:54 2015 UTC,"I'll list the differences I remember, but I may forget a few.   Kim took the blame for weed in Chloe's room in ep. 1 while Hannah stayed hidden. Kim signed the petition for no new surveillance cameras in ep. 1 and Hannah didn't. Kim watered Lisa the plant too much and killed her, and Hannah kept her alive. Kim answered Kate's phone call in ep. 2 and Hannah didn't. Kim doesn't try to shoot Frank so he gets the gun, while Hannah did try to shoot him so Chloe still has the gun. Kim managed to save Kate and in Hannah's playthrough Kate dies.   That should be all of the major ones, but I might be missing some of the smaller ones like writing on a wall."

Would have wanted to vote up both Flux buddies and Nano's Village (as I'm sure many kim followers would), which explains Nano's village's comparatively low score. I personally think Nano's village is  a really good place to show off some of the other yogs (hopefully including some of the less well known ones), and basically have a good chat with some building going on in the background."

yogscastkim,36cww5,Skuttleoz,8,Mon May 18 11:26:28 2015 UTC,"The brilliant thing about Pratchett is that there isn't really a place to start. His books are sort of split into groups of people that he focuses on, and sometimes those people overlap. So, roughly, there's the Rincewind and the Wizards series, the Witches series, the Death series, The Watch series (ie.e Policemen), The Post Office (Moist Von Lipwig) series, and various books in between....so really you can jump in with the group you think you might like best to start with? As, if you have a preference for wizards, or Death or watchmen, etc.  If you start with Rincewind and the Wizards, it begins with The Colour of Magic, then Light Fantastic, Sourcery, Eric, Moving Pictures (sort of), Interesting Times, The Last Continent, Unseen Academicals  For the Witches (love Granny Weatherwax!), Equal Rites, Wyrd Sisters, Witches Abroad, Lords and Ladies, Maskerade, Carpe Jugulum...and then the whole Tiffany Aching spin off, starting with the Wee Free Men, A Hat Full of Sky, Wintersmith, I Shall Wear Midnight and the yet unreleased Shepard's Crown (this was written for young adults, but still is a fantastic read for adults!)  For Death, it's Mort, Reaper Man, Soul Music, Hogfather and Thief of Time (although he appears in many other stories)   For the Watch (my favourite series after the Witches), it's Guards Guards!, Men at Arms, Feet of Clay, Jingo, The Fifth Elephant, Night Watch, Thud! and Snuff.   For Moist Von Lipwig, it's Going Postal, Making Money and Raising Steam - these are definitely best to read after you've done most of the Watch series, as they make a lot more sense after you see Ankj-Morpork grow.   There's also several one off books involving amazing characters like William de Worde, Polly, Brutha (and a lot of the more familiar characters), like The Truth, Small Gods, Pyramids, Monstrous Regiment (highly recommend, but after you've read the Watch stuff!)  The Colour of Magic and Light Fantastic are great, but personally, I find they sit a little outside of what Discworld became, because they literally are the first two novels, written 30 years ago, and you can see how Pratchett started forming his ideas for Discworld and it's inhabitants, so it's a little raw. That's not to say they're bad or anything - it's just amazing to see Discworld evolve and flesh out over the years, and going back to these first two...it felt different.  My first Discworld book was actually Mort - which is technically the first book in the 'Death' series and the fourth Discworld book written by Pratchett.  So uh...yeah....good luck!"
yogscastkim,36cww5,nanosounds,2,Mon May 18 13:37:33 2015 UTC,"THANK YOU. I've been looking for a reading order (because I'd been wanting to pick up the books, between hearing good things from a teacher I had in high school and catching but not quite getting yours and Duncan's references, for years, but moreso since I heard Sir Pterry had passed), but putting it off because I didn't know where to start because there were so many and no clearly-labeled 'Book 1 in the XYZ Series' part. It's like if I had heard about the Wheel of Time series but didn't know that ""The Eye of the World"" (or ""New Spring"" if you want to start at the beginning of the story rather than the beginning of the series) was the first book, I never would have started out of intimidation that I might start at the wrong point (though I almost regret having started now, because the books are so long individually and I can never track down anything newer than Book 7 to read)."
yogscastkim,36cww5,OmegaX123,2,Tue May 19 19:08:56 2015 UTC,"Start with ""The Colour of Magic"" and ""The Light Fantastic"". It's a two parter that basically captures the very essence of Pratchett."

As for the computers, according to the logs it's NOT a person doing it. It's possibly related to this reported (and as of now, unfixed) issue: https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/issues/1074  I've enabled chunk-loaders working whilst players are offline, but time will tell if that causes too many issues with lag to be a reasonable fix. The only solution I can think of other than that is to do away with security terminals on your AE systems and see if that helps."

(That said, the Latin for wolf is ""lupus"" and the feminine form is apparently ""lupa"", so I guess it can be made to work with Spanish diminutives, but then it'd be neither pure Spanish nor Latin. )  I'd also like to point out that ""lupa"" means ""magnifying glass"" in Spanish, so ""lupita"" can be either a diminutive for ""Lupe"", or a little magnifying glass, your pick. :p"

yogscastkim,3682un,fluxeduptotoro,11,Sun May 17 02:01:22 2015 UTC,"Eh. My advice would be to wait for a liiiittle bit more. As Kim explained in one of her Ask Kim's (the one about storylines and shipping), they previously were in a position that made it hard to do plot stuff, as they were still setting themselves up on the server. It's kind of hard to make plot happen when you don't have good gear and a nice base imo.  But they've recently gotten past the setting up phase, and boy I've noticed. The two episodes where Lalnable (?) was like 'yoohoo! I've come to take some of your hair!' were really well done, and it certainly won't be the last we'll see of him. On top of that, it's only the session after that, and Kim's already teasing us with backstory for Nano. And since that includes Strawfingers, there's going to be some Thaumcraft/Magic/Flux involved, probably.  But I will agree I do also sort of miss the random moments where Nano would wander into tainted lands by accident and just completely zone out. I'm also still waiting patiently for Lalna to go into creepy mode as well... I need that in my life.  tldr; Good things come to those who wait ;)"

So - ""Platinum's big secret is that it is fast - it'll instant-mine almost anything, and when used as a component in a tool its base and maximum speed will shoot up - although never as high as a pure Platinum tool head. Mixing Platinum, Tartarite and Thaumium into your tool has proven to have the best results - get Obsidian in there if you can for an even greater benefit. You should always make the tool rod out of Thaumium, as it's a not-crap version of Paper, essentially. The tool head should be a Tartarite/Platinum blend, with the Tartarite being used for the main part to grant its max mining level to the tool. This will be nowhere near as durable as a pure Tartarite head, but it'll still be so high you'll never notice."" - Quoted from Velotican (/user/Velotican) <-- His profile and stuff. So - To break that down - Always use tartarite as the main head of the tool. For large plates, use platinum because speed. Here we go... Thaumium - A non crap version of paper. Which is good!  For weapons -  Use tartarite heads + paper tool rod and handguards. Then deck it out with a gold block and diamond which will give you another modification. So... Max it out with quartz.

yogscastkim,35ulik,SlayerOfDerp,2,Thu May 14 08:59:21 2015 UTC,Either that or think the door is bugged and break the door.
yogscastkim,35ulik,Treya7,2,Thu May 14 10:57:21 2015 UTC,"This is entirely accurate except for one thing... If someone has a Mystic branch and has successfully applied a Rite of Infusion to themselves they can draw symbols into the air and produce limited magical effects. Each effect will drain a specific amount of their infused power. Also certain symbols may be inaccessible depending on the type of infusion the player has. One particular effect which the witchcraft:symbology book calls Alohomora (I wonder where they got that from) is able to open locked Rowan doors. There is another effect in the book called Cave Inimicum that is said to ""strengthen a block"". Also on the flip side of Alohomora is the effect Colloportus which changes a regular wooden door to a locked Rowan door.   I'm sorry if this was a bit long but I wanted to be accurate with my information as well as show that it isn't technically foolproof in guarding your base however if you mixed Rowan doors from witchery with the Arcane doors from Thaumcraft (where you can use the iron or gold key access to limit who can open the door and give permission to others to open the door) you can have two doors that cannot be easily opened and with the thaumcraft door can only be broken by the person who put it there using a wand.   So now that I'm hopefully done rambling it might be Kim and Duncan's best bet to mix both witchery and thaumcraft in order to protect their base from those unsavory characters.   I hope this is helpful to anyone else who might need this knowledge!"

yogscastkim,35i658,yawndor,1 point,Mon May 11 03:50:49 2015 UTC,"I think so. The community refers to the packs as ""3D Texture Packs"", and 3D textures must have been derived from that.  EDIT: Not that there's any detail about the changes to the resource pack code on the change logs but all of the instructions that I've found refer to snapshot 14w30a and later. Which is 1.7.10.

I think it wasn't Duncan having too much coffee today, it was Kim not having enough grape soda.  Also, this Duncan looks less ""Fluxy"", and more ""covered in grape jam so as to look like flux.""  Well, he's not Mister Hector, who would both know Discworld references and know how to make a jetpack run on testificate children's screams, so Kim should be alright.

yogscastkim,35i658,Tsuki_no_Mai,8,Sun May 10 19:07:51 2015 UTC,They could easily have made a reinforced tank if running out of steam was their concern.

yogscastkim,35ibv5,Barnabus_Bot,3,Sun May 10 17:37:07 2015 UTC,"Since Kim was asking about how Were!Ross became a thing today: There are actually quite a few references in different series that point at him potentially being a werewolf - including him actually being attacked by a werewolf in their FTB series and him starting to howl. A few of us Hatters got together a while back and made a list of the references so you can take a look at that if you wish. But yeah, the idea first became popular a while ago on Tumblr after someone suggested that the reason Ross was so hairy was because he was a werewolf (I believe this comment happened around the time that his interaction happened with the werewolf in FTB) and after we started to see all the other references, a lot of people jumped on board with the idea."

That handle goes to a 2x2 floor hatch that animates open and closed.   The mod also has smooth opening doors, sliding doors, and multi-directional doors. Additionally it has a custom door maker so you design how it opens, how fast it opens, what textures each part has and what it's called.  Oh and as an additional door related note Kim, you can get the sag mill out of the sky door by breaking it. In the future it's best to throw blocks on carpenters doors right from the start to prevent stuff like that from happening."
yogscastkim,35ibv5,M_Soothsayer,0,Mon May 11 21:49:55 2015 UTC,"Stevia is OK. It's basically a natural plant sugar. It's not a vat-manufactured chemical like aspartame. It tastes a bit like aspartame but a bit more planty, and it has an interesting aftertaste. I don't like non-sugar sweeteners but in coffee I use half the sugar I usually do and use stevia to make up for the rest of the sweetness. The sugar really takes the edge off the stevia and it nearly as good as using all sugar."
yogscastkim,35ibv5,Ace0fSwords,3,Sun May 10 20:58:30 2015 UTC,"The sugar being bad enough, it's the fizz that rots teeth. Fizzy drinks were my main thirst quencher for a long time and I have so many caps because of it.  And after I switched to water I dropped 15kg just because of all the sugar that's missing from my diet now and I haven't had a hole in any tooth since. PS. Tried doing the sugar-free fizzy drinks for a time but my teeth just kept on getting more tiny holes."

yogscastkim,35ibv5,PyroHiroshi,2,Mon May 11 18:00:05 2015 UTC,"De-gassing of a sparkling mineral water reduced its dissolution, but the total levels were still relatively low suggesting that carbonation of drinks may not be an important factor per se in respect of erosive potential."

yogscastkim,35ibv5,Thorondor123,1 point,Mon May 11 12:25:05 2015 UTC,"Solid point. However, lets not forget that a lot of naturally occurring plant 'chemicals' have been tested over dozens of generations by the people that use them. Many other chemicals which are manufactured in labs have a bit less testing (i'm talking super long term), and there is more profit-driven reason to suppress or downplay any information that it may be harmful side effects. Maybe i'm just being overly cautious and being influenced by the (possible) myths that certain artificial sweeteners have detrimental long-term effects, but i'd honestly rather be safe than sorry."

yogscastkim,35etom,Dunkleberry,4,Sat May 9 18:00:28 2015 UTC,"Kim, you should work on making some Botania bows for you and duncan, to help you deal with those ridiculous mobs at a distance where they can't get at you.  Also, try making bigger tanks for your jetpacks.  If I remember correctly, when you made them you just put regular tanks in them, which is why they don't last very long.  I have a big tank in mine and I hardly ever have to refill it."
yogscastkim,35etom,alternisidentitatum,3,Sat May 9 22:14:47 2015 UTC,"Kim, tell Duncan that he can make Magma Cream using 1 Blaze Powder, and 1 Slime ball. It's easier than attempting to find Magma Cubes in the Nether"
yogscastkim,35etom,The_Comet,3,Sat May 9 23:44:46 2015 UTC,"Instead of making the next variant of sodding jetpacks you should jump to something superior like the ""Flügel Tiara"" from Botania (or Extra Utilities' ""Angel Ring"" if you managed to get nether stars and a division sigil from the Wither). Fighting the first version of the Gaia guardian shouldn't be a problem for you! Just build the portal to Alfheim, get full elementium equipment (pixies are helpful in the fight), let Duncan make you some healing potions and you're good to go."
yogscastkim,35etom,PintsizedPint,2,Sat May 9 18:40:06 2015 UTC,"So that lightning gun Duncan saw is the ""lightning red"" from quiverbow and in my opinion one of the best weapons from that mod. It only needs iron and a bit of nether quartz to build, it uses redstone for ammo and will one shot most vanilla mobs (as well as being super cool coz hey lightning powers).  Also Kim make Tectonic Girdles! They stop all knockback and dont need mana, this makes skeletons 10,000 times less annoying especially while flying."

yogscastkim,356wh5,yawndor,2,Thu May 7 18:21:32 2015 UTC,"They might be unpleased to find out it only works if difficulty is set to peaceful. But yeah, wither can be dealt with as long as you have good armor, good swords, and a jetpack.   A TiCon crossbow is also great for killing withers but they're not intuitive to make, for example not all materials are good crossbow materials, NEI covers/superimposes itself over the crafting pattern recipes for fletchings/strings (which means you need to press 'o' to temporarily hide NEI), and the bolts are tool rods that need to be put on a casting table and have a metal poured over them (steel works best as the coating)."
yogscastkim,356wh5,Ace0fSwords,3,Thu May 7 21:06:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah but smite crossbow bolts can do over 100 damage to the wither per shot.  Totes worth it.  And combined with the steam helmet zoom it's like having a machine gun sniper rifle.  Babby's first crossbow: Blue slime crossbow limb, paper tough binding, thaumium or blue slime stock, flamestring bowstring.  Bolts: Thaumium tool rod with manyullyn (or failing that, steel) poured over, and slime fletching.    Modifiers: Add redstone to bow until you get at or near .25 sec redraw.  Add moss only to the bolts (bows bug out with moss), and then max them out with quartz or consecrated soil for sharpness or smite, respectively.  Any leftover bow modifiers are optional, say lapis or a hardened energy cell."

yogscastkim,34ulwe,Barnabus_Bot,4,Mon May 4 18:17:14 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with just about everything Kim said during her credits rant thing. The wiring puzzles were pretty much the epitome of bad point and click trial and error gameplay, the locations were pretty much the same ones as in part 1, and the ending was a complete letdown with pretty much no resolution. There's still the big plague dam, which now everyone can get to thanks to the convenient bridge.   Its strange to say this about a part 2 that came out almost a year after part 1, and a game that was supposed to be 1 part in the first place, but this feels rushed and the writer/writers backed into a corner by deadlines. If it were any other company I would think this was a very clumsy way to allow themselves a sequel"
yogscastkim,34ulwe,theomega000,4,Mon May 4 18:32:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with that the ending was rather ... disappointing, but I completely disagree about the wiring puzzle if the wiring works the way it seems to work as in: each node you attach wire to gives of a symbol when placed into the ""charger"" you could simply do this and this would give a similar outcome to the one I made and now you know the symbol for each node and you can jot it down on a piece of paper or a paint program and easily wire up the hexa-pals, there is logic behind the wiring you just have to find it."

yogscastkim,34ulwe,SpaceShipRat,1 point,Tue May 5 12:38:52 2015 UTC,"Wow, good thing I never bought into this game at all. I thought everyone was over-exaggerating in the reviews for Part 2 but the criticism was all on point:    The only new environment art that isn't just a ""phasing"" of a previous location exists either in the last 20 minutes or in cutscenes.  The puzzles went from a simple ""match the key with the hole"" deal to ""scour every last inch for a diagram that tells you the answer."" The character switching went from a neat feature that let the player change perspectives with the agency to set their own pace for the story, to a forced gimmick needed to complete the puzzles...   How? How after delaying the 2nd act for more than a year could Tim Schafer of all people not come up with something better than this?  The ending doesn't even give us any closure: our two protagonists just stare at each other and smile before it cuts to the credits screen with only some doodles to give us a general idea of what happened to everyone afterwards.  And a personal pet peeve of mine: Who else found Vella's voice acting to be just...off? It's not like the the sound quality was bad but every line had this stilted delivery that just made the conversations feel completely unnatural. Yes I'm nitpicking here, but when you have Jennifer Hale in your supporting cast on top of Jack Black and Wil Wheaton playing SIDE characters, the fact that the main heroine's voice doesn't hold up in comparison is sooo jarring.

What was the point of a game where you can switch characters on the fly, if you don't make use of that feature? I thought it was silly how you could solve the first one character at a time, I kept expecting a mechanic like this to come into play.   I do agree that after not doing it in act one, it was nasty to just spring puzzles that can't be solved with one character, on players by then weren't expecting it."
yogscastkim,34ulwe,SpaceShipRat,1 point,Wed May 6 22:27:09 2015 UTC,"True, a mechanic that never needs to be used to progress can feel like a pointless feature: I think the sentiment the developers must have obviously had to make the character swapping more integral to the core gameplay in Act 2 was well-placed in this regard.  How the actual implementation of that change came about is what I take issue with. Leaving aside how unintuitive he logic required is and what the concept does to a player's immersion, (because really, how more contrived can you get than ""Vella looks at a photo of a robot with some diagrams in the background, therefore Shay now knows exactly how to rewire the same robot whilst not being able to communicate with Vella in any way?"") the actual puzzles used as ""walls"" to make you switch are completely inconsistent. I mean you're supposed to help Vella answer a 2-part question about the name of Shay's favourite soft toy by seeing Shay call a snake Mr Huggy, but then you have to answer a 3-part question about Shay's first pair of shoes not one minute later and the only way to get that answer is to go to a different room on the ship and find not the right answer, but all the other wrong answers so you can solve via process of elimination? Or when Vella and Hope are trying to get Mog Chothra to return to the crash site so they can reunite with their families, but the co-ordinates they need are identical to what Alex's ship has for the Plague Dam?"

I assume this is coincidence (since for one thing you didn't mention getting help from Reddit, and for another I still somewhat assume you've recorded in advance), but the first part seemed far too close to my hints from the last episode (even in the right order and - except for talking to Carol and the lumberjack/metalworker in between - directly in sequence), if I didn't have the aforementioned reasons to think otherwise I'd think I helped out with that.  Also, this may just be because I watched it so soon after uploading, but the middle of the video, on the 720p quality version, is corrupted (from ""No, I mean SAND, as in the chief export of this village"" to just before you figure out that you need to give Carol the hook), I had to drop down to 360p to watch it. #firstworldproblems"

That flamethrower skeli made the multishot rocket launcher skelis look like playful puppies.   Really though, this comes from the rather evil combo of infernal mobs + quiverbow. Nothing worse than getting a skeleton with some 100 hp that has 5 different abilities to make your life miserable. Oh wait, lets give it a flamethrower and make it hate everything, so it just assails all your pets before you notice half of them are dead already.

Kim, I dont remember whether or not you investigated wands in witchery before, but I'd highly suggest you do so now if not. Wands can help in more ways than one, like helping to deal with crazy mobs spawing with insane weapons. There are basic wands spells like expelliarmous, that can disarm opponents from a distance, knock opponents back, slow them and more. Plus, if u have no torches, a wand can cast light spells too, never needing torches again. Also, since there arent portal guns in this modpack, I'd suggest using the Spirit of Otherwhere infusion rite on yourselves , giving u both magic to use your wands, and magic to allow u to set spawn points, teleport around like an underman, and more! ;)  I second the werewolves suggestion btw! It could be slow at first to level up but once you are level a fair bit as a werewolf it's epically fun! XD   Have fun and keep up the great videos guys! I enjoy watching the 2 of u!"
yogscastkim,34n2kv,Perkinator221,2,Sat May 2 19:08:57 2015 UTC,"Kim, you need to make bows to deal with these super-mobs.  I'd recommend the ones from Botania, particularly the Crystal Bow, as it uses a small amount of Mana instead of arrows, but even vanilla bows would do.  Enchant them with level 30 enchants, and you'd be able to easily take out any dangerous quiverbow mobs from a distance. Especially with a jetpack, when you can just rain down death from above.  I'd also recommend making some Greater Band of the Auras; while worn they passively recharge a Mana Tablet or Band of Mana in your inventory.  Also, you should right-click on the dinosaurs with a Dinopedia.  It'll tell you if they're hungry (I suspect that's why they're dying.  I don't think the feeders work at all)"

The method to become a vampire is entertaining and you can always remove it with a ritual.  b) You can boost your altar further by replacing the wither skeleton skull with a player head. You could either tell Duncan to hold still or get one via Botania (with Botania you can get the head of anyone you want).  c) There is a really good any easy way of avoiding further death by the tormenting fires of the underworld, it is called a ""Magnum Torch"", it prevents mob spawning in a sphere with a horizontal radius of 64 blocks and vertical of 32."

Emeralds may come in handy if u ever want to make a contract with Witchery Imps. ;) Once befriended, u can give an Imp surplus precious ores like emeralds, diamonds and gold to get special potions and spells allowing u to do nefarious magic, such as CRUCIO! XD Note it will take many ores and you're not garraunteed these rare items. You may only get rarer witchery ingredients like owlets wing, demon blood, or ent twigs for example. Last note! If an Imp yawns, save your ores for another minecraft day. :)   Another long one, sorry! Hope you enjoyed any of these tips! Have a good day!"

So instead of just 3 brews every time, you have a much greater chance of getting 4,5, or 6!  Oh, and if you guys in cornerstone need a greater output of certain mob drops, I'd setup a room with a Minefactory Reloaded auto-spawner and grinder. It's brillaint and in my oppinion an indispensable farm. It can allow you to farm any mob for loot, all that's needed is the desired mob trapped in a Reusable Safari net and mob essence which can be obtained in a few ways. Simplest being from a player using an XP Extractor and a bucket.   Hope you found some of this helpful and interesting! :)"

However, the atomic disassmbler is great - it works as the best possible tool for any job, meaning it's equivalent to the best pickaxe possible (better than Cobalt and Manyullyn).

Tamable dinosaurs are able to see feeders within a 6-block radius. A feeder has two storage levels: one for carnivores, and the other for herbivores. Only certain items are acceptable for conversion to foodstuffs for dinosaurs. Velociraptors will search for a feeder when they are unable to find animals to hunt. The Triceratops will search for a feeder before searching for ferns. T-Rexes, Pachycephalosaurus and Pterosaurs will use feeders as well. The feeder needs to be within 2-blocks of a dinosaurs head in order for them to feed.

That's most likely how the Stegosaurus died! If you want the others to be safe, you have to seperate the Brachiosaurus from them. * Second: Brachiosaurus can't reach a feeder on the ground. It needs to be at the same height as its head. Or better yet: Plant large trees in or just outside the pen. Dinosaurs tend to ignore feeders sometimes, but they don't seem to ever ignore natural food sources."
yogscastkim,34ff5v,RokuroCarisu,2,Thu Apr 30 22:37:31 2015 UTC,"Seconded on the natural food sources.  I've had good luck with apple trees (craft an apple) combined with fern seeds from the fossils mod (they only grow under trees, but grow fast).  I did also make the trees artificially taller by planting them a few blocks up, and then filling in underneath with logs (I thinks it's prettier).  For my carnivores, I have pigs in with them.  Duncan could set up a little pig farm next to each pen with a chronotyper embedded in the wall to sort pigs into the enclosure.  Or just move some in with a lasso.  And of course, all of this would have been a lot easier if Duncan actually knew how to hand feed them!  Right click with an appropriate food, and it feeds and heals them (no need for potions).  He can use the Dinopedia to check what they eat.  Admittedly, I've had trouble doing this with full grown T-rexes, maybe because of their size.  But I've had no luck with feeders or tossing food on the ground.  Best of luck!"

yogscastkim,34ff5v,TheKittenMuncher,2,Thu Apr 30 19:51:26 2015 UTC,"Feeders do work, but Duncan needs to alter the layout so that a dinosaur is always within 6 blocks of one.  Maybe set up a minefactory reloaded farm to automatically supply the feeders like the druidz/dinoz pig pen.  Or you could just feed with right-click.  You can use the dinopedia to check the hunger. I don't know how long it takes to edit the videos, but if you record and post the video quickly,  you can respond to the comments before people get to annoyed at any problems they have spotted.  Brilliant series though.  Kim should use botania flowers to make a wall out of jiyuulias and bellethornes"

I had people tell me similar things as I started to apply to school and all that and it also made me want to ""stick it to them"" in much the same way as you. Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any advice for a budding journalist?"
yogscastkim,349sy6,lukadarkwater,3,Wed Apr 29 13:13:48 2015 UTC,"Hey Luka! I was pondering over whether or not to answer this, but to be honest, I'd give you the same advise as I doled out in one of my earlier Ask Kims, where I talked about how to get into whatever you want to get into. Create a portfolio - keep writing -put it online in a format you'd be happy to show to potential employers. Try to test yourself on writing concise 100-200 word reviews/news pieces/articles that communicate what it is you want to communicate immediately, effectively, and, if possible or appropriate, humourously.    I'm not sure if you want to get into games journalism, but my old friend Tom Francis (used to write for PC Gamer, now makes videogames) wrote an AMAZING article on journalism that I think is still applicable to all aspects of writing: http://www.pentadact.com/2013-07-01-five-things-i-learned-about-game-criticism-in-nine-years-at-pc-gamer/  (It's a bit sweary, but wonderfully so) You should probably check out his other articles on writing too - they're all linked through on his blog.   To be honest, my writing improved greatly when I looked at people in the office who's writing I thought was AMAZING (so, in UK games journalism it was Andy Kelly, Steve Hogarty, Keza MacDonald, Tom Francis and Jon Blyth) - so I'd sit down, read their latest article and try to reverse engineer it. Figure out what made it so enjoyable, informative, effective. Then I'd try to bring what I'd learned from studying their styles to my own writing - and my editor commented that he really noticed an improvement. So do the same - who's writing do you enjoy? How do they do it? Do you notice anything about the way they construct sentences, pull the article together?  Hope that helps, good luck!"
yogscastkim,349sy6,LiamNosliw,4,Fri May 1 09:26:34 2015 UTC,"ALSO! I just dug out an email the Production Editor from PC Gamer sent to me when I first started writing for them. It was feedback from a LEGO Batman review that I did...the production editor is the guy that goes through and tells you why your copy sucks, corrects your grammar and spelling, and is generally freaking awesome and invaluable to helping you grow as a writer. He's put the quotes from my article that he found most offensive in quote marks, then explained why they suck. Anyway, this is what he said to me, and I think it's brilliant advice over the finer details:  Hi Kim!  This was a fine review - it's cool that you're doing 2-pagers for us now.   However, there are a few teensy bad habits in there that I see in a lot of games journos. It's too late for those jaded hacks, but you've still got a chance.  'It’s simply amazing, and better still, it’s not the only innovation on display in this latest LEGO game.'  You can safely delete most adjectives, but especially do-nothing ones like the 'simply' in 'simply amazing'. You also don't need to say 'on display' - but for some reason games journalists do, a lot.  'Sadly, The Boy Scout’s flying mechanic is terribly implemented.'  'Mechanic' is a word I'm seeing more and more in games writing these days. A mechanic is a man in greasy overalls who mends your car. 'Sadly, the Boy Scout's flying is terribly implemented' will do fine.  'Levels themselves are brimming with imagination and a real appreciation for the Batman universe.'  This sounds like you're saying that levels generally around the universe are brimming with imagination. Journos also write 'Battles are intense' and 'Vehicles are easy to steer'. What, all of them? Stick a  'The' in at the start of the sentence - that's what it's there for.  'There’s a lot of imagination and fun on display here, making this by far the strongest entry in the Lego series.'  See? 'on display' again - you can just delete it. You should also hear alarm bells whenever you write a sentence beginning 'there is', because it means you're writing in the wishy-washy passive voice. Rearrange the sentence so that it's about something VERBing something else and it sounds much more strong and certain : 'The imagination and fun here make this by far the strongest entry in the Lego series.' See? You're halfway to writing like Hemmingway."

yogscastkim,33z1vm,CharredMoustache,17,Sun Apr 26 23:57:11 2015 UTC,"I've been waiting for the unconfirmed rumours to die down and for an official statement to surface...and now it has (http://kotaku.com/its-official-silent-hills-is-cancelled-1700379816), here's what I think:  I'm not actually that sad. The Del Toro/Kojima/Reedus project would've been hella strong, and, as a huge Silent Hill fan, I really had hopes it would fix the series and bring it back from it's recent dire entries.   HOWEVER - the statement from Konami says that while 'PT/Silent Hills' is cancelled and Reedus has been dismissed - it DOES say that Silent Hill games ARE incoming and that Konami are still in discussion with the ever missing Kojima and Del Toro. So a Silent Hill game could still be happening with these two. And I think it'd be unlikely that Konami would entirely scrap all the work they've done on PT so far - concept art, story, direction, monster ideas, conversations with Junji Ito...I really don't think they're just going to bin ALL of it, so I think we'll still see it in the next game.  The thing I'm more curious about is what the hell is happening between Kojima and Konami? Both parties have gone quiet for a month since Koj announced problems with Metal Gear Solid and his career at Konami. Silent Hills is just a part of this bigger picture. Again, I'm not interested in any unconfirmed rumours, and I'm happy to wait until either one makes an official statement about their seemingly turbulent relationship. While I don't necessarily like all of Kojima's games (and find recent MGS' quite tedious), I think he's a wildly unique developer who at least innovates in an industry that is largely stagnant (think COD, FIFA, etc...big franchises that you pretty much know what you're gonna get and cater to the broader audience). And I have a lot of time for that. So it'd be a shame to see him leave the industry, which he's been mumbling about for a while. God, I remember he used to write a column about movies on Official PlayStation magazine, and it was one of the most compelling reads ever - the guy is just fascinating. So yeah, that's really my bigger concern.   As for PT/Silent Hills - it's a loss, and a big loss to a very malnourished horror genre, but I have faith that we'll see another, similar Silent Hill in the future, and given Konami's ambiguous statement, it does seem there's a slim chance Del Toro and Koj could still be involved."
yogscastkim,33z1vm,nanosounds,2,Mon Apr 27 15:05:36 2015 UTC,"I hope you're right about the ideas and concepts of P.T. making into another Silent Hill game. It would be a shame to let Kojima's and Del Toro's vision go to waste. I was especially looking forward to seeing Del Toro's input on the monster/creature design. Also, It's a shame about Norman Reedus, I think he would have made an interesting lead character in the game. In my opinion, he plays one of the best characters in the The Walking Dead TV series."
yogscastkim,33z1vm,i2xi,2,Mon Apr 27 15:58:02 2015 UTC,"Hey Kim ;)  The Konami/Kojima thing is just bizarre and a loss if he leaves.  It seems at the moment that theres simply no progress in the project and thats sad.  Feel sorry for Del Toro with The Hobbit and now thids :(  I admire your optimism that something could still arise, i just hope the right people are involved."
yogscastkim,33z1vm,MoreCoffeeStat,2,Mon Apr 27 16:25:20 2015 UTC,"Its cool that Konami's said that there going to keep work on the Silent Hill franchise, but whats got me worried is that they will just hand it off to another studio again like they did before. I don't wanna see another Homecoming or Downpour. Fingers crossed they do use what was already there to make a new SH, its just a shame that we may never see Kojima's/Del Toro's vision for the series."

I'm just wondering why it would be cancelled? Like I know plenty of games don't make it past early development but it's weird to see one cut after being official announced with a hugely successful playable trailer, a cast/director, and what was obviously a large team working on it already.  Edit: Okay I did some research and apparently Kojima recently left Konami, so yesterday del Toro announced that he was leaving the project too (probably because Kojima left). With Kojima and del Toro gone, I guess the whole thing just kind of dissipated.   From the wiki:   As of March 2015, Hideo Kojima has postponed development on Silent Hills due to his involvement with Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, and sources from Konami confirmed that Silent Hills will continue development ""with or without Kojima"".[4] One month later the project was cancelled for unknown reasons with Konami pulling the demo P.T. from the Playstation Network.[5][6]"
yogscastkim,33z1vm,virgash,3,Mon Apr 27 01:49:06 2015 UTC,"The game is not strictly cancelled. Del Toro is no longer on the project (which is no shock as he tends to fall off other projects including his other work on a game) and there's been no official cancellation. Kojima also hasn't officially left Konami and all that is in the dark with rumor and speculation. It doesn't look good, at all really, but as Reedus said it's not ""actively""being developed. That's better than scrapped, at least."

yogscastkim,33u9bc,Aeverelle,5,Sat Apr 25 18:06:51 2015 UTC,"I tend to think of Mother more like some sort of personification of the primordial chaos that preceded the world (of Minecraftia) as we know it. Perhaps she was imprisoned into a separate plane when the physical world took shape, and now all that remains of her presence are her attempts to reach into it, spreading flux and taint and destruction to places where the barriers between planes become fragile (i.e. around aura nodes). If my memory serves, the flux sphere was some sort of artificially enlarged node; by destroying it they only managed to close the door into Mother's plane, but there are still plenty of windows everywhere for her to watch us through. And Mother must've also figured out that while taint on the lands is relatively easily sorted out and nodes can be permanently destroyed with a few explosions or hits from a sword, people like Nano and Lalna never stay dead for some reason; so she's now interacting with the world through the Flux Buddies, bidding her time.  During the war with Hat Corp, Nano seemed to become way too overzealous about carelessly destroying things, even in the Panda Labs basement where all the Thaumcraft stuff was; normally, she'd be the one to keep an eye on Lalna and stop him from doing reckless crap like that. I tend to think of it as Mother's nature manifesting through her, attracted and strengthened by chaos -- and everyone knows the Hats are walking and breathing catalysts of chaos.  Why Lalna seems less susceptible to be controlled by Mother in spite of being far more chaotic than Nano by default, I don't know. Perhaps his inclination for science and creating technological stuff keeps him from becoming the ideal host for an ancient force of nature and destruction, while Nano took a liking to witchery stuff really quickly and seemed to enjoy it even more than the other two witches that preceded her, going as far as to mess with Death and steal his gear.  In other words, the Flux Buddies might be vessels for an eldritch entity who wants to tear the world apart and they should be kept away from people like Hat Films at all costs lest they eventually manifest the power to taint the earth they step on (or worse, infect more people with perma-flux and cause a flux apocalypse) and generally give everyone a hard time cleaning up after them. Also, they really should sort out the tainted mess near their base before it spreads any further. And generally avoid being on tainted lands for too long, for everyone's sake."

yogscastkim,33u9bc,PyroHiroshi,5,Mon May 11 06:59:35 2015 UTC,"Considering Lalnable dated his diary in the future, I assumed that he didn't realise that he had actually travelled in time. Based on that, I figured that he'd somehow ended up shifting times on the Heart of Mushbury (since Zoey suggested there was a Lalna clone on the ship with them, and at the time this was the only source of time travel. Plus, it provides inter-universal travel, and as far as we know Yoglabs isn't in the same universe as YCP). Of course, Beyond Mushbury never ended up playing out on the YCP server, and the Time Cops have also been introduced as a possible reason for time travel, so I'm sort of lost here."
yogscastkim,33u9bc,aliaswhatshisface,2,Sat Apr 25 18:11:48 2015 UTC,"I also thought that, because the Lalna in Hypercubed is hinted to be Lalnable (or the original Lalna?), maybe it would be easy to weave time travel into that as well. If I'm not mistaken, they are stuck somewhere in space and time, so maybe that would also be a way of 'accidental' time travel? There's a lot of options here.  I sort of miss Hypercubed a little bit. I do hope they pick it up again when Simon has recovered and is ready to record things again."
yogscastkim,33u9bc,aliaswhatshisface,3,Sun Apr 26 11:07:01 2015 UTC,"I thought the Lalna in Hypercubed was the original Lalna (or the source of the clones), since he doesn't look like Lalnable, and Lalnable's cell looked different (of course, he could have just been moved).  Maybe Lalna in Hypercubed is the start of the chain of instability in Lalna clones. I remember in... Moonquest? Hole Diggers? Xephos mentioned that Lalna is going insane from being cloned so many times, so maybe the path to Lalnable is just that - a series of clones ending in the extremely dangerous Lalnable. Which would probably put Magic Police Lalna further down the path than Flux Lalna. Of course, if that's the case and the first Lalna on the path of instability was locked up, I guess we can assume that the following clones were also locked up, in varying degrees of security. Which begs the question - how did the other clones manage to escape, and how many didn't?"

And I feel like I remember Xephos asking Lalna if he was feeling homocidal or something. I don't know, I don't think HC!Lalna was specifically mentioned to be Lalnable, but he was pretty dangerous I think.  Also are you implying that there are lots of Lalna clones that are more unstable than Lalnable? Because that would be really bad."
yogscastkim,33u9bc,PyroHiroshi,1 point,Sun Apr 26 12:07:22 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'm suggesting that there are lots of Lalna clones that are gradually on a scale from 'normal' to 'as unstable as Lalnable', and the Lalna-cloning batch was cancelled and imprisoned when Lalnable popped out, named himself 'Lalnable Hector' and tried to kill everyone. Then again, I wouldn't put it past Xephos to restart the Lalnable cloning range in an attempt to make even more unstable clones, once the war with the government kicked off.  Edit: forgot to reply to the first thing you said - I figure that HC!Lalna is dangerous and occasionally homicidal, or was locked away for fear that he would have that personality, but I don't think he's Lalnable nor is he as dangerous as Lalnable. I guess what would be interesting is if, in making Lalnable, there was a split between the homicidal bits of Lalna, and the nice bits of him, so that HC!Lalna and Lalnable are basically opposites. But that's a completely different theory that's just flown away from me and goes against everything I've been saying before this. I guess they'd both end up being locked away as a safety measure."
yogscastkim,33u9bc,Caleb_Aurion,2,Sun Apr 26 12:50:02 2015 UTC,I hope Kim/Duncan can convince Lewis to make a few episodes explaining the clones in more detail. Wonder if the the cloning machine amplifies only certain personality traits that are already present in the original. Honeydew had quite a few not-so-bright clones. XD
yogscastkim,33u9bc,Caleb_Aurion,4,Mon May 11 06:54:49 2015 UTC,"I'm rather surprised that people aren't talking more about this so here goes. Evil Duncan who I can only assume is Lalnable Hector took some of Kim's hair.   He never revealed his goals in impersonating Duncan and his other actions are so random at best that I think it's safe to say stealing Kim's hair was his main goal. The question is why? what does he want with Kim's hair? Well two ideas come to my mind.   First, Kim is fluxed and Lalnable may be looking for a way to weaponize flux. The main problem I see with this idea is that Duncan is also fluxed so he could have simply taken some of Duncan's hair, though this could be because Kim has a more advanced case of Flux and therefore would be a better sample.  That having been said I think it is far more likely that Lalnable took Kim's hair to make a clone of her. This clone would likely display a combination of Kim's traits with what we saw of Lalnable. The biggest question to me here is will the Kim clone be fluxed? I would assume so given how long Kim has been fluxed at this point, so assuming the clone is fluxed what would Lalnable's next move be? Ignore the Flux like Duncan did or cure his new clone? If he goes with attempting a cure this could lead to Kim and Duncan recovering his notes and curing themselves.  All of this could be totally off base but I think I'm on to something here so tell me your thoughts on the matter."
yogscastkim,33u9bc,Dr_De,3,Wed May 13 06:15:00 2015 UTC,"I mean we haven't heard him call himself 'Lalnable', but then again he probably didn't come up with the nickname himself and would just call himself Lalna. So he could be Lalnable Hector, or he could be another messed up clone. But for convenience's sake, let's call him Lalnable.  Would agree with Lalnable probably trying to clone Nano - and that that was probably his goal. It's also interesting how he refused to hurt her, even though he had Lalna's sword firmly in his hands and Nano was well and truly willing to hit him as well.  Whether Nano's clone would be fluxed is a good question. The problem here is we don't know enough about the flux (probably because Kim and Duncan haven't thought about it too much or haven't said anything yet). If the flux has affected her DNA, then yes her clone would be fluxed - but if it hasn't then her clone would be just like Nano was when she was stuck in the nether.  Now I've been talking about androids a lot with a friend recently, and he said someone's personality is based on their experience and memories. Nano being betrayed by Sjin, fluxed by Lalna, then living in PandaLabs etc. has definitely made her who she is now. But a Nano clone who only has memories with Lalnable might end up with a violently different personality.  ... Actually, Lalna and Nano's clone counterparts generally being evil sounds friggin' amazing. I'm going to draw that now."
yogscastkim,33u9bc,CorenSV,2,Wed May 13 12:55:11 2015 UTC,I agree with you on all fronts. On if the Flux messes with her DNA it's hard to say given how little we know. Flux literally means continuous change so from that stand point it's entirely possible that it has affected her DNA. That haveing been said Kim's flux presents more like taint and in that case I highly doubt that it has.
yogscastkim,33u9bc,GiraffesAREcool22,3,Wed May 13 17:06:29 2015 UTC,"I sort of see it as, they're infected with flux, but the purple stuff that shows up on their skin is taint. Flux is sort of like the aura in the air or in their veins, while taint is a more physical appearance.  Anyhoo, it would be such a punch in the face for Nano if NanoClone didn't have flux. She would be an alternate, evil version of Nano - except she looks more normal and doesn't struggle with the problems the flux brings Nano."
yogscastkim,33u9bc,SlayerOfDerp,1 point,Wed May 13 21:31:29 2015 UTC,"a distinction, though, with respect to the DNA, is that if the flux effects DNA, then Nano's clone would have whatever biological effects come from that, but unless the flux fundamentally is a mutation of DNA, it wouldn't carry over. So, for example, if the skin color is as a result of a protein mutation from mutated DNA, the clone would have that everywhere because she would have the genetic mutation everywhere, but she might not have the flux if the flux isn't itself manifested in DNA"
yogscastkim,33u9bc,aliaswhatshisface,1 point,Wed May 13 21:38:23 2015 UTC,"I think you're both onto something. But honestly I think that this lalnable just grabbed nano's hair as an afterthought. As a backup plan for when his main plan went awry.  I also think this might not be lalnable hector.. Though there is a good chance he is. Since they wouldn't just pluck out a new clone out of nowhere to serve as an antagonist when they have such a fan favorite lying around who is already being underused. But it's possible its just another lalna clone. (Very possible actually because lets be honest. None of lalna's clones are very stable. I can see numerous clones of him go completely of the edge. Heck, lalna himself used to be fairly nuts himself before nano began making sure he didn't do strange stuff.)  As for what his main plan is. Judging from his behavior during the two episodes and how he made sure that duncan was out of the way permanently (until he revealed his location to nanosounds) I think that he was trying to take lalna's place.  Because if he just wanted her hair, he could have easily knocked her out while lalna wasn't around, cut of some of her hair and ran of. He was able to kidnap and imprison lalna without nano noticing. I think it's safe to assume he could do it the other way around if he wanted.   But he didn't. He got duncan out of the way and took his place. Trying to act like him as best as he could andas aeverelle said. Even when the jig was up and he got hit by nano he didn't hit back even though he was armed as well. He didn't resist when she demanded the stuff back he then snapped and began laughing evily and just ran into the woods. Even giving nano a hint as to how she could get her lalna back.  As for why lalnable wanted to take lalna's place. I got 2 theories.  1) nano's orgins are known to him and he wants to get close to her because of them. Maybe there is something special about her that can help him with his wierd experiments. doesn't explain why he doesn't just kidnap her though. Here getting the hair was just him getting a sample. He also didn't want to harm nano because, well that would destroy the source of his samples.   2) Lalnable wants what lalna has.  lalnable has some traits of a classic sociopath. (not sure if that was intentional or not. But Since he is obviously inspired by hanibal lecter himself. A classic sociopath. I think it is.)  He lacks empathy, as seen when he can't emphasize with nano when she begins freaking out why eating hearts or killing chocobo's is wrong. Nor does he show any remorse after those actions other then a short sorry. He is completely ruled by his own desires and cares nothing about others. again, his murdering of the chocobo's just because he felt hungry. Justifying his killing of a beloved (or at least liked) animal with the fact he doesn't like noodles.  He cares only about himself and his desires. He sees others as beneath him.  So when this lanlable saw that lalna was having a good relation with nanosounds. (if it is  a romantic one or just very close friends I leave up to you) He wanted it for himself. again, he shows that he doesn't understand how that relation came to be or what makes it work. Which might be because he's a sociopath or because he's been completely isolated from anybody since his creation Or maybe both. He thought that just replacing Lalna would be the end of it. As we saw, it wasn't. nano quickly figured out that this man with lalna's face wasn't him.  The hair lock would have been taken as a backup plan. Maybe he was noticing that the entire plan was going awry and that she was getting suspicious. He probably will use the DNA taken to make a backup clone there. Maybe hoping that he can get an apprentice just like lalna. Somebody that he can talk to whenever his evil lair feels lonely. Somebody he can boss around.   I'm not sure if the clone will be evil though. Or if she is even like lalnable. We have seen how he treated villagers and even his own clone. (which probably could be likened to family or a brother.) Why would he treat nanoclone differently?  3) Or something completely different. Maybe he has doesn't care about nano and just hates lalna. And wanted to hurt him physically and emotionally. And what better way to break somebody then to show that their closest friend isn't able to tell them apart from an evil maniac like himself? What does that say about lanla?  Granted, it backfired. But I can see lalnable wanting to rub that into lalna's face.   Though again, that doesn't explain why he didn't murder her when the jig was up and why he gave nano a hint as to were lanla was.   As for the clone and flux thing. I don't think the clone will be fluxed from the moment she is created.. unless lanlable sees the flux as something integral to nanosounds and deliberately infects her with it. 'Because she wouldn't be nanosounds without flux'   Either way. I pity the soon to be nanoclone. If she turns evil. it's going to be at the hands of a maniac."
yogscastkim,33u9bc,AnotherRedShirt,2,Thu May 14 13:16:40 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of having most of Nano's backstory be ingrained into the Thaumcraft mod. If Mother is sentient, I think it would make sense that she is part of the magic of Thaumcraft and maybe her existence can be blamed on the Thaumcraft experiments that other yogs have done.   Strawfingers was also made out of a Thaumcraft block, and so I have a feeling he is much more involved in Nano's past than we have seen so far. It is a bit suspicious that she was the one that Strawfingers kidnapped, but my theory is that she wasn't kidnapped at all.   I think Mother is somehow in control of Strawfingers, used him to magically create Nano, and now has some insidious purpose for Nano.   Perhaps the purpose is to spread the flux to other yogs, like what happened to Duncan, or maybe it's to use Nano as a vessel that she can possess later on to come into being in the ""real"" world? I'm really excited to see where Kim and Duncan take their story!"
yogscastkim,33u9bc,SlayerOfDerp,3,Sun Apr 26 10:27:34 2015 UTC,"or maybe it's to use Nano as a vessel that she can possess later on to come into being in the ""real"" world?   And then we'd have   Good Duncan ---/--- Lalnable Hector (different bodies, each only good/evil)  Good Kim ---/--- Mother's Avatar/Vessel/Whatever (same body, different minds fighting for control?)  Could make for a cool Flux Buddies 2 finale, especially now that Evil Duncan (aka Lalnable Hector) has made it into the story."
yogscastkim,33u9bc,AnotherRedShirt,2,Tue May 12 18:46:31 2015 UTC,"This is a really neat theory! I've always liked the idea of Strawfingers not just kidnapping Nano as a hostage and having some other reason instead. After all, he never did her any harm; As far as we know, he just put her into a tower and gave her chicken for when she got hungry.  Nano being a magic being would also explain her not knowing anything about the Minecraft world (other than 'Kim didn't know how to minokraft').  The only problem here is that surely Mother wouldn't have known that Nano would eventually meet Lalna, who has a massive flux sphere, allowing Nano to get fluxed. I mean if Mother did set that up somehow, those would be some pro chessmaster plays right there :p"
yogscastkim,33u9bc,StrangersAngel,2,Sun Apr 26 10:57:11 2015 UTC,"I like this idea, since it would explain the fact that nobody else seems to have contracted flux directly from exposure to flux (no matter how much Nilesy wants to be fluxed, he doesn't realise the path to that is hanging out with Nano). So Nano is already susceptible to flux (even if Mother doesn't assume she'd be around Lalna, I presume the assumption is that there are flux tainted areas across the world and Nano's going to get into contact with them sooner or later), and acts as a vector for it?"
yogscastkim,33u9bc,lukadarkwater,2,Sun Apr 26 11:42:17 2015 UTC,"Well, this is my very first ever reddit post, I have in fact signed up specifically to join this particular conversation. I ""rediscovered"" The Flux Buddies et. al., via Lewis' vlog post a couple weeks ago. I have since binged watched pretty much the whole lot. Not since ""We're Alive"" has a series drawn me in as strongly as this one has. I have thoughts on/about the series and I feel compelled to share them.      Now with that said, binge watching brings the peril (for me) of not allowing key points to be stewed over and not thought of properly on occasion. It's likely that I might go down the wrong rabbit hole, or belabor a point that has already been hammered out a year ago... My thoughts may muddy the waters even more, but like I said, I wanted to share. Well, buckle up your foil hats, I'm about to get weird.      From The Yoglabs, we have Cloning and dimension doors. Through the mods in use, Mystcraft gives us parallel universes. Lalnable hinted at time travel and Time Cops confirms it, not to mention the time paradox Simon caused in Yoglabs. This could get even messier than a confusing episode of Doctor Who... Taken as a story outside the mechanics of the game this is filmed in, people die, but come back? This isn't just the Impossible Girl Clara Oswald... all the characters across the canonically connected series are the Impossible People. For all we know, with Applied Energistics, this is all a simulation running on a server in Yoglabs. That said, it's we shouldn't make any assumptions when we see a doppelganger. They could be past, future, parallel present, clones, echoes... anything.       Shikadilord, I quite like your idea about personification, much like the idea of Palpatine becoming the embodiment of the dark side. Coupled with SlayerOfDerp's thoughts on her being an avatar or vessel for ""Mother,"" it seems that she could be in even greater peril than previously thought, now that Mother has her tendrils in her so to speak. It's also very reminiscent of FF7, which I seem to recall Kim is a fan of.      leachim1995, your thoughts on a ""broken"" Lalna are in line with some of my own thoughts. If I may, I'd like to expand on it a bit. I propose the possible future storyline: When Kim's infection gets really bad, Lalna throws himself wholly at the problem of curing her. So much so it affects his health beyond his own infection. Kim is no longer able to care for or ""watch out for"" Lalna and it gets bad for him too. In the end, she begs him to stop, that it is too late for her now and she knows it. She wants to spend her last moments of life with him. She refuses further care and treatment because she wants to be lucid with him and she dies in his arms. Permanently. She doesn't come back as they have been used to. After making arrangements for her; pyre, tomb, ect., he returns to his current lab set up and finds that the most recent experiment has yielded the cure. After verifying it on himself, he is wracked with guilt and cracks... he goes absolutely mad. He succeed, but he was too late. The only friend that (this version of) Lalna had and it was his fault she died. His mind cracked and having been so recently focused on trying to save her, he continues to try to find a way, even after her death and becomes Lanable Hector. Not a Clone, not a parallel universe version... just from the future and insane.     As an alternative to her death, given that Kim is also I seem to recall a fan of FF8, maybe Mother is actually Kim. Deep, deep in the distant future, Kim has ascended to a being of pure Flux and has nearly outlived the universe itself and is alone. Lonely, she is reaching back through time and is trying to find her friend. Present Kim subconsciously senses the older version of herself and mistakes it for her mother and not herself. FF8 could also hint at an explanation for the forgetfulness.       My thoughts on the massive Flux accident at Dunkan's old lab:       It seems to have ripped a hole in reality and teleported Dunkan's castle into a new world, perhaps landing on Lalnable's Lab.     It didn't teleport the lab, it instead shattered reality, an event that echoed back through time and with the disasters at Yoglabs, contributed to the degradation of the world. The castle they found is merely a parallel world castle.     I don't think Our Heros are done with that castle just yet. I think we'll see it again.       I also suspect that Blast Off is actually in the distant past and not the Future as we have been led to believe. It takes place after people fled the planet after a (another) apocalyptic catastrophe at Yoglabs. Blast Off is actually one of many Yoglabs contingency plans and the world has been rehabilitated due to the ministrations of that crew, we are now in the distant future of that time. This explains why all the cities are gone, but the space-time damage remains. I mention it because it would seem that everything is connected.      That's all I think I have for now."
yogscastkim,33u9bc,leachim1995,1 point,Sun May 17 17:04:09 2015 UTC,"Since I was already briefly mentioned I thought I'd add my input on something else:  I personally don't like the idea of the flux just killing Nanosounds/Kim for several reasons:   Whoever Mother is, I think there's a plan with the fluxing of Nanosounds and Lalna. A far more sinister plan than just killing them. What would break Lalna even more than Nanosounds refusing to be cured and dying? Nanosounds reaching a stage of flux where she is no longer the person he knew and doesn't die in his arms but laughs in his face as she tells him, in an echoing and inhuman voice that all he has worked for has been for naught and now she(Mother?) is free, laughs and flies out of the lab. It would lead to some very weird series where Duncan is constantly roleplaying as Lalnable Hector which might get pretty weird after a while and I don't know how long he'd be able to do it well. If Kim is still in the current time, wreaking havoc, then there's still a more immediate problem and goal in the current time, which directs him there and gives more of a sense of urgency, making a Lalnable goes back in time-series pretty short. If his goal is an older version of Kim, the goal is in the past which disconnects Flux Buddies from interacting with the other groups who I guess would be in the present time/other weird times during already finished series. (well, except time cops I guess if its still running at that point) Besides all that, what would Kim then actually do in the series? Just play as Echo until normal Nanosounds is resurrected or something?"
yogscastkim,33u9bc,eeffoc1,1 point,Sun May 17 19:53:01 2015 UTC,"My apologies for such a delayed reply... I travel constantly for work and I haven't made the time to reply till now.  In my plot suggestion, I only suggest Nano asking Lalna to stop because finding a cure is consuming him, she is reaching the end with no cure in sight and wants his undivided attention as she dies... she wants to spend her remining time with him, not looking at the back of his lab coat. I further suggest that she refuses palliative care because she doesn't like the effects that the ""medicine"" has on her and wants to remain lucid in her remaining moments.      This would doubtlessly make filming the series... odd, to say the least. I do not know why I do, but when I write concerning emotional themes and plot lines, I have the habit of going for the jugular and twisting the knife. Honestly, I'm only spitballing here, just to see what ideas stick and which ideas have legs.      More to your first point, I agree. Even further down that dark path, what if in addition to the loss of his friend, Lalna is also captured/imprisoned/tortured by the Flux possessed Nano? Perhaps this is what cracks him… maybe that is who his master is."
yogscastkim,33u9bc,RGPFerrous,2,Wed Jun 3 00:06:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know if anyone else had said this but in my mind I see the 'Duncan' that Kim met is just one of a batch of clones that Lalnable is creating?  Either before or after (probe after) the castle blowing up he went back to YogLabs and worked out how to make clones and cloned himself and now has a heap of minions running about doing all his evil deeds, such as spying on the FB"
yogscastkim,33u9bc,eeffoc1,2,Sat May 30 02:38:47 2015 UTC,"Lalna is Strawfingers or Why Time Travel is the Answer to Everything  A common theory I’ve seen being thrown around since the first time we saw Nano in the Nether is that Strawfingers is her from the future. There are always various reasons, thoughts, and explanations for why it could be true, but I never really bought into the theory itself. I was thinking about Strawfingers one night and a thought occurred to me: what if Lalna is Strawfingers?  My thought process mostly stemmed from how Strawfingers interacted with Nano and how much Lalna’s flux resembles Strawfingers’ own flux. Most people were instantly like “Oh, he must be evil since he locked Nano up in the Nether”  but that just didn’t seem to be the case. True, she was imprisoned there but did he harm her? No. He just left her there in the castle and gave her some chicken in case she got hungry.  That all seemed very strange to me and I began to wonder. Then, I went and looked at both Lalna’s and Strawfingers’ skins and noticed how similar the flux looked.  Nano’s flux is a much darker and more uniform purple whereas Lalna’s is more splotchy and light, much like Strawfingers.  While Strawfingers flux is much more advanced than Lalna’s, it still looks quite similar.  After that, I began to try and figure out how Lalna could have become Strawfingers.  The obvious answer was, of course, time travel. I think that Strawfingers is Flux Buddies Lalna from the future.  A future where the flux overtook him and killed Nano. Thus, in order to save both himself and Nano, he went back into the past, kidnapped Nano, and trapped her in the Nether (the fluxless dimension) to stop her from ever going “supernova” so to speak.  Now, this is where things get a little less straight forward.  If Strawfingers is indeed Lalna from the future, where did the original Nano come from?    I toyed around with a few ideas, most of them fairly boring, about how Nano and Lalna could meet without the help of Strawfingers, and it’s still quite possible that that could be true.  That they met without the whole incident with Sjin and Strawfingers and the story progressed that way, but then I decided that they didn’t really need to meet for Nano to become fluxed.  No, my theory is that Nano would have become fluxed regardless of whether or not she fell into the Flux Sphere.  The sphere obviously accelerated the process, but I think that it still would have called to her, one way or another. Therefore, in the original timeline, Lalna and Nano didn’t meet until the end.  Whatever Mother is or whatever powers Nano has, I do believe that a fully fluxed Nano would be quite dangerous, dangerous enough to threaten the world.  So, who better to try and get rid of her?  An OP scientist-mage who has delved deeper into Thaumcraft than most anyone else in the world at the time seems to fit the bill.  Lalna would go and try to stop her but would ultimately fail and become fluxed himself from the exposure to the high amounts of flux around Nano.  Then, after seeing the world fall to the flux, he would get into his time machine and go back into the past, kidnap Nano, and lock her away in the Nether so that none of it ever happens.    And thus would begin the timeline in Flux Buddies where Sjin finds Nano in the Nether and brings her out, thus angering Strawfingers and leading Nano to meet Lalna and start the whole process anew."
yogscastkim,33u9bc,Yoshiman__,2,Wed Jun 3 18:33:52 2015 UTC,"Intro: First I will state this is a fan theory not fact. Secondly Please forgive grammar issues that I might make. And last but not least since this is a theory none of which has been proven don't get all up in arms if I say something that the series has covered already okay... Okay.  Theory: Now we have all heard of the story of the clone theory in which Lalnable is a clone of Duncan right... We also know from Flux buddies that Lalnable Hector is canon here is my theory Duncan is Lalnable Hector. Now before you stop reading. Hear me out. Duncan has a bad track record with animals we all know this. everyone he has dies. point blank end of statement from Tiddles (1,2,3) to Mickey to Lady. He has a pet and they die. What if subconsciously He is killing them maybe not knowing he does but he still does. What if Duncan has Latent psychotic tendencies. and by themselves are nothing to be worried about at all unless something were to ""trigger"" them. now what could trigger this mild mannered Evil scientist to want to go on a massive killing spree. The death of someone he loves. Such as Kim. the death of Kim would cause him to snap and start trying bring her back in anyway. Always needing more power. Which leads to his experiments with villagers leading to his capture by the Yoglabs. leading to his escape. leading to having to find a way to his old castle which he finds. Thanks to the Time Police. Lanable finds there time machine and travels back in time to right after the Naga incident and builds an under ground base and tries to fix the his power issues and succeeds and moving on to his next project the resurrection of Nano. The one person that he loves even if she didn't know it.  Now I know this is a bit clunky and probably full of holes but this is my theory on the Lalnable Hector. But it's just a theory a Yogcast theory. Thanks for reading."

yogscastkim,33u9bc,Luka123126,1 point,Thu May 28 08:54:45 2015 UTC,"About the 'Mother' topic: I don't really believe this person is an actual sentient being...  I like to think the the flux had, at some point, crept through Nano's eyes and into her brain, then fuzzed her memories up in some different ways.  At one hand, the flux had somehow destroyed some of Nano's memories of her past, and plus, some other small things... This may or may not explain why Nano has such a short-term memory at some times.  And at the other hand, the flux had the ability to jumble Nano's memories all together... I like to think that this 'Mother' person is actually the voice of Nano's actual mother back then when she was a child, except the voices are more blurry, more hard to understand, which is why Nano didn't recognize this voice the first time.  Instead of sweet, loving whispers, however, these words are replaced with murderous tendencies at which Nano had at some point had heard in her past life of watching violent TV shows.  Idk, I just thought of this a few days ago, and it just hits me really hard 'cause that's such a sad theory... The voice of your mother who took care of you, then jumbled up in a way so that it confuses you and makes you feel helpless... Youch."

yogscastkim,33u9bc,Facsimilii,1 point,Mon May 11 07:28:59 2015 UTC,"I think you dont even need a backstory for Mother if youve played with or read about Warp. Its practically the best thing Azanor (Thaumcraft maker) could have implemented for Flux buddies. It manifests by headaches and ""strange whispers that reveal secrets to you"" (just perfect XD), and, in extreme cases, sun scorn, death gaze, unsatiable hunger, flux flu, and even phisical manifestations such as spider swarms and Eldritch Guardians. As much as we have to be original to the story, we should stay true to the mod it came from. So, magic gone wrong has 2 forms: phisical (taint) and mental (warp). So one can assume that warp is the ""brain"" behind the flux. Mother knew about Duncans escapades in magic, and his highly unstable node, so she tainted Sjins obsidian totems and they formed Strawfingers. He was ordered to take the farmers textures only to lure him into the Nether so he could find her. She knew the girl would eventually stumble upon the castle and inspect the node (she wasnt planning shed fall in, but she didnt complain XD). The node had flux levels high enough for her to briefly pass through the ethereal plane to poison her mind and body and corrupt her soul (whyd you think she cant help but say an innuendo? XD), so she could spread her evil through her vessel and take over Yogscraftia. Now the only question thats left unanswered is this: why Nano?..."
yogscastkim,33u9bc,Treya7,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:35:55 2015 UTC,"Well, if I remember this correctly, warp didn't actually exist back in the Apprentice days. Hell, the Thaumcraft version that they used on YCP didn't even have warp yet. I'm not saying we shouldn't say true to the Thaumcraft mod, but there wasn't a lot to stay true to when the story was established in the first place.  And of course Mother knew about Lalna's magical shenanigans, but how would she ever have known that Nano and Lalna were going to meet? So she somehow knew that Sjin (who hadn't been malicious to Nano previously) was going to backstab Nano, and then that an explosion would randomly fire Nano off into the direction of Lalna castle? But knowing that Nano was going to fall into the sphere is too much of a stretch? :p"
yogscastkim,33u9bc,Misty_And_Maki-Chan,1 point,Sat May 2 13:34:02 2015 UTC,"Im trying to stay true to the CURRENT mod version, cuz Warp preety much explains everything that happened to them. And about the ""she was sure shed meet Duncan"" thing, I mean, theres not many places in the old serverto go to after the farm. Theres the Jaffa factory and Sipsco (lagbombs), Blackrock hold (burning crater), Site B and new BR camp (far far away) and Duncs castle. It was the nearest thing, so she had to vizit sooner or later, just cuz, idk XD.   On the other hand, maybe Mother had more influence on the material world than we thought. Maybe everyone is warped to a point and unknowingly serves her, but only for small things, for she does not hold that much power over them. And the only way to have compelete control over someone is for them to be exposed to a highly unstable node with high levels of flux, so that Mother can pass through and infuse her very essence into the person?  The Prophecy  I predict today A farmer will find A vessel of darkness With a master unkind.  And through this vessel Her will shall spread Till the whole world Appeares to be dead...  Then the Fluxed will rise, Their consciousness faded, Their bodies controlled, Their very souls shaded.  By Mother controlled We will stay that way. Till the end of time, Forever Flux Mothers Day...

I can only imagine Lalnable kidnapped Duncan and pretended to be him so he could have him all to himself. This is the same with Strawfingers.  Edit: On a recent FB episode, Kim mentioned Strawfingers. She said that he treated her pretty well. If this was regular kidnapping, the person would be treated pretty badly.

Basically, everything that gets into the flux becomes part of the same super-organism. So ""mother"" is just the personification of all the instincts and thoughts of the hivemind, not some actual thinking individual.   It affects humans differently (less/more slowly) because they're smarter then grass or animals, and it's quite possible if Kim was further absorbed, that she'd still retain most of her mind and be able to control fluxed creatures rather then be controlled."

yogscastkim,33qmj1,Vamprat,2,Fri Apr 24 19:47:28 2015 UTC,"Well, initially it was to keep it in-line with the modded server.

yogscastkim,33m32e,crimsoncross,3,Thu Apr 23 23:26:53 2015 UTC,"I liked it too, the problem is that there are many jerks who would just start their usual stupid comments about hating Kim. Even if GMod with Kim and the others sounds great, I would rather not push it for her sake. But that's just my way of thinking."
yogscastkim,33m32e,noob_senpai,4,Thu Apr 23 19:55:29 2015 UTC,"I think the YouTube comments that hate on Kim are generally worthless and should be ignored, and I don't think that they are a good reason for her to avoid the main channel - it's no good for her to avoid doing good videos just because people have an irrational hatred for her..."
yogscastkim,33m32e,noob_senpai,2,Thu Apr 23 20:38:05 2015 UTC,"Obviously, it is up to her. If she has fun, if she has the chance, and if she can put up with a bunch of idiots commenting nonsense, it's great. All I was trying to say that there is that side too and I don't think anyone can become completely unaffected by that kind of stuff (well, maybe psychopaths are exceptions)."
yogscastkim,33m32e,RGPFerrous,2,Thu Apr 23 20:56:00 2015 UTC,"It could air on her channel and kill two birds with one stone. Don't let the trolls and haters ruin what could be a great series, I say."
yogscastkim,33m32e,shaql,3,Thu Apr 23 20:35:10 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with these is how Yogscast arranges the various collaborations and such. According to rumours, they set traps in the main corridor, and then make videos with whoever got caught.  Since GMod videos need quite a lot of people, the traps have to be designed to hold many people, and not scare off incoming Yogs even when there's some already caught in the trap - so obviously soundproof, and at the same time having an oxygen-recycling system, to allow catching more people over a longer period without the risk of them dying of suffocation.   While those challenges have obviously been overcome soemehow (since bigger groups are often seen in videos), my theory is that the current trap system is too big - thus allowing a smaller human being to escape. Maybe via the ventilation shaft? In that case, investing in some metal bars may be a good option."

yogscastkim,33m01y,Barnabus_Bot,7,Thu Apr 23 16:41:28 2015 UTC,"So, the way to use feeders for the dinosaurs is to put them at the dinosaur's head height. Every dinosaur has a different head height, and it changes as they grow older. Alternatives are to stack them on top of each other, feed them manually, or change the server config for dinosaur starvation. When I tried changing the starvation, the dinosaurs didn't seem to regain any health, but they also didn't starve to death any more."
yogscastkim,33m01y,Pyrothos,3,Thu Apr 23 16:48:31 2015 UTC,Plus to that: make dinopedia and click with it on a dinosaur to see what he can eat and other info.

It is already close to full size, and once it got there it will start trampling the Chocobos to death - if it doesn't starve first, since there are no trees within its range. The best solution would be to just let it out in the forest."

yogscastkim,33m01y,ShikadiLord,3,Thu Apr 23 22:51:49 2015 UTC,the reson why you are killing the dinos is because you don't have a dinopedia which will tell you what stuff they eat not all of them eat carrots you need to look at what they eat and then put that in the feeder also you should make an auto breeder for the pigs and have it auto kill the baby's when they grow up and then you instantly get all the meat with out doing anything  also they arn't taking suffocation damage they are taking hunger damage

yogscastkim,33m01y,Ace0fSwords,4,Thu Apr 23 18:39:45 2015 UTC,Dino mod is high maintenance. I asked on their thread to implement non-lethal starvation (as lethal starvation is extra crappy on multiplayer servers). Hope the dino mod people add it as an option in a future version.
yogscastkim,33m01y,Ace0fSwords,6,Thu Apr 23 18:40:38 2015 UTC,"The reason the T rex died is because they never fed it ONCE. The reason the Allosaurus is very low on HP is because its feeder is one block underground.  My bet is that the Brachiosaur is next to starve because there are no feeders it can reach. Well, unless the Allosaurus dies first- it's stuck in a starving position and can't move towards the feeder.  It makes me angry that none of the Yogscast have even bothered to do any research. Fossils and Archeology revival is a deep mod. If you aren't going to bother to read up about it then you don't deserve to play it."

I'm already up to my eyeballs in researching and practicing Botania, Witchcraft and Pam's Harvestcraft, while trying to get over my natural ineptitude for Minecraft! Honest to God, I am studying more now than I used to for my GCSES. I think the problem for Dunc is that he can't wrap his head around the mod, so it's hard to invest in. Show him the science computer mechanism stuff though and he's away! I'll try add it to my list of things to research when I have time though..."

yogscastkim,33m01y,big-splat,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:01:11 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure they are well equipped enough to return to the wasps. If next episode Duncan makes some potions, then they should be set to go. In reality the wasps will not be too hard if they dig up and over it, so they can drill down and land on top of the spawner, destroying it before any have the chance to spawn. Some regeneration or strength potions would be handy for that, and night vision could be handy as the Erebus is a bit dark in places."
yogscastkim,33m01y,TheKittenMuncher,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:03:49 2015 UTC,Wasps and many other Erebus mobs deal damage through poison. Armor doesn't help against that.

yogscastkim,33m01y,TheKittenMuncher,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"Regen potions need ghast tears which they might not have. However, even without regen, they would absolutely wreck the wasps with cleavers especially when buffed with strength potions.  With a little teamwork (one person fighting wasps, one breaking spawner). It could be done. Do it quick enough and then they can get it all done before the poison becomes an issue.  Alternatively, Kim could make use of her new mob killing flower, deploying it near to the spawner and letting it do its work (downside, the flower will probably stop working once it fills its internal mana storage. Just a guess.). Though i'm sure they've already figured out because of how far prerecorded these episodes are."

Also, I'm pretty sure that the feeders are bugged/broken.  If I were you, I'd set up a system of either dispensers or droppers underneath the pens and wire them all up to a single button, so that when you press the button, food pops out into the enclosures.  Also, I'm pretty sure that they're not taking suffocation damage; I'm almost certain it's hunger.  You need to use your dinopedia more; it tells you how hungry they are, and what they will eat.  But if you're really worried about suffocation damage, try making the pens out of non-opaque blocks.  Glass, for example, or Iron Bars or Wooden Fences, even Cobblestone (or Mossy Cobbletsone) Walls!  (they actually look pretty good if you stack them on top of each other to make the walls of a building.  Be careful though; skeletons can and will shoot through the cracks!)"

It's INCREDIBLE). He's also really looked out for me in my personal life, helping me through some rough patches in the last few years.   I'm so proud he's running the London Marathon, and he's been training for it for months now - including running TO Yogtowers in Bristol, FROM BATH as his daily commute! Unfortunately, he's been diagnosed with tendonitis too, so he actually suffers a lot of pain when he runs now - but he's still doing the marathon! He's a tough dude.   So yeah, I wouldn't normally ask people to donate outside of the Xmas livestream, but it'd mean a lot to me - and to the children who benefit from Special Effect's amazing charity - if you could just a few pennies Nathan's way. Honestly, just a £1 would help immensely, especially as it'd to wonders to bolster his mental game too.

It is still classified as a hostile mob, though its behavior is not hostile. The Friendly Wither is also considered undead, and will be hurt by potions of healing and healed by potions of harming.

yogscastkim,331og3,Torkmatic,5,Sat Apr 18 18:52:05 2015 UTC,"Back when I played this pack (my world got corrupted and all messed up from the new RR3 update) I had a pretty badass weapon. It was a Sanguinite Longsword, which took only 2 Sanguinite Ingots and a little bit of Vulcanite for the crossbar or whatever the hilt is called for the longsword. It's did 12 for base damage + wither and fire damage, and it also came with Life Steal. My suggestion is mine for a little while in the nether to get Sanguinite (assuming you have metallurgy, if not...well forget I even said anything). It is relatively easy to come across I've found, and it's the best metal in the game, even better than Manyullyn."

yogscastkim,331og3,Bigmsmallb,2,Sat Apr 18 18:03:41 2015 UTC,"Those swords are actually not that great.  I'd suggest going back and making a Cutlass instead.  The Cutlass is a bit tricky to make, since you need a Full Guard, the pattern for which you can't actually make, and must find in a Village (check the pattern chests).  Don't worry though, you can make a mould just fine, once you've got the pattern.  The Cutlass has the highest (or 2nd highest?) base damage of any Tinker's Construct weapon, and swings as fast as a normal sword, making it much better than a Cleaver.  Realistically, Cleavers are only good for getting Wither Skulls.  Also, to make two epic Cutlasses, using Fairy Metal blades (I assume you'll use that since it's what you've got right now), Paper Full Guards and either Blue Slime or Thaumium Tool Rods (Thaumium gives an extra modifier slot, but gives a 1.0x durability modifier, rather than Blue Slime's 2.0x).  Then give it some mossy, maybe a vampiric or some looting, and fill the rest up with Nether Quartz for maximum damage!!"

When using the Syringe on a big slime, it will cause an explosion, spawn a small stack of 5 to 16 Raw ""Meat"" Nuggets and spawn several new small slimes, usually two or three.

With that you can hold down right click and then it will send you to a dimension which is like your own personal bubble and no one can enter it, and to get back to your last position in the overworld you have to hold down right click on the key again (This item is from the mod: Random Things), Good luck :)"

With Kim trying to clarify her standpoint on the ""Shipping"" issue, I thought it would be a good idea to reiterate the subreddit team's take on it as well.  We will be continuing with our zero-tolerance approach to shipping based topics and discussions due to reddit's nature as a public forum. Were it that we could hide it away in it's own little section then maybe we would consider allowing it, but as it is, we will not be allowing it. This is as much to protect you guys as it is to protect Kim, as we don't want any of you to run into potentially unwanted content here on the sub, and Tumblr and DeviantArt's methods are much better for only showing the kind of content you want to see.  As for what qualifies as ""Shipping"", we'll continue to use our discretion. Rule34 and offensive content is right out, but generally use common sense. Does it portray an obviously romantic interest or any subject matter that would make Kim uncomfortable? If so, please keep it to Tumblr or DA.  We don't want to censor creativity either, but unfortunately we have to draw the line in the sand somewhere, and it's best we censor a little heavy handedly than Kim (or any of you!) have to come to us with a personal complaint. After all, it is easier for us to take back a censorship than it is to repair offence caused by inaction (as demonstrated by this video!).  Thanks for listening guys, and stay Fluxin' awesome!

yogscastkim,32xr0z,thetacriterion,3,Fri Apr 17 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"Storylines aka my life source. Seriously, I've always hoped that we would discover more about NanoSounds' spawn in the nether, and why she was so suspicious with how she talked about Strawfingers. But Sjin has a bit of a bad habit of not really tying up plot points properly, I figured we'd never see the full story. If we do, I'll cry some happy tears probably. (I'll cry more tears if it has anything to do with how Lyinginbedmon was talking about Nano on his tumblr. I have not forgotten.)  Also I do love seeing things appear in series because the fans got excited about it. Best case is probably in fact still Lalnable, which had the fans going crazy despite his initial 30 seconds of screen time.  And I do remember drawing Nano with purple arms and eyes a day after she fell into the sphere. And I remember drawing fluxed up Lalna around the beginning of Flux Buddies, when the only hint was really the title of the series and I said it would never actually become a thing. And of course the sapphire necklace, which all my friends GLADLY blame me for. Not even sorry.  And re: shipping - If I ever step out of line, feel free to punch me or something. I do try to keep everything in the appropriate tags, but the tumblr tagging system does not always agree with me :/"

yogscastkim,32xr0z,evildrganymede,6,Sat Apr 18 04:20:56 2015 UTC,Oh gladly.   He has implied Nano could easily overpower all the other magic users; There's more to her than meets the eye; She's hiding something or something else uses her as a facade (Mother?).   Now Lying could just have been a little bit cheeky and it WAS quite a while ago so it's possible this will not make itself in to actual canon but. How can anyone say no to superpowered Nano.
yogscastkim,32xr0z,ShikadiLord,3,Sat Apr 18 07:26:03 2015 UTC,"It's funny that Kim was saying she used to dye her hair a lot previously, in the older videos of I've seen of her (from the Playstation days) she's had black hair. I guess i must have missed that era! Either way, she's totally rockin' that new style (is that what the kids say nowadays?). :)  My favourite drinks: Tea (actual tea, none of that herbal stuff!), and ""cane cola"" (Bluesky Cola, etc - not actual pepsi or coke which apparently doesn't agree with me at all anymore)."
yogscastkim,32xr0z,virgash,3,Fri Apr 17 18:42:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly? I feel Kim's handling of the subject of shipping was very well done, and hopefully the target audience will understand.  Anyway, I'm actually surprised by Kim's answer to the pets question! I always figured she was more of a cat person. I wholeheartedly agree with her and Hannah's stance on the matter of being unable to spend enough time with them. My pets at least (a 13 year old cat and dog) don't seem to take it very well when I'm out for too long/at unusual hours, even if that's a relatively rare occurrence. Sorry about the memories, though, I felt I was forgetting something -- it's been ages since I watched that episode!  And about the hair, after her recurrent comments on the matter in her Life is Strange playthrough I figured it was only a matter of time. :p"

Hair looks awesome btw!  If you were to get a dog which breed would you go for?   Glad you put something out there about the outright creepy fan fiction and art work that's going around. Its unfortunate that people feel the need to create this because it can only make your professional life much more difficult.   Thanks for continuing to produce the quality entertainment you do.
yogscastkim,32xr0z,CharmingAssimilation,2,Fri Apr 17 19:08:39 2015 UTC,"I think you'll find that she specifically said in the video that she understood why the shipping was happening and that she was okay with it so long as it wasn't shoved in her face and that people understood that there is a difference between their irl selves and their in-game personas.  Shipping happens in literally every fandom in the entire world and actually encourages a lot of interfandom content creation and activity and, when done correctly, is a healthy and normal part of fandom. Now, there does need to be a line between what is appropriate to show to the content creators and where these things are posted and so on and so forth but trying to ban it completely isn't going to happen and frankly would alienate a large portion of active members of the fandom."
yogscastkim,32xr0z,kimichitsuzuku,2,Fri Apr 17 19:24:03 2015 UTC,"Gosh, you can hear the frustration on the shipping topic. It must be annoying to even have to explain what the boundaries are. Not to say you came across as ""grouchy"" though Kim.   Also, have you ever considered a pet you could bring along to work? A place where I interned at allowed dogs in the office.

Since it's purely cosmetic (the only crating recipes it's used in, you can also use dirt), you can throw away a dirt block for every mycelium block you spawn in, and it'll be fine. You'll probably still get rage in the YouTube comments but who cares? You have to have it in addition to the clay and dye, because mycelium's only useful for the floor (the dirt underneath still shows), but you can still replace that boring dirt with something flux-y."
yogscastkim,32xw4q,XCube591,3,Fri Apr 17 16:56:41 2015 UTC,"Well, in all honesty I don't think we have that much information on what 'Mother' is either. All we really know is that she/it is associated with the flux and Nano can hear her, amongst other voices.  Nano also used to refer to Mother as to what was in the sphere back in the Apprentice days. (Quickly watch the beginning of The Apprentice: Duncan's Lab #8, you'll see what I mean.)  Whether Lalna can hear her is a pretty good question, as he's been avoiding the subject a bit every time Nano's asked about it.  Aside from that, God knows! /throws hands up"
yogscastkim,32xw4q,Aeverelle,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:03:35 2015 UTC,"The following will be in character/in storyline.  Let's just assume that 'Mother' is an entity that communicates via the flux and whenever it speaks to one of it's 'infected' (which as of now, could only really happen when they were near an actual form of flux or some other eerie zone) they get mesmerized. It often tells it's infected to do things too.  Nano started to hear mother after she fell into Duncan's giant fluxy node sphere in his Apprentice series.  LividCoffee has claimed to hear voices, which would possibly mean mother, but he has ignored them or tried to shut them out (Thus far succesfully)"

yogscastkim,32tlef,HylianZombie,3,Thu Apr 16 19:55:24 2015 UTC,"I can totally sympathise about the needles and anaesthetic stuff.  I've had a few medical procedures in the past year here where didn't give me a general anaesthetic that knocked me out completely, and it's really weird - it's like the anaesthetic switches off the ""record"" function in my brain, they do the procedure, then at some point afterwards I start being aware again. Except it's kinda patchy, and sometimes I know I must have done specific things after I've ""woken up"" but I don't actually remember doing them. After a couple of hours it's all back to normal, but it's very weird. I wonder if that's the same kind of feeling that Kim had (I think it might be a recent thing they've come up with too, I never noticed that sort of effect in ops before around the year 2000). Apparently it's because the anaesthetic has a 'hypnotic' component to it (I think it's called that because it basically addles your brain for a while).  As for passing out, lately I seem to have taken to almost doing that with needles too. My blood pressure just plummets and I almost lose consciousness. I dunno if that's what happens when people faint or pass out, but it's a very disconcerting feeling!"
yogscastkim,32tlef,evildrganymede,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:06:05 2015 UTC,"It's called twilight anaesthesia and uses decent doses of benzodiazepines that suppresses the formation of new memories.

And plonk them into the smeltery. All the blood, none of the moral ramifications!  Easiest way to get salt is the bucket and pot method, just draw water every time you need salt, use it with a crafting bench and a pot, bam! Salt. Stockpile it since you have no way to automate it yet. The next thing to do is to grow soy beans, they can replace anything in most recipes, and yield the same result. You'll need to craft the devices that process them into soy milk and tofu, but with a bit of automation you can have an endless food supply to make any dish. Finally, as for those bloody yellow jacket meat bee wasp bastards, dig above the nest and spawner, and drop a lava block, and let it pour on the spawner. Get some fire resistance and watch as they get stuck and burn to death as you kill the spawner."

yogscastkim,32p6wh,WhitePawn00,3,Wed Apr 15 17:00:29 2015 UTC,"Okay guys, basic Unstable Ingots/Building Wand PSA! (I'm not sure if (Kim) you've used them in the past, so if you have then you probably know this already so ignore this.)  Unstable ingots are actually not that complicated or dangerous and make extremely useful tools. Most importantly, the builders wand could seriously help you guys out with those tall/large phallic symbols buildings.   1. ACTIVATE DIVISION SIGIL  Acquiring a division sigil is probably the most annoying part because they're only found in chests or possibly as drops. The activation ritual is pretty well described on the wiki here. It's pretty easy. Only things I have to add:   -There are no negative consequences for getting it wrong so don't worry-if you click on the enchantment table and the ritual isn't set up correctly, you'll just get a message in text that tells you what you did wrong.  -The sigil lights up when it's midnight to let you know when to do the ritual.   -Use a low-health mob and a very powerful weapon because if you don't one-hit the mob it'll run the fuck around and you'll have a terrible time trying to kill it on the alter in time (speaking from experience).   2. CRAFTING WITH UNSTABLE INGOTS  This is the ~explodey~ part. Basically you put an iron ingot on top of the sigil on top of a diamond ( recipe ) and once you craft the ingot, it explodes in 10 seconds. Don't let this scare you!  -10 seconds is PLENTY of time to craft whatever you need to craft, especially since the unstable ingot items are so simple. Case in point, the builder's wand is literally a block of obsidian and an unstable ingot. Even going slowly, you should be able to craft the builders wand with no explosion, easy.   -For the more complicated items, if you place the items you plan to use in crafting in your hotbar you can just scroll over the space in the crafting box and press that number to put that item in that box. It's much faster than dragging them into the crafting thingy, although you probably wouldn't  be pressed for time at all with the builders wand.   -The explosion created by unstable ingots does not affect the environment, so no holes in your landscape. All that happens is you die, so if you bank your stuff in a chest beforehand there should be 0 risk.   In terms of baby steps, if I were to craft a builder's wand I'd empty my inventory of everything except the sigil, a diamond, an iron ingot and an obsidian block. I'd place the sigil/diamond/iron in the crafting thing, take the unstable ingot (beginning the 10 second countdown), remove the sigil from the crafting box, drag the unstable ingot into the top square, drag the obsidian into a diagonal square, and then take my builders wand. It's like 5 clicks . Practice on creative mode if you're nervous about not having enough time.   2. RECEIVE COOL ITEMS  Full list of items is on the wiki but I'll highlight the ones I think are the most relevant/useful.  -Builder's Wand: You know how it works probably. Extremely useful and pretty easy to make.   -Healing Axe: I pray that one day Sjin will discover this because it could have saved his life like 50000 times over by now. It heals players/mobs if you hit them with it (by taking some of your health) but the real benefit of this axe is that it feeds you permanently forever. That's right Sjin! You don't have to eat ever! You just have to scroll onto the axe and it starts refilling your hunger bar.   -Angel Ring: Grants you creative flying and sweet-ass wings of your choice, but looks like a bitch to make. I've never made one but it looks pretty cool.   -Ineffable Glass: Allows players to walk through it but not mobs. Also, in keeping with the Terry Pratchett-themed items that seem to pop up everywhere, Good Omens!  -Erosion Shovel: Digs up sand/gravel above the block you're digging. Like, you know when you dig a gravel block and a billion more fall to take its place? This would just dig all of them in one go (but doesn't drop blocks).   -Reversing Hoe: Changes cobblestone into normal stone and dirt into grass. Surprisingly useful.   Anyway I hope this helps someone. I think lots of people are scared to try the whole unstable ingot thing but they're really genuinely not scary and the items are crazy rewarding! There are other things you can do but the basics are pretty much enough."
yogscastkim,32p6wh,lasersaurous,2,Wed Apr 15 20:41:59 2015 UTC,"Angel rings are /super/ neat. You do need a nether star and two unstable ingots to make them, so that kind of sucks. However, as said above you choose between angel wings, dragon wings, fairy wings, golden wings and invisible wings.  They basically allow you to toggle creative mode flight at any given time AND reduce fall damage to zero without any sort of fuel/battery usage. I actually really recommend putting these onto your to-do list for Flux Buddies 2.0 as the steam jetpacks rather painfully lack any sort of hover mode, and the boots don't completely negate fall damage.  You can put them on your baubles or just keep them in your inventory - both work. If killing two withers (for both you and Duncan) doesn't sound like too much of a hassle, go for it, I'd say."
yogscastkim,32p6wh,Aeverelle,2,Wed Apr 15 21:31:03 2015 UTC,"i think its also worth to mention that you can only use a crafting table, not a tinkers crafting station. might save some dick ripping.  and thanks for the info, i know about the builders wand and always set out to get it as one of the first challenges in a new game but didnt know about the other stuff."
yogscastkim,32p6wh,JudyIsAPunk76,2,Wed Apr 15 22:49:27 2015 UTC,"I hope your effort isn't in vain.  Btw the wiki isn't entirely up to date. A few missing things aside, the unstable tools are ""just"" diamond tools with infinite durability since verion 1.2.2 of Extra Utilities (citation), meaning the Hoe isn't reversing anymore, the shovel and pickaxe aren't voiding anymore and the sword doesn't ignore armour anymore. The healing axe still seems to have most of its abilities (bug?) from what I experienced. It still regenerates your hunger, turns zombie villagers back into normal and does massive damage to undead mobs but doesn't heal anymore (though there are particles). In case the villige still runs on YCP/MC 1.6 my mentions can be ignored but at the same time some stuff like Angle Rings don't exist back there if I remember correctly.  Also to mention for scrubs who aren't fast enough/think they aren't fast enough there is the more expensive/wasteful way of first crafting unstable nuggets and those into ingots which are stable."

Oh no, if only there were something like modifications which could take that annoying task off of you...  Semi-rude sarcasm aside, you could a) automate fishing with things like the Fisher from MFR (MineFactory Reloaded), Fishtraps from Growthcraft or even with golems from Thaumcraft. b) channel your wrath into sweet revenge and make fishing fun by using the MFR Fishing Rod, the one which needs TNT to craft *winkwink*"
yogscastkim,32l4xe,PintsizedPint,3,Tue Apr 14 22:10:04 2015 UTC,The growthcraft fishtrap is very simple to make. Place it in water and check it every once in awhile to see what it's caught. No fuss. No muss.
yogscastkim,32l4xe,Ace0fSwords,6,Wed Apr 15 06:46:35 2015 UTC,"Nope, you get Pam's Harvestcraft fish just by fishing, not from the water garden (which makes it kind of annoying when you need vanilla fish for something cause you end up fishing up all the stuff you don't need).  ""Vous sommes morts."" Did they really just conjugate it differently than last time and get it wrong again. Good god.

EDIT the first: If you could make the sushi out of scallops, and you had scallops, why use the snail?!  EDIT the second: Just personal thoughts after watching the first few episodes of KirinDave's ""Sunless Minecraft"" series:  If you do get into Witchery again (on or off camera), or if anyone on the new server does, someone should definitely look into the Vampiric ritual (although thinking about it, that would mean no more skipping nights, and the vampire wouldn't be able to skip the days so he'd have to build a basement lair or a death tower or something to hide from the sun)."
yogscastkim,32l4xe,OmegaX123,2,Tue Apr 14 20:29:25 2015 UTC,Tip: in Pam's Harvestcraft you can simply put down on the cutting board on a block and it will work the same as putting it in a crafting area; while the pot needs to be on top of a furnace. :)

yogscastkim,32l4xe,Ik_oClock,2,Wed Apr 15 08:29:37 2015 UTC,"Hatching a Brachiosaurus was yet another huge mistake on Duncan's part. For once, this dinosaur eats leafs, but only ones that are at the height of its head, which is more than twice that of an average tree! You will need to plant some really big trees if you want to keep him fed. Also, despite being herbivores, Brachiosaurus are absolutely deadly once they reached a certain size! They kill smaller creatures simply by stepping on them, and that makes me seriously fear for your Chocobos!      As for the Deinonychus (pronounced ""Dei-no-ne-cus"", btw.); how about trying to hand-feed him?"
yogscastkim,32l4xe,RokuroCarisu,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:01:29 2015 UTC,"it's a good idea to keep some of those pneumaticraft plants around. The rain plant, when fully grown, can be harvested for 2-3 seeds. the seeds can be re-crafted into lapis. lapis can be used for making machines and computers but also used on your Tinker's Construct tools to add the fortune/looting enchant on it. It requires a lot of it though, 100 pieces for a level 1 and 450 for a level 3. I think you get the level 2 at 250.  The slime plants also have a neat side-effect, where if you leave them alone for a while once matured, they'll sometimes explode themselves and spawn slimes and replant themselves. I usually have a slime plant hole where i can occasionally go harvest some slime.  Squid plants can also be used to spawn squid and must be planted directly on water, which can in turn be killed for calamari, an ingredient for sushi, fish sticks, fish burgers, etc...  for fishing, the fish trap from growthcraft will generally catch things you normally could with vanilla, so: fish/salmon/pufferfish, some junk like bowls/bottles/traphooks, but also the occasional boot or enchanted book/bow/fishing rod. they're also pretty cheap to make: 4 planks, 4 string & a lead... which itself is easy to make thanks to harvesting the slimes you get from the pneumaticraft slime plants or coagulated blood gained from the tinker's forge (it can be used in place of slime in a lot of recipes) and the ease of getting cotton plants (pam's or otherwise).  getting a few traps makes getting vanilla fish pretty easy."

Then you just have to listen for the splash and watch for the bobber to drop and right click."

Fun fact: spinach doesn't actually have a particularly high iron content.  One of the major problems is that it contains things like Oxalate, which binds to the iron to form ferrous compounds that the body can't absorb.  In addition, a 1934 study reported the iron content of spinach as 20 times higher than it actually is.  Naturally, agricultural industries have not felt the need to correct the lingering myth caused in part by this original misinformation, and in part by the popular children's cartoon Popeye The Sailor Man, so the general public still has this idea that spinach is very high in iron.  It is high in iron, but no more so than other leafy green vegetables.  Other leafy green vegetables which don't taste like absolute donkey shit. The point, I guess, is that I don't like spinach."

Also if either of you needs Emeralds, set up a Villager Spawner and drop them in another smeltery, they essentally bleed Liquid Emerald and poured into Emerald Blocks. Endermen in smeltery bleed Liquid Ender, which poured into a basin makes a block of it. I think that can be crafted into Ender Pearls"

So there's a LONG EPIC TALE behind the t-shirt...we wanted to get some new stuff designed a few weeks ago, and by this point, I'd started on Nano's Noodle bar in Flux Buds...but we didn't realise how far ahead we were in our recordings and publish times...so this was designed when I'd built Nano's Noodle Bar, but obvs the ep hasn't gone out yet, which is SUPER ANNOYING when it was suggested I wear it at the Gadget show, because...who knows what the heck NNB is?! Anyway, once the ep goes out with the noodle bar in it, it'll go live on the store _^ And yeah, sorry there's such a discrepancy in record/publish time, but because we're so busy, and one of us is often out of the office on shoots, shows, holiday, etc, we try to get as much recorded as possible so we don't have a last minute no-show disaster. We are trying to shorten the gap though, because Jesus Christ, we didn't realise how far ahead we were..."
yogscastkim,325aty,evildrganymede,3,Mon Apr 13 08:24:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe you can think of it as ""previewing the shirt"" and getting the hype train going, so when it does come out in the store it'll sell out in minutes? ;)  (and you've mentioned the idea of the Noodle Bar in the most recent FB episodes, so at least people know what it's going to be)."

I talked about this with a friend this morning coincidentally, and he said hoodies with custom stuff that isn't just a design in the middle is more expensive to make. So that might complicate matters.  I also think it's a bit strange to have different designs for different sexes though - what if I wanted the white hoodie? :p I'm a real tiny girl (156cm at 18 years old /cries), so even getting a small for me would probably be too big.  Lastly I'm a bit unsure what ""a real Malaysian themed hoodie or shirt"" would look like. These are just my thoughts though :B"

yogscastkim,320h69,Barnabus_Bot,6,Thu Apr 9 16:21:18 2015 UTC,"Don't bother with the Terresteel Plates for your exosuits; it doesn't actually increase the armor value at all, just gives you bonus HP.  If anything, you need to move away from using the Exosuit as heavy combat armor at all, instead keeping it to use in less dangerous situations.  I would suggest finding another way to fly (Angel Rings from Extra Utilities, although expensive, provide free creative-mode style flight as long as it's in your inventory, plus a cool set of cosmetic wings on your character!) and moving to different armor altogether.  Elementium is good once you enchant it (but don't bother using unenchanted Elementium armor), and so is Terrasteel, but really what you need is some decent Metallurgy armor.  Inolashite is good, and relatively cheap to make from Nether Ores.  You really, REALLY need better weapons.  Those Rapiers are terrible.  What you need to do is this,   Get at least 2 each of Cobalt and Ardite ores; make Mannyullin. Make Mannyullin Rapiers with Paper Crossbars and Blue Slime or Thaumium handles. Put Looting and Repair on it, then use the rest of the modifier slots for Sharpness.  Give it and additional slot by adding a single diamond with a block of gold for more sharpness, or a level of Necrotic (lifesteal).  That should be a weapon capable of dealing 12-15 damage per hit. Make Crystal Bows.  They use Mana instead of Arrows, and the projectiles fly faster than normal arrows.  Enchant them.  They are good. Go get Duncan's stuff back, having done these things."
yogscastkim,320h69,T_Weezy,4,Fri Apr 10 00:19:24 2015 UTC,"I would recommend the Quiverbow mod, there is some badass stuff in it to deal with all kinds of critters! Afaik it's in RR3 by default."
yogscastkim,320h69,Lumen0602,4,Thu Apr 9 21:39:44 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend seeing if you can get a few staves of travelling from EnderIO.  Shift right click initiates a short range teleport, capable of passing through 1-3 block walls. Great for getting around or escaping a horde of bugs that has you surrounded."
yogscastkim,320h69,Purified01,2,Thu Apr 9 18:37:12 2015 UTC,"I might as well join the other making suggestions and recommendations.  Both of you should go looking for a lot Oreberry Bushes(Iron, Gold, Aluminium, Tin, & Copper. Essence is a maybe if wanting growable Xp), and I mean a lot. You'll be able to grow needed ores and smelt them(Gold and Aluminium Oreberries don't craft into Ingots for some reason, so they have to be smelted).  Using those ore berries, you'd be able to make more: Steam Pipes, Steam Valves, Steam Heaters, and Steam Tanks(this one should be crafted first, holds more steam).  Making a tree farm would also be beneficial, as you could turn Wood Logs into Charcoal for the Steam Furnace to keep the Steam supply up.  Craft Cobblesone Walls and make a perimeter around your area and light it up, as well as place blocks on top/one block out to prevent spiders from sneaking in.  Also yes, craft better armor, tools, and weapons, preferably weapons that aren't Rapiers. Something like a broad sword or the like. Staff of Traveling is obviously a tool to help get away from swarms of mobs. Start crafting a power system, a heavily sustainable one where you can also store away power(either in Capacitor Banks or Energy Cells, preferably Capacitor Banks.)."
yogscastkim,320h69,ArtisticKamenRider,3,Thu Apr 9 22:35:44 2015 UTC,"Oreberry bushes, while nice, can't compare to Magical Crops, and they really need an automatic harvesting system (I like to use Thaumcraft Golems for them) to be a viable source of resources.  Even then you can only get iron, gold, copper, tin and aluminium. Rapiers are actually excellent weapons, but you have to put sharpness on them.  A decently enhanced and well-made rapier can easily do 12 damage per hit, with the maximum possible being over 20, and they can attack enemies much more rapidly than other weapon types. The most powerful Tinker's Construct sword is actually the Cutlass, although it's difficult to make because it requires a Full Guard, the pattern for which cannot be made with a Stencil Table.  You have to find the pattern for it in a Tinker's Construct house in a village (check the pattern chests) One of my other favorites is the Scythe, because although it does less damage than some other weapons, it attacks everything in a 3x3x3 area.  Given a good amount of sharpness, this can be devastating against swarms of enemies (such as wasps)"
yogscastkim,320h69,T_Weezy,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:28:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not even sure they have Magical Crops. If they do have Magical Crops, then Oreberry Bushes could be used temporary(then secondary) source of Iron/Gold/Aluminium/Tin/Copper.  I do think there's a drawback on Magical Crops, that being Kim and Duncan would need a lot of room for growing specific essences to get. Of course some crops they could get right away like Coal Crops for the Steam Boiler.  The automatic harvesting makes sense, gaining the highest yield possible.  As for weapons, yeah you may have that point in Tinker's Construct. They do need better long ranged weapons, maybe the Matter Cannon if they get into AE2 quick enough, probably making an ME Chest to load it up. And hey, if they do get Oreberry Bushes, they'll have a supply of Nuggets to use as ammo with the Matter Cannon."
yogscastkim,320h69,ArtisticKamenRider,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:07:57 2015 UTC,"These are some pretty good and accurate suggestions from what I understand. I've played the modpack though and I've seen weapons do a greater amount of damage than Mannyullin, such as Shiny metal which is gotten from Thermal Expansion Shiny Ore, basically platinum. A tip for Kim, Tinkers Construct varies a lot depending on pack to pack, testing them in a creative world, or merely using NEI to search say ""Longsword"" and seeing the highest damage, then tracing how to get the metal is an easy method. I personally say that rapiers, while good require a lot of quartz to make actually great. Finding methods to create more quartz (Such as in Botania, or Applied Energistics) can make adding sharpness easier. For armor, I also think that Terrasteel isn't that great to be honest, when I made it it seemed like a let down in Exosuits. Thaumcraft Fortress armor, or Voidmetal is my choice, as it is cheaper and provides great protection and easy enchanting, although she already did the work for Terrasteel which is actually better by itself than in an Exosuit. And of course if you want to be ridiculously overpowered, Ichorium armor from Thaumic Tinkerer and Bound Armor from Blood Magic exist, although they need a lot of work to make.  No comment on the Magical Crops, good idea. Any questions I'm more than willing to answer from my knowledge."

I feel like this episode needs some sort of trigger warning for violence or something cause I felt kind of uncomfortable when you were discussing torture devices :(  Also, 38 terrasteel ingots?! I mean, I sincerely doubt that Kim made all those dayblooms and nightshades legitimately cause it just takes an assload of time - but at least that doesn't take lots of mana and valuable materials like diamonds and ender pearls.   I think you would have to watch more episodes of whatever series to gather both the materials and mana to make that amount of terrasteel. I mean if you're going to cheat, may as well be a bit subtle about it :p"
yogscastkim,31j3z4,Aeverelle,5,Sun Apr 5 17:45:59 2015 UTC,"Please, learn what the word trigger means before you misuse it. An age rating, sure. But a trigger warning is meant for people who had traumatic experiences that can result in serious emotional or physical harm when those people see certain things. There is nothing in this video that would trigger anyone who has not been tortured without their consent by outdated torturing devices."
yogscastkim,31j3z4,bbruinenberg,0,Sun Apr 5 18:57:34 2015 UTC,"Whoa hey, no need to be condescending. Apologies for misuse of the word. Maybe not a trigger warning - but I feel a simple warning here would be in place. I feel it's off-putting to hear about torture devices used on women in the past when I'm here to watch gosh darn Minecraft."
yogscastkim,31j3z4,Aeverelle,4,Sun Apr 5 19:10:36 2015 UTC,"The problem I have with your comment is that a large amount of people misuse the word trigger because they want to concern troll (telling someone that they shouldn't do something because you're either actually or falsely concerned about the consequences, resulting in them listening to a single person instead of the majority). That is why I get annoyed when people misuse the word. It loses all it's meaning because of those people.  Also, I wasn't condescending in any part of my comment. All I did was call you out on the misuse of a word, explain the actual meaning or the word and explain why your use of it was incorrect. There is nothing condescending about that."
yogscastkim,31j3z4,bbruinenberg,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:27:59 2015 UTC,"Whilst it can be off-putting for some people with sensitive dispositions, pretty much every Yog video comes with the natural disclaimer that ""We may talk about stuff that weirds you out"".  This is ok, and we promote RATIONAL discussion about it here. I, for example, found some of the Hat's comments on Nano's Village and in Cornerstone a bit excessive, and after some others voiced a similar concern it was toned down.  Please avoid actively downgrading commenters simply because they used a word out of context or that you felt was a bit too extreme. Discussion flows much better when people are polite and informative with their responses.  For example, my response to Aeverelle would be:   Perhaps 'Trigger Warning' is a bit strong. No imagery was used, and all Kim did was read out a wikipedia article. Yes it was gross, but I feel it's a bit of an over-reaction to call it 'Trigger Warning'   Responses like this are far more likely to provoke polite discussion, and are less likely to devolve into off-topic discussions about semantics and internet trolling.  Stay awesome, guys   Rob"
yogscastkim,31j3z4,fire5432999,-7,Mon Apr 6 11:04:47 2015 UTC,"stop cheating in terrasteel. its really unfair to give yourself op stuff like that. with your current setup it would take at least a couple of hours per terrasteel. even if you did watch 4 episodes of that you havent the pearls or diamonds for it. kind of like how you got the manyulln. instead, why dont you just make a better setup. you are using the worst flowers in the game. sorry if i am a bit mean but thats just my thoughts"
yogscastkim,31j3z4,Aeverelle,3,Sun Apr 5 20:14:20 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think it's fine. I agree that 38 is a bit overkill, as you usually only need one ingot for whatever it is you're crafting, but the series would slow down a lot if they constantly had to wait and mine materials. Botania can be quite a slow mod, I've found, and generating a lot of mana without cheating anything is quite a task.   The only thing that makes me roll my eyes a bit is Kim saying she did it, while it couldn't be more obvious she just cheated it in. Such lies.  But I think the real question is, do you really want to see Kim spend like 8 episodes making a better setup on camera?"
yogscastkim,31j3z4,RGPFerrous,3,Mon Apr 6 07:07:09 2015 UTC,"On the RR3 server before the Kimmunity switched to Project Flux, I actually obtained Alfheim research and an entire set of terrasteel gear with less mana generation than Kim has right now, using redstone and automagy to produce terrasteel whenever my pool was filled, regardless of if I was on or offline, so I don't feel like this is much of a trespass. It would be possible to obtain that much terrasteel over the course of a day or two, even without a human presence on the server."
yogscastkim,31j3z4,fire5432999,0,Mon Apr 6 11:08:18 2015 UTC,"Well, it would provably take 2 episodes max, but I guess it is the yogscast after all"

yogscastkim,31free,shaql,3,Sat Apr 4 18:29:15 2015 UTC,"Saint Patrick's Day:       Saint Patrick's Day, or the Feast of Saint Patrick (Irish: Lá Fhéile Pádraig, ""the Day of the Festival of Patrick""), is a cultural and religious celebration held on 17 March, the traditional death date of Saint Patrick (c. AD 385–461), the foremost patron saint of Ireland.  Saint Patrick's Day was made an official Christian feast day in the early 17th century and is observed by the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion (especially the Church of Ireland),  the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Lutheran Church. The day commemorates Saint Patrick and the arrival of Christianity in Ireland,  and celebrates the heritage and culture of the Irish in general.  Celebrations generally involve public parades and festivals, céilithe, and the wearing of green attire or shamrocks.  Christians also attend church services   and the Lenten restrictions on eating and drinking alcohol are lifted for the day, which has encouraged and propagated the holiday's tradition of alcohol consumption.      Saint Patrick's Day is a public holiday in the Republic of Ireland,  Northern Ireland,  the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the British Overseas Territory of Montserrat. It is also widely celebrated by the Irish diaspora around the world, especially in Great Britain, Canada, the United States, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand.

yogscastkim,31bzhh,Barnabus_Bot,5,Fri Apr 3 17:48:08 2015 UTC,Selena means 'moon'. Coincidence? I think not!
yogscastkim,31bzhh,evildrganymede,3,Fri Apr 3 19:31:43 2015 UTC,"So I think I'm starting to pull all the different references together? Or at the very least I'm rambling. Either way, this got a bit long, and the game's not even finished at this point, lol.  You obviously have the sun/moon motifs going on to parallel the male/female symbols all over the house. The ghosts are women, so bright light like something from the sun kills them since they're imbibed with the spirit of the moon, I guess? Maybe? I did note that the lightbulb picked up the latest vid was described as having craters that looked like the moon, so maybe not. Selena is a reference to Selene, the Greek goddess who was the personification of the moon, but also it's interesting to note that mythology has Selene fall in love with Endymion, a human shepherd or hunter, though in the myth she's the one that falls into obsession with him, not the other way around, and her ""love"" for him brings him immortality. Selene is also identified with the torch, so maybe that's why matchlight doesn't kill the ghosts?  Claire de lune is French for ""moonlight"", but gets its name from the Paul Verlaine poem which reads like something William might pen about Selena.  The 3 women whose paintings you have to stab are Maria, Irina, and Virginia, Maria possibly being a nod to the Virgin Mary, which could be a nod to the virgin goddess Artemis who is associated with or sometimes combined into a single goddess with Selene. Virginia as well could be a nod to Artemis and Selene. Irina derives from the greek Eirene who was the goddess of peace, but it's a curious point that Eirene was one of the Horae, a triad of law-and-order goddesses, but later versions of the Horae were said to be the daughters of Helios and Selene. Vesper means 'evening' in Classical Latin, but it comes from the Greek Hesperos, who was the Evening Star in myths, which we now identify as the planet Venus, Venus of course being associated with the feminine. Hesperos is supposedly the son of Eos, the goddess of Dawn, who is the sister of Selene and Helios. As well, Hesperos had a mortal father but an immortal mother, the father in question being Cephalus, who was the father of a great family that included Odysseus. It's also a bit amusing to note Eos and Cephalus did not have a good relationship. Another name reference could be Margaret, who was the Saint of Expectant Mothers. There's also an achievement in-game that's tied to the moon's phases so. And there's a Dostoyevsky short story called White Nights that features a lonely, timid man who falls in love with a woman he meets randomly, though in the story the ""hero"", as he comes to call himself, helps his love reunite with the man she's in love with herself. The 'Black Lake Wolf' could be a nod to Greek myths associating wolves with Apollo, the sun god, as well as Norse mythology's Fenrir, and his sons Sköll and Hati who chased and tried to eat the sun and moon, respectively. Also, Fenrir is supposed to kill Odin, the All-Father, and then be killed himself by one of Odin's sons. I'm sure I've missed a great deal of references from the diary entries and such but that's a lot of vid to re-watch and pause so this is what I've got for now, lol."

The beauty of Mana Spreaders is that they can be used like switches too. Taking the electrical analogy even further, mana pools along the path can work as cells too. My preferred mana setup funnels through a series of several mana pools before accumulating in a single pool just before my Alfheim Portal/Altar/Transmuting/Brewing area. This way, I have several pools in sequence that act as ""overflow"" cells in case one pool gets full (rare when you have several blooms working + alfheim portal open), and spreaders that act as switches for the other mana-consuming devices, allowing me to ""toggle off"" my portal, my altar or my apothecary at will (or all, if I so wish)."

yogscastkim,317ibq,evildrganymede,0,Thu Apr 2 19:01:02 2015 UTC,"Hey Kim! Thought I'd give you a quick guide for how to get the best weapon/hammer in the game in under 30 mins.   The metal you want is Tartarite, it is much better than Manyullyn and you get it from the twilight forest, not the nether. All you need for this is a diamond pick, a crafting table, a furnace and some sticks.   1) Go to the twilight forest and dig down. Get to level 22 and dig around until you find mithril ore - it's very common and turquoise. Smelt three and craft a mithril pickaxe in the crafting table.  2) Dig down to level 15 and search for something called Orichalcum ore. It's a foresty green colour and again, very common. Use your mithril pickaxe to get three ore, smelt them and make an orichalcum pickaxe in the crafting table.  3) You're now ready to make the best metal in the game. Dig down to level 8, and start digging along. This is the hard part - the two ores you need to get from this level are very rare, but you may get lucky. You'll need to find ATLARUS ore, which looks like gold ore but is gold instead of yellow. And you'll need to find ADAMANTINE ore which looks exactly like redstone ore. You'll need to use your Orichalcum pickaxe to mine them both, and they spawn in clusters of about 8 or 9.  4) Put the adamantine and atlarus in the smeltery together to make tartarite. Job done!"
yogscastkim,317ibq,Shatterbird07,2,Thu Apr 2 18:40:28 2015 UTC,"Since the latest TConstruct/Metallurgy changes, Atlarus is no-longer the ""best"" for making Tools and Weapons. It makes fantastic tools (although outclassed by Tartarite and Desichalkos), and is still one of the best materials for Tool Rods, but in the version of TConstruct now the tiers are much more balanced. I believe Kim is already using THIS spreadsheet, but you can see for yourself, Atlarus is no longer god-tier."

yogscastkim,317ibq,Shatterbird07,2,Thu Apr 2 18:57:39 2015 UTC,Tartarite is kind of overrated and kind of hard to get. It's much better to make a sword out of metals with good properties like sanguinite and amordrine.

yogscastkim,30y6is,RokuroCarisu,6,Tue Mar 31 18:16:39 2015 UTC,"I think I figured out why your exit portal is not the same as your entry portal. The same happened to me a lot too. In 1.7.10, the game doesn't seem to recognize any other but the standard shape portal, built out of 14 blocks. So if you built one out of just 10 blocks, or an oddly shaped one like in this series, the game thinks there is no portal in the overworld and creates a new one when you come back from the Nether."

Big portals can cause lag though. Ironically, it appears that the same update that made non-standard portals possible caused the game to recognize only the standard 14-block structure. It scans for one particular arrangement of obsidian blocks, not for valid portals in general."
yogscastkim,30y6is,rlamacraft,3,Tue Mar 31 22:32:39 2015 UTC,"It isn't ironic at all, its just the way the game is coded becomes apparent once they made the change. The game looks for the traditional arrangement of obsidian to find a portal (can't look for portal blocks because it may not be lit). What the devs should have done is look for any complete ring of obsidian. Either its a bug or an intentional optimisation as checking for a complete ring of any size would take a lot longer."

yogscastkim,30y6is,Purified01,3,Wed Apr 1 03:50:39 2015 UTC,"I would like to take this opportunity to plug about the scythe.  The Tinker's Construct scythe is a weapon that has been overlooked by all the series thus far, I'm not quite sure why though, I'd heavily consider making one.  Scythes are truly beastly weapons, and have some great utility with the proper add-ons. They have a 3x3 area effect attack, so anything caught in the range will take damage, this is amazing for taking on dungeons, blood moon armies, and any medium to large group of monsters. I'm not entirely sure about friendly fire, but it shouldn't be an issue as you won't even need to support each other when you can cleave through everything in front of you.   Recommended add-ons for the scythe are quartz and a lava crystal, which lets it ignite mobs and smelt harvested blocks. Vyroxeres is an okay material to make the scythe with. Mass poisoning and fire damage, you'll be a proper death reincarnate without all the hassle of witchery again!  TL:DR, tinker scythes are really scary AoE weapons, put on a lava crystal and stack quartz, enjoy killing entire armies with your death-like powers.  Edit: Just tested with flux era, gone are the days of smelting sand with scythes."
yogscastkim,30y6is,Aeverelle,2,Tue Mar 31 18:45:09 2015 UTC,"The only drawback I see here is that every ore they mine would be insta-smelted by the scythe, and they'd probably miss out on the ore doubling the smeltery does."
yogscastkim,30y6is,06johansenad,3,Tue Mar 31 18:59:27 2015 UTC,"It would only auto-smelt something they mined with the Scythe, wouldn't it? They'd just use hammers for ore digging."
yogscastkim,30y6is,Purified01,2,Tue Mar 31 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"Well, you can't directly mine stone with the scythe, it's more of an exploit of the AoE letting it dig into stone via digging through adjacent dirt. Which is odd, because I'm fairly sure that hammers can't do visa-versa.   It's why I also think it may have been fixed by now, but the glass should surely work.  Edit: my suspicions were correct, scythes can not AoE on sand, nor can they mine stone indirectly in project flux. :(  Auto smelt can still result in a higher ingot-yield if you put fortune on it though. So in may be recommended to make hammers with autosmelt and fortune (and they'll also smelt cobble into stone on mining, so not weird scythe exploit needed)."
yogscastkim,30y6is,PintsizedPint,3,Tue Mar 31 20:24:24 2015 UTC,"/u/Yogscastlalna    Vanilla 101 - Netherportal  The size of a nether portal can range from standard 2x3/4x5 (inside/outside) up to 21x21/23x23. (citation, validation)  Onto Duncan's questions about the Metallurgy - Tinker's Construct interaction:   I don't think rapiers got nerfed, they are ""just"" low damage weapons with fast attack speed and armor penetration, but the damage values of non-Tinker's metals changed as far as I know. I'm pretty sure to remember (but don't quote me) that for example in YCP Tartarite (Metallurgy) was the highest damage material with 4.5 hearts on a rapier, while Manyullyn (TiC) had only 2 or 2.5 hearts of damage. As of now in RR/Project Flux/MC 1.7.10 Tartarite only has 2.5 hearts (still the highest damage, together with two other materials) and Manyullyn is (still) at 2 hearts. Metallurgy metals are fancy but not that useful, apart from much higher durability here and there. Did some tests (on RR v2.3.4.3 Project Flux) and Vyroxeres for example inflicts Poison I, which does 1 dmg (0.5 hearts) per second and lasts for 3 seconds, while one hit with a Vyroxeres Rapier does 4 dmg (and you can hit faster than once per second with a rapier). Inolashite inflicts Posion II which does 1 dmg every 0.5 secs for apparently 2.5 secs. Better than Vyroxeres but still not that great, not to mention that undead mobs and bosses are immune. Withering and slowness are probably more useful effects. In my opinion the only useful metrial trait is Amodrine's life steal, which would spare you from using up one modifier slot to add life steal through necrotic bones. Apart from that you can upgrade the damage of a good TiC sword with quartz or use a decent longbow to 1-hit/shot any common mob or even low-armoured player, at which point no additional effect really matters anymore."
yogscastkim,30y6is,rlamacraft,3,Tue Mar 31 21:39:52 2015 UTC,"From my experience, battle-axes are the best! If you want to use the poison material, add nether quartz to increase the damage so its as good as other materials. Also, adding that necrotic bone will give it life steal!"

yogscastkim,30nc97,Caleb_Aurion,7,Sun Mar 29 06:07:41 2015 UTC,"Combination of different factors, I think. Team Flux Owl were quite lucky, as they got quite a few metals from the lucky blocks they had. Duncan may have lost a few lucky blocks, but so did Lewis.  Lewis died a really silly death the moment the walls came down, and Sjin was killed pretty much instantly by Hannah, leaving Martyn on his own.  I think Hat Films may have had decent stuff - but ultimately, Team Flux Owl had some really good teamwork as well. Kim warned Duncan before Rythian could get a sneaky kill on him, and Ross charged Kim, not taking into account that Duncan was right next to her to back her up.

People want to buy sharp knives and so the manufacturers are not at fault for giving them the option to buy them.  Just like people want their coffee to be served hot and so it is absurd that anyone buying coffee could blame the seller for the coffee being too hot. It would be a different case if you were saying the coffee is defective because it was served in a cup that was prone to spillage, or a cup without a lid, but an action to sue simply because the coffee was too hot should not have succeeded."
yogscastkim,30mfp4,Shatterbird07,9,Mon Mar 30 01:01:07 2015 UTC,"Just some notes on the McDonalds coffee thing Kim mentioned.  The lady that sued McDonalds's for the too hot coffee had some pretty good reasons. First of all, the coffee was way too hot in the first place.  Secondly she wasn't the one driving and thirdly the burns she received to her legs reached NSFW levels.  The big problem is everyone made a joke of her taking McDonalds to court when all she wanted was then to cover her medical expenses. It's a pretty sad story when you look into it."

I could've done it on incognito... but eh, whatever.  According to Wikipedia, the source of completely legitimate facts, G-strings either first appeared in Earl Carroll's productions - known for having the least clothed showgirls on Broadway - or as garments originally worn by Indian women. So yeah, Kim, you pretty much hit the nail on the head there.  EDIT: Well, hit the nail on the head in regards to Earl Carroll. The Indian use might have other reasons."
yogscastkim,30mfp4,TTKB,3,Sat Mar 28 19:28:43 2015 UTC,"The reason you can't see the Hesei Dream in the Lexica Botania right now is that it's ""elven knowledge"" and requires elven materials to craft. So first you'll need to build the elven portal and toss the book into it to upgrade it with elven knowledge entries, then trade the requisite materials for the new recipes.  (In my experience, building and maintaining the portal is quite a chore in SSP if you aren't generating more mana than the portal requires per tick, i.e. using more than just Dayblooms and Hydroangeas and Nightshades. This was before Botania 1.5.169, though, which buffed most flowers, so no idea whether it's any easier now.)"

Just open it, chuck a bunch of stuff in and deactivate it again by (re-)moving one of the blocks.

It could be made better if  you moved the altar a bit and put a mana spreader next to the pool the altar is currently next to and bind it to the altar.  This will allow the spreader to pull mana directly out of the pool and send it to the altar speeding things up considerably.  it would look like this.  Also the version of botania in your pack is a bit outdated.  Lizbeth added some nice new things in the most recent version.  Like a pouch for holding mystical flowers.

I did the event well from the first try, but I was seriously worried Kim would've missed something - and I'm really glad she didn't.  I've heard that quite a few Let's Players fail the event simply because they have to record it all and tend to skip looking at all the little things. But it really pays off. Like knowing that Kate has a doting father, while her mother was much angrier about the whole thing.  I also fingerpointed Nathan because of the reasons Kim gave. Jefferson didn't help but wasn't to blame, and David Madsen seems to have good intentions (?).  Also, let's theorise! spoiler  And of course, remember: Nobody is alone. All your problems can be solved. People would miss you. And there is no shame in seeking professional help.   Stay safe everyone.  EDIT: ...

Like if Kim didnt sneak around in Kate room she wouldn't knew about Kate father. Also i would shoot Frank since then you keep gun, yes you get on bad side of pot diller but he at least dont weild firearms. I pointed Nathan as culprit of Kate suicidal attempt too. As far as we know he is rich kid parting wildly, violate girls, pushing drugs and abusing their family status to cover his mischef.

Sure, Chloe wasn't too happy about it, but then again I didn't really like her attitude in this episode.

There is always a better solution and it always gets better, people forget what happened and move on with their lives. For example Kate is depressed about the video that went viral but give it a week or so and people would have forgotten about the whole incident and that is what makes suicide a real issue. People think that their lives are over, but their not! Suicide is never the right option, you might think that by ending your life you are fixing everything but instead you are just causing more pain to everyone. People who care about you get extremely hurt and depressed by the fact that they have lost someone they really care about sometimes even committing suicide themselves.  I have probably worded this terribly and have done a poor job of explaining why you should never commit suicide but the TL;DR is don't commit suicide, you only cause more pain to others than your fixing and things will always get better with time"
yogscastkim,30ihd1,LiamNosliw,5,Fri Mar 27 19:52:00 2015 UTC,"You have to remember with Kate that it's more than the video going viral. She was drugged at the party and was likely seriously assaulted. Also, Kate's family is devoutly religious, so the scenes in the video would have been shameful for them, which puts additional pressure on Kate.  It's not a good idea to tell someone who is suicidal that they will cause pain to their loved ones, it will likely make them feel guilty and ashamed, which will make them feel even worse. It's best to offer reassurance and support. Most importantly, just be a good listener and non-judgemental."

I'm glad you talked to David Madsen this episode as well, I think you're spot on with the ""has good intention but is heavy handed"" comment.  The one thing that I don't agree with is how you thought the principal is supposed to believe you based on your word. The principal was right in saying that its a serious accusation and to not believe you without looking into it first. If someone accused me of having a gun when I didn't I wouldn't want the principal to believe him/her right away based on their word alone. The authorities should investigate a case with an open mind and be influenced by evidence, not just someone pointing a finger."
yogscastkim,30eooq,virgash,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:50:23 2015 UTC,"I agree, to a point. While a serious accusation like Nathan having a gun shouldn't be automatically taken as true, it also shouldn't be brushed off in the way it was just because Nathan has connections. I took the fall for something awful once, something I had nothing to do with, just because the guidance counsellor was good friends with the family of the girl who accused me. I never got a chance to defend myself against the accusations. It can be tough to handle such things in a way that is fair to everyone involved."
yogscastkim,30eooq,Ripplez13,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:17:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, I should have clarified that I also wouldn't want something to be dismissed just because I'm accusing someone prominent. In my opinion though the principle (and Mr. Jefferson) didn't brush it off, Max asked if he had talked to Nathan and he just told her what Nathan told him. Right after he states Nathan's side, he tells her that they'll discuss it when he has more facts. Also she is asking a day after she told the principle, normally situations like this take more time than that to get things sorted out. I know there is an element of ""Nathan's family owns the school"" that has been coming into play, but there is an event at the end of this episode that makes me believe the principle is acting without worrying what Nathan's family could do. Though that event will almost certainly revolve around other choices and how other things play out, so Kim will probably get something different from what I had. Also sorry to hear that, I've had a friend blamed for something serious but luckily he got it sorted out."

yogscastkim,30eooq,theomega000,3,Thu Mar 26 20:25:24 2015 UTC,"My opinion of David Madsen has softened as well. I think he is likely suffering from his experiences in the military, he possibly has Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I think he showed his vulnerability when he said ""I don't want to fight with anyone anymore"". Also, I believe that the questioning of Kate and surveillance is a part of some sort of investigation into Rachel's disappearance, which I think he is doing because he genuinely cares about the students safety, and can see the effect it is having on Chloe. I'm finding him one of the more interesting characters in the story."

It's really easy to craft, it just takes some diamonds, emeralds and obsidian, but GOD the place is awful.  Also another pet bites the dust lava. I think the death of Tiddles I was Duncan's fault, as he basically poured lava onto its face. The death of Tiddles II was less so, because on one hand golden lasso's and safari balls (EDIT: Safari balls? Safari nets rather. I blame Kim and Duncan for talking about Pokémon) were obviously a better option, but on the other hand they didn't know they would end up at Bebop's portal which was surrounded by lava. I won't consider Lady's death Duncan's fault as she basically beelined to the lava pit - but the pen is there for a reason and I suppose it would've been better if she'd just stayed in there. Eh.  Tiddles III probably suffocated in a wall when the rejuvenation missile hit PandaLabs, so at least that one didn't die a fiery death. And maybe so did Barnabus - but he's still with us in spirit, reminding us to like the video :p"

This game also has arguably one of the most amazing sound tracks from the SNES era.  Kefka was such an evil villain who actually pulled off some pretty evil plans. that and the taunting just made me want to beat him up. The magic system was also very fun too.  it's true that this was before 3D became mainstream but I think that just allowed the company to put more effort into world development, gameplay and story. this is what the game looked like while walking around http://pocketmedia.ign.com/pocket/image/article/764/764961/final-fantasy-vi-advance-20070215044811900-000.jpg while this is during battle http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/df/WikibattleFF6.PNG  here's a link to a remastered playlist. personally I enjoy Devil's Lab though most of the songs are very moving. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihg3eBrL9Uc&index=1&list=PLBdL0iJj-imYL0i1kzPXHwuLs5w5-YXXn"

In the first episode when Chloe was introduced she felt like a person who was dealing with some issues, but did her best to still be a good friend. This episode just made her out to be toxic with getting upset about taking a phone call from a friend in need and peer pressuring Max to take the gun even though she clearly didn't want to touch it. I hope she isn't this bad in the next few episodes if we are supposed to be ""best friends"" because I honestly would be staying away from her if I was Max."

yogscastkim,309vwp,Leothefox,5,Wed Mar 25 20:16:02 2015 UTC,"This article was posted to /r/LifeIsStrange a few days ago by someone who lives in Northern California (where Life Is Strange takes place). The focus of the article is about the dialogue and the language used by the characters which, while it may seem over-the-top and exaggerated to people not from NorCal (and I admit I kind of felt like that at first), is how they speak over there.  To be honest I think it's just because we're so used to that one kind of American city we see in most American movies. Using slang that is only really spoken in one part of the world will always seem unnatural and fake to people who have never encountered it in real life. And even more so when we don't even see it in big movies or games."
yogscastkim,309vwp,DuckOfDuckness,3,Thu Mar 26 01:59:08 2015 UTC,"Totally with Kim in how Chloe feels really... over the top. It's every 'rebel' stereotype crammed into one. Drugs, vividly dyed hair, guns, booze, cigarettes...  I think 'Life Is Strange' has some real potential and the overall story is interesting enough, I just think it's a bit blunt.   Alot of the dialogue feels very stilted and artificial and all of the characters feel like exaggerated stereotypes.  Victoria is the extreme b**ch, Nathan's the edgy rich kid who can get away with everything, Kate's not just quiet and chaste - she's quiet and chaste because she's super religious. Even Max is a pretty cliche' representation of an arts/photography student. I know that we've all known kids who fall into these stereotypes at our secondary (high) schools and I suppose that gives it a certain type of familiarity but people IRL are never quite this exaggerated.   There are a few redeeming characters - Joyce feels like a genuine mother, torn between loving her challenging daughter and her new husband. Warren feels like a reasonably realistic representation of a normal person with typically 'geeky' interests, it's nice that they haven't made him a total nerd and I was pleasantly surprised in a way to see him willing to fight Nathan and not be a non-physical coward (as would be the stereotype of a geek).  I really hope that in future episodes (or more likely in a potential sequel) we see characters with more fluid depth and not these huge, exaggerated, cliche' character flaws. I still think the game has alot of potential, I just feel it could be alot better with a more culturally-sensitive writer."
yogscastkim,309vwp,Leothefox,2,Wed Mar 25 20:12:33 2015 UTC,"I don't quite agree with you on the characters, but maybe that's because I've played through all of Episode 2 and tried to explore every single dialogue and interaction option I could find.  Spoilers incoming for the part of the game we have seen in Kim's LP so far:  Yes, Victoria is bitch, but only really when she's around her ""minions"" who expect her to be. In the scene that plays after the end of this episode you also see a slightly different side of her.  Nathan has deep self-esteem issues, he isn't just the edgy rich kid who can get away with everything. At the start of the first episode, listen to what he says in his little monologue. Those are not the words of someone who's in control and is cruising through life. He has fallen into a role at the school and everyone expects him to continue that. Even though the stress is gnawing at him he just can't get out of that.  Kate is not quiet and chaste because she's super religious. She used to hang out with Alyssa and Stella. She used to be really happy and play the violin every morning, but she stopped the week before the game started. There is also no evidence that she was preaching religion to anyone, the only real mention is that she was abstaining from sex because of her religion. The reason she's quiet and sad now is the video from the Vortex party she went to where she was drugged, and everyone bullying her about it. Apart from her dad and Max, everyone seem to be hating on her (from her POV anyway) and none of the teachers are any help. In short: We're seeing her in the middle of a depression, of course it seems exaggerated if you compare it to a mentally healthy person.  And Max is a few different things depending on the decisions the player take. At the core I guess she's an introvert, but not even an exaggerated one. Heck, I'm even more introverted than she is and I exist. Suddenly she also has the power to rewind time. You can't really know how a person would react to that, but I feel like Dontnod made a nice guess."
yogscastkim,309vwp,DuckOfDuckness,2,Thu Mar 26 02:45:34 2015 UTC,"You're right about Nathan, he clearly has self esteem issues and suffers from pressures of being looked up to or expected upon in some ways and having money (and owning the authorities) means his responses to such pressures are more elaborate. He's effectively a slightly edgier version of 'Andrew' from 'The Breakfast Club' if you've ever seen that, you can also really argue that Victoria is just 'Claire' from Breakfast Club too. (If you haven't seen it, watch it sometime it's a definitive coming-if-age movie and is pretty good.)  Fair point about Kate, I phrased that badly. It's not really because she herself is perhaps overly chaste (which teenager is?) it's the whole super-religious family pressuring (intentionally or otherwise) her and it still feels like a somewhat overused concept. That said, the way the game handles her depression and certain events which can possibly happen later is admirable.  And perhaps I was a bit harsh on Max. She's a player character in a game based on choices, of course she's going to be a bit thin in terms of characterisation sometimes, as the game focuses increasingly on relationships and effects of choices. Max herself is just a figure to be moulded into whatever kind of person suits your playstyle. Like Lee in the Walking Dead could be a polite, calm, diplomatic character or a determined, badass, man-of-action dependent on your choices.  In any case, isn't it nice to have a polite debate once in a while? Can you imagine if either of us had stated either of these viewpoints in Youtube comments?"
yogscastkim,309vwp,Leothefox,2,Thu Mar 26 16:53:43 2015 UTC,"Can you imagine if either of us had stated either of these viewpoints in Youtube comments?   Sweet mother of episodic games, I wouldn't wish such an experience on my worst enemy.  I haven't seen The Breakfast Club, no. I'll try to check it out at some point.  I agree with you that the overly religious family is used a lot, but I don't think that it necessarily makes the game weaker. Granted, Oregon is pretty far away from the Bible Belt, but the US does have some extremely religious groups. Kate is lucky she's even allowed to live on her own at such a ""young"" age considering the cases you hear about occasionally in the (real) news.  Speaking YouTube comments, I can recommend AlienTube for anyone not already using it. It replaces comments on the video with reddit comments (but also gives you a button to show YT comments just in case)."
yogscastkim,309vwp,DuckOfDuckness,2,Thu Mar 26 17:12:22 2015 UTC,"With Chloe, I feel like this isn't the stereotypical ""acting out"". She's had a lot of bad things happen in her life. Her best friend moved away, her father died, her mother married a somewhat-psycho dude, and her new best friend was possibly kidnapped and killed. While that doesn't excuse her behavior, it might explain some of her behaviors and actions with certain things. That's the kind of vibe I'm getting (I do agree with Kim on how she's a bit emotionally manipulative).  Also, I read an interesting theory about what happened to Rachel on Tumblr, but I'll save that for later because it involves a character we haven't seen yet this episode, and I want to see if their actions in this episode contribute to the theory."

I organise, record, edit, create thumbnails, upload, schedule, do all the back end YouTube stuff for ALL of my videos apart from the Flux Buddies series. Ultimately, I'm juggling a lot of work and information all the time. So it helps me to bulk edit and upload/thumbnail/schedule/admin series like this in one go, rather than keep returning continuously and creating the illusion that I have the time to record, edit and upload every single video on the day it's due to go out. For the record - I was up at 7am yesterday so I could record, edit, thumbnail, upload all of Life is Strange, and still record 3 hours of Cornerstone too. I didn't finish working until 10pm last night, and I was in the office at 9.30am this morning for today's recordings and editing. This also helps me cover days where I'm either out of office on a shoot or taking a day off from the internet.

yogscastkim,308gw7,SquirrelPowa,3,Thu Mar 26 21:41:43 2015 UTC,"I myself prefer how Kim goes about her YouTube process. When I was part of the TGN Minecraft network (I made videos from them and my own channel) I would also record/edit/thumbnails/upload and schedule. The reason behind this is that I think it is more organised, well for me personally.  This meant I could schedule my own channels videos and then focus on working on my series for the TGN Minecraft network. Yeah it does mean if anyone happens to go through the playlist they will see any videos that are on private but at least they know there is more to come at least haha."

So yeah, you should just use plain stone for the Rune of Earth.  (Oh man, all this dinosaur talk reminds me I really need to watch Duncan's Park one of these days.

yogscastkim,305xpo,ShikadiLord,6,Tue Mar 24 21:30:22 2015 UTC,"Just a general tip, when a NEI recipe is sorting through an item it is using something called ore dictionary. It gives certain items from various mod the same value so the all work in the same recipe. For example the rune of earth cycled through stone block and everything that was ore dictionaried with it and that is why you saw all the colored stone. You will notice this a lot with recipes that use glass and with mod packs that have multiples of 1 metal type."

Since you weren't standing next to the egg when it hatched, there is only one other way to tame Alan: First you should start looking for Scarab Gems, which drop extremely rarely from fossil ore, but can also be found in (vanilla!) dungeon chests, possibly in village chests as well. Once you got a Scarab Gem, you sadly need to fight Alan. Get him down to 7 HP, upon which he will lay down on the ground. Then use the Scarab Gem on him. He should be tame then. Also, while he is untamed, Alan will become hostile when he gets hungry. Make sure you don't forget to feed him!"

yogscastkim,305jok,Barnabus_Bot,5,Tue Mar 24 17:37:06 2015 UTC,"I like how this game is trying to tackle some serious issues, but Max's response to Kate about the Police made me uncomfortable. Abuse victims often feel they can't speak out because they won't be believed and I don't think that's a good message to reinforce."
yogscastkim,305jok,nanosounds,12,Tue Mar 24 18:36:22 2015 UTC,"I agree. I really didn't like the binary nature of her response - either you go to the police, or the police won't believe you so you need to suffer in silence. In real life, I'd advised Kate to go to a teacher or councellor (or school nurse?) and sat there with her while she talked it out. I don't like that teachers and authority figures in this game are so...aggressively against students and have no time for them, or don't believe them. I don't know of any teachers in my life that wouldn't tell you to naff off after an accusation like that. They'd at least do the decency of investigating the situation, rather than harshly turn away a girl who's so obviously distressed.   I'll be honest, I spent a lot of time humming and haaing at this point because I wasn't sure how the game would react to my decision. I ended up choosing what I felt a bit more in line with, but I'm not happy about it. I'm worried.   NB - what I've said here doesn't mean I think it's a bad game - I'm so enraptured in it! I'm just upset that I can't do what I'd do as a person, which is to wrap Kate up in a big ball of hugs, and go on a crusade."
yogscastkim,305jok,LiamNosliw,3,Tue Mar 24 19:07:07 2015 UTC,"IRL what I would of done is told Kate that she should go to either the police or a school counsellor  but she should also try and get a bit more evidence in what happened, maybe try to ask bystanders if they knew what happened."
yogscastkim,305jok,RGPFerrous,2,Tue Mar 24 19:43:21 2015 UTC,"I would have made the same choice in the game as well, especially after the way the principal reacted to the Nathan situation. It seems Nathan's family has a lot of influence in the town so getting proof is the smart choice. I just didn't like the “you won't be believed response” it hit a bit close to home for me. Also, I agree about the authority figures; it would be nice to see a few sympathetic adult characters in the game, I think it would portray a better message for people in those types of situations. I just hope Kate’s story has a good conclusion.  P.S. I might join you on the crusade :)"
yogscastkim,305jok,virgash,3,Tue Mar 24 21:14:47 2015 UTC,"I do find that this game skirts the edge of being a bit ""too real"" and visceral when it comes to things. Not that it's in any way a bad thing, but it's sort of a shock to the system when it happens, and it makes you scream at the screen when it happens. I think that's a pretty good way of making you think about things, despite it being the ""wrong"" message."
yogscastkim,305jok,RGPFerrous,2,Tue Mar 24 18:38:48 2015 UTC,"If you think this is edging on ""too real"" just wait till later in the episode. A lot of choices in this episode and the last one build up to something big. I like how the developers decide to take on some serious topics that are usually avoided by them. I'm not saying this is how you handle serious situations like this, but they should be handled on a case-by-case basis."
yogscastkim,305jok,evildrganymede,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:48:16 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to agree, and the way they address these stories are really bold, to the point where they make me quite uncomfortable.

yogscastkim,305jok,nanosounds,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:53:10 2015 UTC,"Is it going to end up like the Butterfly Effect movie? That was a really disturbing film in a lot of ways (and not because it starred Ashton Kutchner, who was surprisingly bearable), but had a similar theme I think.  (I've not watched the new Life is Strange videos, I watched the first ep and it really wasn't my thing, partly because of the teen drama and partly because it did remind me of the Butterfly Effect movie...)"

yogscastkim,305jok,nanosounds,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:35:25 2015 UTC,"So far hasn't Life is Strange been a prime example of the Butterfly Effect. Not doing one thing, such as not warning Alyssa about the toilet paper will piss her off meaning she does not want to talk and therefore will later on not tell you something really important. Plus as we have all seen countless times in Life is Strange, there's a tornado."

yogscastkim,305jok,SpaceShipRat,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:15:10 2015 UTC,"It's Nathan Prescott. Remember how the principal didn't believe Max when she told him he had a gun? Because his parents 'own' the school and basically the town iirc? Yeah, same deal there, if his parents are as important as all that, then the cops (especially since, to quote Gotham, 'everyone has a Cobblepot') would probably react the same way. I don't like it either, but that's how it seems to be."
yogscastkim,305jok,geode1214,1 point,Wed Mar 25 02:40:34 2015 UTC,"I think the game did that on purpose: It illustrated why people might not go to the police after being assaulted, by making you decide not to do it.  We've all seen people say online: ""Well, why didn't you go to the police then""? Or we've even said it ourselves, because it seems an obvious choice, and the simplest thing in the world.  It's easy when we're judging from afar, but this game puts you in a situation where that choice is more frightening than the alternative. The kid is spoiled by his rich and therefore powerful parents. The principal already sided with him once. Your room was vandalized after you ""snitched"". You're led to think that if you go to the police now, you'll just make your life harder.  I think the devs said something pretty deep with this choice, and everything leading up to it."

It's definitely worth a play, as it's an interesting game and gaming experience, but I personally don't champion it. I guessed the killer right from the off thanks to a rather clunky obvious clue (maybe I just watch too many crime dramas), and I found some of the characterisations too...shallow. Also - awkward video game sex. And if I have to press X to Jason one more time, I'm going to have a nervous breakdown. But despite what I've said, it is definitely worth a play as I appreciate that it brings a different gaming experience into light, and I love any developer that tries something different, and I live in hope that Cage will really nail the balance between character/story and gaming interaction in his next title (Beyond: Two Souls still felt a bit too clunky for me, although better than Heavy Rain).

That by itself doesn't sound too bad, does it? Well, in addition to exploding they will aggro all Zombie Pigmen nearby, so even if you survive or escape the explosion you'll be in big trouble. Plus the explosion might flood the area with lava from lava pockets.  So yeah, trust me, you don't want to do that. Ever. Ores from other mods (e.g. Vulcanite, Vyroxeres, Sanguinite and others from Metallurgy) and vanilla Quartz are completely safe, though, which is good because those are the useful ones.  The one reason to mine ores from Nether Ores is that they can be smelted in a regular furnace to obtain twice the amount of their overworld equivalent ore blocks (e.g. two Gold Ore for one Nether Gold Ore), which can then be put into whatever ore processing pipeline you want (Tinkers' smeltery, Mekanism x3/x4/x5 ore processing, etc.) to increase their output even further.  EDIT: Oh, forgot to mention that Dense Ore versions of ores from Nether Ores in this pack seem perfectly safe to mine. It's a convenient mod interaction oversight."
yogscastkim,2ztz0j,ShikadiLord,2,Sat Mar 21 21:25:12 2015 UTC,"If it helps, I made a chart a while back of all the materials with special effects and how to get them. I was playing Yogscast Complete at the time, but I think the only change in RR3 is that they added one or two effects. Shadow Steel (Weakness II + Reinforced II), Vulcanite (Ignite II), and Inolashite (Poison II) are all pretty easy to get in the Nether. Life Steal is pretty OP, so you might want to make Amordrine too. You can make some amazing weapons if you just know what to look for.  Sanguinite is hard to find and requires a level 5 pick (e.g. manyullyn or vulcanite), but it's one of the best metals in the game for tool heads and sword blades. For comparison, steel has a mining speed of 8 and a base damage of 1.5, while sanguinite has a mining speed of 12 and a base damage of 4."
yogscastkim,2ztz0j,Torkmatic,2,Sat Mar 21 21:01:08 2015 UTC,"From what I've played of RR3 on the new Project Flux server, Tinker's Construct/Metallurgy got nerfed hard. Sure they added in longbows, crossbows, shurikens and javelins to spice up the ranged arsenal, but all the sword blades from Metallurgy had their elemental effects removed and the highest base damage (for Tartarite and Mekanism's Refined Glowstone) is 2.5 hearts. Amordrine's lifesteal: gone. Vyroxeres' poison: gone. The only way to use those effects is to craft the basic non-TC sword with the ingots. The only special attributes I can see in NEI are Reinforced (which Obsidian already has in base TC), Heavy (from Thermal Expansion's Lead) and Fancy (from Thermal Expansion's Electrum).  I could be wrong, but that would mean that the interface is bugged and that everything is still there even though it's ""invisible."" Haven't tested this firsthand."

So unprepared for nether, where is the backpacks? Why so slow hammers? I played resonate rise 3 using the yogs mod and few others last week for a number of hours.  Its not hard to get steel and use that to get vulcanite with which you can get Sanguinite.   Redstone up a Sanguinite (or even vulcanite) hammer with silk touch and your home free.  No nether expolosions with silk, no angering locals, and blocks can be ground at base for higher returns.   Sanguinite is easy find, just dig down.  Sanguinite, Vyroxeres and quartz are plentiful lower down.  Got 2 full stacks of Sanguinite in no time.   Then using Ender IO SAG mill fully upgraded with steel grinding ball and Octadic Capacitor you get 3x+ on most things. Especially nether redstone, coal and lapiz(tinkers luck).   Also fully upgraded steel shurikens with quartz and 1 knockback are really deadly.  Think they might have armor piercing.   Because the closer you are to target the more damage they do.  I attacked a ""rare"" monster that reflexed the shuriken back at me and it killed me instantly.   Nether also contains quite a bit of nether diamonds and some platinum.   Also with vulcanite so plentiful combined with SAG mill you can get a ton of ingots.  2x vulcan ingots = blaze rods.

(Same thing for Ross later. C'mon guys, you could've unlocked another character!)  Also, Kim did a pretty good dodge at 6:35! If Smith hadn't just spammed arrows at her she would've been in a real good position then.  The moonstone map is unlockable via the versus, when you play the first map after having played every one at least once. It has blocks that players can go through - but not arrows.

yogscastkim,2zrio4,formalmooshroom,6,Sat Mar 21 01:22:06 2015 UTC,"Two notes for possible improvement: 1. The Direwolf20 pack (used for cornerstone) doesn't have Metallurgy so every metal/alloy you mentioned doesn't exist there. ""Shiny metal"" currently has the highest dmg in that pack, followed by manyullyn and steel. Adressing it to Fluxpack would be more suitable. 2. Since version 1.0.4, the DW20 pack contains a more up to date version of Tinkere's Construct with a bunch of new ranged weapons. Of those ranged weapons the Longbow is the most powerful as far as I know and called OP multiple times in DW20's Forgecraft series. While rapiers are good melee weapons due to their speed+armor penetration and cutlasses due to their speed+critical strikes, they get eclipsed by the longbow. For example from some tests I did: a shiny metal rapier does 5 dmg per hit to an iron golem (out of the 100 health shown by WAILA, presumably an unarmourd target), a shiny metal cutlas does 9 and can crit for 14, a shiny metal cleaver does 14 and in compariosn a pink slime longbow (distinctly the highest dps material in the DW20 pack, followed by plastic and blue slime - green slime, wood and cactus also have good values) together with shiny metal arrows does ~40 dmg, or 20 hearts respectively. It is a reckless killng tool that obliterates every common mob or player who isn't heavily armored (everything else ""just"" gets rekt).  Edit: Had a sneak-peak into RR/Fluxpack and it looks like tartarite and shiny metal (and refined glowstone) are on par as the highest dmg materials, though tartarite has a much higher durability which helps for using the flux modifier instead of moss. Kim's beloved osmium is on second place amongst others. Also due to currently only arrowheads having Metallurgy/TiC integration, pink slime is the most efficient longbow limb material in both packs."
yogscastkim,2zrio4,PintsizedPint,3,Sat Mar 21 03:29:37 2015 UTC,What about the flux pack? Does that have Metallurgy? Because the original post could also apply to flux buddies 2.0
yogscastkim,2zrio4,magmafrost,5,Sat Mar 21 08:40:48 2015 UTC,"Metallurgy is in Project Flux. However I do wish to add that shiny ore is pretty rare, so it might not be that easy to get shiny tools quickly. Metals like steel and mithril (found in the Nether and the Twilight Forest) are pretty good for tools before upgrading, I think. Tartarite is pretty up there, but it IS an alloy from two other fantasy metals."

yogscastkim,2zluj6,OmegaX123,3,Thu Mar 19 18:37:32 2015 UTC,"Since this is a rather decorational episode the following fyi probably fits nicely: Kim if you want to ""repay"" Duncan with neat decorational stuff, Botania has a bunch of vanity items (purely cosmetic) which go into the bauble amulet slot in most cases. I don't remember right now if one of you is a fan of the Legend of Zelda franchise but chances are that the ""Eerie Mask"" (name in NEI) might appeal to you (screenshot).  Also on a less decorational note, made a small edit to my botania guide once again. I added the mentioning of decorational items, the assembly halo (which Hannah might be more interested in since she always carried something portable to craft with) and the ""Rod of the Seas"". The rod you can put together with a mana tablet into an autonomous activator as an alternative to automated refilling of the petal apothecary with the everful urn. Just put the activator under the apothecary, give it a bit of power (screenshot1), put the rod in slot 1, mana tablet anywhere (tablet just needs to have a little bit of mana, rod uses a tiny amount), change mode from round robin use to first slot only (screenshot2) and your good to go.  Another thing, too late now but maybe for the future, there are plenty of ways not to waste hours mining obsidian. One of which you could have done right there was to get a portable tank (e.g. basic portable tank from thermal expansion, 4 glass 1 copper), a bucket to fill said tank with lava/water, put a smeltery drain pointing upwards on your smeltery, put the tank on top and set it to orange output mode with a wrench. Taadaa pourable obsidian fast & fresh from your smeltery (screenshot)."
yogscastkim,2zluj6,Coolguy5132,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:25:06 2015 UTC,The Black Books reference threw me off because I was expecting her to talk about the episode where they get a piano. That works too though!
yogscastkim,2zm5tj,Claguej,8,Thu Mar 19 19:06:18 2015 UTC,"Yup! The first part is a meet and greet where you can say hi, let us scribble our signatures on you, and take photos with us where Turps photobombs everything and I squint because of all the camera flashes - then it's the 'Yogscast plays games real bad' at 5pm! See you there! Please don't give me the flu."
yogscastkim,2zm5tj,nanosounds,2,Thu Mar 19 19:25:01 2015 UTC,Are there still tickets available? I'm not sure if I'm able to go yet!
yogscastkim,2zm5tj,Vamprat,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:45:28 2015 UTC,"I think there is, Duncan put out a video today about it."
yogscastkim,2zm5tj,Vamprat,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:49:13 2015 UTC,Oh thanks for that!
yogscastkim,2zm5tj,LiamNosliw,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:59:03 2015 UTC,No problem.

yogscastkim,2zm0el,Vamprat,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:25:56 2015 UTC,What happened?  EDIT: Never mind
yogscastkim,2zm0el,SquirrelPowa,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:34:19 2015 UTC,Will need to get TF2 reinstalled again and I shall try to pop on

yogscastkim,2zm0m9,Vamprat,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:46:08 2015 UTC,I guess I should ask this as a preventative measure: Do we know if the EnderIO Capacitor Banks are still broken or not?
yogscastkim,2zm0m9,AlloyMorph,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:05:14 2015 UTC,They work fine now. Go for it. :P
yogscastkim,2zm0m9,Vamprat,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:09:59 2015 UTC,Is the fluid transposer the one that melts down Redstone and ender pearls?
yogscastkim,2zm0m9,merTYol,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:48:10 2015 UTC,"Ahem. Fluidic Transposers are the only way of making Tesseracts, and Cryothium filled conduits etc. wouldnt it be better to block the Tank rather than the machine?"
yogscastkim,2zm0m9,CyberMancerGamer,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"It's not ideal in the slightest I know. The tank wasn't causing the problem though. Removing the tank did not stop the crashing, and other tanks caused the same issue.  All I can suggest is that people use another mod's alternative to Tesseracts and Conduits until we get a patch, it's a reported issue and entirely in the TE dev's hands at this point."
yogscastkim,2zhmwa,Barnabus_Bot,7,Wed Mar 18 17:39:45 2015 UTC,"Oh My Heavens. Props to Duncan, that's got to be the hardest pose to maintain while on a couch. Also that Smiffy smirk dang it, I held my composure until he cracked his pearly whites. I giggled way too hard."
yogscastkim,2zhmwa,miwio,8,Wed Mar 18 18:15:36 2015 UTC,"the live-action bit reminds me of the end of Shawn of the Dead!  Also, Kim's ""Bad Zombie Hair"" is amazing :)"
yogscastkim,2zhmwa,evildrganymede,10,Wed Mar 18 18:30:47 2015 UTC,"I'll admit it, most of my directing was influenced by Shaun of the Dead :p"
yogscastkim,2zhmwa,nanosounds,6,Wed Mar 18 20:05:17 2015 UTC,Only real gamers play video games even when zombified.
yogscastkim,2zhmwa,Aeverelle,6,Wed Mar 18 18:28:56 2015 UTC,Bahaha smiffy can't keep a straight dead face.
yogscastkim,2zhmwa,WhitePawn00,2,Wed Mar 18 23:12:00 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that's Trott.
yogscastkim,2zgeap,mushroomproductions,2,Wed Mar 18 10:54:24 2015 UTC,And it is awesome too
yogscastkim,2zef5v,Aeverelle,7,Tue Mar 17 22:03:22 2015 UTC,"My first mistake here was thinking drawing any sort of building interior would be 'creative and fun'. So yeah, diverting a bit from what I usually draw, but I hope this is sort of what Kim had in mind when building her little kitchen! ^"
yogscastkim,2zef5v,RGPFerrous,5,Tue Mar 17 22:05:53 2015 UTC,This is fantastic and pretty much 100% reproducable inside Project Flux. Fan-flippin'-tastic!
yogscastkim,2zef5v,Wulfyk,3,Wed Mar 18 00:02:30 2015 UTC,"It looks great! I think it would be cool to have a tree in a house, especially a cherry blossom. Actually, while watching Flux buddies, I did a google search and found this."
yogscastkim,2zef5v,RGPFerrous,4,Tue Mar 17 22:31:32 2015 UTC,"Whoa, that looks sweeeet. Shame there's no way anyone would be able to emulate that in Minecraft, it looks majestic!"
yogscastkim,2zef5v,Wulfyk,2,Tue Mar 17 22:40:53 2015 UTC,"uld be able to emulate that in Minecraft, it looks majestic!   Well you could grow regular size sprouce and build glass cylinder around it..."
yogscastkim,2zef5v,DavidTheHumanzee,3,Tue Mar 17 23:06:44 2015 UTC,"Funny you should mention this. A friend of mine actually built a house based on a similar thing (I wish I had screenshots, but it was basically a ""Tree in a bottle""). It looked fantastic as a concept, but due to the way minecraft does ""edges"" on the glass, it looked really misshapen when viewed from any angle other than the cardinal directions. It also suffers from the fact that any ""Spiral"" staircase either cannot conform to the shape of the glass or has to be hugely exaggerated to function.  TL;DR You can do this, but it doesn't quite look right."
yogscastkim,2zef5v,noob_senpai,2,Wed Mar 18 00:08:27 2015 UTC,"Yes i build several towers and making that goes around edge is impossible, well consisting of only stairs at least. But if you add levels... Yeah still looks not right."
yogscastkim,2zd6fv,Piromile,1 point,Tue Mar 17 16:37:11 2015 UTC,I love this piece. I think it's really cool how you made the flux look like tattoos instead of goo.
yogscastkim,2zdvj5,Barnabus_Bot,4,Tue Mar 17 19:40:16 2015 UTC,"The way you want to build your shed around the tree takes me back to the Chozo Architecture from Metroid that you could quite easily take from.  Metroid Prime has some interesting examples of this (albeit ruined and poisoned by the planet's corruption): In some places, structure has been pushed aside by the growth of nature (even if it is twisted and malformed), whereas in others, structure has had the biological elements incorporated into it's structure.  It strikes me though that you are going for a sort of ""Build around nature without touching it"", similar to the Arboretum (I couldn't find a screenshot of the non-poisoned version, or of the sky above it, so I'll do my best to explain)  The room is basically built AROUND a huge tree, leaving a good ten to twelve feet between the tree and the structure (in minecraft terms, that would be three blocks-ish from the trunk or the leaves. Around it at certain levels there are ""Rings"" that extend a little to function as walkways, allowing people to tend to the tree without restricting it's growth. These are ornate and highly patterned, which could be easily re-created with chiseled sandstone (or any other fancy chisel block) for the feel of a ""Shrine to Nature"" built around the one particular tree. The room is open to the sky around the tree, but is sheltered by the canopy so does not rain inside, and at the base the tree is allowed space for the water and soil it needs to spread it's roots.   Un-corrupted, even in it's ruined state, the Arboretum is quite an evocative image of the Chozo's respect for (and almost symbiotic relation with) the planet and it's natural formations, and would be quite a good base point for your structure!"
yogscastkim,2zdvj5,RGPFerrous,3,Tue Mar 17 22:40:30 2015 UTC,"Anything Metroid inspired is an A+ from me.  I think the thaumcraft silver woods would fit the bill for an arboretum. From what I could see when Kim was exploring earlier in the series, naturally spawning ones were huge compared to what they used to be. Relocating some of them and seeing if they also grow as big would be cool.  They could setup their thaumcraft stuff in such a structure, since they've gone through the effort to gain the aspect unlocks."
yogscastkim,2zdvj5,Purified01,3,Wed Mar 18 03:11:52 2015 UTC,IS THIS WHAT FUN SOUNDS LIKE   Oh god my sides XD

yogscastkim,2zdvj5,06johansenad,1 point,Wed Mar 18 21:05:22 2015 UTC,"Their base is gradually turning into a complex of sorts. I like it! We may need a better name for it than ""Duncan & Kim's base"", though."
yogscastkim,2zdvj5,ShikadiLord,5,Tue Mar 17 22:51:37 2015 UTC,"How about ""Flux Conglomerate""?"
yogscastkim,2zdvj5,Wulfyk,4,Tue Mar 17 23:11:31 2015 UTC,"""Flux Nexus""? (EDIT: Or ""Flux Hub""? ""Flux Central""?)"
yogscastkim,2zdvj5,evildrganymede,2,Tue Mar 17 23:35:57 2015 UTC,I'm liking 'Flux Hub'!
yogscastkim,2zdvj5,Dunkleberry,1 point,Wed Mar 18 13:57:05 2015 UTC,You can use a mortar and pestle to turn Botania flower petals in to dyes which I think work with Decocraft.
yogscastkim,2zdvj5,skavinger5882,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:15:41 2015 UTC,"At last we see the shed that Kim built in her Owl Island cameo!  Funny how there's been no mention of the portal or the Evicted gang coming through it though. Maybe that'll come later in the recording session?  Also....nah, I don't think Kim'll make it through the session without any innuendo. Anyone else want to place their bets? :P"
yogscastkim,2zdvj5,evildrganymede,2,Wed Mar 18 02:34:46 2015 UTC,I give her 11 minutes
yogscastkim,2zdvj5,Gyvon,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:04:09 2015 UTC,I guess whoever did the fan art for this episode figured Duncan would be further into breading chokobos by this point...
yogscastkim,2zdvj5,magmafrost,2,Wed Mar 18 07:00:25 2015 UTC,"If Duncan wants a green Chocobo, he needs to mate a yellow one with a blue one. Two yellow Chocobos can only result in more yellow or blue ones!   Nope (and this is, you'll note, the Resonant Rise wiki) This info might be out of date, but I highly doubt they changed it that much. Will double check with my own Chocopedia next time I'm playing though, if no one else confirms or denies before then."
yogscastkim,2zdvj5,OmegaX123,2,Tue Mar 17 22:38:36 2015 UTC,Ive actually been playing for about a week now and have my own chocobo ranch and it is definitely two yellows that make a green
yogscastkim,2zdvj5,Nopoe_,2,Wed Mar 18 05:18:03 2015 UTC,"You can see duncan reading a chocopedia in one of the early episodes, and he actually found out you can only get green ones by mating 2 yellow ones."
yogscastkim,2zdvj5,WThieves,1 point,Wed Mar 18 10:27:53 2015 UTC,Well I got white from breading two blues and then black from two whites without using golden Gysahls. So Duncan dont need green to get golden one unless he want to have all the colors.
yogscastkim,2zbzim,WThieves,5,Tue Mar 17 09:01:45 2015 UTC,Foci upgrade is really good. Shock focus with full potency and Chain lightning upgrade. 10 damage per hit very easily. from range :)
yogscastkim,2z94na,Barnabus_Bot,5,Mon Mar 16 17:37:06 2015 UTC,"Oh sweet lord Reekrus these acsension videos are entertaining. I'm not even in a Sips video and my dick was orbiting, not earth, but the moon during these videos. Holy culpola of a T-95 these videos are great. I wonder how many episodes they recorded.  Edit: Posted whilst watching i know now."
yogscastkim,2z94na,Winsentti,10,Mon Mar 16 20:43:00 2015 UTC,There's more coming. With a different team.

yogscastkim,2z94na,Hazel-Rah,4,Tue Mar 17 12:32:23 2015 UTC,"My favourite moment from the video. Also, I'm surprised Turps hasn't said ""stick around"" in Arnold Schwarzenegger's accent."
yogscastkim,2z94na,Zibi777,4,Mon Mar 16 20:43:41 2015 UTC,I love Turps' reactions when he lose.
yogscastkim,2z94na,Aeverelle,4,Mon Mar 16 18:28:14 2015 UTC,"Killing yourself with the ricochet arrows - been there many times... Also Kim discovers the Dodge mechanic! Yaaay.  I know the chances are incredibly low that they'll play this again, but there are actually 6 more levels to unlock. They can only be unlocked via Quest Mode (and playing the first or second level on Versus again, I can't remember). Some of these have more special arrows, like bolt arrows and feather arrows. Bolt arrows being among my personal favourites, as they home 100% and will make a few 90° turns to get to a target. Dodging definitely necessary to survive those.  Also the drill arrows are hilarious. I'm sad no one had the ingenious idea of shooting down, because the arrow would go straight through the platform you're standing on. The person below you would never see it coming. Moreover, you can shoot those at either side of the screen and they will come out on the other end, making some VERY sneaky kills.  It's a real shame there aren't that many local coop games these days. I'd recommend anyone with at least two controllers and a friend/sibling/partner to pick this game up as it is an absolute gem!"
yogscastkim,2z94na,Rohri_Calhoun,3,Mon Mar 16 18:53:21 2015 UTC,Bring back Yognews!!!!!
yogscastkim,2z7kvu,evildrganymede,43,Mon Mar 16 07:09:07 2015 UTC,"For the record, I'm totally fine about Hat Films calling me that name - it's just one of those things that came about from a stupid conversation when we were traveling to a convention last year - I mean, giving each other stupid, gross nicknames is something friends do, innit?   The problem is, however, that the audience don't know/see that behind-the-scenes relationship, so a lot of the Hats fans just think that we all out hate each other and call each other rude things, and a lot of Kim fans think the Hats are bullies and arseholes (well...they are arseholes...)...and I've noticed that the Cornerstone audience is VERY, quite unusually angry and divided/loyal to their 'team'.  My real problem is when I see audience members calling me 'Quim' in comments/on reddit...cos, y'know - they're not my friends and don't have the same relationship with me as Smiffy, Trott and Ross. So it's a bit...engh...seeing strangers calling me something quite rude, that most of them don't even know what it means. Imagine if I just started calling you by a semi-rude nickname that your best mate calls you! Weird.  However, the boys and I spoke about it today, as I've gotten a lot of messages over the weekend from concerned/upset viewers - and they're going to tone it down a bit (or at least, insult me with a less vulgar expression!). So hopefully, this kind of unpleasantness will die down, and we'll revert to mischief and cartoon banter.   And yeah - I do feel like our jetpacks, quarry, smeltery, computer, railcraft and apiary hauls have been mostly forgotten :( But Dunc and I have been chatting to other Cornerstone members about what to do next, so hopefully we'll hit that perfect  balance of PVP and Co-op in upcoming episodes!   TLDR: We all love each other really, and it's a good thing you don't get to hear the horrible things we call each other when we play Pokemon The Card Game."
yogscastkim,2z7kvu,nanosounds,21,Mon Mar 16 13:01:14 2015 UTC,And this is why I prefer reddit as a feedback method as opposed to the Youtube comments ^_^
yogscastkim,2z7kvu,RGPFerrous,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:31:16 2015 UTC,the first time I read something in your voice and it just super weirded me out @_@
yogscastkim,2z7kvu,Felonak,5,Mon Mar 16 21:06:10 2015 UTC,This is why I proposed some kind of explanatory disclaimer in which you guys explain that it's all just a game.
yogscastkim,2z7kvu,WThieves,3,Tue Mar 17 08:44:36 2015 UTC,Please live stream a yogscast office Pokemon card tournament. What could possibly go wrong.
yogscastkim,2z7kvu,Donuteater780,1 point,Tue Mar 17 06:18:47 2015 UTC,"I'm really glad you voiced this. The corner stone video are causing a lot of hate for towards all the team involved. I love the banter you have with the Hats, it makes for some really great moments in a series without that connection between the groups would be a little flat :)."
yogscastkim,2z7kvu,Fanglove,-11,Sat Mar 21 22:45:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly? In my experience, giving people stupid, gross nicknames and calling them that all the time isn't something that friends do - it's something that bullies do. I know the Hatters (smiffy especially) are your friends and they aren't really bullying you, but given the way they say it here (usually when they're angry or mocking you for something), it really comes across as something unpleasant and it really hasn't been fun to watch (for me at least).   I feel it's all gotten a bit out of hand in this week's episodes, so it's good to know that you guys are listening to the concerns of the fans and have all talked about it and are calming things down for next time. I would love things to get more cartoony and less personal-sounding :)."
yogscastkim,2z7kvu,nanosounds,25,Mon Mar 16 15:51:50 2015 UTC,"I guess it comes across as bullying in recording because they go into their super aggro modes - y'know GRITS TEETH and all that. I see how it's seen as aggressive and bullying - but trust me, when we're off cam and just hanging out, it's completely different. As someone who was bullied a lot as a kid, I don't stand for this kind of crap now, and I've never felt as though they're bullying me in the office, and I certainly wouldn't allow it to happen. The guys are super nice, so I know that if I felt they'd overstepped a line, I feel comfortable enough to tell them and know they'd apologise and respect that.   But yeah, it doesn't come across comfortably in recent Cornerstone recordings, as evidenced by the numerous messages we've received about it recently. So things will be a-changing!"
yogscastkim,2z7kvu,Adrosmiley,6,Mon Mar 16 16:04:55 2015 UTC,"If you have not done so already I think it would be a good idea to say all of this in a cornerstone video just to make sure everyone understands the situation. Coming from someone who knows the situation behind the scenes, I enjoy the conflict, it adds a bit of spice. :)"
yogscastkim,2z7kvu,rlamacraft,12,Mon Mar 16 22:54:56 2015 UTC,"As long as none of them are taking it personally, then I'm all for it. It makes the episodes funnier and I love the conflict more than the peace. The trial scene where Duncan threw the evidence out the window was hilarious!"
yogscastkim,2z7kvu,Ctri,8,Mon Mar 16 09:14:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty clear that all the Yogs can seperate their YT personas from their RL relationships :)  Look at the glorious ending to Flux Buddies 1 and Hat Corp, there's no way they could have collaborated to make such a fantastic ending if there'd been genuine animosity there.  The way Kim banters with Hat Films is very similar to as if she were actually one of them. I imagine their RL friendship is pretty good based on the playful animosity shown in-series.  That said, I think the backstabbing betrayal works best when the damage inflicted is either superficial / minor, or easily replaced.  The MH Club and HoT's destruction were freaking hilarious for that reason, but the raid on the FB's base slightly less so (but still funny) because they then spent the session relocating."
yogscastkim,2z7kvu,Avalon_blade,1 point,Mon Mar 16 11:16:44 2015 UTC,Lol ya that was funny
yogscastkim,2z7kvu,RGPFerrous,6,Wed Mar 18 02:01:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the sentiment that it's not been pleasant to watch. The isolation and name calling gets on my nerves (I mean, it's one thing to do it to someone's face where you can joke around and it's clearly in good spirits, but constantly in text chat?) because it feels like Flux Buddies versus everyone else, but I have enjoyed the banter that came out of it.  I feel that if someone had come to them once they became public enemy number one and used their status to troll the rest, things could have been more amicable, but that isn't to say I found any of the rest of Cornerstone ""boring"". Yes there are parts I found less enjoyable because of other people's reactions to things, but Kim and Duncan have been very sporting all the way through, which gives me hope that at somepoint this will turn back in their favor."
yogscastkim,2z7kvu,SquirrelPowa,2,Mon Mar 16 10:12:02 2015 UTC,"I can see where you are coming from but it isn't an opinion I share completely. Yes I do think that maybe Hat Films have pushed the whole ""insults and digs"" a bit but it is all in good fun as Kim has said.  I try to watch everyones POV as I enjoy watching everyone and seeing what they are getting up to. Currently it does seems that there are ""sides"" if I can call it that. However it makes it a bit more interesting. I have been enjoying the series overal so far and I think some people have/may over react about this whole situation.  I'm sure things will soon turn the way of Kim & Duncan at some point :)."
yogscastkim,2z7kvu,Safire224,3,Mon Mar 16 18:34:11 2015 UTC,I definitely agree with you on your thoughts towards the Cornerstone series... I thought that it was going to be this cool collaboration between all of the groups but it slowly turned into a free-for-all with stealing and messing with other people's stuff. I also agree that Duncan and Kim seemed to be outcast almost immediately after starting the series when they had done a lot of the major work towards helping everyone else. I loved the idea of the first secret base and the fact that everyone immediately called them out on it despite having done worse is kind of annoying.   I wish there would be some sort of truce between people and actually work together like the original idea had intended with each doing their own job then coming together at the end of each week to discuss progress and what should be done next.
yogscastkim,2z7kvu,DavidTheHumanzee,5,Mon Mar 16 07:14:05 2015 UTC,"I feel people are taking cornerstone too seriously, if you generally think that any yog isn't having fun and is offered or angry in any way then you need a good dose of bantihistamine. It's all banter, if anyone didn't like it in the slightest they wouldn't be doing it."
yogscastkim,2z7kvu,theomega000,1 point,Mon Mar 16 11:30:59 2015 UTC,"I watched the first few cornerstone episodes, but when hatfilms started acting like the arseholes they usually are I had to stop. It just isn't enjoyable for me to watch when a very vocal part of the cast acts like that. Ive avoided watching anything hatfilms is a part of for quite some time and cornerstone hasn't changed my opinion of them"

yogscastkim,2z7kvu,Mancombs,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:37:26 2015 UTC,"I don't get that feeling but maybe it's because i have a very coarse and caustic sense of humour (basically i find hilarious to say the worst thing to say in a situation but only to people who understand me and why i do it, are OK with it and also find it funny). Although i get the feeling that after the whole gold bricks debacle it kind of peaked and now feels a little bit boring. I guess it's build up until the next big rumble (which is why we are here)  I always thought that the Q word meant something like an abbreviation of Queen Kim and was a very mild witty English style insult, but know that everybody is calling it really offensive i did a quick check of the UD and it's a little bit harsh (which i find a little bit evilly hilarious but also thought of worse meanings for it which would be funnier to me but would probably offend 98% of the world), but i think if the recipient it's ok with it then let them have their fun, don't be such prudes.

They are dumb trolls (In-game of course) and only do this so that the serie might get more interesting, and it works! Plus, I love the new location for the secret LAAAAIIIIIRRRRRR. The only problem I have is with Sjin, Hannah and Rythian who didn't take a second to think before ratting Kim and Dunc for the gold they took. Gold that they originally mined and that's the other thing: They only took stuff they've made. When I was watching Sjin's video, they called the flux buddies out for stealing all of their stuff and running away. They didn't run away either! They made a secret base.  Of course they are planning on witching people and other bad stuff, but you know, you get what you deserve for being jerks to a mad scientist and a professional death-killer!  But all in all, it's just a YouTube serie so let's not get too involved in something that is made for our enjoyment! Do you write a hate message to George R. R. Martin every time someone is betrayed in Game of Thrones? Nnnn.... well I can't actually speak for everyone but I know it would be ridiculous to do so.  I love you Kim, keep up the awesome work,  I'm out.  Edit: To all the people I see who thought that Cornerstone was going to be a peaceful serie, well what do you think was going to happen with Hat film in the mix?! It was never bound to happen in a peaceful way."

yogscastkim,2z5x34,Icantbelieveitsbull,6,Sun Mar 15 21:52:44 2015 UTC,"Probably. If cornerstone shall continue towards scheming and war then they might want to all agree on disable player visibility on the minimap (tutorial how to: open journeymap, default ""J"", go to options top right, click minimap preset and fullscreen map, uncheck both player related boxes). Alternatively, since the Twilight Forest has the achievment based progression system they could spend a bit of time progressing there and building a base somewhere unreachable for those without the necessary achievements unlocked. Or just be careful no one is following ^^ what might help with that is hiding a linking book either in the nether or twilight forest for a deceiving detour to trick the pursuers into thinking their new base would be in another dimension."
yogscastkim,2z53vx,Barnabus_Bot,7,Sun Mar 15 17:43:24 2015 UTC,"Get Duncan to empty his inventory and Luggage before he goes exploring again. Seeing him leaving stuff behind or throwing it away just because he coudln't be bothered to make some space is quite frustrating. Make tools and weapons with blue slime rods, steel heads/blades, paper guards/bindings and moss. Blue slime is much stronger than normal green slime, and Steel is about equal to Alumite, but much easier to get! Duncan should revive the Plesiosaurus first, as it is a peaceful creature. Remember to put it in a large body of water though, since it grows pretty large! Don't let Duncan revive a Tyrannosaurus, Spinosaurus or Brachiosaurus before building proper enclosures! They can break any blocks weaker than iron, as Sjin and Lewis are about to find out in a rather unpleasant way. Deinonychus, Utahraptor, Dilophosaurus, Allosaurus, Mosasaurus and Liopleurodon are also not something you would want to mess with. If you get on their bad side, either they will kill you or you will have to kill them. Either way, you would lose. If you hatch a prehistoric animal from an egg, make sure you stand next to the egg when it hatches. That will instantly tame it! If Duncan wants a green Chocobo, he needs to mate a yellow one with a blue one. Two yellow Chocobos can only result in more yellow or blue ones."
yogscastkim,2z53vx,RokuroCarisu,2,Sun Mar 15 19:57:15 2015 UTC,Actually they changed it; green slime is now better than blue slime.  Probably because blue slime is much easier to get in large quantities from slime islands.  Nobody knows what the fuck is up with purple slime.

yogscastkim,2z53vx,RokuroCarisu,1 point,Mon Mar 16 21:59:58 2015 UTC,Well then I stand corrected. In the versions I've been using for the past few months green has been at 2x handle modifier and blue at 1.5x.

yogscastkim,2z53vx,Gyvon,3,Tue Mar 17 02:36:54 2015 UTC,"A few things Kim might've figured out already, since it's evident she made more progress since this session judging by the few appearances their base has made in Hannah and Nilesy's series:   You must point a Mana Spreader at the Runic Altar for it to get any mana at all (also mentioned here in the comments for the previous episode) At the end of the rune crafting process, once the rune progress icon fills up, the Livingrock is to be tossed (Q) in item form on top of the altar, not placed like a block; you then right click with a Wand of the Forest to obtain the finished rune(s) You can attach Mana Spreaders to Mana Pools and point them to blocks that can receive mana like the altar, so you don't really need to dedicate groups of flowers to specific devices. It also bears repeating that you should not point Mana Spreaders at other Mana Spreaders, as some mana is lost in the process of a burst hitting a spreader. If you ever find yourself in need of distributing mana among multiple pools, you should preferably use Sparks (short and medium distance) and the Mana Distributor block (adjacent pools only)."

yogscastkim,2z53vx,helonias,2,Mon Mar 16 09:50:42 2015 UTC,"It's pretty cool that Flaxbeard uses these various kinetic devices powered by steam to accomplish various things.  I don't think an implementation of the thumper is used in real life to mine, but the concept which it's working under is very much a thing. If you can vibrate a material at its resonant frequency, it is possible to make it crumble and break apart. This has occurred before in history.   However I do think the flaxbeard thumper is based off of one of Tesla's inventions. The description of that thing is exactly what the flaxbeard thumper does, though it doesn't generate any power."
yogscastkim,2z53vx,Purified01,1 point,Sun Mar 15 20:13:02 2015 UTC,"There's a specific canyon in the US (I don't remember the name or location of it though) where you cannot build a bridge, because the way that the wind funnels through the valley causes any bridge you try to build to vibrate at the resonant frequency of a structure (made with standard bridge construction materials) the width of the canyon, eventually destroying the bridge when the wind is just so.  Also, Nikola Tesla famously claimed shortly before his death to have designed and tested an ""Earthquake Machine"" capable of creating seismic disturbances of sufficient magnitude to collapse buildings.  No evidence of such a device was ever found, and Tesla was at that point pretty desperate (after Thomas Edison had made it his personal quest to ruin him out of spite, because Thomas Edison was a dick), so it's believed that he was bluffing about having built and tested the device on a large scale, though if I remember correctly the plans for it were found."

yogscastkim,2z53vx,RokuroCarisu,2,Mon Mar 16 22:13:10 2015 UTC,"A couple of bits of useful advice.  Also refer to my post on Episode #16 for some more advice, mostly Botania-related.  ADVICE FOR KIM   When you use the Wand of the Forest to check the mana level of something, it acts as a probe; it tells you the mana level as it is when you click on it, and doesn't update that information until you click on it again.   ADVICE FOR DUNCAN   Duncan, the way that steam works is that it fills up whatever space you give it.  So each pipe also functions as a tiny steam tank.  So to put it in standard power terms, your entire steam system acts as a battery.  A larger system means a larger battery, which means more of a change in energy is needed to change the power level of the battery as a whole.  The battery's power level as a whole determines how much wattage it is capable of outputting."
yogscastkim,2z53vx,T_Weezy,2,Mon Mar 16 01:15:34 2015 UTC,I mentioned it on episode 17 comments but jus in case l will say it again: The manager level doesn't update automatically you need to right click to see its new man level.

yogscastkim,2z1p8k,Zibi777,4,Sat Mar 14 20:20:48 2015 UTC,"Oof. Hmm. Thing about Botania is it relies heavily on automation to get a good, steady supply going. And I'm terrible (ly lazy) at that, so someone else might be able to help there. More than one mana pool is a good start, though.   You don't need one spreader per flower. Stop attaching a new spreader to each flower. Please. Your wand of the forest is actually a magic wrench. Shift click while looking at nothing to change it into bind mode. Click a flower, click the spreader. Bound. Spreaders can handle well over a dozen flowers. But flowers can only send to one spreader at a time, and that spreader can only fill one pool (until you put it on a turnstile; you don't need that yet). It looks like your daylillies are too spread out. They only need to be in a checkerboard pattern. Your runic altar needs a spreader pointed at it, and preferably a few generating flowers that can give you big bursts of mana instead of passive waves. Entropynniums, Rosa Arcanas, or Endoflames are good for that. I gave this link to Rythian a few weeks ago for Cornerstone, but it's still good advice for setting up mana.   Vaskii really tries to make the mod friendly, but I'm thinking she doesn't really know how deep the rabbit hole goes on how easily some of us get confused (I'm bad at Botania too, but I want to like it...)"
yogscastkim,2z1p8k,VioletArrows,1 point,Sat Mar 14 20:00:48 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that if you put a Mana Spreader directly adjacent to a Mana Pool, it will draw mana from the pool and shoot it at a Runic Altar (or other object, such as another Mana Pool).  So you don't necessarily need a separate mana generation system for your Runic Altar.  The advice regarding Entropynniums, Rosa Arcanas and Endoflames is quite solid, though.  Those are my three favorite generating flora.  In fact, if you put a high enough energy density fuel in an Endoflame, it'll go for a very long time!  For example, a Block of Aeternalis Fuel from ProjectE (the revival of Equivalent Exchange 2), will produce mana for hours!!"

They had trouble in site bee because there were hundres of items in pipes and crystal chests that were rendered and going nowhere.  I can recreate that with cobble stone if I wanted to.   That was not a forestry related issue in any way or form and furthermore, that's 1.4.7   - a lot of mods have underwent a lot of performance optimization since then, INCLUDING buildcraft pipes  * Don't get me wrong, it's fine if you don't want it, but if the reason to exclude is misinformation coming from old videos from several minecraft versions ago I'd just like to have that cleared up.

yogscastkim,2z1cf7,Barnabus_Bot,5,Sat Mar 14 17:37:05 2015 UTC,"ALRIGHT I get to talk about a game I actually know stuff about. They might not ever play this game after this but here we go.  I think Duncan needs the most advice for this so... Don't stand still too much! The arrows home slightly so standing still for a while is basically asking to get an arrow to the throat or something. Also, don't just look at yourself or someone you're focusing on - try to keep a general look on the entirety of the screen so you know where the other players are.  The bits that have a green light when you stand on them are basically jump pads. You jump higher on them, that's all. The purple balls are traps sort of, if you jump or walk past them they drop, perhaps on unsuspecting players beneath you (like Duncan experienced once).  Fun thing about the invisibility: holding the analog stick down prevents your character from constantly displaying light, making it a lot harder for others to find you when invisible.  ""Most devious"" means you shot an arrow, which went on one side of the screen and came out the other side, nailing someone. It's either you being pretty lucky or very sneaky!  And please god, please. Use the Dodge mechanic more! Every time you think someone's going to shoot you - just press R2 or L2! The quicker it becomes a reflex to dodge in panic, the more you'll somehow get out of sticky situations.  (Lastly, if you ever play again: toy around with the variants! Exploding corpses, never ending ricochet arrows, completely dark + invisible, ... Things like that can make this game absolutely hysterical to play.)"

yogscastkim,2yxvka,Barnabus_Bot,6,Fri Mar 13 19:17:29 2015 UTC,"Well now. Normally I don't comment on what happens in an episode for spoilers' sake, but the title pretty much gives it away already. So I'll just say it straight: you need to hide the entrance to a ""secret"" lair MUCH better than that.   Think in this situation Kim: What Would Batman Do? He'd set up in a remote location like you did, for certain. But he'd also assume that somebody would go looking for his hideout, if not by tailing him then by simply searching the area out of happen-stance. Everyone who could look for you can fly and they would certainly be flying whilst exploring a remote location for you, so the first priority is straightforward: hide the entrance from bird's eye view. Not just with camouflaged doors; block line of sight with the open sky so that even if you're spotted leaving the area your observers still won't be able to enter your Batcave.  What else would Batman do? Use darkness to his personal advantage of course. This is more than just ""shadows are hard to see in"": the environment around the entrance can be carefully manipulated to misdirect anyone unfamiliar with the place. If in a cave, go deep until you hit a naturally-generated crossroads and place torches going down one (wrong) tunnel whilst the real door is concealed in the ceiling further back. If in a forest, distract pursuers with clean-cut paths between the trees, intricate patterns of ground vegetation and multiple torch trails leading to dead ends; all to hide the hatch by a single, normal tree. If underwater, park boats along the wrong stretch of shoreline, place random lily pads and even plant Jack-o-lanterns on the seabed far away from the real entrance.  You can outsmart The Hand in this war, I believe in you!"

yogscastkim,2yxvka,RGPFerrous,2,Sat Mar 14 11:11:58 2015 UTC,"Kim and Duncan seem to have been pushed out from the start of this series (they were kept in the dark about the Mile High Club, for example), and I didn't really like how they seemed to get the blame for everything here (especially given Rythian was one of the people who stole the gold from the MHC in the first place). It seemed like people were being unnecessarily mean to them.  Cornerstone started out interesting but I think it's lost its way of late. If it's just going to end up being groups of people bickering and cliqueing and snitching on eachother then that's not so much fun for me to watch (the FB vs Hat Films thing in Flux Buddies was a much more entertaining cartoony rivalry, this just seems to me more like dysfunctional group dynamics)."
yogscastkim,2yxvka,evildrganymede,2,Sat Mar 14 03:04:33 2015 UTC,"I think that devolution had a lot to do with them no longer meeting after every week to tally up the results of that session and meeting next week to elect a mayor on camera.   Before, when they still that, issues such as the gold thievery from the MHC and where that gold came from or Strippin or Benji's lack of progress in railcraft could have been resolved much more quickly in a civilized manner. Now, the groups rarely meet on camera and have to resort to speculation regarding everyone else's motives. Lord of the Flies.  Plus, they're being watched by The Hand as opposed to Mother."
yogscastkim,2yxvka,Supertoastfairy,1 point,Sat Mar 14 10:56:09 2015 UTC,"Although Kim and Duncan have been put in the hot seat a lot lately everyone is getting framed/blamed for things. Team Farm (Sjin, Rythian, Hannah) are accusing the Rail Bros of stealing and being unfaithful even though they are really the only ones submitting to Hat Films.  Everyone started off getting along, but as the weeks have gone by so has that peace and now chaos is playing a big role and making things more interesting. Who can you really trust here? It seems like friends are becoming enemies and vice versa. I can understand that its hard to watch if you don't like the drama and politics, but there is still some hilarious chat going on in groups. Especially Team Farm with Hannah this week and her mispronunciations. Honestly I do partially agree with you that I liked it better when everyone was more friendly and joking around instead of all of the arguing and deception."
yogscastkim,2yxvka,virgash,1 point,Sat Mar 14 06:55:48 2015 UTC,"I guess Cornerstone is turning into what the main server would have been like if people were actually allowed to wreck eachother's stuff (as opposed to just doing it in scripted events). It's more ""PvP"" than ""PvE"", perhaps? I think it would have been better if it actually started out with each group considering the others as enemies rather than going with the pretence of working together.  Also, I'm a bit surprised that Kim puts up with the Hatters (mostly smiffy) calling her ""Quim"". It's not exactly a term of endearment - I pretty much cringe every time I hear it."
yogscastkim,2yxvka,evildrganymede,1 point,Sat Mar 14 07:26:40 2015 UTC,"Well they are still working together even if it doesn't seem like it, its just that everyone has side projects they work on as well. Also when the raid happened if you watch Hat Films POV they only take 6 gold bars and 8 iron bars and don't destroy anything. Plus they are all friends outside of recording, so if Kim wasn't okay with smiffy calling her that they would just talk about it and that would be the end of it."

yogscastkim,2yu96j,RGPFerrous,1 point,Fri Mar 13 09:06:02 2015 UTC,"Definitely like this idea. Having some sort of shared infrastructure like this would definitely make the server feel more communal; when everyone was on the Vanilla world and we actually had to build roads, supply depots etc. due to 0 technology being modded in I felt much more ""at home"" if that makes any sense. On modded all we had last time I logged in was a refuelling station, an armoury, some food supplies and ""The Zoo"". Which is nice when starting for the first time but also has no reason for anyone to return to once their own bases are set up.  Thaumic Mail is also far more immersive than constantly using slash commands. A small pet peeve of mine, but also the reason I stopped logging into the server once someone gifted me the PC version of Skyrim."

yogscastkim,2yte2a,AlloyMorph,3,Fri Mar 13 00:07:38 2015 UTC,"Alright, Kim.  I'm going to lay some really helpful pro Botania advice on you!   IMPORTANT the Wand of the Forest has 2 modes; Function Mode and Bind Mode  Switch between them by shift-right-clicking the ground (or air).  In Bind mode, shift-right-click a Mana Spreader, and then shift-right-click a Mana Pool; it will point the spreader at the pool.  This also works for determining which spreader a flower will send mana to. Change the mode of your Mana Pools by shift-right-clicking on them with your wand in Function mode. The range of mana spreaders is waaay larger than you seem to think it is.  If I remember correctly, the range is 16-ish blocks. Make a Mana Tablet.  It's very easy to make; just a Mana Pearl (or Mana Diamond) and some Living Stone.  It acts as a battery.  It absorbs mana from pools that are in ""spare mana to items"" mode, and discharges mana into pools that are in ""absorb mana from items"" mode, and it holds a lot of mana.  A lot of mana. Also make a Band of the Aura.  Wear it in one of the ring slots in the Baubles Tab of your inventory (click on the little silver ring by your character model in your inventory).  It passively generates mana while you have it on.  This mana will automatically be used to charge a Mana Tablet in your inventory.  It works faster when exposed to direct daylight."
yogscastkim,2yte2a,T_Weezy,1 point,Fri Mar 13 01:30:12 2015 UTC,"Kim! You have Living Wood in a chest at your Botania Hut, replace the dirt with that Living Wood.  Duncan, an idea for mining for resources is to make a mine shaft with a spiral walk way. Using cobblestone slabs would help best with that, seeing they will easily become abundant for you. Get some torches too, smelt wood logs into Charcoal in the steam powered furnace."
yogscastkim,2yte2a,ArtisticKamenRider,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:06:01 2015 UTC,The livingwood does not effect the efficiency of the Hydroangeas. It's merely decorative.

yogscastkim,2yte2a,ArtisticKamenRider,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:58:00 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason Hydroangeas are so hard to pronounce is the fact that the ""OA"" is pretty much the same as the ""A"" sound in Hydrangea (the plant it is based on). The easiest way I found to distinguish between the two is to pronounce it as if you have a stereotypical Japanese accent (Hai-doro-aynjah)"
yogscastkim,2yte2a,RGPFerrous,1 point,Fri Mar 13 09:31:58 2015 UTC,"Tip for WAILA (the box at the top that shows what you're looking at) also shows the tool you need to use to break a block and whether you can harvest it.

I hate hearing about racism and I too wish it would go away. I love all of the Yogscast videos and I will continue watching and supporting all of yalls videos.

Adding to your point about that no one is a ""pure blooded person""; A year ago I participated in the Genographic Project where scientists are attempting to map the human journey. Among the tests they do they determine from your genome which region of the world you are most similar to in terms of DNA. Judging from my result I am 48% Northern European, 34% Mediterranean and 18% Southwest Asian. That is fairly mixed, even though as far as I know my ancestors for the past few hundred years have been ""native"" Norwegians.  Also, Battle Royal is pretty damn great."

I like the idea of just leaving an enormous pile of the powder on top of the drink though :).   I like both the films. Part of the fun of the Cloud Atlas movie was trying to recognise some of the actors when they're playing different roles in each era (some are very well disguised).

I also have a mix of white and yellow in me, I was adopted from Hangzhou and raised by white parents in the US. I never really absorbed any Chinese culture because of that, and growing up in the Midwest made it easy to reject my non white background so I could fit in.   Hearing her talk about how much her culture enriched her life and how she embraces it despite having faced some huge moments of ignorance just inspires me and, I don't know. Just makes me happy to see that there's another person, a  successful person out there who gets what it's like being Chinese in a country without many other people who look like you.

When I heard you talk about racism, or bullying in general, I could relate to some parts. I was bullied too, not because of race but because 'the way I act' which I never really got to understand. But the kids aimed it at my weight (The easiest thing right?) and just like you I kind of couldn't care less about that now. Eventually you realise how stupid bullying and racism is and you might even start feeling sorry for some of those people, because that kind of stuff shows how narrow sighted some people really are.  You will start to grow some kind of shell, you'll be able to ignore or withstand the sad and worthless comments people make to try and 'get you', and I can see that that happened in the way you talk about it.  But after saying what you said, I'm very certain you will inspire a lot of people who are going through the same thing, because look at where you are now. It's amazing to hear you've gotten this far, and always still seem so cheerful, happy and funny even though you had the beginnings that you've had.

yogscastkim,2yjf22,Vamprat,1 point,Tue Mar 10 18:42:14 2015 UTC,That's just mean but I LOVE IT! What about a fancy sign that says Sjin was here with the rest of the gold blocks missing? The ideas are endless.  But then the challenge of sneaking the gold out is even more difficult since they have been hit by almost everyone in the Cornerstone area.

yogscastkim,2yh7iu,Vamprat,2,Mon Mar 9 20:25:29 2015 UTC,I think Kim's community gives her better minecraft advice than Duncan does.
yogscastkim,2yh7iu,K-guy,1 point,Tue Mar 10 03:48:04 2015 UTC,"Seeing this and the other Botania+AE2 guide from ImperiousGrapefruit I'm curious as to why my guide was categorised as ""suggestion"" instead of ""guide"" :S anyway.  I noticed two things you might want to check: 1) As far as I know magnum torches have a horizontal radius of 64 and a vertical of either 16 or 32. At least that's what various wikis state and I can't find changes from RWTema in his logs after he buffed it to 128 diameter in version 0.3 (1.6 prerelease 2). 2) Last time I checked (December or January I think) the Promised Land of BiomesOPlenty got removed in MC 1.7 versions. Varification in the changlelog, Build 1.7.2-2.0.0.718."
yogscastkim,2yh7iu,PintsizedPint,1 point,Wed Mar 11 13:12:17 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, I didn't want to be wrong so I said 32 blocks just in case, and it's better for the Promised Land to be removed, it's way too laggy."
yogscastkim,2yh7iu,PintsizedPint,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:06:05 2015 UTC,"Nobody wants to be wrong/inaccurate when giving advise ;) If you aren't sure about certain values etc and don't have time to either test it ingame or to google it than I would suggest just saying ""in an area"" without being specific. Btw I just noticed another more important thing: You could mention that the magnum torches prevent hostile, non-spawner, mobs from spawning regardless the light level. Duncan might remember this from tekkit (though it were magnum torches from a different mod I think) but Kim probably has no clue what a magnum torch is/does from only the name itself. Also I wouldn't call 5 diamonds, 2 potions and some wood and torches very expensive but that's subjective I guess."

Originally it went on the backburner for a while because we had more important things to manage, but with the addition of the mini-mod program it took overall pressure off us, meaning we could focus on side projects such as the Minecraft server, Teamspeak server and the Subreddit styling. /u/maximus_collius has been beavering away on getting the post flair working, so thank him!"

yogscastkim,2ycpwu,Zibi777,7,Sun Mar 8 18:13:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like Duncan rushes Kim too much through Thaumcraft, and that might be why she's enjoying it less. I mean, she does enjoy Witchery, which she did at her own pace and asked maybe Hannah or KirinDave if she was stuck and couldn't progress.  I've been doing Thaumcraft, and I don't find it too hard or boring. The only aspects that I've struggled with finding were Humanus and Sano. (The latter I desperately needed because there was a huge taint biome close to my base.) Maybe that's just me though.  I mean Duncan, bless him, but he's not the best teacher, I feel :p"
yogscastkim,2ycpwu,Aeverelle,5,Sun Mar 8 18:38:24 2015 UTC,"Humanus and Sano are two massive bottlenecks, even in modded minecraft, because the few things that give them are often gated by crafting or other research (Sano requires healing potions or cake, whilst Humanus is often in things that have other aspects such as instrumentum, telum, bestia or alienis.)"

A belt is great to have for thaumcraft as I can quickly switch to a more thaumcraft themed hotbar when doing thaumcraft stuff. Problem with the belt is it's a bit finicky, if I load the game it doesn't work and I have to go to the tinker's equipment tab and close out of the inventory, as well it doesn't work sometimes unless i'm holding shift while pressing the button."

I'm not sure if mana pools retain their contents when you break them or not, I'll have to test.  I'd get a mana tablet and store some of that sweet server-assisted mana, also could easily make full sets of manasteel armor and some rings that store the mana to constantly repair said manasteel armor.  But, the steam armor is probably the better choice."
yogscastkim,2y9kqg,Pktur3,2,Sun Mar 8 13:17:34 2015 UTC,"Mana pools do not retain their contents when broken IIRC, which is why Mana Tablets are great.  Manasteel isn't that much better than iron (besides enchantability and self repair), so the Steam Exosuit will rapidly outclass it. Elementium, on the other hand, once the elven portal is opened, is a great lategame armor and might be worth investing in."
yogscastkim,2y9kqg,RGPFerrous,1 point,Sun Mar 8 14:22:27 2015 UTC,"If you can, you guys should look into adding Iguana Tweaks for Tinkers. It's in a lot of questing mods, and adds the ability for your weapons and tools to level up through use, which adds modifiers. It'll let they Heavenly Sword get really strong.  Also look into making bows and arrows from Tinker's for when you get the rare skeletons showing up. The arrows made from Tinker's can be repaired so you don't have to worry about farming feathers and flint. You can use slime from the island right next you to make  some of the best parts of the bows and arrows.  Also the Exo-Suit has a helmet upgrade  for Botania that allows you to see mana like the Wand of The Forest would. Duncan had it shown last episode but didn't mention it."

yogscastkim,2y5lpi,Barnabus_Bot,4,Fri Mar 6 17:42:57 2015 UTC,"Okay! So! I don't know if this whole thing is pre-recorded, so I don't know if there's any point in me talking about this, but here's what I know about this game!  First off, and most importantly, only one of the animatronics in this game is real. Other than Springtrap, all the animatronics you see are either phantoms or hallucinations. The phantoms can't kill you, but they can knock out your systems and force you to reboot.  The phantoms don't physically move around; they kind of randomly appear in certain spots on the cameras, and then they jump to your room if you don't do the right thing. For example, Phantom Balloon Boy will randomly replace one of your camera views with his face-- when he does this, you have to switch to a different camera. If you put the monitor down without switching, he'll appear in your room and take out your ventilation system.  I'm not familiar with all of them, but from what I can tell, most of the phantoms seem to require you to look away from them in some way to avoid them appearing in your room."
yogscastkim,2y5lpi,thetacriterion,4,Fri Mar 6 18:52:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, handily, all this came out a day after we recorded - we played it straight away so there wasn't much info. Although to be honest, I find it annoying that I get more info from the FNAF Reddit users than from the actual game. I'm all for non hand holdy games, but you've gotta give something to the player!"
yogscastkim,2y5lpi,nanosounds,1 point,Sat Mar 7 15:11:51 2015 UTC,"I think the whole premise behind this series is that you don't know anything.  This is supposedly the final FNAF game, and if it's anything like the others it will leave you with more Q's than A's.  From watching other let's plays, the game always does this differently that people haven't experienced before, sometimes you'll get a creepy flash screen at random times in the intro that is rare.  Sometimes something will happen that is also rare in another part of the game.  It all keeps you wondering what is going on, and spurs public debate and causes cult following, it's the classic bait and pause.  As a side note, the phone guy in either nights one or two tells you that they received one of the animatronics.  I think that the dev tried to stuff too much lore into too little space with this one.  The first few nights gives you backstory on a whole new space, but you're so busy listening to phone guy's BS on the first night that you can't checkout the real estate.    But, all in all, it begs multiple play through at the expense of not gleaning much info from it.  This FNAF has to be the worst of all the others and was rushed.  Maybe Scott just wanted to be done with the series and was too much for them/he to take on.  EDIT: Tried to reword to not spoiler anyone. :p"

yogscastkim,2y5xf1,Zibi777,4,Fri Mar 6 20:29:48 2015 UTC,"I know I should just walk away, but we're doing this at Uni right now...  Although Latin is indeed not the foundation for German (and following that, neither is it the foundation for English), it is one of a huge list of European languages that stem from Proto-Indo-European. So, although German doesn't have anything to do with Latin directly, they do come from the same source. English does have quite a few words derived from Latin because of the roman occupation, but the reason for weird spellings is because the English orthography is terrible. Originally, words like 'knight' would have been pronounced 'kuh-nicht' (with the 'ch' like scottish 'loch'), but over time syllables were lost, yet the old spellings remained.  Also, what Kim is saying is true- learning a second language really makes it easier to understand other languages. People who only speak English don't have to think about things like case and certain tenses because English either doesn't have them, or doesn't mark for them, whereas other languages do. So in that sense, knowing Latin would indeed help with learning other languages.   (If I'm wrong about anything please tell me! Currently writing a report on the greatest influence on Old English aha)"
yogscastkim,2y5xf1,kirstyae,2,Sat Mar 7 11:25:05 2015 UTC,"As someone who's in her ninth year of having French class, the last minutes hurt me. Good god it's been a while since I've cringed (and laughed) so hard. And then Kim says ""Vous es(t) mort,"" while it should be ""Vous êtes mort.""  And yes, Latin is what most European languages are based on. Didn't learn Latin myself (though I had the option to do so when I was eleven), but I speak Dutch, English and French, and I feel like I can understand a couple of other languages just because they're so similar to ones I already know. It's useful to know more than one language, kids!"

My father is the opposite. He never played videogames until perhaps his thirties, at which point he was playing things like TIM and Zany Golf on the computer. He still can't handle first person games, but watching him try to do ANYTHING with twinsticks is horrible. He literally sits there, brow furrowed in concentration trying to get his brain to use one stick per motion axis. The Nintendo Wii has really been his gaming epiphany; When I showed him ""Look, just point at what you want and press A"", he could grasp it almost instantly.

yogscastkim,2xm5me,insanekingofdust,1 point,Mon Mar 2 00:20:13 2015 UTC,I was more excited when I thought the new film would remove the 3rd and 4th movies from canon.   But sadly no http://variety.com/2015/film/news/new-alien-wont-undo-alien-3′-or-resurrection-director-neill-blomkamp-says-1201443899/
yogscastkim,2xm5me,fekbenn,1 point,Mon Mar 2 00:27:36 2015 UTC,"The art design looks amazing.  That said though, I don't know if Blomkamp's going to focus too much on the action. What made Aliens good in my opinion was the fact that it was commentary on the Vietnam War. Blomkamp's sociopolitical commentary has been hit-and-miss for me - I thought District 9 did it really well, but I also thought Elysium's themes on poverty and power fell horribly flat.  Overall, it could turn out to be good. I'll decide if it's worth hyping once I see Chappie and make an opinion on that."

yogscastkim,2xm5me,ChristianPeps,1 point,Mon Mar 2 11:33:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know how I feel about it yet. Unlike some other movies that really didn't NEED a reboot or any new movies (Terminator, Judge Dredd, Total Recall, Mad Max... Back to the Future?), I think the Alien franchise could do with just one more release to fix the mistakes (READ: AvP and Prometheus) - I actually don't mind Alien 3.   Some of the concept art does look very nice indeed but that's all we know so far. Alien was always about the atmosphere... solitude, separation, desperation, feeling hunted and helpless in this dark, oppressive future. And of course, a great story that fits canon. Incredible cinematography is also key for me. The original films told so much of the story with nothing more than still-frames and visuals.   Until I have any idea of how well these things are going to be approached, I'm just going to wait and see.   Edit: Link - If Blomkamp is thinking about things in this manner, I'm a happymun."

yogscastkim,2xksxh,danthemango,1 point,Tue Mar 3 21:40:03 2015 UTC,Oh thank god Kim finally explains that their Mayullyn swords were glitched in last time. I was wondering for weeks how on earth they managed to get Manyullyn so quickly when it was incredibly hard for me to get it.
yogscastkim,2xksxh,KoLycaon,3,Mon Mar 2 14:05:06 2015 UTC,"The glitched in Manyullyn comes from their Galaticraft series and if you're interested in seeing when then this episode; Minecraft: Galaticraft - Pure Trees (#15) is the first time that it appears. They would use the glitched in metal for hammers, pickaxes, and swords."
yogscastkim,2xksxh,ShikadiLord,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:45:45 2015 UTC,"Instead of/in addition to Manyullyn you could use Vulcanite for at least some of your Tinker's gear. It's a natural ore found in the Nether's lower levels (you'll spot veins around the lava oceans), comes in large supply, and can be mined with Alumite tools. It's functionally equivalent to Manyullyn with slightly better durability and mining speed and sets mobs on fire; however, it has slightly worse attack damage (same as Alumite!) and is not purple.  The next thing would be Sanguinite, also found in the Nether but only on y 13-14 (yes). It's better than both Vulcanite and Manyullyn in all aspects and also inflicts the Wither effect to mobs. The downside is that obtaining it is relatively dangerous because you need to mine below the Nether sea level and risk encountering 1-block lava pockets, and it requires Manyullyn or Vulcanite tools. It's not purple either.  If your long-term goal is to get really OP weapons you could also look into Tartarite, an alloy of Adamantine and Atlarus, two rare ores from the Twilight Forest found at y 8-16 on this mod pack; they can only be mined with Manyullyn/Vulcanite or better tools, though. Once again, not purple."

Alumite also needs obsidian, but at the same time manyullyn uses two nether ores, and going to the nether requires obsidian. On a TiCo-related note, the traveler's gear and other equipment (backpack, glove etc) could be quite useful. Info about them and the modifiers you can apply to them is in one of the TiCo books (Materials and You 1, I think)."

Then designate a few 'crashsites' for different parts?  Work would advance best if someone could give a small example of the general idea of the spaceship in creative mode, like with the jungle temple, imho.  Extra parts could include an engine, wing or somthing. Don't require much of a template, just designated blocks to keep them in the same style as the spaceship.  Just thinking here, but a crash trajectory would be cool to build too. From 10 m + the width of the ship, starting a good way off, say 100 blocks.  Maybe half a house along the trajectory of the crash? A simple wooden cabin I mean, nothing too fancy to detract from the main crash site.   Add a few 'burning' food patches, Sjin style, and pen for good form.  If we have plenty of people we could even add a small 'station' for investigators of the crashsite. Just a 'tent' idea with some rudimentary beds and chests."

Take for example THIS BUILD that I participated in. Whilst I was not in the build team for this one (I did some landscaping for the arena), this is all done (albeit in creative) by hand, and results in a much more natural crater, as if the swordbreaker had actually carved into the ground itself.

yogscastkim,2x0o6z,mushroomproductions,3,Tue Feb 24 18:59:01 2015 UTC,"Gotta say, that system does seem rather counter-intuitive. I understand that the aim of the defenders is meant to be ""push them back without killing them"", but when your opponents have no disadvantage to dying there is literally no reason not to just zerg the point over and over.  In theory, gear should scale inversely with capture time decreases (so holding them back becomes more important than actually killing them), and attacker respawns scale proportionately with capture time (though that might be hard to do with command blocks). This way, the attackers will want to rush early to improve their gear without letting the defenders die (so their gear scales down), and then hold the point more carefully once their respawn times start scaling up.  This creates a more interesting defence scenario. The defenders will butcher the initial waves as they come, but will gradually be overwhelmed by the gear scaling and be whittled down. This in turn improves their gear, creating a more tense scenario where everyone is at a similar gear peak, with the attackers dipping in and out, dying tactically and the defenders hoping to grind out the last few minutes by injuring them enough to force them to retreat and heal/die one by one so that pressure is not lost."

yogscastkim,2x0a8y,nanosounds,3,Tue Feb 24 19:01:40 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, this is a terrible game to get into the series. It's more a side story, and has a different structure than the main series FFs. I'd say this is more similar to Fire Emblem Awakening or Valkyria Chronicles (in the sense that there's a hub where you manage your team, and more of a war sim). Also, the combat is more like Crisis Core or Kingdom Hearts, so not a great example of true Final Fantasy.   In all honesty, RGP's recommendation of FF3 is a good one, but I will always champion FF6 as the best, followed by 9, then 7."

yogscastkim,2wryj7,Torkmatic,3,Mon Feb 23 02:43:48 2015 UTC,"Oh dear.  I've always been a huge supporter of Kim's. I like her content, think she comes across as genuine and sincere and as basically an all round nice person. She's funny, enthusiastic and I've always been quite vocal in stating that she and Duncan are one of the best pairings by far in the Yogs.   Obviously, this is all leading up to a ""however"". So:  However, this episode was a bit tricky to get through. The whole ""why don't vegetarians just eat meat rather than stuff that is like meat?"" conversation was painful. Is it really that surprising that people that love animals don't like the idea of them being mistreated and slaughtered? Add to that the huge difference in environmental damage between cattle farming and growing some plants. And the statement that Quorn is ""full of chemicals"" is just nonsense. A few minutes looking at the ingredients shows this to be wrong, especially when compared to the hormones etc stuffed into animals to make them grow bigger, meatier and faster.   I'm not an extremist vegetarian. I would never dream of telling somebody else what they should or shouldn't eat. I have shared many tables with meat eaters and it never bothers me if the person I'm sat with is shoving bacon down their necks. My pets eat a meat based diet, because that's what they need to live.I'd never try and feed a cat a carrot. Just because I hate the idea of eating meat, doesn't mean I judge those that do. There are days that even I miss black pudding or a decent steak and kidney pudding. Damn it, I was born in London, the fact I can no longer eat pie and mash or the occasional cockle or whelk is a source of great sadness.  What a person eats is a personal choice.It's for this reason it's a little unpleasant to hear one of my favourite Yogs basically call me an idiot because I'd rather eat a mushroom based dinner than one that requires the killing of something that is capable of feelings. The question asked was ""what's the point?"". I can only speak for myself and say that the point for me has quite a bit to do with a school visit to a farm when I was a child. I went into the shed where the chickens were kept. After a few seconds I couldn't stand it any longer and had to be lead out. I was the only kid that had a funny turn, so maybe I am overly sensitive, but standing in the middle of what seemed like Schindler's List being re-enacted by poultry was something that stayed with me. That, to answer Kim's question (for me) is the point.  Sorry to go on, but it's a subject that matters to me and I don't like being belittled because of it. But anyway, if I can forgive Kim slagging off Doctor Who, I'm sure I'll forgive her this as well."
yogscastkim,2wryj7,droppedelbow,9,Mon Feb 23 02:14:56 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I'd like to say that I totally didn't mean for my rambling thread to come off as 'why don't veggies just eat meat' - I'd never be as insensitive and rude to think something like this, and I'd NEVER think that other people should 'give up' their lifestyle choices because I don't personally follow them! Oh God, it makes me feel really uncomfortable that people might think this is actually what I meant :/  What I was pondering was the processes that go into creating 'fake' meat like Quorn and other veggie substitutes. This is going to sound weird, but as someone who eats meat, I know where it comes from (and I only eat high welfare meat. I don't go anywhere near processed stuff like nuggets, dubious sausages and as you mention...the pink sludge), and well...what goes into it and how it's prepped. Er. But I've tried Quorn and other soya products (I've got some Quorn sausages and those Southern burger cutlets in my freezer now), but always pondered that big 'ole ingredients list on the back and how all of it's made? It just seems a bit processed for my liking to feel truly comfortable eating it (and that probably falls in line with my steering clear of processed meat products too). If I was to go full veggie, I'd probably stick to eating vegetables, pulses etc, and steer clear of 'fake meat' substitutes. That's really my thought process there, and totally wasn't my intention to offend veggies and say something like YOU'RE ALL DUMB FOR EATING FAKE MEAT DUMBOS.  Er, does that make sense? Sorry :( I think the problem is that I shouldn't go off on one when I'm trying to figure out how to Minecraft. I can't hold a very cohesive thread of thought. Sad now :("

yogscastkim,2wryj7,Mancombs,3,Mon Feb 23 10:44:43 2015 UTC,"Kim, to deal with your last point first, DON'T BE SAD! You and your colleagues have produced so much stuff that has given me smiles when I'd have thought such things impossible. My intention in posting this was not to make you less happy. My post was a long one and much of that was to try and find a balance between complaining about what was said while also making it clear that it's not something I'm going to be filing away in a box marked ""Kim is a poopy head"". Any post on this or any Yog subreddit is a tricky one as it is being written to be read by two audiences. You, if we're lucky, but also the other users here. The problem is that while my intention was a quick ""Oi Kim, love ya work, but watch what you say about vegetarians! :) "". I knew I had to build in some defence against the usual reddit army of people looking for a scrap. (Quick shout out to the mods here, this is by far one of the less toxic subs. Well done chaps).   I know you weren't saying vegetarians are wrong or dumb. I think it was just that you sailed very close to the ""why not eat meat if you're going to eat fake meat?"" argument which can be a frequent pain in the arse for some of us (as shown in one of the replies to my previous post). I know that the pressure to make entertaining, fresh conversation while also playing a game must be incredibly tricky, so obviously there will be times when things get a little wonky, subjects are discussed without full attention to what is being said and overly sensitive nutcutlet-nazis get their knickers in a twist. I was quick to complain and in doing so may have (despite my best efforts) been a little too short with you. (Not a dig at your height, honest. See? This stuff is a goddamn minefield!).  Don't let anything I said make you doubt how much I and others appreciate what you do. I was attempting to make my post a friendly rebuke with the emphasis VERY much on friendly. It's only when factoring in the difficulty of getting across tone in written communication plus the previously mentioned problem of trying to write to more than one type of reader that it becomes clear how that motive may have got lost within what I posted.  If you knew how much punching of the air was carried out when you mentioned my William Regal suggestion in one of your episodes, then you'd know I would hate to think I'd caused you to be less than cheerful. You and Duncan, as well as the many other Yogs are fantastic. I'm not here to slag any of you off. I have no beef with any of you (BOOM!).  Keep up the good work Kim, and please don't ever second guess what you're saying in an attempt to fend of moaning bastards like me. Be you, it's what you're good at."
yogscastkim,2wryj7,droppedelbow,5,Mon Feb 23 15:06:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think that was the point (and I don't think that's what Kim said either - she actually trailed off there rather than finish the sentence)  I think her point was ""why do vegetarians eat stuff that still looks like meat and is marketed that way (e.g. ""nut cutlets""). Which is also a question I have wondered about - I mean, if the point is not to eat meat anymore then why make stuff that still looks like it? Why make replacements for meat in the dish, rather than come up with something new?   I guess it's  probably for people who used to eat meat and who still want to imagine that they are (but again, if still you want or need your food to look like meat when you've made a conscious decision not to eat meat, then I'd imagine you're probably not really that serious about being a vegetarian)."

Wow. It's always tricky trying to find a polite way of telling someone they've said something incredibly dumb. I hope one day to master that ability.  If somebody eats food that looks like meat, they're not ""serious"" about being a vegetarian? It's not a martial art, there aren't black belts in being a veggie. You either eat meat and you aren't one, or you don't eat meat and you are. WTF does being ""serious"" about being vegetarian mean?  Food is consumed with most of the five main senses. How it looks, tastes, smells and what texture it has are all important to how much one enjoys the food. As such it can be enjoyable to eat something that tastes, looks and feels like meals one can no longer eat. Today, I ate a sausage sandwich. It looked, tasted and felt like any ordinary sausage sandwich, but it had no meat in it. How does that make me less of a vegetarian? Whatever the food looked like, the total number of pigs harmed in its manufacture was nil.   Regarding your question "" I mean, if the point is not to eat meat anymore then why make stuff that still looks like it?"" what part of that confuses you? For a start, many meat based dishes don't look like actual meat after the processes they've gone through. Where on a chicken is the ""nugget""? How many fingers does a fish actually have? How much of a sausage is prime cut meat and how much is eyeballs, bollocks, toenails and breadcrumbs? I'll not even go into the whole ""pink slime"" debacle. It seems you need to do a little bit more work on understanding how we eat and how food is prepared as well as what vegetarianism actually is.  For many vegetarians it's simply a matter of not wanting to eat the flesh of an animal that was raised in shitty conditions and then slaughtered. That's it. It's really simple. Whether we decide to sometimes eat food shaped like chicken or perhaps occasionally eat a pie containing meat-like gravy doesn't change how we feel about the needless death of countless animals. Jelly Babies aren't shaped like babies because that's what the people wish they were eating. It's all just part of the experience of enjoying food. And yes, I am aware that Jelly babies aren't suitable for vegetarians. And my god I miss them.  Sorry to anyone that thinks I'm beginning to sound like a militant veggie. That was never my intention."

This back and forth however teeters on the edge of people being very rude to each other, and I don't want that.

yogscastkim,2wse0t,Lansan1ty,3,Sun Feb 22 19:51:50 2015 UTC,Don't think so. Someone told me they take about 12 real life hours to grow without the Growth Accelerator :/

Growth accelerators do speed up the process significantly, decreasing it to a few minutes, but it is a little ridiculous.  I think the problem Duncan has is that he half grew about five seeds, then, without realising it has a different item ID once it's semi-grown, started growing a fresh bunch again."

Most professional YouTubers (including almost all of the Yogscast) were pursuing another career whilst doing YouTube on the side.  Knowing how to edit videos is important, but most editing programs are pretty intuitive and can be picked up quickly. The real hard part of being a successful YouTuber is not actually producing the content, but understanding social media, knowing how to game the algorithms behind it, jumping on what's popular, networking and collaboration, nurturing a community and making sure people keep coming back. It's hard, and the reason there are a million Minecraft-playing YouTubers out there with zero views is because they don't understand this. They think that if they just record themselves playing games people will show up and watch, when that's so wrong.  So if you can't see any career path in this world for you other than being a YouTuber, make choices that will allow you to study marketing and social media at A-level/university. But I don't recommend YouTube as an end goal - diversify yourself, get skilled at something else, and do YouTube in your free time because you enjoy it. That's the attitude you should take - don't do it for views, don't do it for money, just do it for fun."

For example, I've just finished my bachelor's degree in Information Technology which gave me experience in a lot of different disciplines, e.g. graphic design, animation, web design, game design, video editing etc. So Information Technology is something you might want to consider. Also, Multimedia Technology, Film/Video Production, Sound Engineering, Animation, and Game Design are courses you might want to look into. So it may be useful to check the entry qualifications for these types of courses.   I would also take a look at the Yog-Jobs page to see what type of skills they're looking for.

The consensus is they got super lucky and were able to build up a respectable base when there were only really a couple dozen people doing ""Let's Plays"" (or when the only gaming content was WoW and then branched out from there)  If you want to actually get into it now, you probably want to do Twitch instead of Youtube. It's unlikely many people will stumble across your videos on Youtube now with all the competition, but sorting by game on Twitch allows even small streamers to be seen.  You pretty much have to stream every day, stream one main game (super meatboy or binding of isaac are good choices), and then piggyback on popular streamers. When a big stream ends for an uncommonly played game (or new game), you want to be on the same game so that those people might check out your channel.

Given that twitch deletes VOD's a YouTube mirror is a must IMO and that 2 hour session of Game X can be neatly cut into bite sized chunks for daily release for those that don't want to watch 2+ hours of recorded game play in one session, some sites work well with viewership of hour long game play others not so much, I was hooked on both Jesse Cox and TotalBiscuits Hunnie Pop videos even though the game was a tad awful, I was there mostly for their commentaries (and TB had his wife), but Jesse's latest fan Fr-aturday was over an hour long and I gave up ten minutes in, it was the length of a movie and I could be watching one instead.  They did say that time slots were an issue for exposure and that you were seeing many (as you yourself said) doing the stream just after someone finishes to try and piggy back their audience trick.  This is not a guarantee of success, but it's not something to discount either, you might play binding of Isaac right after someone closes their stream and get a low turn out of people wanting binding of Isaac as it might be they tuned in for him or her and the game was background (as is the case with many YouTuber's).  The numbers dropped considerably after Cox and Crendor's Pax panel, the next stream was the Penny Arcade creators, they cut the end of CnC short (it was the last few questions and they knew they were over running) to stream another room as it started, I was one of the people turning off at that point, the only reason I went to PAX twitch was for the panel, I am guessing many more had the same idea.  Over all I don't know what the viewer retention was for that days stream, I am guessing their podcast was a spike and the rest averaged out as it played in the background.  So streaming Game A right after someone else finishes their session of the same game isn't a guarantee of anything, but it's still something to try.  It all boils down to are they tuning in for the game or the streamer?  Someone somewhere can make spectating Tetris fun, but that doesn't mean it's now a spectator sport.  Twitch plays Pokémon was something first time round, it had numerous copy cats, now they are back again but have only a percentage of the viewers, a fan interactive playthrough would probably fare better now, instead of parsing chat spam and queueing them as directions or button mashes the streamer just says ""which starter should I go for?"" and picks what seems to be the majority choice and works from there, not having the audience choose each and every move, just ""which one should I attack with?"" even though there is only one in the pack that would stand a chance, they could go ""I know the others would fail so I am going to use the only correct choice."" but it's more fun letting the audience intentionally fuck up due to bad choices and mob rule."

Hannah especially as she could have chosen to just have content creators in her advent but instead brought on staff that might never have been seen before (one guy I saw days prior during the Karaoke live stream, but other than that it was a ""Who's he?"" moment)."
yogscastkim,2wqznb,YCMeg,1 point,Sun Feb 22 19:13:09 2015 UTC,Media Studies is a good course to do. I'm currently doing my AS Level in it and it requires learning how to edit clips and sound. It might be useful. Hope this helps and good luck! :)     -YCMeg :P

yogscastkim,2wo7hg,RGPFerrous,2,Sat Feb 21 18:02:43 2015 UTC,I have spent 4 years volunteering in community management positions getting up my experience and making my name for the company that i work for now. It was my already present work portfolio which got me my current job at Gameforge. Next up i want to start working on Game Development and Video content making. I will learn and focus on them whenever i can. so i can get the job i always wanted :)  thats how this industry works. and its good in that regards :)
yogscastkim,2wo7hg,merTYol,2,Sat Feb 21 18:24:15 2015 UTC,Uni can be the best time of your life if you want it to! Just go to every lecture and enjoy the social side of it too!
yogscastkim,2wo7hg,Dunkleberry,3,Sat Feb 21 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more when Kim was talking about the creative industry. ""How did you discover your talent in art?"" and ""Were you born with the gift to do art?"" Especially since I'm quite young still, people tend to ask me these questions more than you'd think. Gets worse when I tell them I haven't been to any sort of art school - I'm an IT student.  Art isn't so much a talent, as it is a skill you grow and cultivate over time. I picked up a pencil when I was five simply because my older brother liked drawing and my mom was proud of him. Yes, sibling rivalry is what made me draw. Annoyingly, people tell me to stop being 'modest' when I tell them I don't consider my art skills a gift or talent.  Anyhoo, before I go on a massive rant about art... Can anyone tell me who drew the thumbnail art? I feel like I definitely should be able to recognise the artist, but it's not happening at the moment :/"

yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Ctrl_Shift_Incognito,7,Sat Feb 21 18:05:17 2015 UTC,"1) If it's something like Flux Buddies, I usually find out from twitter, but any videos like your Chinese New Year Special I find out about on the main reddit page.  2) I love the endslates (mainly because of the songs) and it's much nicer than the video just ending. However, I rarely click on the links.  3) Previous and next episode annotations at the start and end of the video would be nice, as sometimes YouTube is a derp and won't recommend the next episode, so I have to search for it instead.  4) I'm loving the minecraft, Nano's Village is amazing and one of my favourite series you do, next to Fu- I mean Flux Buddies. Some more stuff with the Hats (minecarft or otherwise) would be very nice, or at least with Trott if they're a bit busy with trailer/other work.  5) I don't really look at the channel itself, but I think the 'current series', 'iconic series' etc. would be a good idea!  Other feedback- I absolutely love your IRL stuff, and your 500k special was probably my favourite video of yours. Also, your vlogs after your Japan trip really inspired me to learn more about Japanese culture, and I want to go to Osaka because DEER :3 I think you should maybe play more games which are set in a place or at a certain time period that really interests you- I love to hear you talk about these things, like in your Chinese New Year video, or the Cornerstone episode when you spoke about sound engineering.  Anyway, that's a 15 year old girl from the Midland's opinion. Do what makes you happy, Kim. x :3"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,swishnflicks,3,Thu Feb 19 16:41:19 2015 UTC,"I tend to find your videos through Twitter. A lot of people use Twitter as a way to get their 'social media fix', and a relative amount also have programs that update in real-time like TweetDeck which helps them see tweets like new videos or updates. Myself and a few other people don't really tend to view our Subscriptions on YouTube, partly because they're wrong half the time and partly because it's just difficult to look through. I know that if I think ""Hey, let's see what Kim has uploaded"", I'd either check your Twitter or go direct to your channel. It's the same like that for me with any YouTube channel, honestly.  The end slates are useful, yes. If I'm watching a playlist or something on my TV using Chromecast, then I'd tend to skip to the next video as the end slate is running. For new viewers of your channel I think yeah, the end slates are a nice and welcome addition and helps a lot. It'll be the same for any channel. If fans want to watch your videos, they'll usually actively scout out your videos or seek a playlist rather than click annotations or links in descriptions. For regular viewers, I don't really think we tend to check video descriptions that often - especially when watching a series or a playlist. Also, descriptions aren't available on new mediums that people are using to watch YouTube, including Chromecast, Smart TV, Xbox, Playstation (that goes for annotations too).   I think with long play series, it would be much preferred to have them in a playlist. That way, you can sit down at a time that's suitable for you and have a marathon of watching the series (like I recently had for Martyn's The Escapists videos). Links to previous videos are useful to be included somewhere, but I feel like if you made the videos part of an official series playlist, it would be easy to navigate to the previous (or first/last) episode.  In terms of content, I would love to see you playing more horror and the things that you enjoy. It feels as though you're playing Minecraft because you're part of a network/group of people that play it sometimes too. I think that it'd be more beneficial to you to create the content that you want to make, whether that's Minecraft or non-Minecraft. Minecraft is starting to die down now in terms of hype and people watching it, and there's only so much saturation you can put into one game before people get bored of it.  Finally, navigation. Personally, I think your current layout is good on your channel. I'd love for there to be a quicker way to view the series you've got currently going on though, as previous/finished series tend to be near the top of the page. I don't really think the homepage matters that much, because the majority of us will either click the 'Videos' or the 'Playlists' tab, rather than trying to find a video from your channel homepage.  I hope this feedback has been helpful to you, keep up the amazing work, Kim!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,jaydenbadboii,2,Thu Feb 19 16:42:41 2015 UTC,"I generally find your videos through the subscription box.(when it's working) Endslates are fantastic for going through stuff if I didn't watch it when it was coming out, like through playlists. Just try and keep them updated. Annotations are generally what I use. Honestly my favorite Yogscast content for like 6 months now has been collab stuff, I don't even care about what they're actually doing in the video. The iconic series thing is pretty cool and I loved seeing it on the other Yog pages before YT shuffled the layouts around all over the place."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Ezreal024,6,Thu Feb 19 16:38:16 2015 UTC,"I agree, collab videos are my favorite too.. I miss Nano's Village and hope to see it return soon <3 :)"

yogscastkim,2wfxrl,bythefrontdoor,2,Sun Feb 22 10:53:46 2015 UTC,"Sub boxes! I like the music, but quite honestly, I don't see much point to them. I tend not to pay much attention to YouTube suggestions in general, so I wouldn't read too much into this. I wait for it to pop up in my sub box and I tend to watch videos as they go 'live' rather than catch up on multiple episodes at once. I find the most compelling content to be the 'live' stuff where you're in person, playing a short game. Like the recent Trivial Pursuit, or Mario Kart. I don't tend to look at the channel page. So, not applicable to me."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,JordanKZ,2,Thu Feb 19 16:38:30 2015 UTC,"1) Through YouTube subscription, sometimes through your or the Yogscast Twitter feed  2) I like them, gives the videos a professional touch. Sometimes I click through for different vids or past ones  3) I look for links in the description, and on endslates if they are present. I actually have annotations set to off in my settings due to some vids (not in the Yogs family) being so full of often pointless and unwanted annotations (links to unrelated vids, adverts etc) so you can't rely on annotations to promote or link to other content.  4) Balance is good, but perhaps lean towards non-Minecraft vids. You never know when, and it is a when, the Minecraft bubble will burst so to speak. I'd like to see more of you doing colabs with other people such as the Village series, Mario Kart, Trivial Pursuit (that is ongoing I know). Don't get me wrong I enjoy Flux Buddies and Fright Night but seeing different dynamics with other Yogs is fun to watch.  5) I rarely go onto your main page, just the vids and click through links via description, related vids etc. Going with the idea of a mix of Current & Classic playlists sounds like a good idea to give new viewers a taste of what your content is like and give existing subscribers a mix to choose from. Hat Films layout is certainly a nice style to base your own layout on."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,daxg2001,2,Thu Feb 19 16:43:34 2015 UTC,"1) Mainly Twitter because Youtube and the sub boxes issues  2) I think they're useful because there are past series that I didn't watch at the time  3) I, personally , click on the endslate box for next episodes but a previous episode annotation could be useful.  4) From your channel what I look for is the horror stuff (Fright Night and similar). Minecraft Don't love it but don't hate it either  Flux Buddies and the other series I don't remember the name right now are pretty funny. I think you're now in a great balance  5) Probably an Iconic series will be great to remind people that there's stuff they would like  Other feedback : I watch it every single day, I try to comment in every single video but there are days that just have nothing to say about and of course I can't forget about the blue hand ;)  To end this loooong post I will say I love your videos and keep on keepin' on"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,TitoRag,2,Thu Feb 19 16:44:15 2015 UTC,"I find your vids via the YouTube sub page. Doesn't always work so I just pop on twitter to check. Since I mainly browse on mobile, I can't click annotations. Heck, I usually let Flux buddies run on my mobile while I do dungeon runs on ffxiv.   I like long term videos but I rarely click the annotations. Since I watch the Co-Optional podcast and they have that pesky annotations on all the time, I have it disabled. I tend to go via playlists on your channel to watch in a series.  Not a BIG fan of minecraft. The main channel has loads to spare though then again, the Lewis+Simon combo feels different to Flux buddies. I am a bit sick of the blocky world so I guess the combination of Flux Buddies and cornerstone is enough for me. Throwing in the occasional good adventure map wouldn't hurt. I WOULD like a return to FFXIV to see what they have added but if the views aren't enough, I don't see the point in making a video.  I don't really mind the main page since I usually go YouTube Sub page > Kim's page > Check for channel art > Vid list in case sub page stops working but I suggest arranging the list based off popularity of the vids."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Keneshiro,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:49:56 2015 UTC,I stay around YouTube mostly and it sucks that some of your other videos not relating to games like your Chinese new year video or your vlogs do not notify me when they come out. It's nice to get a different cultural perspective on stuff and I wish that the site was a better tool for all the videos instead of only partially reliable.   Also... I do not reddit much so call me a noob when it comes to posting and following on this site.
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Stnklein,1 point,Tue Mar 10 18:07:35 2015 UTC,You may want to make sure you're subbed to the channel and not just following a playlist!
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,RGPFerrous,1 point,Tue Mar 10 18:23:36 2015 UTC,"4) CONTENT: Kim, I love the way you negotiate your indie games. You always choose the best looking and richest titles, and involve yourself as a character as much as any other in the plotline. Your Life Is Strange play through was just a treat. Please consider doing more of this in the future. A more specific suggestion: look into Ori and the Blind Forest, I'm sure you will love the graphics and the story."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,hemu1,1 point,Tue Mar 10 19:45:01 2015 UTC,"1)I find your videos by searching them out on your channel (or sometimes dunc's)  2) wut?  3)I watch playlists. Over and over again. It's a thing.  4) Am biased but always craft the mines. I enjoy some of the indie games, but am not a particular horror fan.  5) Maybe I'm just a bit too pro but I have no issues with your layout. I never have trouble with anyone's."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,jdgoerzen,1 point,Wed Mar 11 10:25:04 2015 UTC,The endplate is always a teaser to the next ep. which i like and i think you should have two channels 1)The main one where you just put minecraft and vlogs and 2)For different games like alein iosolation.i think daily vids would be great.Thanks for reading(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,BMO134,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:35:18 2015 UTC,1) Either twitter or sub box :) 2) I think that the endslates could be/are  quite useful for people and i think that they are a good idea to have for youtubers personally. 3) I feel that previous eps would be useful for most people who have missed some (especially if they are multi channel series like flux buddies) and i would put it on the end slate or vid description (Love flux buds btw) 4) I feel the balance between games is pretty good - however as flux buddies is starting up again idk what direction it would take so maybe more minecraft.... but most other yogs members have lots of minecraft content so i dont know how the majority of fans would react. (All Lewis and Simon do is minecraft..... not that there is anything wrong with that... because its awesome.... but just as an example)  5) personally i love the Hat films layout as well so IMO it would be pretty cool if yours was more like theirs :) Hoped this helped some-what Kim - just wanted to say that you are an awesome person and to keep up the amazing work :D Love you loads <3
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,smklL,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:43:58 2015 UTC,"I find new videos though Twitter and Sub-boxes. I think they are useful. Yes I see them and I will click them. If a series has been going for a while (e.g. Flux Buddies) I would like a link to Ep 1 so if I am watching it late, I can catch up with the action. I normally wait for the Endslate, but also look in the Sub-box or playlist. Minecraft is always good, but I love the fright nights as well. Hat Films layout is a really good one actually, so maybe something similar is a way to look at going..."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Goffik_Gaming,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:45:07 2015 UTC,"Hey Kim!  Great to see you here now and again!  Now, to your questions:  1) YouTube subs box, or occasionally Yogscast Twitter if the subs box is slow to update.  2) Pretty much always skip past end slates - if I'm mid-series, then I click on to the next video via the sidebar.  It's nice to have the episode previews on the newest episode of something e.g. Flux Buddies, but it's probably affecting your viewer retention figures.  3)  Links in the description are what I prefer, especially if I'm on my tablet, though YouTube is usually pretty good at putting relevant videos near the top of the side bar.  4)  Flux Buddies and Nano's Village are my favourites, but more because of the interaction you have with people rather than because it's Minecraft (though it's nice to be watching a game I know).  I tend not to watch the horror/survival series because it's just not the kind of game I enjoy, but obviously many other people do.  I guess there are some people not watching Trivial Pursuit because they don't like the game, but personally I'm loving it.  5)  Honestly, I very rarely go to YouTube channel pages - I usually rely on the subs box/Reddit/Twitter - so I don't really feel qualified to comment on its layout/organisation.  Other comments - keep doing what you're doing kiddo!  Quality recently has been consistently high, and it seems like you're enjoying what you're doing.  I'd request some kind of collaboration with Lewis and/or Sips, but obviously you're all very busy people.  Maybe hijack a GTA V session with Duncan, Sjin and Sips..?"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,igsey,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:45:11 2015 UTC,"I always know of a new video when the notification arrives in my email inbox Personally, I never use the endslates for anything - unless there's an annotation link to a video I plan on/want to watch, in which case I click said annotation. Hence I always check what is on the 'slate before navigating away I never use annotations for the next episode... primarily because I usually watch new videos as soon as they are published :) Previous ep links are also never used by me as I would then use the skip back function of the playlist view. Any other links I specifically look for, I delve into the description. At the moment, the content balance is perfect for me :) I've watched almost every single episode of FB 1.0, and I don't see myself not doing the same with 2.0 anytime soon :) Plus, the amount of episodes is sort of counterbalanced by half of them being on Duncan's channel There is a lot on your channel homepage, yes - too much however? I think that can be subjective, probably as I never scroll down anyway. This is because if I want to watch one of your videos and navigate to your channel to do so, I almost always use the search field to the right of the About tab. Only times I ever use the channel home is if I navigate to it and see the video I want to watch at/near the top - I say near as I can see the Recent Activity and part of the Fright Night lists on my 1080p screen. About Hat Films' layout - certainly looks like an interesting option - but it won't matter to me much if you do change your own channel layout.   One thing that I'm not entirely a fan of is the popup encouraging to like the video that appears about halfway through - however I've seen the change in the search system, so I understand fully why it's there, and I try to ignore it. One suggestion: perhaps also put it on the endslate if it isn't already there? That way people like me who do check said 'slate may remember more often to like the video :)  If I think of any more feedback, I'll add it.  P.S. You're the best, Kim. Really. <3"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Darxicus,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:45:41 2015 UTC,"1) Subscribed and luckily I get your videos pushed right to me (ya' know with the dodgy way Youtube manages subscriptions). 2) I like a good Endslate. It gives me time to choose what I watch next rather than allowing the new ""auto-playlist"" feature to redirect me around the place. 3) For your long series I like to wait for a few episodes to be released so I have a bulk of stuff to binge on so links to previous vids are great (I can pick up from say ep 5 and trail my way back) I guess playlists would function in the same way. 4) As for content I want to see YOU be in charge a bit more. I think you should perhaps take some of the other Yogs under your wing and teach them the ways of the RPG etc. Minecraft is starting to appeal less to me but I feel that is because with all the current series they have followed the same ""plot"" for the first few eps. (Everyone's been making a smeltery or a crucible and has to follow the same path). ALSO I loved your Valentine's and Chinese New Year vids - Casual gaming really suits you, it gives you space to chat and the videos feel more relaxed.  5) I don't visit your page really (soz babes like totes soz) but if you like the Hat Films format then go for it cue 80s montage music.  Any other feedback: Ummm I think whatever you do I will love. Seriously you have risen up the Yog-Of-The-Pops chart to become one of my fave Youtubers."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,jvallis,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:46:16 2015 UTC,"Hi Kim! Hopefully you'll see these answers!     1) I like the idea of daily videos as it means that we can pick and choose what content we watch and still have enough until the next day. Please keep using twitter as I really enjoy reading your tweets about upcoming videos, general updates and information on the subreddit (I saw this post after reading your tweet about it, so keep it up!)     2) I like the end slates for the previews of the next episodes, but personally I don't use the links that much as I use the subscription dashboard on youtube for what I watch. I am sure other people do use them though?     3) Like I said above, I don't really use annotations for next episodes, but previous episode links can be super helpful as it saves trawling through subscriptions to find them!     4) I personally like the balance of videos at the moment - there is enough of minecraft to keep me watching the long plays and the other videos give completely different game genres that I can watch. I think I speak for the entire sub when I say that more vlogs would be good, purely because we like listening to general updates and information about games and what you're up to, but if they're too much hassle to put together at short notice then we're fine with waiting for them :)     5) I think that the page is a little busy but not too bad at all - The Yogskim specials, kimpressions and random videos could probably be condensed into one playlist (bigger random playlist of all three) as that would save lots of room. Kim and the gang play could probably be got rid of, as if I wanted to find those videos (which I do!) I could find them without the playlist. Overall I like that there are playlists though, as they save a lot of time finding certainn videos.     Hopefully I don't sound too negative! I really do like the content that you put on your channel and I genuinely look forward to the content each day, but I think that the above suggestions could really help with the overall channel feel :) But please keep up the good work, and thank you for the excellent community interaction that you have!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Dunkleberry,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:47:13 2015 UTC,"1) every day I check on youtube for new videos. Twitter notifications are also useful. 2) I usually watch videos on my phone, so I dont click on them. But for betweeeason I just like them being there. It just feels right 3) I usually watch a new video the day it comes out, so im always on top of every series. Link for next and previous episodes would be useful in case im behind. Always excited for new episodes 4) I love watching your minecraft videos. I started getting really worried after the war in flux buddies, but was so glad when the new series started. I think the balance between minecraft and other games is great. Keep up the good work :) 5) I do like the layout of your channel, but yeah. Maybe cut it down a bit so there's less going on. Current series and iconic series would be great.  I love your content. Your audience interaction is great. I love watching your play throughs and vlogs"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,DucksAndDinosaurs,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:49:21 2015 UTC,"Hey Kim, let's get straight to it:   I'm realy enjoying the daily videos! I'm not subscribed for no reason, it's because I enjoy your content. Seeing that content daily makes it that much more fun! How I consume YT-content (mostly from bed, with my pc and controls of it at the other end of my room) means I use the endslates to walk over to my pc and switch to another video. I mostly hear the music, but rarely see them. Therefore I almost never click on them, unless I know they will show me a direct link to the next part in the series, if that is out already. Love the long-play series! I would very much enjoy you doing more of them, solo as well! I know Hannah does most of the AAA-games, but things like Alien Isolation and more recently your playthrough of Never Alone with Nathan were a lot of fun. The choice in games would seem most important in this: stick to something YOU will enjoy, and you'll bring that enjoyment to your fans (the main reason I watch YT content is enjoyment of personalities, not the video itself per se). As for annotations and the like; again, endslates don't bother me, but with for instance Flux Buddies, I 'binge' it. When you upload the next part, I use the link in the description to see the video on Duncan's channel. Playlists you seem pretty on top of, never had a complaint. Although I personally am a bit burnt-out on Minecraft, I do enjoy your content on it (again, because of the story/personalities involved). I would love some other games to be played, and more recently I've been realy enjoying your content about Chinese and Malaysian culture (seriously, maybe a series about that? Please? :) ). You're very good at explaining things in plain, simple language, especially if you're enthousiastic about the subject!  Basically, I would love it if you'd play a bit more non-Minecraft games. I rarely go to the main page of ANY YT'er, so I never realy see the layout of these pages. The YT subscription page makes sure I don't have to. Looking at it now, maybe it's not a bad idea to have a 'current series' sort of thing, it might entice people to check out what you've been up to, and for people who only sometimes check YT, it might make it easier to catch up!   Anyway, hope this helps. I like how much feedback you ask of us, it realy shows you care a lot about your fans and community! Keep it up, and Gong Xi Fa Cai!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,dragua16,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:49:21 2015 UTC,"1) subs & twitter 2) I do see them, but rarely click them 3) Links to the next/previous ep. are always useful, if there not in the video i look for them in the description 4) Minecraft is ok, but would like to see more other games 5) I dont really go there, because im up to date on Your videos :)"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,keiichipl,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:52:21 2015 UTC,"1) I most generally find videos through twitter, although I sometimes find them just by scrolling through the various yog channels and seeing a new upload. The one I don't find it the most is by my sub box, but I don't really use it often, as in my opinon it's pretty broken. So yeah. 2) I usually find the endslates quite useful, and will click on them more frequently than not. 3) I generally don't click on annotations for the next ep as when I'm there, the next ep hasn't usually been released. (I'm usually pretty early thanks to twitter). If I know that the next video in the series has been released I will click on the annotation on PC, and will look for links in the vid desc if i'm on phone, iPad, e.c.t. I don't really use the playlists as the link, unless it's a series that's been completed and i'm starting it. Even then, I am more likely to use the desc, annotation, endslates and even the 'next in this series' thing when on PC. 4) Minecraft - love it. Can NEVER get enough of it. I will often go back and re-watch series like the apprentice, galacticraft, e.c.t. But maybe that's just me. The balance between other series and minecraft is pretty good in my opinion, though maybe just a bit more of other games would be nice. 5) I quite like the layout of playlists myself. Though, as you said, something like 'currents series' would be good. You wouldn't really need the 'iconic' series thing, because iconic is different depending on a person. And the the fact that you have it sorted into things like 'fright night' and 'minecraft' is good so you can pick out your style and not be just watching things at random.  Finally, I think your channel could use a few tweaks here and there, but overall your channel is practically perfect. Love your content, Kim, and keep up the good work! ~Jess <3"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Jess-Dream,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:52:56 2015 UTC,"1) idle browsing if that's what I'm doing at the time, if I'm not browsing currently then Twitter.   2) I personally don't, but then I don't really for any channel. Towards the end of any YouTube video I'll be browsing my subbox in another tab, just listening to the audio of the YT video.   3) no problems here as far as I can tell. I never really binge watch them but when I do I use the annotation/description, no real reason for using one or the other. Other than that, previous ep links are nice but not essential, one thing I would say about flux buddies/anything split across two channels is I'd like something to distinguish that it's your channel and not Duncan's, preferably at the beginning of the video just to add some distinction.   4) I like Minecraft but I'd say limit it to around 2 series at a time unless a) the other series is very different like the Dropper was or b) there is a variety of other content on the channel at the time. At the moment the channel seems nice in terms of balance, maybe some more single player playthroughs of longer non-episodic games would be cool.  5)Honestly? I don't use the main page although in reality I never do for any channel, that's probably just me.  Other than that, I think I've included other feedback within the answers to the 5 questions. Also, even if I've included critical feedback, don't get me wrong - loving the channel at the moment!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,NetherCreeper1,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:53:52 2015 UTC,"I'm probably a terrible example considering my position, but I'll contribute anyway;  1) I usually lurk the Subreddit until the latest video shows up, or it pops up on my Twitter.  2) The endslates are great. Most of the time I don't click things (usually because I've seen pretty much everything featured on it already) but occasionally I find something I haven't noticed yet, so I'll click it.  3) Again, I'm usually up to date on everything unless I'm bulk catching-up when I've been away, so I use the episode buttons occasionally. An endslate button that takes you to the video playlist might serve more use than a ""Previous"" button.  4) I'll watch just about anything you put out, but I do enjoy the balance of how things are at the moment.  5) Your channel page is a little cluttered. If I were landing on the page for the first time, I wouldn't know where to start. A ""Current Series"" or ""Popular Series"" section might be good, Hat Film's page is a good example. (Wait, Hat Films a good example? What is the world coming to?)  I love interacting with your content here on reddit, as long as the discussion here flows I don't you can do much wrong!"

yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Monkeytec,0,Thu Feb 19 16:35:11 2015 UTC,"In regards to both 2 and 3: the end slates are alright, but I often find myself checking the description in a long play series to find links to the previous and next episode anyway, and especially if I think a new episode may be out but I'm not sure. On that note, sometimes the end slate and/or description don't actually get an updated link until days after the next video is actually released. All in all I'd say navigating through your videos from just the videos is perfectly convenient. In regards to 1, I find most of your new videos from my my subscriptions page, but when I get behind on new videos I usually find them through the descriptions or endslates of previous videos."

I see them but hardly ever click them, mostly cause I have seen it before, because I am already a sub of yours or sub of wherever the next ep will be. Loving the long plays and especially things like Flux Buddies where you create the story instead of set story like Alien. I hardly click on annotations for the next ep due to point 2. A previous ep at the start would be nice. Loving your content but missing news and bloopers, even if they are irregular they were fun because it was your original content (like FB story that you Duncan and the HatFilms guys had going on). You are a good content creator and deliver news and stories very well please release your creativity some more like that. Your layout is indeed a bit cluttered but you do so much, Hat Films would be an option for 2015   Other than the 5 points above, thank you for the content please create more of your own original things even if it is in other games. Your storytelling of your own life and experiences during games is enjoyable as well, Valiant Hearts brought up so many emotions due to your stories and how relatable of it was for me as a warchild.  Thank you and best of luck this year, Drazen"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,DrazX,0,Thu Feb 19 16:38:40 2015 UTC,"Hello  1) Mostly in my subscription notices on youtube and sometimes about Twitter 2) I use the endslate to get to the next video if I watch an older series for example 3) The previous ep links as annotations arent very necessary imo, but the ones for the next episodes are. For links I look in the description. 4) I like the minecraft series and the balance between Minecraft and other stuff is fine. Personally I like solo lets plays with you the most, like The Last of Us.  5) I personally don't use the Youtube mainpage from a Youtuber at all, I switch directly to the video section.  Have a nice day"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Behlial1992,0,Thu Feb 19 16:39:14 2015 UTC,"1) Loving the new videos. They help give you space away from the rest of the group, in turn allowing your own style taste and personality to shine.  2) End slates are always useful. They have linked me to things I have missed in the past :)  3) If I have missed several episodes I will click on annotations. Usually I look for links in the annotations or playlists.  4) I think you have great balance between Minecraft and other games. My thought on games, if you think it'll be fun and interesting to you, play it! The more you enjoy a game, the more I enjoy watching :)  5) Having a couple current series lists would be good. Maybe a Most Popular videos.  All in all, I think you are doing an awesome job. Just keep having fun and remember, try not to stress too much. Some things won't get the best view count but people will always come back to watch you have fun!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,RexgarsWife,0,Thu Feb 19 16:54:23 2015 UTC,"I visit your channel every few days/when I think of it for a nice surprise. If you tweet something I'm interested in I'll view it throughout that linkage.  Your endplate music is the bomb. I don't tend to click on them as I just use the Youtube sidebar.  Haven't watched Flux Buddies, never got into your mine craft content. Alien I look to the side bar on the right for next episodes or sometimes the playlist. I don't use playlists on auto play as I fall asleep to youtube and then I don't know where to pick up from.  More fright night yo, collaborations with Hannah always go down well for me. Indie games are also a winner. I enjoyed your play through of Life Is Strange.  I only really look at the current video/new upload page or whatever you call it.    Other feedback: In general I love your stuff. You're a great member of the Yogscast and a really interesting person to listen to. Keep doing what you're doing. I really enjoyed your parallel play through of Life Is Strange against Hannah's, so more of stuff like that would be cool. I usually click on stuff you link on twitter.   I present to you my thumbs in an 'up' position."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,ItsOnlySamm,0,Thu Feb 19 16:56:22 2015 UTC,"i check your channel everyday for new videos nope, nope, nope, when it appears i click on to the next video i wanna watch i watch them when they are released so i don't use those links. i feel it's a good balance. i quickly click on videos, so i don't look at your home page.   i'm still very much enjoying yours (and everyone's) minecraft series as well the last door, never alone etc   Keep up the good work :D"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,DavidTheHumanzee,0,Thu Feb 19 16:59:13 2015 UTC,"1)I find your videos threw twitter and subscription notices. 2)I find the endslates useful. 3)I look for links at the end of the video's. 4)I think the channel is fine the way it is.  5)The layout of the channel is fine.  Other feedback: In my opinion the channel is fine, I love all your videos."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,xWALNUTx,0,Thu Feb 19 17:00:03 2015 UTC,"1) I usually find videos via the subscription page on Youtube, but also follow you on twitter so I occasionally find new videos there first.  2) I'm primarily a mobile viewer so I can't really use endslates, if youtube could put annotations on mobile I would click/use them though.  3) I'm a big fan of Flux buddies and Alien Isolation, depending on how new the series is I usually just find episodes via the subscriptions page. If its a series I'm catching up on then I do use the links/playlists for each series.  4) Personally I'd like more flux buddies as once you and Duncan get deep into Thaumcraft you'll get into all kinds of hijinks. Other than that I'd just suggest doing a bit of prep for thaumcraft, maybe ""Finding"" a crafting altar out in the wilderness that you can repurpose etc.  It'd be cool if you and Duncan teamed up with Hannah and Nilesy for a few episodes on the new server and maybe set up some kind of truce/research pact with them."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Wolfencreek,0,Thu Feb 19 17:05:05 2015 UTC,"1) This last while through the kimmunity servers when everyone just ups and leaves for 20-30 minutes  2)I use the endslates and usually watch whatever is there for the 10 or so seconds it's there  3)I really enjoy your long series and it would be great if you could do more, especially if Hannah or Duncan is there! You guys have really great chemistry. I generally use the description for ""episode hopping""  4) I think your channel is well balanced with content with alternating days of minecraft and whatever else you're playing.  5) The layout of your channel is nice, its unique to you so IMO you should keep it that way. (I like the way Hat Films do it too but that doesn't mean you should change the way you work)  Hoped this helped!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Vamprat,0,Thu Feb 19 17:05:22 2015 UTC,"1) Sub box and twitter if i didn't already see it in my sub box  2) not particularly useful for me, but I do like them.  3) Playlist links. If I get to a video from outside a playlist, it'll be great to e able to quickly get to the right playlist.  4) I'd like to see more overall Let's Plays (The last of us was one of my favorite of your series.), short of that more Kimpression videos. Loving Minecraft currently. A minecraft series with you and Hannah would be awesome XD  5) I think the navigation is fine, but do what you want. :D"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Katur,0,Thu Feb 19 17:05:37 2015 UTC,"1) I look at youtube (I've got my subscription page bookmarked) and see if you have a new video on your channel. Or I look here and see if the bot's posted it.  2) I do watch them but I don't usually click them, that said please don't get rid of them because I think your videos would be kinda empty without the boppy music at the end! That's pretty much your trademark for me (like Hat Films' weird intro music is for them).   3) I usually watch the episodes as they come out so I don't usually need to click previous or next episodes. But keep doing the long play series!   4) I'm good with what you've got. Need more Nano's Village though!   5) I don't really look much on your main YT page since I get all the eps individually here or on my subscription page."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,evildrganymede,0,Thu Feb 19 17:07:12 2015 UTC,1) i think they're good and funny  2) normally i don't only if it looks cooler something 3)i never use the previous episode links cause i've seen them already 4)maybe more vlogs/ a new vlog channel maybe??? 5)i think thats good as it is now AND maybe another long during series with duncan cause i really like you both in a team
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,mcSpectacle,0,Thu Feb 19 17:07:46 2015 UTC,"1) I have a list of Yogscast producers on my browser's default page, including yours. A simple click is all I need to see if you've added a video I want to watch.  2) I personally don't find them useful, but I'm too used to them at this point to see them disappear. I don't click on them.  3) Playlists all the way.  4) Not necessarily what you're asking for, but I'd love to see ""Kim's Theme Redux"" by The Disco King to appear at the start of some of your videos again. As for balance, I feel like things are fine. You're not a one trick pony, which is important.  5) Hat Films' layout would be a fine template to draw from. They seem to have the most refined and professional style out of everyone in/affiliated with the Yogscast."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,acprescott,0,Thu Feb 19 17:11:33 2015 UTC,"1) I use both Youtube and Twitter, 2) I always use the endslates to find new things, 3) I look at the endslates for next ep, but first and last added would be good, 5) please add the best stuffs on your yt page, like flux buddies and things of relevance on your channel I find myself often skipping through your videos but could we please have an introduction giving a recap of what's happening. i know this is hard with big sessions but if you did it after or a voiceover or something? JUST MY OPINION DON'T STAB ME!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Finthemad,0,Thu Feb 19 17:13:37 2015 UTC,You skipped number 4. That's the most important one.
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,rasmus87,0,Thu Feb 19 17:43:52 2015 UTC,I had nothing to suggest :)
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Finthemad,-1,Thu Feb 19 18:15:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not attacking you or anything but I think ignoring number 4 is a bit ridiculous because her channel needs a lot of improvements if she wants to have a bigger, more diverse audience. She caters way too much to certain types of people."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,rasmus87,0,Thu Feb 19 18:35:49 2015 UTC,"Good afternoon, Kim! :D  1) I get subscription notices, but I also stalk Yogscast.com for new Flux Buddies episodes.  2) I don't tend to click on endslates because usually I'm watching something in a playlist, or I'm already caught up and am watching the most recent episodes for things on various channels, but I love watching the next-episode previews.  3) I LOVE long series. LOVE THEM. I stalk both Flux Buddies and Owl Island in particular, and I tend to vastly prefer them over shorter series, because I'm one of those nuts who gets emotionally involved.  4) Loving the Minecraft, seeing you in FB and Cornerstone I think is a very good mix. I don't know if it's helpful, but so far I like the balance.  5) I'll be honest, I don't tend to look at front pages -- I go straight for videos or playlists.  As for additional feedback, I know it must be a pain in the backside to get everyone together with their wild schedules, but I'd love to see more main-series collabs or cameos -- especially between you, Duncan, Hannah, and Nilesy, and if you could sneak Rythian and maybe Zoey in there too...  ...Okay maybe I'm just greedy. Ahem."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Facsimilii,0,Thu Feb 19 17:14:53 2015 UTC,"1) Mostly Sub Notices. 2) i enjoy your endslates! and when i click them they say ""Video is Private...Sorry"" lol 3) i generally click next ep or prev ep on the youtube video list. 4) i love the minecraft stuff you do with or without duncan. i think the balance of minecraft and other games is Great. 5) i think your layout is ok atm the hatfilms one sometimes confuses me lol."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Sriscraft,0,Thu Feb 19 17:15:37 2015 UTC,"1) I find your new videos because I'm subbed and I get them on my sub box on YouTube. 2) I do see them but I don't use them, mostly because I keep up with your videos and usually watch them the day they release. 3) Again, I don't because I watch them on the day of release. If I do fall behind I would click on the annotation in the endslate. 4) I do like a balance of Minecraft and other games. I love flux buddies but I have really enjoyed your other series as well. 5) I like your layout. Keeping series organized in playlists is always good."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,marquinator92,0,Thu Feb 19 17:16:35 2015 UTC,"1) I just check the channels for new content  2) I like the endslates for the teasers for the next episode  3) For long play series I usually either watch them as they come out or go off a playlist.  4)I think the balance is pretty good. I will second what someone else said, really enjoy collab stuff. Even games I'm not all that interested in, like most horror games, I'll watch if its a collab because I find stuff like that to be a lot of fun.  5) Personally I haven't had any trouble trying to find stuff on your channel and if I'm looking for something specific I'll either search or look through playlists."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Kira24,0,Thu Feb 19 17:16:53 2015 UTC,"I know the time of release for quite a few Yogs channels. I always check Kim's channel at 18:30, main channel at 19:00, Duncan's channel at 20:00, etc. I'm not weird or anything. I always watch the endslates when there's a preview to the next episode. When it's music, I usually don't - but then again I do miss the days sometimes when most channels had a bit of music at the end. Hm. See 1. I'm almost always up to date... I'm not weird! Love dat minocraft. Adventure maps are always Christmas come early to me, and I assume Nano's Village is returning soon as well, so yay! (I like the balance, I'll survive as long as Flux Buddies lives /single tear) I think a few current and iconic series would do - like Flux Buddies, Nano's Village, Alien is quite good... It's been a good while since there was a Kimpressions, so maybe that doesn't need to be on the front page right now? I don't know, maybe I'm talking crap :B"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Aeverelle,0,Thu Feb 19 17:17:05 2015 UTC,"1) I typically find your videos through browsing Youtube daily. I'm a long time subscriber at this point.   2) I enjoy the endslates. While I don't always click them, they are fantastic. I quite like the trivia you've been adding to them as well. Also, the next episode previews are a great way to keep us wanting more!  3) When I want to watch previous/next episodes, I typically look for a playlist. That, above all else is my personal preference. However, I typically watch videos the day they go live. So, ""next episode"" buttons are very rarely used in my case.  4) I think your content balance is great the way it is. You have all kinds of content. Something for everyone.   5) While I like how well you categorize videos on your main page, my honest opinion is you should give your new ideas a go. If you find it doesn't work out, you can always go back. I do quite like the idea of a current series category at the top though.   As for how I interact with your videos and the links around them... I can honestly say I don't click much. I'll usually read the descriptions... and that's about it. I have no real interest in Tumblr, and I beleive I already follow you, and most of the yogs, on twitter. Also, I use an chrome plugin called ""AlienTube"" which replaces youtube comments with reddit topics about the video. So I usually don't feel the need to click the reddit link either. Obviously, there are exceptions... such as today :)  Kim, I'm a 30 year old guy who can be very picky about who I watch. I can count the number of livestreamers and youtubers I'd watch daily one my fingers. The varied content you provide, the humor, the scares, and your personality easily make you one of my favorites. Hell, I enjoy watching your content even more than sips at times, and lord knows I'm a huge fan of the big guy.   Keep letting your personality shine through... and don't be afraid to test the waters with new ideas when you feel the need for change. Gotta be happy with your content and presentation. If you're not, it will show. So, do what seems best for you and the channel. The viewers will follow."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,ClockwerkKaiser,0,Thu Feb 19 17:18:11 2015 UTC,"I find your vids (or more accurately they find me!) through Twitter notifications. Endslates I can take or leave.  Almost never click on them, and don't really see the point in them these days.  When viewing on tablet the links don't work in the YouTube app anyway.  A standard 'thanks for watching' slate would work for me, as I'm not a fan of when vids just suddenly end (like recent Magic Police vids).  What would be more important to me is a link to a schedule posted on Reddit or a couple of Tweets on a Monday for what is coming in the week ahead. Long play stuff.  I think the balance is almost right.  You have a good mix of working with other Yogs / people and also doing solo stuff.  The only improvement would be a bit more solo long play AAA games - but the important thing is you play the stuff you are interested in.  Honestly I would have preferred the Alien Isolation play through to be solo rather than with Hannah - keep working with Hannah for Fright Night, but for the games you are really passionate about, do them solo. In terms of next / previous links - they are not useful. The variety of content is very good - going from Minecraft to Learning DoTA with Pyrion, to very personal Indie games is great.  Maybe more console content would be nice.  Perhaps as a break from gaming you may want to do some anime, film or book vlogs.  I know I'd be interested in your opinions on Ghibli films.  Also the 500k subs cooking episode you did was fantastic (if you could post the recipes that'd be great!! :) ) I find the Playlists kinda useful.  Especially for series where you alternate videos between channels (like you and Duncan for Flux Buddies).  It's also handy to have them if looking for an old vid. The way Hat Films organises stuff is a good idea.  For anyone coming to your channel for the first time, having well organised lists is a huge bonus.   Keep up the good work, and most importantly keep playing the stuff you want."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Jdoki,0,Thu Feb 19 17:18:12 2015 UTC,Her channel should be strictly about gaming. Not all that other random vlog type crap.
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,rasmus87,0,Thu Feb 19 17:23:51 2015 UTC,1) Sub box or Twitter. 2) Never use them. 3) I always watch the latest episode so I don't click the next or previous ep links. 4) Can't beat a bit of Duncan and Hat Films. Other collabs would be appreciated. 5) Honestly don't l look the channel page.
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,rawrower,0,Thu Feb 19 17:19:29 2015 UTC,"E-mail subscription on YouTube. I don't use Twitter I honestly can't even recall what they look like tbh. I very rarely click on them Playlist, the related links column thing on the right, the video description. In this order Minecraft's been going on long enough IMO, Fright Night is cool, collab videos are cool, LPs of adventure games are cool, RL stuff (vlogs, specials, interviews, whatever) is cool too The playlists with the more specific stuff (specials, interviews, event coverage) are useful being there, but the random playlist etc. kind of clutter up the place. The iconic series thing could be cool though"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Tyranus9,0,Thu Feb 19 17:27:22 2015 UTC,"I primarily just go to yogscast.com and watch the series' there. Though if obviously one of the users isn't up yet, then I will go to the main yt page of that user.  Because I use the yogscast site, the endslate don't have links, so I don't use them.  Because I tend to stay up to date on videos, I don't look for links, because the new video is non existent, however if I fall behind, I like the next episode like in the endslate.  I am a huge fan of flux buddies. However I, personally am not a huge fan of horror, which I know you love playing. So my personal preference would be less horror. I do love the other things you play, such as ""life is strange"" so I watch other series like that, but skip the horror stuff.  I have no preference as long as the recent uploads are on top, unlike on the turpster page.  Hope this helps :)"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,gate567,0,Thu Feb 19 17:29:15 2015 UTC,"1) Subscription notices   2) The previews for upcoming eps are the only thing I look forward too in the endslate.   3)Annotations and playlists are a great. I watched Flux Buddies religiously so I had no need for them but I came to watch Alien Isolation after you've finished it and the playlist helped with the watching.  4) Id like to see more culture talk, your video on chinese new year was pretty fun and entertaining to watch. I love the minecraft stuff and I like the balance yo have. Maybe more horror games.  5) I rarely look at it, but it seems fine to me."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,jillfog,0,Thu Feb 19 17:29:40 2015 UTC,"1) A mix of Twitter and daily checking YouTube.   2) I'm often watching videos on mobile devices, and I don't THINK I can click on endslates? They are usually a good indicator if I've missed a vid, though.  3) I never bother looking for previous/next links (Cause I make the assumption they're not there to click- which is my own fault). If I'm watching a full series, I like to have them in a playlist, or they usually pop up on the side. The links in the description wouldn't hurt, though.   4) I'm really enjoying your one-off holiday vids! I love the horror content as well! I can never get enough of you playing horror games.   5) I don't often go to the main page...   How I watch your videos: Often I'll go for a playlist and have that playing on one of my monitors while I work on my comics on the other side! I don't have adblock, but I do skip ads when I notice them on and skippable. If I'm just watching random videos, I'll often find the next in the series on the side bar when the current one is ending/ends.   Hopefully some of that is helpful! =) You're doing great work!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,rasmus87,0,Thu Feb 19 17:29:54 2015 UTC,"Finally, someone else who likes horror games. A lot of ygk viewers seem to be take anti-horror. It's annoying."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,jillfog,0,Thu Feb 19 17:33:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize any of Kim's viewers were anti-horror! I was blinded by love, I suppose! haha =) It's one of the (many) things that Kim does that brings her into my fav youtubers list!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,The_Under_Taker,0,Thu Feb 19 18:28:28 2015 UTC,"1) YouTube 3) Flux buddies is a great series, also loved your Alien isolation(the best moments you  geeking out about it) 4) The balance is good...but you could try out more of indie games it should be fun. I think your doing a great job..keep up the good work :)"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,nnmrlvs,0,Thu Feb 19 17:31:09 2015 UTC,"1) I don't watch YouTube videos daily, so every so often I directly check pages of YouTubers I like to see if there's any content that would interest me.  2) Yup! I'll click the next episode button and sometimes other series if I haven't seen them before.  3) Usually annotations or playlists. Depends on how many episodes there are to watch.  4) I'm not a massive fan of Minecraft content, so I tend not to watch it. I've been enjoying your single player playthroughs as your commentary is pretty interesting and insightful. I also like multiplayer playthoughs such as The Yawhg, Octodad or Trivial Pursuit. They're pretty fun to watch. Plus Fright Night with Hannah! Not too bothered how often Fright Night is, though. I'd rather you guys play legit good horror games than saturate it with the crappier games on the market.  5) I use it check the most recent videos and very occasionally to find a playlist to watch through."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,madhead1409,0,Thu Feb 19 17:33:23 2015 UTC,kim for question 2 Please can you do a minecraft series with Hannah and 5 if you think thats bothering you why dont you have a few youtube channels where there's vlogs on one and gaming on the other or more (if you want for more categories)
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Epicentera,0,Thu Feb 19 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"1) I check Lewis and Simon's page, Duncan's page and yours most days. Sometimes I'll catch a tweet of Duncan or you.  2) I've found a lot of videos to watch on endslates, I love 'em  3) LOVE LONG SERIES! But then again I'm a huge fan of ""then what happened?"" and long series really fulfills that need. Also why I am a fan of Discworld.  4) I love Minecraft videos. But it's more the interaction between all the team members that I watch it for (and also tips on mods). This is why I watch Achievement Hunters Let's Play Minecraft - they're total idiots usually, but that's what makes it such fun. (I'm not saying you are an idiot, but it's the goof-ups that make it interesting!)  5) I don't usually look on front pages of channels anymore, I go straight to the video page and check which videos got uploaded recently.  I could listen to Lewis and Duncan ALL DAY, they (hardly) never get flapped (they're unflappable). But just them by themselves doesn't work, which is why I love Simon and Kim! The Straight men need goof balls to play off'f, and it works beautifully, especially in long series and/or adventure maps."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,sioga93,0,Thu Feb 19 17:42:35 2015 UTC,1)find through subs 2) i watch through a youtube app alot so i dont    3) love long series but watch through playlist if i'm not caught up. so if you can place all new content in playlists same day that would be nice 4) you are perfectly balanced if you can do more w/ guests like Hakimon or bring in people for short games like you did on trivial pursuit. 5)watch all never too much always good content even the valentines day cheese fest that you did. No navigation problems that i have ever had but if you think you need it then no one would complain.  Just relax take a deep breath and remember that you are doing quite a dandy job.
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,SamuEL_or_Samuel_L,0,Thu Feb 19 17:43:27 2015 UTC,"1)  Everything through the subscription notices.  Sometimes I'll happen to see you folks promote a new video on Twitter, but that'll just cause me to check my subscriptions page to see what's new. 2)  I barely ever use any of the navigation features on the end slates.  In almost all cases, I watch videos within 24 hours of their release, so there is no ""next video"" link active.  And if I'm watching episode X of a series, I've probably watched episode X-1, so no need for a back link (though I'm sure it wouldn't hurt!)  I like the idea of using the end slate to suggest videos from other series (perhaps older series that newer viewers haven't seen?).  If I'm re-watching a series, I'll use the playlist functionality rather than end slate links.   3)  As above.  For long series I've either already watched everything as it came out, or and (re-)watching and using the playlist functionality to move through the videos. 4)  I'm a sucker for variety!  I think you've got a pretty good mix between staple Minecraft content, other games, vlogs, etc.  I've especially liked the last few days of flash-games with sorta-kinda-related commentary.  Maybe this is a good format for more mindless chat/vlog type stuff (everyone loves good rambly podcasty type material, yeah?) 5)  The only time I ever go to any of the YouTube pages for anyone I'm subscribed to is when I'm looking for a specific series' playlist to watch through.  Otherwise, I only catch things in the subscription box.   So I guess, for me, I'm mostly driven to content through the subscriptions box.  I do see the videos advertised on Twitter though ... maybe you could also use this as a platform to occasionally suggest older videos/series/playlists as well?  Here in Australia, most of the Yogscast content for the day is released prior to me waking up in the morning, so I run out of content quite early in the day.  I'm pretty sure I'll happily re-watch older videos that I would have otherwise forgotten about if they're suggested outside of Yogscast ""prime time"".  Hope this ramble about mah YouTube habits is helpful!  Keep up the good work! :3"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,AlloyMorph,0,Thu Feb 19 17:45:50 2015 UTC,"1) Subscription box. Occasionally the subreddit New page if i'm also browsing there when you upload, but mostly the sub box.  2) Endslates do occasionally show me a video I didn't know about, but I have annotations turned off by default so I pretty much never click the links.  3) For long-form playthroughs I usually wait until the weekend and then watch the entire week's worth in a day via the playlist (Alien Isolation and Life Is Strange in particular I marathon'd when I saw your final episode go up), so once again the annotations aren't used. Flux Buddies on the other hand I watch ASAP and the links in the description are very useful because the series alternates channels.  4) Love Minecraft and can't wait to see what else will happen on the new server. Sometimes will watch the horror games if it's a finished playthrough.  5) Don't really visit the channel page too often so can't comment much on the layout as it stands."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,DuckOfDuckness,0,Thu Feb 19 17:48:22 2015 UTC,"Hi Kim!  1) Almost every day I go through the Subscription Feed. I scroll down to where I left off last time, then work my way through the videos I want to watch oldest to newest.  2) I usually see the endslates if they aren't too long, but if it's a channel that I'm already subscribed to I don't click on them. For me endslates are more a nice way to end the video so it doesn't just stop. When I do click them it's because I've just discovered that channel and want to see what kind of videos there are.  3) Because of how I find new videos (see answer to Q1), I don't miss episodes and I also don't click annotations for the next ep (usually it's not out, or it's because I watch videos in the order they're released). Sometimes there's a game I decide I want to play for myself before I watch. Once I've finished the game, I'll then find a playlist for that Let's Play and watch it/catch up that way.  4) Personally I've grown really tired of Minecraft, both watching and playing. Ideally I would like there to be no MC content at all so there would be even more time for other games. Right now it's only Flux Buddies though, which I don't watch, so it's really not a big issue since there's plenty of other content. Your v-day and Chinese New Year videos were a nice idea, but I really just couldn't stand those games. Which makes me sad because I really love to just hear you ramble (more vlogs hinthint). I guess I could just listen to them without watching. Maybe I'll do that.  5) I'll refer to my answer to question 1 again. Because of the way I find new videos from the channels I'm subscribed to, I almost never actually go to their channel page. Occasionally there's that LP I have to catch up on because I wanted to finish the game first, and then it's quite nice that there's all these lists. I do think that an 'Iconic Series' or 'Best Vids' would be a good idea to have at the top for new people arriving. As I've mentioned a few times now, it's only when I've discovered someone new that I really go through their channel."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Hazel-Rah,0,Thu Feb 19 17:55:36 2015 UTC,"1) Subscriptions page. I use the Youtube Centre addon/script so that I have the old grid style subscription pages and never miss anything.  2) I skip endslates, too much stuff to watch at the end of the day after work  3) I have annotations disabled, so I personally prefer links in the description  4) Love the current content mix, only suggestion would be more collaboration type videos with new people. Nano's Village is extremely fun, especially the one with Hatfilms, it'd be fun to find new interesting combos (sometimes feels like the yogscast has preferred partners, I want to see more unexpected collaborations!)  5) I don't visit main pages very often, only really to watch a series I'd previously skipped for one reason or another (no time, wasn't interested in the game), so playlists are my highest priority."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,sharlotte2468,0,Thu Feb 19 17:57:02 2015 UTC,"1) Subscription box :D I have a group called Yogscast that groups you all together. 2) Uhh, endslates I don't realy click on, but I stay till the end cause the music is awesome. 3) Links work when they are in the description especially if there is a mobile viewer. 4) I like your content atm, especially series (like the recent Trivia Persuit) with other Yog-Members 5) I like your channel atm :D  Also, the vlogs are good, so maybe they could be a routine weekly thing?"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,fekbenn,0,Thu Feb 19 17:58:51 2015 UTC,"1 & 5) I use the youtube sub box to find your videos so I almost never click annotations or visit your channel page. That being said, those things are pretty important for new or more casual viewers. When I check out a new yt channel I usually sort their videos by 'most views' and start there, so that 'iconic videos' option you mentioned is smart for new viewers, 'current series' is helpful for when those new viewers become regulars.   2) Sometimes I stop watching the really long series (like flux buddies) for a while if they get stale for me or if I'm too busy to catch up, but if I see a clip from a good flux buddies episode in the endslate for, say, a fright night episode then that can convince me to go back to the series. So endslates are good! I do watch a lot of videos on my phone or through my tv so I can't actually click links unless they're in the description.   3) Your long play series with Hannah or Nathan are my favorite things on your channel I think :) if I'm bulk watching them, I look for the next/previous episode links in either the description or endslate, but they're also usually in the recommended video section (which is easier to use on mobile.)  4) Your content is pretty good for me right now. I'm a little sick of minecraft in general, but if that's what's getting the views I say keep doing it. There's enough other stuff on your channel that even if I don't want to watch minecraft I feel like I can find something else I do like. My only recommendation would be maybe the occasional irl vid?  I look forward to seeing what you do with all our feedback :)"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Cinilla,0,Thu Feb 19 18:03:22 2015 UTC,Twitter and reddit I don't really find them useful but I like it when they have a bit of a preview of the upcoming video Usually the video description. I prefer videos that have a live cam and other people (like Fright Night or Trivial Pursuit). Also really loved the dynamic you had with the PS Access boys during Christmas Livestream so a video with them would be great! Maybe Trivial Pursuit? Afraid I don't have much of an opinion on your main YT page.
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,KoLycaon,0,Thu Feb 19 18:23:29 2015 UTC,"I find daily videos either through Reddit or going over to your channel, I have a YouTube account  except I'm usually on mobile and not logged in. Endslates, can't click as annotations don't work on mobile however it has sometimes given me ideas of what else to watch though. I usually watch as it goes on so that goes back to how I find daily videos. But for older series, I rely on playlists as I find it easier to cycle to newer episodes/find specific episodes in the playlist. I like the balance as it is and I don't feel it is too heavy on either side. But I also really enjoy seeing you play indie games (The Last Door) or games with a more personal meaning (Valiant Hearts or Life is Strange). I'm fine with how the layout is on the front page, I don't think it's too cluttered."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,virgash,0,Thu Feb 19 18:32:33 2015 UTC,"1) I see it in my subscription notices and on here.  2) Typically I watch everything that you put out on the day its uploaded so I don't really click anything. I do see endslates since I always let the video play until it stops.  3) For longer series I'm normally caught up, but if I'm not previous episode links help a lot. If I'm looking for the playlist I'll go to your channel and find it in the list of playlists there.  4) I love your solo adventures and things with Hannah the most, but I do still enjoy Flux Buddies since it alternates channels and isn't intrusive on your normal content. I'm not the biggest fan of Minecraft, but I still watch it since you seem to enjoy recording it.  5) I don't think you have too much on your YT page, but I usually don't scroll down I just use the tabs like uploads or playlists to get to where I want. Hat films have a pretty nice layout, maybe you could add a ""most popular videos"" section for people who are new to your channel."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,echeveriia,0,Thu Feb 19 19:03:44 2015 UTC,"Usually through email subscription notices, but I quite often see them on twitter before I check my email. I'm pretty neutral on endslates - I sometimes click on a video seen on an endslate if I haven't seen it yet but otherwise I don't really use them. If I'm watching a series I usually watch it in a playlist as I find it much easier, though it can be useful to have description links for mobile as it's often easier to find a video rather than the playlist. LOVE the balance of content on your channel, much more so than many others, I'm a big fan of minecraft but it's nice to have something different every now and again - I especially love fright night! I do go on your main YT page sometimes to find new content of yours if I'm all caught up. I definitely think having current/iconic series etc at the top Hat Films style is a very good idea.   I really love it when you play games that really interest you because you always have such interesting discussions about the subject matter, whether you're alone or with someone else (Valiant Hearts/Never Alone) and your enthusiasm is another part of why I love your videos so much. Your content is consistently enjoyable and of high quality, thank you so much for the work you put into it. I hope you're doing well, keep on keeping on Kim! xoxo"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,VidyaSauce,0,Thu Feb 19 19:06:11 2015 UTC,"1) NEW DAILY VIDEO. How do you find my new videos? Subscription notices, twitter, idle browsing?   I have Youtube set to email me every time you upload a video so can keep up to date with your content. No problems here.   2) ENDSLATES. Are they useful? Do you see them? Do you click on them?   Personally I usually don't click on the links in endslates. I think they can be useful for social network information and such but I don't think a full-screen endslate is completely necessary for that. I like the idea of having a small overlay pop up over the video at the end with a thanks for watching and useful info like Facebook, Twitter and reminders to subscribe and comment etc.   3) LONG PLAY SERIES. Think Flux Buddies, Alien Isolation. Do you click on annotations for the next ep? Do you want previous ep links? Where do you look for links? Annotations, endslate, playlist, video description?   When watching a playlist, I usually just try to find the playlist for the series on the persons channel, or just add a bunch of videos to my ""watch later"" playlist. I let the videos play one after the other usually without clicking anything.   4) CONTENT. Is there anything you'd like to see more of/less of? Minecraft - love it or hate it? Do you like the balance I have between Minecraft and other games? Want more of one or the other?   I think the current balance is fine. Though I do wonder if you would be up for doing some Kimpressions videos about your favourite games of yesteryear.   5) NAVIGATION. I think I have too much on my main YT page. Do you ever look at it all? Do you ever see the layout of playlists and find something that's piqued your interest? Do you care? Should I cut down the amount of lists on the main page? Should I have a couple with 'Current series' 'Iconic series' etc at the top? (I quite like Hat Film's layout...)   I'd be lying if I said I watch every single video you upload. I have a full time job and I am subscribed to a lot of people so I often have to pick and choose what I want to watch because I just can't watch everything in my subscriptions feed. Having said that though, variety is the spice of life and I think it's good to have a wide range of content to choose from.  As for your main Youtube page, to be honest I don't go there much. I watch most of my Youtube content from my subscriptions feed. If I need to find an older video or playlist of yours, I'll probably go directly to the videos or playlists page of your channel, and/or use the search box.  Hope this is of some help."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,peabody,0,Thu Feb 19 19:15:58 2015 UTC,"1) Twitter every time.  I have you favorited so I get phone notifications of your tweets.  It's  miles more reliable than youtube notification emails (which come hours late on occasion).   2) I like seeing them, but I almost never click them since I watch on mobile a lot.   3) For catching up on long running series I prefer play lists as they auto-play (even on mobile)  which is nice when I'm multitasking.   4) Flux Buddies is a mainstay for me, followed by fright nights. I'll watch anything which looks interesting.  I think you mentioned once that the following weren't your favorite types of videos to do, but I really do like your more serious solo videos like, the Last Door, Last of Us, valiant hearts, and Life is Strange. Probably because you're a very different, down-to-earth Kim in those and your monologue is always interesting to me.  You talk about your likes and dislikes and we get more of who you are, and it's a much more intimate experience for us fans.   5) Not sure how much a layout change would matter to us mobile users as I don't think we'd notice much of a difference. Even when I'm on my PC I almost never go to a main page as a subscriber.  I just check out the most recent uploads. My guess is the layout probably matters more to catching non-subscribers attention."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,SquirrelPowa,0,Thu Feb 19 19:16:16 2015 UTC,"I usually see your new videos thru the YouTube Sub alert thingie, where it shows updates from my subscriptions.  I generally don't click on endslates because what I do is move things to my ""Watch Later"" queue and then watch them via my Roku on my tv, while I play games on the laptop. Unfortunately, you can't click on things such as annotations and whatnot via the roku.  I love the long play series, Flux Buddies being my favorite of course as I really love the chemistry and banter you and Duncan have with each other. I do like other series, such as Monster Hunters, with Simon and Hannah, and was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed it! _^ If I do look for a link, I generally prefer to pull the vid back up on my pc, and click on a link from the description, as I watch vids via my Roku 99% of the time.  While Minecraft will always be close to my heart, I do enjoy a wide variety of games. I enjoy the way you mix things up on your channel, and honestly am quite pleased with the way you have balanced things thus far. The only thing I would suggest would be to perhaps set one day a week for an indie game showcase vid, simply because I don't feel as if enough youtubers do this, but you maybe find a game or something thru the week you feel others should know about and do a quick little video about it.  I have this thing against clutter, so I will agree that your main youtube page seems a bit busy. I also quite like the way that Hat Films has theirs laid out, as to me it's a bit more organized and doesn't send my slight OCD into fits lol. Generally, I watch current series on a daily basis, or the next day depending on how late it is when I get in from work. I watch older series usually when they're on a seperate playlist on my days off, as I can load them up and binge watch them.    Hope it helps, and as always, Keep being awesome Kim! <3's _^"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,i2xi,0,Thu Feb 19 19:19:44 2015 UTC,"1) Twitter, YouTube and the subreddit in that order. Usually you have tweeted about the video before the YT sub boxes have updated so that is how I usually find them.  2) Being honest I have never really used the endslates on any of your videos compared to say Hannah's channel for example. This is usually because the flux buddies (Season 1) didn't really have anything useful if that makes sense. Where as Hannah's have (or did use to have) links to her other current series or something coming up like her livestreams. I always see them though so if there ever is something useful I will usually end up clicking on whatever it is.  3) If I am watching the series as you release the videos every upload then no I wouldn't click on the annotations. However if I want to watch several in a row if I am having a lazy day for example then yes I will use the annotations because they are extremely useful. I think that previous and next ep links would be equally as useful to have so it easier to navigate to the other videos in the series but not essiential. I tend to look for the links in the form of annotations or I go to look to see if there is an existing playlist.  4) I think you have the balance pretty spot on to be honest. You have minecraft, horror games and then the odd vlog or vloggy type video. I have particularly enjoyed the Mario Kart and TP that was done as it is different and enjoyable to watch.  5) While I don't always look at your page I do think some changes could possibly be made. In my opinion it would be best to have whatever the current series are at the time to be at the top so I know what you are currently playing. I think horror/fright night with hannah could all go into one playlist and then sub playlists perhaps? (Not too sure that makes sense lol)."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Cooldude2605,0,Thu Feb 19 19:36:40 2015 UTC,"1: I find them in my sub's box or via twitter/tumblr. 2: I see them fine but don't ofter click on them unless its linked to something I've missed, mostly I just let it play out cos I like the endslate music. Honestly, I do a little dance along to it :p 3: With Flux Buddies I'll look for a link to the next episode during the endslate, since the series is split between yours and Duncans channels. Everything else I'll go to the Playlist tab or the Videos tab and search. 4: More horror would be cool, some of the older ones like Siren Blood Curse, or Ju-On: The haunted house simulator. As for Minecraft I think the current balance is fine. 5: I think its fine the way it is, but if you wanna steal them Hat boys layout that would be cool to :)"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,06johansenad,0,Thu Feb 19 19:50:52 2015 UTC,1 I find ur stuff because I subbed to u and it notifies me  2 I don't use endslates because I view u on my Xbox 3 yes I would like u total continue doing previous ep links and next ep links because I view on my iPod as well as my Xbox  4 i like the mix of games so that's ok 5 I don't care about the mess of it I think it's fine
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,dman-no-one,0,Thu Feb 19 19:58:34 2015 UTC,"1) I tend to just go to your channel every day to see if there's a new video.  2) I don't usually click on the endslate, but I do like how they provide a brief preview of the next episode.  3) If it's a long series you've already done like Alien Isolation, I like just starting up the playlist and watching all the episodes without having to click anything.  4) I love watching your Minecraft videos with Duncan, but it would be cool seeing other games crop up more often. I enjoyed your Never Alone videos with Nathan, and found the Chinese New Year video to be really interesting, although that was more due to your commentary than the actual games.  5) I don't really look at your channel layout very often - I just click 'Videos' to check for any new uploads; but I'd say putting your most popular series (god I wish there was a plural for 'series') up near the top would be good.  In conclusion, you're awesome, and your videos are awesome!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,shoukko,0,Thu Feb 19 20:12:40 2015 UTC,"Hi Kim! Thanks for producing all the awesome things you've been doing as of late as I've been really enjoying it :)! ...You might've wanted to set up a survey as it seems you've got a lot of responses! I'll add my own though down below:      New Daily Video -- I generally find your new videos via Youtubes sub boxes which occasionally dont work so I find myself in the habit of checking reddit and your channel directly.   Endslates -- Endslates are verrry useful for me and I certainly use them where they are provided. Having clear, defined links that ensure I can navigate through a series is especially useful if I happen to have missed an episode or want to go check if the next one is released.    Long Play Series -- I think having long play series split over multiple channels is a good solution to trying to increase your viewer base as it exposes more people to different styles of gameplay/commentary/video however in the case that it is over one or more channels, it is really important to ensure navigation is not inhibited as audience retention is unlikely to last as long if they have to manually search.   Content -- Right now, I've been enjoying the amount of content coming from the majority of the Yogs and especially from your channel as it really fits the style of games that I play... however, there does feel like there is a lot of minecraft in general across all of the Yogscast channels and while this is not necesairly true and may be psychological, it has had an effect. I find myself unable to watch more than 4/5 minecraft videos in one sitting (particularly since the current trend is that we are getting 15-20 minute videos... which I LOVE <3). Despite these problems, I am really satisfied with whatever games you feel like playing as it is your enthusiasm and enjoyment of them that adds to the appeal of the content itself :)!   Navigation / YT Page -- I do occasionally look into the main YT page and find no particular faults in it. It can be cool to go back there and to see a series I haven't watched in a while or one that has particular memories associated with it, so cycling the content of it every so often might be a possible way to intrest diffrent types of people. I dont mind diving into a series 20 episodes in to get a flavor of what things are like, but I know a lot of people strongly dislike this and prefer to watch them in the correct sequence and order, with playlists and clearly laid out titles -- for example, I do find difficulty in watching the GMod and GTA content on Hat Films and Duncan/Sjin's channels due to the lack of order. However, your Youtube should at the very least be an expression of yourself and your creativity :)! Do what you like with it! ________________________________________________    Whew That was more depth than one person can probably reasonably handle so I will just take this oppurtunity to say thank you for doing things like this /\, as it makes is feel involved and engaged with your content on the YT channel and you as a person!  Other more random points of feedback include the use of colored links as they have been shown to increase the amounts of clicks they receive (I believe there is a study citing yellow and red as the most clicked). Additionally, I really enjoy Turps' method of getting viewer response by posing a direct question (which admittatley causes spam in YT comments... but will replace existing spam anyway so dosent really matter) and his way of interacting with an audience (E.G: The ""click to go here"" buttons in YogTours.)  Thanks for everything and be sure to stay as awesome as ever Kim <3!!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Cadacis,0,Thu Feb 19 20:27:22 2015 UTC,"1) Either through Twitter or the sub boxes on YouTube. 2) I sometimes click the 'next episode' (if I'm not watching it in a playlist where it autoplays), and if I see something that interests me in the 'also on my channel' bit, or in the video list on the right, I click on that. 3) I tend to hide annotations, so I only see them if they're right at the beginning of the video - sometimes that's a good thing because it will say 'Previous Episode' and I'm like, ""Huh!?"" so I click it. Most of the time I watch in a playlist so it automatically plays the next video, but for the times when I'm not watching in a playlist I use the endslate and the video description. 4) I think you have a really good balance between Minecraft and other games. I also really enjoy the mix of solo videos and co-op videos. Also Vlogs! I love your Vlogs! In that same way I could listen to Sips ramble on for half an hour I could quite happily listen to you just talk about nonsense for half an hour too! The two videos you have done lately (Valentine's & Chinese New Year) I've really enjoyed :) 5) I scroll through your main page every now and then when I'm looking for my next videos to watch, but a lot of the time I go straight to the 'Playlist' tab. The Hat Films layout is nice, but there is nothing wrong at all with your current layout, IMO.  I love having videos organised in playlists (because autoplay and I am lazy :p) - especially when they're in the order first to last (a few youtubers I've noticed have theirs ordered last to first which is weird). I find a lot of videos that I haven't watched through the endslate or the list on the right.   Keep up the amazing work Kim! You're awesome! Please don't burn yourself out though - take some time to visit family if you need to, you sound like you really miss them!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Vinesma,0,Thu Feb 19 20:28:18 2015 UTC,"1) Usually here in reddit or in the morning when i surf youtube in bed. 2) Not really, I hardly ever use the endslates for anything. 3) I usually watch them in order when they are released, if i do miss one i click on the next button or the next video on the sidebar 4) You have a good balance right now i think, maybe a touch more  of none minecraft. 5) Never actually been on the main YT page, so i have no idea"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,bookworm6892,0,Thu Feb 19 20:31:42 2015 UTC,"1) Subscription box on my phone (I am mainly a mobile user).  2) I actually like the endslates even though I never get to click on them (on mobile as stated).  3) I usually just manually go to the channel and find what I want, sometimes I look for links in the description.  4) I like the balance, I will probably watch anything you put up anyway, but minecraft is covered so much by so many other channels I can see why it might be wise to tune it down a bit.  5) The youtube page on mobile is quite different so I can't really comment on that. But playlists are quite useful for me."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,ChrisDNorris,0,Thu Feb 19 20:41:51 2015 UTC,"*1)  Subscription notice! *2) Yes I see them! I would probably use them if I didn't already religiously watch every video you make. *3) When going to the next episode, I usually use the bar on the side with the suggested videos if I'm not using the playlist. *4) I quite like the Minecraft/not Minecraft balance you got going right now. With Flux Buddies being constant and Nano's Village coming out in semi-regular bursts, you got Minecraft content covered nicely, in a way that's not overbearing at all. Also I just wanna say that those browser game videos you've done are really good and a nice change of pace, so if you ever find another reason to put one of those out, do it. *5) The way you have your youtube page now is pretty nice and organized. If I ever want to go and rewatch a particular series, I can just go to your page and click the proper playlist, no sweat. If you want to change/improve it though, hat films do have a pretty nice setup you can totally steal the design from >:D"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,AyllieyaRosa,0,Thu Feb 19 20:42:13 2015 UTC,"1) I used to use subscription notices only but there's too much clicking that way. I have a bookmark folder for my browser and a right-click directly opens all the video pages of the YouTube channels I'm interested in. I have and use Twitter, but definitely not for new video info.   2) The end-slates are nice but I don't use or wait for them. In the past I've found they either have spoilers or the links don't work for whatever reason. Not you in particular but it's lead me to not using them; I know how to get what I want by myself.   3) Again I find that often Next Ep links get missed and I generally have annotations off. I only use playlists if I'm bulk watching anything. I tend to be fully up-to-date with your videos so I don't need them.   4) Two different Minecraft 'series' is just about right... with the odd adventure-style map you do from time to time. I'd be more than happy to see you do more of other games. Personally I prefer the content you do with at least one other person. It's not that your solo stuff is poor by any means, but you thrive on having someone to bounce off. (Edit: maybe you take this as doing MORE solo stuff to feel more comfortable at it)   5) I've never really looked to be honest, but it doesn't seem terrible. Everything is grouped as you'd expect. But I think that if YOU feel you have too much, then it's only going to annoy you more over time; clear it up now before it gets out of hand?   If I think of anything else, I'll let you know!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Ximajs,0,Thu Feb 19 20:43:03 2015 UTC,"1) I find them on your Videos page, I regularly check your YouTube page. Other than that, I follow you on twitter and notifications are sent to my phone, if I'm not on YouTube, twitter is the fastest.  2) I see them, but I don't necessarily click on the links. I tend to go back to your Videos page, or I'm viewing series' in playlists.   3) I sometimes click on the annotations, although if I'm behind, I'll watch playlists, if they're made. I rarely check the video description, however if something is mentioned in your video that intrigues me and the link is mentioned in there I will check it.  4) I love minecraft, I'd like to see you try some mini game maps or something along the lines. I'd like to see your take on some. I like the balance you have. Personally, I'm a big fan of your horror  and story based play- throughs.  5) I don't really scroll down too much on your main page. Mostly I tend to look at the Recent, and either click on from there or click specifically the videos or playlists tabs. Personally, the main page does seem somewhat overcrowded. Either reducing or as you mentioned something like ""Current Series"" etc might flow better.   As for any additional feedback, I suppose if you felt it were necessary you could make posts on Tumblr, upon releasing videos. I  spend a LOT of time on Tumblr (probably too much) so if I were to miss anything via YouTube or Twitter, I'd see it there. Although that would only really be beneficial if a fair few of your audience were Tumblr users, as well. Not really sure if there's much else to add.   Hopefully this helps a bit. -^ ♥"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,GildedGrizzly,0,Thu Feb 19 21:03:58 2015 UTC,"1) I usually check your channel once or twice a day. 2) I like endslates because then the video doesn't end too suddenly (shh, Nilesy), but I rarely click on them. 3) If I'm watching a series I haven't kept up to date with, I just click the next video in the playlist or let it go to the next video automatically. I look for links in the description, and think previous and next links are a great help. 4) I like the balance, and I've enjoyed the quirky themed videos for Friday 13th, Valentines and CNY. 5) I haven't really looked at your page before, I just go straight to the videos page, but it looks okay. Current series and iconic series are a good idea though."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Parasite159,0,Thu Feb 19 21:08:09 2015 UTC,"I primarily watch your videos on my Apple TV after I get home from work. I go through my subscriptions on YouTube, add them all to my Watch Later playlist, then stream them on my Apple TV. Because of that, I can't see any of the links or click on annotations or on the endslate, so I don't use or click on them.   As for Long Plays, I really enjoy them. I loved Alien Isolation because I knew I wasn't going to play it myself, plus it gave me something else to look forward to.  I think you're doing pretty well with balance of content, there's quite a variety which I think is great.   Like I said, I stream your videos from my Apple TV, so I hardly ever go on your YouTube page. I have no comment on its layout.  Keep up the awesome work! I, for one, am really enjoying all your content."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Seanysan,0,Thu Feb 19 21:09:57 2015 UTC,"1)Subscription 2)Never really paid attention to anyone's endplates(if that a bad thing?) 3)I'll normally look to see if you have a playlist for a long-play series, that way YT will auto-play the whole series in order. 4)I wouldn't watch your channel if i wasn't interested in your content now, would i? ;) 5)Your YT main page is great, clean, efficient and easy to navigate."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Hazzat,0,Thu Feb 19 21:10:44 2015 UTC,"1) I follow you on Twitter, so I get notified about your videos when you tweet them, since YouTube will give me notifications for every YouTube channel except the ones I watch daily (seriously how does that system work?). 2) I like the endslates, it gives a sneak preview of the next episode, but I can't really use the links on video since I'm a mobile user, and as far as I'm aware you don't put those links in the description. If you do, it'd be nice if you do what (I think) Hannah does, where at the bottom of her endslate she mentions the fact that there are those links in the description. 3) For flux buddies, I either watched via playlist so it automatically took me to the next episode, or I was waiting for the next episode. However I do think having links for the next and previous episodes are still a good thing to put in. 4) I love the flux buddies and nano's village (especially nano's village) because I find them relatively calm and relaxed as you talk about random topics. I like your balance of videos, and I think you're doing very well. In terms of series to make, I'd love (sensible) pack openings and card tournaments, though I'm not sure what games I'd like to see. 5) I like to use the playlists as it helps me watch a series of episodes easily, though I do not actively look for series to watch. Maybe having ""best of"" or ""this week of videos"" followed by the series you do would be a good setup."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,fire5432999,0,Thu Feb 19 21:15:15 2015 UTC,"1) Sub box! Or if I haven't been on YouTube for a few days I'll go straight to the channel.  2&3) I watch mostly on mobile, so end slates don't mean much! For long-play series I'll go through the playlist, especially if it's split between two channels like Flux Buddies.  4) I don't think I'll ever get tired of Minecraft stuff, but variety is the spice of life.  5) Yes, go and ""borrow"" Hat Films's layout! The current layout works, but a nice mix of videos and playlists is nice on the eyes.  I'm really digging the solo videos of random games lately where you can just waffle on about whatever!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,tghero,0,Thu Feb 19 21:24:08 2015 UTC,"1) I usually find your videos by checking YouTube, Twitter, and the subreddit. I often check your Twitter first as subscription notices can be unreliable.  2) I keep up-to-date with most of your videos, so I don't often click on the endslates, but I do hang around to see the preview of the next episode.   3) When I first started watching your videos I did find playlists helpful for catching up with missed videos, but now I'm usually up-to-date with your videos unless I'm catching-up or avoiding game spoilers, so I use the episode buttons and playlists rarely.   4) I like the balance between Minecraft and other games. I always love to see you and Hannah doing Fright Night as I'm a massive horror game fan. Also, I enjoyed your recent Indie game playthroughs, especially Never Alone with Nathan. I also enjoyed your Chinese New Year video; It was great to hear you talk about your culture and traditions.  5) I think you should go with a similar layout to Hat films. It's a good way of showcasing your older material for new viewers and keeping current viewers up-to-date with your recent videos."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Dwagonman,0,Thu Feb 19 21:48:09 2015 UTC,1)  I find all videos from the subscription tab and look through everything my subs have uploaded for the day.  2) I almost never pay attention or look at the end slates but sometimes they are useful and doesn't abruptly end the video.  3) Previous episode links aren't very important to me because I am usually up to date with videos and can just search for the previous episode anyway.  4) The balance is fine by me!  5) I rarely go to your main YT page because I can see all new uploads in the sub box.  I usually watch on my PC when I get home from school and keep up to date with the videos you put out.
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Shinosei,0,Thu Feb 19 21:57:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for asking Kim!  1) Find the vids on the sub dropdown on my main YouTube page  2) Nah, I don't use them or view them, although i like the outro music you Yogs use (say that three times fast)  3) I always prefer playlists - love when Sips does his for instance. I'll usually watch while I'm doing other things so it's great to just let them play without me having to do anything. If there's no playlist I just pray it's in the suggestions or I go to the main video page.  4) Not a minecraft fan here. I like your playthroughs with other Yogs. The stuff with you as a mediator for Hat Films or whoever is great IMO, the Mario kart stuff, etc. Personally I prefer Lets plays that aren't of plot-based games, just because sometimes I want to play them. Like I said, Mario Kart was great, Nidhog has been pretty entertaining, and I like the horror stuff you do since I don't tend to play a lot personally.  5) I totally look at that page for you and others! Definitely how I find content. Love being able to just click a playlist and go. Having it organized is really helpful to me. Once again, I really like how Sips organizes things - current series towards the top, etc.   Love your content, thanks as always!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,GoldHusky,0,Thu Feb 19 22:14:03 2015 UTC,"Hi Kim ! I signed up here especially :-) 1 - I go down the list of my YT subs checking them one by one for new videos. (Not all of them but some, inc yours, I check daily). The YT notifications have always been bugged and I rarely get chance to watch the vids when the Twitter notices come out.  2 - Not useful for me, because I'm usually opening the videos from the sub page, or I'm following a playlist. But ... they're a good closer to each video, far more pro than a fade-to-black.  3 - Alien Isolation and especially Last Of Us were AWESOME. So good, I enjoyed watching Last of Us through again for a second time. The solo stuff lets you talk randomly, which allows your charming personality to break out and enchant us.  4 - Minecraft pays the bills but I stopped watching the Minecraft content a long time ago. (Got bored somehow ...) I believe your strength is in doing those solo plays where you draw the audience in to experience the game you're playing as much as you're experiencing it.  5 - The way my brain works, I see a page once and when I go back, I only see the relevant bits. Like : Open Kim's page, go to Videos List, See if there's anything new. And I don't perceive anything else. It's a good page though and having those playlists is how I enjoyed the Last Of Us for the second run through. Links to Current active Series Playlists is a good idea :-).  Hope that helps and - most important - I hope that Kim Personality keeps shining through. It's your magic and your strength and it's why we keep coming back."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,John-Piece,0,Thu Feb 19 22:43:07 2015 UTC,"1) Either Twitter or through the 'My Subscriptions' tab on YouTube.   2) I like them and use them! I also think they add a nice character to the channel!   3) If I'm watching a series that I'm behind on (such as Flux Buddies which I finished today) I either rely on the playlist the series is on or I click on the annotations on the endslate.  4) I love the Minecraft series and I also miss Nano's Village! I also love the other YouTube videos around the Minecraft ones so I'm satisfied! But I'd be happy in viewing whatever you wanted to post since it is your channel after all!  5) I think your layout's fine, but I also do like Hat Films'... OH THE CONFLICT!  My only issue is - and I really don't want to sound like a moaning-myrtle - is that sometimes on the playlist option, when it goes to the next video it either plays an earlier video in the series or a completely random video on the playlist. Especially on Flux Buddies - I'm not sure if it was on yours or Duncan's channel - it did this and I'm not sure if it's just my internet, YouTube as a whole, or something wrong in the Playlist. I just thought I'd let you know!  By the way! Stay amazing and keep making awesome vids! I love clicking on my Subscriptions tab after doing uni work to find content posted from your channel already posted! It brightens my day!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,TheCyberTronn,0,Thu Feb 19 23:01:42 2015 UTC,"I think your new videos are great, although admittedly I've not been watching too many of them lately. I personally really enjoy the sort of party-style games, (like the trivial pursuit, mario kart, ect) and I'd love to see more of them, since you're quite good at organising them. The flash game specials were fun too, but I imagine they could get old and repetitive quite quickly.  I usually check onto youtube every day after 8 o'clock (which I've worked out is when most yogs start posting), and go though all my subs to see if there's anything good.  For the page, I'd say there does seem to be quite a lot, perhaps only focusing on the more recent / current playthoughs. (It looks like the front page has more than the 'playlists' page! The front page would be for people first visiting your page, the playlists would be for people who like your stuff and want to see EVERYTHING!) Personally, I like what Sjin has done by featuring the first epsidoe of each of his series. ('Course, that said, I'm not an expert and i barely have a youtube, so everything I'm saying could be trash /o/)  As for the length of videos and playthoughs, I think a variety is better - sometimes people get into an alternation of a few long series, I remember a while back you had Flux Buddies, Alien Isolation and Nano's village. I never watched Alien Isolation, and had sort of lost interest in Nano's Village, so when I fell behind on Flux Buddies there wasn't really much to look forward too. Right now though, there's a lot of variety of series length.  I couldn't really comment on the annotations, since I don't have them enabled on my account, but I'd think a 'next' would be just fine (especially if you have them in a playlist and they autoplay anyway). I think endslates are good, I prefer a few minutes of music and links to a 30-second long teaster for the next episode - most of the links, though, are stuff that I'd find anyway.  Also the obligatory comment about minecraft. Honestly I think Flux Buddies, Nano's village and the occasional adventure map is a good amount, minecraft is popular after all!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,HarassedCivilServant,0,Thu Feb 19 23:07:29 2015 UTC,"Hellu.:) I check for videos through Youtube but I always go to the channel and check the recent activities just to be sure. This goes for any channel I follow.     I think it's useful to have a few seconds for outro just so that a video doesn't stop abruptly. I have never click on any annotations though.     I'm quiet updated on the videos so I don't need the next episode links. However, I think that for someone late to the party, both previous and next episode links will be useful. Previous because one might stumble upon a random episode and wonder -""I wonder what happened before this?"" and so can easily go back. I personally check the description.     I think collabs with someone else than Hannah and Duncan would be great. I like the competitive party games like the recent Trivial Pursuit and the Osmo game. That may just be so I can sit there all smug while you struggle and go -I KNOW THAT ONE!     It is an absolute must for me that the Recent Uploads are on top and not a playlist like what Hannah had with her Assassin's Creed one for some time. I don't really check playlists because well I've already watched them but I think that it's good to have the ongoing ones on top followed by the most popular ones to capitalize on one's strengths.     For other things, I like simple thumbnails that are not trying to cram everything into a stamp sized canvas. I watch videos on the computer. Oh and I think your Channels page needs some updating. :P    I'll take my leave."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Thiefree,0,Fri Feb 20 00:24:56 2015 UTC,"1) NEW DAILY VIDEO: I'm a bit strange with this one. I've got a special list that I keep. I felt like I subscribed to way too many people, so I have a list of the people I watch the most. I watch Kim's videos from here.  2) ENDSLATES: They are useful, I see them, but I rarely click them. This could be because I've already seen the video, or the video doesn't interest me. Overall, I probably watch 60% of Kim's overall videos (again, for many reasons) because all of them interest me, but that's for point 4.  3) LONG PLAY SERIES: I watch Flux Buddies most of the time. If I miss an episode, I'll probably click the annotation if I haven't already shoved it in Watch Later. Previous Episode links would be useful if I've missed an episode, but I think this would be the only reason. I don't think these would be a good idea. I get links from the endslate more than anywhere else.  4) CONTENT: Minecraft - Love it. I think, looking at view counts, Minecraft is your money maker, and everything else is passion. And it's clear there is a lot of passion put into your channel. If you're happy with the ratio, I'm happy with the ratio. If you do tweak it, don't tweak it too much, though. Also, remember that thing you did with Pyrion and Dota? Yeah, more of that, but different people and different games (e.g. Duncan and Hearthstone maybe, or Lewis in Dota), I really enjoyed that mini-series. Although the cutting of the episodes was a bit dodgy, as most people want a Dota video as a full match. If you do do it again, then you should consult other people's videos to see how you should structure it.  5) NAVIGATION: All I'd suggest would be to use that vertical orientation (this one) to display videos or playlists. It feels cleaner and gives more information on one screen.  Keep up the great videos, Kim!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,BowtieMaster,0,Fri Feb 20 00:28:13 2015 UTC,"Well I'm a horrendously infrequent gamer and about 10 years behind the times on internet stuff, but here are my responses for what they're worth! :)  1: I just check your youtube page every so often to see if anything new has appeared in the 'Recent activities' section. I've never got around to signing up to Twitter and I'm not actually subscribed to any youtube channels for notifications (please don't hurt me...)  2: I do like the endslates - I must admit I enjoy the little tune and always let it play to the end! I tend to click more on links that are for different content to the current video; I will only rarely use the endslate to click on 'Next episode', or another video of the same type.  3: I tend to prefer it when both Previous and Next episode links are in the description underneath the video; will also use the playlists if I'm looking for a specific episode of something. Endslate - rarely; annotations - never.  4: I think the current balance is fine. My favourite videos tend to be those that combine talking about the current game with random off-topic chat about other everyday subjects, so I can pick up some interesting trivia whilst I watch - so more of the same really :)  5: I rarely look past the 'Recent Activity' section, and normally don't stay on the main page for very long - the time it takes to either click on a new video or see there's nothing new and leave! (I've lost track of how many times I've heard the first 5-10 seconds of the Sigourney Weaver interview now!). Looking at it now, I do find the amount of lists a little bit overwhelming, and to be honest I have mostly discovered other random videos of interest from either the list of suggested videos on the right hand side of the page, or from random end-slates.  Cheers! :)"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Tordeck_Thunderfist,0,Fri Feb 20 01:19:25 2015 UTC,"I like the next ep / prev ep links as it makes it easier to navigate playlists on my phone. Because I mostly watch them on my mobile, I can't follow any suggested annotations unless they're linked in the description. I don't know if my experience is common.  I also often play them on the tv through an Xbox one, because it's the future and I can, so YouTube playlists are helpful for that. Always nice when they're kept up to date."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,otwem,0,Fri Feb 20 02:18:54 2015 UTC,"1) I check the youtube subscription box every day (and occasionally check the channel itself to check if youtube skipped something Rocks Fist at Youtube  2) I like the endslates — sometimes, if I've missed a series, it will show it to me. Also, the music is awesome.  3) I prefer links in the description just because sometimes the annotations can get really messy. I like having playlists for everything possible, because sometimes I miss things and then binge watch series, so playlists are ultra helpful  4) I love your commentary, and I love you playing Minecraft. Sometimes, I think it would be nice though if you tried breaking things up with a few playthoughs of ""proper"" games. (**Note: When I say proper games, I am referring to large projects by big companies such as Ubisoft. I am not at all attempting to put down smaller games, as they are often better than large ones. I am simply tired and can't remember the correct vocabulary). A playthrough of a game like AC or Far Cry, etc. might be nice. Love the current content though!  5) Essentially, when I go to a YT page, I am looking for two things: 1) Playlists of Current and popular previous series. These are very useful. 2) The list of recent videos. Other things I personally find unnecessary, but I don't really mind it if other people like displaying the other playlists on the front. I like your idea of Current Series and Iconic Series. Also, a nice thing, but I'm not sure how to fit this in, would be to have some sort of playlist of playlists. What I mean by this is something that puts all of Kim's minecraft stuff together, or all of her stuff with Duncan together, etc. Just an idea. I'll edit if I think of more stuff, but overall, I would just like to say, thanks for doing an amazing job. You're awesome!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,re3ja,0,Fri Feb 20 03:17:07 2015 UTC,"I find your Daily Videos on Youtube, It is the first place I check and if nothing is there I goto the Yogscast.com and look. For some reason even though i subscribed, My Email doesn't get your post notifications. The Endslates are actually great, even though i have watched everything on a Youtube binge and seen the stuff suggested in the panel. 3.For the Next button annotation, I never really pressed it, it always is at the very beginning of the video, and i would find it more useful at the End. The Previous button I never press. I always look below for links, Video Description. 4.I love your Minecraft series, and i hope you continue, but I also really enjoy the other games you play, Horror, since I can't due it myself, and maybe try out some RPG's (not everyone may agree, but I think you would have a ton of good responses) 5.Well based on a previous answer, yes I watch it all, But Sometimes it is hard to find the right video when it switches back and forth between Duncan's and your page, I understand that they are your guys videos, and take equal claim but maybe you guys could put up tags to other videos on your YT channel so 'youtubers' can find the right episode easier.  Besides that the current set up is great.   Extra Extra, Your shows are very interesting and I think your posts are great, when you brought up the Chinese new years games and you went off explaining the culture behind it, I like that style of play, I wouldn't mind watching you explain more of Chinese holidays, it is a very interesting subject and your a very easy person to listen too.   :) have a great Night/Day thing"

Your great :3"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Supertoastfairy,0,Fri Feb 20 12:12:58 2015 UTC,"I generally get new videos from the ‘my subscriptions’ bit of YT, any other videos like the BAFTA stuff I tend to spot on Twitter. As someone’s already mentioned, I think it’s nice to have an endslate rather than the video abruptly ending. But I never click them (annotations off). I think links for the next/previous episode are very useful, especially if the LP is being split between different channels, ideally these would be in the video description. I think you have a really good balance of content. I really enjoy the short, story driven games that you do such as Valiant Hearts & The Last Door because (imo) you’re quite an emotional, intelligent and expressive player and it’s good to hear someone connect with the game they’re playing and have fun with it then just purely watching gameplay footage. Main page I don’t tend to use a lot. I am forever looking at your playlists (lists are good!) to find something I may have missed.   Thanks for being a lot better than The One Show when I get home from work! :)"

I don't really use other navigation links or playlists since i have pretty much been subbed to you from the start. The endslates are good though, I use them to watch a video that I missed or to read your tweets. I would love it if you could do some more building with duncan in the future and actually get involved in the builds. I know you may think that you are a bad builder, but let me tell you something... you are not. You still is creative and funky, something I rarely see on youtube.

yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Slidejaw,0,Fri Feb 20 17:59:28 2015 UTC,"1) Subscription.  2) Endslates are somehow appreciated but I barely ever use/click them.  3) I look for links/videos in: mostly the channel itself (if not in recent subscription feed) or annotaion/endslates/playlist/up next (at the right side) and sometimes in the description if something interesting gets mentioned to be found there.  4) Less Minecraft is always good in my opinion! Multiplayer stuff is usually the most entertaining. Fright Night probably the series of yours which I mainly follow.  5) I rarely look at the main YT page. I usually go directly to the ""videos"" tab because I am looking for something from a few days ago which I wanted to check out but didn't have the time. Since I usually (with exceptions) follow recent stuff and do not (re-)watch older stuff I tend to not care about how many playlists etc are listed there. Also those people who have a video playing on ther main YT page are annoying and one of the reasons I do not look there or jump directly to the videos tab. Thankfully that is not the case with you. Hatfilms are probably a good example to or orientate to."

Something for everyone.  5) I hardly go on main pages unless its a channel I'm new to. But I like it when things can fit into playlists nicely.  Just wanted to say I think you're a great youtuber and you're definitely one of my favourite yogscast members. Keep on being amazing Kim!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,nattheaverage,0,Sat Feb 21 14:45:22 2015 UTC,I think you should do more game reviews again!
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,MoltenAqua,0,Sat Feb 21 19:30:50 2015 UTC,"I find them trough your channel since im subbed. Im a mobile user so i dont click and often skip them. I find the episodes trough your youtube playlists. All your minecraft series i love, i do think you have enough minecraft series going on though, so i would reccomend when doing new stuff its non minecraft content. Your YT layout seems fine to me, i use it to find all your videos and i dont have any issues finding them.   As a non twitter user i have no problems finding content, so thumbs up from me."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Whitelisters,0,Sat Feb 21 21:24:02 2015 UTC,"1) I find you through subscription notices  2) I can't click things on mobile app 3) Links to previous episodes would be awesome, and speed things up for people coming to the series late, in the description box below, again for the mobile users.  4) love the balance between minecraft and other games; with so much minecraft everywhere it's nice for a breather. Some more fright night would be fantastic, either solo or with the lovely hannah, and the NanoBytes series looks to be something great!  5) I'm constantly on your playlists looking for something I haven't seen/old videos that I'd like to watch again. I think the layout is fine as it is, easy to find what you're looking for. Some people (myself included) try to watch series like your minecraft ones in order, and removing the playlists might make that harder to do."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,ShikadiLord,0,Sat Feb 21 23:01:35 2015 UTC,I think a good thing to do would be to have more local multiplayer games with other Yogscast members. I enjoyed Never Alone with you and Nathan and I think that would improve the channel hugely.
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,NinjaCat429,0,Sat Feb 21 23:10:37 2015 UTC,"1) Almost always  through the subscription box. I tend to check out your channel once a day to see if I missed anything anyway, though. 2) They're only useful when I watch a series I haven't watched before, but that's not really the case with your vids! 3) I usually check the description for the playlist. 4) I like the vids where you aren't too focused on the game all the time, like in Minecraft. I like the conversations about movies and Ash being an asshole, while still making progress towards your goals 5) You may have a little many playlists on your homepage. If people  are looking for a playlist they usually press the playlists button, or watch a video and check the description.   Some more collaborations would be awesome, I really like Cornerstone and the Mario Kart vids."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Thasdron,0,Sat Feb 21 23:32:34 2015 UTC,"1) My subscriptions page. I've heard it's particularly unreliable for a lot of people, but I haven't missed any videos I'm interested in thus far. Probably. However, if I'm multiple days behind I go directly to the channel and check the full list of videos instead.  2) I think they are much more preferable to videos ending in abrupt silence, and occasionally I check out new series or stuff I forgot about by clicking on the endslate links.  3) I pretty much always rely on playlists for these, except, of course when I'm caught up. I keep an eye on the episode number to make sure the playlist isn't missing entries (which has happened to me but I don't remember if it's been with playlists from your channel or Duncan's or someone else's etc.), otherwise I use the endslate or video description (in that order) to get to the next episode.  4) I think it's pretty balanced.  5) I check the main page... pretty much never? Sorry! :( If I'm looking for older videos/series to start watching/catch up with I go directly to the playlists page. This goes for the other Yogscast channels as well.  As for how I usually watch videos, it really depends on how much time I have, and whether it's a single video or a longer series. In the first case, I'll usually watch it ""immediately"" (i.e. late at night) or on the next day. If it's a new series I may postpone watching it entirely for a few days and binge later, but then I risk forgetting entirely about it (mostly depending on what is keeping me busy) -- and that's where the endslatesand reddit come in handy!  EDIT: Bleh linebreaks."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,punkmetalshark,0,Sun Feb 22 00:00:55 2015 UTC,"1) I find your videos by scrolling through my youtub subscriptions and seeing new videos. I also find most of your videos to be very entertaining :D 2) I think the links are very useful, in case anybody doesn't know where to go.  3) I usually rely on video description links and such. 4) I really like all of the videos on your channel, mainly Flux Buddies. I also loved watching Alien Isolation. 5) I personally find it easy to locate playlists and such on pages.  I also wanted to include that out of all of the Yogscast members I've subscribed to on Youtube, or even out of any person I've subscribed, you're probably my favorite Youtuber. Not only because I love the content and series that are on your channel, mostly because my laptop won't allow me to do modded minecraft personally, but also because you're so knowledgable in so many different things. I've taken two years of Chinese for language, which I really enjoyed, and I'm thinking of a career in music, (I play the alto saxophone and the piano) and I find all of the things you talk about in your commentary and your vlogs really interesting.  Keep up all of your awesome work Kim! :D"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,majorhell14,0,Sun Feb 22 01:56:48 2015 UTC,"1) I usually go on the yt page everyday 2) I like them, but usually i have already watched it already 3) I mostly go on playlist, so i dont really mind if you have links to previous or next episodes 4) I like around 1-2 series of minecraft, but mostly other games 5) I would like introvideo at the page, talking about ur channel, then the newest vids, followed by long series."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,jonsp1170,0,Sun Feb 22 08:21:44 2015 UTC,I think you should play I am bread for the nanobytes series
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,AWildTorinAppears,0,Sun Feb 22 10:51:34 2015 UTC,"1) I think that your videos are great especially the Flux Buddies series and I have already subscribed and I follow your twitter :D 2) I see and click on most end slates. 3) I love your long play series and I always click the ""next ep"" annotation sometimes I will look for certain links in the description. 4) I think that you should create a series similar to Nano's village but for members of the public, choose one at random and ask them to build something in the village I also love your Minecraft series with Duncan and Nano's village and the balance between videos is good. 5) I think your navigation is just perfect I usually take a look at the playlists and I think it is just the right amount.  Other: I think that my idea from above, the public Nano's village series would be a good idea and I know there can be some issues with that and I understand that.  During a video you could put a annotation (maybe with a picture etc.) saying ""If you are enjoying this video why not like and subscribe :D"""
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,paleorange,0,Sun Feb 22 11:28:37 2015 UTC,"1-New Daily Video: Subscription.  2-Endslates: See them, enjoy the music, rarely if ever click on them.  3-Long Play Series: I usually just use the ""Up Next"" link in the right-hand column to go to the next video. Previous episode links would be wonderful (I sometimes forget to like vids, and so of course I have to go back through all of them and make sure you got your well-deserved thumbs up :-). Previous/Next links in the video description would be very nice. I sometimes go long stretches between chances to watch your videos, so I often have to hunt around to find where I left off in the series.  4-Content: I love your horror games, your indie games ... actually, pretty much everything you do other than Minecraft. I don't hate Minecraft, but my interest in watching people play it wore out a long time ago. When I watch you or the other Yogs' Minecraft vids, I watch for the enjoyment of listening to you guys interacting, not for the game. It's unfortunate, because I'm guessing Minecraft is probably still your most popular content. Personally though, I'd love to see you do more horror games, indie games, games like ""Life is Strange,"" and similar. I particularly enjoy when you play obscure or less well-publicized games. I watch your vids mainly for the entertainment of your commentary, but you also often bring cool games to my attention that I've never heard of before. I also really enjoy seeing you work with Hannah, Simon, Duncan, and other guests (loved Siren: Blood Curse with Ashens; those videos actually introduced me to his channel). I seem to remember you commenting in a vlog one time that you think your commentary is better when you have someone to play off of, but I think that's true of all the Yogs. You guys are all are great by yourselves, but you're even more entertaining when you have a partner or two in crime. Sort of a Laurel and Hardy, Abbot and Costello, Three Stooges kind of dynamic, I guess. (Don't worry, you're Moe. Definitely Moe. :-)  5-Navigation: I do use your main YT page, often, to hunt up video series I was watching and want to pick back up, or just to look for random, interesting things to watch. But yeah, I think you're right: it's looking a bit cluttered. The only real suggestions I can give are the ""categories"" I look for when I go to your channel: Horror Games (first, foremost, always :-), Indie/Small/Obscure Games, and your RL content (like Ask Kim!, your Top 5 Games of the Year specials, etc.).  Other Feedback: A final note on content--just keep doing what you love. Minecraft, horror games, RL sketches, doesn't matter. Do what you think you'll enjoy, do what you think will be fun, do what intrigues or interests or inspires you. Just play, and keep bringing us along to play with you. We'll have fun. Promise. :-)"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,cadet33,0,Sun Feb 22 13:01:35 2015 UTC,"Either Inbox, seeing it on my feed, or when Sean posts it to the Facebook page.   2.While i don't really use the end slates as i've got caught up on everything anyway, its good to see whats coming soon and to many go right to another video.  3.i tend to look in the description but if its on screen i will use that.  4.i think you and Duncan should do more adventure maps or maybe you and Simon have a crack at some jumping puzzles?   i like the main page it means i can just find a top playlist and watch it without searching."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Dresdenfalls,0,Sun Feb 22 13:36:55 2015 UTC,"1) NEW DAILY VIDEO. Check YT most days so see your videos in the subs list.  2) ENDSLATES. I rarely click on them as i've either seen the video referenced or they don't feel relevant to me.  3) LONG PLAY SERIES. Never click on next episode annotations because I nearly always watch a video before the next episode is out.  4) CONTENT. I tend to watch more of your Minecraft stuff but you seem to have a nice mix of game genres. Obviously it is difficult not to end up playing the same games as other youtubers but i'd prefer you play the games that appeal to you as if you enjoy the game then it will come across in the end product and the end video will be more appealing. Kimpressions is a bit different from lets plays as you are playing to give your opinion and occasionally you'll probably try something you enjoy less.  5) NAVIGATION. As before, I find your videos on my subs page (assuming it is working) so I rarely look beyond there. A quick look at the 'Home' page shows quite a lot of info. If I were new to your channel i'd probably struggle to understand where I should start, so yes, simplification may well help there. I'd not looked at Hat Films 'Home' page either before now, there seems like an awful lot there to me as well, so perhaps filter the key information at the top and beyond that include things you are proud of and/or is popular.  ANY OTHER FEEDBACK... If you ever did that American Road Trip I don't think i'd be alone in loving to see you vlog that (I'd try not to be too jealous) but I appreciate that if you did manage to do such a trip you'd probably want to relax and enjoy it rather than feel pressure to produce content. Not sure what to add other than say thank you for the work you do for the content you provide. It is your endearing personality that keeps me coming back. Make sure you schedule in time to relax though."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,yamichip,0,Sun Feb 22 14:20:36 2015 UTC,It would be really nice to see more new console games like; The Order 1866 (I know Hannah is playing that.) The one thing I don't like is when I see videos recycled from live streams. But I do really like your channel still.
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,kaze_7,0,Sun Feb 22 16:25:25 2015 UTC,"Generally via browsing for next thing to watch, if I am into a long playthrough I keep more eye on the channel than normal.  Endslates - good channel art with good music. It adds a value to the video. If it takes too long or too fiddly - evolve it. Have a fan art ends late with a ""thanks for watching"" sign.  Long play throughs - playlists are good to use with me going through the classics. Fright night etc.  annotations/links I don't normally use.  Content - similar to the critism that sips got. Having a balanced channel is always better but you see the numbers per vid.    So a balance between the multiplayer/ long play throughs / one off videos (and vlogs)   Navigation    It's about where the channel is going. If 8 rows of playlists feels too much - it might be. Organisation of the rows though is great - I can search through the sections of videos and can find stuff to watch easily.   Overall - a good niche channel on the dial of the yogscast network. While hat films and sips cater to a different more adult audience, yours, Zoeys and Martyn's channels balance out the network with more family friendly content.  It's all about where you want to take this. Good luck."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Mancombs,0,Sun Feb 22 16:41:53 2015 UTC,"1) Always through subscription page. I'm on youtube every day checking my subs. I think I may be an outlier in that area.  2) I never or very rarely click on links in the end plate, but I still like when youtubers use them? They're not useful for me but they're still somehow comforting and more professional looking.    3) When back watching a long series I always use the playlists, and I search channels' playlists when I'm bored for ""new"" series to watch. So I always appreciate more of those with well organized videos.  4) Love the minecraft stuff. I'd love to see more longer Fright Night series, like Outlast, but really any Fright Night always makes me happy. Longer series in general, I feel like most of your series are one or two offs, except for flux buddies. I'd enjoy seeing more long term series where you get more invested.  The only specific game I'd enjoy seeing you play is the demo of Stairs that Hannah just released, because she wimped out and I want to see you do it.  5) I don't pay any attention to the main youtube page. When I go to it I'm either clicking videos or playlist and that's all I'm aware of. I just went to it for the sake of this question and I agree it's a bit much, far too many subcategories that seem irrelevant. Maybe just three or four lists. But then take my opinion on that with a grain of salt because I do not use the main page at all."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,NiteLite,0,Mon Feb 23 07:36:47 2015 UTC,"1) sub box normally, sometimes twitter (for the videos that aren't flux buddies) 2) normally watching through mobile so i don't click them 3) if i'm watching a long play series, i normally do use annotations because i'm on my laptop. they're useful for watching a whole series in a day. 4) more horror games plz :D i also liked your chinese new year flash games video, you should do more flash games like nilesy! 5) you should have an 'iconic series' playlist for people who've just started watching and don't know where to begin. it would have been useful for me when i started watching your content!"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,WulfTheSaxon,0,Mon Feb 23 13:32:36 2015 UTC,"YT is my idle time spender of choice because videos are generally from 10 to 30 minutes, so they are great for mid work/cig breaks, waiting for rendering, installs, downloads, uploads, set ups and people who show up late. In that regards:  1) I have 2 main YT channel groups first one is the main which is my sub box and second is my catch up list and secondary list that are in a really organized bookmark folder.  2) I used find them useful when i was starting up on some channels, i think they are great for binge watchers that are new to a channel or people who watch only on weekends or specific times of the week.  3)I think all of those help out, because sometimes you don't watch something to the end but still want to watch the next one, so playlists and links in the VD are great for that but endslates are good for peeps that watch the video all the way though. I personally find annotations a little bit annoying mid-video because im easily distracted and also i have a sort of Pavlovian conditioning that when annotations come up is because the episode is about to end so i check the bar to see how long has it been and i miss a bit of what's happening.  4)Im not a fan of most of the horror stuff but that's a personal thing as most people like it, i find most of that genre a little bit boring. Generally i watch the channel, as i think most of people that watch commentators do, for the personality of the guy/gal that is playing. So content is important but is half of the reason i watch it.   5)I can't say that i use it at all but i saw it and it looked very neat and organized without too much stuff in it (FE i dont like the ""best videos"" or ""worth a watch"" sections of HF one, i prefer just recent and a list of the latest/popular playlists)  FB: Just have fun with it like you always do, feel free to try new things without thinking if people will like it, just come up with stuff that would be fun for you to do and do it, if it doesn't work, meh at least you had fun doing it and like i said before, most of us would watch it anyways because of how much fun and interesting you are to hear."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Ethan_Callighan,0,Tue Feb 24 18:25:46 2015 UTC,"1) NEW DAILY VIDEO. I check my Subscriptions feed page after getting home from work.   2) ENDSLATES. Never really pay much attention to them to be honest.  3) LONG PLAY SERIES. Since I watch the subscriptions more or less every day I tend to not really look for links to prev/next (seeing as I have already seen the previous and the next isn't out yet). I very seldom watch an episode more than once, unless a specific Reddit thread is commenting something in that episode or similar.  4) CONTENT. I like the balance, but I really do enjoy the Minecraft content the most. Flux Buddies 2.0 is looking very interesting. Always cool to see you guys try out new mods or new versions of old mods.   5) NAVIGATION. Since I tend to watch everything as it comes out, I seldom check out a channels ""frontpage"". It might be nice for all the new viewers that want to catch up on series that are always running though. Maybe focus it on stuff that you are proud of, series that do well on YouTube and what ever series is active right now?"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,maybe_I_am_a_bot,0,Tue Feb 24 18:40:43 2015 UTC,"1) I always see new videos by checking my YouTube subscriptions (uploads only) page. I’ve never had any issues with videos not showing up there.  2) Endslates are nice, but I usually don’t click on the links.  3) This goes for Yogscast videos in general: If I’m getting caught up, I usually click on the next episode link in the video description (although I’ve noticed they frequently don’t get updated until long after the next video is up, if ever). Previous episode links are especially handy for between series in the same continuum (e.g. Galacticraft → Flux Buddies → Flux Buddies 2.0).  4) Moar GeoGuessr with Hannah plzkthx. Other than that, I pretty much only watch your Minecraft videos.  5) I never look at YouTube channel pages.  P.S. Thanks for all the great videos!  :)"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Hren76,0,Tue Feb 24 19:26:12 2015 UTC,"1) I find these through the youtube subscriptions list, the sub-reddit (love you guys) and occasionally twitter.  2) Not sure what they are so obviously not very useful to me.  3) I love the long series' they're things I can bulk watch at the end of the week and it means we can make suggestions.  4) I'm happy with all the content at the moment. Love the minecraft loads but maybe try stuff with other then just Duncan, you could do some adventure maps or other game play with other yogs. Finally Nanos Village needs to come back, it was one of my favorite things to watch.  5) I don't notice the page much, the Hat films layout is good but honestly probably not worth the effort yours is fine how it is I like being able to check the playlists if I'm board to see if there's a series I haven't seen.  Hope that helps :)"
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,araoblia,0,Tue Feb 24 19:36:17 2015 UTC,"1) Checking you channel every now and then, I'm subscribed but I'm subscribed to a lot of things.  2) They're okay, but in a series a long outro can interfere with watching.  3) I sometimes click on the annotations for the next ep, but prefer just using a playlist.   4) I absolutely loved the Yawgh series, more content with other yogs would be cool. I also enjoyed the DotA video you did with Pyrion, was absolutely hilarious.  5) Not sure what you can do about it, but If I go to the playlist tab, its usually to find a playlist for flux buddies, and its hidden in the middle of all the other playlists right now. If you want to clean it up maybe try something like flux buddies/other minecraft/horror/other games"

yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Leigina,0,Thu Feb 26 19:29:53 2015 UTC,"1) Subscription notices 2) See them, rarely click them though 3) Annotations for next and previous ep links are amazing. I check those first, if there are none I check the description for the links. If there are none it depends on how good I thought the series was - if it was worth watching I'll search on Youtube or on your channel, if it wasn't (which rarely happens by the way) I just can't be bothered. 4) The balance is just perfect, I think, although I'd like to see another non-minecraft-series on your channel, looking forward especially to Life is Strange currently. 5) Since I rarely check your main YT page, I can't really give feedback on that other than that it might be a bit overwhelming when seeing your channel for the very first time. Since I've watched pretty much all your videos, I usually know what I'm looking for and instantly click on the playlist button.  Other than that, I can only say what I've felt on any of the Yogs' videos, especially about the description: It is really information packed and takes a while to understand where what is, which part changes and which part is just copied every time. I personally would really appreciate a link or at least the name of texture pack and modpack used in a minecraft video. Other than that, not really much more to whine about. Great content mostly, pretty enjoyable and (especially) interesting on a level I'm not used to from most YouTubers, especially let's-players. Thanks for the work you put in."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Safire224,0,Fri Feb 27 21:18:22 2015 UTC,"Suggestion for Flux Buddies: Above all of the pipes and the above part on the wall to the right of that should be open or have windows like in the first episode.  Love your channel and Flux Buddies is becoming my new favourite series, that is all."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,Leothefox,0,Mon Mar 2 02:16:08 2015 UTC,"I would love it if you could do more vlogs, I just think that it's nice to hear about you sometimes and have a change from minecraft and horror games (I still love watching them). It would also be good if you could do more videos with other members of the yogscast like sips or hat films."
yogscastkim,2wfxrl,rasmus87,0,Mon Mar 2 04:55:58 2015 UTC,"Hi Kim!  1) I find them through the subscription feed on youtube or on twitter. 2) I see them most of the time, but I tend to click on the links in the description box instead (for some reason). 3)I click on annotations for next episode, again - in the description box most of the time. Previous episode is also useful in my opinion. If I keep up with the series I watch the episodes as they come out and I see them in my subscription feed. If I get a little behind on the series, I will usually find the playlist and watch the playlist. If I rematch a series (which happens sometimes) I will most definitely watch the playlist on your channel.  4) I have to say I like the mix of long series and short series/single videos that are on your channel. It's a nice mix. I love the new Nanobytes series and Fright Night is a clear favorite! I like Minecraft as well and I think the balance is good between minecraft and other stuff.  5) I have honestly never thought about this. I have never had troubles finding what I want and as you maybe could understand from what I have already written - I like those playlists, so I would love it if you kept them. :)"

Is it going to be mine? Is it going to my friend's?""  And then the art shows up, and no matter what I'm like, ""Ah cool,"" and that's that :p  Also Teutron's outro art is so cute, my god.

yogscastkim,2wg74b,Aeverelle,6,Thu Feb 19 21:04:22 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, you got the Whitestone from Random Things this early! So lucky. The Whitestone can be charged to provide you with regeneration and other helpful effects instead of dying during a fight, and it can also be upgraded to a Bloodstone for permanent regeneration! You really should charge it up and keep it handy for fighting particularly tough mobs (like the Twilight Forest bosses) later on.  (Mild spoilers for this modpack follow.)  To charge the Whitestone you just need to stand outside at night with it in your hand during a full moon and wait until the moon reaches its highest point -- then you'll know it's charging up because it'll emit particles. To upgrade it to a Bloodstone you just toss it on the ground during a Blood Moon night and wait for it to transform after a few seconds, but then you'll need to charge it again by killing a number of hostile mobs to improve its regeneration effect. Once fully charged, it makes it really hard for mobs to kill you unless they are normally able to in one shot. Of course, to use either form of this item you must carry it around in your personal inventory.  The Random Things wiki has more details on both items: Whitestone, Bloodstone.  I would really recommend waiting until you have better gear (especially armor) before going outside during a Blood Moon, though.  Hope this helps!"

Getting the parts for grout is no big deal when getting other resources, see clay get clay etc. So by the start of one bulk they might have enough to make a single layer, or find a village with an incomplete one like on Cornerstone and have it be made off camera so we don't have to see the same thing over again.  Thankfully Iguana Tweaks isn't installed, that would have made for an interesting first few sessions as they tried to get a tool strong enough to get the most basics of ores."
yogscastkim,2vzijj,Ginger_Tea,4,Sun Feb 15 23:12:26 2015 UTC,I think they went for the crucible because it's the way to make brass using Flaxbeard's steam mod and that was the mod for the jet-packs that needed the brass. I'm sure they will eventually go into Tinker's again.

The minds eye for those who experienced the trailer said it was the scariest thing they had 'seen'.  My mum used to watch Soaps on TV and Archers on the radio, I would sometimes catch an episode and the sound design always alerted you to where you were, when you cant see that you are in a kitchen, the background noise that is never really present on TV comes to the front and you can hear a chopping board being used and taps running."

yogscastkim,2vsask,CoreDuo08,2,Fri Feb 13 20:58:36 2015 UTC,"Dot crawl:       Dot crawl is the popular name for a visual defect of color analog video standards when signals are transmitted as composite video, as in terrestrial broadcast television. It consists of animated checkerboard patterns which appear along horizontal color transitions (vertical edges). It results from intermodulation or crosstalk between chrominance and luminance components of the signal, which are imperfectly multiplexed in the frequency domain.  This takes two forms: chroma interference in luma (chroma being interpreted as luma), and luma interference in chroma.  Dot crawl is most visible when the chrominance is transmitted with a high bandwidth, so that its spectrum reaches well into the band of frequencies used by the luminance signal in the composite video signal. This causes high-frequency chrominance detail at color transitions to be interpreted as luminance detail.    Image i - Enlarged detail from a video source exhibiting dot crawl. Note the distinctive checkerboard pattern on the vertical edges between yellow and blue areas.

The US versions are also really good, but Ring 2 in particular goes in a somewhat different direction - they're pretty much different stories based on the same idea though, and well worth watching.   The Grudge and Dark Water were US versions of japanese films I think. The Grudge was really creepy (thanks are due to Hannah for bringing that all back to me a while ago when she randomly starting making that horrible croaking sound that the ghost/creature makes in the film in one of the Fright Night videos!). Dark Water was OK but I didn't find it particularly memorable.   If you're looking for good horror movies in general (not just eastern ones)  then I'd recommend Below. It's a ghost story set on a WWII submarine, and it's really good!"
yogscastkim,2vo65z,Barnabus_Bot,2,Thu Feb 12 17:37:06 2015 UTC,"I have a theory regarding the group. So far we've been introduced to Devitt, Anthony, and Alexandre. We haven't seen who the 4th person was. My theory is that Kaufman is the 4th one. Think about it. He seems to be familiar with what's happening to a certain degree. Not much was shown after Anthony and co. opened the original portal while they were in school. Devitt apparently doesn't remember much about what happened, and Anthony and Alexandre  tried to see if they could open the door again. What if they had apporached Kaufman about participating? At first, he was all about doing it. After a while, though, he decided that this was a bad idea, so he jumped ship and fled. Also, I think the shadowy figure was him as well. I think the picture was taken around the time he was wising up to what happened, and he didn't really want himself in the picture because he didn't want to be reminded of his involvement. When he heard about Devitt, he recognized the name, and decided to look up some references about what happened to him and his old school friends. When he found out Anthony and Alexandre were still trying to open the door, he realized that they risked pulling Devitt in with them, and he wants to save him so he can spare him from the madness of their old friends. That's my theory on the whole thing."

Hannah and Nilesy have now exposed themselves to the flux through their own messy ventures into Thaumcraft at the Evicted Garrison. How long before they start showing symptoms?   TLDR: What if Season 2 isn't Kim losing control due to her affliction but actually involves the student becoming the master?"
yogscastkim,2vjbrm,AlloyMorph,3,Wed Feb 11 15:32:53 2015 UTC,But did they Dive feet first into a glass ball of flux then get locked away in a skruby tower?

yogscastkim,2vjbrm,AlloyMorph,2,Wed Feb 11 17:09:59 2015 UTC,Oh he's realised: in E11 of Owl Island Nilesy has to explain to Hannah why there's a Wisp flying in the treeline and why they're bad news.

I love the character development, storylines, and the series as a whole. The intense focus on revenge that slowly eased off by having Zoey around, refueled by her near loss due to Duncan's actions was interesting. When the Flux infected Kim and Duncan set out to find a cure, I always thought it would be interesting to see Duncan turn to Rythian for help.   After what happened to Zoey and Duncan not listening to Rythian about playing with magic and science; having him turn to Rythian for help would be a great story line. Still not ready to forgive Duncan, but not wanting Kim to suffer as Zoey did, would decide to help out.   That's my headcanon, so seeing art like this really speaks to me. Thanks for posting!"

Looking forward to seeing the new Flux Buddies on Tuesday (and Kim's skin, oh my good god).  If I were someone to cry easily, I would have. Especially the montage was heartwrenching. Thanks Colin!"

They stuck together Like sister and brother.  They stuck together, Fought like lions... But all that remains now is Silence...  They cursed them, stabbed them, Launched the nukes And dodged there blows With mad jukes.  The Hats were mad, They came with violence. But all they were left with was (a burning irradiated crater and) Silence...  As the nukes flew The battle raged. Rockets, rapiers, turret shells And sh*t bullets rampaged.  But as the battle went on, They let go of the science. The Deadly Flux Witch came bringing destruction and Silence  When she raised the dead, They hid with a scream As Duncan laid back and watched Drinking coffee with cream  boom  And as the nukes landed Twas the end of the tyrants...

yogscastkim,2v7jcy,aceofheart1e55,1 point,Wed Feb 11 10:27:26 2015 UTC,"That was one of the best series ends i have seen from the yogscast.  Kim and Duncan definitely won that war. Flux buddies= zero deaths (well 1 for Kim being Death). Hat Films= tons of Death.  you know, i think it was the close calls that took out the poppets.  also must have confused them when they attacked you and got damage themselves.  And now that it is over........there is only one thing to do.........go back to the very beginning, when Kim fell in Duncan's Fountain, and watch again until Flux Buddies return in a whole new adventure."

yogscastkim,2v7jcy,VegetaLF7,1 point,Mon Feb 9 07:47:39 2015 UTC,"Check out the apprentice series first. It started back on the older server, the one with the Jaffa Factory and Duncan's castle. Part of it was covered in the 2013 Christmas livestreams with Duncan, Kim, and Simon going on a fishing holiday. It then progressed to the Galacticraft series and finally moved to the Flux Buddies series after a while. So far they have had three main bases in their apprenticeship. Duncan's Castle, New Camelot, and Panda Labs"
yogscastkim,2v7jcy,cheeselord99,1 point,Mon Feb 9 17:55:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I watched the apprentice series and really enjoyed it, but lost touch with the series over the course of galacticraft. I started watching again early on in flux buddies."

It's funny, it doesn't matter if it's a YouTube series or a TV series - if it's quality, when it ends it always has this effect. This ending has cemented Flux Buddies as my all-time favourite complete YouTube series, and my second favourite YouTube series in general - the legendary SOI still holds that title.  Now that the series is over, and I'm suffering from withdrawal already, I think we should speculate what the next series could possible entail for our duo. Any thoughts, guys?"
yogscastkim,2v7jvx,HunterDarkwolf,2,Sun Feb 8 19:00:25 2015 UTC,I'll be honest. I teared up a bit when they did the flash back at the end. It was a wonderful series. Do hope they do a playlist with all the episodes in order.

Always open to suggestions though. Maybe we all might have a game or two in common on steam?   I know it isn't exactly recent but L4D/L4D2 could always be an option or a game that can handle many people.

yogscastkim,2uw7zj,Mancombs,1 point,Fri Feb 6 04:10:20 2015 UTC,"So I watched Hat Film's war prep as well and I will be astonished if the Flux Buddies lose this war. Yes they have a manufacturing line that allows them never ending nukes but the process is very slow, they've got a rail gun but it's a single block that's simple to break. Other than that they've got the stolen TC equipment which is alright and some fairly basic tech. Flux Buddies have far more nukes and if they build a simple cobble generator they can have a lot more, their swords are much stronger than HF Atomic Disassemblers, and they have the edge in magic with Kim's Witchery. In every way that I can imagine this war going down the hat boys lose. That having been said however I predict a draw. Hat Films and Flux Buddies will destroy everything including each other, in a similar fashion to the Sjin VS Duncan war in the old Tekkit with Duncan series."

Off the top of my head, Muse will always be my jam, as well as System of a Down and earlier Marilyn Manson (his recent stuff is SO DULL). I'm probably a bit more into punk and pop punk now - really loving New Found Glory's latest album, and Against Me, Four Year Strong, that sorta thing. Um, Bring me the Horizon for the heavier stuff...oh, and I'm having a teenage revival at the moment, so endlessly cycling through Alien Ant Farm, Sum 41, Blink 182, Green Day, Wheatus, Sugarcult, zebrahead, Less Than Jake, Reel Big Fish, The Used, My Chemical Romance, Box Car Racer, Finch, Thrice... Also a real sucker for Queen, AC/DC, Metallica, Guns N Roses, the Darkness, The Clash, The Ramones, the Beatles, Journey, Motley Crue, the Cure... And I have a weird fascination with Nicki Minaj. She terrifies me, but entertains me at the same time. Regina Spector will always been my pop queen though. Oh, did someone say SE Asian pop? I LOVE IT, especially Mandarin singing bands, as I miss the language. So, Jay Chou, Pamyu Pamyu, Girl's Generation, Baby Metal, 2NE1, World Order... Game soundtracks are good when I'm trying to edit or work and need something without words.

Nice game so far, im enjoying it.

Everyone has been working very hard setting up things and I'm sure a little fun would be a welcome relief and great to watch. Knowing all you Yogscasters FUN means a little friendly competition!!  You could propose three contests, each with a winner and a loser. Each member starts off with two votes each, winners gain one vote, while losers lose a vote.  When done the votes ( signed by voter notebooks) are used to cast votes on their choice of a Winner ""Cornerstone of the Community"" and or a loser, by placing the votes in their choice of two hoppers connected to chests. The winner could become next weeks Mayor or get something cool, and the loser gets taken far away, is forced to sleep in a bed which is then covered in obsidian (leave head corners bare to spawn) and left empty handed to find their way home. If they die on their journey before they make it back to base to reset their spawn... Back they go!  Everyone starts with no armor or anything in inventory. (Make em jump off slime island to their deaths and not break graves to be sure!! :) Contests.   An archery contest, chiseled stone blocks make great targets.                  A ""mystery object"" speed crafting competition. starting with just a chest with some material. (Who can craft and place a torch first!)                 And of course, a carrot-on-a-stick pig obstacle course race!!  You could set each team out to make the areas for each contest. In case of ties you could set up a nerd pole archery duel area of about 35 blocks apart with lava surrounding the base of the poles and a viewing stand for everyone else to watch.  Love watching you and all the gang!!"

yogscastkim,2ufdno,Hpfm2,3,Sun Feb 1 23:26:32 2015 UTC,"Kim, you missed a trick with Witchery.  You need to make a Polynesia charm, which allows you to trade with certain animals like they're a villager for potion ingredients.  Trading with a Dog/Wolf gives you Dog's Tongue, Owl gives you Owl Wings and Toad gives you Toes.  Also, the Death set doesn't use a pants slot because the mod intends for you to equip one of the Witchery Belts... or pull a Hannah and get a Force Kilt for flying.  If you get a chance, try another potion of invisibility while the robes are equipped.  They should become invisible as well."

yogscastkim,2uc2g2,Keneshiro,4,Sun Feb 1 12:19:02 2015 UTC,"Witchery is quite a well balanced mod when it comes down to it's PVP elements. Every method has it's downsides and ways to escape it. Death's advantage is fighting groups of players in close quarters, but if players spread out and force him to focus on one target, it's quite hard for him to deal with you.  That said, though, Death plays a lot like a Tank/Utility character, best suited to disabling and debuffing your foes whilst other DPS characters deal with them. Duncan's Rapier would make short work of the Slowed and Hunger-Drained Hats."
yogscastkim,2uc2g2,RGPFerrous,1 point,Sun Feb 1 13:07:58 2015 UTC,"Wow. Did not realize that it was so balanced. However, the whole capture the spectres etc feels not well thought out"

yogscastkim,2uc2g2,Not_rhy,4,Sat Jan 31 23:03:11 2015 UTC,"The scythe drains YOUR OWN hunger, but causes damage inversely scaling based on your hunger. So, the lower your own hunger gets, the more damage you inflict. The damage will also restore your hunger at inverse proportions, as well as inflicting Chill Touch, which deals 15% Max HP and ignores armor.  Long story short, you want to go into battle with low hunger (or switch into your scythe as your hunger drops). Your Scythe will AOE in a cone, dealing huge damage and restoring your hunger, allowing you ""heal by proxy"". Overall, a great weapon to use when you're in an extended fight."

Hopefully Kim talks to some more people when she walks back through there. Interesting to see others choosing to tell the principal instead of hide the truth. I hid the truth just because I didn't want to get in trouble, and didn't want to have an unstable, gun-wielding man pissed off at me."
yogscastkim,2ubl9m,virgash,2,Sat Jan 31 23:14:00 2015 UTC,"See, the thing is I would have liked her to see what Hide truth means. I think one of the amazing things about this game is that it completely eliminates the ""I wonder what would have happened if I had chosen the other one"" you often get in choice games, cause you can just check what happens, and then TIME REVERSE! to the one you want. It's pretty cool. So I'd advise people to try out all the choices instead of just one."
yogscastkim,2ubl9m,Hpfm2,2,Sun Feb 1 17:05:55 2015 UTC,"I think the best thing still is that some choices remain hard to make, even if you've tried both options out and weighed out the consequences. Sometimes, neither situation is ideal."
yogscastkim,2ubl9m,Aeverelle,1 point,Sun Feb 1 17:31:02 2015 UTC,"You're spot on with that, I ran into decisions that I looked at both possibilities and still found it tough to choose. I like this model of decision making instead of a Telltale game where every decision is timed."
yogscastkim,2ubl9m,virgash,1 point,Sun Feb 1 17:41:39 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, definetely, but that's usually the deal with ""choice"" games, either choice you make will end up having the same or very similar consequences in the end.

yogscastkim,2ubl9m,Hpfm2,1 point,Sun Feb 1 20:07:55 2015 UTC,You should go check out Hannah's play through then because she has been checking both possibilities before deciding. Also its nice to compare how similiar/different people's play styles are.

Drain them into the casting basins for ""seared stone"".  Seared stone is safe for smeltery construction. Extend the smeltery upwards with the seared stone!

Since they only have 18 slots in the smeltery, that means 18 cobblestone.  18 compressed cobblestone however, that's 162 cobble!  Seared stone isn't a 1:1 from cobblestone, so you need quite a bit of it, which is why compressing it makes it easier."

While it's not based on actual legend (mostly), it's pretty legendary in feel - he has a huge battle with the World Serpent at one point, and it is probably the most EPIC thing ever put down in comic form.

The myth is of Wode the huntsman, not quite like any account of it on Wiki, though still related to the Norse/German god who gave his name to Wednesday, his sacred day. The west-country Anglosaxon Wode wasn't either a god or a hero though. In fact, because Norman upper class huntsmen would often ruin locals' fields on horseback hunts, he became an unwelcome symbol of them. Apart from Wednesday, he's one reason the ancient chalk horse images were maintained on hillsides in the Yogscast's part of the world. I may have some of my memories confused though, especially with Pan, a similar but Greek god my parents talked about when I was young.

The only word I recognize is Unu]ipqaq, which means ""I'm going to tell you something"" or ""I'm going to tell you a story"" and the word for the arctic fox ""Tiriganiaq"", there are probably more from my youth but I don't remember them."

yogscastkim,2tq4s2,Nephylite,8,Mon Jan 26 15:10:54 2015 UTC,"It was...okay. I'm not sure how much Hannah put out of it, as we recorded a few hours (probably about....5-6?), but what with her UBIPOCALYPSE over Xmas, I don't think she got around to editing. Which is understandable, as she had better games to feature! Ultimately, I think it suffered from the curse of older Japanese Survival horror - the controls were so freaking clunky, and the camera angles dire. We felt like we were fighting the controls more than the enemies most of the times. Twice, we had to stop recording because I felt seriously motion sick and nearly puked.   Horror wise, I wasn't really scared at any point, until we met the Spider Lady (she's in the trailer), because she was HORRIBLE. The story made little sense, and not even in a way good horror does it. It didn't have any interesting tidbits to entice you to find out more, or engage you.  In all honesty, I felt that Shinji Mikami was rehashing old ideas, with a slightly different IP. I really felt that the opening hours were almost identical to Resident Evil 4. You're in a backwater village. Local villagers/peasants have turned into disfigured cannibals. The first mini boss you meet is a guy with a hidden face and a chainsaw. It just felt super familiar and unsurprising, which disappointed me. I wanted it to be so much more."
yogscastkim,2tq4s2,nanosounds,6,Mon Jan 26 20:01:56 2015 UTC,The game is extremely short too. I managed to complete it in 2 days and I barely even played it. I was also disappointed with it. It had huge potential but they messed it up. My character kept uncrouching making my experience TERRIBLE. I can't say I hated the game but I didnt like it either. And oh god...that spider lady...Thanks for answering me once again today! Its a pleasure talking to you! Take care Kim! I left you another message on the other thread we talked on today. Sorry for all the text and for talking so much lol. Take Care!
yogscastkim,2tq4s2,PintsizedPint,1 point,Mon Jan 26 20:17:53 2015 UTC,Horror games usually are more scary when they are shorter. Long horror games tend to have too many action-game mechanics and become repetitive/predictable as they move on. Unfortunately the length of the game isn't the problem with Evil Within as Kim mentioned the horrible controls etc.

Amordrine is an alloy made from Platinum/Shiny Ingots and the purple nether metal Kalendrite. Amordrine has Lifesteal as an inherent property, which can only otherwise be acquired through farming Wither Skeletons. An Amordrine Rapier can literally keep you alive through an entire night of endless monsters whilst your hunger bar is empty.

The problem with fighting death comes really from his mobility and regen. He'll often teleport away into the trees and regen 5-7 hitpoints before you even find him again. I'm not sure if witchery has anti-teleportion in that version, but poison goes a ways to preventing the regeneration at least. High tier rapiers can certainly help with consistent DPS, but it certainly isn't easy without preparation!"

A lot of those types of games are just BAD, and thus wouldn't make interesting content, and there are plenty of GOOD early-access games out there too (Invisible, Inc. and Kerbal Space Program are two that come to mind), so I think that any problems with early access can be dealt with by a focus on playing good games she likes, which is a good idea anyway. This isn't YogDiscovery - Kim hasn't expressed any intention of playing these games because anyone asked or paid her to. In fact, quite the opposite, she specifically said that the games were ones that ""piqued (her) interest"", so even if you have problems with the early access model in general we'll probably see good content, so again, I wouldn't discourage her outright just because early access can be problematic..."

It becomes a very dark, twisted, interesting story and the developers have done/still do such a wonderful job on it and the newest chapters--even though I myself am a bit behind--seem ridiculously good. I also think even though you started it a long time ago even if those who watched it previously lost interest, doubtless you have gained new subscribers/fans since then who have not heard of the Last Door and will enjoy the game as much as you do. :) So I think it's a good idea to play it again and Nanobytes sounds like a great title!

I loved watching your series on it, and since I'm too much of a wimp to play it myself, I'd love it if you wanted to continue.  Nanobytes-Not only is it a good name, but it's a good idea. I like the whole ""look at oft-overlooked games and introduce them to your viewers"" type games. I think it would be quite cool.  Vlogs-Again, cool idea. Personally, I would keep it as a bi-weekly thing, so you can have some space in case you don't have any ideas for updates/any other type of vlog things for one week. Just my personal opinion, though, as I'll probably watch either way.  Co-op: I'm not sure. Chances are other users will come up with some good suggestions. For who to play with, Duncan's an obvious choice. It's been a while since you and Sjin have done something, so that could be another possibility.

Your style works well for let's plays and first impressions; you're able to make observations in the moment, and you show a good sense of when to fill the quiet and when to let the game speak for itself.

yogscastkim,2tiyvp,KoLycaon,2,Sat Jan 24 20:34:54 2015 UTC,"Everything sounds good for upcoming stuff, and Nanobytes is a fantastic  name for the new series. Hearing that you're planning to maybe do a vlog, I think maybe bi-weekly or monthly may be more workable overall. As for ""The Last Door"", I would really like to see this continued. I enjoyed your play of it and was hoping you will finish all the new chapters."
yogscastkim,2tiyvp,jaffas_on_toast,2,Sat Jan 24 20:40:03 2015 UTC,"I think Hannah and Kim should play One Late Night: Deadline for Fright Night, seeing it has been released fully on steam."
yogscastkim,2tiyvp,crystal-assassin,2,Sat Jan 24 21:04:04 2015 UTC,"Love the name Nano Bytes!  It's a great name for that kind of series.   I like the idea of a weekly q&a/vlog, if you're up to it.  Although having one every other month, or even monthly might work a bit better.  That way you can also make sure you have plenty of things that you want to talk about.  Plus, doing it weekly might be difficult, especially if you've already had a super busy week.  Don't want you to tire yourself out, too much. :)   I personally would love to see more of The Last Door from you.  Your play through of that was what lead me to subscribing to your channel in the first place, and I say if you want to do it then go for it.  I'm also loving the idea of the 2nd Alien Isolation DLC with Nathan, as it should be great fun.    Really though all of your ideas sound amazing, and I look forward to seeing as much of your content as possible this year.  Keep up the amazing work! :D"
yogscastkim,2tiyvp,P_Joelsson,2,Sat Jan 24 21:24:35 2015 UTC,I would love to see more of The Last door! Feels like ages since the last time.
yogscastkim,2tiyvp,badgerface5,2,Sun Jan 25 00:12:15 2015 UTC,Yay to the q/a! Also do a poke pack opening with hat films since you actually know what they are. Then Ross can shout Kim knows that one every time they put a card on that table and the intervention shot goes boom! :p
yogscastkim,2tiyvp,AndroVeitie,1 point,Sun Jan 25 00:45:17 2015 UTC,All these ideas sound great. Can't wait to see what surfaces from them! :)
yogscastkim,2tiyvp,hazzer99x,1 point,Sat Jan 24 18:02:08 2015 UTC,"Those ideas sound great, especially Nanobytes. I'm a fan of similar yogscast series such as An Evening with Sips and I love Indie games, so I'm looking forward to that. My suggestion for Fright Night would be Dollhouse. It is randomly generated horror game inspired by Stephen King novels. Also, it will include multiplayer which might be fun to play with other Yogs. Also, I would love to see you play the Last Survivor DLC for Alien: Isolation with Nathan."
yogscastkim,2tiyvp,huntingclawfins,1 point,Sat Jan 24 18:54:57 2015 UTC,"You should play spelunky with 4 people for your fun multiplayer couch co-op thing, the amount of hilarity to be had in the local multiplayer of it is insane. You have to work as a team to survive and get to the end of each randomly generated level but there's always betrayals and 'accidents' and you end up killing each other, but you come back as a ghost and you can either help or troll your friends. If you do play it, it doesn't tell you but you can pick up your friends and throw them."

So I would keep your eyes open on here, but it might take some or never happen so keep that in mind. Also I imagine Kim would tweet about it if it happens."
yogscastkim,2tiyvp,Winsentti,1 point,Sun Jan 25 05:33:20 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the idea of Nano Bites, but I hope Kim puts some thought into how to present each game. I only say that because other channels have tried to do indie game impressions and have fallen a little flat. For example, as much as I like Sjin's usual content, his Sjindie Game series usually boiled down to him saying over and over ""this is really really good. I'm having so much fun. I really like this."""

yogscastkim,2tiyvp,droppedelbow,1 point,Tue Jan 27 18:29:33 2015 UTC,"All great ideas, Kim. But, as someone who does daily videos on his own, there's a great degree of difficulty coming up with consistant new content if you are either unable to keep up with trends and new games, or simply nothing good is coming out on the indie or even AAA side (of course, early in the year is tough too because not a lot of new games come out during this time in general). The same can be said for vlogs. If you don't or can't really keep up with doing vlogs with new ideas or have some sort of consistent series or similar (again, it's not easy to do something like that bi-weekly, let alone weekly or daily), it's best to establish something more like a bi-weekly or monthly schedule. That way, it remains special and meaningful and fun to watch.  Having new ideas is great, but I'm sure most here can agree that we also don't want you to burn yourself out. We enjoy your content, and please don't burn yourself out or end up consistently doing something you don't enjoy or dislike because if you're not having fun, I for one have a hard time enjoying your videos. Cooking would be fun in addition to your gaming content, but again, don't push yourself too hard to do it. It's better to do few videos you enjoy instead of doing videos just for the sake of trying to keep with idea you didn't like or wasn't all that successful. Plus cooking videos present their own set of challenges, more than doing music, that's for sure.  As for names, I can't really recommend anything (I struggle with my own content as it is) so NanoBytes (or any variation of the spelling) I think is a great title for indie highlights series. I can't recommend anything better, that's for sure.  I would also recommend for Q&A (though given the large number of Yognau(gh)ts, it may be difficult), doing it as a livestream. Simply put on a game you enjoy playing (i.e. Mario Kart) or do it vlog or podcast style, and have someone reading/moderating the chat doing Q&A with watchers asking questions. Or reserve that for special occasions. Unfortunately, I probably wouldn't be able to be there since I live in the US and the time zones mean that I might either be sleeping or working during such a live stream following a typical day in Greenwich Mean Time. It's a pretty typical method of doing a Q&A. Otherwise, using reddit and doing a monthly Q&A from questions from reddit that way (or however you'd choose to schedule it) would be a great option as well.  Otherwise, be well, continue to have fun in all you do, let the haters hate, because you've got some great fans here, myself included. And remember, don't burn yourself out, we don't want to see or hear about that. Keep having fun! Stay beautiful, Kim, and don't be afraid to show your Asian pride! Not enough English-speaking Asian YouTube gamers out there, but you're one of the proud and few! I know you inspire me at the very least. STAY AWESOME!"
yogscastkim,2tiyvp,TheyCallMeTakeo,2,Sat Jan 24 18:50:57 2015 UTC,"Possibly one of the most arrogant posts I think I've ever read.  Man who has many videos with no views tells member of one of UK's largest gaming channels how to make content? There's a massive difference between sharing ideas and this, which just comes across as patronising.   I was trying to give you the benefit of the doubt but then I read ""because you've got some great fans here, myself included."" and gave up. I'm glad you think you're great, but try and keep it to yourself, this level of smug self satisfaction is stomach churning."
yogscastkim,2tiyvp,droppedelbow,3,Sat Jan 24 20:17:17 2015 UTC,"Well, then I apologize. I didn't intend to come off in that way. I guess I was just a little to eager is all.

I don't think it's cool calling people arrogant just because you read it that way without at least asking him what he meant (Also, there's a lot of people from different countries, including me, that don't always get the wording just right all the time so have some patience with us). Don't worry though, as you said below we all slip sometimes so, at least for me, it's ok. Let's just try to keep the sub as polite, positive and welcoming as we can. And stay awesome."

They should've just upped the stone's capacity to what's required of the most difficult spell (which I'd presume is the Death one)...

That's the only logical reason I can think of for having the stones only hold three spirits apiece. (That way the spectral stones can probably stack and stuff)"
yogscastkim,2tb2vl,bookworm6892,2,Fri Jan 23 21:47:13 2015 UTC,"It's not that a spectral stone can only hold one of each spirit, but that they can only hold three spirits of the same type. So a stone can't hold a Banshee, Poltergeist, & Spectre, but it can hold three Banshees. It's inefficient/messy considering the summoning ritual requires five of each type of spirit. So they should've either dropped the requirement to three or upped the capacity of the stone to five.   Or hell, make the requirement six. I could live with needing two filled stones for each spirit. The fact that it takes 1 and 2/3 of a stone makes it clear that they implemented the ritual after they created Spectral Stones.

yogscastkim,2sj9i2,Barnabus_Bot,4,Thu Jan 15 17:47:16 2015 UTC,"""K: Over the space of two and a half days at Christmas I watched all 12 Star Trek movies, back to back.  D: (pause) Whyy??""  Quote of the episode."
yogscastkim,2sj9i2,ByStranger,3,Thu Jan 15 21:35:20 2015 UTC,"The review of Star Trek Generations Duncan talked about (part about the uniforms at 4:52) (made by the same guy who did that 70 minutes long review of Star Trek Episode 1). It's pretty funny and if you're a Star Trek fan you should watch it, as well as his reviews of First Contact, Insurrection and Nemesis."
yogscastkim,2sj9i2,ChuckCarmichael,3,Thu Jan 15 17:51:09 2015 UTC,"With Kim talking about her love of Star Trek, I would definitely recommend her checking out artemis spaceship bridge simulator. I'm sure she would have a lot of fun with that (although It requires people for each bridge officer)."
yogscastkim,2sj9i2,cotorshas,3,Thu Jan 15 18:05:21 2015 UTC,I wonder why have the Yogs not done any videos with that? (I think it showed up on one of Bebops' livestreams this year though?)
yogscastkim,2sj9i2,evildrganymede,3,Thu Jan 15 19:25:41 2015 UTC,"Two things I'd like to point out, though the first of them was mentioned I think on the main reddit by someone else.   put a piece of string over your witch hut door, and the vines won't grow over it.  Make a witches hat and a witches robe from witchery, as it will increase the amount of potions you can get. Also, if you can get and bind a toad familiar, (i think you can have more than one, but not 100 percent on that one) you can get also get bonuses this way.    So basically by wearing the hat, robe, and having a toad familiar, you're almost always guaranteed to get like 6+ potions from each brew made at your kettle."
yogscastkim,2sj9i2,evildrganymede,2,Fri Jan 16 05:13:48 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of the ST: The Motion Picture too, though I see what Kim means when they're basically playing second fiddle to the events and SFX.   The 10 minute flyaround of the Enterprise in the spacedock at the start was I think more due to the fact that nobody had seen it since the Original Series ended at the time that the movie first came out. My theory is that it's basically a bit of ""fan service"" (so to speak) for people to see her in all her glory again - so it seems a bit redundant for us watching it now.  And I quite liked Nemesis. I'm not really sure why it gets a lot of hate (I thought it was far better than Insurrection - which I can't even remember anything about - and I think it's the best of the Next Gen films because unlike the others it doesn't have a terribly annoying subplot). But maybe I'm weird like that.   I actually would have liked to see what happens to the Star Trek setting after the events of Nemesis (since the Romulan Empire is kinda in tatters) rather than have a reboot of the setting, but I guess we'll never know now.   Also, well done for watching all the movies back to back... I couldn't even get through all the extended LotR movies in one day, but then I don't think I'm very good at binge watching - I just get bored of it after a while!"

yogscastkim,2rzubm,RoseHearth,8,Sat Jan 10 20:53:10 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I understand why Kim made the decision. Marble is a nightmare to get hold of, and if they'd stopped to gather more it would either have been episodes worth of dead air, or wasted recording time.  If they'd cheated in machines, I'd probably be more sympathetic, but for the sake of saved airtime, I'll take the hit. I'd also be more offended if she'd concealed it, but to be honest, it doesn't shake me either way."
yogscastkim,2rzubm,RGPFerrous,3,Sat Jan 10 22:45:49 2015 UTC,"She should have just said sorry, but you're going to have to build with something other than marble. Take the wrong marble and throw it in the bin, and spawn an exact same amount in of the right kind, and say nope after that's gone you're done."
yogscastkim,2rzubm,virgash,3,Sat Jan 10 22:49:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't think much of it either when she cheated in the marble, it would have been ages to get the marble they needed. I'm glad that Kim acknowledged what she was doing as well.  The big question in my mind is if this is a one time cheat or if it will happen more often now that she's already cheated once. Either way I don't mind, the banter is what I enjoy most, but the buildings are cool too."
yogscastkim,2rzubm,evildrganymede,3,Sun Jan 11 01:31:36 2015 UTC,"I think Hat Films + Kim are an awesome combination. Yeah, they're not 'child-friendly' or 'family-friendly' or 'appropriate', but that's their style. If you don't like that sort of thing then I guess you can always just skip the Hat Films episodes.   As for the cheating, I thought that was hilarious. I mean, if you're going to cheat on a non-cheaty server then you may as well just go crazy with it... what was it, something like 2000 Marble blocks? It was a bazillion stacks anyway.  I don't think she needed to cheat it all in though, they probably could have found enough marble lying around somewhere. But for me the point isn't that it's a cheat-free world, the point is that they're all building something in a common setting and having fun with it."
yogscastkim,2rzubm,evildrganymede,1 point,Sat Jan 10 22:46:37 2015 UTC,"The thing about hatfilms is that they're loud, and they overpower everyone else. I like hat films on occasion, but the moment she brought them in they were drowning her out. I don't care if she cheats to trade the bad marble with the right one, but the point of that world was so they wouldn't cheat. It's just annoying that they forced her to cave."
yogscastkim,2rzubm,evildrganymede,1 point,Sat Jan 10 22:55:36 2015 UTC,"They didn't ""force her to cave"", she decided that she'd let them have the extra marble and cheat it in herself since Ross couldn't. It's her world, it's up to her.   And yes, they're 'louder' (plus there's three of them instead of just one other). But nobody has to watch them if they don't like them."
yogscastkim,2rzubm,theomega000,1 point,Sat Jan 10 23:13:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they're bad. Objectively, they begged until she caved. She even said so in the episode. They shouldn't have done that because part of the charm was that it was cheat free and it was unfair for them to expect Kim to make special exceptions for them and not anyone else. Plus, in general, begging is not fair and not cool. That's now how adults handle their situations. If it was their series, sure whatever. But that was a dick move to push her towards cheating."
yogscastkim,2rzubm,Omni-Potentia,0,Sat Jan 10 23:23:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think it really makes a difference to anything. If Kim wasn't cool with doing it then she wouldn't have done it, and as I pointed out, it's her series. They really didn't 'force her to cave' or 'push her towards cheating'."
yogscastkim,2rzubm,Omni-Potentia,2,Sat Jan 10 23:32:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like Hat Films are a very different set of people in the office vs their series personas. I get the feeling that they are pretty nice guys in the office, but anytime I see them in Minecraft they always seem to be a  loud shouty group. They also seem to be drawn into forcing memes on their audience (""Eat Shit"" for example). Ive liked pretty much every other Nano's Village but introducing Hat Films was such a departure from what I expect/have grown used to in that series that it wasn't enjoyable."

yogscastkim,2rvgg9,Captain_Reid,1 point,Fri Jan 9 19:09:13 2015 UTC,Because 32-Bit can use maximum 3GB ram and you need ram for other Windows/OS Processes aswell.   Me: Software Engineering Student and IT Department Supervisor for 7 years.

But I'm still confused as to why AT launcher has such a low limit set for memory usage. if the user wants to utilize that RAM, understanding that it will impact on their system then they should be able to use what they have"
yogscastkim,2rvgg9,Captain_Reid,1 point,Sat Jan 10 19:12:41 2015 UTC,I would assume that its to make it Newbie friendly. Alot of people thinks that if you put all the ram you have it will work faster. but that is not the case.   Its locked to 1 or 1.5 max so that People wont complain when its their fault that it doesn't load. or their PC come to the point of near-crashing.  Also Minecraft shouldn't need more than 4 GB. as It doesnt utilize the ram that well anyways.   Technic Launcher and FTB Launcher also has that 1.5GB Limit.
yogscastkim,2rvgg9,merTYol,1 point,Sat Jan 10 19:20:39 2015 UTC,"I initially assumed the same thing, but this is apparently not the case.  From what I've researched, a 32-bit version of Java (on Windows) cannot have more than somewhere between 1.4 and 1.5GB RAM assigned to it per process. At least as far as ATLauncher (and other modpack loaders) seem to believe. As far as I was aware, the only way to allow 32-bit Java to use more than 1GB RAM is to use the 64-bit version, something you obviously cannot do on a 32-bit OS.  My test case was a member of the community who is currently running Windows 8 32-Bit with 4GB RAM (3.7 Usable), who's only option for ""Maximum Memory/Ram"" on ATLauncher was 1GB or below.  It is possible that java restricts itself to allow only values under at least half of your total RAM but I can't find any evidence to support this theory.  If you can provide a workaround that will allow people to use settings higher than 1GB in ATLauncher on a 32-bit system then please share it, because I'm drawing a blank."

I don't know if the Hats have built their tunnel under Pandalabs in the FB continuity yet, but I'd hate to see it all go down from their perspective while FB is still weeks behind.  As it is I think FB and HC are the only series really continuing on the server (Magic Police is too, but they're pretty far away).

The editors just need a bit of time to get caught up from the holidays before they can start releasing it regularly again.  As for the big gap in between both series I'd reckon they would release their videos first, since they have gone and released everything else that has happened between them so far.   Also I'm not expecting them to wrap story elements since the server may die before they can get to it, and they can still spin the story into a new series on a different modpack as well! Plus Duncan's clones storyline is based off of Yoglabs/Hole Diggers so I don't think they will touch on it much. Though I miss Lalnable Hector and it would be nice to see they get cleansed of the taint, I see MAD being foreshadowed so often now that it seems to be the focus now instead of the former two options."
