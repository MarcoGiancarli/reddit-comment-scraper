Some line of movement or sinuousness of form that the rest of the tree follows from. So what about this tree is special to you?"

We've had the same heat wave, and my elm has not browned like that, and it's in full sun from about 10 to 4. That being said, I'm not saying yours has nothing to do with the heat, just that mine hasn't acted that way. It (along with everything else in full sun) has been getting watered twice a day since May though.    Is it in a well-draining soil? If not, it's too late to do so, but you need to be more careful with the watering. I'd say keep it in dappled shade, water the soil before it gets dry and hope for the best."

Bonsai,3e3vet,-music_maker-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:16:09 2015 UTC,Some people have suggested in the past putting a plastic bag over it in addition to watering it profusely. Never done that myself though.
Bonsai,3e3vet,f-a-p,2,Tue Jul 21 21:31:34 2015 UTC,"If you water it one morning, and then late afternoon/early evening the very next day, it actually gets two full cycles of hot noon-time sun on hot days.   You've technically watered it daily, but if it consumed all/most of it's water during the first cycle, it may have essentially gone an entire summer day without water.   Not saying this is definitely what happened, but it's a very easy mistake to make. Your tree looks like a tree that ran out of water.  Sometimes trees in bonsai pots need water multiple times during very hot days, so it does require checking on them frequently.  If it's not quite dead, it still may recover with proper care, but you now have a fairly high maintenance tree for a while. I would definitely err on the side of keeping the soil wet for the rest of the summer."
Bonsai,3e3vet,amethystrockstar,2,Wed Jul 22 02:31:44 2015 UTC,"Cut off all of the dead / brown leaves, leaving just the fewer healthy leaves underneath. I'd also move to dappled sun and/or shade for a while.   Also to me that soil looks really wet. What is it, under the pebbles? The soil should be porous all the way through. If it's really dense soil, then be sure to let it mostly dry out, and never make the soil totally sodden. In the spring, repot into a mixture which is completely porous, using ingredients such as turface, lava rock, pumice, and so on. With those types of ingredients it's impossible to ever over water."

I have ficus and schefflera and others that keep me happy.    I styled, root-pruned, and first-potted a large boxwood on a rainy August day. It was an ugly tree and I was planning on throwing it away anyway.  Therefore, since I wanted to see if it could stand an August attack, I pulled it out of its 10-gallon pot and I went at it.  The tree did quite well.  I soaked it in a tub with some Miracle Grow Quick Start and kept it in the shade for a few weeks.  It's now doing great.  I wouldn't recommend it, but sometimes torturing a tree you were going to throw away is a good way to learn about a species.  August is the best time to collect planera aquatica (water elm) from Lake Catahoula.  That's a lie. It's the only time.  The lake level is lowered by the Army Corps of Engineers each year.  However, I don't recommend repotting the species at this time.  I just wanted to mention that sometimes the opportunity to collect a tree comes along an you've got to be ready.  A friend contacted me last night to purchase some small water elms for a forest he's putting together.  I hope he's not actually doing this right now.  I did an experiment once to see if Superthrive (which I never recommend to anyone) performed better than Miracle Grow Quick Start, Rootone, or water when potting seedlings in the Summer. I had numerous seedlings of fortunella hindsii (Hong Kong Kumquat) that had ugly roots because they were not started properly. These were more trees I was ready to throw away. I used 16 seedlings that were 10-12 inches in height and pulled them out of moist potting soil and put them into 50/50 haydite/pinebark in small bonsai pots.  All were root-pruned and lightly trimmed.  4 went into a bath of Superthrive (cap-full per gallon) , 4 into Miracle Grow Quick Start (recommended strength), and 8 into just water.  4 of the last group were dusted with Rootone and had the powder lightly watered into the pot. This left 4 trees with a water soak as the only after-potting care.  I wanted to see if potting the trees in bonsai soil at the worst time of year was mitigated by different treatments.  I had hoped the water-only set, the control group, would suffer (or better, die).  Nope.  ALL THE TREES SURVIVED AND THRIVED. Turns out all I discovered was proper bonsai care is all you need to repot that one species in August.   Other than that, however, you're correct.  Leave them roots alone!"

Bonsai,3e2fmv,Aeolean,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:28 2015 UTC,The cut roots in spring have time to regrow and recover through the summer and be hardened off before winter - that's not the case with something root pruned in autumn.

Bonsai,3e3pmr,Dylan_ail_Don,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:52 2015 UTC,"Boxwoods usually make good broom styles and yours are no exception.  You really want a design before you start pruning but in general, I think it's still fine to prune now. Pruning usually stimulates new growth so as long as any new growth has time to harden off before winter it should be fine.   I would sketch a design and do some light pruning - mostly just reduce branches. Do not remove any if you're not sure, especially the lower ones.  Don't worry about the soil. You can safely keep it in that container till spring. You can use any standard fertilizer in regular strength. Once it's in bonsai soil you can go stronger (because most of it washes out) but with the potting soil it's in, just use regular strength."
Bonsai,3e3pmr,RumburakNC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:30:17 2015 UTC,"Boxwood can be repotted in summer and have a better reaction to it than doing so in early Spring, though just because you can do it doesn't mean you necessarily should. Usually when you get these like this they'll be crazy root bound, but it's hard to tell if these are.

I want to get into this hobby when I have a permanent home and space to plant trees in the ground/have enough money to buy a starter. I lurk on this sub and read through criticisms hoping to learn all I can before I actually get started.

Like they go on and on about how difficult of a hobby it is (I believe them) and how it takes a lot of work (no arguments with that) but if all the feedback is given negatively, it's hard to see through the condescension and get to the actual learning.   I write, and I criticize other people's writing. Even if they're a level below me or I don't think their work is up to par, I'm not going to be a complete bitch about it. Because if I am, that's going to make them want to stop writing. It's the same freakin deal with this.

If you are presenting information in a straightforward manner and people flip out, that's one thing. If you are making a point of taking jabs you can't be all indignant when people take offense. Take some damn responsibility. If you think the world is constantly misconstruing what you're saying, it makes more sense to change how you say it than it does to expect folks to take it a different way. Let's not pretend that people aren't going out of their way to be shitty around here."
Bonsai,3dz869,Pabloxanibar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I wrote a response but it was getting lengthy and we could go back and forth forever. I can see both sides. I think people should try to be nice, but I also think people need to be less sensitive and not take things so personally."
Bonsai,3dz869,emperor000,2,Tue Jul 21 18:57:06 2015 UTC,"I know, like I said, I understand where you are coming from. I think part of the problem is, with /u/kthehun89 for example, is that he will say something and be blunt and not necessarily a dick. But the person thinks they are the same thing and responds in kind in their mind and then /u/kthehun89 might be a dick.  I'm a little bit playing devil's advocate... My point was that you and I might know it is in a way that makes the receiving party unreceptive to it, but the person giving it might not realize that or might not care since there is something to be said for a tough skin. In other words, they aren't doing it to be jerks (at least not always, I guess sometimes they are) and they aren't doing it because they expect the person will be unreceptive. They are doing it because they expect the person to not take it personally or not take it as an attack.  I know I struggle with this in real life and on here. In /r/succulents I've upset people because I've bluntly said that succulents are not adapted for terrariums and been pretty blunt about it. But what else can I do? You have a dozen people who found their way here from Pintrest or whatever who are part of the same terrarium-death-trap-craze saying how lovely it looks so it seems like somebody needs to point out that it isn't going to work. If you do that every time you are going to hurt somebody's feelings every now and then. I'm not sure how you can avoid that."
Bonsai,3dz869,emperor000,3,Tue Jul 21 16:14:31 2015 UTC,"Us beginners shouldn't expect everyone to tell us what we did was right and looks good even if it's wrong. That's not how learning works. Constructive criticism is great I think. As long as there is advice on doing something correctly, nobody should get butthurt. This is like a classroom with teachers and students. It should be treated with the same respect as one should while in a classroom.  Bonsai isn't a easy thing to pick up and just do. The feedback is just saving years of work going down the drain or keeping someone from ruining their tree. Harsh or not, it's just trying to help. Can't sugar coat everything. Just my 2 cents."
Bonsai,3dz869,halfeclipsed,5,Mon Jul 20 20:21:28 2015 UTC,"Can't sugar coat everything.   Why not?  I can't imagine any constructive criticism that can't be said in a nice way. I'm not talking about lying, saying it's good when it's not. I'm just talking about saying it nicely. It's not harder to say stuff nicely than harshly, and it will help a lot more. So why not do it?"
Bonsai,3dz869,ZeAthenA714,-7,Mon Jul 20 20:40:09 2015 UTC,"Because we aren't children. We should all have tough enough skin to not get our feelings hurt over a tree. Not everyone is soft spoken. They speak their own way. How are we right to tell someone not to speak a certain way? If someone can't be told they did something wrong and not get hurt over it, the internet is not the place to be."
Bonsai,3dz869,halfeclipsed,9,Mon Jul 20 20:59:45 2015 UTC,"How are we right to tell someone not to speak a certain way?   I'm not telling anyone to speak in a certain way. I'm just pointing out the fact that it doesn't cost a dime to be nice with beginners. And it's not a question of getting hurt, it's the simple fact that if you're talking nice to someone, they'll be more receptive to what you have to say. So if you really want to help people, saying things nicely will get the job done in a more effective way. Isn't that the goal?"
Bonsai,3dz869,ZeAthenA714,-5,Mon Jul 20 21:04:20 2015 UTC,I'm just saying that that is how some people are/speak. It shouldn't just go straight to that they're being an asshole and rude. Its tough love. Maybe I'm just used to tough love.

It is not, nor has it ever been about people not wanting to learn, or refusing to accept the truth. It's always been about how some choose to dispense information with a sneer, acting as self appointed gatekeepers to the hobby in trying to keep the filthy casuals out.   Many in this sub cultivate and actively perpetuate an attitude problem. No if ands or buts about it.   Granted, folks are under no obligation to be nice or genial.

I just had an argument with a guy in one thread and helped him out with his collected trees in another. I've been doing this the vast majority of my life, generally I don't make posts asking advice because I've learned what I need to know. When I do have questions I generally ask people I respect directly who works with similar trees in a similar zone, after checking my books. I don't post pictures of my trees because I don't care to. Also some people would know who I am based on my trees and I would rather remain anonymous. It's seems like all you do is word police, that and talk about ferns."

As far as advancing negativity on this sub, you are literally one of the absolute worst offenders.  I have a bunch of pre bonsai, and don't post them because they are still a long way off. I do post somewhat regularly on this sub's attitude problem, but just like you're free to be as much of an ass as you want, I am under no obligation to keep my mouth shut when you're being an ass. I offer advice on what I am qualified to speak on, and post elsewhere where my knowledge base is more applicable. Here, I lurk, learn, and keep my mouth shut if I have nothing to add.

Bonsai,3dz869,halfeclipsed,16,Tue Jul 21 12:29:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this.  As a new lurker in this sub for maybe the last month I was kind of surprised at the comments by some people, especially towards what looked like beginners.  Mostly good info but maybe too curt and tactless.  I understand now just how ridiculous some of the newbie questions can be but sometimes I read the responses to questions and think ""Welp, that guy's not gonna post here again"".  It reminds me of other hobby/pro related subreddits like photography with the never-ending battle over what is vs what is not an acceptable level of digital editing, beginners who got DSLR's as a gift and expect it to take amazing pictures, and yet another blog post about photos being stolen.  The more experienced more long-term users just get sick of the same stupid shit over and over again and I completely understand why.    One random thing to note as a beginner browsing the wiki...most of the text is invisible when browsing using Night Mode(grey text on grey background).  I thought the wiki was broken or not finished as it is in most subreddits and disregarded it.  I went back later, realized there was text in those blank looking spots and turned night mode off and was impressed at just how much effort went into the wiki.    I think between the weekly beginners thread and good wiki content, this sub has made much better progress than other subs at funneling noobs to the info they need to cut down on the clutter on the main page. There will always be people though who can't be bothered to do anything on their own and just want to be spoon fed knowledge."

Sometimes you just need to look at things from the other person's perspective. I liked the idea of the positive comment sandwich.

Sitting ladies should always cross their legs at the ankle. 2) If this is the same tree as photo 1, that is some serious re-imagining.  It's also a combination between Durga and a cheerleader. 3) As someone who is the father of a graphics arts student, I could see that happening.  Now imagine if your mom said ""I bought a bonsai, could you buy me a pair of scissors?""  How many tools would you buy your mom? 4) ""Books.... are generally useless.""  Have you tried turning them right-side-up?  Just a thought.  As to your drawings.  I couldn't draw a twig when I started drawing on my own.  I decided to start paying attention to the details of other drawings to see just how they were put together.  How can I depict various branch intersections?  How could I distinguish the leaves of a maple, pine, bald cypress, ficus, so that it better represented the tree I wanted?  Once I started doing this, my drawings became much more refined.  I've even received complements (although I know they're garbage).  Figuring out your goals for a tree is necessary to the art of bonsai.  You obviously want to be able to draw that vision.  Not many of us can.  When someone asks me ""Why the hell is that there?"" or ""Why did you do this instead of...?""  (my friends are brutal, by the way), I can show them the sketches I have for the tree's future and they understand better than I could ever convince them with words.  Keep up your drawing.  Even if it never improves, you'll learn much from your attempts to put design ideas on paper."

For what it's worth though since she bought a 3 acre farm 7 years ago I have since put in countless hours (as an adult mind you) of free labor: landscaping pulling weeds harvest etc.    4) I really need to be more careful using hyperbole *and sarcasm in this sub.

Bonsai,3e1prn,Aeolean,3,Tue Jul 21 18:19:28 2015 UTC,"Styling gender is a useful tool to use.  It will help you with pot selection, for one thing.  Also, if you go with gender, it will help you continue a style across the life of the tree.  As new limbs develop, you can go back to the style's gender for inspiration.  Not necessary to do, but it's another tool in the toolbox. FUN IS EVERYTHING!  I just didn't know if it was the same tree.   Always have fun doing bonsai.  Want to sketch wild designs?  Scribble away.  I do.  Sometimes, in the scribbles and sketches I see things that help me with design. What I meant was, you would likely not show up with just a pair of requested scissors for your mother.  I would go through my tools looking for everything I could spare.  Even a tool roll.  If she were to ask me for a pair of scissors, I'd give her a toolbox, a couple of screen-ready pots, and a bag of soil.  I like your wife's response to your request. Dang it.  I thought you saw my sarcasm as well.  The photo was upside down and you said the books were useless.     I do want you to keep drawing and conceptualizing.  I have doodles all over the wall at work.  You don't need to get better at it, you just need to do it."
Bonsai,3e1prn,Aeolean,2,Tue Jul 21 19:19:41 2015 UTC,"All awesome points.  I feel like a bit of an ass missing your point about scissors for my mom.  Usually I would be the one borrowing scissors (or shears, or loppers) from her.  Also someone mentioned ""my mom"" on reddit, so my brain went straight to defense mode."

Bonsai,3e03gs,Schroedingersfeline,2,Tue Jul 21 05:32:45 2015 UTC,That is badass Jerry. I have only just realized that field maple are pretty abundant in my area. it seems like a great tree to work with.   Those leaves look very young. Does it reduce leaf size well enough?
Bonsai,3e03gs,NooclearWessel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:27:15 2015 UTC,"They grow great as bonsai you should find seedlings and saplings growing everywhere, then, if the mature trees are around.   This one was totally defoliated twice this year - these are the third set of leaves it's grown."
Bonsai,3dzypl,JoeNathan78,3,Mon Jul 20 22:07:06 2015 UTC,Plastic bag with a couple of inches of water in it - shady spot in the garden. No watering required.
Bonsai,3dzypl,small_trunks,2,Mon Jul 20 22:22:12 2015 UTC,so something like this?
Bonsai,3dzypl,small_trunks,2,Mon Jul 20 22:35:58 2015 UTC,Yes. A simple big plastic bag - don't need to worry about them touching the sides for just a couple of days.
Bonsai,3dzypl,phalyn13,2,Mon Jul 20 22:42:00 2015 UTC,Seems simple enough. Thanks!

Bonsai,3dyrod,yessica0o0,3,Mon Jul 20 17:33:18 2015 UTC,Figure out what species you're working on and do some research on its suitability for bonsai before you start.
Bonsai,3dyrod,NooclearWessel,2,Mon Jul 20 17:51:54 2015 UTC,"Picture would help, ""saplings"" makes them sound too small to be doing anything to them..."
Bonsai,3dyrod,TotaLibertarian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:52:46 2015 UTC,Not just any sapling will work. Figure out what you're looking at and read up on it.
Bonsai,3dyrod,peter-bone,2,Mon Jul 20 17:55:45 2015 UTC,Tall saplings sounds like the opposite of what you should be looking for. Forests are not great for finding bonsai material because there's not much light low down. Forest clearings or the edge of forests are better.
Bonsai,3dz8e4,princesssquish,9,Mon Jul 20 18:59:05 2015 UTC,"If you're keeping this indoors, that's the big problem. You're killing it with lack of sunlight.  Cutting doesn't help things grow. It reduces the scale of the system. If the system is faulty, introducing damage that requires healing usually only makes things worse.  If there's still some green, it could still have some life left, but this honestly looks pretty dead to me.   Tap water is fine. My trees get watered with tap water every day.  Don't worry, we all kill trees occasionally. Don't give up - just get another and try again."
Bonsai,3dz8e4,-music_maker-,0,Mon Jul 20 19:24:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your reply.  Any idea what the tree is?  Also, we have really hard water here (UK)- dishes/kettles are covered in Limescale after only a few uses and I noticed my Bonsai has the same scale on the trunk. It definitely responded better to rain water.   I kept it outside with more than enough sunlight, but brought it inside when it started to dry out in the sun. In fact, I think that's what might have killed too many hot days in a row outside w/o sufficient water while I was away for a few weeks.   Assuming it's not 100% dead. Would fertilizer help?  I'm so sad to see this little tree go."
Bonsai,3dz8e4,-music_maker-,2,Mon Jul 20 20:47:43 2015 UTC,"If your water is that bad, and you're willing to filter your it, it probably will cut down on the mineral deposits. But watering with filtered water definitely adds work to the process. I used to use filtered water for mine for a while, and then discovered that our tap water worked just as well.   I kept it outside with more than enough sunlight, but brought it inside when it started to dry out in the sun.    Hot days don't kill trees - improper watering during hot days does. Inside not drying out is actually much worse than outside and sometimes requiring water multiple times a day.   Assuming it's not 100% dead. Would fertilizer help?   Fertilizer is not going to solve this problem.   I'm so sad to see this little tree go.   It always sucks, but that's life. I've lost a couple I really liked in the past few years. You have to just replace them and start again."
Bonsai,3dz8e4,rachtee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:53:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks again Music Maker for all your advice, much appreciated. Sigh, maybe I will just have to accept that I failed this one. :("
Bonsai,3dz8e4,manicbunny,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:02:05 2015 UTC,"Hi, i was wondering if you can help me, I have a Bonsai similar to OP, judging by the pot I think we bought them in the same place, I am also in the UK. My bonsai is also dying but it not quite as bad as OP's plant and still has leaves but they are beginning to fall off.   I bought my bonsai when I had a garden and he could live outside but I have since moved to a second floor flat with no garden/balcony. I am guessing he's dying because he isn't getting enough sun. He lives on a window sil with the window open most of the time but over the past month or so he's started to die. Is there anything that can be done to save him with no garden?  Thank you, I thought it'd be silly to create separate post when my question is very similar. I can post a picture of my bonsai if needed. Thank you :)"
Bonsai,3dz8e4,rachtee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:53:30 2015 UTC,"The beginners thread would more appropriate for this type of question.   If this is the same type of tree (a boxwood I think) then if you have no choice but inside a southern or western window would help. Also you could read up on indoor lighting setups that will allow your tree to survive.   If you can set up something like a window box, I know you can buy ones that aren't permanent :)"
Bonsai,3dz8e4,-music_maker-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:21:14 2015 UTC,"Okay thank you so much for your response. I will definitely look there! The tree is an elm and we've had it about a year and a half. Thank you for your help, hopefully I can salvage him :)"
Bonsai,3dz8e4,rachtee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:18:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, post a pic. But indoors is probably the problem if you are watering correctly."
Bonsai,3dz8e4,Harleequin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:28:51 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/jwDchUJ  this is a picture I just took. Obviously all the dead leaves need cleaning up but it is well watered so it probably is the indoor lifestyle
Bonsai,3dz8e4,Harleequin,2,Tue Jul 21 16:28:25 2015 UTC,"This tree looks dead already :(   Only the moss looks alive for now.  On your next tree you should leave it outside. Bring them inside occaisonally if you want to show them off to guests, but plants love sunlight. Even being next to a window might not be enough.  Is the soil usually moist? You don't have to drown the tree, but making sure the soil is always at least wet is a good idea.  To see if its still alive you should take it out immediately and check back for any green in a few days or a week. If not I would whittle something out of the wood."
Bonsai,3dz8e4,small_trunks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks Harleequin for your reply. Soil is usually moist (except those weeks I was gone). Going to put it outside now even though it is nighttime, still have a little hope left.   I really like your idea or whittling something out of the wood. As corny/dramatic as this is going to sound, I've been looking for a way to try and feel like I didn't fail this tiny living thing that was under my care, and I think your whittling idea might offer me some kind of solace."
Bonsai,3dz8e4,small_trunks,2,Mon Jul 20 21:06:00 2015 UTC,"No problem! :-) I would maybe whittle another creature or totem piece and put it next to your next tree you get!  All things die, some due to our own hands, and some outside of them. The best we can do is learn from those experiences and apply that knowledge to our own life.  Good luck with your next tree!   I'm not sure if I'm identifying it correctly but your tree almost looks a little like mine, the root system and the leaves at least. I am still a newbie so I might be wrong. But it could be a crepe."
Bonsai,3dz8e4,AtlasAirborne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:36:20 2015 UTC,I've done a couple of threads in the past on stuff to do with dead bonsai.   I made cufflinks and this little bonsai ornament.
Bonsai,3dz8e4,small_trunks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:00:21 2015 UTC,Those cufflinks are beautiful. I really like the little ornament as well. I'm super into miniatures so this kind of stuff is great.
Bonsai,3dxdbl,seuche23,5,Mon Jul 20 09:06:15 2015 UTC,Can we have a before photo? The way you've styled it looks very 2 dimensional. How does it look from the side? There's a lack of foliage close to the trunk. Did you cut it off? It's very young and small still - probably needed to grow more before you tried styling it. It needs to be outside for it to survive.
Bonsai,3dxdbl,peter-bone,4,Mon Jul 20 09:17:22 2015 UTC,Here's a few more photos.  http://imgur.com/VKCP1pD http://imgur.com/Zdf0WD5 http://imgur.com/XxP4o0a http://imgur.com/1az8Tca
Bonsai,3dxdbl,yessica0o0,5,Mon Jul 20 09:41:42 2015 UTC,Missed you at the Tucson Bonsai Society meeting yesterday. Wiring is one of those things that is ways easier to explain and understand if it is being taught in person. You should cut off the wire you've applied today and try again after watching a tutorial. This one is free from craftsy.
Bonsai,3dxdbl,yessica0o0,3,Mon Jul 20 15:30:57 2015 UTC,Took some advice rewired the tree. Probably will take me a bit more practice to get this down. Also got rid of the stones.
Bonsai,3dxdbl,yessica0o0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:39:33 2015 UTC,That's definitely an improvement. Are you keeping it inside?
Bonsai,3dxdbl,yessica0o0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:12:04 2015 UTC,"No, I just bring it in if I'm working on it."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,-music_maker-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:22:01 2015 UTC,Perfect! I think we may be planning a bonsai basics class sometime soon. Think you might be interested in attending?
Bonsai,3dxdbl,ZeroJoke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:25:55 2015 UTC,It's a possibility. Let me know when.
Bonsai,3dxdbl,suspiciousliquid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:01:58 2015 UTC,Will do!
Bonsai,3dxdbl,tesseracter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:20:11 2015 UTC,"Probably will take me a bit more practice to get this down.   Yeah, practice makes perfect. In the wiki, there is a link to an online copy of a John Naka book called Bonsai Techniques I. There's a good chapter on wiring in there."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,suspiciousliquid,-21,Tue Jul 21 19:37:59 2015 UTC,"Looks terrible.  1) Your wiring is excessive, you've wrapped it too tight.  2) You didn't do anything with the wiring or induce any movement.  3) This is not how junipers or old conifers grow.   On a side note, what the hell is in your pot? Take out all that moss and the gravel. I'd clip off all the wire (don't try to uncoil it, you can damage the bark) and start over."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,TotaLibertarian,8,Mon Jul 20 10:04:56 2015 UTC,Comments like these are why I unsubbed
Bonsai,3dxdbl,amethystrockstar,8,Mon Jul 20 13:06:22 2015 UTC,"It's good to have a variety of opinions. Honestly, you can expect quite a few poor stylings before you get good, and the comment, while terse, does tend toward being constructive.  Your comment, on the other hand, offers no constructive feedback on how to improve the commenters style and quality of feedback. Why do you dislike his comment? Was it the immediate ""looks terrible"" producing a negative response off the bat? that's the part that I dislike, the entire post would be better without it and it would still say the same thing."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,guyatwork37,13,Mon Jul 20 13:55:03 2015 UTC,It is just starting out by saying 'it's terrible' puts an overall negative connotation on the whole comment and is unnecessary. Putting down someone takes away from the constructiveness of the criticism.
Bonsai,3dxdbl,TotaLibertarian,-9,Mon Jul 20 13:59:00 2015 UTC,The fact is it is terrible.
Bonsai,3dxdbl,guyatwork37,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:04:50 2015 UTC,That's what you just did though.  You just brushed away their comment with a negative statement and left it at that. At least the commenter had actual information and constructive criticism in their comment
Bonsai,3dxdbl,TotaLibertarian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:16:07 2015 UTC,"I suppose the better way to start of the original comment would be something like:  ""Here are my thoughts about improving what you have done:""  The content is fine, but the starting line is rough for beginners.  That being said, OP should just focus on the bullet points and not the opening comment in this case."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,guyatwork37,-4,Mon Jul 20 17:01:52 2015 UTC,"Obviously those were his thoughts on how to improve it. He asked how he did, the answer to the question is terrible."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,MSACCESS4EVA,7,Mon Jul 20 17:13:06 2015 UTC,Well I suppose just be less of a dick about it then.
Bonsai,3dxdbl,amethystrockstar,-7,Mon Jul 20 18:04:52 2015 UTC,"Fuck that he wasn't a dick, you're just oh so fucking sensitive. He was blunt and honest, that's it. What are you gonna do when you boss tells you you are underperforming? Cry and run to HR? Wait, yeah that's probable what will happen."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,guyatwork37,8,Mon Jul 20 18:19:48 2015 UTC,"You seem pleasant.    I suppose I don't know what I would do, you're right.  I'm not familiar with that situation because I don't under-perform at my job.  How have you dealt with it in the past?  :D"
Bonsai,3dxdbl,ZeroJoke,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:16:48 2015 UTC,"that's probable what will happen.   Well, that's almost English..."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,suspiciousliquid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:57:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe it was the word ""terrible"" that bothers you? Maybe commentor could have said ""you didn't do well""  I feel like it's all semantics though.  If I did terrible I sincerely hope someone would tell me instead of sugar coating it."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,ZeroJoke,4,Mon Jul 20 19:24:37 2015 UTC,"Probably something like that.  When people are new at something they don't want to be told ""Hey new guy, you fucking suck.  You're awful, go fuck yourself because of how bad you are.""  It discourages them and then makes them now want to do the new thing anymore (as evidenced by the guy who said he's unsubscribed from the sub before).  The argument being laid out here is ""hey, stop posting crappy stuff, we want to see people post good stuff and then discuss accordingly"".  But people won't go from crappy to good if they are run off when trying to learn.  Eventually, you'll end up with a handful of people who just either rip on each other or stroke each other. In either case, the sub dies out accordingly.    I get that people need to hear the truth, but doing so in the manner above just makes new folks jaded and not want to participate.  Like I said, the bullet points are good, but the approach is a little off putting."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,suspiciousliquid,-7,Mon Jul 20 20:15:12 2015 UTC,Feel free to remain so.
Bonsai,3dxdbl,amethystrockstar,9,Mon Jul 20 13:57:38 2015 UTC,"This is what I mean, it makes the sub seem snobbish and unwelcoming"

Bonsai,3dxdbl,Jester217300,4,Mon Jul 20 14:23:04 2015 UTC,As you continue to prove my point...
Bonsai,3dxdbl,TotaLibertarian,7,Mon Jul 20 14:24:29 2015 UTC,"But you're complaining and raising pitchforks and you don't even contribute here. Contribute first, then you can start witch hunting for all the negative posters.  Or just don't post at all because you need another way to learn bonsai. Regular posters and subscribers that contribute here are typically serious about improving... that comes first."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,-music_maker-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:14:45 2015 UTC,Reddit is the only place on the internet where hate for all kinds of minorities is ok but tiny tree critiques are monstrous.
Bonsai,3dxdbl,suspiciousliquid,9,Mon Jul 20 16:01:44 2015 UTC,Just because your critique was true it doesn't mean you weren't a bit of a dick about it. They're not mutually exclusive.   Reddit is just an amplification of real life. If you think those people don't exist in normal life you're being intentionally ignorant. Those thoughts and people also have absolutely nothing to do with this community.
Bonsai,3dxdbl,-music_maker-,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:43:53 2015 UTC,He was blunt that's all.
Bonsai,3dxdbl,TotaLibertarian,6,Mon Jul 20 18:36:06 2015 UTC,"Really? When somebody says ""how'd I do"", they're clearly looking for feedback. While maybe saying ""looks terrible"" isn't the best way to convey that, there are in fact a number of legitimate technical errors that were pointed out here that need to be corrected for optimal results.   Not to be an insensitive clod or anything, but this is /r/bonsai, not /r/hugs. I do have a problem with it if it denigrates into name-calling or personal attacks, but this definitely isn't that."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,amethystrockstar,-3,Mon Jul 20 13:59:35 2015 UTC,But isn't it a general goal of a sub to have many subscribers to share their interest with? Wouldn't you want the comments of the sub to be as constructive as possible so people would feel more comfortable to ask questions and/or get advice? All I'm trying to say is the comment could have been written in a better way.
Bonsai,3dxdbl,MSACCESS4EVA,7,Mon Jul 20 14:12:13 2015 UTC,"This isn't /r/AdviceAnimals. Bonsai is a long term craft, with many layers of experience. Our goal as a bonsai subreddit is to cultivate an inclusive space for people to learn and improve their bonsai skills. Since there are many skills related to growing bonsai, and many levels of skill, we try to give each person the level of feedback they need.  As people stay on the sub for about a month or so, they notice trends of novices, and the repetition can be frustrating. We try to be inclusive for those people too, they can be very valuable for more skilled growers, but a bit harsh for beginners who haven't done much research into the goals of bonsai. If they get personal, the mod team will step in and take action.  I think the OP's tree looks like a topiary in training. I don't have much information though, so I leave those sorts of comments to deep comments like this one. There are good ways to make comments, and we try to guide people towards that too."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,I_tinerant,6,Mon Jul 20 14:24:22 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't you want the comments of the sub to be as constructive as possible   Yes, I would, and yes, I do. And if you go and read my posting history, you'll see that I go out of my way to offer positive, constructive advice whenever I personally give it.   But I can't control how other people express their thoughts, nor would I want to. When folks do cross the line, I'm not shy about publicly pointing it out. But I will say that I think people do get excessively offended about comments here, and this thread is a good example of that.   Not defending any bad behavior, but for crying out loud, these are strangers on the Internet posting from thousands of miles away. Either take the feedback or don't, but don't take it personal. =)  If somebody is going to throw out blunt advice vs. having to take the time to wordsmith every single word they say and maybe not posting as a result, I'd take the blunt advice every time."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,small_trunks,0,Mon Jul 20 14:38:04 2015 UTC,"No the goal is to share knowledge of the art of bonsai, not be the most populous sub of ass lickers."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,I_tinerant,4,Mon Jul 20 15:07:06 2015 UTC,We do have subscribers and we do learn from criticism. If you can't handle criticism you really shouldn't be seeking advice or to improve your skills. Not every bit of negative feedback needs to be carefully wrapped up into positive sounding euphemisms
Bonsai,3dxdbl,small_trunks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:11:42 2015 UTC,"isn't it a general goal of a sub to have many subscribers   Not necessarily, I'd think."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,I_tinerant,4,Mon Jul 20 16:02:31 2015 UTC,"Doesnt sound like anyone is saying you (the generic you, not you in particular) shouldn't tell people what they did wrong - Looking at the top-line comment that's generating all this discussion vs your top-line comment, they convey almost identical information but yours is a lot less discouraging.  I think it comes down to whether you think being correct gives you the right to say things however you want.  And I think a lot of folks would prefer to be a part of a community where the answer to that question is 'no.'"

Bonsai,3dxdbl,mister29,8,Mon Jul 20 14:06:41 2015 UTC,"In life, we often fail towards success. Nobody's trying to ""destroy"" anybody here, but rather to help them create the best trees possible. Go back and read the feedback posts from that point of view, and you may think differently. It's definitely not personal, and OP did in fact ask for feedback.   With bonsai, if you do something incorrect, it can literally cost you years of correction time. Isn't it better to get that feedback early?

There's some good links in the side bar on wiring that you will find handy.  As well, have a plan in mind for the tree, there's no point just having a go at it with no plan in mind.  And please, get rid of the dead moss and rocks!"
Bonsai,3dxdbl,SparkyMountain,18,Mon Jul 20 10:32:16 2015 UTC,"Not a bad first attempt, but there are some technical issues you need to correct for next time:  1) Don't prune lower branches. When you do it starts to look like a Dr. Seuss tree (trust me, we've all created one when started out).  Turns out the lower branches are the most important.  2) Prune from the outside in, not the inside out. Reduce branches, and then let them back bud and grow back out. Over time, you end up with a more interesting branch structure that way.   3) We're trying to create realistic, miniature trees. One way to achieve that is to try and mimic how a full sized version of that tree might grow in nature. Juniper just doesn't grow like this in real life.  4) Other folks have mentioned your wiring. This comes with practice, and you should at least re-do what you've done here so it serves a purpose and won't hurt the tree.   Here is a juniper progression for one I've been working on. From where you are now, you can let it grow back out and try again, but as you'll see from the pics, juniper grows pretty slowly. You'll be waiting 4-5 years before it's full again.  Final thing - I probably wouldn't have this in a bonsai pot yet. That's going to slow down growth considerably. Leave it for now, but next spring, slip pot it into a nursery pot and then let it grow out.  Also, I assume you have this outside. Because this won't end well indoors.   While you wait for it to grow, pick up some more material and try another one! You can get raw material for junipers like this at Home Depot for $10-25.  Good luck!"

They were just as rude to me as well when I posted a few months back. The only thing keeping me subscribed is the the information they provide in their wiki. Their is a lot of crap regarding bonsai and bonsai care, their information is the most correct and most detailed as how to keep your trees looking great.   One thing, that is a juniper I believe. They hate junipers here, and not to get your hopes down, but it will probably die. I've owned two, and both have died. They are finicky and to the seasoned bonsai artist, they are not bonsai they are a piece of a shrub. I'm sorry. But, its your plant, I would be careful wiring it up too soon junipers hate life haha. But its a good cheap tree to practice on! Just not beginner friendly. Best of luck"
Bonsai,3dxdbl,Jester217300,3,Tue Jul 21 01:46:07 2015 UTC,"Junipers are actually very beginner friendly, make exceptional bonsai, are loved by most people here, and would be in the top 3 bonsai species of all time.   It's not the species but the quality of the material that matters. This tree is very young and doesn't have characteristics of an ancient tree which is what we all strive for."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,-music_maker-,2,Tue Jul 21 02:25:38 2015 UTC,"Juniper precumbens beginner friendly? How so? The fact that is must be out side year round and see four seasons (this means you must winterize it and keep an eye on it in the cold of winter)? The fact that it does not handle over/under watering well? Nor over/under fertilization? Nor does it particularly like grooming/wiring/styling? Its a very hard tree to keep healthy. Also the tree does not give signs of distress till its too late. By the time the leaves/needles start to turn brown, the tree is already dead.    I'm no bonsai expert, but someone more knowledgeable than me on here stated in another similar post, a Juniper has NEVER won an award in a Japanese Bonsai Convention because the Japanese don't even really consider it Bonsai.   Furthermore, it grows at a snails pace. This means even if you did manage to keep the thing alive and style it, it wouldn't fully mature into a plant that is somewhat bonsai-like until your children's children generation. This, to any beginner will make them bored with the hobby IMO.   I don't know where you got your information but the sidebar really discourages junipers for bonsai. Especially beginners buying them from ""mall"" stores. Ie  the nickname ""mallsai"".   However, with all that said. I like junipers. I like the way they look. I wouldn't buy another one though. Its his plant, and I encourage him to play with it, that's how you learn. Im just trying to head warning of what others have said -not sound like a jerk like others on here."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,Jester217300,2,Tue Jul 21 02:53:40 2015 UTC,"I don't like to be antagonistic but you don't know what you're talking about. All bonsai should be outdoors. There are thousands of world class juniper bonsai. Here is a juniper taking first place at the most prestigious show in Japan. They are most definitely consisted bonsai in Japan. Again, you're confusing quality into an absolutism about an entire genus that is untrue.   Where does the sidebar say not to use juniper at all? It doesn't. We discourage young and inappropriate material like mallsai, of which I'm infinitely aware.   Start with good material and you don't have to wait for the trunk to grow. You can grow sizable juniper branches in a couple of years. I don't find them difficult to water and I fertilize them like every other tree in my garden. No special treatment.   I have a dozen of them that I actually perform bonsai technique on so I do have some idea of what I'm talking about."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,-music_maker-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:27:57 2015 UTC,"Idk, maybe I have my facts mixed up. Maybe he was specifically speaking of the 'Nana' juniper. But I was just conveying others words. They were not my own. As far as being indoor/outdoor. Yes, its a fundamental law of bonsai, trees go outside. But where do beginners or those who buy the type OP has posted place their trees? On desks or windowsills inside.... That was what I meant. You put a Nana inside for one week, its dead. You buy one in the winter and put it in your heated house.... Dead..  For someone whose never really taken care of a plant before, I think junipers are difficult. There are so many other plants and trees that are more forgiving. You can mess up, and still have a tree in a month. When you mess up a juniper the size of OPs, the tree dies.   So I stand by my opinion that Junipers are tough plants. I stand corrected about award winning junipers in Japan.   And yes I am not the bonsai expert but I don't think your looking at my comments in a beginner perspective. What I have said is not good advice for you. You obviously are more knowledgeable than me. But what I got from the wiki and other sources is to stay away from junipers as a beginner. Especially for someone whose never taken care of a plant. For someone like you, obviously they're no problem. For the rest of us who make beginner mistakes, they're hard."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,treehause,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:03:34 2015 UTC,"I don't have any JPN so I can't comment on those. Maybe they're more fussy. Overall the few juniper varieties I have in my garden have been rock sold for me.   I wasn't trying to be a jerk or change your mind and I'm not very good at this myself, I'm really just starting out. Often times repeating information you remember without any personal experience to back it up leads to misinformation. I was just trying to offer an opinion of someone who is working with them. You should buy a $20 juniper from Home Depot with a big trunk. It's fun."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,Jester217300,2,Tue Jul 21 04:24:14 2015 UTC,"I've grown Nanas for years. They can in fact live indoors in a brightly lit window - for an indeterminate, but definitely finite time. I once saw one that lasted about 4 years indoors (this is highly unusual, but 2-3 can happen fairly easily). Eventually they all do die indoors, mostly due to lack of dormancy, and if quickly, it's lack of light. They like bright light, even outdoors.  And no, I don't recommend ever bringing them indoors, just saying they're not as fragile as you think.  But if you keep them outside where they belong, and make sure they don't dry out, they are no more difficult than anything else.  They handle pruning pretty well, and take to wiring very easily. They're also super-cheap, so easy to get a few and practice with them until you can keep one alive for a couple years. That's a learning curve well worth traversing just for the sake of doing it.  And you can take one from very early stages to something that really does in fact start to look like a miniature tree in about 4-5 years.   I need to post this year's updates, but this one went from nothing to something interesting in 4 years, and a year later, it now has a very nice 3-dimensional frame. Another 4-5 years, and it's going to be a pretty cool little tree. That's well within the time range of most other things I grow - I consider all my trees to be 10+ year projects anyway.  So yes, they are slower than some others, but as long as you get a few basics down, they're not as easy to kill as you make out.   When you see people railing against JPN on this sub, it's usually people complaining about the juniper clippings in pots sold as trees everywhere. That's more a reflection on vendors selling immature material as bonsai than it is on JPN as a viable species."
Bonsai,3dxdbl,treehause,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:15:29 2015 UTC,"I'm convinced many vendors don't even positively root JPN cuttings, they just stick them in a pot and hope they sell within a month or two."

Bonsai,3dxdbl,Jester217300,2,Tue Jul 21 04:15:00 2015 UTC,"Nope, not going there! I learned my lesson! :-)     In all seriousness, all needle type Junipers have challenges that are best left as a third or forth tree. Not a first or second one.  Scale-foliage junipers are a completely different story. They respond well to techniques and tolerate a wide range of conditions.      So long way to answer your question, Shimpaku are fine, just about any Juniperus chinensis, is fine as are all the other Junipers with scale foliage.     At the risk of being pedantic the precise way to say this is that junipers in the 'Section' --> 'Juniperus sect. Juniperus' are more challenging that junipers in the Sabina 'Section' e.g 'Juniperus sect. Sabina'     This is the kinda of plant nerdy-ness I really enjoy. After the great Juniper Thread Debacle of 2014, I actual don't comment on posts with JPN in them.    [Edit: typos]"
Bonsai,3dxdbl,-music_maker-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:24:51 2015 UTC,"What is the ratio in bonsai? I would imagine at least 80% of the junipers used are predominately scale foliage. Sabina, Sierra, Shimpaku (and other Chinese junipers), RMJ, California, Utah, One Seed are all used to some degree with native foliage. And I believe they are all scale dominant.   I may be a glutton, but I would easily lump your first 10-20 trees as a first endeavor and ""beginner"" trees. The distinction between first and third doesn't feel meaningful to me.  FWIW I always enjoyed your posts when you were more active before that thread. You're always welcome to comment in depth on my posts.

Without knowing the scale of the display, it's kind of difficult to know which species would best serve the purpose. Around the 4"" mark, there are a handful of davallia/humata/tectaria/doryopteris species that would probably work very well if you can provide high enough humidity. For around 1"" height, there are a number of pyrossia, elaphoglossum, lemmaphyllum, microgramma, bolbitis (heteroclita var. difformis), and davallia (parvula, specifically) that would work. Unfortunately many of the tiniest ferns don't have what most would consider a classic ferny appearance. They also come with the same caveats about humidity as the larger mini ferns. The smallest things you're likely to find that offer the classic fern appearance will likely be mosses. The genera taxiphyllum and thiudium come to mind.   I just wanted to add that these are all tropical plants (minus the thiudium), and would not survive anything even remotely approaching a frost."

I would argue better than retusa for a number of reasons (leaf size, general hardiness), but worse in one specific way, namely that it's susceptible to a nasty disease that is transmitted via infected tools. So I guess you're technically right because they don't sell the one I have commercially any more because of the disease problem they have.   It's too bad really, because they make really nice bonsai."

Bonsai,3dwhaq,Mybabyciv,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:50 2015 UTC,Don't prune anything till the leaves start coming back. After a few weeks you will see which branches died and clean out the dead wood. Romoving these dead leaves allows light to get to the bare branches and stimulate growth.
Bonsai,3dwhaq,Caponabis,0,Tue Jul 21 17:28:15 2015 UTC,"I'm an optimistic, and because i still see green, I say there's a chance.  I have a similar tree, and these are the steps I would take: * Cut off all of the dead leaves/branches * Assuming there are draining holes at the bottom, get a watering tray and just water it from the bottom, keep the tray full - just check to add water to it every day * After watering it for a few weeks, if it takes, you can think about using a couple of drops of fish emulsion or other fertilizer. this should only be done once a month though.  If one of the green leaves is attached to a branch with a lot of dead leaves, just remove the dead leaves and leave the branch intact.  good luck and let us know how it goes!"
Bonsai,3dwhaq,reasonette,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:47:50 2015 UTC,Never water a tree from the bottom.

Bonsai,3dwhaq,Mybabyciv,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:10:09 2015 UTC,"you can soak a tree in water but if you leave water in the tray as you suggested you're going to block airflow. so you want to soak and then let it air out. that's going to make things grow, air is important.  if you want to learn bonsai, you should forget everything you know and stick around.  update your flair so people know where you are and can provide accurate feedback."

Bonsai,3dtoro,TotaLibertarian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:52:51 2015 UTC,Full sun? Is it dry? I don't think disease. Probably struggling to keep new growth alive if you chopped up the roots at collection.

Bonsai,3dtoro,TotaLibertarian,4,Sun Jul 19 16:28:51 2015 UTC,Probably a bad idea to remove those branches in the first year. Generally you just let it recover for the first year. Training comes later.

Bonsai,3dtoro,MSACCESS4EVA,2,Sun Jul 19 16:29:42 2015 UTC,"I've never had a problem with overwatering. But you might consider much more pine bark in your mix to help with water retention, especially with water loving trees like this."

Bonsai,3dtoro,WanderfulRook,2,Mon Jul 20 00:12:14 2015 UTC,This is why I use a much more organic soil.   What percentage organic do you tend to use on newly collected trees?
Bonsai,3dtoro,westernmichstud,2,Mon Jul 20 16:10:07 2015 UTC,"Newly collected trees? I just try to  long woody roots with no feeder roots and leave the root ball intact with the soil it was collected with. Then I fill in the rest with a 1:1:1 ratio of pine bark potting soil and whatever porous grit I have on hand, or even just sand. Haven lost a yamadori yet. I switch out the soil gradually when I repot. I genera do the first repot like 3 years after collection. The trick to getting them to survive is to collect at the right time, get as much roots as possible and to disturb them as little as possible."

Bonsai,3drsco,small_trunks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:00:17 2015 UTC,I would like it roughly the size it is or maybe smaller (20 inches currently). It has been in that pot only for a few months this summer and was grown initially in the ground.
Bonsai,3drsco,small_trunks,2,Sat Jul 18 21:48:44 2015 UTC,"What you have right now is colloquially known as a ""stick in a pot"" - a young sapling prematurely planted in a pot in the hope that this will somehow transform itself overnight into a mighty bonsai. That's not how it works, that doesn't work in a pot.   For a tree to look convincing the trunk girth to trunk height ratio needs to be roughly in the range 1:6 to 1:12, with certain exceptions for literati style.  so, if you want a tree 20 inches tall, the trunk needs to be between 2 and 3.5inches thick.   Read these:    http://www.bonsaiempire.com/blog/bonsai-trunk-creation http://www.growingbonsai.net/why-trunks-grow-thick/"
Bonsai,3drsco,Fluxiepoes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:19:32 2015 UTC,"so low branches, even if not needed in the final design, are important to create taper?  (I think I'm beginning to get it :) )"
Bonsai,3drsco,small_trunks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:35:10 2015 UTC,Yes - the low foliage will thicken the base of the tree - which is often more important than taper. If the top of the tree grows less strongly (by pruning) than the lower part - you'll get taper.  Go read this.

Bonsai,3dqbo1,Puuhinen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:25:28 2015 UTC,"Starting from seed is not recommended. Put the seedlings aside, water them occasionally and take another look at them 10 years from now.  In the meantime, go to a nursery and buy some proper trees with fat trunks and lots of low branches. Check our wiki for more."
Bonsai,3dqbo1,iAmYourPoison,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:52:45 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm a total noob myself but from previous posts I want to let you know that the pros here don't recommend starting from seed, and they would point you towards /r/gardening. Also, I remember that one of them said that not every tree is meant for bonsai, might not completely relate here but it's something that stuck with me. If you're really itching to start, go to a nursery and look around for interesting looking trees, or anything to practice on (something I still have to do myself while waiting for another tree to grow more branches). I hope this helps!"
Bonsai,3dqbo1,-music_maker-,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:53:19 2015 UTC,"Also, I remember that one of them said that not every tree is meant for bonsai   That's why people who do grow from seed grow a lot at once. A bunch will die on you within a few years, and of those that remain, so will naturally have better features than others. You could plant 50 seeds and maybe get a couple good trees out of the experiment in the end.   That's why those seed kits are such a scam.

Bonsai,3dqbo1,-music_maker-,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:05:46 2015 UTC,"You should read the wiki on growing from seeds. TL;DR it's harder than you think and isn't how we typically create bonsai (we grow large and bushy, then chop), so you may want to also get some more established material to practice bonsai on in the meantime.  That said, if they are healthy, a little fertilizer shouldn't hurt anything. If you're not sure, use half the recommended amount. Half-strength is pretty unlikely to harm anything.  We actually discuss this a lot, so if you search this sub for ""seeds"", you'll find a lot of previous discussions (be sure to wear your thick skin for this exercise =)."
Bonsai,3dpnvv,small_trunks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:04:37 2015 UTC,Just spotted this - the price is right but not sure what the shipping costs will be but Zelkova Serrata are relatively quick growing elms and make desirable bonsai.

Dracaena are pretty easy to take care of, and I would suggest bringing this down in size by at most, 1/3 of its current height.  It's long and skinny because it isn't receiving enough light."
Bonsai,3dqxh9,charlesbronson05,2,Sat Jul 18 17:36:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I realize calling this a bonsai is quite a stretch, but you've gotta start somewhere. Anyways to solve this issue of not enough light should I keep it outside until I shorten it?"

Really any tropical plants should be put outside in the summer to strengthen them.  Kept indoors all the time won't allow it to thrive.  Your plant doesn't need full sun, and shouldn't be moved to an exposed area right away, especially now at the height of summer heat and sun."

Bonsai,3dng9j,Jester217300,3,Fri Jul 17 18:25:59 2015 UTC,"It is very long however this tree will live in here (or some variation) for about 6-7 years at least so it will grow into it. :) This along with another satsuki and 5 tridents are planted this way. I may pull a few of the tridents out next year and wrap the long roots around a rock and create a root over rock with them. Again, all of this is experimental on my part. Worth a try though."
Bonsai,3dng9j,I_tinerant,3,Fri Jul 17 18:37:02 2015 UTC,"Interesting--yeah as I said responding to Kaffine, the ratio of exposed root:above ground tree is what I thought was different / interesting, given that most of these that i've seen seem to be closer to a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio.

Bonsai,3dng9j,ellthebag,2,Fri Jul 17 20:15:17 2015 UTC,Perhaps but remember that this tree will continue to grow for another 5-6 years and I will then be exposing it slowly from there... I can always root prune if I want it shorter on the roots still in the soil.

Exposing the roots will weaken the tree so I wouldn't expect this to go gangbusters and develop a huge trunk on an already slow growing species."
Bonsai,3dng9j,-music_maker-,3,Fri Jul 17 19:26:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I also, I see no reason that I can't just root prune the very bottom if I want to make it shorter in a few years since I am only exposing .5 inch or so per season in the coming years."

Bonsai,3dng9j,bruddahmacnut,2,Fri Jul 17 20:35:19 2015 UTC,This looks like a clever way to do this. The classic textbook way is to use a tall wooden box that can be deconstructed layer by layer over time to expose the roots as they grow.

Bonsai,3do9ft,Daniel_j_i_p,2,Sat Jul 18 17:24:09 2015 UTC,"Crack through the bark and start a new shoot? That sounds like a tree allright ;).  Olives usually shoot new stuff from the bottom first in case of stress, don't worry about it.  The cluster of five new shoots will eventually swell up your tree there and since you have two dominant branches there you can remove the others and still have two to have a choice from later - depends on which fits your design best. Only on these areas where your taper may be messed with you do this - more growth is more happy in general.  Don't wire new growth now - wait until it has hardened off to not damage it.  Olives like to dry out, so yes change your soil eventually, not now since you have messed with it enough for this year. But next year you can do it in spring to summer and it won't mind.  I think you chopped it up quite nicely, but the middle trunk is quite long I think for a branch of that thickness in that area, would have done that a bit shorter.  And next time apply the clay like cut paste that you can scrape off on cuts and do it with a bit more precision ;).  Now remove a couple of shoots from that cluster and wait and see what it does between now and next summer!"
Bonsai,3do9ft,TotaLibertarian,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:58:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah had come to that conclusion on the cut paste - I used what I had and then basically immediately thought 'that was a mistake'  Thanks for the info!  When you say to wire later, is that like wire this august, or wire next year?  And I completely agree on the first branch length now that I look at it.  Something to fix going forward."
Bonsai,3do9ft,TotaLibertarian,2,Sat Jul 18 17:26:08 2015 UTC,"That can be fixed next year before the big flush of growth. Wire, I don't think you get frost?

You don't have to wire it tightly either. You just want to get it in the general area of your design. If you wire now you won't stress the tree and you can take off the wire as soon as it hardens off."
Bonsai,3do9ft,Daniel_j_i_p,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:40:01 2015 UTC,"OK this was definitely my intuition, but the general consensus has been wait (though low on the number of observations, so not super confident)  Thanks for the help - can now go forward knowing that at least someone who knows what they're doing thinks this is the way to go."
Bonsai,3do9ft,TotaLibertarian,3,Sun Jul 19 19:01:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't grow olives due to my climate but I know a bit about carpentry and olive wood seems like it would be stubborn as hell. If you have green shots now get them pointed the way you want and you won't have to worry about training them later. Just remember, be careful, you don't want to knock off leaves and you definitely don't want wire marks."
Bonsai,3do9ft,TotaLibertarian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:43:26 2015 UTC,Olive wood does get really stubborn - but that's only after it get's thicker over time (as with many species). For a year wiring is a delight and then... a job of much patience.   So there's definitely a window between the hardening off and the wood getting to stubborn.

As mentioned, just be really careful not to damage the new growth.   Also, as for your clump of branches - they're not hurting anything right now, but I would watch it closely and take action if you think it's about to cause a problem. If you're not sure which branch you want, you can always shorten the strongest ones a bit and let them all grow a little bit longer until you decide."

I already pinched the tops of two that were outpacing everything else.  What kinds of things would you think about / worry about in terms of the suckers causing a problem?
Bonsai,3dn8pc,iamtheuniballer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:24:24 2015 UTC,"Next year I will decandle in July not June so that the new buds and needles harden off closer to the first freeze we get in my area. This will help with needle length. If I plan 120 days (some do 90) out from the first freeze, needles will be smaller."
Bonsai,3dn8pc,guyatwork37,3,Fri Jul 17 17:27:12 2015 UTC,Trunk the size of a soda can?!!?  Nice looking tree sir!  Should you have pulled some more of the older needles?
Bonsai,3dn8pc,guyatwork37,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:36:01 2015 UTC,"no, I left correct amount of pairs of needles. Those will get pulled in the fall. :) If I had pulled more I would have lost all the hormones that they contain which the new buds would not have yet."

Bonsai,3dmpbh,Mybabyciv,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:13:00 2015 UTC,are these usually stocked in garden centres? What characteristics should I be looking for?
Bonsai,3dmpbh,Mybabyciv,2,Fri Jul 17 18:03:26 2015 UTC,I live in Kentucky and have no clue what is stocked in your garden centers. Goto bonsai retailer or look for shops online. The wiki may have some things of interest in that regard. Look for fat trunks. You can always grow the top.
Bonsai,3dmpbh,Daniel_j_i_p,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"Garden centre conifers usually are shit - where I'm at anyway; because they are grown as upright as possible to be used in hedges. I too dreaded conifers, but when you can get your hands on some that are collected or grown with bonsai in mind, a whole new world opens up. I think most conifers grow too slow to start with meh stock, as opposed to broadleaf deciduous species. So, look at some bonsai nurseries!   So far this year I got myself four larches (love them - they are so fast growing and so straight forward!), a yew and a red pine.   Oh if you have timber plantations, what species do they grow? Spruce? If you find some a couple of years old, you can bend them in a crazy shape and let them grow out for a while to get your own conifers grown with bonsai in mind. Collect in early spring."
Bonsai,3dmpbh,-music_maker-,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:40:05 2015 UTC,"I'd consider starting with a larch. It is deciduous (which makes it somewhat unusual), and is a great conifer to start with. I don't usually see them at garden centers, but you can probably find one at either Bonsai West or New England Bonsai (and probably other bonsai shops if you aren't near those).  If you want something easier to find, or just some quick practice, get a juniper procumbens nana. You can find those almost anywhere and they're really cheap."

Bonsai,3dmpbh,ellthebag,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:10:23 2015 UTC,Larch. There are entire forests of these in the UK. Many in North Yorkshire - and literally hundreds of thousands of collectable seedlings/young trees to be had.   Larch forests are easy to spot - the bright green needles and the small stuff grows around the edges on footpaths and in ditches.
Bonsai,3dl3eb,nowman55,2,Fri Jul 17 03:36:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know that these really make good plants for bonsai, but you might want to take your inspiration from some schefflera or Ming aralia, as those will have similar growth habits."
Bonsai,3dl3eb,charlesbronson05,2,Fri Jul 17 03:55:46 2015 UTC,People generally buy them because they already look like a groove of trees. This doesn't mean they make particularly convincing bonsai.
Bonsai,3dl3eb,small_trunks,2,Fri Jul 17 09:22:29 2015 UTC,"I'm just getting back into this hobby after a 15 year hiatus, so take what I say with a grain of salt. That said, there's not much to lose from having some fun with this tree and you could get some good practice. I recently found a tree much like yours languishing in the back of a nursery. It was severely root bound but it had a decent trunk (the trunk on your tree looks good, too, IMO).   I picked it up for $10 because the guy at the nursery knew it was struggling. I took it home and got to work. First step- take it out of that pot and gently remove all of the dirt. ALL of it. You don't want to bare-root certain species but mine's doing fine, and it's important because the next step is to start exploring the trunk/roots which are below the surface of the dirt in that pot. Often times you'll find some good stuff going on just under the surface, like a widening of the trunk or some attractive nebari (roots) which weren't previously visible. In my case, the nebari were freaking cool and it totally changed my plans for the tree. To really get a good look at the stuff below the soil you will probably have to sacrifice some smaller roots- try to rake them away without damaging the trunk, and try to maintain enough feeder roots lower down to keep the tree happy.  Repot it and work some bonsai soil around the roots that are left. Water the hell out of it and stick it in a clear trash bag for a week or two to help with moisture loss during the summer. Keep it in a shady spot as well.  I don't know how much I'll be able to accomplish with the foliage/branches of this species, but the end result of my work was a really neat little tree for $10. I'm planning to post pics of the stock I've collected, including the aforementioned tree, but work calls...  Good luck and have fun!  Edit- one thing I haven't learned yet is the patience to wait for the correct season before I do things (repot, collect trees, etc.). I think I'll learn patience after I kill a few trees by doing things out of season :) I suggest you look up some species- specific guidelines for repotting because you want your tree to be strong enough to survive the winter."
Bonsai,3dl3eb,WorkLessPlayMore,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:01:56 2015 UTC,"As this being my first tree I collected, I don't want to risk killing the tree. I'm afraid that the crazy heat (100+) here in South Carolina may kill the plant, so I may have to muster up the patience to wait until spring.   The only problem with repotting is... I haven't been able to find a bonsai pot at any local nurseries. Do you know where I could find some pots, or is Amazon a good place to order from?"

Bonsai,3dl3eb,Mybabyciv,3,Fri Jul 17 13:57:41 2015 UTC,"It already was a landscape pant for many years, and as a novice knowing nothing about bonsai at the time I put it in a large pot. This has been more of an experiment to try to keep something alive more than it is bonsai."
Bonsai,3dl3eb,vdread,2,Fri Jul 17 14:07:37 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't practice basketball by hitting a tennis ball. There are plenty of other great landscape plants to use as bonsai-pines, junipers, box, even holly. The trick with bonsai is not only to grow in a pot, but to use the correct soil and the correct specimen. Growing an establish landscape plant in an oversized pot is a cakewalk compared to some bonsai. Nurseries have already experimented for you, they grow in plastic containers almost exclusively."
Bonsai,3di1w1,haventredit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:10:49 2015 UTC,"OK, b but they're far too wide. The branches need to be narrow with a group planting."

Bonsai,3di1w1,small_trunks,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:54:54 2015 UTC,Wide branches with skinny trunks is a typical characteristic of a juvenile tree and that's exactly the image you are trying to avoid...  trees growing in groups in nature do not have the space to grow wide - and since we are trying to emulate a natural scene we must make them narrower
Bonsai,3di1w1,Kaffine69,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:01:26 2015 UTC,Looks like you will need some smaller trunks to add in there.
Bonsai,3di1w1,small_trunks,3,Thu Jul 16 16:46:12 2015 UTC,"The problem is that they're all the same size.  A multi tree planting involves tricks of scale and perspective.  You'll plant them in some elongated triangle pattern with one forward, one back, and the middle guy between the two (not exactly between, of course). But where's the sense of depth if they're all the same size?  There are a couple of differing approaches to what tree should be the largest and where it should lie on the plane.  None of the approaches I've seen involve three trees of the same size."

Olives experience a mild dormancy which your climate should be able to offer it. You can repot in summer but it's best to treat this sub-tropical species like a temperate tree for repotting and do it as it wakes up. Fertilize well. The following summer I'd start layering all of the trunks off. You could try taking them as cuttings if you want but if you have the time I'd just layer them. Use the trunks to make a forest planting when they have recovered and have their own root system. When you get budding lower on the remaining stumps you can work it into a clump and add in more movement and taper.  I think the advantage of this approach is using different strengths in each planting. The straight trunks will look decent in a forest but less decent in a clump. Really, really great material."

As far as the styling, there are a lot of threads that discuss these types of Juniper cuttings that I would recommend you read. I think you removed the foliage in the wrong places - you want to keep it compact, close the trunk. Otherwise it creates the pom-pom look with bare branches and pads far away from the trunk. You might be able to wire some curves into the branches to get the foliage closer to the trunk."

I kinda panicked when I started reading, figured it was already too late (since it's summer)...but wanted to try anyways.  As for the cuttings, I def don't want poms poms.  But I did not want it grow into a bushy tree.  Something I read said the Junipers are good at making different levels, so I tried to go for some movement and isolate a few areas.

Bonsai,3dihch,small_trunks,4,Thu Jul 16 17:21:19 2015 UTC,"I disagree.   I think there's at least educational value in growing it back out. There may or may not be a tree in there somewhere, but in 4-5 years there will be a whole new set of branches that started on this frame. I could see at least the lower part of the trunk and first branch being part of something better.   Agreed that it's definitely doing it the slow way, and agreed that OP should also get another one and try again, but I don't agree that it's ruined beyond repair.

I still say you can do both. When you don't already have 50+ trees, every tree is a brand new learning experience. Doesn't hurt anything to keep the little one alive while starting again. Practically zero extra effort.  You're obviously way beyond needing to do this exercise, but for a beginner, keeping alive something you pruned is a skill in itself. Even if just to learn first-hand how pruning slows down the process dramatically, and getting to watch how new branches develop after such a pruning."

One option would be to put the whole thing in a clear plastic bag to increase humidity. Another option is to place the whole pot in water and gradually lower the water level over several weeks. Place in the shade. It may be too late though. You should have put it in the ground or a large pot rather than a bonsai pot. It's a long way from being ready to go into a bonsai pot.

Over watering involves the factors that determine how quickly that water drains and how quickly the soil dries. In other words, you can't really over water a plant by saturating the soil, but you can by watering it again before the soil dries sufficiently."
Bonsai,3dij44,small_trunks,3,Thu Jul 16 17:10:46 2015 UTC,When was it collected? Was it just put in that bonsai pot no recovery? I'm thinking its a goner. When pines look like this all is bad

Bonsai,3dfmbq,Its_Avoiderman,3,Wed Jul 15 22:01:57 2015 UTC,Love the carving!  I really like the basic structure you've set and the carving is going to look awesome.   Is your plan to incorporate the carving in the final design or try to hide it as much as possible?
Bonsai,3dfmbq,ellthebag,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:38:54 2015 UTC,I have a silver birch almost identical to this. I shall monitor this thread for ideas.
Bonsai,3dfmbq,WanderfulRook,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:00:00 2015 UTC,I think it is too tall by a third to a half. Let it recover and then chop is my answer.
Bonsai,3dfmbq,WanderfulRook,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:06:08 2015 UTC,Wow. Interesting. Where exactly would you chop it?
Bonsai,3dfmbq,-music_maker-,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:12:50 2015 UTC,Depends on the growth you get in recovery. Approx 1/3 of the way down from the existing chop.
Bonsai,3dfmbq,WanderfulRook,3,Thu Jul 16 13:36:01 2015 UTC,"Not every tree has to be a shohin. The way the trunk is carved, I'd be hesitant to chop any further any time soon. I'd just let it grow in for at least 2-3 seasons, and then see what I had to work with. I think this could work at it's current size, or maybe it does eventually need another chop, but it's going to need a more developed upper trunk & branches regardless (either for the design, or to get it healthy enough to chop again).   I think this could be really good as a taller tree once it's more developed."
Bonsai,3dfmbq,-music_maker-,2,Thu Jul 16 14:50:19 2015 UTC,"True.  That said, I feel like it would be a stronger tree if it was shorter.  I could be wrong, or it could just be my opinion.  Like I said, I wouldn't do anything till it had a bunch more growth on it.  In the 6-12 months it takes to get that I might change my mind."
Bonsai,3dfmbq,WanderfulRook,2,Thu Jul 16 17:20:58 2015 UTC,"In the 6-12 months 2-3 years it takes to get that   FTFY   That said, I feel like it would be a stronger tree if it was shorter.   I just don't think one can know yet. I never style based just on what I see before me, but how I think it's going to grow over the next 3-5 years.   I find myself changing my mind on styling decisions 5-6 times in a year as I watch it grow out, and that's for stuff way more established than this.   In this case, letting it keep all these branches for a while, but not letting any one of them get too long is pretty likely to encourage a whole bunch of back-budding over several years. Some of your keeper branches definitely haven't grown yet, and will likely be in places on the trunk that would otherwise get chopped off if we made a rash decision rather than just containing the growth to a particular area for awhile.  I think a few years could really grow it into a credible somewhat taller tree. Worst case, it will be a strong pre-bonsai with better branches that will be strong enough to help handle the chop."
Bonsai,3dfmbq,-music_maker-,0,Thu Jul 16 17:47:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why this is still going.  We both agree that it needs to grow for at least a year, that we may/probably will change our minds at least once in that period, and that it might need to be chopped at a future date.    I didn't say chop to chop it today.  He asked for ideas, and I gave mine.  Leave me alone unless you think I am endangering the plants health."

I see you decided to go with the bonsai pot so it must be pretty close to your desired structure. it just doesn't look that healthy to me, could be because you just gutted it like a farm animal though. I guess I would just trim back the lower branches and the top a bit."
Bonsai,3dfmbq,small_trunks,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:08:49 2015 UTC,haha. I had not really attended to it at all and then recently defoliated it so you are seeing almost no new growth yet. Today it is almost covered in leaves. I will let it grow for the next while untouched and pull it out of a bonsai pot next year or maybe slip pot it into a larger grow pot in the fall. I had planned on using the non carved side for my front however I had 2 huge scars at the top and bottom of the trunk and thought it would be interesting to carve it a bit. Thanks for the input.
Bonsai,3dfmbq,small_trunks,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:39:13 2015 UTC,"just curious, why defoliate? and I guess if that's the case it looks pretty healthy actually."

Bonsai,3dh8o1,seuche23,4,Thu Jul 16 06:44:22 2015 UTC,Ficus
Bonsai,3dh8o1,Kaffine69,7,Thu Jul 16 07:30:24 2015 UTC,"In the sidebar the 5th bullet point under ""what kind of tree is this"", looks like a tiger bark ficus. It should be outside when temperatures are above 10 Celsius (50F) and inside in a south or west facing window. These are tropical storm who love sunlight and I would report the cactus into its own pot, they have different watering requirements and it's just competition for root space (/r/succulents have good advice on cactus care).   Learn to keep it alive for a year while you do lots of research on its care and bonsai in general :)"
Bonsai,3dh8o1,manicbunny,3,Thu Jul 16 10:34:41 2015 UTC,"Put the cactus in another pot and don't let the two plants see each other again.  I always work from the base, up.  The trunk comes out of the soil at about 15°.  Too shallow.  Bring that up a bit.  Somewhere past 45°.  After that, you'll need to wire the branches to match the new orientation.  Branches on the left and right both have vertical branches.  These need to be wired down as laterals.  When wiring the branches, be sure to match the movement of the trunk.  If the trunk is curvy, make the branch movement curvy.  Did you wire two branches side-by-side at the top?  I have to ask, because I've never seen anyone do that.  Don't do that.  You want taper on a tree.  Wiring two branches together on a ficus will encourage the branches to fuse together.  This is a bad thing.  Pick one of these two as the apex.  Since this is your first tree, I'll tell you that this is going to develop very slowly in that pot.  If this tree were given to me, I'd likely do much of what I said, PLUS, I would put it in 3-gallon pot and fertilize it like crazy.  I'd pull the wire off after a couple weeks because this ficus will grow like crazy and the wire will begin to bite quickly.  Then I'll pack it in the greenhouse with others like it and keep it all moist.  The tree will begin to drop aerial roots and then it will begin to be something special.  However, you're new to this and the challenge is to just keep it alive. It really should be outside. I don't know what the humidity issue is in Tuscon, but today's forcast if for 40% humidity.  Is that high or low for you?  This tree likes to be moist, but if it completely dries out one day, an aggressive watering campaign will keep the core happy; you may lose twigs, though.    Bring it indoors for the winter when temperatures drop below 40°."

Bonsai,3dfotg,small_trunks,2,Thu Jul 16 11:39:12 2015 UTC,I can't get past that slingshot.  I would cut the left trunk just below the turn and let the right trunk look like it is following the left in movement.  Then I would position the front as in Photo 7.

Good luck! and keep us posted with your progress."
Bonsai,3desba,giz_zmo,7,Wed Jul 15 19:48:42 2015 UTC,"Aspen Populus tremula is not a willow (Salix)  However it is a pioneer tree and not likely to live a thousand years. But they are a bit weird in the sense that they shoot lots of root suckers, and an aspen grove can actually technically be one single tree, and they are the world's oldest living organism with well over 100k years.  I think because of this aspect they are great for a small grove, however you may have issues with unwanted suckers you'll have to remove.  I've no clue how they will react to bonsai practices, but they are definitely hardy and can take quite a lot of strain.   If you do harvest in the wild, it could be useful to get trees that share a root network as it will genetically be the same clone, and that could lead to less issues with roots later on."

Bonsai,3desba,TotaLibertarian,2,Fri Jul 17 01:42:41 2015 UTC,I do not believe they are used for bonsai - I have neither found any photos nor any positive remarks (only negative ones).    When trees are not used it means they are unsuitable - because many thousands of growers will have tried and they still don't show up...therefore rejected as a suitable bonsai species.   There is a list in the wiki of suitable species.
Bonsai,3desba,small_trunks,2,Wed Jul 15 20:01:54 2015 UTC,They are pioneer species usually living for only up to about 75 years. They are hard to wire due to extremely delicate bark. I have one just because it was $3.

Bonsai,3desba,CorriByrne,3,Wed Jul 15 22:00:36 2015 UTC,"I can actually comment on this.  I recently visited Colorado and was very interested to observe the aspen groves.    They have VERY soft bark, the white rubbing off onto skin and a thumbnail easily sinking into them.  For this reason you'll have a bit of a tough time wiring them.    On that note, wiring scars and pruning scars will not easily if ever heal over.  They will turn black and be highly visible.  I would expect lots of dieback from any pruning.   The leaves are beautifully small, they'll probably reduce well if your branch doesn't just die back to the trunk.  Don't expect drastic deadwood.  It isn't hard enough.    You might well be able to collect a tree and then create a grove from the suckers it grows.  I didn't check out how deep the root systems tend to go.    Given that you are in Denver Colorado I think you have MUCH better options.  You have sagebrush EVERYWHERE, and that's the knarliest stuff ever.  I tried to get one to live here, but it died from all the rain we've had.  You also have tons of Potentilla just BEGGING to be collected.  I swear I drooled the whole time I was there.  I might also try a common juniper.  I've never seen those anywhere else.    On the note of being in Denver.  I assume you are familiar with the botanical gardens.  They have a type of pine there that I think was called a painted pine?  I forget.  It's a pine tree with bark like a sycamore.  The most amazing thing I saw the whole trip.    Anyway.  Yeah.  I liked Colorado :)"
Bonsai,3ddfut,Papewaioo,7,Wed Jul 15 12:10:04 2015 UTC,"Part of a reply on this article, by Leo Schordje (whoever that may be, I just want to credit him for the contribution): The old zero nitrogen recommendation for fall feeding came out of 1880’s research done at Kew Gardens, in the UK. This was for vegetable & perennial gardens, outdoors. In the fall, London homes began heating with coal. The acid rain, smog, that made London famous were providing all the nitrogen the vegetable gardens needed. This was good research for its time, but totally misapplied when it was quoted and repeated over and over again in gardening books for the home and hobby growers. The result is that this canard has become “fixed” in the mind set of hobby growers."

Bonsai,3daxt3,TotaLibertarian,3,Thu Jul 16 23:36:30 2015 UTC,"Oh no, an olive tree... and a damn nice one too, now I'll have to reply...   Look at a big olive tree and then look at yours. Do you see straight branches on the big one? Not if it's a really beautiful one - they will go up in a smooth curve and then horizontal to down-ish in a curvy fashion.  Going from straight to curvy will be your first task. This will bring your lowest branch closer to the trunk which is nice, and gives you the opportunity to get some more 3d-branching going on. Bring out a heavy gauge wire because olive branches are tough when they are older, and go slow - gradually, one bit of movement every couple of days, because they have a tendency to just snap. Wood glue/superglue is your friend, if it happens...   From there it is growing ramification to fill out the form, but I wouldn't do it in the pads you suggested because they frankly look like an overstyled garden tree.   A good old olive is bushy and curvy and yours has the potential to get there!"
Bonsai,3dccxi,Thenandonlythen,2,Wed Jul 15 04:08:08 2015 UTC,Looks good.  When it's collected you'll probably need to do another chop to further shorten the trunks.

Bonsai,3d96q3,small_trunks,2,Tue Jul 14 14:06:07 2015 UTC,Comment here additional ones and I'll add the best.
Bonsai,3d96q3,peter-bone,4,Tue Jul 14 14:06:32 2015 UTC,What's the difference between do 1 and 7?  Do read books and websites to gain knowledge.  Do learn about the specific requirements of the species you have.  Do use free draining inorganic substrate.  Don't repot or collect trees in the growing season.  Don't attempt to make your bonsai look good all year round. Allow them some free growth periods.  Don't feed a sick tree.
Bonsai,3d96q3,Jester217300,3,Tue Jul 14 14:25:59 2015 UTC,"Don't repot or collect trees in the growing season.   Not true for all species.    Don't feed a sick tree.   Not true at all.   https://www.evergreengardenworks.com/fertiliz.htm   Another common bonsai myth is that sick or recovering plants, or newly transplanted bonsai should not be fertilized. The analogy is that it will over feed the patient or is the equivalent of over dosing with vitamins. I think the proper analogy should be that feeding at half strength or not all is analogous to not taking your medicine, vitamins and nutrition when you are sick.  The recommended strength is designed to produce a soil solution of fertilizer salts at a specific range of electrical conductivity. In this range it is very easy for plants to pick up the various N,P, and K ions. It doesn't matter if the plant is a seedling, newly rooted cutting, newly root pruned bonsai, or recovering plant. They all will pick up nutrients more easily if fed in this range.  Roots are roots. Probably the most tender roots you will ever come across are the newly formed adventitious roots on a cutting. These are very fleshy and extremely fragile. I have fertilized my newly rooted cuttings (and seedlings) for years with full strength soluble fertilizers and they have all thrived. In fact, they quickly show chlorosis if I don't feed them at this level.  There is no evidence of which I am aware that fertilizer will interfere with the process of regeneration of roots. The belief that fertilizer 'burns' young and tender roots cannot be substantiated. Fertilizer is necessary for the health and growth of roots as well as foliage. If new roots cannot find fertilizer from the soil solution, the plant will rob nutrients from existing tissues to fuel new growth. This doesn't sound like a formula for recovery to me.  Research has shown that new roots are often found encasing beads or chunks of pure solid fertilizer. If there were a problem with localized 'burning', there would be a 'dead zone' around such chunks, not fresh new roots. I am not arguing for more fertilizer here, just the continuation of a reasonable fertilizer schedule. Over fertilizing causes a whole new set of problems.  It is my experience that it is important to get a plant back into good growing conditions as soon as possible following transplantation, root pruning, or a root problem. Allowing a plant to languish in the dark without food may relieve light and temperature stress, but does nothing to promote new growth. I firmly believe it is important to maximize all the elements of good growth and nutrition as soon as possible in these situations without inducing stress. This includes allowing the plant to dry slightly before watering, fertilizing on a regular schedule, keeping the soil warm, introducing the plant to increasing light levels as soon as it can tolerate it, and allowing for good air circulation.  There is a careful balance to optimizing these conditions without inducing new stresses, but the reward is to push the plant out of danger by returning it to healthy growth as soon as possible.  This half strength fertilizer myth is pervasive in bonsai books and culture. Even many nurseryman espouse it. I think what is at work here is that people read bonsai books and repeat what they have read and heard without really stopping to think about it, or doing some intelligent research. Put me in this group as well. Even though I have fed my seedlings and cuttings at full strength for years, until recently, I too fertilized at half strength on the advice of bonsai books. Then I started taking a hard look at the results, which were disappointing. I now treat my bonsai as what they are: container plants."

Bonsai,3d96q3,ZeroJoke,2,Tue Jul 14 14:41:08 2015 UTC,"Don't feed your tree coffee. (someone was doing this the other day,  when collecting trees, don't grab it by the trunk and jerk it around with a delicate species or a very promising specimen, this breaks the little feeder roots.   its probably best to take a large ball, do not disrupt the soil and disturb the roots closest to the base and lift underneath the ball if at all if possible. For the first year just to play it safe, plant the native soil in the ground or container and add the bonsai soil below and above the ball. I've had great success bare rooting and spraying all soil off the roots with a hose with almost all the trees I collected, except for the one tree with the most potential which I liked most."
Bonsai,3d96q3,Jester217300,3,Tue Jul 14 15:02:45 2015 UTC,"DO try to collect yamadori (properly and legally).

I often try to leave a branch alone until it's about to actually screw up my trunk/branch design, or until it's getting too far ahead of everything else. Then it needs to go, or at least be shortened and allowed to back-bud.  I've had cases where I thought something needed to go, and then after a year or two of letting it grow out, I decided that not only did it not need to go, but that it was an important part of the tree now."

Bonsai,3d96q3,PartOfTheTree,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:20:45 2015 UTC,"For growing out material that just needs to develop, I've really settled into the mindset of setting an initial scale, and then just loosely enforcing it until the next major styling, typically at least 3-4 years in the future.   So, I create a frame, and then let the tree grow into that frame. If something goes beyond the boundary I've set, I'll rectify it in the fall or spring, unless the summer growth is so strong that it may screw up something I'm working on, in which case I'll shorten the branch a bit to slow things down.  I usually hold off on making any major decisions until spring pruning time. 3-5 years of mostly just pruning to keep the growth in check and at scale usually yields something pretty interesting with a lot of styling options."

My point goes to the people who live and die by the Japanese rules of bonsai.  When they judge a tree, they wonder what would an artist from Japan think of the tree.  They go back to Naka's book and hold it up to the tree and start measuring and doing ratios.  The more I think of it, the more my claustrophobia kicks in.  There is more to the art of miniature trees than is known by the good people of Japan.  African bonsai styles are a great example of representing trees found in nature that are not found in Japanese gardens.  Here in the United States, flat-top bald cypress are a famous example of how a majestic and ancient tree can stand the Japanese triangle on it's head."

If you can satisfy this light demand, then there are a few tropical species I can recommend: 1) Gmelina philippensis 2) Ficus salicaria 3) Neea buxifolia 4) Sageretia theezans 5) Premna sp.  It's much easier to work with outdoor bonsai that is suitable for USDA zone 7-10, but if you are itching for indoor work, try one of the five above.  I'd really advise against it though since you're a beginner."
Bonsai,3dbvpk,ZeroJoke,2,Thu Jul 16 05:29:52 2015 UTC,"Outside. Always, always outside."
Bonsai,3dbvpk,small_trunks,4,Wed Jul 15 03:39:38 2015 UTC,Outside. How can you not find a concrete answer to this?

Bonsai,3dc2vf,halfeclipsed,3,Wed Jul 15 02:43:51 2015 UTC,Put it outside would be the only advice I can give.
Bonsai,3dc2vf,M3k4nism,-1,Wed Jul 15 03:00:39 2015 UTC,I have kept in inside since I've had it in early June and its leaves have continued to grow but I cannot tell yet about the trunk. I try to open the curtain for at least a few hours a day for it but find myself forgetting every now and then.
Bonsai,3dc2vf,M3k4nism,2,Wed Jul 15 03:43:11 2015 UTC,"Trees love to be outside, unless you live in the temperate southern hemisphere and it's the middle of winter try it and it'll have a blast, just water it accordingly. I'm no expert but you won't get much trunk growth in such a small pot, either put in a bigger one or better still in the ground, alternatively brace yourself with patience."
Bonsai,3dc2vf,small_trunks,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:57:33 2015 UTC,"I will definitely try this, thank you. Will the trunk grow more quickly if I have it in a bigger pot? What about putting it outside?"
Bonsai,3dc2vf,halfeclipsed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:32:51 2015 UTC,"That's some kind of juniper so it's a temperate tree that will require dormancy during winter, keep it inside and it will die. Your first priority should be to get it outside, in this pot if needs be but at least outside. To achieve optimal growth my guess is your best bet is a to plant it in your garden, your second best option would be a bigger pot."
Bonsai,3dc2vf,peter-bone,3,Wed Jul 15 04:54:46 2015 UTC,"Trees must be outside, many in the middle of winter."
Bonsai,3dc2vf,peter-bone,3,Wed Jul 15 05:27:47 2015 UTC,It should definitely be outside where it can get real sun. But don't put it in direct sunlight since it has been inside. I'm still a beginner so take my advice lightly. Did you cut off those branches laying on the soil/moss?
Bonsai,3dc2vf,small_trunks,0,Wed Jul 15 04:01:59 2015 UTC,"Yes I was trying to prune/style it, I'm not sure I am cutting in the right places."
Bonsai,3dc2vf,TotaLibertarian,5,Wed Jul 15 04:29:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think you should be pruning it at all at this stage. The trunk needs to thicken a lot before it can start looking like a bonsai, and that needs as much foliage as possible (especially low down). Also, don't prune anything until you have a plan of how you want the tree to look.  You shouldn't use zip ties, but even so it seems that you're using them to straighten a branch. Straight branches are not usually desirable in bonsai."
Bonsai,3dc2vf,small_trunks,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:46:54 2015 UTC,Shoot! Do you think my tree will recover?
