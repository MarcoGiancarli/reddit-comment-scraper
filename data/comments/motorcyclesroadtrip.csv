motorcyclesroadtrip,3de77j,xbeefedgex,2,Wed Jul 15 19:45:58 2015 UTC,"I found traveling in the Yucatan area via car to be pretty relaxed. I don't see why it wouldnt be similar on a bike. I have an impression, possibly not based on reality, that the Yucatan area is less useful for the whole war on drug  thing, unlike land borders, and so things are relatively more relaxed.   I still don't know that I would ride at night, but that is as much for safety re: unlit roafs, animals or non-reflective vehicles in the road as much as some kind of safety factor."

To me the north of Mexico seemed ok but still felt unsafe. The rest of mexico seemed safer.  I'm only talking about my gut feeling, without respect for statistics! Had no problem with anyone, other than curiosity from police between Tabasco and Yucatan. Don't drive night... for thousands of reasons.  Be aware of TOPES!!!! They will surprise you at one point, they are placed sometimes where you least expect them, maybe in a hairpin corner... in the middle of a straight road with little or no houses in the desert...

motorcyclesroadtrip,3daz0l,MrGund,2,Wed Jul 15 10:43:39 2015 UTC,In Thailand the best riding is in the north in the mountains. You can start with the Mae Hong Son loop. Base yourself in Chiang Mai. Lots of big bike rental places here. POP Bike Rent is the biggest chain up here. To go over borders is more tricky as you need special permits and license translations.

motorcyclesroadtrip,3da4fq,ZedAvatar,2,Tue Jul 14 18:08:10 2015 UTC,"Started and ended in West Chicagoland, we completed a 6-day loop around Lake Superior.    Day 1: powered up to Duluth, MN. Stayed in a Super 8 and ate dinner at the Thirsty Pagan brewery. Day 2: crossed the border into Canada, stopping at Split Rock Light House and World's Best Donuts in Grand Marais, MN. Camped at Kakabeka Falls Provincial Park, near Thunder Bay. Day 3: Rode through Sleeping Giant Provincial Park (awesome twisty roads!); stopped at Aguasabon Falls. Camped at Neys Provincial Park Day 4: Rode to the Winnie the Pooh museum, checked out some touristy Indian Crafts place, ate an amazing dinner at Salzburger Hof Resort restaurant. Camped at the Pancake Bay Provincial Park Day 5: Crossed the border into the USA at Sault St. Marie, then crossed the Mackinac Bridge to Lower Peninsula Michigan, rode to my parents' house in Suttons Bay.  Day 6: Back to Chicagoland, by way of the S.S. Badger in Luddington, MI. Rather than face the tortuous construction/traffic of lower Michigan and Indiana, we ferried our bikes across Lake Michigan into Wisconsin, and powered our way home.    Amazing trip, we're already planning on doing it again next year, maybe expanding it a bit. The route and stops along the way were found on http://ridelakesuperior.com/.

motorcyclesroadtrip,3cx38l,chicagoose3,5,Sat Jul 11 15:21:44 2015 UTC,Losing master clips is not something that should happen.  You may have been doing them wrong.
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cx38l,YourFairyGodmother,2,Sat Jul 11 16:29:38 2015 UTC,"I've actually read lots of stories of people losing masterlink clips, hence the reason so many people refuse to run anything but rivet-style masterlinks.  I know how to put clips on, and installed the first two exactly as they are supposed to go.  The third one, shown in the picture of the bike on the lift was put on the exact same way by the owner of Interstate Motorcycle Junction in Albert Lea, MN.  He also said it was relatively common and suggested putting a little black silicone on the clip to help secure it in place.  I think I'll probably chalk the lost clips up to running 80-90+ mph all day long over some rougher and bumpier roads than are ideal.  moral of the story: go with a rivet-style whenever possible."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cx38l,AdamTReineke,2,Sat Jul 11 22:46:47 2015 UTC,What the heck happened with that brake? How'd they screw it up that badly and when did you notice? Any damage to the brake rotor?
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cx38l,keylogthis,3,Sat Jul 11 17:26:38 2015 UTC,"What the heck happened with that brake?   The disc is on the outside of the pads.   How'd they screw it up that badly and when did you notice?   They slid the master and pads over the disc and somehow managed to not see it. Honestly, I have no idea how they wouldn't see it, other than a horrible oversight with rushed work and an inexperienced tech maybe. He said that he caught it after two blocks.   Any damage to the brake rotor?   I doubt it, he caught it quickly. You can see some light surface abrasion, but it's probably not bad enough to kill the pads. Either way, you'd run it until you kill these pads and then replace both the disc and pads."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cx38l,socks86,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:39:12 2015 UTC,"u/keylogthis nailed all of it.    When reinstalling the rear wheel with the new tire, they must've just thrown it together without really paying attention.  That or the tech just had no idea what he was doing.  I usually look over all work I have done before riding, but only checked chain tension and not the rear brake before heading out.  Luckily the screeching/grinding was loud enough for me to know something was wrong ASAP.  As for damage, the rotor is indeed a little beat up/cut, but my pads are brand new this winter and braking wasn't affected over the next 1500+ miles.  I'll probably replace, or at least face the rotor this coming winter along with new pads."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cx38l,socks86,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:50:29 2015 UTC,Did the same people who installed your rear wheel also install that clip type master link?
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cx38l,I_Do_A_Thing,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:36:46 2015 UTC,No. I installed the master link clip at home when I replaced the chain in the spring. It ran fine for the first 3500+ miles of the season. After I lost one about 2000 miles into the trip I replaced it with a spare I had with me. Lost that one after about 500 more miles and had to resort to that shop to find a new one. No issues with that one over the next 750 miles so far.
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cx38l,OtherPaleBlueDot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:41:32 2015 UTC,Yeah so you pressed the plates too tight so there was not enough pressure on the clip. That is why your second one only made it 500 miles. Very easy to do.

motorcyclesroadtrip,3cu45l,RoamingBison,5,Fri Jul 10 20:06:12 2015 UTC,Not 100% sure it showed up properly on my phone but I'd consider crossing California more north.  In California you'd have a hard time finding an unpaved road.   I did a similar route down the coast into Vegas but I cross California up and over on the 108 which was an amazing road without the Yosemite traffic stopped then did Death Valley into Vegas. Death Valley was neat and adds to the story. Just do it early.  One of my favourite bike stories is saying I did 300kph 300ft below sea level :)  Plan for a side trip to Crater lake.   The 20 is my favourite way across Washington. Lolo pass is a favourite up and over into Montana. There's a couple other ways to go as well.   Going to the Sun is over rated (to slow) but still a must do. If you have a day around there is be tempted to check out Waterton on the Canadian side. The ride is nice.
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cu45l,Gears_and_Beers,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:33:53 2015 UTC,I talked to one of the guys in my Indian rider group who is from California and he also recommended either 108 or 120 through Yosemite.  Some other guys also highly recommended Lolo pass.  I may skip Glacier depending on how my schedule works out since I have seen it before.  It's still pretty damn nice though.  Either way I need to do Beartooth pass because that is pretty awesome.

motorcyclesroadtrip,3cu45l,Oosikman1525,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:02:20 2015 UTC,I'm probably going to skip Death Valley because it's going to be really damn hot and I live in Las Vegas so I can ride through it on my weekend trips.  I've ridden around the edges of it and it's really desolate.  Nice place to open the bike up too.

I didn't have plans to do a lot of riding elsewhere in NS but that's good to hear I might not be missing out on a huge amount (though I'm sure there are some cool spots). I was thinking of checking out Peggy's Cove but it's not really on the way. If I get there and I have time I will probably add it in though. And I visited halifax a number of years ago and remember it being a cool spot.   I've read a bit about meat cove and that's the impression I was getting. Guess I will play it by ear but hopefully I can make it work! Is it a spot where you just spend a night or is it better to spend more time there?
motorcyclesroadtrip,3ce0xe,kevin_k,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:06:15 2015 UTC,"I took the ferry to Digby from St John and rode counterclockwise.  Some nice views along the Western coast (at the bottom of NS) but going up the SE-facing coast towards Halifax got boring.  I might have checked out Peggy's Cove but it had started to rain so I just went to where I was staying that night, just inland of Halifax.  The next day the weather was still bad so I decided to cut out the planned ride that day to the penninsula ending in Canso and highwayed it instead to Sydney, saving a day to use later.  Glad I did, as the extra day was on Cape Breton and the weather was much better.  Meat Cove is out of the way but it's fun getting there (again, be ready for gravel roads).  If you want to stay there, you'll be camping.  http://oi61.tinypic.com/w88b3s.jpg"
motorcyclesroadtrip,3ce0xe,jtraf,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:59:12 2015 UTC,My biggest concern is the weather but I'm hoping with the amount of time I have it gives me the flexibility to ride when it's decent. It sounds like a cool camping spot but I will have to see how the road goes haha. I've never really done riding on gravel so that might not be the best time to start. But I'll see what it's like when I get there! Thanks for the tips.
motorcyclesroadtrip,3ce0xe,ktkamb,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:14:22 2015 UTC,"It's probably 15 miles from the Cabot Trail (paved, 2-lanes) to Meat Cove.   I forget how much of it is gravel but I wouldn't be surprised if it were mostly gravel.  I don't mean to dissuade you, it's not too bad."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cczrh,kylejay90,4,Mon Jul 6 23:15:48 2015 UTC,"I just did a 1300 mile trip over 3 1/2 days solo and the best suggestion I got was ear plugs. When you're on the road for 6, 8, 10 hours straight for days at a time, wind noise really starts to fatigue your brain making you noticeably more tired. I alternated between ear plugs and ear buds. Other thing is dehydration; I don't really know why but your body needs more water on long haul motorcycle trips so drink constantly. Stop every couple of hours and walk around even if it ads time to your trip, stretch a ton. My only regret is I didn't take more time. The ride was a blast but I didn't get to enjoy my destinations enough so always add a day if you can. Eye drops, lip balm, and glass cleaner are great to have."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cczrh,tylorjams,2,Mon Jul 6 23:49:31 2015 UTC,I have an ipod that lasts a good while I'll be sure to bring plugs for the day time when the scenery is enough to entertain my brain though thanks. I don't want to do this with regrets maybe I'll take a whole week off work and make it 2 laps and enjoy the 2nd one

motorcyclesroadtrip,3cczrh,tylorjams,3,Tue Jul 7 03:51:48 2015 UTC,"Yep, I was torn on my last ride since it was through Utah and Arizona. Going through there you're compelled to constantly stop and there are so manny alluring side roads. Next time I'll do the same trip but tack on 2 more days. As far as Iron Butt goes, I have a lot of respect but I like to stop and soak it in. I was pretty much at my limit doing 1300 in 72 hours, I can't imagine doing that in 24."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cczrh,kstache,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:32:29 2015 UTC,"Taking your time and enjoying the side roads is the way to do it. I was crunched for time and going 1/3 of the way across the US, so I was practically doing an IB already.   I was headed to CO and staying in Denver for a couple of weeks, so I made sure to enjoy the side roads and views while I was there."

The sound driver was surrounded by foam that you squish down, then put the whole thing in your ear. Those are the only ear buds I'd recommend now. Otherwise, I'll go with earplugs.  For combatting dehydration, I had a tank bag that held a camelback and had a hole for the hose to come out. It was a little awkward at first to drink from, but it was totally worth it."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cczrh,tylorjams,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:36:15 2015 UTC,"These are what I use. The noise canceling is perfect since it cancels out white noise but you can still hear things like weird engine noises, sirens, horn honks. They also come with the rubber buds you see in the picture or the memory foam stuff you're talking about. The foam is great but it breaks down over time and I actually prefer the rubber now. You can order a bunch of different buds for these including the ribbed (for your pleasure) kind and 3 different sizes. Hydration bags are great, I like Platypus over Camel Back. I'm a backpacker and hiker so I'm already used to using them."

motorcyclesroadtrip,3cczrh,mctaggert,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:26:21 2015 UTC,I just now re read it for the 4th time today. And while it's very helpful it says nothing about training my butt for the long ride. Do you have any tips for preparing physically fit the trip?
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cczrh,mctaggert,2,Tue Jul 7 00:58:53 2015 UTC,"Doing trips like you listed in your original post are the best training. More than training, long trips will give you an idea of where your bike is comfortable and where it's not. You might prefer a bigger windshield, find out you like specific ear plugs or want a different seat.  I also recommend taking two naproxen before you start the ride and two more after 8 or 10 hours. I've found that helps me a lot."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cczrh,troglodave,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:28:45 2015 UTC,I ride without a windshield I don't even have a gas gauge. I'll try the naproxen out on my next trip. Is there a certain seat manufacturer you recommend or a special foam I can get my seat re stuffed with?
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cczrh,mctaggert,3,Tue Jul 7 01:36:30 2015 UTC,"I've ridden quite a bit with a sheepskin pad. I find it comfortable.  Make sure you have an approximate idea of your mileage range on your bike. And remember to reset your petcock if you have to use reserve.  A windshield will cut down on wind buffeting. This will really help with fatigue. However, it's not a requirement. I wouldn't  put off a ride for this reason."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cczrh,mctaggert,2,Tue Jul 7 02:25:56 2015 UTC,Is your sheepskin pad something that just sits on the saddle or is it something that stays attached?

motorcyclesroadtrip,3cczrh,lonestarfisherman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:13:56 2015 UTC,"I've used both a fitted sheepskin that straps to the seat and one that just drapes over the seat.  Both were comfortable for riding, but the fitted, attached one was easier to manage during stops.  But for long distance rides, it didn't really matter for me which kind I used.  Both were equally comfortable.  I used different versions because a custom fitted sheepskin came with one bike and left with it when I sold it.  Later, I found a sheepskin in thrift store and draped it over the seat on a couple of bikes.  It would occasionally fall off at a gas stop, but not too often.  After awhile I finally got bright enough to just put a nylon strap over the sheepskin and seat to hold the thing on."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cczrh,kevin_k,2,Tue Jul 7 15:24:01 2015 UTC,"The stock Shadow saddle is a serious ass hatchet. Rode on one for years. My buddy swapped his out for a Mustang saddle tho they're a bit pricey. I've also heard if there's a car upholstery/interior person in the area they may be able to beef up your saddle some.   Highway pegs are great too if you don't have them. Just being able to change positions for awhile makes it easier as the day goes on. Luckily, with a Shadow, your range between fuel stops will give you plenty of time to stretch!"
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cczrh,2lisimst,2,Tue Jul 7 03:10:56 2015 UTC,Ass hatchet... I've never heard that before but that's funny. I'll be sure to call a couple shops in my area and see what they can do for me. You weren't kidding about being pricey for a mustang saddle but reviews make it sound completely worth it.
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cczrh,2lisimst,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:29:28 2015 UTC,"I just did my first iron butt last month and put the paperwork in not so long ago.  If I did them regularly, I'd buy a new seat. I'll second ear plugs. I notice myself getting tired sooner without them. Walking and stretching at gas stops was enough to refresh me for the next leg of the trip. I did roughly 150 mile legs.  The IBA faq suggests packing food to save time and make sure you're eating right, but hot food was the big ticket for me.   The only other thing I might have done differently was spread the trip out more and ride fun roads instead of interstate, but then I wouldn't have actually done an iron butt...  I did the bun burner 1500 miles in 36 hours. The first day was a little over 800, and I think a saddle sore 1000 would have been very doable with an earlier start."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cczrh,jtraf,2,Tue Jul 7 04:02:05 2015 UTC,I'm planning on taking on southern Michigan Illinois and part of Wisconsin at night to really be able to enjoy Michigan's UP and M22 during the day. I rode this highway last weekend which really inspired my motivation to do an iron butt. with twists and turns all along the shoreline for about 200 miles it was by far the best thing I've ever done with my pants on.
motorcyclesroadtrip,3cczrh,bigBastardDude,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:38:20 2015 UTC,I haven't done one yet but have friends that have a patch. They find it easier to start the trek at night so you will be more alert and aware of critters/dangers. Always wear ear plugs and highway pegs will help you give your legs a stretch. Plan your stops and eat/drink something small every fill up to keep the blood sugar up. Plan where you will eat a real meal as to not waste an hour eating at Denny's because it was the only thing open. Just remember you will be riding on your bike 16-20 hours depending on  how fast you ride. 4 hours is not a lot of time left for food/gas/bathroom breaks.

motorcyclesroadtrip,3bm9bc,Lolinub,11,Tue Jun 30 10:40:28 2015 UTC,"You can call me ""Mr. Determination,"" or ""Mr. Independent,"" because I independently do things with great determination that might be considered manic by sane people.  My very first real motorcycle (the 1949 Whizzer moped doesn't count) was a 1960 square-fendered Honda 250 Dream which I named ""Nightmare Number Three"" in honor of a poem in which the machines began taking over the world and started to kill people.  I had no experience of motorcycles with transmissions and clutches and 20 horsepower, my Whizzer had 2.5 horsepower and a centrifugal clutch.  After almost killing myself on my initial ride, I quite forgot what the previous owner had told me about the dry sump oil system on the Honda, and had misinterpreted what he had said anyway.  The dry sump was empty and I rode the poor little Honda around local roads for three weeks without ever filling up the oil tank.  Then I started out on a cross country trip, California to Florida with little resources except youthful piss and vinegar and an empty oil tank.  It's amazing that the poor little Honda survived riding at highway speeds from Ventura, CA to Thousand Palms, a distance of about 200 miles before quitting and rolling to a stop alongside Interstate 10.  A passing rider on an Indian stopped to ask what was wrong and listened to the thrashing and clashing of the valves and suggested maybe I'd better adjust them.  He also suggested that I should add some oil to the oil tank, which I did.  The poor Honda was running on only one cylinder, so I was demoted to being a 125cc rider.  It took me another 10 or 12 hours to ride back home on one cylinder.  It would stall every time I shifted into third gear because it had so little power, but I was totally on my own, there was nobody to call for help and nobody was going to come and get me.  When I tore into the engine (using only the OEM tool kit!) I got the cylinder head and the cylinder off somehow and found that there was a hole in one piston and the rings were worn off the other piston, so maybe I had the power of a 90cc left on the ride home.  But I couldn't hang around, I was under military orders to report to Patrick AFB in Florida within a few days, so I grabbed my bag and set out hitchhiking across country.  And my coming-of-age adventure continued, with experience after experience..."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3bm9bc,grunge_ryder,3,Tue Jun 30 18:16:17 2015 UTC,"The French author Marcel Proust wrote a novel called ""Remembrance of Things Past,"" in which he theorized that one is never done with the past until one has remembered and analyzed and dissected every nuance of the memory of an event, and having bored one's self with said nit picking, one stops thinking of the event.  The salesman who sold me the Honda with no oil in it had brought the machine back from Okinawa when he was discharged from the US Army.  It was a Japanese home market machine with 18-inch wheels instead of the 16-inch wheels seen on US models, so it looked just a bit more like a motorcycle and less like a scooter.  I ran across his nephew online many years after my fiasco, he was running a classic Japanese motorcycle restoration site.  He told me that his uncle had died in the crash of a private plane, which makes me wonder if he'd failed to check the engine oil.  Alas, Marcel Proust, what should I do?

I've paid for my campsite and rode the few miles to the campsite when my clutch cable snaps...in view of the campsite. Just rode 450 miles, including a 90 mile stretch through the desert with no roadside amenities at all, and it snaps as I'm pulling into my campsite. Had a new cable shipped to the closest shop which was 60 miles away and had the shop pick me and the bike up 2 days later. Still had a great trip even though I never made it to Big Bend.

motorcyclesroadtrip,3bm9bc,pj2d2,6,Tue Jun 30 20:18:45 2015 UTC,"Left Portland heading south for an 8-day ride to SF, Yosemite, Lake Tahoe, Crater lake then home. Morning of Day 2 I try to start the bike and I get part of a revolution then nothing. Hit the starter again, lights dim. Then I remembered about the Hydrolock issue I had heard about with these bikes. The carbs will sometimes let fuel past the float and slowly fill the cylinder with fuel. This can lead to things like a bent rod and could well kill the trip for me. I pulled the tank, plugs and was able to flush everything out. Once back together she fired right up and sounded great.  Same Trip, heading East out of San Francisco to Yosemite. A Virago I am riding with starts to smoke 2 miles before a fuel stop. We discover the valve inspection plate had come loosed so got that tightened up and topped off the oil. I am preparing to load my tools back up when I see it - a rack of 6-8 nails sticking out of my sidewall. I was still holding air, so chanced it. Don't do this. We made it to Yosemite and as I was pulling into the parking lot, the tire lost air. The next day I was able to get AAA to tow me 70 or so miles to a shop called T&A motorsports that had a tire that fit my bike. Being a Concours, with a 16"" rear made that a bit more challenging, but they had one in stock and got it installed the same afternoon.   A year later, riding the Southern Oregon coast area. Hit a long straight after some nice twistys and I decide to open her up a bit. Just after breaking 100 I get a huge cloud of what I thought was smoke. Turns out it was steam from my cooling system. There is an outlet pipe (pain in the ass little bastard pipe, as it became to be known) that lost a bolt and fell out of the water pump. AAA got me back to our camp, a friend with a trailer got me home.  19 days from now I head out on another 8-day 2000 mile ride. Wish me luck!"

After NUMEROUS problems like motor mounts coming loose, the back rack almost falling completely off, cracked welds, the speedometer cable coming off (twice from the gauges then once from the wheel which required buying a new cable) and more, I very unwisely decided to take the 1000 mile ride to Utah. The bike, despite the list of issues, still had only about 17k on it at this point. 500 miles into my trip I'm tooling down the highway and the radiator fan breaks free of it's mounting tab and chews a hole in the radiator. Of course its July 4th so I'm stuck in some backwater town for 3 days trying to get this fixed. Then on the way home as I'm going about 80 mph, my meticulously serviced and never low on oil sub 20k motorcycle grenaded in the middle of freaking nowhere. I had to have it towed like 25 miles to the nearest bike shop. The mechanic showed me that the upper counter balancer bearing just disintegrated and the whole balance shaft just bounced around inside the crankcase destroying every single internal machined part you can think of including punching a hole in one of the cases. This is my 5th Kawasaki and I've never had a single issue with any of them until this one. Thinking about buying a KLR? Don't."

Get there early on a week day and you'll have the whole road to yourself ;) it was there on Thursday at the end of August heading south to SFO and up and over to Vegas and there was still some snow :)  Mount St. Helens is a pretty neat detour as well. I've inly done this in a cage but still a great detour.   I think call the boulevard of the giants in the red woods. It runs parallel   to the highway but puts you in and around the redwoods.  Get some nice shade.   If your looking a trip in the way back head up to Port angles and ride up hurricane ridge. Hell of a road in a bike.

It is pretty amazing. If you are riding a bike with some suspension, take the Old Coast Road instead of going over the Bixby bridge. I would recommend you go on the bridge on your way back, but I think the Old Coast Road is pretty nostalgic."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3belco,Hacki_1st,2,Mon Jun 29 04:37:18 2015 UTC,"I took the coast up to Oregon and then in to Mt. St. Helens in late May this year.  Oregon has the most amazing roads for motorcycling.  The road surfaces are so well maintained.  Also, the signage is so good it's like having a rally co-driver.  If you end up in Ashland, go to the Rogue Valley Roasting Company coffee shop.  Have the Mexican mocha with whipped cream, in a glass.  It will blow your mind.  You must do Crater Lake, while in Oregon on a motorcycle.  It's the law.  Leaving Crater Lake, take the Umpqua Scenic Byway (138).  It's magical.  If you do it early enough, you can take breaks and swim in hot springs along the way.  Oregon is full-service only at gas stations.  The gas stations off the beaten path still tend to close up at night.  Don't be caught low on gas late at night in Oregon.  Mt. St. Helens is pretty awesome.  However, the road quality is rather shit compared to the Oregon roads you will be used to by the time you get there.  Maybe it's because it's an active volcano and the land is shifting.  Maybe it's because they're National Forestry roads.  In any case, there are random dips all over the place.    When you cross into Washington and stop to get gas, try not to sit there at the pump twiddling your thumbs for too long before realizing that the station is not full service like Oregon and you don't have to wait for the guy to come out and take your credit card."

motorcyclesroadtrip,3b6sfb,PM_ME_YOUR_UVULA_PLS,11,Fri Jun 26 12:55:09 2015 UTC,"There are some long stretches without gas on highway 17 between Thunder Bay and Wawa, a 480km stretch of road.  Nipigon, Terrace Bay, Marathon and White River usually have gas, but I've hit some of them and found the place closed or the pumps dry.  Your +- 170km tank should be sufficient, but I would probably carry a jerry can with me on that stretch, just in case one of the pumps is dry.  Fill it in Wawa and leave it in North Bay.  It's a beautiful area.  I recommend crossing the border at the Thousand Islands Bridge and heading north-west towards North Bay.  There is no direct route so it will take more time, but many of the roads are gorgeous.  The Trans-Canada Highway 17 is lovely to Thunder Bay (I'm heading that way tomorrow actually), as is 61 to Duluth."

motorcyclesroadtrip,3b6sfb,qboyle,3,Fri Jun 26 16:08:19 2015 UTC,"Highway 17 and 61 are both awesome as /u/kalamode mentioned. Can also confirm that there are some long stretches without gas. Source: Thunder Bay resident.   There was a gas shortage in Northwestern Ontario last summer, but you shouldn't find dry pumps any time soon. You should stop at every small town though even if you're at half a tank, because there's nothing between them.   Another tip: be very wary of transports on both highway 17 and 61. Most of the highways are single lane (they've begun dividing portions). Transports will pass other transports whenever they feel like it - corners, uphill, etc. - they are maniacs. Just be careful and make sure you're always in view. Enjoy the ride."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3b46re,8mmphilosopher,12,Thu Jun 25 20:46:12 2015 UTC,"Going cross country there usually aren't park rangers after 6pm or so and if you're out of there early in the morning before they start work you can usually get away without paying.   So I'm somewhere in Michigan and find a nice spot along the road without anyone around, get my camp set up and, after a ramen dinner, head off to bed. At dark I start hearing singing up the road and the singing is getting closer. I step out of my tent and up the road I see hundreds (it felt like hundreds, there were actually about 50) of flashlights. I freaked out, hid in my tent and hoped they wouldn't see me. I didn't work and everyone shined their lights on my tent as they walked by. This was the first time I tried the late/early trick and was pretty freaked out.   Turns out it was just a Christian getaway thing. The pastor invited me to the movie night and we watched The Passion of The Christ on this big outdoor screen with popcorn and everything. It was pretty cool."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3b46re,Lose__Not__Loose,2,Fri Jun 26 01:19:02 2015 UTC,"Here's another one, not really stealth camping but it is what it is.   I went through a state park in Colorado, passed the official campground and went into the national forest. For those who don't know, camping is free in national forests and worth looking for especially out west. So I go way up, a few miles from the rest of the ""campers"". I'm way up high and, after a long day of riding, I decide to just smoke a cigarette, have a beer and sleep in my hammock. In the back and front of my mind there are wolves and mountain lions everywhere. I'm from southern New England and, while we have wildlife, I've heard plenty of stories of predators in Colorado.  So after a little bit by the fire I decide to hit the hay. I had dropped my sleeping bag the day before due to improperly securing my load so I bought one of those mexican woven blankets from a tourist trap and thought that would be enough. An hour or so into the night I wake up to the howls of wolves (they were actually coyotes in hindsight). To combat this I raise my hammock 5 feet off the ground, get back in, and try to fall back asleep.   A short time later I wake up with a thump on the ground. The damn ""wolves"" are still howling and yipping, sounding closer than before. Sore, tired, and scared, i spend the rest of the night going back and forth to the fire, trying to scavange the best wood I can find in the dark with my little, shitty, pre-LED flashlight.   I apparently fell asleep next to the fire at some point because I woke up to birds singing and a beautiful day. When I went to eat my cliff bar breakfast I found some damn rodent had gotten into my back pack and gnawed into every single one of them, I assume to find the best one. I still had a cliff bar breakfast."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3b46re,Lose__Not__Loose,7,Fri Jun 26 22:39:50 2015 UTC,"After looking for and failing to find a stealth camping spot in Spain, I was determined to succeed in France. I had read online that other people had found the National Park near Montpellier was an easy mark, so I left early and arrived around 3pm.  What they hadn't said online was that National Parks in Europe are quite different to here in Australia. This one was just open fields and cottages as far as the eye could see, with nowhere to camp. Like this: https://www.google.com.au/maps/@43.509755,4.399054,3a,75y,351h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1smWDy4mvbW2Gqy1GOWuAoWQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1  I rode for hours in random directions until eventually I found a gravel back road, and a turn out with a tree I could hide behind. I hung out for an hour and saw 2 other cars use the road - I figured once the sun went down I'd be golden. Somewhere around here I think: https://www.google.com.au/maps/@43.459442,4.4955268,339m/data=!3m1!1e3  So I set up my cooker and start cooking dinner and got absolutely set upon by millions of sand flies. They were getting into my hood, getting into my bags, into my food, and mixed in were mosquitoes biting me. Here's how bad it was: https://www.dropbox.com/s/y92z45yzp9kh590/2014-06-19%2011.03.58.mp4?dl=0  I just couldn't stand it anymore. I bailed on dinner, it was only 5pm and still well light but I put my tent up anyway and hid away from the bugs inside until the next morning. Two cars passed between when the tent when up and when I broke camp but neither stopped or paid me any attention, and the next morning I rode into town for a nice hot breakfast."

They have a tiny campground that is first come first serve.  Of course it was packed.  So we pulled into a scenic overlook, found a gap in the trees where we could slip into the forest towards the edge of the canyon but just outside of the view of someone checking for people parked there.  Threw down the tent on the very edge and woke up early to a sunrise over the grand canyon.    Promptly got up, snapped some pictures, pissed off of the edge, packed up and got out of there.   Something in the underbrush tore at some wiring underneath and my inside lights on the car never worked again...It was a good trip."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3b46re,BikerBoon,3,Fri Jun 26 15:26:38 2015 UTC,"Heh, I have a couple. First one, I was riding with some friends and we set off way too late. We had picked out a spot roughly on the map where we might be able to find somewhere quiet to camp. By the time we got there it was pitch black. We made camp anyway, and found a nearby stream for water. I got soaked up to my knees when I slipped into said stream. We then noticed from the corner of our torches what looked like a house, so we spent the rest of the night as quiet as possible thinking we were in someones garden. My friend even went creeping around some trees take a leak and got stung by a load of nettles. Morning came around. The house? A toilet block. There was a stand pipe not 30 meters from where we made camp too. Turns out we camped in a Boy Scout training area, but luckily they weren't there that day.  The second I was on my own in Scotland, and hopped over a stone wall to camp in a forest. I woke up at 3am to a stag making a godawful racket, like a mooing type noise. Peeked outside, and visibility was less than 10 meters due to some ridiculously heavy fog. I could have swore I saw it dart off in the corner of my eye, and luckily it left me alone after that because it creeped me the hell out."

As I'm going along the road I'm scanning along and I see gate leading into a rough field leading up a large hill. I turn back around, park, then head up the path with my flashlight to scout it out. No houses or people or cows around so I turn back and open the unlocked gate and head up the hill on my cruiser.   At the very top of the hill there is some very tall 8 foot grass off the path that I pull into with  my bike to hide it. A bit further through the grass I find a large tree next to a fence that overlooks the valley below which is perfect for my hammock. I set up my hammock and camera taking a timelaspe of the stars, eat some cheap sugary raw Oaxaca chocolate and go to bed.   Wake up in the morning and cut through the grass back to my bike and find it's still there. Cut back through the grass to get my hammock and get turned around in the grass and lost for 5-10 minutes and I go in circles. Eventually get back and then pack up and go down the hill and continue my trip south to Puerto Escondido.

Spent a couple days in Merimbula (south NSW) kitesurfing, hammock camping off the beach in the bush next to it. After a long day on the water I went and showered at the beach bathroom. When I came back I found a group of local people surrounding my bike getting ready to call the coast guard because they thought I must have been sucked out to sea.

motorcyclesroadtrip,3b46re,squeakinator,2,Sat Jun 27 17:23:04 2015 UTC,"Memorial Day weekend of 2011, I was riding up the Pacific Coast Highway with a friend as part of a longer trip. The campground we were planning on staying at was booked up. It was  a holiday weekend, and we were in Malibu. Unsure exactly where we would end up (paying for a motel around there was out of the question) we headed for a gas station to fill up and figure things out.   There was another guy there on a KLR, ammo can panniers welded to a home fabbed frame, classic grey BMW adventure jacket, wild red beard: the real deal. We chatted and told him about our situation and he recommended a stealth camping site near by. We exchanged info, took a pic, parted ways and followed his land marked directions to the spot. Our Bonnevilles didn't take the loose rutted steep trail down hill well, but once we made it, we found ourselves in a little wonder land. One big tree was there for us to hang our hammocks in and hide our bikes behind. It was only probably 50 feet from the main road, but about 8 feet lower in altitude so that helped.  We soon discovered that the area in either direction was a home to some clever homeless people and vagabonds. One highly weathered woman we had seen walking the road much earlier caught up with us while we set up camp and asked us for weed. Sorry lady.  Oh, and I haven't mentioned that this spot was on a cliff with the Pacific ocean below. No complaints! This was definitely a camping spot that was frequently used. I was surprised that no one came through hoping to use it themselves, or Johnny Law doing a routine sweep through. But we were left undisturbed except for our camping neighbor looking for drugs and she was very polite about it.  Getting back up the dangerous dirt ramp meant one of us spotting for clear patches in traffic in the morning while the other got a running start on our bikes and hoping for the best. We made it out just fine but it would have been really hairy ejecting ourselves at speed perpendicular to the road onto the PCH alone."

motorcyclesroadtrip,3b46re,squeakinator,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:30:47 2015 UTC,"There are frontage roads all along Hwy 101 north of Goleta and you can probably find a place where the Highway Patrol won't see you from the highway and local residents won't bother you if you arrive after dark.  Head north 25 miles from Santa Barbara on Hwy 101.   Just past Tejuigas (sp?) creek beach you'll see the yellow crossroad advisory sign, turn left and you'll be on a paved road that runs half a mile north.  The Union Pacific railroad runs between that road and the beach, so an Amtrac train might roll through there occasionally.  A very few local residents use that road to access their homes, and you can turn left again before the end of the paved road and find a small graveled turnaround where a motorcycle can pull off and camp in the bushes.  Don't be surprised when you meet homeless people and other strange types, there are thousands of homeless people all along the Gold Coast, enjoying life by panhandling, stealth camping and panhandling.  Some of the people you encounter on that road might be horny gays cruising for sex, so if somebody comes up to you and wants to talk endlessly about the weather or how they're thinking about getting a motorcycle, just be polite until they decide to leave.   Further north, past El Capitan and Refugio state parks, there is a nude beach which attracts a lot of gay men.  Heading north, turn right at Mariposa Reina and cross over Hwy 101 to head south for a mile to the first parking area where you can hide your motorcycle in the bushes.  A security guard from the refinery might inspect the area.  Heading south, you'll see an old 1920's cement bridge off the side of the road and there's a turnout there where truckers and RV'ers stop to rest.  The Highway Patrol will probably inspect this area.  If you google up Rancho Dos Vistas, you will find information about which road to ride up to get to Ronald Reagan's ranch.  As I recall it's at the intersection of Camino del Cielo and you can find camping areas along that road which runs along the spine of the mountains overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  On a good day you'll get a spectacular view of the Channel Islands in the afternoon,, but the mornings will usually soak you in damp fog."

But that whole beautiful area is California oak tree country with Spanish moss hanging from the trees.  If you ride north on Hwy 101 past Gaviota, and through the tunnel where there's a sign cautioning motorists to share the road with bicycles, you'll come to the intersection of Hwy 101 and Highway 1 which will take you to Lompoc.  But if you pass the Hwy 1 junction and continue up the Hwy 101 grade, you will see a parking area for trucks and a sign that says ""brake check"" area.   Turning right there takes you onto a narrow road which is the back way into Nojoqui Falls park.  If you get there after dark, it's unlikely that anybody else will be using that road, so you might be able to pull off somewhere to stealth camp."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3b46re,pinballwizard1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:09:40 2015 UTC,"That looks like Leo Carillo State Beach Park at the junction of Pacific Coast Highway and Mulholland Highway.  There is a campground across the road from the beach park where you can camp for only $10 if you are hiking or riding a bicycle.  Otherwise it's $45 a night.  Many years ago, us bikers used to go down a little side road near Nicholls Canyon, and that would take us to a frontage road right on the beach where there were no houses with snotty rich bitch homeowners to tell us we couldn't party there.  That road led to the east side of Leo Carrillo State Beach park, and is probably right below the picture you took on the cliff.  However, the gooberment built an official state park with a gate that blocked us from riding our motorcycles right down to the beach."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3b46re,Manasseh92,2,Sun Jun 28 21:47:35 2015 UTC,"Independent camping outside of designated campgrounds is allowed in most state and national parks in the USA.  You might be required to pay an entrance fee to the park if a ranger catches you, but some of these parks are so lonely and isolated that the rangers probably won't ever pass by your camp site.  Some parks have what is called the ""iron ranger"" a lock box which you are supposed to deposit a fee, but I know from experience that the money deposited in those boxes often goes into the ranger's pocket."

motorcyclesroadtrip,3awsq5,colirado,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:22:46 2015 UTC,"Before you hit the road, spend some time practicing breaking on that Victory. I saw a guy wreck one when he only used the rear brake, the bike became unstable and started to wobble uncontrollably.  It's a heavy bike and getting it to a quick, controlled stop should be second nature for you."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3awsq5,shartshooter,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:37:25 2015 UTC,"Well aware of the breaks on the Victory. The V-Rod I mentioned kicked my butt twice. I have the marks on my knees as a reminder about being mindful of breaking. Also... I learned that if you have flat spots the tire is done and cannot be recovered. I've been on heavy bikes before. I'm just so glad this isn't a big engine Harley with a suicide clutch, I never want to ride those again by choice again."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3awsq5,shartshooter,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:22:39 2015 UTC,"Saddle bags are important. Strapping luggage on the rear seat raises the centre of gravity and makes you very susceptible to cross winds.  Motocross pants and cheap waterproofs are good, but as you plan on using the bike, get a pair of decent motorcycle pants. 2nd vote on clear safety glasses. Pack very light. Use quick dry clothing.  Watch out about eating too much protean/high carb intake before riding, you will get very drowsy.  Take one collard button up shirt and one pair of light long pants. Just smart enough to get into restaurants, a shirt to wear under your riding gear and one more to sleep in. Buy a new shirt if you have to in an emergency.   Decent above ankle boots.  Carabine and stretchy cord for your keys. Don't lose your fucking keys, swap spare keys with your ridding buddy or leave it with someone who can courier it to you ASAP.   Sunglasses that fit comfortably with your helmet."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3awsq5,funbobbyfun,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:37:29 2015 UTC,"Reading through your list again, too much clothing. A thin cotton collard office shirt will dry in 15-20mins after a hand washing. Focus on riding safely, not how clean your clothes are after. If you pack too much junk, you will get fatigued with the added concentration needed to handle the heavier bike.  The same goes with speed, higher speeds require more concentration."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3atzfh,raptor9999,3,Tue Jun 23 14:22:22 2015 UTC,"Small axe maybe, for chopping wood, if you're planning some campfires?  Wet wipes?   Something to lock the bike?"
motorcyclesroadtrip,3atzfh,Deekomendez,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:50:33 2015 UTC,Good suggestions. Not sure if we are planning a campfire for this one or not; we may eat beforehand and just use the portable burner to cook smores/etc.   Wet wipes added :)  I'm not very worried about locking the bike on this trip. We will be out in the middle of nowhere and I'll be camping right next to my bike also. Still a good suggestion though.  Thanks!

motorcyclesroadtrip,3atzfh,irishmcsg2,2,Tue Jun 23 15:15:00 2015 UTC,"An axe would work, but I got a foldable saw that has those razor sharp teeth works well.  I also pack those small fire starters sticks.   I am not sure what small burner your using,  I use a jetboil.  It does require fuel canisters, but the jetboil can make your coffee in the morning and easily cook any dried foods or canned goods.  I personally prefer a 1 man tent, but I can see sleeping in a hammock as long as your sure you have a place to hang it.  I use the tent with a self inflating mat sleeping bag and a camping pillow.  Your headlamp is a must, pack extra batteries.  Anything you get like forks knives ect, get backpacking equipment, keep it light.  One thing about the jetboil is nice us that the fuel containers also can attach a small lanturn.   The wet wipes are a must, I would replace the bug spray with bug wipes.  I also pack a harmonica, I am just learning to play, but it's fun.  Enjoy your trip!"

motorcyclesroadtrip,3atzfh,8mmphilosopher,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:35:43 2015 UTC,Another thing when talking about food.  Most likely you may be close enough to ride into the closest town for a good meal.  If not and you are packing your own food in I suggest like before canned goods like beans ect.  But if your going to have any amount of food left over remember wildlife.  Last thing you want to do is leave out some food and attract a bear or a cat.  I carry a side arm and suggest that if you do have a sidearm to consider it or at least be aware of the potential of the local wildlife..
motorcyclesroadtrip,3atzfh,8mmphilosopher,2,Tue Jun 23 18:25:22 2015 UTC,food?  dish soap/scrubbing pad/small towel to do the dishes after eating  rope to hang the tarp above your hammock if/when it starts raining

motorcyclesroadtrip,3atzfh,dipthongCowboy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:50:44 2015 UTC,Idk where you'll be but hammocks can get really cold at night. Even in a sleeping bag your weight compresses the down/fill and you have essentially a few layers of nylon between you and the cold air below you. I couldn't sleep in up state new york in 50-60 degree weather.
motorcyclesroadtrip,3atzfh,CafeRacer400cc,3,Tue Jun 23 17:39:23 2015 UTC,No need to worry about that. The low is supposed to be 70 where I am going lol
motorcyclesroadtrip,3atzfh,CafeRacer400cc,2,Tue Jun 23 17:42:30 2015 UTC,"Toilet Paper   That is probably your wet wipes right? I would say your list looks pretty good for an overnighter where you are planning on cooking. I typically eat out and then bring a snack and beer to the campsite so I typically do not bring the extra equipment. The campsites I usually go to on the motorcycle do not require a hike in (tent platforms); if you are planning on hiking in, you will want a backpack that can carry your stuff that isn't your saddlebags.    Other people are recommending an ax or saw; in all my years camping I have always found enough wood lying around that is easily used for a fire, but if you have that much energy left after the ride, you are welcome to bring one."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3atzfh,flynnski,2,Tue Jun 23 16:35:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm thinking wet wipes will take care of that.  I don't know for sure if we are cooking or eating beforehand like you are talking about.

The wind between Madras, OR and Biggs, OR was quite heavy; it was weird to lean left to go straight. 2 bees flew into my helmet under my chin.  Day 2: Richland, WA - Spokane, WA, 150 miles.  Travel Day 3/Actual Day 8: Spokane, WA - Corvallis, OR, 600 miles, by way of Richland, WA for breakfast and Mt. St. Helens National Monument.  Travel Day 4/Actual Day 9: Corvallis, OR - Redwood City, CA, 650 miles, by taking OR-58 across the Cascades, entering Crater Lake from the North and going Clockwise around the Rim Road, and exiting from the South, then getting back on 97/5/505/80. I then took CA-37 around the North Bay and got the traditional photo at the Golden Gate Bridge overlook.  Further info:  Suzuki SV-650, stock seat/windscreen/etc. I can go 180 miles between gas stops at freeway speeds, but my gas light comes on at 150 and that's about how far I can go before I need to stretch my legs.

motorcyclesroadtrip,3akmk6,geking,2,Sun Jun 21 05:28:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for not discouraging. I'm thinking of a Triumph America or Honda Shadow Spirit, both are said to be great to start with..."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3akmk6,geking,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:47:36 2015 UTC,I went the dual sport route and have only ridden a cruse in msf class.  Anything 250 or bigger will get you there on the high way.  ( they top out at like 80 or 85 mph)
motorcyclesroadtrip,3akmk6,rodrile,2,Sun Jun 21 19:47:04 2015 UTC,"I would prefer not less than a 450-650 cc range for a bike, this will give you plenty of power to carry a load easily and to keep up with the traffic, and a little weight to get you thru the windy sections you will hit. Get a bike that your comfortable with ie fits your body type and is easy for you to handle in tight spots.  Do some warm up runs 200+ mi  to get  you used to long periods riding, I get some soft material (sheep skin) padding for my butt, it can get very sore at first for me anyway. Just do it! I should have done it when I first came to CA and not waited so long."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3akmk6,grunge_ryder,2,Mon Jul 20 21:30:41 2015 UTC,"Would it be madness?  Definitely.    One of the major motorcycle magazines ran a story called ""The Madness of the Long-Distance Rider"" back in the 1970's.  Motorcycle touring is a madness, it's a mania that some riders just have to do.  I talked to Ron Major at Newcomb's Ranch on the Angeles Crest Highway twice befoe he had a heart attack and died tried to replicate his previous experience riding the Iron Butt Rally in which riders do 1000 miles everyday for eleven days and get bonus points for visiting odd places.  Ron was talking about repeating his 50CC ride (that's 50 hours coast to coast, not a 50cc motorcycle) and I asked Ron why in hell he wanted to ride against the clock instead of stopping to smell the roses at some pleasant national or state park.  Ron wouldn't even attempt to justify his mania for long distance riding to me.  His Honda ST1100 was completely set up for the type of riding he was going to do, it had heated handlebars and coffeee cup holders and everything that one might want in a 2-wheeled sports car.  Some Iron Butt types were talking about wearing adult diapers or using a ""rider's relief tube"" (like jet fighter pilots use to pee into) so they wouldn't have to stop to get rid of used coffee so often.  The ergonomics of the motorcycle are related to its physical size and comfort depends upon your own size and what's comfortable to you, given how tall you are and how long your legs are and any physical handicaps you might have.  I once started out across country on a 1960 250cc Honda square fendered Dream, but only got 250 miles before having to return home.  That was due to my total inexperience with the care and feeding of a motorcycle.  I have also done interstate touring on much larger motorcycles, a 750cc Suzuki Water Buffalo and a Yamaha FZR1000.  I'm not very tall, but those motorcycle that felt so heavy and ponderous rolling out of my drive felt tiny compared to the 18-wheelers I was sharing the road with.  And the mania that took over Ron Major's mind quickly takes over my own mind, I just want to ride, ride, ride, until I'm so tired I have to stop.  But I would have to recommend a multi-cylinder motorcycle, an inline-four of at least 750cc and preferrably 1000+ cc's for a cross country trip like you're thinking of.  Check the oil every day without fail and lube the drive chain (if it has one) every 400 miles.  Carry drinking water with you and be aware of how the heat of the day dehydrates you.  Get as much rest as possible when you stop and be sure to carry a ditty bag with you that contains any prescription meds you use, plus over-the-counter pills and ointments that you may find useful.  It really eats into your riding day when you have to stop along the way searchin through stores for little things you discover you must have."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3akmk6,genehil,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:27:45 2015 UTC,"thanks for the tips. I still dont know what kind of bike I should get... something close to 800cc could be good but the heavy weight might be harsh for beginners like me. And because I never had a bike, I don't know what it means to ""feel comfortable"". Straight handlebars? curved up? down? too many choices..."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3akmk6,grunge_ryder,2,Fri Jun 26 22:30:05 2015 UTC,I did 5600 non-interstate miles on a 2011 Kawasaki 650 Versys a while back... Florida to Montana and back. You'll do just fine with anything 450cc and up... if it's reliables do you don't need to do 75 mph the entire time. Shop around... Find a good used bike... Have it checked out by someone you trust that understands motorcycles... Slap some new tires on her and GO!
motorcyclesroadtrip,3akmk6,grunge_ryder,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:12:45 2015 UTC,"Google up ""motorcycle ergonomics"" to get an idea of what kind of bike you would fit on.  There was an ergonomic program online a few years ago that allowed a prospective purchaser to see what he would fit best on.  I seem to associate the program with www.totalmotorcycle.com which is an outstanding site for wouldbe riders to educate themselves about motorcycling.  So far as weight is concerned, you don't really notice a motorcycle's weight until it has fallen over and you need to pick it up.  Even then, a knowledgeable rider will know how to use the handlebars and the front wheel to lever the motorcycle up off the pavement and how to use his/her butt or hip as a prop to maintain what has been gained each time the handlebars are turned from side to side.  Notwithstanding what I said about weight above, there was a weight reduction revolution about 1993, when Honda introduced the CB900RR which was a much lighter sportbike than the FZR1000 I ride.  My cousin's Kawasaki ZX11 is even heavier at around 600 pounds, but once the machine is in motion it only takes about one pound of force on the handlebars to steer it.  A motorcycle that weighs 550 pounds is noticeably clumsy at ultraslow speeds, like in parking lot maneuvering, while something that weighs around 400 pounds (like my SV650S) is always agile.  Suzuki also makes a touring version of the SV650 called the DL 650, but the seat height is too tall for me.  Again, notwithstanding the above statement, I know a 5 foot 2 inch lady who has lowered her DL650 and tours all over Texas on it."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3akmk6,Specken_zee_Doitch,2,Sat Jun 27 16:34:02 2015 UTC,"Motorcycle touring is NOT the most popular form of motorcycle riding, but it does capture the imagination of those of us who want to experience far away places with strange sounding names.  I used to hang out with writers that were associated with motorcycle touring magazines like Rider and Road Rider and Motorcycle Consumer News, and the publishers and editors always cautioned their novice journalists to never say anything negative about any motorcycle they tested.  The reason for that was if they said something negative about the latest Hippopotamus-on-wheels offered by the Big Four, they wouldn't get any more test bikes.  And if they said something negative about a manufacturer's riding gear, they wouldn't get anymore freebies from them.  So the articles on touring glossed over the realities of touring like the tyranny of the road and how no matter how fast you ride, the sun is always going to go down and you're going to be searching for accommodation in some strange town that makes its living off of tourists.  Another thing about touring on a motorcycle is that if your wearing All The Gear All The Time (AGATT), you're dressed all wrong for getting off the motorcycle and taking a hike down to a spectacular viewpoint that's only a mile from the parking lot, and there's really no secure place on your motorcycle to hide valuable accessories from the thieving hands of local druggies that regard tourist vehicles as a shopping opportunity.  All that negativity said, my cousin took off on an 11,000 mile, 55 day tour of the western USA on his ten year old Kawasaki ZX11 which had 90,000 miles on it.  He played it by ear, stopping at local libraries and researching nearby points of interest as a guest on their computers.  And he wasn't afraid to get off the motorcycle, put on some shorts and athletic shoes and go walking to that above-mentioned scenic viewpoint.  He didn't have the best soft luggage or the expensive radar detector and his bike was so old he didn't care if somebody coveted it.  My cousin has the right attitude for enjoying life as it comes..."

motorcyclesroadtrip,3ahwf4,Iamstu,3,Sat Jun 20 09:37:55 2015 UTC,"The seat is the absolute #1 priority. Handlebar placement is #2. Multiple foot positions #3.  I've found that a good (i.e., quiet, vented) helmet makes a big difference. Padded palm (gel palm) gloves help take some of the vibration away.   I finally bought real touring boots, and while they're not great for walking around (gas stops are fine, flea markets are a bad idea), they actually made a difference in my comfort on the road.  Good-quality base layers reduce discomfort. I really like my ldcomfort.com underwear, but I'm not sure I'd spend the money again, when heatgear would probably do as well.  Mostly, on long (>400 mile) days, I take the time at each gas stop to walk around, stretch, pee, drink water whether it's hot or not, and give the bike a quick once-over. 15 minutes or so at the station, and I can ride till the tank's dry again, over and over again. It's not iron-butt fast riding, but I've put in 800 miles in back to back days and still been able to ride the third day."

motorcyclesroadtrip,3aa9i0,Uberclank,3,Thu Jun 18 16:37:19 2015 UTC,"Ok, here's a few adjustments I'd consider:  As you're coming up 97 to Chelan, hang a right on Highway 2 and head over to Coulee City.  From there head north on 155 next to Banks Lake.  It's a beautiful lake that essentially sits between two long desert buttes.  It has a single road sandwiched between the water on one side and a rock cliff on the other.  Keep going north on 155 past Grand Coulee Dam, then turn left onto Lower Columbia River Road.  Follow that along the Columbia River, and then up past Lake Omak.  It's a beautiful, fun, and largely deserted road.  The lake is fantastic as well.  I recommend stopping for a swim.  From Coleville, keep heading south on 395 a few miles to Chewelah.  From there take Flowery Trail Road east towards Idaho.  Just a fantastic stretch of road.  It doesn't look like you're getting anywhere near Coeur d'Alene, but for the record Highway 97 which runs along the east side of the lake is hands down the best road I've ever ridden.  Crazy twisty, crazy beautiful.  As someone else in here said, there's nowhere like the Palouse in SE Washington.  In particular I love Highway 195 between Pullman and Steptoe Butte.  Again, not so much along your route.  I've never ridden it, but Highway 129 south of Clarkston/Lewiston is supposed to be epic, and everything I've seen on Google Earth seems to confirm that.  The ride south on 395 between Pendleton and John Day is hard to beat.  You are doing these long, scenic drops down rolling hills, then at the end you go into a forest and the road follows a twisty river through the valley.    Anyway, hope that helps.  Have a great time."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3aa9i0,YourFairyGodmother,2,Thu Jun 18 19:39:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip on Flowery Trail road, that looks like a nice one. That days ride is only 195 miles as it is, but that would trim it a bit more. Looks like a nice ride though, I will play with some route ideas to add that in  129 and 395 have been added to what is likely going to become our new route home. It stretches it out to 500 miles which is pretty typical for us on a long day.  Thank you for the ideas. I am going to have a long 30 day wait ahead of me."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3aa9i0,propheticjoker,3,Fri Jun 19 00:20:31 2015 UTC,"After the Going to the Sun road through GNP you'll be very close to Canada and can ride ride up to it if you like.     Highly recommend getting campsite reservations.  We didn't, and then showed up later than we planned. Had to ride west out of the park then north on a dirt road for 12 or 15 miles then back into the park then south on an extremely rough dirt road 10 miles.  On the up side the campsite was very, very quiet - only one other site taken.    ETA: Gas up in Lewiston then head south on 129.  The Snake River Canyon beckons.  You'll want to turn around at the Oregon end of it (flat and boring down to Enterprise) and head back through.  You might want to do as I did and then run it back and forth again.  It's that good.    Or you could continue south to  Enterprise, work your way over to La    Grande then take 244 to Ukiah. Get the elk burger at the restaurant in Ukiah.  Then it's a lovely ride down 395 to Long Creek.  There you pick up 442 over through Monument to 19.  North on 19. It's a nice enough road but the geology is awesome - part of the Journey Through Time scenic loop.   Then of course you come into Spray and then ... and then ... and gentlemen and then ... pick up 218 at Fossil.  I KNOW you know the way home from there. But of course it's best if you go over NF 42(?) Oregon Skyline Drive to Clackamas River Rd.  ETA2: That route is how we went through OR from PDX to GNP.  Haven't done the very northern Cascades so can't be much help there.        ETA3: you should post to /r/pnwriders and better, pnwriders.com - they'll have ALL the answers."

If you want bang for your buck stick with the major Japanese brands. KTM and BMW make fantastic bikes too, but for much more $$. If I had a choice of any bike I'd take the new 1200GS, but since I don't have anywhere near that kind of money I'll likely end up with a low mileage V-Strom."

motorcyclesroadtrip,3a21ts,Opinionated_Jerk,2,Fri Jun 26 23:20:11 2015 UTC,Tough call. The RT is a more comfortable ride and better suited for touring... But a 100k mile beemer for $4k will need something big fixed in the near future. If I had to choose between the 2... The Bonnie wins. If it were me I'd save a little more money and get a liter bike with hard bags. Good luck.

Do you only use it as long as the battery lasts and thats it? Do you have additional batteries with you? Do you charge them on your bike?

motorcyclesroadtrip,39vff5,Achilles8857,3,Mon Jun 15 03:10:19 2015 UTC,"500 miles will take you an entire day. Every time.   I'll somewhat echo that. I've got a history of loving mileage and most days I ride on a trip I eat 500 miles, sometimes going as high as 800. That does mean, though, that it's all day. I ride from sun up to sun down, stopping only for an few hours of gas and meals. I skimp on photos. I didn't care much: the saddle time was my favorite set of memories and I would have enjoyed it less if I paused in my windy roads. So yes, you can do it, but it will be without much of a cushion.  Now, that said: take as a template this route between Cedar City, UT and Del Norte, CO. It's the route planning I did for my Maine to SF journey a few years back. The area into and out of Durango and Grand Staircase-Escalante paid off huge. For extra mileage and a few big names, you can tweak this to cut it so that you come into Durango from the north and pass through Ouray and Moab, though that's untested by me..  When leaving California, 120 through Yosemite is good to me. Your call if you want to go through via Sonoroa or Groveland. Coming out of Colorado, I'll leave it to you. I've cut clear across both Texas and Kansas in the past. Both are flat, which Texas being hot and dead along I-10. I'd personally go south-east through Oklahoma and start finding exciting roads in Arkansas and Louisiana from there. All my other advice and experience are either N/S along the east coast or too far north of the Gulf Coast to be useful. That said, I think bending north through Colorado and Utah is totally worth the extra bend to the north early on. Those are some of my favorite miles I've done west of the Mississippi."

I did a similar trip in a car, and highly recommend going through the Yosemite area towards Zion NP, and then east via Santa Fe. You don't have to actually go through the parks, but those areas are really beautiful.  Once you get east of CO or NM, it gets much less interesting ;)"
motorcyclesroadtrip,39vff5,livefast6221,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:49:56 2015 UTC,"500 miles a day is a LOT. I've done a couple of road trips across this country. Longest one was 4000 miles and my longest day was 600 miles from Denver to Kansas City. If you try to do 500 miles every day, you won't make it. Your body won't have any time to recover and you won't have any time to see sights or do anything.   You can't just look at the map and say ""I can do 500 miles in ten hours easy"". Don't forget that every gas/piss stop ends up being 20-30 minutes whether you plan it that way or not. Don't forget that rain my force you to pull off. And you said you're taking the scenic route... Many of those roads are 35-45 mph and not ideal conditions which will slow you down even more. 500 miles will take you an entire day. Every time. My advice would be to plan no more than 250-300 miles a day. One or two days of 400+ is fine, but don't do it every day. And if you can, take a day or two off in between. Pick a city you really want to see and spend two nights there instead of one. Good for your body to recharge. Oh, and don't forget the cardinal rule of road tripping; if you don't bring it, you'll need it. The big two: foul weather gear and an emergency tool kit. Always better to have and not need than the other way around.   Good luck. Crossing this Continent on two wheels is one of the greatest experiences out there."
motorcyclesroadtrip,39vff5,RiPont,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:27:05 2015 UTC,"500 miles a day is a LOT.   ++  That's a lot, even in a nice, comfortable car.   Sure, you can do it for a day.  Maybe two.  Then, you start finding yourself sore after 200 miles one day.  Do you push on?  At 300 miles after 100 miles of being sore already, do you keep pushing past the point where it's safe?  Or you meet some really cool people and they invite you to hang out for a day or two doing $SomethingReallyCool.  Or you find yourself in a place that is just really cool and you want to spend a few hours there.  But oops!  You've only done 200 miles so far that day.  My advice is leave yourself an extra week of padding.  Two weeks if you can of extra padding.  Don't even reserve your motels ahead of time.  Get a good night's sleep every night.  Get an early start.  Take long, frequent stretch breaks before you start noticing soreness and fatigue.  Take a nap if you start noticing mental fatigue.  Take an hour break if you feel dehydrated (and hydrate, obviously).  Start planning where you're going to sleep at lunch time.  Make a reservation at your next gas stop.  Check in to your room before the bugs come out.  Walk to downtown and get a beer."
motorcyclesroadtrip,39vff5,livefast6221,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:40:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. The tighter your trip is planned in terms of how much mileage you have to cover in a day, the less enjoyable it will be. If you have specific reasons to be in certain cities on certain dates, make those your tentpoles then build as much flexibility into the rest of the trip as possible. The story of how you crossed the country on two wheels in 6 days has 3 seconds of shock value. The dozens of stories and memories you'll have from doing the road trip right will be awesome for a lifetime."

motorcyclesroadtrip,39vff5,grunge_ryder,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:57:12 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with other posters that riding 500 miles a day is a lot of riding.  I was only riding 350 miles a day on my first interstate tour from Los Angeles to Seattle and back, but ten hours a day in the saddle (and it was a custom saddle, that was supposed to be comfortable) just about split me in two.  After I got home I spent a few days flat on my back with my hand up my butt pushing back a protruding loop of lower intestine that was trying to get out...  While I'm at it, I might as well tell you guys about CES, or Cauda Equina Syndrome.  There is a sheaf of nerves coming out of your lower spine, and if your corpse was dissected and all those nerves were spread out, they would look like a horse's tail (cauda equine, in Latin).  The first signs of CES is when you can't feel your butt any more.  Every rider has had numb butt, but it gets worse.  After the numb butt, you can't feel your penis anymore.  Numb butt and numb prick don't necessarily mean you've done permanent damage though.  When feeling comes back, grab the head of your dick and squeeze it.  If your butthole contracts like you've just ejaculated, you haven't done any permanent damage to your reproductive system, but doctors would say that you have insulted it."

I rode over Sonora Pass with two crazies several years ago and I'll never forget how those nut jobs rode ever time the open road opened up.  They wanted to ride through this beautiful scenery at 120 mph, pausing only for a smoke now and then.  I took my time and caught up to them every time they were stubbing their butts out.  I found a beautiful little stream in Sonora Pass and stopped and took my boots off and was soaking my hot feet in the ice cold water, then the self-appointed leader came back to see what had happened to me.  I told him that, if there was an accident, it would take an hour for the ambulance to arrive from Bishop and one of us could be dead by then.  He said, ""Well, maybe if we're having too much fun, we'd better quit right now.""  They didn't even want to stop at Bodie or Mono Lake, they had to ride 120 mph to get to Bishop to avoid the possibility of being sprinkled on by a dubious rainstorm in the distance.

We rode Sonora to Big Trees via primarily forest routes.  It was absolutely beautiful.  Since it was just friends we got to ride all 3 bikes.    The KTM 1190 is an amazing machine, an absolute rocket ship.  It really gets your heart pumping on the trails, it's so heavy and powerful you can get in trouble in a hurry if you're not careful.  I had it at 120 on a familiar stretch of road near my friend's house, and it felt like I was barely tickling it.  The BMW was actually my least favorite, just didn't have enough power for me.  It was a beautifully smooth and comfortable bike - just a little too docile for my taste.  The KTM 690 Enduro was a kick in the pants on the trails, with the right tires it would take about anything you could throw at it.  It had a lot of vibration and was the least comfortable on the highway, but had plenty of power.  It would be fun around town or for some weekend trail riding, but I wouldn't want to do a lot of miles on it.  It would make a kick ass supermoto - too bad they won't sell it here."

motorcyclesroadtrip,39fgv0,libertygeared,22,Thu Jun 11 12:37:34 2015 UTC,"I think that is also part of the point of todays Route 66. The original route was people migrating during the Dust Bowl and people were desiring to move west. Boom towns were setup to capitalize on the migration and make a nickel. After that, it remained a popular route west and spawned it's own road-culture. Route 66's demise came about due to the development of the Interstate system, and like it's manifestation due to a particular need was subsequently cast aside as it was no longer needed #MURICA. The boom towns died and development moved away from the route and closer to the interstate.    Even today, parts of ""Historical Route 66"" is the interstate and then runs along side it, this being mostly out west.    But along the route are still some interesting highlights, especially the natural wonders out west like the Grand Canyon, the Petrified Forest and the Meteor Crater. Even the abandoned towns are interesting as part of the history of Route 66.     Route 66 also taps into the now nostalgic idea of manifest destiny; that it was every American's eventual desire to conquer the lands west of the Mississippi and that life there would be better (even though we had little to no proof of that). Even today, us Eastern Coast dwellers have a tendency to comment about how it is in California, an idea that brings us back to the idea that somewhere out west is better.    So is there not much going on there? Probably. But then again, if you want busy body stuff, you can always go to Bike Week or Sturgis; they always have plenty of stuff going on."

motorcyclesroadtrip,39fgv0,0xdeadf001,7,Thu Jun 11 12:41:55 2015 UTC,"Really, it would mostly be sad, disappointing, with lots of freeway miles.  If you're going to come to the States to ride (and you should!!), there are much better places to ride.  Route 66 is more of a memory, now, than a reality."
motorcyclesroadtrip,39fgv0,fake_belmondo,5,Thu Jun 11 19:24:17 2015 UTC,"My brother did a section ... he drove (in a cage) east from California to Grand Canyon, I believe.  He enjoyed that, but from what I heard, you pass the interesting natural bits in the mountains and you are in desolate abandoned area.  EDIT: If you want iconic US route, do HWY1 along the California Coast. It's beautiful scenery, it's thriving. It is busy (not that ""badlands"" there is no one around for hours"" feeling, but it's worth it. That is my bucket list. Both on a motorcycle, and on a bike)."
motorcyclesroadtrip,39fgv0,YourFairyGodmother,2,Thu Jun 11 17:44:29 2015 UTC,For the last eight years when I lived in Oregon I made a coast run at least once a year. I had ridden it but once or twice in the preceding thirty years of riding. It is an absolute must ride.

motorcyclesroadtrip,39fgv0,eskimoboob,2,Thu Jun 11 14:54:05 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but which Route 66 are you going to be on? The route was realigned so many times as new sections were built, which one is the correct one? I live a few blocks from ""Route 66"" in the Chicago area. Nothing special about it here except a few signs, maybe a few route-66 themed motels or convenience stores and that's about it. You'd have much more fun picking some sights that you've always wanted to see, and if an old section of Route 66 happens to be in the area, you could always ride it just to say you did."

Hundreds of other things to see on alternate routes along the way. There is a reason that a lot/the majority of old Rt66 is old and decrepit now."

Lots of stoplights, basically looks like any other road. Barely marked. I mean just look at the turn by turn directions in that [link!](www.historic66.com/missouri/de1.html) I had a friend visiting from Japan who wanted to see it and was pretty disappointed when we tried driving on it.

motorcyclesroadtrip,39fgv0,Frequent-Flyer,2,Fri Jun 12 05:55:34 2015 UTC,"As a fellow European who now lives in the US, I will say my favorite part of riding here are the wide open long straight roads, especially in the South West.  Don't get me wrong, I love the twisties as much as anyone, but we've got really good twisties in Europe.  Riding through the painted dessert in Arizona, stopping for gas on an Indian reservation in New Mexico or just taking one of those roads in Wyoming where the 2 lane blacktop goes on so long and so straight that it ends in a dot on the horizon that's the reason to come and ride in America."
motorcyclesroadtrip,39fgv0,wiseleyb,2,Fri Jun 12 08:08:21 2015 UTC,"Back in the days before interstates or major highways (pre-1950's), Route 66 was one of the few roads that ran continuously for a long distance. As a result, a lot of people used Route 66 as the main way to take a cross country trip! It is a two-lane road, so many tourist attractions and cool hotels popped up along the side. Many of these would have signs and other graphics to attract visitors (even if the actual thing wasn't that cool).   So, route 66 gained this reputation for being an awesome cross-country road trip. With the implementation of interstates and the improvement done to other highways, Route 66 became inefficient, and people eventually stopped using it. A lot of the original attractions, stores, and hotels are gone. Today, Route 66 is more of a nostalgic and touristy highway. There are still a some of the road-side places left, but not as many. I havent done any appreciable continuous distance on it, but there are several small towns and some neat attractions, still.   Ride it and take pictures! Post them up here! We all would love to see it."

motorcyclesroadtrip,39fgv0,KevinBrown,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:00:22 2015 UTC,"Much of the old Route 66 is under interstate freeway or closed and abandoned.  There are still some remaining sections that are open to traffic, but even then, you are often on a parallel road that just follows the old route.  I recently took the old 66 to bypass some construction traffic on I-15 in California, it was little more than a frontage road that the nearby town had painted a big ""Route 66"" logo on every half dozen miles or so.  The road surface was horrible and it was only drivable for a few miles before it was closed off with concrete barriers and you were forced onto the Interstate."
motorcyclesroadtrip,39fgv0,Earth2Andy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:16:30 2015 UTC,"Fly into Albuquerque, rent a bike, ride down where 66 runs through there, go to the Old Town shops... Fly home.  As far as I can tell, that's the best part of the route anymore."

Meteor Crator, Grand Canyon, Petrified Forrest, Vegas etc.  Good mix of interesting things as well as true small town America (which as a European you may not have experienced) with just enough faded kitch route 66 things to take some great photos.  On the whole there are much better rides to do across America.  +1 for whoever said California Highway 1, maybe make it a loop and take in Yosemite, Sequoia, maybe Joshua Tree, Death Valley and Vegas?"

motorcyclesroadtrip,3970qd,sokratesz,4,Sun Jun 14 21:06:12 2015 UTC,"Get a National Park season pass. It's $80; the parks themselves are scenic, and the roads through & to most (Death Valley, Yosemite, Sequoia, King's Canyon, Glacier, Rocky Mountain, Redwoods, Shenandoah, Big Bend, Zion, Canyonlands, &c) are awesome.   But unless you're really into canyons, the Grand Canyon is the park to skip. I mean, the park itself is nice, but the roads suck. The ride out there is 300 miles across a windy, flat, barren plateau. (& the freeway from Vegas is no great shakes, either).    The route to the north, on the other hand, is highly scenic and the roads are awesome. Yosemite => Death Valley => Vegas => Zion =>Bryce Canyon=> Capitol Reef=> Monument Valley=> Moab=>Durango    The route to the south is also more scenic, & the highways are some of the best in the country. Wickenburg => Prescott => Sedona => Payson => Alpine => Silver City.  Aside from that, I highly recommend the highways around: Eureka, CA; Fresno, CA; Riverside, CA; Lewiston, ID; Spearfish, SD; &/or Silver City, NM."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3970qd,cortechthrowaway,3,Tue Jun 9 22:41:21 2015 UTC,"Yosemite => Death Valley => Vegas => Zion =>Bryce Canyon=> Capitol Reef=> Monument Valley=> Moab=>Durango    That's a nice route, and would add Bodie, which is just west of Yosemite.   Also Capitol Reef=>Monument Valley, make sure include route 261 to go through the Moki Dugaway(aka Mokey Dugaway).  Thrilling 1100 foot elevation change within 3 miles. Route has other beautiful spots like Goosenecks State Park   Wickenburg => Prescott => Sedona => Payson => Alpine => Silver City.   If going from So Ca, the above is a nice trip. Before Wickenburg go through Angles Crest Hwy CA, Big Bear CA, to Oatman AZ. This next stretch towards Kingman, is one of few stretches of original 66, in its original condition. More special that it is that old narrow road, twisting through the mountain. After Alpine, Silver City is a pretty route, but I'd skip that to go down the 191. It takes you through about 100 miles of twists, and probably wont see another car the whole stretch. Probably longest twisties in the States. Next noteworthy stop would be Texas Hill Country, including the Three Sisters.   If you're doing the trip in hottest summer months, I'd skip Utah, Nevada, Arizona. Instead, from Yellowstone, go to Missoula Mt. From there to Lewiston ID. Some of prettiest greenery in the country. From Lewiston I'd go past Portland and ride the coast the rest of the way down.   During your visit from San Francisco, Highway 1 along the coast, to at least Fort Bragg is a must do ride.   In your jacket, carry a spare key, travel size wetwipes or tissues, few dollars in quarters. I also keep glove liners in my jacket. They pack small, and will wear with regular gloves for more warmth, or on their own if warm weather. I keep a bandana in jacket, tied to handlebar and in pocket. They have 1000s of uses and take no room. In your wallet have emergency contact info on a bright piece of paper. Have roadside assistance. AAA rv with mc coverage, or check with your insurance. Just the peace of mind if were to run out of gas is worth it.    If no tankbag, I bring blue tape, put map in large ziplock and tape to tank. Have a place to put a water bottle. Ebay has cheap holders that clamp to handlebars. Sports bottle with bendy straw works well with fullface. Unless it's a cold time of year, I don't bother with rainsuit. Takes more space, rarely need, if warm rain feels nice, and by the time I pull over to put on I'm already wet, so it's more uncomfortable having on than staying wet. I don't camp. Mostly since I don't like taking the extra gear it needs. I don't bother with taking pics or diary. Doing that makes me plan and focus on framing a story, instead of soaking it all in. Makes a trip seem like work. Trips taken 20+ years ago, I have no regrets not having a scrap book. Not everyone feels like me on that though."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3970qd,IllIII,3,Wed Jun 10 05:36:43 2015 UTC,"NJ, PA, OH, IA, IS are going to be pretty lame in comparison to the other states. I did a trip last year moving from PA to CA and the country really opens up a lot in that direction, so if this is in order you're in for a great progression.  South Dakota, no question check out the Badlands and Black Hills Wyoming, be careful around Yellowstone as it gets really crowded in the summer - that was a 12hr day for me... In general stay off interstates and stick to country highways. I used Harley Davidson's Ride Planner to do all my mapping, it was pretty great.  As for packing list, I would add: Maps (you'll have cell service almost everywhere but maps are way more fun) Food (I carried peanut butter) Water (I had a huge camel back that I threw in my tank bag so I could drink without stopping Motorcycle cover Chain lube! Chain lube!! Chain lube!!! Paper towels and shop towels Pen/paper First aid Plastic bags Spare bike key Sunscreen Toothbrush for chain  Oh and a go-pro if u can. totally worth it.  Ride on."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3970qd,spikehead44,2,Tue Jun 9 19:28:28 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Mt. Rushmore in SD and The Devil's Tower in WY. Might as well knock those off your bucket list while you're out there. Also, and I know some people don't like them, but I HIGHLY recommend carrying a GPS along with your maps. Finding the closest hotels, food and gas stations is incredibly helpful. In the east we're kind of spoiled to where you can stop at practically any highway exit and there will be a gas station. In CO, UT, AZ, CA, WY you might travel 20 miles to the next exit and there will be NOTHING there but a road. It looks really odd the first time you see a completely barren highway exit, but there are plenty out west. A GPS will keep you from running out of gas as well as keep you from getting lost. You might also want to consider keeping a log of your trip. Something you can look at years from now."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3970qd,Opinionated_Jerk,3,Tue Jun 9 21:34:53 2015 UTC,"One thing I'd recommend, especially considering the very sparse populations of some of the areas you're planning on riding through, is get something to carry extra gas in.  As far as camping goes, bare minimum, you'll need:   sleeping bag Two tarps, one to put between you and the ground, the other to tie off to the bike and stake into the ground to keep the elements off of you. This is MUCH faster than a tent and works pretty well. I've weathered pretty intense thunderstorms in setups like this without getting wet. Mini gas stove and propane. Something like this. A way to transport 1 day's worth of water and food. Easy to cook food. Hot dogs and buns are a good candidate. Canned soup is excellent. Instant oatmeal is solid. Fork, spoon, plate. You can use the soup can for a bowl. A couple of stakes to use to tie down the corners of your tarp so it isn't collapsing on you. Ball of twine. This stuff is unbelievably useful. A book to read once you've stopped for the night. Seriously, this will improve your ride so much. Some matches if you feel like starting a campfire at some point. Just know the laws in the areas that you ride through.   The cooking equipment is assuming you aren't going to just stop at a McDonald's. If you are going to do that, tarps, twine, sleeping bag, book, stakes. Matches if you want some campfire action.  One other thing to note about camping, it WILL get cold when you're out there. Pack accordingly.  The route you've chosen is pretty good. Personally, I'd take the scenic route through Idaho and Oregon, then head down the coast. Especially after the mind numbingly flatness of everything between Pennsylvania and Wyoming, I'd want to maximize my time spent in twisties. If this trip is about the ride and not the stops, I'd recommend powering through the flat states to allow you the most time possible to take detours for fun roads."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3970qd,Th3JourneyMan,4,Tue Jun 9 19:43:00 2015 UTC,"As far as camping goes,   Don't camp unless you really can't afford motels or really, really love camping.  A good night's sleep and an early start makes a huge difference in how much range you can cover the next day and still be safe and enjoyable.  And I wouldn't reserve your motel ahead of time, either.  Start thinking about where you're going to end up at lunch time.  Use your smartphone to find appropriately affordable places as you take stretch breaks closer to wherever you're going to reach.  ...but don't try that around major holidays.

I think the must see stuff for me was Badlands, Mt Rushmore, Sturgis if that's your thing, Devil's tower. WY highway 16 from Buffalo to Ten Sleep.  Yellowstone, Grand Teton.  After that I went up through Idaho and Oregon to Crater Lake and down the coast, but I'd recommend going south, taking 50 through Nevada to Lake Tahoe, then drop down to Yosemite then to Dan Francisco.  If you can, you should do as much of CA Highway 1 north of the golden gate as you can, it's stunning!!!"
motorcyclesroadtrip,3970qd,Earth2Andy,2,Fri Jun 12 08:35:25 2015 UTC,"Gear: spare bolts, spare nuts. Baling wire. Wire. Fuses. Tool set. manual (on PDF on iPad if possible). Headlight. AAA card for cheap tow. Tie-downs, zip-ties. Loc-tite. Cell phone. Contact list of people you know enroute with a garage.  As time goes on things will loosen, things will shift. You have to be prepared for any kind of spare loss you can reasonably carry. Headlight bulb. Taillight bulb. That sort of thing (not sure what kind of bike you have). One of those cargo nets. Bags. Duct tape."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3970qd,Opinionated_Jerk,0,Tue Jun 9 19:15:35 2015 UTC,If you're worrying about nuts and bolts then you need to get a different vehicle. Bulbs can be picked up at any bike dealership or auto parts store. LocTite should be applied before leaving to relieve yourself of having to carry nuts and bolts. Bailing wire? Zip ties? What the heck kind of bike do you have? Whatever you do don't go far on it.
motorcyclesroadtrip,3970qd,IllIII,2,Tue Jun 9 21:25:23 2015 UTC,"I'm with you there. Carrying extra bulbs is a waste of space for delicate part. By the time it's need, filament will be broken. This isn't the 50s. At least every 40 miles is a 24hr supermarket with inexpensive bulbs, flat kits, cheap tools and basic hardware. We now carry phones, so never alone. Get roadside assistance  for out of gas or tow situations.   I've also done 48 States, Canada, and Mexico. 1000+ mile days are common. Anything that needs to be tied up, a bandana works fine. A pocket knife can do a lot to patch up and get me someplace better than the side of the road to fix.   Bolt holding on the exhaust doesn't just break. Exhaust pipe would be loose, like a broken hanger first. You'd catch that doing a walk around when getting gas. You hear and feel something different as you ride. Don't ignore stuff that feels different.  Biggest mistake on a roadtrip is over packing. It's more than the weight and bulk. It makes it a hassle to find anything. Worrying about all that stuff is a burden. It's very liberating having minimal gear instead."

The most I ever did in a 24 hour period was Beatty NV to Jackson WY which was 850 miles and I'll never do that again if I can help it. How was Mexico and when were you there? I've often though about traveling there, but the safety question has always bothered me."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3970qd,IllIII,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:30:19 2015 UTC,"Furthest into Mexico was Cabo, about 15 years ago. That was about 1100 miles over the border, around 2400 mile round trip. It's been about 3 years since I've last crossed the border.   I know what you mean about Mx safety. Currently I'd be comfortable in the border towns, and tourist areas. I've always liked going further than that though. Don't know I'd be ok with an out of the way destination right now.   When I lived in Ca, would go over the border all the time. Stuff like after work, would often do a quick run to Puerto Nuevo for lobster and return home. PN is only about 30 miles over the border for about a 250 mile round trip from where I lived.   I did a lot of longer trips too. Always had a great time, wonderful people, no trouble. I was an idiot once, lost my key on the beach. Local handyman hotwired my bike for me. While he worked on it, his wife made us a meal in their home's modest kitchen. Lots of good experiences like that, typical of how nice people were, outside of the populated areas. The popular, touristy areas still nice people, but more of a hustle."
motorcyclesroadtrip,3970qd,Opinionated_Jerk,2,Wed Jun 10 08:11:56 2015 UTC,You've clearly never had a bolt holding your exhaust on shear in the middle of nowhere.
motorcyclesroadtrip,3970qd,hazmatte,0,Tue Jun 9 21:26:08 2015 UTC,Nope. I know mechanical issues happen. But if your vehicle is in such poor condition it shouldn't be ridden long distance. I've traveled to 46 states by motorcycle and into Canada as well and I've only had one major mechanical issue. The trick is to prepare your vehicle before you leave. And if you can't prepare it enough because it's falling apart then you're taking a risk by going far from home.

It looks so innocent on the map.  There's a residential area on the first part.  It's even numbered the same as Skyline Blvd!  ...except there's a part of it that just randomly turns into a glorified 1-lane goat trail with potholes, unmarked 5mph turns, and natives in Subaru Outbacks hurling around the turns the other way.

motorcyclesroadtrip,38mwr5,timp_bizkit,2,Fri Jun 5 07:14:25 2015 UTC,"Hey all sorry about the delay..I am still in mongolia and the Internet is a little shoddy at best. The bikes that we had were called Shinrey Mustangs (150 cc). They are the quintessential Mongolian motorcycle and you will see them all over the countryside (makes getting parts easy if necessary). My friend and I bought the bikes in Darkhan city from the market there for 1.5 million tug rugs which is roughly 750 US dollars. In order to get the bikes registered it is required to have a Mongolian address which was a bit of a hiccup but after several hours at the ""dmv"" a staffer took pity on my friend and gave his Mongolian address ( haha wouldn't rely on this being the case everywhere though). Technically you are required to have an international drivers license with motorcycle certification; my friend and I had neither but all we ever had to do was pay a fine of 5000 tug rugs (2.50) when pulled over; but again I think we were pretty lucky. My friend and I started in Darkhan city and drove south through ulaanbaatar to Sainshand, in the gobi desert. From there we went north and then west into the Orkhan valley  in central mongolia ( best area of mongolia IMO), and from there we went north to lake hovsgol. It was an absolutely incredible trip. The weather is a tempting and cruel mistress and days will often start off nice and end up in snow. High Winds are a constant pain in the ass as well so be prepared. Mechanically the bikes were superficially unsound (bolts would fly off the bike mid ride...chain would randomly loosen) but we never had trouble with anything important such as the motor or transmission. Drivers here are fucking crazy but luckily when you get out of the city drivers are few and far between particularly on the back roads. mongolia has roughly 40,000km of roads and only 5000km of those are paved so prepare for a bumpy ride. With that being said Mongolia is one of the few countries where you are truly free to go wherever you want, you are allowed to camp pretty much everywhere and if you end up getting lost (which will happen) there is always the trusty ger positioning system...just ride up to a ger, enjoy some milk tea, and try to decipher the nomads vague gesterings. The people in the countryside are very friendly and accommodating and have no problem with randoms cruising up to their house, just watch out for dogs because they are large and they can be pretty viscous. I hope I answered y'all's questions, if you have anymore let me know"

I know a couple Mongolians that are studying here in Japan, and they are without a doubt a couple of the kindest people I have ever met. How did you withdraw money? I have an American debit card, alongside a Vietnamese and Japanese withdrawal card. I'm assuming ATM are commonplace in the bigger cities.  Also, what about accommodations? Did you frequently camp out? Are hotels or hostels common, and if so, are they relatively cheap? Money is short at the moment, but I'd love to go in the next couple months."

motorcyclesroadtrip,38lf4v,Cpt_Galactor,2,Thu Jun 4 23:45:31 2015 UTC,"I've ridden some routes between the Finger Lakes and Maryland a few times. I've also done both directions of NY to MI across southern Canada. Here are some thoughts.  Plan at least two days in each direction for the Maryland-New-York segment if you plan on backroads-only. Three is a safer bet. Especially if you're camping, setting up and tearing down will eat into your daylight riding time. When my wife and I have ridden in that area, we generally rode backroads in the morning into the early afternoon, then slabbed the rest to the hotel we had chosen. Binghamton, NY to Richmond, VA was a full 10-12 hour day in that manner; Binghamton, NY to Norfolk, VA via Skyline Drive was a full two days.  A word of warning about Pennsylvania. There are loads of fun, curvy backroads. It's awesome, but they are also used by giant logging/coal/etc. trucks that will take the full width of the lane and trundle along at 15mph or less. So, keep your eyes and ears open and you wits about your around those bends and hills.  Canada is fun - we found some good backroads on the north side of Lake Ontario, northeast of Toronto. Time constraints meant our second crossing was just slab through London and Hamilton. The most important thing I'd tell you is to check your forms of payment before you go. Canadian card readers are mostly chip & pin, not magstripe, and ""debit card"" means a different thing. Consider grabbing some Canadian cash, if you can. And, though it's cliche, remember both speed limits and fuel volumes will be in metric. ;)"

My advice is: keep things flexible--there's nothing worse than riding in the rain / dark because you're locked into an itinerary.

But we'll see when I get to the USA where the bigger CCs are required.  I will likely take one of the more in depth motorcycle safety courses.  Here 153 CCs is sufficient.

motorcyclesroadtrip,38b6z9,shartshooter,2,Wed Jun 3 06:26:35 2015 UTC,"Agree - Cornwall and Wales are great.  This time of year however, Cornwall gets busy and the roads are often crowded.  I suggest Wales.  There are fewer people, lots of nice twisties and the views are great. Avoid the built up areas of South Wales and head for the Brecons. North Wales is also dramatic. For a start, head along the M4 to get into the area fairly quickly."

You can have fun getting there too.  The M4 will get you there in two dull hours of three-lane highway.  Alternatively, take the scenic route.  From London, North West are the Chilterns, intimate, overpopulated but beautiful wooded countryside, then Oxfordshire and Oxford itself,  from Burford on the A40 (unpleasant at this stage, epic later on), cut down from through the Cotswolds to Bristol on long, fast Roman roads.  Over the bridge is the Wye Valley, a classic bike road, taking you to Monmouth and Abergavenny - from where you can't go wrong.  Personal favourite, the A483 from Llandovery to Builth Wells, with a detour over the mountain road to Tregaron."

motorcyclesroadtrip,38b6z9,BikerBoon,5,Wed Jun 3 13:11:44 2015 UTC,"In that case Wales is definitely do-able, and has some excellent scenery and riding roads. If you do head up that way Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons are probably the best areas in my opinion. From North Wales you could head east to the Peak District, the Snake Pass (A57 between Glossop and Ladybower Reservoir) is very popular with bikers but it'll be closed until 14th June for repairs. The Cat and Fiddle (A537) between Macclesfield and Buxton is also extremely popular but very technically demanding. Heading south from there Matlock is a big biker hotspot and there's plenty of bike shops and usually a lot of bikes there if the weather is nice. From there it's pretty easy to get on the M1 and get back to London.  If you're planning on staying closer to London then there's the Ace Cafe in London itself, which is a bike hotspot, but beyond that I can't think of any motorcycle-specific tourist spots you might want to see. I'm not a Londoner though so some other folks might be able to give you a better idea."
motorcyclesroadtrip,387adw,SeepingGoatse,6,Tue Jun 2 10:44:17 2015 UTC,"I witnessed my friend die on a motorcycle, right in front of me during a ride. I parked my bike and didn’t get back on it for a little over a year. When I finally decided to ride again, I did it in a big way, I rode across Europe! I later became a Motorcycle Riding Coach and taught others safe riding skills, I felt this was my way of giving back and lifting some of the pain I felt for the loss of my friend. Good for you for getting back in the saddle! The best bet for a cheap ride is Craigslist, give it time and the perfect ride will pop up at the perfect price!!"
motorcyclesroadtrip,387adw,Snappus,4,Tue Jun 2 12:33:24 2015 UTC,"Good on you for building up the courage to ride to visit your friend.

motorcyclesroadtrip,387adw,Hacki_1st,3,Wed Jun 3 21:54:19 2015 UTC,They say that you shouldn't ride when you're angry. I'd say that should extend to any time you're emotional. Perhaps while visiting your friend who has passed would not be the best first time to hop on a bike? At least give it a few weeks of getting back in the swing of things.

I've taken that route via car up through Moab to Grand Junction.  I'm guessing you'd want to take spare gas just in case on a bike.

motorcyclesroadtrip,384cyz,briansteuber,9,Mon Jun 1 19:38:50 2015 UTC,"My name is Brian Eric Steuber. I want to tell you how Harley-Davidson saved my life and helps me battle PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder from my 2 tours in Iraq) daily.   For a person like myself who served in the military for almost 9 years. Who also went to combat twice, once in 2003-2004 and again in 2005-2006 I came back with many physical injuries (no body parts missing). But the worst injuries are the ones you can’t see. Those injuries are PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). The memories, flashbacks, night-sweats and anger issues at times are calmed by a wonderful woman in my life. My wife. But still there is that 50% that she can’t help. That’s where my 2001 Harley-Davidson Road King  has come in to play.  For any and all Harley-Davidson owners there is something that in intangible about owning a Harley-Davidson. For those who don’t, you just will never understand what that is. A person could by an $80,000 import or domestic mode of transportation. That person could have some problems at home and they get in that expensive tin can and still have those problems when they return home. Yes you could close your windows and blast the music until your ears bleed and sing your heart out. But you still will not solve any problems. You will return with nothing sorted out and nothing gained.  That important 50% of where my problems exist, disappear. As a 100% disabled veteran I chose a different route, rather than sitting back and taking a bunch of medications and collecting my disability check. It is all without the help of a drug, therapy or any other modern medicine supposedly to help you in recovering. My medical prescription is 800 plus pounds of American made metal and chrome. She might be older than most bikes but she is mine. I ride her at least 3 times a week. Rain, sleet, snow, wind…whatever kind of whether comes up. I am out there riding. It might not be a long ride, if the conditions are horrible (around my block) or it might not be actually outside. Like when my wife and I lived in an apartment. All winter I rode up and down the apartment parking area under the building for hours as I blast Five Finger Death Punch ”Remember Everything” and Papa Roach “Before I die”  Why? Because anytime I had an issue. A flare up of my problems or I got angry. I just hopped on my “Steel Horse” and peaced out mentally for a few hours. I would think about what I needed to accomplish and what my problems where and how to fix them. No medication or drug can do that.  Ask a Vietnam Vet who rides a Harley. Why they ride? Ask a World-War II vet they ride. Hell ask any veteran why they ride. Most veterans will tell you one word. Freedom.  It’s that peace of mind and the freedom to think or not think when you ride. Because you can’t think of anything else but one thing at a time. That’s why Harley is a cypher. Because it is like an algorithm, for performing a decryption for your brain and your thoughts that might be locked up tight in there.  You don’t have to ride fast like most crotch rocket riders do (really they are meant to do). All you have to do I start up your “Steel Horse” and hear that sexy rumble. You feel that shake. Give the throttle one roll of the right wrist and see if it doesn’t put a smile on your face. Hell, give it two rolls of the wrist.  That feeling is a drug. That sound is intoxicating that emotional connection to an inanimate object is unparalleled to anything that is man-made. No drug can compare, no feeling is better. That’s why I ride.  Harley-Davidson has provided a thought-clearing alternative to many confrontational arguments without the use or abuse of drugs or alcohol. They provide a choice or alternative means to sort out situations in your life by providing a vehicle to clear your mind with. Where the only thing you can do is focus on 1 thing at a time.  I ride my 2001 Harley-Davidson for the sole purpose of riding for those who can't or are unable to because of the stifling issues of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) We as Harley-Davidson riders all ride for something or someone. My purpose and reason is one that is not just special to me, but special to a select percentage of the population who decided one way or another to make a sacrifice and answer a calling.  Being a soldier, service member or airmen is choosing one way or another to become part of a fraternity that knows no color, creed or religious boundaries. The brothers and sisters in arms of all generations across all wars know one thing. That we can call each other in a time of need before, during and after the battle, war or fight has ended. But for some of us the battle, war or fight will never end. Especially when it comes to PTSD. The fight against PTSD is just that, a fight. It is a daily battle that some of us have succumbed to.  But to ride for a purpose as all Harley-Davidson riders do one way or another. We all ride for something or someone. My purpose and reason is one that is not just special to me, but special to a select percentage of the population who decided one way or another to make a sacrifice and answer a calling.  I will continue my battle, my war, my fight daily as I ride my 2001 Harley-Davidson Road King and I will ride for those who can't or are unable to. Harley-Davidson is a brand that signifies the fight and the freedom in which we as soldiers, service members and airmen have gone through and some of us continue to go through because of PTSD.  I hope everyone realizes the impact on personal freedom in which the Harley-Davidson brand means. It means more than any one could ever imagine. Whether you served in any type of combat or military. There are still battles at home which individuals who are not prior or current military go through that are solved just by getting on their respective Harley-Davidson and sorting out their problems. I truly believe Harley-Davidson has saved many lives and relationships just by offering a choice to either go deeper into a problem or situation or jumping on their 'Freedom Cycle"" and sorting it out on the road.  I am, just like the millions of other Harley-Davidson riders are thankful for the opportunity of choice and the freedom of expression in which Harley-Davidson provides. I as a rider and a sufferer of PTSD from 2 combat tours… I am in Harley-Davidson’s debt and thank them from the bottom of my heart. They have saved my life on more than one occasion. GOD bless them.  Thank you so very much,  Brian Steuber 407-408-0531 Email me at briansteuber@rocketmail.com"

motorcyclesroadtrip,384cyz,ChanceTheDog,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:54:36 2015 UTC,"For me it's the active zoning out on my bike that I find to be therapeutic. I don't have to concentrate on anything but my surroundings and the throttle when I'm riding in traffic, or when I'm on a long lonely stretch I can take time to evaluate myself and what I'm doing to improve as a person.   Also, riding to social functions is a pretty big deterrent to have one too many beers. I find I stay to two and then wait it out drinking waters, because I don't feel like I can have four or five and then hop behind a wheel (impaired judgement and all that). So it's really curbed my drinking as well, and helped me realize I was using alcohol as a crutch. I've since improved my relationship with alcohol, didn't have to give it up."

Got a bike and WOAH.  Very therapeutic.    I was worried because after sustaining back to back to back concussions withing a week of each other, I have issues with standing sometimes.  It feels like the ground leans back on me.   I originally thought a bike wasn't the best choice because of that tilting... but it goes away when I ride.     Although the throttle is a bitch with all the nerve damage and phantom limb pain the rest is all good.   Maybe I should find a thumb throttle.  Or even a fatter grip would be nice."
motorcyclesroadtrip,381h84,8mmphilosopher,2,Mon Jun 1 04:05:34 2015 UTC,"Hey, looked like a nice trip. I'm curious how you picked the spots to stay overnight. Did you find campgrounds or what?"
motorcyclesroadtrip,381h84,bigBastardDude,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:53:24 2015 UTC,"When I have the opportunity, I enjoy motorcycle primitive camping and I like to stay on public land, but finding campgrounds on public land can sometimes be difficult as there is typically not much information about the campgrounds online. I mostly use Google Maps to find the campgrounds in a particular area. If Google Maps does not have any information on a national park or WMA, I try the state sites.    When I went to Daytona Bike week this year, I stated at Cackleberry's (privately owned) which was a blast; they have online reservations and were inexpensive. Another time I took a trip from Atlanta - Augusta - Savannah - Macon and I attempted to stay at Lick Fork Campground in SC, but the road was closed and blocked due to it being closed for the season (November) so I ended up riding to the Steven's Creek boat ramp (which is not a campground) and stayed there overnight.    This particular time, I knew where the John's Mountain WMA Check In station was via coordinates on the GA WMA site, but when I arrived, the station was unmanned and did not have any available information. Fortunately, I passed the campsite on the way in and knew where to go. Once I arrived, at dark, I paid $10 cash for the site and established camp. Again, there was zero information online about the campsite; it was not marked on Google Maps or anything. Online websites only listed generic information about the WMA and it's features without listing the names of campsites, trails, or their locations.    But half of the fun is getting lost and if you don't find the campground you were looking for, you can always park at a trail-head and setup camp there."

motorcyclesroadtrip,38187e,shartshooter,4,Mon Jun 1 02:58:41 2015 UTC,"You should be using less fuel when going on dirt roads as you rev much lower. Calculate your bikes actual litres/100km and then see how much you might need in an emergency.   Remember that if the weight of the fuel is affecting your bikes handling, make sure you use the extra fuel as soon as possible and not after you hit your reserve.   Always take extra siphoning tubes and a couple of cheap fuel filters. The last thing you need is to get sand into your tank."
motorcyclesroadtrip,38187e,Fruhmann,2,Mon Jun 1 12:59:57 2015 UTC,"The fuel filters are a good idea. And I actually won't be taking dirt roads very much- the fuel can is mostly a precaution, sometimes in rural Canada there's a long distance in between towns."

Kept it on the back and never thought twice about it.  Except that one leg that the bungees weren't tight enough, it fell over and hung on the muffler, burned through and drained the thing while I was riding.

motorcyclesroadtrip,37iguq,Blabberm0uth,5,Thu May 28 16:09:02 2015 UTC,"I rode an Enfield around Nepal for a few months, and also apprenticed myself to a mechanic in Pokhara.   Get an Enfield Bullet (350). They're the only way to go. It'll haul your shit, and every mechanic will have parts for it. Take time to buy it. If you blast into town saying ""I need a bike in a day"" then you'll get shafted, some foreigner or mechanic will sell you a piece of shit for beaucoup de rupees. Take some time, ride it, and haggle a bit. The final cost of the bike will be inversely proportional to the amount of chai you drink while you haggle. If you drink around a hundred thousand cups they'll pay you to take it and fill the tank before you go. I paid the equivalent of $800AUD for mine, and it was pretty damn good and it was mine within about 5 days from when I started asking. They will ALL have problems. Ditto with other shitty bikes. Otherwise there's a little 100cc Yammy (can't remember the make) is pretty ubiquitious, it just may struggle to haul much shit up windy hairpins if you're carrying luggage. But all the firangs ride Bullets, just because they're classic and look good. Watch mechanics while they work on your bike. Otherwise they'll switch out good brake pads for bad ones and rape your bike for parts, and do unneccessary labour. Some people get shitty at them for this, I always consider these minor forms of fraud as a stupidity/ignorance tax. Don't get shitty about them, just avoid them and learn from them. Also, drink chai. If you plan on going into India, buy the bike in India. Indian bikes can ride on Nepal's roads no problem, but you'll be paying baksheesh to every cop in India if you're wearing Nepalese plates. Remember, you'll never be able to legitimately own the bike, but if you're carrying the papers and smile sweetly at the cops, they won't demand too much. Keep your money in separate pockets. If you've agreed upon a 'fine' (=bribe) of 100Rs (yes, even 'fines' are negotiable), then only produce 100Rs. If you thumb through a wad of 500's, they'll suddenly find another reason to fine you. But generally, the Nepalese police (at least while I was there) stayed well away from tourists, so you should be fine on that front (that's more of an Indian tip). The roads around Pokhara are BEAUTIFUL. As is riding from the plains in the south up into the mountains. For an adventure, I rode from Pokhara in Nepal into India and across the Leh-Ladakh highway. Awesome. Except, of course, for all the vomiting and shitting and falling asleep while riding one time. Film it. Upload it. I miss that countryside so, so much. And the Nepali people. So lovely. Learn a few words and they'll ask you to marry their daughters.   7048: Kathmandu is a shithole. Unless necessary, probably best to avoid it. Particularly after the earthquake.  And most of all: I'm sure you learned this is Vietnam:  Fuck your itinerary. Screw your schedule into a ball and smoke it in a chillum. If you don't, you'll end up screaming at people and having white-person-tantrums and your whole experience will be a sea of frustration with a few islands of 'Oh, look at that'. This is the BIGGEST mistake of foreigners in that patch of the world. If you've broken down and the mechanic said '5 minutes' and it's been an hour, chill. Hurry him along sure, but make friends with him, and be nice about it.  Go to the Bullet mechanic in Pokhara. Say Hi to Raju.  Edit: This: If you can, avoid riding at night. Trucks and things will drive with high beams on and flash and beep at you. With a crappy headlight, it becomes REALLY difficult to see. You'll pull to the edge of the road to miss them, and be jangling along in potholes made invisible by the dazzling brightness and ruined night-vision. It's just dangerous. Guest houses are plenty, so hole up in one for the night once it's gone too dark.  Edit #2: Took out the video"

We routinely leave the keys in our quads overnight.    If you happen to be near any of the big dune parks (like Florence/Winchester Bay/ Coos Bay area) there are campgrounds made for off road vehicle riders that are at or near beach and as safe as anything I've been to.  In general I stay at national or state park campgrounds if camping just because they tend to be less dense than the private sites.    Bring something to put your sidestand on if camping in dirt, I woke to a friend's bike falling onto mine at about 3am one night in pouring rain on the WA coast.  I often use an old flip-flop with a rope tied to it as a stand pad.  As for hotels, roll it inside a ground floor room if possible as mentioned above but any decent lock should be fine.  Bring gear into your room though, I was passing thru Wisconsin while Sturgis was going on about 10 years ago and someone came through and cut all the helmets off the bikes outside.

motorcyclesroadtrip,37cmf3,Emocmo,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:21:47 2015 UTC,"I just made that trip (more zigzagging than straight) in the opposite direction.  I don't advise camping unless you just really loooooove camping.  How much fun you can have in a day is limited by how long it takes for fatigue and aches and pains to set in.  First, you start getting a little fatigued and things get less fun.  Then, you start realizing your fatigue is to the point where it's affecting safety, and things get very, very un-fun.  A good night's sleep and an early start mean you have a lot more fun per day.  Take stretch breaks early and frequently, as it is much harder to get rid of aches and soreness once it starts than it is to prevent it.  As for theft prevention, a chain or disc lock is probably enough.  Park away from view of the main road, if you can, to limit the amount of opportunists in trucks that see your bike.  Most thieves who are going to bother breaking through a disc lock are planners, rather than merely opportunistic.  They show up in motorcycle gear with a replacement ECU, break your steering lock, hotwire the bike, and ride away.  They're not going to be able to set that up in one night.  They stalk your work or home or some other place they see their target bike parked frequently.  Edit:  One more thing... don't let yourself get low on fuel late at night in Oregon.

On a couple of those years, race weekend overlapped with Sturgis. The sheer number of bikes on trailers going the opposite way on I-90 always made us laugh. A couple years ago I was working with a consultant from Florida who mentioned he and his wife loved to ride - HD of course. He mentioned that they go to Sturgis almost every year, which I thought was cool, considering the distance. Just looking at him, I kind of doubted they rode, but hey, even trailering a couple bikes that distance year after year shows a certain amount of enthusiasm for the sport. Turns out they didn't do that either.

motorcyclesroadtrip,36r3fg,iftherewasanotherway,3,Thu May 21 19:12:37 2015 UTC,"I am happy to be corrected as I am not from that area but the Gold Coast is just a small stretch of coast in Southern Queensland,  but as I said I am not from there so maybe there's a ride I don't know about.   I do however know about the Grand Pacific Highway, http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2014/08/11/1227020/442561-55027c98-20f6-11e4-9066-0beb7f687196.jpg and it is a stunning looking bit of road that would be well worth checking out.   Another one I went on a couple of years back was a stretch from Jindabyne near the Snowy Mountains in NSW back to Melbourne called Alpine Way or the B400 http://pete-n-pam.com/main%20pics/page104pics/alpine%20way.jpg and it is a beautiful bit of road that goes from up in the high country back down through country Victoria to Melbourne, honestly one of the best roads out there and a much better way to see Australia than being stuck on the highways. Just look out for all the wombats, they are a bad way to crash.  Other than that I live on the Great Ocean Road and it's absolutely stunning, but way too busy in summer/autumn.   What everyone has said about the weather is dead right, it's not unusual to have a week of +40 degree celcius days in February, in fact everyone was confused this year when it was a bit cooler.

motorcyclesroadtrip,36r3fg,LazyAdventurer,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:27:17 2015 UTC,So I'm going to assume that you live in the northern hemisphere so your winter will be our summer. I will also say that my touring experience is limited to within a 1000km radius of where I live in the south west corner of Australia.  The main thing about touring in our summer is the heat. It sucks to wear all your protective gear when the temp is in the high 30s. My advice is to stay south of Perth in the west & Sydney in the east. I know that here in the west a lot of people holiday on the coast in the summer. This might make it difficult to find accommodation as you go because some towns get booked out.   On the east coast of Aus there is the Great Ocean Rd which leaves Melbourne & hugs the coast travelling west. There is also some nice touring to do in Tasmania. I'm sure there is heaps of other awesome rides but it's not my area of expertise.  Here in the west I love touring through the southern forests. Lots of sweeping bends to keep things  interesting and every 50kms or so there is a quaint little town with something to see. It's also nice to travel along the coast and enjoy our awesome beaches.  Hope that helps. Happy to answer any specific questions you have.
motorcyclesroadtrip,36r3fg,allyboi101,1 point,Thu May 21 14:28:23 2015 UTC,Yep Northern Hemisphere we are! Actually east coast USA so the big hurdle is getting them to take that flight. I told them to take 8 weeks and leave a few days on either side to layover in CA and HI (my Dad has a bad back so 14 hours in those uncomfortable seats just isn't going to happen). I know they are very interested in the ride along the Golden Coast I think it's called from Melbourne to Sydney. How would that be in the summer time. I told them to go to NZ first in like January/beginning of Feb and then Aus in Feb/March as it will be ebbing towards fall then. I don't know if they'd make it towards the west but definitely want to do that ride on the east like I mentioned. I will mention Tasmania to them too! Thanks so much for the info and if they do go west I'll get back in touch and see if you have any more recommendations! :)

I don't really have any advice other than don't be sad when other riders don't wave back at you when you go by! We think it's because you're on the other side of the road, so you have to use your throttle hand to wave, so people just don't bother. :(  Edit: Also, Kangaroos are fucking terrifying. They were dead ALL OVER the road, at least one every couple of km in areas. They are dumb and will run in front of your bike and will fuck your shit up. We spent our time riding only ever during the day, avoiding riding at twilight/in the evening, and trying to stay tucked behind large trucks that would hit them first and knock them out of the way if they decided to go kamikaze.

motorcyclesroadtrip,36iswz,rlz_,3,Tue May 19 18:23:40 2015 UTC,"Absolutely you can.  However, please be realistic about how much ground you can cover.  The continental US is enormous.  A lot of Europeans come to the US having planned trips that are much too ambitious, such as riding from coast to coast in a week.  You could / should focus on some area of the US.  For example the southwest plus California.  California has many different climates, so you will absolutely see a lot.  Plan carefully so that you know how much ""fun"" riding you are doing, vs. how much riding you are doing simply to get to your next hotel.  Edit: Please feel free to post about what specifically you want to do while you're in the US.  For example, do you want to see big cities, such as the San Francisco area?  Or do you mainly want to focus on the countryside -- forests, deserts, plains, etc.?  We can give you some help on picking which area of the country.  The most important factors are the length of your stay and your budget.  You should probably plan on buying a bike while you're here, then selling it before you leave.  Buying (and selling) in a medium-to-large city is probably best, since there will be a large and active market in the larger cities.  You might try posting more specific questions in /r/motorcycles.  That is a much more active sub, and plenty of people will be glad to help you.  And if you come to the Pacific northwest (Washington, Oregon), then post in /r/pnwriders.  It's a much smaller sub devoted to (you guessed it) the Pacific northwest.  Lots of people post there about coordinating rides.  And if you come all the way to Seattle (Washington), PM me.  I'll be glad to, at the very least, spill a few beers with you and take you on a few good local routes."
motorcyclesroadtrip,36iswz,0xdeadf001,2,Tue May 19 20:13:17 2015 UTC,"Focus on an area in the States, or give yourself a LOT of time if you want to go coast-to-coast. Decide what kind of riding you want to be doing. Do you want to travel from point A to point B so that you can see/do things at those destinations, or do you want to focus on exciting riding? Deciding between these is paramount. For example, if you want to see/do things at destinations, the East Coast would be really good, given its's far denser overall population and longer history. Boston to NYC would yield a lot things to do at your stop points, but the roads between are going to be pretty flat and boring, unless you meticulously find routes off the beaten path.  Probably the most iconic ride in America is the West Coast, but don't let that discourage you from seeing other parts of the States. There are some amazing hidden jewels in the East.  Lane Splitting is illegal everywhere except California. Many riders do it anyway, but be aware of the risks."
motorcyclesroadtrip,36iswz,Th3JourneyMan,1 point,Tue May 19 20:48:53 2015 UTC,"Felow dane here, yes it is very possible. And ok easy to register a bike in your name at the DMW(at least in AZ). I would suggest, if you want to buy, have a look advriders.com they have a good flea market with used bikes. Or maybe craigslist- You can get an international licens made at your local ""borger service"" for 20-30 DKK but because you are only 20 you have to look into the rules of horse power if they apply you in the US aswell."

I asked him to let me ride his bike and he agreed, unfortunately it had rained just minutes earlier, I also did not take into account the extra weight of his saddlebags and stuff, the front tire slipped while taking a left turn and we took a spill. It didn't seem serious at the time and we weren't even going that fast. We got ourselves up and we just had a couple of scrapes but then he (Marco) felt something wasn't right with his shoulder so we went to see a doctor and indeed, he had a broken collarbone. Obviously he had to be on his way so for the last six months or so after leaving Guatemala, he rode through Mexico, the US Pacific Coast and Canada all the way to Alaska. I feel at least partially responsible for his current health issues so I'm trying to do whatever i can to help him out.

I worked in Newport News.  60 is Warwick Blvd. then it hits every shady ghetto area on the peninsula..      on second thought,  DO IT!!     Seriously, you'll come down the peninsula, head right thru downtown colonial hell..err.. Williamsburg..  Busch Gardens, etc. then Newport News, you'll see where all those trains unload their coal at.  You'll see Hilton, the most awesome little area of Newport News. (my sister's business is there).  Then.. head thru the ghetto of hampton, onto the 64 bridge/tunnel.   and that tunnel.. oh yeah, i loved riding thru them.  but only at night, when it was EMPTY.  the wind on the bridge SUCKS.  Big Time! Seriously.  I felt like a kite when I had my gear packed on my CBR.  Then, if you're actually following 60, it goes thru Oceanview (where u can't really see the ocean)..  and you'll come down to VA Beach from the north part of ""the boardwalk"" which is all cement.   Stop around 25th street, where all the statues are, and just walk straight into the ocean.  I'm imagining that's your final destination ""i've arrived"" moment, is just parking, kicking off gear/shoes, and getting feet in the water.  If not, I would highly recommend Yorktown beach, on 17, and the Pub, right by the water.  Stay at the Duke of York hotel.

And you are NOT aero-dynamic.  most of the time some idiot runs out of gas. but every now n then it's a serious bike-related mess up.  Suggested..  Uhm.    depends on time..  If you're just riding thru the peninsula...  cut from williamsburg to yorktown on the colonial parkway.  this is 3-slabs of colonial uhm.. sidewalk? pavement..  idk what to call it, but it's the BEST ride in that area of the country.  Follow 64 thru the rest of it.. cuz.. you'll see the coal piles.  But, I remember being July.. and me near those, and ABSOLUTELY COOKING my head in my full-face helmet.    Cuz.. VA is not cool like PA.. with the helmet law. stupid commonwealth   (cuz, pa is a commonwealth too, but.. a cool one..)

Just phenomenal.  If you're from around Duluth you know the lake can be cold. I rode past in mid-June and on the way out there anyways it was fucking chilly, so make sure you're dressed appropriately depending on when you go.  As for fun rides I didn't veer much from the Trans-Canada except for a 560km detour on the way back when there was a bridge out in Nipigon for a couple days. The first few hundred km's were excruciatingly lame, but after that coming down through Hornpayne towards White River it was absolutely gorgeous. This here is what I'm talking about. I wouldn't suggest going north of Hornpayne as once you hit highway 11 it's boring and you're far off route. Also Hornpayne is super tiny. The only gas station for like a couple hundred km's.  So with that said, just remember to be fuelling up whenever you see it. Sometimes you won't be able to get premium if that's what you use, but you'll have to fill up anyways.  As for stops, you could spend the night in the Sleeping Giant Provincial Park outside Thunder Bay. There's also the Terry Fox memorial in Thunder Bay. Just remember between Thunder Bay and Sault Ste. Marie the next biggest stop is Wawa, and beyond that there's really nothing but gas stations, campgrounds, and small restaurants.   As for lodging there's a lot of nice lake-side campgrounds and parks coming up before Sault Ste. Marie, which is really the nicest stretch of the entire ride, on the Ontario side anyways."

However, you can't take your bike to the island, as motor vehicles are not allowed, and you'll have to take a ferry to/from the island."
motorcyclesroadtrip,362lnz,adein,1 point,Sun May 17 01:40:16 2015 UTC,"Yes to all of these.  Brockway / Copper Harbor is also a little out of the way (no choice but to go out & back) but very scenic.  If you're into boats (i.e. lakers) at all, stopping by the Soo locks is a must.  The museum ship (Valley Camp) at the Soo (US side) was worth the time when I was there (admittedly 10+ years ago).  And yes, it can be chilly.  And buggy depending on just when you're going.  Enjoy the ride!"

There is a great number of ToDo/ToSee places on the map. I would recomend to spend the first night in Grand Marais, instead of Thunder bay (what the superior tour site recomends) Thunder bay is kind of a meh place, so just ride right through it. GFT in Grand marais has good beer and is walking distance from a camp site. The food there is tasty but pricy. Skip The Blue Water Cafe for breakfast, overpriced and not particularly good food. Instead go to South of the boarder Cafe. Much more reasonable prices and a more interesting menu, but its a cash only place.  Stop at Grand Portage and see the National Monument, visit the camp, and watch the video at the monument. You will learn some interesting history of the area.  That should be enough to get you started, the rest you will figure out along the way. Have fun."

motorcyclesroadtrip,362zf5,Captain_Hammertoe,2,Fri May 15 17:42:01 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're not going that far so some of these may not apply, but here are my thoughts based on my solo trips.    When you plan your route, think about number of hours, not number of miles.  A 300mile 12 hour day is much harder than a 500mile 10 hour day Only book hotels/campsites in advance if there's a danger you won't be able to get a room.  Some days, you get where you think you're going to stop but you feel good and decide you'd rather push on another 200 miles and see one extra thing.  Sometimes you're 100 miles short but you're dog tired and pushing on would be dangerous.  Don't let a hotel reservation, or some pre-planned camping spot be the reason you miss something cool, or push on beyond your limits.  Always fill up with gas before stopping for the night, there's nothing better than getting on the bike in the morning with a full tank of gas.  I like to jump on the bike and ride an hour or two then stop for breakfast. Pack the rain gear on top!!!!, you don't want to have to unload half the bike in the rain to get your gear on, it sucks.  Also, better to put the rain gear on earlier rather than later, if you let yourself get wet and cold because you think it will 'blow over soon', it can be hard to get dry and warm for the rest of the day  Think about hydration, either a hydration bladder, or just how you're going to strap a water bottle to the bike. You don't want to unpack the bike to take a sip of water.  Also stop often and take a sip, it's easy to dehydrate when riding. Pack the tool kit from the bike, maybe a leatherman and for sure a credit card.  There's nothing you can't fix with one of those three, everything else is just dead weight.  You can't predict what will happen to the bike, the chances of you packing the right tool for the repair and being able to execute it on the side of a road is slim to none.  If you have roadside assistance make sure you have all the details with you.  I don't carry a tire repair kit but I know people who do. I don't know anyone that's ever successfully used one on the side of the road, but I'm sure plenty of people have. YMMV Phones and GPS are great, but have a good map and a compass to orient yourself as a backup. Ask every biker, truck driver or anyone you meet coming in the other direction what they've seen on the road.  Cops, roadworks, debris in the road, weather ahead, I've gotten quite a few good tips over the years. Emergency contacts, I personally wear a RoadID on my wrist. It's $20 and engraved with a couple of emergency contact numbers.  Make sure the people on the other end have all your medical details, insurance details etc.  A sharpie would also work just fine. I don't have locking bags, so I keep all my valuables (camera, wallet, phone, ipad) in my tank bag and just grab it every time I get off the bike.  Nothing worse then going through 5 different pockets to collect everything just so you can take a leak or buy a coke. Know how many miles you can get from your main and reserve tank.  Use a trip meter so you always have a rough idea of the your remaining range taking into account terrain, speed etc.  It's really handy when you see XXX Town 53 miles and YYY Town 102 miles, to know if you're going to make it to YYYY or if you need to get gas in XXX Pack spare bungee cords.  For some reason, no matter how much I think I've got it down to a science, I always seem to pack the bike very slightly differently and sometimes you need to throw one more bungee on than you did the day before.  They take up almost no space and being 1 bungee short can waste 20 minutes of packing and repacking.   Last but not least, DON'T OVER THINK IT.  I remember how over prepared I was for my first multi-night multi-state trip.  Honestly it's just not that hard."

motorcyclesroadtrip,362zf5,Earth2Andy,2,Fri May 29 18:25:14 2015 UTC,"One more I remembered is to pack a really simple ball siphon.  I've never used mine, but if for some reason you run out of gas (and you wouldn't be the first) it's much easier to flag someone down and offer them a few dollars to siphon half a gallon of gar out their car, than to try to get a ride to gas station, buy a container, get a ride back to the bike."

Emergency cell service can be accessed even in areas with no service by dialing 112.  This can even be dialed if a phone is locked.  Hidden battery power (if you phone is about to die and you need to make an emergency call) press *3370# and the phone will restart using reserve power.  This power will be recharged next time you charge your phone.  Tools - Bring a leatherman (or any cheaper style brand) as a multi tool to add to your bike ""underseat kit.""  Someone else on another post said ""Write your home phone number on your body with a sharpie"" and ""Carry your medical history or some sort of medical documentation with you.""  Enjoy your trip!"
motorcyclesroadtrip,362zf5,jacky4566,2,Fri May 15 18:13:47 2015 UTC,Writing down numbers is a great idea. Especially for people like me who forget everything.   Sorry bro *3370# is a hoax and does nothing. This was a Nokia short code to change the voice quality for longer talk time.   Make sure you bikes toolkit has all of its tools and you didn't just take some out for other purposes.   Plan our your fuel stops. Bikes can have less range than cars so make sure you know where you are stopping.   Have Fun!

motorcyclesroadtrip,35x3ev,teh_fizz,6,Thu May 14 06:56:16 2015 UTC,"Of course.   To plan the trip the most difficult was to actually obtain the bike since a foreigner cannot legally own a bike in India. What I did was find a local company of a friend who could buy the bike on my behalf and then ""lend"" it to me for the duration of my trip. I of course paid for everything (bike was about $2'500).  Otherwise for the rest of the planning we knew we wanted to start in Delhi (where we landed) so we tried to trace an itinerary we thought made sense by listing all the destinations we wanted to visit and see if they were on our way to the south of the country. A couple of days into the road trip we had to actually completely change the itinerary because we noticed it'd be pretty much impossible to do much more than 250km a day (road conditions in India means you're driving at 40km an hour average). Our original itinerary called for days with as much as 600k or 700k so we had to revise it a lot and remove a lot of destinations.  Budget. We didn't limit ourselves. During our 3 months in India we spent $7'500 (+ $2'500 for the bike) and during our 2 months in Nepal about $3'000. This is relatively expensive for the region but we mostly stayed in nice hotels, eat in nice restaurants, etc. In the region you can easily get by during a road trip spending $20-$30 a day."

motorcyclesroadtrip,35x3ev,Scroon,1 point,Thu May 14 07:48:12 2015 UTC,"How does licensing work? Or do they not care in India? Curious about the paperwork, permits, and such."
motorcyclesroadtrip,35x3ev,Scroon,1 point,Thu May 14 20:49:21 2015 UTC,"As a foreigner you theoretically need an international driving license to be allowed to drive in India. The thing is that policemen in non-touristic areas typically don't know that so you can get by with your home country license. If you're in Goa or other touristic spots however it's more dangerous.  As for the bike's papers, your license plate number as well as your bike's other numbers (engine serial numbers, etc.) are registered to your name in the government and they issue an ownership card to you. When you buy a bike from someone you need to go through the complicated and expensive ordeal of changing the ownership with the government and getting a new card issued. But like I said earlier you cannot buy a bike and get it registered to you as a foreigner so you need a local company or individual to do that for you and then make a contract with you.  When you're stopped by the police they'll want to see your driving license, the bike ownership card and, if not in your name, the contract with the owner of the card."

Just watch your speed the rcmp don't have much to do but drive between the ends of this road, so when the corners spread out resist the temptation to open up or you'll spend you lunch reading a speeding ticket like I did..."
motorcyclesroadtrip,35qhrp,Duedain,2,Wed May 13 01:52:44 2015 UTC,If you take this route (#28 west) there is a camp site in Gold River right on the banks which is a sweet spot to camp. Assuming you will start in or around Victoria there are lots of routes for you to take.  I highly suggest checking out the Gulf Islands and pretty much every island has a camp site.  Salt Spring Island and Pender Island are both fun to explore and are accessed through BC Ferries from Swartz Bay terminal just North of Victoria.  Up Island a bit there is Gabriola Island accessed through a direct ferry from Nanaimo. Koksilah camp ground just south of Duncan is a good spot but only takes an hour or so to reach from Victoria so it may be a good spot on your return trip. Definitely check out the highway 4 and drive in to Macmillan provincial park as its a gorgeous big tree park tourist attraction.  A little further on that road is Cameron Lake which has camping (i believe) and Sproat Lake further along which is a really warm area for camping.  If you continue on this route you can go all the way to the Pacific where there is Tofino or Ucluelet which both offer camping options and a bevy of nature. On the main highway another spot to check out is Parksville/Qualicum Beach which are basically oceanfront highway towns that were on the old Island highway before it was re-done. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions on specific spots as I am a Victoria local and know the island fairly well.  I have only ever been as far North as Woss so past that point I am of no help! I definitely need a bigger bike to do these kinds of trips as my Suzuki DRZ-SM 400 is a little rough on the body for long haul trips. Dued

Also 125 would take you a long time. I did the country on a 500 without a problem but a lot of folks told me that that was even too small.

Sorry I can't help much with Europe. But by this time next year I should have my 500 back from my kid brother and that is my spare bike so I'd be willing to host someone (maybe from Germany so I could work on my German!)

Like the title says, this is year 7, and this year we'll reach $1 million raised for Children's Miracle Network.  Check out the page. Watch livestream via uStream as they roll down the road (subject to cell coverage for the data feed). Track their progress with live updates from their SPOT GPS system. Read their blog entries from the road.  And, of course, donate.  If i crossed a line iwth the plea for donors, I apoloize - all money goes directly to CMN - the riders each raise/donate $2500, plus pay their own expenses for the whole trip. Runs pretty close to $5k or so, what with gas, tolls, hotels, food, and because most ride Harleys, maintenance."

Also - you won't need this on a Z1000 - but for bikes with exposed spark plugs, it's a good idea to carry an extra plug or two. A ""druggy"" snapped off one of mine once, and I was stranded."

motorcyclesroadtrip,352zpv,LittleHelperRobot,3,Thu May 7 04:03:59 2015 UTC,"Looks good! I can't disagree with what's already been suggested. What I will say is that imo there's very little in the way of interesting landscape or driving basically between Denver and the Appalachian Mountains. If you've got time to go west of Denver and explore the Rockies, great! That's some of the best there is. If you don't, I'd say you might not bother going that far west, Maybe drive to Memphis or St. Louis or whatever city in that region that looks fun and take your time going through the mountains on the way back.  Another option which might be worth researching at least, is the Vermont/New Hampshire/Quebec/Maine area. There are a lot of fabulous roads and scenery up there. Montreal is a fantastic city as well. And the Maine Coastline is always fun."
motorcyclesroadtrip,352zpv,Aiels,2,Thu May 7 02:24:39 2015 UTC,"On your way out with the truck I would probably just take 70 and drive through Ohio and Indiana.    On the way back with the bike I would swing south at St. Louis and hit Nashville then Knoxville.  Then cut south again and head to the Cherokee reservation in North Carolina and get on the Blue Ridge Parkway.   That will then take you up to Afton, VA (near Charlottesville).  From there it becomes Skyline Drive.  And Skyline takes you up to 66.  Right near Front Royal.  45 minutes from DC.   I just had a buddy ride it down from DC to Asheville and he loved it.   It is pretty much the closest thing to a National Park that a highway can be.   And those two roads I mentioned will take 2-3 days at a comfortable pace.  You could probably do it in 1 day if you were pycho, but you wouldn't enjoy it."

motorcyclesroadtrip,34jit1,mightdoabiketrip,3,Fri May 1 18:09:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the most comfortable bike is the one you are the most comfortable riding. I took my GT1000 to Alaska, it's not exactly a tourer in any sense.    The adventure-series bikes are sold for this kind of thing because they tend to be better set up for longer rides on highways, have comfort for rider and passenger, adjustable high-travel suspension and lots of luggage options. They're a jack-of-all-trades if anything.   Between a sports tourer and an adventure bike, you're likely going to see the biggest difference in suspension. If you're going to be going on roads with irregular surfaces or yes, put on other tires and go unpaved areas, they'll fare much better."
motorcyclesroadtrip,34jit1,caliform,1 point,Fri May 1 18:29:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I wonder how the VFR will feel over a long trip. Really I need the dealer to let me out on it for a lot longer than 15 minutes, maybe I'll ask them if I can borrow it for an hour or so before I make a concrete decision.  There is actually a VFR 1200 adventure bike version (Crosstourer) which looks great, but the cheapest of those I can see on eBay is £2000 more than the road version I'm currently looking at.  Hard to say with the roads, but the countries I'm aiming for should in theory not have too poor surfaces."

motorcyclesroadtrip,34jit1,shartshooter,3,Sun May 3 04:34:32 2015 UTC,"I rode from London to Cape Town on an Africa Twin xrv750. Choose the smallest engine you can tolerate. Use a sheepskin over your saddle. Use decent road tyres and don't bother with cross tyres. Make sure you can change an inner tube very quickly(let the puncture repair dry and use a 2nd tube). Pack light, my brother and I finished the trip with three sets of clothes each- sleeping, riding and eating."
motorcyclesroadtrip,34jit1,SampsonRustic,2,Sat May 2 05:56:39 2015 UTC,"Transitioning to an ADV bike will take about 2 weeks in my experience. The bars will feel high, wide, and the front end feels much looser. After some time however, you will feel much more comfortable and will learn how to position yourself for control. Sitting high up also gives you way better views of what's around you, even if you dont think so yet. It's always weird for me to go back and forth between sporties and dirt / adv bikes, but it's just about riding with a different style. Adventure bikes also just have less shiny parts that are prone to breaking or are expensive to replace, and they also typically have much larger fuel tanks for greater distance."
motorcyclesroadtrip,34jit1,RiPont,1 point,Fri May 1 21:01:36 2015 UTC,"Argh, it's very difficult to make a decision when the best you can do is have a short test ride. You make a good point about being able to see the view. The VFR isn't too hunched over, but the Tiger I tried did let you see straight ahead without bending your neck much.  Fuel is a big concern. I don't particularly mind stopping more often for fuel, just as long as I don't get stuck somewhere because I couldn't find a place."
motorcyclesroadtrip,34jit1,smithster66,2,Fri May 1 22:17:27 2015 UTC,Comfort is pretty darn important for a long trip.  Fatigue sets in and leads to accidents.  ...but comfort is whatever bike is most comfortable for you.  An ST may be comfortable and an ADV may be uncomfortable.
motorcyclesroadtrip,34jit1,TheTucsonTarmac,1 point,Fri May 1 22:08:42 2015 UTC,"The ADV bikes are called that because they are the best for the long distance adventure. They can handle just about anything thrown at them and your can ride them from longer periods.  A BMW 1150 can be pretty reasonably  priced and can be customized any way you like.  You can run them an crap gas, jump logs, rock and curbs. They will handle as well as most sport bikes on the pavement. Hold tons of gear also."

I got the G650GS because I wanted to some adventure riding.  To me, that means dirt roads, bad roads, jeep trails, and even some single track.  While I probably could have put some more aggressive tires and a skid plate on the roadster, I decided that I wanted something a bit lighter, and with more ground clearance.    I would not consider any of the bikes you named to be capable of going where I'm planning without talking significant modifications."

Not sure what kind of riding you are going to be doing but there are two roads in Lewiston that are mo'fun  Just to the north of Lewiston is the Old Spiral Highway. About 20 miles of super twisty goodness.   Just south of Lewiston is the Hells Gate Canyon, and that road is also supposed to be awesome. I have not ridden it yet, so cannot talk from experience   In between Lewiston and Missoula is the Jerry Johnson Hot Springs"
motorcyclesroadtrip,34ed1v,KentuckyGuy,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:49:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I am aware of the Spiral Highway from a trip 3 years ago through there. We were not able to make it, but I plan to this year. We have some new blood with us this year and they wanted to see more of Hells Canyon, so I will take a look at that road and make sure we get some time on it.  ETA: That video reminds me a lot of the Old Priest Grade near Yosemite valley in CA. I had to get towed out of the valley after picking up a handful(!!!) of nails in my rear tire on the way from San Francisco. Coming back down in a tow truck, with a very green tow truck driver (6 weeks on the job) led to a very long boring ride back out."

motorcyclesroadtrip,34caa7,merker8,2,Thu Apr 30 00:21:09 2015 UTC,"Up to Lassen and check that out if you haven't before, then cut across to Redding and ride the 36 west to the coast.  If you like coastal riding then just take that (the 101) all the way up to Seattle more or less.  But right above the 36 is the 299 which is quite nice as well.  The 3 (right in that vicinity as well) is also outstanding.  But if you take the 3 all the way North you will hit i 5 which would suck.  The 299 route would also put you back on the 299, hence why I would probably recommend the 36 west and taking the coast up, unless you really don't care for the coast."
motorcyclesroadtrip,34caa7,chaoscarrot,2,Thu Apr 30 05:43:28 2015 UTC,"Since you're hitting Tahoe I have to second reco'ing rte. 89 through Lassen.  Spectacular.  Beware though, it can get cold up there, even in the summer.  One of my all time favorite pics was on 89 not too far north of Tahoe.     Also, CA-36 is fucking awesome. Stop at the burger shack in Mad River for a superb burger and milkshake.     101 through much of Oregon is boring and slow but there is some scenery  that should not be missed.     Have you considered swinging by Crater Lake?    I always go back and forth, east and west whenever I'm around there because there are just too many fabulous roads.  I also love  CA-96.   At Happy Camp you could take the road less traveled - can't recall the name offhand but it's very nice.  Also off 96 (and hooking up with 3 to the east) if you like _back_roads Cecilville Road is a blast!    Farther north, FS-25 and FS-99 to Windy Ridge is awesome. North to Randle then take WA- ... 7? 9? whatever, it's a very nice road, smooth and wide but not too wide. Gets you close to Seattle."
motorcyclesroadtrip,34caa7,YourFairyGodmother,2,Thu Apr 30 16:29:28 2015 UTC,"Nevada's pretty vast and empty.  If possible, I'd aim for Utah heading out of Vegas.  It's scenic and has wonderful, twisty roads. Vegas to St George sucks, but it can be incredible from there. 9 to 89 to 12.  Really cool scenery on the 12.  Then whatever twisty roads.  Another favorite that is in the wrong direction, but work looking up, is the Moki Dugway, 261. And up near Tahoe/Reno, hit up Virginia City.   Since we don't deal with them in LA, beware of tar snakes when it's hot out."

It was recent enough that you could still feel the heat radiating from either side of the road at times.  http://magictravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/burned-out-between-Mae-Chaem-and-Khun-Yuam.jpg  http://magictravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/more-fire-damage-between-Mae-Chaem-and-Khun-Yuam.jpg  If you are particularly interested I wrote a bunch of blog posts, took a bunch more photos and made some really cringy videos. http://magictravelblog.com/series/mae-hong-son-loop/"

The new sealed section between Tarago and Bungonia was sunsentional in the Autumn afternoon sun, although a bit brisk, but the real treat was the 5 kilometres of twisty road up from Nerriga pub and up the mountain. We stopped for a few laps and pictures, then headed back for beer and a late lunch before the trip home."

motorcyclesroadtrip,344m8w,ImLoveable,0,Tue Apr 28 06:53:54 2015 UTC,Good choice for a final destination.  I hope you arrived by riding over the bridge and left by riding down the strand.
motorcyclesroadtrip,33xy3i,Legitasbules,17,Sun Apr 26 18:29:18 2015 UTC,"The most I've ever done in a day was Beatty NV to Jackson WY, about 800 miles. It sucked. I had no choice because the areas are so desolate compared to the east and there were few hotels on my route and no vacancies. I try to keep it at a maximum of 350 miles a day. That will still be about 6 hours of driving. You miss a lot of scenery if you drive after dark. Especially out west. Here are some tips to get you started.    If you are good at scheduling your travels then always make reservations at a hotel. Vacancies can be rare particularly around the holidays. Get a good rain suit and waterproof boots and gloves A balaklava will keep the cold off your neck and is indispensable if you get caught out down in the 40s. Consider installing a Powerlet or two. You'll be glad you did.  I have hand guards installed and they make a huge difference keeping your hands warm.  Find a place on your bike to hide some emergency money. If you've got soft luggage make sure you've got rain covers I HIGHLY recommend an E55 Givi trunk or something similar. Expensive but well worth it. Take a road atlas with you. I've had GPS failures twice. No fun without a map. Keep a diary of your travels. I never did and I wish I had. Don't even think about going far without a tire repair kit. I also carry a Bell tire pump. The first time you need these you be glad you have them and not stuck 20 miles from Colorado Springs in the dark like I was. The pump isn't small, but it's worth the trouble. Buy the most expensive Leatherman tool you can afford. Duct Tape, toilet paper, matches, water and first aid kit. Most importantly, have fun and BE CAREFUL."
motorcyclesroadtrip,33xy3i,keylogthis,4,Sun Apr 26 21:04:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for this, I can't wait to get going! Hopefully I'll have some photos of my own up here soon!"
motorcyclesroadtrip,33xy3i,keylogthis,3,Sun Apr 26 23:49:12 2015 UTC,"Don't take 350 miles a day as rule. You might not be able to do that or you might find yourself easily surpassing that, every rider has different comfort zones. I tend to do about 500 miles on an easy day, but I know people that are done after about 200, it just varies. I've done two Iron Butts, 1,000 miles < 24 hours, and I was down for the next day and a half after both, they are killer.  A big part of being comfortable is gear. But we can't fit a lot on a bike, I'll mostly go point by point with the last guy. And give you my suggestions.   If you have more money than me, you will be spending time in hotels. I mostly camp... but occasionally spend a night or two in hotels. This is the best tent I've had for this. It doesn't take up much room on the bike... my bedroll is bigger. And it takes < 4 min to setup, which is great after a longer ride. Two sticks and it pops right up. You'll need a tarp to put under it. And you will want to seal it with tent sealer before leaving.  You would also want a good sleeping bag, rated for the weather you will be in and a good bed roll to sleep on. You will want other camp gear, like this and this and this and this. A hammock isn't necessary, but it's nice for extended stays or even for quickly sleeping in warm weather areas... this one folds into the size about the size of softball. And look into camp recipes. Something else you might want to look into is couchsurfing.com. I've used it a couple times. It is pretty nice. There are other networks like couchsurfing. advrider.com has a thread where members have posted to allow for camping/overnight stays. And I've heard of other sites like couchsurfing, but couchsurfing is the only one I have used and can vouch for. Yes, you will want a rain suit, at least pants if you already have a leather jacket that is water proof... personally I only ran a leather jacket and pushed through while wet, but it sucks. You can do that when riding long distance in warmer areas, because you will dry off once you get through the rain, but I've done it coming out of Yellowstone when it was 35 degrees and it is really cold and miserable for the rest of the ride, not enjoyable in the least. Instead of a balaklava which can make your helmet uncomfortable get a neck warmer. I have not had a need for a powerlet, but it might be a good idea if you need it. Yes, you will for sure want wind protection. Definitely a windshield, and probably hand guards as well... the wind will fatigue you while riding faster than anything else. You probably don't notice it while riding short distances, but when riding long distance, constantly being pushed a little here and there and making adjustments to your body from the wind is going to significantly shorten your ride. Rain covers are probably a good idea, haven't needed them myself. I just roll with the rain. If you are camping and got a tarp like I suggested, you could just use that. You'll for sure want a road atlas. And I would recommend not using a GPS, that sounds horrible to me. Do keep a journal of your trip. Yes, have a tire repair kit, but instead of bringing a tire pump like that, get one like this. It takes up much less room, and is less work to use it. Leatherman tool, nah, just have the right tools in your toolkit. Most bike's stock kit contains everything needed to work on your bike. And I'll add... if you don't have a throttle lock or highway pegs, get them.   And above all, if you really want to be prepared, read this book."
motorcyclesroadtrip,33xy3i,keylogthis,2,Mon Apr 27 12:47:16 2015 UTC,"I recommended the balaklava because it doesn't let the cold air through and I think the neck warmer you linked to might. When it gets below 45 or so cold air at highway speeds is a problem the balaklava solves. They can be uncomfortable, but the head fabric on mine is very thin and you can't even feel it at all with your helmet on.     The electric tire pump is actually nice. That's the first model I've seen that doesn't take forever to fill a tire.     My suggestion about rain covers was for the soft luggage. Many don't keep out rain well at all at highway speeds without the covers.     Highway pegs. Definitely. Forgot about that one. The throttle lock is something I would never install on my bike.     Leatherman tool. Yep. Better safe then sorry. Having an extra tool that takes up very little room and has multiple uses can definitely come in handy.     GPS horrible? Really? Knowing where the closest gas stations are and having my directions spoken to me through my earbuds is incredibly convenient. I highly recommend one.     The book looks very interesting. I might grab a copy myself."

I ride all winter in Wisconsin, 15F and warmer. The neck warmer is the best in my opinion.    The throttle lock is something I would never install on my bike.   You should, it really increases comfort... even to just take your hand off the throttle for a bit to rotate your wrist around and relax it.    GPS horrible? Really? Knowing where the closest gas stations are and having my directions spoken to me through my earbuds is incredibly convenient.   Yes, because when I ride, I don't want to be told where to go or what to do by a computer. I ride to enjoy the ride and get lost in the journey. Not to find the most efficient route to my destination. When I plan a route, I look at a map before taking off in the morning and either memorize the roads or write them on my hand. If I take a wrong turn, oh well, that's part of the adventure, and I'll stop and ask for directions. I like to interact with people on my trips anyway.  In a day, I have to go to many different addresses for my job. I look it up on google maps, take mental note of the route I want to take, and then travel it, but I never use a GPS. I don't even like to use GPS for work, so I can't imagine ruining my rides with it.   Leatherman tool.   Useless in my opinion. There is nothing a leatherman could do that a proper tool kit can't accomplish better."

Yes, because when I ride, I don't want to be told where to go or what to do by a computer. I ride to enjoy the ride and get lost in the journey. Not to find the most efficient route to this or that place...   I certainly see your point and I agree as far as short rides. But most people are on a schedule and have an itinerary when on vacation especially when going long distance. That's the only time I use mine. If I'm not going far from home I don't even leave it hooked up. But I'd never go far without it. Just the Points of Interest info like fuel, food, hotels plus traffic avoidance would make it worthwhile even if it didn't also give me directions."
motorcyclesroadtrip,33xy3i,YourFairyGodmother,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:36:35 2015 UTC,"But isn't it fabric? It looks like it would get wet.   Mine is made of a really thick fleece, but it doesn't get wet for me. I put it on, then my jacket, then my helmet. This way it starts under my leather jacket, is only exposed for a couple inches in the neck area, and goes up to just over my mouth under my helmet.   Yes they're popular, but I rode a couple bikes that had them and it just seemed to me to be a safety issue. As in that extra second to release the throttle when a car pulls in front of me.    You use it when you feel safe to use it, don't when you don't... you really shouldn't be using it if you think a car might pull in front of you; you're hand should be ready to brake in that situation. It's mostly for just taking your hand off the throttle to stretch it for a few seconds. Although I tend to get a little comfortable with it and cruise for extended periods resting back against my luggage on highways. The amount of risk you take is completely up to you. I honestly couldn't ride the distances I do without it, I have one on both my bikes.   But most people are on a schedule and have an itinerary when on vacation especially when going long distance.    See, even those words... schedule, itinerary make me want to run the other way. Those words belong in a working environment, not on vacation (my opinion). When I take vacation, I just go... minimal planning. The last trip I took was me and my bike across the country that took a little over a month, and I just would wake up and go where I felt like going that day. I mean, I got into some bad situations because of it, but I also have some great stories because of it. Overall, I wouldn't have it any other way.  For instance, being halfway into Yellowstone after riding for 14 hours and it starts snowing. I had been planning on heading to Washington the next day. But when I took off at 11am the next morning and it was raining on me... teeth clenched, frozen to my bike... I ran South and all the way through Idaho and into Utah to warm up. And there, I fell in love with a town called Provo which I'm planning on moving to this winter because of how much I liked it. I'd have never found that town any other way. Just going wherever the wind blows (or isn't blowing). That's how I like to ride my bikes."

Funny story, I went to the Four Corners Monument which is a couple hours from that highway. When I got there it was like 110 degrees and there were at least 15 porta johns in place. The smell was indescribable. The local Indian tribe had a little touristy thing set up there, but I just ran to the monument, fired off a couple pictures and ran back to the bike before the stink knocked me out. I went hours out of my way to get there and I stayed like two minutes."
motorcyclesroadtrip,33xy3i,YourFairyGodmother,3,Mon Apr 27 00:49:44 2015 UTC,"Just plan a trip and do it. I've been riding for years but nothing more than short over nighters like you until last summer. A friend and I rode from Salt Lake City Utah to Fairbanks Alaska. It wasn't as difficult as I was worried it would be. It took some planning but after its planned you just hop on and ride. Going north in the summer gives you the advantage of more daylight so you can cruise at your own pace and take in the sights. We took 2 1/2 weeks and were riding anywhere from 200 to 500 miles a day but you could easily do more than that if you picked up the pace. We never once had to speed or felt rushed. I did a blog on the road of this trip. check it out for an idea of what the days are like and to get the actual mileage per day. http://clapforalaska.blogspot.com  There are programs and websites that offer all kinds of fancy ways to plan a motorcycle trip. the one I used allowed me to set up routes and send them to my gps and do all sorts of neat things but it didn't really make the trip any easier and after day 2 we were just using the gps to make sure we were on course for the next gas station. The site with the program I used: www.tyretotravel.com  Aside from the usual ""make sure you're bike is in good shape"" and ""buy this or that really expensive piece of gear"".......The best piece of advice I can offer is to at least have a plan of where you will be each night......that way you have an idea of what you need to get done each day and then you can work out the rest as you go. On your first big ride you will figure out so many things that the Internet will never be able to tell you......use that new knowledge for the next ride.   Good luck and ride safe!"
motorcyclesroadtrip,33xy3i,jtraf,5,Mon Apr 27 02:08:21 2015 UTC,"what kind of travel pace and style do you want to do? there ranges everything from riding relaxed non-divided highway (what's the global term for this?) to interstate/highway/motorway storming to the destination, to Iron Butt riding. the advice depends on how you want to travel.  a few universal tips are, I think:  test your gear BEFORE your trip. you dont want to figure out if you like something or know how to operate it while on your trip. this goes for everything, clothes, electronics, a new seat, whatever.   wear bicycle shorts under your crash pants. if you will be gone a while, bring enough pairs up to your tolerance for grime and having to do bath sink laundry every x days. wear all synthetics that wash and dry easily.  hover over your seat every x hundred miles for a few minutes to loosen up  as for distance, just set up a nice long one day route and do it. see how you feel. then set up your real trip.  finally, go for it!"

Over time it becomes difficult to really connect with people who have a lifestyle that you have consciously chosen to avoid. There just isn't a lot of common ground there to build a conversation/relationship around.  On the flip side if you find yourself sitting down with someone who has a similar set of priorities and who lives similarly you can feel like you have an almost magical ability to get what they are trying to say.

Normally I have a couple of days to decompress before returning to work/real life but since this was a stop before the end of the trip and with people I have known for years it was a real shock to me.    The other funny thing was my wife met me for the wedding and to follow me home and some of my friends were so baffled that she was fine my lifestyle.

You'll want to keep the paperwork/signed title/perhaps a letter from the seller in case you get pulled over to explain that it's not stolen etc.  Make sure you get your own insurance set up first, since you probably won't be well-covered by the seller's policy (if at all)  Don't miss Meteor Crater and the Natchez Trace on your way back!"

motorcyclesroadtrip,33ha76,Blazablaze2,2,Wed Apr 22 14:50:15 2015 UTC,"V-Strom 650  KLR is going to be buzzy as fuck and your going to be doing a lot of highway.  Throw on some luggage and aftermarket windscreen, radiator guards and skid plate.  The V-Strom is a rock solid motor, the bike has enough ground clearance that you will be able to explore easily, and ride confidently in dirt with the right tires, but still able to screw through the highway miles.  The stock seat is pretty good, gas milage is good and you have a pretty large range, power is linear but it has plenty of it so you can roll at 80 MPH on the freeway and still have passing power.  Also you get ABS standard with later models, but it cant be switched off, so if your looking to do serious dirt then you need a diff bike, but any serious dirt bike is not going to be good for getting to alaska  The only downside I can see is if you are short, the V-Strom is basically built for tall dudes going on adventures"

motorcyclesroadtrip,33ha76,flynnski,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:53:59 2015 UTC,"Dr650 is another option and a good alternative to the klr. I've done a fair amount of touring on mine and it can eat up freeway miles just fine. An aftermarket windshield is a must if you'll be spending a lot of time at high speeds, though.   edit: Also, the DR is air cooled so that's just one less thing to worry about than the KLR. And the DR has rocker arms on it's valves so you don't need any shims to do valve adjustments (which are also much easier on the DR)."
motorcyclesroadtrip,33ha76,vinnard,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:35:12 2015 UTC,The Dr650 was on my mind and does seem like another good option. How is the sound at high speed and do you think it would be held back by luggage?
motorcyclesroadtrip,33ha76,vinnard,2,Wed Apr 22 19:01:48 2015 UTC,Definitely won't be held back by luggage. Wind noise is mostly up to your helmet and I'd always recommend earplugs for long stints on the highway regardless of the bike/helmet. It's not any worse than other bikes I've ridden.  And it definitely won't be held back by luggage. My buddy's DR has two big panniers and a huge top case along with a safari tank and it trucks along just fine.  http://i.imgur.com/08aeYkL.jpg  His bike has been to Alaska and back and all over South America.

motorcyclesroadtrip,339ai0,SilvioBurlesPwny,3,Mon Apr 20 17:54:13 2015 UTC,"free advice.. for what it's worth -   I've basically done your route, but in reverse. I had good weather for the most part, and while I had a great time, I have to tell you that it is unbelievably exhausting.  The roads are slow on the southern half.  OMFG slow.  Many curves are posted 15mph, if you do 30mph around them, you start to white knuckle and leave a trail of pee.  Imagine driving on ice in a blizzard.. it's about that level of concentration.   You can get stuck behind RVs or a pack of HDs and grit your teeth for miles.  Fog can roll in for the evenings and mornings, and that makes things craycray.  Avoid night riding if at all possible... the curves are really hard unless you have crazy extra lights mounted.  Deer and elk are everywhere, especially bad dawn/dusk.  At one point I had to skitter by a loose bull that had wandered from his farm and was standing dead in the middle of the road, looking pissed.  There can be 80-100 mile stretches between fueling.. keep that in mind.  Hotels are stupid cheap.... 40-60 bucks will get you something that doesn't let rain in and has a TV and shower.  I wouldn't camp unless you like messing with gear.  If you haven't done multiday touring before... you're going to be sore. Everyday gets worse.  Roughing it... I choose to be more comfortable and sleep better because in the end I'll be less fatigued and that's far, far safer.  OK so I just made it seem hard and terrible... which it is.  Why we do it.  I'd do it again tomorrow if I could get away.  I did a 14 day trip down eastern washington, crossed over to the coast and up the 1.  Shortest day was 7 hours, longest day was 17.  Riding is AMAZEBALLS in California.    I'd recommend crossing at Sumas and going on part of the cascade loop and moving west eventually, rather than the ferry.  That's a great ride if you haven't done it before.   tl/dr you're going to be mentally and physically fatigued, plan for it, lots of rest, hydrate and eat well. It's a marathon, not a sprint."
motorcyclesroadtrip,339ai0,funbobbyfun,2,Tue Apr 21 06:05:28 2015 UTC,"also, did you jerry can it? 100 miles between stations is disaster waiting to happen.  My bike is new for me and I dont know how many miles it gets before Im doing the out of gas air hump hip thrust to keep it moving."
motorcyclesroadtrip,339ai0,funbobbyfun,1 point,Tue Apr 21 06:50:58 2015 UTC,"I have an indestructible and ugly as sin kwak old school connie with a 7 gallon tank.  I get 150 miles before I switch to reserve... so no, no jerry can.  I've thought about carrying one, and I've also thought about being enveloped in flame if I went down and the can burst.  I am a cheery fellow.  Just fuel every 90 minutes or 2 hours or so, good to get off the bike and do some stretches anyway.  What bike do you have? Is there specs on range?  You could always take a 2 litre jerry can along, and fill it if and when you were going to go waaaay into the boonies.  I never went off the major roads, excepting some day trips around wine country when I stayed in Marin County for 3 or 4 days."
motorcyclesroadtrip,339ai0,funbobbyfun,1 point,Tue Apr 21 09:31:49 2015 UTC,"cascade loop   Hey, thanks for this great advice.  I will be ready for it.  To be honest, San Fran is just a spot on the map, and if I dont make it there in time it is alright.  I usually as a rule dont put in more than 8 hours, unless its prarie riding which is fast and easy.    I have done a few long trips, central america, and Montreal to the top of Vancouver Island.  I know what you mean about exhaustion, but this is great advice as it will probably be raining, so extra butt puckering corners. The reason for camping out is that I am really short on cash, and I have another trip planned to go to Baja in July.    I have followed peoples advice for routes before so I may just follow yours but I have a few questions.  Why do you suggest I cross at Sumas-Abbotsford?  Its a bit out of the way no? The roads around there look straight as an arrow, which is fine, but why do you suggest not taking the Olympic route? Which way should I take to make my way to the coast? Highway 9 until I hit that loop youre talking about?    The internet tends to love this cascade loop, whats it like?"
motorcyclesroadtrip,339ai0,funbobbyfun,1 point,Tue Apr 21 06:48:51 2015 UTC,"lemme see if I can lay out a route on google maps that I did, and then you can see for yourself - the cascade loop will send you hella east, but it's nice mountain twisties with fantastic road conditions.  Americans can really do highways.  Crossing at Sumas will put you onto some really interesting roads headed SE, towards Mt Baker, and you can avoid the terror and drudgery that is the I5.  Lemme see if I can get a google map link set up."

Anyway, that's more or less the route I went going down... at somepoint I realized 2 things, 1, I really wanted to see Mt Shasta (arguably the best day riding I've ever had, for some reason there was not a single car going up or down, had the mountain to myself), and I needed to get to SF faster than I was going, so I veered onto the I5.    If I had to do it over, I would go further east still and bear south on the 395 before heading west on maybe the 49... was out of time.  Then from there after booting around in SF and Napa I went up the 1 til I crossed over to the I5 again at crescent city in Oregon..."
motorcyclesroadtrip,339ai0,Snappus,1 point,Tue Apr 21 10:08:46 2015 UTC,"Why do you suggest I cross at Sumas-Abbotsford?   Because the main crossing (on I-5) is always a nightmare, unless you have a Nexus Card, which allows you to use the express lanes. It's fairly common for the wait times to get across the border to be 2 hours or more. Even in a car it's pretty bad.  (Not really a motorcyclist, but I do cross the border often.)"
motorcyclesroadtrip,339ai0,ridepaddleclimb,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:24:09 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a great trip! Even if it does rain here and there. I have made some long trips and the best advice I can give is keep your gear as dry as you can, you may be soaked, but your gear (sleeping bag, towels, spare socks...) need to be dry, so when you do stop and pitch you tent in a down pour, you can crawl inside, dry off, and put on some dry clothes and call it a night!! A good rain suit will go a long way on a long trip that is forecast rain, and if it hasn't let up, get a room!! I have also traveled the Northwest, and it can get cold at night, even in the summer, so prepare for that. Wish I could meet you, but I'm strapped down in a damn cubical."
motorcyclesroadtrip,339ai0,ridepaddleclimb,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:47:09 2015 UTC,"Camping along the 101 is pretty easy - most of the campgrounds are marking along the highway - never took me longer than a half hour to find a campground to snooze at (usually about $5-10/night).   I did it in august without a tent (definitely bringing one next time) Whenever it rained, I got a motel (look for the most ghetto one with the most cars in the parking lot) - was usually paying ~$30/night. Any opportunity to spend a night a hostel is worth it (pending you make sure they're not a dry hostel. Made that mistake only once...).  A one-piece rainsuit is fucking key. and sunscreen..."

motorcyclesroadtrip,339ai0,-Ramblin-Man-,2,Mon Apr 20 23:03:35 2015 UTC,"yes.  For your purpose, check out the tyvek options.  A little google effort, some tyvek and tyvek tape, you get a water proof shelter.  My boyscout nephews are doing this.  For about 30-45 US dollars, you have a water proof sack that folds small.  Look here.  All I ask is post some pics.  And no need to refer to me.  Just reference the site you find.  This site seems cheap, but there are others.  I found one last year with 14x3 foot for 20.00 US.  I have opted for silnylon because i am backpacking.  You can cut tyvek to the size you want, then tape the seems.  Quick and easy. One thing to note, most don't zip up to keep out bugs and crawlies, but it could be done.  Tyvek tape is strong.  Good luck.  Just post one pic of the bike and your tyvek bivy on the site.  Okay, a bit more.  Do some reading.  Condensation is a bit of a problem.  I plan to put a bug net at both ends to mitigate (I perspire a lot).  When it is cold, the condensation can be a bit of a problem but the heat retention is worth it.  I plan, as stated, to put one pole that I found when hunting at the shoulder to drape it.  I did this with painters plastic drop cloth last year in October in the mountains of Colorado.  It worked well with a -20 bag.  Actually, it was awesome, waking to the night sky vacillating between full moon and snowing.  Okay, I have had enough scotch.  I wish you safe and adventurous travels.

There are a couple of weeks in January/February that might have snow or ice keeping you out of the mountains.   You shouldn't need heated gear in September, but you may need some warm layers for the chillier days up in the mountains. In September, it can start to get down around 55-ish F in the mountains.  I've ridden US-129 up to Deal's Gap in NC/TN (Tail of the Dragon) as late as December, and as early as the end of January. Check out Cherohala Skyway while you're there. NC-28/GA-28 from Deal's Gap to Pine Mountain, GA is a personal favorite, but would take you out of your way if you're heading West from Deal's Gap. There's a couple of overlooks on NC-28 South of Franklin, NC (and North of Highlands, NC IIRC) which look fantastic in the Fall, so it would be worth the excursion."

motorcyclesroadtrip,32y3yx,Pommeskobold,2,Sat Apr 18 03:15:51 2015 UTC,"I just finished my trip from Saigon to Hanoi, best experience of my life. Are you planning 2 weeks for the trip? You need more than 14 days. Buying/ selling a bike (nearly everyone is riding a Honda Win100) is very easy, but keep in mind that you will have problems on the way if the bike is not new. But that is not a problem, because there are mechanics everywhere and they are very cheap (replacing the carburetor is 5 bucks, replacing the front/ back brake 3 bucks). Try to never (really never, maybe except between Hue and Hoi An: Hai Van Pass) take the highway one (the big street near the coast connecting the north and south), it's horrible. Go for the north (especially Mu Cang Chai district) and Phong Nha Ke-Bang (including the west Ho Chi Minh trail and at least one of the caves). These regions were my highlights. Stop in villages, go for a coffee or meal, talk with the people, the vietnamese are the friendliest people I ever met and you will make friends in minutes even if you don't speak their language or they yours. If you want to know anything else, for example the route I took, just ask me :) You will have fun, I know it, everyone who can afford it should make this trip."
motorcyclesroadtrip,32y3yx,Chief-Drinking-Bear,1 point,Sun Apr 19 15:16:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah man I'd love to hear your route. I'm leaving in 2 weeks (well like 1 week now), have 34 days total to do the thing. I have a decent idea of how I'm gonna go at this point but I'd definitely be interested in hearing your itinerary and the timeframe you did it in.   Also: how did you get your travel insurance sorted for the trip? where can you get coverage without a Vietnamese license?"
motorcyclesroadtrip,32y3yx,Pommeskobold,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:22:46 2015 UTC,"I had no travel insurance, I don't think there is one that covers you when you are doing something illegal, and technically riding a bike there is illegal. I only had health insurance, and if I had to use it I would have said that I had the accident with a bicycle. 34 is enough for sure, I had only 22 days.  This is the List of the cities I stayed in over night: Phan Thiet, Da Lat, Nha Trang, Tuy Hoa, Pleiku, Hoi An, Hue, Phong Nha, Vinh, Thanh Hoa, Ban Lac, Phu Yen, Son La, Tu Le, Khanh Yen, Phu Ho. In some more than one night.   Here are some screenshots of my GPS-program of the route, maybe it helps. I can't do it better right now because I am still in Vietnam.  Have fun!"

motorcyclesroadtrip,32y3yx,Chief-Drinking-Bear,1 point,Mon Apr 20 07:45:07 2015 UTC,"I got one with my bike, it was a really good helmet with jaw protection and a clear Visor (that's what you should look for) so I didn't Need and try to buy one, but I saw many Shops that offered only helmets, so it should be no Problem. And if you Need anything more, just ask the guys at the reception of your Hotel, they should know where everything can be found."
motorcyclesroadtrip,32y3yx,Chief-Drinking-Bear,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:50:00 2015 UTC,I just back back from my trip doing the same thing. I bought my helmet in the states and brought it with me. I was advised against using theirs because they're extremely cheap eggshells and they won't fit our western heads. Their helmets actually fit fine but they were not quality. Costed a lot more but I think it was the smart decision.

Ignore a lot of the instincts that you have for dealing with traffic where you're from (I'm assuming you're from a place with fairly structured traffic rules) and go with the flow.  The safest thing you can do is adopt the local traffic rules

With luck, I'll be starting in about 3 -5 years (7-10 minus the luck).  I've been nosing around trying to get some data on shipping costs across the Atlantic, as well as possible ports of entry and exit (both air and sea).

Be careful with the Honduran borders(i took the south ones,El Salvador) and I had to literally flee across bored to Nicaragua because they would not let me go unless bribed. Even a teared corner of a registration paper will give them an excuse for a bribe, oh yeah just before border to Nicaragua there is a policeman who's soul purpose is to lure you in for ""speeding"" witch in turn will start a helper bribe spiral. Note, I did not at any time try to or was willing to bribe.  Other borders crossing are good though expect around 4+ hours per crossing. Also I would put in more stops in Colombia this country is awesome!!!! Every corner opens up for a new spectacular view. All police and military I meet where are very friendly. And the people even more so. :-)  Have a very nice ride, it will be an epic journey i'm sure :-D"
motorcyclesroadtrip,32lsp4,aadal_dk,2,Wed Apr 15 10:54:49 2015 UTC,"Im actually in Colombia now, and yes the views are spectacular and the roads are in good shape and fun to drive, after Central America I find Colombia to be quite a relief. The longest border crossing I had in Central America was around 3 hours I think, between Honduras and Nicaragua, but I did most of my crossings on secondary highways, away from the crowds of the actual pan-am. I've only had trouble with the police in Mexico City and Nicaragua. In Mexico City I had to pay a bribe to keep my motorcycle because they were going to impound it due to the fact that the number in which my license plate ends (1) is not allowed to drive in the city on Thursdays, which happens to be the day I was riding in. In Nicaragua there are police checkpoints everywhere and if they see you cross the yellow center line at any point they will take your license and give you a ticket. I talked my way out of one of these tickets and paid an $8 bribe to get out of another."

Is this ridiculous law there to help with traffic or in your opinion is it mainly a revenue generator?
motorcyclesroadtrip,32lsp4,aadal_dk,3,Thu Apr 16 01:46:10 2015 UTC,"""Pico y placa"" it's called in Colombia, it's there to minimize traffic, though it doesn't seem to work, it's automated there, with cameras(Medellin) and I don't think it applies to none Colombian plates. And it's pretty expensive too around 150-200 US to get caught, so one is always nervous to get home before it starts in the afternoon."
motorcyclesroadtrip,32lsp4,thantheman,3,Thu Apr 16 08:58:59 2015 UTC,"I think this law does quite a bit to improve the traffic of Mexico City, but I beleive the real reason for its existence is to improve air quality. Mexico City sits in a natural bowl created by surrounding mountains, this means there is not a lot of air flow through the valley and airborne pollution tends to stick around. Less cars equal less pollution. I actually think this law is a great idea, I just wish I had known about it before entering. I now check to see if such a law exists before I enter any major city, and it turns out that many cities have similar laws (medellin, Bogotá, Quito to name a few) Im going to Quito in a few days, and #1 is not allowed on Monday. I bet you can guess who has two thumbs and is not going trawling for a $100 ticket...this guy."
motorcyclesroadtrip,32lsp4,yemmit,2,Thu Apr 16 14:24:26 2015 UTC,Interesting.  Good to know it actually helps somewhat with its objective.  Still seems a little ridiculous though.  I'm hoping public transportation is good enough to make this law feasible.
motorcyclesroadtrip,32lsp4,burnwhencaught,3,Thu Apr 16 15:13:17 2015 UTC,"As far as public transportation, Mexico City has the best metro I've ever seen, and Quito has a pretty decent system of busses that run like light rail so it's not like people are left without an option. As someone born and raised in the United States I tend to have a negative gut reaction to laws limiting personal freedoms, but in this case I'm convinced that these limitations are entirely warranted."

motorcyclesroadtrip,32lsp4,burnwhencaught,2,Fri Apr 17 09:18:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks yemmit! The Motorcycle is a 1997 kawasaki KLR 650. The previous owner did just about all of the modifications, the most important of which were upgrading the doohickey (cam chain tensioner), upgrading the subframe bolts, adding crash bars and luggage racks, and replacing the rear shock. I bought this motorcycle used for $2100. So far I haven't had much dificulty keeping it safe, usually I'm kind of off the beaten path, away from the areas of high thievery, but when I'm in a city usually there is the option to park it somewhere safe. I also carry a heavy cable lock so I can lock it to a lamp post if need be."

motorcyclesroadtrip,31st79,mightdoabiketrip,4,Tue Apr 7 21:59:19 2015 UTC,"I am usually a meticulous planner but when we did our big trip I was flat out busy right up until the day we left so I had planned the route but hadn't had a chance to work out where we would stop each night or book much accommodation etc. This forced us into a mix of your second & third option, where some of our accommodation was booked and some we had to organise on the fly.  What I found with the pre-booked things was that it put pressure on us that we didn't really like. We had to get to a certain town to check in before the office closed. If we didn't have that commitment we would have taken our time and maybe stopped earlier in the day and had a more relaxed journey. A few days we totally winged it, just rode to the town we wanted to stay at and tried to find a place to stay. This bit us in the arse when we got to one town that was fully booked out due to it being peak tourist season. They said we could camp on the local sports oval if we wanted but that didn't appeal. We all did a bit of a ring around and ended up getting in contact with friend's parents who lived in that town and camping on their back lawn. On the day, when we didn't have a place to stay and I was buggered from a long day on the bike, I sat down on the side of the road next to my bike and cried (I'm allowed cos I'm a girl). Now I look back on it as part of an awesome adventure that we had.   As far as relying on your phone goes, I was traveling in Australia not Europe but we were always able to find somewhere to charge it and never had a problem.  With regard to changing bikes I was riding a Yamaha 650 XVS and I thought it was awesome. Then I changed up to a 1200 Harley Sportster and I am in love. The extra power is just sooo nice to have at my disposal. I didn't realise that I was always pushing my 650 until I rode a bike that I didn't have to push. Word of warning though, don't buy your new bike and head straight off around Europe. Make sure you have time to learn the foibles of the new machine and work out where all the bits are."
motorcyclesroadtrip,31st79,LazyAdventurer,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:51:02 2015 UTC,"I can see that having a rigid plan like that in place could be a pain. As you say, if plans change or things happen, it can put unnecessary pressure on ourselves (for instance, there is a delay somewhere, we can't get to the booked place that day and all subsequent bookings get messed up unless we catch up on ourselves). It does sound like it has the potential to sap some of the adventureness out of it too.  I think the main worry about my phone was signal coverage while out in the countryside and not running up too big a bill in international calls/internet, but if I'm careful I can use wifi points to do most of that. I can charge it off my bike battery as I ride along.  I think the extra power will be nice to have. On the one hand, it is  quite to have a bike that needs a little bit of pushing, but over doing hundreds of miles a day, it might just be a bit tiring.  Anyway, your comment is really encouraging. Thanks!"

Since you do not have to worry about reservations with campsites, by the time I'm ready to rest I'd just look up the nearest campsite in my navigator and ride there. If I don't like the place, I'd just move to the next one, since there are so many. (This only happened once, when I stumbled upon an abandoned campsite in Poland)  Regarding bike change.. Frankly, In my opinion you'd better stick to the bike you know for the trip, unless you absolutely can't trust it. There is no knowing what might fail during a trip, and having a bike you know inside out helps quick-fixing it. Although being a Viffer rider myself, I can't recommend it enough :)"
motorcyclesroadtrip,31st79,YourFairyGodmother,1 point,Wed Apr 8 09:53:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link, looks interesting. Some campsites I've been to before have required booking, but it tends to be popular sites during the summer. I think that's what I'll be aiming for, trying to find good places as I go along with some useful tools at my disposal to help.  I see where you are getting at about the bike. Unfortunately I am not one to know my bike inside and out despite many years of riding. I can re-tension a chain, change the oil and make adjustments but that is about as far as I can go and there is not much variation for those sort of things between bikes.  Maybe I will try to brush up on these things, but it shouldn't make a difference if it is one bike or another. I will at least be covered by the AA if something goes really awry.  VFRs look amazing, I need to find a place where I can try out all of these bikes. Annoyingly there is only one second hand dealer near me and they didn't have any of the bikes I wanted to try."
motorcyclesroadtrip,31st79,YourFairyGodmother,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:38:59 2015 UTC,"Plans are nice but they are  made to be broken flexed. Through years of touring we find that setting a direction and a maybe destination works for us.  Each day while having our coffee after striking camp - we go very minimal, just a tent, beeping slags, way to make coffee.  Start the stove, strike the camp, coffee (*$$ Via oackets are terrific for motocamping) is ready so we pull out the map and decide on a general direction / destination for the day.  Finish loading up the bikes and head for a diner for breakfast.  There we do a more thorough search of the map to look for interesting roads / things.  If we find something interesting that doesn't quite fit with that day's ""plan"" we amend it.   Only one of those bikes, the ST, makes for a great touring machine. Says the guy who has been touring on sportbikes since before you were potty trained. ;)  They're all good machines though.  I've gotten too old for my SV1000S with the GSXR front end (yeah, I toured with that machine, many many thousands of miles).  I'm looking at a Hyperstrada (most wanted but probably too expensive), FJ9 (looks like a GREAT machine but what would it be like on rough, possibly unpaved roads?), Aprilia Dorsoduru (1200 is in Hyperstrada price range, 750 is a teensy bit underpowered for my tastes), or maybe I'll get a (relatively speaking) inexpensive Aprilia Shiver and make some touring related mods) Decisions decisions.     Anyway, how will you use your bike is the question.  If you plan to do a lot of touring the ST is your bike. It's probably at the bottom of the list if you like to do ""spirited"" riding day in day out and only some touring."
motorcyclesroadtrip,31st79,Litrebike,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:07:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, seems like the consensus is that a flexible approach is best.  There are far too many different bikes and nowhere to try them out, hah. The supermoto styled bikes are very interesting too. I was looking at the KTM Superduke, but they seem to be expensive and apparently are a pain to get spares for so I was put off a bit. Similar issue with Ducatis.  I like the sportiness of my Fazer and don't want to lose too much of that. I kinda use the bike for everything as a main form of transport and having some fun with it at the same time.  The idea of a triple cylinder engine appeals a lot to me too.  I'm just gonna have to try and seek out some bikes to do proper test rides."

motorcyclesroadtrip,31st79,SnotFunk,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:37:03 2015 UTC,"I have to completely support upgrading on engine capacity. I don't even know of any proper sports-tourers that are less than 900cc. At motorway speeds, the engine is so much more at ease. I hated the sound my CBF 600 made on the motorway, constantly sounding strained. My Z1000SX (which is a great tourer for a sporty bike, but quite pricey compared to things like the Sprint -- it has panniers and adjustable flyscreen, and I've added heated grips) just eats those miles up.  I think things like the Sprint and the VFR would be great; you'd have to get aftermarket luggage systems for the FAZER 1, and it's not fully fared, which can also impact on long distance comfort. Consider things like the Triumph Tiger, too, which has the same engine as the Sprint but in adventure styling, it's a very comfortable ride that will keep the wind off you nicely. Don't underestimate the usefulness of shelter from the wind on longer trips if you're not going to be constantly doing twisties."
motorcyclesroadtrip,31st79,duuuh,0,Fri Apr 10 07:40:18 2015 UTC,"It might come down to cost in the end. The FZS1000 seems to be the cheapest to buy. I already have a top box and soft panniers, but hard panniers would be good to have.  The Fazer 600 does seem to cope pretty well with the motorway, but it tends to vibrate a lot in the middle range which can be annoying. Tiger looks great, but again a bit expensive.  Thanks for the info, really helpful."
motorcyclesroadtrip,31st79,pennsylvaniaassembly,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:24:57 2015 UTC,"I'd choose soft panniers over hard panniers. Soft panniers are easier to pack away at home, they don't break and scratch when you drop them or the bike comes of the sidestand... They weigh less and you can usually make them smaller when not fully packed so better aero dynamics."

motorcyclesroadtrip,31s4hi,SnotFunk,1 point,Sat Apr 11 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"Hey I have done about 3 Euro trips so far, the biggest mistake I've seen people make is plan there trip going from city to city visiting as many countries as possible, what happens then is you spend a lot of time on the motorway hours on end and it really isn't as enjoyable. Also you can do city trips by flying and it's much cheaper.   What you really should do is choose a few countries and experience incredible roads and scenery, although that's not to say you can't hit up some cities now and then to relax and socialize with backpackers in hostels(and attractive Aussie and US ladies ;) )!  My Most favorite trip was going from NW England all the way down to Dubrovnik, the only motorway I took was to Hull for the ferry and then to the Black Forest, after that it was all mountain passes and twist roads to Zurich to see a friend, followed by more mountain passes to Lake Como in Italy. After that it was even more mountain roads over to the Dolomites and then well you get the idea, it was topped off with an incredible ride down the Adriatic Highway.  What I have done is plan my trip around mountains, forests and great roads. Check out: http://www.bestbikingroads.com you can even download the route tracks for the all the top rated roads.

motorcyclesroadtrip,31o2cr,Kiwicat00,3,Tue Apr 7 00:49:35 2015 UTC,"Go for it man! As for recommended gear I'll quote a post I made a while back:   I pack way too much stuff on my bike usually, but as long as it's tightly bound to the frame somehow it doesn't affect the ride in any negative way so I don't worry too much about it. As for essentials I usually bring most of the tools I'd need to do any sort of field repairs, especially electrics (in my experience, electrics are what's most likely to leave you stranded at the side of the road on an old shitty bike). At least one set of good town clothes is nice to have, especially if you're meeting new people. At least one set of black (hard to stain with grease) shitty clothes is nice to have for when you need to do your inevitable repairs. Rain gear is key, get stuff made for cyclists: it's usually pretty durable and easier to pack, but if cost is a big factor then get gore tex stuff from an army surplus. Don't buy the shitty walmart pvc rain suits: they'll sweat you out from the inside, they're about as durable as a wet napkin, they're bulkier and harder to put on then fabric rain gear, and they'll leave you with all sorts of anxiety every time you see a dark cloud on the horizon because you'll think to yourself ""aww, I need to put that shit on again..."". Google maps on a smartphone is the bomb, I usually don't look at the screen and just use the audio notifications. I seriously am amazed people were once able to road trip without it! Hooking a 12v usb charger to the bike somewhere will make your life way easier. Buying a heated vest is maybe the best motorcycling investment I've ever made."

motorcyclesroadtrip,31em11,WockaWockaSK8,2,Sun Apr 5 07:00:52 2015 UTC,"Changing the sprocket changes all of the gears though not just the top gear.  It wouldn't redistribute the range evenly, just knock the whole lot down.  So yes the engine would be working less at top speed, but wouldn't I lose some noticeable accelleration further down?  Might have to ride the clutch a bit excesively in 1st?  I'm far from an expert so open to ideas!"
motorcyclesroadtrip,31em11,beermatt,2,Sun Apr 5 17:12:47 2015 UTC,"It would redistribute evenly, they all change equally when the sprocket changes. A +1 up front and -2 out back will cost a little bit of acceleration but could chop 1000+ RPM off at 60MPH. It's something you'd notice at first but you're on a 600cc sport bike, you'll still be plenty fast. You can't have wicked acceleration and top end without adding horsepower, gearing won't change that. If you want a better top end, you need to pull from somewhere, that or buy a more powerful bike.  You would need more clutch than before, but we're talkig about very minute changes here. There are online calculators which will tell you percentage changes for gearing. You'll need to know your sprocket sizes but can calculate off of that. I'd guess that a +1/-2 would add 5 mph to 1st gear, 15-20mph to 6th at 6000k RPM, but check it out."
motorcyclesroadtrip,31em11,WockaWockaSK8,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:19:19 2015 UTC,"What I meany by distributing evenly was extending the top gear but leave 1st gear as it is, and the ones inbetween proprtionally.  I know that's not physically possibly, but I imagine bikes designed for touring/cruising would come out of the factory already setup with those sort of ratios.  I'm not looking for any increases, just with it not being the fastest of sports bikes in the first place a bit wary about losing much acceleration.  Also that extra 5mph in 1st gear might get annoying at times.  I guess I could try going 1 down on the front, see how it handles and if I don't like it switch back to the original?  I already had the chain and sprockets replaced fairly recently so am not due a full change any time soon."
motorcyclesroadtrip,31em11,beermatt,5,Wed Apr 8 15:30:01 2015 UTC,"The best touring motorcycle is a bike that is comfortable for a long amount of time. Any bike can have saddlebags strapped on.  But to be more specific touring bikes come in many shapes and sizes. On the cruiser side you have things like the Kawasaki voyager. These are cruiser style bikes that generally have a large displacement v-twin, classic styling, saddlebags, tailbag, big front windscreen, and comfortable handlebars.  On the other hand you have things like the Kawasaki Concours. This is essentially a large heavier sportbike with saddlebags, big windscreen, comfortable handlebars, and a more neutral riding position when compared to a supersport.  Next there are bikes that fit between the two of those extremes and are often considered dedicated touring bikes like the Honda Goldwing. These sort of bridge the gap between a touring cruiser and a sport tourer. They generally offer better performance than the cruisers but are heavier and less nimble than a sport touring bike. But like the others they have a large windscreen, comfortable riding position, and saddlebags or hard cases.  As you can see the common attributes of touring bikes are saddlebags, comfortable riding position, and a big windscreen.  But the best short answer I can give you is any bike can be a touring bike as along as it can handle the highway for 8 hours and your butt can handle those 8 hours.  Edit: You also have adventure touring bikes which are a touring motorcycle that has some off-road capability."
motorcyclesroadtrip,31em11,Laptop-Gamer,2,Sat Apr 4 10:01:53 2015 UTC,"There's the whole sport touring class, too.  edit: admitting I skimmed your well thought out, and written comment. I was wrong.   OP, listen to this guy, start small, find what's comfortable and fun, and ride with people who practice safe riding and have a thorough communication system. Good luck!"
motorcyclesroadtrip,31em11,GingerHero,3,Sun Apr 5 19:08:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry to say, but it really depends on what you want to do. I found the v-strom 650 a great bike for US and Latin america, Though I would have liked a bit more clearance for the ""topes"", speedbumps, in Mexico (There are MANY!) Here in Europe I have an old NX650 witch I can't recommend for touring in EU, given that the interstate speeds are pretty high, 130ish and a  1 cylinder is more or less at top speed when on interstate.  Other than this it also depends on budget. Some do the whole world on a 50cc or pushbikes, I guess what i'm saying is any bike will do. But pick one that doesn't bore or ruin you. Head over to HUBB/ADVrider there are always travel bikes to buy, many KLR's."
motorcyclesroadtrip,31em11,aadal_dk,1 point,Sat Apr 4 10:04:03 2015 UTC,"I second the V-Strom.  Mine (07 DL650 ABS) has a Russells Day-Long seat on it and I have comfortably sat on it for 7+ hour days.  The bike is very economical, easy to maintain, and will last forever. Also, it was the motorcycle that I learned on and would recommend to a beginner. However, a lot of people would disagree with me on this claiming it is too big.   The only bad thing I can say about the v-strom is it's ugly as sin and the Russell seat makes it even uglier."

motorcyclesroadtrip,31em11,fubar3,2,Sat Apr 4 11:22:27 2015 UTC,I support the sentiment that any bike you can sit yourself on for 8 hours a day many days in a row can count as an tourer.   Checking out these guys - which I suggest cause they're cool people - http://www.corporaterunaways.com/ Dachary at the prep stage of their first trip wants to ride a ninja 250 just to shut haters up!

motorcyclesroadtrip,31em11,seven_seven,2,Sun Apr 5 00:29:21 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. At a very affordable price, this is no doubt the best choice. Get a VFR is you want sporty seating position. The Bandit is the best of everything. Massive torque, great fuel economy, good power, great carrying capacity, lots of aftermarket parts to make it unique. Simple and cheap to maintain. Goes for miles and miles on end. Seriously there is no better budget tourer than the Bandit 1250.  Here is mine from a 500km day-trip last summer :)"
motorcyclesroadtrip,31em11,hejnfelt,1 point,Sun Apr 5 08:10:21 2015 UTC,"Ride comfort. After hours and hours anything wrong with your bike will become very very apparent.  Fuel Gauge: it's a pain not knowing how much gas you have left. You either fill up too often, or run the risk of running out.  Availability of parts: it's cool having that rare/vintage/unusual bike, until you're broken down in the middle of nowhere and it'll take forever to get parts, or you can't find someone who can work on it."
motorcyclesroadtrip,31em11,caliform,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:09:45 2015 UTC,"I never missed a fuel gauge on any of my rides. If you have no reserve light it may be an issue, but even then I just track the odo - I know when I run out. My bike's range was 120-150 miles, so I gassed up every 100. Easy."
motorcyclesroadtrip,31em11,ottothecow,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"Aware of that, but I don't want to be staring at the odo all the time."
motorcyclesroadtrip,31em11,caliform,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:42:54 2015 UTC,"My bike's range was 120-150 miles, so I gassed up every 100.    I think that is his point.  If your bike could have made it to 150, you could have gone 50% further on that tank.  If you are trying to put down serious distance, that is a big waste of time.  A fuel gauge would alleviate that.  Not a big deal on my bike in town when I refill around 130 miles every couple weeks.  It starts sputtering, I flip the tank to reserve, and head for a gas station.  Works fine when you are always in town and close to a station...but in a less developed area, an actual meter would be much better than a sputtering engine.    And mileage isn't always 100% accurate.  I once ended up walking the bike a ways after forgetting to switch back from reserve...the motor was acting up and burning more fuel than usual so I went dry at 108 miles.  The reserve would have saved me if I hadn't screwed that up....but a gauge would have made it easy, and for a long road trip, easy is good."
motorcyclesroadtrip,31em11,caliform,0,Mon Apr 6 22:43:51 2015 UTC,"Point taken. Regardless, it's always wise to gas up at far less than actual capacity. Gauges are also fallible, so it's best to just gas up on a regular interval, which is best expressed as distance dictated by the type of surface and speed you travel at. I wouldn't trust a fuel gauge at all, in fact, much less so than the odometer."

motorcyclesroadtrip,316i37,MakerzMark,2,Thu Apr 2 11:58:36 2015 UTC,"I strongly recommend working your way down to Yerevan, if just for the day. It's quite an amazing city.   If you're feeling adventurous, in Tbilisi you should stay at the Tbilisi Hostel. The owner Ralph is one of the most unique people I've ever met. Don't plan to sleep much.  I imagine you will cross the border into Turkey through Batumi. I haven't ever been through the Black Sea area of Turkey, but I know that the roads are a bit shit, so take your time, avoid wandering cows (or cows just sleeping on the road), and bad drivers.  Go south through Turkey and stop in Kars, Doubayazit, Mardin, Diyarbakir, Nemrut Dagi, Gobekli Tepe, Hatay. Then blast past Adana (though stop for some kebab and tursu), then follow the southern coast to Antalya. Stop in Olympos and Kabak. Head north to Izmir and call my friend Semih and he'll join you and take you to some crazy shit. From Istanbul, cross into Bulgaria and chose your own adventure.  Have fun, I'm jealous."
