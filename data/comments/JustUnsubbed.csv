I've seen a lot of anecdotes along those lines (example: Man faces gaol for disagreeing with feminist online), but they always turn out to be misleading when you look more closely (the feminist in question claimed to be scared for her safety, so her alleged harasser has had criminal harassment charges brought against him, however the trial is still ongoing). I'd also suggest you look up the actual wording of affirmative consent laws. They're not the radfem dystopia that people make them out to be."

Really I think most of this is a result of all that gamer gate shit. Meta subreddits picked sides and that led to them becoming very politicized. So far TPS is probably the most neutral, but even then you can still see the effects GG had on it.

JustUnsubbed,3ds7e2,cdb3492,5,Sun Jul 19 03:23:43 2015 UTC,Circumcision is definitely worth talking about. What winds me up is when it's used as a rebuttal to women's issues. What about me?!! You know?

I mean, you have to have pretty strong willpower to be mature enough to not mess with people like that. That was the only one I ever posted on Reddit for a laugh though.  On the other hand, I'll never understand or sympathise with people who constantly text back creeps while demanding that others look at them with pity.

It's a problem of disproportionate retaliation. Just walking away, or maybe even a slight push could diffuse the situation much better than going into all out attack mode.   Now, if there's a huge 6 ft. woman who starts trying to strangle you, or if they pull a knife; then yes, go ahead and defend yourself.

There was a post, maybe a month or so ago, where some black guy is harassing some old white woman and she's telling him off, and eventually she spits on this guy and he decks her. I remember thinking that there were so much context missing of what was happening before he started recording, and surely the comments would agree, but they were all people cheering this woman getting punched, saying she deserved it for spitting on the guy."

Like, if you could go there and receive actual advice on your own setup.  Ask for help with your drip brew? Their only solution is to get a french press instead.  Need help with your espresso machine? Their solution is to get a different espresso machine, because ""if it costs less than $2000, it's not a real espresso machine!""  What are some good Keurig pods, guys? ""Literally kill yourself.""

I mean, you can get a good, large french press for less than 30 dollars. It's literally just a tub that you put your grind in while it soaks and a metal strainer on a stick, and adding more money to the price can't really jazz up that concept. So even though well-functioning french presses are highly affordable, they still get treated like some coffee snobbery symbol.

The setup posts I have no problem with, I always love to see other users' listening rooms and compare them to my own. The record posts - not so much. Terms used in titles such as beauty, grail, and gem are all circlejerky/cringe terms, and it also doesn't help when there are so many posts releated to this paticualr album keep popping up from time to time.  This post that I've mentioned in the post above is basically saying ""look at this beauty"" on a record we've seen and heard a million times (look here), and on top of that, the OP made some of the cringiest titles and picture captions I have ever seen in that subbreddit. Also, look at the comments - they look like /r/gaming level comments if you ask me - just straight up circlejerking.  As a result, they lost another subscriber - me."

Linux is a great operating system, and I use it almost exclusively. The only time I don't use it is for gaming, simply because Linux - or rather the game developers - are still too far behind. It's not that the OS itself isn't suited for gaming, it's simply because the market is far too small for the majority of game developers and publishers to put any effort in it.  Sure, if all you want to play are indie games or retro games via DOSBox or ScummVM, or some other emulator, you're fine. But if you want to play triple-A titles, you're limited to only a small number of games. And don't get me started on ""then just use Wine"". I mean, Wine is great. It's a massive accomplishment deserving any and all recognition and praise it gets. But more often than not, your only choice to play triple-A games is to play them on the OS they were written for, i.e. Windows. I sincerly hope that this changes one day, but until then i'm going to keep gaming on Windows unless the game I want to play runs natively in Linux."

I used to browse TiA a lot but recently I haven't been there in a week or so, might unsub later just to quit seeing the circle continue. The way I see it as both sides were part of a larger group, and once both groups somewhat excised the two together, they just floated off and now orbit eachother, each with some odd irrational hate, whereas they both will confuse the larger, less radical group for the crazies on the other side. I think the reason nobody at TiA has really noticed too much is because the crazy is still there, so as far as either side knows, the other is still the bogeyman. An easier way is like that Japanese soldier on that small Asian island who never knew WWII ended."

JustUnsubbed,3c088z,ShankingTonberry,2,Fri Jul 3 20:53:32 2015 UTC,"People, especially mods, have been angry at the admins for a long time now because of a huge lack of communication and how there is zero support for mods. Mod tools are total shit and most rely on third party stuff. Reddit recently fired Victoria and gave no warning to IAMA which was the catalyst for the latest shit storm because they left that sub in a really bad situation. Dozens of other subs chose to go private in support because the mods are furious at how admins refuse to help or acknowledge how much unpaid work mods put into helping the site grow. It's basically a full time job for larger default subs."

In fact, it's impossible to sue anyone for many things like medical costs because ACC covers it instead so there's no lawsuits.  Sure you can be fired for what you say online - if what you said reflected on the company itself. There was even a case a few years ago where someone won a case against their boss because they were fired for something that was on their private FB newsfeed. We have significantly better employment laws than America - you NEED a true reason to fire someone and even then you must have documentation proving you tried to fix the issue.   That sub is full of people making up their own controversial lies about places they've never been to try and sound relevant."
JustUnsubbed,3c1m6l,ShankingTonberry,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:26:48 2015 UTC,"The same thing has also happened with people pushing a political agenda for one party or another.  There is a perfect story in the news where a witness claimed that a family dog jumped between a huddled family and a road rage shooter to ""take the bullet.""  But NTO is pushing ""[PoliticalCandidate] says [DumbThing]"" in order to shame [PoliticalCandidate] and start a ridiculous thread of comments bashing the entire opposing party."
JustUnsubbed,3bzp7f,BlueBack,21,Fri Jul 3 13:31:29 2015 UTC,"I'm already so tired of this entire situation. Why do users have to suffer just because Reddit management fucked up? They're not going to revert their actions just because a bunch of subreddits go on private for a tiny bit. Seriously, it's so damn annoying how reddit insantly goes into insanity mode when something like this happens."
JustUnsubbed,3bzp7f,Serdone,2,Fri Jul 3 14:05:18 2015 UTC,"I do get where you're coming from. I found reddit several times before I registered through google searches that took me to some tiny post in a tiny sub. Those communities are the ones that drive reddit, for me anyway.   I'm torn on this issue. We've seen reddit, as a whole, get a lot crappier over the last several months. I've been able to shrug when the major events happen because the bullshit hasn't seeped into my little corner of reddit just yet.   With each of these events, though, I'm increasingly worried that the shitty decisions made by the admins will begin to impact my small subs. I can see arguments for and against going dark. I respect your decision."
JustUnsubbed,3bzp7f,cdb3492,6,Fri Jul 3 17:12:35 2015 UTC,"I've been redditing for nearly a decade. It's always been getting ""worse"". Truly, I think the default community is worse, and the admins may not know how to handle it. But Reddit is still a great entity. Especially the smaller subs."
JustUnsubbed,3bzp7f,lazydictionary,4,Fri Jul 3 19:33:32 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised by how many people in all this look down upon any sort of civil disobedience against an administration that very openly doesn't care about it's community.   You guys get over yourselves, these subreddits aren't shuttered permanently,  it's only for a day, maybe two if things get bad.   ""You're depriving people!  You're hurting the community!"" Are you fucking kidding me? And you think you're better than ""inflated moral outrage"" when thats exactly what you're engaging in?   Whining about being inconvenienced by not accessing a subreddit for a day is scores more ""petty"" than privatizing a subreddit to make a statement."

Just noticed /r/pic, /r/BollywoodRealism, /r/skyrim and /r/Tinder went private, left those too. /r/youdontsurf has gone private as a joke. I can live with that."
JustUnsubbed,3bzp7f,callmebrick,2,Fri Jul 3 13:36:37 2015 UTC,https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/mine/ Unsub away!   Thank you very much!
JustUnsubbed,3bzp7f,happykoala4,2,Fri Jul 3 14:13:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's an issue you really should care about. The firing of Victoria was just the spark that lit the massive tinder box of anger the community's had towards the new Reddit staff under Ellen Pao, really what this mass protest is about the admins' treatment of mods in general and their complete distancing from the community as a whole, whether for big subs or smaller subs. Without mods reddit pretty much wouldn't exist, and a lot of mods dedicate enough time and effort to the point that it might as well be a full-time paying job, yet they all do it for free.  It might not affect these smaller subs (though /r/citiesskylines really isn't that small of a sub) immediately, but if something isn't done about the lack of transparency, ignoring of mods, censorship, etc. then trust me, it will eventually."
JustUnsubbed,3bzp7f,Chuulimta,8,Fri Jul 3 14:32:40 2015 UTC,"And if the 'censorship' reaches the rest of the site people will find another community to be a part of. There's no reason to care about reddit politics when sites like reddit are a dime a dozen and it's extremely easy to change which one you use. The drama involving Pao and Victoria is asinine, and the outcry about recent events is pointless when it doesn't affect 99% of content of reddit."
JustUnsubbed,3bzp7f,happykoala4,3,Fri Jul 3 15:08:14 2015 UTC,"The thing is sites like reddit aren't a dime a dozen. Hopefully in the future they will be, but there's simply no good competitors to reddit at the moment, let alone any with a decent userbase. Voat's servers are being overloaded with all the traffic, it's easy to forget that Digg even exists, and Stacksity has such a tiny userbase, plus it lacks the robust structure reddit has at the moment with giving mods access to CSS and what not."
JustUnsubbed,3bzp7f,lazydictionary,2,Fri Jul 3 15:31:51 2015 UTC,"CSS for mods is useless to me. I have never been to a sub where their CSS was in a way useful. The default Reddit look just works for me.  Reddits big advantage is user base. It's a massive site, and dethroning a king isn't easy."

JustUnsubbed,3bx9ta,ChokeZero,21,Thu Jul 2 22:26:17 2015 UTC,It became pretty obvious to me a few months ago that most of the comments and a great deal of the posts on TIA are blatantly anti-feminist not anti-tumblrfeminist.
JustUnsubbed,3bx9ta,minethrowawa,-7,Fri Jul 3 06:07:27 2015 UTC,Does TiA oppose gender equality now? Those bastard MRAs!!!! When will it stop
JustUnsubbed,3bx9ta,meoxu8,14,Sun Jul 5 21:12:47 2015 UTC,"Yep, you hit the nail on the head. Especially the part where if you try to point out something normal, they attack you for being ""triggered"". It's to the point where you could be a true feminist who believes in equality (and not hating men) but if they got wind of that they'd attack you for it."
JustUnsubbed,3bx9ta,ShankingTonberry,9,Fri Jul 3 02:04:33 2015 UTC,"Any time you try to say something seems a little racist or sexist, you'll get like 10 responses all saying a different reiteration of ""triggered"". It's so fucking retarded."
JustUnsubbed,3bx9ta,ShankingTonberry,16,Fri Jul 3 02:11:33 2015 UTC,"I had to delete my old account because a few of them got wind of me posting about how I was raped for my virginity (not in TIA of course) and how I would always avoid rape jokes after that and a group of them kept sending me messages calling me ""weak and pathetic"" for not getting over it because there's ""heaps"" of other survivors out there who joke about it so I should stop being a whiny bitch because they know better than me about that stuff. Not exaggerating. Note that I specifically said I avoid the jokes and that I don't demand strangers keep their mouths shut to protect my feelings. My inbox just kept going off with them messaging me and downvoting all my comments. I took a long break from reddit over that - although I bet if TIA found that out they'd just message me over and over again asking if I was ""triggered"" over a joke again."
JustUnsubbed,3bx9ta,ShankingTonberry,10,Fri Jul 3 04:37:01 2015 UTC,"I'm so, so sorry. I think there's a certain number of people on tia and reddit in general that are radical MRAs with zero respect for rape victims. It's, ""If you can't just get over it, you're being a whiny bitch attention whore"". It really makes me shake my head in a mixture of shock and disappointment to see people act like that.   Also ""triggered"" has got to be the worst word these types have ever latched onto. Anything remotely breaking an even mildly racist or sexist circlejerk is ridiculed by people making trigger jokes."

JustUnsubbed,3bx9ta,detroitmatt,11,Thu Jul 2 22:37:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I was also an early subscriber, and in the beginning it was much more about the zaniness of tumblr, back when tumblr had a reputation for emotional teenagers instead of radical feminists.

For TiA, 30-40% of the posts are tumblrinas saying some stupid ass shit, but 60-70% of the posts are just people whining over what are either jokes or fairly benign statements.   I'm not about to unsubscribe to TiA, but I've found it's just easier to ignore the shit posts. I wish I could subscribe to SRS, but for some reason I can't. I guess I must be banned, which is weird, because I've been banned from subs before, but I've never not been able to subscribe to a public subreddit.

There are probably a million comments a week between the two of them. There is only so much you can do to make such active places more in tuned with your world view.

JustUnsubbed,3bqt2z,PatriotsFTW,2,Wed Jul 1 18:58:50 2015 UTC,"I'm a mod of the sub. If you'll humor me I'll try and address some of these.  For the most part, at the moment, we're looking to improve on our ability to moderate the sub and better define what kind of content should be posted in it. This is an on-going process that was started rather recently after hearing about the community's disapproval of some posts.  That being said, your definition of what nonononoyes is doesn't encompass the whole thing. It can be something that is seemingly going horribly wrong, but it doesn't have to be that dark. Also, we accept content that can have understandably yes ending even if it doesn't seem like it.  For example, you mention the truck hitting those people. The nononono is watching the truck leading up to the incident. The yes is knowing that there were no casualties (according to the description.)   The next gif of the car accident is, admittedly, in a grey area. It happens a bit too fast and some sources are unsure if there were two people in the car or not. Yet it can be seen as having a nononono as well as a yes at the end.  Sports may not be your thing but to many people sports are important and can have the same level of content as everything else that can be posted on the sub. Again, we aren't limited to almost watching people die in the sub.  I think we're better off being a more open place for people to post in. being constricted to everything grimdark puts a lot of people off from wanting to go to the sub. The diversity in it is part of what makes it so popular; many more people can enjoy the content. The idea, then, is to try and be a little more tolerant of the content that isn't specifically tailored to your likes so that other people can enjoy the sub as well.  I'm by no means trying to say you're wrong for not wanting to be in the sub anymore. Just trying to point out a different view for it."

I only got banned when I called the mod hypocrisy out, I was given a 5 day ban for abusing a troll who started it. I told the mods what I thought of the ban and now I doubt I'll ever be back there. They are more abusive than me and can get away with it because anyone who questions their behaviour will be removed. They are scum who abuse others when it suits them.   When I abused the right it was free reign, when I was critical of the mods stupid rules they found reason to ban me. How curious. One of them told me I threatened to murder them and when I asked what I said no one replied. They are liars or they would show me what I said.   I will get by without posting there but my situation could have been neutralised by a mod politely reminding me not to feed the trolls. They choose to be scum power trippers rather than putting out fires. At /r/toolband the mods don't get abused because we respect the community to sort itself out. I posted a mod abusing another redditor and the people at this sub 8 months after they said it and it magically disappeared that day, how curious. It does prove hypocrisy.  I have seen people here claim a banning for calling others twerp or having the word crumpet in their name. I see far worse at the AU sub all the time, they do have a clear bias and the sad thing is a new person to reddit will not see that, they will search Australia and not makesyoumoist.   There is no real solution as they have a countrys name and I only have a username. I got shadowbanned after I made a new account, unless a mod told an admin to look into it they wouldn't know.

Doesn't he need to inform you of how poorly you know yourself because surely you'll change your mind!  What is this logical and respectful reply?  How can he actually be understanding of you wanting different goals in life?  OP: I can hardly believe it myself!

That coupled with incredibly uninformed transfer discussions makes the transfer period hell. That's the issue when club football takes a break unfortunately.  Personally, I believe this is because of the globalisation of the sport. On reddit, Americans are particularly obvious because they make up the majority of the user base, but I've found that the majority of fans from countries that are not traditionally footballing nations (eg, most of the world that isn't Europe or South America) are pretty uninformed about the sport. They are usually pulled in through social media and as such have a strong connection to it, hence why so many posts on club subs are instagram posts and the like.  I want to stress that this isn't all foreign fans because I know many dedicated, knowledgeable foreign fans on reddit from America, Canada and across Asia, but the majority ruins their name."
JustUnsubbed,3b6gck,RomanAbramovich,2,Fri Jun 26 16:29:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that the whole transfer rumour thing is going to bring down the quality of most football subs, but that didn't play a big part in me ubsubbing.

One of the most upvoted responses to the mod comment is a fairly pointed question that cannot possibly be described as pro Monsanto.   Field level doses of glyphosate have been shown to have negative effects on nectar-reward behavior in bees. Though GMO's have not been shown to have any direct affect on bees, the chemicals they encourage use of do. Does your research into GMO's take a systems level approach to these chemicals' use and, if so, how?   The point here is that it's a clear, scientific question, and even has a link to a peer-reviewed source. That's the standard that's being enforced.  Several other questions are addressed toward the safety and long-term impact of GMOs, and they're allowed and upvoted because they're coherent and scientific rather than just being knee-jerk hysteria.  http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3b54ex/tomorrows_ama_with_fred_perlak_of_monsanto_some/csj27u3  http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3b54ex/tomorrows_ama_with_fred_perlak_of_monsanto_some/csj0qoy  Are you lying or did you just decline to actually read any of the comments?"

I gave my points on how they could be useful in the game and how they can be made of scrap, which is all over the game. The only valid point that they had was that it was not lore friendly. Being outstripped by guns is a myth, being ineffective is a myth, and then the people started being rude, and I called them out, but I was the one that got dumped with downvotes.

And a few days ago there was a photo of pierced nipples poking through a shirt with a caption like ""For people stiill on the fence about getting a nipple;piercing, here's how awesome mine look"".  They do give maintainance advice, but most people just say ""It wasn't that bad, if you want to you should go for it"". Also, every nipple piercing thread is full of comments like ""Omg how awesome. I love my nipple piercing."""

And the expectation that everyone should love kids and want to be around them and that you're a terrible person if not, yadda yadda yadda. It's bullshit. People make choices. It happens.  That being said, that place seems to be a cesspool, for the most part. I agree that there are decent people there. But yeah, an overwhelming amount of jerks.

Just a personal decision I made myself. But holy shit these guys really just hate children to the point of being glad when they are hurt or killed and hate anyone who chooses to have children. Also because I chose to live child free doesn't mean I want to go around fucking bragging about it and acting like it's a big fucking deal.
JustUnsubbed,3a88nq,AusOffroader,2,Thu Jun 18 06:33:51 2015 UTC,I used to frequent that subreddit under a different username. I'm pretty sure that I will never have kids but would still label myself a fence sitter. I happened to mention this to them and they about crucified me. I got a lot cruel messages calling me a breeder.   If you're still looking for a child free community to belong to there are a couple of subreddits you could try: /r/truechildfree and /r/kidfree. I don't think they're quite as active but you might find some friends there.

Why would someone who discovered the MLP fandom (which to begin with, is a very strange concept for most unfamiliar people) in this way not think poorly of the group? It's the people who show up in that subreddit, not the ones who can keep to themselves and not make a huge deal out of it, that ultimately end up representing the group.

JustUnsubbed,39qebg,thegamesurvivor,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:27:27 2015 UTC,I took guitar lessons from when I was 7 to when I was 13. My guitar teacher only ever taught me chords and upon entering high school I discovered everyone else who could play guitar actually sounded good because they knew how to strum in different ways and how to pick the strings. I could only move my left hand into different shapes.   :( maybe I'll go sub over there and befriend some other misguided guitarists.

JustUnsubbed,39nafa,mocha__,3,Sun Jun 14 11:09:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not an MRA and I can see how men aren't taken as seriously when it comes to domestic violence and rape. No one is saying it is an issue faced only by men, but men are a lot less likely to not be believed. There are even people who believe it is actually impossible to rape a man.  As for the draft, it is an issue faced only by men as women are not drafted.  I don't like a lot of MRAs either, but ignoring that there are some actual issues out there when it comes to things like this isn't being equal on either side."

JustUnsubbed,39k7vz,Demolishing,3,Fri Jun 12 14:13:22 2015 UTC,"/r/AskWomen can get kind of annoying, because a lot of insecure guys drift in and post shit like ""Do you think a guy is attractive even if _?"" and if you answer saying you don't think _ is attractive, they will basically just argue that you're wrong.
