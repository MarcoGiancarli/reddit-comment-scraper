paradoxpolitics,39qjao,starlightshimmers,5,Fri Jun 26 18:50:38 2015 UTC,"My background is Filipino and I'm very passionate about Philippine history. All I can say is that the islands in the South China Sea has been used since ancient times as transit islands for trade and transportation by the Malaysians, Indonesians and the Filipinos. Manila itself was part of the Bruneian Empire which stretched from Manila to Borneo. At various periods of time the Philippines was part of the Sri Vijaya and Majapahit Empires centred around Sumatra and Borneo. From a historical perspective, no one has owned those islands, it has always been considered a neutral transit area. In Tagalog there's even a word referring to the sea currents in the South China Sea, it's called ""habagat"" and it literally means ""winds from the south-west sea"" and ancient Filipino people used that as a method of determining when to sail between Borneo and the Philippine islands. Just my opinion, that area should be declared as neutral. If not neutral, I think it should be split between Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, these three countries have strong ancient ties to that area. Malay peoples are boat people and my ancestors sailed around those islands since ancient times, in fact there still boat people in the region, they're called Bajau people and routinely sail between Borneo and the Philippines."
