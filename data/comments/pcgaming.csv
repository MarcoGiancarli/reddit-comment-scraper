There's no difference under copyright law whether they're being compensated, except as to one fair use factor and there's no way a mod like this is going to be considered fair use.

pcgaming,3e32d0,cdt59,18,Tue Jul 21 17:32:18 2015 UTC,KOTOR blew my mind. Number 2 left me super disappointed.

pcgaming,3e32d0,mdchemey,9,Tue Jul 21 18:14:03 2015 UTC,I can see that.  I think 2's story got a little off the wall for some.  I loved both of them so I really have no complaints with either.  I'm hoping some awesome things come out of this update though.
pcgaming,3e32d0,cdt59,7,Tue Jul 21 18:36:07 2015 UTC,"The big thing is that 2's story feels horribly stunted and without reason or emotional support, especially near the end. Because they cut nearly half the story content near the end. TSLRCM brings a LOT of it back and really makes the story as cohesive and fulfilling as the first (imo) while actually increasing its sense of dark morality that makes the atmosphere so great, AND it fixes a thousand bugs, many of which had been introduced because they abruptly chopped huge chunks of the story out mere weeks before it was released. If you haven't played through with TSLRCM I would do so now."
pcgaming,3e32d0,SegataSanshiro,5,Tue Jul 21 18:58:53 2015 UTC,I need to.  I haven't played kotor 1 or 2 since I was in high school 10 years ago when they first came out.  this is making me want to re play through them.  I'm one of those 100% completionists though.  So I played the hell out of those games.  It's probably been long enough where I've forgotten everything and would still have fun lol

pcgaming,3e32d0,mdchemey,3,Tue Jul 21 17:58:29 2015 UTC,...with a terrible ending that was rushed through production. The sole flaw with the game.
pcgaming,3e32d0,bagehis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:09 2015 UTC,Only terrible if you don't use TSLRCM. Brings back all the crucial story pieces and returns the emotional impact of the game to its intended glory.
pcgaming,3e32d0,sample_material,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:00:27 2015 UTC,"I think some of the dislike comes from the story of Revan being dropped in the second one.  Additionally, the story feels like a rehash of the story in KOTOR1 to some extent, which is disappointing."

pcgaming,3e32d0,Cyryus,7,Tue Jul 21 16:28:02 2015 UTC,First one never had an issue for most people other than widescreen support.
pcgaming,3e32d0,readher,3,Tue Jul 21 16:29:21 2015 UTC,"Well I believe the higher res, steam cloud save games, and native controller support makes a huge difference as well which KOTOR1 is missing."
pcgaming,3e32d0,bloodstainer,7,Tue Jul 21 17:15:27 2015 UTC,I only had to delete intro movies since they prevented the game from starting. Other than that and no widescreen support not a single problem.
pcgaming,3e32d0,Drudicta,6,Tue Jul 21 16:52:26 2015 UTC,"Not true at all mate, its buggy as shit, some people can't even play the steam version without insane framerate stuttering or crashes."

pcgaming,3e32d0,jschild,8,Tue Jul 21 17:16:48 2015 UTC,That's a fucking stupid comparison. You're basically comparing a Havok & Unreal game with Kotor which runs on the old Odyssey engine.
pcgaming,3e32d0,bloodstainer,5,Tue Jul 21 17:20:28 2015 UTC,"Really, I'm comparing games people often complain on this subreddit as one's that ""don't work"" with Windows 8 and 8.1 yet they do."

pcgaming,3e32d0,BLToaster,8,Tue Jul 21 18:02:23 2015 UTC,Nope. I tried replaying KOTOR 1 like 6 months back and couldn't finish the game. At the start of the Star Forge the game bugged and I couldn't progress. None of my saves would let me get past this one CTD about 10 mins into the Forge.

I was really into witcher 3, wanted to play xcom ew long war, pillars again(when the xpac releases), wasteland 2 (once the new version comes out), and shadowrun dragon fall. Now I guess that's all on hold for a game I've played 4 times through already...  Favorite game of all time, even over KOTOR 1 which is absolutely necessary to play first. Highly recommend them both."
pcgaming,3e32d0,bloodstainer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:14 2015 UTC,I'm right with you man. I was about to start up ESO since I just got out for 12 dollars from GmG and I'm working my way through Witcher 3 as well but now I just have to replay one of my favorite games of all time in 4K with the lost content mod.
pcgaming,3e32d0,SegataSanshiro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:18:32 2015 UTC,I was most excited about the mod support. Didn't even think about playing on my new 1440p monitor with a 360 controller.

pcgaming,3e32d0,Asmor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:04:13 2015 UTC,I hope that the GOG version also gets a similar update. Would love native widescreen support for it.

But thinking about it, a lot of this mod seems to be so dependent upon Steam (cloud saves, SteamPlay, workshop) that I am a little skeptical.  MIGHT get the widescreen and controller support at most."
pcgaming,3e32d0,DeerMan420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:38 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with that, honestly. Cloud saves I'm sure can come when GOG implements it into Galaxy, and as for modding, most KOTOR mods are external installations that you just drop into the override folder. Workshop isn't exactly a selling point to me (yet). Widescreen is the big draw for me.  But you might be right. Who knows? I can hope :P"
pcgaming,3e32d0,TheMastodan,2,Tue Jul 21 17:03:46 2015 UTC,"Is this via Steam only? Wow.. this really is a kick in the guts to GOG, I bought the GOG-version because it used to be so much better.

pcgaming,3e32d0,beardedchimp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:22 2015 UTC,"It was very good.  It didn't really feel as 'special' at the time, because it was really just kinda... more KotoR.  Which isn't bad, I had just burned out on it by the time the second game came out.  But I've beat KotoR 4-5 times, and KotoR II only once, and it was a fast, hard burn.  No side quests or anything.  So I might give it another go."
pcgaming,3e32d0,DukeMikeIII,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:53:45 2015 UTC,"I think that KotOR2 improves on the original in nearly every way. It's such a shame that the end was such hot garbage. The last 2 or 3 hours are awful.  The preceding 20 or 30 are divine, though."
pcgaming,3e32d0,Chouonsoku,2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:50 2015 UTC,"I think that it was mostly a step backwards. Rushed quests led to conclusions that were all over the place, planets were boring and had less to do, weaker characters, and so much more. It pains me to see how rushed they were by Lucasarts. I did enjoy improvements made to the gameplay and UI and the game still has some great stuff but not as much as the original IMO. I really have a love/hate relationship with this game. I already played it with the mod but nice to see they are bringing new features as well to the steam release."

pcgaming,3e32d0,fauxdragoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:14 2015 UTC,"I love disagreements!  I think that a lot of things in the original game were dumb. The economy was absolutely broken, and this suspension of disbelief that almost everyone on your crew knows who you are is terrible. Malak was also a terrible villain.  My biggest gripe in 2, aside from that last 10%, is that almost everyone can become Jedi. That was pretty lame.  I was also like, 16 the last time I played this game. Really looking forward to playing it again. Sincerely hoping for at least the controller support to make it to KotOR PC."
pcgaming,3e32d0,kendirect,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:03 2015 UTC,I'm sure modders will find a way for gamepad support since they both run on the same engine. I think some mods from kotor 1 worked on kotor 2 as well. I can also understand your complaints but I did like Malak more than Sion and Nihilus. I'm not saying the game is bad its just I think the first one was a more well rounded game thanks to having like a 3 year dev cycle compared to Obsidian's less than a year.
pcgaming,3e32d0,UrinalDook,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:39:32 2015 UTC,"What helped with Sion and Nihilus was that they weren't like, the bad guy.  Looking forward to playing them both again, honestly"

I bought it at release, and the entire time I was playing I was thinking this could be the best RPG I have ever played.....  until I also got to the last 2-3 hours. I also only played it once and the first KOTOR a bunch of times. So burned by that ending, I never picked it up again.  Now is a good time!"

Yes, let's all complain because companies are closing up major known security holes in products they actively support in a very timely manner. How dare they.  I feel like if your typical user actually tried to understand the scope and burden of product support and exactly what the updates were doing, they'd be fine with them even if it makes them(heaven forbid) reboot their computers.

The front of the controller gives you temperature and RPM readouts so you can adjust the fan RPMs to give you a nice balance of noise vs. temps.

pcgaming,3e09sy,Leknasant,5,Tue Jul 21 11:02:01 2015 UTC,Why is this news?  Why are people so against windows updates?
pcgaming,3e09sy,scotty1987,3,Tue Jul 21 13:14:29 2015 UTC,Because they don't switch their pc's off and a massive load of updates have to install when they eventually do. Might be to do with drivers as well but you can set it not to install driver updates and do it manually.  I have no problem with installing them in the background and manually restarting at a later time.  Apple have auto updates running on macs and people don't moan.

I can't find any reference to needing a totally up to date 7/8.1 installation in order to upgrade, or what the point in that would be.

For the health of the PC gaming community AMD needs to not die!"
pcgaming,3dxq56,Django117,317,Mon Jul 20 13:19:59 2015 UTC,"Intel is not really innovating in the CPU space though; they're already two die sizes smaller than AMD and have been using independent L2 cache dedication for their cores for four years.  The last time there was a technological discrepency this large was when AMD was pressing Athlons and Intel was trying to force Rambus and Netburst technology into the desktop space, and the only reason why Intel was able to catch up was that AMD ran out of money and couldn't allocate resources to R&D because they had too much cash tied up in fabrication facilities.  And even then, Intel had to backtrack and develop new CPUs off the Pentium 3 architecture and build it out from the mobile computing tech space before they managed to take back the performance lead.    The closest parallel that exists now is in mobile devices, but despite the fact that Intel's presence in the mobile device space is comparatively diminutive, AMD's no better off right now either and doesn't have the bankroll to really establish a presence to build up from.  Frankly, I don't see an out here for AMD that would bring them up to a competitive level in comparison to Intel.  They seem doomed to budget computing as their only means to existence for the forseeable future.  EDIT: Thanks for the gold kind stranger!"

Intel's been able to make decent IPC improvements year over year.   With that being said, Intel's focus right now is on mobile. They aren't too focused on the consumer PC market. Even their Xeon line has been a bit stagnant without significant improvements other than maybe the Xeon E7s with RAS features aimed at competing with IBM/RISC servers as the profit margins in this space is HUGE."

The improvements Intel has mostly been making is based toward that.  The desktop will stagnate from now on and more and more stuff is done on servers.  Even performance heavy tasks like CAD, video editing, and gaming will shift to servers.  While the desktop isn't dead, its not going to grow."

pcgaming,3dxq56,HaroldSax,13,Mon Jul 20 19:19:47 2015 UTC,"Desktop has been stagnating for as long as it has because Intel's backed into a technological corner.  They can't make their CPUs operate faster than they already do, they've reached the practical limit of what can be done on silicon.  If you think they're purposefully stagnating, you need to have a look at their product release schedule.  They were forced to delay Broadwell for so long due to manufacturing issues that now it's only launching in volume a matter of months before Skylake is due.  They've also announced that they're going to have three generations at the current process level instead of the typical two; in other words, Moore's Law is over.  They could release CPUs with more cores, but what would that accomplish?  Have a look at how ""just add more cores!"" is treating AMD.  In games you've got one or two cores maxed out with the the rest idle or close to it.  If DX12/Vulkan make multithreaded game programming a practical reality, Intel will start producing 8+ core CPUs for gamers.  The only thing that's going to create a big shift in single-threaded performance is moving to a material besides silicon.  CPU and fab companies around the world throwing billions of dollars at the problem.  The first one that manages to produce chips at scale on a better substrate will gain a huge market advantage, and Intel knows this."

Now im not saying that they aren't better but AMD do have some nice GPUs out there but not so much on their CPU side anymore.  Back in the day I never went Intel, always stayed AMD because AMD really took on Goliath and had some winning blows.

I always stuck with amd due to their reliability for even medium to low range products, I don't know how much that still holds up though. Never had an amd cpu or gpu fail on me, although I have had an nvidea card and intel cpus shit the bed.   For example, my 6870's fan got stuck and stopped working for a few months a year or two ago. I didn't realize it for a long time until I looked into why it would occasionally glitch out or shut down while gaming, and i also realized it was strange that my pc was a lot more quiet while gaming recently. Well, I downloaded a temp monitor program and it turns that when playing games, the gpu would be running at ~100 degrees c, sometimes even higher. As in, hot enough to boil water. for months it ran this hot while gaming, which was usually a few hours every day. I fixed the fan and the card is still working fine"

Both AMD and nVidia are operating with essentially the same (hardware) R&D limitations, so hardware-performance-wise the two companies will always be close to neck and neck, assuming one doesn't fall behind.   A business model that relies on your competition making a mistake is not a safe business model. It's why nVidia's insistence on improving the software side of things with graphical improvements in what might be called nVidiaXGL (or DirectX+, or OpenGL+, or GameWorks) is what continues to give them the market advantage.   At this point I'm not even sure AMD can recover, as their previous attempt at meeting nVidia on this same battleground (TressFX) had a nVidia response before many games even started to utilize the AMD option."

pcgaming,3dxq56,Polymarchos,21,Mon Jul 20 17:02:15 2015 UTC,"I love this argument.   Let me tell you 2 things.   PCs ""innovation"" died the moment PS3/X360 were born. All the brand new AAA games that you see coming out that are actually innovative and forward looking are mostly PC based yes but the majority of gaming revenue is not coming from these people. It's coming from GTA 5, Assassin Creed and all these sequels they just keep churning up. From Street Fighter 5 to Call of Duty, Battlefield, Assasins Creed, Racing games, sports games it's mostly sequel after sequel with reused assets everywhere and little to no real innovation.  Think about it what were the graphically impressive games of their generation.   Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, Quake 2, Half Life, Quake 3, Unreal Tournament, Half Life 2 and then finally Crysis came. It was 2007 X360 was a year old and the PS3 just came out.   After that DEAD SILENCE from western developers. Crysis was the least truly graphical spectacle.   What happened then? Whats the next memorable boundary pushing game you remember? Skyrim, CNC4, Starcraft 2, Diablo 3, Battlefield Bad Company 2, Call of Duty 4 to god know what number, Assassins creed ? Nope none of these games required anything more then a 1000$ ""Crysis"" machine from 2008. A game that didn't was Metro 2033 or Battlefield 3. After that? Well it was a LONG TIME after that between 2007 and 2013 only Metro 2033 and Battlefield 3 came out that really pushed boundaries. Everything else was basically stuck because of consoles. Because everything need to be multi-plat and you can't push boundaries. I remember back in the day oh snap quake 2 NEW PC, Quake 3 NEW PC, Half Life 2 NEW PC, Crysis NEW PC. And after that... nothing. Only now that Witcher 3 came out do I feel the need to buy a new PC I've been on a Core 2 Duo E6700 with a 8800 GTS and then 460 GTX for what 8 years now? Now I'm waiting for guess what, Skylake. Zen is too far away and I have long ago lost interest in AMDs CPUs. Their GPUs are damn fine and they basically need to resurrect ATI to compete with Nvidia again.   Now the second thing. Look at the mobile market. Theres only one single player there. There no ATI or Nvidia no AMD or INTEL. Non of these big player and big in mobile. They're small players.  It's ARM on the top. With Nvidia SoC Tegra using ARM CPUs and Intel with it's Atoms trying to push in but let's face it 95% of it is ARM and it's Mali GPU. And they're on top in both technology and market share.  Is mobile dying? Is it developing ""too slowly"" NOPE.   Now let's see on today. Intel is having trouble with CPUs since 2 generations ago pushing limits slowly. It's right now in a monopoly position and so far ahead of AMD that it doesn't even need to try. It hasn't tried for a long time now. AMD since basically i5-2500K (Sandy Bridge architecture) had literally nothing to compete with Intel at that tier. Sure Zen might be good but I doubt it give the track record.   The next trully new CPU won't come until 2017 and honestly CPU are long gone when it comes to games. An average i5 or 8350 will run anything just fine.  It's all about GPUs now and I'm pretty sure AMD or whatever comes out of it when someone buys the GPU division will keep on going because thats were the true moore law continues now."

Also VR will push hardware requirements. Requiring constant 90+FPS as well as a higher resolution to look smooth at least requires more powerful GPUs.  CPUs are a different story.

Not only is there a ton of room for huge gains with relatively small investment in mobile architectures but phones haven't reached the commodity status of PCs where no one will care to upgrade them for half a decade. Once that happens the focus will shift from performance to whatever market needs to be penetrated next, just like Intel is doing with their recent architectures."
pcgaming,3dxq56,known0thing,2,Mon Jul 20 20:29:31 2015 UTC,"Now the second thing. Look at the mobile market. Theres only one single player there. There no ATI or Nvidia no AMD or INTEL. Non of these big player and big in mobile. They're small players.  It's ARM on the top. With Nvidia SoC Tegra using ARM CPUs and Intel with it's Atoms trying to push in but let's face it 95% of it is ARM and it's Mali GPU. And they're on top in both technology and market share.  Is mobile dying? Is it developing ""too slowly"" NOPE.   There's so much wrong here. First of all, ARM doesn't make anything. All of the big players license ARM technology in some form or another, but nobody is pumping out reference ARM chips. Apple, Qualcomm, MediaTek, Samsung are all pretty substantial players. Smaller companies like Allwiner and Spreadtrum are making inroads thanks huge growth in price sensitive markets like China. Mali cores aren't in anywhere near 95% of mobile GPUs. Apple uses Imagination Technologies PowerVR cores, and Qualcomm uses their own Adreno cores (actually based on technology from ATi from before the AMD buyout.) Qualcomm and Apple alone account for over 50% of the market!  Compared to the CPU market there is a ton of competition in mobile! Intel still has huge future potential, but most of us who have been watching how they have played things so far are not particularly hopeful. Continued fab process delays mean they can't just tick tock their way to victory on process advantage alone, they are going to have to actually compete on performance and price(!) to get design wins. They can't keep giving away their chips forever."
pcgaming,3dxq56,whywhywhywhywhynot,2,Mon Jul 20 22:28:35 2015 UTC,While you are right on many of these accounts. AMD never had any fabs of it's own and thats one of the reasons they're behind intel who is also a fab owner. While AMD had stock in GlobalFounderies.
pcgaming,3dxq56,MewKazami,2,Tue Jul 21 00:14:47 2015 UTC,"The thing is, people ignore AMD's top graphics cards and look at midrange only. The top graphics card for the current family hasn't even been released yet and the Fury X is already shitting on NVidia's performance."

Now while people keep insisting AMD drivers are bad, I'm having huge problem lately with my 460 GTX and running firefox especially youtube were the driver crashes are reloads. This is painful since i play Dota 2 and FFXIV where matches last long and drops mean lost games. Since the driver reloads and the game freezes in place."

I think they'd still keep pushing forward because if they don't then theres no reason for people to buy their stuff. I'll just keep my 560Ti and i7 if nothing bigger better and affordable is coming.   They'd also be pressured by the industries which rely on them and visa versa for tech progression. Industries such as games, film and fabrication where everything is designed on a computer or needs evolving processing power will push for progression.   Did Intel and Nvidia ever really see AMD or ATI as serious competition? They each had their markets and were always going to massive demand and customers."

pcgaming,3dxq56,SunSage,5,Mon Jul 20 16:16:05 2015 UTC,"You are correct. Opting for a competitor or not buying a processor at all is pretty much the same thing for Intel. Some things would be different though should AMD get bancrupt. AMDs own innovations such as X86-64 and the threat of lost market shares are two areas that push innovation. ARM will continue to be competitive though, especially for markets focused at performance per watt such as servers and battery powered units. The only really ""safe"" markets for Intel is desktop computers/PC gaming and workstations."

You just can't compete against a company whose R&D budget is ten times your entire revenue and who can afford to pay you to avoid lawsuits."
pcgaming,3dxq56,DMZ_Dragon,21,Mon Jul 20 15:18:46 2015 UTC,"But the fact that they're still around, and STILL competitive is amazing, is it not?

But when you look at it objectively, from both sides, the fact that AMD products are actually able to be compared, and decently close to intel/nvidia products, of the same or even higher price; that's purely amazing.  From what I've seen, they're actually making the most from semi-customs, embedded, and the like; basically anything a consumer can't out right buy."

What their hardware division does is very impressive, but not enough to keep AMD as it is afloat. ATI would thrive in this business."
pcgaming,3dxq56,DMZ_Dragon,3,Mon Jul 20 15:25:34 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree.  But, I'm not too sure on having ATi and AMD seperate would lead to good things, but then again, ATi would have free reign, and wouldn't have to be dragged down by a failing cpu sector...

pcgaming,3dxq56,Sam443,15,Mon Jul 20 14:46:15 2015 UTC,"Almost always. The only exceptions to the rule are found in the low budget area (let's say, anything up to 150 dollars), where AMD do offer some good CPUs for the price and Intel basically offer cut down, crippled versions of the flagship models that just don't perform as well as a purpose-built model."
pcgaming,3dxq56,MountCydonia,17,Mon Jul 20 16:09:24 2015 UTC,Depends on workloads but for most workloads yes because Intel had far superior single thread performance and no shared FPU.
pcgaming,3dxq56,andromeduck,38,Mon Jul 20 15:04:53 2015 UTC,"I've bought AMD CPUs for the much increased cost-to-performance. I'd only ever buy an Intel CPU if cost wasn't a factor.

pcgaming,3dxq56,Muffinut,57,Mon Jul 20 14:30:24 2015 UTC,"The problem is that AMD cpus don't have a good cost to performance factor.

pcgaming,3dxq56,Vaiels,34,Mon Jul 20 14:40:11 2015 UTC,"depends on the situation. I paid $90 for this A10-7850k and motherboard. There is literally no CPU from the intel camp I could buy with a motherboard for that price. I got this sale from microcenter and even their discounted intel CPU prices would have been $170+ for an i3 + motherboard.   In general you are correct that intel usually make more sense, but there are still situations that arise where AMD takes the price/performance crown."
pcgaming,3dxq56,Kaboose666,7,Mon Jul 20 15:59:29 2015 UTC,The only Intel mobo cpu bundle in the $100 or under range that I've seen rival that price is the g3258 which is cheaper combo but slightly less powerful and requires overclocking.
pcgaming,3dxq56,HooMu,8,Mon Jul 20 16:35:45 2015 UTC,"Or the G3260, but yeah they are also only dual core so while single threaded performance might be a bit better than the 7850K, the multi threaded performance would leave much to be desired. And the 7850k can overclock fairly easily as well, I have mine at 4.3Ghz"
pcgaming,3dxq56,Kaboose666,5,Mon Jul 20 16:39:59 2015 UTC,"That's a great deal on the combo, but you can buy an i3 with the same performance for a little less than the A10 currently.  http://cpuboss.com/cpus/Intel-Core-i3-4130-vs-AMD-A10-7850K"

The performance is just not what I'm looking for and currently, the only AMD product in my house is my wife's computer, which was an old Sempron 140 and now a Phenom something-something."

This 5-10 percent difference is in my opinion made up by them often costing almost half the price. I'm not sure what all the complaints are about? Does everyone only want the fastest of the fast regardless of cost? In my personal experience that small amount of performance difference isn't even noticeable in day to day usage, I've never encountered a game, or computer program that uses the entire cpu, the same can be said about the gpu."

As for the GPU, I just upgraded from an old Radeon 6950 1Gb to a GTX 970, as I got tired of the heat and noise of the Radeon. I have less problems buying AMD GPU's, as they're mostly on par with what Nvidia has to offer.   Which, actually I find the heat and noise to also be a problem with AMD CPU's. My wife's Phenom (Black X-II or something, I really can't remember what it is), is a noisy, heat blasting thing. I had to put an aftermarket CPU cooler on it just to quiet it down and get it to run a bit cooler; meanwhile, my i5 hums along just fine with its stock cooler, making little to no noise and heat seems minimal."

Or maybe AMD could spin off their non-GPU divisions instead and just embrace their GPU identity 100%. Whatever path forward, the current strategy is a disaster and I think everyone, including their apologists, recognise that.  Also, I'm not sure if Intel/Samsung buying them would make their GPUs all that much better. They'll be safer financially, yes, but also lost in a sea of a whole host of other priorities.

pcgaming,3dxq56,botched_rest_hold,2,Tue Jul 21 00:54:26 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't think anyone in this thread has lost billions of dollars over the last few years."
pcgaming,3dxq56,PooperSnooperPrime,3,Tue Jul 21 14:33:12 2015 UTC,"I know right?   Reddit pretending its not a bunch of Intel/Nvidia fanboys, but educated people who have a good understanding of a complex topic? Never! These arguments are really well supported, clearly defined, and provide thorough evidence of understanding the subject matter. /s"
pcgaming,3dxq56,blizzardveers,15,Tue Jul 21 02:14:38 2015 UTC,I'd argue that the AOL / Time Warner deal was worse.
pcgaming,3dxq56,random_digital,7,Mon Jul 20 15:52:30 2015 UTC,Verizon just bought AOL for $4.4 billion. Nearly 4 times what AMD is worth.
pcgaming,3dxq56,CFGX,101,Mon Jul 20 22:12:22 2015 UTC,AMD has to compete with two juggernauts using extremely anti-competitive tactics with only token resistance from the governments of the world. It's amazing they've lasted this long.
pcgaming,3dxq56,mingy,73,Mon Jul 20 13:50:20 2015 UTC,"Well, unfortunately, nobody forced AMD to blow their money on ATI, and bounce from pillar to post strategically. AMD has been mismanaged to death. You can't blame that on Intel or Nvidia."
pcgaming,3dxq56,aondw,32,Mon Jul 20 15:14:42 2015 UTC,I guess you can partially blame it  on Intel as the bribed Pc makers not to use Amd cpus. (at least that's what I remember of it)  I think this has impacted them quite a lot.
pcgaming,3dxq56,0Asterite0,16,Mon Jul 20 17:57:43 2015 UTC,It's in Intel's interest that AMD stay afloat to avoid a monopoly situation.
pcgaming,3dxq56,Gosh-Darnit,79,Mon Jul 20 14:47:26 2015 UTC,"Please don't go under, AMD. Pretty please. Intel and Nvidia need competition, especially Nvidia. Nvidia is all too happy to use anti-competitive and anti-consumer techniques to lock you into their hardware. If they get even a brief monopoly, we're fucked."
pcgaming,3dxq56,someguy50,12,Mon Jul 20 13:31:27 2015 UTC,"While I crave for 9700Pro era ATi greatness, I don't believe nVidia is the monster so many people claim them to be. They are kicking serious ass in the engineering front. Maxwell is just amazing, a serious improvement while on the same aging manufacturing node as their previous generation of products. NVidia is like any other company, looking to create value for their customers. Just because their tech (investments) isn't charitably open sourced doesn't make them anticompetitive or anti consumer. Or have I missed some other controversy?"
pcgaming,3dxq56,Gosh-Darnit,26,Mon Jul 20 13:42:47 2015 UTC,"Most of the controversy is with GSync and Gameworks.  GSync basically means your monitor is $200 more expensive, and only has adaptive sync with Nvidia cards. Whereas Freesync uses the Display port open standard (so it's not more expensive), and could be used by Nvidia if Nvidia didn't want you to spend money on GSync.  Gameworks means that Nvidia encourages developers to use their closed source rendering techniques (like Hairworks) that cannot be optimized for AMD cards. Whereas AMD uses TressFX (as the Hairworks comparison) which is source-available, so anyone can modify it or their code to work better with it. AMD also claims that Nvidia pressures developers to not optimize for AMD cards when using Gameworks, though this is more of an allegation than a fact."
pcgaming,3dxq56,AnotherNub,6,Mon Jul 20 15:22:42 2015 UTC,Who would be dumb enough to admit that they're sabotizing AMD cards performance deliberately?
pcgaming,3dxq56,BlueShellOP,5,Mon Jul 20 17:58:56 2015 UTC,"If the full force of the U.S. Government was bearing down on them, I bet some interesting secrets would come tumbling out."
pcgaming,3dxq56,TDuffin,2,Mon Jul 20 20:53:19 2015 UTC,"Well, until they bribe enough people in congress to stop bearing down on them. nVidia has a lot of money."
pcgaming,3dxq56,Kelmi,36,Mon Jul 20 23:42:07 2015 UTC,Their card disable themselves if there's AMD product on the PC. You forgot how people used to have a dedicated PhysX card?
pcgaming,3dxq56,beardedchimp,51,Mon Jul 20 14:25:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah they are anti-competitive and anti consumer. For instance there were features being used on their consumer cards for passing through pcie to virtual machines. These features were removed so as not to compete with their professional cards.  They create proprietary standards in a very microsoft esque way to control the market while AMD has been creating open standards.  AMD is moving towards having their open source driver as a first class citizen, created mantle then provided it as the basis of Vulkan. They have been implementing royalty free open standards such as FreeSync vs Nvidias proprietary G-Sync.  If AMD/ATI dies I have no doubt that NVIDIA will become complete bastards."
pcgaming,3dxq56,opeth10657,14,Mon Jul 20 13:51:10 2015 UTC,"FreeSync vs Nvidias proprietary G-Sync   There is quite a bit of difference between those though.  Ignoring the limitations for FreeSync, G-Sync has a hardware requirement, it's not just software like FreeSync"
pcgaming,3dxq56,wallgomez,29,Mon Jul 20 14:33:26 2015 UTC,"Yep, the problem is, Nvidia has the option to provide support for Freesync in their GPU's, but refuses to do so. However AMD is locked out of providing support for G-sync."
pcgaming,3dxq56,everyZig,12,Mon Jul 20 14:42:41 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, Nvidia currently has a market cap of 10.6 billion USD, which was on average 9.3 in 2006, while Intel has gone from 115 to 138 in the same period.  ATI apparently was around 4.2 back when the deal went down.  So AMD managed to combine and shrink both companies to 1/7th of what they were in 2006, yowza."
pcgaming,3dxq56,Oafah,9,Mon Jul 20 17:53:03 2015 UTC,"60% of AMDs revenue comes from embedded/enterprise/semi-custom products, and offers the lowest margin of loss among their major product divisions. Long story short, given their numbers from the last 2 years, it would seem more profitable for them to sever that particular dead limb than to dump more cash into saving it.  AMD obviously needs better products to survive, but given how poorly the desktop market is performing in general, I don't think catering to people like us is their primary motivation."
pcgaming,3dxq56,coolbeaNs92,14,Mon Jul 20 15:37:50 2015 UTC,"We need AMD to not die because Intel don't seem to understand that having a million different CPU sockets is annoying for consumers. Seriously, amazing processors Intel but God damn, maybe keep it to like 1 socket every year maybe?"
pcgaming,3dxq56,RippyZ,12,Mon Jul 20 18:28:14 2015 UTC,"They don't change the socket to screw you... The reason Intel has to change the socket is because the new CPUs require different I/O. If the CPU didn't have any other features besides being a CPU they could keep the same socket, but because Intel has moved a lot of the chipset features into the CPU itself they have to change the socket when they change the CPU.  I'm sure if Intel could keep the same socket it would be better for them. It's an R&D cost to develop a new socket and if it wasn't necessary they wouldn't do it."
pcgaming,3dxq56,Rot-Orkan,3,Mon Jul 20 21:39:21 2015 UTC,"I own some AMD stock, so I beg everyone to buy AMD CPUs/video cards.  They're less evil than Intel and NVIDIA, that's gotta count for something :)"
pcgaming,3dxq56,bigjohnny82,3,Tue Jul 21 11:26:53 2015 UTC,"Amd/ati graphics would be in a much better position if there weren't so many bandwagon hopping children who brought up how 15 years ago ati had driver issues, even though those children weren't even gaming then.  Seriously, the damage that uneducated kids on the net can cause for potential buyers is strong. I know many are adults and hipsters who just want to be part of a team... But why not one that knows what they are talking about?  It's lole when people say Mac is better for graphic design... That was nearly 30 years ago... It hasnt been since. Let it be. Move on."
pcgaming,3dxq56,h313,6,Tue Jul 21 14:17:58 2015 UTC,Plot twist: ATI buys AMD.
pcgaming,3dxq56,nawoanor,2,Mon Jul 20 23:47:42 2015 UTC,The Future is Fusion
pcgaming,3dxq56,PeregrineFury,2,Mon Jul 20 20:09:27 2015 UTC,I thought I had heard that Samsung might buy them out. Would that be a good thing that could save them? They've got a ton of capital and could really push the CPU/GPU market.
pcgaming,3dxq56,I_lurk_until_needed,11,Mon Jul 20 23:12:46 2015 UTC,"They bought a graphics card company and then completely failed to make any good business decisions regarding it. Don't get me wrong getting HBM to the market first and securing priority access to HBM2 is great.  Their processor and motherboard chipsets have fallen so far behind though. Look at companies like apple, they profit so ridculously because they made an ecosystem that people want to buy into.   AMD just has a bunch of products, some of which such as the fury or 390 are alright but a lot the products, processors and motherboards, are completely uncompetitive.  They have such a good set up for selling the customer an ecosystem of devices, THEY EVEN RELEASED FRICKING SSDs.  I am hopeful for Zen to be good, They seem to be pulling themselves out of the graphics card whole they have been (say what you want but nvidia won the war last year when comparing 200 series to 700 series and then 900 series but the 300 and fury series seem to have put AMD back in the race).  They need motherboards that offer current gen technology such as PCI-E 3.0 and ddr4 as well as increasing the amount of USB3.0 or type c.   As a buyer I currently have no reason to go for an all AMD setup. Intel has been increasing processor performance by 10 - 15% year on year because that is all they have to do."
pcgaming,3dxq56,1gnominious,19,Mon Jul 20 12:31:16 2015 UTC,"Getting PC users to buy into an ""ecosystem"" is a pipe dream.  We have options, the ability to mix/match, and people care a lot about price vs performance.  Nvidia and Intel are very competent technical competition and the only way to compete is to match them.  Apple isn't really competing against anybody.  They exist in their own bubble and have a following who will buy their product regardless of the competition.  AMD will never pull that off in the cost/performance obsessed PC community.  Either they put up a better fight or they die."
pcgaming,3dxq56,andromeduck,2,Mon Jul 20 13:45:36 2015 UTC,"Some would call that ""bubble"" an ecosystem."
pcgaming,3dxq56,spilurum,8,Mon Jul 20 15:26:10 2015 UTC,"My biggest complaint with AMD right now is their lineup is so convoluted.  I owe a friend of mine money, he's a console gamer that wants to get into PC gaming. I offered to build him a system and repayment for what I owe him. I've been looking at an all AMD build to cut costs... but I have no fucking clue what all of AMDs CPUs do. I can look at benchmarks, but their naming schemes make no sense to me. Intel? i3/i5/i7, that's an easy hierarchy to figure out, and all the numbers are obviously generational (3xxx, 4xxx, 5xxx). Even if I didn't know that i7s all support HyperThreading and have larger caches, I could see i5-4690 and i7-4770k listed and it would be intuitive enough that I could make a reasonable guess that the i7 is going to be faster.  AMD? Well, the A8 and A10 are clearly part of the same series, so I could assume the A10 is going to be faster... but wait, there's also the Athlon II, the FX series... there's also Athlon APUs... fuck. Which one is the best bang for the buck? Which one has the features I need? Well now I have to spend 3 hours reading benchmarks and reviews to figure out which AMD CPU is the best for my build. Oh yeah, and none of them are socket compatible with each other, so forget easy upgrading in the future.  As an enthusiast that's not much of an issue for me, but if I told my friend to give me a parts list for me to buy and build for him, he'd probably have no clue where to start."
pcgaming,3dxq56,abk006,9,Mon Jul 20 14:35:19 2015 UTC,"I could see i5-4690 and i7-4770k listed and it would be intuitive enough that I could make a reasonable guess that the i7 is going to be faster.   What about i5-2500 vs i3-4370?   AMD isn't that complicated; the problem is that you're comparing two naming generations (like Core 2 Duo vs Core i3). Right now: FX is the high-end, A(4-10) are APUs, and Athlon is low-end.   Oh yeah, and none of them are socket compatible with each other, so forget easy upgrading in the future.   Just like you can't upgrade your 2500k to a 4690k without a motherboard upgrade?"
pcgaming,3dxq56,I_lurk_until_needed,3,Mon Jul 20 15:14:40 2015 UTC,"wait, athlons back?"
pcgaming,3dxq56,spilurum,7,Mon Jul 20 14:49:04 2015 UTC,"Athlon APUs, they're low-budget low-TDP quad-cores. I actually built and HTPC for myself with an Athlon-5350 a couple months ago. Biggest advantage is the low TDP makes passive cooling in small form factors possible. Since I don't have a laptop it's become my main productivity PC, but it struggles with some high bitrate 1080p video. If I ever upgrade to a 4K media setup it will need to be replaced, but the entire system was ~$350 from start to finish, and it's totally silent."

pcgaming,3dxq56,kunstlich,16,Mon Jul 20 14:03:16 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing this, can you give reasons or point towards sources that develop the idea? Investing in a sinking ship seems like a silly idea from a laypersons outside perspective."
pcgaming,3dxq56,reddits_on_toilets,7,Mon Jul 20 14:52:07 2015 UTC,"Buy cheap, sell high.  A sinking ship's stock is cheap, if you buy AMD stock now, you'd hope that AMD turn it round and their stock price rises - you then sell and make money.  In layman's terms - it's betting on a horse that's lost all its last games, since the bookies place odds of it winning the race low, the payout will be huge if it wins.  So what I'm saying is betting on AMD is gambling that it will end it's losing streak and win."
pcgaming,3dxq56,mynewaccount5,16,Mon Jul 20 15:18:00 2015 UTC,You know how much a sunk ship is worth? $0.
pcgaming,3dxq56,FrozenIceman,7,Mon Jul 20 16:09:29 2015 UTC,"You know what sure bets are when you invest?  .01% interest in your bank account.  You know what inflation is in the US?  About 2% over the last 10 years.  The greater the risk the greater return, the lower the risk the less return.  AMD appears to have hope right now, it has several key strategic positions in their CPU and Graphics line that indicate that all is not lost."
pcgaming,3dxq56,FrozenIceman,3,Mon Jul 20 18:17:14 2015 UTC,"Because its competition has a vested interest in keeping it alive.  If AMD goes down then Intel will be the only company in the market.  Due to the high cost for development of such technologies competition would be scarce.  Which means they may be targets for Anti-Trust laws.  So for now Intel will do what it always has over the last decade and basically give AMD money to not die.  So as far as a sinking ship goes, it is a sinking ship, but someone has stapled a crap load of life preservers to it so it may not go under."
pcgaming,3dxq56,ExogenBreach,32,Mon Jul 20 18:14:41 2015 UTC,Buying cheap tickets to a sinking ship?
pcgaming,3dxq56,afdafbavf,6,Mon Jul 20 14:06:47 2015 UTC,People said that when it was $5 2 years ago. They said that when it was $10 4 years ago. And people will say that when it is $0.85 two years from now.
pcgaming,3dxq56,Titus142,4,Mon Jul 20 17:21:50 2015 UTC,"I used to use AMD CPU's back in the Athlon days. But they just can't keep up now. I am really glad NVidia has some competition and I really hope they keep the pressure on. I would hate to see the GPU market dominated (even more than it is now) by one company. That said, I have never been happy with an AMD card. Every time I have used one it just did not perform the way I wanted it to. I really hope one day that will change for me and I will have to do some serious comparison shopping. Competition is good, keeps innovation up and prices down. There needs to be more."
pcgaming,3dxq56,Rylock,29,Mon Jul 20 13:38:41 2015 UTC,When did you use an AMD card last? I have some people at work that absolutely loathe ATI/AMD cards and say they run like chit and always fail. I ask them when they used one last and it's in the mid-2000s.   I tell them my last 3 AMD cards have worked great without so much as a single issue and they don't even believe me. Some people really hold a grudge.
pcgaming,3dxq56,thepulloutmethod,18,Mon Jul 20 13:56:20 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, I bought an HD5770 in 2010 and upgraded to a R9 290 last November and I've had zero driver issues.   And I'm not a fanboy either, both of those purchases were the best price/performance at the time. I have no regrets siding with AMD all this time."
pcgaming,3dxq56,PARTY-PETE,10,Mon Jul 20 14:19:55 2015 UTC,290 user here. I love this card so much. I can't believe how much power you get for just a little over $200

Steam doesn't have a lot of what GOG has, though, either.  So if you really like games on PC, you'll probably end up using both."
pcgaming,3e2z32,PillowTalk420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If you boil them both down to their most basic form, then yeah, they're both digital distribution platforms for games. But GOG's purpose was to bring older games back to life, and they've not done a good job at branching out from that. Until it does, it's not even close to being an alternative to Steam."
pcgaming,3e2z32,iKnowJajko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:11:03 2015 UTC,"It's worth mentioning that GOG is wholly owned by CD Project, the same team behind the Witcher series.   While we may have seen some visual downgrades for The Witcher 3, their team of ~230 members is very passionate about the PC gaming community.   Their deeply rooted passion will only push other companies to try harder so it's nice to see some competition in this space."
pcgaming,3e2z32,3lfk1ng,-3,Tue Jul 21 16:12:47 2015 UTC,"No, just, no. Galaxy is NOT an alternative. Galaxy can't compete with Steam."

Believe it or not Steam started as a baby as well. Galaxy is going to need a couple years to become competitive in any real way. I'm already buying all my games from GoG whenever possible though. No DRM beats DRM any day. Even if that DRM is Steamworks."
pcgaming,3e2z32,Descatusat,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:44:41 2015 UTC,"No DRM beats DRM anyday   Depends on the person. DRM like Uplay? Sure. Steam works, no. But we all have our opinions."
pcgaming,3e2z32,The_Web_Doctor,3,Tue Jul 21 16:55:30 2015 UTC,"Well, DRM free means I own my game. Steamworks means I'm leasing my game. I want to truly own what I pay for personally. But I still try to get all my games physical before I even consider buying digitally, so I'm definitely in the minority."
pcgaming,3e2z32,Descatusat,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:02:06 2015 UTC,"You're right, you do own your games on GOG because it doesn't require a program to start it. With Steam works you need Steam and in the VERY unlikely event that Valve does go down there's a chance you'll lose your games. Despite all of that I still like Steam works better."
pcgaming,3e2z32,The_Web_Doctor,2,Tue Jul 21 17:09:16 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. As you said, we all have our opinions. Yours is certainly as valid as mine. There are tons of games on Steam that don't use Steamworks though. So you'd still have them in that unlikely event."

pcgaming,3e0il1,helakion,4,Tue Jul 21 00:44:21 2015 UTC,"The videos I've seen have been very enticing, even the boring ones   The thought of having huge maps with huge head counts with realistic physics and weaponry, paired with supply lines and true strategy is very exciting.  The strategy is what Im looking most forward to.  I love FPS multiplayer games, but many of the games I have played devolve into specific squeeze points on the map for exploitation.  I'm talking about pubs as I haven't played comp since MoH:AA, but once you figure out those spots and ways to manipulate opponent behavior and how to exploit certain chokepoints, the fun starts running out.  Different game modes help to vary how and why these areas develop, but the vast map size and head count paired with the realism they're infusing is very exciting."

Greatly looking forward to it.  Next time Arma hits a sale I intend on picking it up and I can't wait for Squad to become available to me, which I think is whenever alpha begins - I got the $30 kickstarter package, which was my first kickstarter contribution as well."
pcgaming,3e0il1,RueKing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:25:15 2015 UTC,"Arma3 has all the components of a great game, but the performance kills it.  100 man PvP servers results in 20-30 fps no matter what your settings are.  This is apparently because performance is determined by the server."
pcgaming,3e0il1,Amerikaner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:28 2015 UTC,"You're right, but it also depends on how well the creator of the mission file scripted the mission. Some variations do run incredibly well, but you're probably talking about KOTH."

pcgaming,3e0il1,XIII1987,5,Tue Jul 21 07:14:46 2015 UTC,I like the idea of Arma 3 but not the implementation. It is buggy as hell and the learning curve is quite large. Squad seems more accessible while still retaining some 'realistic' traits similar to Arma 3.   I don't want a simulation - I want a semi-realistic large(er) scale war game.
pcgaming,3e0il1,time4mzl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:12:09 2015 UTC,"Fair point, i always consider arma a niche product myself as its not for everyone's tastes and is indeed a combat simulator. The only other one i can suggest is insurgency. Not as big maps but its quite tactical."

I just want the Graphics/textures  to more high quality ( ^ _ ^ )"

pcgaming,3dywzb,thelordpresident,21,Tue Jul 21 02:17:25 2015 UTC,"It's most likely about the power (cpu+memory). To emulate a console you basically need to have what's in the original device plus resources needed to translate between PC and console instructions plus more resources for the game itself.  Basically any older device has been successfully emulated on PC, because of their age they don's need much and pretty much any computer can run it. Because of the differences between PC and PS3/X360 in both hardware and software it's not easy to create an emulator which will not only work but allow for playing games with decent fps. Even PS2 emulator is still not as good as PSX one.  Here you can find the best explanation of why it's so difficult I've ever seen: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1ifaix/current_generation_console_emulation_why_is_it/cb47bol  This might be just a wishful thinking but I believe it might be easier to emulate PS4/XO because they are basically PCs."

The N64 for example is some super custom SGI graphics chip and other stuff but the Gamecube (and the Wii by extension) is a common as fuck single core IBM PowerPC RISC chip.  The PS3 (and the PS2 for before it) is more like an N64, it has some ridiculously custom over engineered multi core chip that games producers even had trouble making games for; now imagine trying to emulate that hardware accurately.  It's why the current gen PS4 is basically a glorified laptop with common PC architecture, so it's cheap and easy to develop games for.

pcgaming,3dxbe8,Leknasant,4,Tue Jul 21 01:40:28 2015 UTC,"But multiple m+k? How do they process the inputs?   Easily. Good programmers know what they are doing.  It's the same way a computer can discern two different joystick controllers, or different Xbox 360 controllers, or gamepads.  As you can play local Mortal Kombat with your friend.  The game also plays a hand and would setup the two different controllers for the two-player characters.  This is not a miracle of science, they just rather have online play only.  It's been done before.  Edit:  Why does everyone have a hard on for the down vote button in this sub?"
pcgaming,3dxbe8,grumbel,19,Mon Jul 20 12:12:31 2015 UTC,"It's the same way a computer can discern two different joystick controllers, or different Xbox 360 controllers, or gamepads.   Well, no, it's actually not the same. Most APIs assume that there is only one mouse and one keyboard and provide no way of handling two or more keyboards. All the events coming from them will merge and appear coming from a single keyboard. Gamepads and joysticks in contrast have API that handle. Real world example with SDL2:  Uint32 SDL_GetMouseState(int* x, int* y) const Uint8* SDL_GetKeyboardState(int* numkeys) Sint16 SDL_JoystickGetAxis(SDL_Joystick* joystick, int axis)   See the difference? The joystick call allows you to specify which joystick it is, the keyboard and mouse calls assume there is only a single one. Or take XInput:  DWORD XInputGetState(_In_  DWORD dwUserIndex, _Out_ XINPUT_STATE *pState);   The dwUserIndex argument allows us to specify which controller we want, sounds great, however as the documentation will tell us:  Index of the user's controller. Can be a value from 0 to 3.   So a one to four player game would be trivial, but a five player game would be impossible, even so your USB ports have no problem taking five or more controller. The limit is in the API, not the hardware.  You can of course dig deeper and access lower level APIs, write your own drivers and try to deal with those keyboards directly, but that can end up being a huge effort and that is just not worth it for a feature used by only a few. It might also get you into all sorts of problems, as regular user accounts aren't allowed to read directly from hardware, so you have to run the game with Admin rights and such.  This is something that was actually a bit easier in the old days of home computer, back then you were working much closer to the hardware and had no APIs getting in the way, so adding support for multiple devices was much easier when the hardware allowed it. I remember there being a handful of games on the Amiga that supported multiple mice for multiplayer."
pcgaming,3dxbe8,BoredDan,8,Mon Jul 20 13:52:13 2015 UTC,"Multiple m+k is generally a bit harder as all the input code must me done from scratch and is generally lower level as you have to deal with the keyboard and mouse as HID rather then using more generic keyboard and mouse API's. Basically multiple gamepad support tends to be built into things, where as single keyboard and mouse is assumed. Gamepads require much less effort to support multiple instances."

pcgaming,3dxbe8,GlancingArc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:50:16 2015 UTC,"Multiple keyboards and mice normally don't work since the keyboard drivers only interpret one input from multiple devices.

Because then you could still have what OP is asking for, while still offering the same feature for a single monitor setup.  And two M&KB setups have been possible since the 90's. This is how you played The Settlers 2 local multiplayer: You had to use 2 mice and 2 keyboards on the same computer as it had no gamepad support. Just plug two mice or two keyboards into your computer; Windows will recognize them both as separate things."

pcgaming,3dxbe8,168523,3,Mon Jul 20 17:35:15 2015 UTC,"Windows will recognize them as separate devices, as it should, but as far as the inputs they generate, they're bunched together by the system. Plug in two mice (or a separate mouse in a laptop with an integrated touchpad), and see that you can play tug-of-war with the cursor if you move both at the same time, you don't get another pointer on the screen. As far as a program knows, it's all coming from a single source, unless the program is made aware of the different hardware peripherals.  A game can be made to recognize two keyboards and two mice as separate controller sets and map them to different players, but all the code necessary to do that would need do be written by the developer (while controller libraries do that out of the box).  Again, the point was not that it can't be done, but that it's not worth doing considering how much of a hassle it all is."
pcgaming,3dxbe8,PillowTalk420,0,Mon Jul 20 17:41:55 2015 UTC,"It really wouldn't be that much of a hassle. There are code sets/APIs etc that have that kind of input support built in, so you wouldn't even need to re-invent the wheel. There'd be more of a hassle in figuring out where each player was going to sit when playing the game, than adding the support when programming it.  Like I said, this has been possible for a long time. Many older games actually have support for it. And even currently, you can use things like Glovepie or similar to use them in games that don't natively support multiple mouse/keyboard inputs."
pcgaming,3dxbe8,168523,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:49:49 2015 UTC,"Glovepie seems to have ceased development almost five years ago, and there's little available at a glance re: licensing and code. An end user could make do and run it, but it's not an option available for a developer, so they'll need to do the work themselves.   That a program for doing what you want exist somewhere doesn't mean that a developer can just magically slap it into their game and call it a day.  Anything that requires development and testing time is a hassle, and this would not be an exception. Again, recognizing two sets of inputs would only be one issue, out of a plethora of others. The fact that something's possible doesn't mean that it's gonna be made... or that anyone actually cares about it being made."
pcgaming,3dxbe8,PillowTalk420,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:55:10 2015 UTC,"Glovepie isn't an API. I was merely mentioning it because it can be used to do exactly what we're talking about, but without it needing to be programmed into a game. So you can use it now, if you so desire.  There are APIs, middleware and bits of open-source code that you literally do just slap into your program's code that handle the inputs in this fashion, however. Those would be what would likely be used to diminish the work involved.  I'm not saying it's ever going to happen, though. It's already pretty niche just having split-screen or single-PC local multiplayer in general. I don't really see them stepping up a game that isn't even there to begin with. Just saying that, if they really wanted to do something like that, it really would not be that difficult."

pcgaming,3dxbe8,xikronusix,3,Mon Jul 20 09:51:22 2015 UTC,"For some games it works great, did that with Tony hawks pro 2. The split screen is vertical so what I did was eyefinity both displays as a single display and then adjust the games resolution. Problem is that most games don't support co-op. More frustrating is when you find third parties that solo create programs to allow for multiple instances to run. Borderlands 2 and the pre sequel are great examples of where some dude was like, ""I'm going to fix this"" and then it happened. It's sad to think that if one person can do it in his spare time, what excuse does the main company have? More beta testing? Similar bugs will show up. More coding? If one guy can do it, then either get him on the team or have multiple people do it in a matter of days. License issues? This is where I can actually see a problem, depending on what platform. Steam should be fine, technically it's one license with multiple users, just like any co-op experience, but if you load multiple instances so that each user has their own customizations that could get tricky. Especially when one user is OK with a certain resolution or wants vsync but the other does not. I guess that falls under bug control but still any complication needs to be thought about. Mainly I'm still under the belief it should be trivial with most games and seeing how gamers are getting less and less with their purchases, well this would be a nice add on."
pcgaming,3dxbe8,wurkenardlee,2,Mon Jul 20 11:36:24 2015 UTC,The game would have to support it but one work around could be to run two instances of the same game in local co op mode and just have one window on each screen. Then just connect to each other. Definitely possible

Ex. Two 1920x1080 monitors would be set up as a single monitor of 3840x1080. This plays the game across both monitors with the center directly in the middle.

Download some controller profiles, set the render resolution 2560x2112 (4x native), and you have amazing four player Smash Bros goodness.  So that's the main attraction, but for some additional multiplayer enjoyment there are a great deal of indies. Broforce and Speedrunners both support four players on one screen and are very fun.

pcgaming,3dxbe8,Kinths,2,Mon Jul 20 14:37:49 2015 UTC,"From a game development standpoint it's a lot more work than your standard local co-op. It adds networking into the mix. Local Co-op for a shared view space is as simple as adding another character and mapping inputs. For split screen you are adding another Camera, which isn't particularly difficult.   Networking on the other hand can be fairly difficult to do even just between two directly connected computers. LAN is easier than online networking but not by much. Big name engines are making it easier and easier, but for a lot of games if you aren't adding online multiplayer then adding LAN support is often too much work for a feature that isn't all that requested or used. This is why most games with online MP often have LAN support and most games that don't have online MP don't have LAN.    Even if you mean just two monitors on one PC it is a lot of work. There are a lot of variables to account for for something that would very rarely get used."
pcgaming,3dxbe8,caedicus,-1,Mon Jul 20 13:28:03 2015 UTC,"If I'm understanding ""multi-screen local co-op"" correctly, which is just two or more monitors connected to one PC.  I don't think networking is necessary at all.  All the game state can be stored in one  location, and there would be multiple cameras exactly like in split screen.  The challenge would be dealing with multiple monitor devices, and hoping that whatever API or development kit can handle them correctly.  I've tried doing multi-monitor support with XNA (for a customer), and while it was possible, it really wasn't well supported."
pcgaming,3dxbe8,nuketesuji,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:31:42 2015 UTC,"Because then multiple people could get together and play on one copy of the game. And that cuts down on sales as opposed to the current LAN party format. It's all about sales man. And to be fair, only a few games support single input multi screen use."
pcgaming,3dxbe8,BoredDan,-1,Mon Jul 20 12:37:47 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt that has anything to do with it. As it is couch co-op is already not particularly popular on pc. Supporting it is low on the list because it's a lot of effort for something which is rarely used. Supporting multiple monitors is the same logic extended. It has nothing to do with trying to increase sales, it has to do with development priorities."

I completed the game and only then found out there was a bunch of DLC that wasn't included, apparently all the best stuff to boot. It seems to be the same situation with ME3 which entirely puts me off playing it. I don't understand why this long after the games released they haven't produced complete editions of them."
pcgaming,3dzg9p,LazyGit,2,Tue Jul 21 09:40:49 2015 UTC,"I'd say Lair of the Shadow Broker is as well and as a bonus, is fully after the story and never feels like it should have been part of the main game."

It's also set after the main game, doesn't contain story elements related to the Collectors (and thus the main game), and just feels like wonderful added content. The arrival is decent as well and while it's a good gap DLC, the gameplay bits are fairly weak."
pcgaming,3dzg9p,Xander471,0,Tue Jul 21 12:04:27 2015 UTC,Except that it sets up a HUGE plot point for what Liara's been up to in Mass Effect 3.
pcgaming,3dzg9p,jschild,2,Tue Jul 21 13:44:16 2015 UTC,Not really. It's a gap DLC.  It's set up during the game that she's hunting the shadow broker.  She's the shadow broker in ME3.  It's a standalone story not relevent for either.

pcgaming,3dzg9p,Xander471,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:42 2015 UTC,"It doesn't add to ME2 at all, no, but it certainly leaves the player super clueless when out of nowhere at the beginning of ME3, you're in military prison for something you did in a DLC you didn't play.

When I moved to PC a few years ago, I bought the trilogy pack on sale and was excited to play through the series again until I discovered that the trilogy pack didn't include the DLC(which is stupid by itself), and that, to buy the DLC, I'd have to jump through hoops with Bioware points AND spend more than I did to begin with on the base games. It's ridiculous.   And there's no chance that I'm going to play through the series without DLCs like Lair of the Shadow Broker, which I consider to be one of the best pieces of DLC ever."

pcgaming,3dzg9p,Nightelfpala,4,Mon Jul 20 22:27:00 2015 UTC,"I picked up Payday2 with a recent HumbleBundle, and it's a fairly mixed bag with DLC:   You have no way of killing a Shield (enemy with bulletproof riot shield) from the front without weapon / Mod DLCs - grenades, sniper rifles, high explosive / flechette rounds for shotguns are all DLC-exclusive content. Sniper rifles, LMGs, rocket/grenade launchers aren't accessible without DLC which is a shame, as they could provide unique playstyles. I haven't really looked at weapons balance-wise, though I know that it's almost impossible to go below 15 detection risk without Akimbo/Ambidexterity skills - you don't have the low-concealment primary weapons (like the Bow) or even sufficient mods to improve their concealment. Heists: you can't host a heist if you don't have the DLC for it, but you can join it anyway - not a huge problem, there are enough without it, some heists are quite rare because of this though (Golden Grin Casino, Alesso Heist, Butcher Bomb heists, Armored Transports). Character DLCs have perk-decks included in them - the Clover one (Burglar) is probably the best one for stealth (corpse bagging, pager answering speed boosts are unique to that deck, lockpicking speed is provided by only one other skill in the game), you can't really play melee without Infiltrator or Sociopath (the health-regain they provide would be probably invaluable, though it's debatable how effective a melee build could even be). The characters and the Masks are completely fine, as they're only cosmetics and you can even get to play a character you don't own if your preferred one is already used by someone who joined before you.   Pricing? To be honest I have no idea, I haven't really looked at it yet, I'm not interested in buying DLC for any game."
pcgaming,3dzg9p,Nothox,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:31:59 2015 UTC,"1) You don't need those guns to play, yes there is some powercreep but it's far from P2W.  2) You can join heists that you don't own.  3) They make a ton of free content too, just look at the crimefest & hypetrain.  4) The dlcs are dirt cheap during steam sales."

pcgaming,3dzg9p,WowZaPowah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:06:08 2015 UTC,"Not even true, you need to buy them to be equippable in your inventory, you can still use them in other ways (ie preplanning grenade dead drop...) They're not even that great. They're hard to aim, you don't get many, and generally are a waste of time. Tons of the game's best weapons are arguably vanilla. Best assault rifle, best secondary, etc.   The reason I consider weapon packs in DLC to be fair is because the game is sold for dirt cheap on sale, you can easily get dozens of hours in before you begin to get bored of stock weapons, they aren't overpowered, the DLCs themselves are inexpensive, especially on sale, and they constantly release free DLC for the game (Diamond, Big Bank, Hotline Miami, Golden Grin...).  Calling it a ripoff because you have to buy grenades doesn't make sense. How is that a ripoff? Was the game some with the expectation of grenades, or was it just some idea you had as a consumer based on no actual facts?  Do I think it's bullshit? Yeah. Is the DLC excessive at times? Yeah. But the DLC isn't meant to be a paywall, it's supposed to keep a two year old game fresh and allow players who sink hundreds of hours into the game to play differently and reinvigorate their lives for the game."
pcgaming,3dzg9p,ryan_m,2,Tue Jul 21 12:33:31 2015 UTC,"Grenades are the bane of a stealth player's existence.  Only thing that might be considered P2W would be the Courier DLC, because of all the mods that are essential to min/max your weapons.  So basically, only 1 DLC is truly necessary to play the game at a very high level (DW loud heists).  Everything else is unnecessary."

I tried the game recently and went to Infamy VI, however I'm over it.  If you actually dedicate yourself to levelling, it's very easy to level quickly. I don't know about now, but IIRC Diamond Store -> Firestarter Pro (Stealth) -> Rats Pro -> repeat was quite quick.  We'd do Nightclub (kill everything/stealth runs) to clear negative bonuses. Four Stores ATM on Overkill was also a good way to get started if you're solo in the first few levels.  edit From achivements. I have a full time job so there's probably a maximum of 4 hours playtime on a weekday. And the obvious burnout as I got slower even though I had bonus XP from Infamy.  II - 9 days after I  III - 8 days later.  IV - 10 days later.  V - 15 days later."

After that, people ECM rushed Shadow Raid during the XP boost, and you had people getting to 25-100 in like 200 hours if that's all they did.  At this point, level/hours don't mean shit."

pcgaming,3dzg9p,Jinxyface,5,Mon Jul 20 20:13:43 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say Train Simulator is an abuser of DLC. It's meant to be a simulation of trains for real life collectors. TS2014 allows them to go digital. Those people buy lots of trains and tacks anyway.
pcgaming,3dzg9p,SkateboardCop,14,Mon Jul 20 20:56:00 2015 UTC,Train Simulator gets a pass in the same way buying a hot wheels race track gets a pass because they include a couple of basic ones and then you pay extra for the cars you really want. But you're not missing out on anything by not shelling out $3600 for DLC.

It's technically a single player game in the context of this discussion because it isn't an online shooter in the same sense as BF or CoD. They announced the first DLC character before release (she was a pre-order bonus for the season pass). The season pass also included the first level cap increase. The four campaign dlcs were then put out over time and were generally pretty we received, especially the last one since GB made it 100% themselves. Then there was Krieg, the second DLC character. Then came the cosmetic DLC, I think 3 sets of heads and body skins for each character. Then we got the second level cap increase (which to be fair included Digistruct Peak (if you like those kind of places, which I don't) and introduced more pearlescent-grade weapons). Then when people asked for even more content GB just threw the Headhunter packs together and sold the five of those as hour-long self-contained DLC.

Large expansions (the features of which get included in the base game, for free, with the accompanying patch) with associated (but separate so you don't have to buy them) cosmetic DLC that keeps the artists employed and gives the people that want these things what they ask for.  In addition only the host needs to have any given expansion and everyone in a multiplayer game can play with it.   and they even DRM up their mods.   This is also not true at all.  Mods for their games have no DRM on them at all.  You can download a mod from anywhere and put it into the mods folder and it will work.  The worst thing they ask you to do is register your cd-key to view the tech support and mods sub-forums.  Honestly, I don't know what more you could ask of them.

Prior to the release of CS, a province's tax and military power were decided by something called base tax (this is vastly simplifying it) and I believe trade power was decided primarily by location.  When they released CS, they did away with base tax and introduced a system called development. You have admin power, diplomatic power, and military power, so you use those powers (that are gained in various ways and have been part of the game since release) to upgrade provinces. When you have massively upgraded provinces, they give you a lot of money, trade, production, and military power.   The big change that fucked players who don't have it is that a province that has 1/1/1 is really, really, really shit. When you colonize empty provinces in the Americas, Africa, or Oceania, their value is 1/1/1 for the most part. If you don't own Common Sense, then you can't upgrade the provinces, which means they become a money sink, making colonization completely non-viable."

Now Iris Pro 6200 that would be doubly impressive since benchmarks shows it being comparable to (albeit slightly worse) than a GTX750. This essentially kills the low end GPU market (and APUs), and in future it's not impossible to think that mid-tier GPUs are on the way out as well.

pcgaming,3dwy2c,Monosodium_Glutamate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:18:15 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily... Iris Pro 6200 is only available on top-end Intel chips, so for cheaper laptops and desktops it might still be more cost effective to pair a weaker CPU with a midrange dedicated GPU. The package wouldn't be as compact or light, but give considerably more bang for your buck. Also, I'm not sure what you mean by killing off APU's, since  it serves the exact same purpose except that its more expensive because Intel."
pcgaming,3dwy2c,Vova_Poutine,3,Mon Jul 20 09:02:46 2015 UTC,"I meant killing in the sense that their performance is obliterated.   Pricing is around $244 which for the performance you get is pretty good. To beat it you'd need a 2gb GTX750 ($160-ish) and cheaper but still good CPU would run you $120 (for an i3-4160) or $175 for a FX-8350 (similar performance in games to the i3).

pcgaming,3dwy2c,Vova_Poutine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:48:14 2015 UTC,I haven't I just looked up the price at Intel. If you can't get it around $250 the hole thing falls to the ground since a cheaper processor + discrete GPU would be cheaper.

pcgaming,3duhd1,doctorpwn,958,Sun Jul 19 16:27:32 2015 UTC,Movies have natural motion blur but games don't.
pcgaming,3duhd1,omegadirectory,496,Sun Jul 19 16:34:07 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. Stop any single frame of an action sequence on a PC and you get one sharply rendered frame. Stop a frame a film and you get a blur that your eye interprets as an object when played at 24 fps.   So the natural question is ""Why not put motion blur in games to give the same effect at lower frame rates?""  The answer, I discovered, is that motion blur is actually more GPU intensive than simply rendering more frames.  edit /u/I_lurk_until_needed has an even better answer regarding focus points. Some games do try motion blur, but it never goes as nicely as film capture."
pcgaming,3duhd1,thoughtfix,133,Sun Jul 19 16:40:42 2015 UTC,"Motion blur is also highly impacted by lighting. Until we have something near global illumination, motion blur will almost always look bad.  I would say we have another 15-20 years before we have realistic motion blur in games."
pcgaming,3duhd1,Deadmeat553,80,Sun Jul 19 18:04:44 2015 UTC,Wanna know a sad thing.  DX9 games used a whole 4 Light sources. http://www.littletinyfrogs.com/article/460524/DirectX_11_vs_DirectX_12_oversimplified
pcgaming,3duhd1,MewKazami,44,Sun Jul 19 19:16:57 2015 UTC,"It's not really a limitation of Dx9 though, it was the technique used by most games at the time. There is another technique called deferred shading/lighting that allows for more lights by reducing the complexity of the lights by using framebuffers to compute them instead of on a per object basis."
pcgaming,3duhd1,skln,11,Sun Jul 19 21:08:51 2015 UTC,Rendering transparent objects like glass or water is a pain with deferred rendering.
pcgaming,3duhd1,shadowycore,10,Sun Jul 19 22:11:45 2015 UTC,Yah there are trade offs for having more lights.

pcgaming,3duhd1,kukiric,4,Mon Jul 20 03:20:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, mostly you fall back to the forward renderer with a reduced lighting profile for those types of objects."
pcgaming,3duhd1,Venia,6,Mon Jul 20 05:19:46 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine ""four shadow casting lights"" considering that small lights since as sconces on a wall have all routinely had lighting. Or we're talking the area of baked lighting where that's relatively unimportant."

pcgaming,3duhd1,s4in7,7,Mon Jul 20 01:34:52 2015 UTC,Some games have motion blur done well.  I turn The Witcher 3's motion blur on because I'm used to 120 fps and can only play The Witcher 3 in 60 fps.  After a few minutes I don't even notice the lack of frames anymore.
pcgaming,3duhd1,caribou_doodoo,4,Sun Jul 19 19:37:35 2015 UTC,"After a few minutes I don't even notice the lack of frames anymore.   Or rather, because you get used to it. I only play on 60 and find 30 jarring as well, but I easily can get into it after 20-30 minutes."
pcgaming,3duhd1,kukiric,79,Mon Jul 20 03:24:50 2015 UTC,Yeah it's because films are captured with a camera and games aren't basically.
pcgaming,3duhd1,Gort25,6,Sun Jul 19 16:49:33 2015 UTC,"It probably also depends on the camera used. If it's film, I figure there is more natural motion blur compared to a digital recording.  And on top of that, in the cinema they use some techniques to add motion blur with the projectors. Either way, I hate it. If I wanted to see streaks of color flashing in front of me, I would play with a yo-yo. At least a yo-yo has unlimited fps, so my eyes can track it well."
pcgaming,3duhd1,iEATu23,16,Sun Jul 19 23:37:17 2015 UTC,"Motion blur is purely a function of shutter angle, film or digital has no effect."
pcgaming,3duhd1,BrainSlurper,39,Mon Jul 20 04:54:03 2015 UTC,True motion blur isn't possible realtime either without causing input lag as you need to blend the next frame into the current frame as well as the previous frame.
pcgaming,3duhd1,shorty_06,7,Sun Jul 19 18:43:54 2015 UTC,"False. Convert object velocities to from world-space to camera space, adjust for the movement of the camera, then roll it into rendering (as a velocity buffer sort of thing). Alternatively you can just render ""microframes"" where needed, possibly limiting them to objects that really need blurring.  Here's some examples of motion blur in a framework that doesn't support using other frames or even multiple passes (although everything is rendered on the fly with ray marching or casting, so it wouldn't translate exactly to traditional rendering, but my point is that your post is objectively false). Beefy GPUs recommended, it was hell looking for these on a work computer...  https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MdB3Dw  https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4sBGD1  https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4dBGDy  https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XlBGRz  https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4d23Rc  https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4sXSD8"

pcgaming,3duhd1,Do_not_dare_give_up,5,Mon Jul 20 10:05:50 2015 UTC,"I don't fully get this, reality doesn't have motion blurring, that has to be my eyes/brain interpreting rapid motion as a blur, right? So why can't my brain do it for a sequence of frames that it still interprets as a continuous motion?"
pcgaming,3duhd1,Shadow_Of_Invisible,20,Sun Jul 19 20:41:47 2015 UTC,"Motion blur is a by-product of capturing images in a camera. Basically, the way that cameras work is that you leave the shutter open for a certain amount of time - less time open means you let in less light and get a less clear picture, more time open means that you let in more light and get a clearer picture. However, the longer you leave the shutter open for, the more likely that what you're trying to take a still shot of will move - when that happens, you get motion blur.  Your brain doesn't really have much of anything to do with it, other than that we're used to seeing motion blur in video and that a blurry image helps to distract from a low framerate because you can't see everything as sharply in the first place."
pcgaming,3duhd1,SMYFFL,5,Sun Jul 19 21:41:54 2015 UTC,"No, motion blur happens in real life too."
pcgaming,3duhd1,HighRelevancy,8,Mon Jul 20 00:17:34 2015 UTC,"You're right, but that's not what OP is talking about. Blurring the continuous stream of information as our eyes are unable to properly focus isn't the same as photographic motion blur in games and movies."
pcgaming,3duhd1,SMYFFL,4,Mon Jul 20 00:58:42 2015 UTC,"Motion blur in real life has nothing to do with ""focus"". Retina cells don't react instantly to what they see. We do perceive motion blur and it's actually very similar to the way it works in cameras, only continuously rather than in discrete time windows.  If this wasn't true, persistence of vision displays wouldn't work, and they clearly and observably do work.  BTW, if by focus, you mean ""tracking"" things with your eyes, that's just because persistence of vision/motion blur is about movement relative to the retina cells (same as with a camera)."
pcgaming,3duhd1,HighRelevancy,9,Mon Jul 20 01:06:33 2015 UTC,"The blur comes from something moving fast.   30 fps isn't fast enough. Your brain gets used to things though.  Movies looks blurry and muddy to me while hfr (48 fps) movies look vastly better.  Same with games I'm used to 60 fps so dropping to 30 looks odd.  But if I keep at it, I get used to it again."
pcgaming,3duhd1,xxamnn,9,Sun Jul 19 21:05:02 2015 UTC,"What do you mean, isn't fast enough? The objects on screen can move at any speed they like, independent of frame rate. Do you mean that my brain still recognizes individual frames, and that that keeps it from seeing a blur?"
pcgaming,3duhd1,Shadow_Of_Invisible,9,Sun Jul 19 21:07:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, at 30, it's too slow and your eyes see stutter. I know what you mean by ""move"", but it's precisely because they don't actually move but instantly change to new positions that there is a problem."
pcgaming,3duhd1,WazWaz,2,Sun Jul 19 21:23:30 2015 UTC,And adding an artificial blur fixes this and fools the brain into seeing an actual motion?
pcgaming,3duhd1,Shadow_Of_Invisible,3,Sun Jul 19 21:25:28 2015 UTC,"Yes. It's like if you feed eyes yellow light the brain sees yellow light but if you feed eyes finely stippled green and red light the brain also sees yellow light : if you feed eyes directly with the content they (or later processes) would have eventually fed to the brain, the brain ""sees"" the same thing. Computer game motion blur is so poor it's more likely to make you feel sick (again because the brain treats most anomalous inputs as sign you've invested poison and chooses to make you vomit)."
pcgaming,3duhd1,WazWaz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:40:09 2015 UTC,"It has to do with focal points. Whatever you're currently looking at or focusing on appears stationary in your field of view. For instance, move your hand back and forth quickly in front of your face, it appears blurred. Now do the same thing, but track your hand with your eye. Now your hand is clear, but the background is blurred.   When you're staring at your monitor, you have to remember it's a stationary flat surface, and is thus your focal point. Because of this, the image onscreen will not appear blurred despite the perceived motion. That is, unless you create a focal point yourself. Try moving your mouse cursor side to side and follow it with your eyes diligently, the text on this page will seem to blur slightly."
pcgaming,3duhd1,Flames21891,3,Sun Jul 19 22:23:29 2015 UTC,"It's got nothing to do with focal points. The reason you don't see things blurred when you track them is that motion blur happens relative to your retina cells. It's not about movement in the world, but movement in the space of your vision."
pcgaming,3duhd1,HighRelevancy,2,Mon Jul 20 00:17:08 2015 UTC,"Just to add to this, games fake motion blur that's why a lot of the time it doesn't really work correctly. Not like it does in film, live action or animated. A lot of 3D animation software allows for 'real' motion blur and one of the best implementations of this I've seen renders what is essentially 24 blur frames between each frame of animation. This would essentially mean that you would have to run the game at something like 576 FPS for it to have accurate motion blur."
pcgaming,3duhd1,EvilTheDog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:02:45 2015 UTC,Yup. It's the reason why we will probably advance graphics past the uncanny valley and beyond. The amount of amazing stuff we could do with art styles and 4k resolutions... It's absolutely glorious.

pcgaming,3duhd1,Phrodo_00,135,Mon Jul 20 01:27:37 2015 UTC,"To add to this:  The issue is when you are filming a movie a camera will have a focus point, same with your phone if you get it out and take a video now it will focus on something. In a game the game doesn't care (or know for that matter) what you're focusing on and if you start turning sharply everything will just get blurred the fuck about. It is the same reason most turn depth of field off, I don't want to duck behind a box in a fire fight only to have everything but the box get blurred.   In consoles where quick turns are essentially impossible becaus eyou can shove the joystick over all you want your turning speed is limited in game whereas with a mouse you can do a 360 in one action.   thoughtfix was right to say it is more taxing on the GPU however at lower framerates like the consoles often get it does make sense to turn it on as it does a good job of hiding lower fps."

It is done when filming too, camera movements are deliberate and planned.

Source: http://www.pcgamer.com/durantes-witcher-3-analysis-the-alchemy-of-smoothness/  Compare the frametime graphs of no frame rate limiting to vsync (Input lag screeeeeam - if you want vsync, use borderless windowed mode if the performance hit is negligible and it doesn't screw with frame times) to capping it with RTSS.  (Windows 10 has been screwy with capping FPS in Borderless Windowed mode personally but that's been a problem for a while personally. I do have to note that screen tearing is wayyyyy less of a problem when you have a consistent frametime however. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter went from an unplayable mess to stunningly smooth with a 30fps cap / motion blur, personally."
pcgaming,3duhd1,Videogamer321,16,Mon Jul 20 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"On top of that we interact with the game. 60fps to me seems slower when I'm playing personally, when I watch someone else at 60fps or seems smoother than the Fonz."
pcgaming,3duhd1,link6112,9,Sun Jul 19 22:03:03 2015 UTC,"That, and you're going to notice the low fps a lot more when it's something you have direct input over."

pcgaming,3duhd1,XXLpeanuts,7,Sun Jul 19 22:51:57 2015 UTC,"Movie directors also limit themselves to the shots where 24 fps doesn't look so nasty - slow pans instead of being able to look around etc.  You still notice the crap framerate in action scenes though, where you can end up with no idea what's happening because it's all just a blurry juddery mess.  Peter Jackson's HFR movies were experimenting with what shots could be done with higher framerate movies, which had the side-effect of making the movies look worse in normal cinemas. A bit of a catch-22. Directors will need to invent the art all over again to take advantage of HFR and win traditionalists over."
pcgaming,3duhd1,TheCookieMonster,3,Mon Jul 20 02:22:11 2015 UTC,"IMO, that's the age old mistake of directors/editors who think jerky camera movement and quick cuts in editing are the best way to show action or make scenes appear faster than they are.  Things tend to work out so much better when the camera is relatively stable, and the actors/environment in the frame are instead setting the pace and intensity."
pcgaming,3duhd1,vfr4_nhy6,4,Mon Jul 20 13:53:41 2015 UTC,"This really isn't the answer, at all.   If you sit and watch someone play a game, it'll look extremely smooth, even though it could feel laggy to the player.

pcgaming,3duhd1,nourez,5,Mon Jul 20 01:51:19 2015 UTC,I felt the same way when blu-ray came out. The extra clarity in background images made it easy to tell how out of focus and lousy they looked. Then in newer movies the highly detailed backgrounds were off putting. It took a few years to get used to for me. 48fps would probably go the same way if people gave it a chance.
pcgaming,3duhd1,SaffellBot,7,Mon Jul 20 02:41:14 2015 UTC,When the camera would be moved around for scenery shots it'd sometimes feel like there is stuttering even in slow pans. The camera operator might be more at fault though.

pcgaming,3duhd1,Videogamer321,3,Mon Jul 20 00:28:37 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. The answers mentioning motion blur are partially right and wrong. A 30fps game with motion blur still feels less immersive compared to 60fps. It's all about whether you are observing what's on the screen as opposed to being a part of it. This interactivity defines that your brain perceives low framerate as lag, and thinks it's observing something, or becomes frustrated that it couldn't be controlling what's happening if it's lagging yet you are controlling it.  In a theater you know you aren't part of it or in control, so your brain does not become frustrated and observes the events taking place."
pcgaming,3duhd1,nav13eh,2,Mon Jul 20 05:38:56 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer. Motion blur isn't the primary reason like some people are stating. Your brain simply expects a quicker response with video games because you have control over them.
pcgaming,3duhd1,omarfw,173,Mon Jul 20 07:33:21 2015 UTC,"Mostly input.  The problem isn't really with FPS, the problem is with frame speed (FPS is just a convenient way to abstract frame speed into a more readable number).   60 FPS at a consistent frame speed means that every frame lastly roughly 16.7ms. That means that in a perfect world you'll see the response from your input in about 20ms, or 1/50 of a second.  30 FPS, on the other hand, is about 33.3ms. So in a perfect world you'll see the response from your input in about 38ms, or 1/25 of a second.  That's a big difference - 1/25 of a second is a noticeable amount of time, and if all of your inputs were delayed that much your subconsciousness would almost certainly start yelling at you. In the real world your input/output latency is almost exactly 0ms (not exactly 0ms, but so close that it's insignificant). You move your eyes, your vision instantly sees something else. At 30 FPS there's roughly 38ms of latency - you move your eyes and wait 38ms before your vision starts to move.  What happens then isn't nearly as easy to explain. Basically, your brain loses its ""immersion"" in whatever you were doing, and can't convince itself that it is really experiencing what's happening on your screen. You get to a point where you no longer feel as though you are the game, you're just the one controlling it- this clashes with your conscious knowledge that you are, in fact, controlling it and that's where the break occurs.  To put it more simply, the latency gets too high for your brain to trick itself into being ""in"" the game. This isn't a problem in movies because you're never ""in"" it to begin with - your subconscious thinks you are, but that's irrelevant because you consciously know that it's all prerecorded footage that you're just viewing. When gaming, your actions have results, but if it takes too long for those results to occur you brain can't really take it."

The first time I've recorded with Shadowplay at 60FPS, I've thought that something was wrong and the footage was faster due to some bug. I've even went so far as to record the screen via Shadowplay and the external camcorder at the same time to check if it is a real difference or just the perceived one. Turned out that the footage was identical as far as speed is concerned, it was just my perception of the same framerate very different during gameplay and when watching the recording."

Another thing I've noticed is that I don't notice 30fps as much when I'm playing with a controller (like console FPS), because the input is less precise I guess.  When you have a mouse with high sensitivity you can really feel the delay."

You basically have set speed limits on how fast you can move a camera at 24fps before a viewer will start getting motion sick.  24fps probably would be playable in a lot of games if you had a fixed camera angle, but basically anything where the player has control of the camera directly is going to make you sick."

pcgaming,3duhd1,VoodaGod,2,Sun Jul 19 23:33:01 2015 UTC,This could be due to judder as well. Watching in 24 HZ or using a player that has anti-judder/interpolation can reduce the effect.

pcgaming,3duhd1,2FastHaste,6,Sun Jul 19 19:05:12 2015 UTC,"Games basically have a super high shutter speed, so if you pan a camera at a very fast speed it will look janky because there's no motion blur. Film usually has a slower shutter speed, so when you pan the camera you'll get motion blur which will look more natural. If you shoot at a higher shutter speed in film and then pan the camera quickly, you'll get the 'bad frame rate effect'. Check out the d-day invasion in Saving Private Ryan. They do a high shutter speed effect when the guys get shell shocked and it kind of looks like a low FPS game."
pcgaming,3duhd1,kittysparkles,2,Sun Jul 19 18:16:27 2015 UTC,Games basically have a super high shutter speed   Also known as showing the world through photos rather than by simulating light.
pcgaming,3duhd1,FrankFH,5,Sun Jul 19 21:35:08 2015 UTC,"There's even more going on than motion blur and input lag:  When you're watching a movie, the camera is almost always in a fixed positions (admittedly more and more movies have the camera flying around all over the place, but it's still out of your control), and your relation to what you're seeing is passive.  When you're playing a game, you control the camera.  This can lead to a discrepancy between what your mind thinks should happen and what your eyes see, which can cause motion sickness.    On top of that, movies are ""pre-rendereded"" to deliver a fixed FPS, while games are rendered as they happen - this means that the framerate can be inconsistent if the game can't render smoothly.  Large frame drops can make a game unplayable, and worsen the motion sickness effect for people who get it.  The only strong connection between movies and games as mediums is the visual medium.  They're very different beasts, and unless a game is designed to be like a movie, it's not an easy comparison to make; they cannot be assessed fairly by the same values."

pcgaming,3duhd1,orbital1337,13,Sun Jul 19 18:34:39 2015 UTC,"The great thing about film is that no director is locked into using one particular frame rate. I think that 24/25fps is perfectly acceptable and I love watching films in that format.  I'm also a keen filmmaker and never shoot anything about 25fps. I just prefer how it looks. If I came up with a project that demanded 48fps or simply would look better at a higher frame rate, I'm sure I would shoot it that way. I saw The Hobbit in 48fps and thought it looked really cool, so I'm not opposed to higher frame rate films.  I think it's a stylistic choice. Just like choosing to shoot your film in black and white or colour."
pcgaming,3duhd1,PrettyDamnSuperFunny,11,Sun Jul 19 21:42:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think low framerate is a stylistic choice in the same way black and white is. Low framerate was used because of limitations at the time, and people watched these films so much that they then prefer viewing films at that framerate because that's what they're used to. The only advantage to shooting at lower FPS is that it takes up less storage space (or film) and is quicker to edit and render. In my opinion purposefully shooting at a lower FPS is just as bad as purposefully shooting at a lower resolution."
pcgaming,3duhd1,shorty_06,7,Sun Jul 19 18:20:15 2015 UTC,"I do think that shooting at incredibly low frame rates, 10fps for example, may be rather unpleasant for the viewer. But if a director wanted to shoot that way for effect, if we wanted to convey some sort of meaning or message or whatever, then let them. That's the beauty of film. You can do what you want. I firmly believe it's a stylistic choice, but I understand where you're coming from."
pcgaming,3duhd1,PrettyDamnSuperFunny,10,Sun Jul 19 18:51:16 2015 UTC,"I think 24 fps was a technical limitation that people got used to.  Now it is being explained away as a stylistic choice or as being ""genuine"".  That explanation is just a rationalization.  24fps looks bad."

The reason is that I can't stand how choppy and blurry 24fps is. It strains the eyes and makes me cringe.  Of course you can't please everyone.  But be aware that for some people like me it's a big deal. And it's money that the industry is not getting.  Also: All the videos I watch that are not at least 60fps, go through a pluggin called SVP which does real time motion interpolation.  So if you want to sell me digital videos. It need to be able to be played using SVP."
pcgaming,3duhd1,2FastHaste,7,Mon Jul 20 08:36:23 2015 UTC,"I completely understand. Unfortunately you're in the minority, so I don't see HFR film becoming popular anytime soon. A lot of people simply haven't seen high frame rate film or they just don't like it.  It's a shame, as I think choice is good. I'd love it if a film I wanted to see came out in both HFR and 24fps.  The industry would need to fully get behind it to convince the masses. I think if they started bundling HFR versions of films with standard Blu-Rays, more people would be inclined to try it."

pcgaming,3duhd1,VoodaGod,4,Sun Jul 19 21:17:00 2015 UTC,Except we tried other styles and it looks fake and weird. They released the hobbit and others at 48fps and it looked like actors acting out a scene.

pcgaming,3duhd1,palindromic,31,Sun Jul 19 19:15:40 2015 UTC,"Thus point proven...you're used to 24fps so when you see it smoother it seems odd but if you had been brought up on 48+ fps movies you would think 24 looked like crap and would have no problem with it.  To be frank (and this is just in general not aimed at you) the same disdain people show for console users accepting 30 fps as ""ok"" but conversely say they don't want higher frame rate movies makes them kind of hypocritical.  I don't experience this falseness as I simply enjoy seeing a smoother movie or a smoother game."
pcgaming,3duhd1,JazMac34,2,Sun Jul 19 20:49:41 2015 UTC,"I've read that movies being 24 fps makes us be more immersed because low frames means that there's information missing and our brain has to work harder to fill the gaps. When we watch a 48 fps movie they give us a lot more information and our brain doesn't have to fill the gaps so it doesn't ""connects"" with the movie.  Just something I read. Not saying whether it's true or not."
pcgaming,3duhd1,Yearlaren,-1,Sun Jul 19 17:33:21 2015 UTC,"That not how it works though for movies. Movies ride a line of fiction and reality and running at high fps values ruins that, as you can simply see the real motion of people occurring. This results in an uncanny valley effect that more people experience than don't. There is science behind this not arbitrary I grew up watching 24fps biased opinion going on. Our brains physically discern things at a different level when you view films at 24fps because reality isn't that slow, and we're able to suspend our belief that this is real and subconsciously accept all the acting mechanics and fakeness of it all.  EDIT: this isn't to say that you can't fix this issue. It's not entirely wrong to say it's based on our perception of 24fps being the norm - but more so that the way they design films is with 24/30 fps in mind, resulting in certain things being down that makes moving to higher fps feel wrong. This could be solved by developing new acting mechanics to resolve those issues."
pcgaming,3duhd1,Metalheadzaid,8,Sun Jul 19 22:13:31 2015 UTC,So an interesting take on this is that movies are trying to make things look slightly less real because they want us to think they are real while a game is trying to make things look more real so that we think they are real.
pcgaming,3duhd1,pilgrimboy,5,Sun Jul 19 17:44:25 2015 UTC,"If we had all grown up watching films at a higher fps it would look normal to us.  If you viewed real life at 24fps you would get the uncanny valley effect.  There is no magic brain sweet-spot with 24fps, just a lifetime of expectation."

pcgaming,3duhd1,JazMac34,2,Sun Jul 19 19:42:55 2015 UTC,Where is the science?  You can suspend disbelief on anything your used to.  48 fps is still a very low frame rate compared to reality.  Hfr just looks better.  It baffles me that the people try their damnedest to cling to 24 fps.
pcgaming,3duhd1,xxamnn,2,Sun Jul 19 17:46:36 2015 UTC,"I couldn't care less about 24 fps. The issue right now isn't that higher fps isn't better, it's that how we do things doesn't look good at higher fps. I game 90-96hz  right now, so I'm well aware of the benefits of fps increases."
pcgaming,3duhd1,Metalheadzaid,4,Sun Jul 19 21:23:19 2015 UTC,I remember many people saying the same thing when 120hz tvs with frame interpolation became the norm.  Comments of it looks fake/weird died out after a couple days of viewing.  So I don't think the theater experience would be much different.
pcgaming,3duhd1,snerhasnerha,3,Sun Jul 19 21:45:12 2015 UTC,"They released the hobbit and others at 48fps and it looked like actors acting out a scene.   This effect isn't actually a product of higher frames, it's a product of expectation.  Because most movies play at 24 fps, we all associate that rate with film.  When movies ""move too fast"" (that's how it looks to me), it snaps us out of our immersion and makes us focus on the medium rather than the content.  That shift in focus reminds us that we're watching a film."

pcgaming,3duhd1,ycnz,0,Sun Jul 19 19:51:35 2015 UTC,"24fps was settled on because it doesn't feel like real life, it feels surreal, larger than life. As for the soap opera effect and why higher frames feel cheaper, I think it's because home video camcorders shot at 30fps, which was noticeable enough to make the association that higher frames means cheaper quality. And I believe the soap opera association is in part to them having used higher frames in the past, although this is just speculation. I do know that some used to record on video tapes instead of film, I just don't know what the standard was for filming, though."
pcgaming,3duhd1,ducttape83,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:21:18 2015 UTC,"Same here. I hate that movies seem to be choppy a lot of the time and oh god, I hate the fucking motion blur. I want a clear picture, not a 4K image of blur."
pcgaming,3duhd1,ShenziSixaxis,5,Sun Jul 19 22:11:21 2015 UTC,"You feel the difference more than you can see it when you're playing a game, because you have more feedback when you're in control than when you're simply watching. Watch a video at 30fps compared to 60fps and, while you can tell the difference passively, playing a game will feel, and thus look, almost totally different.  The film is going to be blurry, naturally, at 24fps; it's filming something that is playing at real-time, which is infinitely faster than 24fps, but only capturing 24 frames a second of that real-time action. A game running at 24fps will have blurring, also, that is not necessarily added in.   This is from your brain, not the computer or the game, filling in the gaps that weren't shown to your eyes. The same type of motion blur you'd see just turning your head back and forth really quickly. A game running at 60fps will also have this blurring effect; but because you are being shown more information, your brain doesn't have to guess as much, and so you have a smoother looking image."
pcgaming,3duhd1,PillowTalk420,4,Sun Jul 19 23:16:52 2015 UTC,"It depends on your definition of ""completely fine"". If a camera pans quickly in any 24-30 fps piece of media, it's going to be one of two things. 1. Choppy as fuck because they didn't add motion blur. or 2. Blurred to hell and essentially completely illegible. If you pan the camera really quickly in a 2D or 3D game (without engine motion-blur), at 120Hz+ everything in the scene will be smooth with minimal blurring (from the display itself). Hit a certain speed (in pixels per second), and that inherent motion blur of the display will stop small text from being legible. Use an Ultra Low Motion Blur solution (Lightboost/ULMB/etc), and that tiny text can maintain full clarity up until the point where it's literally too fast to track across the display with your eyes, at ~2300-3000+ pixels per second. A standard 60Hz display shows blurring of pixels at even 100 pixels a second if not slower.  At 24-30FPS with motionblur trails that are almost seconds long, anything but general shapes, not just small text, become too hard to make out. Do you really need to see what happens during the pans in films? No, because they wouldn't have panned if there was anything to see. But that right there shows how their standards limit what they can do. If they want you to see something clearly in a pan, it has to move with the camera and maintain position within the frame. They can't pan and reveal detail at the same time, they have to pick one or the other.  And that brings us to games. Especially in a 3D game with camera movement, 24-30 FPS with the levels of motion-blur that films use would make it impossible to find enemies in an average environment while turning the camera fast enough to be useful. For that reason console games use less blur and try to maintain at least 30, but you still run into the choice. A smooth pan that makes it hard to see details (some of which can make you lose if you fail to react), or blatantly low framerate pan that might show clear details but is hard to track with your eyes because of the lack of visual information per second and thus the large gaps in the motion of fast moving objects.  It's a similar case with FOV. First off, high field of view in both a physical or virtual camera lens makes human faces look bad, which is why movies often use high focal distance lenses, and why default cutscene cameras in games use exceedingly low field of view settings. It makes humanoid figures, and a lot of other things really, look really nice. They don't do large sweeping pans often so it's not really as disorienting as it could be. Have a similar camera in a game, where you require the player to quickly pan the camera to find things in the environment, and it quickly becomes nauseating and awkward, even more so the larger the horizontal viewing angle between the player and their display."

Even though a faster frame rate would have made the images sharper, 24 FPS became the industry standard as the cost of film has always been extremely high (consider the costs to develop miles of expensive film, make the inter-negatives, rushes, edit copies, safety copies, multiple masters plus often thousands of distribution copies to theaters, plus editing out, on average, more than half of what is shot).   As such, 24 FPS was the most economical frame rate, so until fairly recently, that was the standard. When films started being shot at higher frame rates, it created problems....the faster the frame rate, more flaws and errors can be seen. So much that you can see the flaws in makeup, CG flaws, etc. This is due to much sharper images and the lack of perceived motion blur.   Most games add motion blur to fool our brains into thinking we are seeing a steady flow of images because games are not rendered at a steady frame rate but generally we think they are due to an ocular phenomenon known as ""persistence of vision"". That is why motion blur is added to digital film/video processing...to give it that blurry ""film look.""  Seems to me it's kinda ironic; digital images are actually too sharp and many people find that visually irritating...hence, they add some blur....right back where they started, sorta.  Edit: clarity & typoz"
pcgaming,3duhd1,1865,2,Sun Jul 19 19:30:36 2015 UTC,"You can watch movies and shows (even youtube) at 120fps right now. Check out the SVP project, which uses your CPU and GPU horsepower to actually calculate trajectories of pixels thereby calculation frames in between frames to bring the fps from 24 up to 60, 120, 144, or anything else you like. It works great and is very easy to install!  http://www.svp-team.com/"
pcgaming,3duhd1,ashaza,2,Sun Jul 19 22:32:35 2015 UTC,Movies and tv look GOD AWFUL during pan shots and action scenes imo
pcgaming,3duhd1,miles197,2,Sun Jul 19 23:50:38 2015 UTC,"Since a lot of these people are misinformed on motion blur, I thought I would add my own answer here.  First of all. Motion blur has nothing...NOTHING to do with focus. I can see how you would confuse it. But it has nothing to do with focus.  I'm going to start with how motion blur in movies works...cameras. the longer you have the shutter open on a camera, the more motion blur you will see. A 60 fps movie will naturally have less motion blur than a 30 fps movie because the shutter needs to open AND CLOSE 60 times a second rather than only 30 times. You can check this out yourself. If you set the shutter speed on your camera very high, and move it a lot, you will see a little bit of blur. Now if you set it as LOW as you can, and move it, you will only see blur. Now, at 24 fps there is a good amount of motion blur, at 60, there is still motion blur, but a lot less, and it will look more sharp.  Now...what about games you ask?  Well, in a movie, it doesn't matter how you move the camera, it will always have motion blur because of how I explained earlier. But in a game, every single frame is rendered as if it is a still image, perfectly sharp. But now you throw a lot into the mix. You can apply motion blur to a game without any input latency...but you leave the game guessing what you will do, where will you look? It cannot do that, we are to unpredictable. So you will never see this form of motion blur because leaving it to guess your movement will cause a lot of artifacts. Now the most common form of motion blur in games I like to call ""stacking"" it takes two frames, and blends them together. This causes a lot of input latency...MORE THAN DOUBLE. This is because it needs two frames to apply the motion blur, but it can't apply it instantly...so it is usually about 2.2-3.5 NON MODIFIED frames before one is sent to your screen.  Tl;Dr: if you want to know exactly why this happens, read the full explaination. But basically, a camera naturally applies motion blur, and your computer can't tell the future."

pcgaming,3duhd1,wolfishacker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:26:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's because films and games are completely different. In a film persistence of motion is created by still shots put side by side and it creates a moving picture. The way that it works in a video game is the information on screen is being refreshed 24, 60 or 80 times per second or what ever your FPS is. The slower it gets refreshed the more janky it is. Basically it's impossible to get a laggy film unless it's being streamed on a slow connection because it all comes from still pictures instead of having to refresh and update the images on screen."

You'd be surprised at how much it actually doesn't move. Most of the time it focuses on characters faces and sometimes zooms out when there is a lot of movement. So the characters move move more than the camera.  Also , rather than drag the camera from one point to another (e.g. from character to character), there are multiple cameras and the movie just jumps from camera to camera."
pcgaming,3duhd1,WiseWaffle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:58:12 2015 UTC,"Does it have anything to do with the fact that with movies, you just watch it, whereas with games you're actively controlling it and you therefore 'feel' it more because of such?

It's not just the rich hobbyists that benefit from well designed games, if anything its the opposite. Your rich people who can afford the latest and greatest have the luxury of loading the game up, slapping everything to the ""ultra high"" preset and enjoying their game.

It takes hard work and dedication, but none of these are some kind of future technology, it's good design from the beginning and not compromising on these principles because it is easier in the short term. It helps build a better game, and games that are well designed are the ones that survive, and those are the real success stories.

FEZ is listed as it supports it, but game speed is doubled. Hilariously it's actually playable and feels good at double speed at the sounds and music remain intact, but I'd never consider that as HFR support. The 120hz launch command is simply taking the official 60Hz command and doubling it, and it's in no way official or intended. Antichamber has support listed, but it stutters ridiculously at 120Hz because the way the dev programmed it makes it so that by default standard V-sync can be turned on or off, but in order to uncap it to 120 in the config files, the game sees that and automatically forces standard v-sync on making it impossive to force adaptive v-sync instead. If you drop ONE frame below 120, which happens nearly constantly, you're getting stutters down to 60 and it looks horrible. Fucking Castle Crashers has 60FPS support, because whatever moron wrote that didn't realize the game runs at 60hz, but only ever renders 30FPS. Battleblock is actually capped and runs at 60. Run back and fourth in both and compare how blurred the backgrounds get.  It is however nice to see that the pages were just changed to show 60FPS and 120+ FPS categories in place of the single {High Framerate) category. The false info I mentioned is still there, but it's still a nice change."
pcgaming,3duil6,MangoTangoFox,21,Sun Jul 19 17:25:30 2015 UTC,"You know it's community managed right? Instead of complaining you should probably edit it yourself to make it correct, there are over 3,850 articles on the wiki so it's near impossible for every single article to have high amounts of effort put into it and or to get proper quality control, especially when it's about an indie game and not an AAA game.   (btw, Battleblock is locked to 64fps and not 60fps)"
pcgaming,3duil6,JoeyKingX,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:47:03 2015 UTC,"I'm aware (I actually went and corrected FEZ's page right after my post). I was just pointing out that even though data is filled in (indicating that someone manually entered that info) on tons of games, the more complex parameters can often be incorrect.  And for Battleblock, I do not at all see how 64 vs 60 could ever be relevant. Sure, list it if you'd like, but it's not even vaguely vital information worth correcting someone over as it doesn't change the user's experience or the setup process, being slightly above a standard."
pcgaming,3duil6,MangoTangoFox,3,Sun Jul 19 21:24:33 2015 UTC,"120Hz+ monitors are very affordable now and adoption is growing rapidly.   You got a source with actual data that shows adoption rate is growing rapidly and even for that matter signficant?  Genuine question, I don't know, this isn't rhetoric.  Just having a quick look at monitors on newegg 144hz (and 120) still costs double what a 60hz does.  If we consider that less than 1% of steam users are running are running a GTX 980 and less than 3% are running a 970, we can then conclude that around 90% to 95% of rigs that have a discrete GPU are running cards that are inferior to the 970 which to me would indicate that they aren't going to get above 100 fps at 1080 in a modern 3d game unless they turn down their graphics options considerably and make the game look like shit (even then, for a lot of entry level cards they may not be able to hit 100 on minimum graphics settings, this is just speculation though).  Again, this is a genuine question.  I only point these things out because it seems to me that value wise most consumers aren't going to benefit much from having a 120+ hz monitor.  I could definitely see the adoption rate being really high in the competitive and enthusiast segments, but for mainstream I think it's pretty questionable."

I'm pretty sure the vast majority of counter strike players will do the same as that game is really well optimised. My friend plays it at 120fps on an old laptop.  Also mobas and RTS games are really well optimised and can run pretty nicely on mid range machines"
pcgaming,3duil6,Neeeeple,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:30:00 2015 UTC,"Manufacturers are producing them. Numerous different manufacturers are making numerous different models from 1080P to 1440P, along with G-sync and Free-sync variants. They simply wouldn't be making them with such vigor, if people weren't buying them. I didn't say anything about a majority or anything like that, but just that it's a growing market. Look at most recent display reviews from tech channels, if it's 60Hz, it's sure to be a 4K or 1440P 21:9 panel, and otherwise it's 120hz+. I'm not sure they'd even be allowed to tell you, but you could shoot emails to ASUS, Amazon, Newegg, etc, asking if 120Hz+ sales are increasing noticeably over the past year or two. If they can answer, I'm sure the answer is yes considering the products they are bringing to market.   ""we can then conclude that around 90% to 95% of rigs that have a discrete GPU are running cards that are inferior to the 970 which to me would indicate that they aren't going to get above 100 fps at 1080 in a modern 3d game unless they turn down their graphics options considerably and make the game look like shit (even then, for a lot of entry level cards they may not be able to hit 100 on minimum graphics settings, this is just speculation though)""   That's just complete nonsense. First off, caps happen in everything from huge AAA titles, to mobile and flash ports. It's annoying in Metal Gear Rising (which they've now ported to android)(and GZ), it's annoying in Castle Crashers, it's annoying in Wolfenstein, and it's annoying in FEZ. A range of graphical requirements there, all capped at 30 or 60 for no justifiable reason at all. You can play 3D titles at reasonably high settings at 1080, at 120FPS, on even a GTX 670 which have sold for as low as $170 if not lower. I'm not going to get into pricing logic vs consoles, but it would be absurd to say that 120Hz displays would be pointless for anyone without a 970 or greater, especially so in the case of 120hz variable refresh panels where you have the freedom to run games smoothly across a wide variety of framerates with minimal effort, even if single games drop considerable frames in certain areas/scenarios up and down say in the range of 45-120. Sure, you may not be able to push a constant 120 in X 3D title, but all the time the framerate is between 61 and 120, it's a nicer experience than it would have been on a static 60Hz panel, and that portion of the experience doesn't suddenly disappear if you explode some things and it drops to 45 for a bit.  There's a ton to be had from 120Hz displays even with sub $600-700 systems, and that's being generous considering I've built two sub-$900 systems now for friends with 970s along with SSD+HDDs, i5s, modular power supplies and nice cases. When you start going THAT low in the $500-600 or less range 200-300+ for a display is an unbalanced option unless you plan on adding a GPU from an APU or something later down the road, though 120Hz and G-sync prices are decreasing constantly, so in that case the later you buy the better. Additionally, TB's curator group that caused all this is centered around games at 30FPS, which affects essentially all displays outside of the small portion of users using really low-end TVs as monitors.  With your 60hz vs 120hz pricing you're going off absolute minimums, but that's not what people necessarily buy. People plop down a grand on half-assed smart TVs all the time, and when people go to buy montiors I've seen many choose >$200 1080/60 panels, sometimes without even getting an IPS for that money. People spend $180 on three console games and while they do have re-sale value where digital PC titles do not, that's still a ton of money to spend on three titles to then turn around and pretend as if $200-250 for an insanely impressive display is absolutely out of the question. Just as I've seen people spend $400 on a console alone, while owning a $800-$1200 laptop and/or $600 iPad, then turn around and say PC gaming is way to expensive somehow assuming that it takes $3000 to have a good experience and/or not considering the fact that it would replace those other devices. I assure you, >60Hz adoption is growing, along with variable refresh technologies, in conjunction with and in addition to VR headsets. VR may or may not fail this time, and while certain headsets absolutely will fail as the market finds what it likes, >60hz and variable refresh aren't going anywhere, as it's a significant/blatant improvement with little to no downsides or weirdness that often come with things like VR, motion gaming, etc. Again, even if X game is too hard to run now, what about in 4 years when the same GPU budget gets you 2-4x the performance and the game is still supported by the current operating system unlike consoles which often abandon the entire library with every generation, at least before a significant amount of effort is put into an emulating solution as microsoft have just announce for their platform. Old games don't magically lose all of their appeal, hell they often even have more down the road when you factor in their discounted pricing and how well you can run them now with nicer hardware. There's an appeal to the new hot thing, but on PC games can often gain appeal over time as they literally become superior experiences through brute force performance, OS/Driver/API improvements, remasters, patches, mods, cheat-engine tables, etc etc."
pcgaming,3duil6,MangoTangoFox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:47:41 2015 UTC,"Like I said, the question wasn't rhetorical.  I just wanted to know if there's any data that exists cause I think it would be interesting to look at and it's not something that I've personally come across.   With your 60hz vs 120hz pricing you're going off absolute minimums,   It actually benefited the 120+ monitors more since there's an acer monitor on newegg that was nearly 100$ cheaper than the next cheapest one.  It was just a quick glance however and newegg isn't the only retailer.   With your 60hz vs 120hz pricing you're going off absolute minimums, but that's not what people necessarily buy. People plop down a grand on half-assed smart TVs all the time, and when people go to buy montiors I've seen many choose >$200 1080/60 panels   This is fine but teh same applies to 120+ monitors, so it still stands to reason that people will spend double to get a 120+.   You can play 3D titles at reasonably high settings at 1080, at 120FPS, on even a GTX 670 which have sold for as low as $170 if not lower.   670 likely can't even hold 60 fps at 1080p in the witcher 3 on medium.

I said the proof is in the pudding, and in the pudding are dozens of brand new 120hz+ SKUs that cost truckloads of cash in R&D to design, test, and manufacture. It's not throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks, they've done the research and they're producing more because they're selling more.  Witcher 3 is a brand new AAA game that pushes the fuck out of the PS4 where it drops to nearly 20FPS often. One that on PC can have its framerate near halved in some scenes by enabling Hairworks on Nvidia GPUs let alone AMD cards. I said 3D titles, not brand spanking new 3D titles. There are hundreds and hundreds of other very pretty titles that are vastly less intensive than today's newest titles like Witcher 3 and Batman.  That blurb of text was absolutely nonsense obsessing over data that has nothing to do with any of my statements, while claiming that a 970 cant pull 120FPS at high settings in ""modern 3D games"", when it certainly can. Again, there are hundreds of ""modern 3D games"" that aren't the Witcher 3 and Batman.  You ignored a vast majority of what I said to nitpick with flawed logic. HFR displays are growing in popularity unless multiple manufactures are making huge mistakes all at the same time, unless tons of tech reviewers/journalists/consumers have no idea what they are talking about, and unless the general relevence in conversation and the media is a complete coincidence. Framerate caps range from disappointing to outright obnoxious, even if you only own a 60Hz display. And >60Hz gaming is totally viable even on a budget, vastly more so if you can squeeze in a variable panel which gets continuously more reasonable price wise. That's my stance, I'm done."

pcgaming,3duil6,JohnnyC4ge,-2,Mon Jul 20 11:40:36 2015 UTC,Frame caps of any kind are most of the time completely inexcusable. Only 2D Platformers and other casual games should have caps.
pcgaming,3duil6,RubyVesper,2,Sun Jul 19 21:29:30 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with that at all. As far as I see it, if elements on the screen move, it shouldn't be capped. Certain games lock their menus and/or loading screens at 30/60 when they know players will spend a lot of time idling on those screens, and that I'm okay with as it's not gameplay. Battleblock, Castlecrashers, FEZ, Rayman Origins/Legends, Kalimba, Ori and the Blind Forest*, etc etc all would be or are drastically more enjoyable running at 120FPS. The ones with *'s are the only ones that can, and FEZ only does it at 2x speed. Hearthstone is wonderful at 120FPS w/ ULMB. Bejeweled 3 is capped, but at 100FPS which is still pretty slick compared to 60.  I'd say 2D titles are less obnoxious than ones with 3D camera movement at a low framerate, but it's still massively disappointing nonetheless. The average person isn't aware of framerates, g-sync, motion blur strobbing, etc, but when you show them in person, they're just as astounded as I am. I showed two friends, and they both eventually switched to PC and bought HFR panels themselves. I showed my 60-70+ year old aunt and uncle (they've gamed on Gamecube+360+Tablets for the past 10 years), and they were amazed by the difference. Even if people don't inherently understand the how, if they aren't blind the result is certainly night and day for everything from full 3D games to just moving a window around on the desktop."
pcgaming,3duil6,MangoTangoFox,-9,Sun Jul 19 22:28:33 2015 UTC,"I can't tell you any single individual I've ever met that has a monitor of that type. In fact, that's more common with TV's than something else.  You're shaping opinion as fact.  As for the 30, 60, and higher FPS locks. The majority of games on consoles these days (played by tens of millions of people), plus older consoles (played by hundreds of millions of people) are generally locked at a 30-45 FPS rate. In that instance it isn't ""shameful"" and could in fact be considered normal. Of course this requires divorcing yourself from the whole PCMR idiocy."
pcgaming,3duil6,Delsana,4,Sun Jul 19 19:47:20 2015 UTC,Pleased to meet you! My TV is 144hz. High framerate TVs and monitors are really common these days. Most monitors will either be either high framerate or high resolution.
pcgaming,3duil6,thecrazyD,-4,Sun Jul 19 20:21:15 2015 UTC,"TV's yes, they've had high refresh rates for a long time. Monitors no. Very few have them.  Always remember that the internet, reddit, and community groups are MINORITIES representing themselves as MAJORITIES. To this day most people still don't even all have 1080p TV's. 720P TV's haven't all broken yet from their last purchase and people are still waiting to replace those. The common resolution is the 1900 type and most monitor sizes aren't even past 20"" yes. The majority of people don't have gaming computers and I'd be willing to bet that based on the majority of computer still coming from HP, Dell, and such, that most cards are integrated types in people's computers, NOT discrete."
pcgaming,3duil6,Delsana,3,Sun Jul 19 20:31:34 2015 UTC,"The problem is there's a difference between looking at all PC Owners and looking at PC Owners who regularly play games on their PC, adressed by the PCGamingWiki. The Steam hardware survey might give a good idea about hardware distirbution.   Some common Resolutions:   1280 x 1024 --- 5.45% (probably old cathode ray tubes wich some dedicated players still swear by)  1366 x 768 --- 26.89% (mainly notebooks i guess)  1600 x 900 --- 7.41%  1680 x 1050 --- 4.85%   1920 x 1080 --- 34.33% (Gaming standard)  2560 x 1440 --- 1.11% (higher than 1080p are indeed rare)  So yes, higher framerate/resolution than 1080p@60Hz might be rare but ""most monitor sizes aren't even past 20"" "" can't be true."
pcgaming,3duil6,Pantoffli,-2,Sun Jul 19 20:54:01 2015 UTC,"Indeed, higher is rarer, though Steam doesn't even factor in non PC gamers so as a general gamer overlook or offline gamer overlook or such that isn't going to give the most detail. Still it's good enough.  Of course, it's also important to realize that there are very different types of games. There are the free games that come with your computer, there are facebook games which are incredibly popular, online games, games that are more.. bordering on illegal (such as gambling games), and other such things. Now if we expand computer to tablets which are used as a replacement for computers these days (and it is becoming hyper aggressive) then we have to add the social, casual, and standard games which even older parents are playing now.  The point is to indicate that the wide-spread focus of gaming even including PC is so varied that it's only a tiny niche that play AAA games. THe problem is with the prevalence of indies, regardless of whatever you think of them, it isn't just a focus on AAA and so we have to factor pretty much every gamer as ""the standard type"".  So basically all gamers are equal and the majority of games aren't even ""retail"" and the majority of systems are no where near high-end or current."

pcgaming,3duil6,thecrazyD,-8,Sun Jul 19 20:46:14 2015 UTC,"Actually.. based on phone usage, facebook games, and tablet usage.. the majority do seem to actually play games now. At least in terms of those owning said devices. Ask your grandmother if she's ever played solitaire.  First off 4K is very very rare.  Let me tell you how long it took to get 720P tv's into people's houses. It required the entire change of the digital cable treatment in the United States, and the reduction from 2,400 dollar prices to 400 - 500. This took over 8 years. The transition from 720p TO 1080p is still not even significant.  As for monitors.. there is no.. push and so therefore that isn't the case. I myself a gamer with numerous computer builds and that owns a tech consulting company bought a monitor 3 years back and it was a 22"" regular 1920 by 1080. No differences to the normal average monitor other than slightly bigger.  You're more likely to see people make changes based on size of monitor rather than actual depth of color or resolution changes.  As for 4K? Expect 10 years for that transition to even be average.  Edit: You're once again shaping opinion as fact, when every statistic and metric disagrees with you. People don't purchase the way you think, and the majority on this sub don't even have high-end graphics card and this is a niche sub. Few at all even have 4K."
pcgaming,3duil6,Delsana,-5,Sun Jul 19 20:47:00 2015 UTC,"The actual technology behind the TV's isn't something I'll learn about from a user on an internet niche site. If it becomes pertinent I'll review the technical specs and research it myself, but the point was that the adoption of higher refresh ratios and such has been something occuring much faster with TV's which actually have a push mechanism, compared to the monitors which don't have a push mechanism for wide spread adoption."
pcgaming,3duil6,Delsana,-4,Mon Jul 20 01:44:37 2015 UTC,"No you didn't explain anything. You indicated something you believed. That's not proof. That's not an explanation. Multiple research papers sourced and with peer reviews and technical specs and applications and analysis. That's real research and proof. This may be Reddit but I'm not like that.  Sorry, but if you're going to say someone's wrong the research factor comes on your end.  Also your abuse and trolling aside, you should keep in mind that's not even the point of the discussion. You're trying to misrepresent and redirect the discussion into an argument about something besides the point. The point is simply that it's an immensely small minority that have adapted to higher end monitors or high-spec gear, and while TV's have a push to get people to constantly update and upgrade them (which takes a large number of years for even a single transition), monitors have no such thing.  Rather than try to skew and distort the entire point of the conversation to stroke your ego and rather than doing the same thing with the internet to destroy the concept of how discussions go, why don't you just go to a different sub and stop trolling, because I'll never see your messages again.  Edit: Did some research, granted just preliminary. You're mostly wrong, but partially right. Motion interpolation DOES exist except it isn't in the way you said it was and further examples of actual 120 HZ TV's were shown, as were quasi 120 HZ TV's and beyond that it's more based on the signal received versus being able to put them on it manually."

pcgaming,3dvw4v,AlphaSentry,2,Mon Jul 20 00:21:32 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true.  A lot of open world games have negligible amount of loading times anyway; maybe because the loading is short enough in itself and/or just because it's a fairly rare occasion having to load something.  For instance installing Shadow of Mordor on a SSD is pretty much pointless, giving how sparsely the game needs to load in the first place and how (relatively) quickly it does it when needed, while doing the same with something like Starcraft 2, with its humongous loading times, makes a hell of a difference.  The more accurate answer would be that the games who benefit the most of being installed on a SSD are the ones that have frequent and/or long loading times or the rare ones that stream a lot of data directly from disc."

WoW streams so you never see a 'load screen' unless moving between discrete servers. IE moving off Kalmidor to EK or EK to Outlands, Outlands to an instance server. Where FF14 and also ff11 were made with consoles in mind so it's packaged in a lot of discrete zones like old EQ was. This is because the console machines just can't really hold the data for an open world in memory, so they cut it into chunks. Skyrim/fallout/etc were a struggle already, a true openworld mmo isn't such a good idea on the old limited memory of like the ps3."

How I'd manage this is that there are enough quests to become the new lord of whateverville spread around that everyone could theoretically be lords of their own towns and then maybe one guy is lord of the whole territory. There would also need to be quests that could only be completed with certain amounts of people so you'd have to wait for 5 friends to get on to raid the hidden fortress.   Overall it sounds like you have a cool idea. I don't think content would be an issue as much as player base and getting people to stay in servers together rather than just try to find empty public ones.   Which I think public servers would need to be a thing. But they only have limited slots that get filled semi-permanently. I think if somebody doesn't log on to a server after a certain number of days their character should be wiped to leave room for somebody else.

Something to combat this would be a system in place where your actions and quests you do chance the political/ecomonic/social climate of the game world to a point where you, individually, might not be able to progress much further in large-scale quests until friends/other players progress in other areas and change it further.  For instance, you do a large quest chain that levels you up quite a bit and gains you game money and xp, but it also gains you notoriety for what you've done. Maybe you've crashed the in-game economy because you were working with a villain of the game. Well, obviously the good NPCs wouldn't offer you any quests because they know what you've done, but your buddy can take that quest and fix everything you've messed up. But it wouldn't necessarily make you rivals in the game, because you could travel somewhere else where your actions haven't affected the cities/worlds there yet."

pcgaming,3dv6zx,creepypriest,6,Sun Jul 19 20:31:26 2015 UTC,"I'm envisioning The Witcher 3 meets Medieval Engineers in a multi-player RPG sandbox with a rich story and world where you also have a very deep crafting and base building system. Small servers with large worlds to explore. Keep it to maybe 10-15 people max. But allow them to do whatever they want. If somebody wants to wander around as a lone mercenary then they can. If some people want to get together and form a group of bandits that pillage the lands they can. But have it all persistent so if the bandits burn down a village then it stays burned down until somebody clears it out and builds a new village. Maybe the surviving NPCs would do it, or maybe they would go to the nearest town and seek refuge there.   Have different quests open up for people based on the actions they take. The people who help others will start getting more heroic quests and maybe can become King. The mercenary gets random bounties and such but if he starts killing innocents he might get approached by a band of thieves to do some assassin type quests. The point is to let the players be able to play how they want and getting a single player experience while still being part of a bigger multi-player world.   I also think players should be able to take the same quests as each other but as soon as its completed it goes away. So maybe two mercenaries take the same bounty and have to compete to see who gets it. Maybe two heroes end up competing to see who becomes ""king"" by having a series of quests that put them in direct competition for the support of the people in the village. Hell, maybe one hero says fuck it and kills the other hero taking the crown by force.   Then he could erect a statue of himself if he wanted. Maybe becomes a tyrant and builds massive walls around the town. Who knows. I'm having too much fun imagining this game."

I think this is mitigated by sufficient content and differing play styles and even, to a certain extent, just open communication with friends. In Minecraft, if someone stays on all day and builds the castles and mines the diamonds, and everyone else hops in during the evenings and gets frustrated because everything's different, they have options. They either do something else entirely in the world, working on their own houses or circuits or whatever, or they simply have a different server that's only for the ""evenings-free crowd,"" or they just tell John that they'd rather save the mining for when everyone is on the server. I'd say the first two options are the most readily-employable, because it lets everybody do what they want.   How I'd manage this is that there are enough quests to become the new lord of whateverville spread around that everyone could theoretically be lords of their own towns and then maybe one guy is lord of the whole territory. There would also need to be quests that could only be completed with certain amounts of people so you'd have to wait for 5 friends to get on to raid the hidden fortress.    That seems like an awesome balance, and could be a great way to implement games of this type. My idea was that it would be okay if one person even beat a whole storyline because things would be exclusive. For instance, even if he made it to the ""final boss"" and ""beat the game,"" it'd be like Skyrim - while he's been running around and completing the ultimate warrior story, he hasn't been allowed into the ""league of beautiful merchants"" line of quests because he completed a warrior quest that disqualified him from it, so now, even though he's the king of the warrior knights, you're the most powerful merchant around, and that has its own perks. Or, you both teamed up from the beginning and you're splitting power. Or you team up later for a unique ruler-with-merchant quest. The point is that it's okay if one person is a king and another person is just a mercenary, or one person is the hero of the water and another is just a cool space trader. Some people will seek power, others just want to own a tavern.    Which I think public servers would need to be a thing. But they only have limited slots that get filled semi-permanently. I think if somebody doesn't log on to a server after a certain number of days their character should be wiped to leave room for somebody else. Also if a server itself doesn't get logged on to for a certain amount of time it gets reset and opened back up.    I think the Minecraft server model would work well, but I could see public servers too. Either way, seems like it would be a cool idea!"

And even if you could, the impact of a dead boss in borderlands isn't felt anywhere throughout the game, whereas I was suggesting a game type wherein your buddy completes the ""find the spirit stone"" quest while you're completing the ""stop the assassination"" quest, and now, as a result, your friend keeps summoning new spirits into the world that must be destroyed while you only got a better sword, so the impact is felt by other players, depending on the intended scope of any particular quest."

I'd love to have a stable of heroes  I've customized that I can choose from a launcher and then select a game mode. Horde, siege, dungeons, pvp from king of the hill to capture the flag. 3rd person, with combat leaning towards action rather than tab targeting. A casual and ranked version of each mode so my necro specced defensive hero can show off his siege-mode dominance and my dwarf gunslinger can enjoy horde mode without any pressure. It could be payed for with micro transactions for costume customization.  An mmorpg is never going to make me feel like the only hero in the world or even a particularly important one. I don't want to kill 40 bears before I can fight the lich king; let me just fight the lich king. If devs don't think there'd be enough content to keep it interesting, allowing players to create content would be a great answer, similar to what neverwinter did. Let someone make a 1 - 20 man dungeon and tuck it away a bit. You can have popular ones in a rotation and the rest under some other tab, tucked out of the minds of the casual public so they're not overwhelmed.  Instead of getting ""progress"" from killing a million mobs and then getting stuck at the end game of a few raids, get progress from a deep skill tree and character customization. We can get new raids as often as any other game, but the ""filler"" would be the oft-neglected game modes other mmo's neglect. Mazes, platforming, challenges, achievements, horde, tower defense, seige, pvp out the wazoo... there's so much more room to actually play the game if you just cut some of the excess tediousness."

The problem with 'Skyrim/Oblivion/FO3 online' is essentially performance I think. I think everyone would like a ""somewhat massive"" first person rpg, but it would cost a lot to run server-wise. So you'd either be looking at a costly subscription or some aggressive monetization. That's my theory why nobody is making this sort of game anyway: the risk/dev costs are too large for uncertain return. I sure would like it done."

I mean, it's probably not impossible, but if you are thinking of running on people's PC's, severe limitations would have to be introduced in terms of numbers of objects etc to maintain acceptable performance. Also, developing this game is a lot more costly than developing the single player version. That may not be such an issue for dedicated servers but then they need a recurring income which is problematic as I said.   In fact, I'd be happy with very simple physics/graphics to make it happen, essentially 'Morrowind online', but I know it might not do well commercially, I don't think the major devs are interested in developing this kind of game. It is the worst of both words for them: no huge income from silly monetization, high dev costs, high server costs. But yes, it would be glorious."

But can make my mark in other ways while the heroes are off getting killed?  I envision a MMO (or even a singleplayer game with NPC heroes) with ah economy to support the existence of traveling traders. tradesmen plying their trade in whatever town they set up shop. Magic adepts who choose to focus on brewing and selling potions or enchantments. This might be a dangerous enough world that you might want to hire protection if you're traveling from town to town.   Finding a town near ""Death Mountain"" is a great place to start a shop where the next Dirk Goldsword needs provisions before he goes off for wealth, treasure and fame.  NPCs would be adaptive rather than static. In the absence of a PC they might start up a trade route keeping a remote town stocked. there might be a challenge to setting up shop somewhere because of an established NPC.   My perfect MMO(or again NPC heroes)would be one where be it space sim or fantasy, allows the player to actually choose what they want to try to do, where the crafting is complex enough that not everyone can do it just as not everyone is skilled enough for combat. Where the economy and NPC system is robust enough to support these crafts.  I would play this so hard. I have spent so many hours already in the X series of space sims as a trader already, wishing for more interactivity or dynamic environments."

pcgaming,3dv6zx,HaroldSax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:45:43 2015 UTC,"I've thought about my perfect game and/or MMO-ish experience for a long time so this is going to be an extremely long post. But to put it simply, I'd like a mixture of TERA, Witcher 3, Vindictus, and Dark Souls 1/2, with the utmost emphasis on player freedom.  Witcher 3-ish open world environments. Organic shapes but a realistic (smaller/compact) sense of scale as opposed to TERA and most MMOS with huge flat/open areas. A dirt path should be the width of two horses with obstacles just outside the path, not 10 wide with another 30-40 of flat open space. I'm much more a fan of small and dense, as opposed to vast and empty. I don't really care weather the world is completely seemless or weather you fast travel between areas, I just want whatever allows a ton of variety. TERA has a TON of unique environments and art assets for days particularly in the forest-ish areas, but as I mentioned before it suffers from stretching as if areas where meant to hold hundreds of players at once along with a gigantic boss monster for each of them, in most areas of the game.   I'd want world instancing to allow for few players to appear at once outside of a designated party or pvp mode, thus allowing for responsive combat. For example, something like the main hub area of TROVE can drop the framerate dramatically and introduce huge amounts of server lag. Even though that's expected considering their services are having issues, at the exact same time you can go into the regular game world with you and a few players in the immediate area and not get any of that rubber-banding lag at all. For designated dungeons I'm fine with single party instancing there, where the open-world would be more dynamic with how it spawns and despawns other players not in your party or friends list. I'm fine with not seeing most of the players playing in the same area, if it allows for more responsive combat. And for that combat, I'd want mostly slow and deliberate player and enemy attacks with a reasonable level of telegraphing. Dark Souls-ish movement, with less emphasis on locking on. Dark Souls and it's predecessors were designed from minute one for a controller, where the player wasn't expected to have control of the camera a majority of the time, and thus it needed the lock-on system. With a game made primarily for mouse and keyboard, aiming the mouse handles attack direction. You can still have full on dark-sould lock-on, as that would allow players to play with controller, but the important thing is that attacks don't auto-target while not locked on (Witcher 3 auto-targets and auto-moves often ignoring player input and certainly camera direction, but only when enemies are in range), and that attacks go in the direction of the camera. You can make it like a 3rd person shooter where the player character is always in-line with the camera direction when their weapon is out, but it's largely irrelevant as long as the attacks are directed properly. This kind of system would work fantastically for both ranged and melee combat styles, on both controller and mouse, though mouse would have the advantage. TERA largely works like this already, but it doesn't have the dark souls camera lock-on system.  I don't really want what traditionally comes with an MMO these days. So many games focus on EXTREMELY long progression systems and choices that lock you out of things. Many use F2P systems that lock your options even further unless you pay exorbitant amounts of money for nonsense that has nearly no value compared to any traditional game release. This is going to sound crazy and hardcore fans of mmos like WOW and such will disagree, but I want the ability to cheat, but not in the way that you think. I don't want an online-only experience, I want a full priced experience that I can play entirely offline, but connect to and play with other players if I so choose. I want there to be absolute maximum values for characters, level/stat/item wise, but no restrictions on how you attain such stats offline. If anyone remembers Fable 2, think sort of like that. You could max out your experience and money through all sorts of methods offline, and then you could go online and play with friends. For online connectivity, don't allow ""cheaters"", absolutely. (I don't really know whether outright hacking online was a thing in Fable 2, but you get my point) Anti-hacking is absolutely alright in my book, but don't restrict what people can do offline in any way. I have a way to solve this. Give a command console that has free reign offline. Set damage to 50 billion, god mode, whatever you want, but if that person enables online while on that edited character/experience, simply give the option to chop off (permanently or temporarily, both would work) all of the values above the official maximums. Limit the online experience to exactly as intended, while allowing players offline to do whatever they want to their characters, syncing when they go online again up to the maximum official values but never above. If my friends and I want to play X character new we've never touched before, with all the best items at max level, going through the hardest dungeons in the game, online together, why shouldn't we be allowed to do that? Time and time again about mmos I've heard people say that the ENTIRE POINT of such games was purely to grind and farm for upgrades, but that sounds like a shitty game to me. Sludging through monotonous content purely to unlock stats. Why not design a game that people actually outright want to play? (Dark Souls games are extremely difficult and punishing for most players, and many play it anyway simply because the world is so interesting and every second of the combat feels incredible) Why not do some actual fucking work and design fun things to see and do? But here's the thing, I know there are people that DO enjoy chasing upgrades and action/reward loops, and for them, they can have that with this system, inside of a satisfying and enjoyable game taboot. Yes, instant effortless unlocks are right around the corner if they ever want to change up their experience, but that shouldn't diminish their satisfaction of achieving things on their own. I've seen those same people lose their minds when they get scammed or their character hacked/reset, and with this system that's not even a possibility as anything could be restored freely. This whole system doesn't allow for boosts or microtransaction based currencies, so it's best as a full priced experience. Expansions over time however would be totally fine, as long as the main game is a relatively complete experience especially in terms of story."
pcgaming,3dv6zx,wronghead,2,Mon Jul 20 02:56:20 2015 UTC,"The style of game I'm thinking of doesn't make this easy, but it's been done before in a few MMOs. Player housing. Guess what happens when you remove all the unlocking and grinding from something so dependent on creativity? People go wild and make all sorts of cool and interesting things, because they have no restrictions and all of the tools and components available to them from minute one. If you've ever been in the world of Minecraft, you'll know that the speed at which people can work and the end product change drastically for the better going from a pure survival experience to a creative experience. And this fits into the offline unlocking system I mentioned earlier. Players who want to earn every piece and design their house as they go can do that as they progress through the game's content, but others with more ambitious ideas can click a checkbox offline and unlock every tool and component to design to the limit of the systems right away. The unlock progression and house design could sync just as the character stats would when toggling to online. Again, player housing is an obscenely complicated thing to implement thought it has been done in 3D games like wildstar, archage, and skyrim, it wouldn't be truly necessary for the game I'm thinking of.  I want the freedom to do what I want, whenever I want, with whom I want, with a progression system available to me should I or any other player want it, but one that's never forced on me. An offline capable game with online multiplayer functionality. Limited players in with me for a more responsive experience, but no limit on who those people are, so that a friend that just bought the game can play with me in any area of the game, right away. Game save files are largely lists of 1 and 0s for what you've completed and what you haven't, so there's no reason why it wouldn't be possible to force that on a per character basis via a basic in-game interface. Oh my friend is level 45 at the 8th area of the game? Create character, check all main and sub-boxes between 1 and 8, set level to 45 and add basic lvl 45 equipment. Toggle online, sync to server, done. I'm up and playing a brand new character with a friend in a late game area. I skipped tons of content, and whether I've never done it before or have 20 times already is irrelevant, and I can go straight to having fun doing what I want. I'm so done with the nonsense mentality of ""NO, you have to spend hundreds of hours EARNING the right to play content you already paid for, or you can pay us an exorbitant amount of real money to skip it or make the process faster"". It's fucking ridiculous, when the entire purpose of most games is to enjoy your free time. If you want to grind and unlock, you can do that in this system. If you want to skip straight to X and then to G, and then over to Z, you can do that with this system. It's immense player freedom without allowing hacking that could in any way harm the experience of other players. This will never happen because for as long as I can remember, game designers copy older games, and unskippable or pay2skip progression systems are almost universal these days. Greed is all over this industry, and when that has no effect the entitled notion of players having to earn developers work through play does the rest, even if ""earning"" the good content requires playing-through shitty and/or monotonous content for far too long. Some players want to achieve something from beginning to end as intended, but why should that be the ONLY way to experience it. In many titles, freedom is unlocked after completion of the game, so why not give that freedom at the start? Especially considering there are countless cases where someone has completed something on another save or on another platform, and those freedoms are yet again locked away arbitrarily from the exact person who already achieved such things, possibly numerous times before. I've seen players outright refuse to buy and/or play games a second time, or even go back to them, because the lack of freedom forces them to re-do things they don't want to do, to get to the content they do. And for what? Most of these games don't even have micro-transactions, so they're losing sales and interest in the game, upsetting the player and limiting their freedoms, for absolutely no reason at all, or shameless entitlement.  I both love and hate modern game design and the state of the industry. Such cool ideas and concepts, combined with anti-consumer bullshit, out of ignorance and/or greed. I just don't understand it. Imagine if when you bought an album/movie/book/comic/manga/tv-boxset/etc, you absolutely had to listen/read/watch the first sections multiple times if not even just once, in order to unlock the right view/listen to any other portion of that content... Consider the insanity and question why that EXACT scenario is so commonplace in videogames, especially on consoles where outside manipulation is largely impossible. Project CARS is one of the few titles I can recall to get it right recently. Zero unlocking, any car on any track with any parameters (excluding only large cars on cart tracks, but the reverse works fine), from minute one. Assetto Corsa is the same way (+ modded custom full cars and tracks) though it hasn't gotten a full multiplatform release yet."

pcgaming,3dvxko,sintheticreality,11,Mon Jul 20 01:25:33 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if the walk around concept will win.
pcgaming,3dvxko,SAM-000,15,Mon Jul 20 00:12:56 2015 UTC,"It's an optional feature. Vive will still work fine for games designed sitting in a chair. Being able to move around does increase immersion that much more though, as people who've tried it have said."
pcgaming,3dvxko,SAM-000,12,Mon Jul 20 00:16:50 2015 UTC,"The problem is that not everyone has the space in their domicile to walk around, even with the supposed small area that's needed."
pcgaming,3dvxko,sintheticreality,7,Mon Jul 20 00:30:42 2015 UTC,"Roomscale will work with a range of room sizes, the maximum is 15ft by 15ft. It'll be dependent on the game, but devs will design around a range of room sizes, since not everyone has the exact same room. Again, it's an optional feature. It will still work sitting down."

pcgaming,3dvxko,SAM-000,2,Mon Jul 20 15:58:49 2015 UTC,"Room-scale is optional.  Also, I never got this argument. I've lived in small apartments and always had plenty of space for something like Vive. Unless you live in a port-a-potty or are a hoarder, you should be fine."
pcgaming,3dvxko,Ryan_Fitz94,5,Mon Jul 20 01:25:12 2015 UTC,I have a small office where my computer is. It's quite cramped.
pcgaming,3dvxko,sintheticreality,2,Mon Jul 20 02:21:30 2015 UTC,You either don't know the definition of small or don't own a single piece of real furniture.
pcgaming,3dvxko,DisplayNameIsInUse,2,Mon Jul 20 09:53:36 2015 UTC,"Lived in small one-bedroom apartment, fully furnished. Always had space in front of the TV to at least walk a few feet in any direction. How do you people not live in domiciles where you have space to walk around just a few feet? Are you kidding me? lol  How do you people live if you literally can't walk around in your living spaces? I don't buy it.  I don't think you people understand the definition of room-scale, either. It doesn't mean a large empty room dedicated exclusively to VR. It means you can stand and take 2-3 steps in any direction. That's all."
pcgaming,3dvxko,LazyGit,2,Mon Jul 20 14:13:09 2015 UTC,"This is the pink elephant in the room at the moment for the Lighthouse tracking. My feeling on it is that only certain games will make use of the room scaling feature as the defacto movement mechanic (Such as the Portal/shipwreck demos).   We will probably see a lot of games that use it to just track your hands/arm/head and to some extent body movement. I don't think you are going to be seeing 1:1 scaling for huge game enviroments without some clever movement mechanic or a controller/keyboard to ""Cheat"" your position in the game once you hit a wall. Unless we are talking about a buttload of Lighthouses and a big empty warehouse somewhere.   More realisticially games may use a secondary movment mechanic, like a map/teleportation type thing. But even then you will constantly have to be ""resetting"" your real-life position to 0,0 in the room otherwise you are going to be hitting walls.   Maybe only certain areas in the game will trigger the 1:1 scaling. Or games built around the 1:1 scaling will have correctly sized enviorments. Or make use of another mechanic such as a map/teleporation type thing."
pcgaming,3dvxko,Jikolpl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:01:31 2015 UTC,"This isn't an elephant in the room. I don't understand what it is that makes people latch onto an additional feature of a product, decide that the feature is not all it's cracked up to be then dismiss the entire product as a result. The same thing happened with the nVidia Shield. It is a fantastic Android tablet in its own right at a good price point but, because it can also play games, people have dismissed it as a 'gaming tablet' that nobody really needs.  The Lighthouse tracking can enable you to move around a room which is already groundbreaking and a major differentiator to the Rift. But just because that feature might not be implemented by many developers doesn't change the fact that the Lighthouse technology also improves head tracking when seated. There won't be anything that the Rift can do that the Vive can't."
pcgaming,3dvxko,Nintendrone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:04:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I still don't know how it would work in a game like Skyrim, where you need to walk in a straight line for a while, but only have a room to work with. Walk to the wall, turn around walk to the wall 10 times? Don't know how they're going to make that work."
pcgaming,3dvxko,King_Burgers,6,Mon Jul 20 04:03:25 2015 UTC,"You can mix controls. Running or ridding a hourse will have you stand still and move with buttons/stick, but when you need to walk slowly or examine small area/indoors it'll switch to Roomscale. Or modify the mechanics. All VR games need to be designed specially for VR. An unofficial VR mod for any game won't be optimal."
pcgaming,3dvxko,Laboe,10,Mon Jul 20 04:31:38 2015 UTC,"Having used the DK2, CB and Vive, I can say confidently that so far the best VR experience was with Vive's amazing demos.  However, the best gaming experience I've had in VR in general is definitely Windlands for the Rift. Elite: Dangerous is a close second."
pcgaming,3dvxko,grinr,6,Mon Jul 20 07:07:17 2015 UTC,"This is why I'm against marketing directors. It was obvious he didn't care much, if at all, for gaming. I'd bet it would be different if they had interviewed the engineering director in charge of the headset.   Call me crazy, but I don't think his live-action BS is going to be a bigger hit than truly immersive gaming. Gaming already rakes in a lot more cash than either movies or sports. Gaming apps on the playstore and on the iOS app store account for 66-70% of the revenue.  I wouldn't be surprised, nor should anyone else, if that relationship holds for VR as well. Sure, it'd be interesting to see a concert or sports event in VR, but you are still a passive observer in such a scenario.  And that excites this guy? LMFAO."
pcgaming,3dvxko,me_on_the_left,5,Mon Jul 20 05:39:55 2015 UTC,"I think you may be underestimating the market for passive 3D stereoscopic 360 experiences.  The baseball example is a really good one, but really any event could have a remote installation that would give you the same experience.  Burning man without the dust, Bonnaroo, Coachella, any sporting event (and that's a big market), air shows (Blue Angels only you're in the cockpit), undersea safaris, you name it.  Gaming is important, but so is passive entertainment and vectoring for both of them is good for all of us."

pcgaming,3dvxko,magic3383,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:05:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not understanding VR right now, as far as gaming is it HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Steam's VR competing? Are there some for watching TV, I believe Oculus has one. What was it that Facebook bought?"
pcgaming,3dvxko,LiquidAurum,5,Mon Jul 20 04:10:50 2015 UTC,HTC/Valve are the same thing in VR. Vive. Facebook bought Oculus Rift.

pcgaming,3dvxko,LiquidAurum,3,Mon Jul 20 04:40:10 2015 UTC,Facebook completely own Oculus. You know how Facebook owns Instagram? Just like that.
pcgaming,3dvxko,Mundicider,11,Mon Jul 20 04:40:38 2015 UTC,"HTC Vive is SteamVR. That is to say, HTC Vive is the hardware and SteamVR is the software it runs on. The Vive is a collaboration of Valve and HTC.  Oculus is what Facebook bought yes. It'll be targeting gaming and more casual multimedia usage, because Facebook. It sort of creeps me out since Facebook owns it (privacy concerns) and they're doing the console-like practice of paying devs to make games exclusive.  Vive is targeting primarily PC gamers, but also multimedia on the side. The headset has near identical specs to the Oculus Rift. The biggest feature over Oculus is the ability to freely move around in a larger space (Roomscale) and that it ships with a pair of highly accurate motion controllers. Since Valve's partnering, if you want Steam integration, this will be the one to get. Valve also pushing for an cross-hardware API called OpenVR, so if you like open markets, support the Vive."
pcgaming,3dvxko,TheBoozehammer,2,Mon Jul 20 04:25:08 2015 UTC,What advantage does oculus have?
pcgaming,3dvxko,stickler_456,6,Mon Jul 20 04:29:47 2015 UTC,"It may be lighter in weight (Vive dev kit heavier than confirmed Oculus consumer version) but we haven't seen Vive consumer yet, and Vive consumer will have resigned ergonomics so we don't know for sure.  Oculus will be a bit cheaper, but it doesn't come with those high quality motion controllers in the box, and motion controls in VR really do work. Vive will also release first so early adopter tax I guess.  Oculus will also have quite a few exclusives (several devs were paid with that Facebook money to make games exclusive, not a consumer-friendly act), but the Vive has exclusives too.  Those are the significant ones."
pcgaming,3dvxko,internet_man_415,10,Mon Jul 20 04:39:26 2015 UTC,"That kind of sucks, exclusives. It's like console for PC :("
pcgaming,3dvxko,mcochran1998,6,Mon Jul 20 05:12:40 2015 UTC,I'm sure someone will work out how to get games on both devices.
pcgaming,3dvxko,XIII1987,2,Mon Jul 20 10:12:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as long as the hardware is similar enough, I imagine there will be drivers or something for Vive to mimic a Rift, and probably vice versa to an extent at least."
pcgaming,3dvxko,RealHumanHere,-13,Tue Jul 21 08:22:56 2015 UTC,Maybe don't push your personal agenda on people deciding if the want to buy a Vive or a Rift. Seems a bit fanboyish and sad don't you think? Do you work for HTC?
pcgaming,3dvxko,sintheticreality,8,Mon Jul 20 06:14:21 2015 UTC,What was he being a fan of? I'd have described it the same way.

pcgaming,3dvxko,LazyGit,7,Mon Jul 20 14:58:35 2015 UTC,"Id buy the vive aswell for compatability. Open vr (api)  is being used by a few different headsets (starbreezes headset is so pd3 will be openvr), so to predict the future, id say more people are going to support that api over oculus as the marketshare of that api will be the biggest and easier to optimise for.   AAA devs will probably optimise for oculus and openvr but most small studios/indies might only have the resources and time to optimise for one so its the choice,  optimise for 90% of the different headsets or optimise for one headset.   But thats just the way i feel about it......  What do you think?"
pcgaming,3dvxko,sintheticreality,5,Mon Jul 20 06:50:42 2015 UTC,Are you palmer luckey? What has he said that's not true? Name ONE thing.
pcgaming,3dvxko,LazyGit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:44:31 2015 UTC,"I guess if Oculus does have an advantage, it's that VR is their only business, unlike Valve/HTC and Sony, who have their fingers in other industries. VR is all Oculus does so they'll focus on creating the absolute best hardware as well as funding and distributing the best VR apps, video content and games made specifically for virtual reality.  Basically, all of Oculus's money is invested in VR and only VR(well, AR, too, as future headsets are rumored to have AR functionality)."
pcgaming,3dvxko,sintheticreality,2,Mon Jul 20 17:48:28 2015 UTC,"You could just as easily make the case that the other companies other divisions will help.  Valve: Games development and distribution HTC: Phone manufacturing (comes in handy considering the meat of VR is in the mobile phone displays, gyros, and accelerometers), and marketing. Sony: Hardware manufacturing, games development and distribution, Film production, Marketing, Established hardware base of 24M+  None of these things appear to be a hindrance to me."
pcgaming,3dvxko,LazyGit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:56:10 2015 UTC,"Also, and correct me if I'm wrong, but all of those companies probably have their own decisions teams completely for VR. I don't see how different that is from Oculus just being a part of Facebook now, although I suppose they could be a little more autonomous."
pcgaming,3dvxko,sintheticreality,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:26:01 2015 UTC,"True, but for a gamer, the Vive has the advantage because it's developed by Valve who own the Steam platform and a back catologue of games that you know are going to be compatible from day one. As far as I'm concerned, the purchase price of the Vive is going to be worth it just for Valve's games."
pcgaming,3dvxko,sintheticreality,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:15:08 2015 UTC,"It's a moot point for me because I'm getting a Vive and Rift. I'm curious to see how each company pursues content.  As far as a back catalogue, none of those games are made FOR VR. However, some have VR support of varying quality.  I'm more interested in the games made exclusively for the Vive/VR that require an HMD and don't have support tacked on there as another bullet point."
pcgaming,3dvxko,NiscoRacing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:01:03 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I'm expecting more gaming content to be produced by Valve and their partners, of the sort that I would be interested in, than by Oculus and Facebook."
pcgaming,3dvxko,Dark-Union,2,Tue Jul 21 13:13:33 2015 UTC,"That remains to be seen. We'll have to wait and see. HTC/Valve are showing the final consumer version of the Vive in October, along with a slate of games. Oculus is producing over two dozen games for the Rift for launch.  In short, we won't have a shortage of VR games/apps/movies to enjoy on launch for any of these headsets.  To be honest, I'm less interested in ""games"" as we currently know them, for VR. I just want them to give me cool places to visit virtually."
pcgaming,3dvxko,Danisnotonavan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:20:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a difficult thing to predict. I'm almost certainly going to get the Vive because I think it's going to offer a better experience as well as better games but I suspect that Facebook are going to do a better job than HTC/Valve of getting additional content like that described by the HTC exec."
pcgaming,3dvxko,Danisnotonavan,2,Tue Jul 21 13:33:02 2015 UTC,"I'm converting my garage into a ""holodeck"" and building a new rig for this. I'm really looking forward to room-scale VR with the Vive but I'm also looking forward to the content Oculus will be putting out. There are some VR movies in development by their Story Studio that look revolutionary."
pcgaming,3dvxko,Danisnotonavan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:38:10 2015 UTC,"Virtual reality is a medium. You'll use it for gaming, watching movies made both in 2D for cinemas and filmed for VR; you'll also use it for communication(think of it as 360-degree 3D Skype), for fitness, tourism, .etc.  It's a technology, but also an art form and delivery system for content of all types."
pcgaming,3dvnlc,pablokemp,32,Sun Jul 19 22:26:28 2015 UTC,Wolfenstein the New Order was fantastic.  Just finished it myself and absolutely loved it.

pcgaming,3dvnlc,TaintedSquirrel,2,Mon Jul 20 03:29:31 2015 UTC,"IMO, I thought Fear 2 was a solid entry if not quite as good as the original. The story suffered, and the gameplay was more consolized (guns in the first game felt amazing). But I thought the good scares were there for the most part (the scattered times Alma appears right behind you are some of the best scares in the series, I missed all of them on my first playthrough I think). The elementary school and hospital in particular.   FEAR 3 was total crap though in my opinion. Not scary at all, and just added way too many elements that made it not feel like a FEAR game in the slightest. FEAR 2 at least felt like a continuation of the first game for the most part, albeit a more console-like version.   I need to replay the original again sometime, it's been awhile. Such a classic fun game."

pcgaming,3dvnlc,jinyx1,45,Tue Jul 21 05:57:56 2015 UTC,"Here is a list of all the games i've played and enjoyed because of story and/or gameplay. The list is alphabetical.   Arma 3 - Fantastic game for very realistic military shooter. Mods and Scenarios lets you play a variety of different style of games. Me and my friends love playing Escape from Altis Bioshock Series - All of the games are great Borderlands 2 - Pretty good game on solo but tons of fun in multiplayer. Call of Juarez Series - Stories are okay, the games a pretty fun Condemned: Criminal Origins - Really great horror game, graphics are a bit dated but its still a really fun game, story is pretty decent as well. Combat is interesting. Crysis 1 & Warhead - This game is like a playground for FPS fans. Game looks fantastic even in today's standards and the gameplay is superior to every other FPS game I feel. Lets you play however you want to play. The Darkness 2 - Loved the story, game is tons of fun as well. Awesome atmosphere Dead Space Series - First and Second are scary Deus Ex Series - First Game is a masterpiece, Human Revolution is a good game for it's own rights Elder Scrolls Series - Doesn't exactly fit in this list but they have first person view and they are great games F.E.A.R Series - First one is the scariest Fallout 3 & New Vegas - Again doesn't truly belong to this list but fantastic games Far Cry Series - Loved the first one, hated the second one, third one is tons of fun, fourth one also Half Life 2, Episode 1 & Episode 2 - Nothing needs to be said about these games Homefront - At the time this game came out I honestly though it did a better job being COD than COD itself. It was over-the-top and mindless fun Mass Effect Series - Not an FPS but the games are just too good not to suggest Metro 2033 & Last Light - Pretty decent story, fantastic atmosphere, gameplay is pretty good Mirror's Edge - Love the art style, story is okay, gameplay is tons of fun. I start up this game at least once every year as I just love running on the roof tops in the game. Atmosphere is great. Painkiller (The Original) - This game is just tons of fun, there is a minimal story, didn't care for it much. Just wanted to make demons explode into millions gibs. Portal Series - Not a shooter but it needs a mention as they are fantastic games. Prey - This game went completely under the radar for like 95% of the PC industry and its a tragedy! I rank this game very high on my list as it introduced some new mechanics that more recent games just used. It was the first I played that used Portals the way the Portal games use. It had low gravity and gravity walls you can walk upside down on. The story was fantastic. Its the only game I've seen that has a native american as the main character and its not just a gimmick they used the native american culture and beliefs into the foundation of the game, Spirit Walk is sweet and is needed a lot of the times. Graphics are very good for today's standards. Can't say enough good things about this game.  Serious Sam 2 & 3 - These games are amazing. Similar to the past-paced run and gun, no regen, just pickup health and armor style of quake and unreal tournament. I have only played the second and third so those are the ones I can recommend. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Series - These games are the best of what Fallout can be when it comes to trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world. Singularity - This is another game that didn't get enough recognition. This game is a combination of Half Life 2, Bioshock and Timeshift. The Story is okay throughout the game but it picks up at the end and you realize its fucking awesome when the game is over. Gameplay is as good as the Metro games, some really cool time-based combat mechanics. Another game that will always have a special place in my gamer heart. Sniper Elite Series - Story is meh, gameplay is above average. If you like sniping this is a good game to play. Spec Ops: The Line - This game gets a lot of hate and love and I am one of the lovers of this game. Story is fantastic. Gameplay in general is mediocre until you start noticing the context of the gameplay change as you go through the game. I have never seen a game have any aspect of the gameplay change as you go through the game. When I realized what was happening it just blew my mind. Love love LOVE this game. The Stanley Parable - This game has to be mentioned for its story. The Narrator is the best. This game is meta as fuck and anyone knowing that loves the game for it. Had to be mentioned even if this has no combat. System Shock 2 - Another masterpiece, enough said. TimeShift - This is one of the first games I played that used time as a combat mechanic. The graphics are pretty bad for today's standards and the gameplay is okay. I really liked the game for its uniqueness at the time. Wolfenstein: The New Order - One of the best FPS I've played in a long time. Great story, loved the gun-play and the atmosphere was spot on.   Hopefully you guys appreciate this list.

pcgaming,3dvnlc,AoyagiAichou,-4,Mon Jul 20 16:53:20 2015 UTC,"Mirror's Edge, Sniper Elite, Portal, and the Stanley Parable are all FPS.  They play in 1st person, and you shoot things in them.  I can see where you could say Mirror's Edge, Portal and the Stanley parable aren't traditional FPS games since you don't shoot often or do not shoot guns that kill things, but I don't see how the hell you could say that about Sniper Elite that is a traditional FPS game.  I keep forgetting Spec Ops is 3rd person. I only played it once at a friend's. Fallout 3 and New Vegas, however, are still mostly FPS with an RPG element, like Borderlands and an optional 3rd person camera."

pcgaming,3dvnlc,PillowTalk420,0,Mon Jul 20 21:35:43 2015 UTC,Isn't 100% of the gameplay. It's like calling Wolfenstein: The New Order a retro 1st person arcade game because it has a secret Wolfenstein 3D level.  Stanley Parable also includes very little shooting.
pcgaming,3dvnlc,TDuffin,-2,Mon Jul 20 21:42:52 2015 UTC,"Using the same logic, Wolfenstein: The New Order isn't an FPS because you're not shooting 100% of the time; sometimes you have to talk to characters and solve puzzles."

Racing the self-destruct countdown on the Core Ship, defending the turbolaser battery on the derelict Assault Ship, assaulting a bridge on Kashyyyk flooded with droids... all set to a belting score and egged on by some great dialogue.  Gameplay's not too shabby either. A bit of weapon variation wouldn't have gone amiss, but you also get a hyper-vibrating knife that pops out of your wrist and spatters oil all over your visor when you stab a droid. So checkmate."

If the 3rd game had been a few hours longer, it would have been my favourite but it was too short (still worth buying though now that it's cheap).   Some others from my experience: Shadow Warrior, The New order, Bioshock Infinite, Call of Juarez Gunslinger, FEAR 1 and 2 (never played 3), Metro Series, Far Cry 3 (3 and 4 are similar, play 3), and also COD 4.

I came back to it a couple of months ago as i was anticipating Bethesda to announce Fallout 4 at their conference, i easily spent over 100 hours on it in only 2 weeks.

I thought TLOU was 2013 game of the year and Infinite didn't even chart for me, even though many people say they are comparable   Like the best way to put it is I was massively underwhelmed, the twists feels weak because the multiple universes are introduced very early in the game and the game just never really had a strong moment to me, like I've read people say the story was amazing, but to me the story was thread bare and I've played Call of Duty games that better delivered on story   Id like to say I can see why others like it but to me it was just mediocre in design, execution and presentation   I've beat it twice and then I played BioShock for the first time and I think BioShock is better in every way except mouse movement is broken on PC"

pcgaming,3dtx70,TheRonMan,4,Sun Jul 19 16:36:56 2015 UTC,"If you like fighting games, or are looking to get into fighting games, skullgirls is an excellent game. The combo system is easy to pick up and feels pretty marvel-y, with most combos being cancelations and few links, without having touches of death, infinites, or looping combos. Personally i much prefer the IPS system to the hitstun decay system of marvel. Netplay uses GGPO, so it's extremely solid, online is pretty active, albiet a good chunk of the online community is rather high level. The tutorial system is extremely good for new players to learn fighting game basics.  The actual inputs themselves are mostly limited to qc and hc motions, although there are a few srk motions here and there, it's still pretty easy to play on a keyboard or gamepad, although a fightstick is still a preferable option.  Character roster is a bit limited, so i definitely recommend picking up the bundle, but there is good play variety, you have a few rushdown characters, some grapplers, some zoning, some charge characters, a punish character, and then a few gimmick characters. More importantly, unlike most fighters, the majority of the cast could be considered viable, so that's nice."

For a shooter, maybe melee, voice chat (if it's a multiplayer game), grenade (I could see this being helpful when cooking nades). Jump feels fine at the spacebar for me. If you're playing an RPG with a ton of skills/spells, maybe you'll want those mapped there.    Personally, I don't map anything on the extra buttons."

pcgaming,3dwsta,MassSpecFella,2,Mon Jul 20 05:23:28 2015 UTC,"I have a Razer Taipan. It has 2 mouse thumb buttons. I like them but they aren't suited to all functions. They are called  mouse 4 and mouse 5.   I don't like to bind them to a function where I will might accidentally press it cause sometimes I do. Also in likely to hit 4 accidentally while trying to hit 5.   My favorite use is to just bind mouse 5 to quick grenade.   Often games don't allow a rebind to mouse 4 or 5 so I used the Razer software to change them to keyboard G and H.   I use the mouse buttons for marking and executing enemies in Splintercell Blacklist. Or marking enemies in Farcry.   The mouse buttons are bad for melee as you sometimes need to spam melee and they are too fragile for spamming or such frequent use.   Flashlight is a good use for the mouse buttons.   In shadow warrior I had mouse 4 and 5 for sword and uzis because these are the most common weapons and you need them fast. Hunting for 1 and 4 quickly is hard for me. But you can have 2 binds for these in shadow warrior so I left 1 and 4 bound as well.   The mouse buttons are bad for anything that requires you to hold it down while aiming, such as zoom or toggle crouch."

I usually map melee to the ""forward"" arrow or the ""stop"" button which sits between the ""back"" and ""forward"" buttons.  Other than that, it's the standard left click to shoot, right-click for aim/alt fire, wheel to switch weapons.  I avoid setting anything to the middle button as I find pressing it tends to knock the wheel and switch weapons on me.  Everything else lives on the keyboard."

pcgaming,3dugnh,DeniedExistence,19,Sun Jul 19 16:27:33 2015 UTC,"All 'reserving' does is sets windows update to automatically download when they release it. That's it  There will be other ways, including getting a ISO to do a upgrade.  One thing to note though. Unless Microsoft announces some mechanism where you can enter a current key and get a new Windows 10 key issued, you will have to complete the in place upgrade at least once in order for the activation system to see that your current genuine install is valid and record it. Once that is done you can clean install to your hearts content"

pcgaming,3dugnh,bradley129,9,Sun Jul 19 16:37:15 2015 UTC,"You don't have to go through 2 installs. Upgrades are extremely smooth and work out quite well (In all my production systems I have in place upgraded them all from either 7 or 8.1 and they all work fantastically)  But if you want the placebo effect that a clean install provides and you want to maintain your validity, yes you'll have to perform a in place upgrade install, then a clean install.   Or you could use Windows Reset, a feature that was added with Windows 8.x. It works like a soft clean install. erases your system drive/partition and reinstalls a clean version of Windows 10."

pcgaming,3dugnh,DeniedExistence,10,Sun Jul 19 16:58:49 2015 UTC,It's not a placebo when your hard drive has registry errors that can't be cleaned and other problems. Saying that it's a placebo is a stretch. A clean install still can do wonders for a bogged down computer.
pcgaming,3dugnh,bradley129,4,Sun Jul 19 20:28:17 2015 UTC,"Modern Windows upgrade can address those issues. It does not simply import the existing registry, errors and all. It reprocesses it and only things that are current and valid are imported into the upgraded system.  Yes a pure clean install does address issues like that. But overall its not required. The way the setup routine works since windows 8 (as well as the recovery tools it introduced) make upgrading a far more seamless process"

pcgaming,3dugnh,shadow_craft,4,Sun Jul 19 17:29:52 2015 UTC,"The entire upgrade process has been re-written in the time since Vista.  Did you ever run vanilla Windows 8 and then upgrade it to Windows 8.1? It's the same thing. When you do a 8.1 install from 8 it's actually using the same process. Which, for all intents and purposes is a clean install. It just then imports all your data and software. The worse case scenario is you may have to reload a driver or two when it's done"
pcgaming,3dugnh,PillowTalk420,6,Sun Jul 19 17:07:27 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with Denied, I've been using pc's since dos, and I'm an IT tech.  The upgrade process with windows 10 is actually very very well done.  I still prefer a clean install myself, but from a performance and bugginess perspective... it hasn't caused any issues for me, and I believe for most people, it will be perfectly acceptable."
pcgaming,3dugnh,Bill-Rizer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:16:53 2015 UTC,"No. If you installed Windows 10 now, it would just update through Windows Update to the ""released"" version when it comes out. No need to install two times."
pcgaming,3dugnh,abk006,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:08:38 2015 UTC,If you want to do a clean install yes. The update is what will validate your W10 license so you have to do that.   Personally I'm only going to do a clean install if I have a reason to believe there was an issue while using the updated version.

pcgaming,3dugnh,HeDontUseWASD,2,Mon Jul 20 14:45:04 2015 UTC,"Windows 10 users are split into two camps. The first camp is made of those who want to remain in the Windows Insider program. The Insider program will continue after July 29, and Microsoft will continue to use it for beta testing and soliciting end-user feedback. Anyone who sticks with the program will continue to receive a steady series of activated, genuine operating system releases. As with any other Microsoft beta, these updates will be timebombed; after several months, they'll expire. But new versions will be provided long before those timers ever hit.  The second camp is the one that wants to opt out of the Insider program and stick with the stable release on July 29. This group will need a valid Windows 7, 8, or 10 license. Without a suitable license, the operating system will eventually expire. If the Insider builds were installed as an upgrade to Windows 7 or 8, they'll remain activated once they switch to RTM. Microsoft hasn't said what the story is if a clean installation of Windows 10 is performed; we imagine that there will be some way of entering a suitable license key to satisfy the operating system that it's suitably licensed.    http://arstechnica.co.uk/information-technology/2015/06/microsoft-clarification-kinda-clears-up-free-windows-10-license-confusion/"

pcgaming,3dugnh,DielectricEffect,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:17:12 2015 UTC,"I upgraded not long ago and it went through fine. I were concerned about having 'Start is Back' installed and, messing with the new start menu, but only after the upgrade had already began, but no problems there (although I did uninstall it asap after the upgrade).  My other concern was junctions I had created, where I had put a number of games on my SSD, from their standard install path on the HDD, again no issues there.  The only thing that initially annoyed me is I have speakers plugged into the front jack on my tower, and headphones in the rear. After the upgrade my headphones/rear jack did not work. But I found changing the front jack from HD Audio to AC97 fixed it (just as it was prior to the upgrade.  Note after your system is finished upgrading and it seems you can use the system, it is still completing tasks and took me personally, about another 15-20 minutes of waiting for things to finalize before completed. I believe this is due to Windows downloading & installing applications it has deemed 'default' from the windows app store."

You'll have 30 days to activate it and by then u can purchase a copy and just need to activate the os that have already installed with the activation code. Or you can find other/free means of activating it once those become available.  Yes every program and game that I have installed on this build have been compatible on Win 10. Strongly recommend it :)  Good luck & let me know if you have other questions/concerns about it or need help setting up.  P.S. I like a clean/fresh install of new OS which helps eliminate many issues that are present when an upgrade is done instead of a clean install. Back up your files, & do a clean os installation (format the drive) to eliminate any issues in going from and older os/files/registry, malware, viruses, etc etc"
pcgaming,3dugnh,Perunsan,2,Sun Jul 19 18:55:26 2015 UTC,"similar to myself, I had the Win10 ESD from the inside program. So I made an iso as the insider program was finished, and upgrade a second PC. I done the upgrade on a genuine activated Win8.1 PC. No key was requested, nor was activation required.

pcgaming,3dugnh,twenafeesh,3,Sun Jul 19 17:03:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, they have closed off new entries in the desktop insider program for the time being since launch is so close.

pcgaming,3drdx2,Dernom,31,Sat Jul 18 21:20:09 2015 UTC,How? I've not seen the option to change the layout of the start menu significantly.
pcgaming,3drdx2,TheArbitraryUsername,126,Sat Jul 18 21:52:45 2015 UTC,You can remove all of the tiles so it looks much more like the original.  Personally I like the tiles but whatever.
pcgaming,3drdx2,TlailstheFaux,76,Sat Jul 18 22:44:22 2015 UTC,"Same here.  I like the tile layout .  Just not an entire screen of it when using a desktop PC.  Now, on my Surface 3?  It makes more sense."
pcgaming,3drdx2,animeman59,29,Sun Jul 19 00:05:12 2015 UTC,Which is great because there is an option to make it full screen if that's what the user prefers.

I might just install Classic Shell like I did with my 8.1 tablet and use that as it is the full featured Windows 7 style menu.

The Win8 start menu isnt that bad, the thing is its this huge menu filling your whole screen with these bigass weird tiles instead of the default, much more functional start menu. Win8 start menu is obviously designed with mobiles/tablest/notebooks in mind."
pcgaming,3drdx2,DJ-PamParam,6,Sat Jul 18 23:47:36 2015 UTC,"Point is, since whenever you use the Start menu, you're totally focused on it, so it's not actually deterring you, in fact it provides more info due to being able to fill the whole screen."

pcgaming,3drdx2,xxfay6,85,Sun Jul 19 01:32:47 2015 UTC,That's because Windows 10 is built upon the foundation of Windows 8.1  A lot of people just want a reason to make it look bad because of biases.  Windows 10 has had much more rigorous testing than any major OS release before it and every single update of Windows 10 is going to be tested the same way.

pcgaming,3drdx2,Six_O_Sick,27,Sat Jul 18 21:10:28 2015 UTC,"You should probably clarify that statement a little.   RTM by definition is the final build in the development process. It is the one that they will be rolling out to everyone starting on the 29th.   That said, it's just the beginning. Microsoft is going to continue iterating on the OS for the foreseeable future, and if they do point releases (IE 10.1, 10.2, etc) the build number will likely increment (as it did with Windows 8 to 8.1). But that's a minor quibble.  Point is, 10240 is the release the world will be getting"
pcgaming,3drdx2,DeniedExistence,6,Sat Jul 18 23:18:33 2015 UTC,So it is suitible to use as a main OS now. Been having a bunch of issues with Win8 lately (among others the inability to upgrade to 8.1).
pcgaming,3drdx2,Dernom,4,Sat Jul 18 21:41:47 2015 UTC,its been suitable for the last few months but yes its now ready for public standard. The newest build has run pretty perfectly for me
pcgaming,3drdx2,zaviex,9,Sun Jul 19 00:36:39 2015 UTC,What would you say really edges it out over 8.1?
pcgaming,3drdx2,Bill-Rizer,29,Sat Jul 18 20:15:40 2015 UTC,"Not OP but I love the start menu and cortana, the start menu is really just the 7 one with live tiles and customizable size, which is great for me (I hate desktop icons.) Cortana is actually a pretty good search function for your PC files, I minimized its search bar to just an icon in the task bar and I use it to search for files a lot. I also enjoy using Edge but I am longing for some of my extensions from Firefox.   Overall it's worth it to me to upgrade, any changes it makes are easy to adapt to and are arguably better than their 7 or 8 counterparts."

pcgaming,3drdx2,RyanB_,2,Sun Jul 19 01:24:06 2015 UTC,Are they any different from software you could download from another other location now? What differentiates them?
pcgaming,3drdx2,jlitwinka,14,Sat Jul 18 23:32:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, the new start menu is a big improvement over 8.   I thought Cortana would be gimmiky, but it's actually been really useful. I work from home, and I'm constantly making little to-do lists and reminders throughout the day. Today I did some work and used Cortana to speak reminders into my computer (e.g. ""remind me to do xxxx at 4pm""). I can already tell that's going to help my productivity, because I don't really need to leave anything to type or write down a reminder anywhere.  I LOVE the Task View ability, which is just a rip from what Apple has been doing for years, but I love that it's officially made it into Windows (I used hacked in versions before this), and I find I can be more quickly switch to apps I have open with it.  Also, FINALLY mouse scroll works when the cursor is over any window without needing to click the window. Also something that Apple has been doing for years, and something I used 3rd party software for for years, but it works very well in 10.  Finally, game performance seems at least as good as 8.1, but I'm noticing that game ""feel"" a lot more fluid and responsive, even if fps are significantly different or higher. Not sure if it's a perception thing, but I think the better engineered driver system is letting components talk to each other more efficiently. I dunno.  Lots of other little things. It's really a fantastic OS. Well done MS."

Development shops DO NOT want 3 sets of code out there for that as it is not worth their time at that point.  Microsoft created the Azure platform for those developers and this will make it easier for developers to use MS Tools to create apps among all platforms using the Windows 10 base by having that.  It's not just phone home it's them trying to help attract more programming for their OS."

I don't like that MS doesn't let me choose which updates I want to install.   Only the home license is effected by this.   I am also sceptic how this ""Windows-as-a-service""-thing will turn out.   Microsoft recently committed to provide free upgrades to all windows 10 devices for 10 years, like every other windows. The use of 'as a service' by microsoft is misleading. They have said they only mean that windows 10 will receive lots of incremental builds (like service packs but not) for the foreseeable future instead of releasing windows 11 or whatever.  I still recommend you wait and see how the upgrade goes for other people, but so far windows 10 feels better than any version of windows I have used previously."

And on the home edition I can't be sure that the next update won't enable those services again.   I simply don't like the idea of cloud services (or a connected app store) in my operating system.   And it seems that you can only delay the installation of updates in the Pro Edition. You have to agree to an update after 8 months or you can't update anything anymore. I'm not saying that's a problem per se, but I had trouble with automatic updates that replaced my network card driver or messed up the touchpad for a colleague. I'd like to have control over this."

This is necessary and not a problem if you intend to use services like cortana, but I don't want that. The article made it sound that you had to agree to the EULA anyway. If I had the option to deny data collection I would choose that immediately, but I don't think that's possible.   Edit: Found the article. It wasn't the EULA, it's the Privacy Statement.

pcgaming,3drdx2,pinkshirtfedora,56,Sat Jul 18 23:13:26 2015 UTC,"You should not disable the UAC If the computer is used as a daily driver. It's an important security feature which effects many other parts of Windows security, so disabling it will disable a whole lot of your OS safety net. A bad move, really. I haven't run into problems with games and UAC since early Vista times, and even then I just needed to have a separate folder for games outside of Program Files. Which is a good practice for gaming in general.  For a purely gaming machine, sure, go crazy with minimizing resource usage, but let's be real, how many of us really have dedicated gaming desktops which are used only for that purpose?  As for other features you mentioned, I completely agree on disabling anything cloud related. They should only be available for the user to install on will, not there by default. Just don't touch the security side.  Edit: this How To Geek article explains it much better than tired me.  Edit 2: it seems that the poster I originally responded to has a good system in place with multiple layers (further in the comments), so he/she is good to go. I keep this advice up still, because many users mistake these different configurations for something they should use without further thinking about the whole picture.  TL;DR: disabling UAC is a myth dating back to XP -> Vista transition and was a part of anti-Vista circlejerk. It provides no benefits, but disables many important aspects such as registry virtualization and application sandboxing outside of that ""annoying"" prompt which is in a form or another daily business in Linux. As many IT myths, it simply won't die."

pcgaming,3dujxc,KotakuSucks2,6,Mon Jul 20 09:13:36 2015 UTC,"While thats true, it can't be denied that you can get a general sense of what they value by looking at what they consider the best games around.  What impression do I get from that list?  That they value spectacle over substance and that they don't know what makes a story-focused game worthwhile.  If I find their top 100 so repugnant, its safe to say I'm not going to find their reviews especially valuable."
pcgaming,3dujxc,Partyintheattic,0,Sun Jul 19 19:00:38 2015 UTC,"Mass Effect is all flash, no depth.  They push choice and consequence so fucking hard in these games, you'd think it would be a central design tenet.  Unfortunately its simply not the case, for the most part your choices amount to a slightly different number on the galaxy readiness screen and maybe an e-mail if you're lucky and that's it.  The games are all about making it look like you have a meaningful choice to make when really you don't.  Not to mention that ME2 really pushed hard to establish Cerberus as this morally gray organization that can get shit done but pushes a questionable humanity first agenda... only to completely abandon any semblance of moral ambiguity in the sequel by making their leader more evil than Snidely Whiplash.  Its that complete disconnect from game to game that ruins the plot, ME1 has nothing to do with ME2, ME2 has nothing to do with ME3.  I could babble on and on about their idiotic choices though, Mass Effect is just an easy series to gripe about and they chose ME2, an extremely flawed game, as their best game of all time.  Even Alpha Protocol is better than ME2 and Alpha Protocol is a broken, unfun mess of a game but it completely nails the choice and consequence that people pretend Mass Effect is all about.  Skyrim is barely playable without mods, its boring with an awful plot, what few things Oblivion did well (faction and quest writing) are completely absent and the big new features, the radiant AI and radiant quests are completely broken and unfun.  Bioshock is a mediocre knock off of System Shock 2 that feels like you're walking through molasses the whole game.  XCOM was completely dumbed down and scripted, with none of the flair that made the original so great.  Team Fortress 2 has been thoroughly ruined for a long time now, I'd say since 2010.  Dark Souls is fun but its nothing special, it has nice build customization and nice environments but the game completely falls apart halfway through with the Tomb of the Giants in particular being one of the worst levels I've ever seen.  For every decent choice in the list (Deus Ex, Half-Life 2) there are 5 awful choices.  I don't mean to call all of these games necessarily awful, Bioshock isn't awful, XCOM isn't awful, but they are so bland and uninteresting that the only reason one could have for picking them as your greatest of all time over their predecessors is that you value graphical fidelity more than strong gameplay or writing.  I'm of the inclination though that if you release a list of the ""best games of all time"" and it includes a game less than 4 or 5 years old, you're a complete idiot, you can't judge something against the past without giving yourself time to reflect on it and maybe revisit it."

pcgaming,3duvkw,BarelyLegalAlien,3,Sun Jul 19 18:29:19 2015 UTC,"Dolby Headphone is usually what the technology is called, and it does take a 5.1 (potentially 7.1 like on the Xonar cards) and convert it into a sound stage on a pair of headphones.  You can actually hear the differences in the various different implementations in this youtube video comparing them  Personally I find SBX to work best for me and it out does the DirectX default one that is available when a game uses headphone mode. The annoying thing is that many games don't expose enough of the sound API to really set it up properly, so in a lot of cases you have to either mess about with the config files or alternatively not be able to get to the full possibilities for how to set the sound up. But most games will output to 5.1 if that is what your sound device is and then your Dolby headphone implementation will simulate those 5 speakers place around you."

pcgaming,3dstqv,Damuel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:39:10 2015 UTC,You know you can modify your character animation right? No one's using vanilla animations around. My suggestion for you is to install every mod suggested by realvision ENB (around 40 of them) here including realvision ENB: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30936/? That's only the start of course. After that you have to really research your mods. But it's a good start none the less.
pcgaming,3dstqv,happycamperjack,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:18:54 2015 UTC,"What animation mods are you using that look good? Yes, there are mods for the animations, but I've never seen any that actually make notable improvements.   I've played modded Skyrim plenty, it still doesn't look that much better than even normal modded Crysis 1. And I'd maintain games like GTA 5, Crysis 3, Battlefield 4 (MGS 5 and Starcitizen though MGS isn't out yet and SC is still in alpha). All without mods look better than any modded Skyrim I've seen.

pcgaming,3dstqv,Damuel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:37:32 2015 UTC,"So how many of those suggested mods by Realvision ENB did you install? As for the animations, you can pretty much replace any animation you want. Anything from jumping, idling, combating, really anything. I have every single one of those game you've described. I still think ultra modded skyrim looks better than them. Crysis 3 is probably a close second, but there are some ugly textures, possibly remnants of console textures making it a notch down from skyrim IMO. GTAV's characters models are so low in poly that's just slightly better than vanilla skyrim. So nah."
pcgaming,3dstqv,happycamperjack,9,Mon Jul 20 06:20:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think you get the issue.

pcgaming,3dstqv,Damuel,2,Mon Jul 20 07:16:41 2015 UTC,"While I think in select games the 12gb may help, VRAM will allocate more if you have more. It doesn't mean it uses it all. I mean 4gb Fury X's and 6gb 980 Ti's perform near identical at 4k, with overclocked 980 Ti's even beating the Titan X."

Yes, the Titan X has the best binned consumer chip currently. But it is the best due to its chip, not its VRAM. The 980 Ti handily shows that VRAM is not a problem, even at 4k."

If these compromises are not made or texture streaming is not implemented perfectly then stuttering or visual anomalies may occur when a discrete graphics card has to keep discarding and reloading textures over the PCI-e bus.  6GB of VRAM should be sufficient to keep up with games released for current consoles. Multi-monitor and higher resolution gaming will eat into free VRAM but 6GB is still a good base line.  To rephrase your question, is there any practical use to having more graphics memory than a 2013 gaming console?"
pcgaming,3dstqv,doneddat,3,Sun Jul 19 13:23:20 2015 UTC,I guess all that huge amount of texture memory is why most console games look like accident in brownie factory.
pcgaming,3dstqv,Tuarceata,-1,Sun Jul 19 14:00:12 2015 UTC,This is approximately equal to the amount of texture VRAM available to the Playstation 4 when you subtract the overhead of the operating system (about 1GB) and a game's working set (about 1GB).   PS4 and Xbone OSes both take up about 3GB. No idea about non-video RAM requirements on games but can't imagine either console can make use of more than 4GB VRAM if even that much.
pcgaming,3dstqv,found-a-universe,2,Sun Jul 19 05:56:44 2015 UTC,"Over the life of the PS3 Sony unlocked more RAM available to developers with firmware updates. I remember this happened for Naughty Dog with Uncharted 2, but here is a general example: 70MB of additional RAM unlocked for PS3 developers Proportionally this is a huge increase in available memory (the PS3 only has 256MB of non-graphics RAM to begin with).  Sony is initially conservative with RAM allocated to developers so older games continue to run as they get a feel for how much the operating system can be streamlined. As they get a better idea for how much RAM the OS needs they are likely to make more RAM available to developers. I think 6GB of graphics-related RAM usage is a good estimate of the long-term VRAM availability to console developers."
pcgaming,3dstqv,BossJ00,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:06:36 2015 UTC,^ This. I wish people would understand this. yes... if we are limited to console textures than no.
pcgaming,3dstqv,TehJohnny,2,Sun Jul 19 03:25:38 2015 UTC,"So you're only leaving the actual game with 1gb ram after the OS and textures? Inc shit AI, physics, sound, music, loading, etc on the is gen of games... But hey at least they'd look purdy. No game is going to use that much vram on a PS4 who can barely push 1080p on most games..."
pcgaming,3dstqv,found-a-universe,-3,Sun Jul 19 03:36:23 2015 UTC,"OpenCL, shaders, physics, etc. may also run on the GPU. If so they still use extra graphics memory.  Of course the rest of a particular game can run in a Gigabyte of RAM. That's four times as much as the PS3.  The reason the PS4 can barely push 1080p at 30Hz on some games is because the CPU is grossly underpowered. The CPU runs at less than half the speed of a PC ethusiast's CPU and the PS4's Jaguar-based CPU also has lower IPC to begin with.  The PS4 has more memory bandwidth (176GB/s) than an Nvidia Geforce GTX 960 (112GB/s). Of course it can push higher-resolution textures than many VRAM-starved high-end PCs."

I never buy games at release day, since if I just wait a while, I get the game on sale for about 15-30 bucks or even cheaper if it finds it's way to a humble bundle.

For me, waiting a little bit for a better price has never been an issue, since I always have a huge backlog I never play.  I suppose it varies from person to person."
pcgaming,3dubzy,Ookamiki,2,Mon Jul 20 22:10:48 2015 UTC,"I would not suggest getting Watch dogs, it still performed badly for me even after all the updates, but if you have nvidia it might be ok. The problem with that sometimes is that you miss out on the mp, I really liked some of the watch dogs mp (tailing people was really cool) I imagine its either dead or ruined by hackers now.

pcgaming,3dubzy,ryugazaki,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:58:18 2015 UTC,"Don't project your expectation of the prequel into the sequel?  I found often times, studio try too hard to duplicate the ""elements"" that make the prequel great in the sequel.  But often have forgotten: 1. audience have changed; 2. competition have changed; 3. the success of the prequels is often due to good timing more than the elements they believe in.  That's why many sequels suck: studio driven by ego and pressure from marketing, mistaking the noise for the signal, develop a game for an audience base that is much smaller than they thought."
pcgaming,3dubzy,plastic17,2,Sun Jul 19 16:41:45 2015 UTC,"Buy them six months after release. By then, the hype has died down, you'll have heard whether the games are any good, they'll be patched up, maybe a bit cheaper and your own hype will have tempered to nothing. Then you'll be pleasantly surprised like you were the first time.  I have a perfectly reasonable rig to play games on, but I'm usually about a year behind on big titles, and I tend to replay much older games in the mean time. For instance, I only played the new Tomb Raider last month and enjoyed it more than I thought I would (bought in sale), and I've been replaying Shadowrun Returns just lately. The whole Arkham Knight debacle and whatever else is going on right now just passes me by like white noise."

A true stealth game in a dying genre, but they got lazy and made the sequel a sequel rather than a spiritual successor. So I might just wait for a GOTY edition.  Xcom I sunk a lot of time into and grid based tactics games are rare these days so I'll bite the bullet and give it a chance. It might burn me but that's life."

No, they pulled the game because they realized this isn't origins and they can't release a steaming pile of shit to stick the customer with because of refunds.

It's a great game, it's just a pity it runs so shit for many other people because now it's tainted forever.  Funnily enough I don't even have a top notch GPU, GTX760, but I do have a top of the line CPU so maybe that explains it to a certain extent.

pcgaming,3dq9kz,My_Post_Is_On_Topic,2,Sat Jul 18 20:18:15 2015 UTC,"You're oversimplifying quite a bit. There are some additions to combat (mostly in terms of enemy types) but yes, for the most part it's untouched because the combat was excellent to begin with, expecting Rocksteady to change the combat is like asking Toyota to reinvent the wheel, you don't fix things that are excellent to begin with. Where the game really evolves is on the city, Gotham is much better than it has ever been, with the constant police chases and whatnot Gotham really feels alive unlike previous games, and it isn't nearly as grindy as Origins or City. I hate how circlejerky this sub is with shitting on this game, yes the performance was/is inexcusable but the game is fantastic, something that people here would get if they played it. Again, I'm not defending the awful performance, but I do contend that the game itself is excellent."

It's very likely that going foward Microsoft will be putting out point releases (like 10.1, 10.2, etc) that will be free for all users (just like service packs were in the past)  When they put out a new point release, the initial support begin date will be pushed forward and final support end date will be later, just as windows 8 vs 8.1"

pcgaming,3dsngy,lulfas,4,Sun Jul 19 01:56:12 2015 UTC,This is extremely common in many MMO game launchers. It helps a ton when the game first comes out or big patches are released.
pcgaming,3dsngy,jordanneff,2,Sun Jul 19 22:49:41 2015 UTC,I did some testing about this since I play this game and I wanted to make sure that the options in the settings actually work.    In the short (very short) period of time that I tested it even with seeding turned on and no bandwidth limitations the launcher was only using .5kB/sec.

pcgaming,3dsngy,JohnnyC4ge,2,Sun Jul 19 04:11:42 2015 UTC,"The amount of bandwidth it uses isn't the issue here, it's the fact it does it at all. Not all ISPs are bitorrent friendly, regardless of whether it's for a legit use or not, and under no circumstances should a game turn a user's computer into a dedicated server without explicit permission. This is completely unreasonable."

pcgaming,3dsngy,TaintedSquirrel,2,Sun Jul 19 02:33:01 2015 UTC,"Why? This trend is because it's often faster at the cost of as small amount upload.   Netflix looked into P2P to get around the ISP throttling, and if they had a P2P service it would never even have been an issue. If you're downloading something P2P is often the much faster connection.   This could also mean cheaper services for users, but that's just wishful thinking."
pcgaming,3dsngy,cogdissnance,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:32:51 2015 UTC,"Why? This trend is because it's often faster at the cost of as small amount upload.   Yeah, no. Most people are on ADSL which tends to have a very low speed cap. If something starts using my upstream, my entire internet connection becomes unusable. I ran into this issue originally with UPlay that tried to do the same thing; seed my copy of Black Flag.

Reflex and UT are extremely different games. Reflex is very fast and with very complex movement and quake style guns. UT is slower and uses the traditional UT weapons with alt fires.  Both great games, but you cant dismiss one because the other exists. I personally think the gameplay of reflex is much better"

pcgaming,3dt1yi,HiBills,2,Sun Jul 19 04:31:37 2015 UTC,"I know 5 or 6 left handed gamers, all of them have just learnt how to play using the typical layout of WASD and right hand holding mouse.  It was too much effort for them when they were younger/starting out to find, let alone invest in, a left handed mouse so it was kind of just forced upon them.  Have you tried completely mirroring the keyboard layout and using a left handed mouse?  I mean it would take a while to rebind everything and quite a few games don't support full key rebinding but it might be worth a shot to see if it works for you.  (i.e. WASD is now PL:"", LShift is RShift, 1 is +, 2 is _, etc.)  NB:  Sitting here now maybe mirroring the keyboard and shifting one to the centre of the keyboard would feel closer to how right handed players play (OKL: instead of PL:"")."
pcgaming,3dt1yi,Wauughlord,2,Sun Jul 19 05:37:23 2015 UTC,"I do complete key rebinding - wasd becomes olk; - and it's possible but it's a massive pain. Some games have some unrebindable keys - like the witcher 3 - or no key rebinding, and have to be rebound with an external program - in my case razer synapse. It takes ages to rebind for games with loads of keys - like just cause 2, Battlefield Arma etc. and sometimes cloud saving screws up and wipes my saved keys.  I'd recommend to anyone just using a mouse right handed."
pcgaming,3dt1yi,KING_of_Trainers69,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:42:33 2015 UTC,"I think I may just be better off learning how to use the mouse right-handed, but that sounds difficult. I wouldn't know where to start"
pcgaming,3dt1yi,Wauughlord,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:57:55 2015 UTC,"Mainly just exposure I suppose.  Find some less action heavy games, maybe some turn based strategy or something and slowly get used to using the mouse; Civ 4 or 5, something like that.  Then just gradually move into more intense games but at lower difficulties.  Maybe even try some finger exercises to try and get both your hands working efficiently; learning to type properly and learning piano helped me to get my left hand's dexterity much higher than it was.  Also, just get used to browsing the internet and using computers in general right-handed, the more you do it the better you'll get.  Obviously if you start getting muscle strain stretch out both your hands and take a break.  Just so you know, when I play games I use my middle finger on the scroll when I need to, moving it off the right mouse button then placing it back.  Some people prefer to use their ring finger on the right mouse button, keeping their middle finger for the scroll wheel at all times.  I also tend to use a ""claw grip"" as opposed to a ""palm grip"" on a mouse, using the tips of my fingers instead of the meaty parts of each finger.  Try out a variety of things and see what works best for you."
pcgaming,3dt1yi,ChillingOnTheCouch,2,Sun Jul 19 06:12:57 2015 UTC,"It sounds terrible for you guys using WASD for movement.  I've been playing since Doom, if a game doesn't let me rebind keys I don't play it (usually).   Almost every FPS I have played allowed full key rebind.  I'm thinking of like half-life, bioshock, UT, Quake, CS... I mean  if it's a good PC FPS it usually has full rebind.  The only games I have problems with are console ports.. or sometimes indie games.. for some of those it's better to use xbox controller, I'm not much of a console gamer anyway  (you can also get Autohotkey its a script program that lets you rebind keys to anything.. I only use it if I'm desperate though).     I use  IKLJ  for movement.  This gives me  o, u, y, h, n for skill/ action keys in games like Diablo/ Dota 2 in fps games I use ;  for jump ' for reload.   I hate having to use wasd but like I said that almost never happens.. full rebind seems like a pretty standard feature from my experience.    Finding a left handed mouse is a pain.. I looked around for years.  I had a death adder for a long time but the plastic on the surface really bothered me.. it had shiny plastic that got greasy really easy.  It also didn't have a lot of buttons.   I recently found an awesome mouse ..  it's so good for left handed people.  http://www.gamdias.com/en/c/gamdias-mouse/ amazon page http://www.amazon.com/GAMDIAS-GMS7001-Ambidextrous-Adjustable-Programmable/dp/B00H3VUEAU The size is nice (I have big hands).  The sides come off so u can switch between different thumb grips.  It also has a button that changes dpi of the mouse. The rubber texture also feels nice.   Best mouse I've ever used.  I don't play mmo games or use many mouse buttons so I don't mind that it doesn't have a lot of buttons.  I also always use wired mice.. so it's not great if your looking for a wireless mmo mouse.  Also.. I'm not even left handed!!!  When I first sat down to play Doom or probably Quake 1, I tried using my right and left hands.. and I just felt like I could move better using my right hand (gotta be pro at strafing),  I could aim well enough with both hands so I just got in the habit of using my left hand for the mouse.  I still write with my right hand."
pcgaming,3dt1yi,besyuziki,0,Sun Jul 19 14:51:33 2015 UTC,"I just use WASD for movement with a few changes to default keys here and there. Over time I've gotten used to putting my pinky on keys like F, V, C and space bar. My thumb is on ctrl, shift or alt. There's no lefty template like the southpaw controller template but it's straightforward, just bind the controls to your liking. If it feels too cramped, using another set of keys for movement instead of WASD, like IJKL, frees up more keys on the left side to use with your thumb.  But FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN, most lefties just learn to use the mouse with their right hand. So if you're new to PC gaming just try to do that before your muscle memory makes it a lot more difficult to switch later. I'm sorry if this wasn't the answer you were looking for, but it's how it is."

When I still using lefty mouse, my setup was 5123 for wasd and binding the rest surrounding those numbers. You have some fat keys surrounding the numbers for whichever actions are needed for the game. The arrow keys are good for occasional keys you need to press. Home, end, delete, insert, pg up, and pg down are similar to arrow keys, it's more stuff to bind not too far from the numpad but it works."

That experience was honestly my most Unoptimized controls and I will never do it ever again.  Just use your computer right handed like you use your scissors right handed.
pcgaming,3dsnda,meesterdave,15,Sun Jul 19 01:55:00 2015 UTC,"I think all three Witcher games are completely worth playing, and it may be harder to get into the other two after playing 3 since it'd be a jump from better graphics and gameplay to lesser.  I'd recommend playing the first Witcher on easy, unless you end up liking the combat. Most people don't, and playing on easy allows you to not have to worry about fights and be able to smoothly cruise through the game. Playing at a lesser difficulty didn't harm my experience of the game at least, it had such an enjoyable atmosphere.  The second Witcher has improved combat although it's a bit more difficult. If you're able, I think it's a much better experience playing on at least normal, and going through the rituals of either brewing potions or readying traps or oiling swords and what not before a fight.  Most people didn't have trouble understanding the stories of 2 or 3 without playing the previous game (s), but for me, it took a play through of 1 in order to understand the politics of 2."
pcgaming,3dsnda,ninjyte,5,Sun Jul 19 05:18:34 2015 UTC,"Spot on. Originally I played Witcher 2 first, and while I was able to get into the lore through context, I had a much better understanding of the world when I went back and played everything in order. The games can all be enjoyed and understood on their own, but you will be missing out on a deeper immersion into the world."

pcgaming,3dsnda,wrathofoprah,4,Mon Jul 20 00:00:00 2015 UTC,"No matter how you slice it, The Witcher games are a series and as such, you will end up missing pretty significant details if you skip the first or second game.  Now, don't get me wrong, you will be able to muddle through if you just hop into the third game, you won't know any of the context, you won't understand a lot of what is being discussed around you, you won't know anything about Geralt's relationships with the characters around him, but you will be able to understand the basic plot and go from there.  I suggest playing the first two, the first one drags a bit and is pretty clunky but I don't regret playing it for a second, it provides the narrative foundation that the other two are built on."

You won't have problem getting into the third game without play the first two, but the experience probably won't be as fulfilling as those who played since the beginning. Experiencing character development and story progressions does help enrich things.  It's much like jumping into a TV show a couple of seasons later, or a movie franchise without seeing the previous films. You won't be lost, so if that's your worry it won't be a problem.  At least play through Witcher 2 before getting into Witcher 3."

There are some cases, where knowing a few things from the earlier games helps a little bit, as well as a few characters, however, it's not that often.   I'd still play the two earlier games, as they are amazing on their own, but if you don't feel like it, you can safely skip them."

pcgaming,3dsnda,thatnitai,2,Sun Jul 19 07:06:25 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would recommend playing it from the start. Witcher 1 offers a really great immersion of the lore,world-building, and grants you deeper understanding of who are the Witchers, and and knowing the fucked up world they are living in, coupled with political and racial disputes between humans and non-humans, to which Geralt can be a neutral, or chooses to pick one side, while Witcher 2 explores more on the disputes and politics."

pcgaming,3dsnda,StargateGuy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:24:17 2015 UTC,Personally I only played 2 and 3. I tried playing 1 but after enduring the first combat interaction i noped right out of their and just watched the youtube summary of the story. Witcher 2 was a lot of fun and I recommend it.   However if you are talking about just playing the witcher 3 and owuld rather not play the first 2 then go right ahead. The are story recaps made by CDPR themselves on youtube and the past story is resonably well addressed in 3 (this is hte first title released on consoles so they wanted it to be playable by people that hadn't played the first 2)  A lot of the story in the witcher 3 such as Ciri isn't really talked about much in 2 anyway. Just look up a brief description of what the wilf hunt is and geralts connection to them as well as some info on triss and you are probably good to go.

I personally think 3 is the best Witcher by a mile, and wouldn't recommend any of the others without qualifications. Don't let completionism hold you back if you aren't really motivated to play the others.  Witcher 3 is the best game I've played since Mass Effect 2."

pcgaming,3dsnda,tycosnh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:06:29 2015 UTC,"TW1 focusses more on Geralt and being a Witcher. And less about politics etc.You are your own boss, and it feels more relaxed due to that. It will enrich the main backstory and alot of characters backstory if you play this one.  Tw2 doesnt actually lean on TW1 that much and instead really goes into a different direction. Namely the confusing politics of the witcher world. This also means you usually have someone telling you what you should do. This one is more important if you want to understand the politics which move the different groups you deal with in TW3.   Especially TW2, has alot of choices that influence TW3.  You can simulate a TW2 save at the start of TW3, but its hard mto understand the choices you get here  if you havent played tw2.   Tw3 is a bit of a mix between the 2.  You make your own plan. But always have people trying to controll you.  Wether you go for this or not is your choice.   IMHO: I would play 1 and 2 before playing 3. If you have the time. You dont really need to, but it does add to the experience."

pcgaming,3dsnda,Mithridates12,3,Sun Jul 19 10:53:36 2015 UTC,"TW3 retains the awesome story telling etc of TW2 but fixes the combat (i agree it was repetitive etc in TW2 but with the shear variety of enemies and possible builds of signs/sword skills/alchemy)  The most surprising thing I found about TW3 was that every quest feels like a mini single player story. The are no fetch quests, the were even some stories I thought would just be shitty go here and do things quests that spiralled into a story that I did not see coming. For example at one point you meet a priest that asks you to go burn some bodies after a big battle, I thought it was just going to be some easy exp until I got to one of the pits with bodies in to find one still alive that explained his side of the story...  I am unquestionably buying the season pass to this game, that is something I have never ever ever done for any game I will always wait to see whether content is worth my money but the is no question here."

The devs have very limited tools to work with curations, so their only way to make a review that dealt more generally with the game, instead of just one small feature, appear was to block (more like remove) the curator.

I don't see why there's so much backlash against an informed consumer after the past year we've had in gaming. The backlash to Watch Dogs, Assassn's Creed Unity, Halo, Arkham Knight, and more could have been avoided if these company's had been more transparent with their customers. If WB had come out before the release of AK and said ""Well the PC version is not fully optomized, but we're working on it. So if you want to play an unoptimized version that will be buggy you can, but you may want to wait."" There would have been no reason to take the game down and much less backlash against the company itself.    Plus, it's not anyone's right to tell a consumer what they should or shouldn't find important. If I only want to play a game that features an in depth story while another consumer just wants to play multiplayer, that's our rights. There should be no limit on what consumers should know when purchasing if it it effects their experience with their purchase."

It's easy to tell with a lot of them that there simply aren't enough frames for it to look good. 60FPS is around the area where FPS smooths out and no longer looks choppy to many people.

Of course not, even though it just so happens that it doesn't have a frame limit.   Does Guild of Dungeoneering need it?

pcgaming,3dntxt,bluescrn,22,Sat Jul 18 18:10:26 2015 UTC,"As much as I think a 30fps flag for games is a great thing, let's not bullshit ourselves with what the word ""30fps police"" means.  Saying ""the police just present facts"" is a weak argument.  Police don't present facts/evidence any more than any other public servant does.  That's not why we have a police force.  Police enforce laws and provide a visible deterrent to prevent further crime.  That's what defines them.  Pure and simple.  In the context of Steam Games, the crime being policed is ""a game locked to 30fps"".  From Dictionary.com:  Police   Also called police force. an organized civil force for maintaining order, preventing and detecting crime, and enforcing the laws. (used with a plural verb) members of such a force: Several police are patrolling the neighborhood. the regulation and control of a community, especially for the maintenance of public order, safety, health, morals, etc. the department of the government concerned with this, especially with the maintenance of order. any body of people officially maintained or employed to keep order, enforce regulations, etc. people who seek to regulate a specified activity, practice, etc.: the language police.   As you can see there's nothing there about ""presenting facts"" in any of these, but plenty related to enforcing particular laws or regulations, etc.  The last 2 definitions relate exactly to the ""30fps police"" usage of the term.  Edit: My personal opinion is that ""30fps police"" was a bad choice of a name.  This isn't an issue that needs policing, simply informing the consumer. If the intent was to be non-judgmental toward 30fps games then it should have been called ""30fps informer"" or something similar."

pcgaming,3dntxt,funkbanger,30,Fri Jul 17 22:00:26 2015 UTC,"Might be tied to the rest of the game.  If the game (possibly a third party engine) assumes a constant frame rate and ties it to the clock or game logic or something then you can have some pretty bad problems.   For example, I once wrote some OpenGL that made a pyramid “unfold “. It worked by rotating the polygons by a certain amount every frame. Double the framerate and it would unfold faster."
pcgaming,3dntxt,cparen,4,Fri Jul 17 22:38:24 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I was just playing the game and I can see why the developers might do that with some of the animations.
pcgaming,3dntxt,darthirule,17,Fri Jul 17 23:06:17 2015 UTC,"It's not just animations,  physics engines normally work by saying “what happened in the last fraction of a second“. That fraction of a second is how granular the physics is and if it's tied to framerate it means that once per frame the game works out where that object bounces. Up the framerate and weird shit can happen.   Unrelated anecdote: I heard of stone students at my university, several years ago when the 360 was the hot shit,  who made a game for their course using the xbox frameworks, engines like unity and unreal weren't widely available at the time. They had the draw distance larger than the physics cutoff (the range beyond which the game doesn't bother running physics on because,  normally, it's well out of sight). This meant that when walking around things would spawn, hang in the air until you got close enough for physics to kick in and then fall to the ground and start doing their thing."

pcgaming,3dntxt,supamesican,6,Sat Jul 18 00:47:12 2015 UTC,"Others are spot on about programming. Saves on cost.  Also, it will save on battery life, and lead to less stutter on low end devices. (I wish Minecraft had an optional fps cap on Android. It renders at 60+fps and eats battery like mad)"
pcgaming,3dntxt,Groggeroo,5,Sat Jul 18 04:34:32 2015 UTC,"Most of the game logic is around how fast the game loop can run. Say if the game is locked to 30fps, then the game loop will be looped through 30 times a second. This means all the physics and whatnot is calculated with the loop running 30 times a second in mind.   Say you have a picture scrolling across the screen. At 30 updates a second it would take X seconds to go across the screen. If the game was then ran at 60fps without changing any of the logic then the picture would scroll across the screen twice as fast.   It is a lot easier for a dev to lock the frame rate than it is to do more maths to make sure the physics work on all machines and at all framerates.   What it basically comes down to is saving time. (and experience, like I am still learning how to let open frames work on all systems as a student) If a company is demanding the game be released at X date, no exception, then locking the frames will save a TON of work for the developers."
pcgaming,3dntxt,laughtrey,3,Sat Jul 18 07:11:08 2015 UTC,"I can think of several good reasons for capping the framerate in games:   One of the reasons already mentioned is for battery consumption, and this is one of the better reasons. The fewer frames that need to be processed, the less energy is consumed. This is invaluable on mobile devices or laptops, because an unlimited game will make short work of any battery! Another is for performance consistency. In some cases, there may be difficulties in reaching a 60fps threshold stably. In these cases, ignoring vsync, the player would more easily be taken out of the experience by inconsistent frame-rates than by a consistent but slower framer-ate.   Note: Vsync would not allow the frame to be rendered until the next refresh - so effectively 30fps   Another might be cross platform reasons. If a game is intended to play on multiple platforms, for a consistent experience and 'testing rules', it might be a good decision to keep the framerate similar. Perhaps another is the intended experience. The ""cinematic feel"" has been well established in our culture, and moving faster than the standard frame rate is jarring for some (if anyone remembers the clamor surrounding The Hobbit @ 48FPS).     Source - GameDev:Programmer  Note: I have never frame limited a game below 60fps, with exception to mobile games, so the above are just reasons I can think of why, I don't know for certain any developers reasons"

My initial thought when learning about the Framerate Police is that it should instead have an icon for 60 FPS and add games that have that frame rate, that way it's a badge of honour rather than a badge of shame."
pcgaming,3dntxt,Fooshbeard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:13:32 2015 UTC,"Being locked to 60 is a huge detractor, absolutely a badge of shame, for many players these days. If you've seen 120Hz w/ ULMB first hand, you'd know that ANYTHING THAT MOVES AT ALL benefits massively from being able to render at 120 in sync with the display. Hearthstone, Fez, Pokemon, the desktop, you name it. On such a display if it's locked at 60 it looks like shit, and if it's unlimited it looks incredible. ULMB makes the difference between 60 and 120 as clear as day, but that's not to say the difference between 60 and 120 with standard motion blur wasn't massive already.  Most games capped at 60 require me to toggle my display to 60hz where ULMB is off (although there is a samsung display that can do 60hz ULMB), and while I normally use adaptive v-sync, almost every single one of those capped games doesn't respect it and will stutter and tear regardless. So I have to go into the Nvidia control and disable adaptive and use the game's, or force standard, which means a dip of 1 FPS causes a drop to 30 because of how standard v-sync operates. Not only does a 60FPS cap make the game look horrible in comparison, but it makes me do additional setup initially, and forces me to toggle my display refresh twice every time I want to play it so the experience isn't as horrible as it can be.  It's simultaneously a huge pain and a disappointment, and for myself and many others, it makes the game worth less to us vs the games that aren't capped arbitrarily."

If developers don't stop hiding the curator listing by default, it looks like they can't hide it from those that follow Frame Rate Police from the screenshot in that post.

Arkham Knight backpedaling from releasing a broken game was mostly caused by the new Steam refund policy and now this FPS Police challenge to the status quo sets better precedent for the future.

Obviously some frills like particle effects or things that happen ""client side"" really don't matter, but with more and more games using physics for gameplay, they HAVE to use the same time steps. Vsync is another issue, if the game can't do 60 fps, it'll drop down to 30 fps, so they decide to lock the game to 30 fps to avoid a source of frame stutter. Some games allow the client to render as fast as possible and use interpolation / prediction to smooth out the movement, but this can lead to weird errors as well, like things slightly off their correct positions.    Blame physics. Also some games don't NEED more FPS, if the game is a lot of static images or turn based, what do you gain from rendering the same static scene more? Nothing but more work for your computer."

One dev of a tiny little black/white hand-drawn papery looking game with barely any moving on screen parts blocked someone who is using the system in a way it was not meant to be used from showing up instead of recommendations that their game rightfully should show?  Not only that but it only blocks it for people who aren't following the curator so they most likely don't give a shit?  Fucking stupid, who gives a fuck?  Oh no people who quite clearly don't give a shit about FPS since they don't even follow the curator won't every now and then randomly see a large 30fps symbol instead of a recommendation like they're meant to on a game with barely enough graphics or moving parts to even notice!  EDIT: System is not just for recommendations about the gameplay and such itself but all things, I was wrong about that. However my main point that it only blocks it for people who don't even fucking follow the curator is the main one and still stands.  HERES THE MAIN THING YOU SHOULD READ: So first there's the 1 in 40 chance the game is on the list. (~100 games on the list, 4000+ on steam)  Then there's also the tiny chance that that one curator actually happens to be randomly selected.  We're talking about a developer of a game with barely any graphics blocking the 1 in most likely several hundred or thousand chance that a tiny 30fps symbol will appear on the game page. Then there's the even TINIER chance of the person actually noticing the 30fps symbol. Then there's the fact that most people who care about FPS will follow this curator or research before they buy games.  It's just really ridiculous a fuss is being made about this and the poor developer is receiving death threats.  I do understand that principle wise this could develop into a problem, I really just don't agree with the way TotalBiscuits fans are going about it personally."

Also, while not technical ""DLC"", which is a horseshit practice in most cases, the original Mortal Kombat has Reptile as an unlockable. Same thing with MK2 having several secret characters.

You see the difference? Just because theyre locked away doesnt mean shit. Locked or unlocked, the game ships with a set of characters.   If there was no dlc then we wouldnt have more characters. You see, ddvelopers make more characters because they are not including them in the initial budget of the game. They make them considering the revenue of the dlc.

I've heard stuff about a version that is able to run at 60fps but I've been unable to track it down. I also know GTA III era games can be made to run stable to at least 60 by enabling V-sync in your GPU drivers.   I also know that some games have an engine FPS cap that needs to be set higher for a game to run at higher than 60, it often requires a .INI file modification to do the trick. Many Unreal Engine games are examples of this http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Engine:Unreal_Engine_3#Smoothed_frame_rate"

pcgaming,3dt5mh,toffee_fapple,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:42:54 2015 UTC,It had something to do with a 14ms frame delay if I recall. There's a community patch that fixes it and the game will probably run at 30 when capped.
pcgaming,3dt5mh,kherby,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:30:22 2015 UTC,I was playing san andreas yesterday at 60fps. The physics were all normal for me. I didn't need to edit anything just turned vsync off.
pcgaming,3dt5mh,toffee_fapple,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:20:14 2015 UTC,Just because you didn't notice anything doesn't change the fact that anything over 30 FPS breaks San Andreas physics. I played SA for 7+ years (I was an advid SAMP player). The physics breaks when running over 30 FPS period. Sometimes it just takes a little time before the game worlds physics breaks. But give it time and you'll see cars floating and doing weird shit.  Now just to be clear we're talking about San Andreas the original not GTA V.
pcgaming,3dt5mh,kherby,2,Mon Jul 20 14:00:05 2015 UTC,"Yes i'm talking about san andreas.

It sometimes leads to problems when the developers have designed systems based on a certain FPS cap, however. Like Dark Souls, which used the amount of frames your weapon spent inside enemy and object hitboxes to calculate durability damage. Going from 30 to 60 FPS caused durability to degrade twice as fast. :-P"

pcgaming,3ds8aw,GodlikeApe,3,Sun Jul 19 07:59:49 2015 UTC,For playing older games that don't give an option to render above 1024x768 or lower.
pcgaming,3ds8aw,l_Palekids_l,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:50:42 2015 UTC,Must be quite an old game because I haven't really ran into that issue and even then dsr can help with that or even going into the ini. file
pcgaming,3ds8aw,GodlikeApe,2,Sun Jul 19 14:44:04 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure. And in many cases, fiddling around in a config file will sort it out. I recently installed Hitman: Blood Money and had to do that. Its options only went up to 1600x900. It came out in 2007!  But for many older games that's not a workable fix. The engines they run were never designed to render at higher resolutions and even telling them to via .ini edits just breaks them or stops them from even starting. I imagine it can be an issue if one plays a lot of games from GOG or still have games on CD-ROM left over from the nineties etc.  DSR will only work if the game engine and options support higher resolutions. If the highest resolution offered by a game is 1024x768 with no option for say 1920x1080, it more than likely won't offer 3840x2160.  It's super easy to forget how far videogames and the technology that powers them has come in such a relatively short space of time. I remember when Mario 64 was basically real life on 4MB of RAM."

WAW is populated, but in the US, there's only one populated 'normal' server. The other 3-4 populated servers in the US are tactical or crouch servers, which I personally don't like.    COD4 is definitely more populated than WAW. You can check the list of COD4 servers here. You can also check the list of WAW servers as well. What I like about BO2 (besides it being a great PC port) is that it's simple. It's not crazy like 30-40+ player COD4 games. There's no server browser, you just choose the game mode you wish to play in (there aren't that many populated game modes though), the game finds a lobby and you just play.    If I had to choose one, it'd be COD4 since it's cheaper :P"

pcgaming,3dq2r6,brews,8,Sat Jul 18 14:54:50 2015 UTC,"If you play it again you'll see how Shenmue really did qtes differently from the way modern games do it Modern games always put the prompt at the bottom of the screen, they appear without warning, and without any sound. Often times the buttons don't make sense either, like in one sequence its circle to attack, but in another its triangle.  Shenmue puts the button right in the middle of the screen, accompanied by beeping and flashing. While it is kind of jarring and obnoxious, the developers knew it was more important for the player to notice it than to miss it and feel cheated. On top of that, the buttons usually corresponded to the action Ryo needed to take. Dodging left was left. Leg actions (jumping, kicking) were A (just like in fights), grab actions were B (also like fights). Because of that it was easier to guess what button would come up just by watching the scene."

People who don't care much for accuracy and use big resolution might enjoy the high DPI.  But yeah, as far as precision goes, lower the better. why? because the lower it is the more room for movement you have to get it right to where you want to.  If the DPI is low, you'll need to move it say 1cm for 1 inch, but if the DPI is high 1cm movement will cause the mouse to move 10 inches.  When that happens, you don't have the precision to decide if you want to move it 1, 2, 5 or 8 inches because every little movement moves it too much.  So yeah, lower = better for precision."

pcgaming,3dp72x,Nathan173AB,5,Sat Jul 18 07:19:51 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. What you want is the native DPI of the sensor (varies from mouse to mouse, but usually 800). Anything else will be interpolated, and subject to inaccuracies."
pcgaming,3dp72x,Benwah11,2,Tue Jul 21 02:36:15 2015 UTC,"Ok, here comes a technical explanation. This only applies when software mouse acceleration is turned off, by the way.  DPI and sensitivity are two variables that define the final speed of your cursor in relation to the movements you make with your hand. That is, you can find a pair of values that will get you the same speed (higher DPI-lower sensitivity).  However, DPI is a physical measurement of ""steps"" in real physical movement. You can think of it as ""how many times per second you get an updated position"". Sensitivity, whether it's windows or in-game, is a software multiplier.  Now, what happens when you trade off real measurements over software compensation, is that you're literally skipping positions: if you move your hand two inches, you'll have 800 updates with an 800 DPI sensor, and 1600 with a 1600 DPI sensor. Now, if sensitivity is set to a 1:1 ratio, you'll find that the only difference is that 800 DPI is ""slower"" than 1600 DPI. But if you want to make 800 ""faster"", then you multiply each step, so 1 point in real life= 2 points in game. This leads, again, to skipping some positions, leading to jittery movement: the minimum movement you're able to do could be higher than, say, the enemy's head, so landing a headshot is basically impossible (this is an extreme case).  On the other end of the spectrum, you can get lowered software sensitivity, so 1 inch of movement in real life=0.5 inches on the screen for example. This can be more precise, and you can compensate for the slow movement with higher DPI, but it might feel either too slow or simply unnatural. It's still better imo than skipping positions...although, one problem with this is that Windows desktop behaves a bit weird with sensitivity turned down.  Overall, high dpi-low sensitivity is better (for the same percieved speed) than low dpi-high sensitivity. But when it comes to ""finding a good speed and feel"", neutral-low sensitivity with average DPI is best. And, of course, slower speeds (you can only go down so much with software sensitivity, so you can't really use 5000+ DPI in such situation) are more precise, but more of a pain in the arse to use.  Also worth mentioning: many games have the sensitivity only applied to things like first person view, while the menus have a fixed speed. So compensating with DPI-sensitivity in game leads to either very very slow movement, or very very high."
pcgaming,3dp72x,yamsilvius,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:16:59 2015 UTC,"In Windows, set your pointer speed to normal. I think it's the 6th notch, or whatever the default is. At that level, it doesn't cull or inflate information from the mouse. Then, adjust your DPI until your mouse moves at a speed you're comfortable with."
pcgaming,3dp72x,Nathan173AB,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:23:25 2015 UTC,"From a little research before I got my mouse, I found this: Set the OS sensitivity to default and set the mouse DPI so that you can move the pointer from one side of the screen to the other with just 1-3 inches of movement. This depends on monitor resolution and your own personal comfort. After that you can tweak for precision with slight changes to mouse DPI and in-game sensitivity.   So far this has worked wonders for me, but take it with a pinch of salt."

pcgaming,3dp72x,friendlyoffensive,0,Sat Jul 18 20:20:51 2015 UTC,It's totally preference. If you are a big CSGO play you should slowly learn to use a lower DPI because precision is key.   A lower DPI is in most games pretty useful.   High DPI is a marketing thing and doesn't actually help you with anything. You usally don't need to turn 180° in an FPS and if you do it's not worth sacrificing so much precision over turning speed.  Even League pro's mostly play with a low DPI 800-1200 dpi from what I've heard

pcgaming,3dp72x,CSFFlame,0,Sat Jul 18 18:00:37 2015 UTC,Low is better: You will have better precision.  If you use higher DPI and slow speed the only you'll get is bad precision.  I started playing CSGO with 1200DPI and 12 speed ingame! Since I lowered down to 400DPI and 4.5 speed ingame I got better. Precision is more important.
pcgaming,3dp72x,resetes12,-1,Sat Jul 18 09:14:09 2015 UTC,Put the windows cursor speed setting in the middle Set DPI to a high setting Set polling rate to max (assuming your computer isn't shit at this point) Lower your in-game sensitivity to desired levels   Now it should feel more accurate...

I use to have my DPI set to 1200 but I found it too twitchy in CS:GO and I was constantly missing shots that I should have easily been making so I dialed it back to 950.

pcgaming,3dq5go,Tiago_Borges,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:10:42 2015 UTC,It was a bad port on release they have made a few fixes but its still bad overall. Netherealm games always have bad online on pc and console. Mkx has a few online features but the connection quality of online matches are poor. If your friend doesn't live close to you expect enough lag to make the game semi unplayable.

pcgaming,3dq5go,meowmeowsss,0,Sun Jul 19 04:13:46 2015 UTC,"Works perfectly, completed the campaign at 1440p and it was ultra smooth. Apparently they had a distribution mix up with a patch at some point where it deleted the samegames, the patch was only online for a couple minutes, so practically no chance you got impacted. No other problems. Another game where the reputation that they ""fucked up"" is stronger than the actual fuck up, another reason not to trust redditors when they rage against game developers."
pcgaming,3dq5go,Dunge,2,Sat Jul 18 15:32:05 2015 UTC,"The game had actual bugs, no one would call it a bad port because it deleted save games. Did you even look at the bug complaints in the steam forums? Off the top of my head i remember the game having memory leak issues,crashing on startup, fucked up hud depending on your screen resolution and no optimization. Also online match making wasn't good at finding you opponents that you would have a good connection with(This is extremely crucial for fighting games)."
pcgaming,3dq5go,NewLeafBlack,-1,Sat Jul 18 16:20:08 2015 UTC,"No, the mechanics are terrible it's literally unplayable.  But seriously, it's not that well optimized so you need a pretty good pc, it runs fine on my r9 290."

pcgaming,3dma5x,EvitGrey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:42:15 2015 UTC,Viva Pinata was a really addicting game as well.

pcgaming,3dma5x,daft_inquisitor,16,Fri Jul 17 15:00:56 2015 UTC,What exactly did Microsoft do?   They bought the company. And the fact that the negotiations were happening is most likely what pushed those people to leave to begin with.
pcgaming,3dma5x,guma822,38,Fri Jul 17 16:59:55 2015 UTC,they turned them into a kinect only shovelware company
pcgaming,3dma5x,Gazareth,3,Fri Jul 17 15:44:49 2015 UTC,"They did let them develop Perfect Dark and Viva Pinata. I loved PD and I've heard good things about VP. They just weren't classics on the scale of DKC, 007 or BK. It just wasn't ""working"" per se, so they got reallocated. That's my theory anyway."
pcgaming,3dma5x,guma822,6,Sat Jul 18 00:53:01 2015 UTC,well perfect dark zero was a launch title and very forgettable. viva pinata was a unique game but just didnt have a huge following
pcgaming,3dma5x,HaikusfromBuddha,2,Sat Jul 18 01:27:57 2015 UTC,I wonder what people would say if they ever realized it was Rare who was tinkering with motion controls on their own and that they were the ones who initially created the Kinect before MS took the project over.  Even the Yokalaylee guys have said in the past that they had more freedom with MS than with Nintendo.
pcgaming,3dma5x,Mundius,6,Sat Jul 18 04:11:09 2015 UTC,"No, but it was related to the company being sold."

pcgaming,3dma5x,Delsana,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:23:04 2015 UTC,"You can't really blame Microsoft. The times changed, people expected different games, and the niche titles that Rare made would not be held as well as in this day. Rare also made decisions that led them to Microsoft on their own. I  liked Kameo."
pcgaming,3dma5x,cogdissnance,10,Fri Jul 17 20:58:28 2015 UTC,"Please explain to me how we can't blame Microsoft for taking the third installment in a series of platformers and, half way through development, turning it into a vehicle building/racing game. Something that was very noticeable as many of the worlds weren't even designed with that in mind.   The times changed, people expected different games,   People expected different games because the market was growing, and variety increasing, they did not expect the games they already had to die out though. What you're implying is like saying that FPS aren't going to be in demand anymore because MOBAs are the new trend. It doesn't work that way.   In terms of platformers the market was pretty saturated, sure, but what Microsoft tried to do was move on to other newly emerging markets in order to get an early foothold there, while completely disregarding the existing one. It's not like the fans of platformer games had some sort of mass extinction.  It's very similar to what has happened with RTS games. It's not that the market isn't there anymore, it's that most RTS games do not come out as good, nor as frequently as before. Many RTS game enthusiasts have instead moved on to (somewhat tangentially) similar genres like MOBAs where there is a wider audience appeal (i.e. the lowest common denominator). The RTS niche though is very much still alive.   As an example, StarCraft II WCS prize pool for 2014 was $131,000 while for 2015 the prize pool was $217,000, which is near the $250,000 the global finals got last year. The market is definitely still there, just not being catered to by anyone but a few select developers... and this is from some one who never liked platformers."
pcgaming,3dma5x,Metalheadzaid,7,Fri Jul 17 18:13:46 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the issue I mentioned with final fantasy and jrpgs in general moving away from traditional styling. We didn't die and stop enjoying those games, the fuck."
pcgaming,3dma5x,McHadies,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:44:28 2015 UTC,I hope the FFVII remake will still be turn-based like the original!
pcgaming,3dma5x,Delsana,2,Fri Jul 17 20:05:05 2015 UTC,"If trends continue FPS's and MOBA's will be all you see because they outrank all other genres. Sadly. More like saying RTS, RPG, and Sport games will disappear.  For a VERY long time we saw platformers, rts's, rpg's, adventures, and puzzle games decrease heavily because the market shifted. It WILL shift again as much as I don't want it to.  Competitive game focuses have always had an exception though, in terms of Blizzard and such due to fans, sometimes addiction, and some other factors.  Kameo and yes, PDZ, were both goods."

pcgaming,3dma5x,HaikusfromBuddha,0,Fri Jul 17 20:00:47 2015 UTC,Well if you followed most of the Rare veterans you would realize they were the ones who made up the idea of nuts and bolts. They literally just tweeted out they thought the car angle would be better because of lack of interest in platformers at the time.

pcgaming,3dma5x,elcanadiano,5,Sat Jul 18 04:13:25 2015 UTC,It's better than that when you also have David Wise and Steve Burke on top of that on the project for music.

pcgaming,3dma5x,God_Emperor_Dune,36,Fri Jul 17 20:55:13 2015 UTC,Probably a lot more pressure on making your money back when you don't get a bunch of free money to make your game.
pcgaming,3dma5x,tisokan,-1,Fri Jul 17 13:07:41 2015 UTC,"Because larger studios don't already usually have a large amount of money to put into their games...  A lot of these donations receive a game or more, which makes it no different then a sale."
pcgaming,3dma5x,Shensmobile,20,Fri Jul 17 13:07:56 2015 UTC,"But a sale that's already been made lets them make a game that doesn't fill the ""marketing criteria"" that would normally help sell the game.  You know, because it's already sold."
pcgaming,3dma5x,Echono,5,Fri Jul 17 13:40:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, instead they just have to sell and make promises for something that doesn't even exist yet. Both ways can have their issues."
pcgaming,3dma5x,McHadies,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:58:55 2015 UTC,"Thankfully these guys were conservative with their stretch goals, every milestone was something that would help sweeten a game rather than say 'FULLY EXPLORABLE PLANETS'"

pcgaming,3dma5x,gthkeno,9,Fri Jul 17 23:27:18 2015 UTC,But they haven't sold anything. As of right now at least it's literally just money for a bare as bones idea.
pcgaming,3dma5x,tisokan,2,Fri Jul 17 14:03:22 2015 UTC,"I can say the same thing about pre orders, that's all kickstarter really is with this.  Just because the product isn't done, doesn't mean it's not a sale.  They are offering a product for the money."
pcgaming,3dma5x,Emberwake,3,Fri Jul 17 17:07:06 2015 UTC,"Pre-orders are refundable. Kickstarter donations are not.  A sale is a legally defined and protected transaction. Its is an equitable exchange of money for goods or services. If you do not receive the promised goods or services, then the business is not entitled to keep your money.  Kickstarter donations, even ones that promise backer rewards, are not sales. They have no obligation to their backers, other than a desire to avoid bad press."
pcgaming,3dma5x,Shabutie13,0,Fri Jul 17 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I donated $15 dollars but I get a steam key. Sure, it is akin to pre-ordering, but I liked the look of the project and I want it to come to fruition."
pcgaming,3dma5x,0Asterite0,12,Fri Jul 17 20:43:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it looks like this game is nostalgia box-ticking. Same with Freedom Planet and Hat in Time. Rayman Legend's gameplay, for example, actually felt like it had a unique hook to it with the platforming flow. I just don't see the special unique hook other than nostalgia these games have yet."
pcgaming,3dma5x,KingVape,9,Fri Jul 17 13:55:06 2015 UTC,"I would say that after Banjo Tooie, people demanded a sequel, and a proper one hasn't been done yet after all these years. Those games are solid adventure games with depth and I hope to god that Yooka-Laylee delivers."
pcgaming,3dma5x,0Asterite0,0,Fri Jul 17 15:45:27 2015 UTC,"Even Banjo Tooie brought something new to the table though. Don't get me wrong, I hope they deliver too, it's just right now I don't see anything worth being hype about yet. I hope they show more gameplay footage soon."
pcgaming,3dma5x,Astrognome,8,Fri Jul 17 15:57:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's more that the genre hasn't been done well in a long time.  Counter-strike is still popular because it's good, not because of nostalgia, and that came out almost 20 years ago."
pcgaming,3dma5x,SCREAMING_FLESHLIGHT,2,Fri Jul 17 16:11:35 2015 UTC,"In addition to that, Rayman legends has top notch animation and art, it looks amazing, most these indie games do not.  This game looks like every platformer of 1998, with better lighting."
pcgaming,3dma5x,Pi-Guy,3,Fri Jul 17 18:11:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like half of the marketing for this consists of ""It's just like Banjo!""  Which feels kind of lazy to be honest. I'd like to judge the game by its own merits, especially since it's a new IP."
pcgaming,3dma5x,Fidodo,4,Fri Jul 17 20:21:20 2015 UTC,"That's what happens when you have games designed by committees. I think one reason Nintendo does so well is that they work hard to groom visionary directors that lead the way, like Aonuma and Sakurai."
pcgaming,3dma5x,heeredd,3,Fri Jul 17 18:47:22 2015 UTC,I'm no way in any shape or form a game dev or animator but doesn't the landing animation seem a bit choppy and the follow through slow-down walk too artificial? Just don't want this game to end up like Sonic '06 :(
pcgaming,3dma5x,Cbird54,3,Fri Jul 17 19:07:36 2015 UTC,"I really hope they can prove to be worth the good will they received from the community, too many stick it to the man stories turning sour from kickstarter it seems these days."

pcgaming,3dma5x,JilaX,9,Fri Jul 17 14:17:22 2015 UTC,"Steam is not DRM in and of itself. Developers can make the choice to let the game run without even having steam open (I.e. just let the .exe run the game freely, with no restrictions.)   They might make you verify the game key, but so does GoG."
pcgaming,3dma5x,khaosoffcthulhu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:26:47 2015 UTC,Exactly the DRM is steamworks. Most developers choose to implement it though.

VATS putting things into slowmotion and crits now being a currency you have to charge up and plan how to use are also massive improvements.

pcgaming,3dolus,DerTanni,3,Sat Jul 18 00:54:05 2015 UTC,"Looks great and I'm super excited. But the one thing I gotta say is that I'm worried about is the venturing from Fallout 3's, Morrowind's, Oblivion's, and Skyrim's consistent first person experience. I enjoy how they handled dialogue scenes. In those games, when you speak to someone, it doesn't cut away or anything. It also doesn't show you while you speak to them (I believe Mass Effect does this?). I'm constantly THE character. MAYBE something will suddenly happen in conversation. This was definitely a conscious effort but from what I've noticed in the dialogue scenes in the fallout 4 footage I've seen, they really want to push seeing yourself in the game.   Perhaps this was just done for the trailer, but I also don't like the breaking aways (to the guy with the hat) because it causes me to question why is the game trying to be like a movie. I start judging it and feeling pretty annoyed because I associate cut scenes with something that's considered skippable content. Feeling the story in person, in character, it can be slow and maybe annoying but for some reason I'll bear it and still feel immersed. Maybe I'll walk around while stuff is happening. The world stays a world I can interact with. I mean, I do stuff all the time while people talk to me in real life (in regards to cut scenes). Cutting to the character when selecting a reaction is strange too. I'm choosing a dialogue to see the OTHER character's reaction, THAT'S anticipation. Will they draw their gun out or will they suddenly want to be an friend? Cutting to see myself when choosing a dialogue piece that's vanity, and feels strange.   Throw away away the film school logic. I get it, you know what editing and cinematography is but let us be the character in one fluid piece of gameplay (unless it's VATS, VATS is perfect). Sorry I just have to mention that. How this game handle dialogue and scenes feels showy when it doesn't have to.   edit: I'm probably speaking too soon but I feel I had to mention all that. With that said the gameplay looks fucking great. Fucking fantastic."

pcgaming,3dqcji,GuilhermeFreire,4,Sat Jul 18 23:55:13 2015 UTC,"Behind the 16x slots?   You need to be able to access the backplate of the PCI card, regardless whether it's a GPU for display output, a sound card for audio output/input, or whatever. So placing them behind a 16x slot is not a solution, as then the only way to access the input/output of the card would be internally inside the case, which defeats a large part of the point of a PCI card.   Another thing that's not been mentioned, is that the reason some of the x4 or x1 slots are so strangely placed, is because the motherboard only supports a maximum amount of PCIe lanes active at one time. And pretty well every motherboard has more PCI slots than actual lanes it can support. It's kind of hard to explain, but I guess the best way I can explain it is like this:   The ASUS Sabertooth Z97 has a PCIe configuration I think I can explain. One of the best boards with the Z97 Chipset. However, due to the limitations of the Z97 chipset, it can only use up to x16 lanes of PCIe at a time. But, it can choose which lanes to use and when. So, if you look at the picture of the Sabertooth board, you can see one x16 slot, one x1 slot, one x8 slot, and one x1 slot. Now, even with a fancy GPU like the 980 or something that will physically take up two slots, in practice it doesn't use more than x8 PCIe lanes. If, for whatever reason, the PCIe card in the top slot is actually using (or set to use) all x16 slots available, then all of the extra slots below the top x16 slot will not be usable, regardless whether they are physically accessible to plug in a card or not. But, this also means you can put two GTX 980s in SLI with this board, having them both run at x8, thereby using all of the x16 lanes available to the processor/chipset.   Now, it's worth pointing out that PCIe lanes have no issue under-performing (i.e., an x16 behaving like an x8 or x4 slot) but obviously cannot perform greater than what they're rated for. With this in mind, look at the Z97 Sabertooth PCIe layout again. You can put a full fledged, dual slot, physcially large GPU like the 980 in the top slot, and still have a combination of slots available for either one second GPU for SLI/Crossfire, or multiple PCIe cards that use less than x8 lanes.   This is a bit simplified, probably not 100% accurate, but I do think it's a pretty good, albeit simplified, explanation for the strange placings of the PCIe slots that you're questioning. I know this was a lot of words but I hope that this made sense.   PS: One thing I do wanna point out. You're kind of not wrong in the ""behind the x16 slot"" idea acutally. Mobo manufactures have actually pretty recently started (sort of) putting PCIe lanes behind the x16 slots. Specifically what I mean by this, is that newer chipsets are starting to support the optional usage, or straight up dedication of PCIe lanes that would typically go to a PCIe slot, instead going to a new and advanced type of SATA port designed to take advantage of the high speeds of SSDs, by sending the data read/write signals through the PCIe lanes instead of (or in conjunction with) the typical SATA lanes."

But aside from that, you can still use x1 cards in x4, x8, or x16 slots.  If your complaint is that video cards take up 100% of your slots then you're likely out of PCIe lanes to begin with and having access to those covered slots wouldn't do you any good."

People can opt in to the ""beta"" channel of Windows to get features and updates before it rolls out to the masses.  As far as Windows Updates themselves go. I've been using automatic updates since like Windows Vista, and I've never had any issue whatsoever. Especially now that SSDs are into play, and rebooting and installing updates takes a whole 5 seconds to do.  The big issue seems to be that Windows 10 might shut down your PC during a game to install ""forced"" updates or something. I highly doubt this is going to happen. I expect some sort of small delay for a couple of hours, maybe, then it will reboot. Giving you time to finish what you're doing."

On that note, i think it's only rebooted the machine for me once. When i did the update to the latest TP build it did not reboot by itself (likely because of the long install process), and wanted me to manually reboot or schedule that reboot.

Some main ones I can think of off hand: root (or administrative) privileges are not as readily available, most software is distributed through checked repositories, and security updates are spotted and addressed more quickly thanks to the power of open-source development.

Half of them are in cd/dvd format.  Edit: I do get issues with windows updates thats why I'm hesitant.

pcgaming,3dmds0,RyanBlack,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:25:49 2015 UTC,"Performance was really poor at moments. I don't know why they do that, its in engine it doesn't need to be rendered real time and run at a steady rate so they ought to be able to make it a perfect 30/60 fps for the purpose of the trailer.  Ignoring the obvious problem of how dishonest it is to use in engine to make people think that is what the game will look like of course. Seems odd to me you would do the one type of intellectual dishonesty thing with in engine and then not make it run well!"
pcgaming,3dmds0,The_Adventurist,6,Fri Jul 17 22:44:29 2015 UTC,There's no reason why the game couldn't look this good in-game. Rome 2 and Atilla are fantastic graphically.

EDIT: In regards to the animations looking 'staged' I'm not referring to all of them obviously, just in particular the things like the character gestures and the 'cinematic' spears being lowered in a wave down the line. As we see in shogun 2 CA are more than capable of producing some pretty fantastic fighting/kill animations like when the giant starts picking people up so I have no doubt those are real."

Basically a little extra depth of field and motion blur and maybe a special animation or two for the orating leaders. Great to see such transparency by CA after the Rome 2 fiasco.

Maybe that makes it unreasonable to build a game like this around, too many different unit types.  Then again, Total War games release new unit packs for like two years after release so that seems right up their alley.  Still, I'm optimistic for this. Obviously gonna hold off until after launch, CA is far too well-known for game-ending bugs. The products end up great, it just takes about 6months longer than you would hope."

pcgaming,3dmds0,MyBananaNoseNoBounds,2,Fri Jul 17 14:18:05 2015 UTC,It will be interesting to see how they balance all of these different unit types.  What is more important to Total War fans - unit diversity or balance? Because having both is incredibly rare.
pcgaming,3dmds0,Baggiez,2,Fri Jul 17 23:54:40 2015 UTC,"Definitely balance, Shogun 2 gets a lot of praise even though theres not many units unique to a faction, whereas Attila's multiplayer is pretty much abandoned with current imbalance with cavalry"
pcgaming,3dmds0,MyBananaNoseNoBounds,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:37:34 2015 UTC,"But, to the best of my understanding, Attila has very little unit/faction diversity and therefore should be very easy to balance.  Introducing mages and tanks seems a much larger potential issue."
pcgaming,3dmds0,shmusko01,3,Fri Jul 17 21:14:44 2015 UTC,"Faction diversity is very little (more than half are germanic hordes), but the unit diversity has a far greater variety than shogun 2, which mostly came down to the rock paper scissors type deal they had (swords>spears>cav) and whether you had samurai or common foot soldiers. In attila theres pikes, spearmen, axe infantry, sword infantry, melee cav, missile cav, cav that function as both melee and missile cav, missile units with varying levels of dmg and armor piercing, etc. Rome 2 and attila use a different unit health system to make shields work, where shields were non existent in shogun 2. Theres also way more passive and activated abilities for units than in s2.  Theres secret bonuses certain units have in attila (ex. Axes are specialized to deal with infantry in general, while normal sword or spear melee dont get ""vs infantry"" bonuses at all), not to mention theres entire factions dedicated to being beserkers or ambushers. The huns also have an ass ton of different cavalry units with different stats and bonuses. It seems they made cavalry way stronger in this game to keep the huns as a viable threat in campaign (small anecdote but in campaign i'm not hesitant at all to charge melee cav into non elite spears, since 9/10 times they win) I could go on and on about this but to keep it short, its not as simple as shogun 2 was at all.   As for the tanks and mages issue for warhammer, dont expect balance at launch at all, especially since theyre also adding flying units. It took them a long time to balance rome 2 and are taking their time with attila  Edit: trying to make this make sense while being awake for 28 hours"
pcgaming,3dmds0,Baggiez,2,Sat Jul 18 10:03:26 2015 UTC,fuck balance. balance is boring. balance has no place in a game like this. i don't want some fucking dumbass goblins to be able to harm my elite outriders or luminarks. assymetry is the best part of strategy games and total war in particular.  that's the reason why most recent total wars have been boring and forgettable while earlier mods like blue lotus and EB were the best play experiences possible.
pcgaming,3dmds0,dragonoid44,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:33:23 2015 UTC,"Balance doesnt mean every unit is equally powerful. Balance means that each faction is equally powerful.

pcgaming,3dmds0,forerunner398,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:35:12 2015 UTC,Any news on if they have updated their engine this time around to support multi threads?  The game has been limited by CPU optimization ever since Shogun 2. Dx12 could do wonders for the series potentially.
pcgaming,3dmds0,AnalTyrant,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:24:26 2015 UTC,"My problem with total war is that the unit control just feels sloppy and tedious for an RTS battle.

pcgaming,3dmds0,forerunner398,2,Sat Jul 18 05:22:30 2015 UTC,"It's based off a very classic battle style, which I'm almost hesitant to call an rts, since you're not controlling individual units usually.

Dota 2 integration broken (was functional at one point) CS:GO integration broken, was announced, but early on there was just a greyed-out motion control option and these days it has been completely removed   Haven't tried TF2 anymore but it at least used to work and was pretty fun, though you are at a disadvantage for using it.  The Portal 2 integration is pretty neat and cool, there are also some custom maps for it, and it seems there at least at some point was PS3 <-> PC crossplay(?) for it, but that said the total playtime for the content amounts to that of MGS: Ground Zeroes.  Apart from that, I've used it as a replacement for WiiMote when playing some dolphin games. It's more responsive but it won't work with Motion+ games and calibrating it correctly is pretty tough. The midi controller is pretty good but I have very limited experience with DAWs and whatnot so I never really could set it up correctly. As a gamepad with gesture controls is can be somewhat cool to use, but most of the time I'd just prefer a pad.  There could also be some fancy-pants uses for 3D-sculpting and whatnot.  I bought it for ~50€ brand new few years ago.  The company is not doing so well, they were developing an advanced system, Hydra 2 of sorts, called STEM but apparently it didn't pass some regulatory tests regarding the magnetic field or something like that, and they've had to constantly redesign the system over and over again.

I try to choose memorable stuff like that for movie nights with friends. We did an Alien/Aliens double feature once, and Silence of the Lambs/The Descent another.

pcgaming,3dlsbw,Emnight,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:14:41 2015 UTC,"The graphics aren't the problem, it's the gameplay. Having to stand still for 10 seconds until your aim is satisfactory isn't exactly a sign of modern game design.  You're free to like it, however I can't play it anymore."
pcgaming,3dlsbw,Tovora,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:16:44 2015 UTC,"This is because Deus Ex was made back when FPSRPGs still had the 'role playing' part.  You have to wait several seconds to aim because your character is untrained in firearms. When you become a master you do not. The ability or inability to shoot people is a reflection of the character's skill, not solely your own skill.  This seems terrible when playing the game as a straight FPS, however Deus Ex is distinctly an FPS RPG, a genre which is no longer developed, really."
pcgaming,3dlsbw,RT17,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:24:01 2015 UTC,"I know, and I enjoyed it back then, however times have changed.  Look at Mass Effect 1 vs 2. Although ME2 isn't as ""pure"" of an RPG as ME1, it significantly improved the combat."
pcgaming,3dlsbw,Tovora,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:25:32 2015 UTC,"I'd say that ME2 was an RPG in the story/dialogue aspect only and had virtually no RPG elements when it came to combat.  The combat was definitely streamlined, but they did so by stripping away all the RPG elements rather than fixing what was broken (primarily the terrible inventory system).  Playing Deus Ex is 'annoying' now because games like it don't exist anymore, and the industry is worse for it."
pcgaming,3dlsbw,RT17,2,Sat Jul 18 12:42:41 2015 UTC,"Personally I never really enjoyed skill based combat in first person games.  An example is Fallout. In Fallout 1 and 2 it's perfect, it's turn based, skill based and works great. It doesn't age poorly.  However in Fallout 3 and New Vegas if I'm going to be aiming the mouse, then the shot should go where I aim."
pcgaming,3dlsbw,Tovora,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:50:11 2015 UTC,"And that's fair enough. However I really like FPSRPGs and have no problem with it, especially in games like Deus Ex that have fully realised noncombat options."
pcgaming,3dlsbw,RT17,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:00:42 2015 UTC,"If you put skill points in pistols you can aim right away. Even better if you crouch.  Back then, people were expected to read manuals."

I remember reading manuals while sitting there waiting for my brother to finish playing his turn so I could have mine.

pcgaming,3dlsbw,LibrarianOfBabel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:49:31 2015 UTC,"Because it will not suddenly be a 2010 level game, with updated everything that I expect or have become used to? It won't suddenly be 2007 level either. It won't be the way intended to be experienced either.  The majority of people really don't use mods, and according to steam statistics and others, it's a very niche population that plays old age games still. I'm just not part of the niche that does. Certain games I played back then I still can't play again.  It's the same reason I've never played FF7 but perhaps now I can."
pcgaming,3dlsbw,Delsana,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:57:50 2015 UTC,"Obviously it won't suddenly become a game with design aesthetics from 2010, but you can hardly say that its current form is not the way its intended to be experienced.  It might not be as pretty, or have some jarring gameplay moments in it for people not willing to adapt to different play styles, but just because its old, doesn't instantly mean its outdated tripe."
pcgaming,3dlsbw,EccTM,0,Sat Jul 18 14:50:57 2015 UTC,But it isn't something I can stand anymore. I require relatively current graphic styles and features these days. It's not negotiable in my interest spectrum. That's not uncommon though. As aforementioned most people don't play old games and mods themselves while healthy in number of use are still a niche thing for most gamers. I don't tend to use them outside of patches.

""Tape-out is the final stage of the design cycle of an integrated circuit, the point at which the artwork of the IC sent to a maker of photomasks.""  AMD is done designing the Integrated Circuits that make up their chip. Their going to make the photomasks, which I guess is like a template, so that a chip foundry can produce their samples. This will take about 3 months for them to get samples of their chip. If everything is good it takes about a year for full mass-production.  FinFet is just a term for the type of transistor. I believe it has less electron leakage, so you can have smaller transistors. This means the chip can have more transistors for a given area. Right now there is a limit to how big a chip can be in area, so cramming more transistors on is important for more processing power. The smaller transistors also help with power efficiency, which also helps keep wattage down, despite having more transistors than a chip with bigger transistors. They always refer to the size as the ""process node"", and you'll see it noted in nanometers (nm)."
pcgaming,3dlc5u,darknecross,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:25:06 2015 UTC,"Some supplemental information and corrections.  Tape-out is basically when all of the pre-silicon design is over with and verified. Then you send the design off to the fab, have masks made, get samples back, and start post-silicon verification. Given the complexity of modern day chips, this is usually an iterative process, so a single chip might tape out multiple times, depending on how many issues were found.   Their going to make the photomasks, which I guess is like a template, so that a chip foundry can produce their samples.   ICs are ""grown"" on silicon wafers via photolithography, which involves a large number of steps to deposit and etch features one layer at a time. Each lithography step needs its own mask, which is basically a pattern that controls exposure onto the wafer surface. These masks are numerous, complicated, very expensive, and take a very long time to produce.   Right now there is a limit to how big a chip can be in area, so cramming more transistors on is important for more processing power.   There's not a technical limit to the area of the chip, but rather an economic one. For reference, the 980 Ti and TITAN X have 600mm2 dies, whereas the Haswell CPUs are under 200mm2. The larger you make your die, the less chips you can salvage per wafer. Also, larger dies are more likely to have manufacturing defects which will bring down yields. Imagine if your chip took up the entire wafer. One small imperfection and the whole thing could be useless. Now, take the same wafer, cut it into a hundred pieces, and one small imperfection means you still have 99 usable chips."
pcgaming,3dlc5u,JohnnyC4ge,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:02:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Nice to know.  I did think though that there was at least a die size limit due to the actual foundries themselves only having a certain size thingy to make them (i dont remember what it's called). I meant that there is a limit to die size due to foundries not having the equipment, though, according to your information I suppose they could. They just don't do that because economics. Thats about right, right?"
pcgaming,3dlc5u,StargateGuy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:40:46 2015 UTC,Die size is just whatever size pattern you want repeated over the wafer. No foundry limits (though they would highly advise against it because of yield).
pcgaming,3dlc5u,daft_inquisitor,4,Sat Jul 18 02:21:08 2015 UTC,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape-out  Taping out generally means that the initial design is finished and it's on to manufacturing.

pcgaming,3dlc5u,JTP709,4,Fri Jul 17 11:34:40 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a disappointment - it was just over hyped. Depending on your needs, the Fury X wins over the 980ti in 4k. The 390/390x and Fury (non-x) forced Nvidia to drop their prices to stay competitive. They were hyped to be the ""end all, be all"" cards for this generation but in the end they were just competitive products."
pcgaming,3dlc5u,obviouslythrowaday,2,Fri Jul 17 11:51:55 2015 UTC,"Not saying the fury x is a disappointment but if your are claiming something is overhyped, it would by definition mean that a product was not as good as people thought it would be and consequently it would be a disappointment."

Shit - I ain't even arguing with ya'll and own a 980ti, but hell: read what I'm saying. Too much animosity towards AMD lately..."
pcgaming,3dlc5u,lazylore,6,Sat Jul 18 02:12:04 2015 UTC,"Com'on, it's a massive disappointment.   Not due to the performance in it self, but let's look at when Nvidia released their lineup, shall we? The 970 and 980, was released in Sep last year, just 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! months before AMD even moves, it's been like this in the two last generations for AMD, and it's fucking pathetic, it's useless, if they don't speed up this shit, they are completely dead. They got no chance. The time AMD releases cards is slower then anything I can remember from either company. Before they used to switch it up, and release cards 3 months within eachothers time frame, so I got no clue what AMD is doing now days. They seem to be resting."
pcgaming,3dlc5u,ddeuced,-6,Fri Jul 17 13:02:03 2015 UTC,"When someone goes to buy a new graphics card, they don't look at two cards, and choose the older one because   just 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! months before AMD even moves   they go ""oh which one is faster? oh that one? ok ill get that one then"".

pcgaming,3dlc5u,Jinxyface,-1,Fri Jul 17 14:03:12 2015 UTC,"Yea, I'm a fanboy because fuck facts. Are you 12 ? One can not look at issues AMD have without being a fanboy of the competitor?   AMD used to release either before or right after them up until the 700 series, where they screwed up. So you really think letting NVIDIA have a free reign on the market for 10 months is an excellent idea? On those 10 months the 970 have gotten so many sales it's not even funny. If AMD can compete now, its irrelevant, as Nvdia needed that competitor when they released, not 10 months later. Not 6 months? A maximum of 3 months  Being competitive isn't purely about having the performance, its about having that in the right time.  But of course, if I look at more then only performance, I must be a fan boy."

pcgaming,3dlc5u,The_Countess,-1,Fri Jul 17 06:04:07 2015 UTC,Microsoft would completely gut AMD as a company and use for making APUs specifically for its own products.

Samsungs 14nm is low  power and it's not even a true 14nm like Intels. Then factor in HMB2 and I just don't see anything being released until late next year.

In fact LPP was designed with a migration from LPE in mind, and they have common design rules.  as for HBM2, they already have hmb now, hmb2 is basically the same thing. i really see no reason why that would cause added delays."

Not 100% on they would only do it if it got enough to secure a publisher but it's logical since there's no way in hell they'll be able to make a massive open world game with the same level of detail as the last game which others have said cost 48 million in it's time to make. Making a modern open world game with what was in shenmue 2 would probably cost a whole lot more than 5 million especially in Japan. For instance the witcher 3 cost 15 million to make and that was over 3 years in Poland which has a low cost of living. I just don't see the game happening without either a shit ton more money or a publisher.
pcgaming,3dma4n,finalgear14,2,Fri Jul 17 19:41:04 2015 UTC,"same level of detail as the last game which others have said cost 48 million in it's time to make.    This was both games combined, not just the original Shenmue. It also included the original (unreleased) Saturn version which included parts of Shenmue II as well. It was probably more like $15-20 Million for the Dreamcast versions of each game, maybe a bit more accounting for inflation."

They quote Suzuki from his AMA, where he said this:   I will say this: if we reach the $5 mil mark, one of the things I really want to do with Shenmue 3 will become a reality. At $10 million, it will truly have the features of an open world.   It won't even come close to $10 million. So does that mean we won't get the true features of an open world? Because that's pretty much what Shenmue is known for.

pcgaming,3di9uq,negroiso,2,Sat Jul 18 02:26:53 2015 UTC,Have you increased the max fps in the BmSystemSettings.ini file? I have a single 980 ti and lowest frames i've gotten is 38 or so.
pcgaming,3di9uq,ImmortalAH,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:59:13 2015 UTC,"I did once, and fps was all over the map. I mean, as most people stated it's pretty stable until the batmobile shows up. I didn't have patience to tough it through the first batmobile level with that god awful gameplay. Even with the patch and a powerful rig it was hideous. We will see what August brings us and if it's worth the SSD space again or not."

pcgaming,3di9uq,Colyer,30,Thu Jul 16 18:33:23 2015 UTC,MGSV:GZ was actually a fantastic PC port. I have no reason to believe that the Phantom Pain should be any different.

pcgaming,3di9uq,ExogenBreach,9,Thu Jul 16 16:01:44 2015 UTC,"""they"" (being KojiPro Japan) had and have little to do with MGSV PC."
pcgaming,3di9uq,aldmerimaneater,4,Thu Jul 16 18:31:37 2015 UTC,"Wow then major props for Konami for making sure the devs porting it did the game justice. Or the FOX engine is just that scaleable and Kojima's vision should be the one lauded. Either way, I'm not phased by Kojima being fired, I'm sure the game will be great. I bet the worst we'll see is microtransactions for MGO, which to be honest, are basically expected for most game's multiplayer portions."
pcgaming,3di9uq,SirFadakar,2,Thu Jul 16 18:45:17 2015 UTC,"The microtransactions were there too in MGO2, it didn't affect the gameplay and were cosmetic items. Only thing major were the online expansion packs that had to be purchased if you wanted to play in the new maps and use the new characters like Raiden and Liquid Ocelot. I'm sure they're not gonna do anything stupid like selling weapons that can't be found in game and such"
pcgaming,3di9uq,Xaolin99,3,Thu Jul 16 19:46:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess so. But hideo got fired really close to the release date, from a development standpoint, so I really hope that he got everything done that he needed to do before he left. I also think that he left/was fired because of the microtransactions in the game, I feel like those were a really point of contention with hideo and konami."
pcgaming,3di9uq,jroddie4,8,Thu Jul 16 16:09:17 2015 UTC,"Kojima is still 100% on board along with his team, as they've said repeatedly. He's still contracted until December. It's likely that he left himself as he's expressed a desire to stop making MGS games since MGS2.  And KojiPro LA are handling the PC version. They did Ground Zeroes too, and have actively asked the Steam community for any suggestions and feedback for TPP.  Also, around the time this drama was happening, the game was in its final stages, with Kojima play testing it like he does during that time (source: Making of MGS2 and Making of MGS4)."
pcgaming,3di9uq,coolnow,16,Thu Jul 16 16:40:36 2015 UTC,"It should be fine, Kojipro LA which is now Konami LA (?, please correct me if I'm incorrect about this) haven't been disbanded and still exist, they're the ones who are doing the PC port. Just the other day they were asking on the steam forums what features/fixes to implement"
pcgaming,3di9uq,coltkickass,7,Thu Jul 16 15:21:54 2015 UTC,Looks like you are correct. They are doing the online component as well as the PC port.
pcgaming,3di9uq,doveenigma13,8,Thu Jul 16 16:18:31 2015 UTC,"The LA team is responsible for MGO and the PC port, they where absorbed by Konami and are not part of the Kojima Productions departure as i understand it."

My buddy has a Titan X and says the same thing, which leads me to believe that these might have been the only cards tested during the porting process. I'm sure that's not how it happened, but in the end the game is playable and not a bad freebie with THIS card."

pcgaming,3di9uq,Anon_Guy1985,2,Thu Jul 16 17:24:36 2015 UTC,"They may even do it for you just as a price match kind of thing as long as the same card is being bundled with MGS on Newegg. Amazon CS is generally really good.  If you get told no at first, say you're not satisfied and the problem will get escalated."
pcgaming,3di9uq,__x_,2,Thu Jul 16 17:31:15 2015 UTC,Good point.  I went ahead and canceled my Amazon order and just switched to Newegg to be safe though!  Thanks for the lookout.

pcgaming,3di9uq,Therabidmonkey,2,Sat Jul 18 12:42:34 2015 UTC,me too man... me too... just bought a Gigabyte G1 Gaming GTX 970 too.
pcgaming,3di9uq,Anon_Guy1985,2,Thu Jul 16 17:13:16 2015 UTC,i got the evga one but now idk keep reading about the 390 being better for high resolution. I am looking at 1440p gaming.
pcgaming,3di9uq,infestedjoker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:29:47 2015 UTC,I feel you.  I just want the highest end 1080p card I can get.  Don't plan on jumping up to 1440p anytime soon.
pcgaming,3di9uq,Anon_Guy1985,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:49:31 2015 UTC,meh the 970 is more then enough for 1440p so ill just stay with that.
pcgaming,3di9uq,infestedjoker,2,Thu Jul 16 18:22:14 2015 UTC,"Not so fast. While the 970 is fine at 1440p RIGHT NOW, in a year or 2 you will start having problems. There are already games out that can max the vram at 1440p, it won't be long before all major games are requiring more than 3.5gb of vram at 1440p.  Now, if you're ok with upgrading in a year or 2 then that's fine, just wanted you to know. I just sold my 970 for a 980ti for this exact reason."
pcgaming,3di9uq,Bearded_Wildcard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:18:33 2015 UTC,But the 980ti is so damn expensive....and im hesitant to cancel the 970 for a 390 since they run so hot and i have a mini itx case. Guess i won't upgrade my monitor then and just stay with a 1080p monitor.
pcgaming,3di9uq,infestedjoker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:50:10 2015 UTC,"Like I said, it's still great at 1440p right now, so you can still get a 1440p monitor, the difference is worth it IMO. I'm more just sending out a friendly PSA that in a couple years a 970 might not be able to play games at high settings in 1440p as games start demanding more vram.  I agree the 980ti is expensive, only reason I got it is because my wife wanted to get me a 2nd 970 as a gift, and for the same money I'd rather have a single 980ti vs. sli 970s."
pcgaming,3di9uq,Bearded_Wildcard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:01:58 2015 UTC,"I see i just think the 970 is a great buy i have a 560 right now lol, and this is probably the last video card ill be able to buy in a while due to a kid on the way, so the video card and a 1440p monitor is my last upgrade for my build."

pcgaming,3dl08i,zmeul,21,Fri Jul 17 03:07:20 2015 UTC,"In terms of raw numbers, performance wise competing cards are relatively close and it basically depends which bracket you're buying into.  However...the way Nvidia has placed themselves within games with their tech/involvement (which as a business they're totally ok to do) means that if I owned an AMD card I would constantly be concerned that the next big game that comes out will have performance problems for whatever reason (AMD/Nvidia's/Developers fault is another debate) and graphical features that I wouldn't have access to.  I want AMD to do well but you can't expect people to gimp their computers (drivers/graphical features/performance in nvidia games) to try and support them. People do what's best for them personally with stuff they can tangibly see in the here and now, regardless if we all get fucked in 5 years time as that's too far away for anyone to care enough.  It's a tough situation and an unfortunate result of the way businesses work. AMD being the more all round consumer friendly company by not making proprietary features exclusive to them in fact harms their bottom line by doing so. What's also a fact is that people really shouldn't be expecting a company to assist with the consumers of another competing company."
pcgaming,3dl08i,JazMac34,12,Fri Jul 17 09:53:45 2015 UTC,"Ironically AMD has done the best job of placing Nvidia as having an edge with their middleware by complaining more than once about gameworks gimping AMDs cards.  Perception is reality and trying to paint Nvidia as the big bad wolf isn't going to affect sales very much when you're painting yourself as a cripple unless you have a definitive plan on how to deal with being a cripple.  Keep in mind, AMD basically has to make their middleware consumer friendly and non-proprietary.  The adoption rate of their middleware relies on this since they don't have a majority of the market.  Even with a majority Nvidia does not have a high adoption rate for the bulk of their proprietary middleware.  If you look at the stuff that AMD did make proprietary, for example TrueAudio, it's adoption rate is abysmal and in all likelyhood it's an abandoned cause at this point.  I mean if AMD didn't sound the gameworks alarm whenever they have the opportunity to do so, they would probably be better off.  Outside of Project Cars and Witcher 3 most of the TWIMTBP titles have been garbo console ports anyway lately (primarily from their strange partner ubisoft).  At this point AMD probably has the better partners, if you consider battlefield, star citizen, civilization and so on.  But as I said earlier perception is reality and the perception in a vast majority of consumers is that Nvidia has a signficant edge when it comes to dev support, drivers and gameworks.  The bottom line though is that the 970 and 980 went uncontested for nearly a year on the market and the 980ti is basically still uncontested for most applications.  AMD is losing the enthusiast market which is a huge deal when you consider that VR is on the horizon and we're probably looking at a 970 to play games on medium settings at those resolutions and framerates.  TL;DR AMD is digging their own grave, to no surprise."

pcgaming,3dl08i,hustl3tree5,4,Sun Jul 19 17:50:30 2015 UTC,"Your points are why I feel the Fury and 3xx series are overpriced. The 4870 and 5870 were runaway successes because while the issues you brought up also existed back then, the 4870($300) and 5870($330) were so reasonably priced compared to nVidia's comparable hardware(GTX280@$650 and GTX480@$500 compared respectively) that one didn't have to worry about taking the plunge.  Had the Fury-X been priced at $550, it would have been a much more compelling part vs the GTX980Ti AND GTX980. Had the Fury been $450, it would have made the GTX980 pointless. The 390x at $350 and the 390 at $300 would have made the GTX970 irrelevant.   So either, AMD is horribly mismanaged by people out of their element and living in their own bubble, or AMD and nVidia are colluding again and price fixing the market to artificially increase prices. In 2009 AMD's top of the line Single GPU Radeon 5870 went for $330, in 2015 AMD's top of the line Single GPU R9-Fury-X goes for $650. If we take inflation and the fact that it's a bigger chip into the equation, AMD is still overpricing the cards by about $100.  My theory about price fixing comes in because if AMD launched their latest cards at their correct prices, it would have pressured nVidia to lower-prices on their cards, and nVidia and AMD ultimately want the prices to continue to artificially increase. This was the case in 2006 when AMD and nVidia were found to be price fixing and the market environment today is remarkably similar."

I think for a lot of people the water cooler is actually an added unnecessary hassle as you don't get a huge amount of gain but have to deal with extra maintenance of water cooling."
pcgaming,3dl08i,JazMac34,6,Fri Jul 17 18:14:39 2015 UTC,"I remember reading them being late with both drivers for Project Cars and Witcher 3   Thing is, Witcher 3 played perfectly fine on their Catalyst 14.12 drivers. Why is it reasonable to expect a 'custom' driver release for every game release?    I think for a lot of people the water cooler is actually an added unnecessary hassle as you don't get a huge amount of gain but have to deal with extra maintenance of water cooling.   There's actually no extra maintenance on a CLC, beyond needing a place in your case to mount the radiator. Considering high end GPUs output 250W+ of heat, CLC designs like the 295X2 and Fury X are long overdue. I think you'll also find a lot number of buyers who are very interested in cooler running, quieter GPUs but still want all the performance."

I think it's that Nvidia have set the tone for drivers as they almost always release one the day a new AAA game comes out which from my experience does give performance improvements (albeit minor a lot of the time).

I think it's that Nvidia have set the tone for drivers as they almost always release one the day a new AAA game comes out which from my experience does give performance improvements (albeit minor a lot of the time).   Wonder if AMD should re-release their current WHQL drivers under a beta tag for each AAA release, just to claim they're on top of it? Nearly every game in question will play fine regardless.   You have to admit though that AMD on average has more issues with games than Nvidia at the very least in recent history.   I'd actually strong disagree with that. Every time a new AAA release drops, there's several threads about tweaking Nvidia's latest beta driver release. This is something I've observed for years now on multiple communities. With Radeons, the game nearly always just works. I rarely have to make any tweaks in Catalyst to get a game to run stable, usually its just to tweak some AA or downclock my 290X. There is only 1 game I've run into in over a decade that's had consistent problems with Radeons, and that was Sim City 4. Maxis blamed AMD, AMD blamed Maxis; issues persisted across the 7 generations of Radeon parts I've owned . . . which makes me inclined to place the blame at Maxis' feet."

This was the case in 2006 when AMD and nVidia were found to be price fixing and the market environment today is remarkably similar.   It really isn't. AMD is hurting for money and they know full well that between roughly equivalent cards at similar/identical price points, people tend to go for Nvidia over AMD most of the time. It's just that their investment in HBM/FinFET probably means they can't afford to price their hardware lower. Today's AMD has been operating at a loss for a while and they don't want to go down deeper. The AMD of 2006 was riding off the Athlon days where they managed to beat Intel and had just purchased ATi.  There's also the marketing side where they don't want to have yet another Intel problem, where they need to go for value-focused advertising and pricing to appear attractive. Their cards are competitive with Nvidia's, pricing them low would make them appear as less than they are."
pcgaming,3dl08i,TSP-FriendlyFire,7,Fri Jul 17 16:31:25 2015 UTC,"You could argue that nVidia shoe-horning GameWorks into these big AAA titles is actually hurting their reputation. While the tech demos do look impressive, and encourage people to buy nV cards, the games they're built into often end up with severe issues.  Watch Dogs, Far Cry 4, Dying Light, Arkham Night(Knight? Light?) and other recent nV titles have either had issues on launch, or ran so poorly on both platforms (AMD and nV cards both) that it makes GameWorks look a lot worse for them.  If you look at unbiased implementations of GW, or where its implemented in games that are playable enough to warrant the extra performance hit, GW isn't that nVidia-biased. Hairworks in FarCry 4 (used for fur on some animals in game) has a lot less impact on AMD cards than Hairworks does on TW3 (where it was found that crazy settings were to blame rather than the software itself).  The only reason I'm against GameWorks is that it almost always means a lower quality of gameplay in other cases, as developers almost always put more effort into making sure nVidia's features are built into a game rather than polishing out bugs or improving the game. In the new Batman's case, the small team was not only overstretched because they had to port a AAA title in a few months, with a team of 12 fucking programmers, but they also had to implement GameWorks (or Warner Bros wouldn't receive nVidia's marketing cash). What you got in the end was a game that while isn't too biased between vendors, actually still hurt nvidia users as they got given a broken game."

Big studios like big scopes but sometimes it's just too big."

pcgaming,3dl08i,StargateGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:53:40 2015 UTC,It's a relatively new problem in regards to the graphical features part (I know there has been the odd bit of proprietary stuff for ages but nothing like gameworks) I'm not saying it's been around for very long. I'm not making the case about where it works well and doesn't either.   I am saying though given the choice between having extra features (pointless to you or not) and consistently better performance across all games sponsored by AMD or Nvidia which we know is the case since I can name several games where an AMD card has had publicly known problems with it but I struggle to think of one where the opposite is true (I'm sure there is one if in case you take me that literally).  I'm going to pick the one which gives me more.

Some of you may remember that US authorities prevented Nvidia from selling their GPUs to Chinese state enterprises to be used in supercomputers only a few months ago.  AMD's GPU may be a bit behind Nvidia but it's only by a bit. Consider the Chinese state-backed Tsinghua Unigroup bidding away 23 billion on Micron. What makes you think that they wouldn't want AMD's GPU capabilities? Their state can pump loads of cash into a losing venture if it is deemed important for the state. And anyway, most of AMD's problems stems from their non-GPU focused business. Focusing on GPUs only would make it a lot more competitive, if all R&D and talent went that way. AMD could start producing GPUs that would be beating NV on its own, without resorting to cheaper prices or bloated power budgets.  Bottom line is that even though USG won't be directly involved in a takeover, they could block a foreign corporation from China for instance and give massive rebates to a corporation from a friendly country (EU/JP/KR) if there isn't one found within the domestic premises.  AMD isn't any corporation. With the advent of deep learning and neural networks, in which GPUs are critical, letting that company go bankrupt will never happen. Someone will buy AMD eventually, the only question is who. The Chinese will be very interested but they know they got no chance of getting it because of the strategic importance of GPUs for deep learning/machine learning which in turn is revolutionizing everything from A.I to how you conduct medical research.  TL;DR Don't worry about your AMD GPU purchases."

Remember all the AMD GPU were selling out a while ago for the Bitcoin and Dogecoin mining craze?   If you look at the supercomputers of the world, most of the top ones that use GPUs are using Nvidia. Partly because of a higher peak performance but also because power efficiency matters.  Dogecoin as an argument in a discussion of supercomputing is fairly archaic(but bonus points for originality). Sure, that mining craze was driven by the fact that AMD GPUs were better at a niche task than NV counterparts(but it's all being done on ASIC custom boards now) and it was a short-lived phenmenom.   AMD's GPU can do OpenCL faster than Nvidia in general. That's why Apple's using AMD over nVidia for the past few years.   The Apple talking point is a red herring. Almost all supercomputers are running Linux and it's well known that AMD's Linux drivers are terrible compared to NV. (If you doubt that, just do some basic googling).  So wrong on both examples as it relates to supercomputing - which is the key reason why AMD will not be allowed to go down. Even if you look at the other, more down-to-earth reason, neural network and machine learning, most of the ImageNet systems are based on Nvidia.   So AMD is behind NV in both of those spaces but the distance is far from massive and that's precisely the point. It would be a very cheap and massively impactful investment for a Chinese SOE to buy AMD and invest fairly paltry amounts into GPU research and get an advanced AI infrastructure that isn't (as) dependent on American technology as it currently is."

The reason nVidia is referred to in a popular position is because they have extensively lobbied the use of CUDA to solidify their position. CUDA-written programs can't be run on AMD GPUs so it's effectively vendor-lock in for supercomputers.   Rewriting all the CUDA applications to OpenCL would be prohibitively expensive when it's easier to just keep buying nVidia GPUs and continue using CUDA. That might change as OpenCL becomes more popular and easier to write/use onto the level as CUDA.   Also, the GCN architecture has a much higher raw-performance capability then nVidia GPUs, it's just that CUDA is supported and developed directly by nVidia which allows much more efficient utilisation of the computational resources compared to OpenCL which requires more work."

Nvidia doesn't even come close!  The only reason why we see more Nvidia in supercomputers, is the use of CUDA. The software they use to run the supercomputers are written to take advantage of CUDA more than OpenCL. If they would change that, we would see much more AMD graphics purchases because raw-performance and efficiency wise, the S9150 and the new 32GB S9170 have absolutely no competition from Nvidia at all.  The driver reasoning is a joke btw. They buy professional, expensive products from either of them because they get support for everything.

Also gains from having lower clocked, lower voltage parts.  There's also not nearly as much interest, especially sustained, in competing for it so IMO it's a poor metric to just look at the top. Maybe if you have some historical plot or general trend's and more different performance metrics that reflect what the industry wants from efficient PCs because most of the big players in cost/efficiency aren't interested in this so...

If you disagree, you are just uneducated. Business is preemptive so your point isn't one. They are preventing powerful hardware from competing. Right now? it doesn't. That's what I'm saying and it's a fact. Right now if you want to do machine learning research on linux, you cannot use AMD. You wanna talk about the future and why companies do what they do out of speculation and the little ideas you have in your head instead of the actual dynamics right now, cool.

AMD does not support Linux or machine learning development. Nothing anyone said changes that and it has nothing to do with my opinion. I could die and I would still be technically right.

Priced reasonable at the time (the $300 4870 competently competed with the $650 GTX280, and the $330 5870 made the $500 GTX480 look like a laughing stock).

Why do people feel the need to support a company? If a company fails to stay competitive (eg: 3dfx, Cyrix) then they go under.Which they did and spoiler alert: PC gaming went on fine without them. That's just business, someone else will come in to take over. PC hardware wont suddenly skyrocket in price by 200% if AMD dies.  It is not our jobs as consumers to make sure they stay in business.They should ensure that by being more competitive with innovation, ideas, prices. I have had Voodoo cards, Riva TNT,  Pentium 1,2s' ,Durons,K6's K7's , I7's . My money goes to whoever has the best product for my current needs.

If fanboys can do one thing, is that they can post moronic posts circle-jerking each other over why a 'innocent' company should be supported over a 'evil, bad super villainous' company.  I wasn't even a nVidia fanboy until this sub went full retard with AMD cum-guzzlers crawling out of the woods to dance under each other's cum 24/7 over here. Now I just post pro-nVidia posts to piss off these retards and they keep downvoting me every time (and I honestly don't give a shit about votes so the amount of downvotes just makes me laugh at the butthurt generated).  Anyways, the reason people are advocating buying AMD here 24/7 is, fanboys. Simple as that.  These people are way too stupid to realize why developers pick Gameworks and why AMD will remain behind nVidia if they can't be arsed to do something to compete with Gameworks. Actually you know what? Maybe they can start competing by creating a display card that actually beats Titan, maybe not with a joke like ""FURY XXXX""."
pcgaming,3dl08i,macieksoft,-2,Sat Jul 18 15:36:22 2015 UTC,"People want to support AMD because they have suffered greatly from nVidia's anti-competitive practices directly aimed at them.

Not to mention Hairworks does not lend itself well to Nvidia cards either.    I would also like to point out something that everyone seems to have already forgotten. Did AMD not do the same thing with Tomb Raider hair tesselation? News back then was the final code was withheld from Nvidia up till the last minute hence they were not able to optimize the game for their cards and Nvidia owners suffered from that. There are no morality, crusades or concern for  PC gamers benefits or future embedded in either companies which gamers seem desperate to inject into AMD or Nvidia's image.  Neither company really cares about you or i. Every business decision is made for nothing but profit.I am 100% sure that given the chance to turn a profit, the AMD higher ups would have no problems screwing gamers over.   Now what is true and what isn't is anyones guess and i'm not on eithers side. Point is that both of them are just companies trying to turn a profit.I am very sure that given time and if anyone cared enough then they would be able to dig up dirt on both companies practicing questionable marketing or business tactics. We as consumers should not let either pull us to their side and do their marketing or fighting for them.

When you're focused on pointing out what could be improved upon and you come across someone who blatantly ignores the flaws that are completely obvious to you, some people can't handle it.  I personally don't care what people enjoy, but I do have a problem with people saying a flaw shouldn't be fixed simply because they themselves don't mind it. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding on that front, that the people think you're saying the game doesn't need fixing?  I'm an old school Quaker, I never really cared for story or graphics in games, I'm all about crisp and smooth gameplay mechanics. If something doesn't work correctly, I will gripe about it, and very likely stay away from the game because of it. Sometimes my reasons are quite miniscule as well.   I have high expectations, and because of it I end up being disappointed most of the time. But when I do encounter a game that is truly exceptional, the feeling is quite amazing and I end up playing the game for a very long time.

Devs won't put in the effort because what's the point if everyone hates it anyway? And now that people have the power to refund, why bother making the game at all if it'll never be profitable? So it's not the case that if everyone is angry things get better, so attacking those who aren't angry is misguided.    Ultimately no one is in control or pulling the strings, so it really doesn't matter what me, you, or anyone else think.

It's the same argument that I would go to when people ask why I have a problem with them continuing to support consoles. Accepting sub par experiences as ""it's fine"" holds the rest of us back who want more from our games.  edit* Don't take my words too seriously though I view the continued support of consoles as a bad thing but I'm not saying we should be forcing people to do anything they don't want to do."
pcgaming,3dloyg,Swatspeedman,2,Fri Jul 17 10:51:42 2015 UTC,"Self imposing something is what we do by nature and how we live. It's how we are built. It's like a way to educate yourself to say, better enjoy a certain book or piece of music, for example by training your hearing or improving your vocabulary and English reading to better understand the plot, symbolism and whatnot."
pcgaming,3dloyg,drogean3,2,Fri Jul 17 14:09:27 2015 UTC,Learning something new is considerably different from changing your entire frame of mind.
pcgaming,3dloyg,cemges,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:56:21 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what learning often is. In Physic, for example, almost every single thing you learn changes your frame of mind. For example concepts like Relative Velocity, or knowing the fact that in free fall mass doesn't affect acceleration of an object, or why astronauts in space float (why there is ""no gravity in space""). It changes the way we think, the way we talk, if that's not frame of mind I don't know what is. Another examples: lots of children think because of movies that when cars break down, they often explode. Given a real life situation they'd usually fear it explode and try to get away from it. After they learn that's not really true, their actions change. That's new information that changes the attitude the child has towards the situation and thus the behavior and emotion it experiences, there should be much less fear now that the child knows there's no imminent danger. I don't know how you define frame of mind, I think that term is quite loose and subjective, but I think you'll agree given those examples that learning is in many cases exactly changing the frame of mind. Most would say expending it. Especially when it comes to learning physics and math where you literally change your outlook on a given problem as you learn new material.  BTW When you say entire, well, I don't think whats being discussed here (being excited about video games or not) is anything close to entire, thou how much exactly is ""entire"", is also subjective... The brain is always changing anyway."
pcgaming,3dloyg,JestinMask,2,Fri Jul 17 17:52:20 2015 UTC,Doesn't mean it's good to do so though even if it's in our nature.  Example:  A murderer is only what he is because of the events in his life + genetics which lead him to be what he is but we shouldn't just let him continue with what he's doing.
pcgaming,3dloyg,Bingoose,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:57:17 2015 UTC,"What I meant was that self imposing is how we learn (the nature of learning), how we change. We don't really have a choice. Of course the learning, or the change, can be negative or positive (which would generally be subjective judgment), but I just meant that, this behavior of someone thinking to himself ""hmm maybe I should be less excited about x, or more excited about y"" is how we learn, and that learning can be good. Yes, it can be bad too, sure.  In your example however it seems that you would support what I'm saying, because it would be specifically in our interest that the murderer self imposes on himself a new kind of behavior, one that, well, doesn't murder... And so we see how by nature, when we self impose on us something, we change. That change is also influenced by the outside and such, one could argue many thing on that topic but well, I don't think any concept of what's responsible for change really conflicts with my thoughts on this.   TL;DR Self imposing, or self teaching, or anything initiated ""by the self"", can be a form of learning, and if not necessarily than can be some form of change, and in practice, and it's easy to think of examples, it can lead to us better enjoying something (like video games or media in general)."

The reason it's unpopular is because the more people that put up with problems in games, the more problems there will be as games are rushed to release and rely on hype/trailers instead of making a good game.

Everyone's top objective in life is the same whether they agree or not...happiness (by that I mean you're well being) this ties in with never being able to do a selfless good deed. Every action you make is an attempt at what you interpret as making you happier in your life.   If you try to go against that you will fail as you will get the gratification at trying to prove me wrong thus inadvertently proving me right.  e.g. A man sacrifices himself to save another, he obviously viewed that saving that mans life was worth the brief gratification he would get before he died sacrificing himself as more valuable to him than the rest of his own life had he not.  edit* My answer is definitely the correct one. Ask yourself this, why would you want to be more intelligent? To make yourself happier ofc...my question in contrast specifically states you're unhappy if you pick the intelligent route."

Those words makes an even stronger statement than what you phrased: ""intelligent people are more likely to be unhappy"".  To rephrase something someone else said... IMO, you have an answer, and I also have an answer. There is no right answer or correct answer.  No, I would not like to be more intelligent to make myself happier. There is desire, instinct, there are concepts more powerful that can rule the mind and underline it than emotions like happiness. Or whose to say it's not the other way around? We seek something first, and learn to derive happiness of it? Like the Qunari from dragon age, first given a purpose, than learning to find satisfaction therein? And what is the relationship between satisfaction and happiness? a whole other problem. Certainly not my definition of happy, and I also think not your definition of happy. Happiness, in this very post we can see, means a great different things to a great different people, and in reality is complex as fuck, presumably most commonly refereed to as an emotion. And that's just another Pandora's box waiting to be opened, with neural pathways, chemical processes and electrical interactions, and all other manner of various ""help I have no idea and am lost"" material..."
pcgaming,3dloyg,mad_cows,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:23:10 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand my meaning of happiness. I'm not talking just about the emotion of feeling happy as such.  Desire, instinct and these ""more powerful concepts"" you're talking about would all fall under my category of ""Well being"" as everything that people do is to better themselves or others which in turn betters themselves.  Lets takes your answer for why you would want to be more intelligent...Desire...why do you have the desire? because of instinct...why do you have the instinct? many answers to this (genetics, environment, hell The Force if that means something to you) but they all will lead to the answer to make me happy which in turn leads to the answer it feels good and is the only thing that ultimately makes you feel good by my definition. Call it happiness, goodness, well being or whatever it's the same basic point you come down to when you break it all down.  These concepts more powerful that can rule the mind that you speak of, you'll need to give more context than that as it's vague and doesn't really mean anything.  I don't think an imaginary race which you can make them up as anything in a video game is really a good base to make an argument off of, we're talking about humans not any other creature real or imaginary.   The Qunari's concept of purpose before happiness doesn't make even any sense, what makes it a purpose? Why do it in the first place? What is the motivation behind it?  Satisfaction and happiness in my meaning as explained above fall under the same category and definitely fits in my definition. Whether people interpret it differently is irrelevant it's the same thing we all strive towards whatever you want to call it."

pcgaming,3dloyg,jouthrow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:18:07 2015 UTC,"With high expectations, you get used to being disappointed. Tho I think having high expectations isn't just one thing, because it has a lot to do with your understanding of the genre in question, your experience with relevant games as well as what you specifically enjoy in said genre.  If you like first person shooters with crazy action, explosions and just insane over the top stuff, you're going to have very different expectations from someone who enjoys meticulous tactical gameplay. And if you both happen to be looking forward to the same game, at least one of you is going to be disappointed, possibly both.  For me it's very important that all the small details are done right in FPS games. Stuff like mouse settings, keybindings, optimization, unlocked framerate, monitor refresh rate support, field of view and so on. I'm used to enjoying games where those things are done right, and if they aren't it feels like the developers were slacking.  EDIT: So I guess personally I feel that if you have high expectations that are due to detailed understanding of what you want from a game it is enormously satisfying when your needs are met."
pcgaming,3dloyg,hazehk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:19:51 2015 UTC,"That's a very interesting take on it.   But when those needs are not met, does your disappointment outweigh that potentially enormous satisfaction that could have resulted if your needs were met? Or is it incomparable?"
pcgaming,3dloyg,abacabbmk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:27:23 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I feel that when your expectations are really high, you then start to expect them to not be met. So it's actually cynicism in a way I guess. I used to get very excited about games, but over the years I've learned to understand game design and gameplay mechanics so that I know what can and cannot be judged from gameplay videos for example, and that even tho a game looks fun in a video, it's possible that it's not very pleasant to play and so forth.  It's interesting actually, because I am usually an optimist, but having been a huge fan of games for so long, I am quite a pessimist when it comes to games. At least when it comes to potentially really enjoying a game. I am interested in most games and want to find out how the gameplay mechanics work and so forth, but when it comes to me actually wanting to play a game and enjoy it, I am very careful about getting my hopes up.  I think as a result I love creating gameplay mechanics myself, because I know exactly what I enjoy, and being able to create the mechanics I enjoy is an amazing feeling."

I was happy with my purchase.  $60  I played Fallout 3 for 36 hours.  It was a lot of fun.  Not the same kind of fun as CoD4.  Definitely a cool experience.  $60  I played TF2 for well over 700 hours (probably double this, but I don't have records that far back).  I finished all of the HL2 expansions, and Portal.  3 different experiences I had with the Orange Box, all fun.   $60  These experiences are not equal to me.  I rarely replay games, so I never dove deeper into Fallout 3.  I probably could have gotten more game time, but I really enjoyed the experience I had.

So whether you think video games are art or not, we shouldn't treat it like being considered art is a badge of honour. Because it isn't.  On Topic: I'm not going to judge it before it's out. New ideas are good, and while a video game that's designed to become unplayable isn't something that I really like the idea of, if I can get my monies worth from it then I don't really care.

All of these creative decisions have combined to create a fun experience. Tetris is a classic, by which I mean it remains popular long after its 'normal' commercial lifetime. I think it is worth study to learn how to create 'fun'.   To get to the art, Tetris is the tangible result of a creative activity that has created an experience for the player (viewer).

Art interpretation is a highly debatable topic though so if you expected the conversation to be one sided I'm sorry to disappoint. People have different opinions. That's what makes conversation so beneficial.    And also, you pointing out that games are lots of little individual art peices. Then so is an art gallery. And if they are art, then so is the world. Everything is art. It becomes a pointless word.   Why does it become pointless? If everything is art does that mean that all art is equal?  I do believe the world is art. I believe that the stars are a cosmic work of art. Big Bang? God? Fuck, I don't know. When I look at the sky I feel I'm looking at a magnificent work of art though. I can also walk out into the woods and be in awe of the scenery. I feel that I am standing in a work of art created by mother nature. Both of those things have much more impact to me personally that any painting created by man.  I'm a dumbass for thinking that I guess. What we allow to be classified as art should be strictly governed."
pcgaming,3djjzo,Descatusat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:52:08 2015 UTC,"So if it should be goverened, don't bitch about how it's all art, and bring in technicalities about art.  If every thing is art, then art just means thing.   You are free to comment as you choose, but be prepared for what comes, because others have that same freedom."
pcgaming,3djjzo,daft_inquisitor,-2,Fri Jul 17 00:03:53 2015 UTC,"I rephrased. Any better?   I'll ask you this then. What makes something art?    Elitism, pure and simple. Something is only art because everybody insists it is. 95% of people don't make any attempt to classify games as art, it's only that snobby and obnoxious 5% that do."
pcgaming,3djjzo,Descatusat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:21:10 2015 UTC,"The question was rhetorical. You know that though. Art is subjective in any form. I was just pointing out that I found it odd that you have the power to dictate what is or is not art.   You could say you don't think games are art and no one could argue. You stated that games are not art in the form of fact. I would imagine you do not think any form of music is art either?  What exactly is art to you?  Games are made up of artwork that is playable. Hell, I'd even argue that there is an artistic aspect of coding a game. AI for example, I would absolutely consider artistic. Some games are worse pieces than others though, same as any art form. I'd still have to say the worst of them are still art though. Just art not worth viewing."
pcgaming,3djjzo,RubyVesper,0,Thu Jul 16 21:28:44 2015 UTC,"The question was rhetorical. You know that though.   No, I didn't. It sounded like you asked a serious question.   You could say you don't think games are art and no one could argue. You stated that games are not art in the form of fact.   That actually is not what I said at all. Your statement was, ""Games are supposed to be art"". I said, in fact, that I hate people that say such stupid things. Indeed, some games are made to be art, but games as a medium are not such. If you want to interpret a game as being artistic, I can't stop you there. As I said in another post, anything can be artistic, but that doesn't mean that every single expression of an action is art.  Poetry can be art, but that doesn't mean every written word is meant to be art. Songs can be art, but that doesn't mean every single strum of an instrument or every sung word is also meant to be art. It can just be expression for the sake of expression. And if you're arguing that all expression is, in and of itself, art, then I think we have an issue. Because, really, if everything is art, then nothing is.  Art is only art when the majority agrees that it is art. As you said yourself, art is subjective, so if enough people want to classify any single thing as art, then technically it becomes so. However, ""games as art"" is a very narrow category as it is. Very few games attempt to be a work of art, and very few people who follow games will acknowledge individual works as works of art. But nobody, I repeat nobody, out there is trying to make the argument that ""all games are supposed to be art"". That's just a bloody moronic statement. If you truly think that, I am sorry to say, you are in the severe minority here. And, in fact, for the basis and definition of art, you would be wrong."
pcgaming,3djjzo,mesofire,2,Thu Jul 16 21:31:11 2015 UTC,"My bad. It was rhetorical because ""art"" cannot be defined by a single man, neither you or I.

pcgaming,3djjzo,psomaster226,-6,Thu Jul 16 21:43:46 2015 UTC,"It's obvious that you're missing why I'm upset, or that I haven't made it clear enough. Back in ""The Day"" the majority of multilayer games had community run servers. i.e. You could download the server software and run your own game server. Even if the publisher/developer stopped supporting the game you could still play as long as you, or somebody else was hosting a server. Even if the third party matchmaking service died, you could still connect directly or the community could replace it  Now it's becoming more popular, for reasons of shilling DLC and preventing modding, to either lock the use of the server software to approved providers or to simply not release the server software at all and use a matchmaking service or an always-online connection. The problem with this is that once the publisher/developers decide to drop support, the game is over. It becomes unplayable because the end user does not have access to the tools necessary to work around the lack of a matchmaking service or servers.   I'm rather upset because the developer of this game has taken one of the most toxic aspects in the design and lifecycle of modern multilayer games and turned it into a damned advertised feature that they're using to help sell the game."
pcgaming,3djjzo,TheFriskySpatula,6,Thu Jul 16 22:03:23 2015 UTC,"That is a very reasonable complaint against something which isn't an example of your tend.  Flock, is very upfront about what it is and what they are doing, it is not on the same level as closed server multiplayer games where they lock you in to sell more dlc and map packs.  So where as I get and agree with your complaint in general, I think this example is not the outrage you think it is."

I know that isn't what the developer's are actually going for, but it still feels that way at the end of the day. You can argue that MMO's and just about every other online multiplayer is at the mercy of the servers staying on, but I burn out far before servers for the games I've played have ever gone down."

pcgaming,3djjzo,llsektorll,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:57:36 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea. Terrible in it's current form.  An experiment like this should only be conducted by an established company, which has already proven it self. Say, for instance, that a new Silent Hill game would come out with this principle, and it would be designed by Kojima. We already know Kojima games can be great, and the Silent Hill series has some great games in it. An experiment like this would cause a lot of pre-orders and purchases on release, and the game might still be shit, but it's a gamble with a reason to take it; you already know the people behind it can make great (horror) games.   With a very unknown dev like this (it's their first real game, they just got out of university) the chance of this being one of them saying 'Guys, the game is going to be shit, but I've got an idea to get as much publicity and early sales as possible' is way too high.   The only way to make this OK is being very transparant about the estimated time the game will be playable, and sending out review copies in time. If reviewers can tell us whether the game is any good prior to release, and we know that we will be able to play it for a decent period of time (a couple of months), and the pricetag is lower than you can expect for a horror game of this size (since you can't play it after some time), they might make it an OK experiment. Since, at this moment, none of these things are known, I advice people to stay away from it for now."

I think it was subconsciously inspired a little by r/thebutton. I have never heard of a design like this before and then a few days later I read this. It is slightly different as it has lives instead of continuing as long as there are players but it's spookily similar to the idea I was imagining. Stuff like this creeps me out Haha.

I wouldn't play something knowing it is designed to not let me play it ever again just because other people were also playing. The two points cancel each other. Sell lots of copies. The more we sell, the faster the game becomes unsellable, and the shorter time people get to play. So essentially its just a model waiting to flop, or become popular, but in the process become unplayable and piss everyone off.  Edit: and just want to throw in I would not buy this because I like to pick up games weeks/months/years down the line.

pcgaming,3djvyl,Alexanderbander,5,Fri Jul 17 19:39:26 2015 UTC,So...how exactly is that not mediocre?
pcgaming,3djvyl,cManks,7,Fri Jul 17 13:54:23 2015 UTC,"Because it actually manages to keep you hooked up from the beginning for a relatively long time. A mediocre game is one you pick up, and feel nothing from beginning to end. But that's not the case with Skyrim. For some reason, Bethesda really managed to get the ""This is so amazing"" factor, just not for long enough.  If you want an example of a mediocre game (albeit with a fun combat system), play Kingdoms of Amalur:Reckoning. If you feel most content on Skyrim is basically copypasted, you'd be surprised with KoA. If you think the NPCs and dungeons are generic, look at KoA. And if you think Skyrim drags on a bit too much, you won't even finish KoA unless you force yourself to speedrun it."
pcgaming,3djvyl,yamsilvius,2,Fri Jul 17 14:07:06 2015 UTC,"As someone who owns Skyrim but never played it (I know), are there mods that fix all of these issues with the game?"
pcgaming,3djvyl,cutt88,3,Fri Jul 17 13:20:48 2015 UTC,I think the booby mod fixes everything.
pcgaming,3djvyl,JohnnyC4ge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:50:47 2015 UTC,"What I specifically mentioned: not really, only the dragons can be fixed to some extent.  Skyrim has a huge issue: it's supposed to be an RPG, but it sucks at storytelling and characters, so at least you get good combat...except you don't. Combat is literally just swing your sword/hammer/dagger/whatever from left to right over and over again, with the same animation. So you end up with a bad RPG (story and skills wise) with bad combat.  The skill tree can be fixed with mods, and you can find a handful of mods with interesting dungeons. One of my favourite mods adds like 100-200 NPCs, and you can tell that there was some good intent and love put into each and every one of them.  But the feeling that the cities are tiny, that the faction quests are just silly and that the combat really is just swinging swords never goes away. I remember I added a mod (Jaysus swords? I believe) that adds 8 or so new weapon types, including spears. Well, the spears had the very same swinging animations. No thrusting, no superior range, just swinging.  There's some mods with excellent ideas that add new ""skills"", like dodging/rolling, actual ""spellsword"" archetypes and things like ""shoot an arrow and blink to said spot, throw a barrage of arrows"" for bows to name a few examples. The problem is, because they use a scripting system that is already slow and clunky and not fully integrated into the core of the game, there's huge delays when you try to use those. I'm talking 1-2 seconds between you pressing the ""dodge"" button and you actually starting the dodge animation.  Still, don't get me wrong, Skyrim is a very enjoyable game, and even if just vanilla, I'd be surprised if you didn't play at least 10 hours before really noticing those flaws. With mods, and without painfully forcing yourself to complete areas you don't enjoy, it can very easily add to at least 40-50 hours..  But it just ends up leaving you with a weird feeling of emptyness after a while.  If anything, I'd highly suggest avoiding the main quest right after you find the first dragon (this is to let dragons spawn in the world) and avoid generic looking areas. Try to go directly for the big shrines and perhaps the dwemer ruins, those are the only interesting vanilla areas."
pcgaming,3djvyl,yamsilvius,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:45:07 2015 UTC,"Try Requiem. Combat is no longer just swinging. It completely changes the tactical side of things. And with a combat system that rewards strategy and a good build you once again get a sense of achievement. Also the deleveled world means you feel yourself getting stronger and being able to access new areas where you didn't stand a chance before. Honestly it 'fixes' the feeling of emptiness vanilla sky rim can induce after a bit.  Edit: Deleveled meaning even the repetitive draugr crypts have surprises in them and things added by hand to make exploring interesting again. Add the mod 'interesting npc's' for way better characters/side quests than  Bethesda made, for a game experienced that keeps the wow factor till the end."
pcgaming,3djvyl,Acidicity,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:32:53 2015 UTC,"I've tried it. No, it really doesn't change the combat but it turns it into a tedious, massive quick load fest. ""Timed blocking!"" Well, yes, many mods implement timed blocking actually. Requiem just makes standard blocking useless in favour of timed blocking. Stamina/Magicka regen are absolutely awful. One thing I love about Dragon Age:Origins is that, while combat is extremely tactical and it can last for a while, the energy/health/mana regen is really quick out of combat, letting you tackle the next encounter almost immediately. You might argue that that deters from the whole ""plan how you use your consumables/resources"", which is technically true, but specifically in skyrim, it just makes things slower since you can heal yourself, wait for mana, then heal yourself again. NWN had a similar problem, being D&D rules, you had to rest to replenish your spells. But in regards to resource management, some areas specifically didn't let you rest.  Combat is a bit more brutal and fast paced overall, and it rewards glass cannons more than any other build. But the things you can do in combat are literally the same. The weapons are the same, with the same attacks.  I've tried almost every combat and skilltree mod in Skyrim, including Requiem, SPERG, SkyRe, Perkus Maximus, and Duel-deadly combat-the other one. Also, while not technically a combat mod, ""Death alternative"" is a really good addition when you're playing these mods that have enemies/areas that are basically one hit KO's, if only to save your sanity over quickloading over and over again.  Overall, my favourite was PerMa+a myriad of other minor weapon, magic, and combat mods.  It's still the same thing. While I like the idea of a deleveled world, it only forces you to stay in one area until you're strong enough to get to the next one if it's poorly done. And Skyrim's individual areas are really boring; it's only a good game when you consider the whole picture.  There are many tiny things you can do to make Skyrim's combat enjoyable. One of them certainly is ""you can't become a god at lvl 14"". But the combat is still flawed at its core. I've said it like 5 times now, but having basically the same role for every one handed weapon and two handed weapon is just silly. A short sword should be an all around good rounder, with quick slashes and some thrusts. A warhammer should be a high risk/high reward weapon, able to effectively bypass armor. A two handed spear should be a thrusting weapon, giving you superior (and I really mean superior) range, but be awful at short range (at that point, you'd better of changing to a short sword).  If you want an example of a style of combat that is somewhat similar to skyrim, but has all of these, play Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. It behaves like Skyrim in many regards, including the slow ""let me swing this sword 180º from left to right"". But each weapon has it's advantages and its flaws, some are signfiicantly faster, some have significantly better range. Chivalry still has many flaws (some may call it ""features"", but, well, let me just say that you can accelerate your swings by moving the mouse in a specific pattern) but it's, for the most part, a good example of how you should do Skyrim combat."

However, they did make Skyrim a little more action/wow oriented than previous games in the series. Not just because of better visuals, but it seemed like they put a lot more work into those first few hours than the rest of the game in a lot of ways, from dungeon complexity to bosses to Dragons to Characters. I want a game to be consistent, so if the first few hours are good, then I can enjoy the rest just as much."

The deal that delivered by Steam and Bethesda was an out right sham. It'd be like if you went to get your car modded and before the owner of the car shop saw a dime he had to install twenty exhaust mods  because Toyota had to get paid first because they made the car and weren't going to pay the mod shop anything until they made $10,000 in profit."

pcgaming,3djvyl,Cbird54,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:15:56 2015 UTC,"Alright I think the difference is that a Toyota certified part shop deals parts made by Toyota, where as a custom parts mod shop installs third party or custom parts that Toyota didn't create. Toyota doesn't have a right to make money off those custom parts simply because they're being installed on a Toyota vehicle and they don't. What was being implemented by Steam would have been a scenario where Toyota decided that all of the sudden it needed to make money off those custom parts because they supplied the cars which the modders are putting their custom parts onto."
pcgaming,3djvyl,Cbird54,3,Fri Jul 17 13:30:25 2015 UTC,"I believe the misconception of the comparison between cars and games is that most only view it as a two part system i.e. car mods (place to install mods for car) and the car (manufacturer), where as it should be a thee part system consisting of the:   car manufacturer (Bethesda) the car mod shop (Steam) the car mod (person making the mod)   Now, consider this, you buy your supercharger for your nice muscle car because more torque is fun. You do not have to pay royalties to the car manufacturer for that supercharger, but to the manufacturer of that part. Now, you have two options, one is taking it to a specialist shop to install it for you, the other is to install it yourself.  And that is the issue, if you take it to a shop, you are expecting a level of quality so that supercharger functions to it's peak performance.  So, let us look at the game aspect of this. At this current state, installing the mods are on the consumer's end of responsibility to install and get it to function correctly. There is no level of quality control expected from a professional shop (Steam) to make all your mods on the car to function cohesively, and there is certainly no involvement of your car's manufacturer at all.  In the end, Bethesda Softworks can cry all they want about it being their IP, but all they will do is kill the mod scene. Where modders will still find a way to tackle their issue with the game, but will not release it to the public in fear of DMCA takedowns and IP infringements. And let's face it, Skyrim, Fallout et al  get incredibly boring after the 20th playthrough and wouldn't survive the longevity that they currently relish in without them. Not to mention the unofficial bug patches that are roaming around.  If Bethesda Softworks want a dime, they need to release a game where these 'modded patches' aren't needed and that the modders actually get most of the cut.  Edit: Words and stuff."
pcgaming,3djvyl,MentalAss,0,Fri Jul 17 14:06:59 2015 UTC,People have donate buttons on their mod pages.

As a result they very quickly created an active and very high quality modding community for Arma 3, with loads of new content and big teams working together.

You ruin the modding community by making it about money (look at steam greenlight), you ruin the longevity of the game by making the customer pay for anything that'll change the games original experience and you stop all future sales because those imgur galleries that made Skyrim look photorealistic will come with a price tag.

When you inject a paywall straight into that it will destroy that dynamic completely. A lot of the great mods we love simply would not exist in a system like that.  Their work ends with the game assets and mod tools. You saying otherwise robs modders of all the hard work they put into their mods. Bethesda does not own their time and talent.  Lots of ideas die in the crib, this is true of the gaming industry as well as the modding community. For all the ones that die at the start, or simply fade away, there are plenty more that do make it, that's the nature of open development. If paid modding ever becomes standard in PC gaming then that's one more reason not to bother with PC gaming at all, since it will essentially be DLC 2.0.  You say you have no right to deny them well I say I do, and I will do my best to stop them in whatever capacity I can, because I know the value of PC modding and what its loss will mean for the platform as a whole."
pcgaming,3djvyl,CaptainHijinx,-5,Fri Jul 17 21:19:01 2015 UTC,"Not very long? Gaming for over 25 years and modding for 15 in various ways.   Then you should know how many mods fail because people have other things to do. How many of those mods would have been finished if people had the money to incentivize them? If modding isn't going to get them anywhere of course they are going to focus on University.   They're not forcing people to make paid mods, they're just completely undermining the entire community system behind it to the point that it will be destroyed,   If you think all the mod authors are just going to turn evil and money hungry and get competitive sure. But paid modding can also help make professionals more interested and bring them into making mods as well, which is beneficial. It isn't all negatives to this, there are positives as well, and paid modding isn't by any means guaranteed to destroy the community.   Bethesda does not own their time and talent.   You're right, Bethesda doesn't, modders do. So they should be able to do with their time and talent what they want. If they want to apply their time and talent creating mods to sell on Steam they should be able to do that.    For all the ones that die at the start, or simply fade away, there are plenty more that do make it   This isn't true of the modding community. For every decent sized mod that gets finished, a whole lot of others just don't. And there's no reason for people to finish these mods when it's just a hobby.   You say you have no right to deny them well I say I do   What right do you have to deny someone selling the content they made? You act like paid modding is the guaranteed downfall of the modding community, when it really isn't. Modding has gotten far more professional now than it has ever been. With the amount of hard work and time people are putting into it now, being paid for their work really isn't that far-fetched."
pcgaming,3djvyl,Cottonbuff,2,Fri Jul 17 09:39:20 2015 UTC,"Mod fails because people have other things to do. That's true and in the nature of the modding scene. If you think money would be a incentive to stop people having other things to do then I think you are dead wrong. Unless you would advice a 19 year old kid whom made a pretty decent mod to stay out of university because they made a bit of pocket change from selling there mod?   And talking about money, it's known you get 25% of the total amount. If your mod has dependencies it's a decent thing to split up your 25%. But just say you keep that 25%, how much would you need to sell to get a decent return?    You need to make $4690 a month just to get to minimum wage. Well of course that is before taxes because where I live, not only is the minimum wage much higher then the US but making that kind of money also means you need to start up a company and pay taxes. So the total amount you need to make is higher then the number I gave you.  Knowing that a mod as falskaar takes months/years to complete. Who is going to pay the bills? Monetizing mods will never lead the pad to large expansions but it will carve a pad with stores full of small and cheaper mods that are easy to make."
pcgaming,3djvyl,bTrixy,0,Fri Jul 17 10:02:13 2015 UTC,"What we saw wasn't significant that's true, but it was a step in the right direction I think. The execution was definitely the problem with the system that was created for paid mods. I just don't think that the idea of paid mods itself is necessarily bad. Selling mods will make the modders a lot more than what they were making before. There is bound to be smaller mods sure, but that's already the case. With so many smaller mods, ones like Falskaar are a lot more popular and will sell a lot better.  In the state it's in now it won't make people a living, but it's a lot more incentive to work on and finish mods. If the mod creators want to be paid for their work, in the end I think they should be able to."
pcgaming,3djvyl,Cottonbuff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:19:47 2015 UTC,"You keep saying that like a mantra, as if it's supposed to be some kind of point. Lots of mods don't get finished, that's not a tragedy. It's just how it is. No idea is ever wasted though, plenty of mods don't get finished, but the ideas propagate and continue into mods that do. I think it's very successful as it stands.  I just know that every one of the best modding scenes on PC is actively against paid modding encroaching on their communities (ES, Fallout, Total War) Do you know of any that have come out in favour? Not individuals but the communities themselves. You're not the spokesperson for them, they can and have spoken as a group for themselves.  Only Bethesda is pushing this, which they really have no right to do. Modding has done just fine for decades as a not for profit collective of people who enjoy being creative. It may not destroy it, but it will change it fundamentally forever, and once that modding community is gone, there is no getting it back. This is something that has existed for a long time without large companies moving in to take control of it for financial reasons. It's not something that should be surrendered on a whim.  There is no point in debating this with you, as this is a fundamental difference in ideologies. I grew up watching the scene develop from nothing, and I don't much fancy surrendering it to a company just like that because it might be beneficial to just a few people and very lucrative for the company involved. PC has and always will be about open development, that's how it has thrived and stayed alive. If Bethesda and other game companies take control of modding scenes, it will be under their control, by their standards, and by their rules. Not something any PC gamer should be interested in seeing."

I mean it's a community, not a company, they can't exactly make official statements.   There is no point in debating this with you, as this is a fundamental difference in ideologies.

pcgaming,3djvyl,Pmang6,47,Fri Jul 17 12:51:08 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people don't mention this simple fact why paid mods will never work : Mods aren't reliable.  When people pay for something, they expect it to work as advertised. The people who download the mods are no longer freeloaders, they're customers. So let's say you pay for a mod, and it doesn't work. Maybe it conflicts with another paid mod, or maybe the new patch broke it. What then? Does that mean you have to choose between one paid mod and another paid mod? You paid for them both, you expect them to work. See, when people mod games, they install hundreds of mods. It's like a challenge to get as many modifications on one game as possible before the game breaks because of inter-modification compatibility issues.   There is the other issue where modders use work done by other modders, causing dependencies between mods. This is all goody goody when the mods they are making are for fun, but when money is involve, it causes issues with copyrights.   Paid modding simply cannot work. Either they implement a very inhibitive system where modders cannot modify anything other than cosmetic items to eliminate mod compatibility issues (which will suck as all mods will basically be endless amounts of item DLC which we're sick and tired of already), or they don't have a paid modding system at all."
pcgaming,3djvyl,johnk419,12,Fri Jul 17 13:09:42 2015 UTC,"This is the single biggest issue with paid mods IMO. As someone who has used countless mods for countless games and seen on the whole how unreliable they are, I will never ever pay for a mod unless it's to donate to a modder whose work I have greatly enjoyed. It's basically paying for uncertainty. Game updates can and will break mods, and if you have more than a couple major mods installed then incompatibility issues will arise. I find it funny that Bethesda is championing this given how notoriously unreliable mods are for their games: prone to incompatibility issues and often reliant on other mods or software. Even with refunds, what's to stop a mod being broken down the line and out of the refund window? I predict a healthy pirate market for mods, and I can totally understand why. The only solutions IMO are to make donating  to modders an active and highly encouraged thing or to lock down mods so that the only ones being sold have some sort of support our guarantee from Bethesda. Donations seem like the right thing to do here."
pcgaming,3djvyl,TittyMcFagerson,4,Fri Jul 17 17:38:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. There was a mod for Terraria that added really good functionality for using an Xbox 360 controller to the game. This was back in version 1.1. I loved it.  Cue the release of version 1.2. The mod is broken. The mod maker has no intention of updating it since he's gone on to other projects. I'm really bummed out but I'm not angry. If I'd paid money I would have been pissed at the mod maker.   Importantly too, if the Terraria devs had taken money for the mod they would have had some responsibility to make sure that their updates didn't break those mods. Who wants that kind of liability?"

So just like anything else, there is some kind of involvement that we're going to have in that,""   That involvement is that people have to buy your game to use mods.  That's a huge involvement.  Why do you need a slice of every piece of the action along the way?    Consider this: Modders can either make extra assets, or use existing assets from the game.  Let's assume a mod uses only assets from the game - Bethesda was paid by the customer for access to those assets (through the interface of the completed game).  Now Mr or Mrs A. Modder comes along and restructures those assets into new content.  The content was designed by A. Modder; they did all of the work restructuring it.  I understand a person wanting to be paid for their work.  What entitles Bethesda to levy a tax on that work, if both the customer and A. Modder both already paid to get access to those assets?  I understand that Bethesda wants the money, but is there any reasonable argument as to why they should be entitled to it?"
pcgaming,3djvyl,ProfessorStupidCool,2,Fri Jul 17 00:10:02 2015 UTC,"The end-user and modder have only paid for whatever the EULA they accepted says they've paid for. Commonly, that's the right to install and play the game/use the tools. I couldn't begin to tell you what Skyrim's EULA does or doesn't cover in this case - but if I had to guess, it's pretty restrictive in terms of explicit rights assigns to users. Presuming they've retained rights to content created with their tools, delivered by their system, and/or to control who can profit from use of their assets and tools, they're entitled (at least, unless a court says otherwise) to charge whatever they think they can get customers to pay.  ""Reasonable"" is hard to define  - market performance generally bears out whether costs are acceptable to users or not. In this case, the answer was clearly a resounding ""no.""   I tend to think that the current freely available modding system and the substantial ecosystem that's evolved around it creates much more value for their brand than a paid system would - and the lack of paid mods hasn't meaningfully disincentivized content creation. If there was a meaningful pain point it was addressing for stakeholders (modders or users or content distributors) that might have been one thing - but this looks like a case of fixing something that ""ain't broke."" Companies are rarely successful creating solutions in search of a problem."

They have the IP, they supply the tools and they are taking the hit if a mod reflects badly on their product, on which could be in the order of magnitudes more money than a modder will see in a life time.  I DO NOT support paid mods but i feel the cut was the least of the issues with the whole idea."

pcgaming,3djvyl,Crilde,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:21:41 2015 UTC,"It was $1M just dealing with customer outrage (answering emails and such). Valve still then had to refund every paid mod sale, which definitely cost them money in transaction fees.  Overall, a very costly venture."
pcgaming,3djvyl,5i1v3r,2,Fri Jul 17 10:12:34 2015 UTC,"This was in 2012 and we had many questions, but only one demand. It had to be open, not curated like the current models. At every step along the way with mods, we have had many opportunities to step in and control things, and decided not to. We wanted to let our players decide what is good, bad, right, and wrong. We will not pass judgment on what they do. We’re even careful about highlighting a modder on this blog for that very reason.   -Bethesda Blog  Bethesda reason for not curating it was noble and I agree with them that mods should not be curated for their content but there does need to be quality / stability curation. Also the mods at launch should have be chosen carefully to highly great mods that justified the price."

All one piece (in itself not too terrible but any quality mod has separate pieces), the in game picture model didn't fit on screen, no female version, weapons are at some bizarre angle so you have to rotate them before they can be seen in your inventory. No method of acquisition besides console commands.  I mean idk if I would have ever been 100% onboard, but if they had premiered with a collection of awesome ""idk if I would pay for it but holy crap I need this in my skyrim"" next-level mods, then I (and I imagine others) would have been far less upset. As it is all we got was some half assed armor sets, overpowered weapons, and repackaged versions of already free mods."
pcgaming,3djvyl,OH_ITS_MEGACRUNCH,3,Fri Jul 17 14:31:24 2015 UTC,Agreed if the content had been worth the money I doubt the complaining would have been as much. But when people were trying to sell single sets of shitty armor that weren't even properly implemented in the game what the fuck did they think would happen? When just the day before they launched this you could get mods which featured far more content and were of a higher quality for free. It'd be like if steak was free and all the sudden someone tries to enter the market selling burnt hamburgers.

I rather donate to the creator, becouse I wanted to donate money to them, not be forced too.   I don't believe mods should ever be something you pay for, libre and open-source software encourages more quality software, than paid proprietary software, same thing will happen to mods if they become closed-source.   The only group who will benefit from paid mods will be bethesda, gaining money for doing nothing. Valve, gaining money for doing nothing.

Console gamers don't mind paying money for content which PC gamers feel they are entitled to for free.  I am old enough to remember how angry people were over DLC Maps. PC gamers were pissed, but console gamers paid for maps no problems and made it extremely lucrative. Now even PC gamers don't have too much of an issue paying for DLC maps, etc.   DICE even made a promise that they will never charge for Battlefield maps 5 years ago... look how that ended up.  https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1tfub7/dice_well_never_charge_for_battlefield_maps/  If mods start coming to consoles, you can bet that they will paid mods and they will be very profitable. On one hand yeah that sucks, but on the other games are much more expensive to make these days, but the $60 price tag hasn't changed in a long time and PC gamers expect to pay less than $60 for AAA titles.   It will be interesting to see what happens in the future.  TL:DR: Mods on consoles = paid mod will be accepted by the gaming community just like DLC."

DLC maps are still made by the game studio so you know it will be good quality and work as expected. Mods on the other hand can be complete crap, and still be released, which is exactly what we saw when paid mods were attempted. Unless there is an element of quality control I think that they'll have a harder time catching on."

pcgaming,3djvyl,Jikolpl,7,Fri Jul 17 00:18:40 2015 UTC,"If Bethesda wants to have paid mods, they have to take the mod in house, pay royalties, sell it as DLC - maybe as packs, and support it so that updates don't break them and they don't have mod incompatibilities with other paid mods. Put a price on something and you expect support and you expect them to just work with the paid products. Somewhat similar to how Valve does with community maps in CSGO and TF2."
pcgaming,3djvyl,MythicalBacon,9,Fri Jul 17 02:42:21 2015 UTC,"Bethesda lost all respect from me with their silly ideas of how modders' work should bring them revenue. The modders and players will both need to pay Bethesda to begin with. Asking for more money for PLAYER MODS is outright greedy.   Mod creators DEFINITELY need an easy way to monetize their creations, and if Bethesda actually cared about their fans they would attempt to offer that platform for free, and it would STILL increase sales of their games!  Bethesda got too greedy. I can't wait for their next big game, The Elder Scrolls VI: Horse Armor Hell"
pcgaming,3djvyl,IAmSecretCow,13,Fri Jul 17 18:48:06 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: It is not just about the price & cut, sorry bad English btw. They seem to speak a lot about the price itself, or should I say, the cut, beetwen the 3 parties. What they don't realise is there's more to it, while some mods were absurdly expensive; like some random items for 0.99c to $5 etc ; the 45/30/25% being inequitable imo, they forget about a few things. First, the mods were and are in majority free, it's silly that just one compagny want to change that and incite the others to do the same thing, and we all know that EA, Ubisoft, WB and more would not miss this opportunity. Second, the 'thiefs'. Not even one day before people were selling 'stollen' mods. Thirdly, free & paid mods simultaneously would be a disaster, it'll just make some people want to do plagiarism for the money or releasing the plagiat free for those who don't want to pay or simply can't. And last, piracy. Piracy would discourage some modders more than not being paid I'm guessing. So finally, if they want to help modders (which is not the case, the money is), just ask Steam to add a way to donate, $60~ is already good for them and don't need a cut , add to it the future DLCs, not everybody want to pay more after that."
pcgaming,3djvyl,Mortro,16,Fri Jul 17 10:28:52 2015 UTC,"Fourthly, paid mods give modders a reason to not fix compatibility issues or even to cause compatibility issues with other mods.  Fifthly, there are plenty of examples of mods that serve the purpose of fixing bugs and other things that the developer did not address.  Gamers should not have to pay a third party to fix a broken product, especially when the people responsible for releasing the broken product are taking a cut from that sale."
pcgaming,3djvyl,JohnnyC4ge,3,Fri Jul 17 00:22:40 2015 UTC,"Could you explain why ? I don't really understand how it should give them a reason to not do that, as they already are this way on the majority. Compatibility issues between mods would stop people to buy the two incompatible mods instead of choosing the 'best', some person want a mod only if he can take another one to go with. Edit: I agree perfectly with you for the fifthly, and that could be even worse if they do like Ubisoft (I think) one time, when they had a 'patch' which was stolen from a modder."
pcgaming,3djvyl,Mortro,16,Fri Jul 17 07:26:31 2015 UTC,"I think the best way to explain what I'm saying is by an example:  Modder A has created 2 awesome mods, one that revamps that crappy console port UI to something acceptable for PC and a bag mod.  Let's call this Alex's UI and Alex's Bags.  Modder B has created 1 awesome mod, a bag mod.  Let's call this Bob's Bags.  Modder B's bag mod is objectively leaps and bounds better than Modder A's bag mod.  Since Modder A makes money off his mods, it's in his interest for people to use Alex's Bags mod instead of Bob's Bags mod.  Provided Alex's UI mod is popular enough, he can simply neglect to address compatibility issues with Bob's Bags mod in an attempt to get people to use (and pay for) Alex's Bags mod instead, since he makes money when people download Alex's Bags mod.  This can be compared to big business even.  If you install an Nvidia card into a rig that has an AMD gpu, you can't use that Nvidia card to run hybrid physx.  You used to be able to do this, then Nvidia released a driver that disabled this functionality.  This is a compatibility issue that exists because Nvidia and AMD are rivals and Nvidia stands to gain revenue by virtue of that incompatibility as well as potentially deny revenue to their rival.  If for some strange reason GPU's were provided to gamers for free across the board, Nvidia probably would be more open to the idea of making their software compatible with AMD's products."
pcgaming,3djvyl,JohnnyC4ge,8,Fri Jul 17 07:53:53 2015 UTC,"Ho, I see, I thought of 2 mods that would not make a rivality, but like you said if a modder can have or create an advantage, they will abuse it.

pcgaming,3djvyl,KotakuSucks2,3,Fri Jul 17 00:09:20 2015 UTC,"I think it makes perfect sense for them to take a cut of mods.  It's not the same as many of the sensationalized examples here like Microsoft charging for anything made on their OS.  An operating system (or piece of hardware, etc.) is designed to facilitate many uses, while a game is only designed to play the game.  Allowing the dev to make a cut of mods encourages them to create and offer mod tools, which benefit the community.    I think the problem lies in the percentages.  Despite my views outlined above, giving modders only 25% seems pretty low.  I think a lot of people would be more understanding if the modder got the lion's share, with smaller cuts going to the devs and Valve."

If you're going to mod a game you should do it for the community, love of the game, love of the hobby, or just to become a community figure. I appreciate the work modders do and all but it's something that should remain for the community, not for profit.

pcgaming,3djvyl,ParagonIHX,3,Thu Jul 16 23:08:16 2015 UTC,"They are so out of touch it's unreal.  Other games paid mods work because the base game is usually good enough that you never need mods.  Vanilla skyrim is a broken mess, buggy, boring, pretty bad textures, even worse animations and its generally a very average game at best. Mods sell skyrim. without mods i imagine they would have significantly less sales. heck i bought a second copy JUST to mod and i can't imagine i'm the only one.  If they could make a base game that was as high quality as some of the mods skyrim has, then i would happily let them introduce paid modding as i would still be able to enjoy the game without them.  When you rely on mods and 3rd party patches to fix their game, they have no fucking right to ask for us to pay bethesda for them.     I love bethesda, but please produce high quality games before you try milking us for more money"
pcgaming,3djvyl,CocoPopsOnFire,4,Fri Jul 17 02:39:10 2015 UTC,"""We made the game, we made the game you're making a thing for."" -- Bethesda quote from the fine article  Perhaps the RPG gaming community needs to make their own game and be done with Bethesda and their weak offerings of which they are overly proud: Without mods, Skyrim is a poor offering with little to no replay-ability but with mods, Skyrim is actually a pretty good game. This has been true of Bethesda's RPGs since forever.  TL;DR - Cut Bethesda out of the loop: RPG gamers can create their own game world."

Why are they taking the smallest cut when they are doing the most work? This could be a lot more fair being 33-33-33, with the last 1% going to charity or something.   Or perhaps 45 to the modders making the content that's going to be generating the money, 30 to Bethesda for creating the game and the modding tools most of those mods are going to be using, and 25 to Valve for simply having the backend services to make the transactions possible.  That could also be re-arranged so Valve takes the larger 30% cut and Bethesda only gets the 25%. I am not sure which took more time, money and effort to create: Skyrim and its editor or the backend that allowed Valve to sell the mods.  From a user's point of view, however, I am not even sure how you could ever do anything to make most of the normal users accept a paid mod system where, if the modder so chooses, the mod could only be acquired by paying for it. The only ""benefit"" they get is the satisfaction of knowing their contribution may allow for the modder to make even better mods.   This is not a guarantee, like the money the modders would be getting from the users buying their mods. The best way around it would be to do what many of the modders themselves were asking for in the first place: A donate button. Instead of forcing people to buy their mods, you give them the option of donating money instead. The split between developers and modders could still be there, too; but again, a split that is more fair to the content creators and not the middle-men."

That and I use 300+ mods, some are big some are very minor things but im not paying over 1 thousand dollars to play a game that would have been said and done with out them, combined with the fact even if they were 1 dollar each, what if we dont like them? what if they dont work with other things? the modding scene cant be locked down by DRM, conflicting, no communal systems.

My big issue was Valve getting a higher cut for doing nothing more than hosting the content.   If Bethesda wishes to charge for mods they have to vet them like they're DLC or it all falls apart. Something like Valves system for their own games would be great: you post stuff on the workshop, in hopes that its good enough to get into the ""official paid mods"" section (equivalent to Valves game updates that add workshop items). They can set prices for the bigger DLC like mods, and bundle some of the smaller ones together.  That way we're not having to see ""hurr durr its a red sword ripped from some other game for 99c"", and modders who are in it for the money will actually strive to create quality work.

Some mods were litterally compilations of other mods, made to be a ""consistant overall package"". Those can't really be monetizes unless the percentage is split between the makers.  A hard thing to do when all of the devs are all around the planet.  As i said before, theft was a big deal as well. Poeple stealing other poeple's work, selling it, an running with the money. By the time the original developer noticed it, it was too late. They could bring down the mod, but i would just be up again on another account a bit later. Little by little, gaining money for stuff they didn't create.  Then there's the percentage.  It's garbage. Valve and Betheda should NOT be getting a majority of the profits. NO way. That is not a way to promote poeple from making content for your game at all. 45-30-25?  Who the fuck came up with thiese numbers?  If anything it should be 80% for devs and 10-10 for Valve and Bethesda.  And finally, There's copy cats. It's not theft, but its damn close. And then you're left with the same problem that the IOS and google play store have on mobile phones: Everyone copying each other and being flooded with shit content.

pcgaming,3djvyl,ginx2666,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:38:00 2015 UTC,"Controversial opinion; be open minded.  Am i the only person here who actually thought that the paid mods thing was a great idea the way it was implemented? Just get a better game to feature it with, like the next TES with built in mod support and ""mod licenses"" so that mods can't be stolen. With other games with premium mods, the publisher would have to keep lowering their cut of the premium mod cash so that the modders don't flock to another game that gives them a better deal. In order to attract more modders, modding would be made easier through developers focusing more on mod support and modding tools.  The idea of mods depending on other mods is a relic of an old era (like the compatibility of different mods), with better mod support mods wouldn't need to rely on other mods to function.  The idea that Valve managed to ""destroy the modding community"" and ""turn it into a hate filled competitive field"" is dumb; all they did was introduce the concept of money, greed is the fault of asshole modders.  Just because some of the mods featured were sub par at best doesn't mean anything: if you don't like a mod you don't have to buy it. It's that simple. Vote with your wallet, if a mod doesn't sell the modder will try to put more effort into it. The ""100$ minimum sale to get paid"" thing was not greed by Valve, it was to make modders earn their money.  But of course the entitled assholes of the internet who can only think 5 minutes ahead immediately thought that it was ""shagging them up the ass on a thursday"" or however that one loser rudely replied to GabeN."

There was this game i used to play called Blockland where installing a mod was as easy as dragging and dropping a .zip file on a folder. It was a free modding community and i don't recall anyone borrowing models from other mods.  I also stated the license thing which should cover the copying problem. Some encrypted info is inserted into the modding files by the workshop with the original creators name in them. Theres also the community policing of content, so if a popular mod (a mod worth copying) is copied, it will be shut down by negative player feedback and reports of thievery."

There are Nexus mods with over a million downloads and not a single dollar earned.  If this was the clear answer to paying modders for their work, they would have done it already. Valve and Bethesda already have the market data though; nobody (especially not gamers) wants to give away money when they don't have to.

Imagine if mods were only a dollar. How many mods does your skyrim have? (I'm talking to anyone reading this not just OP.) I know mine would cost me nearly two hundred dollars.

Those who believe modders should be paid have good intentions and I fully agree, but a paywall is the absolute worst way of doing it.  If you are a modder, why would you not charge a dollar? Even purists like me will start to get demoralized seeing other modders charging money and jump on that bandwagon. I promise you if it became lucrative everyone will do it, then the gamers will have to choose between a fun experience for lots of money, or a nearly vanilla experience on a game you spent 60 dollars on.

In other words, social relationships are not easy to reestablish. Once the bloom is off the rose — once a social norm is trumped by a market norm — it will rarely return.

pcgaming,3dlbyw,Taodude,2,Tue Jul 21 17:20:57 2015 UTC,Dark Souls ruined many games for me.  Is this what happened to you too?
pcgaming,3dlbyw,Lord_Sheep,8,Sat Jul 18 02:16:36 2015 UTC,"Witcher 3, played 100 hours in less than a week and since then i haven't been able to get into any more games"
pcgaming,3dlbyw,Taodude,2,Sat Jul 18 10:33:39 2015 UTC,"Is it that good?  That's how I feel about Dark Souls, in that I can't get into very many games nowadays that take themselves seriously because they don't scratch that itch that Dark Souls was so masterfully able to fulfill."
pcgaming,3dlbyw,Lord_Sheep,4,Sat Jul 18 20:32:24 2015 UTC,"I think it's because i haven't bought any new AAA games that deliver that high quality experience, its mostly been dlc and the odd old/indie game. The Witcher 3 was such a fucking great emotional ride that i'm left comparing every game to it."
pcgaming,3dlbyw,Realityishardmode,2,Sat Jul 18 23:17:05 2015 UTC,"It was the only game that made me go and read the all of the source material after the fact.  I played the Witcher 1 and 2, so I was already a pretty huge fan, but the Witcher 3 really pulled me in and connected the world to me like no other RPG has been capable of.  If you are missing the witcher and cant get into any games right now, just read the books.  They are pretty light reading and in places a bit pulpy, but the books are a whole lot of fun, and made me want to replay it to see all of the things I missed in the whole witcher series."

I've played probably every AAA RPG that's come out in the last 10 years and have completely exhausted my favourites (Bethesda, Souls, Witcher, Bioware etc.) I've also played most of the recent CRPG revival games (Wasteland 2, Divinity, Pillars.) I'm not too huge a fan of ARPGs that copy the Diablo formula, but I have an open mind if there is a particularly good one. Should also mention I only own a PC. Any suggestions?"
pcgaming,3dlbyw,StarsAreRare,13,Fri Jul 17 05:30:33 2015 UTC,"Since you're open to ARPGs, I'd like to suggest Path of Exile. It's free to play, so it can't hurt to check it out. It has very unique mechanics like the currency system and the skill gem system."
pcgaming,3dlbyw,ShaunTighe,5,Fri Jul 17 08:26:18 2015 UTC,Is it really free? Seems too good to be true. Will I level slower than paying customers or something? If it's actually 100% free than I'll definitely give it a shot.
pcgaming,3dlbyw,Eden108,12,Fri Jul 17 10:16:24 2015 UTC,"They have the best f2p model I have ever seen, period. The only advantage you can buy (that I recall at least, 90% sure) is more storage tabs.

It's by far the biggest patch to come out.  Don't let the massive skill tree intimidate you, it's really just how you kill enemies without dying.  As far as P2W, it does not exist.  period.  all payments are for cosmetics.  Some really cool ones too.  There are also cosmetics that are obtainable only through play. --oh and bank storage tabs like eden pointed out."
pcgaming,3dlbyw,Slothu,2,Fri Jul 17 12:53:36 2015 UTC,"As other posters have mentioned, you can only buy stash tabs and fancy flashy cosmetics.  On stash tabs: If you're just casually trying the game out, you won't even see the need for stash tabs, because you start with ample storage"
pcgaming,3dlbyw,Bennyboy1337,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:53:28 2015 UTC,"Easily the best F2P game out there, in terms of how they manage it. The only thing you will find yourself possibly needing to spend money on in the future would be storage space, but they start you out with quite a bit to begin with, so it is by no means required."
pcgaming,3dlbyw,MrCobraFlame,6,Mon Jul 20 18:17:32 2015 UTC,I'm not a huge fan of RPGs but it sounds like you've covered most of them. Maybe an MMO with a RP guild would be an option. Sorry I can't really be of more help tho.

pcgaming,3dlbyw,MurderKube,5,Fri Jul 17 22:54:19 2015 UTC,"The Gothic games (1&2) are absolute top notch, it's what every open world type game should aspire to be when it comes to world design. Troikas games are also great, if some what ""diamond in the rough"". Temple of Elemental evil being a great dungeon crawler, and possibly the only game that actually gets D&D combat done right. Circle of eight will fix most issues with this game. Their other games Arcanum and VTM: Bloodlines, are also good but some what buggy.  This might give you some more ideas about whats worth looking into playing."
pcgaming,3dlbyw,ShaunTighe,2,Fri Jul 17 07:29:21 2015 UTC,"I've already played VtMB and loved it, I had no idea those guys also made Arcanum, I've head great things. Definitely give that a shot.

It's from the same guys that made Dishonored."
pcgaming,3dlbyw,Zeriell,2,Fri Jul 17 22:01:43 2015 UTC,"Can you stomach the DOS era stuff? If you can, you've got a nearly-infinite backlog of games that will blow you away.  I know a lot of people have trouble going back that far, though."
pcgaming,3dlbyw,ShaunTighe,2,Fri Jul 17 22:46:37 2015 UTC,"I haven't really gone back further than 1997 (Fallout) but I'm definitely willing to give it a shot, anything in particular you'd recommend?"
pcgaming,3dlbyw,Zeriell,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:52:44 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you are into. If you can stomach the graphics and handle DOS, Betrayal at Krondor is a pretty safe recommendation because it just does what is now mainstream RPGs really well:   Well-written story, it's based off a series of books and then the game script was written by another professional author Interesting and pretty unique character advancement/skills Every character is part of the plot, but can still die Big, mostly open world that is unlocked as you progress through the story, you are given broad goals but can take multiple routes and explore. It's got riddle locks! It's got some pretty great and unusual music if you can get your sound settings to render it properly, there's a warm medieval timbre to all the songs that evokes fantasy settings like this way more to me than the bombastic and often cold orchestral scores that seem to dominate the genre now.   I'd happily call it one of the best RPGs of all time, and if it wasn't for the big hang-up people have with early 3D stuff, I'd say its very accessible.   My other big recommend would be Darklands, but it's a harder sell. What it does well it does really well, but it's also kind of niche.   Setting is one-of-a-kind: historically accurate (mostly) medieval Germany. There are supernatural parts, but only as the people of the time would have believed. i.e, there is witchcraft, the Knights Templar are demon worshippers, but you won't find any orcs. It's sandbox in the truest sense of the word. Unlike Skyrim, this doesn't mean picking up everything in sight, it means at any given time you have a ton of actions and paths open to you, and it's up to you to figure out what to do. Work menial jobs in towns for food, board, and some coin. Go out in the streets at night, evade guard patrols, rob various locales. Take up bounties from the local dignitaries to hunt down Robber Barons. Pretty much everything is procedural, and it's rough figuring out how you're supposed to ""win"", you'll probably dedicate your first (failed) playthrough to finding out how to just get your footing.  If you just like exploring worlds and getting lost in them, it's astounding and will swallow up your time. If you want a guided experience, you should stay away from this one. The CYOA segments that are used to immerse you in the game were a direct inspiration for Pillars of Eternity.   One thing to keep in mind about DOS era RPGs is that they all operate under the assumption that you will have to spend some time failing at the game to start succeeding. I think this is one of the hardest adjustments people have once they get past the graphical differences, modern games are all about completionism and guaranteeing the player will finish, older games are all about exploring and the experience of playing, there was never the sense at the time that you were owed the ability to complete the game just because you bought it."

pcgaming,3dlbyw,KotakuSucks2,3,Fri Jul 17 14:55:38 2015 UTC,"KOTOR is pretty good, nothing spectacular but a decently polished RPG, combat is very similar to Dragon Age Origins if you ever played that.  I like KOTOR2 more but its very grim.  KOTOR1 is very much in line with typical star wars media but KOTOR2 is all about the aftermath and trauma of the terrible war that took place off screen as the setup to KOTOR1.  Almost every character has some backstory about something absolutely horrible that happened to them in the war.  It's a lot more muddled in terms of morality than Star Wars usually is which is a good and bad thing, it makes it more interesting but at the same time grey morality just doesn't work well in a universe that usually has such an absolute dichotomy between the good guys and the bad guys.  If nothing else it has one of the funniest moments I've ever seen in a video game. Apathy is death  If you're interested in KOTOR2 once you finish 1, make sure you download the fan restored content patch, it fills in a lot of the holes the ending had in the original release."

pcgaming,3dlbyw,doneddat,6,Fri Jul 17 06:55:10 2015 UTC,"Elite Dangerous is really cute for exploration. You get paid for discovering and scanning starsystems and with starter equipment it's not trivial to figure out the trajectories of binary stars in system to pick out which of the dots near you is the secondary star.. and when you get close enough, they look pretty enough to feel compensated for the effort.

It's a hell of a game, I've sunken at least 600 hours into it, by far the past I've ever done, but I'm kinda done until the devs unscrew the PVP aspect and stop treating cheaters with a marshmallow fist (2 week shadow bans).

I have easily 2000 hours combined in all the BL games and it gets really grindy if you want a challenge (BL2 legendary weapons/items make a huge difference in later game modes.)  Really fun with friends for a couple playthroughs with diff classes but solo its a little draining. I love these games but they have their flaws just like many other games.

I recently beat the Witcher 3 and it was a fantastic game but I didn't quite get lost in it. I don't know I feel like there was something stopping me from being 100% immersed (I think it came down to the movement and combat). Since then I've played a multitude of games (including a 23 hours Civ V battle that ended in my loss to that stupid motherf***er Alexander) and want another RPG to play.   Things I'm looking for:  has to have a great story, the kind that hits you in the right places. I want to be thinking about it when I'm not playing it :-P combat isn't the biggest deal to me, must have a decent amount of side quests, must have extra characters that you can either get to know  really well or start a proper relationship with.   I've played games like this that include: Mass Effect series, Dragon Age series, Divinity:Original Sin (I felt the story was super boring, its cool you can do whatever you want but at least at the time I was more into an epic story than anything else), Kingdoms of Alumuar: Reckoning, Fallout series, Elder Scrolls series, Kotor series (honestly thinking of playing some swtor with the 12x XP boost).  Considering Pillars of Eternity. I tried Baulders gate but its a bit too old for me at this point (as well as games from the pre Kotor era like vampire masquerade and deus ex)."
pcgaming,3dlbyw,mihahahai,2,Mon Jul 20 00:32:48 2015 UTC,"Pillars of Eternity is pretty good.  I haven't finished it yet, loading screens are ridiculous even on my new machine.  I really enjoyed the Gothic series (especially Gothic 1), but those may be too old. In that case, try Risen. It's the same studio and devs (not 100% sure on the devs). I may just have a childhood nostalgia for it, but I replayed it a few years ago and it was still amazing if you can get over the controls and graphics.  Drakan, Order of the Flame is another masterpiece from the past. You are a medieval Lara Croft riding dragons (DIFFERENT ONES) which have magic powers you can use, dragon battles, open world and dungeons. The story is spectacular.  Silver is a great little game with an amazing story and simple graphics. It has a good dose of comedy and the combat system I believe is unique to this day. Because of the camera it uses, graphics are really not a problem even if played nowadays.   If you approach these with an open mind and patience I guarantee you will have a great time. Maybe search for mods to improve the graphics and whatnot.  I recommend you start with Silver, since it's the easiest to get into and most eye candy.  As for modern titles (if I must...):  Unepic - i guess it's one of those metroidvania things, idk I'm not good with genres and labels. It's funny, light and entertaining. Has just enough depth.  Divinity: Original Sin - This is a must-play. Great story, turn based combat, really clever elemental combat with environment use, lots of freedom and interesting puzzles. Good comedy as well.  Darkest Dungeon - maybe not exactly an RPG, but worth a shot.  If you like ARPGs try Grim Dawn and the original Titan Quest + expansion. Really nice class/skill system. Story aint bad either.  One last oldie - Beneath a Steel Sky, another childhood gem. More adventure than RPG, but you may like it.  Would love to know if you enjoyed any of these, get back at me.  Have fun!"

Her favorite games are fighters/shooters like Destiny and Mortal Kombat. She doesn't appreciate story-driven games or anything that won't 100% keep her attention.  She needs a pick up and play game with limited down time.  I am primarily a RPG and MOBA player, so I was wondering if someone could recommend some games for me to play with her that will convince her to convert to PC gaming. I want something that I can potentially play as well, maybe at LAN events or just online.  I know about Quake and TF2 as well as all the Blizzard games, but I was hoping someone could recommend some other things?  She has steam and I might be able to get her to try some unique Indie games as long as they aren't complicated.  She has no interest in doing game research on things that require a lot of practice/game knowledge (etc League or WoW).  Thanks!"

It was my first time with that game and I definitely loved it, but now I need something new to play. I'm not necessarily looking for a clone or even a 2D sidescroller, but I really liked the artstyle.   What I really like from a game is a sandbox game with plenty of customization. Terraria had a big amount of armor types and vanity items which made the experience unique (as well as weapons). In addition, I'd like a game meant for CO-OP (2-4 players). I'm not a big fan of ARPGs, I've played Diablo, Torchlight, and PoE and I don't think I'll be going back.   I've seen Starbound, Edge of Space, and Signs of Life, but I don't know which of those three to get if any. Any ideas of what game I should give a shot?"
pcgaming,3dlbyw,Energizer100,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:09:22 2015 UTC,What is the best strategy games for someone who has no experience in them. Endless Legend? Anno? Civ?
pcgaming,3dlbyw,Bennyboy1337,2,Mon Jul 20 13:11:07 2015 UTC,"Well Endless Games are turn based like Civ Games, but have more focus on combat, hero leveling, and unit upgrades. I just started playing Endless Legend recently and it is quite fun. Anno on the other hand it a RTS, which is actually very simple in comparison to the other games you listed, might fit your bill, but I honestly got bored of it fairly quick. If you want a great RTS there is honestly nothing better than Company of Heroes; you can pickup a pack of the game for pretty cheap, and the campaign and single player is really really fun. Otherwise possibly look into Age of Wonders III, it is similar to Endless Legends in many ways, but the combat gives you way more control, and is subsequently more rewarding.  Civs, Age of Wonders, Endless Legends are all very similar games, that simply have more detail in certain respects: Civs is more about expansion and technology, Endless is more about upgrading units and using heroes correctly, Age of Wonders is more RPG about finding unique weapon drops for your heroes and using them correctly in combat and using world spells to your benefit.  Edit: I would like to add that one cool thing about Endless that his has over Age and Civs, is the ability to make customized races which really adds replay value to the game. Nations in Civs are honestly pretty similar across the board, they have a different wonder/unit, or racial buff, but in Endless you can have races with radically different play styles. A good example is the Cultists which is as it sounds a religious group in Endless, they can not have more than one capitol city, but they can convert local tribes to the religion, which will pop out a military unit every so often, so the race is basically build a huge thriving capitol, then push out powerful convert armies to raze other race cities to the ground. Another race does not consume food, but only dust which is basically like gold, but their units can't heal, you have to spend dust to heal them after a battle; you can see some of the differences in factions are really fun to play with, and you can make your own to match how you like playing."

pcgaming,3dn9kp,Tovora,-11,Sat Jul 18 10:23:44 2015 UTC,"That is largely debatable. The only part about the definition of sport that is arguable is that a sport is a competitive game requiring physical exertion and skill.  I tend to say this is a sport for two reasons:   The reaction times in pro gamers is amazing, this takes years of practice. And the quickness in key strokes and mouse clicks for that prolonged period of time is unmatched by anyone outside of the game/sport. This is physical prowess. Mental exertion is a form of physical exertion. And employing strategy and quick thinking is a very difficult thing to do at a high level. I know I feel tired after a competitive game online.   To help paint a picture. I am an athletic dude. I can play two highly competitive games of tennis back to back. Playing two games of highly competitive dota is harder for me, I need a break. The reason being, I am mentally exhausted and I feel tired and exerted. By definition, I had just finished playing a sport."
pcgaming,3dn9kp,lebastss,11,Fri Jul 17 19:27:44 2015 UTC,"By your definition, you could call gamers athletes (n. a person who is proficient in sports,)  which no logical person would. If we continue along that line of reasoning we can deduce that gaming is not a sport."
pcgaming,3dn9kp,HMPoweredMan,-4,Fri Jul 17 19:36:54 2015 UTC,I am a logical person and I would call gamers athletes. Being athletic is about ability and skill as well as physical fitness. There have been many professional athletes that aren't in great physical shape.  The origin of the word athlete is actually just to compete for a prize. We have morphed this into are current mental image of an athlete because of the popularity of physical sports over the last century.
pcgaming,3dn9kp,lebastss,5,Fri Jul 17 20:00:01 2015 UTC,"The origin of the word isn't really relevant since what matters is the current interpretation.  Using the origin of the word we can say two candidates that are extremely out of shape that go to a job interview are athletes, this wont' make sense to anyone in the 21st century.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change"
pcgaming,3dn9kp,JohnnyC4ge,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:42:45 2015 UTC,"Now you've backed yourself into a corner, by admitting that we dot give a shit about the original definition but instead the new one is what matters, you aknowledge that the meanings of words change over time, so now you are fighting against the new use? Guess what we don't give a shit about your old definition and will continue to use our new one.  Semantic drift is exactly right, the meaning of athlete has drifted yet again, get with the times grandpa."
pcgaming,3dn9kp,dudemanguy301,2,Sat Jul 18 03:10:21 2015 UTC,"First things first, if people want to call gamers athletes, so be it I could care less.  I personally won't, because there's already a word that is well defined that I can use which won't draw any confusion, the word ""gamer"".  Outside of conversations that debate whether e-sports are actually sports, I've never once seen the word athlete used to describe a gamer.  If you look at these debates, those that participate can't even agree on whether gamers are athletes.  Thus if anything it's similar to slang and hasn't yet seen semantic change, but perhaps is in the process of semantic change.  Although I would say that's unlikely since as I said people aren't calling gamers athletes, they are just trying to fit gamers into the definition of what an athlete is to justify calling e-sports a sport.  Professional e-sports competitors are basically always called ""pros"" or ""pro-gamers"".  This could change over time of course, however currently I think that if you walked up to a random person on the street and asked them if pro-gamers are athletic they would probably say no."
pcgaming,3dn9kp,JohnnyC4ge,-2,Sat Jul 18 04:12:13 2015 UTC,"I mean thats a weak analogy though and you know it. They aren't in direct competition against each other by exhibiting any skill.  They are just choosing candidates based on information. If you had two candidates code out a program, whoever finishes first gets the job. That would be a sport, also assuming you had regular competition and leagues set up. Which also wouldn't happen."
pcgaming,3dn9kp,lebastss,3,Fri Jul 17 21:02:27 2015 UTC,It's not meant to be an analogy.  It's a response to this:   The origin of the word athlete is actually just to compete for a prize.   Either way you could easily say the competition happened before the interview and that the interview is a judge measuring their skill based on their past achievements.  It's also not unheard of for job candidates to be asked to exhibit a skill during an interview or shortly thereafter.  This happens very regularly for people that speak multiple languages and are marketing that skill on a resume.
pcgaming,3dn9kp,JohnnyC4ge,0,Fri Jul 17 21:08:30 2015 UTC,"True, I think the difference being it isn't an open competition between them. And whoever does the best in said competition doesn't necessarily win or get the job. I get what your saying though. eSports are definitely a grey area and this is definitely my opinion.  Its just hard for me to say it isn't a sport when you have things like shooting or curling considered olympic sports and competitions are aired on ESPN, well ESPN 2. Also fishing, thats a recognized sport as well.

pcgaming,3dlqbm,Auzymundius,5,Sun Jul 19 21:52:31 2015 UTC,"I would keep the side panel on to direct the airflow to the back regardless if there isn't much room.  If you can, keep your PC off the ground especially if you have carpet to reduce dust build up. edit* can't really see the logic behind this one so ignore it for now.  You want more intake fans than outtake to bring more cool air than the hot air you're venting out.  If you're getting a radiator best to put it as high as possible at the back as heat rises upwards you don't want it going through your case as that would kind of defeat the purpose.  Rear fans should be at the top of your case while front fans should be at the bottom.  Good cable management too. Try and have them hidden behind your mobo or at least not obstructing where the air is flowing."
pcgaming,3dlqbm,JazMac34,2,Fri Jul 17 10:23:52 2015 UTC,I agree with all this except the floor part. I've four inside dogs and have my case on the floor. I clean the dust filters once a month.

pcgaming,3dlqbm,Robborboy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:35:58 2015 UTC,"That might be the case (ha! puns...) quite a hassle to properly test to see if results are better or not, but ye thinking about it now I can't really think of a valid reason as to why lifting it off the floor would make a difference."
pcgaming,3dlqbm,JazMac34,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:27:05 2015 UTC,"Some cheap cases only have 0.5-1 inch clearance when resting on the floor, which is reduced even further by carpet.

pcgaming,3dlqbm,RHINO_Mk_II,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:34:49 2015 UTC,So the answer here would be...avoid a PSU with a fan you can only face downwards? thereby negating the need to have your PC raised.
pcgaming,3dlqbm,JazMac34,2,Fri Jul 17 19:12:21 2015 UTC,"Most PSUs can be mounted either way. In my build, I was planning to mount the intake downward to get cooler air since my case has 1.5 inches on the bottom and my carpet is short, but due to cable length I had to turn it over instead to get my CPU power to reach the motherboard socket. It's generally recommended to mount the PSU intake downward if possible because it will draw in cool air from the room instead of hotter air coming from the GPU, but again this is only if you have enough clearance for proper airflow. This is the reason why some people recommend keeping a PC off the floor."
pcgaming,3dlqbm,RHINO_Mk_II,2,Fri Jul 17 19:35:31 2015 UTC,Get more fans.Plan how you want to exhaust heat outside your case.

pcgaming,3dlqbm,RHINO_Mk_II,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:18:45 2015 UTC,"Try getting 38mm deep fans instead of the typical 25mm deep fans.  They move a significantly larger volume of air.  If there's any electronics recycling shops near you, you can typically find them inside of server computers or old Dell/HP workstation PC's."
pcgaming,3dlqbm,Shensmobile,2,Fri Jul 17 23:02:47 2015 UTC,"Without knowing what kind of case you have its a little strange that you would ask if you need more fans. Maybe the one fan is good enough, especially if you're using something like a GTX 750Ti and an Intel i3 chip, your temps wont go very high. If you've got more expensive hardware, and the case supports it, more fans is generally necessary.  If the only fan is an 80mm fan then you probably need more. We need details to help you!"

pcgaming,3dlqbm,drogean3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:30:15 2015 UTC,"Make sure you clean it every once in a while to prevent dust build up on:  Fans  Radiators  Fan filters  Heatsinks  Prevent it from being directly on thick, raised carpeting. If anything keep it on a solid surface where things do just easily get sucked into the fan.   Really it's all a matter of common sense. Use airflow fans for general case placements and static pressure for things like radiators to maximize airflow efficiency."

pcgaming,3dlqbm,Captcha_Imagination,0,Sat Jul 18 17:22:56 2015 UTC,"It looks like I'm a day late, but I want to put my opinion in here.   Keep the side panel on. It will create a small vacuum effect, and really direct the airflow where it needs to go. Air flow really works best if you have it going in one direction and following basic physics principles. Which is to say, cool air in from the front/bottom and exhausting through the back/top. Intakes should be filtered while exhausts need not be. Filtering air that goes into your case means keep as much dust out as possible, and leaving exhausts unfiltered means blowing out much of the dust that does get in. Create a positive airflow. Positive airflow has been shown to be best for cooling. To create positive airflow make sure your intakes are more powerful than your exhausts. Sometimes this means putting some static pressure fans for intakes, and sometimes it means leaving out one or more exhaust fans. Do research on fan air flow. Don't trust the CFM or any of the numbers that come directly from the manufacturers. Look for fans you like, and then look for reviews on reputed sites and possibly YouTube as well. Try to orient components to not restrict airflow. This is also quite important. Make sure to not leave a bunch of cables in the middle of the case, try to have as little drive cages as possible while leaving drives secure, etc. A fan may have great airflow, but if the fan airflow is restricted by a lot of objects in the middle of the case that could otherwise be neatly tucked away, then it's just a free airflow option you are not taking advantage."

pcgaming,3dlqbm,Spliffy9,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:54:55 2015 UTC,Only 1 fan? Is that because you case is limited to only 1 fan or you only bought one fan for it? Honestly 1 fan is not enough for a gaming PC. I have 4 Fans a Radiator and a PSU that vents outside to outside and my case temps will still reach 40+C after a few hours of gaming. Honestly exhaust fans on the top of the case are a near requirement for modern cases.
pcgaming,3dlqbm,kawifcknsaki,-2,Fri Jul 17 12:26:27 2015 UTC,"Careful there...   My case had ""zero case fans"" for a long time... I had a 660 ti with a blower cooler (so hot air goes out), I set my h90 aio  to pull, so it would exaust hot air and my power supply was put with the fans facing out, so it draws fresh air from the floor and blows out hot air.  Had a very stable gaming PC...  You can even make a gaming PC with zero fans at all... So don't say that it has a minimum of 4 fans... My bitfenix phenon M case has a MAXIMUM of four fans... And I could put here dual 980 ti and any CPU you want with only one case fan.  Edit: now I did re read your statement and you didn't say anything about MAXIMUM or minimum... Sorry...

pcgaming,3djhon,LRed,5,Fri Jul 17 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"Just got the new build myself, I'll test the draw calls on my 290X. It's possible that AMD didn't have a hold of this build when they pushed 15.7, in the past major new builds came with new sample drivers, so maybe it's changed enough to warrant new drivers.   EDIT: Tested it, my results are a lot more varied than yours. 10166 is on the left, 10240 right. I get better performance on the newer build in DX11 ST and (much more) mantle, but a little worse in DX MT and DX12. For draw calls per frame its either the same or much better on the newer build.   On a side note, why does my CPU utilization never pass 50% on any core in DX11, but Mantle and DX12 both are at 100? I'd expect the opposite.  290X @ 1060/1350 and i5 2500k @ 4.8GHz."
pcgaming,3djhon,pb7280,7,Thu Jul 16 23:00:29 2015 UTC,"About the side note : Simply put DX 12 doesn't do magic. It merely allows for higher draw calls to be handled by the cpu ie it allows for the cpu to be used to it's fullest extent thus 100% in a test of draw calls.  *This depends on both your graphics card and cpu so lower end graphics cards could reach 100% utilization before you have 75%+ on your CPU or lower end cpus could do the reverse.   This is why it can give much better performance in a lot of different cases. It has little to nothing to do with gpu performance. Sure you are liable to get some performance from a closer to the core API but it won't be major and that's not why DX12 is amazing.  Does anyone else remember the performance disaster that was Assassin's Creed Unity? That was (in part) caused by the insane amount of draw calls, that the huge crowds could pull. Other things it can help with besides number of actors(units for RTS's) is particle effects and draw distance. Remember Dying Light draw distance that was patched to just have lower DD? Arma 3?   * Though there's more there too with scripting and poor programming overall  DX12 will allow for some cool stuff that couldn't really be seen well on pc because DX11 and OpenGL were just incompetent at those levels of draw calls. Consoles on the other hand always had custom API's so they on the other hand had more problems with lower end hardware."
pcgaming,3djhon,finalgear14,4,Fri Jul 17 00:23:00 2015 UTC,Oh I thought it just enabled lower CPU utilization through lower API. Nice to see a fuller explanation!

At the time, it was worth nothing, and the publisher didn't even have the right to distribute it.  Any money given to the publisher by people who pirated it should be thought of as nothing more than a donation.    Let's create a new scenario to compare this to:  Let's say I have a magical apple tree that automatically grows a new apple when one is taken from it, and the apples never rot. I also somehow hold a monopoly on the apple market.  One day I decide to refuse to continue selling apples to you or anyone else.  Now you love apples, and can't stand the idea of not having apples just because they are no longer available for sale despite being in infinite supply.  You decide to go and steal a couple of apples from my tree. I have no way of ever finding out that you did this.  A year later, I decide to start selling apples again. I decide to charge $10 an apple from now on.  Are you responsible to now pay me $10 per apple stolen?  Most people would say ""no"". I have suffered no loss at your hands and you only obtained my apples for free because they were not available for sale.    Differences between this example and this real life scenario are as follows:   Deadpool was not available for sale because of legal reasons, not just because the publisher said so.

It would be a lot simpler to just download  retroarch and add that to steam.  Previous versions were not very user friendly but the latest release totally revamped the UI making it a lot easier to setup and use.  Imo it's the best way to play some retro games in Big Picture mode.
pcgaming,3dioeh,dafzor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:03:00 2015 UTC,"It's a lot of work but I like to keep all of my games in the same place. If you don't mind opening a second app to view your emulated games, EmulationStation has also been suggested."
pcgaming,3dioeh,dafzor,0,Thu Jul 16 23:05:59 2015 UTC,"Ice and EmulationStation are just ""frontends"" they display everything together but don't actually run the games passing it on to the actual emulator.  RetroArch has the advantage of being the full package, emulators (cores) are ""plugins"" you can download within retroarch and all options available from the same UI, meaning you get a consistent interface experience on all your emulated systems."
pcgaming,3dioeh,SuperBlooper057,5,Thu Jul 16 23:39:11 2015 UTC,"Ice isn't a frontend, it simply creates shortcuts in the Steam interface that directly launch the emulator."

They could make nice with PC, even if just for older games.  Release a ""Nintendo Shop"" platform on PC, or team up with GOG. (Yeah, yeah... or Steam.) Sell old NES, SNES, N64 games.   Basically, just create an official emulator and sell the official ROMS through an authorized service. (Similar to the way old PC games run through DOSBox), but give them some official love to reduce the hiccups often encountered in playing ROMs.  But, I'm really counting the days until Nintendo goes the way of  Sega and just switches over to make games. They make some really good games, I just don't want to buy their hardware anymore. Of course, maybe it will never happen. It just seems too lucrative to be in the software side of things. (Sacrificing the control you have when you make the hardware.)   That's why PC fits better. Because PC would allow them to do what they want as far as hardware goes. It can be completely open for them to do whatever they want. If they ever sign a deal with Ms/Sony, they'd pretty much be playing by their rules."

pcgaming,3dioeh,SuperBlooper057,2,Thu Jul 16 18:10:57 2015 UTC,Ice is unfortunately terrible.

When you kill them, you gain their powers. You can then build fire-based (or whatever the element) towers and then merge them with other elements...etc. etc. You can keep it pure to max the dmg against a particular weakness or get some really cool hybrid towers with special abilites.  Another slight twist is that when they reach the end of the path, they spawn back the beginning. This is good in that you can still gain the gold but you lose the HP and also the next waves are on a timer so it's possible they can compound if you aren't keeping up."

pcgaming,3dnnnr,Totenglocke42,-1,Sat Jul 18 14:34:12 2015 UTC,"Paid mods could be implemented in a positive way. Their initial try was completely wrong, but it can be done better and it will be more acceptable. I personally don't mind paying a couple dollars for a mod that is worthwhile and supported to the point where incompatibilities are not an issue.   I don't see the perfect system being created any time soon though and because of that I imagine if paid mods are a thing, they are going to be paid on console only because that is the market that Bethesda is going to be monitoring and controlling very closely. If they try paid mods for Fallout 4 with a system similar to their last, it would be an absolute mess on PC.  Edit: Should've expected outrage by saying my opinion regarding paid mods. I don't have any interest in debating countless people on the topic because it isn't a topic I really care for much. There will always be people out there creating free mods, even if we get to a future filled with paid mod systems. For the people who refuse to pay for additional content for their games in the form of paid mods, there will be cracked and pirate-able versions of them as well. Welcome to the internet."

A patch is a compilation of bug fixes so I really don't see a download of bug fixes having to be paid for. It doesn't add content. I don't think a mod should be paid unless it adds content personally. Not sure where that puts graphics mods though. I'd be alright with ENBs being paid.  To be clear, I'd prefer mods to stay free the way they've always been. I'm a realist though and I don't think that is the future."
pcgaming,3dnnnr,themikesem,5,Fri Jul 17 19:44:37 2015 UTC,"Why would Bethesda ever release patches / big fixes again if they cram paid mods up our ass?  They'd let modders fix their bugs, then charge us for it and Bethesda makes pure profit without having to lift a finger."

pcgaming,3dnnnr,fijifam,0,Fri Jul 17 20:49:40 2015 UTC,"Not necessary a bad thing, as long as there are quality assurance in place. e.g. mods need to be at a certain point of maturity to be able to charge money.  My worry is more about continuing support of a paid mod.  Let's say I paid for a mod which has a fantastic start, then the author decides it's better to merge with his other mods and to charge more money (for the other mods that I don't want).  In another scenario, the author decides to charge more money for a mod that I already bought or I'll be left with a completely broken mod, because of certain changes out of his control (e.g. FO4 patches)."

pcgaming,3dnnnr,Garviel_Loken95,2,Fri Jul 17 20:30:25 2015 UTC,I'm serious. I think the outcry over Skyrim was a (totally foreseeable) knee-jerk reaction from gamers that didn't know what to make of it. Give the professional mod market a year to settle and we'll see mods become an exciting new content delivery system.
pcgaming,3dnnnr,fijifam,5,Fri Jul 17 20:33:42 2015 UTC,"So you think a dlc becoming $15 is ok? Or a season pass bring $50 is ok? No. If this was strictly about the mod creator being funded for their effort, these huge companies wouldn't be trying to take 70% of the profits.

pcgaming,3dnnnr,Garviel_Loken95,-2,Fri Jul 17 21:02:05 2015 UTC,"So you think a dlc becoming $15 is ok?   Absolutely   Or a season pass bring $50 is ok? No.   100% okay, yes. Why wouldn't it be?   No. If this was strictly about the mod creator being funded for their effort, these huge companies wouldn't be trying to take 70% of the profits.   Why would it be ""strictly"" about the mod creators? The company making the game deserve a cut, and it's up to the mod creators to decide if that cut is worth it to make the mod and charge for it. They can always just release it for free like before.   If they really want the modder to receive funds, slap a donate button where you can donate whatever you want.   Yeah, all goods and services should be donation based, amirite?   E: free mods has been a cool delivery system for over a decade system now. Do you live under a rock?   And it still would be."
pcgaming,3dnnnr,fijifam,-2,Fri Jul 17 23:27:06 2015 UTC,Donate buttons are good for small time and enthusiast modders but ultimately set a soft cap on how much proceeds can be funneled to a modder. If you allow a direct market and nurture it through the turmoil this cap disappears and opens the door for high level talent to mod as a career. I would say 99% of mods are gimmicks or shit these days. We can change this if we open up to the idea of paying for the dev talent.  We're watching street performers when we could be hiring big acts. Entertain the idea and you may be surprised.
pcgaming,3dnnnr,Garviel_Loken95,5,Fri Jul 17 22:24:13 2015 UTC,"Ah, so you just lack critical thinking skills and don't realize how paid mods will never be good for the actual consumers."

""I think that we feel like there is a case to be made that people who spend a lot of time working on mods ought to be able to have a way of monetizing what they're doing.""   I agree the mod developers should be rewarded for their contributions to the community but I don't think that putting them behind a paywall is a good solution. I don't really have any ideas on how to implement it. All I could really see working is having what we have now but implement a system where it's somehow heavily encouraged to donate even the smallest amount to the creators.  I know for a fact that if I liked a free mod on Steam I would donate extra wallet money if I could. I think allowing people to donate with their Steam wallet funds would definitely make it more convenient. Sell a dozen shit skins from CS:GO and help out your favorite creator in the process.  Edit: The thing is with mods these days is a lot of people are still playing the same game because they just can't afford to buy new ones or are just too young to really have any steady spending money. Free mods is what keeps these people that only buy 1 or 2 games a year playing the games they do. I know people that religiously play Garry's Mod, TF2 and Minecraft because of the extensive modding community and virtually infinite replayability. Putting that stuff behind a paywall would not necessarily impact the game's sales (Unless it got spam refunded) but it would hurt the people that can only afford 1 game and that thrive off of the replayability that the community provides for months or even a year or so at a time. I could see it driving these kinds of people away."

pcgaming,3df9dw,Brandon23z,9,Wed Jul 15 22:59:16 2015 UTC,"It is true that very powerful hardware can run Batman: Arkham Knight at a stable 60FPS by setting the frame rate cap to 0.00000 in a config file and turning on V-SYNC. What you and the parent comment omit is that the game is BROKEN if you unlock the frame rate and you CANNOT COMPLETE THE CAMPAIGN.  I am of the belief that WB Games categorically knew about this well before they announced on 23 June that the frame rate should remain capped at 30FPS and changing any .ini setting will ""potentally negatively impact performance, including frame rate, and stability.""  Regardless, here is an indisputable fact: No matter how well Batman: Arkham Knight runs at 60FPS (even if you are in sections of the game where you are not dropping a single frame) THE PHYSICS ARE SLIGHTLY OFF. This makes certain Riddler trophies impossible to obtain. Since the game's full ending is locked away until you obtain all the Riddler trophies even the game's narrative cannot be concluded at 60FPS. A work around is to restart the game with the 30FPS config cap reinstated.  I also fell though the world twice when I had the frame rate unlocked. One was slightly inconvenient (restart the game) and the other greatly inconvenient (the game autosaved at the point I fell though the world). These fall-through-the-world bugs may be a consequence of the physics being slightly off when the 30FPS cap is removed.  Thus in no meaningful sense can Batman: Arkham Knight be said to support any frame rate except 30FPS."

This makes certain Riddler trophies impossible to obtain.   Sorry to be that guy, but can you cite a reliable source for this (one that isn't just WB's ass-covering statement)? People keep saying it but nobody has offered actual, indisputable proof. I'm fully prepared to accept it, but I've been playing Arkham Knight with the framerate cap lifted to 60 and haven't run into any overtly wrong physics in over 24 hours of playing, and I've been nabbing Riddler trophies all over the damn place. Maybe I'm just lucky, but I'd like to know for sure."
pcgaming,3df9dw,captainxtreme,5,Wed Jul 15 23:40:44 2015 UTC,"This happened to me and it is reproducible. If you're actually running the game ""locked"" at 60FPS then it will happen. But remember with double-buffering and v-sync if you can't quite sustain 60 frames per second then the frame rate inconsistently drops to 30 and you may glitch the physics to work.  This is also why one suggestion is to press F12 repeatedly. By overloading the computer with screenshots you may be able to glitch the physics to run at 30 instead of 60.  Just like you I thought I was going to be one of the lucky ones not affected by the glitches. This may be my gaming persona but I am a reliable cite. Also check out these Steam queries."
pcgaming,3df9dw,found-a-universe,3,Thu Jul 16 02:34:44 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that physics weren't actually tied to the framerate, looks like I was wrong. I guess it wasn't worth it to try running the game over 30 fps.  First thing I tried was the Riddler trophy outside the orphanage and sure enough it was bugged. Switched the framerate cap to default and it worked as intended. That really is a shame. Thanks for setting me straight, anyway."
pcgaming,3df9dw,captainxtreme,2,Thu Jul 16 03:08:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. Now you've outed yourself as a decent person with a kick-ass PC!  I believe 60FPS is crucial to the fast-paced free-flow combat that the first two games perfected. When Arkham City is running smoothly it can feel like being one with the game; performing at a very high skill level while time seems to dilate. In comparison Arkham Knight at 30FPS feels like the game has stopped flowing and I keep missing button presses.  I noticed this marked difference with The Last of Us. The Last of Us on PS3 is a superb game with fantastic graphics. But on the PS4 at 60FPS with consistent frame times the experience is just sublime. To me the original and remastered versions feel like completely different games. I'm at one with the game instead of a disconnected spectator.  Rocksteady know this and know that 30FPS is a suboptimal gaming experience. Naughty Dog know this and know that 30FPS is a suboptimal gaming experience.  My biggest gaming disappointment of 2016 is already accounted for because this minute I've just learned that Uncharted 4 single player will run at 30FPS.  Let's compare to the Naughty Dog of last year:   We hope 60FPS will become the new standard in games. ""I think we're showing that it does make a difference even in a non-FPS type game."" ""Pretty much every person who had said, 'I'm a 30 Hz person, I don't know if I could play it at 60.' When they finally saw it, they said, 'Nevermind, I'm convinced.'"" ""...going back and playing the 30 Hz version feels, to quote some people in the office, 'broken.'"" ""You really just have to feel it.""   So we're all unable to experience Uncharted 4 as it was originally intended until the PS5 is released with a processor that can at least perform to the level of a 2010-era Intel CPU.  I'm unconvinced Naughty Dog is incapable of releasing a 60FPS version of Uncharted 4: “If we wanted to hit a locked 60fps, there’s a lot of optimizations in the environments that would have to happen,” Newman went on. “This would make each level take longer to make.”  What about the option of making Uncharted 4 merely look as good as The Last of Us Remastered in order to hit a consistent 60FPS? Or merely look as good as the upcoming remasters of Uncharted 1, 2 and 3 running at 60FPS?"

OC is simply saying that the experience of playing a game at 60fps is objectively better than that of playing the same game at 30fps."
pcgaming,3df9dw,bl1nds1ght,0,Thu Jul 16 16:53:12 2015 UTC,"That's not how it works. You don't get to make a claim and then ask me to prove the negation. You must first argue how a game at 60 fps is ""objectively"" better than one at 30 fps. You must define what objectively means here, and what grounds (i.e. justifies) it. I won't go into any more detail because there's a tradition of 2000 years in Philosophy that has tried to do much the same with Art and has failed. So if you think you have a better idea than 2000 years of the most brilliant human minds, go ahead."
pcgaming,3df9dw,Trollatopoulous,0,Thu Jul 16 20:24:37 2015 UTC,"Dude, chill.  I didn't attack you, I was simply clarifying the original commentor's statement and asking you to provide some support for your counterclaim for fun.  There's no need for you to go off onto this ungrounded faux-intellectual philosophical masturbation in order to weasel your way out of answering the question.  FWIW, I think it's completely obvious why 60fps is objectively better:    Visually smoother than 30fpx  More accurate inputs than 30fps   In general, it provides higher fidelity than 30fps, which I didn't think would have to be explained."
pcgaming,3df9dw,bl1nds1ght,2,Fri Jul 17 12:12:43 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point. More accurate inputs, what does this even mean? Besides, even if they are more accurate and you somehow demonstrate that that's better, you still need to show how the gains are significant (i.e. people can actually discern and make use of them); technically any sort of gain over the value of 30fps is better (in the sense of more) but that doesn't mean it's meaningful ($1.00001 > $1 but who cares?).   Visually smoother =/= better gaming, because better gaming remains undefined and because people could simply claim the opposite to be the case (or indeed, actually believe it). And in that case, where does your argument stand? Nowhere. E.g. blind tastings, where people can't differentiate between wines even though when they have awareness of the wine they drink they can all ""actually"" tell.  You can't speak of objectivity without an external superior vantage point, and for something like that you'd have to appeal to some sort of 'better-than-human' entity. Good luck with that."
pcgaming,3df9dw,Trollatopoulous,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:48:40 2015 UTC,"More accurate inputs, what does this even mean?   Perhaps better to rephrase it as ""responsiveness,"" or improved accuracy for when your physical input is relayed to the game and the resulting effect is relayed back you.  See the below:   If you’re playing your games at 30 FPS then the amount of time your display is sitting on one frame is 33.3 milliseconds. This means that when you move your mouse to aim at a target, it will take at least 33.3 milliseconds before you even start to see the cursor move. This delay is halved to 16.65ms at 60 FPS and so on. Of course this is without considering other factors such as networking latency (in multiplayer games) and monitor response time which can add additional latency.   (Source).  It also may be helpful for your to view the difference between 30fps and 60fps BF4 example the writer has provided.  Another great example would be to go check out some CS:S surf videos and compare the differences from 30 to 60, as it's extremely noticeable.  Another great example would be the card animations in Hearthstone or the creature animations in LoL.   (i.e. people can actually discern and make use of them)   People can discern the difference and they do make use of the difference.   technically any sort of gain over the value of 30fps is better (in the sense of more) but that doesn't mean it's meaningful ($1.00001 > $1 but who cares?).   Yes, but we're not talking about a difference of .00001%, we're talking about a measurable 100% improvement.  We're not talking about subjective taste that has no quantifiable aspect.  The external superior vantage point is the measurable difference in performance.  This isn't subjective.  Performance of the game is better, the experience of the game is better.  There is absolutely no need to appeal to a better-than-human entity for validation.  In the case of CS:S surf, the framerate has an actual impact on gameplay from the standpoint of removing player speed based on less smooth air-accel curving.  Half the frames means fewer points along a player arc, which means greater in-game ""friction"" around corners, if you will.  With other games that require precise player inputs, like mobas and multiplayer games, that 100% improvement in frame display means better in-game reaction time from your character/commands.  Singleplayer games benefit from the same phenomenon.  To say that this is not objectively better than playing at a lower framerate seems intentionally disingenuous."
pcgaming,3df9dw,bl1nds1ght,2,Fri Jul 17 20:21:39 2015 UTC,"as it's extremely noticeable.   The whole argument rests on this. Where's the study that people can actually notice it, not simply self-reported (due to obvious bias of self-reporting).   measurable difference in performance. This isn't subjective   Performance isn't subjective, you're right. But the game experience is. If you think it isn't, then why do some games like games others don't? And I'm not talking about games that are more or less unanimously considered bad, but about games you would consider good even if you don't like them (e.g. Why do some like DotA 2 but not LoL, and so on). And it's important to think of this because for example we're talking about smoothness but DotA 2 has exactly this rap that it isn't as smooth or as fluid as LoL/other mobas, and yet people can still enjoy that more than the games with supposedly smoother gameplay. And not in spite of this, but because of it."
pcgaming,3df9dw,Trollatopoulous,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:53:32 2015 UTC,"Where's the study that people can actually notice it   Here's a great AskScience thread about it that summarizes some good sources.  I probably should have started with this from the beginning.  ""More than 50% of the population will benefit greatly from FPS of 45+.""   but DotA 2 has exactly this rap that it isn't as smooth or as fluid as LoL/other mobas, and yet people can still enjoy that more than the games with supposedly smoother gameplay. And not in spite of this, but because of it.   Does Dota get a bad rap regarding frames or regarding gameplay?  There is a big difference between framerate smoothness and gameplay tempo or in-game mechanics.  Better fps will still have a positive impact on poor mechanics, for instance.  Again, I'm not arguing that people can't enjoy games with sub-par fps caps.  The argument is that they would just be objectively better mechanical experiences with higher fps."

I briefly watched his stream, and someone asked whether if he was going to play Bloodborne - to which he answered no, because it is 30 fps, and he is just not going to play 30 fps games anymore.  I wholly agree that higher framerates are better than lower framerates. But I wouldn't take it that far. I guess it is pretty subjective but I think that 60fps+ is essential to some games, but clearly not all. I could play super mario sunshine at 30 fps during the gamecube days, and if I played it again right now, I would play it at 60 fps in Dolphin with some extra graphical candy and sharper image thanks to higher resolution. That doesn't mean that the first time around playing the game completely sucked, though.  The issue with adding technical data on the store page beyond minimum requirements is that the average person is already so, so bad with this stuff. They don't know how it affects their gameplay experience and whether if they would personally care about it at all if they knew what was going on. During the GTX 970 debacle (for which I condemn nVidia for and I would have at least expected some sort of a compensation in form of a game or whatever) tech forums had plenty of newcomers who thought their cards were broken, and every time I tried to tell them that the card works as designed, not as advertised.  Yet the forums also had plenty of people who said that there is no issue at all! Look, VRAM is above 3.5GB and no issues (like caching isn't a thing). Some people were telling to swap the card immediately. Next to none were really providing a default answer that would've quickly explained what was going on and how it impacts the card, to give the fella who's asking questions the possibility to make an informed decision. I feel that the same is going on with a lot of the technical stuff. People get sucked in and start spouting nonsense without really understanding even the basics of what is going on. It is sad, but for some reason people make religious cults out of anything.  I personally somewhat understand steam not providing the technical information on the store page, since most people who care know where to find the information anyway. PCGaming Wiki link could be somewhere under the metacritic score (metacritic could be removed while we're at it). Hell, it'd be even better if we had a timed demo or something for every game."

In fact, you can open the user.ini and set vsync to ""0.""

Well, there went all my desire to ever play that game.  Also, 30fps CAN, rarely, be alright-ish, but the game has to be designed around it and not just lazily tossed on.  For example, I played all the way through Bully before I learned that it was capped at 30fps. I don't know why but in that game it just doesn't bother me for whatever reason. Even though I usually can't stand low frame rates."
pcgaming,3df9dw,1Down,14,Thu Jul 16 22:32:35 2015 UTC,Red Alert 3 is a 7 year old game. Also the point of this curator page is to be objective and show all 30 fps capped games regardless of if it's warranted or actually impacts the game or not.   Red Alert series are still good games so if the 30 fps cap still bugs you enough to not want to try that's fine but just be aware that a 30 fps cap doesn't automatically make it bad.

pcgaming,3dihmp,Atrocitusrex,12,Thu Jul 16 16:54:50 2015 UTC,"Randy pitchford recently called gamers who criticized Aliens: Colonial marines ""sadists"" and also said this:   I read it in this way: we moved those people, we touched them – even the person who hates [your game] so much, you’ve affected them. That’s why we fight, we’re creating emotion and experience   Apparently, hating broken product that you paid 50$ for and cant get a refund  is a new ""emotional experience"". Thanks, Gearbox"
pcgaming,3dihmp,SuburbanDinosaur,3,Thu Jul 16 18:26:13 2015 UTC,"The problem is that they've produced some real turds; Aliens: Colonial Marines had the potential to be a really really good game until they farmed out the multiplayer, and delivered a graphical fidelity on the PC that was less than promised...And it's not the first time they've shit on people, which has knocked them right off my automatic preorder list.  I loved Borderlands. I loved Borderlands 2; I'm old enough to have remembered Duke Nukem when pixels really were visible, and felt that it was my duty to support the game that they were releasing - what did we get? a polished turd, with no real hope of a new version of Duke Nukem in sight. Forever was painful. It was embarrassing, and it had jokes and tropes in it that made it actually painful to play.  Then they released the pre-sequel. I bought the game, I bought the season pass - what was my reward for that? Well, 2k down under got closed down, and any of us who bothered to by the season pass can basically write off the cost.  It's a company that I've developed an odd relationship with for that reason; for ever Colonial Marines, Duke Nukem and Borderlands: TPS they produce that diminishes my faith in their capabilities, they then do something that for me, wipes all of that away and makes me despair at them.  I speak, of course, of Homeworld Remastered. It stands, for me as an example of how an update should be done, as it blows what's been done to AoE II out of the water. The love and attention to detail, the level of care they put into bringing that game into the 21st century is breathtaking - the fact that they buy these franchises, beloved and thought lost with the intent of bringing them back gives them a very special place in my heart."

It's so much worse than Dungeon Keeper in my opinion because it totally violates the serious tone the real games had.

Of course that doesn't mean they can necessarily extract quality, and you should be doubly suspicious of most publisher's promises, their vested interest is in making a profit. Very few publishers think long-term, while developers would at least like to make a good game so people will in future keep buying their games."
pcgaming,3dk6xo,Zeriell,3,Thu Jul 16 23:51:54 2015 UTC,"Both Bandai Namco and Koei Tecmo are independent publishers that put out their own games, but in this case Bandai Namco owns the game and is just hiring Omega Force, the development team under Koei Tecmo, to make the game with their Warriors engine. All other decisions are made by Bandai.  Omega Force is notorious for subpar PC ports, but Bandai as a publisher have put out decent PC ports so far, even when outsourced to other developers (Dark Souls 2). This is where the doubt comes in, can I trust in the publisher to put out a decent product, even if the developer is mediocre?"
pcgaming,3dk6xo,Nose-Nuggets,2,Fri Jul 17 00:15:38 2015 UTC,"Every game is different, but typically the smaller or less proven the developer is the more control the publisher has. To the publisher it's merely an investment, and to mitigate risk they want more creative control.   Setting expectations early in development like ""the pc port will be good"", don't always stand the test of time not because the developer is bad, or the publisher are dicks, but because time runs out and there's no more money. I mean, no more money is essentially a fault of the publisher but if the developer cant deliver what they promised everyone is essentially at fault. It's been my experience though that every developer wants to make the best game possible, and that's merely limited by the publishers willing  to keep the money and time flowing."
pcgaming,3dk6xo,JohnnyC4ge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:05:50 2015 UTC,"If the publisher is investing a significant amount of money into the development of the game they have a massive amount of control, to the point where it's possible that an executive from the publisher is entirely in charge of the project.  Whether or not that means good PC port is entirely impossible to predict.  Wait for reviews."

I, personally don't see esports as a sport because all the rules, definitions, etc is in the hand of one corporation. If tomorrow valve decides, it can do anything with the rules of DotA 2 or CS-GO. But sports are made of confederations... Lots and lots of them. If you want to change the rules of the sport, you will need some majority of confederations or change une rule that will impact only the tournaments under that confederation.

What is it when you sit down in your homemade cockpit with your VR headset and wheel, pedals and shifter and you race around a track? That is a more accurate representation of the sport of competitive racing than playing with a toy car is. You act like because you're simulating something in a virtual world then there are no electronic aspects of that.   Everything I just described about playing Assetto Corsa with my racing setup runs on electricity. It is an electronically powered game that is simulating a race. Why does playing with a toy car count as the electronic version of racing but my racing setup does not?  What if someone is playing a soccer game on the Virtuix Omni? There is a physical aspect to play now, so is it entering ""esport"" territory because you have to run while you play?  I don't get why people get so offended when people label a gaming competition as an esport. It's called an electronic sport. They are specifically differentiating it from the more physical sports so people that think real men play sports won't be offended.

No, that's the electronic version of playing with a toy racecar.  Formula E is the electronic version of racing.   What is it when you sit down in your homemade cockpit with your VR headset and wheel, pedals and shifter and you race around a track?   A game, in which you simulate the sport of racing.  With a really nice setup.    Why does playing with a toy car count as the electronic version of racing but my racing setup does not?   This is a logical fallacy known as a ""false dilemma"" because neither of those things are the electronic version of racing.  One is a game and the other is playing with a toy car.   What if someone is playing a soccer game on the Virtuix Omni?    Then they are playing a game which is simulating a sport, using a treadmill as an input device.  (Side note:  I had no idea this thing existed and now I really want to try one).   I don't get why people get so offended when people label a gaming competition as an esport.   Me either.  I'm not offended that you don't agree with my opinion, I just don't share yours.   people that think real men play sports    I don't think there's inherently anything ""less manly"" about playing games.  I know this is meant to refer to ego and pride, but it's more accurate when taken literally.  Sports are played by teams consisting entirely of actual humans using physical objects in the real world.  Games simulate that experience with virtual objects in a world that isn't real, often against competitors who also aren't real.     Ping Pong is an Olympic Sport and we all know that is a game   All sports are games.  Not all games are sports.  Imagine if ""cars"" had been named ""sBoats"", where ""s"" refers to ""street"" in the way that ""e"" refers to ""electronic"".  People would get the idea- sBoats are like boats, in that they're vehicles for transporting people and cargo.  But they have a different physical structure, they use gas-powered wheels instead of wind or water propulsion, and (aside from amphibious vehicles) they don't float on water.  It's not accurate to refer to cars as any kind of boat, but that doesn't make them a bad method of transportation.  It's not accurate to refer to spectator competitive gaming as any kind of sport, but that doesn't make them any less fun to participate in or observe.  It's simply a misnomer."

Moore's law is flawed in that eventually for the doped silicon transistor will hit a wall in that we cannot get more transistors into a fixed volume due to the limitation of the size a single transistor bridge (ie 10nm bridges 22nm bridges etc etc). At sizes approaching angstroms you get more and more electron leakage, more leakage basically turns the ""gate"" into an open breezeway, allowing electrons to freely move between the (+) and (-)."

pcgaming,3dhu72,Joeking1866,2,Thu Jul 16 18:45:29 2015 UTC,The problem is not the manufacture of a small architecture chip. Researchers have built transistors in the picometer range already (src) but even after three years we're still far from seeing them.  The problem is building these chips en masse with reasonable costs and failure rates. Failure rates were the reason why Intels 14nm process didn't pick up the pace quicker.  And you may notice that the article states that these 7nm chips aren't production ready yet (I've seen estimates that it'll take another two years) and that they had to switch to a different material to make it work. The latter means that there will likely be new manufacturing facilities being built in order to even start producing them.  And this isn't just Intel delaying their manufacturing. Other foundries have similar time tables. That's just the difference between a technological breakthrough (first 7nm chip) and a consumer-ready product (mass producible 7nm chips).

Yet the GPU performance has increased far more markedly than CPU performance even when die-size shrinks aren't happening.  Maybe it's largely a function of the lack of competition in the CPU arena? The 10nm shrink may well be a physical problem, either way.  But the architecture changes in the GPU arena seem to net a lot more performance than the changes in the CPU arena.  Maybe the smaller real-estate of processors is playing a role, too.  When we really start to hit the physical size limits of silicon I think we'll first recourse to increasing CPU size.  Maybe a return to the good old cartridge processor days.

This is because the rendering process needs parallel processing, which is what GPUs excel at with their thousands of cores. For CPUs, single thread performance is immensely more important than having a crap ton of cores, adding cores has diminishing returns immediately due to many programs even now utilizing only one core, which is why most computers have no more than 4 high power cores."

At some point you realize your assembly line can't get much faster and adding more than 10 or so lines won't really help if of your customers are only ordering 3 or 4 things at once.   Opening more might help when a group of guys come but otherwise they go unused so it's to expensive to operate.   Lately they've been going to this other chain that offers a cheaper, slower service individually but faster for a large group - aka GPUs. It has a very limited menu but it's good enough for them.

Here is the definition of Moore's Law from Wikipedia:  ""Moore's law"" is the observation that, over the history of computing hardware, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years.  Perhaps someone with more knowledge than I can break it down more thoroughly. But it seems to me that someone is confusing transistor count with process size. Or rather, confusing Moore's Law with Intel manufacturing goals.  Moore's Law seems to still be going strong regardless if Intel can get a high enough, efficient enough yield to get a consumer chip to market on time.  I don't think Moore's Law is dead.  I think that 1 company is failing to bring Moore's Law to the mass-produced consumer level because they lack competition and did not properly plan and invest for the future. Intel is facing technical hurdles brought about by business-influenced decision making.  I think that this pattern is going to be unbroken for quite some time, and I don't think 3 generations of 14nm consumer chips changes that at all.  To make an admittedly bad analogy; you wouldn't say that The Law of Gravity faltered when a person catches himself on a handrail after falling down half a flight of stairs.  It's incorrect to say Moore's Law falters because Intel breaks it's own tick-tock cycle.   And   Going back to the picture that I linked; look at the cluster of the AMD K5, Pentium II, Pentium III, AMD K6, AMD K6-III, and AMD K7. This looks like a case of industry wide failure to uphold Moore's Law, because transistor count didn't meet the trend line. This was pre-2000. I'm sure there were ""Moore's Law is ending"" doom news then too.  But we can clearly see that Moore's Law didn't fail, it ultimately held true. As soon as the manufacturing tech got on the right track, future processors met and even surpassed the expected Moore's Law trend line.  If Intel releases 3 iterations of 14nm, all that (likely) represents is a temporary shift of processors to the right side of the trend line which is ultimately going to look ridiculously insignificant only 10 years from now. If I was a betting man, we will almost assuredly make the technological breakthroughs in manufacturing to get back on or surpass (to the left of) the trend line yet again.  The article uses words such as ""tick-tock shattering"" and ""faltering Moore's Law"", when in reality all that truly damn means is that the next Intel processors are just going to be half a milimeter to the right side of the trend line on that graph."
pcgaming,3dhu72,defiance158,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:03:27 2015 UTC,Moore's law actually failed a long time ago with the death of traditional scaling.  Transistor prices haven't really dropped much node to node and neither has feature size. Effective size has dropped by quite a bit but even that avenue is reaching it's limit's now.

pcgaming,3djr72,nawoanor,-5,Fri Jul 17 13:10:01 2015 UTC,I'm ready to delete my post. Checking every 5 seconds. :)
pcgaming,3djr72,krneki12,7,Fri Jul 17 13:12:25 2015 UTC,"It's more responsive but there are some aspects of it I don't like. The start menu and the search bar inside it are basically 2 ""modern"" apps embedded into the system.    They get suspended just like any other modern app when you close the start menu. What I don't like about this is that they stay in memory and if you do a couple of researches the search app jumps from about 20 MB at idle 70-85 MB of Ram usage and it doesn't decrease when you stop using it, it's a Ram hog. Such a high ram usage just for a search bar is ridiculous. Because of these 2 apps, and since it looks like there are more services running in the background, Windows 10 uses 1.3 GB of ram with only the antivirus running while under the same conditions Windows 8.1 used only 1 GB of Ram on my PC.   I have tried Project Cars which seemed to be more responsive and less prone to fps drops when there are a lot of cars on the screen at the same time; however, I haven't tried it in the rain yet which was quite taxing under Windows 8.  Strangely enough Batman Arkham Knight, that was bundled with my GPU, ran considerably better. The game still suffers from fps drops but they occur less often than in Windows 8.1, especially when driving. I still refuse to play the game until it's fixed since the random fps drops really break the experience. Basically I just ran around for 5 minutes like I did in Windows 8.1 and for this reason I can't comment on it's stability, many people say the game suffers from memory leaks.   The DPC latency has increased by 10-20 points average, 8.1 was around 20-30u while 10 stays around 30-50u. The weird thing is that every 5 or 6 seconds the latency jumps to 6000u for a split second and according to LatencyMon these spikes are caused by the DirectX kernel. It could be Nvidia's fault I am not sure about this but it doesn't seem to impact the games or audio/video playback at all.    The OS has still some bugs, when I booted it up the first time the screen language was set to Japanese. I had Japanese set as secondary language (I speak it a bit and I need the IME to write kanji/kana) on Windows 8.1 and when I upgraded Widows 10 decided to turn it into my first language. I tried to switch the interface back to English with no luck, the new language section of the ""modern"" control panel sucks and the old one seemed to do nothing. So I rolled back to Windows 8.1 and I repeated the upgrade and this time it worked.    The new control panel is a big let down, they omitted some of the more advanced settings under certain sections and you need to fall back to the old one in order to get things done. What's even worse is that the search functionality chooses always the ""modern"" control panel version when you search for a specific setting, for this reason I am forced to open the old control panel and navigate through the sections manually every time I need to change something.  Another big problem I have is that the text in some older apps looks blurry. I have my screen set to 125% DPI since my screen is only 22"", it's 50cm far from me and I don't want to fatigue my eyes. Windows 10 applies the scaling to older apps making their text look blurry, I need to manually set each application to ""disregard DPI scaling"" in the compatibility section.  I also hate the new Windows Update, it forces the updates on you. You can't decide to skip the updates, even the Nvidia drivers are forcefully installed so you can't decide to stay on an older version if want to. There also another nasty thing I don't like, Windows Update has an option that allows you to download the updates directly from other Windows users instead than from MS servers. According to the description it ""Allows faster downloads"" but basically it just p2p, a sort of torrent system that turns your PC in a seedbox for Microsoft so they can have fewer update servers running, cutting the costs in the process while you provide them your upload bandwidth (it can increase your ping), your hard drive and some CPU cycles needed to send the data to the other users. Thankfully it can be disabled, and I would suggest everybody to do so."

For malware, MBAM can't be beaten. For the complete and total Antivirus package (for free) I usually change out depending on which one gets the best results from benchmarks. At the moment, the top rated one is 360 security. It's fantastic because it uses 3 (2?) Antivirus engines and scans your whole pc with them. Although, due to this fact, it is a slow scan."

pcgaming,3dg88k,Orwan,66,Thu Jul 16 13:43:15 2015 UTC,"Here's the lesson here folks - I'm going to bullet point it for clarity.   PC users want to support game development. PC users want to buy the game, but it really doesn't endear them to anyone when they play the PC market as suckers when...However you might feel about the console market, we're clearly more discerning. That if GTA V and The Witcher III should have taught companies such as Ubi and WB anything, it's that the PC market appreciate a product when it's at an acceptable and expected standard, and that generally we don't mind waiting for said result. A lot of upset could have been avoided if QA involved hiring a company with relevant experience (in fact, considering rocksteady are now looking at the port themselves, it probably would have just saved WB money and bad publicity if they'd just stopped farming out PC ports in the first place...Pipe dreaming, I know, but there it is.)   My hope is that seeing an increase in sales on the PC platform in Ubi's portfolio will send a clear message that the PC platform is viable enough to be taken seriously."
pcgaming,3dg88k,Atrocitusrex,29,Thu Jul 16 01:35:47 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I think there's reason behind the madness.  Mediocre ports sell on PC. WB intentionally picked a cheap studio to port because they weren't looking for quality. They wanted something that was kinda working for as little money as possible. Because it's cheaper to anger the ""PC elitists"" than to spend more millions on a proper port. Your average PC gamer probably cares very little about missing FOV sliders or even framerate locks. Especially when modders can take care of that.  WB ""only mistake"" was that the port turned out to be a disaster - worse than they expected it to be. They never actually wanted a good port; too expensive. If it had been a mediocre port people would have moaned a little and there would have been little to no bad press.  That's my guess, anyhow."
pcgaming,3dg88k,Mr_s3rius,2,Thu Jul 16 10:32:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe I missed something along the way, but from everything I've heard (primarily from Dave Lang, their CEO, on a number of podcasts), IG isn't a cheap company to have port your product.   Minor detail in the overall scheme of things, though."
pcgaming,3dg88k,Llero,-4,Thu Jul 16 19:23:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly. PC gamers buy crappy ports all the time. Nothing stops them. We just keep eating it up. Not only are they crappy ports, they are generally crappy games too. But its ok, PC gamers keep buying it. Sure theres the ""US PC GAMERS ARE A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH!! WE REWARD GREAT PC GAMES BUT SPIT OUT THE GARBAGE! WE ARENT LIKE THE CONSOLE GAMERS WHO BUY BLIND, AND WE DONT STAND FOR MEDIOCRITY!"" view, but unfortunately that is the MINORITY. The average gamer BUYS IT ANYWAYS. There is ZERO incentive to go above and beyond making an amazing port of the game, when everyone is going to buy it anyways if its a half-decent/serviceable port. Only reason why this whole AK situation happened is because the port was probably the worst in recent memory, and was borderline unplayable. That- combined with the storm of refunds thanks to Steam's recently implemented refund system, got the attention of the publishers/devs from a financial standpoint. They could give two shits about whether it was a console port or not as long as people couldnt get their money back.  The power of the PC allows for less optimization / effort in the PC port. Dont even get me started on the bullshit of the PC gamer community turning a broken/underwhelming game into a decent game via mods. BUT ITS OK GUYS! BUY THE GAME CUZ WE CAN JUST FIX IT OURSELVES!!!

I don't care if it's Fallout 4 or 99, I am going to more then assume that hundreds or even thousands of people have pre ordered Fallout 4.    Luckily Steam offers refunds now.

They had the power to delay it and essentially fucked themselves. They pissed off a bunch of PC gamers and made a colossal fool of themselves in the process. All this negative PR and disaster of a launch will not be easily forgotten. Let's also not forget the game being pulled from Steam a few days shortly after being released.

pcgaming,3dg88k,jpfarre,3,Thu Jul 16 06:50:27 2015 UTC,"Yes these are the things they are working on. And not the things implemented in the patch. it even says so right there in the text.   Below is the list of the key areas where we are dedicating our resources to improve the experience for our loyal fans:  Support for frame rates above 30FPS in the graphics settings menu  Fix for low resolution texture bug  Improve overall performance and framerate hitches  Add more options to the graphics settings menu  Improvements to hard drive streaming and hitches  Address full screen rendering bug on gaming laptops  Improvements to system memory and VRAM usage  NVIDIA SLI bug fixes  Enabling AMD Crossfire  NVIDIA and AMD updated drivers While we work on improving performance, we will also continue to make interim patches available to address issues for those still playing the game on PC. The first patch is being released now and the updates include:  Fixed a crash that was happening for some users when exiting the game  Fixed a bug which disabled rain effects and ambient occlusion. We are actively looking into fixing other bugs to improve this further  Corrected an issue that was causing Steam to re-download the game when verifying the integrity of the game cache through the Steam client  Fixed a bug that caused the game to crash when turning off Motion Blur in BmSystemSettings.ini. A future patch will enable this in the graphics settings menu  .... So no, the patch had nothing to do with performance. You really just confirmed what i said above. The way the text is formatted was confusing to a lot of folks. Because the logical way to set it up would be to have the ""work in progress"" part last."

pcgaming,3dg88k,_ALLDAY_,12,Thu Jul 16 23:12:42 2015 UTC,"Mmmm depends on what you mean. Plenty of games have launched in a crap state with the devs knowing they would be that way. AC Unity was bad, Halo MCC was bad, etc.         I think this game is only blowing up like this on the company side because of Steam and Green Man refunds. They actually have to do something about it because they are losing money."
pcgaming,3dg88k,TheLawlessMan,5,Thu Jul 16 01:28:50 2015 UTC,"Yea, I don't know if I've ever seen a launch as bad as Halo MCC.  It was completely unplayable for a lot of people for months.  If you bought Halo MCC you got access to the Halo 5 beta.  The Halo 5 beta ran way better than the retail release of the MCC.  It's not good when a beta for a game that is 10 months away from release runs better than a game that is currently available."

pcgaming,3dg88k,caribou_doodoo,2,Thu Jul 16 04:43:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as shit as unity was, it ran like shit on consoles too, and at least it doesn't have forced parity like Arkham knight does, and likely still will do after it's been patched since rocksteady have claimed its their intention for the recommended specs to match next gen console performance, despite a GTX 980 smoking the hardware of a PS4.  It's kind of sad since the game is such a horrible port, people aren't realising it's almost as bad as watchdogs on the console-PC parity front"
pcgaming,3dg88k,coltkickass,-4,Thu Jul 16 06:01:16 2015 UTC,"Dude, stop talking about Watch Dogs. Did you even play it? I played it on a God damn GTX 750 and it ran very well. Using medium 1080p I was getting 50+ fps, better than what I get in Shadow of Mordor and many times better than The Witcher 3. I always hate it when people talk down the W_D port quality cause if it was so shit I wouldn't have been getting very respectable performance on my measly hardware."
pcgaming,3dg88k,himmatsj,4,Thu Jul 16 10:55:25 2015 UTC,i also played watch dogs with a 780 ti and it ran like ass. did you play at launch or only a few months ago. when it launched the game was almost unplayable. the stuttering is ridiculous. if you went faster than 40mph in a car the game would stutter like crazy and cars would suddenly appear in front of you
pcgaming,3dg88k,guma822,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:48:48 2015 UTC,"I think they may have fixed the stuttering issues now, my experience was relatively stutter free (have been playing it infrequently the past few months), regular  frame drops haven't been fixed tho nor has the graphical downgrade, some updates even stopped the worsemod from working"

I'm not talking about how the game performs, but how without the worsemod it looks identical to the PS4 version, just a bit less muddy and blurry when using AA. But, since you asked, yes I have played watchdogs, and the performance is still dogshite. On a 980 at 1080P maxed out with no AA it runs at 50-55fps when on foot, and 45 fps with frequent drops down to 30 when driving, that is NOT good performance."

pcgaming,3dikey,MrLucky7s,15,Thu Jul 16 15:42:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, what you wrote is correct. Sometimes these resellers obtain keys from other sites' promotions or other dubious means, which can cause them to be revoked from whatever poor sap bought them later. If you have to purchase protection from keys being revoked that's a massive red flag.  The only way to ""combat"" these sites is to stop using them and only buy games from authorized sellers.  This article is pretty good if you want more information:  http://www.trustinplay.com/2015/01/26/purchase-games-g2a/"
pcgaming,3dikey,code-sloth,2,Thu Jul 16 15:47:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response and the link.
pcgaming,3dikey,ZenZibbeh,3,Thu Jul 16 15:52:35 2015 UTC,You don't even need that payment protection shit though. It is only for the misinformed.  If your key doesn't work. Dispute it on Paypal. That is why you pay paypal fees on purchases.
pcgaming,3dikey,TucoBenedictoPacif,6,Thu Jul 16 15:49:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, here's the quickest possible explanation.  The general idea is that these key resellers are actually just ""exploiting regional pricing to sell cheap copies in countries with a strong currency"". FOr instance buying retail copies in China or Russia and then selling them to European or American users.  I'm sure you'll find a lot of people who consider this already morally questionable, but personally I don't give a flying fuck and for how I see it if corporations are authorized by the law to export their manufacture for better profits, then in the same way customers have every right to try to circumvent unfavorable local pricing.  That said, this is only the beginning, because on top of this premise, there are also a certain amount of less reputable key reseller which apparently seem to rely in shady if not openly fraudulent practices to buy their copies.   There have been reports of serial keys bought in stock with false/stolen credit cards, for instance. But let's be clear, whoever is going to tell you that's always the case is a clueless idiot, since if it was actually so most of these resellers wouldn't last a week. In fact, many of the most ""reputable"" ones among these key reseller give you even full guarantee that if anything should ever go wrong with your activation they'll refund you or replace your key.  P.S. Oh, it's also worth noting that there are also few absolutely legitimate stores (like the Brazilian ""Nuveem"", which unlike most of these mentioned above is a legitimate digital reseller) and that's a different story entirely, since it's a store that should theoretically sell just to Brazilian users, but their ""street blocks"" for foreign customers are incredibly easy to avoid)."
pcgaming,3dikey,osubeavs721,2,Thu Jul 16 16:20:20 2015 UTC,"The sites don't sell the keys themselves, they provide the platform to. So users who may get the keys in shady ways have a legal way to sell them. I've used g2a a few times and never had an issue. If the deal seems too good to be true, then it is. So you have to be cautious."
pcgaming,3dikey,Cynooo,4,Thu Jul 16 17:05:22 2015 UTC,"Here's the argument for the sites:  If I have 50 to spend on games and I do so through G2A, buying 2 games for 25 each, that is the same thing as buying 1 game for 50 as far as developers are concerned.  I have bought several games from G2A and the like that I never would have paid full price for. So instead of focusing solely on lost sales, look at the bigger picture.  In fact, due to ostracizing and pushing these sites further to the ""black"" end of the grey market it becomes more difficult to cooperate on things like credit card fraud. This is the one thing that really does cost money."
pcgaming,3dikey,Cynooo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:41:04 2015 UTC,"Uhh... I don't think that math adds up. Let's say you're buying 2 games, from the same developer, one for 25$ each. Obviously the seller got them for even cheaper. Let's say he is selling them for a 5$ profit (So he bought them for 20$ each). If the dev always gets 50% of the sales share. For those 2 games he got 10$ each for a grand total of 20$.   If you were to buy one game at 50$ and the dev gets 50% he would get 25$.  So the dev is ""selling"" at a loss ""through"" G2A.  (involuntary as well)  Or did I get something wrong?"
pcgaming,3dikey,Cynooo,-1,Thu Jul 16 17:52:01 2015 UTC,"you're assuming a fixed margin of $5 for the seller, which is rather silly considering there are games that cost less than $5.  also you are missing a step in the $50 transaction, which is the store selling the $50 game"
pcgaming,3dikey,Cynooo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:00:30 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not missing anything in that. I said that I assume the dev always gets 50% of the revenue.  Your reseller isn't spawning that key out of thin air. He buys it from a store as well (IE Steam), but in that region it costs 20$ instead of 50$ (In both cases the revenue share is 50% for the dev), then sells it for a profit.   EDIT: As for the 5$ margin, it's an example. The amount of profit the reseller makes is of no concern. I'm discussing the devs. loss."
pcgaming,3dikey,Cynooo,-2,Thu Jul 16 18:03:35 2015 UTC,"well, yes, that is true.  But by that logic every other site is equally bad for the developer, like gmg, gog, gamersgate, humble store."
pcgaming,3dikey,CricketDrop,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:07:54 2015 UTC,"Actually no. GMG, GOG, Gamersgate, Humble Store, Amazon (As far as I'm aware) are licensed sellers. They do not buy the keys from a cheaper region and then resell but rather obtain them through the publisher or a wholesaler."
pcgaming,3dikey,zeug666,-2,Thu Jul 16 18:10:34 2015 UTC,and g2a-types get their product from a wholesaler in a lower price country
pcgaming,3dikey,crazboy84,0,Thu Jul 16 18:13:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but selling that product in another price-region is not exactly legal.  EDIT: To clarify, I do not know whether certain countries have state-laws against this, but companies do reserve rights to cancel those codes, or in other ways legally purse the sellers."

pcgaming,3dfbr0,KingKittyWizard,19,Thu Jul 16 01:17:00 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that every game that is locked is tagged as such so as to remain objective.  In the interest of providing unbiased info to the consumer, TB isn't making the call on which games need > 30 fps and which ones can get by with locked 30."

pcgaming,3dfbr0,throwawaygg_7,5,Thu Jul 16 02:21:12 2015 UTC,"Oh, sorry I misunderstood.  I actually would believe it.  Have you heard of Richard Stallman?  He's a bit of a nutcase about privacy.  Here's a comment he made about how he browses the web:   I am careful in how I use the Internet.  I generally do not connect to web sites from my own machine, aside from a few sites I have some special relationship with. I usually fetch web pages from other sites by sending mail to a program (see git://git.gnu.org/womb/hacks.git) that fetches them, much like wget, and then mails them back to me. Then I look at them using a web browser, unless it is easy to see the text in the HTML page directly. I usually try lynx first, then a graphical browser if the page needs it (using konqueror, which won't fetch from other sites in such a situation).  I occasionally also browse unrelated sites using IceCat via Tor. Except for rare cases, I do not identify myself to them. I think that is enough to prevent my browsing from being connected with me.  I never pay for anything on the Web. Anything on the net that requires payment, I don't do. (I made an exception for the fees for the stallman.org domain, since that is connected with me anyway.) I also avoid paying with credit cards.  I would not mind paying for a copy of an e-book or music recording on the Internet if I could do so anonymously, and it were ethical in other ways (no DRM or EULA). But that option almost never exists. I keep looking for ways to make it exist.   I don't know why he does it, but to me it seems like it's out of principle.  Anyhow, if he's that extreme, I'm sure there are people who are that extreme about gaming at 60fps or 120fps or 144fps or something."
pcgaming,3dfbr0,Slatz_Grobnik,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:32:47 2015 UTC,"Heh, wow that is seriously extreme. I mean, I knew that Stallman was a bit of a nut but that's some next level paranoia right there. Still though, while I think that he - and others of his ilk - go a little to far for my tastes, I'm glad that they exist because these are the kind of people who both push the envelope of what is possible and act as a barometer for where things currently are."
pcgaming,3dfbr0,fizzywinkstopkek,-4,Thu Jul 16 12:03:21 2015 UTC,"It's objectivity that fails its intended purpose. It'd be like a wilderness survival guide that included rocks, the sun, and the idea of the color turquoise on a list of things you cannot eat in a forest survival situation.   All it ends up doing is leaving the actual offenders here, where it's an unwarranted and unnecessary cap, off the hook by the inclusion of irrelevant cases."
pcgaming,3dfbr0,brandonw00,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:00:32 2015 UTC,"what you just said makes no sense at all.  if the purpose of the list is to list every game that runs at 30fps and it lists every game that runs at 30fps, then it is doing its job. if it does not list every game that runs at 30fps, then it is not doing its job."
pcgaming,3dfbr0,HighRelevancy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:25:41 2015 UTC,"Look at it this way - the name is the Framerate police. If the regular police ticketed someone who was going 60 in a 30, you'd understand that. If they ticked someone who was going 32 in a 30 maybe you see that as tough but fair or maybe you'd see that as unwarranted. At the point they ticket the firetruck you should be asking what the hell they're doing, and when they ticket the golf ball you know their crazy.  What is 30fps and what is not 30fps isn't relevant data in and of itself. It requires context to be meaningful. It's creating the illusion of informed choice, and either couching its cowardice in its purported objectivity or doing some sort of dogwhistle bullshit to score rhetorical points. Come out and fucking say ""this is the list of games that are crap because they have an FPS lock at 30."" That's a useful list."
pcgaming,3dfbr0,MiWadiGamer,4,Thu Jul 16 18:13:36 2015 UTC,"It makes absolutely zero judgement. It simply says whether the game is capped or not and if that capped by be fixed(if you want to). It does  not judge a game, bad or good, on said cap. It is simply information for the costumer's perusal so that they can make an informed choice."

pcgaming,3df41e,Skyline969,19,Wed Jul 15 22:48:14 2015 UTC,This is pretty much so they can tell you to sod off if you bitch/complain about something broken but not running an up to date version. It means they ahve only one version ever to support.
pcgaming,3df41e,Folsomdsf,6,Thu Jul 16 00:57:26 2015 UTC,"The flip side is if they release a patch that borks system they are going to get reemed in the ass in lawsuits.  The better solution would have been to have it turned on by default, but have a way to change it for advanced users."
pcgaming,3df41e,azriel777,6,Thu Jul 16 10:26:11 2015 UTC,That's actually why they expanded the insider program so much and essentially are letting people who joined it have free copies of windows 10 under the insider program license. These are people with free copies who will continue to use them under the insider program and getting updates before you.
pcgaming,3df41e,Folsomdsf,4,Thu Jul 16 10:34:08 2015 UTC,"But on the other other hand (would that be the first hand?) because there is only one version to support the level of testing prior to release will be (theoretically) greater, and the level of importance on a non-functional release will be (realistically) significanly greater.  So if a bad patch does come out you can be sure that Microsoft will have a far greater interest in getting it fixed asap."
pcgaming,3df41e,AdviceWithSalt,18,Thu Jul 16 13:56:45 2015 UTC,"The windows insider program is going to continue past the release, so each update will have been beta tested."

pcgaming,3df41e,Farsyte,9,Wed Jul 15 23:33:51 2015 UTC,So automatic updates are also forced on in 10?  Kind of a bummer especially if they start nagging to restart the system after an update.
pcgaming,3df41e,JohnnyC4ge,7,Wed Jul 15 23:43:43 2015 UTC,"So far. I've got it sequestered in a VM, and started just leaving the VM shut down most of the time to keep it from suddenly taking over the network link. The most recent update actually went well; I fired up the VM in the morning, was out most of the day, and when friends got online it was ready to go. The update before that -- admittedly a while back as I'm running this on the ""slow"" update track -- it saturated my net while I was trying to work (I telecommute), then gave me a choice of rebooting immediately or after a too-short delay.  Apparently their idea is that with Professional you can delay (or maybe not accept?) an update but the Personal license basically means when they update, you update. If that's changed, that's cool, but I am thinking that when 10 goes gold, I'll be killing the VM.  Unless my Sins of a Solar Empire addiction kicks up. again. sigh."
pcgaming,3df41e,Farsyte,3,Wed Jul 15 23:58:23 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed response.

pcgaming,3df41e,Eustace_Savage,6,Thu Jul 16 08:14:25 2015 UTC,If you have the pro version you can delay updates for six months. That's more than long enough for any problematic updates to be fixed.
pcgaming,3df41e,MaxCHEATER64,3,Wed Jul 15 23:30:28 2015 UTC,What the fuck? They are forcing mandatory updates on the Pro version? They are mad.
pcgaming,3df41e,Dravonic,4,Thu Jul 16 13:12:05 2015 UTC,AFAIK Pro gets to delay for six months and Enterprise gets to skip updates entirely. Home has to install them.
pcgaming,3df41e,MaxCHEATER64,5,Thu Jul 16 14:25:23 2015 UTC,"WHEN they release an update that completely breaks something   FTFY, it has happened in the past it will happen again.  There are too many diverse system builds and software to cover every possibility.  This is a really stupid move on microsofts part and as soon as they release something that bricks millions of machines they are going to be neck deep in individual and class action lawsuits.  From a system admin perspective this is a nightmare scenario because there is literally nothing they can do if this happens except get yelled at by their boss and employees."

At the moment though, ""Windows as a service"" is starting to sound like a wresting of control over my PC, at which point it's becoming less like a PC and more like a console. No thanks.  Looks like I'll be sticking with Xubuntu as much as I practically can and will only boot into Windows 10 when I have to.

Microsoft still has to update its product lifecycle for Windows 10. That will be an interesting challenge, because the traditional 10-year support lifecycle is inconsistent with the entire idea of ""Windows as a service.""  To date Microsoft has not defined what the supported lifetime of a device will be. It remains plausible that Windows 7 being supported until 2020 will outlast the support lifetime of Windows 10."
pcgaming,3df41e,found-a-universe,3,Thu Jul 16 01:50:26 2015 UTC,"It remains plausible that Windows 7 being supported until 2020 will outlast the support lifetime of Windows 10.   No. Microsoft have a policy of 5 + 5 years of life cycle.   All Desktop Operating System products, whether used for personal or business purposes, receive a minimum of 10 years of support (minimum of 5 years Mainstream Support and minimum of 5 years Extended Support) at the supported service pack level.    Win 10 will be supported for a minimum until 2025, with maybe an extension depending if they add time for each update they do."

Microsoft is yet to define this phrase and it will be big news when they do. While Microsoft will be supporting their latest operating system in the abstract they may define the hardware it is running on as no longer supported in the particular. I am merely suggesting that the supported lifetime of a particular device running Windows 10 could potentially be less than the supported lifetime of an identical device remaining on Windows 7.  How long will Windows 10 with its continuously updating ""Windows as a service"" model run flawlessly on a 32-bit Intel Atom with 1GB of RAM? If you genuinely think it is 2025 then I suspect you are in for a surprise."

Nope. Not ever. Microsoft is in it for the business. There is no way MS will tell a business: Sorry you have to upgrade your Win10 computer because your device is out of supported lifetime. Win 7 is out of support in 2020 btw. You are talking about a 5 years supported life time for some Win 10. Forget it, not gonna happen.   How long will Windows 10 with its continuously updating ""Windows as a service model"" run flawlessly on a 32-bit Intel Atom with 1GB of RAM? If you genuinely think it is 2025 then I suspect you are in for a surprise.   I won't call a 32 bit atom with 1 GB running flawlessly tho. I have a Samsung NC110 with Win 8.1 on it and running more than a web browser on it is painful.  But why it would stop to run? Once the device is out of the ""supported lifetime of the device"" they will stop upgrading and continue running with security patches till at least 2025.  I don’t know how they gonna do it, but there is no way that MS will stop giving security update to any Win 10 computer before 2025."
pcgaming,3df41e,Koutou,2,Thu Jul 16 08:06:50 2015 UTC,Microsoft commits to 10-year support lifecycle for Windows 10
pcgaming,3df41e,Koutou,2,Fri Jul 17 20:31:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the update!  This is an impressive undertaking given the new development model. I fear this is going to be like Android where a device is technically capable of staying up-to-date but this depends upon the OEM releasing new drivers for older devices.  Let's revisit an example where this shouldn't be a problem. We have a 32-bit Intel Atom Netbook with (basic Intel integrated graphics) and 1GB of RAM. Microsoft has clarified that ""A device may not be able to receive updates if the device hardware is incompatible, lacking current drivers, or otherwise outside of the Original Equipment Manufacturer's (""OEM"") support period.""  We can assume the hardware is no longer supported by the OEM (this is ancient hardware) but it is reasonable to assume Intel will maintain drivers for their integrated graphics. If a Microsoft update breaks the device it will be Microsoft's doing. The device used to work, the hardware hasn't changed, Intel are doing their bit, but Microsoft's programme of continuous improvement could be just too punishing for the hardware constraints.  If this happens Microsoft can say, 'sorry, your hardware is ""outside of the Original Equipment Manufacturer's (""OEM"") support period.""' It wasn't intentional. Microsoft intended to give you another 10 years of support. But it just isn't feasible and the OEM won't come to the party.  Unless I'm mistaken you used to be able to rely upon Windows hardware continuing to work with the same version of Windows. You might not be able to upgrade to the next version of Windows but at least the original version (most likely) kept working. With Windows 10 being modelled upon continuous release (as ""the last version of Windows"") it is more uncertain if existing hardware will have trouble running the current operating system adequately.  ""Update availability may vary, for example by country, region, network connectivity, mobile operator (e.g., for cellular-capable devices), or hardware capabilities (including, e.g., free disk space)."" That's another thing Netbooks can be short of: disk space (especially the flash-based ones).  You wrote: ""I don’t know how they gonna do it, but there is no way that MS will stop giving security update to any Win 10 computer before 2025."" Kudos to Microsoft maintaining their 10 year support policy! But I suspect the realities of continuous/incremental software development releases are going to collide with the best of intentions.  ""It's possible that some new features in a future version of Windows 10 won't work on older devices. In fact, that scenario is already true for the Windows Hello feature, which will only be available at launch on a handful of devices with Intel RealSense cameras. But in those cases the devices will still receive security fixes and other feature updates for which it's eligible.""  Every time an older device can't install a particular update Microsoft have internally created a new branch of Windows. Every security update after that date has to work and be tested upon each internal branch of Windows. Future security updates cannot depend upon functionality that doesn't work on an older device. This is a very difficult software engineering problem.  Android is free. Nearly everyone would love to run the latest version of Android on their phones:  ""The association tested 171 Android smartphones that it had acquired over the last two years, applying the latest software update provided by the manufacturer... Half of the phones, even after updating, still ran a version two years old (Android 4.3), or older. Those versions have known security flaws.""  Let's hope Microsoft OEMs don't make the same mistakes as Google OEMs."

pcgaming,3df41e,Totenglocke42,2,Thu Jul 16 18:17:28 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of concern in this thread about automatic updates so I'll clarify somethings. This is how I understand the update process will work, I work for MS and this is my understanding of the update process (not the official party line).  Automatic update does not mean it will update without warning you. If you are actively using the system, the update does not happen. The system learns times when you don't use the system and then updates in that time. If you are using your system during that time, it wont update. If you go to Windows update you should see the time Windows thinks is appropriate, you can change it if you want, or you can set it to notify you before any updates are applied. It means that there is a certain window of time you can wait before you apply the update and windows will tell you that it has the update and you can choose to install it when you're ready.  Then there is the insider program, updates will have been more thoroughly tested on a wider variety of system configs. than just the system configurations that Microsoft employees have so there are less chances of getting an update that breaks things.   The third thing is that updates will roll out in phases so not everyone will get the update at the same time to minimize the damage if an update does break something.   Obviously this isn't perfect but the idea is that with this approach we can push out features and security patches quicker and hopefully you'll have a more stable and secure system.  Fingers crossed/"
pcgaming,3df41e,loln00b,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:08:33 2015 UTC,"The system learns times when you don't use the system and then updates in that time   Also seems like Windows 8.1 does this already.

pcgaming,3df41e,TDuffin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:40:03 2015 UTC,"May be, I'm not 100% sure. I wasn't involved with 8.1 so I am not super familiar.

pcgaming,3ddljw,armyrope115,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:02:56 2015 UTC,Yaw would be X-axis because it causes the plane to move side to side. Roll would be Y-axis and Pitch would be Z-axis.

pcgaming,3ddljw,AppleDane,34,Wed Jul 15 15:43:55 2015 UTC,"I love the Just Cause games, and this looks sweet, but I have on reservation.  In his review of Minecraft, Yhatzee explained why Minecraft was more fun than Garry's mod- because you actually had to work to get components to build things, making your explosions, buildings, and contraptions all the more satisfying to create.   With Garry's mod, you can clap your hands and get 50,000 explosive barrels and blow them up, and frankly it gets boring after a while because there's really no investment.  Point is, I hope that in spite of unlimited C4, multiple teathers, instant airdrops, and the ability to basically fly, JC3 still remains somewhat challenging. Because when I modded my JC2 save game to have all of those features, it got kind of boring."
pcgaming,3ddljw,peatymasta,14,Wed Jul 15 23:09:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I was thinking. I remember getting tons of mods for JC2, giving me invincible cars with infinite mass and infinite acceleration, allowing multiple super-strong tethers, making the C4 create petrol-station-sized explosions, and of course Rico was invincible with infinite ammo, too. At first, it was fun, but it just got so boring doing the same thing over and over again.    Blowing up refineries and shooting cars' front tires to make them flip only entertains you for so long, and after a while I just wanted more story. Unfortunately, based on this playthrough, it doesn't look like we'll be getting much story. I'll still buy it, of course, but I hope it's something a little different to what we've seen so far."
pcgaming,3ddljw,CharlieDeBeadle,10,Wed Jul 15 16:18:54 2015 UTC,"Well the Just Cause story is pretty crap, in my opinion, but it OWNS the whole ""B-rated action movie"" feeling, making it just fun and ridiculous. What I'm driving at, is, that gas station explosion would be much, much, more satisfying if you had to work for it to get so huge like, leaking gas on the floor, driving the right vehicle into it (like a gas tanker!), and strategically placing C4.  Maybe we still CAN do even crazier things than we've seen in this trailer with a little work. It's a whole new game, so I'm just hoping they've addressed the fact that Rico is now a walking atom bomb, and adjusted the world accordingly."
pcgaming,3ddljw,peatymasta,4,Wed Jul 15 17:21:27 2015 UTC,You ever tried wiremod or E2 scripting in Garry's mod? Very satisfying.
pcgaming,3ddljw,mrtransisteur,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:30:43 2015 UTC,It's the same reason I got bored with Saints Row 4. God-like powers made the game too boring.
pcgaming,3ddljw,cheezballs,2,Wed Jul 15 20:11:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, I'm all for a more powerful Rico, but they'll have to up the ante on the game world to adjust for it."
pcgaming,3ddljw,peatymasta,60,Wed Jul 15 20:40:38 2015 UTC,"I loved JC 1 and 2. JC 3 looks awesome, but I get the feeling that this series is going the same way as Saint's Row. Start out relatively serious, a bit of a GTA rival, end up insane with giant dildos."
pcgaming,3ddljw,BennyBonesOG,34,Wed Jul 15 21:28:13 2015 UTC,Hmm I'm not sure. I think that Just Cause 3 looks just as crazy as JC2. I don't think it's straying too far from what they did in JC2 at all. It seems they're just ramping up how many things you can blow up and making it even more fun to do. Which I love.
pcgaming,3ddljw,PrettyDamnSuperFunny,5,Wed Jul 15 14:04:01 2015 UTC,"That's kind of what Saint's Row did! One game you're punching people in the face with fists, the next you're doing it in a hotdog costume using a vibrator. I'm not saying it's a bad thing though. In fact, it's probably good. SR3 was the first of the Saint's Row games where the voice of the developers came through and it was a better, though also insane, game for it.   I'm not saying JC3 is gonna be as insane. But I'm saying the pattern is going down the road of crazy, crazier, craziest. I'm looking forward to it."
pcgaming,3ddljw,BennyBonesOG,11,Wed Jul 15 14:34:39 2015 UTC,"Oh I totally get what you mean. I just don't think Just Cause is going down that road. I mean, I'm not seeing anything equivalent to the dildo sword in Saints Row. That being said, I wouldn't mind a dildo in Just Cause. To be honest, every game needs a dildo sword."

pcgaming,3ddljw,Katamori777,48,Wed Jul 15 17:08:41 2015 UTC,JC2 was significantly better than JC though and it looks as if JC3 will be even better. Maybe I'm weird but Saints Row The Third was my favorite SR game.
pcgaming,3ddljw,PlayerNero,14,Wed Jul 15 17:15:19 2015 UTC,I'm not saying it's a bad thing! SR 3 is the first one where they found their voice. It's widely considered a superb game for that exact reason.
pcgaming,3ddljw,BennyBonesOG,12,Wed Jul 15 14:26:40 2015 UTC,"I liked 4 for the storyline, but we were definitely OP. I'm not going to lie and say I didn't enjoy it, but I'd love it if there was a way to load the SR3 map into SR4 (so no alien ships in the background) and get rid of powers after beating the game."
pcgaming,3ddljw,productfred,3,Wed Jul 15 14:40:04 2015 UTC,"I loved the gang system in SR3, I'd love to be able to play SR3, but with the new powers and guns from SR4."
pcgaming,3ddljw,RickyWars1,3,Wed Jul 15 14:46:43 2015 UTC,I think it might be easier to backport the new things from SR4 into SR3 than to try and bring the SR3 version of Steelport into SR4.
pcgaming,3ddljw,pulley999,3,Wed Jul 15 15:47:45 2015 UTC,"Well after you beat the game (it's not really a spoiler), you can change the time of day/etc from inside the ship since you're inside a simulation. But you can't get rid of the alien ships and stuff inside the virtual world. Technically, SR4's powers were present in SR3 for a mission or two; namely fast running."
pcgaming,3ddljw,productfred,3,Wed Jul 15 16:36:10 2015 UTC,"I know, I 100%ed both games, and do some light personal modding work. The map is currently the least understood of anything in the game from a modding perspective and also the most tightly locked down. I've ported a few SR4 clothing items back into SR3 with mixed success, though I did have to replace existing items.  E: Still need to finish the SR4 DLCs, waiting for my co-op partner to be able to play again."
pcgaming,3ddljw,pulley999,3,Wed Jul 15 16:47:19 2015 UTC,"Can you elaborate on ""tightly locked down""? I myself make audio mods for Payday 2, so I'm not stranger to modding. But I haven't tried maps."
pcgaming,3ddljw,productfred,5,Wed Jul 15 16:53:22 2015 UTC,"Nobody has a real understanding of the map formats, the encryption/compression hasn't been fully broken yet; though Volition is trying to help that along now they're under a more mod-friendly publisher.   That and the SR games are really... touchy about memory addresses - there's some wizardry they pulled to get it to fit into 512MB on the consoles and it doesn't enjoy being poked with a stick, so changes also have to usually be smaller. They're working on a modding patch for SR4 that makes it more robust in this regard, but it's also slow progress.  On top of all that, they changed the way the map format works between SR3 and 4, partially to do different things in 4 and partially because of an in-house software change. Some other stuff like clothing remains compatible, however. Only recently has the ability to add custom weapon models been realized with a lot of help from the developers. We're a long way off from doing anything with the map.  EDIT: That isn't already part of the game, like swapping out zombie island for regular island in SR3, or adding the military airship back in."

pcgaming,3ddljw,opetra,3,Wed Jul 15 17:19:35 2015 UTC,"Some do. I think it's important to have some story to give to what Rico is doing more context, the characters  extra depth and the game gets more variety. That being said, you can't expect Mass Effect-like story and dialogue options from JC3. But the story and characters are something that we tried to improve."
pcgaming,3ddljw,opetra,2,Wed Jul 15 16:19:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I liked the amount of story in JC2, not that I mind a bit more. I like to have a little structure to my wanton destruction."

pcgaming,3ddljw,Eltron6000,19,Thu Jul 16 07:14:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like it has the same issue that JC2 did - not much substance underneath all the destruction.  Yeah its fun to fly around and blow shit up, but if the actual world doesn't feel much alive then that sort of game play can get stale pretty quick.  Also, is there going to be co-op?  If not that's pretty disappointing.  Kind of seems like they just took JC2 and moved the islands around a bit..."
pcgaming,3ddljw,SemSevFor,10,Wed Jul 15 17:23:42 2015 UTC,IIRC they said there would not be any co-op at release but might be something they decide to add later on due to the fan demand for it.  I mean the fans made a mod so you could play the game multiplayer and it was a big thing.  Hopefully they don't screw that up.
pcgaming,3ddljw,DifficultApple,4,Wed Jul 15 21:33:40 2015 UTC,I'll most likely get JC3 but I agree that it's a pretty underwhelming looking change from 2.  I wouldn't think twice if someone said that whole video was just a mod for JC2.
pcgaming,3ddljw,MangoTangoFox,10,Wed Jul 15 14:39:55 2015 UTC,"That guy sounds almost exactly like Ken Block...  I dislike when they use such terminology like this. It's clickbait, just like random YouTubers do when they re-post all of the E3 trailers with ""Playthrough"" or ""Walkthrough"" in the title. When you search for such terms, you want an actual start to finish playthrough/walkthrough/guide for the game. Additionally, the cinematic bits look nice, but they clearly aren't part of the game. It's not at all indicative of what these moments will look like while playing. Fine otherwise, but again they did call it a ""Playthrough""  The only new information I saw was the ""stunt system"" for walking on moving vehicles which seems like it could open up tons of possibilities for neat tricks."
pcgaming,3ddljw,Won_Doe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:23:02 2015 UTC,"It is ""E3 footage"" though. It's really hard to care about because they play the game in such a heavily scripted way. It's a little frustrating how you can't really get any raw gameplay footage nowdays until the actual game is released. I understand it's for marketing (trying to make everything look good) but it's not until the game is in your hands that you start to discover misleading/buggy/non-functioning ""features""."

pcgaming,3dd85u,168523,9,Sat Jul 18 14:28:02 2015 UTC,"You'd probably get the worst of both, as cards in Crossfire should match each other to the lowest common denominator— the cut-down number of stream processors and texture units of the 390, and the slower memory of the 290x.  Not the best pairing."
pcgaming,3dd85u,CalcProgrammer1,9,Wed Jul 15 16:30:47 2015 UTC,"Crossfire doesn't touch cores or clocks.  The only thing that must match is the VRAM size, any extra VRAM goes unused after the least common amount.  Since Crossfire is AFR for the most part, the higher clocks will benefit one card while the core count benefits the other.  All that matters is that both cards can render in less than 2 frame times and have the same core architecture."

It will be years before even a small fraction of PC games will be using it.  Look at DX10/11 adoption rates.  Vulkan will support the same features AFAIK, but it has the same issue."
pcgaming,3dd85u,GrimResistance,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:35:46 2015 UTC,Is it possible that some developers will make their existing games dx12 compatible or is that just too much of a pain in the ass for them to bother?
pcgaming,3dd85u,CalcProgrammer1,2,Wed Jul 15 22:35:00 2015 UTC,"Most likely no.  Developers have a hard time going back and doing the easiest of changes to their games.  DX12 is a more low level focused API (same as Vulkan, Mantle) and so it would probably be a significant rewrite of engine code.  Maybe when the remastered/collector/pay-us-more-money editions come out."
pcgaming,3dd85u,Leetums,2,Wed Jul 15 23:00:26 2015 UTC,"Dont expect it to be an abundant amount of games, but there will definitely be current games that add dx12.

The entire OS has overhead, and even implementations of DX9/10/11 may be improved for performance.  That doesn't mean that all games have been rewritten for DX12 features, it just means that the OS does all the things it used to do faster than it used to do them."
pcgaming,3dd85u,Arknell,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:21:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification. Here's hoping that tendency won't get wing clipped post-july 29th!
pcgaming,3dd85u,pb7280,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:50:58 2015 UTC,"In that way you cause microstutter though, that's why frame pacing is a thing, slows the rendering of the faster card so they pump frames out at the same pace. It may not be through clocks but it does through utilization. If one is faster than the other you'd get microstutter!"
pcgaming,3dd85u,CalcProgrammer1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:11:29 2015 UTC,"Well if you have vsync on it shouldn't matter, as the cards will be paced off of the monitor refresh rate anyways.  As long as the clock speed is high enough to render a frame within 2 frame times, the frame will be ready when it is ready to be flipped to the monitor."
pcgaming,3dd85u,pb7280,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:44:33 2015 UTC,"Unless you're rendering slower than your monitor's refresh rate, in which case one could be rendering at a speed (example, exactly the refresh time) and the other could be a bit slower (say 1ms slower than refresh time), then you'd have one pushing a frame at the refresh rate and the other still rendering after the refresh is done.   At least that's how I'd imagine it works. I'm interested now, definitely will do some tests on microstutter when my second card is back from RMA!"
pcgaming,3dd85u,CalcProgrammer1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:43:16 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, AFR works by introducing a one frame delay.  Normally you would have the game request a frame, the GPU render it, and then the GPU flip it in time for the sync.  If the frame isn't ready by the deadline it delays one sync period and syncs on the second.  If this is continuous, every other sync is stale resulting in 30fps instead of 60.  With AFR, assuming equal GPUs, the GPU is given a frame while the other GPU is halfway through its frame.  I'm not sure if it's always 50/50 or whether it only uses one GPU as long as frames are meeting deadlines and starts using AFR when a sync is missed.  You have the added delay of copying the rendered frame from the secondary card into the primary card's output buffer which does reduce effective performance.  I have been watching GPU temps while gaming and I think it may try to use only one GPU if load is light as my secondary GPU seems to stay relatively cool and unused during lighter games."
pcgaming,3dd85u,pb7280,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:45:16 2015 UTC,"Hmm you're probably right, I'm pretty new to the whole AFR only having my first CrossFire setup for a month. About the one card staying cool, it seems in the CCC if I select the standard option they both get hot, but the optimized option allows one to stay cool under lighter games, it may use some of the technology you were talking about. That being said, I think if both cards are being pushed to their limits then you'd get microstutter unless the more powerful one were held back (e.g. With the frame pacing option in CCC). Unfortunately I have no proof until 10-20 business days when I get my card back! I have run the two at different clocks before (they have different stock clocks) and noticed little microstutter, but my first card can reach pretty high overclocks so I'll see how that changes things."
pcgaming,3dd85u,CalcProgrammer1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:58:19 2015 UTC,"I've noticed microstutter on two identical cards, the driver has pacing issues with some games.  I've found that forcing a hard FPS cap of 60 fixes it (even if vsync is on).  RadeonPro can do this.  Seems to affect DX9 programs mostly.  Then I also have noticed some games mostly work fine even when my top card overheats and downclocks while the bottom card stays pegged at 100% usage and clocks.  Going to water cool them to fix this."

Then it was because I wanted a graphics card around this time last month and Fury was not going to be around in the UK for a long time. And the price is similar if not 980 ti is actually cheaper.

pcgaming,3dd85u,abram730,6,Wed Jul 15 17:37:02 2015 UTC,"Nope, the better card will never down-clock to match the other card regardless of directx or OpenGL."
pcgaming,3dd85u,YellowCBR,0,Wed Jul 15 22:29:45 2015 UTC,Nvidia throttles the faster card with SLI.  I think SLI will be replaced by NVlink though. I'm speculating.
pcgaming,3dd85u,daviejambo,-5,Wed Jul 15 22:40:05 2015 UTC,It's still suggested you throttle it so you're frame pacing is even.
pcgaming,3dd85u,onionjuice,-20,Sun Jul 19 12:26:28 2015 UTC,Yes it would operate at the 290 cards clock speed and would be limited to 4gb Vram
pcgaming,3dd85u,daviejambo,11,Wed Jul 15 14:27:38 2015 UTC,no that's not how crossfire works. Both cards will operate at their normal frequencies.
pcgaming,3dd85u,Churchy89,-23,Wed Jul 15 12:25:44 2015 UTC,Eh no they will both operate at whatever the lowest clocked card is.
pcgaming,3dd85u,daviejambo,12,Wed Jul 15 13:57:32 2015 UTC,That used to be the case but it was changed a while back so that both cards are able to run at their maximum frequencies.
pcgaming,3dd85u,Churchy89,3,Wed Jul 15 13:58:43 2015 UTC,Really when was this ? I've always just used the exact same card as I was never sure   Wonder if you could use a 290x and a 390x and use the extra memory on the 390x
pcgaming,3dd85u,ezone2kil,3,Wed Jul 15 14:05:55 2015 UTC,"Not sure when exactly but it's been that way for a while and I've seen it first hand. As for VRAM, both cards need to have access to exactly the same information so you will always be limited to the card with the least amount. However, I believe that DX12 will allow the VRAM from all of the Xfire/SLI cards in your system to be pooled together but it will be down to each individual games programmers to utilize it in this way."
pcgaming,3dd85u,bizude,3,Wed Jul 15 14:09:38 2015 UTC,Damn that means there's finally a good justification for quad crossfire.  I hope DX12 will bring a much needed boost to pc gaming.
pcgaming,3dd85u,Kohvwezd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:24:40 2015 UTC,IIRC the 6000 series.   AMD has confirmed that the fastest card will not slow itself down.   https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/39g59k/gpu_xfx_double_dissipation_radeon_r9_290x_4gb_270/cs3k3hz?context=3

pcgaming,3dd85u,Kohvwezd,6,Wed Jul 15 18:30:39 2015 UTC,Because the stock levels of the 290 will run out in a few months and this will be useful when that happens.

pcgaming,3dd85u,SarcasticGamer,-7,Wed Jul 15 13:30:37 2015 UTC,Crossfire is not worth it (nor is SLI) if you ask me but yes that would be the sensible way to crossfire them
pcgaming,3dd85u,daviejambo,4,Wed Jul 15 13:32:46 2015 UTC,If you get two cards for cheap then it is. I got two 290x cards and am very happy with crossfire.
pcgaming,3dd85u,cryp7,0,Wed Jul 15 12:31:44 2015 UTC,"better with one single card .. I had crossfire 7970s , loved it but if you are playing games on release (as I do) it's not the best. That and it was loud and hungry"
pcgaming,3dd85u,daviejambo,5,Wed Jul 15 13:31:14 2015 UTC,What are you going to get that's faster than a 2x290x setup? A 295x2 is pretty much just that.
pcgaming,3dd85u,AMischievousBadger,-1,Wed Jul 15 13:51:18 2015 UTC,I'd rather have a single card that's slower than two cards in crossfire even if it was slower. If a game needs crossfired 290x's to run at a decent framerate it means there is something wrong with the game
pcgaming,3dd85u,cryp7,4,Wed Jul 15 14:06:42 2015 UTC,"One 290x won't handle 2160p at 60fps without drastically lowering settings, but I do agree with one single card that's slower vs dual card. After switching from a 295x2 to a 980 Ti, there's definitely benefits to having one strong single card."
pcgaming,3dd85u,CalcProgrammer1,3,Wed Jul 15 14:11:28 2015 UTC,"What individual card can run a game at 144 FPS with high settings for people with 144 Hz monitors? Or run every game with maxed out settings at 1440p60 or 4k? Sure, for 1080p60, I would agree with you. But there are definite use cases for Xfire/SLI."
pcgaming,3dd85u,ezone2kil,2,Wed Jul 15 14:16:48 2015 UTC,"Unless you play at 4K or multi-monitor 1080p/1440p setups, then it's expected for games to need that kind of power to get 60fps.  Getting a second 290X made a big difference at 4K."
pcgaming,3dd85u,Bloke_Named_Bob,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:16:52 2015 UTC,"You need crossfire for eyefinity setups,  4k or VSR."
pcgaming,3dd85u,Arknell,3,Wed Jul 15 14:17:46 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way. You can buy a 390X and Crossfire it with your existing 290X. When a new game comes out, before it has well made Crossfire drivers, you can run it off just the 390X alone and get solid performance. When AMD release new drivers you can run both cards (Which will likely perform like dual 290X's, still plenty more horsepower than a single 390X) and turn up the eye candy even more.   Sure it's not a huge selling point, but it's a great convenience for the people who do want to take advantage of the option."

pcgaming,3dd85u,thepulloutmethod,0,Wed Jul 15 14:22:35 2015 UTC,"It's not like the setup is prevented for no reason. Asymmetrical Crossfire has never been that great. You are pretty much limited to the power of the slower card as the faster one can't fully use its GPU. Frame times aren't that great, especially non XDMA cards."
pcgaming,3dd85u,JonF1,8,Wed Jul 15 16:07:52 2015 UTC,Supposedly you're no longer throttled to the slower card on crossfire. Both cards will function at normal frequency. Some other commenter ITT is talking about it.
pcgaming,3dd85u,kawifcknsaki,2,Wed Jul 15 15:33:26 2015 UTC,I must be referring to the older way it was done. If they figured out how to make it work without awful frame times that's really good on AMD.
pcgaming,3dd85u,CFGX,-6,Wed Jul 15 16:27:59 2015 UTC,"But why would you upgrade then in the first place?  If you have a 290X 4GB model and crossfire it with a 390X 8GB model, you basically lose the 100-200 dollar performance premium you paid for the 390x.  Why not just buy another 290X?"
pcgaming,3dd85u,CalcProgrammer1,11,Wed Jul 15 16:45:31 2015 UTC,"A 390X + 290X is going to be more powerful than 2x 290X because Crossifre doesn't downclock the stronger card As with all generations, eventually the 290X will be harder to find and possibly even more expensive than the 390X when stocks dwindle. Eventually it will make more sense to buy the 390X."
pcgaming,3dd85u,Halon5,2,Wed Jul 15 14:24:26 2015 UTC,"It won't downclock but it will limit VRAM.  Since VRAM is synced between the two cards only the lowest common amount is used.  Plus, since CF mostly uses an alternate-frame rendering method the cards are sharing the load 50/50 so the clock difference probably won't boost performance much (as 50% of your frames render quicker but 50% are still slower).  If they used some other form of shared rendering (split-frame, tiling, etc) then uneven cards could better distribute the load."
pcgaming,3dd85u,daviejambo,2,Wed Jul 15 14:28:03 2015 UTC,"You are completely correct with current DirectX capability, however DX12 will allow for VRAM stacking and different types of rendering for 2/3/4 GPU's so it will be worthwhile for DX12 games when they arrive."
pcgaming,3dd85u,abram730,11,Wed Jul 15 15:21:33 2015 UTC,"You could probably do it with a 980ti and a titan as they are the same chip too , if Nvidia allowed it of course"
pcgaming,3dd85u,nanogenesis,0,Wed Jul 15 15:59:29 2015 UTC,"""It just works"" has consequences.  That is nothing they haven't tested works, until they test it. Almost every game works with gamestream, but not according to Nvidia."
pcgaming,3dd85u,daviejambo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:09:38 2015 UTC,"There are old generations of cards which share same arch which should be possible to run in SLI, once again only if nvidia allowed it.

pcgaming,3dejv1,Leknasant,0,Thu Jul 16 00:59:37 2015 UTC,And I love how people are fighting people who have actually TESTED it and run into problems and had to figure them out.  I had problems with AMD GPU drivers and VSync being mysteriously forced on in full screen games (Windows DVR had to be disabled).  There's tons of different hardware out there all of which potentially can run into problems and if you're not good with computers you don't want to be first in line to try to solve them. Wait until others solve them and you can just google the problems.   FPS still isn't better in every game either. GTA 5 for me got a huge boost in the city areas but GPU stops doing any work at all almost outside cities and FPS takes a major hit to the point of being unplayable. Windows 10 is NOT FINISHED yet and you might as well play it safe and make the move when you can be sure you're actually going to benefit from it.
pcgaming,3dejv1,adulthitter,11,Thu Jul 16 01:04:12 2015 UTC,I had problems with AMD GPU drivers   Think I figured out your problem. Sounds like your drivers weren't the right ones for W10.
pcgaming,3dejv1,jpfarre,-8,Thu Jul 16 03:27:56 2015 UTC,They were the right ones. W10 just didn't properly delete the old ones when updating from 8.1 and I had to manually delete the old ones.

This isn't the same as other OS releases because there have never been so many active so widely at one time.  XP (with later SP's) was Godlike, it made sense not to upgrade to Vista, and then even Windows 7 right away because there were kinks to work out.

Are people struggling to run websites at decent framerates? Gotta load up the webpage 0.08 seconds faster? I don't get it. The vast majority of Chrome and Firefox users do not give a shit about plugin support, perhaps, I'll give you that, but the vast majority of those users are also happy with their browser and most likely won't bother with Edge until there's something Edge is offering that the other browsers aren't, and right now that's absolutely not the case. What are the chances most people will forgo all of their bookmarks, settings, cookies, and plugins for a minor performance boost and less features?    I want you to go a week only using Edge and tell me you don't miss Adblock, haha!

TF2 is what I'm thinking of specifically, but that game is so unravelled these days that your graphics card is basically irrelevant. Doesn't help that Valve thinks it's okay to just keep spamming particle effects too.  It runs on either dx8.1 or 9 if that information helps."
pcgaming,3dejv1,Donners22,10,Wed Jul 15 20:01:18 2015 UTC,"I mean if you're having trouble running TF2 I would think that's less to do with the game, no? That game can run on a potato."
pcgaming,3dejv1,brianostorm,6,Wed Jul 15 20:07:25 2015 UTC,"No, it can't. TF2 is very CPU heavy, especially when a big firefight goes down. Valve really need to port it to Source 2. It desperately needs it. Source 1 has lousy multithread support."

pcgaming,3dejv1,ApathyPyramid,2,Thu Jul 16 09:55:58 2015 UTC,Occasional drops to 30 is unacceptable for TF2. It should never drop below 60fps.

It's true that you can literally run it on outdated integrated graphics cards, but your CPU needs to be pretty powerful to get a decent framerate.  Valve makes the performance worse with every patch and has been doing so for years and years."
pcgaming,3dejv1,ApathyPyramid,5,Wed Jul 15 20:08:37 2015 UTC,I mean what do you consider pretty powerful? I have an fx-6100 and the game runs at around 150-200 fps.
pcgaming,3dejv1,thej00ninja,8,Wed Jul 15 20:13:25 2015 UTC,"I can get 600... in spawn. The game runs fine until you actually get around other people. Then it'll plummet to 40 or less. If they're overhealed or wearing unusuals or whatever else, it's even worse.  It's not about the max fps or even the average. It's about the lows being unacceptably bad, especially for a game that's seven fucking years old that looks the way it does."

pcgaming,3dejv1,Sarcastinator,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:18:13 2015 UTC,"Nah. I actually play competitive formats almost entirely these days. Prec records demos automatically, which definitely isn't good for fps, but isn't the bottleneck. Apart from that, I've got every fps config and particle reducer I could get my hands on. I used to get 300+ constantly in this game with no configs or anything along those lines in pub servers, which are much more demanding. The performance really has gone down the toilet."

The only issues i ran into:   Initial Install - When i first installed Windows 10, my laptop was incredibly laggy and slow, as in unusable-lag/slow. Everything I would click would take about 5 seconds to register, it would constantly freeze up, etc. For some reason after restarting a few times it just fixed itself and I've never had an issue since. As far as I know, there were no updates to improve it so I have no idea why that happened - i initially read it was an issue with Sandy Bridge intel CPU's (2nd gen) and thought I was screwed, but apparently not. Trackpad - would randomly freeze for about 1/10th of a second every 5ish seconds (which sounds minor, but it was incredibly annoying. That was an issue with Synaptics, the touchpad manufacturer, not updating drivers properly though and not Windows. They still haven't updated their W10 drivers, but in the RTM update you can just disable updates for it and use an older version, which works fine (the preview builds auto-update everything, whether you want it to or not)   Now I have to restore my laptop to W8 so I can get a legit upgrade to 10 though...

If you opt out of it you will have to activate that version with a Windows 10 key. Only way to take advantage of the free upgrade is to upgrade from a Windows 7 or 8 install, afaik.  At least that is what I read/heard.  It really has been a bit confusing with their constant changes.  Edit: Read through some posts about the newest RTM build. Apparently as long as you upgraded from a Windows 7/8 install previously you can opt-out of the Insider preview now and stay activated. But some people have reported problems and it seems to be people that used an iso to do a complete reinstall without upgrading."

pcgaming,3dey8r,HooMu,4,Wed Jul 15 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"I played a little Inquisitor right at the tail end of my Gamesworkshop career (I did not work their, I mean my playing career!). It was a really cool twist on the typical grand war game. It took a lot of inspiration from Mordheim (which is also getting its own video game). Its a more focused on CQC and took a lot more strategy (less I have bigger and better models than you).  I am really looking forward to this, the devs have a pretty good track record - never played the Van Helsing games but they look fun. I really like the idea about how the game really opens up after the story mode is done. Very ambitious but very exciting."

pcgaming,3dey8r,Delsana,7,Wed Jul 15 19:35:01 2015 UTC,IGN snuck their past games in at the end of the article. They made the RPG's - King Arthur and The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. I have never heard of King Arthur but I have heard very good things about the Adventures of Van Helsing. It is basically a Diablo II/Titan Quest clone - with some unique twists.
pcgaming,3dey8r,time4mzl,9,Wed Jul 15 20:06:07 2015 UTC,"King Arthur was a fantastic Total War-like game. In my opinion it was the better than any Total War game at the time (including Rome (BLASPHEMY)). I thoroughly enjoyed King Arthur. Just imagine Total War: Rome but with RPG elements not entirely unlike the Might and Magic series, dungeons and items and heroes and stuff.   ETA: I say dungeons, but I don't believe you actually entered dungeons. It's more that there were places on the map which drew your hero into like a story thing where you read a bunch of stuff and had to make choices and things."
pcgaming,3dey8r,BennyBonesOG,0,Wed Jul 15 20:21:14 2015 UTC,This doesn't give them a lot of.. quality precedent for high quality rpg's or their ability to make them. I'm anticipating an average game with issues. The Van Helsing game seems to be very niche according to sales metrics and reviews I'm finding and equally seems to have a subpar story experience. This doesn't bode well for me. Darn it I almost got excited.
pcgaming,3dey8r,Delsana,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:29:41 2015 UTC,"While I am also skeptical - I am also a huge GW fan and I have wanted a Inquisitor game since Dawn of War 1. They are an indy studio and they do release games a little buggy - BUT - they have a track record of supporting games after launch.   It may not be a groundbreaking game but I am confident it will be fun. They have a lot of quality lore to get behind - plus all the art and concept work is basically done for them. They have a good head start.   Plus, they are using their own - in house created engine. Meaning they know exactly how it works and how to squeeze the most out of it. GW has a ton of money to throw around so I am sure they are pushing to make a good game. They want that contract when it comes back around."

The thing is that these games aren't really graphically demanding at all, especially not South Park. There's even less of a reason for games (and I'm not saying they're bad games, I liked Stick of Truth a lot) that aren't graphically intensive to run at lower framerates."

If you go to a game's Steam page and see ""Locked at 30 fps, but you can edit this line in the .ini to set it to what you want"", or ""Locked at 30 FPS with no way to fix it without breaking the game"" pop up as a curator's review, wouldn't it help?

Balancing my tanks guard with my mages barrier, and my rogues crowd control.  Choosing who to smash into oblivion and who to hold.  Deciding if i want an off tank or a dps in my party, what kind of dps.  Speccing my party to take on different groups, lightning for armour, spirit for ghosts.  Managing my limited supply of potions for each stage of a dungeon crawl.  One of my fave battles was in swamps when undead surround you.  I essentially fought a retreat whilst waves of enemies slowly swamped me.  I had my tank holding them with their guard for as long as possible till it ran out and my mage would barrier him.  All the while my rogue was chucking caltrops behind her to slow the enemy giving me time to recharge, to cover her withdraw my mage cast a wall of ice.  All this time my archer (located on high ground at limit of her range) was picking off the weakest foes in conjunction with my rogue who would skip in and out of combat as croud control/minor dps.  It was so intense and the combat was on a knife edge throughout."

The crafting is excellent... the story line is ok (but ok is all i really expect from even the best rpg games to be honest, who can honestly say they have played a srpg and been completely blown away by the story? Mass effect 3 is probably the closest i have come to ever actually feeling any emotional response ironically)  But yeah, this game is boring on lower difficulties and i exclusively use the tactical paused mode with all automatic actions turned off (i do miss the programming you could do in the first one, and just sit back and watch your well oiled team kick ass, with the odd tweak here and there.)   I think the tactical mode is an absolute joy to use with the controller on the settee with a bag of popcorn and a brew.  Maybe im biased, maybe im an idiot who doesnt know shit about games, but i fucking love the game and rank it pretty highly.  I dont see how anyone could compare dragon age inq with witcher personally. Its like comparing company of heroes with battlefield four.

There's no strategy, no tactics, no worrying about positioning your party, barely any tailoring your abilities towards opponent weaknesses, etc. It boils down to 'Left click and hold'. Its stupidly easy to exploit as well, and you'll quickly outlevel everything in the game.   I'd say its perfectly playable on a KB+M though, outside of the strategic map. Its pretty damn obvious the strategic map was taped out without any for thought. You'll go into once, during the tutorial when your forced too. Then never again.

Granted, I don't think it's terrible either. Just nothing particularly exciting.  However, the storyline still has me hooked, and that's what I keep playing for. As usual Bioware flare, the characters have some amazing depth to them, and I genuinely liked most of them. (Viv can go fuck off, even as much as I enjoyed her banter with Bull.)  I actually think they did the player character fairly well, which is kind of new to them. Unlike Hawke, who was a very set-in-stone character, they really gave us a TON of room to make the character how we wanted it, and I think it worked well. And THANKFULLY, the dialog is actually clear on this one. I never ONCE selected a dialog prompt, just to be surprised by what was actually said. (Had that issue ever since Mass Effect, all the way up to DA2. This time they got it right.)  EDIT: Hey, blind downvotes, yay! So, sure, some of you guys may not have cared for the story and companions this time around. That's fine, that's your prerogative. But, I can tell you, that's absolutely the major selling point of the franchise at this point. I'm just pointing that out, that's all. I happened to like it quite a lot myself."

Which I find sad, because there are plenty of books which do.  Playing ME1-2 (just started ME3) after TW3, you can see the difference. None of this was due to technical leaps. Just decent writing.  Take the villain from ME1, and compare his dialog to The Crones. Just dialog, nothing else. He comes across as a shallow, insipid individual who really had no other purpose than to kill one character and then get slaughtered by Shepard."

Planescape: Torment is still the king in the writing department, and I bet it will stay there a long time.  Sadly not many people played it and I bet my ballsack that not one of the people that played Mass Effect/Dragon Age played it. Then they talk about how great the writing and the characters are.

pcgaming,3df031,finalgear14,3,Thu Jul 16 05:49:16 2015 UTC,The story was interesting enough for me but what killed it were the breaks between continuing the story. I'd have to level 4 times before I was high enough to continue and that meant going to the open world portions which were boring as fuck. I couldn't stand the mmo aspect of that game. The game didn't flow well because of that. I stopped playing around level 18 or something. I bought it from all the positive buzz and reviews and because I loved the first one.

pcgaming,3df031,Nose-Nuggets,5,Wed Jul 15 20:26:39 2015 UTC,Yeah they have. However they're usually lacking the boring as all hell aspect of grinding and needing to spend 5 minutes to kill a single trash mob that mmos have. None of biowares other games had combat take literal minutes on small parties of trash mobs. This was a shitty single player mmo in terms of combat so.

I enjoyed the main story but I did not like having to go to the open world because I wasn't high enough level to continue to the next part. It was too much of a chore to level up in the open, so I quit since the game became less of a game and more of a grind."
pcgaming,3df031,inspektor71,3,Thu Jul 16 02:55:03 2015 UTC,I'm with you - the combat is pretty terrible. I tried all of the classes and none of them really appealed to me. This is exacerbated by the 'clunkyness' of being trapped in animations.
pcgaming,3df031,finalgear14,2,Wed Jul 15 20:13:37 2015 UTC,"I felt the same. I finished it a few weeks ago. I blasted through the main storyline and ignored half of the characters since the gameplay wasn't interesting enough for me to 'stretch out' and to be honest, I felt half the characters felt really flat and uninteresting for a Bioware game. A small selection of characters were really good (I especially liked Dorian, Blackwall, Cassandra, and Varric in this one) but characters like Sera, Solas, Iron Bull, Cole, etc, just bored me and I didn't care two shits for them.   The game is very pretty, and the world design is phenomenal, but there's just no substance to back it up IMO. Skyrim earned the tag as 'wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle', but to me DA:I deserves that crown by a long way."

pcgaming,3df031,Red-Blue-,3,Thu Jul 16 12:53:16 2015 UTC,"If you're into fantasy RPGs, you really should get The Witcher 3 if you haven't already. The problems you listed with DA:I are some of TW3's strengths. The combat system is a lot better (although there are issues with lack of difficulty at high level because your character becomes very powerful). The sidequests are without a doubt the best in any RPG I've ever played. There are a lot of dialogue cutscenes (some are pretty long) but the script and voice acting are excellent. Very few fetch quests to be found. The characters you interact with are vastly more interesting. The visuals are better, the soundtrack is MUCH better."

I love completing every possible side quest before moving on.   Guess what happened when I completed the first area with town you come across? I became overpowered.  So basically, I was beating the shit out of Dragons left and right afterwards and the worst part was, the geniuses designing the game tell you that YOU WILL NOT GET XP FOR KILLING DRAGONS if they are few levels lower than you. Yeah, you are killing Dragons, and you don't gain XP. But killing a bandit few levels higher than a fucking DRAGON, gives you XP. Derp.  Anyways, game got boring. Never finished it, still have it installed, haven't touched it for ages since I just won't die.  Also, game has awful storyline and boring characters. That didn't help at all.  This whole game feels like they tried to copy Skyrim and ended up with same problems that fuckpile of a game suffers from."

Shit I remember Amazon had the PC game rated at a 2 out of 5 up until recently  yeah the game has been a buggy mess since release but the ""fanboys"" and review sites seem to glaze right over GAME BREAKING BUGS when they do reviews.  Honestly, when review sites were giving it 9/10, they couldn't have played more than an hour of the game. Bore city.  And the fanboys go ""but I didn't see ANY bugs!/It didn't happen to me! 10/10!""  There's a reason why the official bioware forums had 100+ page bug threads for 2 months after release  But somehow, the ""loyal fans"" of the series put on their rose colored glasses and will continue to hammer you with shouts of amazement about Bioware!!  I consider DA:I a ""single player MMO""... like playing World of Warcraft off-line and alone.  Heres Why:   Its simple and shallow game play (go to npc, kill/collect something, return to npc, repeat) Crappy fetch and kill quests you'd find in an MMO that have zero creativity A lot of ""content"" is just lines of text of shit-that-happened when you are using the WarBoard Combat its just button mashing 1-5 on your keyboard the entire game... yes even the final boss. You can probably go through the entire game without ever using the ""Tactical mode""   Not to mention the game tries wayy to hard to put homosexuality and bisexually ""out there"". They made sure there were way more gay romances than straight ones  Now its probably better bug-wise (I'd hope since its been months since release) but the deep content isn't there  I poured 60 hours into it when I finished the game and after everything, I said  ""meh"""

I actually have a gay professor and gay acquaintances. But I found the game was trying too hard to be a tumblr-feminist pleaser. That, however, is the least of its worries.  I think I'm gonna call it official quits on Dragon Age Inquisition. I installed the game, tried it out a bit, then uninstalled it. Then a few days later I saw IGNs review and Gamespots review and general praise. So I reinstalled it. I've followed this cycle about 4 times over the past month. When I see the gaming community love the game I think ""wow, that must be an amazing game. Why am I not having fun with it? Is something wrong with me?"" and then I come back and am just bored out of my mind and bored out of that godawful ""hold RT and watch"" combat system. I uninstall it.   That comparison to MMO was super accurate, good job. That's what this game: a single player MMO. So it has all the boring and uncreative bullshit MMOs do, but doesn't counterbalance that by having a persistent online world where you can make friends and communicate with other humans openly.   But now I realize I don't have to enjoy a game just because the community does, that I am my own person and my preferences are as such."
pcgaming,3df031,Commisar,6,Wed Jul 15 22:27:00 2015 UTC,"Games with good writing like Dragonfall or New Vegas or whatever else have gay characters whose homosexuality is one very small part of a complicated, fleshed out character. They exist, but they don't exist in huge numbers because homosexuals don't exist in huge numbers. They treat homosexual people as people.  Bioware treats homosexuals as a checkbox to hit. They see them as a means to an end. A shield against criticism (just look at ME3) and a way to get certain review sites to fawn over you. Their homosexual characters are defined entirely by their homosexuality, and make an effort to shove it in your face. And I'm not doing the whole ""gays can be gay in private!"" thing. By all means, kiss your bf/gf in public. I don't care. It's not gross. But I know a lot of gay people, and while they might talk about their gf/bf occasionally, they don't spend every fucking minute of the conversation going HEY BY THE WAY I'M FUCKING FLAMING. Because they're people, not checkboxes.  Fire Gaider. Fire Hepler. Fire fucking everyone at Bioware because they can't write for shit."

pcgaming,3df031,Skodd,7,Thu Jul 16 00:32:15 2015 UTC,I'm not doing that though. I've made the decision on my own observations from trying out the game.   Do you find it fun? If so please let me know what you do and what makes it fun. I'm keeping an open mind and am willing to reinstall the game whenever.
pcgaming,3df031,ferpecto,-2,Thu Jul 16 01:03:56 2015 UTC,"You get to explore a massive fantasy world that isn't GRIMDARK AND BLEAK like the Witcher's, or a carbon copy of D&D 3.5 edition/ Tolkien.  The companions are what make the game.  Interacting with them and seeing how they react to your decisions are great.  taking down dragons is fun, spec-ing out your class/ companion classes is fun.  Running around and finding cool lore items is nice. Bioware made this world from the ground up. CD Projet Red adapted a book series.  As for the combat, I too play on a 360 controller on PC. If you want the game to be harder, up the difficulty.    Sure, it isn't as tactical as some turn based game, but I don't care.  The game for me is greater than the sum of its parts.  Sure, the combat isn't perfect, the story is standard bioware ""good will win"", and the game does have filler quests.  however, those filler quests DO NOT NEED TO BE DONE to advance the story.  If you want a party based fantasy RPG with fairly simple combat, a cool world, good graphics, and memorable characters, go back to Dragon Age inquisition.  if you want a purely single player RPG that revels in how much the game world sucks (think polish Game of Thrones where you play a a non-important character), a fun single person combat system, and a good story RIGHT up until the last 15 minutes, go with the Witcher 3.  I own DA:I and the Witcher 3 and I love both."
pcgaming,3df031,Toomuchgamin,5,Thu Jul 16 03:50:06 2015 UTC,"I never said I want the game to be harder, I just said I want the combat to not feel like ""hold RT until the guys die"". Which is largely what it feels like, this would not usually be a problem but the game is driven by its combat. That'd what makes everything move forward. How can I make the combat not - boring?   Take exploration for example, something that should be fun in a game like this the way you said yourself. Exploring caves and mountains and finding cool treasure. You can't do that without coming across spiders and bandits and whatnot and killing them all is so goddamn boring and unfun. So you see now how the shitty combat seeps into other parts of the game and stinks up the overall experience?"

Because half of what you said is overblown drivel, and if you actually played the game, you should know that.  I'm not saying the game didn't have its flaws. It very much did. But I think you're blowing some aspects of it way out of proportion.  Also, why do people always complain about ""go there, kill that"" quests.

It felt like 100 hours of filler, but I really wanted to see it all. After a 6 month break I just went straight for the final boss ( no more stupid shards, boring side quests, disappointing companion quests ), just ended the game.  I honestly don't even recommend it. I know I got 100 hours of ""entertainment"" from the game but it seemed like a single player MMORPG. Insanely boring quests, uninteresting storyline, the characters were far below what I expect from a Bioware game.  Face it, the company is dead. You guys all know the 2 creators of Bioware left a few years ago, right? The company has gone downhill since then. DA2, ME3, DA:I have been utter shit IMO.

GTX 970 are US$320 in the US, if I buy it here it's US$450.  Different things have different increments but roughly everything is 40-70% more expensive and we have less variety. I save around 20-30% (very rarely) if I buy stuff outside and get it shipped but then what happens if it comes defective or brakes on travel?

pcgaming,3db294,YellowCBR,27,Wed Jul 15 06:37:39 2015 UTC,"I did a college paper on this.   Electronics were the main thing that did have good sales. Clothing, furniture, and small appliances were fake sales galore. These are items that already sell with relatively low profit margins compared to the raw material + shipping, except for luxury brands.   Electronics however are sold with massive profit margins compared to the raw materials, but they usually sell high because of the massive R&D budgets. But they can still afford to let electronics sell for very cheap. This is the same reason manufacturers can sell refurbished parts for insanely low, because they're still making a profit technically.  Also electronics go out of date, and retailers really need to get rid of that stock. Shoes? Not so much."
pcgaming,3db294,effse7en,3,Wed Jul 15 05:59:43 2015 UTC,"shoes don't go out of date   You're obviously a male.  Also TVs, game systems, computers, etc were the things we got the crappiest discount on when I worked at Best Buy. It was usually like $20 off a $500 TV, if that, because the profit margins are so low on them.  Worst Buy makes all their profit on cables and services, not the ""major electronics"". That $1000 100' monster HDMI cable? The employee price on that was like $120. Most of the mid range Monster cables that went for 50-100 bucks could be had for 15-30 on the employee discount. Insignia cables went for under $10 easily."
pcgaming,3db294,YellowCBR,3,Wed Jul 15 13:57:18 2015 UTC,"Its more the manufacturer that can make good sales happen. You're right the store themselves has a small profit margin.

Currys would get a manufacturer like JVC to renumber a product from say the JVC-123A, to the JVC-123S, apply a ridiculous markup to that product for a certain period of time, slash the price and call it a sale. Currys didnt have to price match during the inflated period because the product number was different.  Also the margin on the majority of major electronics is minimal, with exception of ""designer brands"" such as Apple / Dyson.

My concern is that it's not an IPS monitor, so you'll not be getting the highest tier of quality from the monitor.  Also, ensure you have the correct video ports on your graphics cards if you do get it: The monitor supports VGA and DVI-D inputs. I'd say this is a negative as these are quite old now, as i'd look for Displayport or HDMI personally.  From what i can tell, it's also a TN panel, which aren't considered great, and has a refresh rate of 60 Hz."

pcgaming,3db294,imail724,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:18:58 2015 UTC,"I don't have experience with anything over 60 Hz, so i can't say! I just added it so you'd know.   I personally use an Ultra-Wide 1080p monitor with my old TN-60 Hz monitor as a second monitor. There's nothing really wrong with it for me, but i like to draw, so IPS was my main concern.  Increasing refresh rate just means that your monitor can refresh at the same rate as the frames are pushed out, making the image smoother. It's meant to be good, but it's wasted if you don't have the capability to push more than 60 fps, iirc."

Another frustration I have that many people don't even talk about are all the awful 730p/30fps cutscenes in games (mostly ones from 2012 and earlier.) I absolutely hated those blurry, terrible videos. It's amazing that the developer wouldn't think to include the original high quality videos, since I'd imagine they created them first and then compressed them.  Back in the late 90s, cutscenes used to look infinitely better than gameplay. Nowadays, gameplay looks infinitely better than cutscenes."

pcgaming,3de4uy,AoyagiAichou,5,Fri Jul 17 06:54:34 2015 UTC,"I mean the hardware review is skeptical about AMD's pricing strategy, but it nevertheless bears repetition that the 390X has gotten far too little attention and it is IMHO a great card priced at a highly competitive price.   The Fury X looks far too pricey by comparison, even the Fury non-X. The 980 Ti costs a lot more than the 980 but it also has a significant performance delta to justify it."

I wouldn't pay any attention to their conclusion as they are very biased towards Nvidia. I don't think many are aware as to how close in performance the 390X is to the 980. Spoiler: Its faster in several games. Once you up the resolution its just starts winning more."
pcgaming,3de4uy,opeth10657,3,Wed Jul 15 20:13:05 2015 UTC,"but if you look at their performance summary, the 980 is ahead at all resolutions except 4k, and then it's only 1% off the 390x.    The problem with only winning at 4k is that barely anyone has 4k screens, and the cards aren't really powerful enough by themselves to run 4k anyway.  Add to that the fact that the 980/980ti are both monster OCers and there is less reason to go for the 390x vs the 980"
pcgaming,3de4uy,Hat-trickBlunt,3,Thu Jul 16 03:33:06 2015 UTC,If your playing at 4k you can probably afford a 980ti or Fury/X.

pcgaming,3de4uy,animeman59,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:16:09 2015 UTC,"Nonsense. Prior to going SLI my single 980ti was easily achieving 50-60 fps on most games, maxed out (except TW3). And this is at True 4K, 4096x2160."
pcgaming,3de4uy,QuintessentialNerd,9,Sat Jul 18 17:40:10 2015 UTC,The Fury and Fury X are overpriced. That's not likely to change because they are not making a lot of them. This is one reason why 980/980ti's are still flying off the shelves.
pcgaming,3de4uy,RagingCain,3,Wed Jul 15 15:55:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I was very excited for the Fury X, but in the end price to performance is the most important benchmark.  For $650, I went with the 980 Ti.  I've been building PCs for a long time now, so still going with an air-cooled card is nothing new.  People argue that I'm forgoing the built-in rad on the Fury X, but I argue back saying that most PC gamers have been playing on air-cooled cards for a long time now.  So what's the difference with still using those same types of cards?  We've also been playing with power hungry, hot, and loud video cards for a long time, so what am I exactly sacrificing with not going for the radiator that I haven't experienced already?  All of my builds call for sufficient airflow anyway to alleviate this.  So if I'm still getting 70 - 80 degrees on my video card, then it's no different from my other cards in the past.  This is why I find the 390 series, Fury, and Fury Nano to be more interesting than the Fury X.  They're pretty much traditional cards with oodles of performance at good price ranges (not sure about the Nano yet).  I'd argue that the 390X is an excellent deal for the performance and price you get."
pcgaming,3de4uy,Randomness6894,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:37:23 2015 UTC,I would've loved to get the 390 for my build but in europe both cards are overpriced VS nvidia offerings. Itx 970 it is. Hopefully the next generation of AMD cards will be good enough to induce me to resell this build for an upgrade.
pcgaming,3de4uy,RagingCain,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:58:29 2015 UTC,"The Strix and MSI Gamer are great cards, but the R9 390X is basically a rebadged R9 290X 8GB.    While the 290x can be found cheaper... and also with non-reference coolers."
pcgaming,3de4uy,surg3on,2,Wed Jul 15 21:12:03 2015 UTC,"It is a refresh not a rebrand. A rebrand is the same thing, new name. A refresh is the same card with various tweaks and changes to enhance performance on the same architecture."
pcgaming,3de4uy,RagingCain,2,Thu Jul 16 02:35:18 2015 UTC,"Conclusion on [H]   AMD Radeon R9 Fury compares to the AMD Radeon R9 390X, which is a ""re-brand"" or ""refresh"" of the Radeon R9 290X; none of which is new technology at all.    All the benefits of a mature 28nm process apply equally to a R9 290X 8GB card, that was released after the original R9 290X.  They are processed and manufactured the same way from the same fabrication and non-reference cards have the equal power, temperature, and noise benefits.  They are essentially the same thing, where you can save anywhere from 40 to 60$ on by purchasing the older naming scheme.  You guys can down vote me all you want, I am just trying to save you money. Any discernible difference is generally from 4K resolution and the extra memory frequencies from the factory overclock. Overclocking a non-reference R9 290X is quite easy and the majority of owners can hit those frequencies."
pcgaming,3de4uy,hdshatter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:43:36 2015 UTC,"Strange , other sites have pointed out the 390 handles Hairworks better. pointing to some admittedly tiny tweaks to the base 290X"
pcgaming,3de4uy,Randomness6894,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:33:19 2015 UTC,"As /u/HDShatter stated, when using the same driver branch, they perform the same. Especially if the R9 290X has matching frequencies which honestly and truly can be done.  Hairworks performance was directly tied to AMD tessellation. If I recall correctly the ""AMD Optimized"" tessellation level for the game profile Witcher 3 (which is what I think you are referring to) has been set to 16x (internally). Leaving tessellation to default levels in AMD driver defaults the tessellation performance to 16x when running Witcher 3.  Then top that off with Witcher 3 patches.  So an end-user or even reviewer would suddenly see an increase in Witcher 3 Hairworks performance without making any driver changes.  It's not transparent to the end user, but after judging the quality of the of 16x and 64x for myself, I can respect AMDs decision."

pcgaming,3de4uy,gtavshit,2,Thu Jul 16 17:20:36 2015 UTC,"I have been a member for years of HardOCP, that's statistically not true. I don't know why that's suddenly being ""brought up"" as a thing now.  Kyle Bennett (Editor-in-Chief of HardOCP) has numerous personal relationships with AMD personnel, including board members. An example of him at AMD's 30 Years of Gaming Event interviewed by Richard Huddy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Uzhf9lcflg  Even as far back as nearly ten years ago, they were fairly shunned by communities for their notoriously ATI / AMD biased articles: http://forums.anandtech.com/showthread.php?t=1334016  HardOCP also used to do Eyefinity tech demonstrations.  Basically, many people have called in to question HardOCPs relationships with AMD for over a decade.  Still though, a good hardware review site is going to recommend different brands at different times. If currently they recommend nVidia over AMD, that's not necessarily a bias towards nVidia. I myself see very little reason to recommend a Fury X over a GTX 980 Ti, especially now the 980 Ti had a small price drop.  The Fury on the other hand is priced much more reasonably for the performance.  I personally do not purchase cut down cards though... so I am a little stuck this generation."

pcgaming,3ddlpy,AnIndianNerd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:05:18 2015 UTC,"Overclocks don't linearly scale the performance of a CPU.  Increasing a CPU overclock 100%, doesn't guarantee it's performance is 100% higher for example.  However, an overclock should decrease the time to complete the benchmark. So if increasing the frequency 400 MHz increased the overall performance of you CPU by 10%, the time elapsed should decrease by 10% on an average data of 3-5 runs.

There used to be a lot of other companies making hockey games but that stopped for whateveer reason, as you can see here   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ice_hockey_video_games  Could just be that 2k stopped making hockey games to focus on making a new engine/innovating/something else and they will return to the market at some point but I personally think they just folded the project.

With the NHL series, 2K threw in the towel because of how much better the NHL series was in the 360/PS3 era.  Originally they were going to take a year off from next-gen after NHL 2k10 and build a brand new game from the ground-up for NHL 2k12 (which is why 2k11 was mostly mobile and Nintendo based), but that was quietly cancelled.  Perhaps that's a good thing too, because NHL 12 was considered one of the best titles in that generation."

Curling is a more popular sport than baseball worldwide (more or less). American football is just that, American football. Like MMA stuff it's growing outside of America though, and a lot of people like to watch the Super Bowl since it's a spectacle. But the NFL on its own is very uninteresting internationally.   Basketball, on the other hand, is played in just about every country in the world. Now most people don't watch the NBA but almost everyone knows a handful of NBA names and teams from the time they played as kids. You pretended you were Michael Jordan or Scottie Pippen. So even though you may outgrow the NBA there is still a basic appeal rooted partly in the game but partly in  your own personal history.   ETA: And quite frankly, everything I've heard about NBA 2k15 or whatever the latest one is called is positive.

One of MMAs and UFCs largest event recently, ufc 189 was a big fucking deal for the UFC and the sport in general. However it still doesn't touch a lot of boxing events.

pcgaming,3ddsth,Orwan,3,Wed Jul 15 17:50:31 2015 UTC,"NBA and professional basketball leagues in general are far more popular than professional MMA organizations.   Globally, soccer/football and basketball are the largest organized professional sports. Furthermore, PC gaming is huge on an international level, which is why the FIFA and NBA 2k franchises always have large releases on the PC platform.   I'm an exclusive PC gamer and it does frustrate me that I cannot acquire licensed sports games that were made recently, it does make sense financially and marketing-wise that devs are going to focus on the profitable products through the proper distribution channels.   That said, you may see an unlicensed MMA game come out at some point in the future from an indie dev or something, so there is always hope."

pcgaming,3dek1a,vainsilver,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:57:38 2015 UTC,"I bought a key from what I assume is a provider very similar to the one you're looking at.  Played and beat the game last weekend and while it's true that out of the box the performance was jaw-droppingly bad it only took me about half an hour to fiddle with it and get it to a playable state.  Just google Arkham Knight optimization guides, there's one in particular on Steam which you'll probably find that I used and it pretty much solved all the problems I was having.    With an i5-4670k and a 780 I was able to get it mostly in the 60 fps range, I don't recall my exact settings as I messed with them a lot but most if not all of them were on high.  I didn't use any of the special physx stuff because I couldn't tell any difference with any except for the smoke particles, and the smoke caused my fps to tank anyways.  It was definitely pretty clear to me that the Batmobile is the biggest drain on fps but mine would only dip to 40-45 at the lowest (typically when there were a ton of enemies on screen, which happens a few times throughout the game) which I found to be perfectly playable; in normal driving/puzzle/etc. sequences it generally wouldn't go that low (closer to 50-55).  I don't know if I was a fringe case or something, I don't doubt at all that others haven't been as lucky in their optimization efforts but like I said I didn't really have any major problems.  The game was pretty fun, I suppose I'm biased because I really loved Asylum and City, and while I don't think Knight was quite on par with those it was still an entertaining game and a decent ending to the trilogy.  I will say, however, since you're looking at the premium edition, that the Harley Quinn DLC is perhaps the most half-assed, uninspired pieces of trash I've ever played.  That may sound like a rather scathing impression but after playing that shit I have to believe it was thrown together in 10 minutes by an intern just so they could advertise it as a premium edition bonus.  With the combination of how terribly optimized the base game is and the steaming hot garbage that is the Harley DLC I'm really disappointed in Rocksteady, and I doubt I'll ever pay full price for a WB game again (not that I paid full price for AK, of course)."
pcgaming,3dek1a,The-Mars-Travolta,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:49:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, your comment was very helpful. I will definitely see if I can find one of those optimization guides. I loved Asylum and City too and even really liked Origins (from my understanding one of the few) so I'm willing to risk it to buy the game. However, I'm on the fence whether to get the premium edition or not. I don't think I'll ever get the season pass for a lower price but even for that discounted price I'm not sure if it's worth it, especially since the dlc won't be released for who knows when."
pcgaming,3dek1a,Nathorus86,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:00:38 2015 UTC,"No problem.  I actually played and enjoyed Origins as well but forgot to mention it (it's also my least favorite in the series, though that's probably not surprising).  I enjoyed Arkham Knight more than Origins if only because Origins had some really annoying bugs when I played it, but I think Origins did a few things right and Arkham Knight fortunately improves on or at least includes most of those new mechanics.  That's a tough one on the premium edition.  If I hadn't tried the Harley DLC on a whim I probably would have recommended you buy it because I've had a fairly good time with the other games' various DLCs.  However, the Harley stuff was legitimately so bad that I'm very hesitant to recommend the premium edition as a result.  If I were you I'd look into the Batgirl DLC they just released and see what the feedback is on that.  If it's generally positive then it may be that the Harley DLC really was just a fringe case of a tacked-on pre-order bonus.  If the Batgirl stuff isn't be received well either then I'd probably just go with the standard edition because I'd have an extremely grim outlook of the future DLCs if that were the case."
pcgaming,3dek1a,Wint3riscoming,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:13:48 2015 UTC,Good advice! I read some opinions on the new DLC and most people weren't really positive about it. So I'll go with the base game and if any spectacular DLC pops up I can always buy it separately. Thanks again.  Ps. It seems I got the Harley DLC as a bonus anyway so I can see how bad it is for myself :P
pcgaming,3dek1a,MonsuirJenkins,0,Wed Jul 15 20:31:42 2015 UTC,I found the framerate drops lower than 30fps more often in the Batmobile when you have your framerate unlocked from the original 30fps limit. When it's locked to 30fps it's completely playable.
pcgaming,3dek1a,Wint3riscoming,4,Thu Jul 16 01:13:26 2015 UTC,"I'd say go for the cheap key while it's available, but don't play the game yet. For all the praise it's gotten for consoles, it has the potential to be even better on a good PC once they fix it.   It's true that it performs better on 900 series nvidias, but that's still not to say that it performs well. It's a mess."
pcgaming,3dek1a,MonsuirJenkins,2,Wed Jul 15 18:07:20 2015 UTC,It's €20 for the basic game and €35 for the premium edition (I was thinking of getting the premium) so I think it's a pretty solid deal.

I haven't played BF too much but it looks that the games share the core parts of gameplay so it would make sense to update the game, assets, may be add new game modes etc etc.   If they need new campaign then they can make it as dlc that adds it as the button in main menu."
pcgaming,3dajk2,amdc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:35:49 2015 UTC,"why won't they just update the game over and over and keep playerbase together?   Because they probably can't get away with charging $60 for an update so they need to make a ""new"" game."

pcgaming,3dajk2,Incrediblebulk92,3,Wed Jul 15 14:33:53 2015 UTC,"But they could release $20 - $30 expansions every few months... the development and marketing cost would be far lower, so the profit probably would be quite good. and it would free up developers to work on more games which in turn would generate even more income."

pcgaming,3dajk2,Openworldgamer47,10,Wed Jul 15 01:43:27 2015 UTC,"Battlefield 2 was my first love.  Battlefield 2142 the next step in the relationship.  Bad Company 2 came along and taught me it's ok to Battlefield on a console with some buddies (looking at you, Vietnam DLC...) but BF3 kind of started to burn me out.  Not in a too much of a good thing, type of way.  I started to wish BF3 could be BF2 but shinier.  Battlefield 4?  I hated it during the launch, tolerated it after patch upon patch.  Then I blinked and Hardline was out.  I'm not sure what they can release to get my interest back.  Any feels that are similar?"

Battlefield 4 ended up being ok with all the patching afterwords but slowly I lost interest. I was in the alpha thing after E3 where BF Hardline was announced and despised it. Then a few months later I played it on PC before launch in the beta and basically gave up on the Battlefield franchise. Are Battlefield 2 and 2142s servers still up?"

pcgaming,3dajk2,Arligan,5,Wed Jul 15 00:18:39 2015 UTC,Why not? SWTOR really isn't F2P. Most people in the community including myself call it a trail not F2P.
pcgaming,3dajk2,The_Web_Doctor,2,Wed Jul 15 00:38:53 2015 UTC,"I do, ea should take a few lesson from soe on how to do f2p. The problem with swtor is that ea restricts the ability to play the game. Good f2p let users have the same play experience as the sub players."
pcgaming,3dajk2,AgressiveTop,2,Wed Jul 15 13:15:36 2015 UTC,"Yeaaa, it's pretty bad. Not necessarily pay to win in the same sense but they put a ton of stuff up under a pay wall more or less forcing you to subscribe if you want to enjoy the 'real' game."

pcgaming,3dajk2,CocoPopsOnFire,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:26:39 2015 UTC,"I paid for SWTOR because I did enjoy it quite a lot on release (those class stories were outstanding imo) and at some point last year I returned to the game for maybe a month.  One of the most ridiculous paywall-ed features in my opinion is that you have to pay in order to be able to use additional action bars.  I don't know if that restriction has changed in the interim but I sincerely hope it has because that just seemed absolutely outrageous to me.  I always felt that a good F2P game offers the most basic experience that it reasonably can for free, and paying grants you access to a lot of quality of life type features, and probably some restrictions on what game modes you can play in PvP and/or what endgame content you can access (if any) in PvE.  Taking away action bars just seemed like a really underhanded, almost snarky movie.  Like, ""Fine, if you don't want to pay us to play you don't have to.  We just won't let you use more than ten abilities at a time, so take that!""  Particularly annoying considering SWTOR doesn't have auto-attack so most of the classes have a lot of short CD abilities which will take up most of the space on the main action bar.    Like I said, since I paid for it at launch, I was considered a ""premium"" F2Player or something along those lines so I got the additional action bars.  It just seemed like a very blatant attempt to make F2P less appealing, which is the opposite of what F2P devs should be trying to do - making the paid features more appealing than F2P."
pcgaming,3dajk2,partisparti,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:30:18 2015 UTC,Nope the additional action bars are still behind the paywall (iirc even preferred players don't have access to them)

I never really played a lot of different MMOs and I rarely play them at all these days but post-launch SWTOR was one of the only games that provided me with an experience that was somewhat comparable to those very first days of WoW, when I was a naive child unknowingly signing away the next ~3 years of my life."

pcgaming,3dajk2,AbsurdTech,4,Tue Jul 14 23:37:11 2015 UTC,"I mean, that was the point of P4F. I believe it's original intention was to basically re-release BF2 on the Frostbite engine. I never played it past beta, but the beta was actually pretty fun...but not enough fun to tear me away from the actual BF titles."
pcgaming,3dajk2,HaroldSax,4,Wed Jul 15 00:38:47 2015 UTC,"I think P4F was still Refractor 2 instead of Frostbite. You can tell with screenshots.  Also it's a good way to lure children with disposable income. Shitty requirements, free game, shooty shooty, from a gaming standpoint it's the worst of the worst but from a business perspective it's the next best thing since sliced bread."

pcgaming,3dajk2,rapidshot20,4,Wed Jul 15 17:19:57 2015 UTC,"Contrary to the Pay-2-Win model that EA enacted in these three games I had my good share of fun with Battlefield Heroes. I'm quite thankful for sharing my experiences with the game, as it did introduce me into PC gaming. I've mostly been a console gamer and occasionally play flash games on Miniclips.com, Armorgames.com, and Arcadeprehacks.com. My friend introduced me to BFH and I quickly fell in love with the game. Crazy as it sounds, I've never fully experienced a multiplayer with others on an open map. Closest thing to that was playing one or two games of Star Wars: Battlefront 2 through Ethernet cable, and when I jumped into BFH it quickly became part of my daily schedule.  Back then I didn't understand how bad the Pay-2-Win concept was and just dropped at least $100 on it trying to be the best. There were several hackers as well but overall I'm happy with my experience.  Best moment I ever had was probably a full game of a full team of Gunners vs. Soldiers on Riverside Rush. Hardest match ever since they just used that blasting force field to separate our group, and those heals were overwhelming."

The name stems from a play on the Watergate scandal, in which a politician was caught trying to cover up more than a few questionable acts. Gamergate is more about gaming journalism, and the obvious corruption running rampant in review sites such as Kotaku, Rock Paper Shotgun and various other sites. Unfortunately, since the journalists hold a lot of the power, various articles were released across these websites shaming supporters of Gamergate. Some of it was rightfully so, with many supporters of Gamergate attacking anyone that made fun of the cause. However, these posts showing characters like Anita Sarkeesian as innocent were also very one-sided, as supporters of ""integrity in Journalism"" were also heavily doxed but never mentioned in any website.  TL;DR: #Gamergate is about removing corruption in gaming journalism, but due to some more radical participants, it's lost a lot of steam."

pcgaming,3db7v8,XXLpeanuts,2,Wed Jul 15 06:34:15 2015 UTC,"That might explain while Dead Island: Epidemic has had it development killed too, pretty much."
pcgaming,3db7v8,Trollatopoulous,6,Wed Jul 15 02:43:16 2015 UTC,Did that ever come out of beta? Or did they just sweep it away?
pcgaming,3db7v8,Agentofsociety,3,Wed Jul 15 02:44:56 2015 UTC,Dunno but I have a bunch of keys as does everyone on this earth it seems.
pcgaming,3db7v8,Agentofsociety,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:18:25 2015 UTC,"They keep changing the game and its associated systems, which lead people to leave in droves. Unfortunately it's still in beta and hasn't seen much progresses besides adding more characters. Last I heard is the community manager was let go and nothing has come from SLS ever since. It's sad, they make good gameplay, but completely fail at everything else."
pcgaming,3db7v8,Agentofsociety,2,Wed Jul 15 17:15:10 2015 UTC,"Damn shame, hope it gets picked up by Techland and a new publisher. Loved the Dead Islands and Dying Light, so it would be fitting if they made the second DI."
pcgaming,3db7v8,Agentofsociety,6,Wed Jul 15 02:44:14 2015 UTC,"I doubt Techland would pick it up. They went to make Dying Light because they felt DI wasn't what they wanted to do. Would defeat the purpose of getting away from DI if it held them back, making Dying Light, then making a sequel to the game they ran away from."
pcgaming,3daccw,caribou_doodoo,39,Tue Jul 14 19:01:48 2015 UTC,"It'll probably be the same as it will be for consoles. Either Konami themselves, or a hired third-party studio, fix any issues that may pop up, or the game will receive little to no support after launch."
pcgaming,3daccw,jravn,8,Tue Jul 14 19:25:51 2015 UTC,And that new third party probably won't be as familiar with the code as Kojima Productions were so our best outlook is probably very little support with patches coming in few and far between :(
pcgaming,3daccw,jravn,17,Tue Jul 14 19:28:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but, well... It's probably not going to be an Arkham Knight situation. There's no reason here for Konami to support the consoles and not the PC, when they are probably going to do jack shit about both versions. Konami itself is pulling out from the video game business, so they'll probably ship the game, reap the millions and quietly go back to their casinos and spas."
pcgaming,3daccw,Jester278,13,Tue Jul 14 19:33:33 2015 UTC,That's what has me worried and makes me think it could potentially be a situation even worse than Arkham Knight.    At least Rocksteady has commented on their game and is supposedly fixing it.  Konami won't even be in the console/PC gaming industry after MGS: V.
pcgaming,3daccw,Fullmetal9780,3,Tue Jul 14 19:41:01 2015 UTC,"Look on the bright side, there may be fan patches at some point."
pcgaming,3daccw,mystache_,36,Wed Jul 15 06:23:08 2015 UTC,"Konami LA Studios is doing the MGO and PC ports. It will be fine.   There are even things in Ground Zeroes that have yet to be fixed yet, like mouse scaling.   The devs even asked on Steam, what PC specific features/options we would like to see. This was one of the most requested ones.  Edit*  Link to said steam page:  https://steamcommunity.com/app/287700/discussions/0/530645446312560975/"

pcgaming,3daccw,MistaHiggins,12,Tue Jul 14 21:53:35 2015 UTC,"Whenever you zoom in with the binoculars, the mouse sensitivity doesn't scale down to accommodate your narrowed vision. As a result, you have to move the mouse really slowly and precisely, and the camera moves all jerky and horrible (as if the mouse sensitivity has been set through the roof).   EDIT: I forgot to mention that this also occurs when using weapon scopes, which arguably makes the issue even worse."
pcgaming,3daccw,unknownohyeah,9,Tue Jul 14 22:13:02 2015 UTC,"Oh man that was annoying. Fortunately, I could work around it pretty easily with my MX518. Sensitivity +/- buttons right by the wheel."

pcgaming,3daccw,Kinths,-1,Tue Jul 14 22:55:14 2015 UTC,just use a mouse with a sniper button
pcgaming,3daccw,madbrood,6,Wed Jul 15 09:09:08 2015 UTC,"Well, seeing as though Ground Zeroes has issues that have gone unresolved for months, I'm going to say that the absolute only way PC will get support is if it's broken on launch. Other than that, if it runs for the majority, that's it."
pcgaming,3daccw,aldmerimaneater,6,Tue Jul 14 20:02:02 2015 UTC,They are still working as contractors on the game. And likely will do after launch for a bit.

pcgaming,3daccw,ninjyte,5,Wed Jul 15 07:02:35 2015 UTC,Konami LA is unaffected and they are the ones doing the PC version and Metal Gear Online.

pcgaming,3daccw,Nose-Nuggets,4,Tue Jul 14 20:09:28 2015 UTC,I don't even think you can pre-order it. IIRC you couldn't pre-order MGR:Revengeance's or MGS: Ground Zeroes' steam releases
pcgaming,3daccw,Nose-Nuggets,-2,Tue Jul 14 22:51:53 2015 UTC,"I'm planning not even to buy it. I'd like to support Kojima, but how much will they get if we buy the game now with all the fuss?"
pcgaming,3daccw,PhantomLiberty,11,Tue Jul 14 22:45:08 2015 UTC,The fallout now likely has not affected whatever contractual agreement Kojima and Konami came to for MGS5.
pcgaming,3daccw,Zarcu,2,Tue Jul 14 23:24:40 2015 UTC,"They are being pretty transparent about it, this was posted a mere 6 hours ago and it sounds like more info will come in the future expanding on what requests they received, and what requests they have been able to fulfill  http://steamcommunity.com/app/287700/discussions/0/530645446312560975/#c537402115096663018"
pcgaming,3daccw,niioan,2,Tue Jul 14 23:35:42 2015 UTC,I just really hope they implement a good anti-cheat for MGO before they inevitably abandon it.
pcgaming,3daccw,Mirtastic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:51:28 2015 UTC,My question is why Kojima leaving means support for MGS5 will suffer. I'm sure Konami can handle bug fixes just fine. What I'm more concerned about is the future of MGS. Konami has the rights and Kojima is disbanded.
pcgaming,3daccw,58592825866,2,Wed Jul 15 00:18:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's mostly because MGS is his baby, if something was wrong, he probably cares enough to fix it. Konami has dumped him, erased his name from existence and even declared they are refocusing their company on mobile...how much confidence does that give you? lol  A lot of the people still there may truly care, but if bossman says work on something else, they don't have a choice."
pcgaming,3daccw,Baatun2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:37:12 2015 UTC,I'm kinda worried.. don't need another Arkham Knight incident especially since the developer team has been disbanded.

pcgaming,3db3fw,TheGreatDarthTater,3,Tue Jul 14 22:09:09 2015 UTC,"I really want to get back into this game, but I got sucked into EU:IV  - and its armada of DLC expansions - so when I looked back at CKII I saw that I had missed quite a few expansions since Old Gods. Now if want to get the missed expansions and the accompanying DLC it's gonna cost so much.   Honestly, Paradox, when a expansion DLC comes out with a new culture the following stuff like: portraits, music, and unit packs, and etc., for said new culture should come along in its usual €14.99 fee. Sure they are optional, but unlocking Norse culture and then playing with leaders with no Norse portraits and units is kinda meh, basically almost raising the price to €20.00 for a expansion, the size of which I think most can agree are worth €10 to €20 range. Once again I know these are optional and don't affect the core game play, but they do severely destroy any atmosphere since of that is delivered by the music, unique portraits and units."
pcgaming,3db3fw,downeverythingvote_i,2,Wed Jul 15 04:31:32 2015 UTC,CK2 + most of the DLC is on sale now!
pcgaming,3db3fw,NotKony,4,Wed Jul 15 20:19:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Paradox has gone from having a pretty reasonable model of decent content at an acceptable price to essentially attempting to rip its players off. CK2 does a better job than the EU4 dev team does as the CK2 big DLCs are generally quite substantial. The EU4 team nowadays releases patches with minor alterations then wants you to buy cosmetic DLCs on top of that. It's absurd."
pcgaming,3db3fw,BennyBonesOG,2,Wed Jul 15 07:13:05 2015 UTC,"Based on the structure of the game where religion, culture and form of government all provide major differences, there was always more room for expansion with CK2. All eu4 states play essentially the same way, with stat boosts in different places being the only real differences."
pcgaming,3db3fw,Zep_Rocko,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:49:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's underestimating the game to think the best they can do is release patches with minor alterations for £10 a pop. Though in my opinion there needs to be a CK 3 and EU4 real soon. I mean I doubt it, but they've milked both of these games for too long now. There are major systemic flaws which need to be addressed. Big flaws that are widely agreed on by the community. Economy, diplomacy, resources, trade, etc."

pcgaming,3d8m49,bloodstainer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:57:37 2015 UTC,"I thought the gameplay of DA2 was pretty slick (and the DLC with Corypheus, especially so because it added a layer of difficulty and strategy that most of the main game lacked).  DA2's main failing I thought was that it was following a game like DA:O which single handedly created a huge universe with deep lore, and it couldn't live up to that. Also, you went from being able to travel around a whole continent with several cities, to being confined in 1 city, retreading the same ground over and over again. Also, enemy spawning didn't work very well in DA2.   I get the feeling DAI is just like an MMO single player game.   That's pretty much a correct intuition.  While DA:I feels bigger than Kirkwall (...it is) everything feels really diluted. You visit the continent of Fereldan again, but nothing is remotely recognizable, the cities feel like an afterthought with little depth. Quests and missions are displayed on a board game-like map with little markers to display missions and locations, and I think that representation is what describes the world best: it's like moving around a giant game board, with pretty designs. Everything is very flat, literally and figuratively."

Compare it to Cryengine's SMAA and it is night and day in performance. I've done some tests with the help of the good folks at Hardforum on BF4's implementation of MSAA and you lose 25-30% of performance in MP, which is a crazy high amount for what is supposed to be a world-class engine. Crytek's SMAA loses a lot less, 10-15%.  Still, I'd imagine that repi and the rest have worked a lot on the engine and it's probable we'll see much better numbers with Battlefront."

I doubt Battlefront @ 1440p with a single 290x will be hitting 70 FPS with MSAA 2-4x.  The article says something about not being able to select MSAA manually or something (with my google translate skills). I am quite sure it will be like BF4 where you had post-AA low/med/high, then MSAA 2 or 4x.  Going to strongly say this is running only with post process AA. I don't have a problem with that at all, MSAA eats a shit load of frames and isn't even that effective."

Games that have both option still look good with just FXAA/SMAA/MLAA, like AC: Unity, GTA V, Ryse, or Crysis 3.  If I have leftover frames I will certainly use MSAA, it doesn't hurt image quality really at all, but it is big on lost frames and sucks up vram.  At 1440p and 4k I'd probably be completely fine with just post process AA, although it also depends on how big the screen is.  FXAA/MLAA/SMAA are the future!!!"

Things like view distance, foliage, rendering of objects that arent visible etc. are all going to add up and take a hit on your performance."

The game is really heavily taxing on your GPU, it isn't badly optimised. To run everything except Hairworks on ultra on 1440p and to except a 60+ fps experience with a 290X just shows how uninformed you are about GPUs and graphical fidelity, no offence.  Honestly, I feel a lot of people don't really know that 1440p is a huge step and just because they see a lot of review sites - unwisely - stepping away from 1080p benchmarks, they think the hardware is ready for it.

pcgaming,3dflov,Red-Blue-,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"Played Batman city, and origins. There's like three enemy types, the normal dudes you can smash the attack button, the shield dudes you have to somersault over and hit them from behind, and the big dudes you need to stun before hitting them, oh and the tazer guys you have to do something to kill them. Then do that same combat for twenty hours. The problem is the combat is very lack-luster compared to something like jedi knight, which was more skill based and input based, and that game came out ten years ago.   You can use gadgets in combat, but there’s no point, when you can just dodge and attack people for the same efficiency.  It's nowhere near as difficult as ninja gaiden. The only depth of the combat is getting a longer combo going without getting hit.   The batman games are worth playing, to play as batman, not much else."

The game does a good job of making you feel overwhelmed with the enormity of the scene and whats going on in Gotham.  The gameplay just bridges you.  I personally have no problem with that.  If I want to chop dudes heads off with a Dragon Blade, I go play Ninja Gaiden and play till my heart's content.  This is not that game.  Its about telling a Batman story."
pcgaming,3dflov,Enjoiissweet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:53:51 2015 UTC,"Left-click attacks, right-click counters attacks. Finishing moves are alt+1, alt+2 ... Every key can be remapped. At lower difficulties the game is very casual, but timing you attacks and counter attacks perfectly rewards you with double the multiplier, higher combo multiplier = more finishing moves. If you spam click attack and don't pay attention to the timing your counters, you will die more often or you might get over whelmed. As the game goes on you fight groups of mobs with armor or weapons which require more complicated combos or the use of gadgets to take down. Very similar to the combat in the Assassins Creed games, but much smoother and more variety is the combat animations."

It's literally dial-a-combo while you wait for the enemy to attack with a very noticeable indicator to counter that lasts almost forever.  There's no free flow to the combat on any of those games.  No strategies that you can make on the fly to fight different enemies at the same time.  There's no skillful dodge or counter system to make your playstyle feel rewarding.  It's just boring.  Combat is absolutely boring in those games.  The only reason why I liked Batman Arkham Asylum, and Arkham City was for the atmosphere and metroid style gameplay.  The combat system is at the bottom of the list of things I liked."

Not what the store calls it, but what shipping level was actually selected and paid for through the parcel service? UPS Worldwide Expedited for example, is much, MUCH different than UPS Standard when it comes to what fees you may have to pay. Sometimes, paying an extra $5 for shipping can save you $50 on delivery. UPS is not as bad as they once were but still, try to avoid if possible. The best shipping option is always USPS if available.  As far as I know, EVGA video cards are considered 'made in USA' for the purposes of NAFTA, and are therefore free-trade. No duty applied. However, that's hardly your biggest concern.

pcgaming,3d9nwt,jikijiki,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:11:55 2015 UTC,"Its called tornado shot, is is one of the strongest 'ranger skills' if you want to call them that. Other bow skills that are strong at the moment are split arrow and lightning arrow.   Tornado shot fires a projectile to the point you choose, and upon reaching the point sends out a nova of arrows around it (5 or so).  It is generally used with the greater multiple projectiles support gem, and fired slightly behind your main target, causing the initial arrow to deal damage on the way through, and then the explosions of arrows to 'shotgun' the target afterwards.  Currently bow builds are a little weak early on, but ramp up quickly later. A good skill to start leveling with is poison arrow, and is also very popular at the moment due to its lack of reliance on gear and strong damage with little passive investment.  On your first playthrough i would definatly spend a few minutes searching for "" skillname 2.0 build guide"".

The core gameplay is enjoyable, however. The way skill gems interact with support gems and modifiers on items is cool.

You'll also have to build multiple chars once you get the hang of the skill tree.  Sure you could play casually for a while and have fun though without getting much into the nitty gritty.  But it takes a lot of work to get ""good.""  Diablo 3, while fun in a different way, is definitely more casual and easier to pick up and play for an hour.  Out of the two, however, I prefer D3 because I don't have the time to invest in something like PoE."

In the end you don't feel like you've really spent your time very well. but it is free.  D3 has a lot going for it that makes this game very unapproachable to someone who plays D3.  I've put over a thousand hours in D3 and can highly recommend that. PoE is something I've struggled to put even a hundred hours into, I keep leaving it and coming back hoping it'll change but it never does."
pcgaming,3d9nwt,screwyluie,4,Wed Jul 15 05:42:39 2015 UTC,"PoE is very unapproachable for people who play D3. That's like asking a kid to put down his remote control airplane and successfully learn to fly an airliner.   Basically, for those that don't know, Diablo and Diablo 2 (Plus LoD) were some of the most excellent ARPG games every made, with a HUGE cult following that was completely devastated when Blizzard made Diablo3. Diablo3 was easy, it held your hand throughout most of the game and it's basically a gear treadmill straight out of retail WoW. Comparing Diablo2 to Diablo3 is like comparing a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to an uncrustable. (http://www.smuckersuncrustables.com/)  The uncrustable looks better and is easier to eat, but it's filled with twice the amount of preservatives and tastes like shit. It's also kid-friendly. (Seriously, a major gripe with D3 in the ARPG community is that D3 looks too pretty and there's not enough violence/gore. This is a HUGE transition from the grittiness of Diablo2.)  Because Diablo3 was such a crappy noobified, linear, 'pretty' and stale ARPG - Most Diablo2 fans either didn't touch it or uninstalled it after being heartbroken by the game. (Myself included.)  A LARGE amount of the playerbase in PoE are huge Diablo fans, meaning they love the real Diablo games but hate whatever D3 is.   My name in PoE is SecretCow and I just started a guild called Lords of Destruction. :D  I will always have a place in my heart for D2:LoD.  The Diablo series has been tarnished, but many fans see PoE as the spiritual successor to the series.  If you like D3, keep playing it. You'd probably have a hard time in PoE."

D3 I put much much much more time into simply because it was a fun little social slot machine! Also at end game, running rifts with 4 people is just absolute hilarious chaos. Grab a beer and click the shit outta your mouse. Simply a good time.   Also, D3 with the darken/sharpen ENB looks VERY different. Check it out."

I'm sure they fixed a lot of the reasons the game sucked on release, but it's still a crappy game and a HORRIBLE sequel to one of the best games of all time.  I'm not going to debate with you, anymore. You said PoE was easy but you haven't even played through it. D3 has limited customization and builds, which is unfortunate since most fans of the ARPG genre want a unique experience on every character.   It's whatever. D3 might not be the worst game ever, but as an ARPG it's complete garbage. You are obviously not an ARPG fan."
pcgaming,3d9nwt,IAmSecretCow,-5,Tue Jul 14 18:06:26 2015 UTC,"limited customization and builds   ok now I know you haven't played it. It's the whole point of the game, the freedom of builds and the many, many combinations there of.   You gave up during what is essentially the tutorial.   so the whole game is a tutorial and only the end game matters at all? that seems like a design flaw to me. The fact I haven't played it through but still forced myself to put around a hundred hours into should also speak volumes about the lack of rewarding gameplay, tedious mechanics, and frustrating design flaws.  I'm glad you like it, I'm sorry you haven't played d3 recently, but the reality is PoE, regardless of D3, is just an ok game, and if it weren't free it wouldn't be worth most people's time."
pcgaming,3d9nwt,screwyluie,5,Tue Jul 14 18:18:55 2015 UTC,You put a hundred hours into PoE and didn't even play past standard. That's great.

The bottom line is that, regardless of what you WANT to believe, PoE is a harder game with more diverse mechanics, content and replayability. Path of Exile caters to the hardcore fanbase of ARPG games, and Diablo3 is a simplified ARPG experience meant to cater to more casual gamers.  Here is a good comparison of different aspects of both games. http://www.requnix.com/diablo-3-vs-path-exile  That list is outdated, too. PoE has added content and gotten a lot better since this was made. The only major issue with PoE (Desync) was also fixed in the latest expansion."
pcgaming,3d9nwt,IAmSecretCow,2,Tue Jul 14 20:54:38 2015 UTC,"Much more in depth, challenging, and 100x more customizable than Diablo 3. I currently have about 2000 hours played in it and it is by far my favorite aRPG game to play. They have consistently been updating and adding content/items/skills for the past few years. The devs also read and comment on the PoE subreddit on a regular basis.    A new patch/league just came out last Friday, so perfect time to start fresh."
pcgaming,3d9nwt,rakarsis,-5,Tue Jul 14 18:43:58 2015 UTC,Be fair d3 was from the start a console game. So ofc it has to be dumbed down. Pc version was just the payed beta. And btw they did not dumb that much away from diablo 2 what only was : get as much as you need for the build into other stats and pump everything else into life...so not a big thing to remove that. Poe is fun. Please dont use guides. Explore any game by your own. Guides take away from the game and its so much more rewarding to find things out by your own.
pcgaming,3d9nwt,tadL,2,Tue Jul 14 16:29:41 2015 UTC,"The best ARPG currently, as far as I'm concerned. It's not as polished as D3... but D3 is essentially just grinding for set gear to play specific builds. PoE has significantly more customization which ultimately is what I'm looking for when it comes to ARPGs. It's free to play so no reason not to give it a try. Though if you do end up liking it, you'll probably end up wanting more bank tabs which do cost money."

I have way more fun with it than I ever did with Diablo III, and switch back and forth between PoE and Marvel Heroes (Not to say that they're very comparable at all, mechanics-wise).  PoE is entirely possible to play 100% free, so that's a huge point in it's favor. And it'd take you a very, very long time to experience ""everything""."

I just gave it another shot the other night and found desync wasn't an issue and it was largely enjoyable.  You won't find the same level of aesthetic polish in PoE compared to something like D3, but it's certainly greater than or equal to TL2. It's certainly less buggy than TL2 and mechanically superior to D3, IMO. The skill grid is huge and makes me feel like there's serious depth to game.  But it isn't completely without issue. I installed the game to my SATA 2 connected SSD (my 2nd SATA 3 port broke) and am experiencing what seems like ""loading jank"" rather frequently. At 250MB/s read, this really shouldn't be an issue, but I'm hoping when I transfer the game to my SATA 3 connected 500MB/s 850 EVO it goes away.   I'm still not 100% cool with how the game handles currency and identify scrolls. Basically you can sell a normal item on the ground for an ID scroll scrap, forming a full scroll when you collect 5. This causes me to constantly pick up EVERYTHING and go back to town frequently to sell just to stay ahead on ID scrolls, kinda impacting the flow of things. This may just be me and it probably gets better later on... Hopefully?  At any rate it plays well enough and has enough depth to really try out. Just make sure you have a fast SSD to install it on... Hoping that fixes the load stutter for me."

pcgaming,3d9nwt,Dudles,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:37:02 2015 UTC,"It's decent. Worth it to at least give it a shot. There is however a couple of pretty big weak points to it (there are others, but they aren't as bad). Desync, despite many ""fixes"" over the past few years is still as bad as it was when the game was still in closed beta. They have added a lockstep mode (ie. replace latency with input lag) but unless you get a stable <50ms connection it isn't a particularly good experience. On predictive mode, every single move you or enemies make will put you slightly out of sync, culminating with you getting killed because you were still in that room that you thought you left 5 minutes ago or killed by mobs that appear invulnerable because they are actually on the other side of you. The loot system is very mediocre. Almost all of the affixes you can get can be summed up with 'deal more damage', 'heal faster' or 'take less damage'. There's nothing there that has any significant impact on the way you play the game. Unique items do bring some much needed variety, but they don't drop particularly often and when they do you are much more likely to just get a stat stick item. The exception to this is the way flasks are handled, which is really well done."

The devs have been improving the game quite a bit every season still needs more diversity in builds which this new patch should help with. POE awesome skill tree build how you want no hand holding absolutely love that the downside is it just doesn't feel as smooth as D3 the combat is decent but lackluster in comparison. So it's kind of a trade off better combat D3 better character builder POE.

On this basis alone, I highly recommend playing it ASAP, especially if you haven't played it before.  The core of the game is character design, where the massive skill tree allows you to build out many, many different styles of gameplay.  It's free, so there is no reason to not start playing today.  That said, I stopped playing a long while ago because there is no way to easily respec.  This is a problem if you really enjoy playing with builds because you'll find yourself 100+ nodes into your character and realize that if you want to respec it's actually easier to start a whole new character.  Shame, because I would be back in a heartbeat with a more accessible respec."

It's like a huge skill tree and picking the best skills, if you pick the best path. I played a Templar at level 30 and stopped but it was so fun, Templar played a melee/elemental type character and I played that way and I would just destroy waves of enemies with ease. The Gameplay is just a dungeon crawler gameplay and It's very fun to fight other monsters like that. The spells system they did was cool, You want summon skeletons as a Witch, Go right ahead because the game uses a gem system that equip on your equipment that gems are spells you equip onto your hotkey bar and level them up to get the stone stronger.

I wanted basically a more gritty, more diablo 2 version of diablo 3. Gritty dark graphics that are more towards realistic than cartoonish. It's not that I expected amazing graphics but the animations, models and environments are all quite lacking, and the gameplay itself doesn't click for me, it just doens't feel as good as Diablo 3... Class choices, abilities... To me, that's the thing. Maybe if I'd given it more time... Grim Dawn is looking more promising to me."

Now went back to it since a week and they added so much additional stuff to it, it's almost like I'm playing it for the first time again.  For me it's definitely the best ARPG I ever played.

pcgaming,3d94ey,Classy_Narwhal_,8,Wed Jul 15 08:58:48 2015 UTC,"Imo, I think the only reason they are putting Gears 1 on PC is because the series is no longer a console seller like it used to be."
pcgaming,3d94ey,KGriever2,22,Tue Jul 14 14:25:46 2015 UTC,And because Gears 1 is already on PC.
pcgaming,3d94ey,caribou_doodoo,4,Tue Jul 14 16:43:27 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't believe people are excited to play Gears of War on PC again.  I got it Day One back in 2007 and the gameplay mechanics were just so boring.  I got to the final boss and got bored and just quit before finishing the game.  And the multiplayer were these terrible tiny little maps where if you swing your mouse really fast and make a few tight turns you could flank the enemy team in seconds (designed for controllers obviously).  The game was boring in 2007, I don't see how it won't still be boring in 2015."
pcgaming,3d94ey,MumrikDK,4,Tue Jul 14 18:24:04 2015 UTC,"It's all super weird to watch. The PC versions of both Halo and Gears were not received all that well. They were talked about as examples of the differences between shooters designed for PC and for consoles, and why just porting them like that sometimes wouldn't make for a great experience.  Now that there's a remaster of the same Gears game coming, and rumors about the Master Chief collection, a whole bunch of people are coming out of the woodwork who crave that stuff, or have nostalgia for Halo PC. I never came across any of those people the first time around.  IF you're a multiplatform gamer who enjoys playing shooters with a controller, I can see why this all seems like a welcome chance at playing beloved games with high end visuals compared to what their original platforms offer."
pcgaming,3d94ey,thepulloutmethod,3,Wed Jul 15 12:02:03 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, I thought the campaign for gears 1 was superb.  I never played multiplayer though so I won't comment on that. But yes give me that juicy gears coop!"
pcgaming,3d94ey,aldmerimaneater,2,Wed Jul 15 03:54:18 2015 UTC,"In 2015 it got even more boring due to every 3rd person action game iterating on the mechanics the series revolves around. I tried playing it when it was ""free"" for Xbox Live Gold members on 360 but it was just so generic and boring by modern standards."
pcgaming,3d94ey,guma822,4,Wed Jul 15 05:22:04 2015 UTC,also gfwl
pcgaming,3d94ey,jaffa1987,3,Tue Jul 14 22:15:10 2015 UTC,I got to the final boss and got bored and just quit before finishing the game.   Why do i have a hard time believing that you've made it all the way through the game to get bored right at the final boss. It wasn't hard so i don't see you fail and rage quit even though it sounds like it.  I have to agree on gears 1 not having much replay value on pc. Horde mode however is the reason 2 of us haul alongside our pc's a 360 when we have a LAN-party.
pcgaming,3d94ey,sunnyice,-2,Wed Jul 15 11:36:59 2015 UTC,Try it with a controller. Maybe you will change your mind.
pcgaming,3d94ey,caribou_doodoo,4,Tue Jul 14 20:34:24 2015 UTC,Why on earth would I do that?  The mouse controls were fine.
pcgaming,3d94ey,sunnyice,0,Tue Jul 14 20:35:34 2015 UTC,Because the game was designed for a controller. Why on earth would you play gears with a mouse and keyboard when the developers of the game intended it to be played with a controller?
pcgaming,3d94ey,caribou_doodoo,3,Tue Jul 14 21:09:26 2015 UTC,"So I want to intentionally cripple my play experience with a game because someone else told me I should?  Nah, pass.  I enjoyed the game more at the fast paced per pixel aiming that a mouse has to offer me more than an awkwardly inaccurate thumbstick.    And cutting through controller users like swiss cheese on multiplayer was pretty entertaining for an hour."
pcgaming,3d94ey,OkidoShigeru,4,Tue Jul 14 21:12:25 2015 UTC,"It's fine to want to play with mouse and keyboard. It's also fine to want to play with a controller. That's the beauty of PC as a platform, the choice to use whichever input device you want."
pcgaming,3d94ey,sunnyice,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:32:52 2015 UTC,I was just talking about the single player. Its a much better experience when I can sit back and relax on my couch and play through TV with steam big picture mode than a mouse and keyboard.  I know mouse and keyboard is king for competitive games like CS:GO and SC2 or any moba games but I dont see gears as a competitive game. The main reason to buy it is for the campaign not the multiplayer.
pcgaming,3d94ey,Nutlink77,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:54:39 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the downvotes.  Games play completely differently with a controller than they do with a KB/M.  For example, Call of Duty 4.  Batshit crazy fast on a PC compared to 360 players that tended to crouch and use cover more often than bunny hopping with P90's and scroll wheel G3's."
pcgaming,3d94ey,thatnitai,2,Wed Jul 15 02:18:23 2015 UTC,"Some people don't get that. I agree thou, play style also changes when you change control scheme, and it can be a good thing, at the very least an interesting change of pace or style."
pcgaming,3d94ey,MumrikDK,2,Wed Jul 15 08:45:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't downvote, but there's two obvious things at play here.  1) Keyboard/Mouse for shooters is PC game input at it's strongest. Compromising on that is an unwelcome idea to many.  2) Beyond that, many of us shun playing that genre on controllers like the plague in general. I've personally played shooters on controllers on/off since GoldenEye (and including later Gears games) because of social reasons, and I've never gotten away from thoroughly hating the experience."
pcgaming,3d94ey,Nutlink77,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:09:09 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating for more controller use at all (and I also can't stand using one for FPS in general), but you're missing my point.  The type of system being used can make the exact same game play much, much differently than it does with a KB/M.  Sometimes it works out for both parties (Call of Duty) other times it works great for a KB/M but not for a controller (almost all RTS) and sometimes a controller is better than a KB/M (Dark Souls)."
pcgaming,3d94ey,caribou_doodoo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:33:30 2015 UTC,You shouldn't have to switch to controller for a more rewarding experience in a third or first person shooter and if you do that is a design flaw by the developers.  Gears of War plays perfectly fine on Mouse and Keyboard but no amount of switching controller schemes will make that game any less boring for me.
pcgaming,3d94ey,HaikusfromBuddha,0,Wed Jul 15 18:40:48 2015 UTC,.... lololol oh god this one here is hilarious. You know alot of people said Halo is dead and then just a few days ago the numbers were released that it's doing better than ever.

pcgaming,3d94ey,Anarchyz11,2,Tue Jul 14 20:10:12 2015 UTC,"It's honest.  Exclusives driving platform survival is not a sustainable business plan, nor is it consumer friendly.  If the platform can't survive because it's good value, or useful in some way other than forced monopoly of a game, why would we perpetuate the idea that it should stay alive?  Microsoft would gain a lot more than it would lose porting exclusives to PC.  Seemless integration between Windows and Xbox One would make the PS4 pretty obsolete."

pcgaming,3d94ey,MumrikDK,9,Tue Jul 14 15:41:33 2015 UTC,"Red Dead Redemption - I love western games. I played the original Red Dead on PS2. I own CoJ games. But I really would love an open world western. The closest thing I have is Fallout 3/NV with a cowboy hat, but to be honest, Fallout has terrible gunplay mechanics for a ""western,"" so even a western mod would be pretty bad. So I guess I don't even care if its RDR, just a really good open world western game.   No. I don't see any kind of development on that game. I would think its likely to see future RD titles on PC though.  Halo - I know we have a lot of shooters, but Halo is rather good. Might as well be able to play Xbox's prize shooter with M/K.   I hope to see HMCC on PC soon, and I think we will. But I don't think we'll ever get a reasonable ""timed"" exclusive. It will always be, years down the road.  Gears of War - The entire series. I own Gears of War on GFWL. I enjoy it. I don't think its the best game in the world, but a lot of fun with friends. Its also one of the few Xbox shooters (or game with shooting mechanics) that I can tolerate on Xbox with a controller. But I'd prefer to be able to play the series on PC with M/K.   Well, we're getting Gears 1-Remastered.. But we already have Gears 1. I would say, its a toss up, but I would lean towards yes, we'll get more. I feel like Gears 1 is one of those games that was release before the ""Steam Age"" and piracy was probably at an all-time high.

pcgaming,3d94ey,caribou_doodoo,2,Tue Jul 14 15:37:18 2015 UTC,None.  Every Xbox exclusive has been so consolized and dumbed down for controller-only use I see no point in playing them on PC (Looking at you Halo series).
pcgaming,3d94ey,thatnitai,2,Tue Jul 14 18:19:38 2015 UTC,"Is playing with a controller on PC such a terrible option then? I mean, wouldn't it be even preferable in say, Forza, compared to a keyboard?"
pcgaming,3d94ey,caribou_doodoo,5,Tue Jul 14 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"No, the problem comes when the game is designed from the ground up for slow, innacurate thumbsticks (Halo, Destiny, Gears of War, etc)."
pcgaming,3d94ey,thatnitai,0,Tue Jul 14 20:33:47 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I think all those games would work really well with mouse and keyboard. Some proof can even be found in the first Halo game which did come out on PC and played totally fine, competitive and single player AI too, with mouse and keyboard, and also the first Gears. I'd love to get Destiny on PC, I enjoyed it a lot on PS4 and would be happy to have a 60fps, mouse and keyboard supporting version... Great damn shooting mechanics."
pcgaming,3d94ey,caribou_doodoo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:35:40 2015 UTC,Destiny is actually the perfect example of a game designed solely for console controls.  https://youtu.be/S7VYd93oEbA?t=2m33s
pcgaming,3d94ey,thatnitai,0,Tue Jul 14 20:38:45 2015 UTC,"Just because it's good to play with a controller doesn't mean it won't be fun, good, or easily applied to mouse and keyboard, and won't even benefit more on that scheme. It will, in PVP or PVE. PVP is obvious, and PVE, well if you played the game you'd know. Also, he says critical areas are large, auto aim is just right, spread is just right for consoles, etc. You must realize that on PC auto aim would most likely disappear, spread could be made looser, critical hit boxes smaller. I take it you didn't play Destiny, you don't have to take my word for it then, but having played much of it, and also being someone who plays just as much shooters with a mouse, I have no doubt it will be amazing to play on PC, and better. There's a lot of verticallity to the game that would be much better utilized with a mouse (feel and precision), and just like many shooters, it has difficulty levels... It was a blast to play. PVP would be amazing on PC."
pcgaming,3d94ey,sno0py,2,Tue Jul 14 20:51:52 2015 UTC,I played Destiny.  Destiny would be way too easy with a mouse.
pcgaming,3d94ey,thatnitai,0,Tue Jul 14 20:54:56 2015 UTC,"Tried Destiny? I'd believe that. Played it? Own it? Nha. Why? because if you did own it, and played it, you'd have to admit it being fun (because you were compelled enough to play it and learn it properly). If you didn't play it and only tried it, well you don't really know it enough to have an understanding of the situation to make a statement such as the one you are making. The option that you played it extensively solely for sake of criticizing it is hardly realistic.  Let's try a different angle then, because despite fine examples such as Halo 1, Alan Wake, and Gears of War 1, which were perfectly fine, accepted and loved on PC (and when criticized, most definitely not due to some ""console design"" scheme), and also despite the fact enemies can be made faster, auto aim turned off, critical boxes re-sized and spread made looser (""problems"" of console games), you say console games don't adopt well to mouse and keyboard and PC. Which btw, also still doesn't answer the question: if they're made for controller, why not play them with a controller? Bloodborne, for example? So what if a game is made for controller, and even if it's a shooter- how does that render the game worthless, or rather, not fun?  Tell me this then: what console game didn't adapt well to mouse and keyboard? Surely you have enough examples of console games that did, but you showed none belonging to the other end of the spectrum."
pcgaming,3d94ey,sno0py,2,Tue Jul 14 21:43:29 2015 UTC,"Played it? Own it? Nha.   I played it and I own it.  I never said it wasn't fun on console (your mileage may vary).  It would be too easy and become boring on PC (at least in PvE) because it was designed from the ground up with consoles in mind and the accuracy of the mouse would trivialize more of the challenging aspects of the PvE sections.  The nature of the AI pathing is just a simple shooting gallery which works fine on console but would become very mundane on PC, so unless they re-work the entire AI, weapon spread, recoil, and splash damage for each weapon, as well as the hitbox and animations for every enemy type for a PC release (which would never happen because that is too much work) I don't see Destiny working on PC.   you say console games don't adopt well to mouse and keyboard and PC.    I never said that."

pcgaming,3d9948,2FastHaste,7,Wed Jul 15 17:01:57 2015 UTC,"UE4 has a new lighting model and uses physically based rendering. You can tweak how this stuff works without completely replacing it, but you don't have to so nobody does it. UE4 comes with a bunch of pre-set material types, and people just reuse those.   The material is applied to a texture and tells the light how to react with it, so if you use the pre-set metal material on a texture, light interacts with it in a way as described by the metal material. Even if you use a different texture, the material still interacts with light the same way. It's like if we both had some wood boards and you carved a rabbit and I carved a cat. The material of the wood will still look the same even though we didn't carve the same animal. If you dunked yours into water and I didn't the wood will look different even though you didn't change your carving, just like changing the material type in UE4."

I assume that for people who dont know books, Ciri is just noone special, while as someone who know books i was super excited when CDPR decide to bring her to 3rd game. This is just mine opinion as someone who love witcher books."

pcgaming,3daicx,attackzac21,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:47:04 2015 UTC,"I'd start with 2, to get a good idea of the world, build relationships with characters and get a handle on the combat (as W3 heavily borrows from W2).  W1 is a very difficult game to jump into and doesn't really represent the quality of the next 2 games. I'd jump into 1 after 2 or 3 because it's the world and the characters thats gonna pull you through the slog that is W1.   A lot of people say you should start with W3. I don't know why they say that. 99% of the character encounters are supposed to illicit nostalgia and supposed to be a big character moment. If you jump into 3 it'll just be 2 characters you barely know anything about hugging and exchanging pleasantries.  It'd be like jumping into mass effect 2 without playing 1. The archangel reveal is completely emotionless without having already established a 'relationship' with garrus.  How i'd do it if I could do it over again. W2-W1-W3. Or if you really are turned off by W1's gameplay and horridly complicated quest design. W2-W3-W1."

pcgaming,3daicx,Selrisitai,3,Tue Jul 14 21:29:00 2015 UTC,be careful. Many souls don't make it through W1 and then give up on the series. Remember to pull through it when the game gets down or boring. It'll be 100% worth it I promise you.
pcgaming,3daicx,Grellenort,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:13:52 2015 UTC,"This just now happened to me on the Witcher 2. I started the series with Witcher 2, and it's amazing how much hype the tutorial of the game seems to build regarding the combat, only to have simple, clunky mechanics.  I played until one of the first missions, defeat a few enemies and take control of a ballista. After getting hit a few times, clumsily swung my sword about and managed to kill a couple of enemies (a third who killed himself in embarrassment after sustaining a minor wound when I accidentally managed to hit him) and I thought to myself, ""Wow, I'm not going to keep playing this.""   Every cut-scene in the game is embarrassing.  King stands still, without moving anything but his mouth Follow me! Still standing still, and about five seconds before the camera fades to black so that the next scene will start   They did a great job on the voice acting and dialogue and all, but man this is the problem with role-playing games: They're so bloody big that corners are cut all over the place.  I just got done playing Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, and the story mode in that is intense and engaging, while perfectly intertwined with the action mechanics.  After playing that, I also played some Shadow of Mordor which was fantastic fighting mechanics and enemies that seem almost personalized to you and the story.   I think that I will never be able to play a game like this again unless there are serious updates, alterations or reconsiderations regarding how they're made. (Then again, I am highly enjoying Reckoning: Kingdoms of Amalur, so who knows why I like what I like?)  Anyway, my point is that I am extremely disappointed, because I was going to go ahead and buy the Witcher 2 and 3, but after playing the second one (A . . . uh, ""Demo"") I deleted the second game and will not be purchasing the second. Agh, what a disappointment."

I completed two different Fable games. (The latest of which had plenty of its own problems, but hey, the game mechanics kept me at least engaged enough to beat the thing!)  Thinking about it, I'm a little surprised that, with all of the quality games we hav gotten, people will accept something like the Witcher II. I wonder if it's because they are much more interested in the story than the gameplay. Still, if you're so interested in the story, how could you tolerate so much bland, clunky gameplay?"
pcgaming,3daicx,DrDroop,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:52:27 2015 UTC,apparently theres a combat mod to change the point and click mechanics but the jump from W1 to W2 is intense (i just started W2)

The game isn't long at all once you can mow through enemies. The most fun? Probably not, but the strong point of that game isn't the combat at all. It's the story.  Also, your W1 save will import into W2, and then that will import into W3. Nothing major, but your choices are reflected in parts of the story."

pcgaming,3d75z0,MangoTangoFox,2,Wed Jul 15 03:40:00 2015 UTC,"I crafted a few badges ages ago to get to level 20 (I'm 25 now having only crafted 1 level of each of the summer and winter sale badges), to have two showcases on my profile. Beyond that it's too expensive, but others don't feel the same, which is why it's possible for me to sell all the rest. Because I own a nearly 1600 games now, Trading cards have given back to me massively. It's free money for those who don't want to participate and it locks you out of almost nothing for choosing that path, and the taxes support the developer on every transaction through the market. The system lives on the people obsessed with collecting things and increasing numbers. They'd spend that money collecting something anyway, so what's the harm in that going to other players who can buy games with it, or developers who can fund new projects with it?"
pcgaming,3d75z0,mrmodeste2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:18:41 2015 UTC,"Could you explain to me what is the point of getting Steam cards ?  From what I have understood, if you get a certain set of cards you can transform it into a badge, you can show it on your Steam profile and it also increase your Steam XP points.  But then what does it give you, aside from virtual points ?"
pcgaming,3d75z0,JohnnyC4ge,3,Tue Jul 14 17:49:35 2015 UTC,"Every 10 steam levels gives you an increased chance to get trading cards boosters for the games you own.  You can sell these boosters or use them to craft more badges and so on, but the chances of getting them are pretty low I think (I haven't received a single booster and I've been using Steam since cards came out).  You get a steam background and emoticon when you craft a badge.  The point of the Steam cards is pretty much to market Steam itself and to add value to the games that have them as well as add entertainment for people that like to collect things and/or like trading.  They also generate some revenue for Valve since everything that is bought or sold on the market is taxed.  They aren't really meant to appeal to everyone and for those that aren't interested in them they can easily be ignored unless you need the friend slots"
pcgaming,3d75z0,mrmodeste2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:57:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer. The added revenue for Steam is an interesting point. From what I gathered, they get a 20% cut on every transaction. I wonder how many additional millions they managed to gather out of pretty much nothing. The ROI on this must be amazing !"
pcgaming,3d75z0,gotta_ban_them_all,2,Wed Jul 15 15:08:04 2015 UTC,"when you raise 1 lvl on your steam profile, you get 5 more friend slots, when you raise 10 levels, you get a showcase on your profile, for up to 14 in total so far. And you get emoticons and backgrounds when you craft a badge, most of worthless in terms of price but sometimes you get some rare ones.  Most people do it for the e-peen. Like I'm ever gonna fill up my 830 friend slots..."
pcgaming,3d75z0,MangoTangoFox,2,Tue Jul 14 18:19:45 2015 UTC,"There's a whole official steam page explaining it all, but I'll outline it here.  Cards come in sets per game. As little as 5, as much as 15 I believe. Take half that number (rounding up, so 5/9, 3/5, etc), and that's how many drop for each applicable game. Price depends on how many people own the game as more supply will naturally drive the price down. You can sell those, or craft badges which give you 100exp each and an emoticon+background to sell/trade/use. EXP to level rises every 10 levels. Every level you get 5 more friend slots, and every 10 you get a showcase slot, and increased drop rate of booster packs, which drop randomly based on the rate regardless of whether you play any games or not. The showcase slots and be filled by one of numerous different options which can swap at any time or be hidden. Some have customization options such as selected favorite games/badges, screenshots or artwork, and even custom text for saying whatever you please, and that data is stored so it's not lost if you swap to another showcase in that slot. I use mine for screenshots and linking my trade info., and I could swap that to achievements and badges, and all the selected screenshots and custom text will be saved.  I'd recommend getting to level 10, by having the basic free and event badges, and using CS:GO badges to fill in the rest of the exp you need, as they are by far the cheapest to craft. You'd essentially sell or trade 30 cents worth of cards for each CS:GO badge, rather than crafting with the cards you already have from other titles. IIRC you need to be that level or near there to get free cards during sales events. All the way up to 20, each level wants 200 exp instead of 100, and it's 300 each all the way to 30. It gets way too expensive really quick, but then again as you see I have a friend up to level 150, and I've seen others far higher (700+). The people that do it are doing it out of habit, or as a status symbol. They'll have more friend slots than they could ever need, and more showcases than they could fill with content. lvl 20, MAYBE 30 have a use, allowing you some customization of your profile, but beyond that it's pointless, just for show, and too pricey for most to justify considering what that amount could get you in games. I'd like to have and display the badges from my favorite games, but there's no point when that directly translates into funds I can spend on more games instead. Some people see the cards that drop for them as if they cost $0, but in actuality they are so easy to sell, and they can add up to a very substantial amount quickly. If you ever plan on buying any games from steam to the point where you'd have to add funds, crafting the cards that drop even if you do so for free with trading, is equivalent to spending money on them. Adding funds before utilizing all of this (extremely useful site, I recommend it, just punch your screenname in), would just be a waste."

Valve could go and add options to support the top 100 skin requests, OS native, historical skins like steam in any given year, brand new designs for the latest trends and UI tech, and then the 101st request will want something else.  The way I see it, the goal for a widely used application (or even OS) is to be the jack of all trades rather than the master of one - to be generally okay, stable, usable and does it's job rather than jumping around and changing things every 5 minutes because someone else did a feature slightly differently and a few vocal users consider it a must have."

pcgaming,3d75z0,TittyMcFagerson,24,Tue Jul 14 06:56:40 2015 UTC,"This is not true at all. Steamworks DRM is completely optional to the developer, and there are tons of DRM free games on Steam that don't require Steam to launch once installed. You can see the list here"
pcgaming,3d75z0,redwall_hp,5,Tue Jul 14 08:35:23 2015 UTC,"I have personally launched the first Witcher game from its install directory under SteamApps, without running Steam. It definitely works for DRM-free titles."
pcgaming,3d75z0,TDuffin,3,Tue Jul 14 09:53:13 2015 UTC,"Steam hardly gets in the way. Even if my internet is down it lets me boot into games. Origin is the only one I've found to have a problem, because sometimes their login servers go down, which means BF4 won't boot into multiplayer mode because it thinks your internet connection is dead as Origin is running in ""Offline mode""."
pcgaming,3d75z0,thepulloutmethod,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:55:49 2015 UTC,Origin sucks if your internet cuts out. There's no way to play your games in an offline mode when your network suddenly crashes.

pcgaming,3d75z0,The_Web_Doctor,2,Wed Jul 15 03:44:12 2015 UTC,"I know that, but I don't see the big deal about logging in...Steam automatically does that. Also Steam works is optional."
pcgaming,3d75z0,WrenBoy,0,Tue Jul 14 14:59:20 2015 UTC,I prefer DRM being guaranteed not to exist. That way I don't have to worry about it when I'm buying a game.  My Steam library had a decent head start but my gog library is significantly larger now.
pcgaming,3d75z0,The_Web_Doctor,3,Tue Jul 14 16:12:48 2015 UTC,"Good for you, but for most people if it doesn't cause a problem they don't care."
pcgaming,3d75z0,WrenBoy,-1,Tue Jul 14 17:11:01 2015 UTC,"My point was that SteamWorks being optional for devs is not a big selling point for gamers. DRM free is a big selling point, even if its only a subset of gamers who want it."
pcgaming,3d75z0,The_Web_Doctor,4,Tue Jul 14 17:16:10 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, it's the same thing. The only difference is GOG is very public about it."

pcgaming,3d75z0,Medevila,5,Tue Jul 14 13:30:27 2015 UTC,@ Steam if you have friends the overlay is a great tool

pcgaming,3d75z0,Sigmatics,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:03:11 2015 UTC,"It will, but their goal is still to be a complete optional (and fairly lightweight) client that just provides additional convenience features."
pcgaming,3d75z0,vulturepenguin,3,Tue Jul 14 19:49:42 2015 UTC,Have been using GOG for the last week to play a non steam version of the Witcher. Game downloaded super fast and I like the interface.
pcgaming,3d75z0,Ledgo,3,Wed Jul 15 09:55:27 2015 UTC,"Steam needs the competition, otherwise we get crap like paid mods."
pcgaming,3d75z0,Laboe,4,Tue Jul 14 14:34:52 2015 UTC,"He guy slams Steam's ""feature creep"" yet ends up saying it needs more features, like those in GOG.  Logic."
pcgaming,3d75z0,Mr_s3rius,5,Tue Jul 14 16:14:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is logic.  The author says that GOG puts features into Galaxy that make sense and are useful, whereas   Steam is trying to be everything, all at once. The shotgun approach means whatever sticks isn’t necessarily good, and whatever doesn’t stick dies or horribly mutates."
pcgaming,3d75z0,defiance158,6,Tue Jul 14 09:46:39 2015 UTC,"Steam is trying to be everything   It isn't. It's a game sales-front with community reviews, chat, streaming, and trading. It has Big Picture mode for couch-based playing. I think it has a music player. That is far from ""trying to be everything"".   all at once   It hasn't. Major features have slowly been added over the course of 10 years. Pretty damn typical of software.    whatever sticks isn’t necessarily good   Isn't necessarily bad either. And if it stuck, that means it was useful/popular....   whatever doesn’t stick dies or horribly mutates   If something didn't stick, it was not useful or not popular. If something sucks, it SHOULD mutate. I'd like to see a specific list of examples of Steam features that ""horribly mutated"" or ""died"".  Throwing a bunch of words out there doesn't necessarily denote the use of logic."
pcgaming,3d75z0,Mr_s3rius,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:18:41 2015 UTC,"That is far from ""trying to be everything""   Of course it's not. The author was using a hyperbole. And I think he brings his point across well enough if you are willing to meet him halfway.  But seriously, Steam has a lot of features. It's a host for videos, images, game guides, and discussion. Since recently it's also a twitch-like livestreaming service. It's also recently become a retailer for certain hardware. It's got an extensive achievement system and almost rpg-like leveling mechanics for user accounts. It's a content platform for mods. With Greenlight it tries to be a start-up platform for new developers. It's now an in-home streaming solution. It's a news outlet (not just for sales news but also for articles of journalistic entities like Eurogamer or RPS - although this is probably one for the pile of ""dead"" features). It contains a functional web browser you can use to surf online (here is an example of Steam's web browser, taken with Steam's screenshotting tool and uploaded to Steam's hosting service).  Steam has a lot of stuff integrated in it.   over the course of 10 years   I think the author speaks in terms of functionality, not time.   examples of Steam features that ""horribly mutated"" or ""died""   The author mentioned Greenlight (and Greenlight has certainly been under a lot of flack for being a gateway of crap). For any more examples, you have to ask the author.  Either way, his argument is logical even if his perception of Steam and its features is not (which I really don't want to argue about).  /u/Laboe's summary of    He guy slams Steam's ""feature creep"" yet ends up saying it needs more features, like those in GOG.   Is so ""simplified"" that it has little to do with what the author actually said."
pcgaming,3d75z0,defiance158,3,Tue Jul 14 17:29:53 2015 UTC,"I see his point in many ways. Sometimes you just want a tool that has a singular use with all of the fluff cut out. Whether that be Steam, a Phone, a watch, a console, a screwdriver, a car, etc...  But at the end of the day, for someone like me who spends all his time on CS:GO or Path of Exile; I can open up Steam, start a voice call with my buddy, launch my game and just play. Not a single ""feature creep"" from Steam has ever gotten in my way, inconvenienced me, annoyed me, or made me want to look for an alternative. ( But I am jealous that I don't have a knife skin.)  In fact, if I could name any piece of software that absolutely nails unobtrusiveness, I'd have Steam near the top of my list.   Don't want a Steam controller? Cool don't add it to your cart and don't click the check out button.  Don't want to use Big Picture? Cool don't click the button that says Big Picture Mode.  Think Greenlight is a ripoff? Cool don't buy a Greenlight game.  Don't like streaming? Cool, then don't open your friends list, dont click your buddies name, and dont send him an invite for him to watch you play.  Every oddball Steam feature I can think of is opt-in, not opt-out.   It would be far more appalling for Valve to let Steam stagnate instead of being the pioneer that it is. Perhaps as a service to minimalist fans, there could at least be a ""Steam-lite"" client that has most features gutted out of it. Buying & downloading games, Steam friends, and that is it. That would be pretty rad."
pcgaming,3d75z0,Mr_s3rius,3,Tue Jul 14 18:46:21 2015 UTC,"I agree that most features don't really bother me, except for Greenlight. A bad greenlight system directly influences the games that appear on Steam.  Oh well- you could mention the scammers too. If it weren't for the existence of in-game items, we'd see a lot less of them. But the pros outweigh the cons I guess."
pcgaming,3d75z0,finakechi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:09:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was odd, but I do think Steam does have some feature creep.   I really don't need much more feature-wise from my Steam client, but I do really need them to overhaul the entire interface."

Sure it could use 1 or 2 more features but steam has become so bloated and so full of itself that I try not to use it  The one feature I may like soonish  As for cloud savings, just include the save game folder in which ever cloud service you use. I actually prefer this to steams as I still have a degree of control"
pcgaming,3d6dob,Suicidal360Flip,184,Mon Jul 13 21:46:56 2015 UTC,"The numbers Mason, what do they mean?!?"
pcgaming,3d6dob,The_Web_Doctor,70,Mon Jul 13 21:55:02 2015 UTC,The way the test works is the longer the test runs the more objects gets drawn to push the system. When the FPS goes below 30 the test ends and it tallies up how many frames was produced in that time. Those numbers are the number of frames that was produced on each run. Hopefully that made sense.
pcgaming,3d6dob,The_Web_Doctor,29,Mon Jul 13 22:08:11 2015 UTC,So the higher the number the better?
pcgaming,3d6dob,The_Web_Doctor,68,Mon Jul 13 22:13:39 2015 UTC,"Yup, another way to look at it is how many objects were on screen right when the test hit 30 FPS. Basically DX12 and Mantle can handle way more ""draw calls"" without being overwhelmed, therefore they are considered to have a relatively low overhead or higher efficiency."
pcgaming,3d6dob,RealHumanHere,29,Mon Jul 13 22:19:39 2015 UTC,"TIL, thank you for taking the time to explain this to me."
pcgaming,3d6dob,amorpheous,9,Mon Jul 13 22:31:52 2015 UTC,AMD is awesome for having done Mantle while nVidia was sitting on its ass.
pcgaming,3d6dob,yaosio,10,Tue Jul 14 12:11:56 2015 UTC,They're thinking up and working on more proprietary ways to lock-in consumers to their products. See G-Sync and PhysX.
pcgaming,3d6dob,therion17,4,Tue Jul 14 15:38:35 2015 UTC,Nvidia purposely makes their software run worse to get people to buy new cards. Every gameworks game has had absolutely terrible performance even with the gameworks stuff off.
pcgaming,3d6dob,Saitek6,-2,Tue Jul 14 19:10:50 2015 UTC,All aboard the AMD circle jerk train.... Just give to a rest already  FYI Microsoft was working on DirectX 12 long before Mantle.
pcgaming,3d6dob,therion17,6,Tue Jul 14 16:30:19 2015 UTC,"AMD really is a much more consumer friendly company though, even though I use nvidia for the most part in terms of graphics cards I've always bought AMD based CPU's. Obviously at the end of the day they're here to make money too, but at the very least they don't lock in certain tech"
pcgaming,3d6dob,Saitek6,3,Tue Jul 14 20:35:21 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you. I think AMD is a much more consumer-friendly company and I'm happy they're going head-to-head with NVIDIA right now with their new Fury cards. However, what I don't agree with is the other guy randomly spewing lies in a pathetic attempt to start an anti-NVIDIA flame war for those sweet, magical internet points. I don't have a problem with people calling out NVIDIA on their wrongdoings (i.e. the 970 VRAM issue or some aspects of gameworks), but to say that NVIDIA were sitting on their asses while AMD saved PC gaming with Mantle is childish, ludicrous, and just plain wrong."
pcgaming,3d6dob,therion17,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:55:49 2015 UTC,"Indeed it is! People very much enjoy jumping on the anti-nvidia bandwagon and make AMD out to be some kind of saint company that can do no wrong.

pcgaming,3d6dob,therion17,2,Tue Jul 14 21:02:20 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat as you. It's not so much as AMD's drivers are shit compared to NVIDIA's (as far as I know AMD has made a ton of progress with the quality of their drivers), it's just I'm so used to the NVIDIA ecosystem (NVIDIA control panel and the like), but I'm sure after a few months I'd be able to familiarize myself."
pcgaming,3d6dob,GamingPwnage91,5,Tue Jul 14 21:44:27 2015 UTC,Still gotta give it to AMD to do its best at pushing new low overhead APIs. They noticed Mantle was not needed anymore and then shared what they learned with the Vulcan guys.  Thats how the market really should be.

pcgaming,3d6dob,neir,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:49:34 2015 UTC,"The most popular 3rd party software is Clonezilla. It can do a file level backup or a block level backup. File level is smaller and faster but the destination needs to be pre-formatted, block level is larger and slower but the destination only needs to be as large or larger. When we used Ghost 4 Linux, sort of like Clonezilla, we discovered that going from same size to same size hard drives did not always work because some hard drives actually had a few extra blocks than they should have had. If you don't have anything in these blocks it's not a problem, but if anything at all was in them you would have no idea what's not being copied over. Usually this ended up causing Windows not to boot on the destintation drive. Eventually we ran out of hard drive space and were forced to go to file level clones, and then we ran out of space again and were forced to go to Microsoft Deployment Toolkit which is an another beast completely.  During initial install Windows will set some performance options for the hardware it is on, so if you move the install to another computer it will not be as fast as you might want. If you use Microsoft Deployment Toolkit it actually installs Windows, but it's not meant as a backup, it's meant to deploy multiple installs of Windows to multiple computers with the minimum amount of user interaction possible."

Why use DX12 when you can save yourself some future port work for Linux and OSX?   I guess DX12's advantage is in X1 ports, so it'll be pretty popular for AAAs. Fortunately, Vulkan will be more similar to DX12 than DX11 is, and way more similar than OGL, and so Linux will see better and more frequent ports, and probably better emulation with POL and Wine.

I thought the usual LAN driver I used for Windows 7 wouldn't work so I tried searching online for a good while first. Finally tried installing my driver through the usual way of opening the .exe file and that didn't work. Read somewhere to try installing the driver manually through Device Manager and that did the trick.  Disabling UAC completely cuts you off from using metro apps just like Windows 8. I wouldn't really care except for the fact that the calculator is now a metro app, so I couldn't use it. Found a copy of the Windows 7 calculator for download though so thats fine.  Custom themes are a bit wonky right now, so not bothering with that. Also I don't want to change system files and fuck up the system for the next update.  I've been messing around with registry tweaks and those are working just fine. I use Windows 10 Manager by Yamicsoft for my changes.

So at most it can issue 1000 draw calls per second. This means your GPU will do at most 1000 pieces of work per second (because it won't do anything if it hasn't been issued a command). Even if your GPU could theoretically do a lot more wo   better tell ms they've rtm'd it.
pcgaming,3d6dob,Enverex,2,Tue Jul 14 14:38:06 2015 UTC,Lots of people still play DX9/10 games. Are there performance increases along those versions?

pcgaming,3d6dob,Fabel873,4,Wed Jul 15 20:03:15 2015 UTC,"DX12 (which seems to be largely an adaptation of Mantle) could really be the ace in the hole for AMD.   Average FPS    41.35    --->   73.22   This is a 2 year old 290x.  That's a whopping 80% performance increase. These AMD cards could really be something amazing.   Imagine a hypothetical scenario where the Fury X is running on DX12, continues to get performance benefits from optimized drivers over the next year, AND gets its voltage unlocked and truly proves itself as ""an Overclockers Dream"" as AMD claimed. We are talking a hypothetical performance increase here that far outstrips 80%.  As always, there is a difference between simulated benchmarks and real-world gaming. And those benefits never pan out to be as stellar as they appear on paper. But the groundwork is there. AMDs entire lineup could have a revolutionary revitalization simply by software changes.

pcgaming,3d6dob,willxcore,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:42:00 2015 UTC,"That's not how that works. If his monitor is able to show 120 frames a second, and he's generating 240, he's only seeing half the frames. If he caps it at the frame rate, he'd still be seeing the same frames he saw before, since it would only show every second frame to begin with, and that won't change by capping the rate. The only difference is that he won't be generating twice as many frames, so his game will take less resources to run. Also, the frames have nothing to do with how the action in game is progressing, so whether he's running at 60fps or 5000fps, every action he takes is recorded in the game the exact same way. The only limit is his reaction time, which will not change from capping the frames.  How are you people thinking there's some kind of magic with how these frames display? The monitor is already capping his framerate. It cannot show more frames than what the refresh rate allows already. He's not seeing ""newer"" frames by leaving the rate uncapped. That's physically impossible."
pcgaming,3d9a91,supermedo,8,Tue Jul 14 14:34:35 2015 UTC,"That review is a little premature.   It's too bad they put so much effort into that review using W10 build 10130. The newest build, 10162 is much better and it has enabled WDDM 2.0 across the board. Even so, had they had bothered to wait a little longer, the W10 RTM build (10176) is due out sometime this week which should be feature complete for release late next month.  Also, in their benchmarks they used the slightly-troubled beta 15.5 drivers for AMD, the 15.7 WHQL drivers just dropped on the 8th of this month and users have seen some minor performance increases from 15.5 to 15.7.  I personally saw some performance increases from 10074 to 10130, I saw an even larger increase from 10130 to 10162."

pcgaming,3dc3hd,robotsdev,6,Wed Jul 15 03:02:17 2015 UTC,"This is why I really like services like GOG, any game I get on there I can play without GOG. Even If it is technically a game that can only be played online, you could potentially still set up your own server to play it on."

pcgaming,3dc3hd,HaroldSax,5,Wed Jul 15 03:14:29 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all, they've mentioned a few times that there are processes in place for game libraries if the service should disappear.   Second, people praise Steam because it's a fantastic service. At it's core it's basically a DRM service (which is why you get people pissed when uplay or something else is required) that offers a shit load of features that everyone can use."
pcgaming,3dc3hd,mrlinkwii,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:40:06 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware they had processes in place in the event of server shutdown, but would the games that require steam still be playable (like multiplayer games)? I know that not all games on steam actually require it."

Anything that still offers LAN though, that's easy to figure out, but the bigger FPS games and shit, idk."
pcgaming,3dc3hd,mrlinkwii,2,Wed Jul 15 07:07:11 2015 UTC,"Unless you plan to keep all of your games installed locally forever, they're still as good as gone when the servers are gone and you can't download the games anymore. Either way the only way to get the game would be through piracy.

In the very unlikely situation that we have to stop running GOG.com we'll do our best to give you advance notice, so that you can download and safely store all your DRM­free content. 15.1 We may cancel or suspend your access to GOG services and GOG content if you materially breach this Agreement. We'll try reasonably to contact you to explain why we've done this and what (if anything) you can do as a result. It seems very unlikely, but if we have to stop providing access to GOG services and GOG content permanently (not because of any breach by you), we will try to give you at least sixty (60) days advance notice by posting a note on www.gog.com and sending an email to every registered users – during that time you should be able to download any GOG content you purchased."

pcgaming,3da6nn,zeug666,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:01:33 2015 UTC,"Bankruptcy doesn't necessarily mean that they're going out of business. However, the information has been limited, supposedly due to legal obligations (it happened a few weeks ago).   I looked into it a little since it isn't a store I've shopped at, it seems the large portion of games are either DRM-free or Steam keys. The suggestions I have seen in comments on the topic have been to redeem the Steam keys as soon as you can - once redeemed they'll be accessible via Steam. For the DRM-free games, the comments suggested that owners download those games and store them - you don't need Desura/Indie Royale to ""unlock"" the game, but you need them for the download."

pcgaming,3d72ar,TerrenceChill,15,Tue Jul 14 01:39:12 2015 UTC,780 is still a good card. You're willing to pay $300-500 for a 20% upgrade?
pcgaming,3d72ar,macieksoft,3,Tue Jul 14 01:45:02 2015 UTC,If he's interested in VR then he'll need at least the 970.
pcgaming,3d72ar,Robborboy,4,Tue Jul 14 02:02:55 2015 UTC,Did you mean vram or virtual reality?  Because I'm going to be really depressed if I need at least a 970 for the occulus rift
pcgaming,3d72ar,Robborboy,3,Tue Jul 14 02:07:17 2015 UTC,I thought the 780 trades blows in benchmarks with the 970.
pcgaming,3d72ar,SithisTheDreadFather,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:43:22 2015 UTC,"But is lacking in VRAM which may be an issue, depending on the game."
pcgaming,3d72ar,phr00t_,2,Tue Jul 14 14:28:38 2015 UTC,Yous gots one of them there monster 780s mang.   I'm no expert in the matter but I think you should be -alright-
pcgaming,3d72ar,SithisTheDreadFather,3,Tue Jul 14 17:28:36 2015 UTC,I believe Oculus recommends a 980
pcgaming,3d72ar,hoopera,8,Tue Jul 14 17:32:56 2015 UTC,It is the 970. Although the R9 390 is looking like a better value.
pcgaming,3d72ar,phr00t_,3,Tue Jul 14 02:22:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, you're right. I don't know why I thought it was the 980"
pcgaming,3d72ar,Robborboy,2,Tue Jul 14 03:11:10 2015 UTC,"Personally, I find their specs a bit misleading. You'll need that if you want to play something like Elite: Dangerous at max settings, but some of the best Rift games don't require much."
pcgaming,3d72ar,OgcJvcKmd,4,Tue Jul 14 03:52:39 2015 UTC,"Consumer VR displays are going to have higher resolutions and higher refresh rates, which require more hardware. You probably will be able to get by on lower specs, but some games might not be smooth."
pcgaming,3d72ar,Robborboy,2,Tue Jul 14 03:59:17 2015 UTC,"You say that, but Elite Dangerous isn't all that taxing. My 750TiSC ran it maxed at 1080p at over 60fps everywhere in the game unless I was in a station. Even going through planetary rings or hot PVP zones I never had a frame dip."
pcgaming,3d72ar,Stranger_93,2,Tue Jul 14 11:37:47 2015 UTC,"but with vr its not just like a 2d game that hits 90fps, in VR it must at minimum be 90fps AND 3D, requiring roughly 3 times the power regular games today require."
pcgaming,3d72ar,Homunculus_J_Reilly,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:27:29 2015 UTC,From some benches on /r/oculus there was only ~20-30% increase in resource requirements running on DK2 versus the equivalent 2d resolution.
pcgaming,3d72ar,wallgomez,2,Tue Jul 14 14:52:50 2015 UTC,You need more than that according to recommended specs.
pcgaming,3d72ar,Homunculus_J_Reilly,2,Tue Jul 14 15:32:28 2015 UTC,970/290 are the recommended cards.
pcgaming,3d72ar,Dickopf,0,Tue Jul 14 02:34:38 2015 UTC,"They're the minimum recommendation.  Here's the technical blog post from the Chief Architect at Oculus that gave that specification.  He stated that the 290/970 spec was the mark that developers should aim to optimise for. So weaker cards might be adequate for some games, but speaking as someone who owns a DK2, even small framedrops and stutter can induce nausea.  Beyond this, the majority of launch day Oculus titles are funded/developed in-house, making it all the more likely that devs will toe the 290/970 spec line."
pcgaming,3d72ar,Homunculus_J_Reilly,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:36:52 2015 UTC,"http://www.pcgamer.com/oculus-rift-pc-requirements-revealed/   To be fair, this is the recommended spec ""for the full Rift experience,"" so you'll likely be able to get away with something a bit lower on the scale"
pcgaming,3d72ar,OgcJvcKmd,-1,Tue Jul 14 13:47:27 2015 UTC,You will need to render @ 1440p above 60 Hz constantly otherwise you get all sorts of problems (sickness is one). 970 is not nearly enough. If the CV1 has an even higher res then you will need even more. My 980 cannot maintain 1440p above 60 Hz in some games.   VR is going to be very hardware intensive.
pcgaming,3d72ar,TerrenceChill,2,Tue Jul 14 13:49:58 2015 UTC,"Those are the recommended specs for the consumer version of the Oculus Rift as set out by the creators of the device. They claim those cards are capable of "" the full rift experience"" . It's as simple as that."
pcgaming,3d72ar,OgcJvcKmd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:01:51 2015 UTC,"too be fair, pc gamers only think of high settings, medium doesn't come into it and low is not even considered. You'll get your 90fps/90hz but you'll have to lower those settings."
pcgaming,3d72ar,BurtMacklin__FBI,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:04:01 2015 UTC,"tl;dr – Given the challenges around VR graphics performance, the Rift will have a recommended specification to ensure that developers can optimize for a known hardware configuration, which ensures a better player experience of comfortable sustained presence. The recommended PC specification is an NVIDIA GTX 970 or AMD 290, Intel i5-4590, and 8GB RAM. This configuration will be held for the lifetime of the Rift and should drop in price over time."
pcgaming,3d72ar,Robborboy,3,Tue Jul 14 14:50:39 2015 UTC,"just to add another quote to get it through to some people...  On the raw rendering costs: a traditional 1080p game at 60Hz requires 124 million shaded pixels per second. In contrast, the Rift runs at 2160×1200 at 90Hz split over dual displays, consuming 233 million pixels per second. At the default eye-target scale, the Rift’s rendering requirements go much higher: around 400 million shaded pixels per second. This means that by raw rendering costs alone, a VR game will require approximately 3x the GPU power of 1080p rendering."
pcgaming,3d72ar,dtyujb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:50:00 2015 UTC,"If you want to play anything with decent/good graphics, you're gonna need at least a 970. Someone mentioned Elite:Dangerous, which is pretty damn optimized and I wouldn't run it on an Oculus with anything less than an 970 or 290/390. The main reason for this is you really need at least 80-90 FPS solid, and I mean solid for VR to be enjoyable at all. If it drops below 60 at all you notice it immediately."
pcgaming,3d72ar,TerrenceChill,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:54:01 2015 UTC,If it drops under 75fps you notice it terribly.
pcgaming,3d72ar,dtyujb,0,Tue Jul 14 04:20:19 2015 UTC,"Unless they're using a devkit for gaming now, they aren't going to have a good idea of how the HMD competition stacks up until Pascal is on the edge of release, hopefully alongside AMD's second generation HBM cards. Anyone who doesn't already have a headset or who has wealth or shortsightedness in great enough amounts to buy a consumer model on launch day doesn't yet need to upgrade their GPU specifically for VR."
pcgaming,3d72ar,OgcJvcKmd,2,Tue Jul 14 14:29:22 2015 UTC,I don't get your point when Oculus VR specifically said that you'll need at least the 970.
pcgaming,3d72ar,StewartTurkeylink,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:20:16 2015 UTC,"If they don't need a card to drive a devkit right now, they will save money or get better performance by waiting until there are actual consumer model headsets available before upgrading."
pcgaming,3d72ar,Laboe,-1,Tue Jul 14 04:38:35 2015 UTC,"when have minimum/recommended requirements ever been 100% truthful. 970 will be fine, but i think people are in for a shock when they have to start lowering settings to hit a minimum of 90fps."
pcgaming,3d72ar,Eruntien,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:31:16 2015 UTC,20% is not a minor upgrade. 300 dollars for a 20% upgrade seems like a pretty reasonable price to this person.
pcgaming,3d72ar,A-RM,-1,Tue Jul 14 14:55:43 2015 UTC,"780 is still a good card. You're willing to pay $300-500 for a 20% upgrade?   A GTX 980 is going to provide 37% more performance on average at 1080p. Source.  And Maxwell overclocks better than Kepler, too, even if Kepler is no slouch either.  That said, driver optimisation is going to be better on AMD due to longevity of GCN. When 290 launched, it was neck and neck with the 780. Now it has a sizeable lead, which can be eroded thanks to the 780's better OC capability but whereas in the past it would help the 780 cruise past the 290, now it merely gets it even at best.  TL;DR Get a 390X or better yet a Fury (non-X) if you can spend 60 bucks more than 500, AC3R665."
pcgaming,3d72ar,AC3R665,4,Tue Jul 14 14:09:31 2015 UTC,290x is better then the 970 and is cheaper
pcgaming,3d72ar,MojoDrew,4,Tue Jul 14 04:37:58 2015 UTC,"Same with the 390.  I've always owned Nvidia cards, but AMD has really stepped up their game recently.  Plus, every driver since 347.xx has made my gpu crash constantly and I'm getting sick of it."
pcgaming,3d72ar,SweetyTart,-3,Tue Jul 14 03:35:19 2015 UTC,"I'm going with AMD CPU with Nvidia GPU. And for laptops, Intel CPUs with AMD GPUs (cause its a lot cheaper than Nvidias and performs the same). I had an Intel i7-2670M and a AMD 6990M on my last laptop. As you can see from my build I got a FX-8350. I can't wait for the fucking ZEN to release, so AMD can finally step up their single core performance. Gonna do a new build for zen. I gotta support AMD, so I buy their CPUs.  Edit: Wow, thanks for the downvotes. IDK if it were AMD or Nvidia fanboys, I try to stay as neutral as possible."

pcgaming,3d72ar,AC3R665,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:38:13 2015 UTC,I need an 8 core processor. Come on Amazon.
pcgaming,3d72ar,Dragonzeanse,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:13:38 2015 UTC,"You don't have an hundred and fifty dollars? AMD's 8-core processors are dirt-cheap, considering that they can pretty much do anything you need, as fast as you need it within the confines of modern technology. (The difference between AMD's flagship and Intel's is a few paltry frames per second and less than a minute of render time.)  If you want quick loading times in games or snappy operating system response, you need a Solid State Hard Drive. If you want major quality and frames in games, you need a better graphics card.   It's interesting to me that AMD decided to drop out of the processor race, since the one area that they really don't need to compete with AMD in sheer power is processor power, since processing power is the slowest increasing technology, next to RAM. I mean, I'm using a fairly old AMD Phenom II 1090t X6, and I'm running all properly optimized games at 60fps at ultra settings with anti-aliasing at x4. Even then, there is over-clocking head-room for my CPU.  I just do not think processors need to be pushing their limits all that hard. AMD was doing fine in my opinion. Less than two-hundred dollars for a 4.0ghz octocore processor? That's fantastic and I am amazed that they were not -- apparently (??) -- making money."

pcgaming,3d3sqd,fobfromgermany,8,Mon Jul 13 10:09:08 2015 UTC,"Sounds good on paper, but I seriously doubt there is much overlap between those two groups. Someone who is looking to pirate a game PROBABLY isn't willing to buy full price on release week...."
pcgaming,3d3sqd,Discoteca,3,Mon Jul 13 20:37:03 2015 UTC,Ideally they'd maybe keep the DRM in place for the first year and then remove it. Rather aggravating when down the line you still have to deal with the DRM as a paid customer when its intended purpose has been rendered ineffective.
pcgaming,3d3sqd,witti534,4,Mon Jul 13 23:06:53 2015 UTC,I don't know if I have cracked a Denuvo game succesfully because my GPU can't start the game. In this way it was good I didn't buy it because it was before Steam refunds.

I guess that until you guys get burned personally you'll never learn, this is all kinds of sad to me. never thought I'll see PC gamers agree to DRM that adds nothing positive, almost as if GFWL never existed and some people just do not learn.

If publishers feel the need to try and prevent people from pirating their product its fine by me as long as the end user is not effected by it.  Personally I don't know enough about Denuvo to pass judgment on it.

I finished it without any big problems. I loved it, it's possibly the best action game I've ever played. It's also the cheapest AAA title I've bought at launch and perhaps the best $20 I've spent on gaming in a long time. I did not get shafted. I do not feel screwed over. I did not even know it had Denuvo until last week, and I don't care now as it hasn't affected my experience at all. It's very unfortunate so many people seem to experience performance issues in that game, but thankfully they were given the option to get their money back and I hope everyone who couldn't play the game got theirs back. Whether they want to play the game later this year once it's fixed for everyone or not is up to them, not you; and their decision should not make you emotional.  Last year, I played another game with Denuvo (Inquisition), and I loved it too. I did not run into any technical problems with that game either. I'm planning to buy another game that may have it later this year (Battlefront). The presence of Denuvo hasn't affected my experience, and my experience is a bigger factor in deciding what I want to buy and play than your speculation.   I play only a handful of video games, I have a very defined taste and I don't buy more than 3 AAA games a year. I am not going to deprive myself of my hobby just because it makes someone on Reddit emotional or sad.

pcgaming,3d3sqd,Advanderer,2,Tue Jul 14 03:21:29 2015 UTC,I'm assuming I got lucky. I raised the framerate cap from 30 to 60 and played it without any stuttering or dips below 40. I've heard of people with better computers being unable to play the game though.

pcgaming,3d3sqd,JohnnyC4ge,5,Mon Jul 13 09:45:24 2015 UTC,There is no proof.  Denuvo would have to be writing 24/7 for months (and in many cases years) for it to kill a SSD.  Most people just don't understand this and think that any writes to a SSD are significantly reducing it's lifetime.  Writes to a modern SSD on a home computer are largely irrelevant.
pcgaming,3d3sqd,RippyZ,84,Mon Jul 13 15:06:44 2015 UTC,No because you along with everyone else saying this has yet to provide any proof that Denuvo causes performance issues. If you say Lords of The Fallen is proof then you need to prove that it's Denuvo that made it run like shit because that game crashes on consoles too and is more likely just shit programming.
pcgaming,3d3sqd,Florogon,46,Mon Jul 13 18:31:54 2015 UTC,IIRC there has never been any proof that denuvo kills SSDs or degrades performance. Both of these started as steam forum rumors and people just jumped on it.

Why can't people just admit to hating the new Arkham Knight and being upset over the terrible launch rather than using it as a scapegoat to attack DRM? You only make the community look stupider than it actually is, and encourage witch hunts for DRM that doesn't exist.

I wouldn't have been surprised if WB used crippling DRM in the PC port of Knight, but the problem was that the development was offloaded to a different developer who was forced to rush the product out to meet a deadline. Time will tell if WB has learned their lesson with Steam refunds in place to protect consumers from awful ports.  By the way, in response to the OP's edit, nobody is defending DRM.

And here is the thing: If it doesn't impact my enjoyment of a game or impact me in any meaningful way, I don't give a shit. I will gladly pick and choose my own battles as a consumer, and I tend to focus on the ones that actually impact the consumer, not the ones that might one day be a slippery slope argument.  Because we are basically in the golden age of DRM models. I don't have to worry about any game beyond ""install and play"". I don't even have to do anything special to uninstall. It is all 100% seamless and tied to the content management systems (Steam, UPlay, GoG Galaxy, etc) that I like and use for convenience reasons. Even denuvo doesn't actually have any impact whatsoever on my actual use and the fact that people weren't sure if it was in use kind of says it all.  Now, if/when we return to non-account based activation models (think tages and activation model securom), I'll care again. When we have DRM that is affecting performance to a provable degree, I'll care. Until then, I am gonna enjoy the fact that we managed to lose the war against DRM in a way that is actually a fairly reasonable compromise that lets me enjoy the games I buy and the publishers/developers enjoy their cut of the money I throw at Steam and GoG and the like."

pcgaming,3d3sqd,AspsVeryDangerous,7,Mon Jul 13 12:49:27 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your concern for not getting the reaction you wanted, but you need to consider that a boycott for any reason, including DRM is a personal choice. Trying to rally others to do the same in the title just makes it seem like you're concerned with popularity rather than principle.  I certainly find that information pertinent, so I thank you for that.  You could've said 'warning this game has 3rd party DRM' and let people make their own decision."
pcgaming,3d3sqd,DRW_,3,Mon Jul 13 16:10:40 2015 UTC,"Edit: I'm baffled. I really am. This is the PC gaming reddit so honest to god I did not expect people to disagree to not having DRM. this is beyond sad to me.  You guys are getting shafted, you're getting layers of DRM which provide NOTHING to your personal experience and possibly make it worse and you're ok with it because ""well, it hasn't affected me personally yet"".  I guess that until you guys get burned personally you'll never learn, this is all kinds of sad to me. never thought I'll see PC gamers agree to DRM that adds nothing positive, almost as if GFWL never existed and some people just do not learn.   It may not add nothing positive, but if it doesn't take anything that affects me away either, then I don't really care. I don't have a principled stance against DRM, I think many DRM schemes are misguided, but as long as they don't inconvenience me to a degree I find unacceptable, I'm fine with DRM."
pcgaming,3d3sqd,ablebodiedmango,3,Mon Jul 13 13:41:05 2015 UTC,These are the kind of threads that makes me think people should be more thankful they can afford to spend time and energy worrying about shit like this and not worry about their home being bombed or dying of Malaria.

It's still a really great game, WB and rocksteady just need to make things right and offer PC gamers something to make up for their screw up.  I beat the game in its current state and it worked like a champ.  My friends were over and saw me playing it, they thought it was on my PS4.

pcgaming,3d3sqd,artins90,18,Mon Jul 13 08:37:41 2015 UTC,"The cracked version doesn't remove Denuvo. Denuvo is antitamper what it does is scrambles the codes inside the exe and makes it look like gibberish and then decodes it on the fly when you start the game adding a nice CPU overhead. You can't really benchmark it since the cracked versions of the games that use it don't remove Denuvo, they make Denuvo think that it is running on a PC with a hardware configuration that matches the one of the key it was activated with so that it can be run on different PCs with 1 legit key. The cracks for it released so far are all loaders, they don't modify the game exe at all and Denuvo is still intact inside them. To remove Denuvo you would have to find a way to rip the code directly off CPU and recompile it, basically you would have to play the game and record it but then what if a player does something you didn't do? What if they go in a place you didn't go? What if they reach a score you didn't reach and so on. Denuvo has not been cracked yet, it has only been emulated so far."

Of course they are probably dirty liars twirling the end of their pointy moustaches.   No, since only performance non-critical game functions are used in the Anti-Tamper process, Anti-Tamper has no perceptible effect on game performance nor is Anti-Tamper to blame for any game crashes of genuine executables."

I think FIFA 15 uses the Denuvo DRM as well, also runs fine for me and haven't seen anyone say that performance is terrible on it."

I'm against all drm because it doesn't really stop pirates.  Steam is a much better deterrent to piracy because it's features (groups, easy multiplayer, cloud storage of save games/progress) make it worth it to not steal."

pcgaming,3d3sqd,JazMac34,2,Mon Jul 13 09:02:29 2015 UTC,From my understanding Denuvo isn't DRM and in fact is just an encryption method to prevent crack groups from tampering with the .exe (which may actually come with DRM). Also from what I remember with Dragon Age/Lords of the Fallen the whole poor performance and burning out your SSDs etc was largely debunked.

pcgaming,3d3sqd,LordFendleberry,2,Mon Jul 13 19:07:26 2015 UTC,"DRM = Digital Rights Management. An example of very simple DRM is a CD or license key. The code that you're sometimes required to enter during installation of a program is a form of DRM. However, there are much more insidious forms of DRM such as SecuRom, which is essentially spyware that the game installs on your computer to make sure you're the actual owner of the game. Some games like BioShock actually had DRM software that kept track of how many times you installed the game on a computer (by contacting an online server) and prevented you from installing after the set number of times. I don't really know much about Denuvo, though, so I can't say whether it's as bad as OP seems to think."
pcgaming,3d3sqd,specter800,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:21:27 2015 UTC,"You seem to have a lot of time on your hands and actually understand what I said but are just angry that your lord and saviour Steam could be used for less-than-friendly purposes. Your Steam account has all of your Steam purchases tied to it. It's trivial to see and revoke your access to your programs through it on the back end. You are continuing to get caught up on the file access aspect which at this point is laughable since it is an extreme case as I've mentioned many times. If revoking your license somehow didn't remove your access, Steam could push a small update to corrupt an install of your game because there is a local agent that could be used to find out if you still have the game. Your machine likely has a constant connection to Steam. It's how you get automatic updates etc. That could easily be used to remove you access more forcefully.  Will it? More than likely no, but the possibility exists there for issues which don't exists with a GOG download or older physical media unless it came with some for of DRM. All of the consumer protection you cite is in place and that's great but again, I'm only saying people who are wary of the concept of ""ownership"" in the digital age would have problems with the local Steam install. I use Steam every day and will continue to because I don't believe any of what I said can happen will happen but again, like I've been saying all along, it could because the system is in place for it to. It's similar to people who still insist on physical media over digital delivery. They believe that some day these delivery services will disappear and their access will be gone forever. While that's very unlikely in most cases, not all digital delivery services will exist forever. If Vudu disappeared I would lose a lot of movies. If I thought that was a possibility, I might insist on Google or physical media; something I thought had more permanence."

The developers are running into issues with the source engine because the scope of the game has grown so much.  The reason GMOD Tower's population has dwindled in my opinion is most likely due to the fact that you have to have HL2, CS:S, EP1, EP2, and TF2 all installed because they use assets from all the source engine games."

As with most driving games, I find it very annoying having to tap  ""w"" if I don't want to go max throttle, compared to simply not pushing down the trigger all the way on a controller.   It's much easier for me using a 360 controller, both the throttle thing and steering, jumping.   It's possible to hook a gamecube comtrolelr up to a PC IIRC, you would need to get a USB adapter and download a program like Xpadder to manually map the buttons, but it's possible."

pcgaming,3d6zw2,kherby,0,Tue Jul 14 00:41:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand how a Lag Switch works. You or /u/_ALLDAY_ . When using a lag swtich, the user using it will cause his/her connection to be temp. disconnected from the server. While this is happening the person using the lag switch will appear to be frozen to others connected to the same server. But while the user is ""frozen"" on his/her screen they are moving around killing people(For a first person shooter as an example).  A lag switch will not give a single advantage in this game.  What you're experiencing is a shitty connection on you end or a shitty connection on the servers end due to too many people overwhelming the servers.  You can't DDOS someone without knowing their IP / Domain. None of this information can be sniffed due to it not being a peer 2 peer game. This game uses it's own servers. So any IPs being sniffed would end up being the servers IP not a specific players.  Also, Saying people are using cheats because they can't handle loosing is just stupidity on both your parts. Currently as the game is designed if a player wants to prevent a loss all they have to do is leave the game before the match is over. No loss will count against them. This fact in itself shows the ignorance of your acquisition of cheats. If someone wanted to prevent a loss no cheat is needed."

pcgaming,3d54ns,Zune4ever,13,Mon Jul 13 16:30:40 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt it. Not because there aren't plenty of studios capable of making a worthy successor. Rather it seems as if there is this peculiar consensus among many game developers that gamers seek fast, shallow, games. And that includes strategy games. Fast and shallow doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad game though. I consider a lot of very good games to be quite short in scope with straightforward, but fun, game mechanics.   But for a game like MoO I think it's fair to say that the fans require marathon speed (at least as an option) with Mariana Trench depth. And I find it unlikely, though not impossible, that that's what'll be delivered."

pcgaming,3d54ns,EasymodeX,8,Mon Jul 13 19:04:27 2015 UTC,"Meh.  I have zero expectations, but I will probably try it out.  One of the things that struck me about the shift from MOO2 to MOO3 as well as the general shift of the 4x genre as a whole is how much everyone seems to want to add complexity while sacrificing and dropping basic video game components like rule of cool.  By that I mean you take a look at MOO3 or modern 4x games and, for example, you can do incredibly detailed ship designs with tons of components or whatever.  Back with MOO1 the ships just looked fucking cool (and for the most part the same with MOO2).  It was much simpler, but incorporated a lot more fun.  As another example, take the races in some modern 4x games compared to MOO1/2.  In MOO1/2 they were very generic in the sense that they were mostly all humanoid ... but they were cool.  In modern games there is more sci-fi variety, but they're also less interesting at the same time.  A more concrete example ... modern games seem to like the idea of caps on the number of ships in a fleet.  Part of this may be due to graphical limitations for combat.  Well, back in the MOO1 days I could have a fleet of 28,000 tiny ships.  Come on.  Where are my armadas?  A giant ship could crush hundreds of tiny ships at once.  Where can you get that nowadays in the current era where so many games have fleet capacities of dozens of ships?  It would be nice to play a 4x game that decided to maintain a streamlined simplicity along with its complex mechanics, and also carry the entire concept of rule of cool.  It just seems like somewhere along the line developers forgot that these games are, at their core, just video games and not simulations."

pcgaming,3d6x5k,feralkitsune,15,Tue Jul 14 17:47:52 2015 UTC,"People want to be able to whip out their ""Fuck draconian DRM"" t-shirts that they put away a few years ago, and denuvo is the only real target as Steam is so loved that people redefine DRM to the point that they defend Steam as ""not DRM"" (even though it is actually a platform designed to manage your rights to digital media, heh).  As for the ""hurts"" argument: Folk are always going to throw FUD out there. During the height of Starforce (probably the most famous disc-check based DRM model), folk genuinely believed putting a disc in their drive would destroy it. In actuality, Starforce MIGHT have had problems with a few very obscure brands of drives (the kind that the average consumer will never even see in a store) and a lot of that damage was probably done by little kids trying to bypass the DRM (there was a hardware trick you could do). But it is The Internet, so much as we all thought there was a cheat code to see Lara Croft's ta-tas so too did we believe that Starforce would hurt us, rather than just be REALLY fucking annoying and be full of shitware. Well, that and actually WORK as a lot of the Release groups didn't want to deal with making a crack and just said ""use the hardware bypass, we win, lolzorz we are 1337 haxx0rz yo and the other groups suxx0rz0z0z0z0. llolololololol ASCII ART!!!"". Which actually meant a lot of ""consumers"" couldn't play the stuff they got off IRC.  Activation Model Securom also caught a lot of hell for similar reasons as it lasted a whole week on Mass Effect PC (and was subsequently 0-day'd with Bioshock).  But, over the years, we have effectively shifted to an account based activation model (comparable to what Stardock were pretending was ""not DRM"", but generally with more restrictions) where we lose the ability to resell games, but also never have to do anything special to install/uninstall the games. Unlike the usage activation models, such as Securom, where you would have to carefully de-authorize games or else risk not being able to reinstall them later. The shittiness of that and Ubidrm (at its height, the player would have to stream some game logic from their servers while running) basically made us all accept Steam as our lord and savior, and that has resulted in a compromise that most of us are cool with and that the publishers/developers can rely on to make a fair amount of cash.  Denuvo is a resurgence in DRM, but thus far it seems more focused on the pirates than the users (to the average user, it has no impact whatsoever). Many are going to retaliate against that on principle (I partially agree, but I view it as an unwinnable battle where we will likely LOSE functionality if we win), but many others are just looking for a fight.  Thus far: To my knowledge (please, I would love to be corrected. Not being facetious), there is no proof denuvo does anything bad. There are rumors it MIGHT hurt SSDs, but those rumors are unsubstantiated and unable to be reproduced. There are also rumors it causes shit game performance, but that is mostly tied to Lords of the Fallen and Arkham Knight, and neither were particularly strong PC ports. Apparently Dragon Age: Inquisiton had it and ran beautifully for just about everyone, so... yeah."
pcgaming,3d6x5k,Gundato,7,Tue Jul 14 04:02:34 2015 UTC,"Steamworks CEG is DRM.  Steam is a distribution channel, no different from retail+disc.  If there's no Steamworks CEG built-in, it doesn't require Steam.  That's not redefining terms."
pcgaming,3d6x5k,ShinseiTom,0,Tue Jul 14 14:31:55 2015 UTC,"Okay then.  How do I install my game? And once I do that, how do I patch it?   Is there a way to do that without Steam running or having to authenticate with Steam servers?  Nope? Then that seems like DRM to me. And it seems like it is stronger (but arguably more convenient) than those games that wouldn't let me rip and make a super ISO to avoid having to swap discs during install."
pcgaming,3d6x5k,Gundato,3,Tue Jul 14 14:38:36 2015 UTC,So if a game requires a disc to install that is DRM too? Because I can't install without the disc in the drive.
pcgaming,3d6x5k,sumpfkraut666,2,Tue Jul 14 22:35:12 2015 UTC,"If the disc (attempts to) require proof that it is an original printing and not a copy, yeah. I mean, that is what DRM WAS until the mid 10s.  Think about it this way: Most people claim GoG/Humble Bundle downloads are DRM free. For argument's sake, let's say they are.  With a GoG or Humble Bundle installer, it is a binary that you can copy or do whatever you want with it, and when you run it, it installs stuff with no phone home or anything.  With Steam, you need to authenticate with Steam's servers to use the equivalent of that installer, just like you need to authenticate every time you want a patch.  This is kind of what I mean by people redefining DRM to give Steam an exception. GoG has the same thing going for it, but there are at least good arguments with them (you need to authenticate to download the patch or installer, but you are free after it. So it is probably as light as DRM gets). With Steam, not so much, as it IS the drm model a lot of us bitched about for most of the late 00s and early 10s.  I dunno, maybe I am just old fashioned, but I would have figured it would be a no brainer that requiring an internet connection and authentication to install and patch a game is DRM, but apparently it somehow isn't.  Or, more likely, we are back to the ""DRM is what I don't like"" definition that was so popular back when folk liked Stardock and we started to realize we were losing the war. Rather than admit that The Evil Publishers won/we may have overreacted just a whee bit by going for an all or nothing line in the sand, we just changed the definition to have incredibly convoluted exceptions for stuff we like/tolerate. So rather than say ""I am okay with the level of DRM that is in FOO"" it became ""FOO is not DRM because it only dials home once every twenty runs. Clearly DRM begins at once every 19"". Or the especially hilarious ""It isn't DRM because I can bypass it with a crack"" that I saw a few times."

pcgaming,3d6x5k,guma822,3,Tue Jul 14 12:48:02 2015 UTC,Exactly it was a rootkit.
pcgaming,3d6x5k,In-nox,0,Tue Jul 14 15:53:42 2015 UTC,"Which falls into the shitware category. On principle, I don't want that shit and I passed on/pirated a lot of starforce games. But do we have actual performance data on its impact? Did the driver/rootkit ACTUALLY hurt performance to any meaningful degree?  I remember those rumors, but that was also around the time people said Steam was horrible because it used up too many system resources even though we all had Firefox open for gchat and probably winamp for music."
pcgaming,3d6x5k,Gundato,5,Tue Jul 14 17:52:04 2015 UTC,"On the performance side, I really don't think denuvo has much effect over how well the game runs. I've played Battlefield Hardline and Dragon Age Inquisition both on an SSD and they both ran fantastically. Even Batman Arkham Knight is completely playable after capping the fps at 60.  I don't see the point in hopping on a ""Don't buy games with denuvo"" circlejerk when at least for now there doesn't seem to be any major sign of it hurting anyone."
pcgaming,3d6x5k,ninjyte,7,Tue Jul 14 03:01:49 2015 UTC,"Denovo is complex, which is why it there have only been buggy cracks for the games it ""protects"". Basically how it exactly works, isn't really known, the cracks don't work well for everyone and the crack .exe's are for specific cpu vendors. Its thought that the Denuvo drm creates keys for the specific hardware that expire like every 24 hours. After 24 hours, Denuvo has to create a new key, these are 128 bit keys, not 64 bit like the Wiki article states, and they are unique to your hardware. Meanwhile through different layers of software, Denuvo has to report to the other DRM client, that ""Yes, this is the correct computer. Check again in 15 minutes"". Typically this results in high cpu usage.  They have denied this, but that seems to be how it works. So all these read writes harm SSD's, thats the big thing."
pcgaming,3d6x5k,In-nox,2,Tue Jul 14 01:14:25 2015 UTC,Here's a screenie I made just for this post.  It's not even close to being harmful to ssd's

pcgaming,3d6x5k,In-nox,7,Tue Jul 14 03:32:31 2015 UTC,The game ran for almost half an hour.  The inclusion of the log was to prove that it's not constant writing at all.  A typical SSD is good for at least 72 TB write (first gen). At this rate it would take over a 1000 years to kill a ssd with this game.

I guarantee you within a few years there will be all sorts of info about Denuvo that hits the web, and proves it is damaging. Just the way it would have to work in order to accomplish its task means it is sucking away cpu power. I don't own Dragon Age, but my guess is that the cpu usage is hidden from the process itsself, maybe even the read-write cycles.The buggy cracks worked by taking a memory dump right after the game had loaded, then forcing the crack.exe to run from that point. It only worked on manufacturer specific chips, so different cracked exe's were needed based on your setup. I don't exactly know how to explain this in laymen terms, but there is no possible way that this extra layer of DRM had no effect on performance. It just isn't possible."

Now, had it not been true, why would EA even settle? They settled because there was a strong case against them, their lawyers know that shall the case have been opened, it could easily get out of hand. Securom itself had the ability to hide itself from the system, prevent its activity being monitored, the ability to stop other programs from running shall it decide they can interrupt with game or itself, and the ability to not open the game if it sees that something in your hard drive could be used to copy the game. You need to open the command line to remove the thing from your system.    And don't think that accepting terms and conditions allows them anything illegal. For instance, if you sign something that declares you a slave, that agreement is invalid."

pcgaming,3d6x5k,jschild,2,Tue Jul 14 01:22:18 2015 UTC,"Mostly because of false rumors. Denuvo is actually the first form of protection that doesn't seem to affect the user in any way. It's an anti-temper that obstructs certain parts of the code and makes it harder to crack the game. So it targets cracking groups and not the users.  There was a rumor that it writes enormous amounts of data (40GB per minute or something crazy like that) which would speed up the degradation process of your SSD. It didn't make any sense from the start, because if that was the case the game would be unplayable on a normal HDD. It was also debunked by numerous third party sites since then.  There were also rumors about it causing performance issues in Lords of the Fallen, but DA:I and Fifa 15 run fine, so it can just be poor programming on LoTF part. Seems like just another outrage with no proof whatsoever.  If I recall correctly it wasn't really cracked, but they managed to ""convince"" it that the copy was legal by having another tempering software run on top of it.

So minority bitches about it, claiming DRM that works, to be a huge problem.  That's pretty much it. I haven't experienced any performance issues with Denuvo, but I HAVE noticed that on torrent sites, it takes them forever to get a working crack (and as a developer, I spend a lot of time trolling torrent sites with false torrents of my games).  So the drama you see is from mostly pirates. I am sure there are a FEW people with actual issues because of DRM, but like I said, minority. They scream the loudest online."
pcgaming,3d6x5k,ExeKution,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:06:21 2015 UTC,"Basically, it's the internet jumping at ghosts. Denuvo is a form of encryption that executes at runtime, making the game unplayable if someone pirates it. Someone on the steam forums claimed that their SSD was killed by Lords of the Fallen's Denuvo, then accused it of taking up CPU cycles and hurting performance. People already hated DRM, so it didn't take much to have people grab their pitchforks and jump on the ""Denuvo is literally Hitler"" bandwagon.  I don't like DRM at all, I think it's a waste of time that burdens the consumer to give stockholders a false sense of security against ""pirates"". But there is no evidence that Denuvo causes any actual performance or SSD problems aside from random forum posts."

pcgaming,3d7z3h,deeefoo,18,Tue Jul 14 05:39:20 2015 UTC,"A good console-to-PC port is one that can take advantage of a PC's more powerful hardware. The entire point of owning a gaming PC is to have a better experience than what console gamers can get. Why should we be happy with a game that runs just like the console version if we have hardware that can make it look and run ten times better? Parity between console and PC versions is at best, the bare minimum of what should be expected and at worst, an insult to PC gamers."
pcgaming,3d7z3h,Klaw117,-9,Tue Jul 14 05:59:14 2015 UTC,"No offense, but wouldn't that just be asking for special treatment? I know that some developers will go above and beyond for the PC versions, but that's just extra. Some developers just make an identical version for the PC, that plays just like the console version, and still get criticized for it. But isn't that what equality across platforms is? Please explain to me if I'm not understanding, I'm new to PC gaming, thanks."
pcgaming,3d7z3h,Klaw117,10,Tue Jul 14 06:07:31 2015 UTC,"This attitude isn't exclusive to PC gamers. We're just louder about it because there's so many of us. PlayStation 4 owners expect a better looking version than the Xbox One version of the same game because the PS4 has better hardware than the XB1. If it's ok for PS4 owners to want a better version, it would be hypocritical to deny PC gamers the same desire."
pcgaming,3d7z3h,Klaw117,-9,Tue Jul 14 06:17:11 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with the console owners desiring it either, there really is not point. For me, the ideal solution for console to PC ports is to have the same game quality across all platforms. That way, no one is being treated better than the other, and they all get to enjoy the game the same way, in the way the developer intended it to. Is that too idealistic?"
pcgaming,3d7z3h,Klaw117,8,Tue Jul 14 06:21:41 2015 UTC,"That's not idealistic, that's detrimental to the industry as a whole. The majority of high-profile games are multiplatform. By forcing parity with consoles, that restricts the performance of the majority of the most popular games on the market. With the majority of high-profile developers focusing on the weakest console, there will be less innovation. Many of the most influential changes in the industry occurred on the PC. By taking away the focus on PC, you lose a lot of innovation."
pcgaming,3d7z3h,Klaw117,-1,Tue Jul 14 06:45:40 2015 UTC,"I see. So you're saying that games should always be developed for the greatest common denominator first (in this case the PC), and then re-adjusted for consoles accordingly afterward? Would that be the ideal situation?"
pcgaming,3d7z3h,Radioactive_Zebra,3,Tue Jul 14 06:50:36 2015 UTC,"I dunno if that's the right way to put it. While PC games should be superior, I don't want console gamers to feel like they were cheated out of a good game.  In my opinion, gameplay shouldn't have more than a few minor differences among versions. Otherwise, you might as well make completely separate products, or just focus on one platform. However, graphical innovation is primarily driven by the PC because the open nature of PCs allows players to push the limits of the game and their hardware.  Also, keep in mind that an acceptable resolution for console gamers looks a lot worse on the PC. This is because PC gamers generally sit closer to the screen. It's much easier for us to see problems resulting from running a game at a lower resolution than our monitors' native resolution. That's why better graphics on the PC is such an important requirement. Then this need for better graphics drives research and development at AMD and Nvidia. Our games today wouldn't look nearly as good as they do now if all graphical innovation was driven only by consoles."
pcgaming,3d7z3h,Klaw117,-1,Tue Jul 14 07:10:50 2015 UTC,"So it's okay for gameplay to be consistent across the board? Would framerate fall under gameplay or graphics?  And I completely understand your point about PC graphics having to be better since the screen is closer, it makes a lot of sense.  So if the gameplay and controls were identical, then the only thing that needs to be re-adjusted for PC is framerate and resolution?"
pcgaming,3d7z3h,mdnpascual,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:19:44 2015 UTC,"Consistency in gameplay is acceptable. Controls should not be identical though because not every PC gamer has a console-equivalent gamepad. Controls on a good PC port should take the keyboard and mouse into account. Frame rate is mostly a graphics issue, though it has effects on gameplay in fast-paced games like FPS games. That's why cross-platform play is generally a bad idea with FPS games. With other games though, frame rate differences aren't that big of a deal unless frame rates drop so low that the game becomes unplayable.  Basically, it's usually the graphics and controls that need to be modified to make a good port. Some well-regarded ports like Valkyria Chronicles are just a nicer looking version of the console version. Of course, ports that take advantage of the PC's more open nature by adding things like mod support will be even more positively received, but a port that at least lets us take advantage of our more powerful hardware by modifying the graphics and controls is acceptable."
pcgaming,3d7z3h,mdnpascual,0,Tue Jul 14 07:50:44 2015 UTC,"But essentially you're paying the same price for the same game. However, PC gamers get more features, but are still paying the same price?"

Even though I don't care about graphics that much, I still want as much graphical options to be able to enable/disable for a game to be a decent port.  A definition of a good pc port for me is when a game is very scalable to a wide variety of PC hardware. From integrated graphics 720p stuff, low to high end discreet graphics, up to multi-gpu setups.  Oh don't forget proper kb/m controls and support up to 144hz monitors."
pcgaming,3d7z3h,dadoprso,0,Tue Jul 14 19:10:20 2015 UTC,"Controls are something that I didn't account for, since I own a gamepad, but yeah proper keyboard and mouse support is a must.  When I started to play games on PC, I got the notion that PC gamers were striving hard to be treated equally to console gamers by game companies. As such, shouldn't console games be consistent across all platforms, including PC? Is that not the case anymore?"
pcgaming,3d7z3h,JackRyan13,8,Tue Jul 14 06:10:21 2015 UTC,"Most of the ""ported"" games that I played are always above the console versions, just from graphic options stuff alone so I'm not sure what to say about these ""equal"" stuff. I'm not that desperate to beg publishers to port their exclusives to PC to sign a petition.  AC games from ubisoft are already above console counterparts just from graphics and draw distance, it was just an uptomized buggy piece of shit that isn't scaleable that made it bad.  WB games has a good track record on optimization and it's the reason why a lot of people are all outraged on how they fucked up badly on B:AK  Most of the games I really don't care right now are mostly from japanese publishers. Namely Bamco and KOEI. They like to squeeze money and we pc gamers are not used to that.  Bamco - Dark souls 2 DX11 Paid patch KOEI - All ported games are subpar and fucking expensive"
pcgaming,3d7z3h,JackRyan13,-2,Tue Jul 14 06:14:46 2015 UTC,"I agree about the pricing for Koei games, it's too much.    But Toukiden was locked at 30fps for both the PS4 and the PC, but only the PC gamers are complaining about the port. Should they not be directing their anger at the game itself, since the issues are shared across the board?"
pcgaming,3d7z3h,daviejambo,5,Tue Jul 14 06:37:43 2015 UTC,"This is why it is very important for ported games to be scaleable. Toukiden should hire companies that port games specifically.   An example of a recent good port was Valkyria Chronicles. I didn't know this franchise at all but when I read that the port was excellent, I bought it @ day 1. Sega even said that their sales expectations were blown away.  It even worked for all resolution up to 8k and 144hz. It just had the minor physics glitch when you tried to play the game above 60hz and it was patched pretty fast."
pcgaming,3d7z3h,PPTTBgB,2,Tue Jul 14 06:42:55 2015 UTC,"The reason pc gamers get possed is because everyone getting 30 fps isnt pcs being treated equally.

Thats why something locked to 30 fps is a bad port. Consoles cant do any better, pcs can."
pcgaming,3d7z3h,PPTTBgB,10,Tue Jul 14 06:53:41 2015 UTC,"shouldn't console games be consistent across all platforms, including PC?   We should not hold back the potential of our platform because of consoles."

pcgaming,3d7z3h,Discoteca,13,Tue Jul 14 06:38:29 2015 UTC,Because we paid more money to get a better experience. We do not accept anything less than 1080p60fps. That is the standard of PC gaming. It's not our fault console gamers don't have standards so we shouldn't be punished by gamers who don't know any better.
pcgaming,3d7z3h,XXLpeanuts,3,Tue Jul 14 06:40:19 2015 UTC,"Games are generally cheaper on PC. The game developer does not make money based on hardware sales. Also, there are computers that cost less than consoles."
pcgaming,3d7z3h,XXLpeanuts,-17,Tue Jul 14 06:41:21 2015 UTC,"And you do get that better experience, from all the PC exclusives that were designed with the platform in mind and that really take advantage of the hardware. However, why should we expect console developers to match those standards? Why not enjoy the game in the way they intended it to be enjoyed in? They designed it, so they know the best way to enjoy it, and they designed the game with that in mind."
pcgaming,3d7z3h,XXLpeanuts,18,Tue Jul 14 19:21:46 2015 UTC,"They designed it, so they know the best way to enjoy it, and they designed the game with that in mind.   This line right here just screams brain washed. Devs don't think it's best to play their games at lower resolutions and capped 30FPS frame rates. That sort of horse shit gets thrown at console gamers because it gets eaten up and believed so they have an excuse to hide behind when their game doesn't perform as promised. Games should never be played at anything less than the standard that PC gamers hold.  Say that you were right and devs think that we should play their games at a subpar resolution and subpar framerates, being PC gamers means we get the choice and the ability to choose how we want to play our games. If games are ported to PC with an FPS/Resolution cap, we should have the option and ability to remove those as we see fit. Games that don't have that option or limit the way we want to play our games are seen as a bad port for a good reason."
pcgaming,3d7z3h,Rubykuby,2,Tue Jul 14 06:48:24 2015 UTC,"So stuff like 30fps and resolution locks are results of developers not being able to reach their expected outcome in the performance of a game, and they just use my above sentiment as an excuse. I'm starting to get it now, thanks for pulling me from that brainwash lol.  BTW, how did the standard that PC gamers hold come to be, if you know? Is 1080 the standard right now, or is it 4k? 1080p is still acceptable right? My monitor is 1080p, that's why 1080p caps on games escape my attention. 60fps+ is a given, since even some like me who used to own only consoles knows that 60fps looks and feels better."
pcgaming,3d7z3h,baalroo,4,Tue Jul 14 06:53:48 2015 UTC,"1080P is the standard, 4k will be but not for some time yet."

pcgaming,3d7z3h,XXLpeanuts,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:23:30 2015 UTC,There are very few games with frame rate caps or resolution caps. People like moaning but the fact is 99% of PC games run 1080p 60fps at the very least and the vast majority of them you can change the settings to have the game run at whatever resolution you like
pcgaming,3d7z3h,XXLpeanuts,3,Tue Jul 14 07:29:21 2015 UTC,"Developers have fewer limitations for the PC version of their game(s), so why would they develop their intended version of their game on the system which has more limitations?"
pcgaming,3d7z3h,XXLpeanuts,2,Tue Jul 14 09:16:42 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, I wonder why they do that. Ideally, all games would be developed for and optimized for PC, and then re-adjusted for consoles accordingly right? So then why don't they do that already if it's so obvious?"
pcgaming,3d7z3h,baalroo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:55:03 2015 UTC,"Because that would still mean developing two versions of the game.   The difference would be that instead making just one platform wait for the game, there would be two or three platforms waiting for the game which would likely have to be a remade from scratch due to consoles not being able to handle a game made entirely for PC (Like Star Citizen or ARMA.)   And that's assuming they launch at the same time, as most non ported PC versions of console games don't. If they months later on multiple consoles, then developers would miss out on a lot more money then if only the PC version launched later."

pcgaming,3d7z3h,badboyz1256,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:58:25 2015 UTC,"If the games as they were released was the way they were intended to be enjoyed then developers wouldn't feel the need to improve things when they release remasters.  The framerate and lower resolutions are the result of the limitations of the device as opposed to it being the vision of the developers. Obviously a developer isn't going to advertise that they had to make concessions, since it's in their best interest to promote the positives of the game to try and move product. But, isn't it interesting how when it comes to remasters how they suddenly increase the fps from 30 to 60 as opposed to just increasing the resolution? The new framerate becomes a selling point to actually try and convince people to buy the old title when before the argument was that fps didn't matter. For instance, God of War 3, Last of Us, and Halo MMC. Are you going to argue that The Last of Us and GTA V on the last gen were what the developers truly envisioned the game to be like? Or is the Last of Us on the PS4 and GTA V on the XB1/PS4 more representative of what the developers strove to deliver?  Also, you usually you have to wait for the next console release to be able to enjoy the game without any performance or graphical compromises. And depending on how long the current gen lasts and when/if the developer decides to remaster the title it might take a decade to be able to reexperience it without the constraints of the current gen consoles.  But, the scalability of PC settings with different hardware allows that game to be enjoyed as they would have been on better hardware right now. Another nice thing is that as your hardware improves you can increase settings on your old copy of the game to play at a higher resolution/fps if you couldn't in the past.  Meanwhile, the only way to do that on the console is to rebuy the copy of the game that takes advantage of the power of the new console. And well...when you suddenly introduce that locked down experience to a PC people won't be to happy. It's understandable for the console, since there isn't some more powerful variant of it out there, but when it comes to the PC that isn't the case."
pcgaming,3d7z3h,Bruhmis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:50:46 2015 UTC,"Games are made on PCs. When you mentioned pc players were striving for equality, what we were actually striving for was equal treatment and development (And now there is no excuse not to given PC sales are just as much as the consoles). There is no need for games that are to be released on all platforms to be designed for consoles, consoles are low spec (locked hardware wise) PCs now more than ever, you can design for PC and scale the graphics/performance for consoles. And designing like that is a lot easier than making it for a particular console then scaling it and porting it to PC.

pcgaming,3d7z3h,Xander471,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:56:23 2015 UTC,"That was the case for the old consoles, but unless you made it x64 only on PC I see no reason why you could not port it to consoles easier than porting it to PC. Yes there are differences, but not enough to make it need to be re-designed from the ground up. Correct me if I am wrong but that was more the case with the older generation, this new gen (and any future ones at that) are far more close to PC architecture than any before. This is even more the case with DX12 on the horizon."

If this gen is closer to PC's than ever before, why do some developers still port the last-gen versions of their game to PC? (namely Japanese developers, looking at you Koei). It should be easier to port from PS4 since they're so similar right? It still baffles me."

PC is superior to console in every way and if a game does not reflect this (i.e. supports higher resolutions, better graphics, controls, multiple screens, higher fov, potential for mods etc) then it is a bad port.   The worst ports are those that are completely on par with consoles. And once in a while one will come along (Arkham Knight for instance) which is worse and there is simply no excuse for this. Parity is simply the last thing we want as PC gamers. 30 fps? When your system can run the game at 144fps, do you understand how that is not acceptable."

pcgaming,3d7z3h,Xander471,5,Tue Jul 14 21:37:10 2015 UTC,"Because as others have pointed out it doesnt take much to scale a game for PC if you develop it right (and the only sane way, for PC first and scale down for consoles). And because PC gaming is about having options, people build their own pcs for a reason. In reality console gaming should not even exist, it purely exists because of marketing and exclusives (that are pushed by the console developers and hurt gaming as a whole). There is literally no upside to it other than there are exclusives (which is a self defeating argument). - note this was not always the case, but the new generation confirms this completely  The better question would be why do people still game on closed systems and pay for online play, higher game prices (due to development taxes on console) and inferior everything.   I understand your question but honestly it makes more sense to ask why do consoles get less, because without them gaming would be at a much higher quality level across the board. And the reasons as to why console doesnt get more (features/performance/options) are far more eye opening and important to gaming.   But either way the truth is PC deserves more because its capable of more, and if you can imagine being in the mind of a game developer, your game is your baby, its you creation, you love it right, so why would you not want it to reach its full potential. I can assure you most if not all devs feel this way and the only thing that stops them making better PC versions is lack of time/money or cash incentives given to them by microsoft/sony."

But they're console ports, so I was wondering where to set my expectations. I don't want to set them too high, since then I might just be disappointed and sad with everything in the end (they're Japanese games, and Japanese devs seem to know poop about the PC). But I still wanted some kind of minimum quality for the port. Since the definitive version of the game is on PS4, that's where I set my expectations."

They surprised everyone with that I think. And more often than not when they release a ""definitive"" edition on consoles it just bumps up a few settings and content that was already available in the PC version, or that quite often the PC version surpasses anyway.  As hopefully has been explained there isnt much improvement needed to a PC release because they usually scale so well if you come back to a game a few years on you can just max it (mod the graphics to be even higher than in game max) and bump the res to 4k (which is what I am doing with all my older games currently, and it looks amazing). Not to mention I would count higher resolution and 60-144fps to be far more ""definitive"" than some extra Ambient Occlusion and 30 fps 1080p or something."

pcgaming,3d7z3h,Propertinny,10,Tue Jul 14 05:47:03 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I see you're getting a lot of downvotes, while you're asking a lot of very valid questions very politely.  All things equal, the gameplay should be the same across platforms. That being said, things like graphics and performance should be better on our end for those of us who have the rigs that power it.  For example, the ULTRA specs for Arkham Knight on PC are for playing the game at 30 FPS at 1920x1080p.  The specs are: Processor: Intel Core i7-3770, 3.4 GHz (~$300) | AMD FX-8350, 4.0 GHz ($200) Memory: 8 GB RAM ($50) Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 ($500) Graphics Memory: 4 GB  The graphics card to play at the same performance as consoles costs more than the console itself. This is poor optimization on the port to PC, and the game is even missing graphical features. There is also zero reason to limit framerate performance except for lazy programming.  When Dead or Alive 5 ported to PC, they ported using a mix of the PS3 game and the PS4 game instead of using all the features in the PS4 version. This is a bad port.  When Dark Souls 1 ported to PC, it was limited to 720p resolution and 30fps, because that's how it played on PS3 and Xbox360. It also had crap KB+M support. If you've ever set a high end monitor (i.e. 1440p) to a lower resolution, you'll find that monitors tend to do horrible at displaying resolutions other than their native.  To sum it up, I think the bare minimum for most is that the port:   Allows for portraying the game at monitor's native resolution, without a framerate cap. Has support for KB+M, with proper rebinding support A range of toggle-able graphics options since PCs have inherently different hardware. No generic (Low, Medium, or High) setting that doesn't let you fine tune specific things. Optimized well enough that you don't need a twice as expensive rig to get even similar to console performance.   Other people can add on, but the main frustration is, that the console port shouldn't run the same or worse on a PC that's significantly more powerful. If they aren't going to offer us better textures, then at a bare minimum, they need to offer native resolution support and an unlocked framerate cap, and if they do lock it, then at least at 60 FPS."

Obviously we're not asking that.  We're asking that if you're going to demand high end specs, don't give us the same performance from a console that barely reaches 1080p and 30 fps on titles. That's just lazy development.  The lower end has to have a limit. When developers make games, they tend to come up with high, medium, and low textures for Level of Detail reasons, i.e. the closer you are to something, the higher fidelity its rendered. If you substitute in all the lower fidelity assets, the system that can run this stably should be considered your ""Minimum Requirements.""  Anything below that is icing on the cake.

pcgaming,3d7z3h,HawkEye0,4,Tue Jul 14 21:50:59 2015 UTC,"PC gamers want games that are functional and make use of the superior hardware that PCs are capable of housing. A PC port should never be equal to consoles. In fact, even Rockstar knows this because they delayed the PC port of Grand Theft Auto V for several months for QA.  There's a lot of good PC ports and a lot of bad ones, but for the sake of argument, here's what I consider important to a good PC port:   No framerate cap; acceptable to the end user, if optional (to maintain consistent framerate, or using VSync) Functions as well or possibly better than the console version (i.e. quicker loading times) Multiple graphics settings, such as anti-aliasing, texture filtering, resolution, and FOV slider Keyboard and mouse support, along with gamepad support (some ports don't do K&M very well) To reiterate, a plethora of resolution options, up to at least 1080p, preferably beyond (1440p, 4K, etc.) SLI and CrossFire support (multi-GPU configurations; a consumer-friendly option that is frequently overlooked in games) Windowed and fullscreen modes Rebindable inputs for keyboard and mouse, and possibly (but not necessarily) controller   It may sound like a lot, but having these features is relatively simple if developed first for PC rather than for consoles. Developing for consoles means that corners have to be cut for inferior hardware, while PC has much more flexibility due to higher performance ceilings. A PC port should never function only as well as a console port. If it does, the developer has failed. Some games don't tax hardware as much as others, but graphics settings, K&M support, multi-GPU support, and rebindable keys should always be mandatory."

Imagine your high-end $3000 (or so) pc setup has the same performance in a game as a low-end $400 pc. Would you not be disappointed? Now just replace that low-end pc with a console, it's the same thing. It doesn't matter what hardware anyone has, doesnt even matter if console or pc, everyone should expect a certain amount of performance given their setup.    I can use the same high-end/low-end example to show how your argument that, ""everyone pays the same amount for the same experience"" is flawed. Let's say the high-end pc gamer buys the same game as the low-end pc gamer. Should the high-end gamer pay more to play at 1440p 144hz? What if the low-end gamer upgrades in the future, should they have to pay extra to then unlock a better looking/smoother game after they bought the original? It doesn't matter if it's a low-end pc or a console imo.  I hope this post doesn't come off as aggressive, I didn't really mean it to. I know you're just looking for good answers.

pcgaming,3d7z3h,Demorthus,4,Tue Jul 14 09:21:08 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the minimum set of features that a game needs to be considered a good port are:   Unlimited resolution and framerate. If you're playing on an LCD monitor, having to upscale the game will just make everything look like ass, so everyone should be able to play at their native resolution. If your hardware is powerful enough to run the game at X fps, then it should run at X fps and not capped at something lower than that. Even a 60fps cap isn't good enough today, considering how popular 120+Hz monitors are getting. If game engines from the 90s could do these two things, there's no excuse why games released today shouldn't be able to achieve that.  Fully rebindable controls. Bonus points if buttons that were context-sensitive in the console version (due to the lack of buttons on a controller) can be split into multiple different buttons, one for each type of action. Oh and you should be able to bind mouse4 and mouse5, those are pretty much standard on today's mice.  When it comes to mouse settings, there should be no forced mouse acceleration. An option to turn acceleration on/off in settings is fine too. I also expect a full range of mouse sensitivity values. A slider with 10 discrete sensitivity levels is just not enough. With that kind of a slider, it's inevitable that one option will be too slow and the next one too fast. Or even worse, all of the options will be too fast. If there's a sensitivity slider in the options menu, it should cover a wide range of values (to cover the tastes of both high sens and low sens players) and offer fine-grained control. Ideally, just give me an option to input an arbitrary floating point value so that I can multiply the sensitivity by any amount l want. If your game has this in the options menu, that's pretty much the best, but even an option to change the multiplier in a .ini file is a lot better than nothing. I'm not making such a big deal out of sensitivity because I want to tweak everything to perfection, the real issue here is that I want my sensitivity to be consistent across all games I play. If I have to move my arm exactly 25cm to make a 360° turn in game A, but the closest I can get to that in game B is 20cm/360°, I'll be unhappy about it. In that case, all the muscle memory I've gained from playing countless hours of game A will be useless in game B because I'll have to get used to a completely different level of mouse sensitivity. And if I switch between playing game A and B a lot, then my aim will always be screwed.  If it's a first person game, a reasonable FOV is a must. Anything under 90 degrees horizontal is just unacceptable for a PC game, so if the FOV has to be locked, at least pick a reasonable value. A 70 degree tunnel vision simulator will make me hate your game right from the start. Ideally there should be an option for the user to set the FOV to whatever they want.  The graphics options should be scalable to accommodate a wide range of hardware. If the only graphics options in your game are ""bloom"", ""motion blur"" and ""texture quality"", that's simply not enough. Now I'm not one of those people who expects the developers to make the PC version to look 3 times better than the console one with tons of extra effects and features, in fact I'm okay with graphics that are on par with the console version. I know it's a lot of work for developers to implement extra effects, redo the models in higher detail and hand place extra detail into the game specifically for the PC version, so I don't expect them to do that. However, I DO want to be able to be able to tweak the effects that were already in the console version and have a noticeable impact on both performance and visual quality. Things like increasing or decreasing the shadow resolution, changing the draw distance, disabling certain effects that come with a big performance hit. A wide range of anti aliasing options is also nice to have. Those settings shouldn't take too much time to implement and they're nice to have because it gives even people with outdated or low end hardware a chance to play the game smoothly. On the other hand, people who have powerful hardware will be able to reach above console quality graphics. Another nice thing is, even if you can run the game maxed out at 60fps, you might still want to lower a few settings so that you can play at higher framerates."

And he misses the major point, the absolute biggest point in fact. Back when Police Quest was released they'd sell how many million copies? 0 million copies, that's how many. The gaming market has changed because a lot of people actually play games now. Call of Duty sells in gazillions of copies, DOTA is played by roughly 104% of the world's population. Why on earth should Ubisoft try to recreate the old isometric RPGs of Baldur's Gate times when they, like Divinity, will sell 1 million copies at $35 a pop? Oh that's great, says you. 1 million copies! $35 a pop? That's plenty of money! No, no it's not. Specially not when you can release a half-arsed version of Assassin's Creed for $60 a pop, double that value in DLCs and it'll sell fucking 10 million copies.   Blame the consumer, not the people exploiting it. I guarantee you, if people started to buy your excrement you wouldn't stop producing it. You'd get nicer packaging then go to your nearest Taco Bell in an attempt to produce more."

pcgaming,3d3sai,JunWasHere,10,Sat Jul 18 02:46:58 2015 UTC,"The Path of Exile 2.0 expansion is glorious.   The Lockstep networking makes the game run like a dream! Desync is a thing of the past. My personalized Item-Filter is the gift that keeps on giving! Fantastically diverse new areas in Act 4 - I particularly love the new volcanic zones. The new bosses are long-rooted in lore through item names, npc dialogue, etc. making them deliciously compelling. The fresh encounters and loot (tormented ghosts, bloodline packs, divination cards, jewels, etc..) have further enriched my end-game. The gem vendors and and gem re-balancing have made my new character experience much more enjoyable. The monster re-balancing has the game feeling more appropriately challenging! (It had grown too easy over the last year) LORE AUDIO NOW KEEPS PLAYING IF YOU MOVE AWAY FROM THEIR NODES! THE SALT, IN GLOBAL CHAT OVER RUINED BUILDS, NEVER STOPS FLOWING! XD I named my new chaos golem ""Brains""! :)   Of course, I do have some criticisms:   The final fight of Act 4 has poor colour design and a frame-rate-degrading compromising amount of visual effects (which has incited noticeable concern from the forum communities). Another fight in the new Act 4 feels abruptly cheap when encountered for the first time.  Act 4 overall was intense, but also somewhat short.  edit: Oh, and they downgraded Scion's dialogue. This brings me much sadness.   However, those are minor gripes that are dwarfed by the my positivity towards the new content and changes.    I also just finished my first run of The Wolf Among Us over half the week.  I'm quite behind the main crowd when it comes to traditional buy-and-play games, but I finally got around to this lovely title.    Needless to say, the character designs are adorably nostalgic.  For me, the story and gameplay was aptly woven together to be immersive and engaging - It felt like a reasonable investigation story and I rarely felt like the choices were too restrictive. There were a few instances where the writing of a character's response was too biased, I hope they can be a little more thorough with the dialogue in the next installment.   Overall, the series was quite enthralling. Unlike The Walking Dead, I feel a genuine motivation to replay it with a different attitude to explore the types of scenes that might unveil."

It is a relatively simple plot, the enjoyment of which being closely tied one's enjoyment of the gameplay itself.  If you're looking for a story-driven experience brought to life with riveting cutscenes, I can say Path of Exile will not suit you.  However, there is a rich foundation of lore to be experienced. These story elements exist on the peripheral of gameplay, expressed through:   reactionary dialogue from your chosen class miscellaneous NPC dialogue options in towns environment logs of which some are voiced the lore descriptions attached to numerous legendary items in the game.    And the normal difficulty, which doesn't exclude any story content, can be completed with relative ease in less than a dozen hours or a week of leisure time."

pcgaming,3d3sai,Dragonzeanse,5,Tue Jul 14 09:27:00 2015 UTC,"Call of Juarez: Gunslinger. I've only spent about an hour in this game, but the storytelling is entertaining and there's plenty of variety to the game to keep me wanting to play. The duels are pretty annoying, though, due to the deliberately crippled controls (imagine having a reticule with the worst mouse acceleration of all time).  Torchlight 2 has been another game I've been having fun with. I got two people together, one who isn't primarily a PC gamer, and we burned through the game in about three nights. We decided to give New Game+ a shot, as well. I don't think it's as good as many of its fans consider it to be, but given that it was released when people were incredibly bitter towards Diablo 3, its reputation is probably deserved."
pcgaming,3d3sai,ProfessorStupidCool,4,Mon Jul 13 22:19:44 2015 UTC,"Call of Juarez: Gunslinger   If I recall, the duels get more interesting, but yeah, the controls are annoying.  The game as a whole is great, it's actually a pretty solid FPS, and while it's linear, later levels have branches and more variety, so it gets better and better."
pcgaming,3d3sai,Dragonzeanse,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:35:32 2015 UTC,"They definitely get more interesting when they start adding a speed mechanic on top of the focus.

pcgaming,3d3sai,Natemiester,3,Tue Jul 14 04:53:22 2015 UTC,"Dirty Bomb- a really fun class-based shooter. Each class has a unique ability, but all are viable fighters, unlike, say, the medic in TF2.

pcgaming,3d3sai,CognitioCupitor,3,Sun Jul 19 21:59:45 2015 UTC,"Dominions 4: Thrones of Ascension  I was recently convinced to get this game after talking to someone in an /r/Games thread and reading a PC Gamer diary about it.   It is a low-budget turn-based strategy game (originally released on Desura) in which you play as one of a number of pretender gods vying for the vacant place of the old High God.  Your goal is to capture enough of the Thrones of Ascension scattered around the map to assume ultimate power.  The map is divided into provinces, which have population, produce resources, and buildings.  There are a whole lot of different factions based off of an eclectic mixture of mythology, literature, and folkore from around the world, ranging from Lovecraft to Ancient Egypt to Viking Scandinavia. With that said, the game is fiendishly complicated.  When your army enters battle, what it does is dependent upon how you arranged the different units' and what you decided their battle doctrine to be- i.e. Attack, Defend Commander, Hold, etc.  There is a vast magic system in which you use sorcerers to research tiers of different schools of magic to get new, more powerful spells that can affect the world itself at late tiers.  There is a deep crafting system in which you make weapons, charms, and armor for your commanders.  You can build upgradable fortresses, fund province garrisons, and a ton more, and so far I feel like I'm playing extremely badly.  I haven't played a whole lot, but I've found it to be very addicting, and I recommend it to people who want to play a complicated but interesting strategy game.    Crusader Kings II  I've been playing Paradox games for a long time, and I recently started playing CKII again.  For those who may not know, Crusader Kings II is a grand strategy game made by Swedish developer Paradox Interactive in which you control a ruler in a medieval dynasty.  The gameplay is very deep and lends itself perfectly to roleplaying and deep emergent stories, since the game simulates the lives of tens of thousands of people, each of whom have desires, characteristics, family, etc.  I've played two files recently, the first one of which I ragequit because of how annoying to play Elective Gavelkind (a type of succession law) is (I used the Khazaria Charlemagne start, for those who might want to know).  The second file was an old one I never finished, in which I formed England from the Ducky of Mercia.  Right now I'm trying to form the Empire of Britannia, but it's slow going finding claimants and fabricating claims on Irish and Scottish provinces.  I've just typed a ton, so I'm going to try to wrap it up: CKII is an amazing game and I recommend it wholeheartedly to strategy game fans, although it will probably feel overwhelming if you haven't played a Paradox game before.    PS- It's funny remembering that I felt the same way when I started playing CKII that I do with Dominions 4 now, but it also gives me hope that I'll figure out Dominions."
pcgaming,3d3sai,_GORDONN_,3,Mon Jul 13 08:35:38 2015 UTC,"Battleblock Theatre  Picked it up for a couple of friends in the Steam sales for about a $1 each. It's a cartoony, platform puzzler made by the same people that made Castle Crashers.  Pros:    Hilarious dialogue, combined with a cartoony art style. Complex levels, that sometimes require you to think outside the box. You can choose to get all the gems before ending, or just get the bare minimum to complete the level. A selection of character models and weapons keep things interesting. You have to collect gems and yarn to unlock each, so it gives you a reason to actually complete missions. Replay Value: Level Editor, Community Levels, and Multiplayer game types mean it's hard to run out of things to do.   Cons:   Can't play 4 way co-op in the story mode.

The Swapper  Instance-based puzzle platformer with a map and a story. I don't think i've seen another puzzle platformer do that before. The story is pretty trippy and makes you think. The puzzles are well puzzles, some are hard and others are easy. It was an enjoyable experience even though I had to cheat 2 or 3 times.  The Novelist  A game about making hard decisions for a couple and their son. It was a great learning experience I suppose.

This was very disappointing. Good to start, bad to finish. Plague Inc.. apparently to unlock things so that the missions can be completed without trying many many many times I need to play the game many many many times. It was fun for an hour or two. Yay for the Neurax Worm Worship. DoorKickers. So it was good, until I realized the RNG in the background. No real point either. Defense Grid 2. Finished that but the sheer lack of towers and the sheer lack of actual plot was a bit tiresome, but the options were nice. Consortium. It was good sure, until I realized that my having watched it on YouTube essentially made it so, despite a FEW THINGS changing in subsequent play throughs where I made different choices, that I really didn't need to play it. And a couple others.   I really do not like how short or how meaningless it seems indies are, in terms of those that still have a degree of graphical application to them to make them seem.. well not from 15 years ago.

pcgaming,3d3sai,ProfessorStupidCool,3,Sun Jul 19 15:20:21 2015 UTC,"Cities Skylines: I'd been wanting this game for a while, and I grabbed it during the summer sale.  I hadn't really seriously played a city builder since Sim City 2000.  This really hits the spot, and feels the way I would want a ""modern"" sim city to feel.  I was in the mood for a new builder when the SC reboot was announced, but the always online and week 2 reviews steered me away.  Finally scratching that itch.  Dishonored: I had never really been interested in Dishonored as I prefer stealth in a modern setting, and I don't really like steampunk as an aesthetic.  Discussing this year's E3 with a friend, they heavily recommended Dishonored when the sequel trailer came up.  I gave it a shot, and I'm glad, the controls make it my favorite stealth game, the art style is great, and the setting doesn't contain any of the negative thematic elements I associate with steampunk.  Payday 2 When I read about payday 1 (and later 2), I generally ignored them because of the premise and presentation.  With over half of my friends list being filled with players of the game, and multiple different recommends, I gave it a go.  The pacing of leveling up is brilliant.  The game loop is very satisfying and when you have good teamwork, it really shines.  On the other hand, with bad teamwork it can be frustrating."
pcgaming,3d3sai,Natemiester,2,Mon Jul 13 23:48:29 2015 UTC,Interesting. What negative thematic elements do you associate with steampunk?
pcgaming,3d3sai,ProfessorStupidCool,7,Tue Jul 14 14:36:52 2015 UTC,"Haughty Victorian accents, arbitrary cogs and machinery stuck to things without sense or reason, lazy technological theming that presumes the audience won't question the self-consistency of the world, and a baffling fan base that actively endorses these components to such a degree that they glue gears and brass nick-knacks to cheap facsimiles of victorian clothing.    To me, steampunk appears to be all aesthetic, no substance.  It's a genre that doesn't reward the observer for asking ""why""; indeed, asking why about any of its elements causes the whole thing to collapse, because there are no thematic solutions to its own problems.    e.g: Q: Why does that top hat have gears on it? A: The gears run a mechanism inside the hat. Q: What is the mechanism's power source? A: A magic crystal that holds a charge like a battery. Q: Wouldn't a hat filled with brass machinery be too heavy to comfortably wear? A: You don't understand the aesthetic!"

pcgaming,3d3sai,JestinMask,2,Wed Jul 15 02:30:57 2015 UTC,"The 7th Guest + The 11th Hour. Both really old point and click puzzle games. Pretty cheesy and some of the puzzles are unbeatable, for instance the microscope puzzle in the 7th Guest which gets harder the better your PC is.   Adam's Venture episode 1, only took me 84 minutes to finish. Didn't really enjoy it either and was kind of boring.   Age of Empires II and III. First time playing either of these, I believe the second is better than the third. Just had a game on it this morning, got myself 30 champions, several chu no ku and a couple scorpions. I went to attack someone, got a couple steps outside my place and within 10 seconds was mobbed by countless mobbed attackers.  Alan Wake. I dislike horror games because I'm a giant shit bag. However I just finished this. It kept me on edge constantly but what terrified me the most was the voices. They should really fix the sound issue with cutscenes being so much louder. I enjoyed it regardless however even if someone spoilt the whole story for me last year.  Amazing Spiderman. Mixed reviews on steam, despite that I finished the game. It was horrible and kept crashing. Combat is similar to Batman but that's the only thing I thought was okay. The jokes were pretty hit and miss and didn't really find any of them funny.  Amazing Spiderman 2. Sequel to the one listed above. This one was marginally worse and this time they managed to fuck it up even more. With web swinging never working and the hero system which forces you to fight crime or the law will attack you. Maybe Spiderman is out with a cold and he missed a day? Ever think of that before you start shooting him?  S.T.A.L.K.E.R SoC. A really lonely and atmospheric game. Can be difficult but I enjoy it. Creepy as all hell though. However such is life in the zone  Titan Quest. Similar to Diablo but with Greek mythology. What more could you want?"

pcgaming,3d3sai,bobrath,2,Wed Jul 15 05:31:42 2015 UTC,Thanks. Any tips are welcome.   Here's a list of things that I now know that I screwed up in my first play through - * didn't plan base with adjacency bonus in mind. * didn't make enough satellites. * didn't realise that your interceptors need to be upgraded to shoot down UFOs. * didn't realise the value of engineers.  Questions that I have: * I've already lost USA and China. Should I abandon this play through and start my second game? * How do months work in Xcom? How do they affect the game? * Should I ditch EU and just play EW instead?
pcgaming,3d3sai,forerunner398,2,Wed Jul 15 05:42:16 2015 UTC,"I would say restart and play EW, more alien enemies, and a human enemy faction (they have snipers and rockets and can go up to laser tech later on, hehehe)  and more toys like MECS  and genemods for you to use. Try to get one or two sats a month. As you upgrade to higher tech weapons, make sure you try to get anti air weapons. Every month, new enemies appear till around september. On abduction missions, try to get as many engineers you need to get the next uplink then focus on scientists. Have a panic strategy, so choose a country that you want to put a sat over and unless they have needed engineers you avoid them for abductions so that you can reduce the panic of the countries with no satellite. A good starting bonus is either Europe or Africa. Once you beat Enemy Within on Classic and Normal, move onto Long War mod. Please reply if you need more clarification.   Edit: Try planning you base layout, put all your sats in the same area, put your power generators near eachother etc.  Edit: If you see a Chrysallid, SHOOT IT, BURN IT, PUNCH IT (MEC Trooper) GRENADE IT, Just do not let it eat civvies and make more of itself"

So well-written and acted (I can't believe the guy who played Quark was Andrew Ryan!).   Prime World: Defenders - A surprisingly solid tower defence game. The ability to fuse and evolve cards adds a lot of incentive to replay maps, and there's a good variety of enemies and towers.   Murdered: Soul Suspect - Has its moments. The combat is awful, but it's reasonably well written (even the cliches can be written off as part of the noirish vibe) and the detective aspects have flashes of inspiration - they're better than LA Noire in some respects.  Team Fortress 2 - Got back into this for the Gun Mettle update. The contracts add a bit of challenge and variety, the new maps are interesting and aside from a few dickhead players (the reason why I much prefer sticking to single-player) it's been fun."

The art style is really off-putting to me, but I suppose that's more of a personal problem.  While the combat system of health as damage seems like an interesting new take on tRpgs, pretty frequently, the AI would have some absurdly high number for their health that could completely overwhelm your character's armor and go right into their health.   Maybe a personal gripe or balance issue, but the fact that rangers (outside of one in particular) can only shoot arrows at the distance an enemy could walk seems idiotic.  The huge redeeming factor, and the reason I stuck it out despite my grievances, is the story. It's actually really good. You're basically looking for shelter in a world where nowhere is longer safe. It feels similar to FTL at times with all the decisions you have to make for yourself and your caravan.  My honest recommendation? Buy it on sale for $10 bucks, and get a nice story out of it.  P.S.

Aside from a host of issues that cropped up when the launch of the game had a bigger turnout than expected, I love it. It's a very simple MMO experience, which I like, and it has whimsical blocky charm and streamlined gameplay going for it too."

Relogic are an absolutely incredible team and this game is phenomenal. I'm sitting at 874 hours played at the moment.  Bully: Scholarship Edition - I'm on Chapter 5 now and slowly slugging through to the end of the game. I first played this when it was known as Canis Canem Edit on the PS2, and again when Scholarship Edition was released on the 360. I wish I'd stuck to Consoles for this one (Not something you'll hear me say often) the PC port is a mess. Crashes at least once an hour, no support for more than 2 channels/virtual surround without serious compromises and a draw distance that'll make you feel sick. Oh, did I mention the 30FPS lock? It's a shame, because it's one of my favourite games of all time, and when I do end up playing through it again a few years down the line I'll stick to the 360 version just for the stability."

I actually think the pacing of when the main story thread missions come in is pretty good. GW2 imo takes too long between levels to push the story along. Plus in GW2 it is glaringly obvious that it's time to do a main story quest where as in ESO its kind of laid back in telling you its time to push the narrative."

They're two games that have been gracing my backlog for quite some time and they've consistently been near the top of my ""to play"" lists, but I only just got around to it. They were both 10/10 experiences and as great as I expected them to be.   Transistor turned out being shorter than I expected, but there's always NG+ if I want to experience more of Cloudbank.   Meanwhile, I initially wrote off Wolfenstein TNO as some run of the mill shooter but after a glowing review from a friend, I decided to check it out for myself. What I got was one of the most high octane experiences that I've ever had with some of the tightest gunplay and captivating levels. The game played to its strengths very well and I'm very glad I gave it the chance it deserved.   As for what I'm playing next, I'm not really sure. I have a few games I wanna play before I start college in a month but right now I'm torn between South Park: The Stick of Truth and Life Is Strange.

I tried three times with Origin & 5 with G2A. I had the same outcome as yourself from both suppliers. I'm with Visa, and think it may be their end. Anyway I gave up in the end. Oh yea I also had this happen on another occasion when purchasing Minecraft for my nephew. Same outcome, ended up getting it from G2A a few hours later that day."

Similar problem on EA's Origin too with payment issue, but at least with GMG it seems to be random errors, whilst Origin simply doesn't accept there's a problem and it happens to most Visa Debits there."
pcgaming,3d8q5e,toxictaliban111,3,Tue Jul 14 11:44:46 2015 UTC,Well I'm from the States and this was a MasterCard. The problem wasn't so much that it was declining my card. The problem was that it was telling me my credit card didn't work yet the charge was showing up on my credit card statement as authorized. I mean it seems they're trying to fix the problem but there's definitely something wrong with their billing right now. While I was on the phone with my cc rep they told me the charges were going from authorized to declined back to authorized. They were the ones who informed me they're probably having issues with their billing.  This continued after I contacted GMG support and they said they modified my account and to try again. I ended up just getting my game at full price off of Steam cause I didn't want to deal with it anymore. They just seem to be struggling during this summer sale and I just wanted to let people know just in case.   Like I said I don't believe GMG is doing anything shady yet I wanna make sure people know to watch their statements if their ordering online regardless who it's from. Though I've had problems before with Origin and others I've never experienced anything quite like what happened with GMG. I mean for an order to tell me it's declined on the site yet show up authorized on my cc account is pretty bad. Not only that but to switch multiple times between authorized and declined is even worse. Now I need to make sure to watch my CC account closely for the next couple days/weeks to make sure everything is okay. Granted it's not the end of the world but it's a pretty big annoyance when just trying to save a few dollars on a video game.
pcgaming,3d8q5e,I_Will_be_Nice,5,Tue Jul 14 12:16:01 2015 UTC,It's a credit card thing.   Whatever service they use to block dubious transactions plays up.  Mine does it with GMG and Twitch all the time. Nothing to do with GMG.
pcgaming,3d8q5e,I_Will_be_Nice,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:04:28 2015 UTC,Well if GMG had just declined my card I wouldn't of cared. The reason I posted this was because the CC rep I was talking to was telling me that the charges were changing between authorized and declined. So now I have a bunch older charges that never went through on the site going from declined to authorized then back to declined. This obviously put me on fraud watch and locked down my account. I figured my CC company was the problem at first myself until I unlocked my CC account and tried again after talking to GMG support to only have the same thing happen again. This is the point where I get transferred to a fraud specialist at my CC company and they tell me it's probably a problem with their billing and to watch my account to make sure all of the charges are cancelled.
pcgaming,3d8q5e,STEVENXO,5,Tue Jul 14 12:26:40 2015 UTC,It's absolutely the fault of the fraud protection system your CC company uses. They'll never admit it - but it happens with a few companies on my card and it has nothing to do with the amount/when/where/why.
pcgaming,3d8q5e,elusive_cat,3,Tue Jul 14 13:19:03 2015 UTC,"That seriously sounds like an issue with your CC, not GMG. This is why I try to use PayPal as much as possible when ordering from any digital distributor, and if I can't, I use my trusty Discover card which hasn't had these issues yet."

pcgaming,3d8q5e,plagues138,2,Tue Jul 14 16:03:42 2015 UTC,"Your take on the events sounds dubious. Declines come from your issuing bank. If your bank is claiming a charge went from decline to authorize to decline, then you need to speak with someone else at the bank.   Also, authorizations can be separate from settlements; again, someone at your bank should be able to tell you if a ""pending"" charge is real or is it just an auth.  Lastly, declines don't just happen because the card is ""bad"". If it's declined then call your bank, they have final say in whether it's declined and lack of funds is only one of a few dozen reasons why they might decline it."

By all accounts the Voodoo series was the better technology, but eventually DirectX and OpenGL won out over Glide, and technical issues keeping the Voodoo5 6000 off the market ended up in 3dfx folding and being bought out by Nvidia.  A lot of the tech 3dfx had been working on contributed to both Nvidia's and ATI's success in the early-00s, as engineers from 3dfx ended up in both companies and were key in designing some of their best lines of cards (Nvidia's FX series and ATI's Radeon X series)."

pcgaming,3czm6i,dexter311,18,Sun Jul 12 06:57:54 2015 UTC,"Well the market used to be much smaller back when we had 3dfx, ATI, Nvidia, Matrox and S3. Though to be fair it was likely unsustainable and is why we're left with only 2 brands."
pcgaming,3czm6i,jthompson02,20,Sun Jul 12 07:51:39 2015 UTC,Yeah but breaking into the market then only really required a good idea and some capital investment compared to what you'd need nowadays. Competing with Nvidia and AMD would require billions and licencing a ton of technology before you could even get a chip on the market.
pcgaming,3czm6i,thinkythought,3,Sun Jul 12 12:03:38 2015 UTC,"3DFX....man, i still have my Voodoo 5 5500 floating around here."
pcgaming,3czm6i,DiDiDamDam,178,Sun Jul 12 11:03:08 2015 UTC,"True, but I think AMD has made the more powerful card more than a few times. They may be behind now, but that doesn't mean they always have been or always will be."
pcgaming,3czm6i,MTBDEM,65,Sun Jul 12 06:26:10 2015 UTC,"The 5870 ran unopposed for 6ish months, and the 480 beat it by about as much as the 980 ti beats the fury x but cost quite a bit more. 7970 was faster than the 680, and gained ground with time and drivers. The 290x is faster than the 780/780ti now depending on the game but that took some time and drivers.  I remember some wins price/perf wise in the 9800gtx/2xx era with the 4870 and such. It was mostly that the 4870 was like 85% give or take of a gtx 280, but for $300.   The only clear ass kickings i remember though are the 7970, the 5870 when it was running unopposed, and the 9700pro/9800xt era stuff. The 9700 pro was a freaking MASSIVE deal at the time. It was like the original titan launch, or the 8800gtx launch. Nothing was even close for quite a while.   Nvidia wins more often, but AMD has won. And around the beginning of fermi era they were kicking ass. Hawaii was also a huge deal until the 780ti launched. And it's aged a lot better than kepler.   It's also worth noting, amusingly to the last gen of AMD cards, that in the 5870/VLIW5 era AMD had massively less power draw than nvidia. Heh."
pcgaming,3czm6i,Bloke_Named_Bob,13,Sun Jul 12 10:43:12 2015 UTC,"Even when GTX 480 launched the HD5870 was still a strong card. The GTX 480 cost a lot, but it was also very power hungry and throttled without water. You could have two HD5870's in a system and have it consume less power.  I reckon that the Fermi launch was the reason why XFX and nVidia parted ways and BFG went bankrupt."

pcgaming,3czm6i,Kirk_Kerman,25,Sun Jul 12 11:53:47 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. It blows my mind that apparently no one realises that AMD cards often close the gap, and sometimes even surpass the nVidia offering at 4K resolution. The market is slowly shifting away from 1080p; higher resolutions are becoming more common every day. Who gives a fuck if the 980Ti gets slightly more frames at 1080p than a Fury X, no one is buying those cards for their 1080p performance, they're going to run 1440p, 4K or a multi monitor setup."
pcgaming,3czm6i,SolidCake,13,Sun Jul 12 13:16:10 2015 UTC,"Who gives a fuck if the 980Ti gets slightly more frames at 1080p than a Fury X, no one is buying those cards for their 1080p performance, they're going to run 1440p, 4K or a multi monitor setup.    I give a fuck. I run a 144 Hz 1080p monitor. Look at the Witcher 3 benchmarks. Running the game at 1080p on ultra basically makes even the 980 Ti go sub-60 fps(though mid-to-high 50s).  If I want a stable 100+ fps experience, there is no single GPU that can do that for me now. According to the Steam surveys, only 3-4% are at 1440p or above. I think the enthusiast market is a little bit bigger than 3-4%.  1080p matters a lot and will continue to do so for years to come. AMD can't afford to lose on those resolutions and as long as they do, they will continue to bleed red(pun intended)."
pcgaming,3czm6i,atfsix,14,Sun Jul 12 20:47:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Only enthusiasts buy the really pricey cards, and enthusiasts generally game at resolutions above 1080p, which is where AMD closes the gap on performance and wins on price. The biggest sellers have always been the 960s and R9 280s."
pcgaming,3czm6i,fashric,12,Sun Jul 12 14:00:23 2015 UTC,The biggest sellers have always been the 960s and R9 280s.   I think the 970 is more popular than the 960.
pcgaming,3czm6i,bjt23,21,Sun Jul 12 15:33:44 2015 UTC,That's because the 960 is outperformed by cheaper AMD cards.

pcgaming,3czm6i,fashric,12,Sun Jul 12 13:49:27 2015 UTC,"if I knew I didnt have to wait months   Meh, with a lot of games you have to wait months after release for them to patch up the bugs and add cool features anyway.  It is pretty rare that I trust a company enough to buy a game on release anymore."
pcgaming,3czm6i,IndigoMoss,6,Sun Jul 12 17:49:30 2015 UTC,"You don't have a single GPU on the market currently to run a game in 60fps in 4K.  The only 'problematic' game I had/have so far is Witcher 3, where I played through the game in 30fps, dissapointed in the performance thinking   Wow they really fucked up the optimisation   Then the new drivers came out and my card pulls ~60fps. (Approx. 3-5 days after release of the game, don't remember how long it took them, but I played through the whole game at that point. I just no-lifed a lot.)  There's still problems with Tesselation of water in CF, or the darker frame issue (In W3) - but it seems completetly irrelevant compared to the fact that I'm running 60fps in UHD for the less of a price than one 980 Ti.  Everything has it's pros and cons, and I'd say the 'months' of waiting for 'good' profiles is a little bit of an overreaction. Off course, everything depends on how High End up the chain you're going. Being 1% of the Gaming world ain't easy.  Edit: Yes, I did meant that."
pcgaming,3czm6i,Gundamnitpete,8,Sun Jul 12 13:54:32 2015 UTC,I think you mean 'exaggeration'. In my experience of having a 7990 as recently as last December and also seeing current Crossfire users complaints its not an exaggeration at all. Just look at the last driver release notes and how many games that are months old and are only now getting decent profiles. I guess if you play very few games and Crossfire works in those games then it would be good but honestly all multi gpu set ups (I had 780 sli until march) are just a massive pain in the arse and you spend more time out of game tweaking than you do in game playing. I'm much happier to take an fps hit and get a much better overall experience with my single 290X.
pcgaming,3czm6i,thinkythought,8,Sun Jul 12 14:08:50 2015 UTC,"It's weird, because Far Cry 4 was in that recent list of improvements to Crossfire, but my R9 270x CF was working amazingly with it. So they just made it better, but it was already one of the best games for me to use my CF setup on."
pcgaming,3czm6i,MTBDEM,6,Sun Jul 12 16:18:47 2015 UTC,"It took 5 months from release for crossfire drivers that worked without flicker to get released for FC4. I was about 90% through it at that point.  That said, with the new drivers it does run very very well."
pcgaming,3czm6i,fashric,2,Sun Jul 12 16:40:34 2015 UTC,"Yep. I make posts like this on here occasionally too. Nvidia and AMD basically toss the ball back and forth on what new game is currently fucked up on SLI/CF and/or has terrible or nonexistent scaling(or runs SLOWER with SLI/CF enabled).  Every time my brain starts to go ""but that used pair of cards/2x card is soooo cheap compared to $INSERT_TOTL_CARD!"" i have to like, slap myself. Yea, i've seen $400-450 used 295x2s. But UGH.  And in a lot of games, the really low minimum FPS drops are never fixed. I saw a post on here recently that was pretty much ""for every game SLI kicks ass in, there's two games where it doesn't run that great or is actually fucked up"". With one powerful single card you can usually download a game on day 1 and play it pretty well unless there's game breaking launch bugs. With SLI/CF, you're either playing with one card or you're slogging through an uncharted wasteland that might not even be officially supported."
pcgaming,3czm6i,dsaddons,2,Sun Jul 12 19:32:09 2015 UTC,"GTA 5, Cities Skylines, Witcher 3, Battlefield is what I'm playing.  Not really bothered by anything else at the moment, maybe for Elite which I will get if the price drops down.  Metal Gear Solid V Phantom Pain should be fine, since Ground Zeroes had a profile and it's the same engine. We'll see about new Mirror's Edge, but it's Frostbite so it will use the same profile as Battlefield, mostly.  I just don't see that 'Massive pain in the arse' everyone is talking about, including the tweaking bit.  From my experience with 295x2 (From Mar-Apr this year) the only issue I had is Witcher 3, which i mentioned above."
pcgaming,3czm6i,58592825866,5,Sun Jul 12 14:16:38 2015 UTC,Battlefield 4 has had a number of Crossfire issues  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgX403UcQsY as an example. Witcher 3 has now been out 2 months and only just got a proper crossfire profile. The tweaking is having to mess about with radeonpro and config files eg. Witcher 3. Having to wait and also do these things when you have a supposedly premium card is not how it should be. Anyway I'm not trying to argue with you I'm glad you are enjoying the card I'm just salty about multi gpu set ups becasue they should be so much more.

pcgaming,3czm6i,mrhebrides,7,Mon Jul 13 01:06:25 2015 UTC,"480 took up like 100W more and the situation was opposite those days, with AMD scoring better in lower resolutions and nvidia gaining more ground at higher resolutions. AMD screwed up by not bringing out a 5980 like they had done with the 48xx series before. And the VLIW4 experiment with 69xx series.    7970 wasn't faster than 680, the Ghz edition was barely faster and drivers did help absolutely massively in the one game that mattered a whole lot but as is AMD's wont, after half of the player base was done with the game.  http://www.pcgameshardware.de/screenshots/original/2012/10/Catalyst_12.11_Beta_Battlefield_3_Full-HD.PNG  I think the best opening that AMD have is now with nvidia on a new node, architecture and memory at the same time. If they can tweak GCN to hit 1.2Ghz routinely on the new node, they'll be ahead again."
pcgaming,3czm6i,nav13eh,12,Sun Jul 12 15:46:05 2015 UTC,"I still have this feeling that the top AMD cards are faster than anything from Nvidia but the drivers and APIs still aren't taking advantage of it.

pcgaming,3czm6i,StealthMissile,28,Sun Jul 12 16:06:02 2015 UTC,"There are several different things to consider when buying a graphics card. However for just performance I will link to a post I made a while ago comparing the 970 and the 390X.  https://np.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/3aap82/early_r9_390x_benchmarks_1220_faster_than_the/csbnjwz  Now because that is the 390X and not the 390 you would have to find a 390 review preferably of the card you're interested in. I unfortunately can not find a lot of 390 (non X) variant reviews. Something to also consider is the fact that in most reviews of a card they test that card vs only reference cards. Kitguru I think is one of the few who compares non-reference cards in charts. This is important for several reasons.  1. Reference cards are slower. In the case of Maxwell (GTX 900 series) this gap is quite big.  2. There is no reference 970. As in it was never sold. So looking at reference 970s is not a real world benchmark. Edit: Never mind I am dumb. See /u/SolidCake comment bellow. This is why you fact check kappa.  3. Reference cards are hotter and thus thermal throttle (slow down of gpu speed) is more of a problem than with partner cards.  A word of advice when buying cards is simply looking at the AMD and nVidia cards in your price range, and then opening 50 tabs of reviews directly comparing the different versions yourself (ie: Gigabyte G1 970 on one tab and on the other one the MSI Gaming 4G 970 and so on and so forth). I personally go for guru3d first old habit and then move on to the following: AnandTech, TechPowerUp, Tom'sHardware and pcPerspective. I use Guru3D to chose one of each card to look deeper into so one AMD (say the Sapphire Tri-X 290X) and one nVidia (say the G1 Gaming 970) and then go around comparing them through all those websites.  Things to never ever use:  PCGamer - No. Seriously no. Just no. For a PC magazine they are pretty ignorant on hardware and software alike.  YouTube - Same as above. Never ever ever, use these. The amount of times I've heard them say shit that is straight up wrong is astounding, not even mad just impressed. Not one video reviewer I've watched has failed to disappoint me. Whether it be by not providing clock speeds in overclocked tests (why even say which cards they're reviewing at that point kappa) or factual inaccuracies, ranging from DX12 to HBM. I get it keeping someone's attention for such prolonged periods of time is hard, however not putting important information out there and straight up teaching bullshit to people is not cool. Maybe use the time you use for bullshit for actual numbers. Or maybe they should do more fact checking other than reading a heavily upvoted reddit comment.  Reddit.com - Why? Because circlejerks. That's why. In both directions. It's not that far from console wars really. Keep away from reddit if you want to buy any pc component. Much better websites out there for discussion and talking to people who have the things you're looking at. Are they still susceptible to circlejerks? Yes. But reddit circlejerks are one of a kind in intensity and magnitude.  Final Word: Overclocking Maxwell and You  The final thing to consider with the 970 is overclocking. Part of the reason this card was (is) so popular on release was that if you overclock it, it can reach the stratosphere. Or as I like to call it a cheaper 980 with .5 gimped VRAM.   ps: Several websites did pieces on this issue and I don't think anyone was able to replicate what users were claiming so take that however you will, for more info just google more or go here PCPer1  Which card is best for you is only up for you to decide. Personally I would go with either 970 for overclocking, or 390 for stock speeds. But you should check out everything yourself.  Hope I was of assistance."
pcgaming,3czm6i,GotRiskyNewAccount,7,Sun Jul 12 12:48:44 2015 UTC,"Also, don't look at GPU Boss. When I started I liked them because their benchmarks are very concise and comprehensible. Then I realized they suck Nvidia's collective dicks."
pcgaming,3czm6i,LRed,11,Sun Jul 12 16:48:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the detailed answer.   I plan on getting the GTX 970. Here's the reasons why:   I have overclocking in-mind. One person replied to me saying that beginners shouldn't do it. I've got friends who overclock their computer all the time. I'll ask them about this... but I will inevitably be overclocking. The EVGA GeForce GTX SSC ACX 2.0 has a nice core clock speed of 1190MHz and a boost clock speed 1342MHz.  I'm kind of dead-set on this. I'll have the 970 for a while and if absolutely needed, I can upgrade.   It might not be a lot of reasons but the main reason for this choice of card is the overclocking and because I'm not up-tight about the specific FPS rates on 1080p, 4k, etc. 390 and 970 at stock speeds seem to perform in a similar manner. Thanks for the advice!  [Edit:] I shall be getting the 390. The performance compare to the 970, is just better. Especially for being around the same price. I guess that I'll just have to see! I'm sure I won't regret it because once I see how smoothly it runs compared to my kill-me-now laptop, I'll be very happy.   The truth is, I was just kind of favoring NVIDIA because my friend's have always liked their cards more but facts are facts.  390 just ever so slightly outperforms the 970 just enough to get me to buy one.  Thanks for the help, Guys. (:"

pcgaming,3czm6i,jigssaw,7,Sun Jul 12 16:27:52 2015 UTC,"You would be more than fine. Truthfully even a i5-2500k is enough. For the most part games are not CPU bound unless you're using a fx cpu from AMD that's not overclocked.   Overclocked even with those you should be fine however remember that some games are more cpu intensive than others whether it be because of scripting or draw calls from draw distance and number of things on screen (arma 3 springs to mind).   FX cpus are useless for those kinds of games (also emulation for those interested although only PS2 emulation is that heavy really).  For games like those overclocking your cpu would put it within batting distance of my 4690k. Lately CPU's haven't seem great gains on performance so if you were to compare a 4690k and a 3570k at equal clock speeds you may see at most a 5-10% difference.  This is a little graph I made seeing what kind of effect overclocking had on arma 3. Not rigorous by any stretch but should give you an idea in CPU heavy games. Again most games are not like this, this is a worst case scenario.  PS: you should note that because there is no in-game benchmark I just tried running the same part of a mission in equal time but failed so peaks and drops are slightly offset so read it carefully  Imgur Link"

I don't think NVIDIA will be dropping the price on the 970 anytime soon as they seem like they want to reserve that pricing segment for a future 960 Ti.

Even if I wanted to pick up the GTX 980ti because it's the best, I would lose out on my monitor's main feature.  I really wish NVidia would make FreeSync compatible with their graphics cards, after experiencing adaptive sync, there's no going back to a standard monitor.   And yes, I know they won't, G-Sync makes them too much money, adapting FreeSync would be ""leaving money on the table"", but being locked into a specific brand of GPU based on your monitor is silly."
pcgaming,3czm6i,mikbob,56,Sun Jul 12 16:20:42 2015 UTC,"I think feeling locked in is true for G-Sync, but not FreeSync.  FreeSync isn't really adding any cost to the monitor.  You get a 144Hz 1440p display with FreeSync added in for no extra cost.  If you get G-Sync you get that same monitor, but you have to spend an extra ~$200 to get the G-Sync feature.  I'd feel locked in with G-Sync because you have to justify the extra money, but with FreeSync you can justify not being able to use it because it's an extra feature that didn't require any extra cost to the product.  If adaptive sync is something you feel like you need to have, well right now you are totally right about having your monitor and GPU brand locked together.  I find that really unfortunate and bad for competition."
pcgaming,3czm6i,Bannik254,25,Sun Jul 12 06:43:26 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify something: FreeSync does add cost. This is something we have confirmed with AMD at CES (I'm at GamersNexus).

pcgaming,3d4la3,Ar1S3,5,Mon Jul 13 16:56:53 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't count on it. Gave me a runaround once upon a time about needing to create an account on their ""USA"" website and not their global one.  Go ahead, try to make an account on www.zotacusa.com and see how far you get. (It's worth the effort)."
pcgaming,3d4la3,patriotsfan82,4,Mon Jul 13 19:00:03 2015 UTC,"I've never dealt with the customer service, but I've met quite a few of the folks that work there and they seem like people who genuinely care about hardware and the people who buy it. I would hope that they have or will fix any issues with their RMA department. I will ask next time I speak with them."
pcgaming,3d4la3,DerangedMemory,3,Tue Jul 14 00:13:10 2015 UTC,"Apparently it's just another lottery when it comes to any company's RMA service. Typically they only ever send back ""certified refurbished.""  I've read some great stories about each company and some awful ones.  Currently on my second RMA with MSI (970 GTX borked). The one they sent back to me was significantly worst than the one I sent in."
pcgaming,3d4la3,Uljira,2,Mon Jul 13 19:59:22 2015 UTC,This card has been out for a while right? There's already a bunch of reviews on it. Am I missing something here?
pcgaming,3d4la3,Uljira,9,Mon Jul 13 14:04:20 2015 UTC,We test a few modern games that weren't out during the original review run.. its useful information for someone making a purchase TODAY.
pcgaming,3d4la3,LuisCypherrr,3,Mon Jul 13 14:05:11 2015 UTC,"Good to know, thanks for the reply."
pcgaming,3czz13,Leknasant,82,Sun Jul 12 08:59:59 2015 UTC,IF they want to stop cheating then need to support modding and make an official modkit. That would allow the game to see more what kind of mods were being loaded on start up and if was any cheating mods they could force it to offline mode. But instead of doing they smart thing they are fucking everyone over.
pcgaming,3czz13,supamesican,35,Sun Jul 12 15:24:02 2015 UTC,"Or even have separate ""hacked"" servers where people that have mods installed are put into.  Or even further down the road let people start their own servers to do whatever they want on.  Effectively resolving most hacking problems."
pcgaming,3czz13,Treyzania,5,Sun Jul 12 19:36:31 2015 UTC,Then people wouldn't buy Shark Cards.
pcgaming,3czz13,Tovora,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:07:14 2015 UTC,Yes they would.  There would still have to be central servers for managing transactions and I'm sure spawning money would still have to be policed by the central servers.
pcgaming,3czz13,Treyzania,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:45:11 2015 UTC,"How exactly would that work? If you spawn a car in the game, that's a car you don't have to buy. If you spawn a weapon, that's a weapon you don't have to buy.  Hacks affect money, money is Shark Cards."
pcgaming,3czz13,Tovora,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:39:26 2015 UTC,"Put restrictions on it.  They can't keep hacked cars, weapons, etc."
pcgaming,3czz13,Treyzania,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:47:54 2015 UTC,Then they'd just keep spawning new vehicles and weapons whenever required.
pcgaming,3czz13,Tovora,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:20:03 2015 UTC,That can get annoying.
pcgaming,3czz13,Treyzania,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:53:46 2015 UTC,People are dumb enough to buy them to begin with?
pcgaming,3czz13,FalconPunch2000,2,Mon Jul 13 19:38:23 2015 UTC,"If a question starts with ""Are people dumb enough"" it's a yes."
pcgaming,3czz13,Tovora,7,Tue Jul 14 01:19:20 2015 UTC,If they can start their own servers there may be more pirating. GTAO is great DRM.
pcgaming,3czz13,TheRealAkuski,2,Mon Jul 13 00:40:58 2015 UTC,That needs to happen.
pcgaming,3czz13,Johnny_Hamhock,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:38:40 2015 UTC,thats what they did with gta 4 idk why they just cant do that with 5
pcgaming,3czz13,techh10,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:20:59 2015 UTC,"That really wouldn't go well. It would just be people insta killing the whole server like what happens now, only worse."
pcgaming,3czz13,Valhalla_I_Am_Coming,2,Mon Jul 13 06:49:54 2015 UTC,You need both server-side sanity checks and active moderation to stop cheaters. Any client-side anti-cheat code will only slow cheaters down.
pcgaming,3czz13,ganjlord,53,Sun Jul 12 22:47:01 2015 UTC,"sort of a rant about reddit(and uninformed people) here:  I know reddit is not one person but many, but holy shit, if you follow /r/grandtheftautov_pc , than you will see, that nearly every week (maybe even every day) there is a big thread about hackers ruining the game. They really want hackers to be stopped. But the only way for doing this has a big bad point, it's that modding has to be more restricted than. Its a balance you have to make. But you can always just start the game in offline mode and you wont ever get banned for modding. So why in the hell is this a problem? Just start the damn game in offline mode.  If you want the game to be modable in online mode and you bought it for that, you clearly didnt inform yourself what the game is about. Dont get me wrong, that would be the way i would want to play it, but i bought the game for solo player and thats much more worth it than the 60 dollars i paid (in comparison with all others AAA games i saw lately, maybe witcher 3 too but i just didnt like the gameplay mechanics of it, so i passed).   Also about the in game cash situation, i will never buy tripple a game in game cash, and i nearly didnt buy it just because i think that should be boycotted, but yeah as said, i only play sp, but if you want in game cash, just hack it in, get banned for a week and play on.  So about the performance issue: i really dont think that they wanted this, and they will fix it in a couple of days, like they did it already several time. It is actually a very good port in comparison with a lot of games lately. But yes the performance is going downhill, at least for nvidia cards. But that is also a point many seem to not understand, that the day it is released nvidia and amd made drivers exactly for this game. The newer drivers are not perfected for this game, they still will run it good, but just not that good anymore, so if you want thee best performance again, you have to get this driver again on your pc.  end (clearly i also dont know everything, and yeah i'm open for critizism, but i just wanted to break the circlejerk a little bit)"
pcgaming,3czz13,yeah_tagpro,22,Sun Jul 12 11:04:30 2015 UTC,"Theres a simple solution to the hacker problem, Allow for player group servers and allow there to be admins in that group. Then the admins could ban the hackers as they please."
pcgaming,3czz13,mrbiofan12,19,Sun Jul 12 16:00:48 2015 UTC,There is an even better solution to the hacking problem.  Ditch P2P and introduce dedis.
pcgaming,3czz13,semkia,2,Sun Jul 12 18:01:17 2015 UTC,"No doubt it's the best solution, but that is a SHIT TON of work. RS likely has the vast majority of their people tasked to whatever their next project is. Hopefully the next RDR, hopefully with RDR2-Online with dedicated servers :D"
pcgaming,3czz13,Nose-Nuggets,3,Sun Jul 12 18:33:54 2015 UTC,"I know mate, I was being slightly facetious with that comment.  My friends and I have pretty much given up with GTA Online purely becasue of P2P.   Alas, it could have been so much more with dedis"
pcgaming,3czz13,semkia,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:45:27 2015 UTC,"i honestly haven't had that many issues other than the cheaters. Overall performance is usually pretty good, the only time there are lag issues is when i am playing with people in Europe and even then it's really only when driving fast."
pcgaming,3czz13,Nose-Nuggets,0,Sun Jul 12 18:50:47 2015 UTC,Loading times are a killer for my friends and I.  Although we would deal with that if it weren't for the uberhax.
pcgaming,3czz13,semkia,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:29:35 2015 UTC,"i think the loading is more the nature of the asset management not being drastically changed from the console builds. i don't think it has anything to do with MP specifically, it's just handled better in SP because it's linear."
pcgaming,3czz13,Nose-Nuggets,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:52:16 2015 UTC,"With the amount of dollars the consumers have tossed into Rockstars face, we deserve dedicated servers."
pcgaming,3czz13,Fantact,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:30:48 2015 UTC,Look i can't argue with that sentiment as the consumer of the product - but that's not the way it works.
pcgaming,3czz13,Nose-Nuggets,0,Wed Jul 15 16:29:29 2015 UTC,So much work that mods already do it
pcgaming,3czz13,JJSCHMITTY,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:40:50 2015 UTC,Oh?
pcgaming,3czz13,Nose-Nuggets,13,Sun Jul 12 22:55:36 2015 UTC,"Or make seperate exes for online and sp at different folders, if online exe saws anything that allows modding in it's folder, the game will auto-ban the account."
pcgaming,3czz13,Qualine,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:44:41 2015 UTC,But that would mess with the quick seamless switch between SP and MP that seems to be R*'s design philosophy.  One exe to rule them all.
pcgaming,3czz13,johnpeter123,3,Sun Jul 12 20:10:30 2015 UTC,"That's really not true.  First, the game spawns multiple ""exes"" (processes) while it's running (seriously, look it up).  Second, switching between tasks is often simple and seamless."
pcgaming,3czz13,steak4take,4,Sun Jul 12 20:39:49 2015 UTC,"If it works, it isn't seemless then. Besides, I'd like to have a non-cheat game experience then a quick switch."
pcgaming,3czz13,Qualine,4,Sun Jul 12 21:10:46 2015 UTC,"Or just do some proper sanity checks, sums, and logging to correctly identify and ban cheaters so we don't have to resort to self governed communities."
pcgaming,3czz13,SexualHarasmentPanda,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:52:34 2015 UTC,Governed communities are fine as long as there's plenty to choose from.
pcgaming,3czz13,mrbiofan12,3,Sun Jul 12 16:58:54 2015 UTC,"Well they have their merits, but they would exist as a workaround and not a proper fix."
pcgaming,3czz13,SexualHarasmentPanda,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:01:56 2015 UTC,"I rather that, then them taking away moding for multiplayer."
pcgaming,3czz13,mrbiofan12,6,Sun Jul 12 17:42:34 2015 UTC,"I am fine with no modding. My copy is vanilla and never play GTO. However, my FPS have gone down and the stutter makes the game unplayable. I don't care what Rockstar does to fix the issues they have introduced. They just need to fix them or allow me to roll back to any previous version I want to."
pcgaming,3czz13,happyloaf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:01:49 2015 UTC,"yep thats absolutely correct that should be fixed for sure. I really didnt want to defend them actually, but i just wanted to put it more in perspective, that i think that there is worse than what they do, but yes if this doesnt get fixed it would be a shitty move, but i guess we just need to wait a little"
pcgaming,3czz13,yeah_tagpro,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:06:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there should be no waiting. It is unplayable, find a way to allow single player users to roll back to 1.26 and then fix it. Then text, then release. Right now, I cannot play and I have a decent PC. I cannot even suffer through low FPS and lock to 30 and play. The game is so unstable it crashes during most missing briefings. I have 16 hours in and cannot request a refund (I have tried with 1.27 and 1.28 patch droppings).   Honestly, I think I'm done with Rockstar games. After the broken GTA IV and now the active breaking of GTA V, their QC makes it so I don't want to pay for their games."
pcgaming,3czz13,happyloaf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:12:46 2015 UTC,Yup. I've had a support ticket ever since 1.27 patch. The patch broke my game and now I'm getting ghost textures (flickering) on vehicles when they get damaged. I've had a support ticket since May with them. So far - all they've asked me if for my msinfo / dxdiag 5 times. Their support is virtually non existent and the game is now worthless to me. Wish there were terms that if they break the game you get your money back. patching and breaking a game isn't acceptable. Single player should be able to go back to 1.26. That version was perfect. I'm over developers releasing patches and it borking up part of the game and then it never getting fixed. Guess I'll start buying games a year after they are released to see how the patches and stuff go. (This is probably some of the reason why people pirate -_-) Quality control should matter.
pcgaming,3czz13,BossJ00,0,Mon Jul 13 13:44:19 2015 UTC,"welp i think you have every right to hate this, if you still play the game and cant play it because of this it is utter shit, well i miss the days without steam and all these platforms where you could update if you want. But yes i dont know what to say, it is shitty and you can hate them, or you can think that they didnt broke it on purpose and live with it for a few days"
pcgaming,3czz13,yeah_tagpro,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:51:31 2015 UTC,It has been a month. I don't get much time to play to when I sit down I want my games to work especially if on release they ran great. Each patch has degraded performance and rockstar has stayed mum until 1.28; I have no faith they will fix this.
pcgaming,3czz13,happyloaf,2,Sun Jul 12 22:56:32 2015 UTC,"The PC gaming community in general seems to have some weird, unrealistic obsession with the mod-ability of AAA games ever since Skyrim came out. Like, we collectively rate a game based on whether or not the developers included a means to BREAK the game. It's retarded. The most ironic part is that most of the people complaining weren't around for the glory days of modding Half Life and Quake and creating actually fully playable games out of their frameworks."
pcgaming,3czz13,willxcore,5,Sun Jul 12 18:04:42 2015 UTC,"thats a great point actually, because i think a lot of people dont even mod that much, who complain. And even than, i think we have actually bigger problems than integrated modability. In-Game purchases, broken games, shitty ports and the most important one: actually Good and creative games."
pcgaming,3czz13,yeah_tagpro,-8,Sun Jul 12 21:18:47 2015 UTC,"It is actually a very good port in comparison with a lot of games lately.   That is not a valid argument. It took them an extra 2 years and they sold it for full price, it better be a fucking good port."
pcgaming,3czz13,Heatranoveryou,3,Sun Jul 12 11:33:09 2015 UTC,"welp while you are right, the final product (the xbox one, ps 4 and pc version) was only half a year earlier out. (just wanted to point that out) But yeah you are right, they took a lot of time and they got a lot of money out of it.  I really dont want to defend this. I just think that they put out a great game and get a lot of shit for it, while games like ac4 get a lot of praise just for making one new feature in a rehash. I find this personally a MUCH bigger problem in gaming, than waiting  a year longer than somebody else. I mean I am a patient guy, so maybe i dont understand this problem quite, but what gives it if i play it one year earlier or later, i love old games and play them from time to time and i couldnt care when they got released.  TL;DR you are right but i just value good games more than 1 year earlier release, still i want it like in around 2000 were everything was better  Edit.: sry for such a long text i really want to only say that, that i'm actually sad that there are really not that many good games anymore, but when there is a good one it gets just as much flag as a bad one. I really think everything said in this thread is right, but there are other games that are broken or released every year under a different name, and there seem no problem with that whatsoever."
pcgaming,3czz13,yeah_tagpro,-6,Sun Jul 12 11:50:44 2015 UTC,5 months away from 2 years. That is over a year and a half and close enough.
pcgaming,3czz13,Heatranoveryou,4,Sun Jul 12 12:01:01 2015 UTC,"what i meant was the pc version was half a year after ps4 and xbox one version. There is a big difference between ps4/xbox one and ps3/xbox360 version, and that is why it took so long"
pcgaming,3czz13,yeah_tagpro,0,Sun Jul 12 12:59:02 2015 UTC,Did PC come out after the ps4 and x1? no  Did the PC come out after the ps3/x360? no  2 console releases of the same game before the PC gets it. Fuck that.  Its a 2 year old game. No excuses.
pcgaming,3czz13,Heatranoveryou,3,Sun Jul 12 14:21:14 2015 UTC,"Did PC come out after the ps4 and x1? no Did the PC come out after the ps3/x360? no   d- do you mean the console or the game? for the game it is yes, but i guess you mean the console after your answer.  But anyway, what games do you play nowdays that arent either bad ports or delayes for pc? i'm really interested. Dont get me wrong i HATE how the pc is getting shafted all the time, but as said i see the bigger problem that we dont get any games that are even worthwhile anymore. I am actually playing now games from years back because they are just much more fun than those things that get released now. So yeah if you tell me games as good as gta, that can catch my attention i would love it. But holy shit just because i get it a little bit later is for me personally not the big point why i wouldnt play it ( but yes i also dont like that they released it so late)   Hmm i guess i made my point clear now i hope, but if you have good games, pls answer"
pcgaming,3czz13,yeah_tagpro,-1,Sun Jul 12 14:32:45 2015 UTC,red faction guerilla  portal   bioshock  darksiders  dark souls  bastion  ftl  gunpoint  long live the queen  mark of the ninja  the novelist  orcs must die  risk of rain  rogue legacy  spelunky  the swapper  stick it to the man  to the moon  hearthstone
pcgaming,3czz13,Heatranoveryou,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:05:13 2015 UTC,"thanks man :) i appreciate this, and i actually didnt play most of them, i will save it so i'll play a few when the time goes on :)  still nearly all of them are indie, and yeah indie games are really fun, i play so much tagpro for example, but my post was about triple a games :( and portal and bioshock are now already old, dark souls is also a pretty bad port, darksiders and red faction i didnt play.   And FUCK HEARTHSTONE, may be a unpopular opinion, but i played it a time, but you have to pay around a thousand dollars to get all the cards non golden with a new account. I started late and so i never had a chance, but even if you started early it still sucks."
pcgaming,3czz13,yeah_tagpro,0,Sun Jul 12 15:17:44 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure gedosato fixes dark souls if there are any issues still.  I play a lot of hearthstone entirely f2p. I'm surprised how much i've acquired on my eu account(na being my main.) Pretty much you have to enjoy arena or you are just going to have a bad time, but after gvg even enjoying arena isn't enough because you are stuck with only getting shitty gvg packs."
pcgaming,3czz13,Heatranoveryou,5,Sun Jul 12 15:37:26 2015 UTC,They released it when it was ready. Are you seriously breaking their balls over releasing a finished product?
pcgaming,3czz13,RagingCain,2,Sun Jul 12 13:07:26 2015 UTC,Are you seriously breaking their balls over releasing a finished product?   What?
pcgaming,3czz13,Heatranoveryou,-4,Sun Jul 12 14:12:08 2015 UTC,What part of that question didn't you understand?
pcgaming,3czz13,harpuajim25,3,Sun Jul 12 15:49:01 2015 UTC,The part where he had zero grounds for his question.
pcgaming,3czz13,Heatranoveryou,0,Sun Jul 12 15:53:28 2015 UTC,The issue is that this change Rockstar made affects online and offline.
pcgaming,3czz13,robber9000,11,Sun Jul 12 16:39:26 2015 UTC,"I stopped playing gta because I couldn't play online anymore without having hackers ruin every fucking lobby. From nuking the map, to using hacked cars in races, and God mode in deathmatch. I'd rather play a vanilla game than get to mod while dealing with that shit"
pcgaming,3czz13,JayBo_Vizard,4,Sun Jul 12 16:02:57 2015 UTC,"Welcome to P2P  Not that dedis eliminate hackers, but they sure help reduce them.  Hacker in your lobby, you're hit out of luck mate."
pcgaming,3czz13,semkia,9,Sun Jul 12 19:31:34 2015 UTC,I was thinking it was running like utter shit when i booted it up for the first time in a month. Fuck sakes rockstar.
pcgaming,3czz13,Lagahan,5,Sun Jul 12 11:20:20 2015 UTC,"I had the same thought on how it was running when doing the exact same thing (booting it up for first time in over a month) last night, thought I'd loaded up watchdogs for a second! To be fair as long as they fix it I don't mind, they are trying to counteract a legitimate issue and have fucked up, but if they leave the performance for the vanilla game like it is though and don't prioritise fixing it, I will be seriously pissed."
pcgaming,3czz13,muthabuffer,67,Sun Jul 12 14:39:56 2015 UTC,"Yarr, thar be better games out yonder anyway.  Edit: Honestly though Rockstar has fucked over PC so much with GTAV. I don't care that it was a good port or ""not a port""; that was bare minimum after 2 years. Then they have the audacity to charge $60 for a 2 year old game and not only did they not put it on sale during the steam sale they went out of their way to circumvent steam refunds while claiming they had a sale. They have also been shitting on mods and don't have an fov option in online.   The worst part is people ate up that shit on release at $60. Square Enix already plans to launch Tomb Raider at $40 for a one year old game if there is backlash but at this point it would be hypocritical."
pcgaming,3czz13,Heatranoveryou,98,Sun Jul 12 09:04:19 2015 UTC,"It's really simple for me.   GTA V = 160 hours and counting on Steam  Tomb Raider = 21 hours  I don't regret a single cent of those 60$ I've spent on GTA V. One of the best purchases I've ever made on Steam. And I know that the majority of people who bought it, think the same."
pcgaming,3czz13,CloakedWarrior4323,35,Sun Jul 12 10:35:12 2015 UTC,Yea anyone who bitches about the PC version being sold for $60 never bought it in the first place. The game was/is worth every penny.
pcgaming,3czz13,harpuajim25,19,Sun Jul 12 11:52:37 2015 UTC,"I I bought it, but I don't agree. For that price, we should have had dedicated servers with a functional anti cheat. There's plenty of games with the same or higher player count per server that manage to do this at a lower price."
pcgaming,3czz13,optimumbox,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:42:17 2015 UTC,Are they open world MMOs with fucktons of content and without a subscription?
pcgaming,3czz13,ExogenBreach,2,Mon Jul 13 04:04:25 2015 UTC,"Gta is not a true ""open world"" game with seemless content and it's also not an mmo.

pcgaming,3czz13,SyntheticEmerald,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:34:10 2015 UTC,They probably charge for DLC which splits the playerbase instead.  I'd rather people be able to waste money on ingame currency and have the content go out for free to everyone.
pcgaming,3czz13,ExogenBreach,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:36:25 2015 UTC,"Valid points. Im suffering badly from split playerbase on advanced warfare, Id hate to see that happen in GTAV.   Its unfortunate though that its so grindy to buy some things. 10 million for a gold plane? that means you would have to spend about 140 dollars to buy it. If i spend 140 buck on in game currency, I expect to be set for life."

pcgaming,3czz13,Valhalla_I_Am_Coming,-9,Mon Jul 13 06:47:58 2015 UTC,"Yea anyone who bitches about the PC version being sold for $60 never bought it in the first place.   Yeah, that's common sense. If I'd bitch about outrageous price but bought it any way, I'd be a hypocrite. $30 for a 2 years old console port with shitty social club from a company that isn't shying from fucking over their customers is a maximum I'm willing to pay."
pcgaming,3czz13,ginx2666,7,Sun Jul 12 15:19:10 2015 UTC,Social club isn't that shitty though. Also why does it matter that it's console port when it plays perfectly on PC? Imo it's pretty cheap to complain about the 60 dollar price when clearly a lot of work went into creating the PC version.
pcgaming,3czz13,FinnishForce,3,Sun Jul 12 16:45:07 2015 UTC,Social club shouldn't even be there!  It doesn't matter if it's crap or not (it is) but what does matter is that it exists.
pcgaming,3czz13,wareagle3000,2,Sun Jul 12 21:17:49 2015 UTC,All the shitty DRM clients out there and you chose to talk shit about Social Club

GTA 4 online worked with cheaters and without. So where is the problem? Oh yeah, because Rockstar want's to sell thier stupid SHARKCARDS instead of releasing a good addon... thats why. Fuck them man."
pcgaming,3czz13,Perfektionist,4,Sun Jul 12 18:55:00 2015 UTC,"GTA 4 online worked with cheaters and without.   It didn't, actually. R* made every move to fuck over modders. Every patch deliberately broke every mod.  The modding scene in GTA IV only existed because R* eventually abandoned the game, at which point modding became widespread.  GTA IV and GTA V are no different, R* has never been with modders."

pcgaming,3czz13,2pacalypse9,7,Sun Jul 12 13:23:02 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to compare GTA V to a similarly priced AAA game. Tomb Raider popped in my mind first, since he wrote about it in his comment too."
pcgaming,3czz13,CloakedWarrior4323,4,Sun Jul 12 13:26:29 2015 UTC,But tomb raider isn't the same kind of game. It's more of a one and done game. Meanwhile gta is a giant open world. Not really a fair comparison IMO.
pcgaming,3czz13,2pacalypse9,5,Sun Jul 12 13:35:45 2015 UTC,"They both cost the same at release. I wanted to compare the price, not the quality of those games.  I also bought BioShock Infinite (60$), Wolfenstein The New Order (60$) etc. and got no more than 20 hours out of those games each. GTA V I've paid the same amount and I've already got 160 hours clocked.  I feel extremly satisfied with this purchase and feel like the game is worth even more than that."

I bought it from Greenman for 46USD (converting from GBP, and pre-release actually), because I knew Rockstar would deliver to my expectations.  As well as that, my true faith is being laid on Standalone multiplayer mods, not GTA Online.  Yeah, I'm not happy with the cheaters - but guess what,  I'm playing with friends, usually cruising or doing random stuff with 30 people in the lobby, organising from a Subreddit. And no one is doing the stuff that people cry so bad about.  You don't like where GTA Online is going?  Stop posting on Reddit, and spam Rockstar execs. You think devs are the ones responsible for pushing stupid patches, for the sake of selling Shark Cards?  And if you don't like what GTA Online is, though shit. It has been said before that it will be a P2P game, so I don't know what you expected.  It's amusing how people enjoyed the game thoroughly at first, and then when everything settles down - 'wow it's so shit.'  Yes, the game is not going in a good direction with ridiculous patches, but if you want to make a difference, you won't do it from one liners on reddit.  Why am I not sending E-mails then? Because I don't care."

Pretends to care about ethics, when really, because they grew up in the age of torrents, they're just entitled and want everything for nothing."

Rockstar is hostile to player-made content, that's what this thread is about, you can hardly tout that as a value proposition when it comes to pricing.  What do you gain from identifying your interests as a consumer with the publisher's pricing strategy? A warm fuzzy feeling when you fork out $60 for a 2 year old game? I bought the game for $30 on Nuuvem anyway."
pcgaming,3czz13,NordstrmNomenklatura,4,Sun Jul 12 18:12:23 2015 UTC,"So PC gamers are supposed to pay twice the current price of the console version for a new version, because it has features tailored to the platform?    Yes. The game did not release for PC at the same time that it release for consoles. As such, the price of the game dropping will be delayed. There would be no point in porting it if they had to release it at the same price of a three year old game."
pcgaming,3czz13,BrainSlurper,6,Sun Jul 12 18:52:06 2015 UTC,The thing is though $60 has gotten me over a hundred hours of gameplay so I would say $60 is worth it.

pcgaming,3czz13,Commisar,2,Sun Jul 12 17:09:02 2015 UTC,"I don't see how that's a good comparison.   The game has ALWAYS been $60, on ALL platforms. It never got cutdown, not even on the 360 and PS3 (game is still listed as $60 everywhere).    It's not like they re-raised the price specifically for PC, the game has stayed listed at $60 for the past 2 years.   Some people may feel that they should have cut it down by now, however the people calling them ""scumbags"" and crap for not releasing the game at a cut down price, when they never promised they would, are simply stupid.   NONE of R*'s previous actions could lead a sensible person to conclude they would release the game sub $60. All other Rockstar games that come out late on PC, have always been released at full price on the PC.  If you expected GTA V to be the exception to that rule, the only person you have to blame is yourself."

If they released a 4K, FPS unlocked, graphically upgraded well running port of Red Dead Redemption with it's DLC I would personally pay the release price for it, and I bet 100,000s of other PC gamers would.  This whole attitude of bring your games to PC, but we aren't paying you full price for the privilege even if you add content and well optimise it, is what is going to stop games being ported, not piracy or any perception of PC as a dying market (which it isn't it's growing).  Personally if Square Enix bring the next Tomb Raider to PC and it's a brilliant game and a great port I'll pay them full price for it, I don't have an XBOX1 and I wont be buying one anytime soon and I don't want to discourage any dev from bringing their games to PC. I'll buy the Master Chief Collection if the port is good at full price as well because I want it on PC and I want them to do the work and feel their is enough profit in doing it to bother."

pcgaming,3czz13,Heatranoveryou,14,Sun Jul 12 17:10:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  You forgot in your opinion in your last sentence. There's a lot of people that game mainly or exclusively on PC who would like to see Pubs/Devs encouraged to port more to PC and are willing to pay them the money they need to be encouraged to do it.   If Microsoft do release MCC on PC for instance I'll give them my money, if it's a good port, and as you are not going to part with your cash for the games you want, your opinion matters little to the industry or those of us who are willing to pay.  ""Everything is worth what its purchaser will pay for it"" over 2000 years old and still spot on. You can't have your cake and eat it, you can't demand these games are on PC but refuse to pay for them at the price being asked, and if you do, well you wait until the market adjusts to a price point you are willing to pay. Or you just don't buy it out of principle if that's the way you feel, I couldn't care less about whether you do or your opinion of the rest of us that are willing to pay the money for the products we want."

pcgaming,3czz13,Jjiinx,3,Mon Jul 13 06:03:11 2015 UTC,Such great value. I put 30ish hours into SP.  I'm going back now to replay it after putting more than 200 hours into online.  That's amazing value for the 45 dollars I paid for it.

I don't care.  I finished GTAV and got my time out of the multiplayer.  They can shoot their flavor-of-last-month in the foot all they want, and it doesn't affect me in the slightest.

Customer service horror stories were everywhere when GTAV launched on PC.  I waited three weeks to get a response on a ticket and even then it was a canned copy/paste deal and they never solved my problem.  Their phone reps were actually instructed to hang up on people whose RSC accounts had been compromised."

They are not against mods, but they simply don't give a shit about the modding of GTA V (or any of their game anyway, because that's not what help them selling more copies).  Edit: reminder: downvote = don't contribute to the conversation, not = I don't like what he say (good or bad) about my favorite game or developer.

Plus, as other said, GTA Online and the Cash cards.

They probably couldn't give a shit about what you do in singleplayer, but as it stands, Online uses the same code as singleplayer, so this is the only way. It's a shame that they're both not sepperate games, so blocking mods in singleplayer is just a side effect of actions taken against hacking in Online."

pcgaming,3czz13,Saccharose,2,Sun Jul 12 12:44:42 2015 UTC,I'd rather they not sacrifice one for the other since lots of people hate GTA:O and love mods.  Maybe seperate executables for online vs singleplayer.

There are no emulators (a piece of software that pretends it's a different piece of hardware) that exist to run Xbox software within Windows  Edit: I can grammar, I swearz"
pcgaming,3d6fzr,DeniedExistence,4,Mon Jul 13 22:06:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I have always known what emulators are, but never understood them completely until your analogy. I read somewhere that Xbox One and PS4 are closer to PC coding than ever before, so Emulators would be easier to make."
pcgaming,3d6fzr,DeniedExistence,12,Mon Jul 13 22:13:09 2015 UTC,"Technically, yes X1 and PS4 are more akin to a traditional PC than the last generations were. But so far emulation hasn't been quite successful. Doesn't mean it can't happen, just means it hasn't happened yet.  As for software coding, the X1 and Windows technically can execute the same code (and this is getting even more true once Windows 10 rolls out and universal application development becomes more prevalent). It's just when the code is compiled it's targeted at a specific set of API's (underlying fiddly bits in the OS that allow a piece of software to execute properly) which allow the code to execute. Couple this with the layers of DRM that are applied to console media and operating systems, it makes it pretty substantially different than simply running on PC.  (In all honesty there isn't, and has never been, any reason what so ever that a game that is Xbox or PS4 exclusive could not run on either platform or PC for that matter other than corporate greed. This is where exclusivity comes in. They are only locked down because someone shoveled a truck load of money down someone else's throat to lock it down)"

I found this article really explained it well. It's starting to show its age, but the underlying principles are the same.   Something the article doesn't touch on is that as the platforms get closer (like the move to all of them being on x86, which is the change you referred to), relying on tricks like the ones he had issues with will be less and less common."
pcgaming,3d6fzr,zylli42,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:31:12 2015 UTC,"Emulators require far more hardware power to emulate because they use software to make the computer pretend it is a different piece of hardware.  Computers are ahead of current consoles, but not as much as computers are ahead of older consoles like PS1.  If an emulator could be made, it would not run well on current computer hardware.  The only other option is to make the game run natively in Windows.  This means the XBox has to run Windows, too.  It might run a stripped-down version of Windows, but the differences are too great due to the hardware limitations of the consoles.  An emulator may exist some day, but not anytime soon."

It's creating a piece of software that pretends it's a particular piece of hardware to run software that is dependent upon that hardware."

It's very likely that there will be a special series of cards made just for the XBOX of the AMD 1234 for card that have a chip or serial number that says ""only trust me, I'm a genuine XBOX card"" - and that without being able to crack that code, substituting one card for another won't work."

pcgaming,3d6fzr,lmaotank,9,Mon Jul 13 22:10:23 2015 UTC,That's not completely true though. Xbox OS (specifically the Xbox One OS) is a highly specialized variant of Windows 8 (and very soon a variant of Windows 10). Xbox still executes C++ code. The difference is in the specific API calls that software on Windows desktop vs XboxOS can use

pcgaming,3d0aoh,I_eat_Narwhals,5,Sun Jul 12 22:16:53 2015 UTC,i've always wondered about WDDM 2.0. Does it apply to every game out there?
pcgaming,3d0aoh,Zakman--,14,Mon Jul 13 01:43:08 2015 UTC,Yes. If you are running Windows 10 drivers on windows 10 you will benefit from the features of Wddm 2. It's an improvement on the driver level that has significantly reduced cpu usage/bottlenecking
pcgaming,3d0aoh,smokeey,3,Sun Jul 12 14:00:31 2015 UTC,Only in dx11+ games i assume?
pcgaming,3d0aoh,fakhar362,5,Sun Jul 12 15:19:31 2015 UTC,No in everything. It has nothing to with direct x because the way windows communicates with the drivers are better. Has nothing to do with what game you're running.
pcgaming,3d0aoh,smokeey,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:56:59 2015 UTC,"Hopefully this works in witcher 1, playing it because Witcher 3 came out  I have 4690k @ 3.9 Ghz and everywhere i get 100-300 fps but in the trade quarter(ch 3) the fps just tanks to 40-50 and it refuses to just utilise the resources it's given"
pcgaming,3d0aoh,fakhar362,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:04:40 2015 UTC,"The reason TW1 does that is because it was never optimized to to run on multi-core CPU's. Next time you play the game, open up task manager and watch your single core performance. When you get those framerate drops, I'd be willing to bet that one core is pegged at 100% load during those times."

pcgaming,3d0aoh,JohnnyC4ge,5,Mon Jul 13 01:12:56 2015 UTC,Yup.   Windows 8 started out with WDDM 1.2 which had various performance upgrades over WDDM 1.1 (win7)
pcgaming,3d0aoh,frosty122,-13,Sun Jul 12 17:56:10 2015 UTC,"Not really. WDDM 2.0 is not based on AMD's Mantle per-se (Although Vulcan is) but does borrow and use a lot of the same ""close-to-metal""  ideas. The gain in windows 8 over windows 7 is largely to due with just iterative performance improvements in the driver. I'm sure someone can be more specific, but the gain for Windows 10 is very much to do with Mantle which wasn't available for Windows 8 launch.   AMD GPUs will benefit the most from the move, as you can see in the video above."

However I did a clean install and I recommend most people do the same.   Burn a windows 10 USB, boot from it, and format your C drive and install it there.

Also move default folders (particularly documents since a lot of programs and games save shit there) to that second HDD. Just the OS and your programs go on your SSD.

Its kind of finicky right now as I am trying to do a lot of the things I was doing in my Windows 7 installation like installing themes, applying registry tweaks and so on.  That stuff has been taking up most of my time but I did get to test Arma 3 and The Witcher 3 today.  So Arma 3 I used a scenario called Terrorist Hunt as thats what me and my friends been playing a lot together. I would get anywhere from 35-50 FPS before and now I get 45-55. So a definite improvement, more consistency.  For Witcher 3 I would get an avg of 62 FPS with drops down to 45 FPS. I recently found a setup for games where you enable Vsync and limit your FPS 2 below your native Hz. So I set mine to 58. Now in The Witcher 3 I get constant 58 FPS, no drops, not even to 57.9. Unlocking the FPS, the numbers jumped to 83 FPS. Huge improvement! My Witcher 3 is maxed btw, only thing on high is Foliage Visibility. Setting it to ultra dropped my FPS by 20.

The best scenario is if they rewrite the engine for DirectX 12 taking full advantage of it's features and threading, WDDM 2.0 and multiadapter. Right there you have the potential for 4 compounding 'boosts' which could completely transform the game.  If you have a Google, I think I seen hints they may actually be doing that."

pcgaming,3d0aoh,DragonDai,3,Mon Jul 13 02:10:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Something here is broken. Those specs should run basically whatever the fuck you want. The main culprit I can think of is overheating. Are you monitoring your temps? Another good question is did you put this together yourself or did you buy it out of the box?  Either way, seriously, there is something wrong here. A piece of hardware is malfunctioning and you're gana need to figure out what and get it replaced."
pcgaming,3d0aoh,restlessdraugr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:51:32 2015 UTC,"What's a good way to monitor temps of my card and CPU? Is there one that will record max temp so I can leave it running in the background and check what temp it is when the computer crashes?   I did put this together myself and I'm really hoping I didn't fuck something up. If something is malfunctioning, how am I supposed to figure out exactly what it is? I don't know how I can pinpoint it."
pcgaming,3d0aoh,DragonDai,2,Mon Jul 13 03:07:38 2015 UTC,"HWMonitor by CPUID  http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html  I am fairly certain that's the right place to get it. I've had my copy for so long I don't remember where I got it from.  It's a super light weight program that will record your max and min temps as well as keep track of them live. So yeah, you can boot it, minimize it, and check it later.  HOWEVER, the free version has no way to record logs, as far as I know, so if you're comp crashes/shuts down on you/BSOD, the max temps will be erased.  So, my suggestion is just run something in windowed mode so you can watch the monitor in real time.   Keep the reader in celsius, even if you're used to reading fahrenheit. That'll make it easier for you to compare your temps to the manufacturers recommended temps and the like. That being said, if any of your CPU cores or your GPU ever goes about about 75 degrees celsius, you have a cooling problem (NOTE: your system shouldn't start behaving badly until like 90 degrees celsius, but generally anything above 70-75 while the computer is under heavy load is indicative of an issue somewhere).  It may be as simple as ""clean your case and make sure your fans are working."" It could be something slightly more complex but still easily fixable like ""forgot to remove clear film from CPU heatsink"" or ""didn't apply thermal paste properly."" And it could also be something awful like ""GPU's fans are dead, time to RMA that shit.""  But yeah, if you're experiencing crashes/computer shutting off/BSOD and you're not monitoring your temps, 9 times out of 10, you're overheating something, especially if those symptoms only occur while the computer is under a heavy load (like when playing a graphic heavy video game)."
pcgaming,3d0aoh,restlessdraugr,2,Mon Jul 13 03:50:26 2015 UTC,"Ok So I just tried playing Arkham Origins (one of the games I have issues with) In windowed mode with the monitoring program beside it. My CPU temps are all good. All cores stay mostly in the low 50s and never go above 60. The GPU, on the other hand, quickly got to 70c and after about 30 seconds of gameplay reached 75c, and then 76c. Not long after the game crashed. So this means my GPU overheating is the problem right? I would be a bit more confident if the temps had gone even higher but 76c seems higher than it should. The program said the GPU fans were going though, and I have a window in my case and I can see both fans spinning when I play games.  EDIT: Also noticed in the program that my fan % is only getting to max 34%... could this be the issue? Would turning off the manual fan control and setting it around 50% or something solve the problem? Also noticed MSI Afterburner has a ""max temp"" feature so I guess I could use that instead if you think manually turning up the fans would fix it."
pcgaming,3d0aoh,DragonDai,2,Mon Jul 13 04:36:18 2015 UTC,"76c is hot. But it shouldn't be causing your GPU to BSOD your computer. Your card should start throttling around 90c and probably shut down to avoid damage around 100c (nVidea says max safe temp is 98c), according to the manufacturer. So yeah, the temp on your graphics card is something to be concerned about, but unlikely to be causing your issue.  Next step, if you feel comfortable doing so, would be to crack open your case while it's running and just visually double check that the GPU fans are running, if possible. Don't touch the insides of your computer while it's running, don't try to stick anything in the fans, etc. But if you can eyeball the fans running, that's a good idea, just in case.  Again, ONLY do this if you're 100% comfortable with what you're doing and you're sure you can eyeball the GPU fans without touching anything inside. I will not be held responsible if you brick your machine or electrocute yourself. lol  After that, you likely want to get at the specific BSOD you're computer is reporting. You'll want a program called BlueScreenView, available here:   http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html  This program should be run after the computer crashes, once you've rebooted (although you can probably run it now...your computer may still have the previous BSOD saved). It'll let you look at the actual BSOD your computer displayed for a microsecond before rebooting when it crashed.  If that program can't find anything, you may need to wait/force your computer to crash again. If your problem IS overheating, every time your computer crashes, you're possibly causing permanent damage to your hardware (whichever piece is overheating). So it's best if you can view an old BSOD rather than get a new one, but you may have no other options.  If you get a crash after installing the program and the program still has nothing in it, that means your computer isn't BSODing and it's something even more fundamental (like a faulty power supply or bad connections or something). If this is the case, it's going to be  a bitch to diagnose no matter what the problem is, and I doubt I can help you any further.  On the other hand, if BlueScreenView has some BSOD for you to look at, that should point you in the right direction as to figuring out what's wrong (even if what's wrong IS overheating).   You're mostly interested in the STOP code near the bottom, but the line near the top that reads, ""The problem seems to be caused by..."" might also be of some use.  My advice is google the stop code and see what comes up. If you get anything back you don't understand, bring it back here and I'll try to help, but chances are good that whatever info you get from googling the stop code is going to be FAR more informative than anything I can tell you.  Anyway, hope that helps :D"
pcgaming,3d0aoh,Crab-Battle,2,Mon Jul 13 05:43:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the help. I can very clearly see both GPU fans spinning through my case window so I don't think taking the panel off will be necessary. I downloaded and installed the program and then made my PC crash by playing crysis 2 in DX11. I had also crashed it a few minutes earlier in Arkham Origins (before the program was installed) interestingly, there's only one crash report, from 10 days ago. I've had plenty of crashes since then, but this one from 10 days ago says it was caused by ""dxgkrnl.sys"". Here's a screenshot of what the program's telling me. http://i.imgur.com/sZVKZEh.png  Also wanted to add that when the crashes happen the sound glitches and then stops, the screen goes black but my peripherals stay on. Then the peripherals and their lights go off, then back on again. I've watched them do this for like 10 minutes straight after a crash before eventually holding the power button to restart."
pcgaming,3d0aoh,SystemErrorz,3,Mon Jul 13 06:03:12 2015 UTC,"Okay, so, from the SS, you're STOP code is the Bug Check code.  Do a google on that and the dxgkrnl.sys for more info, but from what I gathered in my 10 seconds of googling, that sounds like a display driver issue. Basically, something's causing your display driver to crash and Windows can't get it to reboot...so you get a BSOD.  This is VERY consistent with the physical symptoms you list (sound glitching, screen black but peripherals still on, etc).   The only downside here is that you're not getting a BSOD every time you crash. If you were, it would make me a lot more confident in this diagnosis. But just because you're not getting a BSOD doesn't mean your display drivers aren't at fault.  So, the way to go about solving that issue would be to delete ANYTHING related to nVidea off your machine and then redownload the drivers, do a clean install, and hopefully that will sort you out. This should be the next step you try to get yourself back up and running. If this doesn't solve your problem for the most part, than we're looking at a different problem altogether. You might still occasionally get display driver crashes even with updated drivers. Sometimes it just happens. Witcher 3 is notorious for them right now, even with the most recent drivers. But they should be a rare occurrence, not a constant guarantee.  As for how to get the new drives, you can do it manually, but I prefer using the GeForce Experience program. A lot of people don't like the GeForce Experience program, but I've never had any problems with it and really recommend people use it for driver upkeep. Makes the whole process super easy.  Anyway, deleting all your old drivers is gana take a while and a clean installs gana take a while too. But do that, try to runs some games, and see how it goes. I'll be around if you're still having issues."
pcgaming,3d0aoh,restlessdraugr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:24:26 2015 UTC,Real Temp is good and easy to use. It can display temp in your task bar while minimized.  MSI afterburner is great for monitoring your GPU and CPU and has on on screen display feature you can use to keep an eye on temp.   Unfortunatly I'm not sure about recording temp after a crash.  I'd start with those.
pcgaming,3d0aoh,Ray_Banci,2,Mon Jul 13 06:40:32 2015 UTC,This kind if sounds like you might have a dud card or a failing power supply.
pcgaming,3d0aoh,restlessdraugr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:19:33 2015 UTC,"You might have a damaged card. But before I decide on that, I have to tell you to check all the power connections, the thermals, and everything else including a clean install of Windows. If all else fails, RMA the card."
pcgaming,3d0aoh,Ray_Banci,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:13:21 2015 UTC,"I'll probably wait till I try Windows 10 before doing that. All power connections look good and everything stays pretty cool. I don't think it's a faulty card as I can run non DX11 games, (ones that are much newer and better looking than the ones I'm trying to run) just fine. Is there anything with the directx software itself that I could try to fix? Anything else simple it could be? Also, is it possible my 600W PSU may not be big enough?"
pcgaming,3d0aoh,squish8294,3,Mon Jul 13 02:56:32 2015 UTC,I don't think there's anything specific with the API that you can do.  Each DirectX has some hardware features it might use depending on the game. Just because you can run some games fine doesn't mean your card isn't faulty. I wouldn't wait until Windows 10 comes around since your setup is more than enough to run just about any DX11 game at medium and higher. If you wait until Windows 10 you'll be on a platform for which drivers aren't mature and you'll have to wrestle with that too.
pcgaming,3d0aoh,thatnitai,-1,Mon Jul 13 03:01:56 2015 UTC,Mate you might have installed a 32bit OS which is resulting in these crashes

pcgaming,3d0aoh,thatnitai,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:42:58 2015 UTC,"Like other people have suggested it could be overheating however your PC would shut off and not really ""crash""  It could very well be a bad seal on your CPU. If I were you I would re apply the paste and put the cooler back on  If it was your psu again your PC would just shut off  So it's either a. Your gpu which you can benchmark and stress test to see if that's the problem, or its the motherboard  The next steps you should take are:  Stress test both your CPU and gpu and monitor the temps. Go online and look up the upper heat limit of your parts. Your 970 has a huge upper limit of 98C but while stressed it should ideally be around ~48 or lower  Next do a ram stress test. Temps aren't as big an issue for ram but make sure it's not the ram  After you've done all these tests and your PC has not crashed I would pin point it to your motherboard"

It's essentially what DX12 is all about now, on Win10 the DX11 has that feature set to allow multithreading, hence the performance boost on existing DX11 games WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A NEW ENGINE.  While DX12 has more features than DX11 and YES in that case a game would have to be written for DX12 to use ALL of DX12's features it does bring better DX11 performance to the table for Win 10 adopters."

This is most painfully obvious when you, for example, want to configure your network and you click the systray and you enter the Metro network settings screen which has fucking no options whatsoever. This is compared to the Classic UI for the same screen, which has heaps of options and allows you to actually get a lot of shit done. Again, this is one example among many."

The response that came out of this was that the community designed concepts and ideas for a third party launcher that had the community features, but for the storefront if pulled info from a bunch of different services, such as gmg, gog, steam, origin, uplay etc. I haven't followed development since a group formed up to turn this concept into a reality, but judging by this video it seems to be coming along nicely.   TLDR: The idea for project ascension was born from PCMR but its not a PCMR thing."

The only differences between Chromium and Chrome is that Chrome comes with third party add-ons such as Flash, where in Chromium you have to install that manually, as well as a slower release schedule.

In that case (not trying to be arsy, just confused), what is the purpose of the program when you can add non-steam games to steam?

pcgaming,3d0010,roastjelly,2,Sun Jul 12 16:27:55 2015 UTC,I dunno. The only thing I can guess is that it automatically pulls your entire library without having to manually add everything. Because if it can't do that it's completely useless IMO.
pcgaming,3d0010,Darius510,2,Sun Jul 12 18:14:37 2015 UTC,"Adding games that use different launchers to Steam can be a bit finicky and doesn't always work right. For example, adding Titanfall breaks the Origin overlay and there's no in game substitute for many features provided by said overlay. I just want a launcher that can tell the respective client to launch the game and then not interfere after.  As for having all the games in one launcher, I often will look through my library to pick a title. I usually open Steam, but rarely Origin. Because of this I've put 300 hours into Saints Row 3 and Battlefield Bad Company 2 has sat half finished for 7 months."
pcgaming,3d0010,pulley999,-2,Sun Jul 12 23:34:43 2015 UTC,Well achievements ussually only get recorded if they are played in the corrwctlauncher. I bought switcher 3 from gog did non steam game. No steam achievements.
pcgaming,3d0010,dragooner00,2,Sun Jul 12 17:26:59 2015 UTC,"Hahaha. You don't get Steam achievements because is not a Steam game, it has nothing to do with the launcher.

I don't know if GOG Galaxy has achievements enabled already or not but you'd get your achievements there since it's the GOG version."

A lot of pain in that area is referred from other parts of the body too.  The upper back and neck.   And never let anyone tell you it is carpal tunnel unless confirmed by a legit hand doctor.

pcgaming,3d0xvg,PillowTalk420,2,Mon Jul 13 03:00:56 2015 UTC,"Check out the hand exercise videos that have been posted in the last few days. They can help stretch, strengthen and relieve pain in your wrists, elbow and shoulders.  Also keep good posture:   Sit straight up, as far back as possible. Feet flat on the floor, knees bent perpendicular to your chair. keep your arms straight, and raised while using the controls. Do not rest your wrists while typing or using the mouse; keep your palms elevated above them. Rest only when you are at rest. Take a 10-15 minute break for every hour at your desk.   Everyone suggesting to find a comfortable place to rest your hands/wrists: THIS IS WRONG AND CAN BE BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH! Carpal Tunnel is caused by swelling in the carpal tunnel region of the wrist; a very small passageway filled with blood vessels, muscle and other tissue. Resting your wrist on any surface, comfortable or not, constricts this passage even further while actively using your hand muscles, leading to more swelling.  Carpal tunnel is no joke. It's not just a pain, like artheritis. It can lead to loss of muscle control in your hands (starting with the thumbs), weakened joints in the elbow and fingers, and even cause stiffness and pain in your shoulders and neck.  Source: Have carpal tunnel from years of gaming with poor posture. The exercises and good practices I've learned in the last 5 years have helped me go from having hardly any feeling at all in my right thumb to having almost as much dexterity I did in high-school."

pcgaming,3d0xvg,harpuajim25,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:58:44 2015 UTC,"It should be based on your own height and chair.  Assuming your feet are flat on the floor, observe the following to adjust your height:   If your knees are elevated from the chair, you are too low. If you can't keep your feet level on the floor, you're too high.   You may end up needing to be a little off, if your desk itself is a little too high or too low, but it shouldn't be that bad on your posture, either."

pcgaming,3d0xvg,bananakonda,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"Do you wrest your wrist directly on the desk when you use the mouse and keyboard?  A few years back I was getting serious wrist pain.  I looked online and did lots of things, icing and heating, stretching, and buying various ""ergonomic"" (or so they claimed) wrist rests.  The answer that actually worked was to stop wresting my wrists at all.  When you use your mouse, make sure your wrist isn't touching the desk, even though that feels like it takes less effort.  When you type, make sure your wrists are not touching the desk.  Pull the keyboard closer to you if that's an issue.  Wrest your forearms but not your wrists on the desk if your arms are fatigued (although that isn't good for you either, tbh).  Try to keep your arm and hand in a sort of straight alignment when using the mouse, too.  Don't have extreme angles at your wrist in regular usage.  Once I did that, the wrist pain went away and never came back.  The various stretches other people have posted here also can help, but stop resting your wrist on the desk surface."

Yes, this may mean less time on the computer, but you'll thank yourself later. I have also found it helpful to keep a glove-like support which my local pharmacy sells, it keeps the wrist straight so I can keep it relaxed.  In the long term you should get a doctor's opinion on it, if the pain doesn't go away. And follow advice on this thread about office ergonomics.  I don't recommend doing more with the hand when it is in pain, as some here recommend. You have to get rid of the problem first before beginning the strengthening exercise."

Every time I went to the doctor they just told me to take a break, or take some painkillers. Went to a physiotherapist instead, and he immediately figured out that it was an issue in my spine. He cracked my back, and it went away immediately. It came back shortly after, because where and how I worked sucked, but I had it cracked again (and a few more times by a friend--but be careful how and how often you do this), and all the stretching I've been doing has apparently helped keep everything from misaligning too much, because I've been good for a while now (although I've been on the computer like twice a week since, due to changed circumstances).

It doesn't harm anything so you can really do it as often as you'd like.  The best tips are still making sure you have the right posture (lots of articles online about the correct posture for screen work), making sure you aren't overexerting yourself, take breaks, and do the exercises to help prevent pain.  Some people also use way more force than need be when using the computer. You only need to use a light touch and click the mouse just hard enough to hear the click - Still many people press down on the keys superhard, as if the keys and buttons register better when they are pressed hard (they do not)  Learning keyboard shortcuts is also a good way to reduce the work you do and reduce the strain. So is learning typing.  Also some people have other cables tugging on their mouse cable so they need to pull the cable slight when moving the mouse - Make sure the cable is not being tugged on and perhaps put something slightly heavy on the part of the cord that is on your desk so the weight of the entire cable does not pull the mouse but on the part after the object you put on the wire.  BTW since this is about ergonomics, remember to have good lighting to work by, no glare on the monitor, and maybe use f.lux to help reduce eyestrain during the evenings and nights by the computer."

pcgaming,3d0aj4,twizzlebizzle21,6,Sun Jul 12 20:53:50 2015 UTC,His claim in the video is that AMD is going to benefit more from DX12 than NVidia because DX12 took away from Mantle.

pcgaming,3d0aj4,JohnnyC4ge,3,Sun Jul 12 20:58:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my point was more related to wouldn't they both beñefit from the api regardless if amd was taken via mantle.  There is nothing specific to amd as to why it can access to mantle as its open and Intel/nvidia can tailor their hardware.    The DX12 api should access both hardware and return similar benefits?"

IF anything I think any impact Mantle might have (if it even has an impact) would be felt on ""older"" cards i.e. pre-maxwell since AMD has been designing cards since GCN 1.0 to run mantle whereas Nvidia has most likely been designing the competing cards for DX11.   I don't know enough about Mantle or DX12 personally to say how much hardware design will play a role in how well said hardware performs under these APIs."

pcgaming,3d0aj4,AT_93,13,Sun Jul 12 19:06:01 2015 UTC,"And its only AMD's fault that their cards don't overclock as well as Maxwell.   The voltage on Fiji still can't be changed (AFAIK) so really it's too early to say this (that they dont' overclock as well).  Unwinder (the guy that does rivatuner) has already said there's a delay because he didn't get a review sample when others did and AMDs voltage is harder to code for than Nvidias.  Ultimately, this is still AMDs fault that at launch they're cards can barely be OC'd."

pcgaming,3d0aj4,SPOOFE,2,Sun Jul 12 19:51:41 2015 UTC,"Fair point, but it's nearly guaranteed that bumping up the voltage is going to net a higher OC.  How much, we don't really know."
pcgaming,3d0aj4,JohnnyC4ge,-1,Sun Jul 12 20:19:17 2015 UTC,You do realize that unlocking voltage doesn't magically help a graphic card oc with 100 more mhz. 20-50  more mhz more is all you get. Temperature and power % usage efficiency are more important to ocing. That's why Maxwell overclocks so well.
pcgaming,3d0aj4,AT_93,5,Sun Jul 12 20:12:11 2015 UTC,"I'm getting +110 mhz on my card right now because the voltage is ramped up.  it's also a conservative overvolt I could probably get more.  Temperature is very important yeah, the Fury X has significant temperature headroom for OC'ing though, but the headroom isn't going to be used until it can be overvolted."
pcgaming,3d0aj4,JohnnyC4ge,3,Sun Jul 12 20:21:15 2015 UTC,Is that an extra 110 mhz over what you get without voltage? I believe this is what the guy is saying and you didn't specify.  What card is this btw?

pcgaming,3d0aj4,AT_93,5,Sun Jul 12 21:51:20 2015 UTC,"I'm getting +110 mhz after voltage increase, as in I'm getting 110 mhz that are unobtainable without increasing the voltage.  I don't know where your getting this 20-50 mhz figure from but it's inaccurate when speaking about GPUs in general.  Perhaps for specific models of GPUs this is true, but for every GPU ever made it's simply isn't."

pcgaming,3d0aj4,bjt23,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:32:08 2015 UTC,"Also, at 4k, you don't need to use as much AA.  Kind of like how you don't need motion blur past 24 fps."
pcgaming,3d0aj4,Rodot,-1,Sun Jul 12 22:42:17 2015 UTC,"you don't need motion blur above 24fps   That's the first I've heard of this, motion blur looks better at higher framerates,"
pcgaming,3d0aj4,MonsuirJenkins,5,Mon Jul 13 03:14:45 2015 UTC,...the point of motion blur is to make up for low frame rates
pcgaming,3d0aj4,tchoob,2,Mon Jul 13 06:00:41 2015 UTC,"In movies, in games it's to add to the aesthetic, like dof or Cr, and it has much higher precision at 60 than it does at 30  If you ""didn't need it above 24"" then 30fps games wouldn't use it, and especially 60fps games wouldn't, yet they do"
pcgaming,3d0aj4,MonsuirJenkins,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:47:11 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with the ""don't need t above 24fps"" thing. However, you don't need it at 60, but at 30 it looks jittery and terrible without. It's used to simulate a fade between frames so that it doesn't look as jumpy."
pcgaming,3d0aj4,tchoob,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:58:49 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think it's ever ""needed"" but well done it can improve the image at any frame rate, stuff like MGSV uses it well even though it's 60 fps,  and I don't think 30 FPS is any better with motion blur on   Also I much prefer object motion blur to camera blur, but usually you can't have the former without the latter   Over doing it, I'd rather it was never there.  I almost never use it because so many developers get it wrong. and I definitely turn it off in games where I'm getting low frame rates, because it makes the image too blurry and the persistence is too long with blurry frames on screen"

I play with a 7970 and use mostly high/Ultra settings with shadows and foliage distance on medium and get 46-60fps consistently.  The PS4 version struggles to hold 20fps in a few areas and texture quality (or streaming?) is sorely lacking in some areas. Not kidding, look at the Digital Foundries performance review of the PS4 version - they have a few videos of it and it shows it struggling hard in a lot of cases."

pcgaming,3d2mry,Nose-Nuggets,2,Mon Jul 13 01:18:50 2015 UTC,"ill second PC for you, if only because your rig is at least equal to a PS4 and you have the option to tailor quality vs performance to your liking. If you want it to look as good as PS4 you can and have it perform at least as good if not better in most places - if you want to sacrifice a little quality to get a higher consist FPS you at least have that option, an option not available at all on PS4."
pcgaming,3d2mry,Spawn3323,-1,Mon Jul 13 01:29:45 2015 UTC,Also consider the price. £60 still on consoles and you can get it for as little as £25 on Cdkeys or g2a for PC.

I usually don't get super immersed in the story (currently, I end up skipping through most of the secondary quest dialogs in TW3), buy the way it was narrated, and with all the characters and their back stories and the plot and everything, I was quite emotionally attached to their world. I was sad cause I knew I wouldn't find another game with such a gripping story for a long time, and I was sorta right. Still haven't found anything.

It makes all these little stories within the world actually hit you, unlike something like skyrim where its just filler and quest starters.

It is one of the few games I've ever played where I had a true sense of panic, excitement and adrenaline rush all at the same time. Being stranded on a station full of monsters is not something I like playing, but I went from beginning to end with that game. To this day, I sometimes have to turn on the lights in my hallway in the middle of the night as I go to the bathroom/kitchen, because the game shook me that much. Silly, I know, but it did affect me emotionally that I think everyone who can stomach it should play it."

The fourth time you are presented with the option of saving them but at the cost wiping you from existence, doing so wipes your friends and families memories of you as well and deletes your save file. The ending is very hollow and with deleting your save file you feel very hollow when the games credits roll and you realized just how final and big your sacrifice was."

The Walking Dead Season 1 was another that made me feel heavy, but not at all to this extent. It's like the feeling I get after watching Lord of the Rings or a movie of that nature.   I end up just loading the game and wander through Aard Skellig aimlessly...such a beautiful and atmospheric setting."
pcgaming,3d0e4s,Sacred_Warrior,4,Sun Jul 12 13:28:55 2015 UTC,"Witcher 3 hit me really hard, even though I got a good ending. I was just depressed for days after beating it.

pcgaming,3d0e4s,crisscrosses,2,Sun Jul 12 16:07:52 2015 UTC,"I got the worst ending. No spoilers but those who know, know. All the things I did in the game... well over a hundred hours of being a good person. The ending comes down to a handful of bullshit choices that seem trivial at the time. And because I made those choices that affected that person, I'm not allowed a happy ending or any kind of relationship? It all comes down to choosing to throw snowballs or drink beer. Gah it makes me more angry than any other game ever has.  I didn't play the Witcher series prior to the release of 3. So I played the first two and went straight into 3 at launch. The first 2 had me wanting to watch every spinoff TV show and movie, read every book. Three had me feeling the same right up until the ending when everything I felt for the series got set on fire and tossed in front of a train."

Even though I got good endings that I was satisfied with and which do seem like the best endings possible, I agree that all these depend on 7 crucial choices. That's all. 5 for Ciri, one each with Yen and Triss.  I got lucky I didn't double dip with Yen. I didn't want to, but I almost chose the other choice just cause I wanted to toy with her feelings.   As for Ciri, I made four ""correct"" choices and one wrong one. Those again were kinda lucky to be honest.  The most important thing is, you played the game without spoilers and made choices organically. If you did so, don't fret about the endings."

I got the same ending you did too (the worst one), and the feeling that the hundred plus hours I put into the game didn't really matter to the ending, instead that it boiled down to four (five) choices, was kinda.. shitty.  Especially when it came to one of them spoiler.  I still want to finish the books, play the first and can't wait for the expansions, but the ending definitely left a very sour taste in my mouth after such an emotionally draining game."

The Sif fight was one of the saddest boss fights I've ever had, especially if you complete the DLC before-hand. He doesn't want to kill you, but he needs to in order to protect you, because he doesn't want you, like Artorias, to be consumed by the abyss. He's fighting you out of protection, and when you see him limping at the end of the fight, you feel like a complete monster.  Then there's the final boss: Spoiler  On top of all that just the general atmosphere of Lordran, the once striving land of lords now deserted filled mainly with hollows and (some) undead (again, a fall from grace), and of course the many melancholic dialogues you get from certain character's (i.e. the sense of no hope (which reminds me, oh Solaire, you made me cry in Lost Izalith :c )).  In general a very emotional game, though that is not to say that the game does not also have a great sense of (somewhat dark) humour and quite a few light, happier parts.

Although, OP, if you were to remove the latter classifier I'd also go with the (response a lot of people expect after the first one) stereotypical response Gone Home, too.  As despite feeling sad for the characters throughout, I was happy that they had escaped their household, having been with parents who treated me much the same way for being transgender. It's very interesting to think of an old, creaky house as somewhere someone calls home. Mucking through personal items, slowly reading and wondering about the world that created them. Gone Home's been one of the most monumental experiences in my gaming career.  inb4 Dear Esther isn't a game, Dear Esther is a walking simulator - yes.

But I suppose there's no reason you couldn't have a single row of 4 pins for a single port.

pcgaming,3d2u3v,vortex30,2,Mon Jul 13 16:49:04 2015 UTC,"Firstly it is very easy to find parts lists for decent prebuilt PC online, because any decent retailer will publish them, so you know what you're buying. I haven't dealt with one ever, but I can recall e.g. a large German retailer called One, where you can find the following for (converted) ~1300 US dollars: Example PC (scroll down for parts list, needs Javascript enabled).  I'm not saying that I would recommend this one or that you couldn't find a better one, but that's not the point either. Wherever you bought that 1200 USD PC that didn't have a dedicated graphics card in it (BTW ""HD gaming 4600"" is neither a graphics card nor a valid designation of a GPU): They either made a mistake not putting one in, ripped you off massively or sold you a workstation that maybe would contain (any of) a server-grade mainboard, CPU, RAM and storage instead of the cheaper, but less reliable (read: still reliable enough for gaming and daily computing needs), consumer electronics.  Secondly, building your own PC is, assuming you have a complete set of mutually compatible parts a bit like Lego. (e.g.: the RAM needs to be compatible with not only the slots on the mainboard, but also with memory controller on the CPU; usually these imply each other (that is, a CPU with compatible memory controller will only fit on a mainboard that allows compatible RAM to be fitted and a mainboard allowing compatible RAM to be fitted will only allow CPUs with compatible memory controller to fit), caveat emptor; second example: the PSU needs to provide sufficient power output and cables for e.g. the graphics card).  All ports and plugs you'll find in a modern PC are designed to be ""idiot-proof"" meaning that you can plug in 1. only compatible plugs and 2. those only in the right orientation (there are still idiots thinking they can plug something together when they can't and breaking hardware that way; don't become one of them). If they aren't, like these little pins that control various casing LEDs (commonly called HDD LED and power LED) and provide power to the on and reset buttons, wrong orientation will not cause permanent breakage.  In short: If your parts are mutually compatible and you don't physically break them while putting them together, your computer will work (barring other reasons for failure such a components that were broken in the first place or some power plugs not being plugged in (if your graphics card exposes two 6-pin sockets for power plugs you need two 6-pin power plugs to operate it at all)).  Now that you're bound to that shop you wasted your money in, it might be a good move to post excerpts from/a scan of (parts of) their catalogue here for further advice.  Oh, and your strawpoll might be seriously affected by sampling bias if you post it in this subreddit."

But you've got almost 99% of the job thats done, which is picking the right part. The rest is like playing Lego, you just screw the motherboard in the case, plug the graphics card, wire it all up with the help of youtube and BAM you're done. takes 30 mins. The hardest part is putting the CPU on the motherboard, which isn't hard in itself but you've got to be careful and take your time. Thats all.

Because 1200 bucks worth of parts is one hell of an upgrade over the list you picked out for 600 :p And it's a metric ton better than any 1200 dollar prebuilt anyone would sell you in a store.  A pre-built PC isn't magical in any way. Where a gaming console has very specific parts made for that specific machine, a prebuilt PC is just a list of parts that are available separately. You can obtain the list of parts in a pre-built PC, purchase those parts, put it together and have an absolutely identical device as the pre-built. However buying the parts separately ensures you have the freedom of choice to pick out the best combination of parts for your exact budget instead of what some company decided they wanted to get rid of. And it means you avoid paying the premium that companies charge you for the priviledge of getting scammed by them selling a shitty PC with a high-end processor as a 1500 dollar piece of crap labeled a gaming PC that could barely run minesweeper."

pcgaming,3d2u3v,Xtulu,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:47:25 2015 UTC,I built my own about two years ago. I had done some upgrading to my previous PC like power supply and GPU but never built a few computer. I hinestly just threw on a movie and went at er using mobo manual as guide. It was pretty easy.
pcgaming,3d2u3v,hatetheory2015,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:56:20 2015 UTC,"Answered the poll.  Seriously, build it yourself.  It's relatively easy, and you'll learn about all the parts in the process.  You'll also have a better understanding of what you can do to upgrade individual parts later as needed, thus spending less and increasing the lifespan of the PC.  Plus it's just fun to do, and you get to have exactly what you want.  Edit: Also, prebuilt machines should generally be opened up and checked to make sure parts didn't fall off during shipping, so you'd have to open it anyway."
pcgaming,3d2u3v,RippyZ,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:16:26 2015 UTC,"Wow... I built PCs as a thing to do in one of my tech classes in high school, but I knew the basics of PC building when I was still in middle school. PC building is not difficult at all. There are plenty of online configuration tools such as pcpartpicker, not to mention a plethora of particularly thorough PC building guides in both written and video formats. Also, Intel HD 4400 graphics are the integrated graphics on an entry-level processor. It is pretty garbage for just about anything except h.264 encoding/decoding. I would recommend a relatively inexpensive AMD build with a splurge on a Nvidia GTX 960, because it is a spectacular graphics card. Just be sure to buy quality where it counts: the motherboard, the GPU and the power supply. The processor doesn't have to be absolutely spectacular for gaming and everyday computing, but a cheap motherboard may kill components over time, as may a cheap power supply."

pcgaming,3d2u3v,atfsix,0,Sun Jul 19 17:37:59 2015 UTC,building a PC is easier than building most Lego sets seriously. All the pieces snap together if it looks like it doesn't fit in a certain slot then it doesn't extremely simple. Every part you buy will have easy to follow instructions and like the other guy said watch a few youtube videos don't rush and it's pretty much self explanatory. I'm the paranoid cautious type so i reread every thing like 3 times while i assembled my first PC lol you will probably do the same don't worry it's the smart thing to do the first time. In all honesty building a PC looks complicated because the parts are fancy circuit boards that most people don't understand so it looks scary once you put it together you will realize exactly what i said up above. To sum it all up any idiot can build a PC good luck convincing her buddy it really is that simple. Also those prebuilt PC's are just junk they overcharge and usually have way over priced them simply because building a PC is scary to older generations.

The major problem is that you can't see the difference between settings as you change them. Very few games let you do this, such as bioshock infinite. It's super important, because there are some effects that kill performance and barely make a difference.   Honestly we shouldn't even have to fiddle. There's no reason a game couldn't just load up a short benchmark representative of the worst the game has to offer. Then all you do is choose a resolution and frame rate, and it progressively raises or lowers settings automatically until it's as good as it can look at the target frame rate."

pcgaming,3d4reo,Trislar,10,Mon Jul 13 16:38:07 2015 UTC,Oh yeah. I'm also an expert games developer and i program at least two games a day.
pcgaming,3d4reo,destructor_rph,0,Mon Jul 13 16:42:08 2015 UTC,"I'd really rather have a proper discussion than antagonistic sarcasm.  I was basically telling you ""I keep up with this, this is my hobby, and I'm telling you that from everything we know, there is no reason at all to believe the Vive is superior to the Rift."" I don't see why that warrants your response.  What makes you think the HTC Vive is superior?"
pcgaming,3d4reo,destructor_rph,10,Mon Jul 13 16:46:38 2015 UTC,It's not owned by a company who make their money by selling data about their users private usage habits?

As for Facebook, that's not what they do, that's just a common misconception. They sell targeted advertising-the advertisers themselves do not get private information.  But I'm not interested in defending Facebook. You are fully able to choose to buy whatever you want based on business practices, but don't make incorrect claims about the products themselves."

pcgaming,3d4reo,Silky60FPS,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:55:19 2015 UTC,"You are free to not buy a product based on that sort of thing.  I have no interest in defending Facebook, I just want to set straight any misconceptions about the VR headsets themselves."
pcgaming,3d4reo,dtyujb,4,Mon Jul 13 17:02:59 2015 UTC,Yup. As soon as I heard about Oculus selling to Facebook I went off in search of alternatives. Great to see that many have been popping up. Now they just have to get the omnidirectional treadmills figured out.
pcgaming,3d4reo,Nose-Nuggets,3,Mon Jul 13 17:05:50 2015 UTC,"Many have been popping up, but only Vive and Morpheus are comparable in quality.  The rest all fall short in key specifications and the experience."
pcgaming,3d4reo,Nose-Nuggets,3,Mon Jul 13 17:08:22 2015 UTC,Vive uses laser tracking to determine your position in the room
pcgaming,3d4reo,Nose-Nuggets,2,Mon Jul 13 16:51:20 2015 UTC,Exhibit A
pcgaming,3d4reo,BeerGogglesFTW,3,Mon Jul 13 16:55:58 2015 UTC,"Woah wait, I will have lasers and light-orbs flashing through my living room? /jk"
pcgaming,3d4reo,BeerGogglesFTW,-2,Mon Jul 13 20:53:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm fully versed on exactly how Lighthouse works, but that doesn't answer my question.  The Rift uses a similar system that uses IR LEDs embedded under the  surface of the headset.  It too can determine your position in the room.   They both achieve the same result."
pcgaming,3d4reo,MadMorg,2,Mon Jul 13 16:53:58 2015 UTC,The vive does it with more precision. Ive seen many demos of it and each person said that they liked the vive experiance more.
pcgaming,3d4reo,Silky60FPS,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:11:21 2015 UTC,"Actually, as far as the revealed precision goes, Oculus's system is more precise.   Constellation (Oculus's IR LED tracking system): 0.05mm/0.05° precision Lighthouse (Valve's IR laser tracking system that the Vive uses) : <1mm/0.1° precision   But realistically, they will both be just as precise (sub-mm accuracy). Sub-mm is where humans can no longer perceive increases in precision.   Ive seen many demos of it and each person said that they liked the vive experiance more.   That isn't true.  Firstly, you have to make sure that you are't comparing Oculus Rift DK2 (from early 2014) and Vive (from mid 2015).  The Crescent Bay (late 2014) and Rift CV1 (mid 2015) is exactly as precise as Lighthouse.  Secondly, I've read the reviews from people who have tried both, and they all report the tracking being perfect on both."
pcgaming,3d4reo,DeadLeftovers,-3,Mon Jul 13 17:16:23 2015 UTC,Where are those numbers coming from? And are you retarded? Like mentally ill? I have seen numerous tech demos and i've heard the majority say they enjoyed the vive more.
pcgaming,3d4reo,DeadLeftovers,3,Mon Jul 13 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"Where are those numbers coming from?   Source for constellation numbers (Oculus): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxbh-TM5yNc&feature=youtu.be&t=2457  Source for lighthouse numbers (Valve): http://www.htcvr.com/ (scroll down)   And are you retarded? Like mentally ill?   I understand you're angry, because you had a preconceived view, and it's difficult to hear that that view is wrong, but there's no need for that sort of insult.   i've heard the majority say they enjoyed the vive more.   Now that's a different question.  Most people have only used the Rift but not also the Oculus Touch motion controllers.  They then go in and use the Vive and the SteamVR controllers, and of course it's more fun! That's because you're comparing Headset to Headset+Controllers!  But when people use Oculus's motion controllers too, we get an accurate comparison.  http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-06-24-oculus-touch-is-the-gold-standard-in-vr-control  http://gizmodo.com/oculus-touch-hands-on-so-damn-good-1712031397  http://www.pcgamer.com/the-oculus-touch-is-an-intuitive-exciting-vr-controller/  http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/hands-on-reaching-out-and-touching-someone-with-oculus-touch-controllers/"

pcgaming,3d4reo,EvilMDK,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:51:23 2015 UTC,"If the sunlight is really strong, yes. Natural sunlight contains a lot of IR."

pcgaming,3d4reo,dremic,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:12:58 2015 UTC,"I have tried. Under poor conditions, blinds opened and strong  sunlight flooding the room, there IS a small but noticeable degradation to tracking."
pcgaming,3d4reo,NigerianAsscheeks,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:21:44 2015 UTC,I've tested this with my Rift DK2. Even with the sun directly shining in- it still works perfectly.
pcgaming,3d4reo,Killing_Sin,0,Mon Jul 13 17:52:26 2015 UTC,"Unless it both filters and outputs a fuckton of IR, it will run into the same issues that TrackIR does with excessive sunlight. Which is to say that yes, a window without the shades drawn will fuck up its tracking."
pcgaming,3d4reo,b1khoa,4,Tue Jul 14 06:48:23 2015 UTC,Can you expand on why Rift is your preferred device?
pcgaming,3d4reo,shadow3467,4,Mon Jul 13 16:47:02 2015 UTC,"So my comment wasn't really meant to say that the Rift will be superior.  Rather, I was saying that they are both almost identical- to the point where there's no compelling reason to say that the Vive is superior to the Rift. They are actually equal in almost every specification.  But there are 2 factors that they aren't equal in (from what we know so far).  The first is ergonomics. Now that might not sound important on paper, but I own a Rift DK2 and have worn it for hundreds of hours, and trust me ergonomics is the most important aspect to making VR mainstream.  The second is software and drivers. Oculus are the clear leader here, and where Valve are opting to not even use timewarp, Oculus are already using asynchronous positional+rotational timewarp with other techniques like queue ahead and late latching."
pcgaming,3d4reo,willxcore,2,Mon Jul 13 17:01:51 2015 UTC,i thought the vive had substantially different motion tracking and the screen res on the vive was higher?
pcgaming,3d4reo,23490865243879526487,2,Mon Jul 13 17:22:12 2015 UTC,"The tracking system is different yes, but not superior. They both achieve the same result through different methods.  There are advantages and disadvantages to both.  As for the screen resolution, the Rift and Vive both have exactly the same resolution.  Where did you get that misinformation from, out of interest?"

But it's not true at all. In fact, the Oculus system has higher precision (but they're both more precise than human perception, so it doesn't matter)."
pcgaming,3d4reo,G3ck0,3,Mon Jul 13 17:31:42 2015 UTC,"No. /r/pcgaming is a mixed bag for discussion, probably leaning towards the negative side imo.  Anyway, you may be referring to the hardware specs side of VR. Meanwhile a lot of us oppose Rift because of how they're going to be selling and marketing it. They're initial business practices seem to be anti-consumer.   e.g.    They are developing Rift exclusive titles, dividing the VR market right away.  They are bundling the Rift with an XboxONE controller, which we may not want or need. (Actually I don't know if there's a no controller option)   There's also some people that say VIVE does better with motion sickness. Things you can't get off of a spec sheet.  Maybe thats what destructor_rph was referring to, but he originally made a vague, low quality comment."
pcgaming,3d4reo,TittyMcFagerson,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:22:28 2015 UTC,"Great, but I'm not Oculus or Facebook. No need to downvote me to -6 for disagreeing on the hardware.   They are developing Rift exclusive titles   100% funded by them. That's reasonable, no?   They are bundling the Rift with an XboxONE controller, which we may not want or need   It is absolutely needed, and why is that a bad thing?  They are getting it at cost. Sell it on eBay and you'll be making a profit!  But you won't want to, because there are 30+ VR games that have been in development for the Rift for (on average) 2 years, and they all use Xbox One gamepads."
pcgaming,3d4reo,BraveDude8_1,4,Mon Jul 13 18:24:35 2015 UTC,"Reasonable for them to do? Sure. They are a business, and its reasonable for them to want to maximize their profits.  Anti-consumer? Also yes. And I am a consumer, so I will oppose this practice, and its reasonable for me to do so. XboxONE controller being thrown in as well? Because I already own muliple Xbox360 controllers, and if I had to choose, I'd take the Rift at a reduced price, rather than being required to buy something (even if I could just sell it on ebay.)"
pcgaming,3d4reo,packman86,-3,Mon Jul 13 18:28:11 2015 UTC,"But those games would not exist otherwise.  VR needs content to not be stuck in a chicken-and-the-egg situation, and so Oculus 100% funded 20+ games. Should they not have the right to be compensated for that, rather than their money going towards helping their competitor!?    So just sell it on eBay!  As I said, you'll make more money, because Oculus are selling it at cost, and on ebay you can sell for cost + markup.  But this depends on price. If the Rift is cheaper than the Vive, then what's the problem?"
pcgaming,3d4reo,Skeet_smear,0,Mon Jul 13 18:31:05 2015 UTC,"They are developing Rift exclusive titles, dividing the VR market right away.    Won't Vive be tethered to Steam though?

I'm more excited for the Vive because of the tracking system as well as it shipping with controllers. But in the end I'm going to pre-orders both the Vive and the Rift the second I can :-D
pcgaming,3d4reo,shadow_craft,0,Mon Jul 13 19:33:47 2015 UTC,because of the tracking system   But the Rift's tracking system has identical outcomes...

pcgaming,3cwpyq,Jatsala,98,Sat Jul 11 13:52:00 2015 UTC,"Piracy is copyright infringement which involves making an unauthorized copy of something while leaving the original intact for others. Theft removes the ability for others to use the original because you took it.  Most people consider copyright infringement to be a victimless crime because a pirated copy doesn't necessarily equate to a lost sale. Also, large publishers already make millions/billions even with piracy occurring (or in some cases, because of it occurring). It's only the small developers that get hurt by it."

pcgaming,3cwpyq,amanitus,17,Sat Jul 11 18:40:26 2015 UTC,I used to pirate a game to see if I found it worth buying. I had been burned too often by games that I thought would be good but either weren't getting any support from the devs or was just not good to begin with. And since Steam wasn't giving out refunds I felt it was my only way to be a smart consumer. However now that Steam allows refunds I don't have to do this anymore.
pcgaming,3cwpyq,Elethor,14,Sat Jul 11 20:57:51 2015 UTC,I think a ton of piracy came from the time between when demos stopped being available and when refunds started being available.
pcgaming,3cwpyq,BrainSlurper,4,Sat Jul 11 16:24:28 2015 UTC,Yeah now that refunds are available the only reason I would have to pirate is if I can't afford the game. In which case I would probably just wait for it go down in price or for a steam sale.
pcgaming,3cwpyq,Elethor,2,Sat Jul 11 22:14:12 2015 UTC,Most of the time it actually equates to a gained sale due to a lot of multiplayer games with single player that people pirate then to see if it would run or even to see if they would enjoy the game and then buy so they can support the developers or even so they can access things like multiplayer. I can remember a developer who actually put a pirated copy of their game of pirate bay but included the comment that they should buy it if they enjoy it. A lot of people who put cracked copies of games on pirate bay also include this message too.

I don't pirate shit ever now, and haven't for years. I buy so many fucking games. I sub to mmos every now and then on top of that, I buy AAA titles, I buy indie games.   I don't know if I'd be the gamer today if I didn't have some games as a young adult 15 - 20. I might have dropped the hobby, I definitely wouldn't be as avid as I am now.  I really doubt piracy = lost sales. It isn't going  to always drive sales, like mine eventually did, but I would be fucking stunned that if piracy somehow became impossible over night if the industry saw anything more than a 10% shot in the arm.

It's similar to when people pirate movies not available in their country or movies they would not have been able to afford regardless.

pcgaming,3cwpyq,cogdissnance,15,Sat Jul 11 14:57:05 2015 UTC,In some cases piracy can even land them more sales since the guy that couldn't afford it is now talking about the movie at work and word of mouth is arguably the best advertising.

There is a seriously high percentage of the torrenting community that does so just because it's free, not because of availability or if they could afford it."

We're all broke 20 somethings and really only pirate games if it's a new release and we don't have the money. We buy all sorts of games (mostly multiplayer) but we don't have enough money to buy each new game at release. There are exceptions like GTA V and TW3 but most of us saved to get those.

There are some out there that have their moral reasons as to why they pirate, some who can't afford the media, and some who legitimately want to try something before purchasing it.  I don't know if those 3 people outweight the one group that does it just because they want free shit. That's a pretty good fucking reason too. ""Hey, want a game that just came out? $60 or...free!!!!"" A lot of people are going to take free because it's free. I used to pirate games a lot but I stopped once the Steam sales got better and I started playing games for longer periods of time. I don't pirate games now not because I can afford them or because I think it's wrong, I just don't want to. I know plenty of people who pirate games, music, and movies that can 100% afford them.

Just like you can't say every instance of piracy is a lost sale.   There are most definitely people who would buy something but don't because they can pirate it for free. People who would buy it if piracy was not an option.   For a recent example, Witcher 3 came out DRM free. There is no way that out of all the people who pirated it, none of them would have bought it if piracy wasn't an option.   And you could say ""Well piracy IS an option so hypothetical scenarios where piracy doesn't exist don't matter"" but it does because the argument is that piracy does cause lost sales."

To follow your example, let's say some of those people who pirated the Witcher 3 liked it so much they told their friends about it, and even swayed their friends to buy it themselves. A purchase (or maybe even more) that would not have been made otherwise. Thus, in that particular case, piracy would not only have contributed to no loss in sales, but to extra sales.  Of course, it's difficult if not impossible to actually measure how often this scenario is the case, but it's just as impossible as claiming that ""Piracy leads to lost sales"". The reality is that piracy has the ability to both make and lose content creators money. Saying piracy leads to lost sales as an absolute is not true either."

Maybe if you can't afford a bike you build your own, or alternatively YOU DON'T OWN A BIKE, but copying another person's paid for bike that was made by a team of hundreds over several years at the cost of several million dollars is closer to stealing than the old ""no one lost anything because I copied it"" argument.  Why the fuck does everyone feel that they should be entitled to whatever they want, whenever they want, without regarding small things like whether or not they can fucking afford it. You know if you can't afford something you typically don't have it right? Well what entitles you to steal it just because you can't afford it? I mean jesus christ, fine, blame the government or the employers or whatever but this ENTIRE plethora of arguments to justify piracy is literally arguing for the right to continue placating yourself against the situation you're in by consuming media instead of thinking - well shit, I can't afford that, what can I do about it? Do I want it enough to save up for it? Or get a job? Or go learn some skills so I'm more employable? No, instead people just fucking steal stuff instead and twist away whatever lie gets that round peg through that square hole in their brains so they feel OK about it."

But in THIS instance, you copied a bike instead of buying it from the manufacturer, denying them the sale.   And if I  bought a bike from another manufacturer I would be denying them a sale as well, should I feel guilty about that?  No.  Ironically just as much as some consumers feel entitled to things they didn't earn, coorporations use this same reasoning to justify that piracy is a lost sale."

It's a deeply political standpoint that is driven by the large ""content-owners""."

pcgaming,3cwpyq,KoboldCommando,6,Sat Jul 11 16:25:46 2015 UTC,"Its not stealing. If i steal something you no longer have the object in your possession.  Pirating software is just downloading a copy. The original still exists in the possession of the original owner.  So its not stealing, its copyright infringement. If a friend lets me borrow a game I got to experience it but did not pay for it, should that be the equivalent of theft as well? No. Pirating software should not be called theft, it should be called what it is: Illegally making a copy.  I have pirated games I never would have paid for so that would not have counted as a lost sale. I am not saying that is the case across the board but numbers of pirated copies does not exactly equate to lost sales like they want you to believe."

One of the earliest iterations of this was with Splinter Cell: Conviction, where the pirated version ran at 60 FPS with zero troubles while the official version hung around 30 or less most of the time. I found out about this after reading around on it and finding out that people with cracked versions of the game reported no problems with performance."

Double Agent was hot garbage but it at least tried to add new things that weren't in Chaos Theory, Conviction like so many franchise revivals was completely focused on cutting features to try and appeal to a wider audience.  And yeah, the VA thing was nonsensical.  Fisher was a great character even if his story got kind of unpleasant, unfun and stupid during and after Double Agent and a big part of the reason why he was so great was Ironside's fantastic performance."

pcgaming,3cwpyq,GnarlyNerd,2,Sun Jul 12 01:11:56 2015 UTC,"The thing that kills me about Conviction is that if you go back to the first three games you have a perfect model of streamlining gameplay without cutting features or sacrificing depth.  The games got easier to control with each entry but they also got harder AI, more gadgets, choices in loadouts, scoring systems to encourage better play, Pandora Tomorrow and Chaos Theory are perfect examples of everything a sequel should be.  Then Double Agent was a disaster and they decided that instead of building on an excellent foundation, it would be better to rebuild from the ground up into something much less interesting.    Incidentally, I might as well let you know, since it doesn't seem to have spread around much, a fan patch recently came out for Pandora Tomorrow which makes it playable on PC again, shadows now render properly on modern GPUs.  The game holds up well though getting it to run at a 16:9 resolution is a pain."

pcgaming,3cwpyq,baalroo,77,Sat Jul 11 22:41:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think it suggests that at all. Ubisoft is a large corporate entity, they don't operate the same way a small ""AA"" company might.  Any company can invest more money into their product in order to possibly generate more sales, so why doesn't every company constantly increase the quality of their product? Because they spend a lot of money analyzing their sales data to get the best return on the lowest investment possible.  The fact that they can get 23% of their sales from PC with their current level of investment on low effort ports is probably seen as a great return on investment. Why bother spending more when the products they're releasing are selling well?"

It's not a simple ""spend $X get $X+Y more in return."" They allocate funds very carefully to maximize the profit, while spending as little as possible on the front end. It's unlikely that gambling on that increase in upfront costs to give a ""moderate amount of love"" to PC, when it's already so profitable by spending so little, would be seen as an expenditure worth investing in. What percentage of budget increase would be necessary to make a noticeable difference to the average consumer as to make up for the increased cost? I imagine the amount would not be insignificant. As far as Ubisoft is concerned, why bother taking the risk when their current strategy is working wonderfully?"
pcgaming,3cwpyq,MyNameIsntGerald,2,Sat Jul 11 16:57:31 2015 UTC,"Well if they're sitting on cash or not necessarily reinvesting everything they have they either make more money which is good for them and the consumer, or they learn how much money is too much on the pc market and then can maximize profits as best they can."

They marketed the game as something it wasn't, the PC version wasn't exactly up to scratch, and they still got the sales. But they lost a lot of goodwill. They need to take a page from Rockstar's book:  Delay the PC version until it works if you have to. Don't show videos of something the game isn't. Don't advertise your game as the second coming of Jesus H Gaben, like it's the last video game anyone will ever need to play. If Watch_Dogs never had a misrepresentative E3 trailer, had the PC performance it currently has (and had the GOD FUCKING DAMNED MOUSE ACCELERATION REMOVED WHICH IS STILL IN THE GAME GOD FUCKING DAMN IT... cough ... sorry), and was sold as the stealth/spy/gadget/B-movie-style game that lampoons what twelvies think ""hacking"" is, that it really is, instead of the super-serious cyberpunk theme (imagine me making a jerking-off motion with my hand right now) they tried to go with, the PC community would have seen the game a lot more positively."

There is a key difference between game developers that also publishes games and a publisher that also develops games. The first is passionate about games, has experience developing games, and thrives to innovate in all aspects of game design. The latter has zero passion for games, has no experience in game design, and doesn't give two flying fucks about creativity.   Yves Guillemot is a business graduate and only cares about statistics and projected game sales. This is the problem with publishers like Ubisoft. They're filled with suits gauging trends and popularity of games, and they don't understand what drives gamers to buy their games. Gamers buy games that are fun, creative, and most importantly, DRM-Free. When your game isn't a fucking piece of shit, we wouldn't pirate it. When you treat every one of us like criminals trying to implement DRM using shit like Uplay, we'll pirate it just because the legitimate version is tedious.

I tried messing with a few settings, like nerfing shadow res, turning off msaa, etc, but still could not get perfectly above 60fps. My guess is, the demo was never intended to run at 60, is one of those rare cases where say 30fps costs you 3.5tflops, so 60fps will cost you 8tflops or something, not sure how to explain it.  Linus demonstrated it with watch_dogs but was not that bad, the game needed 55% more juice/power to run from 30fps to 60fps on a GTX480.  Witcher 3 in my testing also exhibits something similar, if I lock my fps to 30, I can have insane grass draw distances like 5.0 with 10k grass density, but to get to 60 I have to stay below 2.0, 6k density."

pcgaming,3cyinf,58592825866,3,Sun Jul 12 01:23:30 2015 UTC,"I recommend using OBS to record lossless H.264 (crf0 = lossless mode) then transcoding to crf18 later with handbrake or ffmpeg if you're game. crf18 is basically transparent so it should look as good as the original lossless video.  Recording lossless will be much less CPU intensive. You also want to use the ""ultrafast"" CPU preset. This'll result in humongous files (think 2GB for a minute of footage) but will put minimum strain on your CPU."

pcgaming,3cwnvw,Bosco_Sauce,2,Sat Jul 11 18:02:02 2015 UTC,Metal Gear Scanlon is almost better than actually playing the games.

pcgaming,3cwnvw,Bosco_Sauce,2,Sun Jul 12 03:24:18 2015 UTC,Is Scanlon 3 good? I got so infuriated with 2; I was screaming at my monitor that he should shoot the radios to stop re-enforcements turning up but he never learned that mechanic.
pcgaming,3cwnvw,Devilb0y,2,Mon Jul 13 07:03:48 2015 UTC,"There are moments where the game really seems to click with Drew in number 3 (The End boss fight). However, there are still a lot of frustrating moments, to the point where you think maybe Drew doesn't want to be doing this (which is also probably partly true...and it's hard to blame him). So you'll probably find yourself getting frustrated if Scanlon 2 had that impact on you.   Overall I think all three are some of the best GB video content out there, and as someone who never had a ps3 and so never played MGS4, I'm looking forward to Scanlon 4 (and this might be the one Drew really loves, seeing as I hear it is sort of different from the others)."
pcgaming,3cwnvw,Bosco_Sauce,8,Mon Jul 13 17:36:23 2015 UTC,"I am not too worried about bugs in MGSV, for as long as I can remember, the MGS series has been about as bug-free as games get.  What worries me is.. Metal Gear Online. Who is going to run it, support it, update it.. etc etc.? Lets not forget how quickly the MGO servers shut down after MGS4. A few years of support for an online game, in my opinion, is severely disrespectful to it's fans."
pcgaming,3cwnvw,Rendmorthwyl,6,Sat Jul 11 18:19:14 2015 UTC,Maintaining MGO will also be very low on Konami's priority list. They're only interested in throwing out mobile games until they hit a low-effort cash cow now.

They continually put out cars that have lower and lower quality, for 2016 they do not have a single ""performance oriented"" car in their lineup. They are not competitive in any way, be it performance, economy, convenience options, or even.. and this is the worst offense.. price.  They neglected to build and sell cars that made people want to come to Mitsubishi, they followed market trends instead of making them, and they are dying for it.  Just like Konami has begun to neglect making and selling games that bring people to their brand, and instead has started to follow market trends in order to start chasing money.. instead of making its own market trend, like it used to in the past.. i.e. METAL GEAR SOLID"

pcgaming,3cwnvw,Moddingspreee,2,Sat Jul 11 20:18:43 2015 UTC,Does Konami own the Metal Gear IP or has Kojima just used Konami since the beginning because they were the only producer that would take them? If Kojima owns the Metal Gear IP wouldn't you think that he would try to continue making new entries in the franchise? I'm genuinely curious about this because I could never get a straight answer.

They keep, or in Kojima's case kept, doing the same shit, ignoring trends in the U.S and thumbing their nose.   Now Americans have been the leaders in game design and have showing how much gameplay matters over graphics and how to actually turn a profit, making AAA money on C game budgets.  Shareholders at Konami have taken notice and are now concerned with expanding more in the pachinko market now that gambling is legal, or looking to be soon, in Japan.

pcgaming,3cxayk,Bo_Dallas,3,Sat Jul 11 21:05:02 2015 UTC,Punkbuster stopped supporting CoD4 but there have been community PB patches so you will need to get the latest PB files. You might also need an updated server list as sometimes fresh installs (in my experience off a disk instead of through steam) wont even show all the updated servers.

The moment you get an air strike on that map you're guaranteed to kill at least 75% of the players in the server.  Oh the glorious, glorious carnage.  If only we could get a CoD game nowadays that had proper modding tools and listed dedicated servers, like COD1,2,4 and WaW.It would actually make me consider buying a new CoD game maybe."
pcgaming,3cxayk,NightmareP69,3,Sat Jul 11 21:06:35 2015 UTC,"Good ol' Shipment, just need to remember to use Martyrdom perk and the one that gives you 2 grenades, spawn in, throw grenades then instantly die to someone else's grenades and die and hope you killed someone with your martyrdom perk or the grenades you threw, and then use air strike/ heli if you got enough kills, which you probably did."
pcgaming,3cxayk,AinEstonia,2,Sat Jul 11 21:42:56 2015 UTC,How the fuck is this upvoted? All the maps were designed for 6v6 or 8v8 at max. Sure shipment might be fun but other than that it's a shit show.   50 player cod4 servers are the dumbest thing I've heard of all week.

pcgaming,3cxayk,ttedder,3,Sun Jul 12 00:26:34 2015 UTC,"I had trouble getting it working properly because PunkBuster no longer officially supports it. Up until then, I still found COD4 lacking. It was a fun game, but the community didn't know how to properly run servers. There were always these restrictions on what you could use and which playstyles were acceptable. The worst part is that it's just about impossible to find an active server that isn't some 20vs20 clusterfuck. So yeah, if you can get around the PunkBuster issue that I could never figure out, you'll find active servers, just no servers where you can play the game as it was meant to be played."
pcgaming,3cxayk,Nathan173AB,5,Sat Jul 11 21:00:31 2015 UTC,"Plenty of games to be had since it has a server browser. Almost no vanilla servers though. So most servers have certain rulesets that you may or may not like, or they have like 16v16 on maps that clearly weren't designed for it. Overall, it's worth a purchase if you get it sub $20. Worth much more if you end up liking some of the server rulesets."
pcgaming,3cxayk,Descatusat,2,Sat Jul 11 19:17:43 2015 UTC,Can your explain more what you mean by rulesets?
pcgaming,3cxayk,drumsripdrummer,2,Sat Jul 11 16:35:02 2015 UTC,"Sets of rules created by the server admins. You can usually type /rules into chat and it will display the rules. Many servers have rules like:   Must be crouching at all times unless running from fire. Must be crouched if shooting. No grenades No RPG   These are just examples. It's kind of hard to find vanilla servers (servers that use only the rules that the game has, so no special rules), but they do exist. If you violate rules you're usually given a warning or two, but banned from the server if you continue to break rules."
pcgaming,3cxayk,Descatusat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:05:56 2015 UTC,Crouching at all times--that sounds so stupid. How do you even look out windows? Can you imagine if everyone in Counter-Strike was forced to crouch walk against their will?

pcgaming,3cxayk,Descatusat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:51:46 2015 UTC,"Yep. I play it whenever I'm bored and mostly stick to =AG= servers. However, if you play early in the AM with less people, you will find hackers since there are no admins on. During the day, however, there are active admins with less hackers. Overall, I have no problems playing. Don't bother installing punkbuster though, it's useless since it ended and you can just bypass the install by clicking no when it pops up. I love COD4, have put many hours into the 360 version and still love it on PC. If you can get it for $10 or less, go for it!"

You need to be very aware of your surroundings and how they all connect. Some of the solutions are quite esoteric. Additionally, they hide things all over the place.   As for the satisfaction, I don't want to ruin anything, but after solving one particular puzzle in the Egyptian desert and just hovering in the air, looking around at the entire landscape from a birds eye view, was akin to an intellectual Dark Souls orgasm."

There are extra hard optional puzzles throughout that really give it to you.  It's less action-y than Portal though.  In Portal, especially Portal 2, there was a linear progression.  In Talos, the puzzles branch off of hubs that you can revisit.  I haven't beaten the game yet though, so I don't know if it changes at some point like how it did in Portal 1."
pcgaming,3cu92k,xtagtv,3,Sat Jul 11 14:24:36 2015 UTC,"I love the game and I think its easily a better puzzle game than portal 2 but to your question:   Does it match the original feeling of achievement once you've completed a puzzle?   The answer is a definite NO. This game goes out of its way not to congratulate you for progressing through it. This is reflected in the mechanics and in the storytelling. If you are looking for a game to make you feel smart, like Portal excels at doing, this is not the same kind of game. Most of the time when I complete a puzzle in TTP I just feel annoyed because I didn't realize how to do it sooner. Going through Portal is empowering while going through TTP is draining. If you pay attention to the story you realize why the devs decided to make this strange decision. Its a very existential style of game and a big part of the plot is just figuring out why you are even solving the puzzles. The ""narrator"" gives you some motivation but its supposed to all feel hollow, for reasons explained later in the game.  There are some super hard ""star"" puzzles that you can't help but feel satisfied for because they are so hard. Roughly about 1/10th of the puzzles are for stars. The rank and file puzzles though, no."
pcgaming,3cu92k,bloodstainer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:13:20 2015 UTC,"Is it pretentious or actually intelligent though? Is it one of those smart games that really thinks its the most artsy and fancy thing out there or does it just simply... entertain. Because that's what I enjoyed portal for, the puzzles weren't really hard per say, it was just a matter of figuring out 1 + 2 and in most cases divide it by 2 again. But they managed to reward player with story bits and entertaining that kept it going."
pcgaming,3cu92k,shipstar,2,Sun Jul 12 20:15:31 2015 UTC,"It's actually pretty intelligent, just takes itself much more seriously than Portal. The writing is phenomenal throughout. I started looking forward to Talos after completing The Swapper, which was written by one of the same guys.  Overall, not quite as satisfying as Portal, but easily one of the best games I played last year."

pcgaming,3cu92k,platoandfriends,55,Sat Jul 11 11:57:09 2015 UTC,"THE GAME IS AMAZING  Seriously. Though, it's pretty seriously philosophical, so if you don't like pontificating during a videogame, it may not be for you.  Very similar to Portal 2 in that it's a sprawling puzzle game, but different enough where you won't be bored. And the game doesn't overstay its welcome or overuse any of its puzzle mechanics. I thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay, but the world it was in and the questions it asked of me were... amazing.  ""Why is it so important to you to prove that you're human?"""
pcgaming,3cu92k,Girthquake42,11,Sat Jul 11 07:07:04 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'm sold. Just going to wait for payday and jump on it.   A friend explained the allegory of the cave to me in eight grade and since then philosophy has intrigued  me."
pcgaming,3cu92k,ezone2kil,3,Sat Jul 11 02:39:20 2015 UTC,What's the allegory of the cave?
pcgaming,3cu92k,Girthquake42,24,Sat Jul 11 01:45:16 2015 UTC,"In short (a little sanitised for reddit):  There's a cave. People are sat in it, chained to a wall, facing away from the entrance. Other people are outside in the sunshine, doing stuff. Those people cast shadows on the wall opposite the prisoners inside the cave, like shadow puppets. The people chained to the wall believe that this is everything there is, and build their life around the shadows without realising there is anything outside. Occasionally someone in the cave frees themselves and goes outside. They are sometimes blinded by the light, and return to the cave, but other people are braver, and more suited to the outside world, so they become accustomed to the light and learn about the magnificence of the real world. Then, they decide to free their buddies, so they return for them. Their buddies are mostly reluctant, don't believe them, and don't want to leave their world of shadows, because it's everything they know and they're attached to it without realising how inferior it is, and how much better the world is.  Edit: the chained people are us. The outside stuff is the real world of the forms, the shadows are 'eidolons', otherwise known as Plato's 'particulars'. Again, in short, he's dividing between the world of materials that we live in, and the real world of Forms that we can recognise through philosophy. It's tough, and many people who make a step return to the world of the particulars because they find the Forms scary.  (In case anyone familiar is wondering, yes, I changed the allegory very slightly intentionally, with regard to the fire. I'm the original allegory, the eidolons, the shadows, are caused by people inside the cave who are carrying objects in front of a fire, which casts the shadows on the wall. I've found that most people find this aspect very confusing, and it doesn't substantially harm the analogy to have the shadows cast by the sun/people outside.  Oh, and here's the pcmasterrace visualisation, with added elements of the malevolent companies intentionally misguiding!"

The puzzles for the stars are incredibly difficult too. There were a few that I was on for over an hour to get one star. I did 100% the game and cannot wait for the new DLC to come out."

It's not Demon's Souls level of difficulty and the more ridiculously overwhelming the fights are the more fun they are."
pcgaming,3cu92k,Jabnin,5,Fri Jul 10 22:00:52 2015 UTC,"I've played all the Serious games from the first one and I'll tell you, Serious difficulty is VERY VERY difficult. Having been used to those I cleared Ziggurat on my 3rd try (went to final boss the first time, other time I died from traps) with only shit upgrades. If you don't know what I'm talking about it's a rogue-lite fps game, similar to serious sam but with mages, pretty fun."
pcgaming,3cu92k,erbazzone,2,Sat Jul 11 03:26:03 2015 UTC,"I love Ziggurat! :) Thanks for the mention. Anyone here who doesn't know it and likes the idea of a Heretic-style themed arcade FPS with procedurally generated Painkiller/Sam style encounters should check it out.  I died at least a half dozen times before my first clear on normal, twice on the final boss.   Those bosses are no joke, you learned them quickly."
pcgaming,3cu92k,aftli,2,Sat Jul 11 04:32:12 2015 UTC,Serious difficulty basically requires you to memorize all spawns of an area before entering it.  It might be possible by pressing quicksave every milisecond but not fun for a first playthrough. Hard is more than enough and some people might even prefer medium
pcgaming,3cu92k,erbazzone,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:25:49 2015 UTC,"Slight exaggeration -- don't get me wrong, it's tough, but I played through all of Serious Sam, Second Encounter, and BFE on Serious as a first playthrough. I'm not anything great, and I died and quickloaded on pretty much every ""arena""-style encounter, but not continuously, nor did I ever memorize spawns.   The obvious trick with the Sam games is that you theoretically can dodge all the enemy attacks (except for a couple of enemy types like the scorpions who have hitscan weapons, all the projectiles (like Kleer!) are relatively slow moving and of predictable patterns), so knowing how/where exactly to strafe or backpedal and jump gets you a lot of survivability. Of course, that only counts if you aren't in the middle of crossfire from multiple directions... but paying attention to defensive movement is generally more important than aiming in the Sam games.  Frustrating? Yes, but there's something priceless about realizing that you've just survived 15+ minutes of nonstop assault and overcame the odds."

pcgaming,3cu92k,TeutorixAleria,39,Fri Jul 10 23:11:07 2015 UTC,Well SSAA is disabled on Ultra for good reason. Trying to run that with everything else on Ultra as well will bring your system to its knees. So its best made optional for people who hate frame rates.
pcgaming,3cu92k,xWeez,15,Fri Jul 10 23:41:27 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of the good old Crysis, it has so many hidden settings to enable that made it look even better...but at the time nothing on earth could run it at max let alone with all the other stuff enabled."

pcgaming,3cu92k,Nihilore,5,Sat Jul 11 20:09:13 2015 UTC,"Well, he said it doesnt enable everything. Not that everything isn't maxed out.  I would imagine, as someone who is still relatively new to PC gaming, that there are some graphic options that are subjective, and look better to certain people whereas others may prefer that specific option be turned off.  Those are probably the settings that simply putting the graphics on Ultra won't mess with, leaving it up to the user"

pcgaming,3cu92k,kwahoo2,8,Sat Jul 11 01:43:56 2015 UTC,Years ago my friend Al introduced me to Serious Sam and we played it in his basement on his fathers various computers via LAN (his dad was a big nerd who owned a small local telecom company and had amazing comps).  I was introduced to the Utah Teapot through the tech demo among other things.  The game looked amazing.  When I brought it home to my relatively crappy home computer I could get SS playing to perfection for games over (by modern standards) astronomically slow ADSL.  It was one of the highlights of gaming for me. I am glad to see Croteam keeping up with their roots and making sure PC gamers get what they deserve.

The thing I mainly care about when I play a game is whether or not its fun, secondary I ask if anything in the game is a hindrance to that, like low framerate, FOV, etc etc.  Though something that I personally would love is for developers to insert more tool-tips or showcases on certain settings, sometimes new players get really confused about these sort of things and admittedly even I get confused by certain settings sometimes."

pcgaming,3cu92k,Bloodrot,5,Sat Jul 11 11:50:27 2015 UTC,And that's why graphic presets and programs like GeForce exist to automatically set things for you so you don't have to know what you're doing.

This isn't ""catering"" to PC, these aren't features that were added and given to us to use, it's just a lack of commitment to visual standards and leaving the engine open at a base level with no guidelines and saying ""do it yourself"". For example the three ambient occlusion settings could've easily be consolidated into a single setting without bothering anyones performance, visual experience, or freedom of choice. At no point is anyone going to require or want a superior quality AO also on the lowest precision available."
pcgaming,3cu92k,just_add_porn,4,Sat Jul 11 14:47:50 2015 UTC,"TTP does full hardware detection automatically (here is the main autodetection script) and an user does not have to bother about it at all. Also, there are presets (CPU, GPU, GPU MEM) Lowest-Ultra.  But sometimes a driver is buggy and changing a single very specific option (eg. one parallax mapping method to another) can remove video artifacts or increase the performance a lot.

pcgaming,3cw1oa,HaroldSax,42,Sat Jul 11 06:59:12 2015 UTC,God that walking/running animation is so bad.
pcgaming,3cw1oa,Masento,25,Sat Jul 11 08:47:49 2015 UTC,"That's the effect of having first-person and third-person animations be the same. Most games use two separate sets of animations, one the player sees from first-person, and a third-person perspective. Using separate animation sets allows for exploits like head-glitching and having what you see as the player not reflect what others might see. I don't think its bad, I think people are used to playing FPS games that tailor first-person animations that look pleasing to the eye but aren't representative of their avatar's actual actions."
pcgaming,3cw1oa,FrankFH,5,Sat Jul 11 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"This is simply a matter of unfinished animations. Just because 1st and 3rd are the same doesn't mean the animations have to be bad.  Look at games like M&B, Arma 3 and Interstellar Marines. All have full body awareness (no difference between perspectives) and they don't have weird animations."

The control you have over your body, and the lack of exploit in the game should be praised more. As an Arma player I find myself wishing all games had similar mechanics, but obviously were less buggy in terms of falling and stuff, though A3 improved in all these areas from A2 massively."
pcgaming,3cw1oa,HelIoMeow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:39:46 2015 UTC,"Head glitching is a bad example, because there are numerous ways to prevent that from happening.   Attaching the camera to what would be the 3rd person representation of the player in most other games, is a bad idea. It might look good, but it feels incredibly uncomfortable while actually playing the game. As you can see, everything jerks and shakes.    If you want to aim at something specific, you have to take arbitrary character animations into account. Like when you turn around, it will probably bob and shift the view. If the character has an idle animation, you'll have to keep that in mind if you're trying to hit something. It's like you're playing as someone with Parkinson's."
pcgaming,3cw1oa,InSOmnlaC,2,Sat Jul 11 22:34:17 2015 UTC,"Another example would be a player firing in the middle of their reload animation. On your screen they're still reloading, but on theirs they're done."

pcgaming,3cw1oa,InSOmnlaC,2,Sun Jul 12 05:13:47 2015 UTC,"Because when you use two different models for third person and 1st person, they need to be synced. Lag screws with the sync.

No. That doesn't mean I can't be concerned by what I'm seeing right now.   It's not even in alpha yet. That's like telling an artist a painting looks crappy when he's 1/3rd of the way through it.

FYI, the gun bobs around because in Star Citizen, the bullet shoots where the gun is aiming. Instead of having a crosshair that grows wider and bullets hitting random locations that are nowhere close to where the gun is aiming, Star Citizen takes a more realistic route where the gun shoots where you're aiming but it is harder to aim because every movement you make affects where your gun aims."

If the animations were designed around a certain FOV, drastically changing it could give a different perspective and mess it up. I'm just brainstormin here though, lol, don't quote me.

pcgaming,3cw1oa,Descatusat,5,Sat Jul 11 17:03:46 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go ahead an assume you read the post I replied to because if not you couldn't accurately gauge what I was talking about. Johnk419 said,    ""FIY, the gun bobs around because in Star Citizen, the bullet shoots where the gun is aiming.""   This means that guns in Star Citizen behave more like real life guns, in that the projectile leaves the barrel in a straight line no matter what.   If you play shooters you are aware of bullet spread. In many games you can aim your weapon at a small surface and fire the weapon one shot at a time and the bullets will not hit the same place each time. This is because games are made with a fictitious form of spread that we call bullet spread. Don't confuse this with recoil because recoil is a real life thing obviously and it affects aim.  Why bullet spread was implemented, I do not know. It could have been to mimic breathing or heartbeat or any other form of movement that affects our aim in real life, or it could be that they are simply trying to lessen accuracy of weapons because if every weapon hit exactly where you were aiming every time, people would be much more accurate.  You can test this yourself. Any CoD is a great example. Grab a sniper rifle in CoD and hipfire it directly at a wall 10 feet in front of you. It will appear that the barrel of the weapon has the circumference of a basketball because the bullets will not hit where you are aiming. They can fly out straight like a real bullet or they can fly out at a 40 degree angle so that it makes it harder to run around no scoping people.  Based on what johnk419 said, Star Citizen is making it so that bullets come directly out of the barrel the same way every shot. The way they are making up for the bullet spread feature is by implementing some heavy weapon bob and making it harder to steady your weapon since the bullet will fly directly into what you aim at. Realistic physics basically. Like I said though, this weapon bob is hard on the eyes."
pcgaming,3cw1oa,FrankFH,-3,Sat Jul 11 17:32:25 2015 UTC,"I'm completely aware of how it works in other games and in SC, no need to explain. I assumed that, by weapon bob, you meant the one you see when you are jogging, not the recoil when you shoot."

The closest thing to nVidia tech is TressFX which is only partly AMD because it was developed in collaboration with Crystal Dynamics IIRC.  So that is the analogue to nVidia Hairworks but otherwise the closest thing to physx would be havok which is non-proprietary and is missing some more advanced features of physx like liquid simulation for example.  Also all games that have physx effects never require the effects to be turned on thus as long as you don't turn them on it won't have an impact (which I don't even think you can on non nVidia cards, gameworks things do work but physx is still separate of gameworks I think).  The physx, physics simulation without all those fancy techs like soft bodies and liquid simulation HAS been used as the physics model in a lot of games but it has no performance impact because it's merely running on the cpu it's pretty much the same as using Havok for the most part.  Chances are if you play a lot of pc games you've probably played a lot of games using physx cpu, and never noticed a thing."

Linux versus Windows is not which one is ""better"", but which one accomplishes which tasks the best.  Linux's desktop UI selection is quite diverse and customizable, but I have never found any of them to be as polished or user friendly as anything on Windows (no, I'm not looking for suggestions on which flavor of the month derivative of Ubuntu to try next; spare me).  I wouldn't want to run a core DNS server on Windows because that is an expensive license to pay, but the full Active Directory stack is very powerful.  (You could make the argument for a true Unix box to run a DNS server.  If I was running something that I wanted to be HA, like a core DNS box, I would want something with a support contract plus decades of known use and I think you can still get those for Unix pretty easily.)  And the devtools thing is highly subjective as well -- I have to say that Visual Studio is fantastic for writing C++.  IntelliJ runs everywhere though, but that's a function of being mostly a Java tool.  Edit: And on further reflection, I'd say that the APIs in Windows are wildly better than in Linux.  Sometimes, in Windows, you get some really funky crap left over from 16-bit Windows, but hey -- that's how they maintain such incredible backwards compatibility.  Linux doesn't do that.    They're smart for making their codebase platform agnostic.  It usually means they've organized their code in a rational way."
pcgaming,3cxql1,ForgedIronMadeIt,4,Sat Jul 11 20:02:15 2015 UTC,"He did mention that he felt UI design always fell short even on distros like Ubuntu. It's a sentiment I don't agree with personally. I've seen the most technologically illiterate people get along with using something like Ubuntu just fine. The people that seem to have the most trouble with Linux distros are those who want to do tasks that are more advanced than what one's grandma might typically do, but which are not as advanced as tasks that a Linux expert would already know about—things PC gamers would do.  Installing drivers and software, for instance, is done a particular way on Windows and a particular way on Linux, and most people have always only known how its done the former way. Things like package managers and repositories are often foreign concepts to the typical PC gamer. I think that if more people understood it though, they would like it more.  In regards to him saying Linux is superior, I think he was talking about more under-the-hood stuff. Even the heaviest Linux distros like Kubuntu run lighter and faster than Windows. They all also have an edge over Windows with file system management, security, the package management feature, and probably other things I can't think of off hand. Overall, if one lists the ways in which Linux is better and in which Windows is better, Linux would win by a long shot."

If you just look at taskman, it might look like it is using a bunch, but it preallocates and precaches a lot of stuff for faster access.  It happily throws that out when it needs to.  I'm sure Linux does the same thing, or at least, it should.  As for background processes, do you mean that there are too many?  A ps -ef on a stock Linux box (or at least a useful one) shows a ton of processes too.   Defragmenting software, for instance, isn't included in Linux distributions. It's because it's not needed.   Windows just does it in the background and nobody needs to explicitly run it anymore, though with SSDs, it isn't an issue.  EXT can still theoretically get fragmented at higher disk utilization amounts.  I see what you mean though, and it is a fair point.     Core system files are not as easily accessed without explicit admin permissions, and most of the software one might need would be in the official repositories which would have been checked for problems   Windows has had the same core file protections for years if not a decade or more (WinNT's file permissions go way back).  It also keeps a backup copy that it can restore from in recent versions.  A non-admin account can't mess with things in Program Files or Windows.  Never used apt.  Anything would be better than rpm at this point though.   I don't know why you're getting so defensive.   I wouldn't say I'm being defensive -- every time I see someone ragging on Windows, it is usually because they don't know what the fuck they're talking about.

No clue what the situation on Linux is though, so not saying either is better just starting a discussion in regards to VRAM."
pcgaming,3cxql1,vinigre,3,Sun Jul 12 01:33:43 2015 UTC,"Windows started using the GPU to render the desktop UI instead of CPU rendering starting in Vista.  It actually performs faster that way.  Previous versions of Windows probably didn't use as much of the GPU then -- however, that is a bad thing.  Resource underutilization just means your system will be slower.  Windows will of course give up its hold on those resources when an application needs it.  Same thing with the system RAM -- Windows preemptively loads things but will toss them out as needed.  Or another example -- the thread scheduler.  If a thread is blocked on IO, then the thread scheduler ought to swap in another thread to run or otherwise the CPU will sit idle and the other threads may starve for CPU time."
pcgaming,3cxql1,JohnnyC4ge,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:40:25 2015 UTC,"Same thing with the system RAM -- Windows preemptively loads things but will toss them out as needed.   Linux also does this. And I've noticed Linux does a better job at caching disk shit because I notice my applications launch faster on my Linux laptop than the same applications do on my Windows desktop with SSD.   Or another example -- the thread scheduler. If a thread is blocked on IO, then the thread scheduler ought to swap in another thread to run or otherwise the CPU will sit idle and the other threads may starve for CPU time.   Literally every operating system does this, it's one of the most basic jobs of an operating system aside from a filesystem and memory management."
pcgaming,3cxql1,Folsomdsf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:01:08 2015 UTC,"If you run a game borderless windowed Windows 7 doesn't release that VRAM since it doesn't switch to basic and turn Aero off (unless you explicitly make it do so).  In windows 8 you can't switch to basic and disabling Aero doesn't exist, so unless you disable the DWM or something that VRAM won't be released and it's significantly more VRAM that is used as compared to 7 which increases with resolution for obvious reasons.  Somewhat related, VSync is also forced on in 8 which is undesirable at times.  Could be that Windows just waits to release that VRAM if you get towards the upper limit of what the GPU has for capacity or something, haven't really done extensive testing or anything.  However, Vista did not render the desktop faster by using more VRAM.  Microsoft tested this in house and the difference between using basic with no aero vs. all the eye candy on was negligible in terms of performance yet enabling basic and turning aero off frees up VRAM.  So it can be concluded that some of the VRAM windows is using is not increasing performance at all, it's just using the resources to change the appearance of the OS to something that Microsoft deemed to be more appealing/marketable."
pcgaming,3cxql1,Etnos,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:41:29 2015 UTC,"RAM consumption in Windows is very complicated. If you just look at taskman, it might look like it is using a bunch, but it preallocates and precaches a lot of stuff for faster access. It happily throws that out when it needs to. I'm sure Linux does the same thing, or at least, it should. As for background processes, do you mean that there are too many? A ps -ef on a stock Linux box (or at least a useful one) shows a ton of processes too.   I'm just going by my experience and what I've observed. In my experience, I have a faster and more responsive machine under Xubuntu than I do Windows. When I used to be tight on RAM (6GB), games that consumed more RAM would work better on Linux than in Windows, like Cities: Skylines with mods. So, in that regard, Linux does make better use of RAM. Same thing with launching common applications. Again, I don't know all the under-the-hood workings. All I can say is that my common applications are more responsive in Xubuntu than in Windows.   Windows just does it in the background and nobody needs to explicitly run it anymore, though with SSDs, it isn't an issue. EXT can still theoretically get fragmented at higher disk utilization amounts. I see what you mean though, and it is a fair point.   Good for Windows that it does that, but still. Linux doesn't do that though because it doesn't need to.I will say that SSDs are getting cheap enough to render the fragmenting problem not as big an issue as it used to be. I'm still on a 128GB SSD I bought for $120 years ago though, so I still need to make heavy use of my HDD.   Windows has had the same core file protections for years if not a decade or more (WinNT's file permissions go way back). It also keeps a backup copy that it can restore from in recent versions. A non-admin account can't mess with things in Program Files or Windows.  Never used apt. Anything would be better than rpm at this point though.   When it comes to the two, I always heard that APT is more well-liked than RPM.   I wouldn't say I'm being defensive -- every time I see someone ragging on Windows, it is usually because they don't know what the fuck they're talking about. If I started talking shit about BSD, I would be in the wrong because I've never ever used BSD or studied it at length.   I don't know all things about OSs and kernels. I'm not a computer scientist and my understanding of how they work on a deep level is vague and abstract at best. I have however used Linux enough to understand how to work it for my needs really well. As such, I should have room to comment on Windows versus Linux abstractly and from a desktop-user-oriented perspective, which is all I've done so far. And in those regards, I still stand by what I say that the GNU+Linux system is superior to Windows."

pcgaming,3cx5u8,AC3R665,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:14:42 2015 UTC,"Fallout NV had better writing and character development, but altogether it seems most agree that Fallout 3 had a better story and was more interesting.

Obsidian has really good writing and character development but focuses on that so much (and really isn't a big studio either, especially with them relegated to Indies right now and not having the negotiating power to produce heavy games on their own) and Bethesda has A LOT of lore, an interesting premise, but poor writing and character development.  FASA doesn't exist anymore and Microsoft still owns the rights to MechWarrior proper I believe, I'm not sure if the MechWarrior Online originals actually bought the rights or bought a license for them.  As for FO1, FO2, and FO Brotherhood of Steel.

pcgaming,3cv7h3,found-a-universe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:11:26 2015 UTC,"For an alternative viewpoint, the game is easily the worst of the series. Arkham Knight is not a good Batman game. Immersion is destroyed by tedious and mandatory not-the-Batman sequences where you destroy billions of dollars of equipment within minutes. Every time you start to get into the swing of being-the-Batman immersion is again destroyed.  I also found the mandatory game over loading screens annoying (I'm playing on hard). In Arkham City every time you die a character talks about your death, just like in Arkham Knight. Except in Arkham City you can skip these sequences. For some reason they're mandatory in Arkham Knight. Near the end of the game there is a point where you are likely to die more than any other point in the game. At this point a video cutscene is introduced that cannot be skipped. If you try and skip it potentially fake ""LOADING..."" text is overlaid until the video is complete. And then the game adds in-game talk and an in-game countdown before you can try the section again [PSA: /r/ArkhamKnight doesn't appear to want these discussions. I was called an idiot, retarded and an arse before my submission was removed].  I have put a lot of hours into Arkham Knight but unfortunately I estimate about 10 or so hours so far were not enjoyable. And they are related to being not-the-Batman. It also appears Rocksteady have come up with a non-fun game mechanic where I must 100% the game before I can get the best ending. That's pretty much all I know and I don't want to say anything more for fear of spoilers, but I feel like Rocksteady is abusing my desire to see the series appropriately concluded.  As someone who adores Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, Arkham Knight is likely my biggest gaming disappointment of the decade so far. It is unbelievable how badly it misfires as a good Batman game. Clearly my great disappointment is fuelled by my absolute love for the first two games in series. If you don't have great expectations then you can't be greatly disappointed."

Hopefully Steam refunds changes the way developers and mostly publishers release crap software just presuming the consumer has no way to fight back.  I'm surprised we've even heard anything back from them given the amount of time since launch of the product.  The AC: Unity team by this point just gave up. We made it to 1.4 and then they bailed. Maybe in the future when the Titan 1080p gets released we can finally play AC Unity with all options maxed over 1080p and the horrendous frame dips.  Either way, step 1 is to stop preordering, step 2 is to keep angry mob mentality and step 3 is to start back at step 1. Broken crap-tastic games cannot stand to be pushed out the door."

Free season pass for all PC players, or no purchase.

EVGA on the other hand made me run around getting the original invoice from newegg, which had long since disappeared in an account I no longer had access to despite me registering the card under my username and current address and still required for me to talk to one of their experts on their forums.  Fuck EVGA, never again. My taxes require less work."

pcgaming,3cua5i,Strelock,2,Sat Jul 11 03:22:52 2015 UTC,I RMA'd a gigabyte mobo I bought off of ebay broken and they replaced it with zero issues.
pcgaming,3cua5i,Echelon64,27,Sat Jul 11 21:51:14 2015 UTC,"I feel you mate, I went through a similar experience with XFX some years ago. It taught me a VERY important lesson. When you buy a video card from a taiwanese/chinese company (asus, powercolor, sapphire, xfx, whatever) do so through a shop that has an awesome customer policy like newegg or Amazon, if not, don't get lured by how attractive the price is, pass it on.   Whatever price you paid for that card, it wasn't worth the hell they put you through, advice is to go for some america graphic card companies as they won't shit all over your consumer's rights.  Just to make an example of my experience with EVGA, my 780ti died, I sent the card in roughly 6 days later a 980 FTW shows up at my door. This card is defective, turns out on their forums there was a thread of several people having problem with that specific version of the card, basically while playing the card would black screen. I RMAed my RMA (prepaid shipping label from them) and after 6 days got another card, defective as well.  Worth to note that in this time, on the forum thread, not a community manager, not some evga PR person, but the fucking product manager who supervised the production stepped in, acknowledged the issue and said their engineers were on it. 2 weeks later, a fix was ready, but to apply it, they required you to send your card to them. They offered advanced RMAs and prepaid labels to everyone and now my card is on its third RMA.  That kind of customer service should be standard, I am not even mad I had to RMA my card 3 times, because on the other side I've found an understanding and willing to help company that didn't try to give me the run around, that didn't try to say ""you damaged the card"" EVER and has treated me like I was their only customer. I realize it might sound like an evga fanboy post, but they did so good on this issue, they should have their praises sung.  In the end, while as customers we do have our tools to ensure our rights are respected (BBB complaints to say one) most often those take time and in that time (5 months in your case) we are the ones getting screwed.   TL;DR: Don't buy video cards from asian manufacturers unless you do so through a shop with amazing customer support such as Amazon"
pcgaming,3cua5i,Neumayer23,7,Fri Jul 10 21:51:26 2015 UTC,"First of all, thank you for the well thought out comment.  I have definitely learned my lesson.  I am extremely jealous of your RMA experience.  I will look into EVGA for my next card for sure.  If anything, this whole ordeal has taught me to not just go off the benchmarks; you need to look into the company as well."
pcgaming,3cua5i,Neumayer23,2,Fri Jul 10 22:04:44 2015 UTC,"Indeed, that's the same lesson I took away from this too. You can make the best card in the world, a card that is 30% faster than the others but, if you don't back it up with an equally awesome customer support, hardly anyone is going to remember how great it was, but everyone will remember how shitty your customer service was.   When my HDMI port broke on a 7970, XFX took 4 months to get me a new card, 4 months. Benchmarks only tell a part of the story and customer service is as important if not more important than the features the card packs. The moment you entertain the thought of purchasing from a brand you never purchased from before, make sure the first thing you google is ""Company name customer service experience"" rather than the benchmarks for the card."

XFX refused to acknowledge that it may actually be their hardware at fault and wouldn't give any replacement or refund, even though I had purchase their most expensive flagship $1500 AMD gpu. I only got help because I purchased it through Amazon and explained to them the horrible customer experience I'd had, they were incredibly apologetic and gave me an immediate replacement.   Lesson learned, always buy your pc parts from amazon (not from a seller thru amazon but from amazon themselves), even if a company doesn't want to respect a hardware warranty amazon has amazing customer service and will probably help you out."

My then 2 month old Asus 580i SLI that cost me around $250 took a shit. I contacted Asus and they told me to go through Newegg instead. Went through them and they didn't have any instock, so they gave me $250 towards the purchase of a new motherboard.

pcgaming,3cua5i,homercles337,3,Fri Jul 10 21:33:13 2015 UTC,"Most consumer electronics work outside of the box, and you're extremely unlikely to require a replacement until you voluntarily buy a new one. The reason you can buy so many after market warranties on products is that companies have discovered it's typically a good deal. However, in the rare cases where you might need to return a product, it can quickly turn into a nightmare. I've been lucky that the few cases where I've had a broken product the companies have been relatively prompt. My best experience was without question Apple, who replaced my old monochrome iPod with a brand new iPod video after they had sent me three different replacements.  I'd say when you buy from a company like Powercolor, you're making a calculated risk. You're taking a lower price in the hope that your card - just like most on the market - will work fine and never give you problems. I've had a Powercolor 7870 Tahiti LE since November 2013, and I've never had a single problem with it. The only time I've even used the company website was to process my rebate. Does that mean I'd buy another one? If it was dirt cheap like my 7870, perhaps, but I'd vastly prefer an EVGA card based on their reputation as a company.  Thanks for the post. Definitely things to keep in mind."

So if your thing dies within that time frame, DO NOT deal with the manufacturer, deal with the retailer, as they are legally obligated to issue a replacement (no skin off their nose, they'll get recompense from the offending manufacturer anyway).

pcgaming,3csncu,ADSkillz,57,Tue Jul 14 16:38:26 2015 UTC,"Great to hear.  Hopefully everything does indeed pan out that way.  In retrospect, CPR's pre-launch comments on the amount of content in TW3 seems to have been pretty spot-on - at least, it was in my experience.  They said it would take about 200 hours to finish everything in the game; my playthrough on the hardest difficulty took me about 130 hours IIRC, and I'd say I probably got to about 75-80% of the side quests/Witcher contracts and maybe a third to a half of the little question marks.  If I wanted to go through and explore all the points of interest on each map I'd easily be putting 200+ hours into the game - I'm not going to do that though, since now that I'm done I'd rather just save the stuff I missed for a later playthrough.  Anyway, if there really is enough content in the expansions to rival TW2 they'll be a sure buy for me.  As far as I'm concerned, the Witcher 2 is still a long-ass game.  TW3 was simply gargantuan and in my opinion there won't be another RPG along to eclipse that experience for years.  I'm not sure what their expacs will be priced at but I for one will happily pay another $60 between the two of them at the very least.  It's obviously a dangerous mentality to get into but at least as far as TW3 specifically is concerned, I have absolute faith in CPR and I will throw money at them because I think they deserve it.  They're making an excellent demonstration of the fact that you can make a shit ton of money by making good games and pricing them fairly."
pcgaming,3csncu,partisparti,11,Fri Jul 10 13:51:49 2015 UTC,"TW2 takes about 30-40 hours per path to complete if you play in Dark (highest) difficulty, if you do EVERY single quest and if you farm money for the Dark armor sets. There are 2 paths, so it's roughly 60-80 hours of gameplay. Still, it's the shortest game of the franchise. The Witcher was even bigger. It has 3 paths, 2 romances (and I mean romances, not just ""have sex with girl and get achievement""), the controversial romance cards, 5 acts, 1 prologue and 1 epilogue and a lot of secondary quests/Witcher contracts.  I heartily recommend playing all the Witcher games. It's an amazing franchise and one of the best RPGs I've ever played."
pcgaming,3csncu,Anti-assholes_police,7,Fri Jul 10 15:35:12 2015 UTC,I played the first a few years ago but I don't think that it has aged particularly well.
pcgaming,3csncu,drhuge12,5,Fri Jul 10 18:05:05 2015 UTC,It wasn't so much not aging well as being terrible always. People thought the combat and controls we're bad even when it came out. Still a very good game overall though.
pcgaming,3csncu,Cats_and_Shit,4,Fri Jul 10 23:00:02 2015 UTC,I don't know if age has a ton to do with it. I think even when it was a new game it was pretty clunky and rough around the edges.

If the quality of the DLC quests they've released so far is indicative of what we can expect from the expacs (and I'm sure it is) then another 20-40 hours for $25.00 is downright absurd.  Or maybe I'm just so used to developers charging more than that for far less content that I've slowly come to accept it as the norm.  At any rate, I almost feel bad because it just seems like all this content must just be so much work for CPR.  I can't even begin to imagine how you go about building a game with the sheer scope of TW3.  I just want to keep giving them money because I feel like I still owe them more considering how incredible of an experience TW3 was for me."

pcgaming,3csncu,vervurax,10,Fri Jul 10 16:05:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing, I have yet to pull the trigger on the Witcher 3 as I have a huge back log of titles I'm working through right now.  I'm currently playing Dragon Age: Inquisition...which I am also blown away at the amount of 'stuff' to simply do.    I was wondering if you have ever put in time with Dragon Age Inquisition and if you could compare it to your experience with the Witcher 3?  I'm curious because I don't want to go from Dragon Age Inquisition (I'm currently about 30 hours in and I feel I haven't even scratched the surface) straight into another title like the Witcher 3 where I'll probably invest another 100+ hours."
pcgaming,3csncu,initial_GT,14,Fri Jul 10 14:23:55 2015 UTC,"Yep, if I were you I'd keep plugging away at Inquisition and maybe look into getting TW3 in a few weeks/months.  I played Inquisition as well and while it's been awhile since I finished it I want to say my playthrough wrapped up around 90 hours.  As for comparisons between the two games - I noticed a ton of parallels, most of them generally good things related to the open world mechanics of the games.  While I'm sure this isn't actually the case, playing TW3 felt very much to me like a somewhat grittier Inquisition, but with a lot of small improvements - almost like the devs at CPR took Inquisition as a jumping-off point and set out to 'perfect' that system to the best of their ability.  Basically, it sounds to me like you aren't in any huge rush to get to TW3 (otherwise I figure you'd have picked it up at launch like I did).  The Witcher games, more so than any other games I've played, benefit hugely from CPR's post-launch patches.  A new patch is coming very soon (at least I don't think it's live yet) that's going to address a TON of the game's biggest issues - and to put that in perspective, a lot of people consider the biggest issue with TW3 to be the lack of useful inventory management and a personal stash.  Plus, nearly all of the free weekly DLC has been released at this point, and it will all have been released by the time you get around to playing the game.    So, like I said, I would recommend you just keep enjoying Inquisition because it's an outstanding game as well and you'd do yourself a disservice if you dropped it now to go straight to the Witcher.  If I were you I'd probably also take a month or so hiatus to play some other games in between the two - but that's just because I personally don't think I'd really be able to enjoy two consecutive ~100+ hour playthroughs, especially considering that there are some similarities between the games.  At any rate, you can probably rest assured that when you do play the Witcher you'll essentially be playing the ideal version because CPR will have already implemented all of their major fixes and you'll have access to all the DLC right from the get-go; when I played it, some of the DLC armor packs were essentially trivialized for me as I'd already far exceeded the level requirement by the time it was released.  You won't have that issue, which is all the better.  At any rate, take your time with both of them and enjoy both games for what they are.  I definitely envy the shit out of you for still having your first playthrough ahead of you in both of them!"
pcgaming,3csncu,partisparti,5,Fri Jul 10 14:54:34 2015 UTC,"Awesome! this was exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you for your well thought out response and honesty!  The bug to start playing Witcher 3 is constantly on my mind when I sit down on my PC but you're right, I should just enjoy Inquisition for now, perhaps take a break with a shorter title in a different genre which should hopefully be enough time that i'll be ready for the Witcher 3 and benefit from the CDPR's post launch patches/content."
pcgaming,3csncu,initial_GT,4,Fri Jul 10 15:00:07 2015 UTC,"Happy to help.  And I know exactly what you mean, it's practically impossible for me to ignore all the hype when a new game is launched and is received exceptionally well.  Always have to remind myself that it's a game and it will literally be there forever (well, for my intents and purposes anyway).  If you're enjoying Inquisition there's absolutely no reason not to continue doing so, and your experience with the Witcher will only be better off for it."
pcgaming,3csncu,partisparti,3,Fri Jul 10 15:07:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you should definitely finish Inquisition before witcher, mostly because, after Witcher, ""the amounnt of things to do"" in Inquisition will feel like a pointless chore. Don't misunderstand me, I absolutely adored Inquisition and put on over 150 hours across several playthroughs. But after playing Witcher, tge idea of going back to collecting shards fills me with  dread.  So yeah, first Inquisition and then Witcher. That way you'll love and enjoy both games."
pcgaming,3csncu,permanentthrowaway,3,Fri Jul 10 19:26:13 2015 UTC,"On the upside, by the time you get to Witcher 3 it will have been patched a bunch of times and much more stable!"
pcgaming,3csncu,tehkensai,9,Fri Jul 10 19:04:45 2015 UTC,"I personally didn't like Dragon Age: Inquisition for the following reasons:   The writing doesn't feel very good in my opinion. The characters are huge stereotypes, many story tropes are shoe-horned, and as always in Bioware games the hero feels like a glorified interviewer/cameraman created for the sole purpose of learning more about the world.  In The Witcher 3, the narrative exposition is more natural. The characters don't feel like they are talking to the player. You feel like listening to a conversation and trying to figure out what is happening. As always in Bioware games, this glorified question-machine seems to be considered an admirable and charismatic leader/hero by everyone despite having the personality of a brick. Consequently I always want to play with all the characters except mine and I can't, which is frustrating.  In The Witcher 3, Geralt is interesting and charismatic. He's smart enough and cool enough to feel like a good main character, but he's also flawed. He's overly cynical and sarcastic, he can act like a dick sometimes, and he's terribly easily manipulated by women. The lore isn't always super engaging. Some stuff is really interesting, and other stuff is boring as fuck. The codex entries are also very uneven and rarely well written. I remember reading all Dark Souls' item description, all Witcher 2 books and journal entries, all Fallout 3/NV computer mails... but here I tried and tried and it was just too boring and I gave up on reading the secondary lore.  The lore of The Witcher simply is very interesting to me. I think it's because it comes from the books, but also because the Bestiary and Characters entries are written from a character's point of view, the poet Dandelion, in a very fun and entertaining manner. Also, Bioware still can't tell you a story of a complex world without relying on non-believable ""Wikipedia Characters"".   As said earlier, in The Witcher 3 you learn about the world and its politics by observing the world around you: ambiant dialogs, books, little scenes of daily life, small quests, etc. You don't feel like a character exists just to fill the playing in on the lore. As always with Bioware games, there is no real and serious rivalry among your team members. What should have been complete incompatibility between two characters turns into friendly teasing/banter. I don't mind humor in games but this really feels like a cheesy early-2000s TV Show sometimes.   In The Witcher 3, the characters you joke with are your friends, real friends. As for the others, there is no fake-rivalry just to make the audience laugh. If Geralt really despises someone, he's going to be sardonic and mean, not pleasantly teasing. There is a lot of content made to artificially increase the game's durability to the point of damaging the narration and being simply not fun. (Lots of useless collectibles and stupid quests (go hunt Rams) in a story where there are much more important things as stake). Seriously the game was long enough, we didn't need all this shit.   While there is a bit of filler content in TW3, it doesn't even compare to most RPGs. The amount of secondary quests that are extremely well written and engaging is simply insane. I don't think you're asked a single time to kill 10 wolves just for the sake of it. Even if you have to ""fetch"" something, it's always going to be introduced with a great narrative exposition. There's a strong pacing issue at the beginning of the game. If you don't want to be lost in terms of lore/story you need to talk to all the characters and read everything. As a result, you end up having 30 min of combat gameplay and 3-4 hours of dialogs before even entering the Hinterlands.   The Witcher has a good pacing overall, except maybe by the end of the game. However, the beginning of the game is masterfully done in that regard. The tutorial zone is simply, well, the best tutorial I've ever played because it never felt like one. And again, except by the end, there's a good balance between story & gameplay. Talking about the Hinterlands, this zone is an MMO shit-fest and very confusing in terms of sense of directions. Not that I want a linear game but it feels really unnatural to enter a huge zone, barely scratch its surface and then go in other places. And if you stay in the zone you're doing boring shit and overlevel. The game is beautiful and the zones look great but everything feels... uninspired. The desert looks like a generic desert, the forest looks like a generic forest, etc. Few zones blew me away in terms of atmosphere and art direction. It feels like a generic MMO in that regard.  While TW3 doesn't go for JRPG-like over the top and super imaginative environment, it is extremely immersive. Zones look like believable countrysides but are so well crafted and animated that you really feel like part of this world. Every single village doesn't feel like it was created in a Developper Toolkit (even if it was). You tell yourself ""yeah, people really could live there"". Some stuff is needlessly simplified (tactics/behavior) and some stuff is needlessly complex (weapon/armor customization & craft is just a stat-boost fest for the sake of being a time-sink)  TW3 gameplay isn't perfect. The combat is fun but the UI menus aren't good (it's going to be patch next week). There's a difficulty curve issue with the game becoming too easy after 1/3 of the game also, which is why I will look out for mods."
pcgaming,3csncu,n0ggy,5,Sat Jul 11 00:34:09 2015 UTC,I loved the first dragon age. I played it to death trying out every class. Da 2 was sad and under developed. DA3 feels like an Mmo only your alone. Witcher 3  sucks you into this amazing story and wonderful world. The quests are very engaging and the lore goes deep.

Though I don't know if I get to play this, I'll need to play through TW2, but it's a hard game to get into. I just find the fighting and menu mechanics very confusing, especially now that I've forgotten everything about the start. I powered through TW1, though, and it was probably even more confusing at the start.  If anyone had any good tutorials/tips for TW2, I'd gladly take them."

pcgaming,3csncu,aytrax,2,Fri Jul 10 20:49:53 2015 UTC,"I had trouble at the start too, was getting frustrated until I figured it out and started having a ton of fun!   Roll all the time. Use Quen to take no damage for a hit or two and hit them, then roll away. Try to make strikes at singled-out foes and break them up or run away until they thin out into a long conga line of dummies then hit the lonely conga leader with your sword.   Get the roll distance talents! This game should be called The Roller 2.   Bombs are OP, especially with the double damage boost talents (just 2 talent points at the very start of the tree!) and if you harvest everything you see you will have 25 plus of them when you need them. Just hit the button to throw it out when you are fighting and it will auto-lock on the guy you're aiming vaguely near and blow him up, don't bother with the aiming mechanic.  The trap spell Yrden is great against big guys - leaves them totally helpless for a free hit or two to their soft backs (it was nerfed to shit in Witcher 3 where it barely even slows them, doesn't even trap anymore).  Most fights are about figuring out when to roll away watch their animations - right after they are done attacking and recovering then you attack with a fast hit or two to the back. If you click attack Geralt will jump towards them so roll away but not back at them.   Non-boss shield guys, guys blocking all your attacks (Scoia'tel with two swords for instance) or bugs with armor on the front just need to be trapped or stunned (or distracted by a mind controlled buddy) with a sign then hit in the back or side. It is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to roll around a non-trapped/stunned shield guy to hit his back, just use a sign on him.  On archers you use Quen and run up to them to force them to melee (and they are weak at that).   Some weak swarming enemies like Nekkars and Drowners can be hit over and over with fast attack and basically stagger locked to death (if you do this keep Quen up in case) - don't do this when surrounded, go attack the guy slightly separated from the pack a few times like this then dodge away.   Strong attacks are usually a waste of time on non-bosses (and even for bosses the extra time you stand still might get you killed) but some people love the slight damage boost.  I hope this helps, it's a great (although rather brief) game!"

I love the game and am hooked on exploring the world and doing the quests mostly to see the little stories. However, the combat is a drag. Maybe I spent to much time with Dark Souls which spoiled me on timing based combat. I feel like the Witcher 3 is Dark Souls lite. Block a ton, use B to dodge, use a few signs, WIN! I have taken down a few enemies (20+) when I was around level 15 just by being willing to fight for 20 min. Wasn't overly hard just annoying. I have the difficulty turned down one below the hardest. I found the highest setting unfair with more then 2 enemies. Very easy to get pinned by the rigid movement system."

pcgaming,3cw2ab,Bannik254,8,Sat Jul 11 17:26:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly because the work of 6 people and a few art contractors counts as much as what 500 devs can do.  The problem here is that none of these numbers hold up to closer inspection. Your source eg. has no source itself. The source for the 7 years development of ESO is solely based on a gaming press article and the fact that ZeniMax Online Studios were founded in 2007. Nobody knows if they actually started working on ESO around that time.  The truth is that this is something inherently unmeasurable. There are just too many factors to account for. We can only guess from experience. And my experience tells me, that that little bit of prototype they cobbled together for their kickstarter presentation is negligible compared to the actual game.  If you really want to count it, then do. It won't make a difference though. You can also compare my 'Hello World' script from yesterday with Windows 10, if it makes you happier.  The game is where it is, and will take the time it takes.  Hopefully they won't run out of money in the meantime.  And hopefully once the FPS-part is out a lot of this angry fear mongering will subside until December when it undoubtedly will start all over again."

pcgaming,3cw2ab,Bannik254,2,Sat Jul 11 10:24:38 2015 UTC,"I agree that this roadmap was too optimistic and a huge mistake to make public.  However the ""excuse"" still holds up. Huge games take lots of time. And people grow impatient because they're used to being confronted with a game when it's at most two years from release.  And then it's delayed half a year and another quarter and then Witcher 3 comes out and everybody seems to be happy again. Because once something is out nobody cares if it was late as long as it is good.  Let's hope the FPS-Module will be good."
pcgaming,3cw2ab,Woolver,46,Sat Jul 11 11:32:22 2015 UTC,"What I often found bloody ironic about crowdfunding is how players love to complaint about publishers being bossy and controlling over developers, killing creativity, artistic vision and freedom (while funding the whole thing years in advance) and yet you see people putting 50 bucks in on a Kickstarter and suddenly demanding to dictate anything about development and getting angry about unmatched deadlines as if they were the company's majority shareholder."
pcgaming,3cw2ab,TucoBenedictoPacif,6,Sat Jul 11 11:42:48 2015 UTC,"The issue with publishers being ""bossy"" isn't that publishers exercising oversight is inherently bad, it's that major publishers use their leverage to require devs to make games with the broadest, safest mass-market appeal and consequently make crappy games.    The crowdfunding model needs to develop accountability mechanisms equivalent to what traditional publishers havce to make sure developers are creating quality product according to the initial proposal.    That's why I think the kickstarter model is ultimately bad for consumers:  they give money to a developer, but there's no oversight or accountability on how they spend that money.  A publisher is at least incentivized to monitor a team's progress and make sure they aren't just spending it all on hookers and blow, or deviating from the design docs too much.  So what quality-conscious gamers really ought to be doing is crowdfunding a black-label publisher who will act like a traditional publisher in terms of oversight and management, but with better ends.    The best analogy I can think of is that the best antitude to shitty large banks' anti-consumer practices isn't peer to peer lending, it's to create credit unions that perform the same functions as banks, but with customer service as the ultimate goal, not maximizing the profits of shareholders."

Although it's such a massive project it's a bit hard to grasp at times how they're able to coordinate between so many studios and people, working on completely different aspects of the game. On top of that they bring regular development reports, new info about the lore, the ships, etc. - hell, the only thing they don't tell you about is what they had for breakfast."

Seriously, why does it have to matter so much? There are thousands of excellent games you could be playing right now instead of worrying about if a game that's not out yet is going to be any good.

pcgaming,3cw2ab,karl_w_w,7,Sat Jul 11 06:56:23 2015 UTC,"All the Star Citizen discussions are getting tired. It's still early in development and hyping a game to death generally isn't a good thing as it often leads to disappointment. I'm not doubting that it has potential to be something big and great, but it'd be nice if all the SC stuff stayed in its own subreddit until we get to that point where we can say the game will be released ""soon"". Were definitely still very far from that."
pcgaming,3cw2ab,Won_Doe,9,Mon Jul 13 15:37:55 2015 UTC,"Not worried. They constantly post updates, very very detailed updates on progress.

pcgaming,3cw2ab,Daiwon,2,Sat Jul 11 08:11:40 2015 UTC,"They actually gave up on most of the legacy netcode. Everything they could fix they did, and everything they couldn't they rebuilt from scratch.

pcgaming,3cw2ab,memo_fine,27,Sat Jul 11 16:39:32 2015 UTC,"As a backer, a fan of Chris Roberts, and someone who has a pretty decent idea on how game development in general works, I am not concerned in the slightest about the progress of the game. The content they have created up to date is far and away some of the best work by any developer in a very long time. The attention to detail is incredible and makes me excited for the future.  The main reasons for the angst now, the delayed Star Marine module, are completely unreasonable. They are working on one of the most highly critical components of a MMO, all the back end infrastructure. How the game handles instancing, zoning, matchmaking, etc. Not sexy or glamorous by any stretch of the imagination, but extremely crucial nonetheless. And to be quite frank, the networking stack in CryEngine was always one of the weakest points of the engine. So CIG is basically designing and building these systems from scratch to replace the existing mediocre networking stack that exists in engine already.   That takes time unfortunately.  And that's a double edged sword for CIG. One of the great things about them is how they share work and discuss progress on various bits on a weekly and monthly basis. But because of that, people have expected to see something tangible. It's hard to show tangible results when it's all back end work that has taken up focus for the time being. People are getting torqued about it cause it looks like nothing is happening, but in reality it really is. And the double edge comes along. Traditionally, a game wouldn't be shown off until all this non-glamorous work had been completed. We backers are observing the process in real-time.   Look, I get the project is definitely something to have some skepticism over. It's a completely new and unheard of process of building a massive game. But to have fears of the whole thing being a 'money grab' or a scam are completely unfounded and illogical. There are ~300 people directly involved and another 100 or so on contract to make the game happen. It may not happen quickly, but it will happen. If you don't wish to back the game, hey that's cool, no worries about it. But I would only ask that one would take a little time and research the truth instead of buying into clickbait'y articles or extremely vocal critics that only have an axe to grind. The game will be made, we'll get there. And, IMO at least, it will be well worth the wait"
pcgaming,3cw2ab,DeniedExistence,7,Sat Jul 11 09:12:27 2015 UTC,"This game gets more unwarranted hate then any game I have ever seen. I bought the game for $20 last year, it came with the basic ship. I played for about 2 hours against ships controlled by bots, it was fun and I realized it was basically only a demo.   ""There will never be a monthly charge for use"". So for $20 I basically own the game and I never have to spend any more money on the game if I don't want to. That doesn't mean that I won't spend more money on it, its just nice to have the choice. Similar to League of Legends, the game is free but I have spent more money on it than any other game. All of the ships will be available through in game currency.   Also, the development process is completely transparent. They tell the community when they have to scrap a concept such as the FPS Module they had to replace a lot of the code because it wasn't up to their standards. The community was okay with this because they would rather wait for a better product than to have a sub-par FPS module.   I haven't played the game in about 7 months because I don't want to tease myself. I know the game won't be complete for almost 2 years but I do like keeping up with the development process.  So should you buy the game right now? It's currently $45 for the starter pack and you get the game and a ship. I do recommend a flight stick, which you can get for around $50. However, the game is playable with a controller and a mouse/keyboard. It is an incomplete game, you should ultimately know that you will have to wait a good amount of time for the full product. But if you like space games, MMOs, and are confident in the developers I don't see a reason you shouldn't buy the game at the reduced price it is currently at. Many people will argue that being early-access is reason enough not to buy it. However, if the game is all that it is hyped up to be you will be involved in the alpha process of the biggest MMO since WoW."
pcgaming,3cw2ab,Jacariah,4,Sat Jul 11 13:27:47 2015 UTC,"I love it. I think it's one of the better games of recent years. It's trying to push gaming to it's maximum given current technology standards so I don't expect it to be done any time soon.  Kickstarter is a great thing but it is also a curse because so many people don't understand what they're doing when they throw their money at a game to help found it. I pledged in the middle of 2013, so roughly two years ago. I have gotten more than my money worth out of the game with the possibility of getting much, much more. I paid $40. Less than a lot of ""AAA"" games on release, and if Star Citizen achieves half of what it's setting out to do, we'll be getting a game that is more impressive than any game we've seen in the past.  It may seem like it isn't going anywhere, but development takes time. I'm not personally going to start getting critical until holiday 2016. If they aren't getting near the optimization stage at that point, we should start to worry. It should be feature complete by then; as feature complete as an MMO can be that is."

pcgaming,3cw2ab,Flint_McBeefchest,2,Sat Jul 11 18:46:32 2015 UTC,"I backed it and at that time was excited about it. At one point in time I agreed with myself that I wouldn't bother reading about it any more because it will be a long time before I play it. Now the only info I want to read is the reviews on release day. I don't care when that is, I'll just be happy that I have a new game to play and I paid for it years ago."
pcgaming,3cw2ab,Scotch_Pie,2,Sat Jul 11 10:44:44 2015 UTC,"It's a massive game, even what they originally pitched, and I never expected them to be able to deliver on time. With all the added features that have been added to the plan, I fully expect it will take several more years for them to deliver. I am OK with this, I just want the game to be good. If this game were to fail, it would be a disaster for PC gaming, crowdfunding, and open development."

pcgaming,3cw2ab,destructor_rph,2,Sat Jul 11 15:05:20 2015 UTC,"I'm a patient man, I gave them some of my money because I believe the product that they are planning on releasing will be of high quality. I like what I've played so far, I like that they're open with their development, and I like that they give me regular updates on what they're doing and what they're making.  Their original dates that had late 2015 slated as the release of the alpha for the persistent world were pretty clearly shooting for best possible outcome and that didn't happen. Oh well. I'll move on. I have plenty of other games to play and this also gives me time to get better parts for my computer so that when it is released, I can enjoy it at the graphics that will give me the best experience.  A lot of it is hope, though. I hope it's going to be one of the best games I'll play. I hope that it will keep me engrossed for years to come. I hope that my investment gives me a good return, ie, I love the game. If it ends up being bad or dying or whatever, that sucks, but I believe in the vision the Roberts has for this game."

pcgaming,3cw2ab,CMDR_DrDeath,4,Mon Jul 13 19:42:02 2015 UTC,"Why so defensive? I'm simply pointing out a difference. You can't compare development of SC with other AAA games. They are different, because you report to different parties."

pcgaming,3cw2ab,CMDR_DrDeath,4,Sat Jul 11 08:12:00 2015 UTC,"Because you compared SC to those games, so I simply mentioned the most obvious difference."
pcgaming,3cw2ab,elusive_cat,0,Sat Jul 11 08:16:43 2015 UTC,"Ok, so you are saying that the source of the funding changes the way that a game is being developed ?"
pcgaming,3cw2ab,CMDR_DrDeath,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:25:01 2015 UTC,"Yes. If it's a closed project, developed internally, you've got different priorities than when you need to show a regular progress to the outside world. Internally, you can spend two years purely on experiments and trials of various ideas and possibilities (well, as long as your investor lets you). You don't have to show anything to anyone, you can just work quietly (as an example, although I agree probably not very good, two Assassin's Creed titles have been in development for over a year now and no one knows anything about them). However if there was no progress report from Chris Roberts for a year or two, I imagine people would get upset and demand to know what was going on. Because of this you need to alter your development process."
pcgaming,3cw2ab,elusive_cat,4,Sat Jul 11 08:28:19 2015 UTC,"You don't have to show anything to anyone,   This is 100% false."
pcgaming,3cw2ab,InSOmnlaC,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:30:22 2015 UTC,"Ok, but that doesn't really affect the overall development time, does it ? The research has to be done in either case. It is just that the public won't know about it in the case of a publisher derived game. Still overall development times are pretty well documented for many games, so it is easy to compare after the fact. That said, I'd imagine that crowd funded games are actually more difficult to develop because you cannot take advantage of many resources that a publisher can give you. (Like what EA is doing with Frostbite). So you'll have to develop many tools from scratch that a publisher could provide for you. So if anything development time is likely going to be longer for a crowd funded project. So bearing that in mind. Many of the games I listed before took longer than 5 years to develop, even though they were publisher supported. So we should expect at least the same amount of time, if not more for larger crowd funded projects."

To be honest, I think I am doing enough pro bono work for society. I don't consider this ""throwing away"" money. Many people have expensive hobbies. People spend lots of money on impractical cars, and other random collectibles. I elect to give the money to people trying to build something. Artists mainly. I have given various amounts of money to students building portfolios or requiring access to recording studios, etc. I don't mind giving money to people trying to do something creative with it. When I do this, I always consider the money a loss, but for me there is still value in doing so regardless. Every once in a while something good will come of it and that will be worth more than all the failed projects.  As for Star Citizen, it may fail, it may succeed. Who knows. It is too early to tell either way. I don't think I have seen enough evidence to suggest that it will fail, but even if it does the project is interesting enough to warrant my support.

A ship, which like all others(sans the Scythe) can be bought with in-game money through normal gameplay.   It is NOT DLC. It's part of the game from the beginning. That's like saying some level 5 sword in an RPG is DLC because you don't start the game with it."

I just want a good space sim where I can bounty hunt and do euro truck space simulator with simple change of my ships... It'll be like ARK and DayZ where you have 24 hours of gameplay and only an hour of it was absolutely epic where you defended yourself from group of pirates and I am okay with that. Then there's exploration which I want to invest into too, if it has some puzzles to solve in order to get the treasure? I'll be happy, if not, still got rest of the game to enjoy.  My only concern is the end game... If they don't keep on pumping out ships after the release, a lot of people will get their top of the line single/dual seat ships and might get boring with no progression...

I just wanted a truly MASSIVE, EPIC, large scale Space Sim with thousands of other players. That's it. Everything else is bells and whistles.

Now, it's going to be largely a single player experience with ""drop-in co-operative"" campaign, with an online option. And the online experience will be dictated by the player, the player controls how many other players he sees and plays with. For an online game, this is a disaster of a feature. Remember playing DayZ? Remember how people would log out while bleeding or log off when they ran into another player when they weren't ready? If your playing online, see an enemy ship, or you get attacked, you will have a built in option for bailing out with no repercussions.  We now know that the actual ""Persistent Universe"" won't be available upon release.(If ever, honestly.) Instead players will have to either host or join privately hosted servers which will be part of an ever expanding network, currently they have been developing matchmaking and instancing that will work across that network, but it's still in early development.

Now, it's going to be largely a single player experience with ""drop-in co-operative"" campaign, with an online option.

And the online experience will be dictated by the player, the player controls how many other players he sees and plays with. For an online game, this is a disaster of a feature.

pcgaming,3ct7w6,Skarsten,6,Fri Jul 10 20:58:15 2015 UTC,"except this solution is over complicated, like people want to pretend building your own computer is easy (and no it isn't for everybody, don't even start with that nonsense)   But now you want to purpose a forty step guide that requires knowledge of a command line, basic networking knowledge and a load of other stuff. Half of the stuff in this guide isn't fleshed out, ""get the latest drivers"" ok from where, what version, how do I install them. Including all of that info would probably make this four times as long.  For every supposed ""console killer"" I see proclaimed they all fall apart the second they're required to interact with the tech-illiterate.  Steam machines can't even natively play netflix, or spotify, or hulu, the best it has is that awful browser.  Home-streaming still requires you to have a powerful gaming rig and the know how to connect it to a screen somewhere else.  This amazon cloud gaming requires some pretty technically know-how and requires a substantial network connection and suffers from network delay.   Building your own PC means figuring out all the parts, ordering them and putting them together, and then learning about drivers, installing stuff, suffering through a complete lack of quality control (have fun figuring out how to fix every single bug you run into because you don't have a billion dollar company triple checking every part of every game you can buy) and a whole lot of other nonsense.  Buying a gaming PC has all the same problems minus putting it together yourself, but now you're paying a 300% markup.  But buying a console is literally just buy the box, buy a game (a lot of times they even include the game in the box!) and a little plastic card at walmart and following a user manual with big simple pictures where 90% of the work is nothing more complicated than matching the correct cable to the correct hole. At worse you call a not-tech-illiterate (not even tech savvy) family member and have them hook it up for you.  As it stands PC gaming is completely unfriendly to the average user, Steam has done a lot of work centralizing almost everything into a single store front, building PCs has gotten easier and cheaper but it's still not to the point where I could put one in my living room and have my mom be able to figure out how to watch Netflix and also have my eight year old cousin be able to launch whatever game he wants. I'm sure it'll get better in the next few years but as of today you can't really match the convenience of a console in any way besides maybe buying games.   As much as I enjoy PC as a platform it's still really lacking in so many basic ways and not at all user friendly for the tech-illiterate."
pcgaming,3ct7w6,SkateboardCop,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:28:30 2015 UTC,"Just because many people can't figure out how to google a simple tutorial to build a PC, does not mean it isn't the far superior platform. I built my PC freshman year of high school and that's late compared to a lot of people. It is not fucking hard. I do admit the process in the OP is wayyyy too difficult for the average user, but I can definitely see a company streamlining this into an easy to use software service."
pcgaming,3ct7w6,Super_Zac,2,Sat Jul 11 05:46:48 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see a company streamlining this into an easy to use software service.   you're talking about OnLive.  And this isn't about which platform is better because it's a stupid way of discussing the issue and fails to account for user cases. I need a system that I can get the most cost-efficient for performance solution to gaming, along with access to PC only genres (RTSs, arena shooters, emulation, etc) and the ability to do everything else (internet, programming, whatever). My brother needs ""is it easy to setup and does it have netflix?"" Like two completely different user cases and PC isn't the correct solution both times and my brother has no interest in learning how to build a computer because his needs are covered by a laptop, or even a tablet now and something that will play any popular streaming service on his big TV.   But my grandmother gets an appleTV because she doesn't care about games, she wants to watch Netflix and use AirPlay from her iPad and doesn't use anything else.   I didn't even have any issue with the original post, it's this comment about how this is a viable alternative to console gaming, it's  not because it fails to address the needs of console gamers. And it's not an alternative to regular PC gaming either. It's basically an alternative to expensive gaming laptops or other streaming services (like nvidia streaming) because those tie up your gaming rig and requires your home computer to run while you're away.   So amazon cloud gaming fills a specific niche, and console gaming fills another and there's not really any overlap between the two (nobody is buying a ps4 to play games while on a business trip or vacation) so it doesn't make sense to suggest one as a replacement or alternative for the other."
pcgaming,3ct7w6,SkateboardCop,0,Sat Jul 11 05:58:36 2015 UTC,"Did you scroll down to the Premade AMI? Did you even read any of it? It's a five step plan, not forty. If you're too lazy to read, or do five steps, maybe you belong with the rest of the console generation.  The tech illiterate don't belong here. If you don't take the time to read, or learn - anything, than you're not the person I'm trying to talk to. I'm talking console killing for the person of some intelligence who is willing to learn. If you have none, and you are unwilling to, than stay with your $300-$400 consoles and the $50-$60 annual cost to, um, connect to the internet (in addition to your ISP costs) to play $60 games made five, ten years ago. It's not my fault you don't want to learn how to play modern AAA $5, $10 steam games whenever you want on your laptop, right?  The only people that tech illiterate are people who want to be, who need to be; people who have are staunchly opposed to learning or understanding of any form. I have nothing against them. They just don't belong here - I'm not targetting them to save money or learn new things, because they won't."
pcgaming,3ct7w6,Skarsten,5,Sat Jul 11 04:37:44 2015 UTC,"you realize I can figure this out, I have done stuff similar to this, I have some stupid complicated PC setup instead of a dumb simple console solution, I haven't owned a console in over a decade but I'm still capable of realizing the massive failings of PC gaming when it comes to accessibility or user friendliness. I have old tablets mounted to my walls to replace paper calendars, I've run game servers before and I use to go to LAN parties and I program, this solution isn't unreasonable for me, it's actually meant for people like me, hobbyists/enthusiasts. But if my brother wanted to just to play a game I wouldn't pretend like this is a reasonable solution compared to plugging an xbox into the wall, the TV and using wifi to play the game.  But you're the one saying    If the definitive argument against console gaming hasn't been presented to date, it has now.   But this is a stupid as shit. I want to see you explain this shit to someone in your family  or a friend who owns a console and is shit with computers and convince them this is worth all the trouble. Even with the premade solution an average (and I don't mean your average tech-savvy person) person would still fuck something up so quick, and since they need the premade AMI in the first place they're probably not smart enough to fix it.   If you want to state that this solution is a ""cost-effective but somewhat complicated alternative to console gaming that would only be suitable for someone with the appropriate know-how to troubleshoot and fix any problems they encounter"" than I'd be fine.   But you're not saying that, you're saying this is an end-all be-all to console gaming than you're dead wrong. Console gaming fills a niche that PC gaming is still trying to fill (and failing really badly as far as I'm concerned) and as it stands PC gaming is inaccessible to your average consumer. Despite it's being more cost effective in terms of performance, more versatile, cheaper in the long run, cheaper games, and the ability to do whatever you want PC gaming still doesn't have a solution to somebody who wants to buy a single box, plug two things and be able to play games and watch netflix on said box without an additional nonsense.  Ideally Steam Machines (or something else IDK) will someday reach that level. But until I can buy my brother a steam box that he can plug in, log onto his Netflix/Hulu/Spotify accounts and have them all work without any issue. On top of that he should be able to access a digital store where he knows any game he purchases will work on his Valve Certified Steam Machine and won't require any user patches, or INI tweaks, or have annoying launchers that force him to use a keyboard and mouse.   Until that's a reality I still think consoles fill a market that needs to be filled and I won't recommend PC gaming to anybody unless they care enough about the upsides to deal with all the nonsense that comes with the territory.  And there might be a larger discussion about how some of these issues might be fundamentally unsolvable without dumbing the platform down to console level (I don't think so, but that's a discussion for a different time) but you unless your proposed solution is actually usable for the people who currently use consoles and includes all of their needs than it isn't the    definitive argument against console gaming."
pcgaming,3ct7w6,SkateboardCop,-1,Sat Jul 11 05:29:53 2015 UTC,"I want to see you explain this shit to someone in your family or a friend who owns a console and is shit with computers and convince them this is worth all the trouble.   That's the thing. I wouldn't. It would be a waste of time. But for someone who actually cares about learning and technology, it would save a lot of time and money.  This isn't the ""definitive argument against console gaming"" for morons. There's no arguing with morons. But for people who can actually carry a coherent conversation, and understand basic technology, this is the definitive argument against console gaming.   Granted, I said if there hasn't been one before. I think the original definitive argument against console gaming was Steam, but if that didn't count, this certainly counts - as an argument pointed towards people who can think for themselves.

So why not say that instead?  Also not everybody cares about learning about technology, my brother enjoys building stuff and gardening, I like messing with computers and technology in general, so if my brother has any interest in gaming a console is the better choice for him, and a PC is better for me since I would quickly run into issues with the closed natures of consoles."

pcgaming,3ct7w6,waterbottle523,18,Fri Jul 10 16:32:22 2015 UTC,"It can't be simply because of latency.   Your connection can be as fast as you like,  but you'll always have extra latency if you play on a remote machine.  So, until we get zero-latency communications technology (assuming this is possible), using a remote server for your gaming machine will be subpar."
pcgaming,3ct7w6,Ahmon,5,Fri Jul 10 17:07:21 2015 UTC,"While latency is inevitable, some latency is tolerable.For example I used to game on my 360 hooked up to a TV with 15ms response time and it was fine.As long as the client is close enough to the server and has good enough internet to get a ping of under let's say 30ms, then the experience should mostly be the same.  I think a company with Microsoft's resources could pull off having the servers located close enough and making the software work.The question is when will the worlds internet get good enough for a large amount of gamers to play using cloud streaming under 30ms.Id say give it a few years"

pcgaming,3ct7w6,Not83,2,Tue Jul 14 23:25:53 2015 UTC,"I quite like the prospects of cloud gaming. But it's nevertheless going to be contending with two major issues.   Latency. If you don't live in the 1st world. In practice this means NA/EU/JP/AU/SP. People in places like Chile, Thailand or parts of central Asia like Kazakhstan today have a decent amount of wealth and IT infrastructure but are completely locked out. And even within regions, if you live in Portugal, you won't get sub-50 to either Frankfurt or Ireland yet you have access to high-speed fiber in even middle-to-lower density cities. Types of games. For SP-focused games, this isn't a big issue. If you're playing RPGs or strategy games like Civilisation, it doesn't matter much. If you're playing Overwatch on multiplayer or Battlefront, it does impact you.   Sitting as I am on a 100 mbit fiber connection with typically sub-5 ping on most Swedish servers, I'd be making pretty huge sacrifices for this. I get ~35 ping to Frankfurt, and that's not counting the extra overlay to cloud gaming.  So the irony is even if the target audience are those in wealthy countries like me, unless you play slow-paced games, you often lose a lot more by using this service. And anyway, today a lot of stuff doesn't need to be upgraded often, like the CPU. Using an i5-2500 is more than enough for most games today. I doubt we'll see revolutionary changes from my i7 Haswell in 2-3 years time, which I've used 2 years now. I haven't changed my 8 GB RAM for a while and I doubt I'll need to use 16 in the near future."

NOT ONE MENTION ANYWHERE even though myself and others have been begging for it for ages, and it's a drastically simpler fix than a majority of the items on this list. And to top it off it's an issue that's noticeable the second the gameplay starts for the first time, and one that persists through every moment of standard gameplay in a 30-200 hour game. A majority of players will never even see most of the bugs on this list. This is frustrating..."

I SPECIFICALLY DIDN'T because I'm totally fine with a value in a .ini/.cfg file. THAT DOESN'T AND HASN'T EVER EXISTED FOR WITCHER 3. There's no reference to field of view ANYWHERE in the freely available game files.   The ONLY way to change the game's FOV is to lock the dynamic value (controlled by static values, which are the ones that they should give us access to in an ini) with CheatEngine, thus ruining all cutscenes unless you toggle it off and reset it every single time you enter one.  CDPR has provided ZERO method of any kind to adjust it. CheatEngine is the only solution and it breaks the game. I'm not asking for a slider. I'm not asking for above and beyond. I can't believe your outright false statements are being upvoted as if they where even vaguely true."

Gigabyte and Asus run at around 60-65 degrees under full load (depending on room temperature and case airflow).  Stock coolers are almost always hotter because they trade cooling efficiency for the sake of dumping that heat outside your case.

This doesn’t make either card a notably better value, but makes the R9 Fury a very reasonable alternative to the GTX 980 on a price/performance basis. """

I may, however, just dish out the extra 100 dollars for a 980Ti.   On a side note, no matter what I'll be losing to diminishing returns it looks like when buying a high end card (which is expected). 100 bucks doesn't go as far at this price point as compared to 1-200 dollar cards."

If I could score two 390's for the same cost, and have 8g of vram (potentially 16 with DX12) would the only downside be extra heat/electricity costs?

pcgaming,3csmfz,Urbanscuba,2,Sat Jul 11 23:54:34 2015 UTC,"I can't really answer that for you. A lot of people love SLI, however I can tell you that I probably will not go for an SLI setup again after my experience with it. When SLI scales well it's awesome. When it doesn't scale well, I feel as though I paid all that money for a second card for nothing. I feel as though I have to rely on software updates too much, but that is a subjective opinion.

What they're doing now is just mind-boggling.  I still see some people defending this crap and it just throws me for a loop.  I know AMD is a business who needs to make money (now more than ever) but why are people so happy to allow AMD to drive up their prices for NO REASON?  Their current line-up is far less appealing than anything else they've released in years.  AMD's perf-per-dollar just went straight down the shitter.  Fury's launch pales in comparison to the 290 and 290X and I hated those cards, still do.  The only cards that might be reasonably priced are the 360, 370, and 390.  Everything else needs a cut.  Before criticizing me, please remember:  The 290X ($549) matched the original Titan ($999), the 290 ($399) matched the 780 ($649).  So what the heck is going on with AMD's current offerings?  Going by Hawaii, Fury should be beating the Titan X across the board.  Go back to October 2013 and look at the 290X vs Titan reviews, and consider those two cards occupied the same pricepoints as the Fury and Titan X do now.  Then compare those old reviews to the Fury vs Titan X reviews today.  Then also remember the 980 Ti exists (the 780 Ti didn't at the time) and is more competitive than the 780 Ti was when it eventually did release, relative to the Titan.  All in all it's just a shit showing by AMD.  How do people forget their history so soon?  It's been a year and a half.  Neither Fury nor Fury X deserve any praise aside from the SFF + Watercooler combo on Fury X.  As someone who waited over a year for Pirate Islands, this is just an embarrassment.  F and FX exist as fanboy bait, over-priced video cards in low-supply which will sell out anyway.  Everybody on the fence (like me) is getting screwed by AMD.  I feel like an asshole for not getting a 970 last September.  Wish I had a time machine."

It's probably still technically AMD's fault that a lost of people need to see AMD deliver significantly more value to consider them competitive with Nvidia but it's hilarious anyway.
pcgaming,3csmfz,Unkechaug,-6,Fri Jul 10 19:38:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe because people are right to be disappointed. It's more than a half year after Nvidia's offerings hit shelves and AMD is only reaching parity now in terms of performance, as well as price/performance. They STILL consume more power! And this is is with brand new technology that hasn't been used by Nvidia, as well as before any significant Nvidia price drops.   The 900 series has been, objectively, a better buy for the vast majority. I hope AMD will start to compete next release cycle, because I really don't want to buy Nvidia again after the 970 fiasco. But ultimately I and most others will go for the best deal no matter the brand."
pcgaming,3csmfz,Hariooo,17,Fri Jul 10 15:44:15 2015 UTC,"They STILL consume more power!   Have you changed all the lightbulbs in your house to be compact fluorescent? 30W per bulb. You can probably make up the difference between Fury X and a 980Ti with 1-2 rooms.  And once again it's still kind of AMD's fault that they let the prevailing thought be that the power usage of video cards is in any way a significant part of any household's total energy consumption, but it's still hilarious when people talk about it anyway."
pcgaming,3csmfz,DoomAxe,10,Fri Jul 10 18:13:18 2015 UTC,"People do blow the power thing out of proportion.  I think the issue is the fact that it came out later, is not better in price/performance, and consumes more power.  So while TDP may not really be an issue, it's still a negative aspect even if it's a small one.    As far as I'm concerned, price/performance prevails over anything else.  If that's equal, then other aspects like TDP come into play.  Higher TDP translates to a hotter gaming room for me.  The energy cost associated with a higher TDP is pretty much negligible if you're in the continental United States."
pcgaming,3csmfz,Unkechaug,2,Fri Jul 10 18:31:43 2015 UTC,"I think you missed the point of the post. The reason people talk about power consumption is because:   It's more than a half year after Nvidia's offerings hit shelves and AMD is only reaching parity now in terms of performance, as well as price/performance.   It's pretty much the only difference. If X and Y are basically identical, except X consumes less power, it's the superior product.

It also prefers 'greener' branded products because thats where the general trend of society is there.  AMD's performance has improved over time, the 290x trades blows with the 980  and had been for months now due to better drivers. It especially destroys the once mighty 780ti. But you still see it crapped over all this thread and most forums outside of a couple where the power user usually can be found.   At the end of the day, all the mainstream consumer wants is AMD to undercut nvidia for price, so they can buy into the illusion of nvidias premiuim prodects for a lesser percieved cost."

pcgaming,3csmfz,Rj_d,9,Sun Jul 12 16:35:35 2015 UTC,"They've probably realised that the mindset of consumers is that expensive = better. They've shipped the last many generations much cheaper than nvidias equivalent products and it has a psychological effect on pretty much all of us and you can't deny it. Amd just seems like a less premium product compared to nvidia.  I think they need to start pricing themselves higher and working on their drivers and creating a full feature software suite like Geforce experience because raptr sucks. Then people will stop associating amd as the cheap brand that isn't as good as the expensive nvidia brand.   The low cost high performance really hasn't been pulling off for them as we can see with their stock price continually plummeting every month. They should still try to aim some cards for that great cost/performance but they really can't afford to be selling their top cards with such a low profit margin. I'm pretty sure they were making less than like $20 on the last few generations per card, I heard people saying they may of only been making like $5 or less a card for some of them. Meanwhile, nvidia is making like triple that per card. However these are just my opinions and I'm taking a stab at their profits per card but I'm 99% sure it's very very low.  Apple has shown that people prefer a premium experience at high cost than the previous mindset of technology which was - make it as cheap as possible."
pcgaming,3csmfz,TheAlbinoAmigo,12,Sun Jul 12 19:57:38 2015 UTC,"Particularly agree with the 390(X). The 8GB is nice, sure, but for 1080p and most games at 1440p its unnecessary and the extra cost against the 290(X) just isn't worthwhile. Its the same story with the 380, and the lack of option for a 3GB model like before with the 280(X) is not a smart move in my eyes at that pricepoint. AMD have massively reduced their price:performance on the same chips in the last line-up, which is nothing but a bad move in my eyes.  A friend of mine was asking for help making a build recently, and we were telling him to hold off til 3XX drops. When they dropped, we recommended he get a 290 quickly before they all got discontinued since the 390 was poor value in comparison, and was out of his price range. He would have had to drop to a 380, which is a slower chip than the 280X but costs more (at least for the version with 4GB)."
pcgaming,3csmfz,TheAlbinoAmigo,3,Fri Jul 10 17:06:05 2015 UTC,"Because the 290 is very similar performance for $80 less, and 4GB is currently plenty of VRAM in 1080p."
pcgaming,3csmfz,TheAlbinoAmigo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:25:36 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  The 290 supply is limited since they discontinued it, and the reason the discontinued it so quickly is because it very obviously represents better value to 1080p users.  The new cards do bench somewhat better, but clock-for-clock are nearly identical and are not worth the premium."

Remember we just had this debate about Kepler.  It's funny how AMD can be widely known for having ""shitty drivers"" yet people take their DAY ONE Fury X driver as gospel.  I know you shouldn't buy the Fury X hoping that future drivers will be better, but let's not act like Fury X's June 14th performance is the max ceiling it will ever reach.

Right now it's worth $650 @ 4K depending on how much you value the watercooler.  But in truth, it's overclockability that kills AMD this cycle.  Maxwell has huge gains from OCing, up to 25% performance boost across the entire line-up.  Fury in particular doesn't even come close."

Taken alone it can be a little misleading, as the 980 Ti beats it handily at 1440p and it a variety of other games not shown on that page.

All I care about is if the card(s) I pick will handle playing games on the Vive at high resolution and framerates. I'm not sure if the R9 Fury will be able to handle that. I don't really want to go with dual 390s though either. I'm very curious to see what the Nano will look like. If it has the right performance/price spot, running dual Nanos may be the perfect VR solution."
pcgaming,3csmfz,LetsGoEighty,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:09:47 2015 UTC,"So, considering this, should I get a 980 or Fury for 1080p?"

pcgaming,3csmfz,LetsGoEighty,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:32:42 2015 UTC,"Overclocking would push the 980 over the Fury right? At 1080p, considering the 980 was probably a reference card. And I'd get a Gigabyte one."
pcgaming,3csmfz,bffire,0,Fri Jul 10 23:26:05 2015 UTC,"Looks between the 980 and Fury X, pretty much exactly where it should be for the price.  No doubt 980's will get a price drop though."
pcgaming,3csmfz,Sayburirum,9,Sat Jul 11 01:56:46 2015 UTC,Why would they though?  They are still cheaper and they perform in some cases better than the fury.
pcgaming,3csmfz,harpuajim25,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:57:35 2015 UTC,Isn't the 980 MSRP still at 550? Or did I miss a price drop already?  http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1521?vs=1442 It performs better in very few circumstances.
pcgaming,3csmfz,sertz,15,Sun Jul 12 15:59:47 2015 UTC,It was dropped to $499 when the 980Ti came out.
pcgaming,3csmfz,thatobviouswall,6,Sun Jul 12 16:02:06 2015 UTC,From the review   in a straight-up performance shootout with the GTX 980 the R9 Fury is 10% more expensive for 8%+ better performance.   nvidia isn't really pressured.
pcgaming,3csmfz,FrostyWalrus2,2,Fri Jul 10 13:38:58 2015 UTC,It depends. If the Fury performs better for the money over the 980 but people are still buying more 980's than Fury's then why would they drop the price?
pcgaming,3csmfz,kawifcknsaki,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:53:59 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling this and the Fury X will benefit hugely from driver updates down the road. People know Nvidia's driver team are amazing and it's hard for the AMD guys to match that. Also HBM is brand new tech, so I imagine it will take a little longer to grasp its potential.   The reviews seem to mirror this though, as some games the Fury X is beating a 980ti handily, where other games it seems to be a fairly unimpressive jump from last gen.  Overall the 980ti is just a beast with great engineering behind it and the software support to squeak out its potential. The fury has the power and engineering... the drivers just need to catch up."
pcgaming,3csmfz,SithisTheDreadFather,-1,Fri Jul 10 14:08:41 2015 UTC,Wasn't there something about nvidia having lower quality frames in order to increase fps? I'm not saying its actually what happend but that's just what I  remember.  Edit: its just a question.
pcgaming,3csmfz,kawifcknsaki,-3,Fri Jul 10 14:22:26 2015 UTC,"They're only hope is that HBM performs great, otherwise these releases are still behind Nvidia. Let's see how this plays out."
pcgaming,3csmfz,SithisTheDreadFather,4,Fri Jul 10 14:02:13 2015 UTC,"We already know for the most part and honestly it doesnt look to make much of a difference at all. The only cards running HBM are the new Fiji cores with added CUs and they perform as one would expect them to perform if they had regular GDDR5 memory. Had the Fiji cards just destroyed the Nvidia cards, I would have attributed it to HBM.    390X (GDDR5) -> GTX 980 (GDDR5) -> R9 Fury (HBM) -> R9 Fury X (HBM) -> GTX 980Ti (GDDR5)    Doesnt look good for HBM..."
pcgaming,3csmfz,kawifcknsaki,2,Fri Jul 10 13:54:19 2015 UTC,"Nah, this is first gen HBM. If AMD can get production up, it will get cheaper, better, and more useful. AMD is playing the long game with HBM. Could they've gotten away with GDDR5 on Fiji? Probably. It might not make a huge difference now, but I predict that we'll see much bigger gains when the next gen cards come out."
pcgaming,3csmfz,SithisTheDreadFather,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:58:49 2015 UTC,"But thats just it, on paper HBM does make a huge difference.  Its incredibly fast compared to GDDR5. HBM has a memory bus bandwidth that is 16 times bigger than the 980 Ti, thats incredible! But does it translate to real world performance? No, the 980 Ti easily trounces the R9 Fury X."
pcgaming,3csmfz,owari69,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:37:29 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah. In practice it doesn't make a huge difference right now, but I bet it'll be necessary in the coming years. I think it's pretty forward-thinking by AMD: if they get production up now they can work out any kinks. They have time to utilize it's potential for the next cards while driving down the costs associated with new technology. It's kinda like Apple's strategy towards flash memory in the early 2000's. It was kinda shit for the iPods at first, but once the iPhone came out they had affordable, relatively advanced flash memory all ready to go."
pcgaming,3csmfz,kawifcknsaki,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:38:03 2015 UTC,"Or maybe memory bus width really isnt that important? Nvidia has been using 256 mbit bus width since 2003.  I feel like if bus width was actually an important aspect of Graphics card performance, in the last 12 years Nvidia would have done something to improve it."
pcgaming,3csmfz,an_angry_Moose,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:02:07 2015 UTC,"There has been plenty of historical criticism of bus width. Jumping from 512bit to 4096bit is massive, and any memory bottleneck is effectively gone. It gives AMD's chips room to grow into rather than working around limitations and perhaps it can instigate a shift in how the engineers think about designing the chips.   As we've seen, it's not crazy effective now (it is in some ways and isn't in others), but it's first gen technology for GPUs. It's likely just growing pains.   But I'm basically talking out of my ass here. I know nothing of computer engineering."
pcgaming,3csmfz,Gazareth,4,Fri Jul 10 20:31:08 2015 UTC,"I think you're discrediting how much of this has to do with Nvidia's better memory controllers and their superior compression techniques. They've been getting away with smaller faster busses for several years now (starting with gtx 680), so it seems to me that nvidia is able to do more with less bandwidth rather than HBM not living up to the hype. I think HBM on an nvidia card will really show what it's capable of."

pcgaming,3cy0xl,Silverlight42,2,Sat Jul 11 21:15:39 2015 UTC,Usually I shop and wait for cards to fall in the $350 price range... might make an exception for this one as it's been far too long for an upgrade....   though ideally i'll want a new monitor too.  1680x1050 aint cutting it anymore.
pcgaming,3cy0xl,RubyVesper,3,Sat Jul 11 23:16:54 2015 UTC,Why are you even considering that card at that resolution? Even an R9 290 would be overkill!
pcgaming,3cy0xl,Silverlight42,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:11:38 2015 UTC,That's why I mentioned the monitor.  If I get a card like that i'm upgrading.  Just right now it seems like the new 4k and stuff is kinda in flux so i'm holding off...   I don't know much about the new monitors though but I do my research before I buy.  Will probably get an SSD at the same time since those are at a good place right now.
pcgaming,3cy0xl,RubyVesper,2,Sun Jul 12 15:16:28 2015 UTC,"You could also look at 144hz if you play twitch-based first person games, it's really something else."
pcgaming,3cy0xl,Silverlight42,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:20:53 2015 UTC,"ah yeah, That's true.  I am aware of that.  144 might be overkill but more than 60 would be nice.   I'm also one that totally believes in always turning on vsync... no sense rendering frames you'll never see.  Like I said, I think the monitor market is still trying to find its way into the next accepted standard and I wanna see how things fall a bit more before I make my choice.  I also think calling it 4k is stupid since it's not 4000p or anything... but whatever."
pcgaming,3cy0xl,RubyVesper,2,Sun Jul 12 15:29:40 2015 UTC,"Well, there is quite a bit of use for frames you won't see, namely that they reduce input delay. That's why CS:GO pros always play at 300+ FPS. VSync also typically buffers more than one frame, so input delay is increased even further, while the main purpose of a 144hz is direct and fluid motion for the most direct possible hand-to-screen connection. What is nice though, is that the tearing problem of 60hz is mostly mitigated through switching to 144, even if you don't use VSync. Due to the lower time between refreshes, the distance between two neighbouring frames is much lower. Most people just can't even see the tearing at all at 144hz."
pcgaming,3cy0xl,Silverlight42,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:34:54 2015 UTC,"I'd probably be one to see tearing at 144... but I haven't tried.  I also didn't think about that.   I'd be very interested in trying though.  I get the whole input delay thing, and with some games I can notice it but for the most part I don't.   I think a lot of it has to do how they implement it.   I'll probably be more mindful in the future as it isn't something I usually think about...   I don't do CS at all, but I imagine it's pretty easy to get high framerates on that.  Tearing doesn't even bother me much, I just don't like my video card going 100% all the time.  I've had so many video cards fail because of the fan over the years....   one more reason to go liquid... already got it on my cpu and it works wonderfully."

pcgaming,3cy0xl,newguyeverytime,-5,Tue Jul 14 15:11:20 2015 UTC,"TL;DR  They crank AA to maximum to weaken AMD numbers. No one uses AA at 1440 plus, they use Downscaling which looks better and AMD excels at. Run the tests again at 3800x1600 downscaled to 2560x1440 with no AA."

pcgaming,3cy0xl,newguyeverytime,-3,Sun Jul 12 01:31:16 2015 UTC,Why not use downscaling as it the best looking option? If AMD is capable of pushing better looking AA I want to see real results.
pcgaming,3cy0xl,Med1vh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:34:44 2015 UTC,Because maybe that was not the best way to do this test? maybe 70% of people turn AA on rather than downsampling so the test is more relevant?  Jesus you AMDrones have some weird inferiority complex or something.
pcgaming,3cy0xl,newguyeverytime,-4,Sun Jul 12 01:38:31 2015 UTC,"You just made up a percentage for no real reason. I only said that I wanted reviews to get with the times and push real AA. Running 8x msaa at 4k makes zero sense and only skews the public perception of the power these cards have. You don't need two overclocked 980ti's to run 30 fps at 4k, with msaa off it would probably be running at a smooth 60fps."
