shittyfoodporn,3dxnfa,jacksrenton,20,Tue Jul 21 01:56:24 2015 UTC,That's really bad for the dog dude
shittyfoodporn,3dxnfa,TrapXtreme,10,Mon Jul 20 20:39:11 2015 UTC,It's not really bad for dogs. It's just bad for certain dogs that can't take high protein and fat. (They can vomit and have diarrhea) Other dogs it's fine.   Using it as a primary diet is bad for all dogs.
shittyfoodporn,3dxnfa,awhaling,0,Mon Jul 20 22:41:02 2015 UTC,My dog won't get vomit or diarrhea but it's still really bad for her. She is a great dane. Too much protein can mess up her legs. It will make them bow out. You actually have to get giant breed formulas for large dogs like great danes. Luckily she's full grown so it's not as bad for her as it would be if she was a growing puppy.   She steals from the cats dish quite often though. I moved the cats feeding area to where I thought she wouldn't be able to squeeze but she proved me wrong. Sometimes she will pop the lid to the storage bin and chow down before I catch her. She loves the stuff.   As far as people food she doesn't beg but when I first brought her home she did a little counter surfing. I knew she was big but I honestly didn't think about the fact her head can clear the kitchen counter without her coming off her front paws. She grabbed something really hot I had just took fresh off the stove and never did it again.
shittyfoodporn,3dxnfa,mechchic84,7,Tue Jul 21 02:58:18 2015 UTC,It was a little can of soft food and just one time as a treat but I didn't know it could be bad.  Thanks for the heads up.
shittyfoodporn,3dxnfa,Idrawtwo,8,Mon Jul 20 20:43:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if he didn't react badly to it it's not a big deal. Do some googling on it.   Mainly, you shouldn't give it to them as their primary diet. But if they don't vomit or shit everywhere then it's fine if you give them a small amount as a treat every once in a while.   But just to be safe, it's best to use dog specific food."
shittyfoodporn,3dxnfa,awhaling,6,Mon Jul 20 22:46:19 2015 UTC,"Oh I googled, it's because dog are omnivores and cats are strict carnivores.  The site I read compared it to a person eating nothing but cake, probably why my dog loved it. No shit or vomit, luckily."
shittyfoodporn,3dxnfa,Idrawtwo,2,Tue Jul 21 00:40:51 2015 UTC,Hahaha I read read the same one.
shittyfoodporn,3dxnfa,awhaling,-5,Tue Jul 21 01:12:29 2015 UTC,Actually cat food is better for dogs than most dog food. It's higher in protein because cats can't handle all the crap they get away with putting in dog food.
shittyfoodporn,3dxnfa,rogue_chicken,7,Mon Jul 20 21:36:01 2015 UTC,"You are right and wrong. The dogs love the high protein, but that high protein and fat isn't good for some dogs.   For some dogs it's totally fine, and works as a a good treat. Other dogs might shit all over the place. So it really depends."

shittyfoodporn,3dxnfa,TrapXtreme,4,Mon Jul 20 21:58:52 2015 UTC,My dog steals the cats food when she thinks no one is looking.

shittyfoodporn,3dw4lx,CarlFriedrichGauss,5,Mon Jul 20 01:28:43 2015 UTC,You know the original Thai Sriracha sauce before Huy Fong Foods took the name and ran with it is much sweeter and less acidic than the Viet-American one.
shittyfoodporn,3dw4lx,HULKx,2,Mon Jul 20 06:03:09 2015 UTC,I did not. Where do you think I could find it?
shittyfoodporn,3dw4lx,TheAntiPedantic,4,Mon Jul 20 06:08:33 2015 UTC,The Asian market here has about 10 different brands of sriracha

During his humble beginnings, the unsurpassable genius produced his first hot sauce called Pepper Sa-te. He filled his Sa-te sauce in recycled glass baby food jars that then was sold and delivered by family members via bicycle. In 1979, his astounding voyage began by departing communist Vietnam on a Taiwanese freighter that was registered in Panama, named Huey Fong. Later that name became the inspiration namesake of his beloved company, Huy Fong Foods.    Source"

Thai Sriracha predates Huy Fong Sriracha by at least 30 years, probably more."

Another time the assistant store manager gave one to an upset customer, something about her son being cheated at our store (probably bs). She gave the customer a 360. I recall that because I remember hearing the store manager mention to her next time something like that happens to take it out of the back room and just give it to the customer without putting it through the POS.

The domino's motto for unhappy  customers is apologize,  give them what they want,  and give them something extra.  If you called back they would for sure remake it.  Also 11am isn't bad.

shittyfoodporn,3duwwk,johnnydowjones,4,Mon Jul 20 16:39:28 2015 UTC,"Just a word of advice, because I used to deliver. If the pizza place on your area tends to have a ""par"" track record in terms of quality or service, NEVER order first thing in the morning. You see, you don't get the fresh cheese and other ingredients, you get the shit left over from the night before, much of which was sitting in a bin in the make line for a couple of hours. A GOOD pizza place will at least try to mix in fresh shit in the A.M., but when you have a manager running late because they closed the night before, they are scrambling to get the 20 pizzas made for the order placed yesterday for the office party today, get the food prep lined out, and still take a barrage of phone calls because it's raining. They might just dump last nights shit in the make line and go.  Yeah, best to wait an hour and order then."
shittyfoodporn,3duwwk,Going-Deep-08,-145,Sun Jul 19 23:00:29 2015 UTC,"pro tip, you had it coming."
shittyfoodporn,3duwwk,Going-Deep-08,52,Mon Jul 20 14:51:02 2015 UTC,"I planned to at least tip the dude well, but he bailed without even giving me the receipt..."
shittyfoodporn,3duwwk,ledgenskill,-172,Sun Jul 19 19:07:15 2015 UTC,"Well, I put that wrong. You could order pizza any time  But at the same time, if it was a big thunderstorm, then the chances of that driving being killed in an accident would've been huge.  But at least you guys got pizza. I mean, I would've at least waited for it to clear before ordering."
shittyfoodporn,3duwwk,Going-Deep-08,71,Sun Jul 19 19:14:32 2015 UTC,if the chances are like that then they shouldnt send him out in the first place. Its their fault for accepting the order
shittyfoodporn,3duwwk,TheReaver88,-147,Sun Jul 19 19:22:37 2015 UTC,"OR  If I look out my window, and see a severe thunderstorm, the LAST thing on my mind would be:  ""Hey, let's make someone drive through that to get me food!""  Just saying. Ask anyone else if that's what they're thinking.  edit: Keep the downvotes coming trolls <3 I speak nothing but the truth."
shittyfoodporn,3duwwk,funsteps,125,Sun Jul 19 21:05:50 2015 UTC,"As a former delivery guy, I would go out in thunderstorms with the understanding that the weather was the exact reason why a lot of people were paying extra for delivery. Shitty weather = more business and possibly better tips."
shittyfoodporn,3duwwk,IForgotAboutDre,40,Sun Jul 19 21:19:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I delivered pizza for years and it ALWAYS got busy during rain storms and snow storms. No one wants to go outside, but they're hungry. Most people would actually apologize to me when I ran up to the door looking like a drowned rat and then they'd tip me well."
shittyfoodporn,3duwwk,Lasereye,12,Sun Jul 19 22:28:33 2015 UTC,"Right, I tip heavy for bad weather. And I make sure it's cash. 5 bucks regular weather and a 10 spot for bad weather."
shittyfoodporn,3duwwk,johnnydowjones,2,Mon Jul 20 01:58:46 2015 UTC,I usually do % and add on a hard extra if it's bad weather. Some places are a 2 minute drive down my street while some are further on worse streets so I take that into account for the bonus for me being an asshole in bad weather.

Delivery drivers exist for the times people don't want to drive themselves.  They are PROFESSIONAL drivers (professional does not mean the best of the best like an F1, it means someone who will do whatever it takes to make a buck because those are the cards life dealt you).  Those are the times they get real tips.  If the company they worked for considered it a real threat to drive in, they would not send them out.  If they consider themselves decent drivers who want to make some money, they're all about that shit.  It's what they live for.  You speak nothing but ignorance."

shittyfoodporn,3duwwk,99639,19,Mon Jul 20 03:00:49 2015 UTC,Here's what I'm thinking. Weather can be extremely localized. That means it can raining really hard in one area and be fine 3 miles away. I'm also thinking this driver was being a lazy fuck and that you might be an asshole.
shittyfoodporn,3duwwk,DoctorSugarbear,10,Mon Jul 20 10:44:07 2015 UTC,The only people afraid of thunderstorms are dogs because turns out rain doesn't kill anyone.  Just use your wipers and go a little slower what the fuck is wrong with you.

shittyfoodporn,3duwwk,benito823,9,Mon Jul 20 02:31:49 2015 UTC,"The delivery guy likely had to slam on his breaks and the pizza got jostled.  They were at the end of the bag for chicken bites, and gave you lots of small pieces instead of 12 good sized ones.  For future reference, if you called them up shortly after receiving the order, they will certainly remake it for free. If they don't,  call corporate. But tbh it doesn't look that bad to me. But I'm also very hungry."
shittyfoodporn,3duwwk,dpgproductions,14,Mon Jul 20 05:10:58 2015 UTC,I used to be a delivery driver. You'd have to roll your vehicle for the pizza sauce/cheese to get that mashed up.
shittyfoodporn,3duwwk,improperlycited,6,Mon Jul 20 02:26:38 2015 UTC,"I delivered pizza for years at 5 different establishments. Believe me, it can happen. I've had a pizza sent back that looked like it was put in the drier, and I delivered it myself with nothing out of the ordinary happening.  The bottom of pizza boxes, the bottom of pizzas, and therefore the friction between them differ from place to place. Also, the amount of cheese or sauce can play a role in the viscosity of the toppings.  Also, if he stops short, the pizza will want to slide forward off the seat and onto the floor. If he catches it before it falls, but at a 45° angle, this is the result. I've had it happen/seen it happen on multiple occasions."

shittyfoodporn,3dtz3a,johnlongest,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:13:25 2015 UTC,Squeeze bottles of ketchup and chili sauce at KFC. I think it was the same at McDonald's.
shittyfoodporn,3dtz3a,bites,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:18:13 2015 UTC,Kind of there is a pump you push the handle down on and sauce come out.  http://www.afdr.org/files/d643b749-bc86-4be9-bc8a-149fe8239559.jpg  There are also fancy ones that I guess have a motorized pump where you use the lever the same way as a water cooler.  http://blogging.la/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/photo-032608-001.jpg

shittyfoodporn,3dtz3a,Dr-Clutch,9,Sun Jul 19 18:35:24 2015 UTC,you could say that about every single thing at mcdonalds   local takeaways sell burger meals between £2-£4 which is cheaper than what id pay at  mcdonalds and would satisfy me so much better
