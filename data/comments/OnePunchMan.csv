OnePunchMan,3e55zv,Mr_Valet,2,Wed Jul 22 01:11:56 2015 UTC,"I believe it means he doesn't have a level cap. He has massively high speed and strength stats, and with more training or experience those stats can be raised indefinitely. But I think that he does have a finite amount of power at any given time, otherwise he wouldn't have to get ""serious"" to scale up.  EDIT REPLY: By word-of-character and his serious strike on Boros, Saitama is definately a planet buster. Based on feats and some implied power-scaling, though, I don't think Saitama is quite on Superman's level at the moment. Having no limit means that Saitama could surpass anyone in pure strength given enough time and practice."
OnePunchMan,3e55zv,The11025,2,Wed Jul 22 02:17:18 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure he's limitless but due to the fact he's a gag character, it's a little hard to pit him against Superman or Goku or anyone else in a serious fight."
OnePunchMan,3e55zv,Boofan01,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:57:18 2015 UTC,"Well he does have a limit, but it's hard to scale given despite his ""serious series"" he never seemed to put much effort in his fighting.    His serious strike felt more like putting a bit of strength in his attack instead of just throwing a light jab.    i have yet to imagine what would happen if he really got pissed off and fought for something he really cared about.    Mainly his strength is based on his opponents and the comical effect.    I wouldn't be surprised to see him punch increasingly strong foes without much of a change in him."

He fought a lot more earlier in the series when he was capped at 50% or so of his real power, but now that he's up to like 70% (and 90% in his left arm) he rarely actually fights.  The comic is a lot more reality based than One Punch Man. No super powers."

Your character is immortal and, in fact, some times you need to be ""hurt"" by your enemies in order to progress.  This can be the same. Defeating the enemies is not the important part of the game. Finding them and, protecting the innocents and trying to minimise the collateral damage, that would be the challenge.  And, yes, you can one punch your enemies but doing it increases the collateral damage you do. You can play however you want, though."
OnePunchMan,3dijr9,Garrosh,2,Fri Jul 17 20:09:26 2015 UTC,perhaps as an rpg but not a fighter game cuz whoever plays as saitama is gonna win with one punch
OnePunchMan,3dijr9,Kfnmp4h,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:10:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe have Saitama as a summoned special attack (that way you don't make it too easy), you start off with your character at the lowest rank and you can get others to join you (you have Saitama from the beginning for specials since you bought him dinner and he's paying you back one punch at a time but he's really not serious about his attacks since he's helping you versus telling you to step back since he's going to one shot someone).  Group PCs can have special combo's depending on who's with you (having all S Ranked players doesn't mean you'll have the best attacks though)."
OnePunchMan,3dijr9,RemnantX,2,Fri Jul 17 15:01:54 2015 UTC,"A Mugen like game would be fine. Yes it would break the whole sense of Saitama being a OP but we would soon forget that after seeing Licenceless Rider doing his ultimate move and throwing his bicycle at Tatsumaki and winning the match. Other funny move would be King's ultimate, calling in Saitama and doing a huge amount of dmg... Hahah, yes I'd gladly open my wallet for a game like that..."
OnePunchMan,3dijr9,Hunncas,2,Thu Jul 16 19:31:16 2015 UTC,"...I was really confused by your title, I thought you were writing a post TO ""Early but OnePunch-Man game""...  It's ""Too"".  Related to you're (jk) post, I think it would be cool as an action game where you play as various heroes and villains like Genos/Sonic/License-less Rider. Saitama is obviously too powerful to be your constant character, I feel like the best use for him would be as a 'finisher' for boss fights, like you do enough damage or survive long enough against a boss and you 'win' and get the Saitama finisher, where he makes a fool of them as per usual.  The idea of playing as him during his rise to power is also fun, but it couldn't be the main focus of the story: the meat of OPM will always be the hero association and Saitama being ""Too Strong""."
OnePunchMan,3dijr9,dGFisher,3,Fri Jul 17 23:14:57 2015 UTC,"A want a fighter game for the sake of mismatches like Licenceless Rider vs Tatsumaki. There are so many games like these that are not balanced on canon, and this one wouldn't have to be either. Also, stuff like SoSS vs Fubuki would actually be cool."
OnePunchMan,3dijr9,The11025,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:49:09 2015 UTC,I could enjoy all 7 minutes of gameplay with Saitama one-shotting everything.
OnePunchMan,3dijr9,MiggyMcMiggy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:34:47 2015 UTC,You would just casually walk around and occasionally hit the punch button one time when fighting an enemy
OnePunchMan,3dijr9,Breesive,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:15:25 2015 UTC,The challenge is reaching the enemy.
OnePunchMan,3dijr9,Garrosh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:05:15 2015 UTC,Honestly the only way this could work is as a rythm game where each beat is just saitama destroying one huge monster one click at a time
OnePunchMan,3dijr9,eucalysis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:06:17 2015 UTC,A game like asura's wrath where you play the other heroes in several chapters but you also get to be Saitama and be awesome once  in a while.
OnePunchMan,3dijr9,Raidend,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:44:07 2015 UTC,A game in which you play as licenceless rider.  It's basically a batman game but your only gadget is a bike and some Bald asshole always last-hits the bad guy.

I guess idk  and for the opponents that can actually relatively challenge him, you get to actually fight as saitama, like the mosnters during his training, his dream sequence, the boros and garou fights"

OnePunchMan,3dglfr,Toko22,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:00:59 2015 UTC,it could be a final villain.  As an avid anime fan i've watched hundreds of series and the closest protagnoist to saitama is alucard from hellsing or kenshiro from  hokuto no ken.  They didnt meet their matches until the end.
OnePunchMan,3dglfr,Fessere,2,Thu Jul 16 17:06:53 2015 UTC,"true, but OPM makes fun of regular series."
OnePunchMan,3dglfr,steppingonthebeach,4,Thu Jul 16 20:12:19 2015 UTC,"Is not about the training or DarkShineAlloy should be the strongest out there. Is about how Saitama got his power. A scientist tolds Zombieman Saitama broke his ""limiter"" and achived god-like power. It can be the explanation, but it can be only a hypotesis. Also we saw with emperor guy a ""god"" that can grant power and take them back so maybe this ""god"" gave Saitama his power. Or maybe there some sort of ""olympus"" with different gods and was another god to give to Saitama his power, I remember a line during the ""hero admission test"" that sound pretty much like this ""It's like god himself resides in his body"".  We really know to little to make any speculation."
OnePunchMan,3dglfr,asdasdgfrw,2,Thu Jul 16 08:22:45 2015 UTC,"Nah. It's most likely ""limiter"" broking. Garou pretty much confirms that hypotesis.  As we saw in King's flashback, Saitama was pretty desperate in being a hero. ""Go all-out while experiencing half-death"" is most likely the condition for broking the ""limiter""."
OnePunchMan,3dglfr,Raoh90,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:46:15 2015 UTC,"there should be a villiain from a distant planet that teleports Saitama to that said planet, where everyone is just as strong (or close to) as Saitama. Then we can finally see him struggle and see what he does when he's pinned with having to go with 50% or more of his strength"
OnePunchMan,3dglfr,formlessfish,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:49:24 2015 UTC,I think Saitama may have just had a weak limiter at the beginning and so when he actually trained he broke it with little effort and since then he has just continued to get stupid strong. Maybe another character could have the same issue down the line but idk if that would work in this series
OnePunchMan,3dglfr,Goodfornothing123,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:21:37 2015 UTC,the only person i can think of who could be strong could be the guy saitama told he hasn't done enough training or it could be blast because we've never seen him and to keep rank 1 after what tornado did at the ma he must be a monster

It's also stated that people can become mysterious beings through hatred/trauma/unusual circumstances/etc....   The simple answer is exactly what Dr. Genus exampled to Zombieman. He broke the natural limitations humans have through sheer willpower/desire as he trained with everything he had. No limits means no power ceiling. Saitama's power level is infinity + 1. Since OPM is a comedy gag manga, that's about as a realistic/scientific explanation as we're going to get.  Although, it may be possible that ""God"" had something to do with it, and Saitama just forgot about it/didn't realize because he's Saitama."

But yeah, it makes sense if that was the reason for his power and all of the heroes/villiains powers too.  Just like vaccine man obsessed over pollution and taking revenge on the human race for it."
OnePunchMan,3d5fnv,Raoh90,2,Wed Jul 15 19:18:53 2015 UTC,Huh... that...actually sounds pretty feasible all things considered.

Just like Crabrante who turns to a crab monster after he eats too many crabs, the Personification of Light Pull Cord (the monster who Saitama beats after he lost his bad tooth) also turns into some sort of weird-ass monster after he shadowboxed with a pull cord shadow for so long."

Thus, I'm inclined to believe the in-universe limitation breaking theory."

OnePunchMan,3d081h,Heatstrike,34,Sun Jul 12 12:06:37 2015 UTC,His ability is smashing shit with his metal bat.
OnePunchMan,3d081h,WickeDanneh,14,Sun Jul 12 13:17:17 2015 UTC,Yes but I want to know how good he can smash shit with his metal bat.
OnePunchMan,3d081h,Heatstrike,16,Sun Jul 12 13:38:59 2015 UTC,"He can smash shit so hard, it becomes smashed².  Didnt ONE say that Metal Bat wasnt just boasting when he said he could take down a level Dragon being ?"
OnePunchMan,3d081h,MiggyMcMiggy,3,Sun Jul 12 14:04:09 2015 UTC,Yeah. IIRC he said things would end up differently if he was there to fight black sperm and all those other monsters.
OnePunchMan,3d081h,Mekbop,0,Mon Jul 13 17:00:47 2015 UTC,Tbh most of the S heroes seem to have big egos it's entirely possible that he as a character thinks he's better than the others but is actually not
OnePunchMan,3d081h,exzon,3,Thu Jul 16 09:41:11 2015 UTC,No it isn't Metal Bat who said this. It was ONE.

OnePunchMan,3d081h,DuckMeYellow,3,Sun Jul 12 16:54:46 2015 UTC,So it seems that Garou doesnt remember Saitma
OnePunchMan,3d081h,staring-at-the-sun,2,Mon Jul 13 04:50:18 2015 UTC,How did you infer that from this Chapter?
OnePunchMan,3d081h,FettPrime,5,Mon Jul 13 12:21:24 2015 UTC,Well in the last chapter Garou said his memory was fuzzy. Also Garou is trying to become the strongest monster so he should at least be curious of who it was that could knock him out. But instead it shows him going after King who is an S-rank.
OnePunchMan,3d081h,staring-at-the-sun,5,Mon Jul 13 15:16:58 2015 UTC,"Well he knocked him out, which caused a memory loss. That's the case in the ONE version anyway."

OnePunchMan,3clyrb,emojiiboy,25,Wed Jul 8 23:05:43 2015 UTC,"""One of the first things that I thought about Saitama is dang, this guy needs to get his head out of his ass. He could be the greatest hero that ever lived. He could literally fight ALL OF THE CRIME at once""   Why would he do that? It's just a hobby for him and he isn't obliged to do shit.    ""He could have stopped the meteor from causing so much damage if he had gotten there like a minute earlier when it was  much higher in the sky, so that the little pieces burned up in the atmosphere. He could have stopped so many people from getting hurt of dying""   He could've also not done anything and everyone would've been dead. But thanks to him not a single person died there.   ""He is such a complete 180 from what he used to be. He used to be a badass, even though he was weak.""   Saitama didn't change one bit from when he was a kid. He was always oblivious and careless. Wanting your money back or helping a little child not to get killed doesn't require a very heroic character. It's basic human nature. You also assume that Saitama takes the whole hero thing as seriously as the others when it's just a hobby for him, it always was.   ""Maybe that's why his closest friends are Genos, and Bang. Genos is what Saitama used to be: an eager, overzealous fighter with one goal: to be a hero. (Genos is a lot more chill now that he's being hanging with OPMan, but in the beginning he was really hyper)""   Neither Genos nor Bang are his closest friends. They invited themselves into his life and he, being the Saitama we know, doesn't really mind. King is currently his best friend because he has cool games.   The thing Saitama cares about the most isn't becoming a hero or saving as many people as possible but to do the shit he likes."
OnePunchMan,3clyrb,Buttfart-Mangina,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:13:07 2015 UTC,With great power comes great responsibility   Perhaps never more relevant than now.
OnePunchMan,3clyrb,robcap,0,Thu Jul 9 16:56:19 2015 UTC,"Whew, thanks for the reply. I like to post extreme rants sometimes to be completely honest with strangers and then have them slapped back into my face. That's not sarcasm, I really believe that. It's kind of therapeutic to to see both sides of an argument.  Anyway, I know he isn't obliged to do anything. I also know that he doesn't take it seriously. But that's the whole point of my rant. I do love Saitama as the person that he is, but I know that he could just be so much more. He is lazy af and pretty careless, and come on if you have the power to one shot that Earth Destroying Space ship why are you wasting time looking around it when its about to kill more people. Idk, when he has that much power and doesn't use it as much as he could when the world clearly needs him, his laziness kind of shifts to dickishness.  But also, I wanna open this up about his best friend being King. Why do you think the author did this? Is King a foil or a complement to OPMan, or both? On the surface and symbolically, why is King OPMan's best friend?"
OnePunchMan,3clyrb,Alterist,7,Thu Jul 9 00:36:39 2015 UTC,"Well clearly this is not the manga for you. OPM does it perfectly IMO. I am sure a lot of other people think that too, it has its own subreddit.  I feel like you came at this a bit naively. There is more than one type of person. Not everyone cares for being 'popular', most charitable, etc..."
OnePunchMan,3clyrb,lolgjayha,-1,Thu Jul 9 10:25:47 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna keep reading it (for the laffs), I think I just needed a wakeup call to myself because I related so well to Saitama (I'm lazy af) that I started to look up to him. He's easy to get lulled into looking up to him, though. He is selfless, nice to everyone, and is relaxed and carefree, he doesn't get caught up in the hype of popularity, and he is strong as HELL. But he isn't a good role model at all, which is where (I am embarrassed to say) I got confused."
OnePunchMan,3clyrb,DuckMeYellow,2,Thu Jul 9 22:38:56 2015 UTC,"I like Saitama more this way cause he doesn't give a fuck, and also I can relate to him, I'm pretty much Saitama but without the op-ness cause I'm just as lazy and read manga all day when I can be doing something better with my life. And if I somehow got op powers like Saitama I doubt I'll try hard and go monster hunting 24/7 cause to be honest that seems like a lot of work especially for a lazy fuck like me."
OnePunchMan,3clyrb,Borjangly,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:08:56 2015 UTC,"the thing is I'm the exact same way, and I'm sure Saitama speaks to all of us people on the internet because we can relate to him so much. I don't want him to change, because I do think that his character is funny to read about. But at the same time I look at myself and I'm like ""fuck if i got unlimited power would I really do the same thing?"" I hope not, but sitting here I am thinking that I wouldn't really care that much and still be a bum. Especially if i got my powers through minimal training."
OnePunchMan,3clyrb,DuckMeYellow,24,Thu Jul 9 22:27:04 2015 UTC,"When Saitama was training he felt the thrill and adrenaline in each fight. His life was on the line constantly but he kept fighting.   Now it's easy. He feels nothing from most fights, the only ones that have caused him to get serious so far in Murata's redrawn is Boros, but he had to punch an attack that destroys planets   Saitama still cares about people (showcased in the police sidestory) and he is one of the most selfless hero's there is. You have to remember he was fighting monsters as a hobby until Genos showed up. He's late because it's his nature. He's a lazy, easily distracted guy who is atrocious with directions.   Saitama has shown us he has super reflexes and speed from his encounters with Speed of Sound, Sonic (lol) but he's never ran anywhere at this speed. Maybe he can't or just won't, no explanation really.  Also he put his life on the line for 200yen because he's stingy and didn't want to lose his money, not because he is the best hero ever.   Tldr: Saitama hasn't changed as a person, he just doesn't feel the same thrill from fighting."
OnePunchMan,3clyrb,112lion,3,Wed Jul 8 23:44:20 2015 UTC,"Ah true for the speed part. He might be quick in close quarters, but that doesn't mean that he can run fast.   And yeah, he is a selfless hero when he gets to the scene. I loved the police sidestory, thanks for reminding me of that.  Idk, I like the fact that he is selfless, but he only does it when he's already there. As in, he won't go out of his way to be selfless, only when it presents itself, if that makes sense."
OnePunchMan,3clyrb,Enayet,9,Thu Jul 9 00:30:28 2015 UTC,"Now it's easy. He feels nothing from most fights, the only ones that have caused him to get serious so far in Murata's redrawn is Boros, but he had to punch an attack that destroys planets   He runs very quickly. In one of the special chapters (the one with the lunch on a roof), he loses grip on a piece of salmon. Then he runs down the wall and grabs it before it hits the ground then runs back up."
OnePunchMan,3clyrb,112lion,5,Fri Jul 10 04:49:32 2015 UTC,"He isn't the ideal hero. Strong but lazy. He also looks very unassuming. No one believed he really dealt with the Seaking, rather thinking he killed an extremely weakened monster."
OnePunchMan,3clyrb,lolgjayha,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:36:56 2015 UTC,"true, which what makes him interesting. Don't get me wrong, I think he has a very unique and interesting flaw, and I don't want to see him change for a while. But it's such a good flaw to evoke this emotion in me. I mean, what other flaw could he have that would make the most powerful man in the world also the most incompetent without going full idiot (which would actually probably make him more dangerous)."

My understanding is that, to Saitama, becoming a hero is more a means to an end to his goal of fighting powerful opponents. He's not looking to stop crime as much as he is out to fight the bad guys. You're right that he definitely needs better discipline, but it may be that he's too concerned with physical strength for him to noticed that his mental and emotional state is pretty terrible."

OnePunchMan,3cg25g,formlessfish,6,Tue Jul 7 17:12:12 2015 UTC,"As we can assume by images like this the continents of the planet are not in a pangea-esque form, instead there are continents and most likely as you asked, different countries. Albeit humanity and japanese style cultural aspects exist in the OPM Manga, that is actually most likely because the creators are both japanese.  I assume that there is actually no ""Japan"" or ""America"" (I can be wrong, I'm not delving too deep on this) but instead there are countries specific to each continent, not split up continents like in our world.  The reason for this theory is due to the cities being labeled things such as ""A-City, B-City, Etc.""   From this logic I assume that there would at absolute minimum 2 countries that we know of."
OnePunchMan,3cg25g,menonono,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:15:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with you mostly, but I think there's a ""Japan"" and an ""America"" but not in the same way. I think the creators just don't wanna say specific names for the citys. I think that just 'cause when the hero association elite appears they talk about their country so maybe this kind of things only happend in Japan due to the continues references to pop culture about superheroes cliche and monsters like Godzila and stuff.

On the other hand, it could mean that, since there are VAs for characters who have very few lines, we migh get some extra background or info on them.  I just hope they follow Muratas version to the line and go at least to Boros arc."

OnePunchMan,3ccdg7,DreaHun,2,Tue Jul 7 10:02:07 2015 UTC,Wow that mug is pretty sweet. But kind of a steretypical big organization design though...
OnePunchMan,3ccdg7,Bunny_Pope,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:38:14 2015 UTC,Exactly!  That's the point with the mug!
OnePunchMan,3ccdg7,Bunny_Pope,2,Tue Jul 7 17:59:43 2015 UTC,What do you mean when you say that zombieman is introduced in chapter 29? I thought both versions where well past that. I only read the redrawn version if that helps.
OnePunchMan,3ccdg7,Spore124,2,Wed Jul 8 19:08:59 2015 UTC,It says on his MAL page   Debut: Chapter 29
OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,Haposhi,24,Sun Jul 5 11:47:57 2015 UTC,"Excuse me, I'd like this wig for parties."
OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,banterturtle,2,Sun Jul 5 15:17:32 2015 UTC,Saitama a freak like that.
OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,Heatstrike,18,Tue Jul 7 09:50:51 2015 UTC,"It's scary that Saitama hits a ""random mugger"" hard enough to instantly K.O. Garou. That would've made paste out of any normal mugger."
OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,The11025,47,Sun Jul 5 15:40:38 2015 UTC,He probably chose the force in response to how hard Garou just hit him.
OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,Raoh90,4,Sun Jul 5 15:51:25 2015 UTC,my thoughts too
OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,angelicable,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:12:35 2015 UTC,Garou's strike probably hurt like a fly just landed on his shoulder though
OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,icycoldlava,14,Wed Jul 8 17:04:32 2015 UTC,"im guessing he mightve figured he'd be able to take the hit considering he was able to drive saitama into the ground, which i guess saitama would see as ""slightly strong"" lol"
OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,lonesomegalaxy,11,Sun Jul 5 18:17:38 2015 UTC,I fucking love Saitama.
OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,CrunchyBum,8,Sun Jul 5 17:17:48 2015 UTC,Loved this chapter.

OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,Miserygut,5,Sun Jul 5 13:53:02 2015 UTC,I think he likes it.
OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,MegaCake,4,Mon Jul 6 20:24:48 2015 UTC,I was really worried about this arc until this chapter. Though I did also like the bananas.
OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,Lancemate_Memory,4,Mon Jul 6 15:13:27 2015 UTC,"http://bato.to/read/_/330521/onepunch-man_ch50_by_nerieru-scans/8  THIS   this image illustrates the reason i love this manga so much.  There's just something about The highly detailed drawing, the intense action, and everything that Murata puts into the picture, while leaving Saitama's face in ONE's style, with his eyebrows just so, and that look on his face  that just says:  ""oh god no....Garou has made a ~horrible~ mistake"""
OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,MiggyMcMiggy,7,Wed Jul 8 20:04:59 2015 UTC,REKT
OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,mythiii,3,Sun Jul 5 16:12:53 2015 UTC,"I like how they kept Saitamas face cartoony even with the wig on.   I was half expecting a handsome version, like in his origin story, or when he gets serious."
OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,allubros,2,Sun Jul 5 22:12:34 2015 UTC,lolololol that wig panel
OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,Ars0,2,Sun Jul 5 21:36:23 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain me why the chapters are such a mess? I mean this chapter is the chapter 74 form the original website, why?"
OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,Heatstrike,11,Sun Jul 5 13:29:35 2015 UTC,"The whole chapter doesn't come out at once. Usually in parts. That's where the 41.1 (41 part 1), 41.2 (41 part 2), etc comes from.   For whatever reason, the website counts each addition as a separate chapter. Maybe they're not able to mark it as .1 or .2 or whatever."
OnePunchMan,3c6tlj,icycoldlava,2,Sun Jul 5 14:29:29 2015 UTC,I think because the actual overall site releases chapters and smaller segments? At least that's what I think lol

OnePunchMan,3c99em,toticky,3,Mon Jul 6 02:21:20 2015 UTC,dang. ok thanks
OnePunchMan,3c99em,menonono,4,Mon Jul 6 02:22:15 2015 UTC,"He releases them randomly, but it's normally within a 3 month time span, truly you should expect a chapter about once every 2 months as an average."
OnePunchMan,3c99em,MegaCake,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:54:33 2015 UTC,Where are these releases posted? Why is he not in Jump or something? This is easily one of my favorite manga. Surely it would survive in a weekly or monthly official setting if it isn't already.
OnePunchMan,3c99em,menonono,4,Mon Jul 6 15:12:32 2015 UTC,"He posts the newest versions on his official website, and he does OPM as a hobby, so he didn't want to sign up with something that would stop him from doing OPM as a hobby."
OnePunchMan,3c99em,xtkbilly,2,Mon Jul 6 15:30:41 2015 UTC,"His other Manga is his main Manga: Mob Psycho 100. It's pretty good, though not nearly as interesting as OPM, IMO."

OnePunchMan,3c1a70,Breesive,5,Sat Jul 4 11:51:42 2015 UTC,I feel like that will probably still happen. It's too funny to skip. Murata just seems to want to build them up more.
OnePunchMan,3c1a70,dementedfreakazoid,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:56:19 2015 UTC,"I really hope to God that he does put that scene lmao. That would be awesome, like saitama and Garou keep running into eachother not remembering each other at all and SAITAMA just keeps beating his ass every time they see each other up until the final showdown lol. That'd show the progressive gap in power. I hope the golden ball and spring mustache fight didn't completely replace everything between death Gatling and the dine and dash scene. I really wanna see that ""hey, what the fuck?! Aren't you here to stop me?? What's your hero name?!"" Remade"
OnePunchMan,3c1a70,Auxarius,2,Sat Jul 4 23:21:07 2015 UTC,"Damn, so there's no way Garou is forgetting Saitama now, the man just play chopped him in the neck and knocked his ass out."
OnePunchMan,3c1a70,Eaglefield,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:19:32 2015 UTC,it sounds like he's having a hard time remembering what or who happened lol
OnePunchMan,3c1a70,tickler1212,2,Fri Jul 3 22:43:35 2015 UTC,"Oh wow you're right, that's exactly the case lol.

OnePunchMan,3c1a70,LarsMasters,2,Sat Jul 4 01:31:09 2015 UTC,They actually meet this early?! I hope Murata didn't completely scrap that dine and dash scene. I really love that.

OnePunchMan,3bzg0u,MIllawls,8,Fri Jul 3 11:50:48 2015 UTC,I think the best way to end it would be with the Boros arc. It would show just how truly powerful saitama is and also bring closure. There's now way it can go to the Garou arc it just started.
OnePunchMan,3bzg0u,Enayet,2,Fri Jul 3 18:31:29 2015 UTC,there's still the original source material to use for that
OnePunchMan,3bzg0u,thethor1231,4,Fri Jul 3 18:41:41 2015 UTC,"Still, thats WAAAAAYYYYYY to much to cover"

OnePunchMan,3bzg0u,thethor1231,3,Sat Jul 4 09:46:13 2015 UTC,Do any of u know when the anime airs?
OnePunchMan,3bzg0u,toonsilver74,2,Fri Jul 3 18:11:01 2015 UTC,October 2015  Date unknown.  You're welcome friend.
OnePunchMan,3bzg0u,igorcl,2,Fri Jul 3 18:43:18 2015 UTC,I really hope we can get everything from the begin until Garou's saga
OnePunchMan,3bzg0u,Forestor,5,Fri Jul 3 15:27:36 2015 UTC,I would like it if the included the bonus chapters.  Like the one at the police station.
OnePunchMan,3bzg0u,igorcl,2,Fri Jul 3 16:42:30 2015 UTC,"since the extras are already ""fillers"", I hope we can get some extra content for the other characters. Maybe some mini stories at the begin  or at the end of the episode"
OnePunchMan,3c0n07,toonsilver74,2,Fri Jul 3 18:06:31 2015 UTC,"Yes it is, The Murata version normally releases on thursdays once every two weeks, but the ONE version releases sporadically with no real indication of when new chapters will be released.  And I recommend Bato.to for reading OPM."
OnePunchMan,3c0n07,menonono,3,Fri Jul 3 18:30:36 2015 UTC,"alternatively, read it on mangahere too because people post pretty funny tsukkomis all over the pages lol. Bato.to definitely usually gets it faster though"

OnePunchMan,3c0n07,Alogical-Anodyne,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:34:19 2015 UTC,What's the story behind the series? Like how come the original is so crudely drawn?
OnePunchMan,3c0n07,Enayet,2,Thu Jul 9 03:33:28 2015 UTC,"The original author made a just for fun manga as a side project and posted it online. It got alot of popularity so he continued to do the series. The original author draws bad on purpose btw.   The original author then got in contact with another author called ONE who said he wanted to completely redraw the series. Thus they're two versions, the original manga, and the redrawn manga."
OnePunchMan,3c0n07,multiusedrone,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:14:36 2015 UTC,You've got it backwards. ONE is the original webcomic author. Yusuke Murata of Eyeshield 21 is the mangaka doing the redrawn manga.

OnePunchMan,3bxwbg,ag487,8,Fri Jul 3 01:44:16 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware that Viz had streaming on their site, but at least it's on Daisuki. Used that to watch Tsukimonogatari on New Years, and it wasn't too shabby, IIRC. Anyone know if one is certainly better than the other?  (Would have liked Crunchyroll, since that's the only current stream I pay for, but free on Daisuki is good too.)"
OnePunchMan,3bxwbg,xtkbilly,2,Fri Jul 3 03:06:41 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Crunchyroll will announce it too. The anime I was waiting for most this season was Shokugeki no Soma, and they didn't announce that they were going to carry it until a couple hours before it was scheduled departure premiere."

OnePunchMan,3bau2q,theothersophie,5,Sun Jun 28 02:36:04 2015 UTC,I never thought i'd be able to think of a t-rex as cute and fluffy

Given how slowly ONE is putting out chapters, it's obvious the series is gonna run into a wall at some point, where a hiatus or large filler would be in order. I'd rather get some small filler along the way, especially when it's lovely fight scenes. One thing I dislike is Garou whipping out the Rock-Smashing Water Stream Fist this early."

OnePunchMan,3b7vrh,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:15:00 2015 UTC,"Tankōbon:       A tankōbon (単行本 ?, ""independent/standalone book"") is the Japanese term for a book that is complete in itself and is not part of a series or corpus (similar to a monograph), though in modern Japan it is most often used in reference to individual volumes of a single manga, as opposed to magazines (雑誌, zasshi ?), which feature multiple series.   It can be used for a novel, a nonfiction work, an economics textbook, a book of beauty tips, a book presenting a coherent set of photographs, an exhibition catalogue that samples earlier books, and so forth in a hardcover format. It is more specific than plain hon, which encompasses such books but also one or more issues of a periodical, one or more volumes (or the whole set) of an encyclopedia, etc.    Image i     Relevant: George Akiyama | List of Claymore chapters | Kamen Rider Spirits | Masami Yuki   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,rightyguitarist,28,Thu Jun 25 19:46:08 2015 UTC,Limitless
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,IamRem,7,Thu Jun 25 20:15:50 2015 UTC,This is the right answer. Saitama broke his limiters. His power level is infinity.
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,Heatstrike,2,Fri Jun 26 06:24:03 2015 UTC,equivocation fallacy at its finest.
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,ryechu,19,Sat Jun 27 23:27:06 2015 UTC,"200 at most? no way in hell. he got kicked TO THE MOON AND JUMPED BACK WITHOUT HARM OR EFFORT. AND punched away a planet-buster attack, once again with no effort or harm. I don't think you could even put numbers on his powerlevel"
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,icycoldlava,0,Thu Jun 25 19:57:05 2015 UTC,"Mate, Frieza did that with zero effort. Except the attack he deflected would have destroyed the planet, whereas Boros only claimed to wipe the life off it or something."
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,robcap,3,Sun Jun 28 17:47:41 2015 UTC,"I mean, life would be wiped because the planet would be destroyed lol. Even if Boros' attack was meant to destroy the surface of a planet rather than break the planet apart, that's  probably because Boro's attack and Frieza's attack are different in nature. it isn't Frieza's attack itself that destroys the planet, it's the fact that it burrows into the planet and destroys the core. They even explain it in the anime and probably the manga too. Boros' attack was probably aimed in such a way that he intentionally wanted to graze the planet's surface and char it with his attack rather than blow the whole thing apart by shooting down directly.  Think of Vegeta's big bang attack too for instance. it undoubtably had more than enough power to destroy the planet many times over, but the way Vegeta aimed it just destroyed a landscape while the rest shot off into space"
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,icycoldlava,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:28:30 2015 UTC,The way Boros phrased it made it sound like it was not capable of destroying a planet.
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,robcap,2,Tue Jun 30 17:56:59 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you're going by how he phrased it, then you might as well say it was capable of destroying a planet since it's called ""planet-buster roar cannon"" lol. plus, read my post again, i think that offers an explanation of why it'd wipe out the surface rather than tear the planet apart. Let alone I'm sure Boros has no intention of literally tearing apart a planet he's still on lol  About the final flash thing, if by some shocking happenstance you're not familiar with it, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA-WIynIzzs , this attack should be thousands of times stronger than the minimum planet busters from earlier in the series, and yet because of how he aimed it it grazed the earth's surface and shot off into space"
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,icycoldlava,18,Wed Jul 1 15:47:18 2015 UTC,200? A guy who managed to punch away a beam that was capable of destroying earth and you rate him at 200? You seriously think Yamcha is stronger than OPman? Even Chi Chi has 300 power level!!!  He's invincible and powerful to such a degree that no amount of common sense applies to him any more. Even SS Vegito would take damage from being hit into the moon.  What are you? Some kind of judging nazi?
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,umiman,-11,Thu Jun 25 20:16:22 2015 UTC,"It only takes a PL of 100 to destroy a planet, so knocking off a beam that does that isn't impressive. Also yamcha got a PL of 1209 after training for 2 years with a God, and before that trained with the strongest human master in the world. Also chi chi has a PL of around 70"
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,umiman,13,Thu Jun 25 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"So you somehow think Yamcha, a guy who dies just by getting hugged, is more than six times stronger than OPman?"
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,Raoh90,4,Thu Jun 25 20:49:20 2015 UTC,the fact that you have a high power level doesnt mean that your body will be able to destroy a huge meteorite. Most humans on dbz would get crushed and kill if they dont fire an energy projection to destroy it. OPM pummels it like it was nothing.
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,robcap,0,Fri Jun 26 05:20:07 2015 UTC,"Er, yeah, it does actually. People who swat away energy blasts are still hurt when punched."
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,robcap,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:45:57 2015 UTC,"As someone who could comfortably destroy a planet, he is stronger than anything Saitama has been shown to do."
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,icycoldlava,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:46:30 2015 UTC,"ok, everybody in dbz gets knocked into mountains and shit and take heavy damage. Saitama got kicked out of earth's atmosphere smack dab onto the moon's surface without batting an eye. something about your calculations aren't adding up lol"
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,robcap,2,Tue Jun 30 17:31:29 2015 UTC,"Why would it be the mountain doing the damage, and not the punch? DBZ guys who shrug off planet busting attacks are later beaten to near death with fists."
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,Iwarov,11,Tue Jun 30 17:58:14 2015 UTC,"When it comes to writing, this question was basically answered by ONE already, Saitama's strenght is infinite, speed is infinite and durability is infinite. Lord boros was supposed to be ""DBZ representative"" as opm is all about poking fun at this genre of manga, and yea, he dead."
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,derpwadmcstuffykins,8,Thu Jun 25 23:12:20 2015 UTC,"inb4 over 9000  But for real, I'd say much more than 200"
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,Boofan01,7,Thu Jun 25 20:09:04 2015 UTC,It's a gag manga. Saitama's power level is infinite simply based around the core of the series is that he's so fucking OP and doesn't give a shit. So 200? Nah.
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,aidsmann,5,Thu Jun 25 22:14:52 2015 UTC,the joke of the series is that he can beat everything and everyone with one punch   that includes all dragonball or whatever characters so his powerlevel is infinite
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,Apothecary3,5,Thu Jun 25 21:11:48 2015 UTC,Power levels are just a measure of Ki remember. That is why they vary. Saitama doesn't use Ki so he would have an average power level.
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,icycoldlava,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:56:23 2015 UTC,i don't think ki is necessarily a prerequisite. I think the old human warrior olibu had a really high power level
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,TheOneWithALongName,3,Tue Jun 30 17:33:05 2015 UTC,"Same as Hulks I suppose. There is no limit.  Now, what would happend if Saitama meet someone with invulnerability?"
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,lolgjayha,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:06:09 2015 UTC,1 divided by 0
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,giedonas,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:31:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know, but it's definitely a super serious power level."
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,robcap,0,Tue Jun 30 17:49:52 2015 UTC,"Based on what he's shown, somewhere between first appearance Vegeta and the Ginyu force."
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,menonono,-2,Sun Jun 28 17:45:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like I should avoid this thread due to simple favoritism and lack of knowledge, but...  Saitama should be somewhere around Frieza level.  I understand that you guys will say ""But menonono, Saitama never puts any effort into his attacks, and he punched away a planet busting attack!""  Understandably you would say that, because half of that is most likely true. Saitama never seems to put actual effort into his fighting, thus ending them in 1 punch, but most people (Including myself) believe Boros was actually unable to do a real planet busting attack (He might have been able to, I don't know) but the major factor here is that no character in OPM has, or will ever be able to push Saitama to his limits, that's what he's supposed to do because of what his manga makes him.  If you HAD to put a power level on Saitama, I would say around 1-2 million, but that's where I would say it stops."
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,Higgert,5,Fri Jun 26 00:54:16 2015 UTC,Why do people believe that? The mere blocked attack split clouds halfway across the world.
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,robcap,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:11:24 2015 UTC,"Clouds... Notoriously difficult to move, those."
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,icycoldlava,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:48:16 2015 UTC,"i mean considering people in DBZ get KO'd from much less, i'd say splitting the atmosphere with the pressure of your punch against a planet-destroying opposing force is pretty impressive lol. and in the end even boros said he never showed any effort"
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,robcap,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:34:56 2015 UTC,"No, Boros said he wasn't giving his all. That punch however, was 'serious'.  I'd like you to show me someone in DBZ getting KO'd from less. Planet destroying is old news by the time they get to namek, and they continue fighting with more and more powerful enemies."
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,icycoldlava,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:59:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, planet destroying is old news. But there are plenty of attacks they release in the series that, just by the logic that they're stronger than previous planet busters alone, should destroy the planet whenever it hits something. and yet, a lot of their blasts just form huge craters (probably around as big as the huge chunk of land saitama casually hurls into the air) or destroy landscapes. And while his punch came from his ""serious series,"" that doesn't actually mean he put any effort into the punch, he just regarded a planet-destroying attack as serious enough to punch slightly harder than usual. When you see all the serious series attacks used later way later on in this arc, you can tell that they're all done with literally no effort besides the fact that he took the time to name them.   as for the example, here's super vegeta getting dispatched by a slap that only sent him sliding on the ground with no craters. probably wouldn't take a hit to the moon that well https://youtu.be/qKYCi6SoOsM?t=364"
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,robcap,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:52:18 2015 UTC,"DBZ isn't exactly consistent with its portrayal of power, but Vegeta was slapped by freaking Cell. You can be damn sure he was slapped a lot harder than Saitama will ever achieve."
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,icycoldlava,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:36:57 2015 UTC,"yeah, it's cell, but you can't tell me that slap was more powerful than a kick that sends someone all the way to the moon lol"
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,Man_gola,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:20:03 2015 UTC,Saitama didn't really touch him but the shear force of the punch created something (Wind I'm assuming) to kill a guy who can regenerate his body back and blow away clouds across the world.
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,menonono,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:18:24 2015 UTC,"It didn't show that in One's version, that was really just to emphasize how powerful of a punch Saitama just threw.  Now here's a thing you should know: Frieza's first form had a power level of 530,000, at this point he was a casual planet buster, as in, he flicked his finger and blew up a planet.  Now lets think about this: Frieza's SECOND form had a power level of 1,000,000, He literally blew up a part of the world by opening his hand.  It's atrocious how people refuse to have simple discussions, instead they just downvote people that they disagree with."
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,lolgjayha,2,Fri Jun 26 16:11:11 2015 UTC,"Why does it matter if it didn't show in one's version, you make it sound like Murata's version doesn't matter, I mean it isn't false if it didn't apear in the original.  Anyways without being biased here, I think his power level is way higher because you came to the conclusion that his power level was 1-2mil based off of all his battles and feats but if you think about it, this manga is about Saitama being the strongest so it would only make sense that as the manga gets longer and longer the stronger the enemy will get and the stronger Saitama will looks. So what I'm getting at is for now we know he's capabale of reaching 1-2mil but we just don't know how strong he can get so his power level is limitless for now."
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,menonono,2,Sat Jun 27 02:58:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  People throw around saying he's super powerful and stuff, but when he's judged by feats he doesn't come close to dbz characters.  The main reason I even got involved in this is to see how people react to being opposed in opinions in this sub. I understand that saitama is infinite strength super God, but they shouldn't downvote people due to them having differing opinions, I try to say what he appears to be via feats and people downvote without commenting, it's gross and saddening.  Opm is easily my favorite manga ever and I can't wait for the anime, but I hate favoritism, and I hate the idea of people refusing to discuss differing opinions.  Also is the murata version the pure version or is it a special version that's a re-telling? Is the one version the canon version, or is the murata version the proper one?"
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,lolgjayha,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:51:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Saitama isn't as strong as dbz characters because the dbz series completed long time ago and so we see the limits or close to it what the characters can do. While on the other hand opm isn't at all close to finishing so you don't know how huge Saitama's true power is. If you reverse the situation so opm is now completed while dbz is still at goku vs vegeta ape arc everyone would think goku wouldn't even compare to Saitama. So you can't honestly compare the two until both series is finished and with db super coming out who knows will be stronger.   And regards to Murata vs One's version, I like to think of One's version more like  a draft and Murata's version a final product, even though it's based off of One's version, Murata can still add stuff to it to make even better.   Also to be honest I'm one of those guys that loves to show favouritism towards this manga because out of the shit tons of mangas I read, this is my number 1, it's even the number 1 on my anime list (lol love this manga). But I think blindly calling people stupid just because they don't like the manga or if they have a different opinion is retarded. Even though I think this is the greatest manga ever doesn't mean I don't see the flaw or that everyone should love it. Everyone has different preferences and haters gonna hate."
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,robcap,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:23:05 2015 UTC,I think that's too high to be honest.
OnePunchMan,3b3yj2,Auxarius,0,Sun Jun 28 17:44:20 2015 UTC,Do not forget that Saitama has the power of God. derp  So limitless!!!

OnePunchMan,3aefau,Goodfornothing123,16,Fri Jun 19 13:25:01 2015 UTC,So long as whoever is playing Saitama wins with one punch.
OnePunchMan,3aefau,damage3245,8,Fri Jun 19 14:17:40 2015 UTC,Is better to put Saitama with Hair then he turn into bald when he uses a serious attack.
OnePunchMan,3aefau,Auxarius,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:58:00 2015 UTC,"The game would have Mortal Kombat ""fatalities"", and him losing his hair for one of his serious moves would be one of Saitama's. There would be different ones for each character of course. That's how I see it."
OnePunchMan,3aefau,Average_Jon,6,Mon Jun 22 04:01:07 2015 UTC,No. The point of the story is to hype up battles as much as possible so they can be dealt with in one punch. Translating that to a game would mean avoiding gameplay for as long as possible every time.
OnePunchMan,3aefau,piclemaniscool,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:59:49 2015 UTC,"then it would be game as bad as you can go, but question here, why would you play as saitama or any already known hero, in a world filled with most ridiculous heroes, registered or not, criminals and monsters with prebuild lore friendly leaderboards? Actually world of opm gives alot of good setups for good game. The thing is game would be created balanced, and being overpowered is serious feature of opm characters."
OnePunchMan,3aefau,Iwarov,7,Fri Jun 19 21:50:15 2015 UTC,"Here's the plan: You play as a new Hero with interesting powers, meet a wide array of interesting characters some of whom come straight from the manga, and go through a dramatic and deep story with an incredibly good character as the villain. It all builds up to the final fight with him, when suddenly Saitama jumps in and beats him in one punch for the ultimate anticlimax."

OPM has a really diverse cast of characters that would translate well to the fighting genre.  Of course, Saitama must be invincible and can KO every other character in one punch. Mirror matches disabled for him."
OnePunchMan,3aefau,Secret_Wizard,2,Sun Jun 21 01:07:02 2015 UTC,"I'd rather they make an old school style 2d sprite-based JRPG, like FF6 or earlier. Your party eventually has a boss encounter with Saitama, and every attack on him results in either ""Miss"" or ""0"", while every attack on you is a ""9999"" oneshot kill.  At the end of the game, you have a fully animated ending where you find that the whole ""game"" was in fact a simulation made by Genos based on his strategic analyses, and you are actually ""playing"" as Saitama and King, who found the ""game"" lying around the apartment and decided to play it without permission. Hilarity ensues."

OnePunchMan,3aefau,Mochachocakon,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:07:06 2015 UTC,"I had the idea of a turn based rpg kinda of game, where you play as Saitama.  You have access to a wide variety of actions, and it works like a puzzle game where the objective is to go through a set of motions that'll let you hit the enemy without obliterating them in one shot.  So you'll have actions like ""focus on holding back"" that halves your damage, and can be stacking, but getting hit by an enemies 0 damage attacks with remove any focus you had.  Aim your hit, pick a location on the enemy, the part where they'll take the least critical damage.  Miss, intimidates or forces an opponents to move.  Prepare to swing, makes the opponent start blocking.  And you have to find the rhythm of those moments combined with the enemies action pattern to reach the point where you attack them."

OnePunchMan,3aefau,Metagen,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:01:53 2015 UTC,Only way I could really see that working is if you fought as other heroes (or team of heroes) to a time limit. Only after that time limit can you deploy Saitama.
OnePunchMan,3aefau,Heytunk,0,Sat Jun 20 13:05:43 2015 UTC,What if you played as Saitama on his 3 year squat X situps X pushups X 10kmrunning journey to becoming strong for a big portion of the game lol. Like Saitama with hair but still growing mad strong and shit. Maybe you could play different character's backstories.  I think it'd be pretty cool to play as Genos up to when he meets Saitama and past that. Or maybe when you play as saitama the load screen shows that your power is .000000000000??% so it lets you fight as him knowing hes giving no effort lolidk  I'm imagining Saitama VS Boros/Garou in a videogame in my mind and it looks amazing
OnePunchMan,3aefau,icycoldlava,-4,Sat Jun 20 16:08:14 2015 UTC,"I would do it ala Metroid style where he loses all of his powers and regains his hair after randomly running into a monster who unknowingly reverts whoever comes into contact with them to their weakest state power wise. Its then up to the player to fight monsters, search for the monster that did this too you and regain your strength as you travel to the different cities in the series and run into series characters all while completing your daily training and getting all of those good super market sales."
OnePunchMan,3a8gdy,icycoldlava,11,Thu Jun 18 01:31:41 2015 UTC,"I'm basing this off ONE's interview, where he said that the Sonic and Genos fight would end in a tie.   http://www.reddit.com/r/OnePunchMan/comments/30wmyq/can_anyone_confirm_if_this_is_true_im_sorry_if/   I reckon Sonic would probably have beaten Garou in the first gathering, considering that Garou took a few months (?) off to prepare to face S-Class heroes, and Genos/Sonic were already S-class level.  When Genos/Garou fought, they seemed sort of even, though Garou did commend Genos for his speed/power. They were interrupted too quickly to tell for me. Not sure at what point Garou could beat Sonic because he beat Pri-Pri in one hit in the MA arc, and then beat Superalloy pretty handily too."
OnePunchMan,3a8gdy,andaruu,6,Thu Jun 18 05:28:17 2015 UTC,"Sonic would have won had they met around the same time he fought with Genus.  It is strongly implied that Sonic would have beaten Genos with his clone technique when they fought, so lets put him around the same level.  Sonic would have beaten Garou easily at the ""World in trouble"" meeting - the power gap was too much, not to mention that in his fights with S opponents later on, Garou takes quite a few hits - that would not work as Sonic would cut him up - so basically power difference+bad match up = Garou losing easily.  I think Sonic had a chance all the way up to the beginning of the Darkshine fight, the jump in power during that one seems to put Garou solidly over Sonic at that point."

The original One Punch man is a webcomic that's usually badly drawn doodles since it's originally a gag comic. The original webcomic is waaayy further ahead in the story, thus where the spoilers are coming from. The redrawn manga has a few tweaks to the story too, like in the Saitama VS Boros fight, Saitama didn't originally get kicked to the moon. But in the redrawn, he was kicked to the moon and jumped back. Also you didn't find out people survived Garou's huntings until later on in the story of the original"

Remember when they were asking him about the crime in his city, and he said it was quiet or ok? He lives in a place with a lot of crime, so for him to say its ok shows he doesn't think the problem is that big of a deal. Kinda like Saitama just face rolling all those he came up against. Saitama is more interested in the next sale than talking about the big monster he defeated because it doesn't really matter to him.  Basically, I'm sure the two of them would get along and talk about stuff other than being heroes."

OnePunchMan,38y9js,Waffleman1230,13,Sun Jun 7 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"There hasn't been any official statements on episode/season count.  If I had to guess, due to the number of chapters out so far and the fact that the studio is Madhouse, it'll probably be 12 episode cours (seasons) at a time released every year/half-year or so.   OPM still has a lot of content to cover from the original webcomic, which itself is nowhere close to the end, (plus even more content as Murata is expanding/adding new scenes and including filler chapters here and there).   The manga is getting pretty popular and this will only increase greatly because of the anime, which will likely be one of the most watched/hyped shows for the Fall season. OPM will continue to become more popular and the franchise will make Madhouse a boatload of money so they'll definitely continue to adapt the manga."
OnePunchMan,38y9js,Heatstrike,7,Sun Jun 7 22:58:54 2015 UTC,Well Tatsumaki's VA has been announced so I guess it's safe to say that it will reach and end with the Boros Arc.
OnePunchMan,38y9js,dementedfreakazoid,5,Mon Jun 8 09:17:07 2015 UTC,"I personally believe the anime will reach the end of the first season either after The Sea King or Boros.  It will most likely be 12-15 episodes per season depending on filler and such.  We have no idea when opm will end, so I would say at least 10 seasons to begin with."

OnePunchMan,38y9js,MIllawls,6,Mon Jun 8 10:56:24 2015 UTC,"Doesn't work that way. The manga is the thing that makes Jump money and what the anime is based on. Anime is basically an advertisement campaign for manga, so they are not going to want Madhouse to adapt things which haven't yet happened in the manga.   Plus there are differences that the remake is doing, as well as smoothing things out from the webcomic.   Personally, I'd much rather them do multiple high quality short seasons. Either way, the fact is 1) the remake is going to continue 2) the remake is going to get adapted into more seasons as they are able to. So it's all good."

Only reason I say this is because I thought it was cool how up to a certain point in the original you think Garou's been legitimately slaughtering heroes mercilessly since you wouldn't see them again after he hunted them. But SpoilerHe's still badass, but it makes him seem slightly less srs threat than the ONE version. also i guess that one page with the raging demon thing kinda gives a peak at what a certain someone might look like by the end of the arc lol"
OnePunchMan,38ndlb,moralguardian,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:33:30 2015 UTC,"I don't mind it, the monster association in the original version explicitly stated that he hadn't ever killed anyone (which was why they were suspicious of him). Murata hasn't deviated from the source material much at all, except to put a little more meat on the story. Edit: Your spoiler landed right after I submitted this comment, my bad man."
OnePunchMan,38ndlb,notalottarum,2,Fri Jun 5 20:43:18 2015 UTC,"lol you're good man. that's what I mean though, I just kinda think it might've been better if he held off a little longer on showing everybody survived rather than literally right after the rekking  SPOILERS BELOW AVERT YOUR EYES SPOILERS BELOW AVERT YOUR EYES SPOILERS BELOW AVERT YOUR EYES SPOILERS BELOW AVERT YOUR EYES SPOILERS BELOW AVERT YOUR EYES SPOILERS BELOW AVERT YOUR EYES SPOILERS BELOW AVERT YOUR EYES SPOILERS BELOW AVERT YOUR EYES STOP READING STOP READING STOP READING  because up til Bug God said something about it, I thought Garou was actually killing since his initial ""massacre"" on account of the characters wouldn't reappear (especially the way he threw Death Gatling's huge gun back at him, I was thinking there's no way he didn't intend for him to die). I was thinking the monsters, like everybody else, initially thought he was actually killing people, and only learned otherwise after the fact. Also I figure that's why everybody at the end of the arc wanted him to die so badly, because they thought he was killing up til then. Garou protecting that kid and also being suddenly exposed as non-homicidal by the monsters after multiple brutal hero huntings just had me questioning if he was really as evil as he wants people to believe, and it added to the suspense or whatever i guess. like ""if he's not killing them, what exactly is he doing? Must learn more wow.""   But in the remake's case it's pretty much already confirmed he's just beating people up lol. and they don't even really look THAT bad afterwards, like they'll heal in no time. So when Bug God eventually says it it won't really be a suspenseful reveal about Garou's character IMO. Licenseless Rider's face of all things looks great considering the specific way Garou rekt him."
OnePunchMan,38ndlb,notalottarum,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:31:59 2015 UTC,"you know you are right, but murata might just be building it as saitama knows that no one has actually died, while everyone else has yet to be informed of that fact...or could have been informed otherwise(ie tank top hero's life was in great danger, and so he's in the hospital or something like that) so when the reveal with bug god comes about it isn't changing his character around or anything.  another things though is that in the original didn't bang and his brother face off against garou and go to saitama's place afterwards, they lived through it...so that's a thing/"
OnePunchMan,38ndlb,xtkbilly,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:16:40 2015 UTC,"yeah, but in that case the fight got interrupted by the monsters lol. But I guess that would explain why Saitama didn't really take Garou too seriously and thought he was soft since he knew he wasn't killing all along"

OnePunchMan,37kh55,Heatstrike,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:10:25 2015 UTC,"To be completely honest, I can't see Saitama being as strong of the end series DBZ characters. While yes, Saitama is super strong, he hasn't shown any actual abilities of, say, planet busting, or anything really along those lines. Boros, I would say, was around first form Frieza, most likely below Frieza first form actually, due to Frieza actually casually doing a planet busting move while Boros' ""Ultimate move"" was a ""planet busting attack"" while most actually speculate that it wouldn't have destroyed the planet. Since Saitama only uses physical attacks, and can't fly, I doubt Saitama could actually beat say, EoS Vegeta.  This is all just my opinion and I'd be glad to discuss this with anyone."
OnePunchMan,37kh55,imrepairmanman,2,Fri May 29 02:34:10 2015 UTC,"I agree. Almost all OPM characters are at most Saiyan saga level right now, forget planet-buster level like in the Frieza saga and beyond. DBZ is on another tier. Even back in DragonBall, bullets bounced off kid Goku and Roshi blew up the moon.  The only thing is that Saitama is a gag character and his power is basically the opponents +1. Based on what we've seen so far, I think Saitama could fit in as far as the Android saga, but we've only scratched the surface of what he can do so who knows."
OnePunchMan,37kh55,menonono,1 point,Fri May 29 06:16:45 2015 UTC,"Saitama, never once has been serious.  When he fought against boros, he held back.  When he fought against garou, he held back.  saitama has pretty much unlimited power, he has no limiter, and before you bring up garou lacking a limiter, consider this: saitama work hard to get where he is, garou took the easy road."
OnePunchMan,37kh55,icycoldlava,1 point,Fri May 29 10:00:48 2015 UTC,"But at the same time, even if Saitama held back against Boros and Garou, This scene here shows Gohan, after not training for a multitude of years, beating Frieza in his final form in 1 punch. I highly doubt Gohan used his full strength here, and he didn't even go Super Saiyan, let alone Super Saiyan 2.  Since Gohan was absolutely wreaked by buu at this point at Super Saiyan 2 level none the less, it's fairly obvious that Saitama, being unable to beat someone that isn't even at first form Frieza levels in 1 punch without being ""serious"" indicates that Saitama isn't nearly as strong as EoS Dragon Ball Z characters.  Edit: If you're gonna downvote me, at least give me a reason."
OnePunchMan,37kh55,Haziq47,2,Fri May 29 22:22:57 2015 UTC,"In Boros' case, I think the only reason he prolonged the fight was to give Boros the fight he's been yearning for before punishing him for destroying A-City as a courtesy since he knows those feels of being overpowered. By the end of the fight it's shown that had Saitama so chose to, he easily could have splattered full-power Boros with an effortless punch the whole time. In Garou's case, he's human lol. a human he never really took seriously to begin with and just viewed as someone making noise in his neighborhood. Plus he saw an individual who could survive his regular nonchalant monster-shattering blows, so naturally I'm sure he'd want to play around before he got bored and showed how big the gap between their power was. when Garou kept transforming and Saitama got tired of the fight, he was 1-hitting all of his new forms. but in neither in these instances did he ever really expend any actual effort"

OnePunchMan,37e2sz,lulzmort,3,Wed May 27 01:58:21 2015 UTC,"because murata stays as true as possible to the original by one we get a lot of chapters that are not that long so what viz does or at least what I think viz is doing is waiting till the length of the chapter is full, but we are getting a viz release of OPM next issue, it said at the back of the issue here"
OnePunchMan,37e2sz,astuteobservor,10,Wed May 27 02:11:13 2015 UTC,"the mangaka has his own schedule.  every chap usually have a date for the next chap.  the next chap might be early or late, it happens alot, so don't hold your breath.  but OPM is still 1000x better than said manga like berserk with the release timings."

OnePunchMan,37e2sz,astuteobservor,-1,Wed May 27 11:46:09 2015 UTC,I used something I care and like alot to use as a bar and as an example for OP.  trying to put the time between OPM chap releases into perspective/context.  that was all I was trying to do.

OnePunchMan,372edo,MiggyMcMiggy,11,Sun May 24 11:36:02 2015 UTC,I don't think Madhouse would do that
OnePunchMan,372edo,PaperPunch,6,Sun May 24 07:08:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Madhouse and not Studio Trigger.  Still, at least having one episode done in original ONE art style wouldn't be too bad."
OnePunchMan,372edo,WinterAyars,13,Sun May 24 10:07:30 2015 UTC,Maybe they'll do the episode previews in ONE's art style.
OnePunchMan,372edo,Dorfanorf,8,Mon May 25 06:33:28 2015 UTC,It's the same people who did the HunterxHunter anime. We're fine

OnePunchMan,36w3j4,112lion,3,Fri May 22 16:36:17 2015 UTC,"Minor Spoiler  ...  Garou's power comes from adapting to face an enemy. If he's in trouble, he analyzes what advantage the foe has over him, and adds his own advantage to his fighting style. ""More speed"", ""More technique"", etc.. Of course, he has his limits, but they're rapidly escalating limits.  ...  Major Spoilers  Major Spoilers  ...  Genos has him on the ropes for his fight, and Bang and Bomb are going to kick his ass, but he will come back and he will be stronger."
OnePunchMan,36w3j4,The11025,4,Fri May 22 17:10:16 2015 UTC,"Major Spoilers Below  Close this comment immediately if you do not want to know what happens in OPM before it gets drawn with good art.  .  .  .  So Garou is currently a human trying to become a monster. He has proven himself so far to be immensely strong and capable, as well as resilient. He can take S-Class attacks, and has also mastered S-Class fighting techniques, as proven by Tank Top Master for the former and his mastery of Bang's techniques for the latter.  In the coming chapters, Garou will become a high priority for the heroes to defeat, as have most enemies before Saitama meets them. However, he is the first so far to come into contact with an S-Class hero and fight them on equal terms. While Boros never got to fight with any S-Class heroes besides Saitama, he stated that he was strong enough to destroy the entire world with one of his techniques, which got reflected by Saitama's Serious Series technique.   Garou will continually become stronger and stronger the more enemies he fights, as he will push past his limits to reach the next level to overcome their level of strength. That being said, here's the major spoiler:  Garou is someone who appears to be like Saitama. He has surpassed the limits of an ordinary human, but doesn't appear to have any outstanding ability or power himself such as telekinesis or any obvious special qualities. He exhibits power he shouldn't ordinarily possess at all; unlike Saitama's sudden spike in power, Garou's arrives gradually. At an alarming rate, yes, but still its rise is noticeable. At the last shown seen of Garou before he disappears, he is well above Boros in terms of speed and power, giving even Saitama actual trouble during their battle. For whatever reason, his appearance also changes (but that is another matter)."
OnePunchMan,36w3j4,NeverEndingHope,10,Sat May 23 02:14:34 2015 UTC,"Just to nitpick - ONE has stated that Garou's final form and Boros were more or less equal. Garou definitely has a major speed advantage but Boros has his destructive final attack, and hitting Saitama to the moon probably gives him better striking power. In fact... That wasn't canon in the original, so remake Boros may actually be stronger (but I'm hoping Garou will get comparable new feats, along with the rest of the Monster's Association)."
OnePunchMan,36w3j4,xahhfink6,3,Sat May 23 04:29:03 2015 UTC,"Depending on how ""canon"" you consider Murata's half chapters, it seems Saitama power didn't arrive that fast, but probably over a couple months/years.    We've seen him getting visibly stronger, but with his hair still intact."

The original is at this very moment at chapter 100. There should be no further confusion here.    Now for the re-drawn version:  The chapters are often split up into little parts. Like you can see here. They are split up simply because Murata can not draw a whole chap at once, so it's split up into multiple releases.  Reference from the newest chapter.  The original japanese website counts by release, not by chapter. So they are at 68 and not at 46.  So far there also are 11 special chapters."

Selecting them to read them is kind of a pain in the butt, as you have to long select them and then dismiss the resultant menu, and even then, they disappear if you scroll. If I remember correctly, they appear when you mouse over them on desktop/laptop, so I guess that's not too dissimilar."

OnePunchMan,361kxg,MIllawls,4,Fri May 15 09:28:35 2015 UTC,The mods have already made a FAQ section regarding this.Check out the sidebar for FAQs.
OnePunchMan,361kxg,KushDealer,2,Fri May 15 09:51:02 2015 UTC,Redraw is at 71  Original is at 100
OnePunchMan,361kxg,IamRem,6,Fri May 15 10:12:48 2015 UTC,"Redraw is at 71   That depends on how you count.  If you count by release, you may be right. But if you count by chapter, the newest is 46.  From the newest chapter."
OnePunchMan,361kxg,Maximal_Disguised,3,Fri May 15 11:13:06 2015 UTC,I don't get where the 71 comes from. In tonari no young jump the number is up to 68.
OnePunchMan,361kxg,javierm885778,1 point,Fri May 15 10:46:05 2015 UTC,"Then please explain this to me  It's the same chapter, but why are they different numbers??"
OnePunchMan,361kxg,IamRem,3,Fri May 15 11:29:47 2015 UTC,"Some chapters are split into mini-arcs, like 43.1 43.2 and so on."
OnePunchMan,361kxg,Maximal_Disguised,2,Fri May 15 11:31:56 2015 UTC,why are they different numbers?   Just what I said here.
OnePunchMan,361kxg,xtkbilly,0,Fri May 15 11:45:10 2015 UTC,"Let's start at the begining:   ONE made the original webcomic. It's currently at chapter 100. It has a rather slow release (once a month or longer?). Murata draws the remake manga, with ONE still in control of the storyline I believe. His chapters are similar, but not exactly the same. He releases about every 2 weeks. Due to this different rate of release between the webcomic and manga, he occasionally releases extra chapters, or splits chapters by giving them more detail. More recently, the chapters are split into parts, labeled as 40.1, 40.2, 40.3, or so on. So instead of releasing chapter 40 as one whole part in two weeks, it takes 6 weeks for the whole chapter to be released. So Murata won't catch up to ONE's story as quickly, and it gives Murata more time to present more detail into the story. Bata.to shows this format exactly as is. Chapter 40.1is 40.1, 40.2 is 40.2, etc. Some other sites, such as Mangamap, don't follow this scheme. They follow it as integers. So Chapter 40.1 is 40, 40.2 is 41, etc. Since this happens earlier on in the series, it presents a larger discrepancy in the numbers. So, officially, the Manga is at chapter 46. I seems that I am wrong. See this comment for explanation.   *If I have anything wrong, please let me know. I'd love to make sure I have the correct information and am not spreading incorrect info.    I've recently been trying to compare the original and manga differences in chapters. The splits start to happen around chapter 17, but they are still pretty close together. Currently at ONE's Chp.27, which is Murata's Chp.30."

OnePunchMan,35tc70,TheRedFireFox,1 point,Thu May 14 11:43:36 2015 UTC,What does Saitama say at the end about being a hero?
OnePunchMan,35rqwh,IvanThePrettyCool,20,Tue May 12 23:32:30 2015 UTC,They're probably calling him Ojisan I think. It's basically a gag about him looking older than he is because he's bald.
OnePunchMan,35rqwh,TheMagicStik,5,Tue May 12 23:43:11 2015 UTC,"oohh ok, thanks"
OnePunchMan,35rqwh,SouLBK,1 point,Tue May 12 23:44:12 2015 UTC,"In some countries, e.g Spain, saying ""uncle"" is like saying ""dude"". Could be the same, I guess."
OnePunchMan,35rqwh,2Dpersonality,1 point,Fri May 15 21:48:16 2015 UTC,"Note - I don't speak Japanese, I'm just guessing based on what I've heard spoken in anime    I think there are a few different things you can call someone based on their age. Brother for young guys (Oni-san?) Man for young middle age (Ossan) Uncle for older middle age (Ojisan) Grandpa for old people (Ojiisan)    Saitama is getting annoyed because he's young middle age (Late 20s, right?) and people are calling him by the term of address normally used for much older people."
OnePunchMan,35rqwh,quigonkenny,1 point,Mon May 18 05:22:14 2015 UTC,"""Ojisan"" is just something that little kids especially might call a man who is clearly an adult (like Saitama or King). It's basically the same as the informal word for ""uncle"" and is often translated as such. It can also mean ""father"", with the same connotation as ""old man"" in English.  ""Niisan"" is something a child might call a teenager or a young adult (like Genos or flashback!Saitama). It's the same as the word for ""older brother"" and is often translated as ""brother"" or ""bro""**. That's what Saitama would prefer they call him.  And just for completion's sake, ""jiisan"" is what someone younger might call someone who is clearly old (like Bang). It's the same as the word for ""grandfather"" and is often translated as some variation on that.  Please note that all of these terms are quite informal (especially ""ojisan"" in the ""old man"" meaning, much as in English), and their usage could range from inappropriately informal to downright insulting depending on the situation. Little kids usually get a pass.  ** The word being translated as ""bro"" in the recent chapters with the Tanktop fighters is probably ""aniki"", which is a different word for ""older brother"" that is usually used by gang members or yakuza to refer to their male superiors."
OnePunchMan,35gd5b,IvanThePrettyCool,31,Sun May 10 02:19:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like Licenseless Rider is just showing us what a hero is. He knows that he isn't as strong as many of the heros above him, yet he seems to be one of the most heroic.  While the A and S ranks are filled with arrogance and a general lack of concern for the public, Mr. Rider is there for the public, he throws himself in harms way to make sure civilians aren't hurt.  All things considered, I feel that he's one of the more truly heroic character's we've seen so far."
OnePunchMan,35gd5b,Spencichu,1 point,Sun May 10 04:33:24 2015 UTC,"Nah, Saitama doesn't really show true heroic spirit. He's certainly very good, yes, but that doesn't mean true heroic spirit. He's just in it 'cause he wants to be."

OnePunchMan,35gd5b,Nitrosium,2,Mon May 11 22:46:48 2015 UTC,"Fighting isn't his hobby. Being a hero is. It's become somewhat boring because nothing offers a challenge, but his original motivation was to stop bad guys like in the cartoons he watched as a kid."
OnePunchMan,35gd5b,potentialPizza,8,Tue May 12 01:49:05 2015 UTC,Most of the heroes in the series are heroes purely because of personal interests and have become full of themselves.

OnePunchMan,34rf7m,rynubpls,7,Sun May 3 22:30:49 2015 UTC,"The chapters are official labeled as 40.1, 40.2, etc., for certain arcs after a certain part. Mangapanda probably ignores this, and just makes Chap 40.1 -> Chapter 40, Chap 40.2 -> 41. Well, their schema would have started earlier for it to reach the 70s, but the idea is the same.  This usually the case because most mangas use ""x.5"" chapter as a way to say ""This is a short side-story, that's not really a major story part"". But Murata does it differently, probably because he splits of ONE's original chapters."

OnePunchMan,34jvqp,MiggyMcMiggy,1 point,Fri May 1 20:20:28 2015 UTC,My theory is that his fighting monsters occasionally may have contributed to his workout the most. The workout may have simply been a frame of mind thing. And he just happened to be lucky that the strength of the monsters grew gradually over time in correlation with his current strength.
OnePunchMan,34jvqp,maradoification,1 point,Sat May 2 22:27:05 2015 UTC,Yea from what I could tell at first his battles where hard but he would never give up no matter what and always find a way to win like some shonen Manga super hero. But after doing that for so long he eventually reached the point he is at now. It was all will power. Which was his strongest asset.

OnePunchMan,34fxb8,jschoo,8,Fri May 1 01:49:47 2015 UTC,really? I just saw it as a joke and think it still is pretty vague.   I do agree in general about the spoilers though.

OnePunchMan,34bewr,KuroiInazuma,11,Wed Apr 29 20:28:30 2015 UTC,If only there was a scene of Saitama seeing Piccolo and thinking it was Vaccine-Man again. That would have been priceless.
OnePunchMan,34bewr,Raidend,6,Thu Apr 30 00:01:14 2015 UTC,I don't think Vaccine-Man made enough of an impression for Saitama to remember him.

OnePunchMan,345aot,thiqwddd,10,Tue Apr 28 12:33:06 2015 UTC,only five pages? Or will there be more? I have been waiting for the fight -- go caped baldy :-P
OnePunchMan,345aot,TheRedFireFox,8,Tue Apr 28 12:42:19 2015 UTC,"Sometimes he'll do them in a bunch, so maybe more pages in next couple days."
OnePunchMan,345aot,dementedfreakazoid,2,Tue Apr 28 12:44:59 2015 UTC,I'll doubt we'll see Saitama fight Tatsumaki any time soon. Maybe in July?
OnePunchMan,345aot,UnavailableUsername_,9,Tue Apr 28 13:08:09 2015 UTC,"This may be a great moment to explore Tatsumaki-Fubuki relationship.  Fubuki obviously sees her bigger sister as an enemy and threat, but i wonder what Tatsumaki thinks of her.  She helped Fubuki with the air conditioner monster, but it is not clear if it was a ""you are so useless!"" help or a ""i have to help my poor younger sister because she is so weak"" kind of help.  I wonder if Tatsumaki sees her sister as a rival/inferior being more than as a sister she has to take care of."
OnePunchMan,345aot,TheRedFireFox,8,Tue Apr 28 14:31:47 2015 UTC,"I think it’s more that Tatsumaki is trying to protect her little sister (from the flash back) from every danger possible.  One part is that Fubuki does not have that much ""talent"". Another maybe some sort of trauma (like dead parents) that awakened Tatsumakis and Fubukis powers and forces the young Tatsumaki to protect and take care of Fubuki no matter what.   Fubuki of course is instead of the protection only feeling the pressure “to grow up” and be independent (be stronger) from her sister. (the enemy and threat part) To prove her sister that they are equals as persons.   Anyway it will be fun to watch (read) the development."
OnePunchMan,345aot,Onihikage,2,Tue Apr 28 15:55:09 2015 UTC,"Well, she did say, ""Given Fubuki's level of power, I can see why she lost."" and then she chewed out Fubuki's lackey who was definitely even weaker (though it was more because he decided to hide instead of charge in and get owned)."
OnePunchMan,345aot,Heatstrike,5,Tue Apr 28 20:14:29 2015 UTC,Meh. Not much to talk about at all with so few pages...  But more OPM is always good.

OnePunchMan,345aot,KuroiInazuma,3,Wed Apr 29 17:15:09 2015 UTC,Meanwhile what is Saitama doing...just taking a nap under all that debris perhaps.
OnePunchMan,345aot,TheBaris,2,Thu Apr 30 00:26:48 2015 UTC,So few pages :(
OnePunchMan,345aot,menonono,2,Tue Apr 28 13:28:37 2015 UTC,"I love comparing the first chapter to the new chapters, I can always see that ONE has improved quite a bit, It's like Shitty_watercolour."
OnePunchMan,345aot,gruevee,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:03:29 2015 UTC,ONE definitely improved.   ONE mostly displays it in his mob psycho series.
OnePunchMan,345aot,maradoification,2,Wed Apr 29 04:45:57 2015 UTC,At this point I don't really care if he gets any better as the redraws can handle it. I'd rather him just draw his basic sketchs and progress the story along. Especially with the upcoming anime which could easily pass the redraws and continue into the Garou Arc if it wanted.
OnePunchMan,3457dl,snirOP,2,Tue Apr 28 11:57:04 2015 UTC,Well from the chapter I just checked out it seems that the sfx are the same as the One Piece chapters.
OnePunchMan,3457dl,Absolute_Legacy,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:33:53 2015 UTC,which chapter was that? was it on mangasee? it seems like someone uploaded Viz's volume 5 to mangasee
OnePunchMan,3457dl,Absolute_Legacy,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:26:34 2015 UTC,"That was Chapter 40 page 4 and no I got that from viz own manga reader. It seems that the english sfx are only available in the english digital volume releases, you can get them from the us amazon store currently the latest one is volume 6 I believe."
OnePunchMan,341vu9,ars4l4n,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:32:27 2015 UTC,"Probably only if the Manga/anime becomes popular in the west. There is a digital version already being sold by Viz Media, but no print version."
OnePunchMan,341vu9,xtkbilly,2,Mon Apr 27 19:21:45 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the Japanese won't give the print licenses to anyone before the start of the anime. I don't see any other reason and let's be honest: I've read recommandations from english, german and french manga blogs and everyone is waiting for the print release in their country. It's just a matter of time."
OnePunchMan,341vu9,NumeroUno_HueHueHue,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:45:55 2015 UTC,Actually there are quite a few series that make it over that don't have Animes. I think the other big problem is that OPM doesn't have nearly as much chapters compared those manga series that make it over without any Anime. Being able to pump out a lot of material consistently keeps it fresh in people's minds.

OnePunchMan,33quss,TheBaris,5,Sun Apr 26 03:33:38 2015 UTC,They arent because by the time people started translating the webcomic the manga was already translated up to that point.

OnePunchMan,33quss,TheBaris,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:27:43 2015 UTC,The initial chapters arent available in English so literally everyone who  doesnt speak japanese didn't read them.

OnePunchMan,33mjuh,WickeDanneh,1 point,Fri Apr 24 11:54:43 2015 UTC,I suspect it has something to do with Batoto's chapter listing system. Only the latest chapters show up top. I've missed a couple of bonus chapters because they had an older number associated with them..

THE HYPE IS REAL!!!  3) There aren't a lot of chapters for a manga, but we can only hope this is just the beginning.  4) Murata is the artist, and ONE is the author of the webcomic. Murata adds a few extra chapters here and there, but it mostly sticks to the script.  5)When he reveals his final form, of course."
OnePunchMan,33ag7k,The11025,2,Mon Apr 20 23:05:54 2015 UTC,I'm placing bets that his final form involves a killer mustache.

OnePunchMan,331vcm,steppingonthebeach,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:07:25 2015 UTC,Sadly is not. ONE is busy with Mob Psycho 100. That's the one with a schedule because is serialized in Weekly Shōnen Sunday (online magazine). OnePunchMan is something ONE does for hobby just like Saitama and his serious hero hobby. So original OPM has no schedule and sometimes we have to wait 3/4 months for a new chapter.

OnePunchMan,32tcz9,Heatstrike,2,Thu Apr 16 18:25:26 2015 UTC,That was Hilarious.  Tatsumaki is a great character. She and her sister should appear more on the story.  At the end King wanted to jump because of the embarrasment of Tatsumaki looking at his yamagami (Amagami parody??) game?  It would be great if ONE added Tatsumaki and Fubuki to the main cast.  Saitama. Genos. King. Fubuki. Tatsumaki.    They would make a great team.
OnePunchMan,32tcz9,UnavailableUsername_,3,Thu Apr 16 20:30:51 2015 UTC,Fubuki could maybe be considered a main character

OnePunchMan,32nwp9,Breesive,3,Wed Apr 15 08:16:03 2015 UTC,The webcomic A.K.A ONE's version is the original version. Chapter 50 on the webcomic is where Muratas manga version is on right now.  The webcomic has 99 chapters soo far.  I have recently decided to read both versions and there is not much difference on the story except the Webcomic is further on.
OnePunchMan,32nwp9,TheOneWithALongName,4,Wed Apr 15 08:24:13 2015 UTC,ahem (click here)
OnePunchMan,32nwp9,theothersophie,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:56:56 2015 UTC,Well damn. Completely overlooked that part.  I'm assuming the FAQ would have answered that question. My bad.
OnePunchMan,32nwp9,theothersophie,6,Wed Apr 15 18:41:23 2015 UTC,The sub isn't all that big yet so I can forgive the noobs for now. Live and learn my friend. Soon i think i'll implement flashing animations so it's impossible to miss
OnePunchMan,32nwp9,Heatstrike,2,Wed Apr 15 18:48:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, ONE is the pseudonym that the author of the original webcomic goes by. The stories are almost exactly identical, the only major difference being the artwork. And ONE's webcomic is far ahead of the redraw. It will take approximately 2-3 years for the redraw to catch up.  Also, you have to type it as ""ONE"". Everytime, no exceptions. Less you incur the wrath of the vengeful ONE-sama."
OnePunchMan,32nwp9,KushDealer,1 point,Wed Apr 15 08:35:15 2015 UTC,"So basically ONE's version is the original One Punch Man, and Murata draws it and uses ONE's version for the story and such?   This is correct.ONE made the original One Punch Man (the webcomic version), Murata stepped up and redraw the original version with better art. Storyline-wise, both version is nearly identical.There are some changes here and there but they are all minor.   Is ONE's version farther ahead?   Yes.The original currently has 99 chapter.  If you have anymore questions, feel free to ask it in this subreddit."
OnePunchMan,32nwp9,GenBlase,-1,Wed Apr 15 09:58:43 2015 UTC,ONE has the most horrible art Ive ever seen in a popular web comic series.
OnePunchMan,32l1am,Heatstrike,7,Tue Apr 14 17:18:59 2015 UTC,Did someone say new chapter?
OnePunchMan,32l1am,Miserygut,4,Tue Apr 14 21:39:20 2015 UTC,I never forget OPM updates.
OnePunchMan,32l1am,WickeDanneh,0,Tue Apr 14 20:16:18 2015 UTC,"I also remembered that ONE said the 100th chapter was coming ""soon"". Though I do believe that he had some real life problems after that announcement, so maybe it's delayed because of that. Don't ask me what problems; I can't read Japanese."
OnePunchMan,32l1am,WickeDanneh,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:43:42 2015 UTC,"Well, ONE said in the most recent chapter of Mob Psycho 100 that he had to ""fix his sitting problem""."
OnePunchMan,32l1am,KushDealer,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:58:16 2015 UTC,What does that mean? Did he hurt his tailbone or something? Is his chair broken?
OnePunchMan,32l1am,WickeDanneh,1 point,Wed Apr 15 08:14:22 2015 UTC,"I cannot tell for sure what that means, but it didn't sound good.It is horrible enough to make him delay the release date of Mob Psycho for 3 weeks.I hope that he could make a full recovery and deliver us some more quality content."
OnePunchMan,32l1am,KushDealer,1 point,Wed Apr 15 10:07:04 2015 UTC,"Since the chapters are announced at the end of each chapter, its easy to keep track.  Altough, the recent delays we suffered left me a little worried."

OnePunchMan,32l1am,Immahuman,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:27:57 2015 UTC,Thanks. I have a lot of other stuffs to keep my mind on :/  EDIT: I was not sarcastic
OnePunchMan,32fogk,TheOneWithALongName,5,Mon Apr 13 12:36:26 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat about a month ago.   In all honesty, it depends completely on how much you value seeing the story first time with Murata's artwork. I can only speak for myself, but I don't regret reading the webcomic in the slightest. It's so good. For what it's worth, at the rate the redraws currently come out, it'll take a few years to catch up to where the webcomic is now.  Of course, once you catch up, you're back to waiting for more again..."
OnePunchMan,32fogk,Heatstrike,5,Mon Apr 13 12:42:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, do it.  It's honestly pretty fun to compare the art between them. I mean, for the most part, most of the panels and framing is almost exactly the same. Seeing the ""upgrade"" in Murata's manga is funny in its own way.  But the Manga exists because of how fucking awesome ONE's story is. The art is shitty, but ONE's jokes and story transcend it enough so that you can still enjoy it.  If you don't want to spoil the story for when you eventually read Murata's version in two or so years, you could give Mob Psycho 100 a try (also by ONE). Similar to OPM in art and humor, but is more focused on the story and character development than OPM, I think. I'd say OPM is more about the parody/jokes, and MP100 is more the story."
OnePunchMan,32fogk,xtkbilly,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:08:42 2015 UTC,I'd say go for it. I felt the same way but reading the webcomic made me realize that if I had read it before the manga it would have made a lot of the character reveals and major events so much more amazing as a result of the art shift.
OnePunchMan,32fogk,senfood,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:58:22 2015 UTC,"I really like Murata's artwork and I read manga because I like the art and the story, not one of them.  Just my opinion. I have One punch-man in a special place, so I read it slowly."
OnePunchMan,32fogk,SouLBK,1 point,Sat Apr 18 23:07:19 2015 UTC,"Depends on your dedication.  ONEs artwork version pales in comparasion to Muratas, its like night and day.  However, you get a big jump on the storyline, which i think its really really good.  I say you bite the bullet, endure the weak art and follow ONEs version, the story gets epic ull see."
OnePunchMan,32fogk,MiggyMcMiggy,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:12:15 2015 UTC,"But I still feel that if I start reading the webcomic, I'm spoiling for myself.   you are not spoiling yourself if you read the webcomic"
OnePunchMan,32fogk,gruevee,0,Tue Apr 14 03:01:41 2015 UTC,"I say yes. I read the webcomic a few weeks ago and I'm so glad I did. First of all the current arc will take around 2 years to finish and it's gonna suck to wait for it. Also rereading the manga is as fun as reading it for the first time so why not read it another time but with poorer writing. Also, the Garou arc is just so good.."

Once Hammerhead was defeated and the suits destroyed two member of The Organization come to finish Hammerheadand and after attacking him the left, believing him dead. However unknown to them Hammerhead survived thanks to his thick cranium. Always for the sake of collecting data, The Organization sent G4 to fight the S-Class hero King.

OnePunchMan,320yxq,Heatstrike,4,Thu Apr 9 18:26:03 2015 UTC,"It's a shame you state only living characters. I think it would be more interesting to compare characters like Beefcake, Vaccine Man, Seaking and Boros. Even though they aren't newer characters they all have great showings and are probably stronger than almost everybody on the list besides Saitama."
OnePunchMan,320yxq,TheMagicStik,3,Fri Apr 10 19:29:42 2015 UTC,"It's a 'who's the strongest right now in the manga' list though, so dead characters wouldn't really make much sense.  I am planning on finishing a all-time list though. Maybe later today or tomorrow. Beefcake and King Piccolo really deserved more page-time."
OnePunchMan,320yxq,marindo,3,Fri Apr 10 19:36:30 2015 UTC,"Notes   Saitama - not much needs to be said Tornado - Tornado showed how much stronger she is than almost everyone else in the Dark Matter Thieves arc and against the Monster Association. And she was injured/weakened at that. Garou - Monster-Garou would be stronger than Tornado for sure. But Garou's no longer like that (probably). Still crazy strong, and still most likely has that potential, but the lecture from Saitama probably changed things. As of right now, I think Tornado deserves to be rated higher, since we don't know exactly what Garou's condition is. Garou got wrecked by Bang and Bomb before, but his growth in the MA arc was ridiculous. Bang - #1 martial artist in the world. Darkshine said Bang completely dominated him in a sparring match. Bang one-shotted Dragon-levels Fuher Ugly and Gums. Bomb wasn't able to harm Rover, but Garou was clearly stronger. Psykos - Dragon-level. Beat human-Garou. Proved to be quite a threat in the MA vs HA battle. Superalloy Darkshine - Probably most controversial ranking. Said to be physically the strongest hero. Broke every bone in human-Garou's body. Got a power-boost after the pep-talk from Prisoner. By far, tanked the most damage from Monster-Garou, including a full-power punch. Lightspeed Flash - Flash was moving at fractions of seconds against Monster-Garou. Garou said he would definitely lose in his previous form. Flash got up after Demon-Garou’s Attacks. Child Emperor, Sweet Mask and Atomic Samurai didn’t. Metal Knight - Made a robot defense system that could take 2 demon-level beings at the same time. Got his hands on a boatload of Boros' alien tech. Child Emperor seemed to rate him very highly and think he could beat the Dragon-level MA beings. Not rated higher due to lack of feats. Atomic Samurai - Did well at start against Black Sperm, but was overwhelmed by numbers. Looked strong against Melzalgald. Normal Black Sperm beat him easily though. Atomic Samurai could see Garou’s hyper speed attack against Tornado’s rock barrage, while Zombieman couldn't. Child Emperor - Child Emperor was able to dodge multiple attacks from Dragon-level Evil Water. Easily ripped apart a demon-class. Pig God - Pig God did tank a punch from demon-Garou (due to his fat). Easily beat Demon-level beings. Got beat by Gums, though. Judging from his monologue, seems to be holding a serious trump card. Smarter than you'd think he would be. Sweet Mask - Made clear he's S-class level. Sweet Mask handled himself fairly well against multiple Dragon-level monsters. Has a very interesting power that hasn’t fully been explained. Because of how he treats Metal Bat, and how much he respects the strength of S-class members, it makes me think he's stronger than Metal Bat. But that just might be due to some history between them that hasn't been revealed yet. Metal Bat - Handled himself easily against Melzalgald. ONE said Metal Bat could take a Dragon-level threat on his own and the Monsters Association battle would have went differently if he was there. Bomb - Hard to judge Bomb. Nothing was explicitly said about his strength. He got stabbed in the surprise attack. His attacks did nothing to Rover. He got knocked out by normal Black Sperm. But it's made clear he's one of the leading martial artists in the world. Speed of Sound Sonic - Sonic was faster than Rain-form Sea King. Sonic and Genos are about equal. I give Sonic the edge due to being faster. ONE said Sonic with weapons would’ve beaten pre-rain form Sea King. Genos - Got his arms easily ripped off by Gums and Fuher Ugly. Direct kick did little to Ugly. Zombieman - ONE said Zombieman is around the weakest of S-class, Also shown he had real difficulty with demon-class Pureblood – died over 200 times. According to Zombieman himself, there is a limit to how many times he can revive. Tanktop Master - Gets the short end of the stick due to his comic-relief role. But Garou said Genos had similar power but was also faster than Tanktop. Pri Pri Prisoner - Got wrecked in 1 hit by human-Garou. Miss Blizzard - Her strength was ""flattered"" against Psykos a little more than what it actually is, due to her anti-esper techniques. Also repelled Dragon-level Rover’s fire blast. She's clearly A-class though and only seems to think Sweet mask is stronger than her among the A-class heroes.  Iaian - Gets in by default. #2 A-class. Seems to be the strongest of Samurai's disciples."
OnePunchMan,320yxq,marindo,2,Thu Apr 9 19:17:36 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. In a discussion with a friend who introduced me to OPM, he said that in the original series, King is supposed to become super strong eventually because his power has to do with his will or belief in himself or ...the power of imagination... I might be remembering wrong. It'd be nice if someone who has read the original series could chime in."

I kinda want to rate him higher because of that, but no info or feats have been given in the manga to support that.  It's an ongoing ranking though, so as soon as it's shown, then Bat will move up."
OnePunchMan,320yxq,EatSleepGamez,2,Thu Apr 9 19:19:36 2015 UTC,You said this is based on information given though. Not solely manga based. So based on ONE's interview metal bat should be higher
OnePunchMan,320yxq,Boofan01,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:33:41 2015 UTC,"I sort of agree. The problem is ONE never said how the battle would change or give any specific info on just how strong Metal Bat is.   I'm just on the edge of putting him above Samurai, if I give Bat all benefit of the doubt from what ONE said, but I'm holding back, only because zero has been shown for it.  The information given part is more to do with testimonies and quotes from the characters themselves."

OnePunchMan,31vx5c,kugglelovesanime9,2,Wed May 6 04:43:21 2015 UTC,"One very booooooooooring hot afternoon, I was really not into playing games that time and I've read all recent updates of the mangas I've known so far. So I decided to randomly select titles on the front page. And from all the titles that struck me, OPM is one of them (this was the redrawn one). So I decided to click it, read the synopsis that goes ""Follows the life of an average hero who manages to win all battles with only one punch."".  At this time I was keen on closing the tab because it still is meh for me but I carried on to read the 1st chapter and saw this guy that reminded me of Piccolo and I'm like, ""Oh boy, is this gonna be like Gintama and its constant 4th wall destruction?"". Few pages later he appeared. There he stood, with his normal serious face and proceeded to one punch the guy, as the title implied.   . ""It was ok."" and carried on reading   . Chapter 2: For all the great art it had, that kid with the cleft chin became out of place which made me laugh. (Seriously, who expected a character like that to pop up?). So the minutes spent on reading turned into hours and chapter 2 turned into the latest chapter (46, at the time). Really glad I didn't drop this one. Can't wait for the anime."

That alone gave me a good reason to at least check it out.  And well, as it turns out, the entire premise WAS about as boring and dumb as it initially sounds, but that didn't stop me from reading it. I kept going regardless, and was positively surprised by the number of cool characters, shonen parody, absurd powerups, good writing, etc.  I think that may be just one of the reason why the Manga is not so popular now - the entire premise of the story sounds so boring, it's hard to get people interested or invested at least in reading it, but I guess the anime will change that."

OnePunchMan,31m6sd,lulzmort,1 point,Mon Apr 6 11:02:16 2015 UTC,The real one better compare to this amazing motion manga
OnePunchMan,31kfrj,hxh4ever,26,Sun Apr 5 23:09:11 2015 UTC,"It's hard to compare them because, at least to me, One Punch Man is a comedy manga at heart then an action manga. If you read OP Man for the action, you won't be let down since the art is super awesome but don't expect Saitama to be the son of a cyborg and God and then he suddenly gets a new power up every arc. That's certainly not what this manga is about."
OnePunchMan,31kfrj,HAPPYSADPERSON,23,Sun Apr 5 23:43:48 2015 UTC,"OPM is more satire of the whole shounen superhero genre.   Power rankings that don't make sense (King ahahaha) and of course the invincible Saitama deconstructing all the usual tropes (levelled up waaay too fast, no rival/equal). There's probably a lot more you can observe than what I pointed out."
OnePunchMan,31kfrj,hamsalamibacon,2,Mon Apr 6 00:49:59 2015 UTC,"Its definitely not like the others, since its not about progression of character strength, or relationship building or battle mechanics. Rather, its the antithesis of that. Strength, training, intimidation and glory have no meaning to saitama.  I read opm not to see saitama grow, but to see others have their quests be crushed by saitama's indifference, and how he unwittingly is educating others on the futility of their quests."
OnePunchMan,31kfrj,centagon,12,Mon Apr 6 07:07:08 2015 UTC,"Imo, it's more fair to compare them with Gintama, Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo and the likes. Animes that don't really take themselves seriously and just want the readers to enjoy and have fun.  But really OPM is the only manga I have read multiple times. Both the original and Murata's. Sure I have reread other mangas but I just keep coming back to OPM. Can't get enough of it."
OnePunchMan,31kfrj,UNpupzlr,11,Mon Apr 6 00:24:06 2015 UTC,"IMO, One Punch-Man is just plain fun to read. I read One Piece and Berserk and a lot of other series, but whenever a new chapter of OPM comes out it is always at the top of my list of things to read because of how much fun its is to read about every situation that Saitama gets into and out of. 10/10"
OnePunchMan,31kfrj,alatar_,4,Sun Apr 5 23:40:52 2015 UTC,"""One Punch-Man is just plain fun to read.""   Couldn't agree more. One Punch Man has a great blend of comedy and action, an insanely good cast of characters, and a very fun story. The actual ""plot"" isn't as deep or complex as HxH/Bleach/Naruto/etc but it is just tons of fun."
OnePunchMan,31kfrj,Heatstrike,5,Mon Apr 6 00:05:33 2015 UTC,Simply it doesn't. OPM is seinen manga and the main theme is comedy.
OnePunchMan,31kfrj,kurosaki1990,2,Mon Apr 6 17:30:56 2015 UTC,"Its way more comedic than all of these other series. And in this case, its a good thing. I mean, it IS about a guy who can beat almost anything with basically one punch. That doesn't mean there is no seriousness, but its kinda like the opposite in scale to say, DBZ, where it gets pretty serious with the plot with occasional comedy. In all honesty, I like it more than most other series, especially with the good designs of Murata's manga. Plus Saitama is super relatable despite his strength, since he's pretty much an average guy that happens to have ungodly strength. Really though, its a comedy manga, so you can't easily compare it to something like Bleach or Naruto, which thrives on serious plot points and character development through hardships."
OnePunchMan,31kfrj,dragonian456,2,Sun Apr 5 23:59:15 2015 UTC,"Imo its first and foremost a parody of the titles you mentioned, especially DBZ with its year long fights. It plays with shonen tropes but has a few important messages mixed in too. Personally i love how he makes an overpowered protagonist work so effortlessly. Its just awesome."
OnePunchMan,31kfrj,Metagen,3,Mon Apr 6 00:29:44 2015 UTC,"Dragon Ball isn't that bad in the manga, most fights last about the same or possibly less than others. For instance, Dragon Ball ran 16 Volumes, Dragon Ball Z (which iirc, was still just dragon Ball in japan, though not certain) ran 26 volumes, with only the final one being large.   To compare, Full Metal Alchemist also ran 26 volumes, and many of the others mentioned here already surpass it (HXH is the shortest that I know of on this list (except perhaps Fairy Tail, not sure there) and it's already past 26). The Anime of DBZ is what gave it that rep, but the manga is actually kinda short compared to the norm (well, unless you add in Dragon Ball)."

OnePunchMan,31kfrj,kenpachiki,1 point,Sun Apr 12 13:24:39 2015 UTC,"DBZ, and Naruto. Followed both of them. Based on what I like about them, I like Naruto but honestly, OPM is far better in terms of entertainment and hype. Like I really want to know what he will do next, unlike DBZ and Naruto.  Plus the power levels are more intense in OPM. Plus the comedy is bang on."

When I got to the end of the manga (Sea King arc at the time), I read through the whole webcomic, and I personally like being ahead."

OnePunchMan,31isgo,Illummizolldyck,7,Sun Apr 5 14:28:13 2015 UTC,"""Sweet Face""   As for how strong he is, Sweet Mask is clearly stated to be S-class level. Based on how he was treating Metal Bat, and later in the Heroes Association vs the Monsters Association, I'd say he was stronger than Metal Bat, Pri Pri Prisoner and Tanktop Master.   Based on everyone's feats during that battle and different characters thoughts, as well as Sweet Mask's attitude; I think it's safe to say Child Emperor, Pig God, Zombieman, Atomic Samurai, Darkshine, Bang, Tatsuki, and Lightspeed Flash are all stronger than him. Metal Knight is a pretty safe bet to be stronger too. And we haven't seen much feats from Watchdog-man or Engine Knight but I think they're both stronger. Child Emperor and Zombieman seemed to rate Lightspeed Flash more highly than Sweet Mask, and since Engine Knight and Watchdog-man are ranked higher than Flash, they're both probably stronger too.  Sweet Mask is most likely stronger than Genos too, I think. Genos got wrecked by the Dragon-level Monsters easily, whereas Sweet Mask handled himself much better and tanked a few hits.  Also, there's Sweet Mask's power. ONE spoilers"
OnePunchMan,31isgo,Heatstrike,5,Sun Apr 5 18:53:51 2015 UTC,He is easily an S-class hero and I guess he might be a stronger than Pri Pri Prisoner. In the original he shows a lot of strength based feats like lifting large boulders and stuff.
OnePunchMan,31isgo,UNpupzlr,5,Sun Apr 5 14:53:43 2015 UTC,He also has a regenerative quality but to what extent we don't really know yet. Probably less the what Zombieman has but nothing too insignificant
OnePunchMan,31isgo,DuckMeYellow,3,Sun Apr 5 15:12:22 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing he's going to be roughly equal to metal bat, if only because of their interaction in the A-city cleanup chapter. I realize it isn't an actual fight, but it seems like a fair social clue until they both have an actual list of feats."
OnePunchMan,31isgo,The11025,3,Sun Apr 5 15:39:45 2015 UTC,It was stated that if metal bat was there the fight would've gone in a different direction
OnePunchMan,31isgo,theradicalbanana,3,Sun Apr 5 15:57:46 2015 UTC,"According to ONE, Metal Bat is one of the strongest S-class heroes. And that he wasn't joking when he said he'd be able to deal with a disaster level Dragon by himself."

OnePunchMan,31fq49,UNpupzlr,1 point,Mon Apr 6 00:20:59 2015 UTC,"Saitama would win. If it was against pre-new 52 Superman than it might end up being like the Superman x Goku Death Battle where if the Earth is destroyed then Saitama can't breath or move anywhere.

Unless Saitama punched him to a System with a Red Sun.   The thing about all these ""vs Super Man"" stuff is that you can't beat or harm Superman unless you exploit his weakness which is Kryptonite, Magic and taking away his powers in a Red Sun system. At this point you have to consider this: ""Is the person Super is fighting the kind of person that would exploit this?"". Sure Saitama probably can grab some Kryptonite and beat super with one punch but is he the type of person to do that? Can Saitama use magic? Can Saitama figure out where a system with a Red Sun is and aim a punch to that system, is he the type of person who would that to begin with? Even in a death Match?  These are things you have to consider becuase even if Saitama is God level strong, Super Man is ""Nigh invulnerable""."

OnePunchMan,30ty7j,Fessere,3,Mon Mar 30 21:15:43 2015 UTC,"Okamaitachi has always been his name. It's a play on words; just like with his fellow Atomic Samurai disciples Iaian (""iai"" + ""iron"") and Bushidrill (""bushido"" + ""drill""). An ""okama"" is a transvestite, and a ""kamaitachi"" (lit. ""sickle weasel"") is monster of Japanese folklore that takes the appearance of three weasels that appear in a whirlwind to cut their victims. Iaian (probably should be ""Iairon"", though no one spells it that way) and Bushidrill already have their wordplay partially in english, so it's not necessary to change them to communicate that meaning. ""Okamaitachi"" as wordplay only makes sense in Japanese, so unless someone can find a way to get across both transvestites and cutting wind (and/or weasels/sickles) in an english play on words, ""Slicing Sheman"" is about as close as you'll get in english."

And I'd certainly be happy with that. I don't think he's related to those two because they'd have probably mentioned it by then, and that would mean Blast would have a dojo to fit thematically with the group or something, and it doesn't seem like Blast enjoys human contact.

OnePunchMan,30spxz,The11025,5,Mon Mar 30 13:18:52 2015 UTC,well it would fit with the story -- like the most non-realistic one is that character -- so genos has a conflict between his believes as a hero from the association and his goal to destroy that cyborg  but didn’t one of the s-class say that metal knight is his enemy?
OnePunchMan,30spxz,TheRedFireFox,2,Mon Mar 30 19:58:17 2015 UTC,"Engine knight told him that, but I don't think that necessarily means MK is directly responsible for the mad cyborg's actions."
OnePunchMan,30spxz,The11025,4,Mon Mar 30 21:03:39 2015 UTC,so what do you think it means? How is MK connected to the problem... is he the builder?
OnePunchMan,30spxz,TheRedFireFox,1 point,Tue Mar 31 22:13:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know exactly what to think about what Engine Knight said, but because it was him who said it, I assume it's because Genos is a cyborg. More specifically, because Genos is an S-class cyborg made by a scientist Metal Knight presumably doesn't about. I don't think MK knows about Genos's mission against ""the mad cyborg"".  Like I said before, I don't think Metal Knight is directly responsible for the mad cyborg's action. As the greatest mechanic in the story MK is certainly a suspect for it's construction, but I think he's too selfish to directly put his tech into another hero. Dr. Stench as the constructor would certainly be a good plot twist. ""The organization"" seems to specialize robotics, as they built both the bald terrorists' suits and the robot god made to fight King. The organization very likely built the mad cyborg, and they're probably using his tech, with or without his permission."
OnePunchMan,30spxz,The11025,2,Tue Mar 31 23:20:21 2015 UTC,"Bomb is Bangs older brother, hes only been revealed in the ONE version so far.  Silver Fang is Bangs hero name, but you might have a point there, unless Blast is both  the real and hero name of the nº1 S-Class hero  Ive always speculated that the cyborg from Genos tragic childhood might one of Bofoys inventions gone haywire, but all is open for interpretation till it becomes canon."
OnePunchMan,30tggq,planetfoxy,13,Mon Mar 30 15:58:55 2015 UTC,In my opinion it's because it doesn't take itself too seriously.  It has good jokes and great fights and a clear premise. One's story is fantastic even if it's just a side project for him. And muruta's redraw is just amazing.
OnePunchMan,30tggq,FLoppy_McLongsocks,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:10:07 2015 UTC,"Pardon my ignorance, by what do you mean by redraw?"
OnePunchMan,30tggq,FLoppy_McLongsocks,7,Mon Mar 30 16:14:58 2015 UTC,"Well the original comic is created and drawn by the author ONE, and then muruta redraws it, and that's the well drawn one you probably see."
OnePunchMan,30tggq,scotbud123,4,Mon Mar 30 16:24:09 2015 UTC,"To add to what /u/FLoppy_McLongsocks said, the art in the redrawn version is one of the best things about OPM for a lot of us, some of the things that he does because it's only a web comic and he can take as much room/as many pages as he wants are amazing.   Here's a gif to show what I mean. I could link you like 10 more of these but this is one of the few that doesn't really have any spoilers. This gif is made with like 10-15 pages from the manga, he makes them like this to produce an awesome effect.  That's just one of the amazing things that this manga has to offer artistically. The art in the redraw is one of the biggest reasons that OPM is my favorite manga."
OnePunchMan,30tggq,AlmightyZael,6,Mon Mar 30 20:55:44 2015 UTC,"Yes it's good. It's funny, the art work is amazing, the comedy stays consistent, it has serious undertones, and it doesn't take itself seriously. It's refreshing, fights don't last 100 chapters like in other series, and it's good to see something where you can just relax and not worry about the MC (though the side characters can be defeated).  I see you're asking a lot of questions to people posting answers. Why don't you just read it? Seriously. You're only gonna know once you read it yourself. It's short, only a 40 chapters or so."

OnePunchMan,30tggq,quigonkenny,2,Mon Mar 30 19:26:52 2015 UTC,no. its still going. just short so far.
OnePunchMan,30tggq,Gabu-chan,2,Mon Mar 30 19:25:54 2015 UTC,"It's basically a Japanese ""The Tick"", with a fair bit of DBZ (the author is an admitted fan) thrown in. The characters are set in a world where ""Superhero"" is something you might legitimately find on someone's resumé, and thus is full of the same kind of quirky heroes and wannabes you might find in The Tick, only based as much on Japanese anime and video game archetypes as Western superhero archetypes. The battles are often legit, even the ones that end in one punch, but there are gag battles as well, and to the author's and artist's credit, you don't always know which you're in until it's over. The humor ranges from subtle to overt to downright silly, but it never falls flat, and the writing and characterization range from stellar to dropjaw brilliant. And finally, as has been said, the art in the remake version is absolutely godly, except when it intentionally isn't (not that you'll mind)."
OnePunchMan,30tggq,ultimatepcgamer,3,Tue Mar 31 06:33:54 2015 UTC,"Seriously, what's your problem? If you're just going to ask a bunch of questions why not read it instead?"
OnePunchMan,30tggq,ultimatepcgamer,1 point,Tue Mar 31 00:51:48 2015 UTC,"I fell in love with One's original comic about a year ago. The redraw is beautifully done. What made me fall in love with the work is how Saitama is by far one of the most powerful people in the universe and he go there through hard work and determination. But he still is just an average joe who doesn't boast on and on about being the best. He just does what he thinks is right, while the rest of the world doesn't believe he is even that strong."

OnePunchMan,30tggq,Maximal_Disguised,0,Tue Mar 31 15:04:43 2015 UTC,"What immediately drew me into the manga is how similar the tone feels to Gintama. You know the sudden serious arcs in Gintama where the action and feels turn up to 11 and the comedy stays perfect? It's pretty much like that throughout the whole thing.  Okay...., the comedy and overall quality is not quite on Gintama's level (i mean, what is?) , but it's pretty damn good. Also Murata's artwork is stunning."
OnePunchMan,30tggq,Emsavio,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:28:29 2015 UTC,Is Gintama better than OnePunchMan?
OnePunchMan,30tggq,AgaveBlue,5,Mon Mar 30 16:57:34 2015 UTC,No. OPM all the way.
OnePunchMan,30tggq,FLoppy_McLongsocks,4,Mon Mar 30 20:22:36 2015 UTC,"I'd say they're a tie as far as favorites go for me. They're different types of comedy, can't really compare them. But if you like Gintama, you'd definitely love OPM."
OnePunchMan,30tggq,TheBaris,-4,Tue Mar 31 00:52:16 2015 UTC,Does the protagonist really win all his fights with one punch? I really don't see the point of an action anime where the bad guys are weaklings LOL.
OnePunchMan,30tggq,theothersophie,5,Mon Mar 30 16:30:46 2015 UTC,"You can probably look through some of my past comments to get a better sense of my opinion, but the manga is not really about OnePunchMan's fights. The fight scenes themselves are incredible (and you really do have to read it yourself to understand why), but the real crux of the manga is about the vast array of bizarre, funny, unique characters, and how they have to deal with their worldview being challenged. Throughout the story, characters are often challenged with the idea of what they want out of life, what it means to be a hero, to be strong, to be the strongest. As readers, we are challenged to think about what really makes someone a good person and to question our priorities and values in a silly, comical, and surprisingly deep format."
OnePunchMan,30tggq,TheBaris,3,Mon Mar 30 18:10:33 2015 UTC,"That's the point though, they're not weaklings. He's just really strong."
OnePunchMan,30tggq,scotbud123,-2,Mon Mar 30 16:31:30 2015 UTC,So he really does win all his fights with one punch? LOL

OnePunchMan,30qvqw,mrsquintyeyes,4,Mon Mar 30 00:13:22 2015 UTC,"Roughly once a month. He writes in an estimate date for each chapter, but he also spends a lot of time on details, so it's easy to miss that date."
OnePunchMan,30qvqw,The11025,3,Mon Mar 30 01:42:13 2015 UTC,"Are you sure it's him who sets the estimates? It's always just two weeks after the release, because it's supposed to be an estimate bi-weekly release. If Murata knows he has a lot to do then he would put the estimate further away."
OnePunchMan,30qvqw,WickeDanneh,3,Mon Mar 30 03:14:51 2015 UTC,"The fact that Sonic can dart away just like that after being overwhelmed ruins the impact of the Serious Series. And even if he did dart away, Saitama would definitely notice it. He was the only one who noticed where Garou disappeared at the end of the Garou arc. I always thought that Sonic would limp away behind the scenes."
OnePunchMan,30qvqw,WickeDanneh,5,Mon Mar 30 03:19:49 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong, but my understanding from the original was that Saitama never actually hit Sonic, it was the air shockwave from just moving forward slightly that made Sonic feel like he was hit by a brick wall."
OnePunchMan,30qvqw,AgaveBlue,4,Mon Mar 30 12:29:45 2015 UTC,That's right.
OnePunchMan,30qvqw,WickeDanneh,4,Mon Mar 30 12:40:09 2015 UTC,"In that case, I don't think there's really an inconsistency there. If Saitama had used a Serious Series move and actually, physically hit Sonic...then I do believe the street cleaners would have a busy day ahead of them.  As it was, I think Saitama just stopped focusing on Sonic in the immediate aftermath, and non-serious Saitama has been known to be a tad oblivious about details that he doesn't care too much about."
OnePunchMan,30qvqw,AgaveBlue,2,Mon Mar 30 18:13:16 2015 UTC,"But you can clearly see Sonic in a state of shock. He can barely utter out a sentence while he's laying there, staring into nothingness before seemingly slipping out of consciousness. That's not a condition fit for stealthily dashing away. The Serious Series was supposed to break Sonic's spirit so that he wouldn't bother Saitama anymore. The Serious Series is supposed to be impactful like that."
OnePunchMan,30qvqw,WickeDanneh,2,Mon Mar 30 19:30:27 2015 UTC,"It'll certainly be interesting to see how Sonic reacts, whether with a broken spirit or with stronger resolve than ever. But when I read that scene, I see an utterly defeated, but still superhumanly fast escapee, and a superhero who's known for occasional lapses in focus that has momentarily stopped paying attention.   I think that compared to Saitama, it's easy to forget that Sonic is faster than the human/robot eye. And Sonic is all about running, after all; to me it doesn't seem too great a leap for that to include running away when there's nothing more to be done. How Sonic deals with the crushing loss and imminent internal crisis will definitely be a fascinating read for the future chapters!"

OnePunchMan,30tw85,planetfoxy,7,Mon Mar 30 17:57:47 2015 UTC,"Well if you're going to ask that, you should probably read the thing first! The idea is that the test has a written portion and a physical portion, both worth 50 points for a total of 100. Genos aced both the physical test and the written test, because you don't need to be as strong as Saitama to be an S-class. Saitama on the other hand did abysmally on his written test, but on his physical test, he broke every record previously set by the association by quite a bit. He scored the full 50 on his physical, but his written only got 21, so he barely squeezed by with a 71 and was put at the bottom of C-class. His feats from there have caused him to rise up to B-class, and he'll probably rise even further."

Someone's going to spoil something for you if you keep hanging around here! I'd love to go into the anime totally blind.

And this is because saitama looks completely ordinary, has little ambition, and is slowly giving into his disinterest. He's the dark horse of the universe, and even when he does incredible things that save everyone, fate dictates that saitama remains exactly who he's always been, even before he was a hero: a nobody.  The idea is that there's more to life than being strong, and admist all these heroes and villians who seek strength in various ways, they dont realise how miserable it will make them as saitama does. And possibly the journey truly is better than the destination."

OnePunchMan,30qlas,Stabbylasso,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:38:30 2015 UTC,but then he would negate the force with vector reflection...
OnePunchMan,30qlas,Stabbylasso,2,Sun Mar 29 23:48:39 2015 UTC,"can't negate force if there is no free space to negate things too.  Things still have mass. if an underground base the size of a city is thrown into the air with Accelerator in the center SOMETHING is going to happen.  Things still have weight and yada yada yada...  bah, i forgot the first rule of Accelerator ""who would win"" which is ""Lol Accelerator wins lol""  but looking at the wiki    The barrier for his redirection is not an absolute defense, as Kihara Amata has demonstrated. Since it only reverses the vectors that are coming towards him, any vector that comes towards his barrier but pulls away at the exact moment before hitting its field of affect, his field will mistakenly reverse the vector and go towards Accelerator   so he does have some weaknesses, but not many. the character seems to be written as a big ""I WIN"" Character who is only beaten by a very few things, such as the bigger ""I WIN"" in Image Breaker.   Granted, OPM is that too, but its silly in its own way because OPM is the only person that strong and he doesn't give a single fuck, which makes it fun.  Honestly, I think OPM would take a fight series 6/10. Going off of known feats, Jumping from the moon to the earth in a few seconds, holding his breath to not start decompressing in space, the shockwave from Serious Punch, and Serious Table Flip seem like they could just overpower Accel.   More over, upon reading the wiki and just how he set up his defense, I think that Lightspeed Flash, who threw a punch that covered a very large distance in .00001 seconds, could slap Accel before he could react.  But that's just my thought.   fixed spelling cause lol autocorrect"
OnePunchMan,30qlas,CystemicCondition,0,Mon Mar 30 00:00:30 2015 UTC,"Accelerator's barrier which reverses vectors is set up subconsciously without any input from himself. It effects the vectors of anything that enters the field surrounding his body with no conscious effort or awareness from himself. A normal attack like a punch or kick or slap would still be affected by his barrier regardless of how fast it travels and regardless of whether or not Accelerator is even aware it's coming.  While his power is active, I think Saitama would have to use the same trick as Kihara Amata( assuming Saitama figures out what's going on). I don't see Saitama surprise attacking Accelerator when he's completely unaware that he's about to be attacked.  Edit: Basically my argument isn't that Accelerator would win. It's just that you're not gonna punch through his barrier without using the Kihara Amata trick. And someone with Saitama's power and speed would be able to do it with impunity, I think. While Amata was ultimately beaten, but not before he did a lot of damage to Accelerator."
OnePunchMan,30qlas,Stabbylasso,2,Sun Mar 29 22:08:22 2015 UTC,"I think that something that moves so fast that in three pannels and with no change on the timer in the bottom left corner he covers a distance that looks to be at least 50 feet would move too fast for a subconscious mind to react.  Just because something happens ""Subconsciously"" doesn't mean there isn't a lag time, it just means theres a very small one. I doubt that the lagtime for his ability is as short as the speed of Lightspeed Flash's fist vs Garou.  And I'm pretty sure that Saitama's sneeze would kill Accel if it hit him.

OnePunchMan,30hdfe,JohnyCalzone,5,Fri Mar 27 17:13:23 2015 UTC,Depends. First we gotta see which company gets the rights. But after the first season is out in Japan....I'd say a year and a half at most is when we will see our first dubbed episode. Maybe even sooner if the anime becomes really popular over in the west.
OnePunchMan,30hdfe,angelicable,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:20:57 2015 UTC,Funimation might do a broadcast dub though.
OnePunchMan,30hdfe,cabel24,-2,Sat Mar 28 07:53:59 2015 UTC,subbed version > dubbed version though...
OnePunchMan,30hdfe,angelicable,9,Fri Mar 27 17:57:02 2015 UTC,How can you say that about something that doesn't exist yet? Don't be a weeabo and just say hurr durr all dubs are bad. Just look at Space Dandy for a modern dub that a lot of people enjoyed the dub more than the sub.
OnePunchMan,30hdfe,Not_enough_yuri,-1,Fri Mar 27 21:37:22 2015 UTC,"wtf? I'm just basing this off all the anime i watched so far that is dubbed. Bleach, Naruto, Dragon balls, GTO. All of them, while listening to their dub, was pretty hard to watch. So that's my general experience and my own opinions. If you don't like it, big whoop. No need to insult me or my opinions. Yea i watched a few episodes of space dandy and it seems nice, but I prefer sub over dubbed, and generally, subbed are better than dub because some American voice actors cannot voice for shit, whereas Japan has a fucking industry devoted to it. So yea, maybe think about that next time before you insult some's opinion."
OnePunchMan,30hdfe,TheKk47,6,Fri Mar 27 21:41:07 2015 UTC,"I think you're being a little shortsighted here. You can't say that all dubs are bad just because you've watched four dubs that you didn't like. Now I've never seen Onizuka, but the other you mentioned have pretty bad dubs and pretty good subs in mine and most other people's opinion. But that's not true for every show. I'm personally a fan of the dubs for Fullmetal Alchemist, Baccano!, Dragonball Z, Space Dandy, Panty and Stocking, and Cowboy Bebop. I'm pretty sure even Watanabe liked the dub for Bebop more than the sub. So while it's really a matter of opinion, you can't just go off and say that all english dubs are abysmal. As a rule, the original audio with subs is usually better, but there are exceptions to every rule."
OnePunchMan,30hdfe,robcap,4,Sat Mar 28 01:30:46 2015 UTC,"Do you even speak Japanese? If not, how would even know what good Japanese voice acting sounds like? The whole sub vs dub thing is bs to me. Some dubs sound dry or unenthusiastic, but I don't speak Japanese so I don't go judging their work. It makes no sense really, it's like saying Hitler is a better orator than Obama and not even speaking German. You can't really compare when you don't have a basis in both."
OnePunchMan,30hdfe,Immahuman,4,Sat Mar 28 09:48:13 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty small sample size. I prefer the sub of Fullmetal alchemist and redline, but I prefer the dub of one piece, DBZ, shiki, hellsing ultimate and attack on titan. It varies completely from one anime to the next, based on how good the relevant voice actors are and (pretty often) which one you heard first."
OnePunchMan,30hdfe,hyghonryce,5,Sat Mar 28 00:50:00 2015 UTC,That depends. I like DBZ dubbed. There are a few animes that are good dubbed.

OnePunchMan,3052s7,Aldesso,24,Tue Mar 24 23:03:14 2015 UTC,Saitama not affected by her telekinesis. Picks her up and uses serious spanking.
OnePunchMan,3052s7,angelicable,3,Tue Mar 24 15:48:03 2015 UTC,"Remake chapter 36 (Batoto), page 25, second panel. Right after Bang tells Tornado to stand down, after she turned Genos into ""modern art"" after his ""brat"" comment. We see that she already has Saitama up in the air.  My guess is that he's directly ""helpless"" against that aspect of her psychokinesis, but that doesn't necessarily mean he can't beat her, or that she can beat him. We've already seen in the original that her ""head twist"" finisher can be resisted by a (by definition) less powerful character than Saitama, and we know that tossing objects at him won't work, so short of tossing him into space, she can't kill him. And the blowback from his Serious Strike should be able to be used either to counter her movement of him or to attack her from distance while she's moving him. All that of course assumes that she's able to catch him in the first place, which is probably not going to be the case unless he's caught unaware (as he was in chapter 36). He has the speed advantage all over her, and presumably she has to see him to grab him."
OnePunchMan,3052s7,quigonkenny,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:12:54 2015 UTC,We've already seen he's comfortable with being in space

I feel like this would anger her further leading to her applying more effort, in the form of either focusing more of her telekinetic powers on him or by hurling objects at him/hurling him at objects. At this point I think she will start to grasp the depth of his strength."

OnePunchMan,2zz25b,The11025,4,Tue Mar 24 00:48:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe not, Attack on Titan was about 25 episodes and covered up to chapter 33/34.  Also chances are they will cover a couple of story arcs and call it a season. Going back to AoT they cover two arcs in those 25episodes, not a specific number of chapters.  Now of course AoT had serious pacing issues but the OPM anime isn't planned until around October so we should be alright."
OnePunchMan,2zz25b,DuckMeYellow,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:03:06 2015 UTC,"AoT had mega long chapters with lots of dialogue, like most monthly manga do. OPM does have long chapters once in a while, but the long chapters have detailed drawings of fights (oh those drawings!) that fill it out. That sadi, they'll prob do a short season or as you suggested fit several arcs into a full season and hope the next year will have enough chapters."
OnePunchMan,2zz25b,k_g_Bull,4,Fri Mar 27 06:28:02 2015 UTC,Probably gonna end after the Boros fight and then take a break
OnePunchMan,2zzn0m,vadsomful,18,Mon Mar 23 07:13:02 2015 UTC,I think they'd play it the way it's handled in the manga. Build up how powerful the bad guy is. Build up a whole lot of tension and hype for the inevitable fight with Saitama. Then he ends it in two seconds.
OnePunchMan,2zzn0m,resdamalos,8,Mon Mar 23 14:15:43 2015 UTC,I'm excited to see the seaking arc. I bet they will do a good job with that one
OnePunchMan,2zzn0m,bison999,9,Mon Mar 23 16:46:50 2015 UTC,"The boros fight took like 5+ chapters that were fairly long, that's at least 2 episodes right there.  They'll be fine, Madhouse has got this, look at HxH."
OnePunchMan,2zzn0m,scotbud123,3,Mon Mar 23 20:39:06 2015 UTC,"But the deal with HxH was that it had a load of content to begin with. Now, Madhouse has to deal with an ongoing manga with chapters that are a fairly quick read (for example the sparring between ) Also, I'm mostly concerned about the chapters with one enemy which Saitama defeats fairly quickly"
OnePunchMan,2zzn0m,scotbud123,4,Tue Mar 24 18:38:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know. But I think if any studio can make this without fucking it up and without bullshitting with a bunch of filler it's going to be Madhouse."
OnePunchMan,2zzn0m,xtkbilly,2,Wed Mar 25 01:47:46 2015 UTC,Like most other shows fill up time. 1-2 Chapters per episode.
OnePunchMan,2zzn0m,xtkbilly,3,Mon Mar 23 20:27:11 2015 UTC,"But the problem would be that they would burn through the content of the manga. Also, some chapters are very short which would screw up lots of things..."
OnePunchMan,2zzn0m,bmujagic,5,Tue Mar 24 18:42:01 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the anime will end at either the Boros arc, or the Garou arc.  If it were up to me, it would go something like this:   Chp. 1-3 -> Episode 1 Chp. 4-5 -> Episode 2 Chp. 6 -> Episode 3 Chp. 7-8 -> Episode 4 Chp. 9-10 -> Episode 5 Chp. 11 (and some extra non-story chapter) -> Episode 6  Chp. 12-13 -> Episode 7 Chp. 14-15 -> Episode 8 Chp. 16 (and an extra) -> Episode 9. Chp. 17-18 -> Episode 10 Chp. 19 (and an extra) -> Episode 11 Chp 20.8 (or Chp.20) -> Episode 12   (the chapter could also be skipped)   Numbering after this gets kind of wonky from Batato, so I'm going to skip the rest for now.  Reading through all those chapters doesn't take too long. But anime has timing, and fights actually take up a lot more time than we think. They have to make tension build up between everything, so a fight that takes up a whole chapter could actually fill most of an episode! I think with this order, you can see the parts and somewhat time it so that you see where the act breaks happen, where the episode will end, and where it will pick up from next time.  Take a look at DBZ's manga and anime. According to this, they only had 14 pages per chapter, as well. Yet they nearly had a chapter per episode!  Some of it was certainly really long tension/filler, but even if you cut out enough of that, it probably wouldn't even reach 2 chapters per episode.  So yeah, OPM definitely has enough content for 1 full season (~22 episodes?). If they do all through the Boros arc, they may have enough for a second season, though I expect not. If they do all of Garou, then no second season, for sure."

OnePunchMan,2zonts,Aokuma,3,Sat Mar 21 00:58:23 2015 UTC,YEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSs!!! When do we get to see the PV????
OnePunchMan,2zp3wn,ergic1,11,Fri Mar 20 13:27:06 2015 UTC,In serious mode Saitama can Onepunch anything.
OnePunchMan,2zp3wn,ag487,3,Fri Mar 20 14:09:56 2015 UTC,Even everything
OnePunchMan,2zp3wn,Nitrosium,3,Tue Mar 24 04:12:01 2015 UTC,Reality warpers are going to be an issue for Saitama till he shows some sort of resistance to it.
OnePunchMan,2zp3wn,Zeru_Fenrir,2,Fri Mar 20 21:15:32 2015 UTC,Muscles too strong to be warped?
OnePunchMan,2zp3wn,Andreasfr1,3,Sun Mar 22 07:31:11 2015 UTC,For all we know Saitama could be warping reality without actively realizing that that's what his powers are.
OnePunchMan,2zp3wn,Emsavio,2,Tue Mar 31 01:11:11 2015 UTC,"""I trained in a way that I believe would make anyone strong enough to one-hit anything, so now I'm strong enough to one-hit anything."" And his powers are simply ""Belief=Reality"". It's possible."
OnePunchMan,2zp3wn,Andreasfr1,3,Tue Mar 31 08:59:19 2015 UTC,"We've yet to see Saitama fight someone who can bend the laws of the universe itself.  Saitama would probably win due to his infinite plot-armor though, so I'll say yes."
OnePunchMan,2zp3wn,DaklozeDuif,6,Fri Mar 20 23:04:07 2015 UTC,"Let's see... Nope. there is living tribunal, Galactus, Eternity, infinty, many many nigh-omnipotents, Saitama would be willed out of existence because the power difference is too great. Also check out /r/whowouldwin, if you are interested in these kind of things."
OnePunchMan,2zp3wn,angelicable,3,Fri Mar 20 15:13:13 2015 UTC,b-but plot armor is too strong
OnePunchMan,2zp3wn,CaptainBubblesMcGee,6,Fri Mar 20 23:18:10 2015 UTC,"Id argue that as a gag manga his power is literally plot armor, so yeah he can take them all down. Unless we take into account how often those guys revive"
OnePunchMan,2zp3wn,derpwadmcstuffykins,1 point,Sat Mar 21 23:11:29 2015 UTC,"Is it really ""plot armor"" if OPM's very definition is having no seeable limit? He's just designed that way, which doesn't quite meet the definition of what plot armor is."
OnePunchMan,2zp3wn,Emsavio,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:10:22 2015 UTC,"I don't see what you mean. Him being designed to be ultimately powerful is the plot so the term ""plot armor"" works fine."
OnePunchMan,2zp3wn,derpwadmcstuffykins,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:44:30 2015 UTC,what if he threw a punch that shatters realities? i think he could beat the average marvel dude but with cosmic stuff it is always an endless debate
OnePunchMan,2zp3wn,babybelly,2,Sun Apr 5 22:36:00 2015 UTC,the higher tier marvel abstracts can casually break reality too lmao
OnePunchMan,2zp3wn,angelicable,1 point,Sun Apr 5 22:44:18 2015 UTC,i think with abstract stuff it comes down to a rock-paper-scissory kind of logic

It doesn't matter who or what his enemy is. Saitama's shtick is that he is ALWAYS stronger. I'm willing to bet even if you give him some kind of reality-warping universe destroyer he'll just be stuck in the void of nothingness and non-existence and go ""hey, I wonder if I punch hard enough I can hit this guy in the face""   His punches will create entire universes just with the force behind them, somehow, while simultaneously punching Galactus in the everything."

OnePunchMan,2ziqy2,Eyokiha,5,Wed Mar 18 22:27:22 2015 UTC,"The information about Boros after Saitama's punch is non - existent,so we could only speculate.I'd say that he's dead.After using the ""Planet Buster Cannon"", I don't think he has enough energy to regenerate anymore.And after Saitama's serious punch,the chance of him living is even more slim.He only has enough energy to talk to Saitama and that's it.Even if he is alive,he wouldn't go berserk and killing everyone,because he had fufill his purpose,is to fight with someone stronger than him,and that is Saitama.  EDIT:Misc."
OnePunchMan,2ziqy2,KushDealer,5,Wed Mar 18 23:28:45 2015 UTC,"Canonically Boros is labeled dead, and for good reasons. There is however a chance that Metal Knight have retrieved his corpse. What that may mean is up to speculation."
OnePunchMan,2ziqy2,WickeDanneh,1 point,Thu Mar 19 01:03:39 2015 UTC,"Boros comes back as a cyborg and gets sliced up by Future Speed of Sound Sonic who is also bald, mysteriously"
OnePunchMan,2ziqy2,Etonet,0,Thu Mar 26 06:40:59 2015 UTC,"Heh,I knew that someone would post this.If Metal Knight did retrieved Boros's corpse,there's no way that he could bring Boros back to life,or actually do anything about it.Boros is an alien,his biology system is unfamiliar,and researching it could cost A LOT of time and money.And he lost his arms,lower half and his eye.His body is basically pulverized from the sheer power of the punches that Saitama gave him.His inner organs must've looked like oatmeal,making it impossible to research.He has been injured so much that his body can't even regenerate itself.But I could be wrong.This is a manga after all,anything can happen."
OnePunchMan,2ziqy2,KushDealer,3,Thu Mar 19 04:34:06 2015 UTC,"ATTENTION! SPOILER:  Metal Knight seems to be extremely smart and extremely powerful. Once he got interested in Saitama he did some research and quickly came to the conclusion that Saitama is above S class. Even though he, compared to everyone else, has the best idea of how powerful Saitama is, he still says: ""On the off chance that he can challenge me I'll observe him for now"". Because he himself seems to be lacking the physical capability to fight someone like Saitama he is a tactician and a very smart one at that. Just look at how fast he rebuilt the city. If there is anyone who could use Boros or his corpse in one way or another it is definitely Metal Knight and since Boros is a parody of DBZ characters I think it's very likely that we will see Metal Boros in the future."
OnePunchMan,2ziqy2,Bananakidman,0,Fri Mar 20 02:49:45 2015 UTC,"Well,even if Metal Knight DID turn Boros into a cyborg,the chance that Metal Boros has the power equal to the original Boros is very slim.Let me say it again: Boros lost his arms,lower half and his eye.It would be near impossible for Metal Knight to restore his power back the way it was.BUT,I could be seriously wrong.ONE could've just let Boros vaporize from the sheer power of the punch.But,instead,ONE left Boros badly damaged, but still somewhat alive.ONE did that to show the readers the fact that Saitama's punch,although extremely powerful,is just a portion of his strength,showing the readers that Saitama is capitalized STRONG.But,ONE could left Boros corpse so that it could contribute something to the storyline later.All we can do now is speculate.Although I think the folks at OPM wikia should fix Boros status from Deceased to Unknown."
OnePunchMan,2ziqy2,KushDealer,2,Fri Mar 20 03:42:37 2015 UTC,Was Metal Frieza weaker or stronger than normal Frieza? I don't see why it would be unlikely for a parody of shonen tropes to do something like this.
OnePunchMan,2ziqy2,Bananakidman,1 point,Fri Mar 20 22:11:06 2015 UTC,"I didn't say that I couldn't happen in OPM.I stated that the fact that Boros could contribute to the storyline later in the end of my comment.What I want to say in my comment is that,in my opinion,reviving Boros is a difficult job,if not impossible to do.BUT,this is a manga,everything can happen.I could be seriously wrong.And I would be pleased if I'm wrong."
OnePunchMan,2ziqy2,KushDealer,0,Sat Mar 21 04:33:59 2015 UTC,"Could remake him into a cyborg, if he's still alive for some reason, which I doubt."

OnePunchMan,2z9esi,IamRem,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:54:06 2015 UTC,"/u/IamRem answered some question you've stated above,but not all.Because of that,I will try to answer all of your questions based on my knowledge.   First, is there any timeline showing where different issues of ONE vs RW match up? Even just a couple match ups, like which issues start the arcs.   I didn't quite understand the ""timeline"" part,mainly because of my limited vocabulary.But about the ""issues"" part (I will just assume that ""issue"" means chapter),listing it will take a very long time,and I'm busy right now so I will list the chapters which starts different arcs,both the ONE and RW version later.   Where does the current RW (#64) line up with the ONE?   Answered by /u/IamRem   I also noticed ONE hasn't had any new comics since Dec (#98), does anyone know what's up with that?   Well,ONE is currently working on a manga called Mob Psycho 100.Unlike the original OPM- which ONE only draws for fun,hence the bad drawing-this manga is published on Urasunday,and he gets money for publishing it.So he has to move the original OPM aside to focus on Mob Psycho 100.Also,the newest chapter is chapter #99,not #98 mate.   Has the RW ever caught up to ONE? Does it take a break until there are more ONE issues put out?   The RW has never caught up with ONE's version because of the time it takes to draw the RW is significantly longer than the original.So the RW will most likely never catches up with the original,except when the original has a prolonged hiatus or the original version's material has ended.  I will try to update you with the ""match-ups"" part when I have the time.  Edit #1:Misc grammar error fixed"
OnePunchMan,2z9esi,KushDealer,1 point,Tue Mar 17 10:19:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, thank you.  Since you seem to be very knowledgeable on the matter, maybe you could answer a couple more. Does ONE make anything from Murata's rewrite in Jump? Or the new anime that's been contracted?  Seems like that would incentivise him to work on it more.  Or does he at least have most creative control over the the rewrite or anime?"
OnePunchMan,2z9esi,KushDealer,2,Tue Mar 17 17:34:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply.I got a little busy.Ok,let's do this,shall we?   Does ONE make anything from Murata's rewrite in Jump? Or the new anime that's been contracted?   ONE does receive commission from the RW.He is the creator of the original webcomic that the manga is based on after all.Same goes with the anime.   Or does he at least have most creative control over the the rewrite or anime?   Since ONE did attend the meeting on the production of the anime,he might play a big part in the creative department.I'm not entirely sure about the RW though.But I'm sure that he had made some contributions to the RW."
OnePunchMan,2z9esi,KushDealer,1 point,Wed Mar 18 05:04:01 2015 UTC,"Alright, so I have my first afternoon off in 2 months today so I decided to work on the ""match - ups"" for you.Sorry for taking WAY too long to do this.Also,chapters 4 - 27 are missing in the original version so House of Evolution Arc (Starting at chapter 7 in the RW version), Paradise Group Arc (Starting at chapter 12 in the RW version), Meteor Arc  (Starting at chapter 21 in the RW version) and the first half of the Sea King Arc (The Sea King Arc starts at chapter 23 in the RW) are non - existence, so the list should be shorter than I expected it to be.  Garou Arc in the RW starts at chapter 30  Garou arc in the original starts at chapter 33  King Arc in the RW starts at chapter 37  King Arc in the Original starts at chapter 42  Garou Arc in the RW version starts at chapter 39  Garou Arc in the original starts at chapter 45  This should be enough.And again, sorry for the late reply."

OnePunchMan,2yj7v8,Justiceinthefield,6,Tue Mar 10 16:10:41 2015 UTC,"You know, you pretty much described why I like OPM and why I find my self so attracted to it. I mean you can sum up OPM as a manga with a guy that ends everything in one punch but its more than that and the fact that Saitama can win every battle becomes mute because in the end, its not about the Characters winning/losing the fights, its about the Characters."
OnePunchMan,2yj7v8,Onihikage,5,Tue Mar 10 21:16:41 2015 UTC,"I knew this would go over well, glad you did it! Great post :D"
OnePunchMan,2yj7v8,Cryptic_shadow,4,Wed Mar 11 02:07:40 2015 UTC,"eh,  The fact that his shounen style intense-training-regiment-fueled-only-on-willpower-and-a-desire-to-help-save-people   I disagree with this, everyone seems to think of saitama as you say the ultimate good guy, and that he got strong to help people.   I see it alot differently, in his origin story hes a depressed guy, no one seems to want him for work, hes so depressed he doesn't care if he gets killed. He sees the ball chinned boy, tries to talk himself out of saving this uncute kid, but he does it anyways, sure that kindess but is the selfless kind that any hero would do or more of a common sense sort of kindness, because he even questions himself ""wtf am i doing"" he would have walked away most likely if crabman hadnt shown up( but then we wouldnt have OPM). Plus he thinks minor things like nipple drawing isnt something someone should get killed for. He then says he remembers that he wanted to be a hero.  He fights and defeats crab man which he finds thrilling, something to live for. But it wasn't from saving someone it was from a more selfish desire, the thrill of fighting the life and death sort of thing, he needs it, it give him purpose. You can see it in how he finds his fights, on the news after it already happened, a realish hero wouldnt wait in his house till something happened you would see him patrolling looking to prevent things. He does it as a hobby, and is quite indifferent when there is a large losses of life.   As he gained his powers it seems to me his emotions have dulled alot, he gains no more satisfaction from fights, he one punches vaccine man and says FUUUCCCCK. Not because a whole town was wiped out but because the fight ended again in one punch.He one punchs giant strong man guy and he ends up wiping a town and just says whoops. Punches a meteorite, destroys the whole city, meh. He says it himself hes not a hero because he wants to be liked by the people he had his own reasons which is that fire that burned inside him when he was at his lowest, the adrenaline rush from fighting crab man in a life risking situation. You can see this want for adrenaline in the earthpeople chapter what he dreams about. And then his disappointment when he one shots mole king or whatever his name was.   I dont see saitama as any kinder than any other normal person.He is just much more indefferent, very mellow most likely because he lost some of his emotions. although you could say he might be gaining a bit of his emotions back ever since he first met genos.   But as i was saying saitama isnt this hero because he wanted to save people,or because he is super kind, hes is more selfish than that he want good fights., he wants to feel alive in this boring world. This strength isnt a blessing its a curse to him, one that might possibly lead him back into his past depression.  There was more stuff i wanted to say more examples and stuff but... i forgot them :( But ya not your regular hero, he is more of a parody of shounen mangas but also shounen readers of dragon ball z ish mangas. he wants awesome cool fights but... they always end after one punch.

OnePunchMan,2yc839,The_super_civilian,1 point,Sun Mar 8 17:26:08 2015 UTC,I always wonder whos stronger. But In Boros has more feats. Like kicking Saitama to the moon.

OnePunchMan,2yc839,Purido,1 point,Sun Mar 8 19:08:31 2015 UTC,I also seem to recall hearing the ONE considers Boros and Garuo equal power wise? Though that could just be a rumor that's spread.
OnePunchMan,2yc839,Lareit,1 point,Mon Mar 9 14:13:59 2015 UTC,We will sadly never know since Boros got turned to puddy. And I mean Garuo had NO chance aginst saitama. Noone does...
OnePunchMan,2yc839,Zeru_Fenrir,2,Tue Mar 10 08:10:55 2015 UTC,"I personally think Asura Rhino would win that fight. AR crushes Genos as if he's not even there, and while Genos most likely has upgraded himself to be stronger when he faces Sea King, he actually seemed to have the edge over SK prior to getting blind sided and then sacrificing himself for the kid.  Also Saitama actually seemed to think AR might be worth paying attention to. He didn't seem to give 2 shits about SK."
OnePunchMan,2yc839,IamRem,1 point,Mon Mar 9 14:15:50 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same, but someone pointed out that Genos's incineration cannon dehydrated sea king. Of course, AR wasn't in his berserker mode when he fought Genos, but like you said Genos is stronger by the time Sea King rolls up. I'd still back AR, but I'm no longer so sure."
OnePunchMan,2yc839,Captain-Turtle,2,Mon Mar 9 14:21:18 2015 UTC,"I'd put Asura Rhino in Dragon class from how he man-handled Genos, who fought on par with the Sea King. I'd also put Beefcake there for pure destructive power.  I'd say Metal Bat vs Sweet Mask  Fubuki vs one of the weaker S class, like Huff Puff Prisoner or Tank Top Master.  Sea King, Sky King and Underground King battle-royal  Boros vs S class would also be amazing I think, and I wouldn't undersell Tatsumaki's power, she casually stopped the ship's barrage, and threw it back at it. Keep in mind the same barrage wiped out a city in a single instant."

OnePunchMan,2y88qg,Keistl,5,Sat Mar 7 15:12:05 2015 UTC,What's wrong with Toei Animations?
OnePunchMan,2y88qg,Leviathanus,21,Sat Mar 7 15:43:08 2015 UTC,"They are fillering out a lot of shit. And animations are sloppy. Soo inconsistent animations, faces, same in one piece, ennies lobby was consistent but recently they're just saving money, greedy pigs. Like look at One Piece. 6 minute, let me repeat, 6 FUCKING MINUTE INTRO EACH EPISODE. Filler fights. At dressrosa, colosseum. Luffy vs Don Chinjao. He made only few blows in manga and the ended it, but in anime it was a lot more blows - made him look weaker. And At Punk Hazard Luffy vs Ceaser clown. Luffy Oneshotted CC in manga. But had a lot of trouble in anime? Like wtf.   Another example is Toriko. Toriko hits somebody = a lot of blood. All blood was fillered out. So 0 dmg in anime. Somebody loses an arm and leg? Don't worry he can't move now, 0 dmg. Just tired. And Toei completely changed Toriko's last animes arc ( manga is ongoing, and epic) Like nothing of that happened in the manga. Basically they ruined Toriko for some money, so kids can watch it. And they aren't doing great job at One Piece either.   Basically Toei is greedy, sloppy and makes bad names for great mangas like One Piece, Toriko. And a lot of filler shit. Look at madhouse. Hunter X Hunter is the best anime - 0 filler. No animation slopiness. Perfect.  EDIT: Hope i answered u lol."
OnePunchMan,2y88qg,Keistl,10,Sat Mar 7 16:00:01 2015 UTC,When a 20 year old DBZ has better animations than new Toriko anime you know they fucked up BIG TIME.
OnePunchMan,2y88qg,Symmanchus,7,Sat Mar 7 16:03:02 2015 UTC,"I could endure with the animations, but Filler shit, and censoring is the biggest WHAT THE FUCK."
OnePunchMan,2y88qg,Onihikage,4,Sat Mar 7 16:04:27 2015 UTC,"While I do agree with the Toei hate, I don't think Madhouse would be a good fit for OPM.   From what I hear they're not too good with adapting ongoing manga. (possibly because they hate filler). Which is one of the reasons the HxH anime was God-tier."
OnePunchMan,2y88qg,jet_10,2,Sat Mar 7 22:10:51 2015 UTC,"I think Madhouse could easily just make one or two amazing seasons and then go dark until there's enough material for more.

Yes,sadly   Is there anywhere else that might have more?   No,sadly  If you want to read the latest OPM chapter,read it at Bato.to.The image quality there is top notch.Also,you can follow the manga you'd like so that whenever a new chapter comes out,you will be notified (you need to make an account to do that though).I personally always read manga at Bato.to so I am not sure about some other sites.   And lastly (possibly most importantly), where can I find out the second a new translation is up?   You can check the Bato.to notifier like I mentioned above.Or you could visit this page http://nerieru-scans.com/ .Nerieru Scans is the  scanlation group that scans OPM .If there's a new chapter coming out,this is the first place that it got posted.The easiest option is to check this subreddit out.We will post the newest news and chapters involving OnePunchMan here 24/7.

OnePunchMan,2y4t3g,miltek,16,Fri Mar 6 13:28:03 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt it.King is mistaken to be Saitama after all.So,according to your logic, King should be Blast right?Also,in the original webcomic version, Mr.Shicchi stated that Blast won't move unless he's given complete freedom on his hero activities.Blast refused to be restrain (probably due to his collateral damage),he also hates to stand out.So yeah,I'm pretty sure that Saitama isn't Blast.Right now,Blast's identity is a complete mystery.But,he WILL show up when the prophecy came true.I can guarantee that.  On a side note,the kid with the cleft chin is not the founder of the Hero Association.His grandfather founded it while he found out that his grandchild is saved by a passing man (Saitama)."

OnePunchMan,2wxwc3,KushDealer,5,Tue Feb 24 02:13:22 2015 UTC,"The mangaka release a chapter once every two weeks,not once a month bro.But it is definitely worth the wait.Also,check out the original webcomic version of the manga here.The content of the original is the same as the redrawn version,the only difference between the two is the art.The original is 99 chapters long,so it should keep you occupied for a while.If you want to read the original,start at chapter 49 since it is the chapter where the redrawn version catches up with the original."
OnePunchMan,2wxwc3,KushDealer,3,Tue Feb 24 05:23:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link. The difference in the art is...significant, but it just makes me appreciate it even more that someone found it so good that they wanted to recreate it. Holy hell is the result impressive looking though. The sense of scale was amazing in that scene where Saitama saw the massive ship for the first time. The following fight was awesome too.    I've decided not to read the original, because I feel the better art makes plot twists, expressions and the story in general to have a bigger effect. I'm a fairly patient guy. Two weeks isn't that bad. It's better than a month and I was ready to wait a month for each chapter already."

OnePunchMan,2ver22,DuckMeYellow,9,Tue Feb 10 15:30:46 2015 UTC,"""Did scrubs like you really think you could stop me?"" I wonder if that's an accurate translation or a little creative freedom on /a/'s part."
OnePunchMan,2ver22,SteakAndNihilism,4,Tue Feb 10 21:01:52 2015 UTC,Ah ONE is pretty easy with his dialogue
OnePunchMan,2ver22,xtkbilly,17,Tue Feb 10 23:40:39 2015 UTC,blub blub lol
OnePunchMan,2ver22,xtkbilly,2,Wed Feb 11 03:57:28 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bit creative, based on what I know of Japanese.  http://galaxyheavyblow.web.fc2.com/99.html  ""Anta-tachi mitai nano ga watashi wo tomarareru wakenai desho""  Anta-tachi = You guys (Not sure, but I think ""anta"" is like ""anata"" except more informal or rude)  mitai nano = Not sure what this part means. ""mitai"" is like ""see"", but i've forgotten ""nano"" and/or what it does/mean. I think it translates to ""looks like""  watashi wo tomarareru = (able to) stop me  wakenai desho = trying to figure out the literal translation. ""wakenai"" is ""reasoning, none"", or ""no reasoning"". ""desho"" usually means ""seems, I think"". Perhaps 'I can't believe""  Putting it all together in that way, I would tranlate it as ""I can't believe you guys thought you could stop me.""  Though I could be totally wrong since (1) I didn't take too many classes of Japanese (four semesters), (2) I'm several years out of practice, (3) there could be some slang, which I have no clue on, (4) I probably pieced that together in reverse since it was already translated to English.  Dunno, but it was fun trying to translate it."
OnePunchMan,2ver22,bellrunner,3,Wed Feb 11 06:01:34 2015 UTC,"I think they translated it exactly what you've just translated,/a/ only put a dank meme internet slang into it to add some humor into their translation.I mean,""scrubs"" sounds a lot better than ""guys"",don't you think?"
OnePunchMan,2ver22,IcecreamDave,1 point,Wed Feb 11 06:17:35 2015 UTC,"Right, hence creative. I don't know what the Japanese slang equivalent calling someone a ""scrub"" would be, or if there is one. It's not a direct translation, but a translation that tries to catch the tone, meaning, and image of the character."
OnePunchMan,2ver22,guppywastaken,2,Wed Feb 11 06:27:41 2015 UTC,Finally!
OnePunchMan,2ver22,reignofraines,2,Tue Feb 10 12:18:32 2015 UTC,"I want her to get beat so bad. How the slug alien was killed, minus the killed part."
OnePunchMan,2v2mnh,Bltholdthet,11,Sat Feb 7 07:10:10 2015 UTC,"Well, we currently don't have any information on how Saitama make money before he went pro.He might get money from his parents,or from a part-time job (being a hero is only his hobby after all). Or maybe he received donations from people who he'd saved (like the old lady who gave him a year's worth of candy).I highly doubt that the author will reveal how he make money since it doesn't contribute anything major to the plot.But if it does appear,It will most likely to be featured in a special chapter.Pardon my grammar."

OnePunchMan,2v2mnh,potatosol,2,Tue Feb 10 05:23:29 2015 UTC,Don't think he's needed to. The area he lives in is really dangerous so its free to live there.
OnePunchMan,2v2mnh,KushDealer,1 point,Thu Feb 12 13:44:34 2015 UTC,"What about money for food,clothing,comics,....?And besides,the fact that Genos gives him money to pay the rent proves that the place he lives in is not free."
OnePunchMan,2v2mnh,Onihikage,1 point,Thu Feb 12 14:18:16 2015 UTC,"I believe Genos pays Saitama money as rent, so consider Saitama to be Genos's landlord, at least while he was living in that abandoned district for free."

OnePunchMan,2v2mnh,Bhupert,0,Mon Mar 9 05:08:55 2015 UTC,"Genos brings the money for rent, and Saitama takes it, but there's no proof that the money is actually used for rent.  And I do believe there's a line that the neighborhood is abandoned, so it wouldn't make sense that there's a landlord collecting rent from a guy in a monster-infested slum."
OnePunchMan,2v2mnh,KushDealer,2,Wed Feb 25 17:49:21 2015 UTC,"About the first part in your post,there's no proof that the money is used elswhere either.Thus,we can't confirm where the money went.The second part of your post is pretty logical.But what if Saitama sent the rent money to the landlord via mail,bank transfer (Saitama does have a bank account after all)?  Sorry for the late reply,cram school waits for no one ya know."
OnePunchMan,2v2mnh,Bhupert,2,Fri Feb 27 09:14:22 2015 UTC,"The bank account is a good point, maybe the bank owns his apartment, or some other major company that expects rent whether the neighborhood is abandoned or not.  But then again maybe we're looking to far into it, and ONE just forgot about the rent entirely."

OnePunchMan,2v2mnh,mrtangelo,2,Fri Feb 27 23:40:29 2015 UTC,well he was a business man before right? maybe he just had a ton of money he was sitting on cause he had nothing to spend it on. that plus a part time job or something
OnePunchMan,2v2mnh,KushDealer,3,Sun Feb 8 02:04:00 2015 UTC,"Saitama was never a business man,dude.I think you got it wrong.My best bet that you got it wrong in this chapter,am I correct?If so,read the chapter above carefully.You'll notice."

OnePunchMan,2tbtek,Metagen,5,Sat Jan 24 08:38:06 2015 UTC,That's the running gag in the manga.
OnePunchMan,2st4xc,MakaiTenshi,18,Sun Jan 18 06:04:46 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is the number of chapters and the inconsistency of releases. While it would be an amazing anime, the producers would struggle to be able to release content weekly and when they did, the anime would not last very long and would quickly catch up to the manga. So in their eyes it would not be worth making. Maybe when the manga finishes, or goes on for so long there is enough content to make a decent length anime from, they may possibly do it. I'd give the anime a watch if they did though."
OnePunchMan,2st4xc,professionaljackass,4,Sun Jan 18 16:27:24 2015 UTC,I agree most likely if they are gonna make a anime they will do it after it is finished or a massive amount of chapters are released
OnePunchMan,2st4xc,lulzmort,5,Sun Jan 18 20:19:26 2015 UTC,"I could see them doing a short series leading up to the alien invasion arc if they included some of the side-chapter material, but it is probably a better idea to wait until there is more material before they animate it.  An OVA series might be better too if they wanted to keep animation quality high."
OnePunchMan,2st4xc,Zeru_Fenrir,5,Mon Jan 19 00:38:18 2015 UTC,"I think it would be better if they made some movies of the arcs instead, and shorts inbetween to explain some of the character relationships"
OnePunchMan,2st4xc,potetman123,4,Fri Feb 6 14:36:26 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't it be better to do that style of short 4-6 minute episodes? That would work better for the punch lines, and prevent episodes of nothing but filler, or 10 chapters in one episode."
OnePunchMan,2st4xc,Talvasha,6,Sun Jan 25 15:37:28 2015 UTC,Man i just want to see that one sparring scene with Genos in animated form. Or maybe some stupid slapstick jokes like him punching Asura Rhino and it doing a Team Rocket .o

TL;DR:A new chapter will be release biweekly.If the release date is abnormally late,expect a bonus chapter"
OnePunchMan,2sm1in,KushDealer,12,Fri Jan 16 08:37:16 2015 UTC,"They also both have redundant names about their speed. Genos would probably lol at Lightspeed Flash too.

OnePunchMan,2s8a5e,Nitrosium,2,Tue Jan 13 03:20:39 2015 UTC,i wonder how long the fight will last
OnePunchMan,2rvp2j,uduchi2nd,5,Fri Jan 9 18:21:26 2015 UTC,"I'm throwing money at the screen, and nothing's happening."
OnePunchMan,2rvp2j,Nitrosium,4,Sat Jan 10 02:40:49 2015 UTC,Did you try punching it?
OnePunchMan,2rvp2j,PheonixUpper,3,Wed Jan 14 03:34:51 2015 UTC,How good are you art-wise? I would just buy a white apron and make it myself.
OnePunchMan,2rqnqj,JustOnePunch,13,Thu Jan 8 13:16:42 2015 UTC,"There is no ""One Punch"".   I think even when Genos becomes a technological singularity Saitama will still be infinitely stronger."
OnePunchMan,2rqnqj,Nitrosium,5,Fri Jan 9 05:09:01 2015 UTC,Genos is an eternal jobber so no he won't become the second strongest.
OnePunchMan,2rqnqj,Bananakidman,4,Thu Jan 8 13:54:43 2015 UTC,I think it would be cool if he actually find how Saitama become like that but decide against using that method because it's boring; or because of respect to his master.
OnePunchMan,2rqnqj,Raidend,6,Thu Jan 8 16:24:28 2015 UTC,"I feel this verse is like Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist. 'And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.' only a little  more forcefully  So if you want crabs you become a crab man. If you really want to become strong you become really strong."
OnePunchMan,2rqnqj,shashashaha,2,Thu Jan 8 18:28:27 2015 UTC,"That's the theme of the entire series... That means Saitama will finally be defeated at the end, because that's the overarching conflict."
OnePunchMan,2rqnqj,Nitrosium,5,Thu Jan 8 20:49:19 2015 UTC,"The conflict isn't that he wants to be defeated, but that he wants to remember the thrill of fighting.   At the end of the series he'll meet another person just as strong as him and finally have a good fight, but he most definitely will not lose. That would make the whole manga pointless and probably upset a lot of fans."
OnePunchMan,2rqnqj,KushDealer,7,Thu Jan 8 21:55:55 2015 UTC,"I have read ONE's version (like 12 times already) and Genos is still the same, only a little faster due to the new parts.And we don't know for sure if Saitama is the strongest being in the universe yet.The universe is a very big place ya know.Besides,Genos is a cyborg.Unless he got his hands on some kind of legendary parts, his strength will never be able to match Saitama's.Pardon my grammar."

There really doesn't seem to be a rule about the releases, but he does give a date at the end of each chapter when he expects the next chapter to be released. He is, however, known for not sticking with this date."
OnePunchMan,2rm511,KushDealer,2,Wed Jan 7 12:16:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, Murata sometimes stick to the date very well actually.He usually release a chapter biweekly.When he isn't sticking to the date, he'll most likely release a bonus chapter (he released one in last November) to compensate for the fans.As for the ""known for not sticking with the release"" part,that title goes to Kentaro Miura - mangaka of the Berserk series. He is INFAMOUS for his extremely inconsistant release date."

OnePunchMan,2rg23h,The_super_civilian,3,Tue Jan 6 01:49:29 2015 UTC,I think 40 pages is a bit optimistic and unrealistic. I'm glad whenever either manga updates.

OnePunchMan,2rg23h,Pirsqed,2,Tue Jan 6 03:06:33 2015 UTC,"There are lots of side stories and partial updates to chapters. If you look at Batoto you'll see stuff like ""chapter 32.5"" which I'm guessing Mangareader is just ignoring."
OnePunchMan,2rg23h,xtkbilly,1 point,Tue Jan 6 04:09:55 2015 UTC,"I think whoever is doing the scans is (for whatever reason) grouping the small chapter arcs into one ""chapter"".  Actually, just checked, it looks like the chapters are not split in the manga itself. The King Arc (chapter 37 on the batoto) has it's first page show ""37th Punch"", but the other chapters after don't have any short of title on them. So despite them coming out on different weeks (I'm assuming), they are considered one chapter, and the scanlators (or uploader) seem to be keeping suit with that. Although MangaUpdates lists it as chapter 59..."
OnePunchMan,2rg23h,Pirsqed,2,Tue Jan 6 19:56:21 2015 UTC,"I guess MangaFox has the weird naming scheme I was thinking of.   Interestingly, the official Japanese page numbers them like MangaUpdates.

And if you remember how he did in the Hero entrance exams then i doubt this training will do much for him. He'd probably finish it in a few seconds. Also we've never seen him do it. There is also no sign of him doing a progression (making the exercise harder, more weights, or bigger handicap). So he probably just did his routine until he suddenly peaked and then stopped doing it after awhile."

Trying to look up more information for Dangan Tenshi Fanclub though, and I'm getting almost nothing. Not up on Batato, and it's not listed on Baka-Updates, but the cross-over is. So I'm confused on the whole thing."

Both Saitama and Lady Himiko are great, unique heroes and have several similarities. Saitama being who he is would probably make a team-up fight kinda impossible, but I would still love to see at least a one-shot crossover!  That single panel gets me hype just looking at it..."
OnePunchMan,2r2u04,BlackLandon,1 point,Mon Jan 5 08:17:44 2015 UTC,Pretty new to OPM here. Are any of the mangas ONE participate in set in the same universe?

OnePunchMan,2qqcyu,Metagen,4,Mon Dec 29 19:03:21 2014 UTC,"Massive difference in art, where the one made by One is worse. but that's about it. pretty much exactly the same otherwise."
OnePunchMan,2qqcyu,Spuick,5,Mon Dec 29 18:56:06 2014 UTC,"The original is drawn by ONE in his spare time and is starting the arc after the one the redrawn is one.   Huge difference in art quality obviously. The original updates randomly with not pattern really. In the redrawn manga we get bonus, or special, chapters which are nice.  No difference in story or dialogue really. Show support the original so hopefully ONE will hopefully dedicate more time to it."
OnePunchMan,2qqcyu,DuckMeYellow,4,Mon Dec 29 21:11:22 2014 UTC,"There are tiny differences, like Atomic Samurais sword guard for example edit: said hilt"

OnePunchMan,2qqcyu,xtkbilly,1 point,Tue Dec 30 10:40:08 2014 UTC,"The version by ONE is the original and looking at Murata's update schedule, the original is probably like 2-3 years further in the story."

OnePunchMan,2qogje,4f5g7h,12,Mon Jan 19 09:01:50 2015 UTC,"If you would've read the original it's stated that unlike anyone else he broke his natural limit (which was below average before) and if I'm not mistaken all the people who became monsters were obsessing about things but didn't actually had a goal in mind. Crabrante for example didn't want to become half crab half man, he just ate too many crabs. And since it looks like you haven't read the original I don't want to spoil too much about Garou but he isn't like the other monsters."
OnePunchMan,2qogje,Bananakidman,5,Thu Jan 1 00:57:43 2015 UTC,"http://www.mangatown.com/manga/onepunch_man/c020.6/11.html  Him breaking his limter, I know it says bad tooth in the end but I'm sure this was him breaking his limits."
OnePunchMan,2qogje,NightSage,12,Tue Jan 27 00:10:31 2015 UTC,"Wow.This is one of the best fan explanation of Saitama's power that I've seen for quite while.I think that he's actually gained a lot of power from training non-stop for 3 years though.But,after reading this, I think that what makes him really strong is the obsession of being a hero.The two adds up and makes him incredibly powerful and incredibly bald.Anyhow,good job OP.Upvoted.Hope this gets more attention."
OnePunchMan,2qogje,KushDealer,4,Mon Dec 29 05:29:38 2014 UTC,"http://www.mangahere.co/manga/onepunch_man/c020.6/11.html  This is the moment where he actually expresses that he wants to ""overcome his limits"" rather than simply become a superhero. He obviously has superhero level strength and speed already by this point (as shown by the damage on the car from when he saves the child just before), but as he dedicates himself to overcoming limits, the next pages show him with his trademark undetailed Saitama face, newfound ability to take on the pullcord monster, and hair loss soon after.   This is the page that made me realize his power isn't his strength, speed, or invulnerability, per se...his power is that he has no limits. The fact that the following panels are labelled ""the key to his power"" drive the point home."
OnePunchMan,2qogje,AgaveBlue,6,Mon Jan 19 08:04:08 2015 UTC,"I've heard this a few times, here and there. Of all the theories about Saitama's power, this one seems closest to the truth. The OPM universe seems to be one where a sapient being can change itself dramatically just through sheer force of will."

OnePunchMan,2my2cv,midnightmealtime,5,Fri Nov 21 02:57:43 2014 UTC,Lol let's cross that bridge when we get to it.
OnePunchMan,2my2cv,SlushyFTK,3,Fri Nov 21 03:18:33 2014 UTC,"I think the fancy art updates pretty slow as well. Also considering that fancy art often elaborates the scenes from the real manga too, e.g. a fight in real manga that takes a small comic panel space could be expanded into into a couple epic pages with beautiful drawings in the murata's version. Obviously drawing the fancy arts takes more time than drawing the real manga too.  So in my opinion, although it is not impossible for the fancy art to catch up with the real manga, I doubt it will likely to happen in near future."
OnePunchMan,2my2cv,DiableJambe,4,Fri Nov 21 11:25:47 2014 UTC,I hope Bakuman happens between One and Murata.
OnePunchMan,2my2cv,IamRem,3,Fri Nov 21 16:37:11 2014 UTC,Thinking the same here! Does somebody have any info on the success of the Manga in Japan? An Anime release would make me cry tears of joy
OnePunchMan,2my2cv,Iputak,2,Fri Nov 21 19:12:48 2014 UTC,"I would not want an anime release anytime too soon. I think an anime would catch up to the manga quite quickly.  The manga had 2.2million copies in circulation in November 2013. It had 3.4million copies in May 2014. And as of November 2014, there are 4.5million copies in circulation. Shueisha had published 4 volumes by Nov '13 and 6 volumes by May '14 with a 7th volume appearing to be scheduled for December 2014. So that's like an average of 550k copies per volume in Nov 2013 rising to an average of 750k copies per volume this month. Of course, I don't know the actual figures of how many copies were sold of each volume so this average is the best I can do.  As far as success, a quick google search gave me a nice chart. The top 30 selling manga based on their sales figures from Nov./18/2013 to May/18/2014. One Punch Man was 17th on that chart with 1,683,131 in that time period. I'll tell you a few others that were on the chart.    Standing Manga Title Copies Sold in Time Period    1st Attack on Titan 8,342,268   2nd One Piece 4,936,855   4th Naruto 3,247,920   10th Nisekoi 2,418,041   15th Bleach 1,774,694   17th One-Punch Man 1,683,131   20th Shokugeki No Soma 1,394,312   26th Tokyo Ghoul 1,190,902   30th Kangoku Gakuen 946,013    So it seems like OPM is doing quite well for itself. Successful enough for an anime, I think, but imo, I'd like for there to be more volumes and chapters out for it before it gets an anime."

OnePunchMan,2is7h4,meDrifter,3,Fri Oct 10 11:00:24 2014 UTC,Nope not at all. I want him to have some latent scaredy-cat power that comes out when he thinks he's truly about to die.

I'm thinking of making some more for my personal favorite character, Speed of Sound Sonic, but it's a bit more difficult to find images I can use for him without them turning out weird (I.e. the creepy smile wallpaper I have for him, while a lot of the 'blur' is from the actual manga to highlight his movement speed, some is also from having to resize and crop the image awkwardly). Like I said in my other comment though, if you have any panels/pages from the manga you'd want to have as a wall PM me and I'll make it for you."

OnePunchMan,2g8yt4,Photark,2,Sun Sep 14 07:39:46 2014 UTC,It's probably going to end up with Genos defeating the thing and King gets the credits somehow.
OnePunchMan,2g8yt4,Silent_Strike,2,Sat Sep 13 19:20:46 2014 UTC,"Having cought up with the manga and not getting a chapter a week as i'm used to with others really sucks, but then i read the new chapter, see Saitama's face and it's all good"

OnePunchMan,2fwwol,FallenWind,2,Wed Sep 10 02:07:15 2014 UTC,a one punch man anime made by trigger would be pretty bitchin. that or studio bones
OnePunchMan,2fwwol,mrtangelo,1 point,Thu Sep 11 16:02:29 2014 UTC,"Bones would be much better, so far what Trigger has made has been more awesome because of an amazing in-house story, not so much the animation.   Bones is the studio with the killer animation."
OnePunchMan,2fwwol,scotbud123,2,Sat Sep 13 06:36:38 2014 UTC,I think Madhouse could do some justice too. HxH is was splendidly made.

It should be relatively cheap to produce, since ONE doesn't need to be given a cut.  Eh, give it a few years I guess.  But I wouldn't even be unhappy with seasons of filler when the anime catches up to the manga.    Spoiler alert for the filler:  He wins in one punch."
OnePunchMan,2fwwol,SteakAndNihilism,3,Wed Sep 10 06:07:18 2014 UTC,Because they would have like 6-7 eps. Remember that most of chapters are 6-10 pages.  Also to work it needs amazing graphic which is something that devolved in anime in last decade.

OnePunchMan,2f7rwp,DiableJambe,2,Tue Sep 2 00:46:25 2014 UTC,He says that when he closes his eyes someone comes and kills it (dragon or disaster level monsters which are pretty strong). So my theory is that when he closes his eyes the inner monster comes out and kills everything. After the fight (or massacre) his inner demon goes back to sleep and he has no recollection of what happened so he always asumes that someone else fights and not himself.  I mean he somehow got into the Hero Association which means he had to take this entry tests.
OnePunchMan,2f7rwp,Leviathanus,8,Tue Sep 2 12:54:25 2014 UTC,I think he got the credit for all the things saitama did before he became a professional hero as he was there when it happened.
OnePunchMan,2f7rwp,professionaljackass,1 point,Tue Sep 2 13:02:56 2014 UTC,I don't think that everytime some disaster or dragon level monster appears Saitama and he was there. Would be a very odd coincidence.
OnePunchMan,2f7rwp,Leviathanus,2,Tue Sep 2 13:04:47 2014 UTC,It only was like 5 times. Crazy coincidence? Ya. But they live in the same neighborhood I think.

OnePunchMan,2f7rwp,EvilGrandpa,6,Wed Sep 3 23:43:48 2014 UTC,my theory is you haven't read the original comic
OnePunchMan,2f7rwp,ExtremelyJaded,-1,Tue Sep 2 19:31:34 2014 UTC,What logic is that? It's a reddit about the new onepunchman and not the original. If I read the original i would know and wouldn't put my theory out there now would I? What logic what logic....
OnePunchMan,2f7rwp,Leviathanus,1 point,Wed Sep 3 07:52:36 2014 UTC,I don't think King took the entry test :D

OnePunchMan,2arv1t,Luffy-24,5,Wed Jul 16 00:25:29 2014 UTC,"Are you talking about different versions of a chapter? e.g. chapter 35v2 and 35v3?  The artist most of the times only release few pages instead of whole chapter at once. He sometimes even modify previous drawing, or just even slip extra page in previous release. The translator then will update that chapter into versions. Just to indicate that it's updated.  If you're talking about two version of the whole manga itself, there are the original one and the redrawn one. The original manga is by artist called ONE. The drawing is relatively shittier, and IIRC it started as a side project. But the story got so interesting, that another artist called Murata Yusuke (with ridiculously good drawing) asked to redraw the manga to ONE via Twitter. ONE agreed. So here we are with the original and redrawn version of OnePunch-Man.  The original manga is already at chapter 95: http://www.batoto.net/comic/_/comics/onepunch-man-original-r9123 Warning: STORY SPOILER if you only want to follow the redrawn version.  Edit: If you wanna compare, this (redrawn) chapter 35v3 is equal to chapter 40 in the original series: http://www.batoto.net/read/_/171724/onepunch-man-original_ch40_by_anonymous"
OnePunchMan,2arv1t,Luffy-24,1 point,Wed Jul 16 00:43:40 2014 UTC,Thanks.
OnePunchMan,2arv1t,Luffy-24,1 point,Wed Jul 16 00:46:50 2014 UTC,Wait so which versions difference were you asking? Just curious lol.
OnePunchMan,2arv1t,moralguardian,2,Wed Jul 16 00:49:51 2014 UTC,I was asking about the different versions of the chapter. I didn't know that the the artist and author were different so thanks for that too.
OnePunchMan,2arv1t,maradoification,2,Wed Jul 16 00:55:11 2014 UTC,OOH KILL'EM
OnePunchMan,2arv1t,maradoification,2,Tue Jul 15 21:53:30 2014 UTC,Does anyone who knows japanese have any knowledge of when the author will continue the original series? Has he stated a time or anything?
OnePunchMan,2arv1t,TheBaris,2,Tue Jul 22 14:07:20 2014 UTC,"I don't know Japanese. But since no one reply you, my best guess is from this website http://galaxyheavyblow.web.fc2.com/index.html  If you google translate the page, in the bottom of the page it says something like this ""2014 7/10 3p update"". My guess, it will get updated either on July 10th or October 7th. Who knows..  Edit: I just realize he added some new page in chapter 95! Cause I remember last time I checked that chapter 95, the last page was Spoilers. So I have to thank you for asking this question, making me check that website :)"
OnePunchMan,2arv1t,WickeDanneh,2,Thu Jul 24 22:22:59 2014 UTC,"Yes, those are new pages thank god. Glad to see he's not forgetting about it completely."

OnePunchMan,284iqn,DiableJambe,4,Sat Jun 14 11:40:21 2014 UTC,"...Of course he just held his breath.  That's so Saitama.  And fucking jumping from the moon to the earth in seconds, holy shit!"
OnePunchMan,284iqn,SteakAndNihilism,7,Sun Jun 15 06:30:42 2014 UTC,i think i should forget this series exists for a couple years  such short chapters
OnePunchMan,284iqn,ExtremelyJaded,2,Sat Jun 14 13:41:48 2014 UTC,The alien just took a couple punches. Guess he's not one punch man anymore.
OnePunchMan,284iqn,pokedrawer,5,Sat Jun 14 17:51:03 2014 UTC,Normal punches.
OnePunchMan,284iqn,meh100,4,Sat Jun 14 19:10:37 2014 UTC,The previous punches have all looked pretty normal to me.
OnePunchMan,284iqn,pokedrawer,4,Sat Jun 14 23:56:43 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I kind of was annoyed when I first saw consecutive punches in the original manga, because it seems like it ruined the whole premise.  But right now he's throwing ""Normal"" punches, which are not serious punches.  He's just so lazy that he doesn't want to exert the effort of hitting someone seriously.  Also, the only reason Boros is surviving even these punches is because he has super regeneration."
OnePunchMan,284iqn,SteakAndNihilism,4,Sun Jun 15 06:28:39 2014 UTC,"He never throws serious punches.  Also, he doesn't have toon force which lets him kill everyone magically with one punch. He's just really fucking strong. Thats why everyone died till now with only a punch. But Boros can survive a 10 cm hole in his body so he didnt die, yet."
OnePunchMan,284iqn,TheBaris,1 point,Sun Jun 15 06:37:43 2014 UTC,"Well, he has a series of attacks called his ""Serious"" series.  Though they aren't really serious, that's just the name for them."

OnePunchMan,284iqn,MadeWithAlchemy,1 point,Sat Jun 14 14:24:53 2014 UTC,Consecutive normal punches.  oh my god my sides
OnePunchMan,284iqn,snizznuke,1 point,Sun Jun 15 16:38:13 2014 UTC,"Woooo! Next chapter is out on my birthday (7/10)!   ...And we all know what that means...  Thanks for making my 16.083th birthday extra special, Saitama."
OnePunchMan,27fo1u,RoronoaJump,2,Fri Jun 6 01:40:58 2014 UTC,"Posting this because there was confusion earlier that made it SEEM like it wasn't coming this month, but alas it is"
OnePunchMan,27fo1u,LucciDVergo,2,Fri Jun 6 01:41:25 2014 UTC,What chapters does this volume encompass?
OnePunchMan,27fo1u,LucciDVergo,2,Mon Jun 9 22:26:03 2014 UTC,16 through 20 and has two extra bonus chapters  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-Punch_Man#Volume_list
OnePunchMan,26v8hz,andaruu,7,Fri May 30 11:43:46 2014 UTC,So... our punchman guy can even breathe on the moon ?
OnePunchMan,26v8hz,pouja,3,Fri May 30 15:21:21 2014 UTC,"Let's wait and see till next chapter, but I'm more impressed that he can ignore the vacuum."
OnePunchMan,26v8hz,MadeWithAlchemy,2,Fri May 30 17:06:37 2014 UTC,"I just realized this too. Now, I need to finish that guy fast.. I can't be late for dinner."
OnePunchMan,26v8hz,Onepanman,5,Fri May 30 18:04:22 2014 UTC,Is there anything on page 17?
OnePunchMan,26v8hz,bentke466,2,Fri May 30 21:32:07 2014 UTC,No.
OnePunchMan,26v8hz,slightlights,3,Wed Jun 4 05:27:53 2014 UTC,Holy heck! He got hit to the moon. Pretty awesome fight sequence though we are missing some input from saikama.
OnePunchMan,26v8hz,MadeWithAlchemy,3,Fri May 30 17:05:27 2014 UTC,"OK, I don't remember him being on the moon in ONE's version.  Does anyone else?"
OnePunchMan,26v8hz,SteakAndNihilism,4,Fri May 30 18:02:15 2014 UTC,"Nah, I think it's creative input from the artist of this version - which I don't mind. To be honest it's quite awesome though it depends on how they deal with there being no air and complete vacuum."
OnePunchMan,26v8hz,MadeWithAlchemy,5,Fri May 30 21:55:05 2014 UTC,I think anyone who expects Saitama to react to the lack of oxygen or vacuum is going to be extremely disappointed.  It would be really out of character for him to react to or comment on that kind of thing.  Odds are he'll just ignore it like he does everything else.
OnePunchMan,26v8hz,SteakAndNihilism,2,Fri May 30 22:26:35 2014 UTC,The only reason I hate this chapter besides the fact that it strays from the original is that Saitama got damaged. This really fucks with what his power level is when used for fights on /r/whowouldwin.
OnePunchMan,26v8hz,Toranious,3,Fri May 30 22:33:08 2014 UTC,"I dont think he took damage at all, it was just Boros who thought he did. His expression is probably like that because he's bored or something. Also he sent to the moon at the end he was pretty chill about it."
OnePunchMan,26v8hz,TheBaris,2,Sat May 31 09:49:16 2014 UTC,"If you're upset about this chapter's effect on his status in /r/whowouldwin you shouldn't be.  This won't do much to his durability.  It will, however, undercut people who say ""Goku blows up the planet and OP man can't breathe lol"""
OnePunchMan,26v8hz,SteakAndNihilism,2,Mon Jun 2 02:18:41 2014 UTC,"A bit late, but I don't think I've ever seen Goku/Superman punch something to the moon (although I have no doubt they could). One of the criticisms of Saitama is that his enemies aren't on the same level as Superman or Superman's enemies - does this close the gap somewhat?"
OnePunchMan,26v8hz,Moominpappa,1 point,Wed Jun 4 07:50:27 2014 UTC,Wow um this is getting pretty intense and why can he breath on the on moon
OnePunchMan,26v8hz,burnt_pumpkin,1 point,Fri May 30 21:50:55 2014 UTC,It was great dude! Too bad is was really short. Waiting for the next!

OnePunchMan,253l2i,Ssj2luffy,7,Fri May 9 03:12:40 2014 UTC,I think the real next chapter this week was delayed and so we had a filler chapter but the chapters come out bi weekly I think im kinda new also but yeah so um every 2 weeks a new chapter comes out. Damn I even confused myself sorry im no good.
OnePunchMan,253l2i,burnt_pumpkin,7,Fri May 9 03:44:34 2014 UTC,"There's no set schedule. The artist, (Murata) is also working on other projects, which take up a lot of his time. Right now he's doing some work with Toei, (a major animation company in Japan, if you're not familiar with them) and so the most recent date was missed, and we got that side chapter."
OnePunchMan,253l2i,Pirsqed,3,Fri May 9 06:15:51 2014 UTC,"Its usually 2-3 weeks apart but there have been a couple times that 5-7 weeks have gone by without an update. I dont know about you, but the scheduling doesnt bother me all that much. i love this manga and i don't care how long i have to wait between chapters as long as i still get em.  that being said, i hope it doesn't turn into berserk"
OnePunchMan,253l2i,OS1K,2,Fri May 9 15:45:44 2014 UTC,"Oh no, I'm not particularly bothered by it at all. I was just curious. Especially when some chapters are fairly long.   With that said how is berserk? I've seen it mentioned around quite a bit but never given it much thought."
OnePunchMan,253l2i,OS1K,1 point,Fri May 9 17:48:33 2014 UTC,"Its dark as shit, and takes a while to get going but the protaganist is interesting as fuck and the story as a whole is pretty depraved. im only 160 chapters in but so far i love it"
OnePunchMan,253l2i,GreatKingVortex,1 point,Fri May 9 20:16:57 2014 UTC,The thing about berserk is that its been running for about 2 decades. At this point you gave to wait upwards of 4 months for a chapter.
OnePunchMan,253l2i,Th3Outsid3r,2,Tue May 27 05:40:55 2014 UTC,"Everytime when I think:""maybe there's a new onepunchman released"" I see this."

OnePunchMan,24zx97,mrtangelo,3,Wed May 7 23:56:18 2014 UTC,"It seems that currently it is only available in a digital format which is a shame, but who knows it may eventually be published in a physical copy."
OnePunchMan,24zx97,CapedBaldy,1 point,Thu May 8 01:40:03 2014 UTC,"While I love the series, I feel like it is less popular in America. They make much larger profits on digital I would guess. If they can't sell enough digital to meet they're self made ""quota,"" it isn't that likely they will print physical. I mean, they haven't once been sold out of the digital copies yet"
OnePunchMan,24zx97,RoronoaJump,0,Thu May 8 21:11:41 2014 UTC,You do you sell out of digital copies?

OnePunchMan,24up7r,jax_the_champ,3,Wed May 7 00:20:26 2014 UTC,I really enjoyed that. It's pretty neat that the one-punch concepts allows  murata to encapsulate an idea in a small story like this.
OnePunchMan,24up7r,opallix,2,Wed May 7 21:10:05 2014 UTC,What happened to the aliens?
OnePunchMan,24up7r,LucciDVergo,3,Wed May 7 10:58:34 2014 UTC,this was a mini story

The series quickly went viral and has since surpassed 10 million hits, with an average of 20,000 hits a day.  The name is an obvious play on the long-running children's character Anpanman, as punch (パンチ, panchi) is not usually shortened to pan.  A stylized digital manga remake of One-Punch Man illustrated by Yūsuke Murata began publication on Shueisha's Young Jump Web Comics website on June 14, 2012. The idea for the remake began when Murata approached ONE on Twitter to discuss a possible collaboration.  Viz Media has licensed the remake for English serialization in its Weekly Shonen Jump digital magazine.

OnePunchMan,1p8ilc,Khrysalis,-2,Sat Oct 26 02:48:45 2013 UTC,This is way a hate the french. Why can't the speak english like us normal people.
OnePunchMan,1nmqi1,TheMagicStik,3,Thu Oct 3 03:23:40 2013 UTC,I really like the design of the other S-heroes. King looks awesome as always.
OnePunchMan,1nmqi1,MadeWithAlchemy,3,Thu Oct 3 14:10:34 2013 UTC,I like that tornado is drawn gag-like when far.
OnePunchMan,1nmqi1,glenfuerte,2,Thu Oct 3 14:52:24 2013 UTC,"God I can't wait for Saitama and King to be friends, that relationship is so fucking funny to me."
OnePunchMan,1nmqi1,IamRem,2,Thu Oct 3 14:30:20 2013 UTC,King in the background down to the left.
OnePunchMan,1nmqi1,jeffpaulgault,6,Sun Oct 13 21:13:28 2013 UTC,"No, blast was mentioned in the One.  He's always been number 1"
OnePunchMan,1nmqi1,jeffpaulgault,1 point,Thu Oct 3 04:48:39 2013 UTC,I had to pause on page ten to come make a comment about how excited I am to see the new versions of who's on the other side of that door.  Been waiting for this for a while.
OnePunchMan,1nlnb1,jeffpaulgault,1 point,Wed Oct 2 18:59:35 2013 UTC,It's out
OnePunchMan,1nlnb1,My_name_is_Xavier,1 point,Wed Oct 2 20:38:09 2013 UTC,What are you talking about?

OnePunchMan,1mrhzl,jailwall,2,Fri Sep 20 06:28:41 2013 UTC,"Yes, ONE is the author of Onepunch Man (that webcomic) and Yusuke Murata is doing the artwork for this version (based off ONE's original)"
OnePunchMan,1mrhzl,jax_the_champ,1 point,Fri Sep 20 08:18:01 2013 UTC,Cool! I love this manga haha
OnePunchMan,1mrhzl,YouOnlyLiveFOREVER,1 point,Fri Sep 20 11:48:33 2013 UTC,is ONE completed? or did he get an offer to become an author and Yusuke the artist so he stopped making them.
OnePunchMan,1mrhzl,jeffpaulgault,2,Sat Sep 21 04:37:44 2013 UTC,"I think he still makes them, he just does it on his own schedule."
OnePunchMan,1mrhzl,Intergalactic_Camel,1 point,Sun Sep 22 15:56:22 2013 UTC,God I hope so.  But a new one hasn't come out in a minute.  I fully support him focusing on the redone version though.
OnePunchMan,1mp8yh,chimerauprising,7,Thu Sep 19 09:27:15 2013 UTC,The story seems to be distancing itself from the original now.
OnePunchMan,1mp8yh,Raidend,7,Thu Sep 19 10:17:30 2013 UTC,"Yeah, but I really liked this chapter anyway; after all the action is nice to have a breather. Besides we get to see Licenseless Rider without the mask. At least someone is also seeing that Saitama is the real deal besides Geno."
OnePunchMan,1mp8yh,My_name_is_Xavier,7,Thu Sep 19 14:30:19 2013 UTC,I don't think so because I believe he's adding detail to the storyline.
OnePunchMan,1mp8yh,RougeCrown,3,Thu Sep 19 16:38:58 2013 UTC,"Yeah I agree. One's version has Saitama in B class, and even if his promotion could've been done in a page, I enjoyed this a lot. Gotta love Licenseless Rider.."
OnePunchMan,1mp8yh,pundooo,5,Thu Sep 19 23:37:25 2013 UTC,"Saitama is the coolest hero amongst them all.   sorry, Bleach and Naruto."
OnePunchMan,1mp8yh,pundooo,1 point,Thu Sep 19 15:38:36 2013 UTC,Agreed  Also zetman is awesome
OnePunchMan,1mp8yh,TheMagicStik,1 point,Mon Sep 23 08:32:38 2013 UTC,Totally agree zetman is awesome  Speech time:  One punch is one of those manga I was looking for It has that one awesome weird hero who is super hilarious To me a hero is someone who is self sacrificing  This guys shows up like he doesn't care. Super care free. And in that new chapter where he takes the blame to make the other heroes look better than him I wonder what will come of him this feels more like a sitcom than an actual story  But it does give hints by leaving his mysterious powers unchecked and that robot guy's past I wrote a lot in hope of getting this manga to be more popular
OnePunchMan,1mp8yh,TheMagicStik,5,Tue Oct 1 06:46:49 2013 UTC,"Damn, I just really want to see what King looks like."
OnePunchMan,1mc1gx,jeffpaulgault,2,Fri Sep 13 19:43:01 2013 UTC,"Great read, 5 days well spent."
OnePunchMan,1mc1gx,IcecreamDave,2,Thu Sep 19 12:15:24 2013 UTC,Glad you enjoyed it as much as I did.  I reread it every once and a while.
OnePunchMan,1mc1gx,pundooo,2,Fri Sep 20 13:03:39 2013 UTC,Thx for the great suggestion  I'm at CH 60  Very funny manga The first few were like too funny
OnePunchMan,1lcmq5,Raidend,5,Thu Aug 29 19:28:55 2013 UTC,"I really liked the redraw of the shock-wave, its the little details that make it awesome like the almost invisible wave breaking some windows in the edges of the page."
OnePunchMan,1lcmq5,MadeWithAlchemy,4,Thu Aug 29 19:31:51 2013 UTC,"Yeah, once again the drawings are absolutely topnotch. I really can't wait for the next chapters knowing what's to come."
OnePunchMan,1lcmq5,TheMagicStik,6,Thu Aug 29 20:50:45 2013 UTC,"Hmm, I thought since he was taking so long we would get a lot more :("
OnePunchMan,1kyjay,jeffpaulgault,7,Fri Aug 23 18:57:31 2013 UTC,"An amusing idea. But, I think they're going to stick with the stated explanation."
OnePunchMan,1kyjay,Pirsqed,3,Fri Aug 23 20:50:01 2013 UTC,"Effort. The sheer force of will brought him to where he was today. No one on the planet could come close, save for Garou, who managed to harness all that power simply from his desire to be a monster.  Unfortunately, Garou's outlook was impure, compared to Saitama's want to be a hero: The fucker didn't want to work a desk job."
OnePunchMan,1kyjay,TheBigBruce,1 point,Sat Aug 24 07:12:34 2013 UTC,that would go with the notion that onepunchman is a parody on shounen.
OnePunchMan,1kyjay,Nitrosium,1 point,Sat Aug 24 21:17:57 2013 UTC,"Saitama is a monster. You become a monster through stupid effort, more effort, bigger monster. Saitama changed similarly to the man that punched the light switch rope. He did change in appearance, but not by much. He is the ""god level monster""!"
OnePunchMan,1kyjay,IcecreamDave,1 point,Sun Aug 25 06:14:55 2013 UTC,Saitama is the Buddha Incarnate. Sheer effort to attain ultimate strength.
OnePunchMan,1kyjay,glenfuerte,1 point,Sun Sep 1 17:50:25 2013 UTC,"100 push ups, 100 sit ups, and run 10 km per day for three years..."
OnePunchMan,1jlbbm,MadeWithAlchemy,6,Fri Aug 2 21:55:16 2013 UTC,That smirk on on Genos' face. Awesome.
OnePunchMan,1jlbbm,Raidend,5,Fri Aug 2 21:57:49 2013 UTC,It is just me or each time the trow a punch it seems more powerful than the last time?
OnePunchMan,1jlbbm,TheMagicStik,7,Fri Aug 2 22:21:54 2013 UTC,"I'm not sure about the timeline of the series but in the 3rd chapter where he fights a guy who is the size of an entire fucking city, that was probably his strongest punch so far, I mean the guy must have weighed like 300,000 tons + and he killed the dude with one fucking punch."
OnePunchMan,1jlbbm,chimerauprising,1 point,Sat Aug 3 02:14:25 2013 UTC,"If you read the original translations, he punches seriously sometimes starting with the next arc. He still finds the fights boring though and honestly it feels the same as before."
OnePunchMan,1jlbbm,wooryu,2,Sat Aug 3 14:17:49 2013 UTC,He no longer beats people in one punch later
OnePunchMan,1jlbbm,Rankine,1 point,Tue Aug 6 20:01:24 2013 UTC,Some people can take normal punches but not from his serious series!
OnePunchMan,1jlbbm,wooryu,1 point,Wed Aug 21 00:46:29 2013 UTC,Garou survived a serious punch
OnePunchMan,1jlbbm,chimerauprising,0,Wed Aug 21 02:06:24 2013 UTC,Where I am he hasn't been fighting at all. I'm assuming you mean a fight with Garou
OnePunchMan,1jlbbm,wooryu,2,Tue Aug 6 20:09:23 2013 UTC,Yea Garou in the latest japanese chapters gets hit multiple times before he died
OnePunchMan,1jlbbm,GearBrain,1 point,Tue Aug 6 20:35:35 2013 UTC,Maybe but I don't think there's anything to it.
OnePunchMan,1jlbbm,RougeCrown,5,Sat Aug 3 06:07:45 2013 UTC,"Well, that was to the point."
OnePunchMan,1jlbbm,1nate146,1 point,Sat Aug 3 00:21:47 2013 UTC,God. I love this Manga so much. Best shounen Manga so far. Bleach/naruto be damned
OnePunchMan,1invz3,Symmanchus,8,Fri Jul 19 22:59:09 2013 UTC,"Oh wow, that last panel was just...awesome."
OnePunchMan,1invz3,Rankine,3,Fri Jul 19 22:59:48 2013 UTC,I was so upset when i realized that was the last page. I couldn't wait for the caped baldy to send him flying.
OnePunchMan,1invz3,glenfuerte,2,Sat Jul 20 01:34:17 2013 UTC,Epic build up!
OnePunchMan,1invz3,TheMagicStik,2,Sat Jul 20 02:24:24 2013 UTC,"Man, even though this is a parody, shit just gets me so hyped.  It's like listening to some rock song parody and being like ""Damn this is actually really good!"""
OnePunchMan,1hmhn0,Symmanchus,2,Thu Jul 4 08:48:34 2013 UTC,"A bit later than expected, but here it is!"
OnePunchMan,1hmhn0,I_Got_2_Pickles,2,Thu Jul 4 08:48:47 2013 UTC,Batoto version for a less cluttered experience. This chapter went by fast which is no surprise with shonen and OPM.  Genos was holding his own there til that bastard decided to use his acid.* Seems like he has a long way to go to reach Saitama's level. Kind of funny how he hasn't found them yet what with him being able to jump so high. Always have to fashionably late I guess.  (Assumption*)
OnePunchMan,1hmhn0,ContentiousRage,3,Fri Jul 5 08:17:55 2013 UTC,"Thinking that it might just be spit, how funny would that be, going out of his way and risking his life to get hit by a giant wad of spit."
OnePunchMan,1hmhn0,I_Got_2_Pickles,2,Sun Jul 7 16:39:39 2013 UTC,That would be hilarious and knowing the writer it probably is.

OnePunchMan,1gxieh,wooryu,1 point,Tue Aug 6 20:02:21 2013 UTC,Superman is super powerful but one punch is waaaay eh Jk He's a better character  Cuz he's funny and strong
OnePunchMan,1feetz,Symmanchus,3,Fri May 31 12:29:07 2013 UTC,2 more weeks till the next chapter!
OnePunchMan,1feetz,theturban,3,Fri May 31 12:44:31 2013 UTC,This manga is amazing
OnePunchMan,1ev3k4,thats_ruff,1 point,Wed May 22 22:09:10 2013 UTC,WHAT?!
OnePunchMan,1eiqpe,Symmanchus,3,Fri May 17 14:58:18 2013 UTC,Awesome Chapter! Though not really 100 pages. I kept expecting Saitama to burst in.
OnePunchMan,1eiqpe,Xenowar,3,Fri May 17 14:59:13 2013 UTC,Elbow Joint Panic!
OnePunchMan,1eiqpe,Jam-Master-Jay,3,Fri May 17 20:55:44 2013 UTC,"This actually has to rank as one of my favourite current manga series. Nothing can beat JoJo's Bizarre Adventure for me, but this has brilliant humour and the art is impeccable."
OnePunchMan,1dmarp,Symmanchus,2,Fri May 3 14:07:02 2013 UTC,"Only 8 pages this time, lets hope he means it with the 100 pages for the next one."
OnePunchMan,1bsp9w,Symmanchus,2,Sat Apr 6 14:37:20 2013 UTC,FYI Batoto always has the best quality scans. Sometimes there will be errors and Batoto is the only one to periodically update scans.
OnePunchMan,1bsp9w,chimerauprising,2,Sat Apr 6 17:57:36 2013 UTC,Batoto is god's gift to man
OnePunchMan,1azinu,chimerauprising,5,Mon Mar 25 18:07:36 2013 UTC,Anime when?
OnePunchMan,1azinu,deathlordoo,5,Mon Mar 25 18:25:34 2013 UTC,I'd rather wait until the manga is finished so we have minimal filler.
OnePunchMan,1azinu,deathlordoo,4,Mon Mar 25 18:30:58 2013 UTC,"Me too, but It's hard to think of how long that might be."
OnePunchMan,1azinu,Xenowar,4,Mon Mar 25 18:39:13 2013 UTC,I think this would be an anime where I wouldn't mind the filler that much.
OnePunchMan,1azinu,Urek-Mazino,1 point,Sun Apr 14 02:27:28 2013 UTC,Thank you
