lookatmydog,3d8gt2,Mr_Ballyhoo,2,Tue Jul 14 18:55:18 2015 UTC,"They don't have nearly as many health issues. Their snout is slightly elongated, which assists in breathing easier, and since they're being bred to not get so compact a c-section isn't necessary for reproduction, as it is with English Bulldogs.  They also have less folds on their face, and a visible neck. All pros."

lookatmydog,3corjw,eiryn_ravenclaw,11,Thu Jul 9 15:46:18 2015 UTC,"The face and shape of the ears really look like Labrador Retriever.  But the coloration and fur seem more like German Shepherd or Doberman...so, my guess would be a Lab mixed with at least one of those two."
lookatmydog,3corjw,flignir,4,Thu Jul 9 16:14:10 2015 UTC,"Seconded for some kind of Dobie Shepherd mix. Eyebrows are a dead Dobie giveaway. I could maybe see Lab in there, especially w/ the floppy ears and such.   Also, ur pretty op.  EDIT: Now that I'm looking at it again, yellow lab or golden retriever does make more sense than GSD. I think the yellow patches would be darker and you wouldn't get that marbling if it were a GSD. Just my two cents. I base my opinion on absolutely nothing except my ownership of a goofy shepherd."

lookatmydog,3cmhk1,Unoitsso,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:04:55 2015 UTC,I havent had any tests done but I do know his mom was a rat terrier about 12 lbs.  Moose is 47 pounds.  I think his dad was a pit mix and/or a swiss mountain dog.  It seems like a very weird mix but most vets think he is a mini-mountain dog and with a 12 pound mom mathematically it seems to make some sense.  All I can say absolutely is that hes a rescue mutt!

lookatmydog,3cfok0,myaN7,15,Tue Jul 7 15:45:29 2015 UTC,We found her abandoned. She was so sick! She was emaciated and her poor ears had been cut off. But now she is happy and healthy and wonderful!
lookatmydog,3cfok0,moxiecontin714,10,Tue Jul 7 16:03:43 2015 UTC,"The fucked up part is that her ears being cut off is common practice and many people don't view it as inhumane. I used to work in a veterinary hospital and someone called and asked if we ""crop ears, like on a Doberman"" and I curtly responded that we do not abuse animals and hung up on her."
lookatmydog,3cfok0,lilypots,9,Tue Jul 7 19:56:02 2015 UTC,I can't imagine. And it infuriates me when people assume I did it since I have her now. She gets bad ear infections now because they are way too short.
lookatmydog,3cfok0,moxiecontin714,5,Tue Jul 7 20:37:42 2015 UTC,"While I agree with your stance on cropping ears being rude to someone doesn't help your cause. Maybe they don't know the issue and you could have taken the time to explain the issue and why it isn't part of your practice. This way, hopefully, you sway her to your side of the issue instead of driving her to some hack who's just going to do it anyway. Unless of course there's more to your story?"
lookatmydog,3cfok0,lilypots,6,Tue Jul 7 21:58:58 2015 UTC,Nope just told her we don't abuse animals. The only reason to do that is aesthetics and I'm honestly not prepared to have that conversation with someone who is already intent on doing it.

lookatmydog,3bra44,Shboopmommy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:31:45 2015 UTC,"My english is not so good, for now. But i will try.  First of all - we didnt encounter any real aggresion from him. At any circumstances. If he scared, or just suspisios - he is roaring and barking threateningly, its enough to anyone around not to make anything stupid in face of a dog. He is not rushing to bite and dont pull you like, i dont know, any ""fighting"" dog, hanging on a leash.  So is very comfortable to walk with him, with leash or without. He will never rush to other dog or person, before you will come to them together. And even after you met someone and talking, he will not let other person to pet him, before you will intoduce him. :) I dont know how to explain it more understandable.  Second - he is a shepherd. He knows who his family is and always whatch them carefuly, so they wont be left behind or lost. Its very good from one side - he will never just run away for any dog or bird. But from other side - its very hard to see how he is strugling when we are leaving him home alone. (now he is more calm about this, he know sometimes we cant take him, he is sad, but ok :).  He is very playful and have dence amount of energy to be spent per day, but he never spoiled things or furniture in the house. If he didnt spent enough of time on the street he will just play with his toys for a while and then calm down. There no such a horrible, devastating playing hurricane like husky or malamute witch can easily destroy half of your furniture just because you walked today 3 instead of 4 hours.  Third - he is very calm and curious with any children. Even if little one runs to him across the street scream ""YAY WHAT A DOG!!!! LET ME PET IT"", he just sits down and waits while kid will stop touching him ;) The worst thing he ever did is huge lick in the face. :D Im pretty sure he understand that this little humans are puppys, and he need to be careful with them, coz they are stupid.  4 walks per day for 40 minutes was enough to keep him calm at home as a puppy.  Now he is happy with 3 walks per day. 20-30 minutes at the morning. 1 hour midday, 1-2 hour at the evening.  Uf, i have no time now to continue, but i can answer any question from home.  TL; DR: Best dog for family, if you have time and place to walk with."

lookatmydog,3bowjj,panch13,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:19:46 2015 UTC,This is Orlo.  He's an Anatolian Shepherd that was a stray that I got a couple years ago.  He's about 3 now and was around 1 when I got him.
lookatmydog,3bowjj,warm_n_toasty,2,Tue Jun 30 23:39:54 2015 UTC,ooo neat. Ive heard anatolians are pretty intense to own. yay or nay?
lookatmydog,3bowjj,wannabgourmande,2,Wed Jul 1 04:18:08 2015 UTC,"When we got him he didn't listen to anything that we said.  You know how most dogs really want to be around you and please you?  He was nothing like that.  He was super friendly and cuddly but he always had his ""job"" to do which is watch for predators and track them down.  We had to take him to training classes and a special recall class just because he would not come to you when you called him.  With lots of training and steak that we would buy and cook and make treats with.  He is now a really good dog who comes when called.  It helped that we ended up getting a second dog that is some sort of german shepherd mix.  Rubus, the new dog listens really, really well.  We've also trained him to go get Orlo when he's not listening.  He'll run over to him and start pulling on his neck to get his attention and get him to follow back to us.    I will say that you have to be really patient with them.  Really in the last 1/2 a year is when I have really started to feel comfortable that he will always come back to me.  I wouldn't recommend them for somebody as a first time pet owner unless you are really good at training dogs.    Also they are extremely athletic and agile.  He can easily clear a 6' fence no problem.  If he can't jump it he can dig under it in seconds.  His nickname is shovel paw.  I've seen him squeeze through a hole that smaller dogs won't even attempt.    He is fun too watch though.  He'll find a high spot and then just sit there and smell the air and watch for predators.  He is also becoming a bit protective of our property and he's enormous."

The plan is to hire a trainer and see if I can get him able to actually go outside for a walk (he's scared of heights and I'm in a top floor apartment :/), and maybe he'll be a little less restless once I can successfully get him trained and able to work with a dog walker."

lookatmydog,3bbpda,Unoitsso,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:17:32 2015 UTC,He really is a great dog. Very sweet and well mannered. Gets a lot of compliments at the park! I always get asked what kind of dog he is. I always just shrug haha
lookatmydog,3bbpda,charliewr,9,Sat Jun 27 21:40:03 2015 UTC,looks like a beagle/lab mix to me. But I agree with /u/Unoitsso (edit: spelling)
lookatmydog,3bbpda,Silasco,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:55:34 2015 UTC,I definitely see lab. Couldn't figure out the other but beagle looks about right. Great looking dog though

Call me a dork, but I like to identify them for fun! There is definitely beagle in your dog. I wouldn't quite put doberman in that category because the facial structure doesn't match. How tall if your dog and about how much is the weight?"

lookatmydog,3b0i36,Lundix,2,Thu Jun 25 12:09:54 2015 UTC,Usually some kind of terrier - judging by the coat I'd say that's the case here. Unless it's a deerhound rather than a greyhound cross.
lookatmydog,3b0i36,rebecca0nline,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:04:05 2015 UTC,"I'm tempted to say longdog, with the shape of that thing. Or maybe a second- or third generation lurcher with more sighthound than other."
lookatmydog,3b0i36,PeanutNore,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:49:33 2015 UTC,I believe its a pure bred Lurcher. Its a rarer breed.

lookatmydog,3b0i36,the_doughboy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:03:11 2015 UTC,"Lurcher:       The lurcher is a type of dog originating in England and Ireland. Brian Plummer identifies the Norfolk lurcher as the predecessor of the modern lurcher.  While not a pure breed, it is generally a cross between a sighthound and any other non-sighthound breed,  usually a pastoral dog or terrier, dependent on the attributes desired by the breeder, originally stealth and cunning. Collie crosses are popular, given the working instinct of a sheepdog when mated with a sighthound gives a dog of great intelligence plus speed—prerequisites for the hunter/poacher. In the USA midwest, crosses with large scent hounds are fairly common.

lookatmydog,3a3x44,pickle2tickle,2,Wed Jun 17 01:04:51 2015 UTC,Kelpie x Blue Heeler?
lookatmydog,3a3x44,Kida95,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:09:31 2015 UTC,Aww I wish he was part heeler - they are so smart. I'm not quite sure what a kelpie is though? I know for sure that he is part black lab.
lookatmydog,3a3x44,Kida95,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:18:56 2015 UTC,A kelpie is a farm dog. He looks quite similar to my girl which is Kelpie x Border Collie x Blue Heeler. Hence why I suggested a mix of those breeds.
lookatmydog,3a3x44,Kida95,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:45:16 2015 UTC,He does look part Kelpie to me though.. So maybe Lab x Kelpie?

lookatmydog,39i50n,indecorously,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:02:51 2015 UTC,YES. Everytime we go to the dog park she sits under a tree and just stares at the tree. Like she's just looking at the bark. She makes no sense.  Does yours play super rough?
lookatmydog,39i50n,AMcNair,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:08:35 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say she's super rough, but I often describe her as ""aggressively affectionate."" She's a very sweet and loving dog, but when she wants to play, she is very insistent. She'll pull your hand towards her with her paw, take a phone out of your hand, try to climb into your lap and press herself against you.    We've only had her about six months (She was a shelter dog.) and she has improved with training and socialization. She doesn't jump on people anymore, but she remains very insistent when she wants human attention.    She plays fine with our older Lab, but she's a little pushy with her, too.    She is wicked smart and amazingly athletic. Couldn't be happier with her."

lookatmydog,392qxs,MintyCrayon,2,Mon Jun 8 20:52:52 2015 UTC,"To elaborate for those who aren't privy to the story: our sweet mini dachshund Kitty was diagnosed with Stage 2 Malignant Melanoma after examination of a nasty oral tumor. We drained our savings accounts for countless vet visits & trying to get a diagnosis for her, and now we can't afford the surgery (segmental mandibulectomy) that would save her life and give her a longer time on this earth with us.  Kitty is a happy, healthy girl with an adventurous spirit, strong empathy for others, and a silly sense of humor. We don't want to be forced to make an awful decision just because we can't afford treatment. We are so grateful for the outpouring of support from the reddit community; you've given our family hope, and that's just priceless to us. I'm in complete awe of all this compassion.  I'm not sure if Reddit censors but here's some info for those interested.  GOFUNDME LINK: it's the regular GoFundMe com website and you just add our custom URL at the end which is /save_kitty  Your support and positive thoughts mean the world to us. We're fighting right along with her! We cannot thank you enough and can't wait to pay it forward."

lookatmydog,38z9ky,branash13,12,Mon Jun 8 04:51:32 2015 UTC,Have you considered a gofundme? Or similar site? I would donate 20 to that cause and I know dozens of people that would do the same. I can help you spread the word on social media.

lookatmydog,38z9ky,Neksyus,5,Mon Jun 8 11:27:09 2015 UTC,"If this was 100% undeniably full-proof an attempt to pay your dying dogs bills, I'd throw $20 in as well.   But I've seen so many bullshit things I can't trust anyone like this on a gofundme page.   I mean, $10,000 is well worth spending an hour drafting a legitimate story."
lookatmydog,38z9ky,branash13,12,Mon Jun 8 05:20:11 2015 UTC,I understand your skepticism. There are a lot of fraudulent accounts out there that ruin it for the rest of us but I do respect your opinion. We're just seeking help to afford a procedure that will save and prolong our furbaby's life.
lookatmydog,38z9ky,evaluatrix,6,Mon Jun 8 05:25:59 2015 UTC,You could offer up the name and contact info for the Vets office that is going to treat her for anyone who is skeptical. Just a thought!
lookatmydog,38z9ky,branash13,4,Mon Jun 8 15:04:44 2015 UTC,"Well it's not 100%, but reverse search that picture on Google and nothing comes up."
lookatmydog,38z9ky,evaluatrix,2,Mon Jun 8 08:12:52 2015 UTC,Is that good or bad in your opinion. I am not trying to be a douche... I am genuinely asking. :)
lookatmydog,38z9ky,branash13,4,Mon Jun 8 15:05:25 2015 UTC,The implication is the OP did not use a picture that s/he found online and thus is more likely to have genuinely taken the photo. Not finding the photo on Google adds credibility.
lookatmydog,38z9ky,GhostNightgown,3,Mon Jun 8 17:34:55 2015 UTC,"That is kinda what I thought you were inferring, but I was not sure if you were being sarcastic or not."

If it helps, I'm actually going to update our GoFundMe with a photo of Kitty's oral tumor that the vet have us. I don't know if that helps. But, yeah, she's our little family member and we feel she deserves a fighting chance. We still have hope."

lookatmydog,38z9ky,GhostNightgown,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:27:58 2015 UTC,"Stage 2 Malignant Melanoma. It hasn't spread yet and she's otherwise in great health, which is why she's a prime candidate for the segmental mandibulectomy (removing the lower right side of her jaw). The surgery apparently sounds more invasive than it actually is, and it's almost always a life-saving surgery for animals with these nasty oral tumors. It's just very expensive. The animals recover very quickly (14-72 hours typically) and the missing part of their jaw has no negative impact on their quality of life. Just a cosmetic thing. Her tongue might hang out and look silly, but she's the cutest thing in the world to us, so that's not an issue for us."

He is missing a ton of teeth so his tongue always hangs out but I don't know if the vet was the one who removed part of his tongue or if something happened prior to being rescued. We warm and soften his food for him and he gets soft dog treats. He does love gnawing on bones with the teeth he has left so he gets those a lot, too."

lookatmydog,37gbnw,Enchanted_Bunny,15,Wed May 27 12:37:01 2015 UTC,I hate people who feel the need to randomly fire off illegal fireworks.  I lost a beautiful snowshoe cat that way.
lookatmydog,37gbnw,PushcartPops,5,Wed May 27 14:07:17 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I live in Michigan where airborne fireworks are no longer illegal. Individual cities tried to ban them but another state law passed that actually made it illegal for cities ban fireworks the day before, day of, and day after a national holiday. The first year it went into effect was 2012, the year of a massive drought. Well of course idiots were lighting off so many fireworks that some streets in my city were enveloped in a literal FOG of smoke. All that dry grass and flying fireworks burned down a church and several homes that fourth of july.  Freya (my dog) goes insane and I'm constantly afraid she'll hurt herself trying to escape from the noises. She has in the past destroyed her crate (escaped it even though it was latched closed) and even climbed behind my TV and unplugged literally everything (I was SO happy she didn't get electrocuted). I recently moved and thankfully it's better. Where I used to live, people were setting off massive fireworks shows at 2-3 o'clock in the morning three days AFTER the damn holiday. You'd call the police but illegal fireworks were pretty damn low on their priority list.   It's kind of funny because I have neighbors who think the fact that our neighborhood is chiefly Hispanic means we get a lot of fireworks. Then I told them about how insane my white neighborhood was and how it made our neighborhood's fireworks sound like a bunch of kids playing with cap guns by comparison. The only difference is, you'll hear an odd firework here and there all year round, but the holidays aren't nearly as bad."

lookatmydog,37b8qk,404-04,1 point,Fri May 29 07:21:19 2015 UTC,"I have a dog that looked like that quite a bit when he was still a pup. Grew somewhat darker as he became an adult. Mine was is a ""farm dog"" from China. Not a purebred dog in his linage as far as as know for tens of generation, if ever. Good dog too, he's 17 years old now so he sleep 10 hours, eat, walk and repeat."
lookatmydog,37a7ph,ShaylaDoesIt,5,Tue May 26 03:08:40 2015 UTC,"Yes. Yes, I do."
lookatmydog,37a7ph,CS01,2,Tue May 26 10:24:32 2015 UTC,And my answer would be yes.
lookatmydog,378zvs,jfk_47,3,Mon May 25 21:18:22 2015 UTC,My dog threw up when I took her through one. It was one of those psychedelic ones with flashy lights and colored soaps. I felt bad because I though she'd be amused by it.
lookatmydog,378zvs,enrike9066,3,Tue May 26 05:54:41 2015 UTC,"My dog loves car wash, he gets too excited though."

lookatmydog,374pq7,wolfikins,6,Mon May 25 03:53:27 2015 UTC,Maybe a Lab/Corgi mix?
lookatmydog,374pq7,monkeybugs,2,Sun May 24 22:55:01 2015 UTC,It's a possibility. The face is what's throwing me off. It's almost like Pit/Lab in the head and Corgi body with a Chocolate Lab coloring. My Golden Retriever/Corgi mix approves regardless of the mix.
lookatmydog,374pq7,ControlSix,1 point,Sun May 24 23:05:27 2015 UTC,"I was thinking Bassador!  The legs are too chunky to be Corgi legs, and I've found that basset ankles are more turned out."
lookatmydog,374pq7,OttoKing,6,Mon May 25 04:25:43 2015 UTC,Those ears! It's like he's got a foolishly short body of a dachshund or basset with the stocky build of a block headed lab or pit and those ears are having none of that hound foolishness.
lookatmydog,374pq7,RobotArmMonkeyBrain,3,Sun May 24 23:49:11 2015 UTC,His head was also ridiculously large for his body for awhile but he's kind of grown into it now lol

lookatmydog,374pq7,Jeester,3,Sun May 24 21:27:18 2015 UTC,He looks like a grown man with the body of a child.
lookatmydog,374pq7,Nephdaddy8,2,Mon May 25 05:00:24 2015 UTC,For some reason I expect his head to be on a bigger dog. :/
