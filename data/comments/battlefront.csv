battlefront,3dwc2v,DownFalldotcom,6,Mon Jul 20 02:02:03 2015 UTC,Favorite: Mustafar by a long shot. Force pushing enemies into the fire was super fun! Plus taking advantage of the chokeholds.  Worst: Probably Kashyyyk or Endor. Both are very unbalanced. Good luck winning if you are the empire on Endor and the clones on Kashyyk.
battlefront,3dwc2v,aj_thenoob,2,Mon Jul 20 03:52:05 2015 UTC,I found Dagobah to be the most unbalanced map in BF2.

battlefront,3dr5mq,Will12239,7,Sat Jul 18 21:53:49 2015 UTC,At least it attempted to expand the series rather than cut half the features to make a non-spectacular streamlined fps.
battlefront,3dr5mq,butchthedoggy,2,Sun Jul 19 04:18:57 2015 UTC,The thing is though DICE didn't want to expand the series- this is a reboot
battlefront,3dr5mq,Will12239,0,Sun Jul 19 23:54:33 2015 UTC,Then they should call it something else because there's no command posts. Reboot to DICE meant gut half the features
battlefront,3dr5mq,butchthedoggy,2,Sun Jul 19 23:56:53 2015 UTC,"Just because there are no command posts (in the 2 game modes we've seen) means they can't call it Battlefront?  No, reboot to DICE means approach the game from a completely different direction than has been done previously.  Losing space battles (we can't say we ""lost"" classes- again, this is a reboot.  They intentionally left out classes so that we could have more customization) as well as a good chunk of the old maps and modes is not half the features.  We haven't even seen the other 8 game modes and what they have to offer"
battlefront,3dr5mq,Will12239,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:28:09 2015 UTC,"The only thing kept from the original series is the fact that you can be a soldier/Jedi and pilot vehicles. To call it a reboot is a huge stretch. The game plays completely differently to the point that they purposefully removed command posts (no conquest mode was confirmed) to avoid the game taking away from Battlefield sales.       The Battlefront name should not be in the title because it is a completely different game that shares basicly nothing with the predecessor, and when compared directly actually has a lot less features including no more 64 player online, no more mods (BFII had over 1000 modded maps), no more Clone Wars, no space battles, no space to ground, railed ATAT movement, no hunt, no galactic conquest, no classes, and no offline (repetitive style wave missions don't count)."

All the guns look as if they act the same as well - the rebel assault rifle type gun differed only in looks to the empire's one.

DICE has already confirmed that ROTJ Luke on Hoth is a placeholder.  On-rails AT-AT is necessary for the game mode.  How much fun do you think it would be if someone on your team were to waltz into the AT-AT, stand still and spend the whole battle shooting at Rebels footsoldiers?  Chances are you'd lose.  P2W?

battlefront,3cznrr,Alteran195,3,Wed Jul 22 10:50:11 2015 UTC,"Powerups - I only see this being bad for vehicles, but if it turns out to only be in Walker Assault, then it isn't a big deal  Price Tag - What? Its a AAA game, why would it be cheaper then any other AAA game.   HP Regen - How is this a bad thing? Its a better system then the old battlefronts where you had to stand by a droid to heal. It also helps you not die every 2 seconds like other modern FPS games.  Small maps - you must be watching different gameplay then I have, none of the maps seem small.   ROTJ Luke on Hoth - Why does it matter? Seriously, these battles aren't following the movies so who cares. Odds are he's a placeholder.  No classes - Aren't you able to customize your loadout? Why do you need different classes when you can choose your weapons.  No single-player campaign - Battlefront 1 and 2s ""campaigns"" were nothing more then instant action battles with some scripted elements. We know very little about how the single player ""missions"" work, for all we know there will be more single player content in this game, then the old ones.   No clone-wars - I've said it before, I'd much rather have them focus on one era, and make it amazing, then do both and have them be less. Odds are they will release an expansion down the line that includes the clone wars, or they'll be in the sequel. I'm sure you'll say something like DLC is bad! But if it's done right, and adds a good amount of content, then it isn't. Unless of course you hated expansion packs of old too.   P2W bs - What are you talking about? No where has it been said there would be any kind of P2W in this game.   No space-battles - Battlefront 1 didn't have space battles, did you not like it either? The space battles in BF2 were also boring as hell, and that's an opinion I've seen a lot of other people say as well. So far what we've seen of the aerial combat in the new Battlefront, it looks a lot more fun then the space battles in BF2.  Few planets - Quality ≠ Quantity. The maps we've seen so far are a hell of a lot more detailed then anything that was in BF 1 and 2.   Few maps - See above.  EA - Bias, the EA games I've played, I've enjoyed. I'm not saying EA is by any means perfect, they have done sketchy things in the past, but hating on a game just because its from EA is ridiculous.  Dice - See above  Titanfall V2 - Titanfall is a very fun game, I see no issues with this."

battlefront,3c0rro,0510521,3,Fri Jul 3 18:43:04 2015 UTC,Do you think the game is steered towards new players or the old ones?
battlefront,3c0rro,DownFalldotcom,5,Sat Jul 4 03:38:34 2015 UTC,Hard to say honestly. I feel like they did a pretty good job capturing the essence of the originals while incorporating new systems.
battlefront,3c0rro,CasualToast,3,Sat Jul 4 03:49:31 2015 UTC,"Is there anything in the Alpha suggesting that there will be a leveling system or something that you are trying to achieve overall through playing the game? Do you gain experience to unlock weapons or anything along those lines? I worry that this one will grow stale for me if there's not something bigger picture than each game session. Do you feel like you're actually working together to achieve a goal? The footage I'm seeing looks an awful lot like a bunch of random bopping around and shooting anyone who happens to wander into your line of sight. I haven't seen anything yet that really captures a game where there is lots of strategy, working together to achieve something. It seems more like winning or losing a match is just kind of a byproduct of randomly shooting the guys you see? Do the different weapons have different feels? Does changing your loadout have any type of drastic effect on how the game plays? Basically -- is there much variety going on or is it just sort of the same run and gun thing the whole time?"
battlefront,3c0rro,Remant,4,Sat Jul 4 04:58:59 2015 UTC,"There is a leveling system and credits you get each match. The amount of credits you get is derived from your score that round. The only team game mode is basically rush where one team is trying to activate a beacon so that the Y wings can 'emp' the AT-ATs so that they can take damage. When this happens the rebels(defenders) can damage the walkers and try to bring them down. The Clone troopers(attackers) are attempting to disable the beacons so that their walkers can push through to the enemy base and win the round. There are 4(?) sets of beacons.  There are 4 weapons. A pistol, a 'lmg', a assault rifle and a second assault rifle. Each has its strengths and weaknesses and they are pretty well rounded. You also have a kit which is a choice between a jump pack, ion shot, and three shot grenade launcher(OP as fuck btw) or a kit with a mobile bubble forcefield, a grenade, and a lock on rocket launcher. Each has distinct strengths and weaknesses but in open combat the jump pack adds so much mobility and advantages when fleeing or dodging that you kind of need to take that one to engage in a push on the objectives.    I'd be happy to elaborate on anything I didn't cover well enough and I appreciate a question like this; these were the questions I wanted to answer.     Sorry for any formatting, grammar, or spelling issues, I am on mobile."

I'm confused here, you state four weapons. Are each one of those weapons a class? Or do you just have a basic class that you can chose your weapon for? You also go into the talk of a ""kit"" which I'm thinking is the class. Not trying to be rude, but I'm curious as to which is what."

battlefront,3c0rro,ISayHorseShit,2,Sat Jul 4 18:20:37 2015 UTC,"No class, weapons as in individual weapons choose then you can choose between 2 kits that have different benefits. No real class system that I've seen at least"

battlefront,3c0rro,gunnyguy121,6,Fri Jul 3 18:44:31 2015 UTC,It's the same fall animation every time. Also roping their legs and making them fall is a bitch. Especially if the game is laggy at all.

battlefront,3c0rro,gunnyguy121,3,Fri Jul 3 18:51:46 2015 UTC,No idea. And maybe it's just me but my level and credits seem to get wiped if I quit and play later
battlefront,3c0rro,artycharred,3,Fri Jul 3 19:14:00 2015 UTC,"Fellow Alpha participant here, we can all only assume what they might do, but I have a Halo: Reach sort've idea. Perhaps the credits are simply for upgrading the aesthetic of your character. Maybe you use them to buy something similar to a battlepack like in BF4. As of now they're completely useless."

battlefront,3c0rro,SgtGrumbles89,3,Sat Jul 4 03:10:38 2015 UTC,It's alpha so expect just the core mechanics to be in place anything additional is a bonus atm. From the leaked footage it does look pretty dank doe!
battlefront,3c0rro,Pfheonix,5,Fri Jul 3 19:42:54 2015 UTC,there's still only so much you can add in 4 months.
battlefront,3c0rro,Pfheonix,3,Fri Jul 3 19:43:38 2015 UTC,"This shouldn't be down voted, it is possible what we are playing doesn't have all the animations, but people shouldn't expect a major overhaul in the next 4 months."
battlefront,3c0rro,Pfheonix,3,Fri Jul 3 21:03:01 2015 UTC,"To be fair, BF4 had a decently large overhaul in between its beta and the final release."
battlefront,3c0rro,Pfheonix,2,Mon Jul 6 04:24:49 2015 UTC,"my guess is its all ready to be added in, they just want to add it in line after line and be damn sure it is good to go (at least, I really hope this is their mindset). Slowly and surely. They don't want another BF4 rush release."
battlefront,3c0rro,MagBootFTW,3,Fri Jul 3 20:43:33 2015 UTC,well lets hope so I'm tired of telling everyone what that trust and complacency they are putting in DICE will end up with.

battlefront,3c0rro,Yespleamdr,2,Fri Jul 3 19:33:22 2015 UTC,For being just one map I had an incredible amount of fun. There are so many things you can do in contrast to similar games. I can definitely see the potential.
battlefront,3c0rro,Pfheonix,2,Fri Jul 3 21:26:36 2015 UTC,I have a pretty beefy gaming computer and I get lag spikes in game and in between games my game freezes completely until the next round starts. This happens in multiplayer as well as singleplayer so I know it's not an Internet problem.   The gameplay is pretty fun but overall as it stands now I'd say it's a 7.5. Not worth full price right now but they have time to improve.

battlefront,3byfjh,Dilfbert,0,Fri Jul 3 11:26:00 2015 UTC,I think you are talking about different things. What he means is that there will be much more content. Do you mean you simply don't like the mechanics?

So actual thoughts here:  The gameplay footage they showed at E3 looks like how it is ingame, no doctored footage,   granted more cinematic angles and shots, however the game is beautiful.  Played 5 games, rebels won every one so far. AT-ATs just get destroyed in the last 3rd of   the map.  Sound effects are top, which is important for a Star Wars entry.  Got to rank 6, don't know if a sniper is unlocked later, but seems like it will be very   strong as headshots are easy to get due to large helmets. Not a bad thing in the slightest,   as one death doesn't feel bad in the grand scheme of things.  Single Player wave mode had destructibles, mainly I noticed the tents where blasted apart   and then destroyed completely.  Power ups are a great way to handle the battlefield. No need to camp vehicles as much,   though it is possible and probably will be done. Tokens don't seem to spawn randomly for   vehicle locations at least.  Between this game and how it feels to Battlefront 2. BF2 has a more arcadey feel, but that   might be because it is close to 10 years old now? This game feels like a battlefield,   however that is not a bad thing unless you absolutely hate battlefield.  Any questions, feel free to ask. I enjoyed it a lot so far, and will be playing more.  EDIT: And just to address some other concerns I remember reading in the last month or so:  Jetpacks don't seem annoying or OP. They are helpful, and also not very controllable. You   just burst forward and high up. NPCs in the Wave mode could hover and chill (and are   hilarious when you kill them as they fly around and blow up), so future classes might have a   more advanced version?  20 vs 20 seems fine enough. The only times I was actually struggling to find action was at   the start of the match obviously, and only if I didn't have a partner to spawn on and had to   spawn way back. Generally there is maybe 20sec ish of getting back into position before you   feel involved.  On rails AT-AT seems fine enough. It keeps the battlefield on a sense of progression.   However, the progression feels kind of forced because of it. Don't know if the rebels can   make a brilliant stand up front, or if the battlefield will always get to the third section   ish before the AT-ATs are destroyed no matter how good the rebels defend.  Just a shoutout to trenches. They feel like actual WWI trenches, when you have two sides   poking heads out, taking pot shots, explosions, and the entire middle zone is a death zone.   Feels really fun to jetpack across, or try and take a side route to survive. Really was   immersive crouching with teammates huddling from explosions and stuff.  I was in every vehicle but the ones that can tie the AT-ATs, which I don't recall seeing and   forgot the name of. Starfighter controls are easier than a Battlefield game, but there were   still tons of people (including myself) just crashing into things. More funny than anything,   I had an X-wing fly right into my AT-AT's head once."
battlefront,3bv51x,FlyingAce1015,4,Thu Jul 2 17:09:00 2015 UTC,it seems as if the jetpacks are more akin to bf2s jumppacks

battlefront,3bylq6,FishMcCray,6,Fri Jul 3 13:23:56 2015 UTC,"I agree that the sound design and graphics are great. I think the weapon damage needs a second pass though.

Maybe it's just the ping getting crazy with so many people, but i cant seem to kill anybody. I am having a lot of fun with it though.

battlefront,3bylq6,Tshoe77,4,Fri Jul 3 10:33:53 2015 UTC,"I don't find it to really play anything like battlefield. Especially third person. It seems much faster, and more fluid than any bf game of late so I can't quite understand the point.  The assault map offered is very similar to rush, except you can't stop the enemy team unless you do your part as a defender, where bf games version of rush is more of a sit and do nothing and they may not be able to push.  I do agree that the vehicles don't feel much reward. Flying is odd to get used to, and I haven't gotten the hang of it yet.  And the atst walker just seems like it's made of glass, whenever I see one it walks around unimpeded, yet the moment I get into one I'm focused down instantly.   The heavy blaster can take them down in two bursts if you use the ion card too, but for whatever reason no one ever tries shooting it.  I've enjoyed every minute I've played so far, I'm hoping they open up the alpha a bit over the weekend"

There's NO squads, NO commander, NO squad leaders, NO spotting, NO tanks/jets, NO only 1st person view (has 1st & 3rd), NO 64 player, NO levolution but this is a""re-themed"" Battlefield game?? Do you realize how stupid that sounds?? This is so far from Battlefield isn't not even funny.. The ONLY thing this has in common with Battlefield is the engine and the developer. You kinda let on to your biasedness with that last stupid sentence.. ""With EA reigning over them like the evil empire, it's not very hard to believe""....

battlefront,3bylq6,Jeffgoldbum,5,Sat Jul 4 01:19:31 2015 UTC,Have you played Battlefront 1 or 2? Because they pretty much were like Battlefield too...
battlefront,3bylq6,ForgottenKnightt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:58:26 2015 UTC,"The game mode sure has some similarities with rush but it plays quite different, the objectives may resemble mcoms but they actually play like capture points since they don't get destroyed and can continually change between active/inactive. Also regardless of what attackers do they get to advance to the next stage as long as there's a Walker left so most games last until the last round. And last there are no tickets so killing doesn't have a direct effect."
battlefront,3bylq6,RiverRoll,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:51:11 2015 UTC,"I fail to see how this is a bad thing. Battlefield games at their core are solid shooters.

Having TPP view, having heroes and not having to aim down-sights - these three elements really make the game different from Battlefield. How can you say otherwise?   I'm not saying Battlefront is great. It's just not reskinned Battlefield. Also, judging the game after playing ONE mode is silly."

Spawned among enemies numerous times. It is a simple escort of a linear railed object to the objective or stop it.   There is NOTHING innovative about this game. The game play is far from anything new or even a twist on old game play.  The shooting feels nice, but $70 for a multiplayer only Battlefield with Star Wars skins and a tacked on survival mode, which is also one of the oldest game play styles there are. Nothing special or amazing here at all."

battlefront,3bxm6j,Pfheonix,2,Fri Jul 3 01:20:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah don't take anything you see from alpha footage as gospel.   Pretty much none of those things are true. Close on the spawning, but not how it works at all"
battlefront,3bxm6j,beardedbast3rd,2,Fri Jul 3 18:11:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly, as someone who has put at least 24 solid hours into the alpha I can say op has no clue as to what he's saying. You don't have squad spawn, you get a single partner and that is who you can spawn on. Orbital strikes are pretty fair and balanced imo, they don't spawn too often and you know when they are coming because the first 2 or 3 tracers hit outside the aoe..... But you shouldn't be able to outrun something like that anyway. Also blaster damage is fine, it's a video game you shouldn't die in 1 hit. Everyone would bitch about it, aim for the head it does more. I honestly get a headache from the people who haven't played it trying to review it and judge it."
battlefront,3bxm6j,SgtGrumbles89,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:51:44 2015 UTC,"Not to mention orbital strikes show you on the map exactly where they hit, and how wide the radius is"

battlefront,3bvmdp,Breezeeh,2,Thu Jul 2 14:52:36 2015 UTC,"It's still in Alpha, so maybe the setting's controls have not been set yet. As far as I know, the Alpha is less graphically intense than it will be on retail release."
battlefront,3bvmdp,Spilcam,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:46:06 2015 UTC,Alphas are usually more graphicslly intense because the graphics are unoptimized. You get poorer graphics but still have to work your machine hard for them.

I enjoyed playing on the Imperial side more and that side won 100% of the games I played.  Which is odd because I had someone else say the exact opposite.  They do have Hoth cannons that help to attack the AT-AT's though but you get blown off pretty quick."

But here on leddit, everyone always seems to be overly positive, and the dislike function is always used as a ""disagree"" button rather than censoring spam or things not related to the discussion.   i agree with that though, tbh you can't have an opinion that sways evne a bit from the general majority of people in a sub on here, people just dont seem to get that downvote =/= disagree"

battlefront,3baura,BeBovius,-8,Sat Jun 27 15:33:08 2015 UTC,so they cant tell everyone how bad it is
battlefront,3baura,ChiefReap,7,Sat Jun 27 17:28:55 2015 UTC,"BF3 alpha was NDA'd as well, and now it is the best FPS of seventh generation consoles and easily in the top 10 of all PC FPS, so, idk if thats the reason?"
battlefront,3baura,Hunter1207,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:27:17 2015 UTC,"Not excatly right wording for it. I think - ""so they don't have ability to whine about alpha stage"" is more suitable.   Previous receptions of news about this game proved that players nostalgia and prejudice about EA/DICE prevented them to discuss/criticize the game impartially"
battlefront,3baura,BeBovius,6,Sat Jun 27 17:58:07 2015 UTC,Videos and photos from the alpha could easily be falsely claimed to be footage from the finished product which is bad for EA/DICE. That is one reason I believe a NDA is necessary.

battlefront,3baura,Kryptickzz,3,Thu Jul 2 06:02:46 2015 UTC,Judging a game from early development footage wrong and is what a lot of people do. Another reason to have a NDA

You hate the game, you hate DICE, you hate absolutely everything having to do with the new Star Wars: Battlefront and you think it's going to be a complete and total train wreck.  And it very well might be.   Fine.  I get it.  But there is no need to go about posting again, and again, and again, on multiple threads, and starting new posts, about how bad it is going to be and forcefully shoving your opinion down our throats."

battlefront,3aq8tt,ubertokes,7,Mon Jun 22 19:41:31 2015 UTC,"I am most definitely not supporting you.  I think that you are going to a complete extreme, assuming the absolute worst about absolutely everything.  We are not a bunch of EA/DICE worshipping fanatics, we're simply being optimistic, hoping for the best, preparing for the worst.  We're also not letting a 5-minute game play clip (as well as various reports from 10-minute tests) from one of the 10 game modes on one of the 12 maps from a pre-alpha build of a game that still has 5 months of development left define our expectations of the game."
battlefront,3aq8tt,ImDerrickTheCat,-7,Mon Jun 22 19:50:32 2015 UTC,"Yep, I think it will most likely turn out as the next Titanfall (except its star-wars), downgrading and removal of key-features or general simplifications to boost their launch sales is one of the things I despise the most in the gaming industry, especally when it comes to EA.  But hey, maybe we'll get a campaign in the 4th DLC? and clone wars in the ""sequel"".  If it was just a generic star-wars game with another title I wouldn't care as much, I would laugh at it fail still. But since its a BATTLEFRONT game with a dramatically changed playstyle and a complete downgrade in terms of features (and quality), I will keep my crusade going."
battlefront,3aq8tt,Chitownbrez,4,Mon Jun 22 19:57:56 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to understand or accept that this is a reboot, not a sequel, and literally only sharing the name. It has nothing, except that, in common with the previous games. If it helps you sleep at night just tell yourself it's called Battlefield: Star Wars or whatever the fuck you want it to be.  btw: last time i checked a crusade wasnt a one man effort"
battlefront,3aq8tt,electricalnoise,5,Wed Jun 24 00:46:55 2015 UTC,"No body gives a fuck about your opinion. If you don't like the game and EA/Dice so much, make a Tumblr about it. Then you'll at least be surrounded by like-minded quasi-crusaders who complain about everything like its the worst possible thing to happen since the fucking Holocaust."
battlefront,3aq8tt,electricalnoise,8,Tue Jun 23 02:28:33 2015 UTC,"The thing is, choosing dice over free radical appears to be choosing graphics over gameplay. Unfortunately as neither of them have been released, we really don't know jack shit about how good either one is."

It's this kind of complaint that makes me worried about how DICE is going to react and sprawl to try and please the people complaining, only to in turn ruin the game they had in mind just to appease the complaints.  And besides, DICE made Battlefield 4( and 3) which felt far from floaty compared to Visceral's Hardline, I trust DICE will do what's best."

Folks are looking way too much into this and trying to make it a complicated Star Wars Battlefield..  it does NOT have to be over complicated, it does NOT have to be complex. The first 2 games weren't deep or complex at all, yet folks talk about how fun they were. I understand its cool and hip to hate anything from EA, but keep that hate in perspective. The first 2 games were just as fun and simple.."
battlefront,3an25y,venom06,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:56:26 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately games that are initially fun but lack depth are not what most gamers are looking for anymore.  Most things are fun the very first time you try them, the overarching concern is can the game stand as a shooter beyond that initial ""ohhh it star wars, so pretty"" period. I am not looking for Star Wars: Global Offensive here but no depth means that once I play a couple rounds and get bored of the maps and visuals there is nothing for me to strive for. There is a reason a game like counterstrike which isn't exceptionally pretty or particularly fun on its own is the number one populated FPS every night. I think I speak for a number of people when I say so far this on rails no recoil shallow nonsense brings on a yawn, simplicity may be fun for you (look how many people used to buy COD every year) but we want more from our shooters."
battlefront,3an25y,Diluxx,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:30:28 2015 UTC,"Battlefront has ALWAYS been about casual fun period..  no over-complex, over-complicated crap, not depending on teammates to have fun.. That's just the plain truth.  Folks need to go back and look at the lineage of the franchise and stop LOOKIN for something to potentially complain about. Its always been about casual fun. And MANY sites have already said that they thought the it would be casual fun (just like the first 2 Battlefront games)...  if you want you over-complex, over-complicated fix, please go play Battlefield."

Considering this Can you blame people for being a bit let down? I get that you are ok with a game being simplified but what do you hope to achieve by arguing with those of us who are disappointed by what this iteration of Battlefront is offering. Enjoy the game when it comes out but stop trying to control others opinions of it, you'll live longer."
battlefront,3an25y,Diluxx,0,Thu Jun 25 00:36:46 2015 UTC,"kinda stupid response, but i guess thats the best you can do... point is, the first 2 Battlefront games will VERY casual and fun... nothing complex, nothing complicated...  thats what the next one will be casual and fun... if it was over complicated, it would be Battlefield and stupid ass CoD fanboys and EA haters would bitch to no end.."

battlefront,3an25y,Skatinbrad,-1,Mon Jun 22 01:49:16 2015 UTC,"Battlefront I and II were by no means complicated games, sure there were some mechanics that could be difficult, like bringing down AT-ATs with cabling, or mastering the space-battles.  But the majority of the game was simple, do whatever objective you want, kill troops, take bases, fuck around in you favorite vehicle... do whatever.  This game so far just seems like a rushed BF (or Battlefield re-skin), there is just not enough content to compensate for its simplicity, it lacks a campaign/story, and it seems like Dice have changed the playstyle dramatically into more of an ""arena-shooter"" instead of a more kind of ""open-world"" game.  Basically, what I and lots of other BF players were expecting, was a new BF game. We enjoyed the 2 previous ones, and we allready enjoyed the ""blueprints"" for those games in the way that the games were designed and how the games worked.  I mean, comon. EA's Dice doesn't even have HALF of the maps that BF2 did on release (not even with the ""free-DLC""), and 1/4th of the planets. People have also complained how small the maps were on E3, and how they felt more like a small arena or cluster."
battlefront,3an25y,throwaway123314,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:54:48 2015 UTC,"I would say the lack of campaign is a good thing. Dice can't really do a good singleplayer, atleast they haven't since Bad Company. This gives them more time to spend on the multiplayer which is what most of their fanbase plays."

I've seen a lot of weird things when people justified space battles, but never that.   do whatever objective you want, kill troops, take bases, fuck around in you favorite vehicle... do whatever.   It's a fuckin shooter not a sandbox   This game so far just seems like a rushed BF (or Battlefield re-skin)   lol what, its less like battlefield than battlefront 1 was   it lacks a campaign/story   Missions are more polished than the ""campaign"" in 2   Dice have changed the playstyle dramatically into more of an ""arena-shooter"" instead of a more kind of ""open-world"" game.   Do you even know what an arena shooter is?. We have only seen Walker Assault and the one small mode. There's probably a conquest equivalent.   Basically, what I and lots of other BF players were expecting, was a new BF game. We enjoyed the 2 previous ones, and we allready enjoyed the ""blueprints"" for those games in the way that the games were designed and how the games worked.   It's a reboot.

EA's Dice doesn't even have HALF of the maps that BF2 did on release (not even with the ""free-DLC""), and 1/4th of the planets.

Missions are more polished than the ""campaign"" in 2   What an absolutely hilarious assumption.  Also,arena shooter doesn't necessarily have to be Quake, it can also be used to describe games such as Counter Strike or CoD, which basically is played in small ""arena"" like map. Compared to the vast objective focused maps in BF. Its just the term I use to describe these kind of games.  I am sorry, but I just can't accept EA shitting on one of my favorite franchises, they just can't make good SW games, yet alone a Battlefront game."

battlefront,3aouhd,MakinDessert,5,Mon Jun 22 10:22:09 2015 UTC,"I'm conflicted. This footage definitely shows a huge and impressive game, but was it fun?   In the sense that once a game becomes so big and you can do many things at once, then if both teams aren't fully organized, then it just becomes a clusterfuck of either being incredibly one-sided, or everyone just doing one thing.  This might just be personal preference, but Planetside 2 is a game I just don't like. Sure, the map is huge, and sure, there's hundreds of players at once, but every time I played, the whole map would concentrate on 1 or 2 nodes at a time, and you'd get there and it was just wave after wave of people throwing themselves at a chokepoint until the point was capped after 2 hours of that.  Move on to the next cap point, repeat.  So currently I'm really looking forward to this modern Battlefront, I can understand why people can be upset if they like huge battlefields with a few people scattered around, but I myself very much prefer the rush-style gameplay with fewer players concentrated into clear frontlines that we saw with Bad Company 2, and it looks like Battlefront will focus on that aspect."
battlefront,3aouhd,Satsumomo,5,Mon Jun 22 14:01:51 2015 UTC,"Well, its called Battlefront so a lot of people (myself included) expected a typical battlefront game. If they wanted to make it more into a generic arcade shooter they should have just called it Star Wars Battlearena.  And imo (obv subjective) these kind of games gets boring incredibly quickly, just endless DM rushes with little strategy, and little content to otherwise keep the interest up. My bet is that this gamme will hopefully end up as the next Titanfall, but I guess it won't just because its labeled as Star Wars."
battlefront,3aouhd,Satsumomo,-1,Mon Jun 22 14:39:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, Bad Company 2 is the most repetitive and boring game, this is why everyone hates it and you can't find a single populated server nowadays. /s"
battlefront,3aouhd,MashMango,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:59:07 2015 UTC,"My main concern is the scale of the maps. The E3 gameplay looks great until you realise it's probably taken from 3 or 4 different games. TBH I didn't realise that the players in that demo weren't bots, I assumed they were cos there appeared to be so many of them. And, y'know, it's Battlefront.

battlefront,3ajklq,Kanzuke,2,Sat Jun 20 20:44:37 2015 UTC,"Never watched this before but thanks, good to hear their perspective.  Flight mechanics are a bit concerning, but I do think they're being overly critical of bugs and whatnot considering it's pre-alpha.  Also, I have no experience of how quickly games take to develop but is five months long enough to finish it properly and do it justice? I know they'll be under a lot of pressure from EA to get it out for xmas and to tie in with Force Awakens, but I wouldn't mind it being delayed until Q1 or Q2 next year."
battlefront,3ajklq,MashMango,3,Sun Jun 21 16:52:51 2015 UTC,"Things like how the controls work should be easy enough within the five months they have, the bigger issues would be the hit detection, as that could be anything from janky collision meshes particular to this map that were just thrown together very quickly for this demo, or poor netcode - since players were 'crashing' when it looked like they were 100m away from any surface, this sounds more likely (could be something like the server is predicting where the player will be after 10-300ms (the latency to the server) poorly, finding that position to be inside a rock, and then blowing up their ship).  A lot of the issues brought up here could be fixed, but it depends on priorities and pressure. They invariably will have other maps that still need work, other gamemodes, other map-unique weapons/vehicles/heroes, but hopefully they have allocated time to address the feedback they receive from everyone that got to play at E3. I can't say for certain they will; I never followed the development of the Battlefield games in as much detail, but given how essential flying will be in this game, I do expect we'll be getting a drastically different experience"

But I'm with you I hope they do not add it into the game. I think it would take away from the immersion to have the enemy have a red name or health bar above his head anyways.  Just my 2 cents.

I'm fine with no co pilot but the mini game just sounds so lame. I'd rather have full control of my vehicle at all times . What if an enemy Tie Fighter comes down and starts shooting at you? Am I stuck in the animation watching helplessly? I'd imagine there are scenarios where you'll want to break off. If people crash... so what, they will learn.

battlefront,3a8965,Gamefreak975,9,Thu Jun 18 00:33:42 2015 UTC,"That sounds absolutely awful. Why would anyone put their seal of approval on that?  The reviewer in that video is totally right, Shadows of the Empire did it in 1996."
battlefront,3a8965,Oso-Sic,4,Thu Jun 18 00:40:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like we're making this a bigger deal than it needs to be. So many other, more important things will make or break this game."
battlefront,3a8965,Gamefreak975,3,Thu Jun 18 16:15:04 2015 UTC,"I've been watching the E3 multiplayer gameplay trailer over and over in a fit of rage over this, but bear with me.  I think the mini-game harpoon thing MAY have been for the E3 demo players. If you watch the E3 Battle of Hoth footage, it shows the speeder in 3rd person flying around the AT-AT. Originally I had thought it cut away as soon as the harpoon lands, but it doesn't.   There may be hope after all. I feel like that being a mini-game would be a big deal and they would want the public to know about that, especially after people threw a shitstorm of rage after the on-rails AT-AT reveal."

This is a real challenge, as damage to your vehicle can interrupt the takedown, and you also need to stay closer and closer to the AT-AT for each turn you take around it."
battlefront,3a8965,grimoireviper,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:26:11 2015 UTC,"If you read a bit into it just confirms it, you have to stay closer and closer because in the minigame it gets harder and harder because the area you have to keep the snowspeeder in is getting smaller."

battlefront,3aakvt,petabread91,5,Thu Jun 18 15:21:55 2015 UTC,"This is not how game development works.  A port requires a game to already be completed for a specific platform then to have the underlying engine and any platform specific code to be updated to support a different platform.    Dice creates games for multiple platforms at once, meaning the engine already supports PC, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, and PS4.  The game is not created for one platform then ported to another, its developed with all platforms in mind.  In this case, battlefront is developed with Xbox One, PS4, and PC in mind, meaning the likely have a platform team working on the game for all 3 platforms at all times."
battlefront,3aakvt,invulse,-1,Thu Jun 18 16:54:16 2015 UTC,So much this.
battlefront,3aakvt,ouTPhaze,3,Thu Jun 18 21:23:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think he needs to worry, Frostbite 2 was developed for the PC, then ""ported"" for PS3 and XBOX 360, while Frostbite 3 I think was developed for consoles then ""ported"" to PC for BF4.  Battlefront 3 will be on Frostbite 3, with some tweaks to destruction (afaik) and probably other stuff.    It doesn't really matter though, it's a major developer behind this particular engine, which has been well tested on all platforms through the battlefield franchise, which certainly does not ever feel like an old school console port.  Dice's track record in this area is pretty good."
battlefront,3a8966,Diluxx,6,Thu Jun 18 00:26:15 2015 UTC,"I think it's because of all the backlash Battlefield 4 got when it released broken.  You just need 1 glitch/bug to appear on a gameplay stage demo and everyone would be saying ""another Battlefield 4 launch!"".  It is strange, but it isn't a Battlefront thing. No EA stage demo was free to be recorded. Unraveled wasn't recorded, Need for Speed wasn't recorded, Mirror's Edge wasn't recorded and Battlefront wasn't recorded."
battlefront,3a8966,Storm_Worm5364,2,Thu Jun 18 03:44:07 2015 UTC,"Unraveled    Ah thats good thinking, I was so honed in on battlefront that I didn't notice EA isn't allowing any capture at all. Hopefully that is whats going on here, I want battlefront to be great but so far I just haven't seen a reason to want to buy it besides its star wars. The gameplay looked sort of generic and the stuff I am hearing about vehicle combat is really off-putting."

battlefront,3a8966,infidelappel,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:53:33 2015 UTC,"This has been the same for every DICE release since BC2.  They always follow this order:   Announcement Cinematic in-game trailer Scripted gameplay Singleplayer gameplay (If the game has singleplayer) Multiplayer gameplay from DICE employees / beta testers Multiplayer gameplay from random people from DICE event   Youtubers being able to upload footage was only done with BF4, no idea why it hasn't been done this time, but it honestly isn't that big of a detriment, you'll get footage eventually, and you don't need to preorder if you're not sure how the game is."
battlefront,3a8966,infidelappel,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:10:44 2015 UTC,"Very few AAA titles allow third party recording of the game play shown outside of their stage demos at E3. In fact, I can't think of any that allow it.  Why?   Because the builds that come to E3 are pre-alpha, and usually riddled with bugs. They carefully minimize the problems for what they show on stage, and then when players get to play builds at the booth, there's someone there who can talk them through the problems. They control the caveats that the players receive.  If they just allow people to record it, it pops up online. And then there's nobody there to talk about those bugs, and address whether or not the problems are being fixed in production. The footage gets shared around and picked apart, and next thing you know they have a PR shitstorm to deal with.  Not to mention that all of these titles spend a fortune in marketing. Many of these large games will put more money into marketing than certain core development areas, and when you're marketing a game, there's a careful schedule of media release. Screenshots happen at X weeks before launch. Cinematic trailers Y weeks before launch. Full gameplay at Z weeks.   Allowing people to stroll into E3 demos and record cell phone video of anything they want and put it out there completely ruins the studio's ability to control the marketing and presentation of their product."

But for those of us who actually played the BF franchise, and enjoyed the huge amount of content they provided, we don't accept this so easily. We know what BF is and has been, and we don't like downgrades./altering with the blueprints which allready worked and general casualization."

battlefront,3acjis,Spilcam,3,Fri Jun 19 01:06:30 2015 UTC,"The last two are easy; Campaigns take writers of which DICE has none, and their entire team for this is a bastardization of all the rest  And Clonewars wouldn't work because it's going to be a 4-class loadout system just like all the other Battlefield games and having people unlock 2 eras of 4 class's items and all the attachments for each wouldn't work."

battlefront,3a5qws,TheTurnipKnight,5,Wed Jun 17 17:15:36 2015 UTC,"If EA/Dice thinks flying in a circle around an AT-AT isnt ""Casual enough"" then this developer seriously needs to rethink its difficulty scales."
battlefront,3a5qws,Diluxx,4,Wed Jun 17 17:42:11 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why every studio is tripping over themselves to make games more casual, all you need to do is look at what fps games have the most players on each night and have sustained that player base and it becomes obvious that people want to play games that require skill."
battlefront,3a5qws,TheTurnipKnight,2,Thu Jun 18 00:45:23 2015 UTC,Simply because money. Battlefront is not Battlefield for EA. They're just making Battlefront because of the movie. They want to cash in on the hype fir the movie (as they should). So that's why they're making the game more accessible for the general audience not just hardcore gamerd.
battlefront,3a5qws,Diluxx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:12:08 2015 UTC,"The problem with that concept is that usually the general public takes its que from hardcore gamers. The movie can be counted on to bank some sales, but if the hardcore guys pan the game and word gets around it will have an effect. Casual games aren't appealing to anyone anymore.  Thats why call of duty's popularity is on a decline and why Hardline is one of the battlefield franchises poorest performers. Which is why I don't understand this direction. It speaks of a company that is out of touch with what hardcore and core gamers alike are looking for, some depth."
battlefront,3a5qws,TheTurnipKnight,2,Thu Jun 18 05:34:52 2015 UTC,"EA is quite disconnected from reality, just look at their E3 conference."
battlefront,3a5qws,alexwoodgarbage,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:35:45 2015 UTC,"call of duty's popularity is on a decline   CoD has been on a decline because the previous two iterations came from lesser studios and even then tens of millions bought those games.   When Treyarch - perceived to be the best studio working on CoD - release their BO3, you can count on record sales again."
battlefront,3a5qws,UnderstandingLogic,2,Thu Jun 18 11:32:32 2015 UTC,"COD probably has the most players each night, and that is simple as fuck.  Battlefield probably follows up close, because it's pretty standard too, not much depth there.  Games like Planetside 2, Arma 3, Red ORchestra, etc... have no way near the same amount of people online every night because those games require much more thinking about strategy and how to approach fights, smart flanking and have more difficult to master recoil patterns for their weapons.  This is not what EA is targeting (unfortunately or not) I for one hope that they find a right balance in between ""fun"" direct gameplay mechanics (such as a pleasant ttk, a simple system to get right into action such as direct spawning into vehicles rather than have to wait at my base for 5 minutes and spam 'E' to enter before the 3 other guys who are also waiting) but hope that the meta of the battle (such as those uplink stations and their subsequent powerups) remain more difficult to capture and hold with things such as counter plays between the rebel bubble shield and the AT-AT artillery.  It wouldn't be perfect, but creating a fun experience means more players and means the game will feel alive with plenty of servers rather than it being a more niche market game with few good servers."
battlefront,3a5qws,Diluxx,4,Thu Jun 18 14:16:26 2015 UTC,"Uh yeah, no......http://steamcharts.com/. or http://store.steampowered.com/stats/  The top two games on PC have the highest skill gap of any game out there, COD Isn't even top 25 but Arma is. I dont know about console and its hard to tell because they don't have many alternatives from CoD or BF but on PC everyone gravitates towards games that posses a healthy skill gap."
battlefront,3a5qws,alexwoodgarbage,-2,Thu Jun 18 14:38:37 2015 UTC,"look at what fps games have the most players on each night   So, CoD or Destiny, both of which require skill, are massively popular, and are very accessible, while offering depth to those that want it.  Most players are simply not going to invest time in learning how to pilot something, so it makes a lot of sense making vehicles more accessible. Piloting vehicles needs to be intuitive, and skill needs to be challenged on getting kills and objectives."
battlefront,3a5qws,UnderstandingLogic,3,Thu Jun 18 11:28:25 2015 UTC,Both of which require no skill... Those games are extremely casual and targeted at the most common denominator of gamers. Which is fine in itself since it allows those companies to cash in big money.
battlefront,3a5qws,Diluxx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:18:22 2015 UTC,"Number one for concurrent players most nights is CSGO, if that game doesn't define skill gap I don't know what does. I don't think the the last two call of dutys ever broached 50k after the initial launch so I don't know where you got that from.   As for Destiny, I think that game despite its other problems is a perfect example of how to allow casuals to enjoy a game without neutering its mechanics, its obvious whos who when you play Destiny In the first few exchanges I could tell if a player is top tier or casual by how he moved, used his abilities and his level of accuracy.   I'm not advocating they make the game so complex you need to go to flight school to pilot a tie fighter but there is alot of middle ground to be had between derp level casual and pro gamer, I'm just tired of this ""everybody gets a trophy"" era of games."

battlefront,3a5qws,zdenio,2,Wed Jun 17 19:22:18 2015 UTC,He says that the pickups change over the course of the match. So there would be a point like halfway in where the majority of pickups are flying vehicles.

battlefront,3a5zli,dawsratt,3,Wed Jun 17 14:26:06 2015 UTC,The only two unique items that are ONLY from the deluxe edition are TWO emotes. The 3 weapons can be unlocked. You're literally paying $10 more for a different cardboard case and the ability to fist-pump after a match is over.
battlefront,3a5zli,thedzer,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:24:38 2015 UTC,Deluxe will have emotes and winning emotes much like GTA5. It will also give you an ion grenade and and ion cannon. I don't know if there is more stuff to come. If you look up the deluxe version on Amazon then you can scroll down and see the features described a lot better.
battlefront,3a5zli,joshiedachimp,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:20:49 2015 UTC,"It's also worth noting the ion grenade/cannon are only early access to the weapon, they can be unlocked later. It also gives the DL-44 IIRC."

People are blinded by nostalgia when they think of Battlefront 2 vanilla, to be honest, the game wasn't as perfect as people make it out to be - especially things like the space battles were actually incredibly mundane and repetitive in the base game. (and thats coming from someone who played the game for thousand of hours and semi-competitive)"
battlefront,3a9ra4,Hunter1207,7,Thu Jun 18 11:38:41 2015 UTC,Most of the player base never experienced the game online.  Let alone in a competitive environment.  They have no idea what the game was actually like.

You can't trust the minority of people just because they are on your side.   Besides this, does it even matter if it plays like battlefield? Battlefront was my first FPS, and I'm still playing it. I don't know why everyone is even worried. I just want it to be a fun game. As long as you enjoy playing it it shouldn't be a problem if it plays like something else."

battlefront,3a4zby,AgentTunaGhosty,3,Wed Jun 17 07:15:06 2015 UTC,"No Campaign, no space, no clone wars, 40 players max, 4 planets/12 maps at launch + a free DLC planet, custom classes instead of set classes, health/ammo auto regen, no galactic conquest, no instant actoin  Plus some E3 footage that you'll probably want to see."
battlefront,3a4zby,tns22x,2,Fri Jun 19 19:43:48 2015 UTC,Basically you want to check out the survival mode Co op video and the multilayer prealpha video.
battlefront,3a4zby,skyxsteel,-2,Wed Jun 17 14:06:07 2015 UTC,"This game is a downgrade, imagine all the content of BF2: Space battles/Galactic conquest, campaign/solo, clone wars etc.  Its all missing. And they removed shitloads of mechanics in the game, vehicles are now a fucking powerup along with rocket launcher, classes are removed. Your HP regen is on crack as soon as you leave combat (less than 2 seconds). Max 40 players.  This game should be a failure, but BF ""fans"" will still buy this pile of shit, and let EA keep shitting on their playerbase."
battlefront,3a4zby,xxxcancer_,2,Thu Jun 18 14:12:43 2015 UTC,"FFS you haven't even seen more than two game modes. OP, don't listen to these dumb asses who have a hate boner for EA. Watch the videos that were released from E3 and read through some of the posts. For starters there is a solo game mode. There aren't space battles however you can pilot fighters and dogfight. And there is no ""galactic conquest"". There very well could be a similar game mode but there only being 4 planets (with >= 12 maps) at launch you can't really have a galaxy wide game mode. As for you  mr hate boner I'm glad that rockets and vehicles are power ups now. Rocket spam is infuriating as is vehicle spawn camping. Classes were removed because it's an outdated gameplay mechanic that is no longer required. You now get to customize you're loadout like every modern FPS in existence. I actually quite like their method for health regen. It's essentially what the original halo games were like and it worked really well. Also keep in mind this was for the preview which was likely purposefully made easy for the players/preview recorders and very well could change by the time we see it. They are focussing on the civil war era but I'd rather not have a game a mile wide but an inch deep like the original BFs were. Don't get me wrong I loved them but you can't argue the fact that the eras had very few differences. You also have to keep in mind that it took a helluva lot less time and money to produce assets back in the day. Unless you are privy to a lot more information than the rest of us it's way too early to declare it a pile of shit. Your judgement is blinded by rose tinted glasses and your hate boner for EA."
battlefront,3a4zby,tdogg8,2,Thu Jun 18 16:12:26 2015 UTC,"Before any of us judge a game for better or worse, can anyone here say they have played it? If the game in your opinion is a downgrade or ""remake"" don't get it. If you like the new mechanics and think its a good change get the game. But dont hate, or glorify a game neither of you have played. That in itself is ignorance on both sides."
battlefront,3a4zby,Knootywood,0,Thu Jun 25 15:11:30 2015 UTC,lasses were removed because it's an outdated gameplay mechanic that is no longer required.   You lost it right there.
battlefront,3a4zby,xxxcancer_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:57:15 2015 UTC,What? The only reason classes existed was so they didn't have to make different/changeable models. Nowadays that's not hard to do so you can have any model you want with any gun you want. The only thing that's changed is the ability to not be stuck with only one model.
battlefront,3a4zby,tdogg8,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:21:58 2015 UTC,That's just not even slightly true.

battlefront,3a3bfy,SonicPara,3,Tue Jun 16 22:07:40 2015 UTC,Too far away dude. Most times PC requirements are announced a few weeks before release
battlefront,3a3bfy,StagOfMull,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:18:41 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay.  I have never built a PC before but I plan to build one to play this on the highest settings possible.  Is there a science to guessing the specs to aim for when doing such a thing?"
battlefront,3a3bfy,Slyons89,3,Wed Jun 17 03:19:49 2015 UTC,"Well, considering how high you can crank up the graphics in BF4 on the same Frostbite 2 engine as Battlefront is being made in, you could buy probably buy a GTX 980 or one of the new AMD Fury cards for $500~ and be able to run it at 1440p with every setting absolutely maxed at 60+ FPS. I am totally speculating, but I imagine an R9 290X or a GTX 970 could run Battlefront at high settings or better at 1080p at 60+ fps.  Considering it can run on a PS4 which has the equivalent of a Radeon R9 270 in it, I think the requirements will be reasonably low to play the game, but the Frostbite engine is pretty scalable, so a much more powerful card will be needed to play at high resolutions with every option on max."
battlefront,3a3bfy,skyxsteel,2,Wed Jun 17 05:09:23 2015 UTC,"Not really. Wait a bit because the new gen Intel cpus should be out soon. Get a core i5, k if possible. 16 gigs of RAM and a gtx 970. You'll be pretty much able to run any game for the next 3 or 4 years."
battlefront,3a3bfy,skyxsteel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:10:53 2015 UTC,"Sounds good, thanks for the tip.  Battlefront looks very pretty but is it a good game to base specs off of?  I also am looking to do things like Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen with VR, should I base my build off of those or is battlefront likely to demand more power?"
battlefront,3a3bfy,RedditRobotic,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:36:55 2015 UTC,"In my experience with building PCs, once you start getting into the high end territory you tend to not care about the minimum requirements because it should handle everything. Don't base it off a game's minimum and just follow my basic recommendation. You'll be fine. Remember that even though it looks pretty, dev use lots of tricks to make something look good when its just a lighting trick. Look carefully on wall shadows in games, they look bumpy and 3d but if you look closely its just a lighting trick.  The K editions allow for overclocking versus non K cpus but you also need the right motherboard chipset that supports it to be useful. My stock core i5 goes from 3.1 to 3.4ghz I think but I have it oc'd so it runs at 4Ghz for all 4 cores on stock cooling."

Pre-ordering is a nasty trend that we should try to move away from as a gaming community. I'm all for small bonuses like early game play or beta access or w/e, but things like Arkham Knight is doing are WAY over the top.  You should never have to pick between different versions of locked content based on where you pre-order a game from. That's just insulting to fans."

And thats all I really give a shit about in these huge ""battlefield"" games, just lots of awesome content and cheesy strats.  Now, they want to ""appeal to a broader"" audience by making it into cod, having Vehicles as a fucking killstreak, removing ALL the skill in cable-shooting an AT-AT, FORCING objectives with the AT-ATs (hence the rails).

battlefront,39ytdi,Pinkstonewallfloyd,17,Mon Jun 15 22:39:14 2015 UTC,"So they say. But that doesn't deny the fact that the gameplay was scripted.

battlefront,39ytdi,Gamefreak975,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:17:59 2015 UTC,Yea I can kind of agree with that. But if I recall correctly I think the original battlefront games were like that too. It really just made it seem even more like a battlefront game.
battlefront,39ytdi,SleepIs4DaWeak,-1,Tue Jun 16 17:39:22 2015 UTC,I actually don't remember if the first BF had Luke in his jedi garb. All I can recall are his variable outfits in BF2. Gonna check...
battlefront,39ytdi,Gamefreak975,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:40:53 2015 UTC,Yea I could be wrong its been a long time since I played

battlefront,39ytdi,Gamefreak975,4,Tue Jun 16 16:40:30 2015 UTC,Has there been any news to if you can take your split screen partner online? Or is it restricted to just the little Co op missions?
battlefront,39ytdi,LionsOfDavid,3,Mon Jun 15 23:22:06 2015 UTC,"It looks like it's just coop in the missions. They had a secondary demo in the Sony conference of a coop mission and explained missions includes battles with AI, Jedi Battles, training-esque something, and survival-type something.  Not much explaining the specifics, but ""Missions"" sounds a lot like a rebranded ""Instant Action."""
battlefront,39ytdi,SocketLauncher,3,Tue Jun 16 02:45:53 2015 UTC,Okay. If it's like instant action and has a lot of replayability then it'll be fine.   If it's a linear mission structure then I'll be very upset.
battlefront,39ytdi,LionsOfDavid,3,Tue Jun 16 02:49:36 2015 UTC,"I hope it's more like open ended instant action, and from the game mode names they said it sounds like it. But again, that's a sort of sketchy way to gauge a mode."
battlefront,39ytdi,SocketLauncher,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:08:18 2015 UTC,True. Is there any more information or videos that I can find of the Co op mode? This game already has a buy from me. I just want to know what I'm buying. Thanks!

battlefront,39ytdi,jm419,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:17:24 2015 UTC,"Physically, the wings would be ripped apart during high-G maneuvers.  Physically, the X-wing would have very poor turning abilities in vacuum and a virtually complete lack of lift in atmosphere.    That said - the maneuvers in the Battle of Yavin were based on atmospheric aircraft maneuvering, not true vacuum fighting - so this is where suspension of disbelief comes in."
battlefront,39ynpj,SirRasputin,19,Mon Jun 15 21:25:34 2015 UTC,"If they fix the tick rate  Put a great emphasis on the squad combat  I know that the DLC and stuff is kind of a turn off  But I feel like the have put a great emphasis on this is Battlefront, not Battlefield.  I did not think Battlefield when I saw this trailer, it looked to fluid and reminded me off Battlefront.  I hope there will come more class customization and that we will see them focusing on the team aspect of the game more.  The camera angle where you can adjust from the classic shoulder 3rd person view and to first person is great, I liked the on rails ""commander"" overview from the AT-AT, where you can call down missile strikes.  The class system seems to be of that of like a Battlefield game, which is alright in my book, because it could get kind of redundant in Battlefront after you have played it so many times to keep on playing the same classes.  If they include weaponry from Star Wars Galaxies, they will have tons of different weapons to choose from, one could dream that it would have the same customization as in Fallout (I do not know how they would balance that)  But it looks like this reboot has great potential to become a game worthy of the Star Wars name and a worthy prequel.  This is just my initial thoughts."
battlefront,39ynpj,More__cowbell,4,Mon Jun 15 21:40:53 2015 UTC,If they fix the tick rate   Last i heard they experimented with 64hz-128hz tickrate on BF4 CTE.

battlefront,39ynpj,Hunter1207,-6,Mon Jun 15 21:47:40 2015 UTC,"but that doesnt make sense, its a bullshit argument  the full experience is the base game, without the DLC - the DLC is additional stuff  example: you go to ESL one (base game), but you didnt get a ticket for the afterparty (DLC) - you still got the full ESL one experience, just not the additional afterparty  Splitting the community is technically correct, but honestly, in a game played by as many people as Battlefield (and battlefront in the future) it doesn't matter at all, there will always be some good servers running either vanilla, one DLC only, or all together"

Until they show some real multiplayer footage and the game mechanics going on I am not sold.  Looks like a beautiful game of ""Battlefield rush"" with unchangeable scripted events at this point.  Where is the squadwork?  Show me the cleverly designed game mechanics.  At the moment it's fairy floss and I want a 3 course meal before I pay."
battlefront,39ynpj,tofuwaffles,2,Mon Jun 15 23:58:38 2015 UTC,"It did look pretty heavily scripted. The Snowspeeders turning in formation and the TIE Fighter dive bombing looked epic, but that won't ever happen.  The canyon chase looked awesome too. But in reality you'll both probably just hit the side or...fly over it."
battlefront,39ynpj,smallz86,7,Tue Jun 16 15:00:07 2015 UTC,Im just worried with no AI in the multiplayer the maps are going to feel really empty. Watching that trailer it really seemed like they scripted it to have like half of the enemy team in one spot at all times.
battlefront,39ynpj,bobpndrgn,7,Mon Jun 15 23:04:09 2015 UTC,"This is based completely on what we saw yesterday. Although there is no AI it seems like the maps are much more condensed and have a lot more choke points than in BF2. For example, the Hoth map in BF2 has a huge open space in between the capture points, and nothing happened there, It was only a space so the AT AT could get through the map towards the base. You rarely fought AI in that space because they were at the CPs. If these new maps create more condensed space with less nothingness I think it will be alright.   Again this is going only on what I saw yesterday."
battlefront,39ynpj,Gamefreak975,2,Tue Jun 16 13:10:34 2015 UTC,Maybe they'll update the game with AI :P
battlefront,39ynpj,StagOfMull,2,Tue Jun 16 16:00:49 2015 UTC,"Guys, look for info regarding the announced ""Battles"" mode of play. Sounds like instant-action under a different name. Not confirmed yet but ""teams of AI"" sounds like just that."
battlefront,39ynpj,Norma5tacy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:26:42 2015 UTC,"They said in interviews recently that it is one of the offline modes and it is ""Singleplayer vs AI or vs a friend"""
battlefront,39ynpj,Gamefreak975,2,Thu Jun 18 19:57:27 2015 UTC,It will definitely play differently with no AI but no doubt the servers will be flooded. I'm kind of disappointed in there only being 40 players and not 64 like in battlefield which makes it feel like a battle.
battlefront,39ynpj,dide101,2,Tue Jun 16 05:21:54 2015 UTC,"What happens when the game dips into obscurity in a few years though?  You can go back and play BF2 at any time with a friend or two because there are 60 bots running around with you.  Hoth will look pretty lame with 2 Snowtroopers and one Rebel.  EDIT: I just read some minimal information about a mode they announced called ""Battles"". Hopefully that is teams of AI. Not much out there yet, but it's a hope."

battlefront,39ynpj,Gamefreak975,4,Mon Jun 15 21:31:47 2015 UTC,"I am convinced, this game will be a good movie. It doesn't look very special. Except graphically, it's fantastic."
battlefront,39ynpj,ChesterButtbeard,2,Tue Jun 16 01:44:03 2015 UTC,This trailer looked amazing. But why the jetpacks? I dont understand it. There are zero jetpacks in the movies minus the Fetts. Why does every lowly grunt have a jetpack? That REALLY takes me out of the Star Wars mood.  Watch the co-op trailer and its even more glaringly annoying. One big turn off for me.
battlefront,39ynpj,Gamefreak975,5,Tue Jun 16 03:10:09 2015 UTC,"The fact that jetpacks even exist during that timeline I think justifies it's presence. In Battlefront 2, The Dark Trooper carried a jet pack. But I suspect that it can only be used briefly and will have a long regeneration time."
battlefront,39ynpj,ChesterButtbeard,0,Tue Jun 16 04:38:05 2015 UTC,"Their presence was limited to the Fetts, though, and that is my point. They were rare. Why would they be standard issue equipment among the ground troops? And especially after DICE claimed an unyielding commitment to OT authenticity.  The only reason I bring this up is because I was COMPLETELY absorbed into the multiplayer gameplay trailer. I felt like I was on the ground at Hoth fighting for my life - and then the jetpack appeared and I was like ""wait that's not in Star Wars"""
battlefront,39ynpj,Gamefreak975,4,Tue Jun 16 14:55:30 2015 UTC,"Fair points. I guess they wanna have something with similar appeal to the exo-suit jumping abilities in Advanced Warfare, to attract more people to the new franchise? Dunno."
battlefront,39ynpj,ChesterButtbeard,2,Tue Jun 16 15:42:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most likely.   As much as I'll complain about them, it won't bother me too much if the rest of the game is as immersive as this trailer makes it out to be."

What will you lose in that time? You can catch up quickly with unlocks and levels and all that shit. We all hate what pre-ordering has done to this industry so now is the time to take a stand.

battlefront,3a2e6l,girlsc0utcookies,5,Tue Jun 16 18:15:59 2015 UTC,"What might also make a difference here, is that DICE doesn't seem to be supporting previous-gen consoles with this title, unlike with BF4. This might have given them more room to make the game look better, when the lowest common denominator isn't a decade-old console."
battlefront,3a2e6l,mrmax1984,3,Tue Jun 16 19:19:01 2015 UTC,"Good point! What really interests me is that, from what I've seen, it looks like the photo-realism shown in the Battlefront trailers is much more noticeable than the other big titles shown at E3 so far. Not to say that it has ""better graphics,"" (don't get me wrong, all these other games look AMAZING), it just looks more like I'm watching a live-action movie and not a game, which I think is really cool, especially when your'e talking about a game that's based on an iconic movie trilogy."
battlefront,3a2e6l,Storm_Worm5364,7,Tue Jun 16 23:01:20 2015 UTC,"No. This isn't a Battlefield re-skin.  They are using PBR and photogrammetry, that's why it looks photo-realistic.  The only thing that is from Battlefield in this game is sounds. I heard a ""death-scream"" sound that was in BF4, but that isn't even a problem. It's just a death-scream.  They've already said that they aren't using any of the Battlefield assets. And it really doesn't make sense to use those assets. They can't use any of the meshes since Star Wars doesn't use military-like props. Nor can they use old textures since they have to rework them so that they can work with the PBR tech. So no, this isn't a re-skin of Battlefield."

battlefront,3a2e6l,ScruffCo,4,Tue Jun 16 22:44:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't think this will play like battlefield at all. It seems way more ""arcadey"" and less-hardcore I suppose you would say, which isn't a bad thing either. They continually switched into 3rd person mode and the animations for it and the transition to it actually look pretty smooth, but can you imagine playing battlefield 4 in 3rd person? It wouldn't work.     Opponents take more bullets to die, there are no iron sights, there are power ups on the field (at least in that mode), and the flying will not be as difficult as in battlefield I guarantee it. I don't think they are going to have the same recoil system either where you had to control the recoil while firing in battlefield in order to shoot straight. There will probably be some but not to the same extent.     I think its going to play more like the original games with easier and more approachable gun play, not that battlefield is difficult or anything but it does have more realism with the recoil system. I prefer it this way anyway.    People are saying it looks the same, and it does because its the same engine, same company, and same genre, but I think it is going to play in a totally different way."

battlefront,3a2473,petabread91,10,Tue Jun 16 17:08:24 2015 UTC,"Probably for marketing reasons if I had to guess.  Like, Sony has a deal with them to showcase all the fancy-schmancy graphicson their platform in return for $$$. I dunno.  I think the PC will have the most options for making the graphics look stunningly gorgeous, but they will be relatively similar on all platforms.  I'm the most worried about frame rates at this point. It looked smooth...but how much of it was pre-rendered?"
battlefront,3a2473,Gamefreak975,0,Tue Jun 16 17:10:49 2015 UTC,It's Frostbite 3 engine. It runs very well on really any computer. I wouldn't worry ;)

Did you really already forget about constant crashing among a huge portion of the PC community for a few months? How about the completely inadequate servers on PS4 for literally a year after release? How about the single frame deaths even persisting to this day, actually worse then they used to be. How about BF3 launching with a plethora of missing features that took 3 months for a single patch somewhat finishing the game?"

battlefront,39ynu5,Aetak,2,Mon Jun 15 23:31:40 2015 UTC,"Personally, I had a problem with their emphasis on graphics throughout the Battlefront presentation... I was worried that the gameplay would have taken a hit. What was then shown was very pretty, let's not pretend it wasn't. I'm not entirely sure how much real substance it contained, however. We saw people running and shooting while wearing Star Wars clothing. Did we see starships? No, we saw planes. The only bit that got me truly excited was the ending, but I fear that any kind of jedi experience will be limited to the best players on the team, something I rarely am.  As for singleplayer... once again we briefly hear about missions with nothing more really said. It's clear now that this is a multiplayer game, which is rather upsetting to me. I will be waiting to hear something that convinces me that this game is worth it, that it's not just a reskin of battlefield. Until then... I'm afraid to say that battlefront will not be a purchase for me, especially so near fallout."

The starships look, sound and appear to function like we would like them to. The snowspeeders flying in formation may have been heavily scripted, but the very fact that there is enough depth of control built in that they can vary their speed to fly in formation AT ALL is impressive.  In addition, if you pay attention to the background, there appeared to be big dogfights happening in orbit/low sub-orbit. That gives me hopes for ""atmospheric"" dogfights that would happen WAY above the ground and maybe on the verge of ""space""."

I generally like star wars themed games. This may not be everything that we wanted, but it's a damn good start. Lucas Arts was practically just sold, in game and creative development time table. This is a game we demanded, and just because it won't have everything a first generation game had in content, doesn't mean the next one or third one won't.

Given how insanely lucrative EA's exclusivity deal for publishing Star Wars games will be, it wouldn't surprise me if Disney's taken every copy of every drive containing Free Radical's work on BF3, shredded them, melted the pieces, shredded those pieces again, and shot the whole thing into deep space.

battlefront,356z4l,iRaphael,2,Thu May 7 23:42:09 2015 UTC,"I hope I don't come across as a asshole, but have you ever tried flying a jet in battlefield? It's not particularly easy, but the skill gap (and unlock system makes it so you are at a disadvantage as a noob) is so devastatingly high. As a novice pilot there is quite literally nothing. As in LITERALLY nothing you can do to take down an ace pilot. In a normal shooter you can just shoot someone in the back, work with your team so they have your back. But with the jets it's not the same ball game. The aces have such a fundamental advantage over the average joe that there have been serious talks of just removing jets entirely from the battlefield series.   From what I remember (before the Phantom project thing that required 20 kills for the premium unlock that everyone HATTTTED), so few people use jets, that if you get one kill with one, you would enter division 1 of all players in the world for jets. The top 2 percent of everyone ever. With only 1 kill. That tells me a lot."

Star Wars is one of my absolute favorite things ever, but even a coat of pretty-looking Star Wars paint can't cover up the bland aftertaste identifying it as yet another boring modern shooter.  The new Battlefront is shaping up to be a decidedly 'meh' game with a ton of high-poly Star Wars textures, and that's about it.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to run around making unfounded claims that this is going to be the most vile shit EA's ever published, but I'm not holding my breath.  The fact that DICE keeps talking about what all isn't going to be in the game instead of what is going to be in it is a huge red flag for me."

battlefront,350tkq,ArmorGyarados,5,Wed May 6 03:59:47 2015 UTC,"I'd highly suggest looking into the Battlefront II Ultimate Pack. It does all the heavy lifting and installs the best of the best Battlefront II mods without much effort at all. I'd go into what makes each of them worthwhile, but that post already does a good job of explaining that.  There's even a launcher that lets you choose between sets of mods based on their compatibility with each other, so getting an awesome new Battlefront experience is incredibly easy. I only recently discovered the Ultimate Pack despite having manually used a lot of the mods in it for years, and it's hands-down the best mod collection I've found for Battlefront II.  Supposedly there's a ground-to-space mod somewhere out there that incorporates the feature from Battlefront Elite Squadron on the PSP and greatly improves upon it. I can't really help you with that one, though, since finals are keeping me busy for the next week or so.  Also, if you're into multiplayer, be sure to check out GameRanger. They have a good number of Battlefront II servers that are probably going to become even more populated as time goes on, especially if DICE fucks up the multiplayer in their version. But surely they wouldn't let such an anticipated release become a colossal flop, right?  Anyway, enjoy rediscovering Battlefront II!"
battlefront,350tkq,Mesonic_Interference,1 point,Wed May 6 11:43:55 2015 UTC,So can using this mod collection installer get around the limit or is that one of the compatibility issues still?
battlefront,350tkq,SpikeTheFish,3,Wed May 6 15:26:03 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know if it's possible to circumvent the mods limit. I'm just speculating here, but I'm wondering if the game's binary is linked to its libraries using hard links. If so, at some point you'd eventually be left with nothing but modified files, which would result in a somewhat loose limit on how much modding Battlefront II can take before it starts breaking. (Since the Ultimate Pack expands to about 19 GB after installing, it seems likely that it comes pretty close to modding every Battlefront II file.)  If that's the case, it might still be possible to juggle around the mods within the Ultimate Pack, albeit at the risk of corrupting your install (but not much of a risk if you're using Steam since you can just verify the game cache to get a fresh install). The two mutually-incompatible sets of mods in the Ultimate Pack are labelled 'global' and 'custom,' so it may be possible to manually install some of the global mods by overwriting the custom versions of certain modified files.  However, take all of this with a huge grain of salt. I'm not a modder, but I am making educated guesses based on my experiences when working on large programming projects. I think it could probably work with a little bit of hacking, but that might be too much effort to put into something that's probably just going to corrupt your install anyway.  tl;dr  Probably not."

battlefront,33se5u,lordluigi,4,Sat Apr 25 04:05:38 2015 UTC,"I'm 99% sure the answer is no. It runs on the Frostbite engine, which DICE, regarding banning mods for Battlefield 3, said:  ""if you look at the Frostbite engine, and how complex it is, it’s going to be very difficult for people to mod the game, [...] it’s quite tricky. So we think it’s going to be too big of a challenge for people to make a mod.""  It's funny because it's obviously a load of shit. Modders have been creating better and more advanced content than the base game has since the inception of modding. Just look at Day-Z, DOTA, Garry's mod, and even the Dann_Boeing maps and transformation mods for SWBF2.  It's a real shame that mods won't be a part of SWBF3 because that's what really made 2 fun for me.  BTW if you've never played Rhen Var: Temple or Pepperland: Psychedelia for SWBF2 you're in for a ride. Or play Xmas in Jinglin town as a yoda elf building snow forts to fend against ewok snowball attacks"
battlefront,33se5u,tornato7,2,Sat Apr 25 04:16:56 2015 UTC,Just go ahead and up that to 100% sure. DICE hasn't released a mod-friendly game in years.
battlefront,33se5u,BigDuse,2,Sat Apr 25 06:20:11 2015 UTC,"It's likely they are too cheap to pay for everything that would be required to make the game moddable.  They use a lot of third party tools which is the problem, because you need to get permission for others to use them which would cost money that is if the company they get the tools from agree on that.  Pretty much It'll cost them more money to make it so their games can be modded, then modding could ever bring back so they don't bother with it."
battlefront,33se5u,Jeffgoldbum,2,Wed Apr 29 16:53:51 2015 UTC,"Look at DICE's history with modding. Even look at most triple-a developers' histories with that. Unfortunately, no. They really don't care either way. They know the game will sell. You can look up ""Battlefield 3 mods"" and ""Battlefield 4 mods"" if you want. I've found an article quoting Patrick mentioning the complexity of the Frostbite engine and there's also the fact that it's closed-source and proprietary software. I'd assume it wouldn't be worth the effort."

I hate being restricted to the same two or three weapons. If I don't like any of them the game becomes unpleasant, and it's a waste of money. With custom classes I can fine tune each weapon to suit my preferences. Much better imo."
battlefront,33nu1q,Hungry_Lion,3,Fri Apr 24 02:02:13 2015 UTC,"To each his own. I just prefer less choice. Makes it simple, I'm mainly thinking back to the arcade battlefield. 3 classes and each serve a specific purpose, but that's all the player needed in that game."

battlefront,33nu1q,Hungry_Lion,4,Fri Apr 24 03:33:07 2015 UTC,I'm not talking about Elite Squadron am I? I prefer games where I'm not limited to the same few options. It's one of my biggest gripes with the original Battlefront game. I like being able to find a class build that I am comfortable utilizing long-term. That's my opinion. You don't need to be a dick about it just because you're salty about DICE.
battlefront,33nu1q,Will12239,-2,Fri Apr 24 04:30:35 2015 UTC,Your opinion is based on false pretenses. I'm talking about Elite Squad because what you want/what is planned was already tested and failed in the PSP iterations. Classes were better because there were no cookie cutter builds and you're supposed to be a standard troop in an army not a custom mercenary with special weapons. Multiplayer had about 4 different weapons that everyone used. It's the same with all generic FPS in the past 10 years. Just look at every COD/Battlefield game loadouts. You also cannot have class differences such as a wookie with extra hp or a sniper with little hp.
battlefront,33nu1q,Hungry_Lion,3,Fri Apr 24 04:50:09 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but it's you're comment that is formed on false pretenses. Elite Squadron was developed by a completely different (and largely mediocre) developer. Comparing that class system to a newer one makes absolutely no sense. Battlefield has done a very nice job of giving you options for your loadouts and I expect no less here. I don't see why you're against giving players freedom to choose...  As for you're predicament with the Wookie, the solution is simple. The game allows you to choose you're race as a customization option (we've seen three so far). Choosing Wookie gives you more HP but less speed and agility. Easy."
battlefront,33nu1q,Will12239,-1,Fri Apr 24 05:28:00 2015 UTC,"All custom class systems are the same and have the same problems. Name me one game that has custom classes where there aren't ""best builds."""

battlefront,33nu1q,Will12239,-2,Fri Apr 24 06:38:31 2015 UTC,"derp With the custom classes, by definition, there will always be a best gun. The best they can do to balance that is make a bunch of similar weapons like they already do. And why should Stormtroopers get to choose their weapons. I never saw different weapons amongst the troopers in the movies."
battlefront,33nu1q,Hungry_Lion,3,Fri Apr 24 06:44:09 2015 UTC,"Those are jackfrags favorite classes and attachments. He says so himself. Those are the best for him. Mine are different. Other people's are different.  As for your question about Stormtroopers using different weapons. The answer is that this is a game. Last I checked the U.S. military doesn't use Kalishnikovs, Tavors, or any Chinese rifles but you can use all three in Battlefield. Because it's a video game."
battlefront,33nu1q,Will12239,-4,Fri Apr 24 06:47:15 2015 UTC,"And that is dumb, dumb, dumb. Battlefront II had classes with standard weapons and it was a video game too. Yet it used the best possible representation of the troopers that they could."
battlefront,33nu1q,M4ttchoo,1 point,Fri Apr 24 06:50:32 2015 UTC,"The choice to paint your gun/armor a certain pattern is unnecessary. It has no affect on gameplay skill. again I'll reference halo, it's easy to identify allies from enemy's which supports teamwork. Limiting load out choices also helps because you know exactly what class compliment your allies. It allows a more balanced team. It's like an RTS combat counter. Each class should perfectly counter another. That would requires players to think more and work as a team instead of just mindlessly pointing and shooting."

If anything it should have those features and then some it feels like developers never put full effort into making a game actually worth 60 dollars
battlefront,33mfqx,ouTPhaze,10,Thu Apr 23 18:35:54 2015 UTC,"I said this in another post and I'll put it here too. I 100% believe that they left out all of this stuff because they were trying to hit the Nov deadline. They ""needed"" to have this game come out before Force Awakens so they carved back a lot of stuff we liked.   I'm in no way defending them but I think it might shed some light on why they picked this route. I also believe that we will see at least some of these in future DLC, which will probably cost you 1500 Republic credits."
battlefront,33mfqx,BadassSasquatch,2,Fri Apr 24 00:34:06 2015 UTC,Leave parts of the game but they're still gonna charge 60 for it. Everyone can spend they're money how they want but I won't be supporting this. Watch them sell more maps as dlc then they ship with and watch the inevitable launch issues. These incomplete skeletal games are getting annoying.
battlefront,33mfqx,mostimprovedpatient,-8,Tue May 5 03:00:25 2015 UTC,ROFL no. This game has been in development since around 2011. Battlefront 2 was made in a year and had more content.
battlefront,33mfqx,NimTheDoor,3,Fri Apr 24 09:51:13 2015 UTC,"Unless you have proof, no. This is blatantly wrong. EA didn't obtain rights to the Star Wars games until May of 2013, and at some point in late 2013-early  2014 after the BF4 launch, EA/DICE put Mirrors Edge and Battlefront on hold to fix BF4.  So... yeah no."
battlefront,33mfqx,IlyichValken,0,Sat Apr 25 03:09:08 2015 UTC,"When they bought the rights to Star Wars there was already a Battlefront 3 in development.

The major benefit with spacebattles is that there are no ground units interfering with the dogfights above, now maybe DICE will incorporate an ""Air Superiority"" game-mode like in Battlefield 4 where it's just X-wings and TIE-fighters battling it out with each other. But to me it won't have the effect as having the battles take place in space: there are no pesky map boundaries, you often have to dodge debris that is flying around, taking out Star Destroyers and their lesser counterparts was a helluva lot of fun and I feel like your skills as a pilot are just more tested when it's just starfighter vs starfighter."

The bomb would start on the ground and  Whoever picks up the bomb might be unable to sprint and move slower so will need to be defended.   The game would have 3 stages first you must deliver the bomb across the map on foot to a transport ship, then you have to defend the transport ship all the way into the enemy's hangar, then you have to fight your way through the ship and plant the bomb after which you will get 20 seconds to escape and watch the Levolution event  of the ship crashing to the ground.  In the game you can decide to help defend and deliver the bomb or attack and stop the enemy delivering theirs."

battlefront,33fbqm,WOX_69,0,Fri Apr 24 20:20:40 2015 UTC,"As someone who played the heck out of Battlefront, Battlefront 2 and Battlefield 2142, I can see this: Titan Mode for BF2142 was fun, very fun, one of the best multiplayer experiences I've ever had to be quiet honest, BUT Star Wars, and in particular, Star Wars fans had an expectation, to fight amongst the stars with cool vehicles and having the weight of the galaxy in their hands.  I'll give you an example. Rogue Squadron for the N64, and later PC. Universally loved, one of the best Star Wars games and N64 and Fifth Generation games made. One of things that people wished for in it was space combat, and by the time Rogue Squadron 2 came out, they made sure it was included.  Not shitting on your idea, I, as well as others I'm sure, probably believe it'd be incredibly fun to play. But I believe that it shouldn't be in a situation where it's this or space combat. And I'm almost certain the grand majority of people, if pegged, would take space combat over this if it came down to it."

battlefront,33i95c,OMMFGitsAustin,2,Fri Apr 24 22:37:45 2015 UTC,"Well actually it's the 6th video game called Battlefront, so Battlefront 3 is wrong on all occasions."
battlefront,33i95c,Skatinbrad,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:06:30 2015 UTC,"The EA circlejerk is so strong on here, I can understand titles have been ruined and the entire gaming industry has changed, but to place blame entirely on one game is naive.   The reality is that a game that requires a massive budget and investment will have DLC's for $$$. That's the way the world works now. Video games gross billions, they sometimes compare to blockbuster films for the sake of revenue and consumer interest.  For those casting doubt on this title, I totally understand. But what we were given was a very basic overview of what to expect, there's still months ahead of unveiling and release to be done to really flesh out what the game holds.  I understand the disappointment in the lack of the popular game modes, it sucks. But I think people are jumping the gun on the game's potential, as it's too early to accurately determine how much content will be available and what game modes, maps, etc. This is more than a cash-grab, it's arguably the most anticipated title of the year and the most anticipated Star Wars game series available. There's much more at stake here than another Battlefield title.  If it means anything, remember this game has millions of dollars invested into it and is likely the shining product for Dice and EA. With the weight and expectation to ensure this game will succeed by Disney and the like, I would keep expectations low but there's certainly surprises in store and much more to come in the next months.  The reality is, you can't make an accurate purchasing decision until we have a better understanding of what the game has to offer. Right now, we're given a relatively small amount. Basing your decision off a fraction of content and what the title doesn't hold as opposed to what it does is naive. Time will tell."
battlefront,33i95c,mcpaulus,5,Wed Apr 22 20:31:03 2015 UTC,"I get ALL of this, but why would I pay another 260$ for a game I already have?    it's arguably the most anticipated title of the year and the most anticipated Star Wars game series available.   WAS. Was the most anticipated. Now half of us are hopeful fools and the other are depressed realists.    The reality is, you can't make an accurate purchasing decision until we have a better understanding of what the game has to offer. Right now, we're given a relatively small amount. Basing your decision off a fraction of content and what the title doesn't hold as opposed to what it does is naive. Time will tell.   The thing is, I don't want a new game. I want battlefront, not battefield in star wars. BF2 only added to the franchise, BF3 is taking EVERYTHING they added away and adding a HUGE price to it. I don't care if that's the only way they will make billions of dollars, because that's the reality, the people at the top don't want to give up their huge salaries so they make a mediocre game and have people pay double the original price for a full game."
battlefront,33i95c,mcpaulus,2,Wed Apr 22 20:40:48 2015 UTC,"You don't have to pay 260$. You don't have to buy all the DLC's.  I play a lot of Battlefield 4, but I haven't bought more than 1 DLC. And you know what? I'ts no problem at all.  And I get what you mean man. You want a better version of battlefront 2. Again I will turn to the battlefield series. I freaking loved battlefield 2. Then 3 came out and I was soooo disappointed. Why couldn't they just add to the franchise, instead of ""wrecking"" the whole game.  But after a while I started enjoying #3. I actually felt it was a good game. Sure I still missed some things from #2, and there were some things I didn't agree on, but all in all it was\is a better game.  My point here is, give it a chance! Yeah you can't have all space battles which sucks, but that would be like air superiority in the Battlefield franchise, and that's really not that fun...  EA might suck. Their last game, Hardline was a disaster. Battlefield 4 was a disaster at launch, now its great. Maybe they've learned.  My point is: Do not pre-order it. Wait for the neutral critics, and then maybe you'll get positively surprised."
battlefront,33i95c,mcpaulus,0,Thu Apr 23 23:11:54 2015 UTC,"Just a few random points: Hardline is proof they haven't learned, and my point is that the best thing that could happen is I pay 200 bucks in DLC to get what I already have"
battlefront,33i95c,mcpaulus,0,Fri Apr 24 00:04:22 2015 UTC,"Well...I think Hardline so far have only sold like 3 million copies or something. Compared to the 18 million BF4 sold. I might be a bit off here though, but the point is; even EA have to learn after such a mistake :)  And yeah, I do get what you are saying. But I will say again. You do not need the DLC's. And Battlefield 3 was not just a game with updated graphics compared to Battlefield 2. Let's be real here...it's a brand new and great game. The new battlefront could also be great."

battlefront,33g60n,MadhuttyRotMG,-2,Wed Apr 22 13:12:11 2015 UTC,I personally think they did the right thing to axe the single player story mode.  There are plenty of single player experiences already and axing that content allows them to focus on the core multiplayer.
battlefront,33g60n,Lee_Kevin,5,Wed Apr 22 06:49:22 2015 UTC,"""Focus"" seems like a serious overstatement. They focused on making a Battlefield 4 expansion with new assets. I would understand if ripping out SP means vastly expanded MP experience, but this is not the case. They pretty much gutted the MP experience compared to previous games.  EA and Frostbite seem to think graphics > gameplay and sadly there are many who buy into that.  For the rest of us, there is still Star Citizen PU in 2016 (fingers crossed)"
battlefront,33g60n,evilfurryone,2,Wed Apr 22 07:04:17 2015 UTC,Then the game shouldn't be at full price. No multiplayer only game should. Only a fool would pay $60 for a game that can be rendered almost entirely unplayable once they decide to shut down the servers. At least with a full fledged single-player there's a point to the game besides the multiplayer.
battlefront,33g60n,YellowSev,-4,Wed Apr 22 17:39:05 2015 UTC,Good thing they're not making Battlefront 3 then.
battlefront,33g60n,Hunter1207,2,Wed Apr 22 15:19:52 2015 UTC,"I'm so sick of this defense. Tomb Raider was a reboot and it managed to keep the core gameplay of the series intact. Same with Deus Ex: Human Revolution and the same with many other reboots. EABF has very little in common with it's predecessors. None of the game modes are returning, the player cap has been nerfed and there's no classes. The only thing it has in common (besides the Star Wars name) is it's ability to switch between First and Third Person."
battlefront,33e50h,RoboWarrior3215,2,Tue Apr 21 20:04:39 2015 UTC,"Will 8GB of RAM and Nvidia geforce 740m be enough to run this game on high graphics?   It depends.  If I assume you're playing at 1080p and that you would accept as low as 30fps, then probably not, since a GTX 740m is weaker than current consoles AFAIK."

I'm used to running games between 70-100FPS"
battlefront,33e50h,jonnywoh,5,Tue Apr 21 23:11:00 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, there's not much you can do to improve performance on a laptop.  You already have enough RAM and I think your processor is probably OK.  Laptops often can't have the graphics card upgraded at all.  As to why GTAV runs so much better than BF4, BF4 has more detail in the player models, weapons, etc.  In addition, some games are just more efficient than others for a variety of reasons."

By the time episode 4 rolls around, majority of the clones were killed and replaced. The only battle in the original trilogy that the 501st are seen in is the destruction of the shield generator on Hoth.

battlefront,33aiz2,samuelludwig74,3,Mon Apr 20 23:55:35 2015 UTC,"DLC is almost always a cash grab, and is almost always items or additions that should have been in the base game. Rockstar does it great with GTA V, adding things for free, and making them available to everyone from the start, unless you need money in game, which you can purchase, but it doesn't really give you an advantage. It just gives you cool looking cars.   Things like the Battlefield series, on the other hand, bring in new maps, which are generally more exciting than the measly 8 included with the stock game, and even new weapons, vehicles, and functionality that should definitely be available to everyone, whether they are overpowered or not."

battlefront,33aiz2,samuelludwig74,3,Tue Apr 21 02:09:25 2015 UTC,"I love the way GTA V does DLC.   Rockstar makes all the content available to everyone, both in SP, if you don't have a premium service on console like PS+ or XBLG, and they also make it available in online. The only paid DLC is money, which just makes getting the new content a bit easier. It is entirely possible for everyone to get to the new content, and that't what I love. Why single out the people with money? You just piss people off that way."
battlefront,33aiz2,TheCatapult,2,Tue Apr 21 02:15:07 2015 UTC,"Seriously, have the rose tinted glasses already come on? GTA was a case study in how not to launch an online game. I hope Battlefront is nothing like it.  It was a grind unless you cheated to incentivize spending money on in-game cash. Spending real money should never result in getting fake money or anything expendable. All the customization was ridiculously expensive and missions were boring, repetitive, and didn't pay out hardly.  They made it appear as if races and missions were seamlessly implemented into the free roam, which was an outright lie.   There was no effective way to incentivize players not to be dicks. A couple of high school friends with a lot of free time to grind/cheat could run roughshod through a room with the only options being to leave, avoid or get killed over and over.   Now they're finally (sort of) delivering on the heist promise in hopes of getting people to double and triple dip."

Great, a complete game was delivered and very well, and no DLC's yet. And I'm going to need to play Devil's Advocate on why the Online launch was substandard. Rockstar had simply never really done anything on that scope before, they had basically an alpha version with GTAIV, but even that didn't have the ""mission system"" that GTA Online has. I personally think that the online missions were done well anyway. And if your only goal was to grind to get pretty stuff, then I don't know why you would play it in the first place, I never grinded in the story for anything, and with all the free/non-level-restricted update guns, level gaps didn't create unreasonable challenges. And I'm sorry, but being dicks is kinda what GTA is all about, especially Dickifying yourselves as a team. I've been playing for a while and never paid cash for anything or grinded."
battlefront,33aiz2,TheWaffleKingg,1 point,Tue Apr 21 04:15:53 2015 UTC,"The single player is fun to free roam in (a glorious time suck) but the story takes the controller out of the players hands so often it feels like playing a glorified taxi game at times. I get that what some people want but the ""you plan the mission"" is a cheap gimmick. The player is rarely truly in control outside of shooting in free aim mode. The commentary in the game swings between pretty funny and 2edgy4me.  You're honestly going to defend the same 4 missions over and over for $9,000 payouts at best for the first 40 levels? Then they even went and reduced that amount to like ~$4,500.  The design created immense gaps since cheaters had RPGs, mini guns and fully upgraded and armored Adders within a week.  The only reason a lot of people were able to afford apartments (which were all exactly the same) was the apology handout.  If the cops were at all a challenge or implementing a ""your the cop"" mode online was all they needed to give some recourse for players to go after the person that murdered them. The community is toxic on a level I have never experienced in an online community.  It's fun with friends, but I can't see myself thinking fondly to that time spent ""with"" friends when free time becomes rare."
battlefront,33aiz2,TheWaffleKingg,1 point,Tue Apr 21 04:47:34 2015 UTC,"Well, tbh, I've only played with friends and haven't actually done missions lately, and I myself never ran into hackers that I know of, in fact, I always felt pretty advantaged for some reason, like I was always playing people who never played singleplayer (this is back near release). I'll admit, the missions are a bit repetitive, but I never considered them a focus, I rarely do/did them, I just roam and fly shit. There is a problem now though, however, people who have exported their saves have level 120's and are fully decked out just decimating the competition (as fun as it is rpging a $1,000,000 car, insurance be damned). Some matchmaking would be nice, but idk if I can see it happening anytime soon. Like I said, I don't do missions much, but I think I remember certain survival missions pumping out some considerable cash."
battlefront,33aiz2,BigDuse,1 point,Tue Apr 21 04:57:41 2015 UTC,Premium on battlefield is actually $60 USD. you get all the dlc that comes out and extra stuff but its outrageous for them to  basically buy the game twice just to get the whole game
battlefront,33aiz2,mostimprovedpatient,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:11:12 2015 UTC,$60USD extra?
battlefront,33aiz2,BigDuse,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:31:00 2015 UTC,Mhm
battlefront,33aiz2,mostimprovedpatient,0,Sat Apr 25 05:38:17 2015 UTC,That's pretty disingenuous since the base game has plenty of content for $60.
battlefront,33aiz2,BigDuse,1 point,Sat Apr 25 06:09:25 2015 UTC,I bet they'll put out more maps through dlc than they ship with.
battlefront,33aiz2,mostimprovedpatient,0,Tue May 5 03:11:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm still not opposed to that so long as the base game has a reasonable amount of content at launch. They've just confirmed 12 maps at launch (not including singleplayer/coop missions), which is pretty good for this day and age of increased graphical fidelity (though I'm still disappointed at the small number of planets)."
battlefront,33aiz2,horribleone,2,Tue May 5 04:12:52 2015 UTC,There's no single player. The co-op will be like spec ops from cod. It'll take place on the same maps. It's just not enough. I expect more from a team that big who are creating a multiplayer only game. The maps will be bland too. Watch.
battlefront,33aiz2,Cavs032,0,Tue May 5 04:20:54 2015 UTC,"While there's no proper campaign, DICE has stated that the coop missions can be played alone. The rest of what you've said hasn't been confirmed to the best of my knowledge. If it has though, I'd like to read about it."
battlefront,33aiz2,ParasiticGamer,1 point,Tue May 5 05:15:40 2015 UTC,When they did that live stream they talked about the co-op mode and game informers new article has a bunch of info such as the map launch being 12 maps.
battlefront,33aiz2,dmcdougal24,0,Wed May 6 01:42:42 2015 UTC,i think they should  rename DLC (downloadable content) to MGC (moneygrabbing content)
battlefront,33aiz2,olddoubleratbling,2,Wed Apr 22 06:29:31 2015 UTC,It probably won't be space battles. It will be just like air superiority. So we don't even get new space maps or a main ship to attack. Just dogfighting over the older maps
battlefront,33aiz2,olddoubleratbling,3,Tue Apr 21 04:18:37 2015 UTC,"I can also see the same for the long lost CIS and Clone campaigns. :( good bye old fashion gaming where you buy a game for a full finished game, and hello more half made work that I can pay even more money for!  The Clone campaigns will end up being just like Battlefield Bad Company's Vietnam DLC..."
battlefront,33aiz2,olddoubleratbling,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:56:22 2015 UTC,I agree that the Episodes 1-3 CIS and Clone battles will be DLC. I think that much was implied in last week's presentation. I really don't think they'll do space battles in the first installment of Battlefront. It will either be left for future iterations or a different title.
battlefront,33aiz2,cargobroombroom,4,Wed Apr 22 19:47:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's time to kill all the hype. I mean there is still hope that they won't ass fuck us, but it's unlikely. They will probably pull a george lucas Warning!!! You can never un-see this!!!"

battlefront,33aiz2,lostale,0,Wed Apr 22 14:45:19 2015 UTC,"If they deliver a solid core experience with the base game, and if the Space DLC is packed with enough content, I'll be okay with this. But if the core game experience ends up half-assed..."
battlefront,33aiz2,BigDuse,6,Mon Apr 20 23:29:14 2015 UTC,"I hate paid DLC. Unless it's something like Assetto Corsa, where you have laser measured models of cars and everything is super accurate. But, with something like this, you have only the ability of your modelers. I think that the base game will be kind of good, but it will be missing space battles and a plethora of maps that we had in BF2. I don't want to pay another $60+ in DLC for something I can be playing from 7+ years ago."
battlefront,33aiz2,Hungry_Lion,6,Mon Apr 20 23:40:35 2015 UTC,"You should never be okay with it. It'll probably be an unlockable DLC. It'll be in with the standard game but behind a paywall. Fuck EA, they don't deserve my money."
battlefront,33aiz2,mostimprovedpatient,4,Tue Apr 21 00:59:12 2015 UTC,"I've never played a DICE game with DLC like that so that's a rather baseless assumption. Every DLC they've put out with Battlefield has been very substantial, so that's what I'm expecting here. At least until proven otherwise."
battlefront,33aiz2,Hungry_Lion,3,Tue Apr 21 01:02:42 2015 UTC,"The question is though, as loaded as it is, would you rather it was released as part of the base game, or as a paid DLC several months down the line?"
battlefront,33aiz2,Lycanther-AI,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:11:08 2015 UTC,"It's a difficult question, and the answer is dependent on a lot of factors. One thing I'm really taking into consideration is that they're building this game from scratch. Battlefront 2 had the first game to build off of. They don't. So what it essentially comes down to is the final quality of both the core game and our hypothetical space DLC. If it is clear that the latter was not included in the base game because they were focused on building the best base game that they could, then I'll be okay with it.   Basically, I would prefer the one that results in the most solid game experience."
battlefront,33aiz2,IlyichValken,3,Tue Apr 21 01:18:58 2015 UTC,"Except they're not building the best base game they can, they're building the most cost effective game they can. No developer wants to release a bad game, but they're under the time and budget constraints set by EA who's goal is to maximise profit, not end user experience.... And EA's reputation is as egregious as it is deserved."

battlefront,33aiz2,SKLKNKR,2,Tue Apr 21 01:36:59 2015 UTC,It totaled up to 100+ weapons and 20 extra maps and 8 new game modes. That's pretty fuckin' substantial. You can't possibly believe that is something that should have or could have been on the main game. 30 maps is not a feasible goal for a game at release. Not on the scale of Battlefield maps anyways.
battlefront,33aiz2,SKLKNKR,2,Tue Apr 21 01:54:09 2015 UTC,If they're shipping a multiplayer only game then they should be shipping with more multiplayer maps than usual.
battlefront,33aiz2,SKLKNKR,1 point,Tue May 5 03:13:30 2015 UTC,"What's the point of making a game that isn't satisfying after 3 months? It just means you need to add new content. But releasing that content for more than it should be, and having it not be refined as it can be, and giving the end user a bad experience after they pay another half of the games initial worth just to get another month out of it is BS, in my opinion, whether it's 200 maps, 800 gamemodes, and 10000+ weapons, or 1 map, 1 gamemode, and 1 weapon."
battlefront,33aiz2,samuelludwig74,3,Tue Apr 21 02:04:02 2015 UTC,Isn't that subjective? It was satisfying way past three months to me. I bought the first DLC a year later myself.

battlefront,339qv6,Vaturius,16,Mon Apr 20 20:43:26 2015 UTC,"I think what they could've done was implement the Titan game-mode from BF2142 into the space battles. It would've been really cool to see that, space battles needed little improvement in my opinion. :)"

I would prefer DICE focus on what they are doing with ground/aerial combat and see another studio make a X-Wing reboot or something, maybe to tie in with Rouge One."
battlefront,339qv6,GhostdadUC,3,Mon Apr 20 20:41:39 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Space combat is a huge frontier that hasn't been capitalized in modern gaming. And I think battlefront will be the one to take control of it. I just think it's too early for them to push it out yet. I want a perfect space system that other games can look to for reference. I would rather have a perfect land combat system only rather than both a mediocre land system and a mediocre space system
battlefront,339qv6,nolightspared,2,Mon Apr 20 20:46:59 2015 UTC,"With the recent popularity of Star Citizen, Elite: Dangerous, No Man's Sky, etc, I think space sims are definitely back in vogue. It's only a matter of time before that trend is tapped by EA/Disney with a Star Wars title. And I look forward to it."
battlefront,339qv6,DarthSindri,14,Tue Apr 21 00:22:46 2015 UTC,"Not for me.  Space Battles are a cool feature but aren't really core to the Battlefront series in my opinion.  As you stated they only appeared in the 2nd game and the AI was buggy as hell with them.  I do think they might be added in the future, via DLC or a sequel game, but I'm not really that bent out of shape at their absence."
battlefront,339qv6,samuelludwig74,3,Mon Apr 20 19:58:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly. When I think of battlefront and a new a battlefront game, I don't think of space battles.

They could have done a lot with the concept like adding them to a Rush mode where you start off in space and, after destroying the enemy ship, move on down to the planet to finish the fight."
battlefront,339qv6,_xGizmo_,0,Wed Apr 22 14:40:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, the game will not be perfect even without the space battles.

battlefront,339qv6,SKLKNKR,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:26:13 2015 UTC,Right. I think Dice has an opportunity to really craft a fantastic space battle system that has more to it than what you just said. It just takes time

battlefront,339qv6,Lackest,6,Mon Apr 20 22:49:20 2015 UTC,That's my opinion completely!
battlefront,339qv6,stoudtco,2,Tue Apr 21 00:08:34 2015 UTC,"How can you judge a game based on a feature that isn't part of it   You can compare it to the previous games in a series (reboot or not) in terms of features, gameplay and whatnot quite easily. That said, I do think it's too early for anyone to say that they won't buy the game at all. For all we know they managed to implement another feature that's different, yet just as much fun as space battles were."
battlefront,339qv6,taijituii,-1,Wed Apr 22 14:43:39 2015 UTC,"I think that after a decade, saying features added/removed as a way of comparison is silly.

That's what I'm not understanding about the outrage.  The absence of a feature doesn't mean that the presence of others will be worse.  I for one look forward to less bloat, and I wish games like battlefield and CoD would do this more often: don't feel pressured to add features just to satisfy the need for more=improvement.  I obviously wish that there were more players, and a driveable AT-AT and space battles.  But until I know what I'll be getting instead, I won't act like this is a war crime.  Once I do know that the game will be disappointing, I'll gladly criticize along with you.  (Case in point: /r/rainbow6"
battlefront,339qv6,FGHIK,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:28:54 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, but I just think it's sad if basically the only thing to have improved over ten years (and in fact not gotten worse or been dropped completely) is the graphical quality. Of course that's going off the very limited info we have now, so it might turn out to be one of the best Star Wars games ever... it's just not looking too good now imo."
battlefront,339qv6,Tsuumz,3,Wed Apr 22 23:23:17 2015 UTC,"Yes.   The funny thing is that when the DICE GM gave an interview to IGN he states ""Most battles (in star wars) take place on land"" but I don't really agree with this.   I remember the blockade runner scene, the assault of the Death Star the pursuit through asteroid field, the battle over coruscation, the assault on the second Death Star.   Those are the battles I always loved, those are the battles I want to be apart of. Ground based combat was always secondary to the epic space battles of Star Wars."
battlefront,339qv6,phrawst125,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:28:32 2015 UTC,"I think he was referring to most battles in the game not in the franchise in general. And even if it was it is extremely likely more battles take place on land because it costs a lot of money to battle in space, that being that the only people who can really consistently battle in space are large groups such as the republic or cis. Also there are hundreds of planets with politics we don't take into account. So there must always be battles going on on land, while there would only we space battles when there are two massive waring groups."
battlefront,339qv6,phrawst125,7,Wed Apr 22 15:39:35 2015 UTC,"No, didnt expect them to be completely honest. Would be cool, and I dont see how much more work they could be to add in (this is fucking EA we're talking about, boats of money).   TL;DR They would be fucking awsome but EA/DICE:, ""It two harrrwd :( *sniffle.""  We'll get what we get i guess."
battlefront,339qv6,FGHIK,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:46:08 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it's less the difficulty/effort thing and more the ""more money"" thing. Which hey, say what you want about it but it's a proven strategy"
battlefront,339qv6,Tandoori_Pizza,11,Mon Apr 20 20:53:26 2015 UTC,"Why shouldn't it?  ""because the game can still be good"" isn't an answer.  The people that want space battles in Battlefront have every right not to buy the game or pay any attention to it, you're acting like they are breaking the law."
battlefront,339qv6,opticscythe,8,Mon Apr 20 19:54:41 2015 UTC,"Didn't mean for it to come off like that at all, just looking for other people's opinions   I agree it's their right, but I wonder if they would not buy the new batman game because it doesn't feature their favorite character or their favorite venue. Still, their choice, but I think they would be missing out"
battlefront,339qv6,broomsticks11,3,Mon Apr 20 20:02:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input!
battlefront,339qv6,iamsorry88,5,Mon Apr 20 20:10:59 2015 UTC,Absolutely not. I only played the first so yeah.
battlefront,339qv6,olddoubleratbling,5,Mon Apr 20 20:12:12 2015 UTC,"Space battles were fun   for one or two rounds. I was done after that, then played land matches for the next two hours until another space map came up.   Honestly I don't mind. As long as there's a ""Base attack"" style gamemode where I can break their shit, spacebattles can go."
battlefront,339qv6,yaminub,2,Mon Apr 20 23:51:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely. What was that one in the original battlefront.. Endor? Yeah it was definitely Endor. Loved that one"
battlefront,339qv6,Bravo777,2,Mon Apr 20 21:41:56 2015 UTC,"When I thought there would be space battles, I was on the fence, but now I one buy this game unless it releases and the general consensus is very good. I wasn't expecting to be able to do space to ground battles but I did expect space combat, hopefully involving multiple capital ships.  I doubt they'll have Dlc to bring in space battles, based on their track record that's more than they'd implement in just one Dlc. If they did it prob take forever and charge another $40. EA has burned us all many times over many consoles and game franchises with empty promises and missing content.  I fucking love any and all starwars.wikia.com things and I was so happy to see that battlefront 3 was coming, but now EA has done it again."
battlefront,339qv6,AceHomefoil,2,Mon Apr 20 22:23:05 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, people have been constantly burned and let down by EA and really just the gaming industry.. So I can't blame them when they get upset over smaller things like this"
battlefront,339qv6,Xiphoidn,2,Mon Apr 20 21:21:34 2015 UTC,"I think that it would suck not to have them, but, it's not a deal breaker; just very upsetting."
battlefront,339qv6,DJ_Lud,2,Mon Apr 20 22:24:00 2015 UTC,"Space battles were the closet part of the game for me. They were an awesome inclusion and I am very disappointed that they won't be in this game, significantly lowering the chances that I buy it."
battlefront,339qv6,Gamefreak975,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:42:01 2015 UTC,I think for a lot of people (maybe you)buying it is gonna depend on the general consensus of the game after its release
battlefront,339qv6,Luna2112,2,Mon Apr 20 22:52:13 2015 UTC,Yeah it sucks but I would wager that they left it out so they could launch before Force Awakens releases
battlefront,339qv6,JoeyKuel,2,Tue Apr 21 00:09:39 2015 UTC,"why not call it land wars! since theres no space ""we want to capitalize on the original trilogy"" so no death star no death star 2 no bespin. basicaly they want to capitalise on their scanning technology that let them get high detail scans of plants rocks props etc to save time on modeling. i mean why bother modeling a kick ass alien planet or lunar sized battle station when you have a perfectly good chunk of tunisia or callifornia or norway. just sounds like DICE used it as an excuse to go on holidays and star wars was a side effect. kudos for treating people to the most realistic looking star wars yet, and fuck DICE for ignoring the existing fanbase."
battlefront,339qv6,NewerEngland,2,Tue Apr 21 01:08:16 2015 UTC,"Absolutely a deal breaker, but also the fact that the game ships with literally no maps, planets , or galactic conquest mode. Absolutely disgraceful"

battlefront,339qv6,DukeofGebuladi,2,Tue Apr 21 10:09:13 2015 UTC,Space Battles was literally half the game. Can I pay half price for the game?
battlefront,339qv6,adofthekirk,3,Wed Apr 22 18:56:47 2015 UTC,People are delusional if they don't think space battles will be added in an xpac.
battlefront,339qv6,IlyichValken,3,Thu Apr 23 03:59:05 2015 UTC,I tend to agree with you here. If they added space combat in dlc I don't see how it could be the best it could be.   Space combat is something you use to sell the second installment
battlefront,339qv6,adofthekirk,3,Mon Apr 20 20:56:22 2015 UTC,"I am chalking it up to purely a deadline decision. They probably don't have the time to implement it properly by the target release date. That doesn't mean its not being worked on to be added later, or like you said saved for part 2. People need to chill, the game looks sick."

battlefront,339qv6,ParasiticGamer,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:21:37 2015 UTC,"When I think of battlefront, I think of a make your own story star wars game. I just recently went through as if obi-wan never went to tatouine and instead went to kamino and had new clones made, and re-took the galaxy for his new rebublic, and a HUGE part of that was things like space battle above kashyyk, and then land battle, so yes I think it won't be the same without it. Will I still buy it? I'm still thinking about it. I go back and forth between ""well this is just the next edition, it's going to be amazing no matter what"" and ""what about the prequals huh? forget about how hyped up that was?!?!?"""
battlefront,339qv6,Deepjay,1 point,Tue Apr 21 05:01:18 2015 UTC,"The deal breaker for me is no Clone Wars era, no Galatic Conquest and no Hero Assault. If Ny of these was included I'd purchase it day one."

Literally everything he asked about isn't in the game in some form.  EDIT: for your information both classes and controllable AT-AT's (on Endor at least) have been confirmed not to be in the game.

battlefront,33bdyd,SKLKNKR,2,Tue Apr 21 20:32:13 2015 UTC,"Tbh, if you played the AT-ATs correctly in earlier battlefronts, all you did was drive it straight up to the rebel base before it was eventually destroyed. It's not like they were highly mobile and people drove them all over the map. So I don't think having them on rails will be all that big of a deal, especially compared to other problems like non-controllable bombers and the like."
battlefront,33bdyd,tomanonimos,2,Wed Apr 22 14:34:05 2015 UTC,"Money.  I have an issue with no classes but it isn't Battlefront related.  In the fast paced world of shooters it is vital to quickly identify who to engage first, and a heavy customization option (like this game seems to have) means it takes a lot longer do identify the guy with the shotgun over the guy with the assault rifle."

battlefront,335q8v,grimoireviper,7,Mon Apr 20 11:48:02 2015 UTC,They were probably pissed that the only reason the game got canceled was because LucasArts didn't want SWBF3 to be as bad as Haze. One semi-bad game made them scared.

battlefront,335q8v,Joker_Robinson,0,Mon Apr 20 14:45:48 2015 UTC,It's never a game developers job to listen to the public. It never has been. Granted the ones who don't listen to the fans are idiots but the point I'm trying to say is that you guys are are getting shocked that this game isn't going to be a carbon copy of a game that was made by a different company. Would you get shocked if blizzard got the ip to half life and didn't have Gordon freeman in it? This is dice they know how to make a battlefield game. I'm just worried it's going to be battlefield 5: star wars
battlefront,335q8v,Stormcroft,5,Mon Apr 20 15:10:48 2015 UTC,But they had it handed to them on a silver platter.
battlefront,335q8v,Joker_Robinson,4,Mon Apr 20 15:35:01 2015 UTC,Working on someone else's code can be a real pain. Working on another company's code would be an unimaginable nightmare. It is definitely much smarter to start with the stuff Dice has rather than trying to resurrect an old version of Battlefront III.

Honestly, I've been super defensive about this game these last few days simply because all this bitching is getting fucking irritating. People are just looking at numbers and calling that content rather than actually considering the quality of what we're getting. 10 nice maps are infinitely better than thirty shitty ones."
battlefront,335q8v,Hungry_Lion,3,Sun Apr 19 22:13:34 2015 UTC,"That argument might work if the maps weren't gold in battlefront 2. Claiming they're somehow improving quality while removing key features and number of maps is ridiculous. The game might be more balanced sure, but you know what the most balanced game ever is? Fucking pong. And then you add in that they can't match a ten year old game two generations old in content? Are you fucking kidding me? It's not battlefront, it's star wars themed battlefield, but they want that easy hype."
battlefront,335q8v,FGHIK,-12,Wed Apr 22 19:13:21 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more! Just look at BF3, the maps where so much garbage that they made me back away from the game."
battlefront,335q8v,JamesVirtus,4,Mon Apr 20 03:02:39 2015 UTC,"The maps in BF3 were actually all excellent - I can't think of a single map that is genuinely bad (Even Metro was pretty cool, but only with 24 players). BF4, on the other hand, was an absolute shitfest and the pinnacle of awful map design."

battlefront,335q8v,volkommm,2,Mon Apr 20 09:57:05 2015 UTC,"Seine is one of the top 5 rush maps and is excellent in CQS 32 player as well; 64p CQL can be a bit chaotic at times indeed. Teheran Highway was overall pretty meh, but it still is a fairly good map and there can be really cool firefights over the highway, but I agree, to me it's also the weakest map of BF3."

battlefront,335q8v,JoeyKuel,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:35:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed, after all it is a reboot, not battlefront 3. If what they're focusing on works and it turns out to be a solid game, then I'm happy with it."
battlefront,335q8v,WizenedCracker,-5,Thu Jun 18 02:43:40 2015 UTC,"GUYS THE GAME HAS BARELY BEEN FUCKING ANNOUNCED. We've been waiting for this game for years, and most of us believed that this game wasn't going to happen. Someone decides to actually start working on it and all we do is give them shit?  With a community like this, I don't think we deserve another Battlefront. SMH, if you guys are mourning this series now, after getting some hope, what the hell have you been doing the past decade of not getting literally anything."
battlefront,335q8v,African_Space_Jesuit,40,Sun Apr 19 23:07:01 2015 UTC,"It's been knowledge for a year. And what is this deserving shit? They're profiting off this, majorly, it's not a gift. You know why the community is sour? Because the last games have had 20 some maps, space dogfights and didn't have DLC announced along with the first trailer."
battlefront,335q8v,Proxystarkilla,-10,Mon Apr 20 00:16:50 2015 UTC,"Pack it in boys, the game's not exactly what the Battlefront veterans want, may as well can the whole project.  In all seriousness, the maps from Battlefront 2 to what will likely be in Battlefront, there's bound to be HUGE differences. Size, geometry, etc. More doesn't always mean better."
battlefront,335q8v,IlyichValken,24,Mon Apr 20 01:53:12 2015 UTC,"Dude, lower the player count and map size, whatever.  No AI in multiplayer? Weird, but I guess that's fine, some battlefront is better than none.  No Space Battles? Well, that makes me upset, but I liked Battlefront 1 a lot without space battles, so I can deal  Also no campaign? Galactic conquest is kinda a campaign I guess, so that's fine.  And no galactic conquest? Oh  And its $60  And there is already a load of DLC announced.   Fuck man. I know its early, but how can you already fuck up this bad. One of the other version of the game had space battles mixed with land battles for gods sake! wtf dice."
battlefront,335q8v,Doesnt_Draw_Anything,-2,Mon Apr 20 14:09:43 2015 UTC,"""How can you fuck up this bad""  Easy, you need a shit ton of money to develop a title of this sheer size, and the investors want to see a huge return on investment, so in turn, they force DLC to fluff those profits.   Is everybody new to the videogame industry? Or are we still surprised like it's 2009?"
battlefront,335q8v,Skatinbrad,-10,Mon Apr 20 21:01:22 2015 UTC,"The ""campaign"" in the old games are hardly even that. It's just instant action scenarios framed with narration and small cutscenes. Also don't see how anything like Galactic Conquest would fit in with how they seem to want the game.  It would be the equivalent to playing commander on a tablet if anything.  And I don't see how the Jakku DLC is a ""ton of DLC"" already?  Its probably 2-4 maps, for free, and is only getting released post-release because it's dealing with a movie that won't be out at game's release. As for any other content, that's all stuff started between the time the art team can't do anything else on the main game, and when it releases."
battlefront,335q8v,IlyichValken,9,Mon Apr 20 14:40:34 2015 UTC,I can tell you why they don't have Galactic conquest. Its because they barley have any maps.
battlefront,335q8v,Doesnt_Draw_Anything,0,Mon Apr 20 14:44:47 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, they've only got four planets before Jakku is released. That's at least 2-3 large maps per world.  It's a bit easy to claim ""so much content! 20 maps!"" When half or more of those maps all use the same assets from the previous game."
battlefront,335q8v,IlyichValken,3,Mon Apr 20 15:01:52 2015 UTC,"You can give reasons for why it had them, but at the end of the day, it had them."
battlefront,335q8v,Doesnt_Draw_Anything,-1,Mon Apr 20 15:19:56 2015 UTC,"And this one has big maps that will be noticeably different, and likely far better than the 20+."
battlefront,335q8v,IlyichValken,0,Mon Apr 20 15:27:26 2015 UTC,Will they now? Damn kid.
battlefront,335q8v,Doesnt_Draw_Anything,0,Mon Apr 20 15:31:29 2015 UTC,How? I don't see what there really is to improve.

battlefront,335q8v,reddituser00000,7,Tue Apr 21 03:24:46 2015 UTC,"No but there is a limit. 10 maps is a good size, yes, that's what Battlefield 4 has. The problem is a lack of variety. And you can't compare nitpicking  over stupid crap that's different to being angry over no space maps, no campaign and no galactic conquest. This is a 60 dollar multiplayer only game in a series that fully supported singleplayer and even had a game mode for it/also multiplayer whatever."
battlefront,335q8v,Proxystarkilla,-2,Mon Apr 20 03:05:55 2015 UTC,"How do you know there will be a lack of variety, in terms of the maps? Did you see them all yet?  And people have to learn that the new Battlefront is not part of the Battlefront-Series. It's not Battlefront 3, it's a fucking reboot. It's a new series, it only shares the name."
battlefront,335q8v,Hunter1207,5,Mon Apr 20 07:56:16 2015 UTC,"Maps from only 4 different environments. And no, it's not B3, but it's Ben ten years and two console generations since Battlefront 2, you'd think they would put some more effort into selling this game."
battlefront,335q8v,Proxystarkilla,0,Mon Apr 20 10:47:44 2015 UTC,"We don't know what ""environments"" entitles, you can argue games like Grand Theft Auto only have few different environments, it's how the developers carry out that area. For instance, just because we'll play on Endor doesn't mean we have four maps that are strictly set in a jungle setting.  Environments should be looked at more like ""themes""."
battlefront,335q8v,Skatinbrad,3,Mon Apr 20 21:03:38 2015 UTC,"Sand desert, sand town and that's it for Jakku unless there's an indoors space station thing and then that doesn't really have to do with Jakku. Snowy desert, snowy town or base or mix of these. I don't anticipate the equivalent of Battlefield 4 having 12 maps that are all redesigns of Golmund Railway, but closer to the equivalent of 3 or so maps in open fields, 3 or so in the city and 3 or so on islands, but for planets rather than locales. There's a lot they can do, yes, and your idea is actually a very good one. Probably they'll just be set in these planets, not all too similar, but I'm stuck with the distrust of EA that they've earned. You are probably right though."
battlefront,335q8v,Proxystarkilla,0,Mon Apr 20 22:56:40 2015 UTC,"They're game developers with experience, they know what they're doing. People see ""four environments"" and think we're getting tons of the same maps. This title is arguable the largest thing DICE is doing, it almost guarantees memorable maps and veteran designers.   How many different environments can there be, anyway? Sand, jungle, snow, city. What else can really provide variation? A water planet? A ""dead"" planet?"
battlefront,335q8v,Skatinbrad,3,Mon Apr 20 23:05:13 2015 UTC,"Mountains, ocean, space, dead planet, forest, snow, desert, city, space station, lava planet, beach/island, multi-level vertical city. Look at prior games, which did it right, and you'll see. There were 3 city type levels that really stuck out because they were all unique; Utapau, Coruscant and Alderaan. All cities, all unique."
battlefront,335q8v,Proxystarkilla,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:24:40 2015 UTC,Yeah. They know what they are doing. Makijg money off morons defending them no matter how hard they rip them off. It's like Stockholm syndrome.

battlefront,335q8v,FGHIK,-1,Wed Apr 22 19:19:49 2015 UTC,"They don't need to put more effort into it, they will make more than eough money anyway.  Maps from only 4 different environments were not confirmed, from 4 different planets.  For example on hoth alone, you could have: Big, open fields, vehicle centric siege combat a la assault on Echo base, maybe featuing small bits of inside the base like BF4's final stand maps or Inside a big icy cave, farely large inside areas with infantry centric attrition/tug of war combat or a map completely inside echo base, narrow corridors which essentially become deathtraps and a few moderately large rooms.  I'm not saying there will be map varietey, I'm just saying there could be - but as I said earlier, I too doubt there will be a lot of effort  put into this game, it's essentially just a money printing license."
battlefront,335q8v,Hunter1207,1 point,Mon Apr 20 11:16:07 2015 UTC,"Oh so it's a reboot, guess I shouldn't expect it to live up to a ten year old predecessor on a weaker console then."
battlefront,335q8v,FGHIK,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:19:18 2015 UTC,"But how do you know it won't live up? Did you see gameplay yet? Tell me then what you saw please. Because right now, we don't know shit about the game."
battlefront,335q8v,Hunter1207,1 point,Thu Apr 23 09:50:03 2015 UTC,They've already confirmed they've removed the majority of content.
battlefront,335q8v,FGHIK,-4,Thu Apr 23 20:41:58 2015 UTC,"Battlefront 2's campaign was little more than regular gameplay but with a few cutscenes and extra objectives from my understanding, Galactic Conquest doesn't seem like it would really fit with what DICE wants from the game - assuming it is what I'm thinking of, I barely played BF2.   They've said there would be 8 or more maps on launch, and I honestly don't see DICE making maps simply for one game mode.  Even Air Superiority used maps that were already made for the regular modes. It makes more sense to put the effort they'd have to put into making those maps, elsewhere, as even in BF4, AS is barely played.  Granted, more people might play a mode like that with the Battlefront fanbase coming in, but acting as if the game requires those three things despite it not being a reboot with a different developer just doesn't make sense.  Treat it like a reboot, not Battlefront 3. It is not, and likely will not be, what FRD was making."
battlefront,335q8v,IlyichValken,2,Mon Apr 20 03:18:08 2015 UTC,"Battlefront 2's campaign was little more than regular gameplay but with a few cutscenes and extra objectives from my understanding   Oh, so you've never actually played it? I'm tired of people dismissing BF2's campaign as ""instant action with narration"" because it had a ton of unique gameplay elements that were not available in any other mode in the game."
battlefront,335q8v,reddituser00000,0,Tue Apr 21 03:28:05 2015 UTC,"Except that's... pretty much what it was. It was instant action with cutscenes and narration. It gave the player certain objectives and a limited amount of friendly reinforcements. And, y'know, you follows the 501st.  Still pretty much instant action with cutscenes."
battlefront,335q8v,IlyichValken,3,Tue Apr 21 03:47:37 2015 UTC,"It also had unique gameplay elements and scenarios like cross-era battles, as well as creatures, objectives, and settings that were not available in multiplayer, galactic conquest, or instant action, but you know, just keep saying that it was ""just instant action with objectives."" Yes, it used instant action maps (although some maps had variations that were not available in instant action, like Hoth's back hangar being opened up, and more robust space battles), and it had objectives (a lot of which were not available in instant action, galactic conquest, or other modes), but that doesn't mean that it was a bad campaign. It seems like a lot of people either didn't play through it or forgot, but it had a pretty big amount of variation."
battlefront,335q8v,reddituser00000,0,Tue Apr 21 03:55:40 2015 UTC,"but that doesn't mean that it was a bad campaign.   I never said it was bad, but having creatures or special objectives, or having small variations on the map doesn't largely change something into something completely new.  It's still largely instant action with different objectives and a narrative.  Adding an m203 grenade launcher, an FLIR scope, suppressor and a laser sight to an M4 doesn't make it a new gun, it's still a goddamn M4."
battlefront,335q8v,IlyichValken,1 point,Tue Apr 21 04:02:10 2015 UTC,"Well you're making it sounds like no campaign is not a big deal because the previous one was just some barebones, no-effort thing, when the opposite is true."

battlefront,335q8v,FGHIK,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:22:41 2015 UTC,It's a reboot - you shouldn't be expecting anything.
battlefront,335q8v,IlyichValken,0,Thu Apr 23 01:26:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because you know, it's so much to ask that they match a ten year old ps2 game with their bajillion dollars. They could have more maps AND better quality if they wanted to, but we're getting less maps that will probably be worse."
battlefront,335q8v,FGHIK,-7,Wed Apr 22 19:15:55 2015 UTC,"Profiting off of it? No shit, it's a videogame. Arguably one of the most anticipated of the year.

I know they make money off it, I was not debating that. They're not saying nothing about the space battles, they're telling us specifically that they aren't there. It's been unveiled for a year. And look how I can make my point without being rude."

There's a lot more left to be seen, a lot of rumors to be addressed, and a lot of new features to be named. I don't think it's very fair to completely shit on this game before we've even seen real gameplay. The original Battlefront didn't have space battles or even playable hero characters and it was still incredibly fun. This may not be the game everyone had in mind, I don't think this level of negativity towards it is warranted."

battlefront,336dmq,payne6,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:38:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry buddy, but you're right to a degree. But how can't you be?  When developing a title at the sheer size of this one, it's no surprise you need a hefty fund and budget to afford developing and maintaining the game, that doesn't include a slew of other costs (marketing, further development, etc).   When an investor (or investors) throws you millions upon millions, they're not going to be keen to saying ""do whatever the fuck you want with it"". Of course, artistic freedom is there, but it'll more likely go down like this:  If you give someone $15 million, you want that money back. If you have a brain, you want more money back. I understand the game will profit, but you want more money back and that's your rule. You might ensure this by contractually forcing DLC and additional content to really milk that cow.  The investors want the return on investment. They want the best possible one.  The developers want to make the best possible game, with freedoms and exciting content.  This is how the industry works now. One wants money for development, one wants to flip that money to see the highest profit available.  Most of you probably know this. It's how the industry works now. Before game develop costed a FRACTION of what it does now. It's a billion dollar industry, so the almighty dollar is what it's about now.  It's likely it won't be a long time until we see a shift in the industry. It likely won't be until an independent title blindsides us, or devs find an investor who actually plays videogames and cares about the content. But that's it. Stop acting surprised or angry, it's not 2009 anymore. This platform is here to stay, so long as games rake in Blockbuster movie $$$$$$."
battlefront,336dmq,jakerfv,21,Mon Apr 20 21:08:54 2015 UTC,Seriously its 7 months until it reaches its launch day we have no idea if its going to be pushed back or what else will be added or removed. Everyone just fucking chill. The only news I am disapointed with is the whole 8+ maps thing but I am holding out since 7 months is a decent enough time frame to change things/add things. Too many people are jumping on the DAE hate EA? Meme. Its so fucking annoying if I was Dice I would cancel the whole thing. 2 years ago we were begging for a Battlefront game and now we finally have one and people have done nothing but bitch and moan.
battlefront,336dmq,JoeyKuel,3,Mon Apr 20 00:31:40 2015 UTC,"2 years ago we wanted a battlefront game, a good battlefront game.

If they add cool new features its a possibility, im just more worried of being sold 75% of a game (at probably 70$ which is the new AAA game price range) and then be sold the other 25% in the form of DLC (i.e space battles, conquest). I mean if were paying 70$ for the base game, that base game better being fucking amazing and currently it seems to be falling short."

Third person (Both games, though I honestly preferred first in both)  Heroes (though I honestly preferred BF1's version where you couldn't play them)   Heh.  Name a Star Wars game where you don't play as a Jedi or a similar hero?  And The Dark Forces series has first/third person swapping.   Vehicles, on rails or otherwise (remember that time you did an epic flanking maneuver in your off rails AT-AT? Yeah, neither does anyone else)   This is along the same lines as ""it's Star Wars"".  It's literally so fundamental if it wasn't in the game how many people do you think would buy it?   Star Wars (let's be honest, it's this that makes battlefront battlefront, not galactic conquest [which was just instant action with :plot:], not space battles [which wasn't even in BF1] and not the clone wars [most fans prefer the original trilogy anyway])   So you know everybody now?  Seriously, it's the lack of options that is killing this game, it having Star Wars in it doesn't make it Battlefront.   Different species (Pretty restricted in BF1, slightly less so in 2 because Bothans, not at all in 3 fucking finally)   This is a feature of the old Battlefronts?   Different planets (Yeah, we don't have every planet in the galaxy, but what were you seriously expecting? There isn't a single developer out there that would've done any better with the same amount of development time)   Four. All original trilogy, three of which we have played on multiple times before.  So exciting.  But please, go on telling yourself this is a Battlefront game in more than name only.  I'll give you that it has some features, but the features it does have doesn't make up for the ones it lacks, and makes me question why the fuck they bothered to dust off the franchise if they are going to fuck it over so bad."

And The Dark Forces series has first/third person swapping.   Since you mentioned it, Dark Forces. Yeah, Kyle Katarn becomes a Jedi, but he isn't until later on, and he certainly isn't an iconic hero. Also Galactic Battlegrounds and Star Wars: Galaxies. You could be a Jedi in Galaxies, but it was not easy, and in Battlegrounds Jedi and Sith are hardly the powerful wrecking balls they are in 2.   This is along the same lines as ""it's Star Wars"". It's literally so fundamental if it wasn't in the game how many people do you think would buy it?   Which is pretty much my point. You asked about aspects of Battlefront that were still present. Not to be tautological, but the fundamental aspects seemed rather...fundamental.   So you know everybody now? Seriously, it's the lack of options that is killing this game, it having Star Wars in it doesn't make it Battlefront.   Lack of options? Like being restricted to five or six classes? Or being unable to choose your race? And killing the game? Talking about counting your dead chickens before they've hatched. The only way this game won't turn a profit is if they cancel it. I can pretty much guarantee that at this point.   This is a feature of the old Battlefronts?   Ah, so you don't remember playing as a wookie or a bothan, or fighting with/against gungans, ewoks, tuskens and geonosians?   Four.

That's, like, your opinion man, and there's obviously nothing I'll be able to do to change it. Luckily for people like you, Battlefront 2 is still a thing for people like you who would rather the game not be made than have any attempt at all made at resurrecting the franchise you've been pining over for a decade."
battlefront,336dmq,lordluigi,1 point,Mon Apr 20 05:38:43 2015 UTC,"You say space wasn't a part of battlefront 1 as an excuse to it not being included, then say ""seamless air to ground combat"" is a feature of the original games, and I'm the pot calling the kettle black?   I honestly don't even understand what you're trying to say here. You're asking for features that are in, and I'm providing them. All you're doing is providing an example of a feature that wasn't present in a later game, which ironically is exactly what you're complaining about here.   This is an RTS, you don't ""play"" as anyone.   Shocking as it may seem, in most online FPS's you don't ""play"" as anyone in particular either. BF1 was no different.   I'd rather spawn in with a sniper rifle than have to race to pick it up before some other person does. I'd also rather have classes so you can quickly identify who has what weapon and prioritize who to shoot a lot quicker   You could just, you know, look at the person and see what weapon they're holding.    Skins aren't gameplay related so who cares. It is an option but it isn't necessary at all and doesn't change how the game plays, unlike, say, the Clone Wars would.   The only thing from the Clone Wars that really changes gameplay are droidekas and magna guards (jet troopers are essentially still present in a different form and it's entirely possible that the chaingun of the commanders will be a weapon) and I honestly didn't find that they really changed the way in which any of the maps were fought.   That's the entire point. Why use the franchise if you are not going to use the features of the franchise.    I'm still not clear on what key franchise features are really missing here. Maybe I'm just blind, but so far the only thing that can even remotely be considered a franchise feature that's missing is galactic conquest, which is really just instant action on a map with bonuses.  I'll grant that it was fun, but I don't think it defined the series."
battlefront,336dmq,JamesVirtus,2,Mon Apr 20 06:07:29 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't even understand what you're trying to say here.

Shocking as it may seem, in most online FPS's you don't ""play"" as anyone in particular either. BF1 was no different.   Yeah you do.  Just because you don't have a name doesn't mean you aren't playing as someone with a direct role in the game.   You could just, you know, look at the person and see what weapon they're holding.   Hahaha, is that a joke?  That would take forever in the world of shooters.   I'm still not clear on what key franchise features are really missing here.

No, I really don't. The first game tends to define the franchise, for obvious reasons, and EA seems to be taking their cue from it as well.   Yeah you do. Just because you don't have a name doesn't mean you aren't playing as someone with a direct role in the game.   Thing is, you're basically the equivalent of a single nameless infantry unit. You aren't a Jedi. You aren't even on the level of Kyle Katarn. Your individual actions are highly unlikely to turn the tide of the battle, let alone the conflict.   Hahaha, is that a joke? That would take forever in the world of shooters.   Not really, especially in a game that conviently has laser weapons.   Freedom of choice   It's not a sandbox game. Your freedom of choice is inherently limited regardless of how many maps there are. Additionally, if that's what you really care about, you'd actually be happy about the removal of classes.   I'm done arguing with someone that think this'll be a Battlefront game though, we'll never see eye to eye.   Thankfully it doesn't really matter what I think. It's happening. So while we'll certainly never see eye to eye, in the end it doesn't really matter because the game's going to be released regardless of what is said here."

A dice dev confirmed on Twitter. My whole point in posting this is that we only know what old features it doesn't have. We dont know what new features it does have. New features might not be as good as the old or they might be better. Don't write the game off yet. Wait and see what may the 4th and e3 brings.  Im on mobile otherwise I'd link the tweet and sorry for typos.

battlefront,336dmq,Still_Alive_2,-3,Mon Apr 20 07:14:29 2015 UTC,"The whole ""It's called battlefront, so it should have those same features"" is bullshit and has been used forever on many different occasions. In the end the devs decide what the game is going to be, and be called. And it's got more in common with battlefront 1 and 2 than it doesn't. I honestly can't think of another large scale shooter with star wars as the theme, please point me in that direction otherwise everyone and their grandmother would still be comparing it to battlefront 2 no matter what it was called. Now if they released an American civil war stealth/espionage game and called it battlefront, I'd agree with you.  Hell there are tons of games where supposedly key features were stripped or changed. The biggest one I can think of is Call of Duty, went from being a WW2 shooter, among many, to a modern shooter, did pretty well from what I hear. Another is Halo: Reach. Dear god they took out master chief. Another was TF2. What, the game is all cartoony now, fuck this, i'm going to fortress forever. Starcraft 2, what, the campaign is only terrans and the expansions are going to be the other races? BLATANT MONEY GRAB BY BLIZZARD. There are a slew of other examples. Each with the exact same argument, ""It's not the same as what I had, there aren't as many options"" You don't even know what all of your options are, only what they aren't.   But by all means, don't buy the game, Don't preorder it, tell everyone not to especially to not preorder it."

battlefront,336dmq,artycharred,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:29:51 2015 UTC,"From what I understand about the way split screen works It's because they can't do it in online. The way it works (and this is pretty rough because I don't completely understand it) Is that the console has to render the game twice, apparently they got it working well enough offline, where the console only has to communicate with itself once, but online where it has to communicate with the server and up to 38 other players is too much for it and hinders gameplay enough to where they don't want to put it in."

battlefront,334ik1,Swamp85,9,Sun Apr 19 15:58:20 2015 UTC,Battlefront 1 and 2 reused loads of assets. Battlefront 2 came out a year after 1 - there's no way you can make that many maps without reusing assets.

battlefront,334ik1,IHateHumans,2,Sun Apr 19 16:47:08 2015 UTC,"You know, there was a Star Wars mod released a while back for COD4. They should have made this game like that. Make it a whole new Star Wars game that (like the original Battlefront took inspiration from Battlefield) could take from modern shooters like Call of Duty. Imagine a whole list of killstreaks Star Wars style. Imagine getting to chose Star Wars themed perks. Imagine being able to customize your weapons with new attachments and paint jobs. Maybe you could even customize your character with different skins or maybe even choose different races.  They could call it Star Wars: Galactic Warfare.  I would have been way more excited for that than this Faux-Front."
battlefront,334ik1,Hungry_Lion,3,Sun Apr 19 16:52:43 2015 UTC,"Oh come on. Different planets doesn't mean different enviroments. Kashykk and Endor for example are the same thing. Courscant, Bespin, and Kamino are all using those same sleek city assets. Rhen Var and Hoth are both snow, just with different buildings. Tattooine and Geonosis, both deserts. Ya'll are just simmering in the nostalgia. In actuality the map design was quite bland compared to what we have now.   You can have the same kind of diversity on a single planet. Just look at the Earth."
battlefront,334ik1,IHateHumans,0,Sun Apr 19 17:11:53 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. If I showed you a picture of some random Earth city and told you to name it, unless it was an iconic city skyline, chances are you'd have no idea. Earth is only diverse in it's ecosystems. And Earth isn't in the Star Wars Galaxy, is it? So it has no bearing on the discussion at hand.   And all those planets you tried to claim are the same are barely similar. This is Coruscant, this is Bespin, and this is Kamino. Sure, they have similar architecture, but the surrounding planet is entirely different.  And it doesn't matter if two planets have a similar ecosystem. The point of the different planets was to give players new battlegrounds on different worlds with new indigenous lifeforms, vehicles, and heroes. In SWBF2, I could go from fighting Rebels on Endor, to killing CIS on Geonosis, to having a battle royale of heroes on Mos Eisley, to duking it out with the Clones on Kashyyyk. There was variety. This NuFront isn't going to have that variety. It's going to be Rebels vs Empire all the time and on the same 4 planets. No difference, no variation.  And it's not ""simmering in nostalgia"". It's wanting a proper, new entry into a game series we love."

That's the only explanation for thinking that you can develop a modern video game that's up to standards in terms of map detail and scale and create enough assets for twenty different planets. Again, look at the maps in the old game. They're bland, and would have been much easier to construct."

battlefront,334ik1,femo1170,45,Sun Apr 19 21:03:18 2015 UTC,"My ideal Star Wars Battlefront would be as follows:  96 Players - Yes, ninety-six, forty-eight for each team. Moves us past the usual self-imposed cap of sixty-four, allows for large scale battles without going in a different direction with the game like M.A.G. (Which I loved)  Campaigns from Episode I - Episode VI. Yes, everything from the Battle of Naboo to the Battle of Endor. You have your primary maps from the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War along with battles that came pre and post Clone Wars and pre Galactic Civil War. The Battle of Jakku DLC remains the same to add post ROTJ content.  A good supply of maps: To start out there is no reason the majority of all the following planets/places did not have maps: Tantive IV, Tatooine, Death Star, Yavin IV, Hoth, Cloud City, Endor, Naboo, Coruscant, Kamino, Alderaan, Geonosis, Utapau, Mygeeto, Felucia, Lothal, The Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Mandalore, Ryloth, Saleucami, Umbara, Christophsis, Cato Neomoidia,  Florrum, Kiros, Oba Diah, Onderon, Toydaria, Rodia, Ringo Vinda, Fort Anaxes, Orto Plutonia, Dantooine, Sullust. Yes this is a lot, but like I said, only a majority need to be in the game at launch. Some places would get multiple maps (Geonosis for example would have two, one for the Battle of Geonosis seen in Episode II and another for the battle seen the Clone Wars episode Landing at Point Rain. The rest (Along with a host of new locals) should be released via expansions (I hate ""DLC"", I'm old school, I know).  Space Battles: For the various locals mentioned above, space battles need to be present for the engagements that a space battle element plus a few others. I was never big on the idea of going from space to land as a lot of people were due to their proposed inclusion in BFIII, but if there are maps were they could pull it off seamless, why not? With ninety-six players there are a plethora of starfighter and starship gun positions to fill, as well as room for ship raids.  Weapons, Vehicles and Gear: Usually something that doesn't get messed up in Star Wars games, no matter what game. I'd expect that to stay the course.  Post ROTJ: We already have the Battle of Jakku DLC, which is fine, however there definitely needs to be more post ROTJ content down the line.  Player Servers: Allow players to host their own servers. Simple  Community Support: Especially for the PC Crowd, for the love of all that is holy, release an SDK with modding tools so players can mod the game and make levels. Custom maps and modded games are a great part of any game, I don't want to hear how it cuts into your profit margin potentially. Some of the best games we have right now exist solely because of the credit of mod teams and their work/ideas.  Campaign Mode: Because face it, sometimes you just want to play the game with yourself, and we all know that Xbox Live, PSN, and your internet connection in general are going to fail, so you have to get your fix in somehow.  -EDIT-  Forget to mention  Characters: Various Characters from the Original Trilogy, Prequel Trilogy, The Clone Wars Series and Rebels Series. We all know who we want to see.  Classes and Subclasses: Straight forward, have base classes along with subclasses. One example would be to have an Engineer Class and a Slicer subclass, wherein the slicer can hack enemy turrets, vehicles, shields, etc."

Florrum: Serves literally no purpose, especially since we already have Tatooine and the new desert planet from TFA's trailer.  Kiros: Togruta art colony. Totally a good military target.  Qba Diah: Spice dealer planet in the outer rim. No strategic value. Pass.

Toydaria: a planet known for being a mudball. Need I say more?

A prime spot for the Rebellion to strike.  Ryloth: A source of free labor for the Empire in the Outer Rim. The Rebellion would be wise to free Ryloth from Imperial subjugation. There also was a major Clone Wars battle on this planet.  Umbara: Major Clone Wars battle on this planet. If still in Imperial hands by the time of the Galactic Civil War, more than likely a planet that is the source of continual tech advancement due to R&D efforts.  Christophsis: Major Clone Wars battle on this planet.  Cato Neomoidia: Homeworld of the Trade Federation, major Clone Wars battle on this planet.  Florrum: Home of Hondo's priate base. Can either be used for a Clone Wars era battle or Galactic Civil War era battle should the Rebels for example use his old base for one of their own.  Kiros: Planet that was raided by the Separatist hunting for slaves during the Clone Wars.  Oba Diah: Location of the Pyke Syndicate. Could either serve as a location for a Clone Wars era battle or Galactic Civil War wherein the Rebels repurpose the remains the Pyke Syndicate's Base.  Onderon: Location of a major Clone Wars battle. If this spark of rebellion continues amongst the citizens of Onderon then definitely can play into the Galactic Civil War.  Toydaria: Location of major Clone Wars battle, also long some important hyperspace lane since the Republic used it to funnel supplies to forces in various theaters of operation  Rodia: Location of Clone Wars battle and later in the hands of the Empire. Can serve as a battleground for either wars.  Ringo Vinda: Location of a major Clone Wars battle.  Fort Anaxes: A base in an asteroid field, so there must be some importance for it to be there. Could serve as a listening outpost, communications outpost or a plethora of other possibilities. Can also tie into the Galactic Civil War.  Orto Plutonia: Location of major Clone Wars battle.  Not all the other planets you listed (Save Kuat and Ilum) were already mentioned. These locations are all mentioned for their visual dynamic based off what we've seen, plus the idea of planets we haven't seen (In canon) but know about (Dantooine, Taris, Murkhana, etc. for example)."
battlefront,334ik1,I_give_karma_to_men,-5,Sun Apr 19 21:58:15 2015 UTC,"In order again:  Lothal: Outer Rim Everything about this makes any large scale battle unlikely. There are plenty of better targets that would result in an actual pitched engagement.  Ryloth: See above  Umbara: Low population, still a terrible choice compared to other planets, especially since you can't see shit there.  Christophsis: ""Battles took place here"" could apply to the whole fucking galaxy. If that's your only reason try harder please.  Florrum: Pirate base isn't really ""large scale battle"" material, nor does it provide much tactical utility. Still not seeing what makes this planet remotely interesting compared to other choices.  Kiros: See Christophsis  Oba Diah: See Florrum  Onderon: See Christophsis  Toydaria: See Christophsis  Rodia: See Christophsis  Ringo Vinda: Seriously though, every planet has had a battle at some point.  Fort Anaxes: It's ancient ruin by the time of Clone Wars era. No strategic importance.   Orto Plutonia: See Christophsis  By and large, these planets offer no visual dynamic that really sets them apart from previous installations. So far your criteria seems to be ""Hey, these are planets that appeared in television series and thus should be included for no particular reason beside that."""
battlefront,334ik1,WOX_69,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:08:16 2015 UTC,"Let's go one more time, shall we?:  Lothal: Being in the Outer Rim doesn't make a battle or not make a battle major, the events the precede the battle, the battle itself and the aftermath do. Also, as noted there is an Imperial Academy and TIE manufacturing factory here. The Rebels, whose base is in the Outer Rim, would do well to cripple Imperial TIE manufacturing in this region.  Ryloth: See above, at least the first part.  Umbara: A night map would be a nice change of pace. Also, something that can be built upon after the monumental base they establish in the Clone Wars.  Christophsis: Sure, but these are locations we actually SAW, many of battles take place on, tell me you aren't this dense.  Florrum: ""Large Scale Battle"" again, is predicated on what goes on before, during and after the battle, not where it is. If the Rebels start using Hondo's old base as a place of operations that's been disrupting their operations majorly in the area then yes, a battle there would be a major battle.   Kiros/Oba Diah/Onderon/Toydaria/Rodia: See above for wherever you feel they apply.  Ringo Vinda: Not every planet, but that said, it provides a different dynamic, completely indoors  Fort Anaxes: Correction, it's in ruins by the Rebels era, it was active during the Clone Wars. Also, we don't know WHY said base established, so you can't say it serves no strategic purpose.  These locations offer great visual diversity, along with giving the player an opportunity to participate in battles they've seen previously. You hating on them doesn't change that."
battlefront,334ik1,Hungry_Lion,0,Sun Apr 19 22:40:42 2015 UTC,"Lothal: Being in the outer rim does actually determine battle size, simply because the core of Imperial influence is literally centered around the galactic core. The presence of a military academy doesn't really influence much, and as previously stated there are much better targets if that's your reason.  Ryloth: See above seems to be a theme with this, so from now on I'll exclude planets that use this and leave it to the main points of contention.  Umbara: A valid point, but night battles can be done anywhere (Coruscant and I believe Rhen Var were examples of this in BF2. Theed too, now that I think of it).  Christophsis: There are still plenty of better locations from movie, EU, and other video game material that we have also SEEN that would be better choices. Is it really dense of me to be more inclusive than simply ""It appeared on TV""?  Florrum: Basing things on events preceding a battle is all well and good when you have a genre in which you can set that background info up. Being a mainly multiplayer game, Battlefront has never been that genre. To be used as a battlefield, there really has to be an easily understandable reason for why it was included over, say, Kashyyyk or Naboo.  To be clear, I'm not hating on them. Were this an RPG of some sort, I'd totally be up for exploring the galaxy. However this is a lore-based FPS, and if we're going to be selecting battlefields for a limited pool, I personally want some sensible criteria for their inclusion."
battlefront,334ik1,agustin-barris,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:39:44 2015 UTC,"Lothal: Again, just because it's in the Outer Rim does not determine the enormity of battle. The Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Endor were in the Outer Rim, does that mean they weren't major battles? Yes the core of the Empire's influence and support is in the Core but again, that does mean big battles are any less prone to happen there. Also the presence of an Imperial Academy there is huge, that means they're funneling new recruits in the region through there so it must serve some importance. Also, you forget to mention that there's a TIE manufacturing plant there.  Ryloth: Same, but let's continue.  Umbara: Coruscant and Naboo Theed maps were more focused on the urban background of the battle as opposed to the night feeling. On Umbara the darkness plays directly into battle.  Christophsis: People want to experience locales they've seen, especially if there's been a battle fought on them, that's why people fawn over fighting on Hoth, Endor, Tatooine, etc. Christophsis is a unique location visually and provides us a battle to participate as well.  Florrum: I never said to include it OVER Kashyyyk or Naboo, I want them included WITH said planets. Battlefront 1 and 2 also provided background context on multiple battles.  This isn't so much for exploration, it's for diversity and breadth. People will never get tired of playing the classics of Hoth and Endor, but you also have to include new places for people to experience as well."
battlefront,334ik1,WOX_69,2,Mon Apr 20 04:55:02 2015 UTC,Not to mention the ridiculous notion that they could actually fit thirty large-scale quality maps in a single development cycle. People don't actually believe that do they? Even games with smaller maps like COD have always maxed out at 12 sometimes (rarely) 15.

battlefront,334ik1,UnlikelySoccerStar,2,Mon Apr 20 10:48:38 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity what did you dislike about the clone wars cartoon?  I personally thought it was the single most worthwhile thing to come out of the prequel timeline.  Certain arcs like ""Darkness on Umbara"" and Darth Maul's takeover of Mandalore stand among the best things in the whole franchise in my opinion."
battlefront,334ik1,I_give_karma_to_men,-1,Mon Apr 20 15:42:32 2015 UTC,"The relationship between Anakin and Ahsoka is awkward and annoying as hell from the outset. Ahsoka does get better as a character, but her introduction was an immediate turn off to a portion of the fanbase.   After that, there's the fact that the series completely butchers previously developed Mandalorian culture. This is less of an issue now that the EU's been declared non-canon, but at the time it was a huge ""fuck you"" to the EU fanbase.   Lastly, the entire Darth Maul arc is nonsensical, as we're somehow expected to believe that he survived being cut in half and falling down a seemingly bottomless pit.   Don't get me wrong, I'm sure it's great for the kids, but as an adult it was just cringe worthy as hell and had a blatant disregard for preestablished material in a time before the new canon changes were established."
battlefront,334ik1,WOX_69,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:30:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with the points on ahsoka and the mandalorians.  I didn't care enough about the ahsoka/Anakin dynamic to let it affect me too much, but the approach to mandalorian culture would've had me rooting for the deathwatch if Pre Viszla hadn't been such an asshole.   As for the Darth Maul arc, I agree it's stupid that they brought him back, but they at least did interesting things with his return.  It may have been a fanfiction level plot twist, but several of the best moments in the whole series involved Maul.  I would put the duel between Maul/Savage and Darth Sidious alongside anything in the whole Star Wars universe."
battlefront,334ik1,My-Little-Throw-Away,-1,Mon Apr 20 18:16:32 2015 UTC,"They did. Honestly, by the end the series was starting to redeem itself, and I am finding Rebels to be moderately decent in comparison (although Ezra can be pretty annoying himself at times)."

battlefront,334ik1,femo1170,5,Sun Apr 19 19:00:39 2015 UTC,"Yes this is a good point. Though at the same time it could be a reason why we're mourning for the series.  ""Back in my day games came sold complete. What you saw on the box was what you got. There were no fancy premium schemes or micro transactions. And if you were really lucky an expansion pack would come out that added a whole heap of new content!""   Nostalgia glasses are off now. But after dealing with this crap through BF3, BF4, BF Hardline. Is it so much to ask for, to get a full game on release and not have to be turned upside down and have my pockets emptied to ""experience the most"" of a game I've waited 10 years for?"

It was fairly comparable to releasing some map packs and some new weapons. That absolutely would be dlc if Battlefront 1 were released today. It wasn't because digital distribution wasn't popular yet."
battlefront,334ik1,IHateHumans,4,Sun Apr 19 22:03:06 2015 UTC,And your game would finally be finished in 2019 with a $300 price tag. I wonder why you haven't been hired by a studio for these amazing concepts.

battlefront,334ik1,reddituser00000,9,Sun Apr 19 16:17:31 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that the AT-ATs are only on rails for the walker assault mode to prevent typical battlefield stuff (I.e. It being moved to a highly defensible position so the defending team can gang up and obliterate the attacking team).  That said if they're not usable in the normal game mode I'm gonna be pissed.

The game isn't battlefield, it isn't call of duty.  It felt just like Star Wars.  They'd nailed every sound, animation and blaster bolt and it's obvious they're pushing all resources to a strong core planetary game.  Darth Vader was nuts.  You could see him individually parry every shot sent at him with measured precision.  He wasn't just cycling through animations. The Endor map I saw was insanely detailed and layered, and the vehicles were menacing.  Every shot from the at-at was a terrifying explosion of sound and light.  Considering Galactic Conquest was less deep then most tablet games I wish they'd just take the day needed to code it in for all the nostalgia wanters.  As for the ClS/clones I can tell you they wouldn't be happy with some vehicle and skin swaps, so maybe they'll be down the line when they feel they have time to do a true prequel experience.

But who am i to judge  True, and with the force awakens coming up on the horizon, the newer fans may not like the features we had back in times of yore, although it would still be nice to be fighting or defending the death star but that's just me who liked the BF2 and renegade squad's space battles  Yeah, well things changed, both for the better or worse"
battlefront,334ik1,Skatinbrad,-6,Mon Apr 20 05:18:14 2015 UTC,"I expected it to be a Battlefront game, this is a Battlefield mod at best."

battlefront,334ik1,Skatinbrad,-3,Sun Apr 19 18:17:13 2015 UTC,"there's no galactic conquest, single player mode other than a few linear co-op missions, less maps, less planets, scripted AT-AT's... wanna continue on what it's missing from the first game too?"
battlefront,334ik1,louisbo12,2,Sun Apr 19 18:31:30 2015 UTC,"We don't know how many maps or game modes will be featured in the title. In fact, your basing your opinion on an unfinished detail of what content the game holds, we know only the basics."
battlefront,334ik1,RoyalHorse,-2,Sun Apr 19 18:53:39 2015 UTC,"We know that there is no campaign, no galactic conquest, this in itself removes the two main modes that Battlefront had. There are no space battles, if DICE didn't want these in because they're rebooting the first Battlefront then fair enough but it still limits the game to ground combat only with on planet dogfighting (Sounds a lot like Battlefield 4 doesn't it). There's a painfully small amount of locale which will result in a lack of longevity. What we're getting is a reskin of a modern FPS, it's not a Battlefront game other than in name, if this was called something different I doubt comparisons other than the fact that they're both Star Wars games could be made."
battlefront,334ik1,theporkroll,3,Sun Apr 19 19:00:49 2015 UTC,(Sounds a lot like Battlefield 4 doesn't it)   Sounds a lot like Battlefront 1.
battlefront,334ik1,RoyalHorse,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:01:32 2015 UTC,"And Battlefront 1 wasn't that great and isn't something to aspire to.  Honestly, I'm not expecting Battlefront 2, it'll be impossible to re-make what 9-year-old me got out of that game. But what I was expecting was something worth my money. As far as I know EA/DICE have come out and said ""No single-player story, no Galactic Conquest and no Space-Battles."" To me, this is not worth the usual $60-$70 retail price on Origin, and your mileage may vary.  This, to me anyway, is looking very much like Hardline did. An infantry focused Battlefield game, and while Hardline WAS a very playable game, it wasn't really different from Battlefield 4. Not different enough for the price of even just the ""standard"" version, currently $70, let alone adding the Battefield Hardline Premium (another $50) so you can pre-order the map packs.  But, like I said earlier, your mileage may vary. $70 might not be the price-point of the game, though I think it will be, and you may be able to justify the purchase like many others will be."

battlefront,334ik1,FirePhoenyx,7,Mon Apr 20 02:34:40 2015 UTC,"Upvoting to bring you back to zero, because you have a valid opinion (although I don't agree with you at all).  Yes, at least on Hoth there was very little variation where you could drive your AT-AT. I mean, it's pretty much just one big snowy field.  But rails? What if you want to angle yourself properly against some snowspeeders? Nah you're out of luck, rails. Want to front-face that Rebel Outpost? You can only half-assedly turn your head, cause rails. Want to rush that generator? You could, but you'd probably take a shitty path because rails. Strategic options for you, the player, decrease when rails are added.  Not to mention driving anything on rails just feels shitty."
battlefront,334ik1,Mandalore93,2,Mon Apr 20 05:49:29 2015 UTC,"But it's on rails during a gamemode where one team tries to destroy it.  It's a walking capture point, and rails allow the attacking team to set up ambushes and roadblocks instead of having the defending team retreat as far as possible.  To me that sounds far more interesting that plodding around a giant field for half an hour.  Regardless, I appreciate your response, I just wish some people here would wait until the game comes out so we can see how it actually plays vs comparing a dozen rumors with 10 years of imagining what the game will be like."

BF2 was great for space battles but at the same time it was really just another ground map when most of the fighting happens in the hangers. As for the AT-AT rail thing, I would rather have rails then trolls who step on teammates. I believe there are more than 8 maps though. Bring out the pitchforks but I think GC was a little overrated, Just more ground fights. Dont get me wrong BF2 was great, but at the same time it had its issues as well that people are forgetting about. I think Battlefront will be fun and enjoyable if your a SW fan.   edit: https://twitter.com/DICEfigge/status/589208417199214592 yes there are more than 8 maps."

I wouldn't have had a single issue if they called it ""Star Wars: Battlefield"", but they didn't, they called it Battlefront, which insinuates that it would inherit most of its properties from its predecessors, which this one doesn't other than its setting.   And why wouldn't there be a point to an updated Battlefront? Better graphics and tighter mechanics combined with proven near-perfect ideas that have survived years sounds great."

They're bringing it back, but in their own vision. They could have easily named it something else and just had a literal Star Wars themed Battlefield, and not made anything remotely close to Battlefront.

I mean bf and bf2 were a big part of not just mine but a good portion of my friends. We would crowd around the old television, boot up the ps2 and live the dream as clones in the clone wars, and feel like rebels everytime we defeated the empire. Now, from what has been said, with 20 vs 20 multiplayer, bots only on ""challenges"", lack of space battles, and only rebels vs. empire. I'm just not so sure anymore. I understand that the market has changed over time and maybe EA is worried that it won't sell as much with the old formula. But when or if I buy the new battlefront, I want it to be Star Wars Battlefront. Not Star Wars Battlefield.          I want to feel like a standard infantry soldier or bad ass jedi in the Star Wars universe, I know and love. Not some other twitchy shooter, in which I can get killed by a 12 year old with a bad headset.

battlefront,333qwl,ThrashReflex,2,Sun Apr 19 07:12:25 2015 UTC,"After reading your comment I remembered that EA loves their DLC... :( so it is possible that if what you say is true that if and when the game gets popular then they could add space, missions/campaign, and factions such as the Clones.  It would be sad if EA did such a thing but it does seem like a possibility."
battlefront,333qwl,Junoh315,2,Sun Apr 19 07:50:20 2015 UTC,I don't think that they'd add CIS but Republic skins for the Empire would make sense.  If they're giving you character customization and there are no classes then droidekas are as good as gone.  At least Battlefront 2 still runs on modern systems.
battlefront,333qwl,Powerfury,1 point,Sun Apr 19 10:31:18 2015 UTC,"There is a reason why there are only 2 races to play from at launch. They plan on releasing DLC content for Clones, Droids, and other races along with their new planets/maps.   It's EA, it's DICE, they've been pushing DLC for a long time now. They purposely removed MOD support so they can have supreme control over the content created for the game. If they had MOD support, fans and players would make MUCH better quality content for the player than EA/DICE could. DICE is taking the fast and easy way out. The community would actually work on the game that they refuse to make, or make everyone else pay 40 more dollars for the DLC."
battlefront,333qwl,Junoh315,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:28:13 2015 UTC,"They plan on releasing DLC content for Clones, Droids, and other races along with their new planets/maps.   Have they said this?  Are you sure it's not because they want two factions that play the same?"
battlefront,333qwl,Powerfury,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:36:39 2015 UTC,"Well, they might not actually release Clones and Droids, but I can guarantee you 100% that they will add in another race for DLC in the future because of their history.  We will see more definite answers at E3."
battlefront,333qwl,Junoh315,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:06:23 2015 UTC,I think they've already mentioned that they're going to have more than just humans.  The rebels will probably be able to pick their race.
battlefront,333qwl,IHateHumans,2,Mon Apr 20 03:45:23 2015 UTC,Of course that's what's gonna happen. They're holding back content to sell back as DLC at a latter date. I'll just do the smart thing and wait a year or two and pick up the game + all DLC for $60 or under.
battlefront,333qwl,xzenocrimzie,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:13:22 2015 UTC,The only reason they would wait to give out news that they know we will be disappointed in is a business decision only.

battlefront,333qwl,thisguywhowearspants,6,Mon Apr 20 00:39:55 2015 UTC,Don't buy it then. Gamers need to start voting with their wallets instead of merely buying things out of some misguided loyalty to a company or brand name.
battlefront,333qwl,Canada_Cat,4,Sun Apr 19 18:11:55 2015 UTC,That's what I intend to do. I don't want to waste my money on something that would disappoint 12 year old me
battlefront,333qwl,IHateHumans,0,Sun Apr 19 18:44:23 2015 UTC,"Here's the problem with that argument that most gamers don't consider: We are literally telling people to not spend their money.  Yes, we can affect how many people buy it but I cannot see a scenario where this game does not sell bucketloads on launch. This game has some serious hype behind it and it has been a while since we got a SW Battlefront game.  So I say make lemons out of lemonade and let somebody else be the sucker. That way if it turns out terrible you won't have to worry about spending your own money."
battlefront,333qwl,Canada_Cat,3,Sun Apr 19 23:45:53 2015 UTC,The problem with that logic is the people buying these games influence the state of the games industry. So the suckers are actively hurting the quality of future games due to their ignorance and impatience.
battlefront,333qwl,IHateHumans,2,Mon Apr 20 00:20:28 2015 UTC,"I know that and you know that.  But complaining on a subreddit where a lot of people share the exact same opinion is equally as damaging. Because you are not influencing the people that are behind these decisions in the first place: the marketers.  I'll leave you with this to brew on: People have been trying for the past year to stop people from buying these hype machines and failed every single time. Take ""The Order: 1886"" as an example. Yes we can influence the sales of games by rewarding the good ones by spreading the word but we can't prevent people from buying something they want to buy. It's simply an exercise in futility.  Let the ignorant ones get burned because at some point that's the best way to teach them. If they don't learn, that's their problem. You can't save everyone."

battlefront,333qwl,Zadder,4,Sun Apr 19 23:27:40 2015 UTC,"I don't want to get mine or anyone's hopes up, but I wonder if we might be jumping the gun in terms of content. It sucks that there's no clone war, even though, as they've stated the majority of the fans prefer the original trilogy it doesn't change the fact they were loads of fun to play. Despite this, It makes me wonder: We only learned about the Battle of Jakku after we had seen it in the Force Awakens trailer. What I'm holding out hope for is that we might see a lot of Force Awakens content, maybe even an era. If that was the case I don't think I would mind so much with the lack of Clone Wars, because as someone pointed out to me it might be more interesting to see some fresh locations and characters. Just my opinion, I'm not saying this will happen, but maybe what they lack in content that was in the first game they might make up for in new content."
battlefront,333qwl,payne6,3,Sun Apr 19 11:44:45 2015 UTC,This is EA we're talking about. Maybe Clone Wars content will be DLC?
battlefront,333qwl,artycharred,3,Sun Apr 19 15:54:43 2015 UTC,I would think maybe a expansion just like how Battlefield badcompany 2 had the Vietnam expansion and everyone seemed to like that. Everyone just needs to chill its far too early to predict failure or success.

battlefront,33662u,Giorgos78,5,Sun Apr 19 22:35:48 2015 UTC,"Well in BF2, the different faction helicopters had different characteristics.  Mec heli: had an awsome machigun that launched what could only be described as granades and it fucking rocked, that being said it was relatively more difficult to pilot.  Us heli: stable, fast, easily the best for manuvering and learning.  China: incredible rocket system and speed but low survivability.  They could try something similar but I doubt it.   Now the big heads on the rebel soldiers is a real problem, if they have bigger hitboxes it means easy headshot but if they have normal ones people will be complaining about missing shots that they shouldn't have missed. And the same could be said about storm troopers, that white knight (spot me now) armor is a true disadvantage."
battlefront,33662u,JamesVirtus,2,Mon Apr 20 03:20:11 2015 UTC,I also remember the U.S. F-35's being much more maneuverable than the Chinese Jets because the VTOL let it slow down more and make tighter turns.

When you try to tell those people that Dice decided to do this because 40 players made a more balanced gameplay experience, they don't believe you.   As long as I don't have to walk around for 5 min to find the enemy, I'm fine with 40 players if the map size/design makes it work."
battlefront,335abq,PunnyYolks,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:15:55 2015 UTC,"More players isn't always better, believe it or not... Counter-strike is amazing with 10. Even some of the larger Battlefield maps get too crazy with 64 players.  And Battlefront 2 with 64 players? Nothing but rocket and grenade spam. The maps were so poorly made with so many funnels that nothing ever happened.  I'm beginning to suspect that most people complaining about the new Battlefront never actually played the old ones online..."
battlefront,335abq,femo1170,0,Sun Apr 19 21:25:24 2015 UTC,"This isn't counter-strike, this is battlefront, A STAR WARS GAMES. Star wars games are about big battles. Limiting the game because LAZY cunts don't want to balance larger maps isn't an excuse. Hurr durr, rocket spam and grenade spam.  YEAH, I'll quote you here you retard: ""The maps were so poorly made"".  Hmm, wonder how you fix that...maybe making quality fucking maps and not worrying about stupid ass single player and co-op. Hur durp."
battlefront,335abq,shastaXII,0,Wed Apr 22 03:15:49 2015 UTC,"Please shut the fuck up. Them believing it was balanced better is a pitiful fucking excuse. Nobody wants to play a battlefront FUCKING game with fighting 20 other god damn people, even less for the rest of the modes.  They could of easily made maps to accommodate 64 players. You're living in a made up fantasy land if you believe they can't balance it. SW isn't about small little battles. When does anyone walk around for 5 min in any other BF fucking game, you delusional retard. I don't even walk for 5 minutes in Planetside 2 and that has hundreds."
battlefront,335abq,shastaXII,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:14:33 2015 UTC,"Jesus christ calm down, you sound like a YouTube commenter. The 5 minute talk was a reference to Battlefield 3 on the consoles, which had huge maps with very little players. Because of that, the game felt empty.  Don't even get me started on Battlefield 4 for the last gen consoles, those maps were made for 64 player combat, but the 360 and PS3 were only able to handle half as many. So yeah, you could walk around for a long time before finding an enemy.   I'm not saying I prefer 20v20. Rather, I'm just saying the player count doesn't matter to me so long as the game DOESN'T feel empty. I can understand them using 20vs20 on the PS4 and Xbone, because they're aiming for 60FPS and as close to 1080p as possible. They got 60FPS with battlefield Hardline, but they didn't get anywhere near 1080p (The Xbox One was running at an embarrassing 720p). So I assume they cut the player count to maximize the graphics and framerate on the CURRENT GENERATION CONSOLES.   Now, that being said it should not be 20vs20 on PC. That is just embarrassing for 2015. Unlike everyone else who is just Raging, I'm trying to be logical. This next part is the most important point. It seems as though EA and DICE have built this game for the current consoles first and then for the PC. EA is probably assuming that their sales on XBOX ONE and PS4 are going to be much higher than PC. They only have profit in mind.   So the game could be designed for 20 vs 20 if you logically think about it this way: they designed the maps and player count to work the best with consoles and gave a big ole' ""Fuck you"" to the PC gamers."

""Only 4 planets""   From what we know so far it seems that there are only 4 planets. I really hope there are more, but a DICE dev confirmed that each planet will have more than 2 maps each, and there'll be more than 8 maps at launch (hopefully not PR speak for '9', but you never know).  In terms of the rest, I agree. No space battles is a blow, but ultimately the first Battlefront did just fine without them. Pretty keen for some aerial combat on the surface though."
battlefront,330um0,aconnellan,17,Sat Apr 18 12:33:20 2015 UTC,"I don't understand where everyone's getting this ""only 4 planets"" thing.  They've only announced 4, that doesn't mean that there will only be 4 in the final game.  We're still 7 months away from release."

battlefront,330um0,TheNerdyOne_,4,Sun Apr 19 00:26:02 2015 UTC,"Well the trailer is scripted gameplay filmed with cinematic camera positions, not prerendered(cinematic) as you mentioned. Source: Levelcap  4 planets does not mean 4 maps, the Jakku DLC page says it has 2 maps, so it is reasonable to believe vanilla planets will have more than one map each. Which is good because then they can tailor maps to accompany certain game modes better.  And one thing you did not mention is that there will be no classes."
battlefront,330um0,Vaidenasi,2,Sat Apr 18 13:13:32 2015 UTC,"I see what your saying, but the thing I'm worried is that there are only 4 (5 with Jakku) environments. So although there will be around 8 maps, I'm worried about the 8 maps feeling more like 4. Although I do like the idea of having 2 maps per planet so that game modes can be tailored to maps. We'll just have to wait and see I suppose.  About the classes, I'm not too sure how that will play out. I suppose you could customise your load out to suit a traditional class role, for example, taking a sniper and related gadgets so that you fill the role of a recon. You could probably also make hybrid classes as well, which would be cool. Again we'll just have to wait and see, I'm sure DICE will have their reasons."

From their web site:   Wage epic multiplayer battles on Hoth, Endor, Tatooine and the previously unexplored planet, Sullust.   So that's four.  Then further down under the pre-order section:   PRE-ORDER AND BE THE FIRST TO BATTLE ON THE PLANET OF JAKKU.   Then on the pre-order page it says:   GET EARLY DLC ACCESS   So although there's not a tremendous amount to go on, that does look like each DLC is going to include a new environment (planet, etc.) for its associated maps.  DICE generally releases 4 DLC for each game, though with this franchise I imagine they can expand on that significantly.  It should be noted that there is currently no mention of premium / season pass or anything like that, lending weight to their being more than the usual 4 DLC.  We'll have to wait and see.  Anyway, that's at least 5, probably 8, maybe more."

battlefront,330um0,artycharred,-3,Sun Apr 19 21:13:54 2015 UTC,"Splitscreen: Glad they included this. Spilitscreen offline should be a blast   It needs to be online competitive split screen to be worth it. Short missions are going to get boring in the first week.  They've only mentioned co-op, online included, but I want to have the full Battlefrobt experience in ways that I did when I was younger.  This is one argument for having sliders to change graphics.  Nevermind, people have been reading it wrong. Split screen is local only, which is unacceptable especially without Galactic Conquest.  This drops my hype level to near 0. Biggest thing for me about it is split screen and they can't even do that right, guess I'll stick with CoD.  I miss Bad Company."

battlefront,32y0ym,LionsOfDavid,2,Fri Apr 17 18:56:06 2015 UTC,Hard to tell from what they posted. It could be either limited to offline co-op or (fingers crossed) be allowed in online games. But I don't think they would limit it to specific missions of offline mode - I think it would be that any offline game could have splitscreen.
battlefront,32y0ym,teusz16,3,Fri Apr 17 19:03:08 2015 UTC,When I heard of that Partner feature and the split screen functionality I knew those two would go hand in hand.

battlefront,32y0ym,mojave955,-11,Fri Apr 17 17:48:14 2015 UTC,"Not at all.  It's a matter of opinion.  Many SW fans out there share my opinion.  To me it was all garbage, both visually and in story/characters.  Some visuals were pretty cool like Obiwan and Anakin's fighter ships and the x-wing predecessor (ARC-170 I think?), but the prequel tech had very little consistency with the look and timeline of the original films, despite all the excuses fanboys come up with to justify it.  The clones and droids just looked goofy and stupid to me, both in the films and the video games.  Having them in the game are a reminder of just how bad the prequel films were.  No, no, stop right there, don't fire up the paragraphs of debate justifying why they're good and how I just misunderstand George Lucas, it won't do you or me any good.  Like I said, it's a matter of opinion, and in my opinion the prequels (and their visuals/tech) were bad."

They are just slowly building hype and don't want to reveal everything too soon.

Dice is a great developer, but with the time constraints and server resources on launch days, they have always been problematic.   Things don't tend to clear up until a few weeks or even months after launch.    Good games, but there are plenty of frustrations to be had for those of us who play them right out the gate."

It's why battlefield games have 1,000,000 guns and all of them suck; if they reduced the weapon count, people would say it was a downgrade.  You can't take things away from people or they think it's worse.  The lack of space battles has nothing to do with the quality of this game.  Nor does the lack of campaign, which in previous battlefront games was nothing more than 1 human and two teams of bots...which it sounds like they are including."

battlefront,32y0ym,dadschool,2,Fri Apr 17 19:40:55 2015 UTC,Nostalgia vision is getting to a lot of you. Space battle didn't make Battlefront 2. Battlefront 1 didn't need space battles to make it great. Space Battles weren't even that great.
battlefront,32y0ym,Ijitboy,0,Fri Apr 17 19:46:42 2015 UTC,"No? I just want a decent and innovative game. Single player instant action is actually what made battlefront 2 and 1. They got rid of that too. Also if the space battles were done right, they could have been so much better. They have the opportunity to it right with this one, but it is just squandered. Please explain to me why this game isn't a re-skinned battlefield 3."
battlefront,32y0ym,dadschool,2,Fri Apr 17 19:51:12 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong here. I'm an extreme critic of games today. I'm not some ""casual"". But what's exactly wrong with that? It's been 10 years since Battlefront 2. I love the game but I surely don't want just a simple Battlefront HD collection.   If they provide a stable online play, large immersive maps, function shooting mechanics and great vehicles then they have done Battlefront right. That's what Battlefront was all about. Sure there was some extra stuff people wanted 10 years ago but gamers don't demand that anymore. Mainly we needed that to spice up the boring battle against the bots. The bots were boring and dumb, but Battlefront gave us a lot to look past that.   Battlefield has a lot of things wrong with it, but since they've actually fixed the bugs (very recently and far too late imo) it's a nice shooter. If Battlefront is a reskinned functioning BF3 it still has a chance to be a worthy successor. It's the maps and vehicles that will make this game stand out from the Battlefield series, not some game modes."
battlefront,32y0ym,BC_Hawke,2,Fri Apr 17 20:21:47 2015 UTC,"Whats wrong is that I'm not willing to blow $60 on just another FPS. If get down to it, they are making this game out to be another generic FPS. I need them to prove to me that there is something innovative and new about this game, not just battlefield with star wars tacked on.   They are doing to this game exactly what they've done to battlefield. Just keep cranking out re-skins and keep hyping the game up way more than it will deliver. Also with EA publishing I'm especially wary to the shenanigans they pulled before.  Also I agree that bots were idiots before, but ai technology has come a long way. That is my point, they need to leverage new and innovative technologies to make the GAMEPLAY better, not the graphics. Also, new computing technologies will allow them to make classic and immersive space battles, but making pretty trees on endor seems to be more important. It just irks me that early on they specifically said it won't be a re-skinned battlefield, but its exactly what they're doing."

Also an interview with a dev explained the game will be orientated toward multiplayer. Also no space is a huge deal considering its a star wars game and space is integral for the star wars universe. Also another article said there won't be clone wars content. I don't know where you got split-screen from. Theres more information about this game than a short movie trailer. I never got the point of non-gameplay trailers. If they don't show what gameplay will be like (which I believe we play games and not watch them...idk though), then what is their purpose?"

Sure, thanks for showing us what Frostbite 3 can do but the final product wont look near as good.  Edit: I'd also like to include that I'm disappointed but not surprised in the special deals for buying the game now. It's going to be exactly like what Battlefield 3+ has done.

If you played or heard about Battlefield 4(SWBF will be using the same engine), it was terrible unstable at launch.   How gimped will the PC version of the game be considering it's being pumped out to consoles also? This is another issue with gameplay and servers as BF4 suffered terribly on PC in order to make it playable on consoles online. Iconic characters, will there be more than 1 allowed per team? Would this not break immersion?  Last thing I need to play is a game full of Darth Vaders... Destructibility... will there be ample destructible environment like BF4, BFBC2, etc? How about stage changing settings, like BF4's Levelution? Space gameplay? Will it be in the game? Added at a later date? A lot of folks would love to play a Star Wars space sim.  A lot of gamers have played X-Wing and Tie Fighter, they were great games."

If you don't know about premium for battlefield, here is a link to the battlefield 4 store page you can check it out there.

battlefront,3301zn,bingbongyang,6,Sat Apr 18 04:39:12 2015 UTC,No. So far there has been no mention of any Galactic Conquest mode and with only 4 planets (yet multiple maps per planet) there likely wont be one.  However I do have an idea that would satisfy those looking for Galactic Conquest if DICE implemented it:  We know there are currently no more than 4 planets (5 including Jakku) but still multiple maps per planet. So instead of a huge Galactic Conquest with dozens of planets they instead do something similar to Evolve's evacucation mode where the battles take place on the same planets yet each of the previous battles still have an effect on the next one. The Evolve devs at Turtle Rock have proven that a system like that can work with their game (which is multiplayer only but still includes offline bots as well) so why can't it work with Battlefront?

Docking in the enemy ships and fighting your way to all the hot-spots was a blast. Also, the fact that they just threw away an entire trilogy of content??? I'm not so happy with that decision. I also hate the fact that they got rid of a campaign. The one in BF2 was really good and I really enjoyed it. I also don't agree with them getting rid of the XL mode. I imagined almost like a Planetside 2 status of massive maps and huge assaults on massive bases. That would have been beautiful if they had coupled that with a Space Battle happening above the planet at the same time. I just hope that the content that DOES get released can at least somewhat make up for these losses."

Base Battlefront looks like it will be awesome on its own, but EA knows that people will pay even more to have space battles. They know that people will pay for content for Episodes I-III, and later on down the line (maybe when it's released on Blu-Ray?) there will likely be more DLC for Episode VII. As long as the initial release isn't completely barebones and half-baked, I'll be more than happy to pay for the rest of the content.

I don't usually defend EA, I hate their fucking guts and wish it was someone that takes a little more pride in their games making this, but I'm trying to be optimistic and I think all of you guys are just looking for EA to screw up because that's what we're all used to. And they have, to an extent, but I don't think all of it is as bad as people are saying. I personally like both the decision to make it 40 player max instead of 64-- from what I heard lag and overcrowdedness were problems in BF4-- and to cut the prequels in favor of focusing more on the Galactic Civil War, which I thought was way better than the Clone Wars plot of the prequels. I think they need to add space battles and they'll probably need to add more offline missions as time goes on to whet my appetite for the campaign they stole from me."

battlefront,32yiiy,Gourdliege,2,Sat Apr 18 08:27:04 2015 UTC,I wanted this game bad. As soon as I saw EA with the announcement trailer last year or so I could smell the disappointment. It's now half a game it used to be with double the price tag for dlc.

battlefront,32yiiy,reddituser00000,3,Mon Apr 20 15:42:02 2015 UTC,I really do not mind that there is no space battles. I always felt that space battles felt a little stale in all honesty. The reason I think they are leaving out the prequal is that they are trying to hype up the next movie with reliving the events leading up to the movie (and the prequals do not have that great of a reputation among alot of fans)
battlefront,32yiiy,Ratham2,3,Fri Apr 17 23:17:55 2015 UTC,"A part of me is hoping that the lack of prequel content, might mean we get to play as some of the new empire from the movie? I mean I just wonder if part of the reason it feels empty is because they can't talk about stuff/announce is because it hasn't been seen as part of the movie yet."
battlefront,32yiiy,Hungry_Lion,1 point,Sat Apr 18 15:44:03 2015 UTC,"I think that people weren't expecting a carbon copy of the space battles in BF2 with better graphics, they were expecting the space battles to be developed more and have more options and more going on. An improvement would have been better than a complete removal. Also I don't think the movie needs to be hyped up at all, people are already pumped for it and I highly doubt that including the clone wars in this game would have made people less likely to see the new movie."

battlefront,32yiiy,DS_TheDrunkHeavy,2,Sat Apr 18 17:10:27 2015 UTC,Next gen can handle it. BF4 had 64 players IIRC
battlefront,32yiiy,LionsOfDavid,2,Sat Apr 18 01:54:41 2015 UTC,"It did, at low res and choppy framerate. So they can make the game/consoles not look at bad if they scale it back to 40."

I bet you 100$ that the game won't have nearly as many maps on launch as BF2 did (without pre order or season pass nonsense) and if they do, they won't be nearly as good. My proof? How many good maps were in BF3 on launch? I also like how many journalists defended BF:H before release (looking at you, inside gaming) saying how it had just as much content that the previous one did. Yes, but it was going to be the same fucking game. You would expect more content in a sequel because the groundwork has already been laid in the previous game. I feel like Battlefront is going to be like Titanfall: great game, not enough content."
battlefront,32yiiy,Junoh315,1 point,Sat Apr 18 05:11:18 2015 UTC,"It appears that they want it to have this characteristic feel of the old films that's why they're not doing Clone Wars stuff.

battlefront,32yiiy,CashewGuy,1 point,Sat Apr 18 11:18:19 2015 UTC,"In regards to the 40 player cap they have said they have messed about with different numbers and landed on 40 providing the experience to players they want to give.  Now, that is either a truthful answer or a smoke screen response to not wanting to admit they couldn't get 64+ players working smoothly at 60+ FPS.    My guess is that they cut the amount of players down to improve the performance + looks of the game.  But that is just my personal guess.    20 vs 20 will be fine IF there are still the AI armies to contend with."

I could give a shit about the CIS or Clones, so frankly I'm happy there will be no prequel content.  People in this sub are abysmally sad. I'm happy we're getting a new game, and everyone who hates it now can just keep on hating it. I'll enjoy playing it. I wish there was a sub that wasn't so god damn negative about it."

It may be the case that all the Episode 7 content is going to be free but they can't release it until the movie comes out because it's spoiler heavy.   Maybe they'll do a Clone Wars season pass, I could understand that taking a lot more additional dev time because of all the new models, animations, weapons and vehicles they would have to build for it.

battlefront,32yt4m,Defendr,2,Sat Apr 18 01:21:50 2015 UTC,"(Sorry in advance for the long post, but I wanted to outline the problem in detail)  Exactly, money - and in saying this, you have stumbled on the root of the problem!  So, people are already pre-ordering this game - they have been shown a non-gameplay trailer of Star Wars: Battlefront. It's already going to be a best seller simply because it is Star Wars (and Battlefront) and then there's the entire christmas season which it's released just in time for. EA and DICE will prosper, and make a sequel most likely.  It's already a cash-cow for them. The problem lies therein - how much effort do they really need to put in? Now, obviously DICE are incredible developers with a very advanced game engine. I don't doubt DICE at all, but EA are telling them what to do. Remember, EA is publishing it, and therefore funding the project - EA gets what EA wants. EA have a marketing think-tank that literally decides what the consumer wants - but also they know what the consumer will pay extra for. Prequel-content, space content, campaign - these aren't just little afterthoughts that were added to Battlefront, these made Battlefront, and it's an insult to remove them from a Battlefront game only to probably bring them back later for a price, often as day 1 DLC.  It's not going to be a bad game. It'll be a polished and realistic Star Wars experience, don't get me wrong. But you have to realise that anything that has been reduced or cut has been done so because of EA - not because it makes a better game, but because EA have either reduced funding, or are refusing to give DICE more time to work on the game. And you'll never hear DICE say anything except extremely positive statements about it because EA will not allow them to.  And as consumers, we have a right to be critical of this process. This process happens to almost every single AAA title that is released these days, it's just the nature of the industry."
battlefront,32yt4m,BLX15,1 point,Sat Apr 18 01:43:36 2015 UTC,"There is no conventional FPS campaign, but there is a co-op mode like BF3's that they want to incorporate instead. Because nobody buys battlefield to play the campaign. They want to spice it up and give the players something new. The direction to co-op I think is great, because games are always more fun with friends. But it has to be well done. I know EA has a track record of throwing shit into that game as a DLC. And its not acceptable but we've seen the FREE DLC that pre-ordering gives you early access to, but then everyone gets it a week later. They are taking a step in the right direction  But Disney isn't going to let EA or Dice fuck this up.. They know how much this franchise means to a very large amount of people. They don't want to be known as the people to ruin Star Wars, Even more then the prequels."

They showed generic maps (Endor and Both mainly) that were almost certainly going to be in the game. Some standard vehicles which were also guaranteed. A jet pack and portable shield generator were the only things I was not expecting and neither wowed me. That trailer merely confirmed what we knew: they're making a Battlefront game.
battlefront,32y98d,infidelappel,1 point,Sat Apr 18 13:41:43 2015 UTC,"Even for an in engine game, it looks insane. The action looked incredible. The effects look awesome and remind me of the movies. We got to see Jakku, Bob Fett and other stuff.   I don't need a trailer to show me new stuff or stuff I haven't heard about.  Those gta trailers sometimes just have a good, cinematic trailer and it just builds hype. I like I trailer that's entertaining and exciting."
battlefront,32y98d,atomtomb,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:18:21 2015 UTC,"EA is a publisher, not a developer. Some EA games are great, others not so great. All depends on which studio is actually working on it."

With Battlefields, they always show single player before E3 and then multiplayer at E3. With Battlefront, they don't have single player (campaing), so they wait with ""normal"" gameplay presentation till E3.  Also, maybe they aren't ready... Correct me if im wrong, but this game had short dev cycle, right? Shorter than BF4. They couldn't possibly have started working on this BEFORE Disney / EA deal."

battlefront,32y98d,hooblah94,2,Sat Apr 18 00:39:48 2015 UTC,"It's because they can dazzle people who don't know better into being hyped. I just showed the trailer to a few people at my work because they casually play sports games and some of them play the occasional Assassin's Creed. I had to spend a few minutes explaining what the difference between ""in-engine"" and ""gameplay"" was.   It's just a little disappointing to me because seeing the trailer is just that, seeing things. I'm seeing characters and environments that will be in the game (which was cool) but I have no bearing as to what the game will feel like in terms of gameplay. I can usually get a decent feel for what a game would be like to play in about 20 seconds of watching gameplay, if it was actual gameplay and not scripted events I'd be able to say ""Okay it's third or first person, aiming blasters looks tight, oh hey flying a speeder looks neat but hard"" and that's all I hoped for. But with E3 around the corner they probably just wanted to peak our interest again so we'll tune in for EA's conference where they'll almost undoubtedly show gameplay.  So I'm waiting until I see some gameplay before really hyping myself up."
battlefront,32y98d,Icarus_Shmicarus,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:55:25 2015 UTC,I don't see why people are getting so upset.

I think DICE's goal is to create sticky customers that rely on the online community and will purchase games as the population migrates every year or so...it's an effective business strategy, but I feel that the development of bots with iterations of the offline system being implemented in every new game would be another way to maintain that stickiness..."

Why not USE the technologies we have now to instead of making the game real pretty they use the existing model of the first BF  Games (which they very well know everyone loves and wants, and, psst, EA... Actual good games make a lot of money too!) and EXPAND and INNOVATE upon this.  In every field of technology high standards are always upheld, to ensure innovation and quality, just look at computer science or biomedical sciences, I don't see why this is not the case in the field of video game technology.

The reason it doesn't work on some games is because the developers focus too much on making their games look the best possible. So basically they trade split screen and fun game play for ZOMG graphics
battlefront,32vbuv,LionsOfDavid,1 point,Fri Apr 17 06:00:19 2015 UTC,I believe that the new gen consoles can handle that though. I believe that the new consoles have a lot of untapped potential. Its worth a shot at least isn't it?
battlefront,32vbuv,LionsOfDavid,1 point,Fri Apr 17 06:08:53 2015 UTC,I guess what it comes down to is what you see as a good game. I really couldn't care less about the best graphics and 64 live player battles. I thought the system BF 2 had with mixing bots and players was great. Had the feel of a huge battle but less connection woes.  I see a good game as something that has replay ability and good local multiplayer. Call me old fashioned but I think some games are in fact worse without split screen multiplayer.

battlefront,32vbuv,mcbadassington,-5,Fri Apr 17 06:50:58 2015 UTC,"No. Splitscreen on PC is useless, and the game will probably have a hard time to keep 30fps on console so have splitscreen with twice the rendering is completly unprobable. Also, CoD and Halo are ""small scale games"", with low players capacity. Battlefront is suposed to have 64 players. Way too much for today's consoles to handle."
battlefront,32vbuv,Deadpoetic6,2,Sat Apr 18 16:06:16 2015 UTC,"Splitscreen on PC is /not/ useless. That would mean that nobody would use it, and there are definitely people that would use it. Yes, the majority of PC games play solo, LAN, or online, but you only have to google ""battlefront 2 pc splitscreen"" to see that there are people that would use it. You could Google the same with most any game. Heck there's even split screen mods for games such as borderlands. Some people do want Splitscreen on pc. I'm not saying that everyone would use it, but it's certainly not useless. I see no reason why developers will put splitscreen into the console version, but not the pc. It's terribly dissipointing and frustrating when you can't play with your friends just because you don't have a console, and they don't have their own pc with them (or own their own copy)"

battlefront,32vbuv,followedthelink,-3,Fri Apr 17 16:18:48 2015 UTC,"I hate your stupid ass mentality. PC players act like their superior and smarter than console ""peasants,"" but can't even grasp concepts such as plugging in a damm controller or local play. Useless to you isn't useless to everyone. If consoles can handle it(I really don't consider bf2 on ps2 ""small scale"") there is no reason superior hardware on a PC can't. Wanting me to be denied multiplayer with my friends who didn't have 500+ to drop on their own machine, just because you don't want to even see an option to lower the graphics in order to allow others to play, sounds pretty fuckin selfish"

However I understand what you're saying and to answer your question, I think that EA will give us a variety of weapons to choose from, to allow players to select their preference.   Battlefront I and II consisted of (In my opinion) lots of mid-range combat in comparison with Battlefield, which is why those lower firing rate weapons seemed preferable as oppose to CQB where a higher rate of fire weapon may seem a better bet."

I'd recommend picking up a copy of the older games to get a feeling of what Pandemic's what like.  Really right now no one knows for sure what the game is going to be like. But there's a trailer coming out tomorrow, do look out for that."
battlefront,32tck9,scorchedweenus,2,Thu Apr 16 15:44:34 2015 UTC,Apparently this trailer coming out tomorrow will be gameplay footage and not CGI. Not sure if this rumor is true but exciting enough.
battlefront,32tck9,mattyc0291,3,Thu Apr 16 15:48:52 2015 UTC,DICE don't do CGI trailers. All of the trailers for BF3/4 were ingame footage. It's a pretty safe bet that it will be in engine footage.
battlefront,32tck9,Lewd_Banana,2,Thu Apr 16 17:22:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah but using the art assets in their pre-rendered trailers is hardly indicative of how the actual game looks. The trailers always look amazing, the game less so (but still awesome-  just not that awesome)."
battlefront,32tck9,Deepjay,4,Thu Apr 16 22:39:31 2015 UTC,"They are not pre-rendered at all, it's all in game footage shot on a high end PC. They are staged, but nowhere near being pre-rendered. They even have a disclaimer at the start of each video stating that it is all in game footage. DICE have no need for pre-rendered trailers when their games are some of the best graphical titles to come out."

battlefront,32tck9,3nips69,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:56:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's safe to assume we'll be seeing a FPS as that is what DICE does best. In the past it was third person, with iffy space battles.   If DICE can do Battlefront 3 as well as Battlefield 3, with a range of vehicles and landscapes, couple that with 32 players on the field at once, a good amount of weapons and customization, this will hopefully be the best Battlefront title to date.  Play the the Battlefronts chronologically, the first two are cool, but nostalgia is what has supported it for us, I think."

Just lots of customisable gear to make each of your units all their own."
battlefront,30js2u,refractor42,9,Fri Mar 27 23:47:59 2015 UTC,Do you think battlefront should use hitscans or bullets? Given that the shots are super fast energy beams I would think hitscanss would not subtract from the feel and would make connections better.
battlefront,30js2u,plokijuh1229,9,Sat Mar 28 01:45:56 2015 UTC,As long as they have some sort of rather noticeable blaster animation to it. Think of the massive firefights with visible lazer a flying everywhere.
battlefront,30js2u,gimme_snow,6,Sat Mar 28 02:50:52 2015 UTC,"Hitscan according to me feels best for weapons like the Railgun in quake or the AWP in CS. Things that can hit from really far, kill in one shot, but also work in close/mid-range.  However hitscan wouldn't really work on the sniper rifles in any Battlefield game due to the extreme view distance. Hitscan is hitscan, so your bullets will be faster than light and have 0 drop. Also in most hitscan games the weapons don't do less damage on a longer range. This is very important for the Battlefield feel, I think.  Simulating bullets is by far better for any weapon if you ask me. It adds another level to the shooting and it's the most fun part of the combat system I think. Hitscan is seen as a thing from the past. However the way it works now, if you look for weapons with the highest velocity you can get almost-hitscan precision. With faster bullets, there will be fewer ticks before your target dies so you will get less trades if you have the faster weapon.  DICE aren't the only ones doing bullet simulation though. The difference is the others don't do it with 64 players, vehicles and destructable environment that needs to be synced between clients. All those things are the server's job. Server load spikes during Levolution events for example and on some 64p servers you even notice a little bit serverlag with rubberbanding and all during them.  If they manage to improve the server, the game could easily feel as tight as the source games with the added bonus of frostbite graphics. Let's hope they get there!"
battlefront,30js2u,ZoomJet,2,Sat Mar 28 04:32:55 2015 UTC,"less damage on a longer range...This is very important for the Battlefield feel, I think.   Personally, I feel like since they're flying lasers they wouldn't do any less damage the further they fly, right? Also since they're somewhat moving at the speed of light, I think hitscan could work fine. It'd be amazing to have beautifully solid 64 player games."
battlefront,30js2u,OranJ1zz,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:28:12 2015 UTC,"In a lot of hitscan games the weapons do less damage at range. This is falloff damage, CS, Tf2, Insurgency, and even COD has it. Also the simulation of bullets and physics is highly exaggerated in Battlefield. Not saying bf should be realistic but the force of gravity is higher and the bullets move slower than they normally should.   The frustration of the netcode for this IMO is far more irittating than it is worth. I do think that bullet drop and physics is interesting but there must be a better way of doing it or simplifying it so that the game runs better. I don't think hitscan is the thing of the past, a lot of games still use it and it is effective and efficient."

From the perspective of the person controlling the hero, it was awesome to be able to massacre your enemies and turn a battle around on your own.  Adding to this was the constantly draining health, which made it feel like a race to accumulate as many kills or objectives as possible in that time. From the non hero perspective, it was so awesome to place the perfect mine and get a full health kill, or even trying to escape a chasing gunner or jedi.  I won't purchase BF3 unless there are heroes, I consider it such an essential component of the games."
battlefront,2xomfm,lotrdsff,2,Mon Mar 2 18:00:24 2015 UTC,I always thought jedi were well represented in their powers and speed.

They can have fights in the middle of the battlefield or wherever and troopers from the other team can shoot while they fight.

Instead of being able to continuously steady your weapon, sway should come into effect so that you can't so easily snipe away at people. This will force better maneuvering and overwhelming firepower to win engagements.  When projectiles strike, they should cause large particle effects like blowing up dust and smoke so that they appear like they can actually hurt you.

battlefront,2vr6pz,SG-17,2,Sat Feb 14 13:09:10 2015 UTC,The actual innovation one of ours came up with was this one program - which I never fully understood - which basically modified the data going between the online servers and the PS2 allowing for random stuff to be done such as deleting floors or creating a tank which fired rockets at an extremely fast succession.   Did you collaborate with a Raptor during '08 when this program was developed?

Do you have a USB drive capable of storing a ~5.82 GB file?  If so, you can do what I did.  I have a physical copy of the three CD set but the first disk is stuck in a notebook whose disk bay won't open.  Step 1: Install SWBF1 on another computer  Step 2: In C:\Program Files (x86), you should see a folder called LucasArts.  Copy that folder to your removable storage.  Step 3: On your computer, copy that LucasArts folder such that you'll have C:\Program Files (x86)\LucasArts\Star Wars Battlefront.  Step 4 (not sure if this is needed--the version I copied was noCD version AND ALSO there is the GameMaster noCD version if you're interested in multiplayer):  Registry edit your key?    Step 5 (optional): Get BattleBelk's resolution changer  Step 6 (necessary if you want to play multiplayer otherwise optional): Install Gamemaster."

I don't know about legally but here's how you do it morally:   Buy an original disk copy of the game Nab a digital download of the original version from a sketchy website Use the key on the manual of your purchased disk to validate the game Install the 1.1 patch if needed (you shouldn't need to if you acquired the right download.) Install the Gamemaster patch from the sidebar of /r/StarWarsBattlefront to play multiplayer."
battlefront,2uf59u,Riekopo,3,Sun Feb 1 17:01:09 2015 UTC,"I don't buy premium anymore. Australian (console) servers just play mainly vanilla, I got too frustrated with BF3 and so I didn't bother with BF4. Free map packs were so good in the Bad Company days, not only did it not divide the community but each pack brought back tons of players.   Trust EA to screw up a good thing."

battlefront,2uf59u,Wilwheatonfan87,2,Thu Feb 5 17:48:09 2015 UTC,"Seeing as EA has reported that the Battlefield Premium service has been very successful, I don't see why they would abandon that type of DLC structure. As someone who played BF3 with premium and BF4 without, the ""DLC splits the community"" argument that a lot of people state, hasn't really been a problem that I have faced when playing BF4. There are a lot of servers that still run vanilla maps, and always have a good population throughout the day.   Battlefront will most likely be a big selling game, finding people to play with, even after all the DLC has been released, shouldn't be too much of an issue. If someone gets really into the game, I don't see why they wouldn't buy the DLC if they had the cash to afford it anyway."

battlefront,2ug4df,NutellaCrepe1,0,Tue Feb 3 22:18:45 2015 UTC,"It's a massive ongoing problem where companies are releasing unfinished games full price that are sometimes unplayable. By pre-ordering you are green-lighting that behavior of spending more on advertising than the game place itself.  The entitled one here is you, you are part of the problem. He's not ordering you to do it, he's pleading that you don't. Don't get your panties in a bunch because someone is asking you not to promote companies hurting good potential games by lowering the standard for purchase via unchecked promise.   Note also that the plead was only to not pre-order before reviewers, meaning you don't have to miss out on the pre-orders kids meal toys entirely. This problem was massive in the release of ACU where reviewers were unable to post a review basically until release. The game was/is still highly problematic and unplayable to many on PC."

Lately I've noticed some games that make their money back before they're even out have received less than quality support as far as fixing the game goes (not going to name any specific names, but those that have dealt with a composite of the worst aspects of several genres mixed together will understand.) By paying them beforehand, there's no incentive for it to be fixed later seeing as they already have your money."

Not to mention that the friendly AI are just downright retarded, and YOU and YOU ALONE can only take over control points, because for whatever reason friendly NPC's aren't special enough or whatever the hell the designers were thinking.

battlefront,2nq9sj,ovenlovesyou,1 point,Sat Nov 29 04:11:13 2014 UTC,is there an online server list so I can see how many people play the game?
battlefront,2nq9sj,CSGOWasp,1 point,Sun Dec 28 22:26:32 2014 UTC,"I don't know about an accurate comprehensive list, since the BF1 servers are listed on GameTracker as BF2 servers. But here are the stats for the most popular BF1 server, which should give you a good idea:  http://www.gametracker.com/server_info/216.52.148.116:3658/top_players/  I'd estimate that there's about 100 people who play at least once in a 1 month period. On most nights there's usually some server that has a good amount (10+) people playing.  Also, the community is very ""organized"", via the website I linked, so if special events are planned there can be a much larger turnout."

It's also really great for dev because DICE can push updates to the server-side and matchmaking without having to patch the game and go through cert."
battlefront,2n7rhx,crash7800,0,Mon Nov 24 02:52:02 2014 UTC,"my biggest issue is the fact that the server browser never works properly, as in it doesnt show all servers unless you scroll for 5 minutes, maybe it is just me tho lol... Its funny because Bc2 had a setup similar to battlelog that included all the same info and stats and had a working in game server browser. the only difference was you couldnt connect directly to the forums."
battlefront,2n7rhx,DarkLord7854,6,Mon Nov 24 02:57:00 2014 UTC,You're not using the server filters correctly if you have to scroll to see the servers you wish to join
battlefront,2n7rhx,Lackest,1 point,Mon Nov 24 08:52:36 2014 UTC,Actually I have no filters on BF4 but I only can see 2-4 full servers.  It doesn't actually work very well and makes the game feel dead.
battlefront,2n7rhx,DarkLord7854,0,Mon Dec 1 17:22:20 2014 UTC,Set your filters to only show populated servers or click the reset button
battlefront,2n7rhx,DarkLord7854,0,Mon Dec 1 17:48:52 2014 UTC,Im pretty sure i am. Also when you use the filter servers you still dont see all the servers that you should. Unless they have fixed that.

battlefront,2n7rhx,DarkLord7854,0,Mon Nov 24 12:22:47 2014 UTC,Look i dont have it installed atm and i dont want to argue with you. The server browser has not worked properly at all since launch same with the bf3 server browser. A quick google search will show you that what im saying is experienced by many people. You can have your filters set perfectly and every time you refresh you can get servers that did not show up the first time while others magically seem to disappear. just because you think it is working correctly and other just arent using the filters properly does not make it true. Ill go with my experince and the thousands of people who also seem to have the same issues and not some guy who tells me im doing it wrong.  Edit: still an issue in june of 2014. http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/forum/threadview/2979150493964449655/
battlefront,2n7rhx,2_of_5pades,2,Mon Nov 24 14:09:07 2014 UTC,"You aren't alone. There's issues with the web based server browser.  If you set filters, there tends to be a point where too many or certain combinations simply just break it. This coming from a guy that used it both in BF3/BF4 extensively.  Also, add that the occasional browser incompatibility with the game, proves to be another headache the end user has to endure.    The Battlelog team does a better job with a working product than the games they are embedded with.  BF4 was terrible for months, random crashes etc."
battlefront,2n7rhx,r0tzbua,1 point,Mon Nov 24 17:55:51 2014 UTC,"I'm one of the developers part of the BF3 and BF4 Battlelog team, and while I recognize there have been issues, the large majority of problems reported with the server browser have been incorrect usage of the filters  :P"
battlefront,2n7rhx,faelun,-5,Mon Nov 24 15:44:52 2014 UTC,Seems to be more an issue with you guys then. If your filter system is so bad that the majority of people cant use it properly then maybe you guys need to make it easier to use.
battlefront,2n7rhx,Zexis,1 point,Mon Nov 24 16:17:57 2014 UTC,Or maybe you should just have a bit of patience and take a look at them.
battlefront,2n7rhx,arjunpalia,0,Tue Nov 25 12:55:33 2014 UTC,Im not even sure what you mean by that... Take a look at the filters? if so im pretty sure i know how to use filters properly. As do the thousands of other people who have the same issue.
battlefront,2n7rhx,Purona,1 point,Tue Nov 25 13:46:50 2014 UTC,Have you tried narrowing your search sir
battlefront,2n7rhx,throwaway123314,7,Sat Nov 29 08:22:37 2014 UTC,"Lets pray it does. I for myself love Battlelog. It's one of the most responsive and fully featured stats/server browsers out there.  When I remember the days of the battlefield 1942/Vietnam or even BF2 server browsers the current solution just works so much better and quicker. All the flaws you listed in that post down there have nothing to do with the fact that it's in the browser. If you don't find the server you want either filter for it or if it's a single one, simply favourite it.  for me battlelog works great and is quite exactly what I expect from a stats and browser tool. Since its dice proprietary software I'm also 99% sure Battlefront will run on it.   Also I'm pretty sure you'll find the same problems you experience with a lot of other in-game solutions."

battlefront,2km121,elosoloco,0,Thu Oct 30 17:16:50 2014 UTC,You're at a disadvantage playing like that; you can see round the corners in third person. It's also much easier to time your jumps properly in third so you won't e.g. fall down the holes on Death Star.
battlefront,2km121,David182nd,-2,Wed Oct 29 18:52:19 2014 UTC,Well Battlefront was set to third person by default so I'm sure you're in the minority. I don't mind that it's in first person though

Let's be real here guys... 3rd person in a shooter will just be exploited by wall campers it will change the pace of battle and just make it a camp fest in urban areas. I understand that battlefront use to main 3rd person view but gamers have evolved and for competitive gamers this will ruin the game and will get annoying fast.

Everything about it was not at all thought out, and the UAV is totally game breaking for everyone benefiting from it. The little bar where you can drop things like crates was poorly laid out. Why would I drop one ATV to make one guy happy, when I can drop two crates to make a LOT of people happy?  Don't get me wrong I love commander mode (division 1 in the world baby!)

I bought Battlefront 2 for Xbox on release night which happened to be October 31/November 1st so they held a Halloween costume contest party before the release at the Gamestop.  I was a member of the Battlefront Gang that played with lots of the competitive players from Xbox in tournaments.  Most of my friends list is still old Battlefront people.

In Delaware, we had crazy storms that flooded a bunch of roads.  I was in 11th grade at the time and was driving to school, so after school I braved the storm and picked up a copy on Xbox and headed home.  It was still storming massively when I got home and the wooded area in my back yard was flooding.  I started up the game and remember playing the Kamino level while it was storming outside in real life.  Such a comfy afternoon.  :)"

battlefront,2dgysq,Lycanther-AI,5,Thu Aug 14 14:14:36 2014 UTC,No. The studio that was working on it (Pandemic) was closed. Free Radical picked it but then there was a whole shitstorm with who actually owns what. During all that Lucasarts cancelled the game when even when it was 99% complete. no one picked up BF until Disney bought Star Wars.  1313 was just cancelled because of Disney closing Lucasarts. I don't know why they didn't continue it. I was looking forward to it.

Once you get the award, you only have it for that life. However, if you die within a certain amount of time after getting it, then you still have it next life (e.g. if you die 1 second after getting the award).  I dunno how long that timer is though, sometimes it seems like you have to kill someone before you lose the award. Perhaps the weapon awards work differently to the health/energy ones. It'd make sense if you, for example, keep energy regeneration if you die within 10 seconds, and keep Flechette if you die before you kill someone despite it being over 10 seconds. But yeah I dunno for sure.   I think when you're playing offline, once you get the awards a certain amount of times, you have them every life."

battlefront,29qclj,trainiac12,1 point,Mon Jul 7 23:14:52 2014 UTC,"The only thing I dislike about playing as the droids is the way the super battle droids are the basic infantry unit. Their rate of fire was too slow, especially for close range fights, and something just seemed off about using them in medium to long range engagements. Any of the other three basic infantry units I could easily kill people halfway across the map on big ones like Geonosis or Hoth, and lay down effective suppressing fire and all that. With the droids, I still did okay, but not anywhere near as good.* If DICE swaps that out for a regular battle droid with a rifle, and either makes an upgraded super (maybe in a way that makes them more like the Wookiees, slow but powerful with high health) one of the higher tier classes or switches its role (I'm thinking anti tank or engineer, personally), the droids will be just as good as any of the other factions.  *On the other hand, the Magna Guard is one of my favorite unlock units."

The 501srt had their awesome game all to themselves, with great gameplay and a great story. Why dig them back up and shoehorn them into another game?  Just because an element of the old game was good it doesn't necessarily mean it should be repeated in the new game. I would like to be introduced to a brand new group of Clone or Stormtroopers and have their awesome story told.  Or, even better, have a group of Rebel Troopers be the central part of the campaign."

battlefront,29ezhq,LysergicAcidDiethyla,2,Mon Jun 30 11:59:53 2014 UTC,No. It shouldn't.  Battlefront 2 was a game dedicated to the 501st. It was their game.  To add them into the Battlefront remake (which isn't even Battlefront 3) just for the sake of having them in there would be a poor move on behalf of the makers of the game. It would be simply to satisfy fans and would in fact detract form the importance and significance of the 501st having their own game.  I'll be very disappointed if they do show up as an integral part. Maybe they could be mentioned but certainly not play a vital role in the campaign.
battlefront,29ezhq,samccall,2,Mon Jun 30 16:13:36 2014 UTC,"When did it become a bad thing to satisfy the fans? There is a whole lot more to the 501st then could be explored in one game, why not expand on their epic storyline?"
battlefront,29ezhq,LysergicAcidDiethyla,3,Mon Jun 30 16:47:40 2014 UTC,"Because the series is 'Battlefront' not 'The Story of the 501st'.  And re-using old themes to please fans alone in place of actually making a good game isn't a good idea.  They should explore other areas of Star Wars instead of focussing on one part.  I'm not saying it's bad to satisfy fans, I'm saying doing something simply because it satisfies fans is never a good idea. I want the new game to have its own personality and merits."

However a DICE employee tweeted this so there is some hope for the Clone Wars. Either way it's too early to come to conclusions. I'm sure that they're holding back on several of the game elements until Spring.  That being said I really enjoy the Clone Wars era. The Droids add variety and have potential for some really cool abilities. Sure the prequel trilogy had terrible dialogue and acting but it had really great battles and planets. I'd like to see DICE explore some of the settings from the Order 66 scene in Episode III as well. Such as Felucia, Mygeeto and Cato Neimoidia; they are really stunning settings."

battlefront,27wx1d,mysterx,1 point,Thu Jun 12 11:41:51 2014 UTC,It's nice that EA has let up on release dates a little so DICE can do both Battlefront and Mirror's Edge properly

battlefront,27pyhe,MoistCigar,1 point,Mon Jun 9 20:02:31 2014 UTC,"Yep, but still, since it's real-time renders this is technically what the game could look like. The problem is that there wouldn't be many computers that could run it (The Crysis problem as it were). It would still be awesome if they could have a video setting basically called ""mega ultra super quality"", just so in the future people can play it with even better graphics."

battlefront,27pyhe,darthbarracuda,1 point,Mon Jun 9 21:02:21 2014 UTC,It'll most likely come out a month or two before the movie.

battlefront,27qwjz,I_shot_Mr_Burns,3,Thu Jun 19 09:17:47 2014 UTC,It's been a constant discussion since we first found out that DICE was taking over the project. What they showed at E3 calmed my nerves a little bit and I'm a bit less worried that it is going to completely flop.   The only thing I'm scared about right now is   Stability BF getting EA'd   No micro transactions or stupid battlepacks will make me the happiest man in the world.
battlefront,27qwjz,xzenocrimzie,3,Tue Jun 10 03:12:05 2014 UTC,You know that EA is going to find a way to Fuck it up.

Choose specific coloration/pattern of armor, and then get to choose the members of your squad. Whether you want to go heavy troopers or more of a recon/scout outfit would be up to you.  Couple that with some sort of skill tree design(?) or other such character customization/progression.  Then they drop you and your squad onto Felucia and you get right into the action, deciding how to reach your objective in whatever way you want.  And bingo, 10/10, game of the year, etc."
battlefront,27qwjz,Ajaax17,1 point,Tue Jun 10 13:21:21 2014 UTC,"The only problem with character customization is that they could have people pay money for a cool-looking gun.

Lots of gameplay and also some online menus, how that's going to work. I mean, SWBF had no customisation before (minus a PSP one I think) and that was pretty cool, but I don't expect it to be like that now. So I'd like to see the various classes and such that are on offer.   What do I hope they show that they will 100% not show? How they've tried not to remove too much of what made the old games good. The new game is probably gonna be quite different to what we saw before."
battlefront,27m907,David182nd,2,Sun Jun 8 14:02:32 2014 UTC,The customization in the two psp games was actually pretty good. Think the black ops 2 pick 10 system but with everything unlocked right away.
battlefront,27m907,Zthordorus,1 point,Sun Jun 8 17:15:01 2014 UTC,"Actually everything wasn't unlocked at first, you had to beat the campaign on hard to get everything (jetpack or chaingun for example)."
battlefront,27m907,t8ke,1 point,Mon Jun 9 12:51:38 2014 UTC,I'm hoping for a lot more gameplay footage with an emphasis on how theyre going to meld the old gameplay style of SWBF with more modern gaming trends like classes and loadouts. I wonder if they'll incorporate heroes again as well!

I got that whenever I tried to join anything, but I was able to play with my brother vs bots, which was really all I needed fortunately. You can't really lose, but it's still fun.   The only thing I found was a file with cd key in the name that you can open and enter a key in. I don't know if it's supposed to retain the one you're using, but when I reopen it it's empty even if I just typed it in. It didn't affect anything for me either (I found that and checking your game cache as recommended things online, neither did anything). Considering the game didn't even run until I got my key, I'm not sure if you really need to enter it anywhere. Maybe that's a blanket message. Then again... I couldn't enter any servers.  Does my being able to host for personal games despite not being able to join other ones mean that will still be possible after gamespy shuts down?

As of writing this, the Empire and Republic are neck and neck for most popular, with Rebels taking up 3rd and the Confederacy a distant fourth.  Hoth is the most popular map (no surprises there), with Death Star, Mustafar, Kashyyyk, Kamino and Coruscant also appearing to be quite popular. Conquest is by far the most popular game type, although Hero Assault is also ahead of the rest by some margin.  Something that does surprise me is that almost twice as many people play in third person as first. I've always played BF2 as a first person game, so I guess it's just a bit of a surprise to me to find so many people play in third. I also don't like how the third person camera is right above the character, rather than the over-the-shoulder camera that most 3ps games use these days, but whatever floats your boat."

It is considered to be part of the Star Wars official universe set to be consistent with the movies.    Thus far, the Star Wars: Battlefront 3 release date is rumoured to be on 2015 and it will be tied in to J.J. Abrams' Star Wars film.  It will include a story that needs to meet the standards set forth by Lucasfilm. Whether or not Lucasfilm will have their own staff working on the game wasn't made clear in the blog post, but at the very least we now know that the story needs to be consistent with what happens in the films."

As soon as the movie's released the game would feel out of date without the new characters/factions.

battlefront,24tmuc,Goose977,4,Tue May 6 00:33:53 2014 UTC,"Please don't tempt EA with more ideas for DLC. I don't want to see a long list of crap that they're charging for $10 each.   I also would not like the game to turn into a grind where you have to 'level up' to 60 to get into gear and the such. A system that is more akin to how Red Orchestra 2 does it is perfect. As you keep fighting you get very slight buffs to your weapon handling that is noticable, but subtle. As you accrue more and more gametime, the armour on your character gets more worn from all the combat. Once you reach a certain level there's a chance that you'll spawn in as a 'hero' unit who gives bonuses to soldiers around him, and wears very unique armour (that can be changed and stuff).   Also remember that Battlefront 2 did extremely well not because it had 200+ weapons armours and grenades, but it held itself up because it was fun to play and everything was balanced. I'd be okay with only having 1-3 weapons per class (because honestly, there aren't a lot of variations of standard issue blasters and the such).   Customizing your soldier to a certain extent would be fantastic. Little subtle marks of individuality once you put in enough time into the game. Nothing stupid like using stormtrooper body armour while playing as a clone trooper if you get my drift.   Automatically having the soldier camo change depending on the environment is paramount. Variations of different environmental camos can be unlocked with enough effort.   And something that I'd really really really REALLY like to see is Endurance maps.   Large maps with a metric fuck ton of objectives and command posts, hundreds of players on the map, and thousands of reinforcement tickets as well as a balanced amount of vehicle spawns. Matches in this mode should last a couple hours each."

I don't know what the Empire could have.   A Wampa Survival gamemode would be nice.   And last but not least, weather events on maps like Hoth and Tatooine. None of that falling building bullcrap."
battlefront,24tmuc,SuperSmith_,2,Tue May 6 00:54:20 2014 UTC,"I hope they don't go crazy with ""rank ups"" and rewards.  Battlefront II had a nice balance, where long-time, good players had access to special weapons, but those weapons weren't necessarily better than others, just different (and, in the right hands, more effective).  It shouldn't simply be like Halo or CoD where playing a lot gives an automatic advantage."
battlefront,24tmuc,HecticEpic,1 point,Fri May 9 18:08:52 2014 UTC,"I know I'm late to the thread but I really just want to see multiplayer galactic conquest servers. There could be two commanders facing off and it could be clan vs clan or just publicly populated armies. Also the galaxy should be a bit larger and more simple to move around.   I would also love to see the game stay unique from other shooters. Keeping equipment simple and very well balanced makes it feel more like clone army vs cis I think. Give us diversity of equipment based on location not seniority. Like underwater battles on Mon calamari, for example, would have totally different guns and tactics but everyone still is using only the 2 or 3 weapons for their class. I think it encourages teamwork.   Last thought would be to increase the scale by 10x on some maps toss AI into multiplayer just to give the battle a gender scale."

I want the controls to be a lot smoother and would like to see a good amount of maps, and also more game modes. If they do multiplayer there are too many things to count that I want them to do. With the futuristic look they could learn a thing or two from halo. When I say that I don't mean the guns as much, but rather the jet packs, invisibility, shields, and those kinds of things. Having co-op for either 2 player or 4 player that is either local or online. Maybe a survival campaign similar to zombies, aliens or just quite simply a survival, but in the Star Wars universe obviously. Keeping the classes similar to the other games to a certain degree as in the droids, clones and rebels being how they were in the previous games and making them on the same playing field too. Definitely making space battles as well. Space battles are the shit."

It might be interesting to be able to blow up lamps and knock the lights out or entirely shoot through a wall or floor. Maybe even blow up a whole base? Sometimes it seems atleast 500 grenades go off in one base, seems like at that point it would explode. Ability for engineer to repair, of course.   Diverse attacks and weapons; melee, dual wielding, knives, rope, grappling hooks (climb and repel), morter fire, fire, poison dart, return of electric grenades, booby traps, ambushes, taunting, freeze rays,   Injury and revival. When someone taking a base gets inflicted with from severe shrapnel, and then their team mates successfully take the base, it seems like I should be able to drag my teammate who's not quite dead to a health both to heal (republic commando).  Set number of jedi per map and which jedi.    Multiple passenger spaces on ships, especially transport ships. I want to be able to have a transport ship on geonosis hover above the battlefield so that i can snipe downward and walk to an ammobot on the transport to recharge my ammo, without having to be in a ballturret or pilot seat. I want to be able to jetpack on and off and have it come pick me up and drop me off without me having to fly it.  During galactic conquest; planetary bonuses and alliances. For example, if kashyyyk is under my control i should have access to bow casters or if i control mustafar i should have clone AI on my team"

The second part of your post though, I think people have a knee-jerk reaction to anything with an EA label on it and automatically think it's going to be the worst disaster of a video game of all time.  I'm not even a Battlefield player and every time I watch the videos online I want to play.   The core game itself and the concept are fantastic.  Given the problems that Battlefield 4 has, it's ludicrous to think that DICE wouldn't be keenly aware and make every effort not to repeat the same mistakes.  They've stated numerous times they know how much of a responsibility making a new Star Wars: Battlefront game will be.  Just give it time."

battlefront,23f2z0,PENNYDIM_,2,Sat Apr 19 05:48:25 2014 UTC,I recently encountered this problem and this subreddit fixed it for me.  Battlefront II has a weird DirectX bug that means it's checking for a microphone when you launch a game.  Plug anything (doesn't have to be a mic) into the microphone jack and launch. It'll work.
battlefront,23f2z0,PraiseTheMetal591,2,Sat Apr 19 10:08:03 2014 UTC,Here is a link to the thread I posted which has some solutions that worked for me
battlefront,2397vk,WonderMouse,10,Thu Apr 17 08:48:51 2014 UTC,"I believe they have said they're going with 3rd person. As for custom classes, I want limited customisation, maybe emblems or custom guns. But I really don't want them to have multiple armours unless for say the disorganized rebels. Some of my favourite parts of the games were when you started with a single command post and it was loads of stormtroopers charging down a hallway, especially on galactic conquest when you hadn't unlocked any other classes. But agreed, I bet there'll be Battlefield style ""expansions"" which are just buffed up map packs. I don't want to pay to play on Hoth, but you know what, I'm predicting it now, Hoth is a pre-order map... It's cruel enough to happen."

battlefront,2397vk,Unwanted_Commentary,7,Thu Apr 17 10:40:43 2014 UTC,"My biggest fear would be that EA pushes them to release it during the same time Episode VII. I want them to spend as much time on it as possible to be as perfect in terms of netcode and gameplay. As far as the DLC goes, I think the DLC pricing is somewhat fair. Depending on the type of DLC that is introduced and the game itself I might buy them. It would be interesting if the DLC focused on the expanded Star Wars universe."
battlefront,2397vk,JulianJanganoo,3,Thu Apr 17 16:40:08 2014 UTC,"I think you're spot on.  I seriously don't mind being nickeled and dimed.  They are a for-profit company and I don't want their poor executives to have to have to downgrade from a Lamborghini to a Corvette just because we all want something for nothing.   netcode and gameplay   This, this, and this again.  If they fail here, I won't be buying the game.  Give us third person.  Give us hero assault.  Give us advanced movement and vehicles and improved space.  Keep the bots.  Focus on multiplayer.  Implement sound netcode so that irrational nonsense doesn't occur ingame.  The Battlefront series currently has one of the best physics engines of any games I have played in terms of stability.  Things need to be clean and predictable and fun.  Realism comes second, if at all."

battlefront,2397vk,Wintergore,-2,Fri Apr 18 10:25:39 2014 UTC,"yes for over 300 hours, it was good. In BF3 it took some skill and practice to be good, in BF4 its just point, click, drag mouse down a tiny bit, win. every gun feels the same, and there's virtually no recoil"
battlefront,2397vk,Unwanted_Commentary,4,Thu Apr 17 11:40:08 2014 UTC,Why does everyone have such a recoil fetish?  Recoil is not a part of the Battlefront series.  Why should lasers even have recoil?  It's a hindrance to both gameplay and realism.

battlefront,21v3d1,agustin-barris,2,Tue Apr 1 02:33:39 2014 UTC,"Standard blasters were definitely underpowered in BF2 and BF1 on multiplayer, but I kind of liked that since it forced people to use strategy and movement instead of aim (shotgun, rockets, specials, jets, jedi).    That being said, a lot of the infantry classes in BF2 felt like waiting games during real competition since it was basically a DPS contest."
battlefront,21v3d1,Unwanted_Commentary,3,Tue Apr 1 02:48:00 2014 UTC,"Well if you were to shot someone and kill them straight away, it might not be the greatest gaming experience (especially if you were not into hardcore shooters).

battlefront,21v3d1,Titus132,1 point,Sun Apr 6 20:23:29 2014 UTC,"I would think the damage model would be close to BF4 where most of the guns [at least assault rifles] have the same damage model but different rate of fire or stability.

battlefront,21v3d1,AMBocanegra,-2,Tue Apr 1 01:51:09 2014 UTC,"Absolutely no recoil.  I absolutely detest artificial constraints that are put in video game weapons.

It's also easier to diagnose and fix if you start this process as soon as you run into the problem.  2: Google ""[software] [operating system] [vague-ish description of problem]""  I hope this helps.

(NOTE: this concerns the regular troopers only)  CIS: Slower firing, slightly stronger main weapon.   empire: Same as rebels, juts a lot less accurate. Maybe slightly stronger.

I think they should really just keep it the way it is, unlocking in game and such, but think it would be nice if there where some unlockables/progression/achievements effecting wether or not you have an advantages in the game. More like visuals for weapons, armor but off course without taking it to the extremes, just minor unlocks. Also a ranking system could be nice, where you could play ranked matches (both scoring points for being a team player and your solo achievements(to still emphasize teamplay and some tactics))!   iMO"

Star Wars has some of the most iconic music of all time, I'm sure they will find a way to capture the magic again and still make it an intense video game sounding. I'm not too worried about space battles, I think they know how unique that is and will find a way to make it fun. Just hope ground battles stay true to what they used to be and don't turn into modern day shooters. I'm fine with huge massive armies duking it out on immense maps, you just have to put CPs in there to capture. It always added that extra strategy that games like cod don't have."

battlefront,1yn1by,Parthros,3,Sun Feb 23 06:12:08 2014 UTC,"I disagree with the ground to space battles not being important.  From a business perspective, ground to space battles are what people are expecting, ever since the footage was leaked.  Not to mention how AWESOME they would be to play!

battlefront,1yjcpz,jeovex,4,Fri Feb 21 14:40:30 2014 UTC,"To the scopes, it might be cool as a visor mode, maybe class specific though.  Different armor suits would be great. I severely hope we get customizable armour for a team of clones.  Yea the invasion mode is pretty cool and I hope it does happen. If youever player Battlefront: Elite Squadron, you involve the ground battle with the space battle and vice versa though it is indirect as you have to press a button to ""transition to space"" or to the ground battle.  The wampa hunt existed in BF2 but the way you described it, I would hope the Wampas have more health."
battlefront,1yjcpz,jeovex,1 point,Fri Feb 21 15:26:46 2014 UTC,"I've played Elite Squadron, very fun game. But a gamemode dedicated to the invasion of a planet would be the best, and I agree that wampas should be very hardy animals, and maybe they could make it be a blizzard or whatever is appropriate for the climate to make it easier on the wampas and harder on the troopers who are out of their element."

battlefront,1yjcpz,plokijuh1229,2,Fri Feb 21 19:12:05 2014 UTC,"That would be cool, but I think players would like it on an individual level, maybe they could add a time spotted reduction boost or something small like that if you have all the same camo/armor."

battlefront,1xjr76,blackhatter777,2,Mon Feb 10 21:26:53 2014 UTC,PC version? Yes!
battlefront,1xjr76,blackhatter777,5,Mon Feb 10 21:48:20 2014 UTC,"I'd love to play the PC version. I only have BF2 on PC, but I have way too many memories with BF1. Don't take it the wrong way, BF2 is the shit."
battlefront,1wbdyf,Lolacaust,1 point,Mon Jan 27 22:04:37 2014 UTC,What's battlefront extreme?
battlefront,1wbdyf,michaelarm,1 point,Tue Jan 28 15:18:54 2014 UTC,A nod for battlefront 2 that makes the game more competitive and changes the mechanics
battlefront,1wbdyf,michaelarm,1 point,Tue Jan 28 15:34:48 2014 UTC,Ohh cool...thanks...is it for the PC version?
battlefront,1v3nfd,Ender94,2,Mon Jan 13 11:28:22 2014 UTC,"Space to Ground maps?  Those are fun, but don't expect to find any servers online supporting anything but the original game maps.  You need to use instant action with them."
battlefront,1v3nfd,xaliber,1 point,Tue Jan 14 05:27:55 2014 UTC,"Do you have link to any Space to Ground maps? I found the package on FileFront/GameFront, but I can't seem to access the download.  EDIT: Nevermind, turns out Filefront/Gamefront is blocked outside US. Had to use proxy. :/"
battlefront,1uysmw,Gandaf,3,Sat Jan 11 16:40:52 2014 UTC,This could be relevant for me as well.
battlefront,1uysmw,kollapse1,2,Sat Jan 11 21:06:39 2014 UTC,"Nice, I'm thinking like a steam group where we could play once a week and then have some big and awesome battles."
battlefront,1uysmw,jeovex,1 point,Mon Jan 13 06:54:07 2014 UTC,Is this still a thing? Is there a group formed?
battlefront,1unbsl,colonelbyson,3,Tue Jan 7 20:00:28 2014 UTC,"I have this on half of the computers I play on, the main solution has been updating audio drivers, followed by Parthros' answer."
battlefront,1unbsl,Eats_Gold,2,Wed Jan 8 07:54:40 2014 UTC,"This issue is common. You can search Google for a better guide, but basically you have to enable studio stereo mix.  EDIT: Called it the wrong thing"
battlefront,1unbsl,Parthros,1 point,Tue Jan 7 22:53:53 2014 UTC,"I don't know what that is :/  Edit: Looked it up, tried doing that but when I get to the ""Recording"" tab in the sound manager, there is nothing labeled ""Studio Mix"" or anything like it.  Edit 2: I also plugged headphones into the microphone jack-didn't fix."
battlefront,1unbsl,peanuthead9094,1 point,Wed Jan 8 07:01:16 2014 UTC,"Download Realtek audio drivers, and then you should see the stereo mix. It worked for me on Win8.1"
battlefront,1ukitb,mcbadassington,9,Mon Jan 6 21:47:24 2014 UTC,"God willing exactly like in battlefield because I really really want to pilot an x-wing with the oculus rift. Excuse me while I go simultaneously play battlefront 2, fantasize about 3, and jizz myself over the idea of piloting an x-wing"
battlefront,1ukitb,megamando,3,Mon Jan 6 22:02:50 2014 UTC,"MBTs will pry be the same ones in BF2, M-2 Saber (hovered) Transport vehicles idk but transport choppers obviously Lambda Class Shuttles will be one along with LAATs(clone gunships)  LAVs are probably harder to figure out but attack jets and beer are simple, x wing, ties, the star fighters in BF2! Pretty cool post."
battlefront,1ukitb,FlpFlopFatality,3,Fri Jan 10 13:20:31 2014 UTC,Maybe the A5-RX will be like the AAV Amtrac.
battlefront,1ukitb,megamando,1 point,Fri Jan 10 13:34:53 2014 UTC,"I think they're going to probably dig into the expanded universe and see what they find there (I don't actually know whats there...) I also wouldn't be surprised if they just made all new vehicles! Because this is fiction right? And as long as they are dreamed up by the guys who actually do star wars cannon for a living I will be fine with that!   But the vehicle that I hope makes it into the game is the B-Wing starfighter! That thing looks BAD. ASS. The offensive firepower it would have would be amazing!   Though now that I brought up starfighters, do you thing they will handle like battlefield jets (IE, basically impossible to fly without a ton of practice?) or do you think they'll be easier like Battlefront 2? I'm hoping for midway personally."
battlefront,1ukitb,FlpFlopFatality,2,Thu Jan 16 16:43:31 2014 UTC,"Me, personally... I find that the battlefield jets are simple to fly, but totally impossible to be a killing machine like the 1/50th of the BF community. I would love to see all of the Rebel vehicles versus all of the Empire vehicles with 64 versus 64(128 players). And the ability to go from air to ground fluidly. And truly I don't know what the hell they will consider EU nowadays. Being Disney said that the EU is kinda out the window... But at this point I don't know, I just want this damn game to be perfect and not rushed. wink wink BF4."
battlefront,1ukitb,megamando,2,Thu Jan 16 23:08:05 2014 UTC,"That would be pretty awesome 64 v 64?!?! Ohhh... That gives me chills! I like that idea!   But ok, I figured out how to fly it easy enough, not that hard, but becoming good enough that you can actually dogfight with the pros, and then be effective with helping the ground force!? Forget about it!"
battlefront,1ukitb,FlpFlopFatality,1 point,Fri Jan 17 03:32:29 2014 UTC,Same. I can fly but the instant I take a fee bullets I explode while when I put a couple in some other dude he just flys on.
battlefront,1ukitb,megamando,1 point,Fri Jan 17 14:00:45 2014 UTC,"Yeah! I mean, I don't know how the hell the four that good, but you can't compete with that! I hope they balance it easy more  seeing as air battles will be actually important!"
battlefront,1ukitb,FlpFlopFatality,1 point,Fri Jan 17 17:40:16 2014 UTC,Air was one of the coolest things. Especially Hoth I hope they throw an x-wing and a tie fighter I to that map along with of course snow speeders.
battlefront,1ukitb,thisonetimeonreddit,1 point,Fri Jan 17 17:49:47 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah! Hoth was my favorite map! I loved the snow speeders! Though the ai was shit and couldn't hit shit, and then also can't fly strait for me to get a good shot ! Good news is I nearly perfected doing both by myself (by switching seats)  But I don't think they had any x wings (or other ships) because I think they were trying to hold off the fleet so the transports to get away. The only one left was Luke's personal fighter (and then totally bailed on his friends with our even telling them he was going like a little shit I would've wrote down ""Luke Skywalker: Missing in Action, Presumed Dead""! Sk he had to say was he had somewhere to go, and won't be rejoining the fleet! Damn it luke!) But I think tie fighters would be good! They have cannons, and went totally unopposed on hoth, and were able to just cut through the walkers (I say cut through because they used tow cables and not weapons, and that's impressive.)"
battlefront,1ukitb,thisonetimeonreddit,2,Fri Jan 17 18:07:32 2014 UTC,"Well, forgive the cynic in me, but considering DICE's track record with vehicles, probably they will lag terribly and bounce off each other horribly any time they are in close proximity."
battlefront,1u1zgr,SooperPig,5,Mon Dec 30 23:47:07 2013 UTC,"I just finished playing bf2 using my retail version, against my friend with steam version. Same servers. But i did not check what versions either of us had."
battlefront,1u1zgr,GENTOOO,3,Tue Dec 31 09:04:45 2013 UTC,Thanks man. :D
battlefront,1u1zgr,squipple,4,Tue Dec 31 11:47:05 2013 UTC,"I was under the impression that most people here with the Steam version say it's the latest official one....  Though it would be good for you to download the unofficial patches, the conversion mod, and the dark forces mod.  There is another graphical improvement mod, but its name is slipping my mind right now...."
