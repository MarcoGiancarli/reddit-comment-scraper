Roku,3e4jfg,ooosadface,4,Tue Jul 21 22:12:42 2015 UTC,Thats pretty cool. I'd still like a Firefox or chrome option to broadcast to the roku so I can take advantage of a desktop/laptop to Roku option.
Roku,3e4jfg,LukeNeverShaves,2,Tue Jul 21 23:57:57 2015 UTC,Firefox does this on the Roku. Chrome will as well.   http://support.roku.com/entries/56637184-How-do-I-use-Firefox-Video-Casting-BETA-  https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-firefox-android-send-videos-your-roku

Roku,3e4jfg,LukeNeverShaves,2,Wed Jul 22 02:08:34 2015 UTC,I assume Google has it like that for a reason because the chromecast would be pointless when you could basically get a Roku stick to do the same thing. I think firefox is closer using their browser to stream to the beta channel on the Roku but its still in development last I looked.
Roku,3e4jfg,Ice_Pirate,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:38:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Google would be wise to open the API though and rake in ad revenue by allowing people to ""throw"" YouTube to their TVs via any streaming device that supports mirroring."
Roku,3e4jfg,RowdyOtis,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:29:17 2015 UTC,You can install the chromecast plugin or the google cast plugin and chrome will pick up your Roku.

Then, on your laptop go to devices (I think) and it should pop up to connect to.  The difference here is that you can cast the video only, full screen straight to the TV. Much quicker/simpler."

Roku,3e3o46,thedreamcomparison,2,Tue Jul 21 18:35:15 2015 UTC,"Looking at your Plex setup for one, it's possible that you have content that's way higher bitrate than Netflix is offering. It should be playable - the Roku can decode it and in theory the bitrate's lower than what the Roku's wi-fi would max out at. The problem could be that your wi-fi's on a channel that's crowded and therefore it has to slow down, causing the buffering. It's fast enough to not buffer on Netflix, but not fast enough to play high-bitrate local content. Change your wi-fi channel. Check local networks to see what channels they're on, and choose the least-used one.  Try low-bitrate local content. See how it handles that.  As for Hulu, how does it work on other devices/desktop/laptop? It could be a problem between you and Hulu, ISP problems etc. Rule out as many things as you can."
Roku,3e3o46,WG47,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:35 2015 UTC,Thank you! That gives me some things to look into. I was kind of at a loss as to how to investigate it. I'll see what I can find.
Roku,3e3o46,crybannanna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:39 2015 UTC,Plex works fine for me if my media server is wired to my router. It buffers if the server is on wifi.   I also need to be sure to stop any other programs running on the server machine... Though it isn't the newest computer so the CPU might just be underpowered for the transcoding job. I tend to reduce quality as much as I can stand to help with that too.

Roku,3e0ric,dbotamous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:44:58 2015 UTC,Definitely the cable. And not necessarily a bad cable.  I had the same problem. Turned off the tv.. unplugged the cable.  Left tv off for a few minutes. Plugged cable back in. Turned TV back on. It has worked ever since.  I have only seen it happen that once.
Roku,3e0ric,jkravny,2,Tue Jul 21 14:47:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah sorry, I didn't mean to imply the cable was bad. For some reason (and it seems like the cheaper cables) once in a while you get the purple screen. Like I said usually you can get away with just unplugging the cable from the Roku and plugging it back in.  It's not a Roku problem cause I have had this screen with my AFTV. Like I said it's something with the cable, no idea what it is."
Roku,3e0ric,dbotamous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:03:37 2015 UTC,My only other thought is how you said it is currently hooked up. Previously you had it going through a Denon which I am guessing decoded the DRM (I could be wrong about that)? Then into the TV (No longer with the DRM).... Now you are going straight to the TV.. leaving it to the TV to decode the HDMI copyright.  If the tv is old.. and I mean old... it may not have the latest HDCP (I think it's up to 2.2)... Your TV may be on 1. Or even a lower number 2. Once again all guess work.
Roku,3e0ric,jkravny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:27:34 2015 UTC,Try a different port on the tv.  Edit:sounds like your tv port dieing...my tv doing the same thing till I switch to my other hdmi port.

Roku,3dz31i,totodee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:15:44 2015 UTC,It's hard to say for sure but as a rule of thumb you should strive for the strongest signal possible. Have you tried moving the Roku around to different locations to see if you can find a sweet spot with a better signal?

Is HboGo still gonna be broadcasting in 1080p???  Yeah, sure they will.    Do they have some new and exciting tech that will preclude them from streaming the exact same bandwidth they have been sending my Roku XD/S all along to its perfectly capable of processing 1080p interface?  No they fucking don't!    Didn't you hear... Roku is gonna do 1280 or whatever now??? No i didn't and they aren't fuckin' gonna.  Did you notice all the commercials showing up on your Roku recently?  Ya' did? Excellent! Now you know why they are obsoleting the earlier models.  The earlier and EXCELLENT models can't process all the signals the new models are receiving. Guess why?  Fuck you Roku.

Too bad you will no longer be credited for providing  the accessory service fees you would have otherwise earned (or whatever agreement you had with the big guns), because I will now and forever more bypass your monetizing streams and just torrent the shit I want to watch.

If you set up a U.S. Roku account, you will see U.S. channels and be able to install them, regardless of what country your current IP address is in. However many of the channel apps check your IP address (including Amazon Prime), and even Roku does to some extent - you won't see the Movies and TV options on the main menu (powered by M-Go) outside the U.S..

This necessitated me going into each of the channels we've accumulated over the past couple years, and giving them a more thorough look over than I ever had before. I was really surprised by Viewster.  When I did that check, Viewster seemed to not be showing any commercials at all, but I said in my page that surely they were showing some somewhere (for otherwise I couldn't figure out how they were paying their own bills). Recently however, I've begun encountering commercials there. But only Roku company commercials, so far. Of minimal length. So definitely less intrusive than the commercials in many of the other free Roku channels (but even the worst commercial-laden Roku channels are rarely as bad as mainstream cable and antenna TV; YUCK!).  Viewster to me seems like a racier Netflix. That is, you're much more likely to see some nudity and simulated sex on Viewster than Netflix. To me, this is a major failing of Netflix. For grownups deserve at least a LITTLE grown up fare, that's not solely blood-soaked violence. All too often on Netflix grown ups are left to choose between something like the Powerpuff girls and the latest installment of the Expendables. Sheesh!  Anyway, besides the welcome sexier fare, Viewster inventory seems to also run the same gamut of genre TV and films as Netflix (only with different titles, of course; many of the shows on Viewster you may not have ever come across anywhere else). So in other words, you'll find a bit of everything in there."

As far as the NFL Game Pass goes, well, it seems that I have had to do a few things to get it to show up on my TV. First, I had to install Plex Media Server on my NAS ( I guess you could install it on your computer if you don't have a NAS). Once it was installed I needed to put in the NFL channel within Plex. Next step was installing the Plex channel on my Roku and having it search out my media server. Once it gets that media server, then I can just access it and watch some NFL Video on my TV. You would need to sign up for the Game Pass and put your login credentials on the server app so it will go to your Roku. Can't get an app on there because they only offer it I believe on XBOX.  For some reason though (and I haven't figured out why yet), if I don't use Game Pass for a couple weeks, it just stops working on my Roku and I need to reload it on my NAS."

It's a simple matter of giving the file the same name as the video - abc.mp4 with subtitles from abc.srt.
Roku,3cwo7e,crapusername47,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:50:17 2015 UTC,I guess remote subtitles would have been better to say.

Roku,3cr496,mitgib,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:43:55 2015 UTC,It's on wifi. Unfortunately there's no way I could run a wire to try that.

Roku,3cr496,mitgib,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:20:51 2015 UTC,"A quick search of the Roku forum says to disable updates, disconnect it from the internet, so I will translate that to no, you cannot disable updates.  Another quick/easy test is to place the unit very close to your access point.  I am doubting signal strength is the real issue myself as I keep a couple of walls and 3 rooms distance between mine.  Your best option may be to submit a ticket with Roku so they can get better diagnostics from your unit."

But look at it this way: the heat is all a byproduct of the electrical power input, and it's not a lot power. It just feels hot because of the small size of the unit. The power supply ratings are: - Roku 2 XS: 5v @ 1.5a = 7.5 watts - Roku 2 (2015): 12v @ 1a = 12 watts - Chromecast: 5v @ 800ma = 4 watts    So none of them are putting out a heck of a lot of heat in real terms."

Roku,3cfc7d,samushafer,2,Tue Jul 7 13:55:34 2015 UTC,No reason for it not to as it has the same hardware as the 3.  However some developers are not aware as the Crackle app on the new Roku 2 is not upgraded to the same that is on the 3.  I have both and all the apps are identical except Crackle.  Plex Preview is the new design as well.

Roku,3c62ce,hab136,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:30:22 2015 UTC,"Section 8. CEC of article  HDMI:       Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) is an HDMI feature designed to allow the user to command and control up-to 15 CEC-enabled devices, that are connected through HDMI,   by using only one of their remote controls (for example by controlling a television set, set-top box, and DVD player using only the remote control of the TV).  CEC also allows for individual CEC-enabled devices to command and control each other without user intervention.   It is a one-wire bidirectional serial bus that is based on the CENELEC standard AV.link protocol to perform remote control functions.  CEC wiring is mandatory, although implementation of CEC in a product is optional.  It was defined in HDMI Specification 1.0 and updated in HDMI 1.2, HDMI 1.2a and HDMI 1.3a (which added timer and audio commands to the bus).      USB to CEC adapters exist that allow a computer to control CEC-enabled devices.      Trade names for CEC are Anynet+ (Samsung), Aquos Link (Sharp), BRAVIA Link and BRAVIA Sync (Sony), HDMI-CEC (Hitachi), E-link (AOC), Kuro Link (Pioneer), INlink (Insignia), CE-Link and Regza Link (Toshiba), RIHD (Remote Interactive over HDMI) (Onkyo), RuncoLink (Runco International), SimpLink (LG), T-Link (ITT), HDAVI Control, EZ-Sync, VIERA Link (Panasonic), EasyLink (Philips), and NetCommand for HDMI (Mitsubishi).       The following is a list of the most commonly used HDMI-CEC commands:   One Touch Play allows devices to switch the TV to use it as the active source when playback starts System Standby enables users to switch multiple devices to standby mode with the press of one button Preset Transfer transfers the tuner channel setup to another TV set One Touch Record allows users to record whatever is currently being shown on the HDTV screen on a selected recording device Timer Programming allows users to use the electronic program guides (EPGs) that are built into many HDTVs and set-top-boxes to program the timer in recording devices like PVRs and DVRs System Information checks all components for bus addresses and configuration Deck Control allows a component to interrogate and control the operation (play, pause, rewind etc.), of a playback component (Blu-ray or HD DVD player or a Camcorder, etc.) Tuner Control allows a component to control the tuner of another component OSD Display uses the OSD of the TV set to display text Device Menu Control allows a component to control the menu system of another component by passing through the user interface (UI) commands Routing Control controls the switching of signal sources Remote Control Pass Through allows remote control commands to be passed through to other devices within the system Device OSD Name Transfer transfers the preferred device names to the TV set System Audio Control allows the volume of an AV receiver, integrated amplifier or preamplifier to be controlled using any remote control from a suitably equipped device(s) in the system      Relevant: HDMI Licensing | Uncompressed video | Roku | Wireless HDMI   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Roku,3c62ce,hab136,2,Sun Jul 5 05:11:13 2015 UTC,"Isn't it my Roku's responsibility to switch the input to itself when it starts playing?   There's a feature called CEC where HDMI devices can give commands to the TV (and receive commands from the TV, for example from the TV's remote) but not every HDMI device supports it (and not every TV supports it either).  The Roku doesn't support CEC.  Some TVs can also switch automatically to a new input, for example if your Chromecast wasn't displaying a signal and then suddenly started displaying one, the TV would automatically switch to it.  Likewise when there's no signal on the current HDMI port but there is on another HDMI port, it can automatically switch."

Roku,3buksc,Miya81,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:31:05 2015 UTC,"Roku signs exclusive agreements with companies that charge for services. It even agrees to sign ""exclusive"" agreements in which they delete independent and free channels serving similar material in order to maintain that exclusiveness.   Example: Roku's agreement with Dish in which they deleted 25 independent channels( know known as sling)  Here is the CEO explaining how deleting channels is about great content  Here is the roku forum in which the community finds out that if you want to put any international content on roku, you need to go through dish and Roku  Edit: Strikethroughs"
Roku,3buksc,Miya81,2,Thu Jul 2 22:25:22 2015 UTC,"Right, but still Roku does not dictate the price. Even as an indie developer (if you sign up through the Roku Developer site), you still give Roku a revenue share. You can't get everything for free."

That TOS acceptance has privacy policies that suck, it has agreements for the app and Roku and third parties to record you and your guests voices, it makes you agree to be forced to update the app and specifically prohibiting one from using older versions.  Additionally the changes to roku itself. Joint agreements with revenue generating channels. (That is an ad)  And the other things I listed.  Basically, now that cutting the cord is hip, the great day of monetization is here.  These changes aren't serving the customer, its serving their pocketbook, and I'm not super happy  Roku use to be a haven for open source projects and really down for the user. It's gone away from that in my mind.  I will edit in copies of the TOS and privacy aggreements if I can find them later today. On mobile now, so no go ATM.  That is all.

Roku,3bsprn,manitowwoc,2,Wed Jul 1 20:59:20 2015 UTC,"I contacted them a few months ago, and got this reply back:  Hi again,  In regards to your previous Roku request, I wanted to personally reach out and let you know that we have created a way for Pluto TV to be streamed to your Roku, using screen mirroring. The supported devices for casting are the Roku 3 or Roku Streaming Stick (HDMI version). You must have a supported stock Android device running 4.4.2 or higher. To see if your device is supported please visit http://support.roku.com/entries/56698214-Roku-screen-mirroring-compatible-devices for a full list. Then follow the steps listed below:   Go to Settings on your device and click on Display or Display & Lights Scroll to and tap on “Cast Screen” Your Roku should now appear in the Cast Screen section. Simply tap on your Roku name to connect.    If your Roku is not appearing, try tapping the Menu button in the top right corner of the screen and check the “Enable Wireless Display” box. If this does not work, make sure you have “Enable Screen Mirroring” on your Roku device   And if any issues persist throughout or if you have any questions regarding our other steaming services , please feel free to reach out and I will be happy to help you.  Best,  Lauren  -The Pluto TV Team  @PlutoTV  It's not ideal, as I would prefer an actual channel, and for those that don't have an android phone/tablet they are stuck. Maybe eventually....."

Roku,3bsprn,DPAmes1,2,Thu Jul 2 01:22:24 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, you're not missing anything. This is standard Miracast that they're talking about. It doesn't work on most Android platforms, and it usually doesn't work well when it works at all (e.g., the Android device has to disable its WiFi internet connection in order to cast the screen using Miracast WiFi Direct - which makes it pointless)."

It's quite likely that the Roku client uses a different stream than the web browser does and it sounds like VanishIP is not hiding your IP address when using the stream that the Roku client uses.  I don't think you need to re-install your Hulu app.

Roku,3bsdo5,DPAmes1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:45:53 2015 UTC,"That's a possible explanation given every time anyone has a problem streaming U.S. content, but never correct to date, and unlikely to be correct now.  In any case, there is no ""Canadian model"", and there hasn't been any general Roku update affecting geoblocking. I couldn't say about the Hulu+ Roku app since I access Hulu by other means, but Hulu is very aggressive about blocking known VPN gateways, and all VPNs occasionally find themselves blocked until they change gateway IPs."

After the allotted time, it is no longer yours.   Additionally - iTunes is all owned by Apple. The content is licensed for use on Apple devices.   Roku is a front end to different stores. Apple is not one of those stores. It has capability to play limited file types, but I'm ignoring that for now.   Unless Apple has an app for Roku, you're out of legal luck.

So if you want to waste $60, by all means buy NoteBurner. But know that it won't work and you'll still need to spend money on something else that will.   So I am guessing don't get that.  You will have to remove drm in some way though if you want to play it on roku.

Roku,3bmq5f,jkravny,11,Tue Jun 30 13:47:37 2015 UTC,"Netflix utilizes the new Dolby Digital Plus standard for surround sound on its videos. Your older receiver probably won't process it, toslink won't even carry it. Not sure if the Roku will reprocess the DD+ stream to standard DD via optical, if your Roku happens to be one that has optical.   It goes from the Roku to my Plasma... and then uses the Optical Audio (Toslink) to my OLD Onkyo Receiver.   I can't tell if you mean Roku->TV->Onkyo or Roku hooked up directly to Onkyo via OPtical, but if it's the former most TVs won't push anything but stereo from it's optical output that's coming into the tv via HDMI sources. This obviously wouldn't apply to Plex, seeing as the DRM is broken, but it would apply to Netflix. I used to have my Roku plugged into the TV via hdmi and then optical going to an older 5.1 receiver and the only time it would play surround audio was via Plex."
Roku,3bmq5f,timrbrady,2,Tue Jun 30 14:48:54 2015 UTC,He definitely has the same two problems I have. 1) No DD+ support on my receiver (which is understandable since it does not have HDMI) and 2) TV only outputs stereo PCM.

Roku,3bkwqu,vivnsam,2,Thu Jul 2 17:57:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah some of the feeds are direct from the source. Just depends what companies decide to make their streams publicly available. I know Global, CNN, ABC, Adult Swim, and a few others are all legit. Others come from legit channels in other countries that have the rights to re-broadcast and just never bothered to setup geo-restrictions on their feeds so we're able to pick them up in the US.  streaming is still very much a wild west technology. channel pear is ground breaking though, at least for me. i watch it every day"

Roku,3bk0qy,PicRestoration,2,Mon Jun 29 21:15:27 2015 UTC,Some private channels are definitely not updated or not stable. Malicious?  I dont know.  But I don't think you could ever brick your roku or not be able to reset it by unplugging it if it freezes.
Roku,3bk0qy,parmc,2,Tue Jun 30 03:00:56 2015 UTC,"Yes to the first question -- channels that are somewhat poorly coded or lead to an unhandled exception will kick you back to the home screen, whereas really bad errors or memory intensive apps might freeze or reboot your roku (if that happens there is a special key combination to force reboot -- I forget it though).   As to your second question, no. Roku application space is completely sandboxed and once you uninstall an app it is completely removed (even registry keys).  It is so hardened that people have not been able to gain root access yet (discounting the ssh dev mode bug)."

Roku,3bjsgg,KAJed,2,Wed Jul 1 13:54:41 2015 UTC,I'm running DD-WRT and setting up specific iptable routing and that seems to work for every device. Running all your traffic through Unblock really doesn't slow anything down in my experience.
Roku,3bjsgg,KAJed,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:01:34 2015 UTC,Mind sharing what you are using?  I haven't looked into iptables much and hand coding some of these changes is not working.  I need to read the man pages.
Roku,3bjsgg,Butiprovedthem,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:54:14 2015 UTC,I have DD WRT setup to run a few command on startup (actually it put them under firewall startup script)  iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 8.8.8.8 -j DNAT --to-destination 208.122.23.23 iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 8.8.4.4 -j DNAT --to-destination 208.122.23.22  Rerouting the two main Google DNS servers to Unblock DNS instead. Works on every device I own.
Roku,3bjsgg,Dwarkarn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:28:29 2015 UTC,"I was filtering on port 53 but that wasn't working for me on the roku stick, even though Netflix / Chromecast were both sweet. For the roku I needed to block the google DNS ip addresses completely using static routes, as unblock.us describes.   Your setup is significantly more complicated and I'm only slightly versed in network setup.   Edit: also to be safe, I reset the firmware on the roku once I couldn't ping 8.8.8.8, but that was because my account was tied to the wrong region so I started fresh."

Roku,3bkh7l,DPAmes1,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:13:31 2015 UTC,"Sure, that would work fine. You might want to try WiFi first in case it works adequately and saves you the small cost of buying a switch."

Roku,3bkh7l,crapusername47,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:51:00 2015 UTC,Yes. Just make sure you get a switch and not a router. If you have an extra router though you can set it into a bridge mode or turn off NAT and it can act as a switch
Roku,3bkh7l,crapusername47,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:43:53 2015 UTC,"It will work just fine, I do the same thing. Occasionally, some switches might have a specific port you need to plug the cable from the router in to but that's not common anymore."
Roku,3bkh7l,rextraverse,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:01:12 2015 UTC,"Is it safe to assume ""you get what you pay for"" when it comes to switches? I was always told an HDMI cable is a HDMI cable regardless of price, but I bought my dad a cheap one for his new Blu ray player and it is kinda crappy. The image snows out sometime and we have to disconnect and re-connect the cable some times.   So, I don't know how much I wan to low-ball on a switch if I choose to go that route, but I don't want to drop >$50 on a switch."
Roku,3bkh7l,tvtb,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:48:56 2015 UTC,"The first search result on Amazon US for 'gigabit switch' is a five port TP-Link model that costs $15.  It has 4.5 stars out of 5 from 2,717 reviews. TP-Link are fine and this will do the job for you.  You need a port for the connection to your router and one more for each device, so that's your Xbox and your Roku. That leaves you two more ports should you decide to add more devices.  Obviously, you'll also need an Ethernet cable for each but since they're plugging in to the switch, they don't need to be particularly long ones."
Roku,3bgmhd,stupdu,7,Mon Jun 29 01:28:21 2015 UTC,"I've had that same problem recently. Contacted Hulu customer support but they could not resolve it. Finally contacted my ISP since the issue started happening in Netflix and Sling as well. They sent a new modem and router but the problem continued and could not get them to look into it further. Finally contacted the FCC and filed a complaint. They quickly ""found the problem"" and came out to re-wire my phone lines and refunded a month's service fees.   I have noticed that the Hulu app still takes an unnecessarily long time to load the episode, but we have no issues once it starts playing. I would contact Hulu AND your ISP to let them know you are having issues.   FYI, I have a Roku Streaming Stick that's about a year old. ISP is AT&T Uverse."

Roku,3bdwqa,Chris22044,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:48:32 2015 UTC,"You have two options for a free account. 1. You can run Plex on a computer.. get the USTV now bundle and stream from that (it upscales decently)... 2. On iOS there is an app called Video and TV Cast (multiple versions.. choose the one for Roku)... it's pretty much a glorified browser which you can ""cast"" the stream to a Roku.  The free version would be fine.. the pay version gives you Roku Controls as well as the ability to bookmark, ad blocker, and change homepage. (it DOES NOT UPSCALE... so quality would be an issue.. but it would work). I have used both methods and they both work... though running the plugin in Plex gives better quality... the convenience of just doing it from my phone and not having a computer up and running usually wins)(though I usually simply use a SlingBox that I have setup and my folks place in their guest room)."

Roku,3bc79e,FlatBackFour,3,Sat Jun 27 20:58:13 2015 UTC,"Smart move on their part. But from a consumer perspective I still think it's wiser to decouple the TV from the streaming technology, and buy a set top box. If the Roku hardware fails it's much cheaper to replace the box than the TV."

Roku,3bb2ew,krackers,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:31:52 2015 UTC,"I've had Hulu for years. It isn't the free trial that bothers me it's the bombardment of advertising.

Did some googling; found many are having issues after the update. Decided to give it one more shot. Did a system restart from the system menu.

I think whatever is causing this is also stopping the YouTube app from accessing Youtube. Any idea how that could happen when everything else seems fine? Could my Roku have developed some kind of strange fault?"
Roku,3b7ksq,flyingbadgerllama,3,Fri Jun 26 16:42:51 2015 UTC,"The 2013 Roku 3-4200 had the faster processor and the WiFi-Direct remote with the headphone jack. The 2013 Roku 2-2720 had a slower processor matching the other previous-generation Rokus, but it had the same WiFi-Direct remote as the Roku 3. The 2015 Roku 3-4230 adds a microphone to the remote to support Voice Search. The 2015 Roku 2-4210 gets the same faster processor as the Roku 3, but loses the fancy remote and drops back to a plain Ir remote with no headphone jack or microphone. So there's essentially no difference between the 2015 Roku 2 and Roku 3 except for the remote. If you use a programmable Ir remote with all your devices, and you have no use for a headphone jack you can only use with the Roku, then save some money and get the Roku 2. There's a good summary table in the Wikipedia entry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roku"
Roku,3b7ksq,DPAmes1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:52:48 2015 UTC,The headphones /voice features are the only difference IMO. The speed is the same. I have both the 2 and 3. The 2 is the way to go.

The current Roku 2 comes with an IR remote whereas the Roku 3 has Wi-Fi Direct.  I've found Wi-Fi Direct to be enough of a selling point that... while maybe not worth a $30 price premium, would be worth seeing if you can still find one of the previous generation Roku 3's on clearance or refurb if the voice search isn't a big deal to you."

Roku,3b6zyf,Im_in_timeout,2,Fri Jun 26 15:45:47 2015 UTC,Have you tried a factory reset?  Is it all apps? Have you tried unplugging the headphones during these occurrences to see if the audio goes to the tv ok?  If so plugg the headphones back in to see if audio is still not sending.  It could be the receiver chip. You might consider asking ROKU to send you a new remote or replace it if they won't do it for free.
Roku,3b6zyf,jahallah,2,Fri Jun 26 16:04:36 2015 UTC,"I don't believe I've tried a factory reset.

I can try to unplug while it's happening, it usually only lasts a second so it may be tricky to time.  I have a roku 2 with a wifi remote with the headphone jack, that one doesn't get much use, I wonder if I could just swap the remotes?"

Now... with that said, a smart developer would present no sources by default and force the end user to very manually define the order of search preference.... I mean you can't even do a drop down or a select lest one service be ahead of another is the list, etc...  It's a good idea, but I have a feeling the community would have to develop it and I don't think the community would have what it takes to develop it.  My bet... good idea that will never happen."

This would give the companies an incentive to get added as it gives their products more exposure for free.  It could be set to automatically list the cheapest option in a list with different sorting options. If there's a tie then who knows. Why do certain apps get preference for the roku remote? Something behind the scenes I'd imagine."

Roku,3b3x7y,solo89,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:06:22 2015 UTC,"Well that's a great website, but there's a few issues.  1) I am talking about something on the Roku, not a website.  2) It needs to be able to view what you have access to, which is the same as all for some apps but not every app. For example if I buy something on M-Go, Vudu, Google Play video, etc, these are now things available to me but not most. This would need to link to your accounts in order to accomplish this.  Ideally it would have 2 view options, one going through what you have access to, another going through what you don't have access to but is available. For example I don't have Hulu but I can get it because I only need to pay a small subscription fee which I can from the Roku. HBO-GO on the other hand requires potentially a change in service outside of the Roku environment and is not easily available. Something like that. Or maybe make it simple, it can search all content through all installed apps, as an ""available"" setting, and then a more specific only owned content setting. Things that you can currently stream without paying any more.  Just consider there are right now a few channels you use, but imagine a future where your content is spread over 20.  What if you have Rocky on Vudu and M-Go is selling Rocky 2 for $5 cheaper? Do you pay the premium or spread them over different stores?  This would allow you to buy both at the cheapest price and keep them together through a total organizer. Just like if a bought the Rocky 1 DVD at Walmart and 2 on Amazon I could put them next to each other on the DVD shelf.  Most people probably don't compare prices, they just pick a service they like best and buy all from there. This can make it hard potentially for new stores to come in and compete. Competition is good for us, and really good for Roku.  It would also be good for Roku cause if they had this and nobody else did, it would he hard to go from Roku to another service, when all your content is all jumbled up on different channels."

Hulu is another that you may like, but we didn't. Netflix is just amazing and offers something for everybody in the family, IMO.   Then get yourself a digital antenna to get local channels. I got the $10 RCA one and I pick up around 13 channels, all crystal HD clear.   I also have a ton of movies and kids TV shows downloaded onto a 1TB portable drive, that I keep plugged into our Roku 3 in the living room, and use the Roku Media Player channel app to play them. Great for if the internet ever goes out due to storms or whatever."
Roku,3b2t7a,f0r71fy,3,Thu Jun 25 16:22:59 2015 UTC,"Here's a few of things that I have learned 2 years into cutting the cord.  Destination TV Viewing  I don't really watch mindless television like I have in the past. I've weeded out most of the shows that I was meh about. Before, I would come home, plop my lazy ass on the couch and just watch something; not for any particular reason other than because it was there and available. Now, if I watch something, it's because I want to watch it. No more channel surfing and landing on some nonsense show.  It doesn't sound like you have kids, but maybe for anyone else stumbling across this post... My kids no longer sit around and watch mindless TV either. They watch YouTube and Netflix, but it's more appointment viewing. I've noticed that since we ditched cable that they're far more likely to grab a ball, jump on their bike or skate, read a book or play games instead of sitting down to watch TV.  Cost, Obviously  At around $40 for internet only, I'm saving a significant chunk of change. 1 time charge for the 4 Rokus I had. I do spend for Netflix too, so add another $12. No more monthly rental fees for HD boxes, taxes, franchise fees, hidden fees, promotional fees, etc.  Content  Roku does a pretty good job with content. Assuming you can get a hold of a cable login (not that you would, that would be dishonest!) I've found only very rare occasions that I am unable to watch something that I want to watch. The exception is sports. Outside of ESPN Roku really hasn't done much by way of live sports. But, as a relatively techy member of, I'm assuming, the younger generation, you can pretty easily stumble into whichever event you want online, then mirror it to your Roku or just plug right in to the TV with HDMI.  Portability  I can now take my TV subscriptions with me on the go. Took the Roku to a campground just recently. Hotels. Relative's houses. You get the idea.  Also, since I'm utilizing streaming services, a lot of it is mobile too now. Netflix, Amazon Instant, FOXgo, NBC Sports Extra, History, HBOgo, etc. all have Android apps that we utilize. When I had Cable, I really had no need for those services, or, at least I didn't realize that I had a need for them."

Roku,3b2t7a,bitchkat,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:26:15 2015 UTC,"I have Sling TV, Hulu, Amazon Prime and of course Netflix. Between all of those I have almost any show I want. I honestly can't think of something I watch or want to watch that is not covered by those services. Of course, those services add up very quickly. $40 a month (including in that price Prime which has other benefits to it obviously), which is probably less than your DTV bill, especially if you're one of the many people who already has Prime and Netflix in addition to dish. If you already factor those in to your monthly costs, then Hulu and Sling are only $23 combined and almost certainly significantly less than your DTV bill. If you are really attached to your DVR and watch primarily channels that are on Sling and not any other service, this is probably not for you. If you can handle live TV, the commercials on Hulu and the selection of Netflix and Prime then you're just wasting your time with DTV."
Roku,3b2t7a,AirAdmiral,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:59:09 2015 UTC,"One more note on commercials on Sling: if there is a show I want to watch and it is on a channel that allows you to rewind and watch recently aired shows, I usually put in on with like 5 mins left and rewind to the beginning, but it lets you fast forward through commercials up to the point you ""watched"", but on live TV, that is wherever it was at when you turn the channel on. Because of this I almost never watch commercials on Sling."

Roku,3b2t7a,DPAmes1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:24:10 2015 UTC,"Help convince me that going Roku is better than DTV!   Figure out what TV shows you want to watch.  See what services offer them.  Decide how important it is that you watch them at or close to when they first air.  See what service or combination of services - OTA, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Sling - will fit your watching habits best. That should pretty easily decide it for you.  In my case, I recently cancelled DirecTV after being with them for almost 10 years because I wasn't watching anything live on DirecTV except sports.  Scripted shows I was DVR-ing ended up not being watched because I like the Netflix binge-model of watching TV so much that I'd end up waiting until the season is over before even considering starting to watch them, and then I'd rather just wait to watch the commercial free versions on Netflix rather than have to manually skip them on the DVR.  Cancelled D* and went with Netflix and (mostly because I was already a subscriber for the shipping) Amazon Prime and have had zero issues, since this was how I was pretty much watching TV when I had DirecTV.  The only catch is I've setup a Slingbox at my parents house for live sports - baseball, hockey, soccer - and it's only in SD, but I've found myself watching less and listening to the radio broadcasts a lot more.  Plus, the cost differential between $130/mo for DirecTV vs $8/mo for Netflix (I don't count Amazon because I was paying for that anyway) is just too big to go back."

The only way I have found to fix this (back to 1080) is to either quit the Youtube app and restart or to just reboot the Roku. Just hitting home does not reset the app. You might have to do this several times a week because the problem keeps recurring and has been doing for a few months.

We got a set of 4 Dr Brown's bottle for FREE on craigslist, along with a storage rack.  My son is 8, and we spend about $40 every 4-6 months on a new wardrobe because he's either outgrown things or the pants have blowouts in the knees.  Costco for wipes, Target for diapers (Target circle ones).  You most likely won't need too many 'newborn' ones.  Oh yea, for the baby showers, register for Size 2, 3, 4 diapers, same thing with some clothes.   You don't need 7 cases size 1 diapers nor massive amounts of onsies.  Diaper Champ, not the Diaper Genie.  You can basically make your own baby food when at home.  Buy a few of the jars, clean them out and refill with your own foods (about 5x cheaper).

Roku,3arh0o,The_Mad_Gasser,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:05:34 2015 UTC,"Netflix has Sesame Street, but it's a shell of it's former self. You used to be able to watch almost all of the shows, then, for a month, they disappeared and returned broken up into 7-8 groups (creativity, numbers, alphabet, etc.) consisting of around 8 episodes a piece. Personally I find it a waste of space and don't really use the PBS kids app often because it has a minor selection of episodes and clips.  YouTube is great for watching Sesame Street (for example), but some episodes have commercial breaks and some of those commercials aren't appropriate for a younger audience. It's not the fault of the uploader, it's Netflix's algorithm. I pay attention to the accounts who have commercial breaks and stay away. PBSkids has an account on YouTube, but you have to pay to watch anything. Kinda defeats the purpose for those who don't have the extra money.  8ctive has a BabyTV channel, but 8ctive recently updated their app and a lot of their channels either disappeared or changed.  As for the other kid apps on the Roku, we have them, but don't watch them often. I personally don't like Hoopla Kids b/c of the player they use, it's wiggy for us. I also can't stand Little Baby Bum (YouTube), mainly b/c the animation and that the song arrangement kinda sucks. But those are my personal qualms."

Roku,3akmpr,DPAmes1,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:19:38 2015 UTC,"BrightScipt uses ? as a shortcut for the print statement. I have never seen this before. I feel like it doesn’t make a lot of sense and might trip me up. Then again, printing to the screen/console is something that is done quite a bit. Might be nice to have a quick shortcut symbol to do it.   That right there tells me the person who wrote this is relatively young. In the various flavors of BASIC on the earlier personal computers, that was quite common.   BrightScript uses $, %, !, and # as type declaration characters.   Also common in early BASIC interpreters.  Interesting to see a bit of a throwback language. I'd be curious to learn more about the person who designed the language and learn about their background."

I have to admit that it surprises me that they did this!   Holy exclamation points, Batman!   It makes me wonder why they would go to all that trouble to make their own lanuage!? Does doing so give you a lot of benefits?   To simplify channel development for people who aren't developers? Let's not forget they also manufacture the BrightSign player too, and simplified programming is a big deal in that space.   Imagine a world where all device manufacturers decided to just invent their own programming languages. What a nightmare for us developers!   Like Objective-C on iOS, Java on Android, C on the Pebble, and C++ and C# for Xbox One and PlayStation 4.  Let's face it, any time you develop on a closed platform you're going to have to kowtow to the manufacturer's wishes. Doubly so when we're talking about an embedded platform like the Roku."

Not rokus doing scanning. The sentence is poorly worded. It should be re-written as:   These interactive ads can also be personalized using data like a user's location, obtained by IP address, as well as by tracking the content and activity of the roku connected to the network.    So not tracking the network.  Quote from the chat log:    Not really. its more like its basing the advertisement per location by looking on the IP address of your network. Technically, Roku doesnt have hardware to scan, its merely looking for network when you connect the Roku to your network.   Then my question and their answer:   Me: so when it says 'tracking information collected on devices' does it mean that the only information being collected is from the roku? not from other computers or devices?  SM - Cherie SThat is basically right, but no details will be collected even on Roku. It will just look on the location to based the advertisement to make it personalize.  ME: You can see how the report from techcrunch looks like the rokus will be data mining the network. Perhaps Roku should reach out to TC to clarify the report.  SM - Cherie SI know, Ive checked the article though its a little over the top because the idea is only to engage with the new ad format that will be able to do things like play games, take quizzes, check out your local retailers’ top products or current sales, watch extended videos related to a product, and more. Its like reading news locally.   Note: I'm not judging truth or fiction, I'm just reporting back what I was told."

Roku,3aed6d,Mister_Kurtz,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:00:41 2015 UTC,So- will this be intrusive ads that I am required to watch before I can run Netflix or Hulu? Or just the side-ad that's already there advertising some movies and shows?

Roku,3aed6d,Mister_Kurtz,2,Fri Jun 19 14:52:48 2015 UTC,"With the way networking works, the Roku device could know what devices are on your network even if it doesn't know what data is on those devices.  For example, if I remember correctly, Apple computers use MAC addresses registered to Apple so, it'd be able to tell if that computer is a Mac or a PC.  That's enough to know to try to sell you certain types of software.  It could also see the phones/tablets on the network and (try) to guess their manufacturers.  I know that Apple, HTC, and Samsung devices have registered MAC addresses and don't just use third-party chips based on the addresses I've seen when looking at my own network's packets.  Also, is everything exiting your computer fully encrypted?  If not then, since your Roku is connected to your encrypted network, it would theoretically be able to see anything that's only WEP/WPA encrypted.  I don't know if the Roku hardware is built to be able to do that though.  The problem here is that we don't know exactly what part of the dataset that a rogue device on our networks can get that the Roku will try to get.  Until we know that, the people who know what the potential dangers are will be worried.  That's a PR problem for Roku."
Roku,3aed6d,Cowicide,2,Fri Jun 19 15:01:09 2015 UTC,"Well, Innovid is an advertising company. Could they have normal tracking cookies on your PC that are tied to your IP address? Most home users are going to be NATted to a single IP with their ISP. Granted, it may not be tied to the exact user depending on how many devices you have on your network, but I wouldn't put it past them to figure out a way. They probably already have my demographics from my Roku account. Roku already uses DoubleClick which is tied to Google, and you know Google probably knows who you are.  Just food for thought...  I already have *.doubleclick.com blocked at the router level, but it can be a pain with I do a google search for something and click on the top advertised link. That first link is almost always the website I want but redirected through google and doubleclick, and blocked because of my blacklist."

I'm sure there have been a few crazy days where I've done 8+ hours without issue.  I imagine households with multiple users often put my usage levels to shame.  For a low-speed high-usage reference, my parents and sister live right by each other and share a single Internet connection.  They have 4 mbps shared between two households with 5 Rokus, 3 laptops, 3 desktops, 3 tablets, 5 phones...

Okay but   I would like to obtain content legally   With all those channels and if you really want content from all of them AND kill that $180 a month, Option 1 is the way to go.  You even said it yourself, Option 2 is not much of an option for a family.  If I were you, with cost being the biggest concern, I'd do the following:    USTVNOW free option - free, gives you broadcast networks, no dvr after a free trial, has a roku channel too  Hulu - Use bing rewards to get it the subscription service for free in a legitimate way, takes only a couple minutes of searching a day  Netflix - $8 (two streams), but consider bumping that up  Amazon Prime - already paid for  Then do ""option 1"" for everything else.  Take the cordcutting mentality that if something isn't available but-for cable, it's not worth having anyways.  That mentality will come in handy for something like Hallmark Channel especially.  Cost (other than usenet) is just your netflix sub and amazon prime sub.  Finally,   it's never clear which available channels require a cable/satellite subscription and which don't.

USTVNOW free option - free, gives you broadcast networks, no dvr after a free trial, has a roku channel too   I looked into USTVNow, and according to their website, the free plan only works on computers after the 45 day trial - if you want it on Roku after that one has to pay for either the non-DVR or DVR.  It's not a bad deal - $29 bucks, and allows 3 streams at once and covers many of the channels we would like.  Have others seen that the channel does actually work on Roku after the trial is over?   Then do ""option 1"" for everything else.   I was about 90 percent sure that this was going to be the way I would go - I have used my fair share of Usenet and have a lifetime Dog membership - but was looking for other ways.  Admittedly, there is something nice about having something to watch whenever I bloody well please and not having to hunt for the damn disk.    Most of the networks that do Roku channels require cable/sat sub, or are at most severely crippled without it. And that's what I figured was the case.

Another option I just stumbled onto is.. if you have any iOS devices there is an app called ""Video And TV Cast""... there are many versions in the App Store so grab the one for Roku.  It's free.  Go to the USTVNOW webpage from within the app... it will let you cast the video from USTVNOW to the Roku.  It won't have upscaling.. BUT you can also turn off your iDevice once the stream is started. (if you pay for the app you can add bookmarks... it will have Roku controls.. etc.) This should work with any web pages video that supports a ""mobile version"" (i.e. non flash)... so here in NYC I am able to do this with the ABC local news."

Roku,3a46yg,therealjerrystaute,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:22:14 2015 UTC,"The best free Roku TV channels lists channels offering a significant amount of TV show and film content, with no subscription required. The list does NOT include shopping channels, religious channels, games, limited time free offer channels, or channels filled mostly with amateur video efforts.  A handful of the channels are 'teasers'/samplers for big TV networks, in which some shows/episodes are locked pending evidence of you paying for their shows SOMEWHERE along the line (like via a cable sub). BUT! There's also a pretty good chunk of free content to watch in them too, sans any sub-- and usually it's the most recent episodes of shows, I think. So there's still some good value there for your zero dollars.  All these channels are legal too, so far as I am aware (most are listed in the Roku Channel Store).  This is a LOT of free TV and movies I'm talking about here. We have the paid Netflix plus OTA antenna channels here too, in addition to all these free Roku channels. But I personally almost never watch the OTA antenna channels any more.

I haven't noticed much difference in speed between my tv and roku 3 but I read that it's a a slightly slower processor.  If anything my tv feels faster to me most of the time.  Not like the stick where it's frustratingly slower and clunkier."

Roku,39wkat,HBOGOhelp,2,Mon Jun 15 17:36:16 2015 UTC,"So I did a little more research and this specifically seems to be an HBO Go problem.  I watched the opening scenes of The Judge using both my Roku and my Chromecast and it judders the frame rate on both. It also does this across multiple accounts so it isn't a carrier problem.  GOT also has this same studder, however True Detective is smooth as butter. I can't seem to figure it out.  I am starting to think this is part of the source material. When I watch GOT on my DVR captured from the live broadcast it's perfect."

Roku,39wecu,kmp11,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:39:52 2015 UTC,"Correct, no VPN support on Roku. You need to use the VPN in your router (if you have a router that supports VPN), or use a DNS service instead."
Roku,39wecu,DPAmes1,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:44:23 2015 UTC,"There's a blacklist of known VPN gateway IP addresses. Some media services are more aggressive than others about blocking them. For example Hulu is one of the most aggressive blockers (their infamous ""You are using an anonymous proxy"" message). The VPN companies keep changing gateway IP addresses to try to stay ahead of the blacklist, but the more expensive VPN companies are better at it. The cheap ones are frequently blocked."
Roku,39wecu,DPAmes1,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:47:40 2015 UTC,you are completely right. Some channel like Netflix and MLS live don't care. I get around sport black out easy enough. It is amazing the content Netflix has outside the US.

Roku,39wecu,rovaals,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:01:21 2015 UTC,"Did you block those connections or redirect them? I use static routes to change the google dns ips to my router's ip, which would then forward out to the DNS service i'm using."
Roku,39wecu,DPAmes1,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:56:52 2015 UTC,"Right idea, wrong theory of how it works. When you use a static route to direct Google DNS lookups to a gateway set to your router's IP address, you are blocking it, same as if you redirected it to a non-existent gateway. Simple test: open a command window on your computer and type ""ping 8.8.8.8"". Do you get a response? No, you get ""Destination unreachable"". You can redirect Google DNS to your own DNS of choice, but you need to use something like iptables commands with DD-WRT."
Roku,39wecu,rovaals,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:36:27 2015 UTC,"Really? I could have sworn I was able to ping it after setting it up. Is that only if you static route to an internal ip, or public ips as well? I guess I should go Google what static routes are used for if it can't do that, as that's what I thought the purpose of them was.  Edit: ok that didn't take long to find out. Looks like static routes are for forcing a path of travel? Like if it was going to hop from 1 to 2 to 3 to  get to 4 I could point it directly to 4? Am I understanding this right?"
Roku,39wecu,DPAmes1,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:28:33 2015 UTC,"That's right, you're telling the router that a particular IP address range can be reached through an alternative gateway rather than going through your regular internet gateway. It's used for example if you have a secondary LAN on another router connected to your main router, and you need to tell your main router how to get to IP addresses on the secondary LAN. But in this case you're using it to block the Google DNS addresses by setting up a static route that defines a path to nowhere. You can either use a non-existent gateway address, or use your router as the gateway address because that causes a loopback (message hit the same IP address twice, therefore destination is unreachable)."
Roku,39wecu,rovaals,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:01:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it actually makes sense to me now, I really thought it was redirecting it, like how the iptables commands work."

It takes a minimum of 45 seconds from clicking the icon to getting past the loading screen on my system (I let it clock last night and finally cancelled out after 3 minutes of the loading animation).  No other app takes more than 10 seconds, even FX Network is faster, and its a shit app as well.    As a web developer/UI designer I have no idea how this crap got past QA, or Usability/User Acceptance testing for that matter.  It is, in my professional opinion, a catastrophe on all counts, whoever let this out the door needs a talking to.    To your point, sure its easy, if you know how to interact with it.

So any deal for a 2013 Roku3 needs to be cheaper than the current roku2 to justify purchasing that vs the current r2.  Also note that the current roku2 AND the 2013 roku3 CAN do voice search via the iphone roku app (not sure about the android app)  A problem I have with the 2013 roku3, which several other people reported as well, is an inconsistent responsiveness to infrared universal remote control signals. This problem is not present in roku models I've had prior to the first generation roku3, and I'm hoping that the problem may have been quietly fixed in the most recent r3 and r2.    One can hope. And I feel that the chances are better of getting that dealt with via this year's r3 and r2 than with earlier generation r3's  Pete"

I have an older computer and I would never be able to watch 2 videos at the same time. Also the app automatically adds the cover art of your videos and TV shows.

I originally bought an Amazon Fire stick as there were a lot of complaint about the stick regarding slow boot times and laggy operation. The Fire stick lacked a few important apps so I bought a Roku stick anyway, and even though it's noticeably a little slower than my 2013 Roku 3 and the Amazon stick, it's still perfectly serviceable, especially just for a bedroom TV.  I would hazard a guess that they bumped the spec of the stick from the 2013 model but it's still not quite as fast as the new Roku 2/3."

I was doing the files on a drive at the device, but there are 4 rokus in my house, so not practical. I now have all my files on a cheep laptop, they stream great. the only issues I have had are small. The laptop runs quite hot. I had to lift it off the shelf on small rubber feet to help it cool down. Might be better if it was wired to the router instead of streaming wirelessly. once in a while I get loading issues, a few seconds of seeing the loading screen, not to bad, but it does happen. This would also probably be fixed by having it wired to the router. Good luck!"

Surface Pro 3 - running Windows 8.1 - is usually on the coffee table about eight ft away, connected to WiFi. You connect using the wireless project mode under ""devices"". It's worked from a little further away, 10-12ft, but the desktop computer, over 30ft away, also running Windows and wireless internet (because I'm lazy), didn't see the roku when I tried a few months ago. Like I said though, the connection has been significantly better recently."
Roku,392s45,DeleDelito,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:21:03 2015 UTC,"So no apps? Just by using the ""devices"" option in your surface? Do you know if it would work with Android or with your PC if it would be closer?"
Roku,392s45,terpichor,2,Tue Jun 9 12:40:05 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it'd work with the pc if closer, it runs the same os as the Surface. And nope, the roku itself has a beta feature that's not app-related, it'll broadcast and be picked up sort of like you'd connect to a Bluetooth device (just over your internet connection).  I've gotten it to sort of work on my android, there are some YouTube tutorials, but it'll be somewhere in your device sharing settings.  There are also apps that can screen mirror, but from what I've read they don't seem to be any more functional than what roku is already doing, and most cost money.   If you really want to easily screencast and have some disposable income, you might consider getting chromecast, I've heard the casting works really well from a lot of devices. If you have a media library you want to play on your tv, I'd recommend plex or even a direct tv hookup."

That takes the video and audio stream and puts them into a new container (mp4 or mkv instead of AVI) without converting the streams. It's quicker and no quality loss. It might not work for all of them and it takes a bit more understanding of the technical aspect of video files (what codecs are okay to remux) but it can save a lot of time.

Roku,38flcm,firstsnowfall,2,Wed Jun 3 21:58:26 2015 UTC,not what i wanted to hear.. after extensive research i just ordered a C7 yesterday... hope its something besides the router!
Roku,38flcm,Duck_It44,2,Thu Jun 4 00:14:44 2015 UTC,"Wow! I just tried a suggestion to change ""current hardware NAT status"" to off on the Archer. Now it works fine! I tried before to change both NAT settings to off but then I had no internet at all through all my devices, so I thought this option was broken. I also tried setting the Roku as DMZ host which didn't do anything. But with just the  'currnet hardware NAT status' off setting, I am currently able to stream perfectly. I guess that was the fix. I just streamed 2 movies with no issues. I can also see from my server that the bandwidth use with Plex is much more efficient now requiring less upload from my server than before.Before when it was still 'working' (not getting slow speeds), my server would constantly be streaming at top speed. But now my server only streams periodically, like on and off, and does not reach as high speeds. Success!    I guess the Roku wasn't able to get through the router's NAT? I wonder if it's an issue with TP link firmware or Roku firmware. Anyway, now you know what setting to change when you get your Archer"
Roku,38flcm,Duck_It44,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:19:50 2015 UTC,Good to hear.. Any experience flashing it with aftermarket firmware? Thought about doing that when I get it
Roku,38flcm,Simius,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:03:17 2015 UTC,Did you disable uPnP per chance?   I wonder by deselecting that it just uses software based NAT now?
Roku,38flcm,Duck_It44,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:23:00 2015 UTC,No idea. I ended up returning it and got an Airport Extreme instead. No issues out of the box

Roku,38flcm,chriszerocool,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:01:06 2015 UTC,Yeah that's why i got the router too. It's the best reviewed AC router that's under $100. I really wish it worked for me. Hope your experience is different.
Roku,38flcm,chriszerocool,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:22:01 2015 UTC,"out of curiosity how do you measure your speed on the roku?  Edit: i see theres a speedtest channel, is that what you use?"
Roku,38flcm,chriszerocool,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:43:19 2015 UTC,Yes that's it. I also have a remote plex server so i can monitor the outgoing bandwidth from my server.
Roku,38flcm,Clemalammadingdong,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:53:25 2015 UTC,Is all your gear gigabit? Double check the cables. They need to be gig spec'd as well.
Roku,38flcm,Clemalammadingdong,2,Thu Jun 4 00:50:50 2015 UTC,"The cable has nothing to do with it. I of course tried different cables, and I tried an old router which worked fine using the same cable. Cat5 cables can handle gigabit speed just fine, but I'm not nearing 100mbit speed at all, let alone gigabit speed"
Roku,38flcm,JimmaDaRustla,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:52:28 2015 UTC,"Cat5 cables do 100Mbps, cat5e/cat6 for gig speeds. The 100Mb is theoretical. If there was no interference and everything was made of gold in a vacuum it could maybe do 100Mbps. Real world speeds are way lower, a third-ish maybe... So I'm just looking for your bottle neck and it looks like there could be a 100Mbps connection somewhere in the mix. That would make sense if the roku had wireless ac with the speeds you said you were getting."
Roku,38flcm,HolyMackerelBatman,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:13:51 2015 UTC,"I meant cat5e. Cat5 cables are not really used anymore. Haven't seen one in a long time. Anyway, there's no bottle neck. It's some sort of software glitch either with the router (likely) or Roku (unlikely). I have no other devices connected at the time, and the issue is very reproducible. All I do is plug in the ethernet and immediately the speed drops from 25mbit to 5mbit (plex) and the speedtest app goes from 60mbit to 15mbit. Which is another strange thing that the speedtest app goes faster than plex. I have a PS4 that's also connected to the router through ethernet and that one gets good speeds, so it's only the Roku. Also, using my local plex server I see the Roku pulling in about 12MB/s. The issue is WAN speed not LAN speed. It's really weird."
Roku,38flcm,HolyMackerelBatman,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:21:22 2015 UTC,What speed test app?
Roku,38flcm,HolyMackerelBatman,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:37:59 2015 UTC,There's a speedtest channel for Roku
Roku,38flcm,HolyMackerelBatman,2,Thu Jun 4 01:53:10 2015 UTC,Fixed the issue by changing 'current hardware NAT status' to off. Woohoo
Roku,38lvl6,tecnone,11,Fri Jun 5 01:46:38 2015 UTC,"Meh. When the FireTV launched there was a troll on this sub doling out Doom and Gloom and how Roku is totally doomed because of reasons similar to this, they're all kind of bs though:   Channel overload isn't a thing, I care for about 10 minutes when I set it up, then I never have to care. Actually, when I got my new Roku 3 it knew what channels I was subbed to and just set them up. I don't have to care about the hundreds of church channels.  Competition - Has always been there and will continue to be there. Every company in the world deals with this, including Roku's competitors.  Stagnant hardware  - doesn't matter. The Roku's UI is snappy and performant. The FireTV for being so much more powerful is slower, buggier, and the apps are out of date. The Nexus Player was already obsolete the day it was launched. The Shield TV (which I just got) is finally the first Android-derived device that isn't a slow POS, and it's like ~$130 more expensive. It is a great machine, but the platform is new, we'll see where that goes.  Smarter consumers - Benefits Roku. Smart consumers know that between Amazon and Google, the Roku is the only one guaranteed to be able to play content from all those services and third party services. Amazon doesn't publish Prime Video for Android TV, and when it does in certain cases (like for Sony TV's), they will publish a rev to actively block their existing customers from using that app on unapproved devices.  You can't get Google Play Movies and TV on FireTV either. Roku is the only one where you get everything.    There's plenty of things to not-like about the Roku, but it's still the only device I recommend to people who want to watch things and not be experts on doing this sort of thing. Android TV might be that (someday), but that launch has been horrendous until last Friday with the Shield's launch, and even then there are problems, they only just updated their store to show Android TV apps today, after the platform has been live for the past 6+ months. And considering how buggy the FireTV still is, over a year since its launch, this article makes no sense to me.    Source: I have all the devices mentioned in the article and can't understand how the author came to these conclusions. If anything, it's amazing to me that Roku can deliver what they do against multiple multiple-billion dollar companies."
Roku,38lvl6,whiprush,5,Fri Jun 5 02:31:33 2015 UTC,"Eww. This list is just... why?  Channel overload is debunked this way. Android and iOS are the same way. Many apps on the their stores are garbage. Does this make people go to something like Windows Phone? Obviously not. Same with Windows.  Competition: Makes sense, but doesn't mean a demise. Yes, you'll have people flock to the others, but not in droves like depicted.  Stagnant hardware: they are saying the next Roku should have ""more cores"" (more btw, then most computers). They fail to realize that more cores and higher numbers don't mean squat. Going back to smartphones, there are phones that still have dual core CPUs and are perfectly fine (look at the specs of an iPhone 6 and look how speedy it is)  Smarter consumers: First off, that makes me question if these guys really love there Roku, or if they're just fanboying over the other stuff. The way I see it, if you are heavily invested into Amazon's ecosystem, you're going to get a Fire TV. Same with Apple and same with Google (minus Chromecast). Some would argue gaming as a positive for the other devices, but if you really want to play smartphone games on a TV, get a cable for your phone that plugs in to your TV. Otherwise, get a proper game console."

Roku,38axja,Jagxyz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:55:30 2015 UTC,"found a user who claimed to be selling the service but was also offering a trial demo service.  I can pm you the thread with the info if you are interested or you can just search for it by searching ""machtv"" .  I'm not sure if I'm going to pay him though since he is just a random ass dude on the internet.  Might seek a more reliable method of transaction if I follow through.  HD quality wasn't really a concern for me but I felt that I was viewing quite a few channels in HD.  My only real complaint was that it is built for spanish viewers (though nearly everything is translated in english - also features spanish channels (MTV esp, FOX esp, etc.) and a very small hiccup in some of the streams (hardly a bother).  I was pretty satisfied with the channels offered.  I'd have to guess 150 - 200 channels total.  I was trying to think of channels that I'd be missing but couldn't as I scrolled through the list.  Lots of channels I wouldn't watch either though (foreign & bloated foreign sports).  Maybe comedy central?  I don't think I saw that one.  I understand that wowTV is geared more towards english customers and might offer additional english channels I may have forgotten about.  I'd be curious to see a comparison of channels but a list is so hard to find for any of these services.    as for safety and reliability, I saw a comment regarding this:   Most of the better and more stable options have been taken down lately. Technically your [the providers of this service] making money off streaming content you don't own so you [they] can get in a ton of legal troubles with it. Every once in a while youll see a new version of this pop up and will last 6-12 months before it becomes unmaintained and useless or gets taken down fully. I'd probably pay the per month price otherwise it could get shut down 2 months into your year long sub and they don't have to refund you."
Roku,38axja,Jagxyz,2,Wed Jun 3 04:15:13 2015 UTC,Here's a list of channels for wowTV  http://www.wowtv-live.com/#!channels/cuvh  It's pretty accurate.

I wouldn't dare give anyone a bank account number or anything, but if they want a CC number, I'll just get a reloadable pre-paid card and load it up every month.

Tubi is free, a lot like Crackle but with a better interface and decent selection of movies. Has ads tho.  If you do want to spend $16/mo, Netflix and Hulu Plus should be enough to keep you entertained.  Animal Planet Live is another channel I 'zone out' to from time to time, watching cows helps me sleep.  DieselPunk Industries is a good one if your into Film Noir type stuff, no ads, good selection of old crime dramas.  Movie Vault has a one time fee of like $5 to access it's library, mostly public domain stuff, but no ads and a pretty big selection.  Pandora for free music streams.

Any ideals?"
Roku,383u2g,Country_Runner,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:43:37 2015 UTC,"Well sublight used to be great for that but now it costs to use, though it's not that expensive, and could do batch files. That was the best one in my opinion could select language and everything. Filebot can do it, not sure if it can do more than one file at once though. And with both of them there is no guarantee you will find subs just for foreign language parts. There might be better options but these are the ones I know.  *Edit Podnapisi lets you filter by foreign language parts only. Unfortunately one at a time.

Last I checked, HBO and Netflix and their content providers feed their kids quite well and then some."
Roku,37ojzv,KingSnot1972,0,Mon Jun 8 00:00:29 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people complain about seeing commercials. It's the same if you have cable/fios. Network tv costs a lot of money to make (right or wrong). Your 8 dollars a month helps pay for hulu's infrastructure to bring you the content, but those expensive shows still need paid for which a big chunk comes from advertising.  It's exactly the same as any other delivery format for network television."
Roku,37ojzv,KingSnot1972,1 point,Fri May 29 11:43:44 2015 UTC,"I get your point, but have to disagree with:   It's the same if you have cable/fios.   I DVR everything I watch and can FF the ads. The best I can do on Hulu Plus is hit ""mute"" and stare at the screen until the ads are done displaying."
Roku,37ojzv,SharksFan4Lifee,2,Fri May 29 19:03:14 2015 UTC,"You can fast forward because of 3rd party companies ""inventions"". That's not the way it was for 60 years before that. Also, networks are losing a lot of money because of DVR's.. and because of that they are having to literally put way more product placement within the actual shows now to make up for it.  Once again, tv shows cost millions of dollars to make... SOMEONE has to pay for it. Lucky the consumers have to pay basically by watching commercials."
Roku,37ojzv,excoriator,1 point,Fri May 29 19:41:34 2015 UTC,"I DVR everything I watch and can FF the ad   That's why Hulu ( a joint venture between three broadcast TV networks that make money on ads) exists.  It was formed in 2007, before cordcutting was a thing.  The big thing in 07 was that DVRs became a thing in everyone's household, and the networks were pissed."
Roku,37ojzv,Krescan,-1,Sat May 30 04:26:32 2015 UTC,"Clearly you get it. New programming is the most expensive programming and Hulu Plus carries shows the day after they air! This notion of ""there should be no commercials on a service I'm paying to stream"" is unrealistic. Hulu Plus's fee doesn't cover the total cost of the programming it streams, so there have to be commercials in the service, too."
Roku,37ojzv,relrobber,1 point,Fri May 29 13:42:56 2015 UTC,"good point, the ""I'm paying for it"" doesn't work if we were ""paying for it"" it would be about what cable costs  Plus (and probably in the minority on this one) I don't mind two ads every once in a while it's not a 4 minute break or anything (unless you're watching an NBC show) I kind of enjoy seeing a commercial from time to time."
Roku,37ojzv,excoriator,0,Fri May 29 14:41:35 2015 UTC,"If I get cable, the cable fees go to the cable company and the ads go to the networks. With Hulu, the networks get fees AND ad revenue.  Most would probably be willing to pay higher fees and have no ads."
Roku,37ojzv,Joegotbored,1 point,Fri May 29 17:47:22 2015 UTC,"Most would probably be willing to pay higher fees and have no ads.   I figure Hulu has done the market research and they know that a streaming service that costs more than $10/month is a non-starter. I've seen people on reddit cite that figure all the time when discussing how much they'd be willing to pay for streaming HBO, before that was an option. Surely, your idealized, commercial-free Hulu subscription would break that $10/month barrier."
Roku,37ojzv,flargenhargen,1 point,Fri May 29 18:01:12 2015 UTC,"I watch hulu mainly in chrome, and it is the worst at streaming. Even if you give it time to buffer it will frequently freeze while playing.  I think Hulu just sucks."
Roku,37ojzv,ottoorange,1 point,Fri May 29 19:17:14 2015 UTC,"I always liked how the commercials come in quick and clean as can be, but the content sucked."
Roku,37ojzv,PersonOfDisinterest,1 point,Fri May 29 22:47:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the input! We're moving soon and will be upgrading our internet speed at the new place (damn salesperson knew my weakness). My wife swears that H+ works just fine on her tablet so who knows. If it's still subpar afterwards we'll likely be canceling it and moving on - to what I'm not sure. I'm more of a Netflix guy but my wife likes her shows ""soon"" so that'll be another topic later.   As far as the other conversation that has started, I don't really mind the commercials but if I'm going to have to sit and watch them, I need more variety.   Thanks again for the comments - even the quasi Konami code!"
Roku,37ojzv,skevimc,1 point,Sat May 30 01:57:23 2015 UTC,I love Atchison hulu plus every day.  Almost all my viewing is on plus...not an issue yet.
Roku,37o6rb,rbarton812,1 point,Fri May 29 02:18:31 2015 UTC,"I tried that once and it seems roku does not support all audio codecs so I was able to watch the movie but not to listen to it, the perfectly solution for me has been the Asus media player, just plug your HDD into it and it support most video formats even 3d sbs"
Roku,37o6rb,AlcuReddit,1 point,Fri May 29 02:43:24 2015 UTC,"If you're encoding the media from scratch, Handbrake works just fine for producing audio/video that Roku Media Player can play back using the default encode settings - Media Player supports MKV and MP4 formats using H.264 video and AAC audio. It should be able to read AC3, but I've not tried that as I don't have an AVR connected to any of my TV's. The UI for Media Player is pretty terrible from a usability standpoint, especially if you have a lot of media - it doesn't have any kind of search and uses a very basic layout. Beyond about 20-30 files in a given directory, it's pretty painful to use since it only shows 3-4 items on screen at a time. I've never used plex, so I can't comment there (could never figure out how to get it to work - my NAS has a built in plex server, but even though all my media is on it, I gave up trying to figure out how to configure it after a couple of hours of frustration)."
Roku,37o6rb,rsun,1 point,Fri May 29 15:01:27 2015 UTC,"Have a Roku 3? Simple- plug the hard drive with all your stored media files on it to your Roku via the USB slot on the side. Then download the Roku Media Player channel and you're good to go, as long as your media files are in the proper format. If you need to convert any files, use Handbrake. Free and easy to use.  I used to use MyMedia, and tried Plex, but prefer this direct, non-streaming method overall (we use a WD Passport 1TB). We use it for tons of movies and shows. Even the kids know how to navigate it. It's as easy as using Netflix, pretty much."
Roku,37o6rb,Chreeeees,0,Fri May 29 15:55:38 2015 UTC,"My experience was that the interface was terrible, it had no real ability to search or organize and it had all kinds of performance and compatibility issues. One of the key advantages Plex offers is the transcoding of your streams using the host machine so the Plex app doesn't have to know how to work with every format out there. The other advantage is that it organizes and seeks the metadata for your library. That sounds like something you can live without till you're using the Roku remote to scroll through a couple hundred movies in a folder with daffy filenames. The only way I'd even consider plugging a HDD full of movies to the Roku directly would be as a temporary measure until I could get a Plex server set up. It is absolutely worth it. That being said, it's been like 2 years since I've tried and they may have pushed out software updates that have improved it. But probably not much."
Roku,37o7aq,SupaZT,3,Fri May 29 02:23:12 2015 UTC,Wireless or wired?  Verizon gateway or purchased?  Cat5 or cat5e or çat6?  More details pls.   Edit. What does your network look like?  1 PC?  11 wireless devices?  Need the whole story
Roku,37o7aq,PollutionZero,3,Fri May 29 02:48:54 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Speedtest from Roku, not from a computer.  Rokus are a bit temperamental with WiFi, so it's important to test the actual connection from the device rather than from a PC."
Roku,37o7aq,daface,1 point,Fri May 29 02:52:26 2015 UTC,"Its not the roku, its wireless tech. I just put in a POR AP and stream at 1080 no problem.   Also depends on channel overlaps, frequency, etc...    There's a reason your network guy at work has a job. That shit is complex."
Roku,37o7aq,PollutionZero,1 point,Fri May 29 02:56:51 2015 UTC,it's wireless..  just 2 PC's
Roku,37o7aq,joethehoe27,1 point,Fri May 29 04:17:33 2015 UTC,Is the roku and pcs on the same wireless frequency? (2.4ghz vs 5ghz)
Roku,37o7aq,Im_in_timeout,0,Sun May 31 02:29:52 2015 UTC,Run a network cable to the Roku and see if performance improves.
Roku,37o7aq,bcramer0515,2,Fri May 29 15:12:38 2015 UTC,"It's almost always a problem with your wireless router. In my case, I had an older router that I had used for years but it never had to stream large content before.  So I finally bit the bullet and bought a good router (Netgear Nighthawk AC1900) and have never had a problem since."
Roku,37o7aq,speeder1989,1 point,Fri May 29 12:20:24 2015 UTC,The 3 is still doing this? I was thinking of plugging it back in but I'll just keep using my chromecast which is also temperamental but seems to work better?  I don't know anymore
Roku,37o7aq,anonymau5,1 point,Fri May 29 03:11:56 2015 UTC,I find it very odd your upload higher then your download...for households it's download higher but alot of businesses are opposite.  Edit:Suggest getting your own router after the gateway...if you have a gaming console you may have NAT issues however.
