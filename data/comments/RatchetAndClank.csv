RatchetAndClank,3e74rs,TheMisterAce,1 point,Wed Jul 22 16:10:09 2015 UTC,I've heard there is a few graphic and sound bugs with deadlocked/Gladiator. Except that I don't think there are any major problems.
RatchetAndClank,3e74rs,TallCowsFly,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:02:24 2015 UTC,yeah I'm not too worried about bugs I'm asking about optimization. Such as fps and input lag. Also deadlocked is for the ps2. Was pretty good but I prefer the original three games.

RatchetAndClank,3e06w2,Trijhak,6,Mon Jul 20 23:09:33 2015 UTC,"Best gold weapon has to be the Devastator. It's the only one that really makes the weapon function better instead of just being a damage increase. Honourable mentions to the Blaster for getting bouncy bullets, and the Suck Cannon for getting more ammo.  The best hacking device for me is the Trespasser. It's the only one I actually enjoyed doing, and it doesn't take forever. The electrolyzer and hacker are frustrating because they take a long time and it's more of a minigame than a puzzle. The Infiltrator is quite good, but not as good as the Trespasser   Can't decide which Insomniac museum is best. Probably UYA, but I can't even remember the ACiT one  Hoverboard. Way more fun. The hoverbike was disappointing in comparison"
RatchetAndClank,3e06w2,KingGumboot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:56:01 2015 UTC,"You should have included the hacking minigames from Size Matters and Secret Agent Clank.  I remember enjoying the Omni-Key from Agent Clank quite a bit, so that would probably be my choice.  Or the Trespasser.  It was the original, and it focused more on thinking and experimentation than quick reactions and memorization like the later ones.  Favourite golden weapon would have to be the Blaster.  It may not be the strongest of the golden weapons, but when it came to eliminating groups of enemies the bouncing bullets were so fun to have.  Plus it did a fair amount of boss damage at that point too.  Hoverboard for sure.  Hoverboarding had a distinct handling and feel to it, while hoverbikes felt more generic and slippery.  Plus you can do tricks on the hoverbike for extra boost, which gives you a bit more to play around with on the race track.  They are both a bit of fun to play but I think the hoverboard is the better Ratchet racing minigame for me.  As for Insomniac Museum, Going Commando.  It really was a first of it's kind attraction to include in a video game like this and it blew my mind when I first visited it.  UYA had a great one too and I remember enjoying the contents of both probably equally, but the uniqueness and surprise that visiting the first one had pushes it over the edge."
RatchetAndClank,3e06w2,Spino-Prime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:16:58 2015 UTC,"The best gold weapon for me is the Testla Claw. I use it frequently, and it's quiet effective at killing everything. I also like the gold Devastator.  The trespasser, but not by a lot. The hacking puzzles got boring very quickly playing through the games over again. I also liked the electrolyzer puzzles because they required precise timing, and the infiltrator ones for being counter-intuitive. The hacker puzzles were the worst.  I liked the two more or less equally, but I'll give it to the hoverboard. The two were great in their own rights."

Best gold weapon... Devastator or Blaster. To be honest I can't even remember what the Gold versions of the Pyrocitor, Bomb Glove, Glove of Doom, and Mine Glove even do for them other than make them gold and make their effects green for some reason.  Best hacking device... I'll be honest, I personally hate the hacking minigames. They're just tedious.  Best Insomniac Museum.. GC!   I prefer Hoverbikes to Hoverboards. I find Hoverbike races easier and I actually know the shortcuts in the hoverbike races. I've always struggled with the Kalebo III hoverboard race."
RatchetAndClank,3dvom4,ArnoldSwarzepussy,11,Sun Jul 19 22:34:48 2015 UTC,"The new music on Gaspar doesn't fit the level at all. I hope Bross changes it.  David Bergeaud is a better composer in my opinion, his tracks are just more memorable and catchy."
RatchetAndClank,3dvom4,1CJB,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:12:58 2015 UTC,I gotta disagree to tell the truth. I think it fits perfectly with the level since both the planet and the music have a more funky feel to them. The planet itself was a real outlandish looking volcano planet and the music was equally quirky and is actually one of my favorites from the first game.
RatchetAndClank,3dvom4,1CJB,2,Mon Jul 20 17:58:32 2015 UTC,"The music sounds like something from a computer level at first, reminds me of Tron. I don't like it, and I'm worried now that the soundtrack wont be very good."

In that case I agree entirely. It sounds kinda generic and way too ""computery"" like you said. The sound tracks in general haven't been good since ToD, and even then it had gone through a dry spell before ToD came out. The first two were fantastic, but then UYA was pretty OK, deadlocked was forgettable, and I can't even remember any music out of SM short of Pokitaru's theme, which was nice."

RatchetAndClank,3dvom4,IamAnthonological,2,Mon Jul 20 18:00:45 2015 UTC,"Seeing as how it's a reimagining and what not, I think it's okay. If you want to listen to the music from the original, play the original."

I'm not quite sure what it is about them, they're just cool and very satisfying to hit and kill. I can't really think of many other standout good enemies, they're just all good in general  The missile launcher things in UYA are definitely one of the worst. Especially when you first play those missions and you don't know where they are, then suddenly you're getting blown to bits and can't avoid it. I wouldn't say the Yetis are a bad enemy, it's just the fact that there are so many of them and they don't stop coming. The Protopets are annoying for similar reasons; you miss one and suddenly the whole room is full of them again."

RatchetAndClank,3ds0hp,Trijhak,2,Sun Jul 19 04:51:16 2015 UTC,Their pre-attack animation is too short. It doesn't go on long enough to give the player adequate time to react and as a result; the player doesn't really get enough time to react and they end up attacking faster than they should.

RatchetAndClank,3dafi8,Trijhak,5,Tue Jul 14 19:22:30 2015 UTC,"Nice polls. I'll share a few of my answers just for discussion's sake:  Best arena: Easily Annihilation Nation. Having just one arena with more battles unlocking later in the game was better than having two separate ones, and the obstacle courses are great. Plenty of creative rounds too, like switching weapons, sleeping gas, having the turret in the middle etc. Glad to see most other voters agree :D  Collect-a-thon area: Hard choice, I think I'll go with the original one, Tabora. Grelbin was annoying, the sewers were good but being confined in pipes got annoying and getting lost was easy. An honorable mention to Sargasso in TOD for changing up the way it works, I liked that planet but it should have been a bit bigger  Gold bolts: Upgraded versions of weapons. Easy choice.   Raritanium: Ehh, I'm split between weapons or ship. If gold bolts are going to be used for weapon stuff then raritanium should probably be for the ship.  Melee weapon: Scorpion flail, no competition :D the Razor Claws were very cool, but not really that useful"
RatchetAndClank,3dafi8,KingGumboot,3,Tue Jul 14 23:01:54 2015 UTC,"Grelbin was annoying is the understatement of the year, IMO. Grelbin wasn't annoying, it was tedious and unfun with almost infinitely spawning enemies that could kill in only a few hits.   Just my opinion on Grelbin.  Also the Scorpion Flail, definitely agree. That thing is way more useful and more powerful than any other melee weapons. The Plasma Whip was pathetically weak and that baffles considering it was available at the start of UYA, the Shock Ravager was similar but compared to the other stuff you could get at the same time it wasn't really that viable, and the Razor Claws... awesome, but impractical."

Tabora had the best collect-a-thon area, and Greblin was a freaking nightmare when I was younger.  Weapon mods  Ship upgrades.  Quack-o-Ray had flying demon ducks. I pick that one.  Best shotgun? They all played similar, and I liked each one more or less the same.   Dual Vipers were the best pistol based weapons.   The Bouncer. Nuff said.  The Minirocket Tube was the best rocket launcher. It locked on and shot faster than any other, and the impact/effect just felt more powerful.  The Chopper from GC was better than the Disk Blade Gun, but not by a whole lot. It just felt better to throw them.  The Scorpion Flail by far. It was fun and easy to move around and smash up shit, it controlled better than the Plasma Whip, and it did some real damage.  The RYNO 2 felt really good to use, the sound and impact each shot had felt powerful, and it certainly was."

RatchetAndClank,3d91wr,1CJB,10,Tue Jul 14 13:24:25 2015 UTC,"Nice? Yeah. Mature? No, watch the movie trailer, he completely fails a pilot exam like a moron, or in the recent gameplay, he seems super reliant on Qwark, he doesn't really show a whole lot of maturity.  I think what they seem to be going for with this game is that Ratchet starts out super naive and doesn't know what he's getting into. As the story progresses, there'll be a lot of room for him to develop more realistic emotions and character traits once he sees how the world really works, and later, once he learns what being a hero is really all about.  I think this is really going to be an interesting movie and game, I just hope they don't throw away all these great opportunities to make it the best thing that's ever happened to the series."
RatchetAndClank,3d91wr,IamAnthonological,6,Tue Jul 14 16:04:40 2015 UTC,"A lot of people disliked Ratchet's dickish personality in the first game when it came out, but I enjoyed how it subverted the typical ""can do no bad"" 3D platformer protagonist."
RatchetAndClank,3d91wr,tigranater,3,Tue Jul 14 19:17:25 2015 UTC,"I think they're making him the naive hero wannabe. He legit wants to save the universe, but he has a fanboy admiration for Captain Quark. It sounds more like Clank's arch in R&C 1.  I agree with you, but I don't want to get too cynical about the movie. If they're reimagining Ratchet's personality a bit, fine.  I just hope we get some sense of Ratchet and Clank majorly disagree, maybe Ratchet's focus on revenge, and some of Ratchet's ""Hey lets go to this planet just so we can get the cool stuff."" What I liked about Ratchet is that he didn't have this whole ""I've always wanted to be a Galactic Ranger"" thing, he just wanted to get off of his planet, get cool stuff, and maybe be ""Captain Ratchet."" So I hope, even if we don't see him go on a revenge fulled quest against Quark, that we see him more excited about the cool guns he's getting rather than the actual mission."

RatchetAndClank,3d91wr,PowerForward,2,Tue Jul 14 20:50:58 2015 UTC,"Here's a good example of Ratchet's character progression, these parts I liked in particular.  Ratchet: Now this guy's gonna blow up an entire planet? That's just mean!  Clank: That's what I've been telling you.  Ratchet: Look, I'm still gunning for Qwark, but if we end up taking out Drek  too, heh, fine!  Later...  Ratchet: Umm...  Clank: Yes, I know, it is worse than I expected too.  Ratchet: Look, maybe you were right. This is a lot bigger than you or me. I   was really selfish focusing on Qwark.  Clank: It is not too late to stop Drek.  Ratchet: (starts to lighten up) Hey, yeah! We got this new ship! Let's go get him!  Clank: Now you are talking!

The Ratchet in the original game just doesn't fit with how he turned out in the subsequent games, I feel. The re-imagining is lining that up a little bit.

RatchetAndClank,3d6ade,Echowhisker,9,Mon Jul 13 21:22:53 2015 UTC,I kinda just wish he (along with most other things in the series) were a little fleshed out. I wished they gave him a little more time to show why he was evil or even interactions with Ratchet's family since he lived among the Lombaxes. The loss of so much story from the Future trilogy is what really irritates me about the remake.
RatchetAndClank,3d6ade,Ciocana,4,Tue Jul 14 01:41:34 2015 UTC,"I also think it's about character consistency. With the villains in the other games  Drek was obscenely rich, greedy, and had the capabilities to raise an army and damn good reason (he thinks) to kill ratchet and clank  In the second game, Qwark overtook fizwidget to regain his fame, Angela was the thief to stop the protopet from becoming a galaxy wide threat, and they both had the means to do what they wanted.   In the third, Nefarious is a robot super villain. He just is. I'm genuinely okay with this.   In Deadlocked, Vox is pretty much the same as Drek but in a different scheme. He has the funds for minions and battle courses. All the exterminators have motivation for fame and money. Again, checks out.   In ToD, Tachyon is... an angry crag mite. How did he get the resources to buy an army? Did he tell them about bringing back a dead race and they were just like ""Yeah okay checks out"". I'm baffled as to HOW he actually managed to rise to power. He didn't climb a corporate ladder, he didn't take people down to rise to power, he wasn't a super villain (considering he was raised by lombaxes), so how the hell did he do that? It just doesn't make any sense. I can only suspend my disbelief for so long"
RatchetAndClank,3d6ade,ggop_,3,Tue Jul 14 16:15:34 2015 UTC,"A Crack in Time actually provides an explanation for how Tachyon gained his army.  He never told anyone about his desire to bring the Cragmites back. He went to the lombaxes and proposed designs for a mechanical army that would be capable of protecting the galaxy. When the lombaxes finished building this army, he stole control of those forces and drove the lombaxes out of the universe. He essentially double-crossed an entire race."
RatchetAndClank,3d6ade,IncredibleMeh,3,Tue Jul 14 18:59:02 2015 UTC,"Son of a gun, you were right. Maybe if he acted less petty and had less of a napoleon complex, he'd have made a more fleshed out villain. You don't go outsmart and outmaneuver an entire race but still act like a petulant child. THAT'S the part that kills him as a character. He could have really been built up as a morally destitute kingpin to be feared, like drek, but instead we got an annoying ass guy who's half antagonist and half slapstick comedic relief."

RatchetAndClank,3d6ade,IncredibleMeh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:15:06 2015 UTC,"I remember Tachyon's boss fight being pretty damn tough by Ratchet & Clank's standard's even with the RYNO. Hell, saying that a boss fight is easy with the RYNO isn't much of a complaint since almost every boss in the Ratchet & Clank series is capable of being killed within a very short period of time with those weapons.  As for his character, while it could have been fleshed out a bit I find it as a great allegory to real-world villainy. People who are spoiled, and use whatever power they have to ruin other's lives because of deranged beliefs of betrayal or superiority. Tachyon tragically believed the Lombaxes to be his species' betrayers, and manipulated his way into power so he could exile and entire civilization. All because of he couldn't bear to believe that the race he belonged to was truly villainous."
RatchetAndClank,3d6ade,IncredibleMeh,0,Tue Jul 14 02:49:24 2015 UTC,It makes it easier because you can actually get the ryno before fighting him the first time. and Nefarious hardly took damage from the ryno.
RatchetAndClank,3d6ade,IncredibleMeh,0,Tue Jul 14 03:28:43 2015 UTC,"You could just not fight him with the RYNO. The weapon is literally stated in it's description to be game breaking, what else was there to expect but an easy boss fight?"
RatchetAndClank,3d6ade,IncredibleMeh,0,Tue Jul 14 04:05:22 2015 UTC,"Still, First game, you probably wouldn't have the ryno before drek. Second game too. you couldn't in the third game. same with deadlocked. from there you could due to holoplans. And... ""You could just not fight him with the RYNO."" Why in the world would you not use the ryno if you have it?"
RatchetAndClank,3d6ade,IncredibleMeh,2,Tue Jul 14 05:59:56 2015 UTC,"Because you want to maintain the integrity of the original bossfight and beat it without using what is essentially a cheat, so that you don't wind up poorly judging the fight based on an inaccurate experience years later? Just because you have the RYNO doesn't mean you have to use it, almost every veteran R&C fan by now should understand that it's effectively 'easy mode' in gun form.  A new player isn't even likely to find it on their first run anyway. The parts are well hidden and by the time they have access to them they'll be close to fighting the final boss."

RatchetAndClank,3d33ay,Raikaru13,2,Mon Jul 13 03:25:02 2015 UTC,Figured since the NG+ run of this was recently posted here that the other categories should get some love.  The goal of this run is to collect all 40 gold bolts as fast as possible starting from a fresh file.  Bonus: Any% . This run is like All Gold Bolts and starts from a fresh file but ignores the gold bolts and skips two planets while collecting as little as possible to continue.  Youtube versions:  All Gold Bolts  Any%
RatchetAndClank,3cyeas,Trijhak,14,Sat Jul 11 22:17:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe not skill point, but trophy from the first game ""Get 1,000,000 bolts"" was ridiculous. Had to use the infinite bolts cheat just to save time."
RatchetAndClank,3cyeas,ggop_,6,Sat Jul 11 23:20:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed! I finished the whole game and collected everything with only slightly more than 500,000 (I think). The fastest way that I found was to return to the section where you play as giant Clank and run back and forth between the start and finish and kill the 3 enemies that spawn at the end every time. Boy did that get old quickly!    Thankfully they made bolts more plentiful in later versions! :)"
RatchetAndClank,3cyeas,InfantStomper,5,Sun Jul 12 00:02:24 2015 UTC,"Holy shit yes. I wanted to do it without glitching through the outside area.   I got every trophy and skill point and everything. I wasn't even close to 1m. Like,  less than 200k. I calculated it and I'd have to replay the whole game 30+ times to get it. Fuck that time sink."
RatchetAndClank,3cyeas,DryZebra,3,Sun Jul 12 01:36:24 2015 UTC,"This is easily the worst one even though it's not a skill point. Purchasing every single item in the game only costs somewhere around 550,000 bolts IIRC, which leaves another 450,000 to collect for the trophy. It's ridiculous"

RatchetAndClank,3cyeas,tigranater,6,Sun Jul 12 12:33:32 2015 UTC,"Most of the ones for shooting down ships are annoying. They're not difficult but some of them take a while and potentially waste a bunch of ammo, like the one on Hoven in R&C1.  Also, any wrench-only ones. Killing bosses like the Alien Queen and Chainblade isn't so bad, but ones like killing 10 blargian troopers on Veldin or completing Joba with only the wrench...those are annoying.  There are a few specific other ones I could mention like Shattered Glass from R&C1, but I can't be bothered going through all the skill points in every game :P  Edit: One more thing. TOD. Every enemy with the Groovitron. Fuck what an annoyance that was. An entire separate playthrough for one damn skillpoint."
RatchetAndClank,3cyeas,KingGumboot,2,Sun Jul 12 01:58:00 2015 UTC,"Oh god, fuck that Groovitron skill point. Especially when it comes to enemies that you only see in one level and can't go back to and you forget to use the groovitron... and god forbid if you miss out on using it on the bosses."
RatchetAndClank,3cyeas,KingGumboot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:00:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was a pain in the ass. I did it after I'd done absolutely everything else, I started the next challenge mode playthrough and just ran through the entire game tossing Groovitrons, only killing things where it was necessary. Luckily I got it a few levels before the end of the game (from memory the first Cragmite was where I got it) so that saved me a bit of time"
RatchetAndClank,3cyeas,stevemcblark,3,Sun Jul 12 02:17:54 2015 UTC,"Stuff that are up there for me:  From GC: Be a Moon Child: Collect every moon crystal or whatever they're called on Grelbin. Fuck that, it's just so goddamn annoying and tedious. The other one was decent, this one? Like torture.  Also from GC: Old Skool, to use only R&C1 weapons on Dobbo. So long, so tedious.  From ITN: Vandal: Destroy every breakable window on Silox. Fuck this because it's so finicky as to which windows are breakable and they don't even render until you're close to them.   Also from ITN, the various Clank skill points. Ugh.  From ACiT: Flawless: Complete Overkill without taking any hits. (it's the really long one at the end of the Raritanium tournament.)  Also from ACiT: No Respect for the Dead: destroy every destroyable spaceship in the space graveyard. It's so finicky as to whether it even registers or not.   Again from ACiT: Master Blaster, keeping Qwark's blaster in the hot state in the MBRH minigame. I hate that minigame with a passion because it's just so unfun and tedious.   And from UYA: all of the Awark vid-comic time-based skill points because FUCK TIME BASED THINGS."
RatchetAndClank,3cyeas,steviecash,2,Sun Jul 12 02:09:38 2015 UTC,"And not to mention that if you're playing on PS3, Old Skool doesn't always register even if you did it right. I would have platinumed that damn game if it weren't for that."
RatchetAndClank,3cyeas,handsupdb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:39:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm having trouble with Vandal.  Apparently I missed one window and now I have to finish the game just to get another shot, since some areas become inaccessible."

RatchetAndClank,3cyeas,Spino-Prime,2,Sun Jul 12 02:19:26 2015 UTC,Beating the B2 Brawler without taking any damage. I think that was a skill point. Once the thing sits down and starts spinning I could not avoid getting hit at least once.
RatchetAndClank,3cyeas,steviecash,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:38:05 2015 UTC,"Strafe away from it, don't try jumping over the legs because that will lead to you getting hit, and use the most powerful weapon you have in combination with Kilonoids."

Vita doesn't have L2 and R2, so they mapped that to the two halves of the back touchpad.  Getting the back touchpad to trigger as L2 or R2 is finicky at best, getting a super precise trick going like the Twisty McMarx is an absolute nightmare."
RatchetAndClank,3cyeas,Otsell6008,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:10:12 2015 UTC,For me one of the hardest was the skill point where you had to go  through Planet Joba without using weapons.  Another one that I'm currently stuck on is the skill point on Planet Silox in Into the Nexus where you have to destroy all the windows.
RatchetAndClank,3cieiq,CategoryIV,21,Wed Jul 8 03:44:42 2015 UTC,"This is a really poor question, because in truth a good Ratchet & Clank game absolutely has to have both in order to stand on par with the series as we know it.

RatchetAndClank,3cieiq,NeoLightJak,2,Wed Jul 8 07:06:27 2015 UTC,"I find myself enjoying gameplay the most. Ratchet for me is the best shooter platformer out there. The fluid movement and crazy arsenal of weapons/gadgets make it really fun to go through and level everything.   I've never played the PS3 Ratchet games other than FFA. I think it's a good spin off game, but it lacks the smooth framerate and fluid animations that were present in the PS2 titles."

RatchetAndClank,3cieiq,LX_Theo,2,Wed Jul 8 10:52:20 2015 UTC,"Deadlocked, FFA, and A41 are absolutely my least favorite. Getting 100% on them felt repetitive and drove me crazy.   The thing that brings me back is the non-linear linear level design. I know there's an enemy behind this door, but how I chose to go about attacking him is up to me. In FFA, and deadlocked, it's just running the same direction and doing the same ""events"" over and over. The goals are arbitrary instead of intriguing and fun.   The characters matter less to me. I mean, r&c 2 had Angela, 3 had the starship Phoenix crew, sure Al makes a ton of reappearance, but overall the characters mean very little to me.   I do like the direction the story has gone, finding out about Ratchets life, moving from single game arcs to giant multi game background stories."

RatchetAndClank,3cb3rm,Echowhisker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:02:16 2015 UTC,"Yea, I'm doing a quick playthrough of Up Your Arsenal again, and I've just unlocked this weapon. It was very helpful on Planet Daxx and I must say it is one of my favorite rocket launcher-type weapons."
RatchetAndClank,3cb3rm,SgtTamama,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:46:06 2015 UTC,"It just became so irrelevant as the game progressed. It didn't kill enemies as effectively as the plasma coil and it didn't deal as much damage as the bouncer. Lastly, I think that the design was too clean for a rocket launcher; the devastator and mini rocket tube both had  more memorable designs than the devastator and relevance to the game. Matter of fact, GC just had better weapons. Damn, synthenoids, mini nuke, blitz gun, nothing compares to the weapons from that game."
RatchetAndClank,3cb3rm,ggop_,3,Mon Jul 6 21:00:42 2015 UTC,"Blitz Gun, even upgraded, becomes near-useless by Snivelak. Synthenoids are extremely weak when not upgraded in Kilonoids, and are relatively expensive at the time they first become available. Furthermore, V4 Agents of Doom/Agents of Dread are functionally more or less identical to the Synthenoids, same with the Nitro Launcher/Nitro Eruptor and Gravity Bomb/Mini-Nuke. I'm not even going to start on the fact that the Blitz Gun and Mini-Nuke are not particularly unique...  On the Annihilator, of course it doesn't deal as much damage as the Bouncer and Plasma Coil??? In UYA both of those are become available in* the last few planets. I'm not sure why you were expecting a weapon from the *very end of the first third of the game to be as powerful as weapons that become available near the end of the game.   Which also means there's a sizeable chunk of levels between when you can first get them. Even then, the Annihilator is still admirably powerful at end-game if upgraded. It's definitely no lancer.   It by no means becomes irrelevant. Not by a long shot. If you want something that becomes irrelevant late on in a R&C game, then you're looking for the Lancer or the Blitz Gun.   Also, wtf do you mean by 'relevance to the game'? All weapons are relevant to the games because they're in them."

Dude, look, if you think someone responding you is getting 'pissed' in a thread specifically for discussion then you've missed the point of the thread.

RatchetAndClank,3c2p6k,Blakey001,4,Sat Jul 4 07:37:24 2015 UTC,I heavily enjoyed Infamous Second Son. It's a beautiful looking game and the game play is pretty addictive. You can probably find it used for pretty cheap too!   EDIT: oops I didn't realize you were asking if there are any Ratchet and Clank games you can play on the PS4...
RatchetAndClank,3c2p6k,wevegotheadsonsticks,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:05:11 2015 UTC,If you mean R&C games then no. But there are several great games on the ps4. The Witcher 3 is awesome and a great time sync. Destiny is fun if you can find a few friends to play the end game content with (Which is relatively easy to do). Both those game will be kind of expensive though. If you get PS+ there is a fun arcade game coming out for free right away here called Rocket League. You could also play through Infamous: Second Son as I imagine it would be pretty cheap seeing as it was a release title.

RatchetAndClank,3byngl,Axeltheking,3,Fri Jul 3 06:24:25 2015 UTC,Not to mention the quality of A4O and FFA for those who did get them likely left bitter tastes in some people's mouths.
RatchetAndClank,3byngl,Trijhak,15,Fri Jul 3 12:39:34 2015 UTC,"Considering the last proper full-length R&C game was ACiT and that was six years ago now, no shit the sales stalled, genius. There hasn't really been anything to grab the attention of non-R&C fans for a long time."
RatchetAndClank,3byngl,Trijhak,7,Fri Jul 3 12:42:36 2015 UTC,"It does make sense to wait and release it alongside the movie, but it's annoying that it means there is almost a whole year between development finishing and us getting to play the game"
RatchetAndClank,3byngl,KingGumboot,2,Fri Jul 3 07:17:00 2015 UTC,The wait hurts! That said if E3 impressions are anything to go by then it seems like it will be worth it
RatchetAndClank,3byngl,IZ3820,3,Fri Jul 3 07:40:51 2015 UTC,"As long as they continue to finesse the product until release, I'm okay with this."
RatchetAndClank,3byngl,Michael_Lane,10,Fri Jul 3 17:04:53 2015 UTC,"""A representative of Australian retailer EB Games who attended E3 – has confirmed that while at the June event, the topic of the game’s development timeline was brought up, where those manning the game declared that the game was 100% complete.""  So an anonymous source without evidence?   Throw this under the, ""my dad worked at nintendo"" pile.   Truth be told they did say the game was mostly done and ready to ship for this year, so any and all remaining time is just for further polish."
RatchetAndClank,3byngl,TheEndlessObsession,3,Fri Jul 3 06:39:53 2015 UTC,"I read that headline wrong. I thought they'd canned the game because the sales stalled.   It's not a surprise sales stalled though, we had an R&C every year for a good number of years, and some of them weren't even that great. Quality over quantity would be a better approach."
RatchetAndClank,3byngl,Minihood1997,2,Fri Jul 3 11:44:33 2015 UTC,"Well, I want the game to do well so that they make more. If that means waiting till the film to play the game, so be it.  Besides as long as they're not just sitting on their arses and are actually taking the extra time they've been given to polish this game till I can see my childhood in it, it's worth it."
RatchetAndClank,3byngl,celebritarianalex,2,Fri Jul 3 07:02:18 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I wonder what Insomniac are working on now then? I live the setting, style, and themes of the R:FOM, and would love to see it get the same treatment as R&C1 has... pipe dream perhaps?   Anyway, there's always an argument for further polish, but to my knowledge a completed game just sitting there is unprecedented - Insomniac have multiple studios now, they could tack on multiplayer or a co-op mode I guess. If it has indeed completed development (others below have indicated a less than reliable source), then I'm expecting a very polished game on launch."
RatchetAndClank,3byngl,handsupdb,2,Fri Jul 3 13:44:29 2015 UTC,"No shit the sales have stalled.  You stopped making actual R&C games and made shit like A4O and FFA. While they're fun they're not real R&C games.  Think about it, if Nexus came out two years earlier and was as big as ACiT the game would still be doing fine. I waited to get FFA&A4O in the EB Games bargian bin explicitly because I didn't think they were real games."
RatchetAndClank,3byngl,IamAnthonological,3,Fri Jul 3 14:28:38 2015 UTC,"The game is not finished at all, maybe you can play from the beginning to the end of every level, but there are lots of processes to go through before the game can be sold in all regions, and there's a lot of time to be spent on polishing and making adjustments to the in-game assets. Not to mention that huge bug-list they must still be working through.  Anyone who thinks this is 100% complete and they're just hiding it from us knows nothing about game development and game publishing."
RatchetAndClank,3byngl,johnmichaelhowe,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:15:27 2015 UTC,"Very interesting! I think that Spring is going to be a new popular release windows for Games. Holiday is just so jam packed nowadays, it's difficult to grab the spotlight against the juggernauts. Heck even Tomb Raider is coming out the same day as Fallout 4 - I can imagine that is going to be detrimental to TR's sales even though it's one of the most recognisable game franchises out there.  Looking at this year, I've noticed from many journalists that Dying Light probably wouldn't have sold half as much if it hadn't been held back for the Spring (when there's a little bit of a games drought).  So yes, we know that both the game and the film are finished - so I don't blame Sony for not wanting to get it rushed out the door. I'd like to see this franchise continue for a long time (as long as the games stay good!) so let's hope sales increase :)"

RatchetAndClank,3byngl,SgtTamama,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:42:48 2015 UTC,"Well, it has been over two years since any Ratchet and Clank game has been released, which was Into the Nexus.

RatchetAndClank,3bwpoa,handsupdb,11,Thu Jul 2 22:25:54 2015 UTC,I think Going Commando really is the best game in the series. Everything about that game was and is amazing. Especially the music. Talk about the best video game soundtrack ever. Tabora is the best.
RatchetAndClank,3bwpoa,McDubbadoo,2,Fri Jul 3 04:19:34 2015 UTC,Oh my god i've never met someone that agrees with me on this! Other favourites are the Maktar Arena theme and Todano.

Again, the atmosphere and pure beauty on the song is what gets me. I also think the song was sampled in a car commercial back in 2006-8, but cannot remember the exact year. I just remember hearing it and getting mad that they ripped of R&C. Lol"
RatchetAndClank,3bwpoa,GeneralChaz9,9,Sat Jul 11 15:20:58 2015 UTC,"Old: Humor, unflanderized characters, music, sound effects, cutscenes, creativity and number of weapons, memorable planets, better enemies, expressiveness of characters, arena challenges.

RatchetAndClank,3bwpoa,Michael_Lane,5,Fri Jul 3 06:43:11 2015 UTC,"Old>New: The older games are somewhat less linear than the newer ones. I've been replaying R&C1 and GC recently and very rarely there's a planet with only one path on it.  The planets that do have one path tend to be ones with a boss at the end -Umbris, Gemlik Base, Veldin, Siberius, Snivelak, Yeedil. Planets in games after UYA rarely had more than one path.  Old>New: Arena challenges. In ACiT and ITN, the arena challenges are disappointingly linear in terms of how you do them. Compared to the arenas in GC and UYA, where you could choose from a number of challenges without having to do the 'next one' in the 'tournament', this felt better as it meant that if you got stuck on an arena challenge or something, you could always come back to it later and do another challenge. They were also harder, IIRC?  Old>New: Music. Pretty much everyone agrees on this. Getting rid of David Bergeaud was one of the worst things Insomniac ever did for R&C. Who can remember any tracks from ACiT or beyond? Yet everyone can remember the Metropolis track.  Old>New: How Gold/Platinum Bolts are used, for the most part. R&C1 and GC made them matter by using them for Gold Weapons or Weapon Mods, respectively, unlike UYA through ACiT, where they were used for skins that in the end don't really matter that much.  Old>New: Bolt economy. Disregarding exploits, the bolt economy is much less forgiving than it is the newer games, especially in R&C1. Ammunition costed a lot, especially the ammunition of the Visibomb and Devastator, so it gave you an incentive to conserve ammunition where you could. Plus, you couldn't buy every weapon as soon as they appeared. You had to think about what you wanted to purchase.  Also, more than one weapon becoming available at once. (I know ITN did this, but it's short...) Most present in GC, where the Pulse Rifle and Miniturret Glove become available at the same time on Endako, the Lava Gun and Bouncer become available at the same time on Tabora, and the Spiderbot Glove and Plasma Coil become available at the same time on Joba. (In retrospect, GC throws you a lot of weapons very quickly...)  Old>New: Specifically R&C1 here, but giving you a reason to use weapons all the way through. In GC/UYA/any R&C game with Weapon XP you don't really have a reason to use them when they become fully upgraded, and sometimes they'll be laughably weak before the middle of the game even comes. When you do use a fully upgraded weapon, you're missing out on weapon XP that could go towards another weapon. If you rely on a fully upgraded weapon too much, well... you'll barely upgrade your other weapons.  New>Old: Gameplay. It's a lot easier moving and shooting in the newer games than it is in the older games. Ratchet in R&C1 moves quite slowly compared to Ratchet in... any other game, really.   New>Old: Ever since ACiT, we have no more annoying minigame puzzles! Goodbye Electrolyzer, Infiltrator, Trespasser, Hacker, and whatever the one in ToD was called. They were always frustrating IMO.   New>Old: Clank gameplay. Clank gameplay in the first three games is novel at first but it becomes boring fast, and given how short the Clank sections in R&C2 and 3 were it seems like Insomniac realised this to some extent. Clank gameplay in ACiT and ITN is a bit more puzzle-oriented, with ACiT having some excellent Clank gameplay. I like those puzzles a heck of a lot more than I liked the 'hacking minigame puzzles' of the originals + ToD.   New>Old: Weapon 'Modification' System - the Raritanium based system of ToD and ITN. I feel like this has a lot of potential considering how it can affect weapons - I think it could be the solution to weapons that become obsolete halfway through the game by making them more powerful not only through XP, but through raritanium as well. Plus, if you ever felt a weapon had too little ammunition, now you can at leas attempt to give it some more.   Old>New: With the way things seem to be going, weapon creativity. The Combustor, Groovitron, and Mr Zurkon all originated in ToD which was eight years ago, yet they seem to be making an appearance in the reboot? Yet Insomniac could create at least 13 new weapons (R&C1: 15 unique weapons, R&C2: 19 unique weapons, R&C3: 13 unique weapons) per game in the originals, and then a further 10 in Deadlocked, and then a further 15 in ToD, and then about 12 more when you don't take the returning ToD weapons into account in ACiT? Either they've lost a spark or they're trying too hard to make a non-Wrench weapon a staple of the series.  New>Old: Space. All Insomniac needs to do to perfect space gameplay is take ACiT's space gameplay and merge it with GC's, so that the space areas in ACiT have a third dimension to them. Seems they're getting close."
RatchetAndClank,3bwpoa,johnmichaelhowe,3,Fri Jul 3 13:46:04 2015 UTC,You're music comment is so on point. The series lost it's spark since David's departure. Music is a powerful tool!

I guess a lore book would be nice, I just think the lore is explained nicely in the games and it'd be worth it to get a better look at what the games are like behind the scenes."

Then I contacted an online poster printing place, they had a minimum run of AUD$40, so I had 2 prints done on a nice semi-gloss stock.  3 days later and it's hanging in my bedroom just behind my gaming heads statue :D.

RatchetAndClank,3binu3,p0tat0323,2,Tue Jul 7 00:52:33 2015 UTC,"Let's go out of the box for a second and look away from the R&C games. Assuming you can play PS2 games, you might like to try Jak & Daxter: The Precursor Legacy or Okami for collectibles. If you're looking for something a bit more hidden, Vexx is similar in many ways to Ratchet & Clank and Super Mario 64, but without a driven story. Scaler is a game with a terrible story but interesting gameplay, though not a collectathon and not particularly challenging.  Moving back in time, Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie are exactly what you want. Hilarity-filled collectathons with an oddball cast. By extension, Donkey Kong 64 and Conker's Bad Fur Day are also great games, but each for different reasons.   Moving further back, the Donkey Kong Country games are challenging platformers with plenty of collectibles, innovative gameplay elements introduced throughout, and a style that's aged like good cheese.  Moving forward, into the future, awaits the crowdfunded Yooka-Laylee, a platformer collectathon by many of the devs who worked on the Banjo-Kazooie series.  I'm sure it goes without saying, but the Spyro the Dragon games are some of the best platformers available in the Playstation Store, and Psychonauts, if you're up for a thicket of story, offers a great platforming experience. Toy Story 2 for Playstation and Nintendo 64 was a satisfying platformer with plenty of things to collect and accomplish."
RatchetAndClank,3binu3,IZ3820,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:53:46 2015 UTC,"In order, in case you decide to do so (though I understand that doesn't seem likely):  Tools of Destruction > QFB, if you haven't yet played it > A Crack in Time  You can skip Q-Force/Full Frontal Assault if you dislike A4O, since it's somewhat similar. Its tower defense/MOBAness doesn't really mix with the R&C formula that well IMO and this leads to it feeling extremely frustrating at times. Plus it's very short. Skip it, it and A4O seem to be considered pretty shit by most to put it bluntly.   However, ignoring the stuff above, A Crack in Time has a lot of stuff to do. It has a ton of side content and it's one of the games in the series where the platforming shines thanks to the optional content. There's a wide variety of gameplay, probably the widest in the series - puzzles, the shooting, the platforming, the space gameplay, and it has the most collectables of the entire series and IMO ACiT has an ingenious system of handling three weapon types that I'm sad to see has yet to be revisited. It'll last you a while since it has so much to do... it's a lot of people's favourite (on the PS3, anyway) for a reason. I consider it to be one of the most fun R&C games in the entire series as well."

RatchetAndClank,3bfzln,Trijhak,5,Sun Jun 28 22:01:49 2015 UTC,Awesome poll! Unsurprising results too lol.  Would have been interesting to see how the results would change if you could pick a maximum of two choices as well.
RatchetAndClank,3bfzln,tigranater,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:02:02 2015 UTC,I'm upset that you grouped 1 2 and 3 together for the clank gameplay
RatchetAndClank,3bfzln,tryinthisout123,4,Tue Jun 30 02:45:46 2015 UTC,"...Because the Clank gameplay is more or less the exact same through all three games? I know ToD was similar as well though, but it wasn't until ACiT came along that we finally got Clank gameplay that was on par with with other kinds of gameplay. Commanding things is novel at first, but it gets old quickly.   If we're talking about the small variations, like the hammerbots and bridgebots in GC and the Skrunch-banana stuff in UYA, then  I generally don't consider that enough of a variation to make it a different 'type' of clank gameplay."
RatchetAndClank,3bfzln,tryinthisout123,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:53:18 2015 UTC,Not really. They're have enough differences to justify not being grouped like that.
RatchetAndClank,3bfzln,DJC13,2,Tue Jun 30 15:35:56 2015 UTC,"I disagree: they're not different types. Different variations in the same way the games have different variations of Ratchet gameplay, sure, but different types? Heck no."

RatchetAndClank,3be4st,RezicG,15,Sun Jun 28 10:53:05 2015 UTC,"2 is my favourite, because of the cool planets, and the space combat sections, and it had the best weapons (Bouncer, synthonoids, plasma coil, shield charger, Clank zapper)"
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,JangoF76,3,Sun Jun 28 11:39:33 2015 UTC,"Clank zapper is a terrible weapon, to think I forked out 1,000,000 bolts for something that sounded amazing but turned out to be slightly more effective rather than using nothing at all."
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,MeInDevelopment,2,Sun Jun 28 14:16:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah it wasn't the most powerful, but it was cool, especially in conjunction with the upgraded tesla barrier."
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,JangoF76,2,Sun Jun 28 14:43:11 2015 UTC,Fully upgraded Tesla barrier was a must for me. Took care of the stupid one hitters while I focused on more important things.
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,hey-im-grumpette,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:47:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, the Clank Zapper was overpriced and an absolute letdown. It seemed to be thrown in as an afterthought; it consumed ammunition every time you selected it regardless of whether the last one was still going or not, and there was no indication when you needed to select it again because it had run out"
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,KingGumboot,11,Wed Jul 1 08:21:23 2015 UTC,"1st was the first ever game I ever got, so it will always have a special place in my heart, also it was the hardest which makes it fun, but 3rd is the most complex and has the most stuff to do which probably makes it my favorite.  Going Commando was good game too, but I didn't play that as much and then I sold it away and now I miss that game, because I never got all the skill points/platinum bolts, which makes me want to play that game again."
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,Sipuli69,9,Sun Jun 28 11:21:38 2015 UTC,"Mine was Up Your Arsenal. I loved Dr. Nefarious and Lawrence, they were hilarious."
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,RavenKiller83,3,Sun Jun 28 12:46:34 2015 UTC,"Not to mention playing online, that game was my introduction to online gaming, and while it may be the nostalgia filter, it's still easily one of my favorites."
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,IGrammarGood,3,Sun Jun 28 19:37:53 2015 UTC,"I never got to play it online! Did everything else though. Completed it 100 percent, had the max amount of bolts and everything lol"
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,RavenKiller83,2,Sun Jun 28 19:47:42 2015 UTC,"I replayed Up Your Arsenal more than any other action game. New game plus mode helped that out. I feel it also has the best weapons. The Shock Cannon is probably one of my favorite guns in any game. Firing that thing as a kid aroused my tiny acorn wiener.  Edit: Okay, I guess in the HD edition (just continued my playthrough of it) the gun effects are really subdued in that version for the shock cannon."
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,jakerfv,8,Mon Jun 29 12:11:43 2015 UTC,Going Commando. I played it 113X with the challenge mode. My favorite game in general though is Deadlocked cuz of the weapons.
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,prototypeplayer,2,Sun Jun 28 17:22:11 2015 UTC,Damn.. Please don't tell me it's + 1x each restart. That would have taken a long time!
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,prototypeplayer,5,Sun Jun 28 17:26:29 2015 UTC,It is haha I realllllly loved that game xD
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,handsupdb,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:29:54 2015 UTC,"I hope he means 13X, 113X is a really long time but not undoable.  Yeah it's once per challenge mode. They get really really really fast once you've got all weapons upgraded to ultra, all nano and have done things a few times."
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,KingGumboot,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:40:07 2015 UTC,"Jesus, how many bolts did you have after playing that many times? You must have come fairly close to exceeding the maximum and rolling around into negative bolts, like RSmit did. Not sure how many playthroughs it took him to do it"
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,prototypeplayer,2,Wed Jul 1 08:27:52 2015 UTC,"I played the original trilogy A LOT....I also played the hell out of the Jak and Faster games too. My twin bro played the Sly Cooper and God of War games, so we had the PlayStation classics covered haha"
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,AllesAlex,6,Wed Jul 1 11:20:24 2015 UTC,"The second one, Going Commando."
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,Huwage,4,Sun Jun 28 12:29:26 2015 UTC,"3 (Up Your Arsenal if you're across the pond). First one I ever played, so it's got a special place in my heart. Best upgrade system, some of the coolest weapons, great story, best villains, best arena combat... Just fantastic. Currently playing it through for what must be at least the 15th time."
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,shadyelf,4,Sun Jun 28 17:04:45 2015 UTC,It's hard to decide between 2 and 3. Probably 3.
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,TheWellets,3,Sun Jun 28 18:25:40 2015 UTC,"Definitly GC. It had everything, space fights, grinds, all of that. Honestly if UYA had those as well, then that game would be my favorite. But it didn't, so that award goes to Going Commando"
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,JMS230,3,Sun Jun 28 14:51:01 2015 UTC,"Up Your Arsenal, and then Going Commando is a VERY close second. I just loved everything about UYA."
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,CPL_McMuffen,3,Sun Jun 28 16:07:00 2015 UTC,"Going Commando is my favorite R&C, the RYNO II will forever be my favorite weapon."
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,handsupdb,6,Sun Jun 28 18:46:29 2015 UTC,"GC is the best game ever made. Plain and simple.  Disagree and I will destroy you... As long as you're ok with that.  Honestly though, everything from stuff like Allgon City planet Damosel (anyone else get it?), Angela, the weapons, the space combat, the story its just so awesome."
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,IanGPark,3,Sun Jun 28 13:18:31 2015 UTC,I totally agree with you on this.
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,IanGPark,2,Sun Jun 28 16:26:33 2015 UTC,"2 for me. It had everything. Tons of levels, all designed brilliantly with great art direction, Atmospheric music worthy of it's own album, hilarious dialogue and generally funny characters, coolest weapons and armour. Favourite game of all time!"
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,tnt6656,2,Sun Jun 28 16:25:45 2015 UTC,Ironically going commando even though its the only one i haven't finished
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,Minihood1997,2,Sun Jun 28 16:59:30 2015 UTC,"For ages I agreed with OP. But after recently replaying the original, I've come to appreciate it more.  I think the extra challenge and sense of achievement upon completing levels, buying weapons, 100%ing it without a money glitch, make it just that bit more special.  And the fact that you can have a favourite combination of weapons that lasts the whole game, while still being encouraged to try out new weapons. You don't have to worry about leveling up the weapons that don't work with your playstyle."
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,DJCouttyboy123,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:11:51 2015 UTC,"Ratchet & Clank 2 edges past 3 for me. It was just more interesting and had better planets and locations. I also preferred the idea of the 2 of them working solo most of the time, instead of being stuck with Qwark. Even though R&C3 had better weapons, Nefarious, the battle scenarios which were kind of fun too and of course, Secret Agent Clank, I still think 2 was better.  It had so much more like Hoverbike races, Space battles, the Glider, the Levitator, the Therminator etc. which made levels more creative. The platinum bolts were more well hidden, and of course, it had no Qwark vid-comics!"
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,Raikaru13,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:08:31 2015 UTC,"The first game is and always will be my favorite. I've played it countless times and still play it to this day. The fact it can be beaten with the wrench only is amazing to me, i havent done that challenge yet because of Drek, but beating it with the bomb glove and pyrocitor fills me with joy. Not to mention the speed at which this difficult game can be played is quite surprising."
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,johnmichaelhowe,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:07:53 2015 UTC,"Number 3 and Deadlocked. I really liked the idea that you have a team behind you (Starship Phoenix/Rangers + Team Dark Star) and that you return to such teams base between missions. The story for both of these games interested me the most also.  Lastly, I really enjoyed how different Deadlocked was to the rest of the series."
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,Echowhisker,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:32:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the reason I don't like 3 as much is the interface. I mean, whose idea was it to replace the nanotech meter with a number? ""X/X"" doesn't stand out as much as ""[X] [X] [X] [ ] [ ] [ ]"" and I constantly find myself dying because it's hard to keep track of how much health I have left.."
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,Plokster52,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:48:14 2015 UTC,The first one. It was the first Video Game I EVER played in my life. Two teenagers were babysitting me when I was like 5 and they brought a PS2 and let me play it. So much fun. That's why the R&C series is my favorite of all time.
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,Padawelts,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:58:25 2015 UTC,"Up Your Arsenal was definitely my favorite. It took a bunch of small nitpicks I had in the first two games and fixed them (e.i; max ammo button in the vendor). I also found Nefarious to be really memorable like an old style cartoon character. That, and the planets had really strong themes, which I'm a sucker for."
RatchetAndClank,3be4st,SgtTamama,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:42:10 2015 UTC,Going Commando is #1
RatchetAndClank,3b88gx,Echowhisker,9,Fri Jun 26 19:32:51 2015 UTC,"I love Clank. His design is simple, yet memorable. His gameplay sections are a nice change of pace to Ratchet's gameplay, but I have to admit that his section on Orxon in the first game kinda dragged. His time puzzles in A Crack in Time were awesome, tho.  Oh, and his laugh? So adorable.  Next week, I vote for... The Annihilator, I guess."

RatchetAndClank,3b88gx,susanna514,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:18:45 2015 UTC,"I don't like playing as clank either , I get bored . I prefer the action of ratchet more."
RatchetAndClank,3b88gx,-OrangeLightning4,3,Sat Jun 27 04:54:45 2015 UTC,"Much like Ratchet, Clank's personality changed from the first to the second game. In game one he was focused and intent on doing the right thing and saving the galaxy. But at the beginning of Going Commando he only signed on to help Fizzwidget after the apartment was mentioned."
RatchetAndClank,3b88gx,SynergizerSyd,3,Fri Jun 26 19:54:36 2015 UTC,"I think it was the robotic masseuse :P  I mean, just look at his reaction"
RatchetAndClank,3b88gx,steviecash,2,Fri Jun 26 20:02:11 2015 UTC,"I liked playing as him for the first playthrough of a game, but I usually play through the games multiple times.  On the other playthroughs I never liked it that much and ran through it as fast as possible.  I felt bad for Clank in the first game because Ratchet was a dick to him.  He's one of my favorite characters in the series for sure."
RatchetAndClank,3b88gx,IamAnthonological,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:35:15 2015 UTC,"I love Clank's gameplay, it's nice to have puzzles to break up all the Ratchet stuff. Still, I don't think they used him enough up until A Crack in Time, I hope he gets a bigger gameplay role in the new game."
RatchetAndClank,3b88gx,sarcastamasta,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:45:55 2015 UTC,"i grew up playing the games with my younger brother, so we'd always switch off levels, and we'd always be happy when we got a level where you got to play as Clank. Sure it doesn't compare to the legendary duo gameplay, but it provides new stuff to do and mixes up the gameplay, so it was always a treat to get to play as the tiny robot and explore new places. And ACIT did an outstanding job of making a totally competent standalone character that brought him up to Ratchet's level and made him more than just a backpack. Cue greatest laugh in video game history! Voting 2."
RatchetAndClank,3b88gx,MeInDevelopment,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:34:27 2015 UTC,"Clank to Ratchet & Clank is the gummi missions to Kingdom Hearts.  It's fun, but it's like being forced to go on the kids merry-go-round in between every 5 roller coaster rides."
RatchetAndClank,3b88gx,SgtTamama,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:51:05 2015 UTC,I always loved Clank and really appreciated the close friendship he had with Ratchet. I thought his gameplay was a neat addition to the series and hope we see it explored further in the new game.
RatchetAndClank,3b88gx,EdgeEdgeBatistaBomb,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:10:40 2015 UTC,He also has great lines. My favorite is when he asked Angela if she wad reincarnated.
RatchetAndClank,3b5ktm,Blakey001,16,Fri Jun 26 03:50:54 2015 UTC,"I hope there's a skin that makes you look like PS2 R&C Ratchet! Like the Old School Ratchet skin in Up Your Arsenal, but in HD!"
RatchetAndClank,3b5ktm,-OrangeLightning4,9,Fri Jun 26 06:15:17 2015 UTC,God I would love that. There was always something really cool about how the Classic Ratchet skin looked. It felt humble and less overly refined than the high tech armor you always get stuck wearing. The skin was especially great for when you hit close to end-game and you didn't want to run around looking like an itty-bitty Imperium Space Marine all the time.
RatchetAndClank,3b5ktm,IncredibleMeh,2,Fri Jun 26 06:27:42 2015 UTC,Honestly I would want the Old School skin to be the exact same polygon model from R&C1/UYA if they were gonna include it.  <_>
RatchetAndClank,3b5ktm,OniLink96,7,Thu Jul 2 06:41:38 2015 UTC,All the skins from every single game. I also hope that the gold/titanium bolts are used for upgrading weapons again like in GC instead of unlocking skins.
RatchetAndClank,3b5ktm,Vgames,3,Fri Jun 26 05:25:28 2015 UTC,"ITN required Gold Bolts for Omega weapons, which is similar and ITN is the most recent R&C game, so maybe we'll see reimagined 'Gold Weapons'.  I hope we do, anyway, since skins are really trivial things to waste gold/titanium bolts on IMO. They should be used on things that actually make a difference, which they seem to have done in ITN. Let's hope they're sticking to the ITN method or are repeating the GC method and not the UYA/ToD/ACiT method of handling gold bolts."
RatchetAndClank,3b5ktm,Trijhak,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:04:58 2015 UTC,I never knew ITN did this. I've only played the game once and never beat it because it was a rental. I really need to buy it and play again. Thank you for telling me this and yeah hopefully gold weapons make a return.
RatchetAndClank,3b5ktm,Vgames,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:41:29 2015 UTC,I highly doubt they will go back to the ways of GC.
RatchetAndClank,3b5ktm,Vgames,2,Fri Jun 26 07:29:51 2015 UTC,"Until the new game comes out, I can still dream."
RatchetAndClank,3b5ktm,DODOKING38,-10,Fri Jun 26 07:33:39 2015 UTC,Probably 15$ DLC
RatchetAndClank,3b5ktm,GodBorn,6,Fri Jun 26 08:13:49 2015 UTC,Insomniac Games haven't really done DLC for Ratchet & Clank in-game stuff (Except for FFA which was Multiplayer Stuff) so I think they'd most likely go back to unlocking them with Titanium Bolts.
RatchetAndClank,3b5ktm,DODOKING38,2,Fri Jun 26 08:16:43 2015 UTC,Sorry man. Highly doubt a company like insomniac games would use the whole DLC tactic.
RatchetAndClank,3b5ktm,IamAnthonological,2,Fri Jun 26 18:35:07 2015 UTC,Oh for fucks that was the whole point
RatchetAndClank,3b22jh,RezicG,13,Thu Jun 25 09:59:15 2015 UTC,"Basically yes.  The PS4 game is a ""reimagining"" of the first game. Fewer changes than a reboot, more changes than a remake. It is being released to tie-in to the movie coming out at the same time.  They are using the same planets, locations, and similar level and enemy design. But there will be new weapons and gadgets, and levels will have new bigger sections that weren't in the original. There'll be a level up system similar to the last game, Into the Nexus. And a bunch of other cool stuff.  Whether or not they'll do something similar with ratchet and clank 2 or 3 is complete speculation.  If you are looking to get back into the series, then now is a great time to catch up before this one comes out. The first 4 ps2 games are fantastic. As are Tools of Destruction, Quest for Booty, Crack in Time, and Into the Nexus on PS3. The PSP games are good, but missable. And All4One and Qforce are not really ratchet and clank games. They have the same characters, but they play quite differently."
RatchetAndClank,3b22jh,Minihood1997,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:17:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the clarification!  Deadlocked is the fourth game, right? I've heard mixed opinions on it. I might go ahead and play through the series in preparation of the new game :)  While you're here, are there any words on when the new R&C is coming?"
RatchetAndClank,3b22jh,Mr_Mimiseku,6,Thu Jun 25 10:22:48 2015 UTC,"Deadlocked is amazing. It might be one of my favorites. Sure, it isn't as long. But there are a lot of arena challenges, and challenges you can do after you get through a planet. It also has a few weapons that i would consider the best in the series. It's definitely worth a shot!"
RatchetAndClank,3b22jh,Mr_Mimiseku,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:09:21 2015 UTC,"Is it still like the other R&Cs only with more Arenas? Back in the day, I remember my friends saying it was more like a spinoff title with arenas only."
RatchetAndClank,3b22jh,Draav,3,Thu Jun 25 16:12:12 2015 UTC,"There are arenas. But there are also planets. There are usually just a planet with a bunch of enwmies, that culminates in an arena, or there are a couple of smaller arenas leading up to it. It's still really fun, though. It has all of the basic ratchet elements, but it is totally it's own thing."
RatchetAndClank,3b22jh,p0tat0323,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:19:01 2015 UTC,"I remember when I first played it I didn't like it very much. Much less story. Seemed like just endless arenas and missions. I mean the story was that you go on missions, but meh. I wasn't really into it that much. They did solidify a lot of cool game play though."
RatchetAndClank,3b22jh,shoopdahoop22,4,Sat Jun 27 05:18:43 2015 UTC,"The new one wont be starting a new series or continuing on from there, its being released as the game version of the movie, after this they will continue the series from where they left off after into the nexus"
RatchetAndClank,3b22jh,eight13,2,Thu Jun 25 11:03:51 2015 UTC,The new game comes out April 2016
RatchetAndClank,3b22jh,eight13,2,Thu Jun 25 10:30:37 2015 UTC,I've always loved Deadlocked. I never understood the dislike directed toward it. It's fun and fast paced and thankfully free of the Clank puzzles.
RatchetAndClank,3b22jh,Minihood1997,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:56:39 2015 UTC,"I'm probably going to check it out for myself after I'm done replaying 1, 2, and then 3. I also forgot to mention I own Size Matters, but god almighty that game is awful.."

RatchetAndClank,3b22jh,handsupdb,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:14:29 2015 UTC,"New game should be coming spring next year.  Deadlocked is the fourth game in pal regions, in America they called it gladiator. The levels are more mission focused and allow for less exploration, but the gunplay and weapon mods are some of the best."
RatchetAndClank,3b22jh,IamAnthonological,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:44:11 2015 UTC,"It all depends on what they do with Qwark, I think. If they have him end up as a good guy, it will be difficult to find a way to make the second game have the same storyline, or they may just ditch the plot twist altogether."
RatchetAndClank,3awlpb,Mich2112,18,Wed Jun 24 02:17:20 2015 UTC,"Does the plumber count? I love him. Especially in TOD when he ""almost didn't recognise you in high def!"""
RatchetAndClank,3awlpb,KingGumboot,6,Wed Jun 24 03:08:50 2015 UTC,"He absolutely counts, that's one of my favorite lines in the series!"
RatchetAndClank,3awlpb,RezicG,2,Wed Jun 24 03:41:12 2015 UTC,"Come to think of it, when he says ""See you in a year or so!"" in Going Commando, does he mean Up Your Arsenal? How long did it take for UYA to come out after GC?"
RatchetAndClank,3awlpb,KingGumboot,4,Sun Jun 28 17:24:14 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, UYA was released almost exactly a year after GC. They were probably already starting to develop it before GC was even finished"
RatchetAndClank,3awlpb,Swebb2017,13,Mon Jun 29 06:15:09 2015 UTC,"I always enjoyed the little nods made between the ratchet and clank games and the jak and Daxter games.  Also, (gonna break the rules here) the Dan memorial in the museum level of Into The Nexus. It was just a really funny/touching thing, compared to the Dan easter eggs in the other games"
RatchetAndClank,3awlpb,Echowhisker,3,Wed Jun 24 02:59:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the Hall of Heroes was great in general."
RatchetAndClank,3awlpb,IncredibleMeh,11,Wed Jun 24 03:42:00 2015 UTC,Is anyone not going to say something about this? I LOVED in GC where Endako in clanks apartment there is a...  JAK AND DAXTER POSTER! And Ratchet playing his own games plus jak ad sly on his game system at the start menu.
RatchetAndClank,3awlpb,DJCouttyboy123,9,Wed Jun 24 03:21:35 2015 UTC,"When you start doing sideflips and stuff in front of the hoverboard lady in the first game her tits expand.  It's my favorite because it's just the absolute most ridiculous nonchalant easter egg I think I've ever seen throughout the entire series. And it's remarkably easy to run into if your just screwing around on random planets, which makes for decent shock value."

Metropolis was fun to play through and rediscover. Orxon didn't really remind me of the original, though.  And doesn't the TOD loudspeaker also say Slim Cognito too?"

RatchetAndClank,3awlpb,Mr_Mimiseku,5,Wed Jun 24 18:33:56 2015 UTC,Not really an easter egg but I always loved the short dance clank does on one of the later levels in going commando. I actually did a full playthrough couple of years back just to see it again and just looking at it on youtube felt too cheap.

RatchetAndClank,3awlpb,DJCouttyboy123,4,Tue Jun 30 22:12:35 2015 UTC,"My favorite was on Planet Damosel, there was a grind rail segment and at the end you get a piece of the Hypnomatic (I think), and you do the dance and the music plays just like when Jak and Daxter find a Power Cell."
RatchetAndClank,3awlpb,IamAnthonological,4,Wed Jun 24 18:09:28 2015 UTC,"Another one of my favourites is on Todano, in R&C2, when you just beat the fuck out of everyone that gets off the tour bus. They will keep regenerating until enough people get off, so you just keep killing them, then a message comes up on screen, something like   Megacorp has been notified of your violent conduct, and we would like to request that you put an end to your murderous intents.   And various other messages. I laughed so much when I discovered it by accident."

RatchetAndClank,3aveqz,Echowhisker,8,Tue Jun 23 20:33:43 2015 UTC,"Original: Ratchet was a huge jerk in this game. I thought this was a good thing. Too many games or movies try to make a hero that is 100% a hero, and I think that a series starting off with an immature kid basically as the protagonist is a great idea, and new. However, I didn't really like his voice in this game. I'm glad they changed it.  Going Commando: Here's where I disagree with you a bit. I thought that Ratchet being nicer in this game wasn't a complete turnaround. The first game did a great job of displaying Ratchet growing more mature in how he treats others, which means that Going Commando just shows us what Ratchet learned throughout the original. If he was still a jerk in this one, it would make no sense. They also kinda replaced his jerky immaturity with a more, kid-like immaturity, such as getting excited to become a commando. I like Ratchet in this one.  Up Your Arsenal: Same as Going Commando.  Deadlocked: I feel this game tried to take Ratchet in a more dark direction, which was evident by taking Clank out of the title. This shouldn't have happened. It made no sense why he was suddenly darker.  Tools of Destruction: I didn't like Ratchet in this game. It seems they were trying to go for another Ratchet and Clank 1 story with Ratchet's treatment of Clank, but with how far he's come in the series, having him act like this made no sense. After all of their adventures together, are you really trying to convince me that Ratchet would just not trust Clank as soon as he said something a bit off the wall?  A Crack in Time: Ratchet was great here, and it was really strange for me honestly seeing how much he'd matured as a person since the original trilogy. His quest to find Clank was heartwarming, and his understanding and sacrifice really added so much depth to his character.   Into the Nexus: This is basically the same as A Crack in Time.  As for voting, I pick #1. It only makes sense to talk about Clank right after Ratchet."
RatchetAndClank,3aveqz,Koala_Guru,5,Tue Jun 23 22:39:21 2015 UTC,"Ratchet's story in these games is all about him becoming a hero, and I find his development throughout the series a really cool one to look at. Insomniac puts a lot of care into these characters which I really respect them for. Original: young dreamer, rebellious teen, why should he have to save the world? Here's where he learns to put aside his selfishness, a great place to start. Going Commando: he's a hero now. The ambition of becoming a commando is exciting for him, he thirsts for adventure now. Here's where he learns that being a hero is not all fun and games, and the stakes are really high now. Being a hero is serious business. Up Your Arsenal: Ratchet wants some recognition. He's not getting the attention he wanted and is being treated like crap by his colleagues. He learns that being a hero is more than fame, and saving the universe is noble even when nobody recognizes it. Deadlocked: he is out into a situation where he needs to choose between fame and riches or putting his life at risk to do the right thing. Being a hero means giving everything up for the greater good, even if you might not make it. Tools of Destruction: Ratchet's used to being a hero now, it's almost routine, no big deal. Here's where he learns to get a grip of reality. Learning his harsh past and Clank's as well confuse and scare him, but he needs to face facts and fight hard in a place he doesn't feel comfortable. Quest for Booty: Clank's gone. Ratchet's best friend, partner, and mentor throughout his new life, and nothing's going to stop him from finding him and rescuing him. Not ghost pirates, not mysterious Zoni magic, not anything. A Crack in Time: here's where he must learn to make sacrifices on a huge scale. He's so close to reuniting with his family, but with Clank's warnings of universal demise, he needs to give that up to be a hero. He has to give up what he truly wants, and in turn realizes that Clank is his family now. All 4 One: sometimes you need to put your differences behind you. Nefarious is evil and Qwark certainly isn't Ratchet's favorite person, but being a hero means doing what's best for everyone, and not letting differences be a hindrance to that. Full Frontal Assault: people are worth fighting for, and heroes see the best in everyone. Qwark is a wreck and this is none of Ratchet's concern, but he does what he can to defend and help Qwark through his war with Zurgo. Ratchet proves his integrity and fights for Qwark, even though he's wronged him many times in the past. Into the Nexus: he's learned a lot about being a hero at this point. He knows the people he fights for now are more important to him than his past, he can see the best out of the Progs through all the chaos, and he keeps his cool throughout, even after the death of his friends. Ratchet possesses so many great and heroic qualities now, making hima truly great hero. That's my take on it. Thanks for the discussion post! It was really cool to analyze Ratchet like this, so let's do Clank next! #1"
RatchetAndClank,3aveqz,sarcastamasta,3,Wed Jun 24 04:44:16 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, Ratchet is a great character and has always had good character development to match. My favourite incarnation of him is in Going Commando and Up Your Arsenal, where he takes the role of a competent, humble, and confident badass, he doesn't really have obvious flaws other than his friendship with Clank and Angela, but he's obviously not perfect either. While it's nice that there's extra depth to his character in Ratchet 1, I think it's a good thing that he learned from his experiences and improved on himself. I've also got to say I like him in ACiT and ITN, where he has to come to terms with the fact that he doesn't need the Lombaxes to be happy.  But since we're so focused on his personality, can I just say I love how awesome his appearance is as well? Especially with that wrench and glowing armour, you've got to appreciate how iconic and cool his design is, and how well it's aged over the years. It's definitely up there with the Spartans from Halo, or Sonic the Hedgehog.  I'll vote for 1. Might as well get Clank out of the way, now that I've thought of things worth saying about him."
RatchetAndClank,3aveqz,IamAnthonological,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:02:31 2015 UTC,"They made Ratchet to nice in the later games. In the first, you could feel how angry Ratchet was after being betrayed, or when his home planet was threatened. This added to Ratchet's character."
RatchetAndClank,3awgoc,Discoteca,3,Wed Jun 24 01:34:33 2015 UTC,I'm not sure you would be able to use it if you got someone to give it to you. The PS3 places some pretty harsh limitations on save files.

RatchetAndClank,3ar1cs,CookieDoughCooter,18,Mon Jun 22 20:30:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely start with the originals! The first one is kind of hard to go back to after you've played the others, but since you haven't, it shouldn't be a big deal. But if for some reason you can't get through the first one, read a synopsis and then move on to Going Commando. You won't regret it!"
RatchetAndClank,3ar1cs,snazzysnorlax,6,Mon Jun 22 21:00:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The first one is tougher than the rest, so if you get stuck don't be afraid to skip it and come back later.

RatchetAndClank,3ar1cs,PwnStrike,4,Tue Jun 23 09:15:16 2015 UTC,"Imo each games of the original trilogy adds just enough to keep it fresh even if you're not obsessed with the series, so chugging through the original trilogy sounds like a great idea :)"
RatchetAndClank,3ar1cs,FlowingSilver,2,Mon Jun 22 20:47:58 2015 UTC,I would get the HD collection if you can. Then try and play Deadlocked (though not necessary)  before the Future series on PS3.

RatchetAndClank,3ar1cs,EpicVico,2,Tue Jun 23 10:44:12 2015 UTC,I'm currently playing through the original 4 games and definitely recommend doing it. The original concepts are great and expand and improve at a perfect rate for how fast I get bored of things. [Minor spoilers ahead] I had to use a glitch in the first game to get a ton of bolts and buy the ryno in order to get through the end leading up to the final boss.
RatchetAndClank,3ar1cs,KingThe,2,Tue Jun 23 02:31:00 2015 UTC,"Play the first 3 HD remakes. As many others said, the first one has very clunky gameplay that makes it difficult, and also bolts are very scarce and some of the good weapons take a long time to save up for. Don't get thrown off though, if you don't like the first skip it, I'm sure you will love going commando and up your arsenal. Skip Deadlocked, it's not that important. After that move onto tools of destruction and then a crack in time. Skip all4one and Full frontal assault and then move onto Into the Nexus."

In fact, remember when all platform games seemed to have the obligatory rising water level? R&C1 (and Size Matters, and ITN) are no strangers to rising water. This was one of the ones I hated the most as a kid because it definitely seemed to rise faster than you could run, and also I often died like right before the end."

But it took me years to figure that out.  Then I got stuck on umbris. I knew that the snagglebeast fight was coming up, it just made sense that it would. So I was very intimidated by the level, and I kept not seeing the mines."

I never thought not killing them was an option but man did I become a beast at jump dodging. Then I got stuck on the final boss. Like I could not beat him. No matter how hard I tried. And I was spending all my money on ammo during my attempts that I couldn't save up for the ryno.

I for one got stuck on Batalia/Orxon/Pokitaru because I skipped a portion of R&C1 on the BTS - the alien queen boss fight. I was young and I was scared. So, I didn't have Grind Boots... meaning I couldn't get Gaspar's infobot on Batalia... meaning I couldn't get the Pilot Helmet... meaning I couldn't get the O2 Mask. On a side note, when I finally did gather the courage to face the Alien Queen I think I found myself a bit 'overpowered'. Devastator and Decoy Glove help significantly with the aliens.   You know, this kind of thing is missing from the newer games - nonlinear paths, get item on one planet that allows you to go on a new path on another. ToD and ACiT were more or less one long linear planet chain... and, from what I remember, R&C2 had a fairly non-linear planet chain.

Oh yeah, there's also Deadlocked which, with the exception of the first few levels gives you a choice between two planets every rank.  After going through this, yeah, I definitely think ToD and ACiT dropped the ball when it comes to planet linearity. R&C1 and GC managed to branch three times each, and although UYA only had one branch, it was a branch that lasted for two planets unlike in the previous games. Hope R&C PS4 has them, and also: we need more space stations."

And wrench challenge was by far our highest number of wins.  Though postgame we replayed at least 4 times and had a ridiculous number of bolts. Since they were easy to get and you could really spend them, it was off the side of the counter.  Yea, the linearity adds a bit of variety to the levels, and makes it a bit less go from A to B repeat. Though it is that non linearity that set me back so much."

They were levels that kinda ruined my mood too since they were so desolate, i spent long periods of time feeling alone in those sandy deserts/frozen tundras, and i would sometimes have to force myself to look for trouble when finding those crystals/moonstone.

Doesn't happen very often (I can actually only think of one place where it got real bad) and doesn't really matter. Other than that there are a few very small sound glitches that are only noticeable if you're very familiar with the originals, otherwise you won't even notice that anything is amiss. Only other glitch I can think of is Ratchet's helmet being too big for his head in the cutscenes of R&C2"
RatchetAndClank,3aogh5,KingGumboot,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:11:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe I should have been more specific, people report dozens of bugs and glitches, some major like no audio in some cutscenes.

Some more from Amazon reviews:  RC2:    weapon menu sometimes doesn't work one Quark cutscene without audio the helmet thing missing audio during the MegaCorp armory tour (can you confirm that? apparently it's really funny, that would be a shame)   RC3:   Shock Cannon(?) V5 and higher animations broken major slowdowns a flying sequence where you have to avoid rockets is bugged.

The vast majority of those I never encountered when I played, and also a lot of them are things that really don't matter and shouldn't even be listed (trees on Florana are more yellow coloured? So?)  As I said, the only glitches I got when playing through were mostly minor sound ones. The audio on the MegaCorp armory tour was missing, that's one of the more major things :/  With that video compilation, it's all just a bunch of stuff that doesn't matter (Al's tongue not looking right, those satellite things being hollow) or random freak glitches that I've never seen before (Chainblade, the ship)  I guess in summary there are a lot of bugs/glitches, but the only consistent ones are very minor ones that take a keen eye to even spot. Any of the major ones that are reported are only encountered sometimes and don't happen consistently - I've certainly never encountered the majority of the ones from your links"

Even with the RYNO IV he's a challenge because it doesn't even take out half of his health IIRC (whereas Drek is a joke if you have the RYNO). Without the RYNO IV he's frustrating as hell because he's also bulky and his attacks hit hard and are hard to dodge.

It got so bad that I actually went down to 0 bolts buying ammo for the battle and had to go back to quartu to get enough bolts to buy ammo before and during the battle with the punk ass PDA.

Now hes a joke for me and i'll explain why.   I speedrun the first game, and in the sake of saving all the time we can we dont use any weapon other than the bomb glove up to Drek. We buy the pyrocitor and depending on the version the blaster. For some reason they made a mistake with the PAL port on ps3 so if you hug his hitbox it will bypass his armor and invincibility frames which makes it so you can kill him in the final arena in under 30 seconds.   not on PAL PS3? blaster is the main source of damage because the Teslaclaw costs too much to get in the run. Ammo respawns when you have 3 weapons and a certain % of ammo gone, so waste the pyro and bomb glove and refill on blaster ammo.  Sorry if thats a bit longwinded. He is my favorite boss and casually he is hard as fuck unless you have the RYNO, in a speedrun hes a good way to close off the run since its not hard.  PS. If anybody is interested in learning the run i made a ROUGH guide for the first game's any% (need to revise a lot and add in easier strats for starters). If not there are other categories and games that are run and you should check out those runners."
RatchetAndClank,3akqeo,Nattylite29,2,Sun Jun 21 08:47:39 2015 UTC,PAL?
RatchetAndClank,3akqeo,Raikaru13,3,Sun Jun 21 23:06:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, the regional version of the game. This being European countries and and australia and other. heres a map for regions https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/PAL-NTSC-SECAM.svg/300px-PAL-NTSC-SECAM.svg.png  It used to be a big deal back in the day because of how TV signals worked, i'm not an expert on that but a quick wiki lookup should explain it. now they are pretty much pointless except for localization.  Note: for the pyrocitor glitch to work it needs to be the PS3 version, it doesnt exist in the ps2 version."
RatchetAndClank,3akqeo,Nattylite29,2,Sun Jun 21 23:46:02 2015 UTC,"okay back to your original post, you did the whole game just with bomb glove? there weren't too many enemies that you had to use some range?"
RatchetAndClank,3akqeo,Raikaru13,2,Mon Jun 22 00:47:58 2015 UTC,"Correct just the bomb glove. Its main use is actually to break boxes faster to get the required bolts for infobots and gadgets.  I'm going over in my head what enemies we actually need to kill and what planets they are on. The bomb glove is a nice mid-range weapon with the wrench being a great close range weapon. There are some things like the helicopter on Kerwan leading to the helipack where its out of reach of the bomb glove but a Hyper Strike actually kills it in one go because it double hits because it is at just the right height. Pokitaru is annoying as hell but the bomb glove makes quick work of those damned orange fish. Also funny thing is we never need to go to Kalebo_III for the hologuise, we use the bomb glove to kill the robots through those barriers on Drek's fleet.  That being said the only boss we actually fight in the run is Drek. You can skip the alien queen on Blarg really easy by damage abusing around her arena and never triggering her. The snagglebeast uses whats called ""ghost ratchet"" which is caused by interrupting an instant death in the mud and using the swingshot just before you hit the mud so it yanks you out. This causes you to be able to jump through walls straight to the Snagglebeast and through the exit and the infobot is just waiting there. On Gemlik Base we skip fighting Qwark entirely by just jumping the gap and funny enough there is a trigger there that tells the game you beat him and death abuse to get the cutscene/infobot/ship. Veldin there is a way to skip to 3/4 of the way through the level and then skip straight to Drek where we buy the Pyrocitor just for that fight.  x.x Little bit long winded there, but TL;DR Any enemy we need to kill only requires mid to close range. There are a surprising amount of skips throughout the first game and that leads to skipping annoying enemies/bosses too."

RatchetAndClank,3akqeo,dwenius,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:07:07 2015 UTC,"I agree that Drek is the hardest - IMO this is because the mix of platforming between the stages of the boss, and the numerous AoE attacks he has. Plus, he moves around a lot and you can't really strafe unless you want to use the really slow thruster strafe, which is another problem as this means a lot of weapons won't reliably hit him, unless they have an auto-aim like the Blaster, Devastator, and Tesla Claw. In fact, you can just say the Tesla Claw: without I find the fight is a bit harder, with it the fight is significantly easier as the Tesla Claw has 240 ammo and automatically attacks the nearest target.   Other weapons, like the Agents of Doom, Suck Cannon, Pyrocitor, Mine Glove, Taunter (as always), Drone Device (again as always) Visibomb, Morph-o-Ray, Walloper are downright useless against Drek and that's more than half of the weapons you have.   Having the PDA does make the fight a bit easier though, but only if you got the bolts since the bolt economy in the first R&C game was rough. (Speaking of the bolt economy, I hope the PS4 game has a punishing bolt economy like R&C1...)"

Oh and for people who had problems with the Protopet in GC all you need is the RYNO II, I killed the Protopet in 10 seconds."

And damn, the A4O and ITN Ratchets look really weird compared to the PS2, Future, and PS4 Ratchets.   The movie Ratchet... is it not just me, or does he look really awkward there? Those cheeks look way too big and those eyes, what's going on with them?  The PS4 Ratchet is miles better than any other on the bottom row, IMO. Looks like a fusion of the R&C1/Deadlocked and ACiT Ratchets, IMO, which is fine.    After seeing this, the PS4 Ratchet is the best Ratchet design we've seen since ACiT, IMO."

Yeah he pretty much stayed the same through the first 4 games, just slightly better graphics over the years. The differences between each PS3 game are much more noticeable which kinda irks me, I don't know why they felt the need to keep changing how he looked slightly.  I agree with you that the ACiT and new PS4 designs are the best. They look closest to the original"

RatchetAndClank,3a6obu,Leaftail,3,Thu Jun 18 05:57:28 2015 UTC,"I think they're going for nostalgia in general for the Pixelizer. 8-bit graphics are more ""nostalgic"" for most people than 32/64/128/whatever-the-hell-bit, regardless of the original's graphics."
RatchetAndClank,3a6obu,Leaftail,2,Thu Jun 18 06:17:40 2015 UTC,but it would be nostalgic to the R&C series
RatchetAndClank,3a6obu,IamAnthonological,3,Thu Jun 18 06:44:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think that'd be as fun, or noticeable. All the enemies would do is lose a couple hundred polygons.

RatchetAndClank,3a6obu,Kekoa_ok,9,Thu Jun 18 14:38:36 2015 UTC,"The presence of weapons and objects that chronologically only existed in future games bugs me. Stuff like OmniWrench Millennium 12, and various weapons such as the Combuster and Mr. Zurkon which shouldn't have been invented yet. I always appreciated the fact that weapons and gadgets seemed to progress technologically the further in time you get, and to an extent that feeling seems absent here.  I've never enjoyed the fact that recent iterations of the series have been locked to 30 fps. I can understand the 'why' of the decision behind that but it's always felt like something that could be accomplished anyway with proper optimization, especially since providing at least 60 fps has been a standard for many developers for over a year now.  The presence of a weapon as a preorder bonus is honestly pretty shameful, especially since the bonus is an entire weapon and a fan favorite at that. People who buy this after release because they weren't heavily interested in the series or didn't own a PS4 will miss out on something that only a veteran R&C player would reasonably obtain, and I just find that unacceptable."

RatchetAndClank,3a6obu,Raikaru13,5,Wed Jun 17 21:12:48 2015 UTC,"It looks like it's a new levitator. It'll probably just have a use on certain planets, and it does have a fuel meter."
RatchetAndClank,3a6obu,Trijhak,3,Wed Jun 17 22:27:32 2015 UTC,"Yea, but as we saw in the gaspar gameplay it broke the platforming element. I loved the original thruster pack, but being able to fly freely like that just bothers me, even if limited by fuel."
RatchetAndClank,3a6obu,Raikaru13,0,Wed Jun 17 23:11:11 2015 UTC,"...Whether you like it or not, the series hasn't really focused on platforming that much for a good while now. Even then you'd have to go through the platforming element to get the things for the jetpack in the first place .  The game isn't even out yet, so in no way can you state it breaks the feel of the game either."
RatchetAndClank,3a6obu,Trijhak,2,Thu Jun 18 19:05:13 2015 UTC,"there is still a great deal of platforming in it, plus this is a reimagining of the first game so it should keep in mind the original feel and mix it with new.

RatchetAndClank,3a6obu,Raikaru13,-2,Thu Jun 18 19:26:03 2015 UTC,"Also yes i can state that it breaks the feel of the game with or without playing it because of what it does.   Again, no you can't.  You cannot state such a subjective fact about a game without having played it. If Insomniac, the developers of games for more than 20 years now, have decided to include it, I'd imagine they very much know what they're doing a bit more than some random commenter on the internet who has only washed a few short videos regarding the game."

I have played that level hundreds of times, yes they are adding new bits. Also they have been developing games for years, so has every other company and they make mistakes too. So when it comes down to my favorite game of all time that i play countless times even to this day? yes i can have my opinion about what breaks the feel, especially since i've had this feature in OTHER ratchet and clank games. so dont tell me i cant have my opinion."
RatchetAndClank,3a6obu,Raikaru13,-2,Thu Jun 18 22:54:14 2015 UTC,"'I have played that level hundreds of times'  Game isn't out, so no you haven't. Maybe you've played R&C1 Gaspar hundreds of times. But this isn't R&C1 Gaspar, it's re-imagined Gaspar with new bits - that bit I never contested. Not sure why you seem to think I deny that.    Don't tell me I can't have my opinion   Then don't make statements you can hardly back up, like a game mechanic Insomnaic adding to a reimagining you have yet to play. Because you don't know if it's going to 'ruin the feel'. And, if you do, please tell me how you played R&C on the PS4, cause I'd like to know."
RatchetAndClank,3a6obu,Trijhak,0,Fri Jun 19 00:50:32 2015 UTC,"That is the same level with additions, dont tell me i havent played it. they added a side area with brains to collect. so yes i have played it hundreds of times, just not the brain section. Just because its reimagined doesnt change that it is the same level.  I can back these statements up with prior experience. Its a returning mechanic that i feel doesnt fit. If they can magically make the same mechanic and throw it somewhere else and make it magically feel right when it didnt before then i will eat my words. Until the game releases i will stand by that it breaks the feel."
RatchetAndClank,3a6obu,1CJB,0,Fri Jun 19 01:17:01 2015 UTC,"Same level with additions, don't tell me I haven't played it   No, you don't know that. Aleero City, which is pretty much new game Metropolis, already looks significantly different from R&C1 Metropolis. And I can you tell you that you haven't played it BECAUSE THE GAME ISN'T OUT YET. So what if the beginning looks like Gaspar from R&C1? That is in no way an indication of what the rest of the level is like.  You are assuming the level is 100% the same with additions when you don't even know that. Assumptions are not truth.   And you definitely cannot say you've played through it hundreds of times WITHOUT PLAYING THE GAME. You may have played R&C1 but this IS NOT RATCHET AND CLANK 1. THIS IS RATCHET AND CLANK PS4.   Did Metropolis in ToD feel ruined because it had Grind Rails, something R&C1 Metropolis didn't have?   Did Igliak in ITN feel ruined because it allowed the use of Hoverboots, something ToD Iglak didn't have?  Did Aridia in R&C3 feel ruined because it had no sand-sharks and no swingshot course?  Did Orxon in Deadlocked feel ruined because it didn't have giant clawed creatures and the alien atmosphere of the original?  Maybe you should accept the fact that R&C PS4 isn't going to emulate R&C1 100%, because that was never its goal. It's a re-imagining, not a remastering."

I mean, the original was too, and that's great, but it also had some edge. Ratchet was initially kind of a selfish asshole who had to grow throughout his character arch, and the humor was kind of crass at times.  The original game was also pretty challenging, even getting quite brutal in the later levels. I would hate to breeze through the new game in 4-5 hours.  Still, I won't judge the game yet, and I'm not that worried about it. I also recognize that the game is ostensibly made for kids, so I won't demand a super hardcore game where I die all the time (kids' games used to have a downright nasty difficulty, waay back). I just hope the ACT tuning works great."

RatchetAndClank,3a1epb,icyflamez96,8,Tue Jun 16 16:09:56 2015 UTC,Skybox is a lot better in the old one.
RatchetAndClank,3a1epb,CrystalFissure,5,Tue Jun 16 15:17:39 2015 UTC,"Insomniac skyboxes are insane. Spyro 1-3's skyboxes were beautiful, and still are to this day."
RatchetAndClank,3a1epb,Mr_Mimiseku,3,Tue Jun 16 21:16:36 2015 UTC,"That was one of my favorite parts of Spyro.  The overall design is amazing and is in my opinion the best looking Playstation game.  My favorites were the skyboxes for Enchanted Towers in Year of the Dragon, and Dragon Shores in Ripto's Rage.  Absolutely brilliant.  Not to mention Going Commando has the best looking outer space for the loading screens in the whole series."
RatchetAndClank,3a1epb,GodBorn,4,Wed Jun 17 16:25:17 2015 UTC,That's is one hell of a improvement. I can't wait!
RatchetAndClank,3a1epb,ThePoison33,3,Tue Jun 16 19:51:32 2015 UTC,That new image is exactly how I remember the old one looking when I first played it. It's great what the imagination can do.
RatchetAndClank,3a1epb,Leaftail,4,Wed Jun 17 02:33:51 2015 UTC,I think they made the new one way too bright.
RatchetAndClank,3a1epb,AllesAlex,5,Tue Jun 16 18:45:09 2015 UTC,"Well, they made it more realistic; that brightness comes from the lava."
RatchetAndClank,3a1epb,icyflamez96,5,Tue Jun 16 19:36:02 2015 UTC,I thought he was talking about the sky. I think the sky here is kind of empty looking and really glare-y
RatchetAndClank,3a1epb,Nomnom_downvotes,0,Tue Jun 16 23:28:53 2015 UTC,"Looks like it was ran through every available instagram filter. Too much bloom is bad imo. Although this is a blurry screenshot, probably isn't this bad during gameplay."
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,The_Ostrich_Guy,8,Tue Jun 16 21:14:32 2015 UTC,"Really? I actually found the opposite, the whole Angela twist, is fizzwidget a good guy or a bad guy? the ending twist, the thugs for less switch etc.  The gameplay and weapons though, dat gameplay and weapons thoe.  Both crystals AND moonstones, ship upgrades and real 3D ship combat. Not to mention the races, more than one arena, levotator AND glider."

RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,IncredibleMeh,4,Wed Jun 17 04:00:44 2015 UTC,That I did   Reddit sync has failed me
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,handsupdb,6,Wed Jun 17 04:39:53 2015 UTC,If this one goes well (especially if it sells better than the recent PS3 games did) then it could happen
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,KingGumboot,3,Tue Jun 16 22:47:36 2015 UTC,"Anythings possible I guess. Given that the PS4 version of the first game is looking to be a big success, the demand and potential profit of a Going Commando Re-Imagining would be reasonably high."
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,IncredibleMeh,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:35:39 2015 UTC,The reimagining is based on the movie. They'll only redo GC if they continue the movies.
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,IZ3820,2,Wed Jun 17 13:33:43 2015 UTC,"I just hope for a real Ratchet and Clank movie trilogy about the first three games. These were my favorite games, and the new movie about the first game looks really promising. Imagine next-gen Maktar Nebula... oh-my-god."
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,AllesAlex,2,Fri Jun 19 12:59:31 2015 UTC,I agree. The trilogy basically defined my childhood.
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,Defmork,2,Sat Jun 20 02:21:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, they shouldn't. Going commando was done so so well that there isn't much necessity to change it into continuity. Its ratchets short segue into the bogon galaxy, and adds to the story and shouldn't have any continuity issues. That is, unless he ends the new game living somewhere other than veldin."
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,handsupdb,2,Wed Jun 17 02:53:53 2015 UTC,"Going Commando was great, I would love to see the series return to the Bogon galaxy. Especially after how great the reimagining of the first game looks."
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,FrancoisBeaumont,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:06:13 2015 UTC,"If it gets a movie, sure, but it would be much harder to adapt into a movie, seeing as its plot is (IMO) more complex than that of the first game with a lot more plot twists, which may confuse the audience.   UYA would definitely be easy to adapt into a movie though, since the general plot of the game is very easy to adapt into movie - you have your villain and you have your goals, and you already have a supporting cast - the Q-Force, and it has much less plot twists.  Same for Deadlocked, considering that Dreadzone was a TV show - in fact, a movie could probably pull off the plot of Deadlocked better than the game could because of this IMO."
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,Trijhak,2,Wed Jun 17 17:59:13 2015 UTC,"I think Going Commando would make an awesome movie, it's plot is very reminiscent of a spy movie. You might be right, and kids may not respond well to it, but movies such as Cars 2 and Who Framed Roger Rabbit were both quite successful, and their plots are just as, if not more complicated.  I do agree that UYA would probably make the best film though, it's a lot more epic and action oriented than the others."
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,IamAnthonological,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:33:29 2015 UTC,It's impossible to say that until the game and movie come out and we see how well they turn out. I hope so though. If anything I'd like to get an entire Ratchet and Clank film trilogy with reimaginings of the games on the PS4. But we'll have to see how this one goes.
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,IamAnthonological,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:35:37 2015 UTC,"Well if they do, then they do Up your arsenal, how are they gonna tackle the future games?  I just seems to me like this re imagining isn't going to have the same feeling to the first game's at all.  Instead of re imagining, I think it's just like they created another future game with everything the same except the story's based off R&C 1.  Such as I seriously doubt, they'll still have the ratchet/clank clashing personalities like they did in the first game, and I doubt quark will be anything like he was before, in fact it looks as if they've made him a good guy right off the bat.  Point is, it's just the same charters as the future series, put into the R&C plot.  I just hope they pull a three sixty when the game releases and they still have everything that made the first game classic."
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,MeInDevelopment,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:34:01 2015 UTC,"I never liked Going Commando, it felt out of place. Up Your Arsenal on the otherhand i would LOVE to see if this one goes well."
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,Raikaru13,14,Wed Jun 17 01:50:46 2015 UTC,"You sir, are never going to be my friend.  I actually argue that Going Commando is not only the best of the series, but possibly the best game ever."
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,handsupdb,2,Wed Jun 17 02:52:42 2015 UTC,"to each their own, i just think its story was exceptionally weak. so much so that it held the entire game back."
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,Raikaru13,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:57:30 2015 UTC,I held the belief that UYA was the best and Going commando was one of the worst.  Then I played going commando again. And now it's my 3rd favourite in the series.
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,MeInDevelopment,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:35:31 2015 UTC,It is the best game ever damnit.
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,IamAnthonological,3,Thu Jun 18 07:27:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes it is."
RatchetAndClank,3a33yz,handsupdb,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:51:20 2015 UTC,"Personally, I loved the story in GC as well as the weapons and the humor. I loved how they expanded so much on all the things that made the original game great. However, the controls in the first two games made them feel unnecessarily difficult when trying to do certain tasks that shouldn't be as difficult. With UYA, there were more control schemes and it just felt easier to play. UYA was a great game, I loved everything that they added and how well put together that game was. If I were to move the UYA controls over to GC, it would be the greatest."
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,jamezo10,14,Tue Jun 16 10:14:12 2015 UTC,"Going Commando is my favourite, and probably the best in the sense that it is the ""purest"" of the games. UYA and ACiT definitely expand the series and are still a lot of fun though, so I guess it's all relative."
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,IamAnthonological,3,Tue Jun 16 14:57:16 2015 UTC,"Definitely Going Commando.  To me, it has the best story, best music, and has a lot of my favorite planets like Oozla, Boldan, and Tabora."
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,The_Ostrich_Guy,4,Tue Jun 16 20:38:00 2015 UTC,"""Do not all things belong to the Cosmos?""    ""Uhh..  No.  That's definitely my ship. """
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,Fixer_,6,Fri Jun 19 03:55:51 2015 UTC,"Unpopular opinion, but deadlocked was my favorite. My brother and I spent so much time going through all the challenges together."
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,amanthey3,2,Tue Jun 16 21:05:31 2015 UTC,"The thing about deadlocked is that the worlds were too fast paced for their own good and too linear. Each world was really cool but the enemies were the same the whole way through. I mean you get to fight on a ghost ship, but only for like 20 minutes. And also the were too few weapons and gadgets, I mean ten weapons is way too few for a full game and having only the swingshot is so boring  That said the boys fights were awesome and the vehicle missions were cool."
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,DeutschDuck,2,Wed Jun 17 14:57:26 2015 UTC,I think the biggest thing I liked was the Co op campaign. I wish it was something that would be brought back
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,amanthey3,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:00:40 2015 UTC,"Same here! Deadlocked was my favorite, next to ToD. they are tied."
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,Echowhisker,3,Wed Jun 17 16:24:32 2015 UTC,The first 3.
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,Nomnom_downvotes,3,Tue Jun 16 11:42:03 2015 UTC,Agreed.
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,TheRealSerdadu,3,Tue Jun 16 11:49:05 2015 UTC,Going Commando Personally.  up your arsenals difficulty was a bit too much and i liked commando's visuals better but its a close competition between the two.  Dont like the future series as it lacks the humor and art style of the original 3
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,Raikaru13,3,Tue Jun 16 15:02:10 2015 UTC,First game was my favorite followed by Up Your Arsenal. The first game just felt right and UYA had great humor and a good story.
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,Cardboard_Waffle,3,Wed Jun 17 01:51:53 2015 UTC,"A crack in time for me. It's gorgeous, so much fun and the wrap s were fantastic. The story was cool too, learning more about ratchets past and clanks past."
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,stikas129,2,Wed Jun 17 18:37:12 2015 UTC,I personally think that RaC3 and Tools of Destruction are the 2 best.
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,Jonas_soe,3,Tue Jun 16 10:20:14 2015 UTC,Would have liked ToD to be a bit more challenging though.
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,stikas129,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:55:50 2015 UTC,I think that ToD is one of the more challenging ones since you can't tank hits.
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,Trijhak,2,Tue Jun 16 13:16:48 2015 UTC,"Really? I find it to be the easiest R&C game by far. Back when it was new quite a few people were complaining about how easy it was, IIRC."
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,Koala_Guru,2,Wed Jun 17 18:10:10 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna have to go with Tools of Destruction. At first, I loved A Carck in Time better. It had amazing gameplay, an incredible story, and a great focus on Clank, my favorite character. Then I played ToD for the first time, and while the story may not be as great, it just had so much more diversity in gameplay. Ratchet, Clank, Swimming, Flying, it just felt like every moment there was an entirely new experience to enjoy."
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,ComplexVanillaScent,2,Tue Jun 16 17:31:41 2015 UTC,"Up Your Arsenal by and far; perfected the formula of the first two, polished the visuals, had so many fantastic secrets and unlockables, had a great story, great humor, and had the best, most polished, most fun gameplay. Not to mention Dr. Nefarious was just the best villain ever."
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,JangoF76,4,Wed Jun 17 01:17:00 2015 UTC,"A Crack in Time, hands down - although they are all good, and you really need to have played from the beginning to truly appreciate aCiT.  (I'm not counting the spin-offs or Size Matters because, well they're shit. You can also skip Deadlocked as it doesn't have much in the way of story)"
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,Echowhisker,2,Tue Jun 16 11:08:33 2015 UTC,Size matters wasn't bad. Secret agent clank... Why High Impact? why u do dis to clank?
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,shoopdahoop22,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:25:51 2015 UTC,Something about Size Matters and Secret Agent Clank just felt... off... compared to the PS2 games
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,ncmggr,2,Fri Jun 19 15:25:01 2015 UTC,i blame the daxter spinoff for that game
RatchetAndClank,3a0uvq,Nattylite29,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:42:06 2015 UTC,Haha yeh i've played them all!! Love it to bits :)

RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,Patrazor,24,Mon Jun 15 23:02:07 2015 UTC,Huh... What are the chances that the story is going to be Quark retelling the events of the first game and lying out his behind?
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,LX_Theo,3,Tue Jun 16 00:14:38 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing!
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,WantAndAble,13,Tue Jun 16 01:51:08 2015 UTC,"Ratchet's face is really stiff in these cutscenes. Probably gonna be fixed. Also, Qwark's narration is new."
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,Koala_Guru,12,Mon Jun 15 23:32:42 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, I love it. The level is laid out exactly the same as the original one was, but then hello! Grind rail leading to a completely new area. Interesting to see sandsharks from Aridia and what looks like those big crab things from Orxon both in the level. Also, definite confirmation of Gadgetron vendors.  The only thing I'm less than excited about is, as usual, the weapons :/  Edit: Wait, I just saw the jetpack part. No no no this doesn't look good. I don't want to be able to just fly all over the entire level as I please. Instead of exploring the level normally, you can just go get the jetpack and fly wherever you want to...  Second edit: Also nice to see tri-pads again, I always liked those. Would've been better without the wires between them making it even more obvious where they are, but oh well"
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,KingGumboot,5,Tue Jun 16 01:02:24 2015 UTC,"If the jetpack is anything like the one in into the nexus, you won't be able to fly in some areas. So it would only be specially designed jetpack areas of the level. Also, the jetpack seems to be constantly at 50% fuel or something. I hope this is just for the demo, and that the fuel will work very similar to into the nexus."
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,Minihood1997,5,Tue Jun 16 03:29:45 2015 UTC,Nexus had a jetpack? I played that game last year and I have no memory of that. I need to play all the PS3 games again
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,KingGumboot,9,Tue Jun 16 04:31:02 2015 UTC,"They NEED to replace the music with the original Gaspar. I mean listen to this! Gaspar music.  The techno-breakbeat soundtrack from R&C was a huge part of making iconic. Honestly, at the risk of sounding hyperbolic, I could argue that video game music is dead. It's either orchestra or ambience, and it's a massive shame in my opinion."
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,CrystalFissure,3,Tue Jun 16 05:21:03 2015 UTC,"Video game music isn't dead, you just need to look harder :).  Ratchet's soundtrack is definitely a far cry from the Bergeaud days though."
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,tigranater,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:28:41 2015 UTC,"they have a different composer this time. also i'm more comfortable with him doing his own thing, than him trying to copy Bergeaud. Good thing you can play music over games on your ps4 now though"
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,ncmggr,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:50:03 2015 UTC,"Well in the case that it is a new composer, you're right. Because they're not going to be able to imitate that unique sound, even if they have all the breakbeats."
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,CrystalFissure,7,Fri Jun 19 22:10:44 2015 UTC,I gotta stop watching these.  Need to save some surprise!
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,WantAndAble,5,Tue Jun 16 01:51:23 2015 UTC,I say this to myself but if a full playthrough of the game was released I'd sit there and watch the whole thing
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,KingGumboot,4,Tue Jun 16 06:33:17 2015 UTC,Michael Bross music.... * sigh * man not feeling the soundtrack  so far.
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,tryinthisout123,3,Tue Jun 16 06:51:58 2015 UTC,Nice try Richard Horvitz  but your Zim like voice slipped through on a few of those Blarg scientist lines.
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,fullmetalraz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:08:36 2015 UTC,YES! I wasn't the only one that noticed!
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,Alanderus,3,Tue Jun 16 20:16:19 2015 UTC,I can't tell if they remastered the music?
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,PowerForward,12,Tue Jun 16 01:09:58 2015 UTC,"They certainly haven't ""remastered"" it, they've just taken it away and replaced it with a generic soundtrack. AKA every R&C game after Deadlocked if you ask me."
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,CrystalFissure,4,Tue Jun 16 05:22:02 2015 UTC,what a bummer. Wow

RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,CrystalFissure,7,Tue Jun 16 10:27:10 2015 UTC,Dear God no! The new ones!
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,Zedriodor,2,Tue Jun 16 10:38:45 2015 UTC,I'm really not a fan of the weird thing around the edge of the screen while ratchet is grinding. Other than that I'm more than hyped for this game.
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,CompletetheCircuit,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:49:01 2015 UTC,Holy fuuuck it looks awesome! Man i'm pumped. Is there a preorder bonus of any sort?
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,Nattylite29,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:52:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting that the jetpack from ITN is back. Glad it is, it opens a lot for more vertical level designs.  Sad that it appears the sand-sharks, frog-like enemies of BTS, and the clawed enemies of Orxon are appearing on Gaspar, which probably means this won't have the enemy variety quite a few were  hoping for.  Shame that they're not bringing back Bergeaud. Seriously Insomniac, music works best as atmosphere, not for 'epic orchestral scores' like in the Future series - the non-radio music in ACiT was extremely forgettable and none of the tracks in ITN are as good as the tracks in the original series. There's a reason so many like those tracks over the tracks of the future series and beyond."
RatchetAndClank,39z0ro,Trijhak,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:50:54 2015 UTC,"This feels like Future way too much... The original Ratchet and Clank should have been the bigger influence. Unfortunately this feels like more of the same...  Don't like the Groovitron, Mr Zurkon, Combustor or Fusion Bomb being in the game. The jet-pack feels like it shouldn't be in there since it's such a massive change... It makes the level feel entirely different (not in a good way) when you can fly around like that. Armour shouldn't be in the game, but at least Ratchet's not wearing a helmet. The OST would have been much better if it was the one from the original but redone and re-recorded with higher quality and perhaps maybe remix it slightly to give it extra oomph.  I love that the worlds and levels have been redone. They look amazing and that's one thing I love. The infobots are a welcome return as well as Gadgetron.  The one thing that has the ""Future"" feel but actually works is the UI. I think it's sleek and has nice design to it. Well done whoever designed that."
RatchetAndClank,3a0v2i,Half-Shot,6,Tue Jun 16 10:17:06 2015 UTC,"Orxon, because playing as Clank there is probably my least favourite part of the whole game. I'm sure Clank gameplay will be much better in this game than the original though, it has generally improved with each game"
RatchetAndClank,3a0v2i,KingGumboot,7,Tue Jun 16 12:53:36 2015 UTC,"Indeed. The issue for me was how slow he moved and the amount of retracking you had to do for the bots.   With any luck, hopefully GCs gameplay will return. I rather liked the sequence where you flipped between Ratchet and Clank."
RatchetAndClank,3a0v2i,KingGumboot,6,Tue Jun 16 14:07:19 2015 UTC,"Having to go back for bots when they died was the worst part. You could argue that it's too hand-holdy when the later games don't penalise you at all for losing one, but god damn it got annoying when you got all the way to the gate and one of the stupid things died"
RatchetAndClank,3a0v2i,Mr_Mimiseku,3,Tue Jun 16 14:10:50 2015 UTC,During the trailer there was a bridge bot. So maybe it might take the improvements of GC.
RatchetAndClank,3a0v2i,TheRealSerdadu,3,Tue Jun 16 21:11:40 2015 UTC,Quartu! DEFINITELY  it was the coolest planet in the original game I hope they keep the goofiness of the sentry bots
RatchetAndClank,3a0v2i,Leaftail,2,Tue Jun 16 15:04:13 2015 UTC,"They have a perfect opportunity with Quartu to better explain Clank's backstory. Haven't played ACiT but I don't think they've ever satisfactorily explained why his father sent him to Solana, what role his mom had in his creation, and why he was created in a high-security place, where he was immediately chased and almost killed."
RatchetAndClank,3a0v2i,TheRealSerdadu,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:14:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I dont know why they didnt bother explaining that better in ACiT. I don't think clanks father should exist at all aswell as the whole Clank has a Magic soul Fiasco"
RatchetAndClank,3a0v2i,Plokster52,2,Thu Jun 18 14:25:02 2015 UTC,"I really like Gemilk Base, it was a fun level and had a great boss fight. I'd like to see if they could make it even more fun!"
RatchetAndClank,3a0v2i,AllesAlex,2,Tue Jun 16 19:38:16 2015 UTC,"Metropolis and Black Water City. We have already seen some of Kerwan, but that was Aleero City. I'm really curious and excited about how they have made next-gen Blackwater City, one of my most remembered childhood level."
RatchetAndClank,3a0v2i,Leaftail,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:48:25 2015 UTC,"I think Aleero is just the new name for Metropolis, considering the train station was located in Metropolis in the first game. I can see why they'd want to change it, since it's a pretty lazy and overused (but also descriptive and cool) name. I mean, they'd already made a level in Spyro 2 called Metropolis."
RatchetAndClank,3a0v2i,Leaftail,2,Thu Jun 18 05:21:11 2015 UTC,The hodgepodge designer planet. It's a super-important planet but you never step foot on it in the first game. It would be a cool penultimate level that combines elements of various other worlds.
RatchetAndClank,3a0v2i,TheRealSerdadu,2,Thu Jun 18 05:32:55 2015 UTC,You mean Drek's planet? that would be amazing
RatchetAndClank,3a0v2i,ThatGuyWhoTrollz,3,Thu Jun 18 14:26:15 2015 UTC,Pokitaru of course
RatchetAndClank,3a0v2i,KingGumboot,3,Tue Jun 16 12:58:41 2015 UTC,"Why do you feel that it needs an update? (It is going to be in the new game, as we've seen from the trailer, so you're in luck). I felt it was a pretty good level, my only complaint is that the main path is pretty much entirely just the flopping fish things"

RatchetAndClank,39zq3q,Leaftail,3,Tue Jun 16 06:56:19 2015 UTC,Pretty much sums up my thoughts on every release title I see these days.
RatchetAndClank,39zq3q,Ciocana,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:40:22 2015 UTC,"Just for the sake of asking, what exactly is your issue with preorders?"
RatchetAndClank,39zq3q,Minihood1997,6,Thu Jun 18 01:48:50 2015 UTC,"ACIT had special bonuses, in the form of a few thousand extra bolts and a ship skin and the camo skin for the cryomine. Those skins could at least be unlocked through skill points.  Then all 4 one had the different morph gun things. The base game had pigs, but if you preordered from the right place you could get t-rexes or sheep. But the weapon was exactly the same. The creatures just looked different.  But locking a whole weapon away is ridiculous. I am lucky enough to have the money to spare, and I trust insomniac not to completely fuck this up, what we've seen so far is really promising, and I really want the bouncer. So I am going to preorder the game. Although I will wait till a bit closer to release.  I am annoyed at insomniac. And there is no benefit to them, they get the same money as if I waited till release. I will preorder for the bouncer, but I am not happy about."
RatchetAndClank,39zq3q,Blakey001,2,Tue Jun 16 08:43:47 2015 UTC,"Those skins could at least be unlocked through skill points.   That's the right way to do it. Easier to access content that's still available to everyone.   but if you preordered from the right place you could get t-rexes or sheep.   And that's one of the worst ways to do it. In order to get all the in-game content (that's on the damned disc), a customer would have to buy from each store, and then they still wouldn't have a complete product in either one of them. Granted, it could be worse. They could lock missions or actual weapons (and not cosmetic effects), which a lot already do.  Personally I'm not going to pre-order. Pre-ordering used to be ""Pay $5 and then wait until release to pay the rest, and get some physical stuff"". Now it's ""Pay full price now and we might finish the product if we're feeling generous. Oh, and instead of physical bonuses you get content that others are locked out of,""  I mean, the trend needs to stop being rewarded. If I buy a game, I want everything that comes with the game. I don't want DRM or some special code keeping me from accessing parts of a product I paid just as much for. I shouldn't be punished for being a responsible, informed consumer, yeah?  I do have the money to spare, but if I'm not going to buy furniture or a car without it being finished first, I'm not going to buy a game. I'll be using the game more anyway haha"
RatchetAndClank,39zq3q,Blakey001,3,Tue Jun 16 16:34:26 2015 UTC,It is. I highly doubt they will release it as DLC because they haven't done it before (like the ITN Pre-Order armor)
RatchetAndClank,39zq3q,xFirestormZ,6,Tue Jun 16 03:14:43 2015 UTC,"Ugh. Why must pre-order exclusives continue to exist?  I'm fine with physical exclusives, or even digital bonuses that give you an easier way to obtain something (like getting a late game item the moment you start the game), or if they give you bonuses that are already going to come in a collector's edition (which still shouldn't have digital perks, because a collector's edition is supposed to be collected. The point isn't to play it.  This isn't even a new weapon or a skin they made up. This is a weapon that's been in many of the games, so any fan that doesn't pre-order is just getting a big ""Sucks to be you!"" from the developers."
RatchetAndClank,39zq3q,xFirestormZ,3,Tue Jun 16 04:13:10 2015 UTC,"As I agree with you, theres not really a problem pre-ordering a game that you want. If you want it, pre-order it if you must have that item. Especially if its a game you want."
RatchetAndClank,39zq3q,KingGumboot,2,Tue Jun 16 08:40:25 2015 UTC,"I mean I think people who pre-order (and by that I mean pre-purchase) are part of the growing problem in the games industry. However, I don't blame them. People can pre-order if they want, it's the companies who are at fault for taking advantage of the consumer. People naturally feel like if they don't get something extra someone else gets, they're losing money or missing out. And companies try to manipulate that (and succeed).  All in all, it's irresponsible. But so is smoking. Or eating too much fast food. Or buying stuff on ebay without seeing photo proof of its quality. Or all the other things that are irresponsible but not really wrong to do. So I can't really fault someone for pre-ordering. Because I do other stuff that they might shake their head at in the same way I do to them, yeah?"
RatchetAndClank,39zq3q,IamAnthonological,5,Tue Jun 16 16:39:48 2015 UTC,"Yes it sucks, but to be fair it's Sony that told Insomniac to make a pre-order bonus, and then Insomniac found a weapon they like (Bouncer), and added it in. Without a pre-order bonus the Bouncer wouldn't be in the game.  I hope the decide to add the Bouncer as DLC in late 2016 or something."
RatchetAndClank,39zq3q,IamAnthonological,2,Tue Jun 16 09:07:54 2015 UTC,"to be fair it's Sony that told Insomniac to make a pre-order bonus   Good point.   Without a pre-order bonus the Bouncer wouldn't be in the game.   How do you figure that? I doubt putting one weapon into the game costs so much that they have to use it as a pre-order bonus to make back the cost. People would pre-order it without the bonus anyway, so how many sales does it add? It's not even pennies on the dollar at that point."
RatchetAndClank,39zq3q,IamAnthonological,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:27:13 2015 UTC,"Luckily I have some sauce. It's because Sony told Insomniac to make a pre-order bonus, and then Insomniac found weapon they wouldn't put in the game otherwise. The Bouncer."
RatchetAndClank,39zq3q,IamAnthonological,2,Tue Jun 16 17:55:45 2015 UTC,"Them saying that is like a company saying a lower FPS is for a ""cinematic experience"" or when a company refuses to add an FOV slider because it gives people who use it an ""unfair advantage"". It's an excuse. While I don't doubt that Sony told them to do it, saying ""It wouldn't make it in otherwise"" is total bull. So Sony forced them to include a pre-order exclusive that in no way would be part of the game without buying the pre-order?  I can write a book, take out a chapter, and then only give it to people who buy my book before it's even finished... And then I can claim that I didn't take out anything, I ""added"" the chapter as ""extra"" for the consumer.   We did not withdraw anything. It was ADDED.   I mean come on. Don't leave content out of the normal release and then claim the content is ""extra"". If they said ""Sony told us we had to provide a pre-order exclusive"" and that's all they said, I'd be fine. But they're claiming that leaving content out of the game for the regular consumer isn't exactly that?"
RatchetAndClank,39zq3q,IamAnthonological,4,Tue Jun 16 18:12:57 2015 UTC,"I really hope they add it as DLC at least. It'd still suck but I love R&C enough to pay for a weapon.  If I can still get it as a pre-order bonus right up until just before release, I might consider pre-ordering before it releases. I don't even have a PS4 yet so I'll have to see"
RatchetAndClank,39zq3q,vitti-ix,3,Tue Jun 16 12:51:37 2015 UTC,"I'd be all for weapon DLC. Honestly, the series is perfect for weapon DLC. What makes a new play-through worth doing in R&C games? The new weapons and the upgraded versions of weapons already purchased, of course! So weapon DLC would be perfect, because it would increase the longevity of the game.  Pre-order digital bonuses are just silly. A collector's edition or pre-order edition should have special, physical items (posters, special game case, trinkets and the like). Not digital exclusives. I'm definitely not going to pre-order the game, but I'm still going to buy it.  If R&C were as big as Skyrim or other games like that (I mean it's big but not that big), people would have grabbed pitchforks as soon as it was announced. I'll be fine with it though if you just end up getting it SUPER early (like they did with some of the Dragon Age games), so that no one really misses out on content."
RatchetAndClank,39zq3q,vitti-ix,2,Tue Jun 16 16:23:50 2015 UTC,"Basically they wanted to put the Bouncer in the game but weren't sure they'd have the time and resources to add it, so they made it a pre-order bonus to ensure they could work on it up until release (not when they hand in the final build to Sony) and could get preorders to pay for it.  It's either preorder bonus, or not in the game at all. Most DLC is like that, I hate paying for it too, and I also want to resist preordering when I can, but that's the reality.  The developers want to make more content, but they need more money. The publishers want more money, but they need more content. DLC solves both problems wonderfully."
RatchetAndClank,39zq3q,Trijhak,2,Tue Jun 16 13:09:50 2015 UTC,"so they made it a pre-order bonus to ensure they could work on it up until release   That doesn't make any sense. Whether it's a pre-order bonus or in the regular game, it takes just as much time to work on and implement. It's not like they need tons of preorders so that they have enough in the bank to make a specific weapon.  A lot of companies try to justify why pre-order digital bonuses and timed paywalls are a thing in their games, but it's all a bunch of fluff. Non Day One DLC is the way to go, because if they want to add extra, they can. There's no justification for screwing over a responsible consumer by giving them less product."

RatchetAndClank,39s38c,_Fiku,3,Sun Jun 14 06:40:41 2015 UTC,Ratchet and Clank team up and defeat Drek - that is a fundamental fact between the two. How they get there is different.

Insomniac created Ratchet and Clank in 2002, the game has come along way since and they regret things they both did and didn't do in hindsight, and are using modern technology and the advanced lore to retell Ratchet and Clank's origin story in a way they can feel satisfied with and relate to the more recent games."
RatchetAndClank,39s38c,IamAnthonological,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:29:48 2015 UTC,"They're kinda fixing it.

RatchetAndClank,39s38c,JangoF76,4,Sun Jun 14 10:42:03 2015 UTC,"No it isn't. A reboot is a new game in a series that completely disregards all continuity and starts over. This game technically is a reboot as well, but a reboot and re-imagining aren't the same thing.  A remake is when you remake the same game, staying very true to the original. Usually just graphical updates like all the HD updates we've been getting on PS3 and now PS4.  A re-imagining, on the other hand, is when you take the same game and, well, re-imagine it. In this case, the basic premise for the story is the same, and the same planets are used, but the similarities end there. The story has differences, levels are redesigned, weapons are different, etc. The full extent of the similarities and differences isn't known yet, but we can see from the trailers that there are a lot of both."
RatchetAndClank,39s38c,KingGumboot,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:48:11 2015 UTC,so basically a reboot and remake at the same time?

I always thought Zurkon was the worst of the bodyguards.  I guess they serve slightly different purposes as the Glove of Doom can run out and blow up on people from a distance and Mr. Zurkon is just there for chip damage. So there's some hope"
RatchetAndClank,39rlwt,icyflamez96,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:09:07 2015 UTC,"i hope its still their. Mr. Zurkon is good for extra fire power, but the agents of doom where the best/safest crowd control weapon (besides the r.y.n.o.) for large numbers of weak enemies in the smaller areas from the first game.

RatchetAndClank,39rlwt,ncmggr,3,Sat Jun 20 00:07:09 2015 UTC,"More useful than the synthenoid, and delightfully destructive. I welcomed them with open arms.  I vote Nexus, I've got a lot to say!"
RatchetAndClank,39rlwt,handsupdb,2,Mon Jun 15 01:18:39 2015 UTC,"I liked them, they started off like the classic Glove of Doom and then started flying like the Synthenoid/Kilonoid, only to return to their classic form once they run out of ammo. Brilliant.  They were a lot more useful than the Synthenoid too, I always found that weapon to be too expensive when it first shows up, and then too weak unless you go out of your way to buy it immediately"
RatchetAndClank,39rlwt,KingGumboot,2,Sun Jun 14 06:17:09 2015 UTC,"They were okay, the Glove of Doom and the Synthenoid were great, so what do you do? Put them together. Brilliant. My only problem is that you have to upgrade them to get them to that level of brilliance, and they can feel week until then. But it's really worth it. Definitely the best of the robot ""assistants"", even Mr. Zurkon wishes he was as good at killing as these.  We've already talked a ton about 1, best not to bring it up again until we see more, so I vote for 2."
RatchetAndClank,39rlwt,IamAnthonological,2,Sun Jun 14 13:34:19 2015 UTC,They were great to use if I wanted to get a little juggernaut thing going and power through levels.  Vote for Into The Nexus.

RatchetAndClank,39qqlp,handsupdb,6,Sun Jun 14 02:33:44 2015 UTC,"Wonderfully comprehensive analysis and comparison of the two games here.  Interestingly the guy who made the video seems like a very rare specimen: somebody who prefers immature, jerk Ratchet to nice-guy Ratchet of later games. Even when RC1 was first released Ratchet's personality drew a lot of criticism. I just so happen to be another fan who actually enjoys Ratchet's character arc from the immature hot-head he was  in the first game to what he becomes later on. In fact it is quite jarring to see him so nice to Clank in the first game. Understandably it must have been annoying to watch Ratchet be such a dick to many fans but it was crucial to his character development and played out really well in many sections, such as when the duo get tricked by  Qwark at the Blargian Snagglebeast and Ratchet blames Clank for it for much of the rest of the game.  As the guy pointed out, the relationship seems rather flaccid and unintersting now.  That aside, I have no qualms about the rest of the reimagining. As the video shows, Insomniac have been remarkably - even unexpectedly - faithful to the original game, with the majority of original locations and enemies returning. It seems like they will take the locations and set-pieces of the original game and rearrange them to provide something that is fresh for series veterans and enjoyable to newcomers, which is certainly the best course of action over either a 1:1 remake or a completely new take on things.  I'm genuinely impressed with the fidelity of the reimagining too, the enemies look exactly the same and sections like Novalis and Pokitaru are instantly recognisable. Combining levels and adding new ones is also welcome, as it seems like they have done with Hoven & Batalia, as well as Nebula G34 & Umbris.  Overall I'm pleasantly surprised with what Insomniac have come out with here and I just can't wait to try this out next spring. I wonder, is anybody else in the same boat with actually liking Ratchet's character from the first game?"
RatchetAndClank,39qqlp,ggop_,2,Sat Jun 13 20:58:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's so much a preference because he's a jerk as much as it is a preference for reasonable character development. And even though he acts like a jerk, I think it served as a larger statement of his then immaturity (reflected by his selfishness and narrow minded-ness), making the heroic journey as a whole more significant.   My only gripe is that the world just seems too soft and friendly. Even with the snagglebeast, having some nerdy guy commentating in the background just detracts from the epic feel of the boss fight. I can say from my experience when I first saw the snagglebeast in the first game I was genuinely fear stricken. Now it just looks more like the Mungo or War Grok than the giant hell spawn i've come to know and love. This makes it come across more like the future series than the original game and makes me inclined to agree with pretty much everything the guy in the video is saying.   Not to say I won't enjoy the game, but I do not think it will be close to the original trilogy story and humor wise."
RatchetAndClank,39qqlp,_Fiku,3,Sun Jun 14 04:31:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100%. As much as I'm loving the aesthetics of the reimagining cases like the Blargian Snagglebeast remind me more of the lovey-dovey pseudo-scary ACiT art design than what could at times be genuinely scary PS2 art design. It may be because Insomniac is trying to gain a new generation of R&C fans but honestly I don't feel like it needs to up the cheese to achieve that.   Kids have always found cool what their older brothers liked, so in this case you might even be alienating the preteen generation that fell in love with the original series by making it too childlike. That was in my opinion the biggest flaw with the Future series - it never found its ground. It didn't mature along with the rest of the series but could never be as cutesy as Mario. It could have and should have stuck to the PS2 ethos.  At the same time, the Future trilogy was killer and the general visual quality made up for the misplaced artistic direction. Hopefully that will also prevail here."
RatchetAndClank,39qqlp,apetoaster,3,Sun Jun 14 04:37:34 2015 UTC,"In my opinion I very much disliked character interaction and the overall plot of the Future series, but the gameplay was A LOT better, as well as the visuals.   I mean come on, you can't have a robot killing hero acting like such a nice guy ALL the time or acting like a wimp, he needs to be like he was in Going Command and UYA, that was the primetime for Ratchet and Clank.   Even if Ratchet and Clank is aimed for a younger artist now, it shouldn't be, as I don't think a parent would allow their child to play a shooting game even if the characters are ""nice"", because the core element of shooting and killing is there, though that's if it's a super up-tight parent, or the child is super super young and whatnot.  I feel like they should keep the Ratchet x Clank relationship somewhat to the original one, though maybe a bit more lightened up, but Ratchet shouldn't be a super nice guy, he's had a hard life living w/o parents, on a desert planet, alone, killing those frog thingies for food probably.  He should be a bit feisty."
RatchetAndClank,39qfpu,Nickinator96,8,Sat Jun 13 19:20:10 2015 UTC,"He resembles the way he looked in the Future series, plus he also had really big eyes in the PS2 era, the graphics of the time just didn't show it too well.

It's clear where each planet is despite how different they look.  As for the enemies, I like all of them except the robot dogs. The new robot dogs don't look quite canine enough for me. Too small eyes and heads, a little too upright, a little too one shade shiny. I think the rest are fine, even if some of the blarg have massive heads compared to their bodies."

It seems to me like it's just Batalia with a bit of snow over everything. It has an almost identical fort structure (four towers on the front and a tall round tower in the middle), each of the towers have turrets on them, and if you look on the left of the new screenshot you can see the huge turret the plumber was repairing in the first game.  Here are some screenshots for closer comparison."

The Wrench-only Avoidance Challenge is the only thing I haven't been able to beat so far, and I find it disappointing that all I need to do is figure out how to beat Chainblade on that last round.  Speaking of difficulty modes, they should throw the concept away and go back to the ACT tuning system, which was way more player friendly."
RatchetAndClank,39lpsw,IamAnthonological,6,Fri Jun 12 17:17:35 2015 UTC,"This, I hate having difficulty settings on games. The only thing its for is to add trophy levels.  The game should be as hard as it was meant plain and simple, because when you start to tailor difficulty you are inevitably tailoring gameplay.  The ps2 trilogy did this wonderfully. I never felt totally SOL but there were some hard parts, like b2 brawler without getting hit."
RatchetAndClank,39lpsw,handsupdb,2,Sat Jun 13 13:45:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I don't mind it in games I can easily change my difficulty in, like Halo. But in a long story driven game like Ratchet and Clank, asking the player to choose a setting that they may not truly understand is just going to screw them over in the long run. How is someone supposed to know how easy ""Easy"" mode is, and how hard ""Hard"" mode is, when it's so different from game to game? It's just bad design if you ask me."
RatchetAndClank,39lpsw,IamAnthonological,2,Sat Jun 13 14:49:52 2015 UTC,wha? Well this is the first time I've heard people hate on difficulty modes like this. I think they're awesome if done well and just give players more choice and how they want to experience the game.
RatchetAndClank,39lpsw,IamAnthonological,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:38:07 2015 UTC,"As I said, it's okay in games like Halo where I can change my difficulty every 15 minutes, or in a game like Devil May Cry where the entire point of the game is supposed to be ridiculously challenging and hard.  In a game like Ratchet and Clank though, it's a story driven game where you can't easily change your difficulty. This means that players have to make an arbitrary choice that they may not understand when they start the game. Legendary in Halo, Hell and Hell in DMC, and Hardcore in Ratchet and Clank all mean very different things, so there's no way for someone to know what the right difficulty for them is.  Sure, difficulty modes allow the player extra choice, but what do you get out of choosing your difficulty? You don't get a dynamic difficulty system that adjusts perfectly to your skill level and challenges you, that's for sure."
RatchetAndClank,39lpsw,Kekoa_ok,3,Sun Jun 14 09:22:49 2015 UTC,Deadlocks last difficulty mode though
RatchetAndClank,39lpsw,IamAnthonological,2,Fri Jun 12 18:24:35 2015 UTC,"Speaking of difficulty modes, they should throw the concept away and go back to the ACT tuning system, which was way more player friendly.   Wait huh. I'm confused at what you're trying to say. I know this is probably wrong, but what i'm getting from that part is ""they should throw away the concept of difficulty modes and go back to CiT's difficulty modes"""
RatchetAndClank,39lpsw,Half-Shot,3,Fri Jun 12 17:30:20 2015 UTC,"No, I meant Insomniac's Active Challenge Tuning (ACT) system, which was featured in the PS2 trilogy and possibly Tools of Destruction. It could learn what your skill level was as you played, it was able to tell what types of challenges you were good at and what types you were bad at, and adjusted each segment accordingly.  It was a lot better than having set difficulty modes, at least in my opinion."
RatchetAndClank,39lpsw,IamAnthonological,3,Fri Jun 12 17:46:57 2015 UTC,I love the idea behind that system. It's not so rigid and it scales well if you are extremely bad/good.

I can spend hours there looking at all the cool objects and commentary, but as time passes, I begin to realize that I really am all alone there. Spooky.  It's mainly Going Commando's museum that freaked me out the most. Dimly lit, dark grey with that ominous sound track. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the GC museum, but I just can't seem to shake that somber feeling after spending several hours there."
RatchetAndClank,39k9gi,Sword_Frog,4,Fri Jun 12 12:32:49 2015 UTC,"I was so happy when i found the secret entrance to the R&C2 Museum, after ""glitching""? out of the map by the rails to fly down to the secret place, and then finding a way into the house. That is for sure one of the best easter eggs in all gaming in my opinion."
RatchetAndClank,39k9gi,HPA97,3,Tue Jun 16 12:05:43 2015 UTC,"The GC Museum has always been my favorite and I totally agree about the ominous sountrack.

RatchetAndClank,39fa1m,_Fiku,12,Thu Jun 11 09:37:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most of the Future series weapons are really getting old, and that would normally be fine since I want the oldest weapons in the game, but the weapons from the Future games got recycled to death in the Future series itself, we don't need them recycled another time. Mr. Zurkon is really getting old, he even uses the same dialogue still.  Hopefully the majority will be new and classic weapons, and not Future weapons. The Pixelizer is awesome, and the Pyrocitor looks great."
RatchetAndClank,39fa1m,IamAnthonological,11,Thu Jun 11 09:59:28 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda annoyed that they've gone and made the bouncer, an original Ratchet and Clank weapon, part of a pre-order bonus. That's just ridiculous. I hate it when companies go and lock content that can change how the game is played behind pre-order."
RatchetAndClank,39fa1m,Rothver,12,Thu Jun 11 12:37:11 2015 UTC,"especially since the bouncer pretty much broke ratchet and clank GC. The things I really liked about the original series were:   Throughout the game weapons didn't lose relevance or usefulness (and neither did the power) The wrench was always pretty useful Pretty much every level had a different enemy Qwark was overtly conniving and built up to be some huge untouchable public figure  Ratchet and clank had to learn to settle their differences  There was a feeling that every bolt you collected mattered   and 7. There was no groovitron... that thing is getting old. But on the plus side, it's not like we actually have to use it in game."
RatchetAndClank,39fa1m,ggop_,11,Thu Jun 11 12:55:09 2015 UTC,"Okay, as someone that's played GC and UYA several times over, some of those statements are pretty wrong.   Try using the Lancer/Heavy Lancer in late game GC, or the Shock Cannon in late game UYA. They lose a lot of effectiveness over the course of their games, and so do most other early game weapons.  Wrench damage was upgraded each time you find a new wrench in GC, and I believe wrench damage was tied to nanotech in UYA (and also ToD and ACiT). It's not that the wrench was 'always' useful in the old games, you just used it less. UYA was definitely the start of each level no longer having an unique enemy - Tyhrranoids, which more or less had three skins, and those trooper-looking enemies that started appearing on Daxx. Together they made up the large majority of enemies in the game - only levels such as Florana, Annihilation Nation, and Qwark's Hideout had unique enemies. Again, Qwark's lack of intelligene started in UYA, not the Future series. He was pretty obviously an idiot in UYA, not really all that conniving. Just lucky. By GC, R&C had pretty much already settled their differences - they only really needed to do it in R&C1. This is something that's true - in R&C1, 2 and 3 bolts mattered a lot more. Unless you did everything, and then some more, you could not every single weapon in a single playthrough. In ACiT and ITN, you easily get enough bolts for every weapon. ToD's kind of middling and weird with this - some playthroughs it gives you enough bolts for every weapon, some others it doesn't. Also agreeing here - weapons like Combuster, Groovitron, and Zurkon are getting old at this point. And thus, boring.    A lot of the stuff you complain about actually started in the original series - well, UYA mostly, but that's still part of the original series."
RatchetAndClank,39fa1m,Trijhak,2,Thu Jun 11 14:15:08 2015 UTC,"That's true but mid-game and late-game weapons stayed very effective for all of the game. Of course your starting weapons got weaker to teach you about switching, but they knew back then that they should also give you a large pool of weapons that are always useful. The Wrench really is super powerful on PS2, Insomniac constantly had to figure out ways to make their focus testers stop using the wrench, and it's been nerfed big time over the years. UYA started to reuse enemies a lot, but you'll find that the majority of levels still introduce a new enemy. Agreed, but Qwark has been seriously flanderized since UYA. They need to dial it back to where he was just lazy, overconfident, and clumsy, not cowardly, narcissistic, and idiotic. Pretty much. The opening cutscene of R&C 2 shows them getting along like old buddies. Yeah, grinding was necessary in the early games, and you really thought about purchases, plus there were less bolts coming at you, so it was more blatant and satisfying to see them fly at you, and it was a real treat to slam the box breaker and see a ton of bolts fly at you in slow motion. Now that feeling goes away because there are almost always that many bolts on screen. Yeah, I've expressed this opinion myself.   It may have started in UYA, but most of these things weren't fully implemented until Deadlocked or after."
RatchetAndClank,39fa1m,IamAnthonological,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:42:47 2015 UTC,"Mid-game weapons are still useful at the end of the game in the Future Series, so frankly I have no idea what you're talking about. If anything the starting weapons in ACiT and ITN actually stay useful until the very end much more so than weapons in GC or UYA. Costructo Bomb was really powerful at V5 even at the end, and the Sonic Eruptor didn't lose usefulness either. The focus of the series is on the weapons - the wrench may be iconic and signature tool, but if people could use the wrench all the time they'd never use the weapons. The wrench is adequate enough for small enemies as is. Florana's enemies: unique. Marcadia's enemies: not unique. Annihilation Nation: unique. Aquatos' enemies: unique. Tyhrranosis: not unique. Daxx: not unique. Obani System: not unique. Blackwater City: not unique. Holostar Studios: Unique, but only if you count the Clank section. Obani Draco: not unique. Zeldrin Starport: not unique. Metropolis: Not unique. Crash site: not unique. Aridia: not unique. Qwark's Hideout: unique. Starship under attack: not unique. Koros: not unique. Mylon: Not unique. For the record, I don't count the various Tyhrranoid reskins as unique enemies - you have four variations, the 'blue-grey' tyrhannoids at the start of the game, the brown tyhrranoids in the middle of the game, the robotic tyhrranoids after Metropolis, the slightly more darker and robotic tyrhannoids on Mylon. Mostly the only thing different is the skins they have, the damage they do and the health they have. Models and behaviour are more or less the same. So, only a few planets have unique enemies.    If there's one thing I wish it's that getting the RYNO should be harder. ToD and beyond made it pathetically easy since all you have to do is find like several holo-plans and that's it. IMO it should  take defeating a few secret bosses, like the one on Oozla in R&C2 and at least 1 million bolts."
RatchetAndClank,39fa1m,Trijhak,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:51:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely not so in Tools of Destruction, every weapon is nearly useless against a Cragmite by the end of the game, running out of ammo is the main problem when fighting Tachyon. As for A Crack in Time, I think they improved it, but a lot of weapons go weak quickly just like ToD, and only become useful again when at V5 if you can be bothered to get them there. Sonic Eruptor was awful in my experience, even when fully charged it does practically nothing and just leaves you open between shots. There's a difference between weapons being advantageous over the wrench and the wrench being impractical against anything but small swarmer enemies. The wrench is still one of the weapons, and it should be treated that way. Daxx is unique, and I would argue that the Obani System technically does introduce new enemies, even if they are ripped from R&C 1. I'm also fairly certain Zeldrin Starport introduces a new enemy, and Koros definitely does. Metropolis also introduces a tank, but I'll agree with you that it's almost all Tyhrranoids.   I don't know, I've always preferred just buying the RYNO, getting holoplans was an okay idea, but it possible to unlock it too quickly and too easily as you said. I like your idea of defeating bosses as well as paying, that'd be alright with me."
RatchetAndClank,39fa1m,IamAnthonological,4,Thu Jun 11 21:22:38 2015 UTC,"Insomniac have assured us that the Bouncer is only a pre-order bonus because it won't be finished in time for the final build to be submitted to Sony (otherwise there would be an awkward period where the Programmers and Artists have nothing to do). Still, you have a point, they should have chosen one of the Future weapons as a preorder bonus, and not an original trilogy weapon."
RatchetAndClank,39fa1m,IamAnthonological,7,Thu Jun 11 13:30:12 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely not liking it - the Combustor, Groovitron, Zurkon have been really overused. They made sense in the PS3 games, but here? All three made their first appearance eight years ago! And then there's the Warmonger - seriously Insomniac, why? The Devastator was like everywhere in R&C1 promotions originally, so it feels wrong to have something other than the Devastator...  I hope at least we have the Visibomb Gun and Tesla Claw back.  Also, I'm pretty sure Gadgetron isn't going to be absent: in the game trailer, if you pause at the right moment, you can see doors with a 'G' on a gear, kind of like a logo on them, which is very reminiscent of the Testing Dummy areas on Kalebo III in R&C1.  EDIT: Here. That logo looks much more like a Gadgetron logo than a Grummelnet Logo, IMO."
RatchetAndClank,39fa1m,Trijhak,4,Thu Jun 11 14:19:11 2015 UTC,"I really hope we get the Glove of Doom/Agents of Doom back, I just loved those little guys. Also the signature Bomb Glove, though pretty weak, would be a good item for the nostalgia, ya know?"
RatchetAndClank,39fa1m,LordDragolith,3,Thu Jun 11 22:56:25 2015 UTC,Here is more proof. The vendor is most DEFINITELY gadgetron. (Bottom right)
RatchetAndClank,39fa1m,JadedDarkness,4,Fri Jun 12 01:43:19 2015 UTC,The Groovitron is alright IMO considering that it was a weapon originally designed for RaC1.

RatchetAndClank,39fa1m,res30stupid,4,Fri Jun 12 09:00:28 2015 UTC,"I thought some of the weapons in the original game were terrible, at least compared to later additions to the series.

RatchetAndClank,39fa1m,tigranater,4,Thu Jun 11 15:29:37 2015 UTC,Gadgetron will be in the game. You can see a vendor at the end of the Aleero City gameplay.

All developers read online forums like Reddit and Facebook, and if we're vocal about not being happy with the Future weapons being recycled yet again and Gadgetron not being featured heavily enough, we can be assured that it will be fixed.  Also, you didn't like the Constructo weapons? I thought that was the best weapon upgrade mechanic in all the Future games, and I'm disappointed they never featured it more heavily. Definitely better than Raritanium upgrades."
RatchetAndClank,39geee,IamAnthonological,2,Thu Jun 11 15:43:38 2015 UTC,"That's true, but if they're not planning on taking the bad weapons out, we should complain about it here and now, instead of when the game comes out and we find out they weren't placeholders after all.   Absolutely. I just don't want people treating it as final. We should be giving our suggestions while they can still do something about it. It is the sad nature of a console game that once it has been made, it's very hard to backtrack.   Also, you didn't like the Constructo weapons? I thought that was the best weapon upgrade mechanic in all the Future games, and I'm disappointed they never featured it more heavily. Definitely better than Raritanium upgrades.   Each to their own. Personally I found the weapons too bland. R&C2 made collecting those platinum bolts useful with the mods. Raritanium was a bit of a joke with how common it was by R&C:ToD"
RatchetAndClank,39geee,IamAnthonological,2,Thu Jun 11 15:52:37 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely, of course nothing about what we've seen should be, since it's gameplay footage, not even a playable demo.  Yeah, I can see the problem you have, the system wasn't implemented across the board, only on generic weapons like ""Pistol"", ""Bomb"", ""Shotgun"", which was a huge weakness. And yeah, R&C2 and R&C3 had simple, but perfect upgrade and mod mechanics, and while I think the Constructo system was a nice spin on it, they really shouldn't have changed it to begin with. The thing with Raritanium was that it was really common compared to the earlier games, but it wasn't common enough to get all the important upgrades in time for the end of ToD."
RatchetAndClank,39geee,icyflamez96,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:21:48 2015 UTC,"I'm sure we haven't seen all of the weapons, but Insmonac wont be adding any new weapoons to the game in that time frame I don't think.

RatchetAndClank,39geee,icyflamez96,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:22:57 2015 UTC,Whys that? A year is a long time. It seems like they have made a good start on the engine and a few of the levels.

RatchetAndClank,39g1zj,LordDragolith,9,Thu Jun 11 14:04:47 2015 UTC,"Has it been confirmed that the full game will run at 30fps? I really give zero shits about it myself, but I guess it would be nice if it was 60.  I've said this several times and I'll say it again here: The main thing that I dislike about what I see is the recycled weapons. The weapons have always been a major part of what makes R&C good and unique, but since the series came to PS3 we've been seeing the same weapons over and over. The Combustor, Fusion Bomb, Mr Zurkon, Groovitron, Warmonger... I'm sick of the same weapons game after game.  I do realise that the weapons are always quite similar even when they do change (blaster-lancer-n60 storm, blitz gun-shock cannon, etc) but at least there's some difference, especially visual difference."
RatchetAndClank,39g1zj,KingGumboot,3,Thu Jun 11 14:25:28 2015 UTC,"I must admit is isn't confirmed, but from what we have seen, it's  pretty  near completion and to change it so suddenly would be a huge delay. As for the weapons, i think we all just want to hear the Blaster shooting again! And why not the devastator you know?"
RatchetAndClank,39g1zj,SNLThe_Office,2,Fri Jun 12 01:04:30 2015 UTC,Didn't a spokesman from Insomniac say that A Crack in Time would be their last 60fps game? He said that the extra work it took to have it run at 60 didn't positively affect sales or review scores. TotalBiscuit shows the quote in his video about frame rates.  https://youtu.be/eXJh9ut2hrc
RatchetAndClank,39g1zj,SNLThe_Office,2,Fri Jun 12 03:24:59 2015 UTC,"Well he said Probably, although all the games since have been 30.  It annoys me that the reason for not being 60fps is because it ""Doesn't affect sales or reviews"". Like, it sounds like they're making it for the money, and not listening to what we like or don't like."
RatchetAndClank,39g1zj,Half-Shot,2,Fri Jun 12 03:38:26 2015 UTC,"I agree. A Crack in Time was so smooth at 60fps. It not being at 60fps affects my purchasing decision. I don't have a PS4 and I don't really want to fork over $400 for a PS4 just to play R&C games at 30fps. The new game looks good but not THAT good, especially with all of the problems mentioned in this thread. If I wanted more combuster I'd go and platinum A Crack in Time again. At least it would be in a buttery-smooth 60fps."
RatchetAndClank,39g1zj,Will_billy,3,Fri Jun 12 05:48:19 2015 UTC,I dunno really. I've been a PC gamer pretty much post PS2 and it does make a difference in my eyes. I still love the other factors of ratchet but I would rather they cut back on the visuals a bit if it meant I could play it smoothly. Ratchet is one of those titles where you want every animation and movement to be as smooth as possible.
RatchetAndClank,39g1zj,_Fiku,5,Fri Jun 12 13:16:19 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit disappointed that they switched from a high-ammo flamethrower that burns it quickly to one that has a few shots that last ~3 seconds. That just isn't as fun! Also, I'm really disappointed they went with the combustor and not the blaster :/ The blaster was so much more fun!"
RatchetAndClank,39g1zj,Will_billy,2,Thu Jun 11 22:56:51 2015 UTC,Same. I always liked the weapons having high ammo :/

RatchetAndClank,39g1zj,_Fiku,3,Fri Jun 12 13:18:58 2015 UTC,"New Sequences and Mini-Games: I look forward to Star Fox-esque shooting segments in the ship, and I really look forward to hoverboard racing in the rain. Arena combat will hopefully be really special for this game.  Pixelizer: It looks like a fantastic weapon, very visually impressive and looks very powerful and reliable. I look forward to taking it for a spin.  1080p 30fps: I know the PS4 is a monster when it comes to 60fps games, but this will never hit full 60fps by Q2 2016. Insomniac are not Naughty Dog (as close as they were back in the day), they are not even an first party Sony dev team, and they've spent a lot of time working with the Xbox One instead up until now.  I agree, Ratchet plays much better in 60fps, and it should be something of an embarrassment that Insomniac still refuse to make any more 60fps games (we get that the general public don't care or notice, but please, the hardcore gamers really care about it). But I think 30fps is excusable in this specific case, as it allows the game as much legroom as possible to emulate the visuals of the prerendered movie, and it's worked out well for them. Hopefully there will be an ""Unlock Frame Rate"" option like inFAMOUS Second Son.  Particle Effects: I agree, a lot of them are lousy, especially the Pyrocitor effects, there are a lot of times where I can tell it's a bunch of sprites and not actual fire.  Animation: Ratchet's animations look a little more faithful to the PS2 games, but they haven't changed that much, which is disappointing, but there is loads of smooth animation and movement on screen, and I'm impressed.  Background work: Lazy?! Are you kidding? These are the most detailed and active backgrounds I've seen in the entire Ratchet and Clank series, Metropolis looks amazing, and all of the levels look very atmospheric and creative, while also being faithful to the original.  Gadgetron: It'd be a shame if they didn't appear, and didn't continue Grummelnet's ""trend"" of giving you a cute cartoon every time you buy a new weapon. But they probably will be in the game.  Future Weapons: They've got to go, the Groovitron is the only one I'm happy to see. Especially Mr. Zurkon, who has been milked to death.  I just hope the weapon upgrades aren't too convoluted or anything, I like the Going Commando and Up Your Arsenal system, and the Constructo guns in A Crack in Time were interesting, but Raritanium upgrading sucked, and they need to get rid of that.  Multiplayer: Where's my damn online play? I'm begging you Insomniac, I need to shoot my friends in Ratchet and Clank PS4."

RatchetAndClank,39g1zj,icyflamez96,2,Fri Jun 12 23:06:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah dude  thanks for the response, I will start from the bottom:   Multiplayer should not be in here A) because ratchet and clank is a very single player game, and they found that out quickly (A41, Q-Force). And B) They absolutely need to focus on core elements to the story instead of multiplayer IMO. Weapon upgrades will  HOPEFULLY be somewhat similar to 2 or 3, either with raritanium or  without (lock-on mod was great). Looks like we have spotted Gadgetron thanks tigranater I understand that the background work does look better, but it is still VERY lazy, i will edit the main text to show  a comparison between Crack in time and this. I agree on all other fronts!  Although unlocking the frame-rate leads to increased frame drops, a  solid 30 is nice, but 60 is better."
RatchetAndClank,39g1zj,Gumball_Machine,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:32:01 2015 UTC,"Multiplayer: Yeah, but Up Your Arsenal didn't suffer too much from multiplayer, and considering that Insomniac is putting both their studios and a more than the usual year into this game, I think they could make a nice multiplayer mode, or at the very least, implement co-op. Sure, they really should put the single player ahead, but I don't think it's unreasonable to expect multiplayer integrated into this game with so much time and resources being put into it.  Weapon Upgrades: Yeah, we can only hope. I'm sure they'll give us a decent system.  Backgrounds: Oh that, that's just a consequence of using a fog effect to simulate atmospheric perspective and depth of field together, which is an artistic choice on their part. GTA V does the same thing, and it's buildings are still textured if you turn off DOF and zoom in on them. I think Metropolis is still quite detailed, especially during the gameplay segments we saw where there is less DOF. But I agree with you that some places misuse or overuse it, like the Blargian Snagglebeast cave. But overall, there seems to be little reusing of assets, lots of detail and animation, and it's still faithful to the original.  Frame rate: Yeah, unlocked frame rates scare some people, but I liked it in inFAMOUS, you may drop to 35fps any time you're on top of a building, but it's worth it when the combat is in the 40-50fps range."

RatchetAndClank,39g1zj,res30stupid,4,Fri Jun 12 08:43:15 2015 UTC,"My primary concern is with the Future series and the huge story arc of Ratchet trying to find the Lombaxes. Is this a one off game, or afterward will they pick up the Future story arc and continue that? I think it's kind of frustrating if they just forget about that huge story arc, that I personally felt very invested in."

RatchetAndClank,39aqzf,Mayal0,7,Wed Jun 10 15:16:09 2015 UTC,"I'm actually glad it's coming out next spring, all this being an adult stuff has taken its toll on my wallet and I need some time to save up. I remember when the PS2 came out, RC1 was the first game I ever got for the PS2 and was the only one for many months. I didn't even have a memory card yet so I would have to replay from the beginning every day. I remember being so excited to come home from school and play some Ratchet and Clank. That excitement stayed with me all throughout the PS2 series. I even got my hands on Going Mobile and would power through that game daily on the school bus.  I was unable to afford a PS3 for quite a few years after it came out so I was unable to play those games until about the end of 2011 when I got my first PS3, around the time that All 4 One came out. Honestly, I only got the PS3 for Rock Band and to continue the RC story I had loved so much. I played them in order, as you should, over the next few months. Tools of Destruction, Quest for Booty, A Crack In Time. I tried to play All 4 One and Full Frontal Assault but school and other distractions (if you know what I mean) got in the way.   A year and a half later I managed to beat All 4 One just in time for Into The Nexus. Having been disappointed at the lack of a traditional Ratchet and Clank game, I picked up Into The Nexus on day one and beat it the next day due to having some exams at that time.  I did manage to pick up a Vita for a short time to play the PSP games. When I realized I couldn't afford the Vita, I sold it. But not after beating each of the PSP games at least once.  Now that a new traditional style Ratchet and Clank game is coming out and I have since graduated from college, I would be so disappointed to not be able to play the new game around launch. Especially one that looks this good."

They chose to use weapons like the combuster, but that is a Grummelnet weapon and not a gadgetron weapon. At one point there is a giant Megacorp billboard on the side of a building (Megacorp only operates in the Bogon galaxy).  There is also Quark mentioning the hall of heroes, that was only ever included in ToD but I guess it would still make sense if that was there in the first game."

RatchetAndClank,39aqzf,LombaxTheGreat,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:45:51 2015 UTC,Played all the ratchet and clank and currently part of PCMR. The only reason i own a ps4 is for this game. 30 fps or not the game is more beautiful than most and is totally justified. Insomniac is a god tier developer and if they feel 30 fps is what this need then thats what it needs.  Don't get me wrong here I wish it was 60fps as with all my PC games but the ps3 r&c games run smooth enough to the point of where I can deal with 30fps and 720p.

Ratchet and Clank and Resistance have been 30fps for a while now, and Sunset Overdrive was also 30fps, and all of these games were still a joy to play despite how insane they can get. I know how choppy 30fps is, but it really is your loss if you miss out on this too."
RatchetAndClank,39d9sg,DrDialUp,3,Thu Jun 11 00:07:08 2015 UTC,"Nah, he was definitely way too mean in R&C1. You have a valid point though, Ratchet has made a very awkward transition from asshole to pushover as the years have passed, and I'd like them to dial it back to when he was still a badass like in Going Commando and Up Your Arsenal.  Still in the context of what we know about the film, everything we've seen is very in-character for this version of Ratchet."
RatchetAndClank,39d9sg,IamAnthonological,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:34:14 2015 UTC,"He was definitely a bit to harsh of a character in R&C1, but I kinda think that his change was brought more about by the direction the design team choose to take him. As the games progressed, he seemed to get a more 'pure' look to him. If you compared this to Azimoth, you can see how the design team pulled him. Also we saw a really fast transformation of him just in R&C1, as he went from his harsher personality to a helping person (still the same snippy attitude though). And from the gameplay and small snip-its of dialogue that I've heard from him, he seems to have a similar personality to the future series, but that could have been at a further point in the story."
RatchetAndClank,39d9sg,Rothver,2,Thu Jun 11 12:46:15 2015 UTC,"If anything, I think it's going to be the opposite, I'm almost certain Ratchet is going to start out as a shy, but ambitious Luke Skywalker type, and is going to become more serious and confident as the game progresses. But yeah, as obvious as it was to me that Alister Azimuth was the villain, he had a very smooth and convincing transition from ""helpful Lombax mentor and father figure"" to ""desperate failure seeking redemption at any cost."" I'm sure the writers can pull off similar character development in Ratchet for this game too."
RatchetAndClank,39d9sg,IamAnthonological,3,Thu Jun 11 13:42:51 2015 UTC,"I don't like the future games because he's not snarky, he's too nice of a person for killing enemy robots and species, like, it just doesn't fit in my opinion.   And you CANNOT have a nice Ratchet in Ratchet Deadlocked, so I'm assuming that's not gonna happen.   Going Commando/Up Your Arsenal is where they should've stayed with character development. It doesn't make sense for him to become a nicer guy, this isn't Jak finally finding Light Eco, this is Ratchet killing more and more, and seeing more and more bad things happen."
RatchetAndClank,39d9sg,_Fiku,2,Thu Jun 11 09:33:37 2015 UTC,"I think the main problem is no conflict between the characters. The only flaw anyone has is Quark being overconfident. They've made it a bit too kid friendly for my taste. Even if you look at the character designs they're a lot more rounded out with non threatening shapes.  I know people hated the conflict between Ratchet and Clank in the first game but the game was about their friendship mostly, hence the name of the game. While Ratchet was a bit mean I don't think his snarkiness should have been completely nerfed."
RatchetAndClank,39d9sg,ineverwanted,2,Fri Jun 12 08:34:25 2015 UTC,It made sense though. Clank did blackmail ratchet into finding quark from the start of the game since he functioned as a robotic ignition system and was the only one who could start the ship.  I think its good that there was conflict between the characters but they overcame it to be friends at the end of the game

I haven't played after ToD so I don't know what happens in Nexus (apparently something cliffhangery), but I don't know why they'd reimagine the series for one game, then go right back to the original series. This seems like an attempt to sell R&C to a younger generation. The people who get it on the PS4 might not have PS3s to play the other games. And they wouldn't know what's going on if Insomniac makes a Future game on the PS4 and half the characters are brand new to them. I'd rather they retell the entire original series up to Future, adding enough new stuff in to keep the older players interested. I think they could streamline it all into 2 or 3 sequels."

RatchetAndClank,399h7s,handsupdb,0,Wed Jun 10 13:50:49 2015 UTC,"Right, but iirc (and for this series in particular) they tend not to backwards develop games.  A game spanning this generation gap would seriously suffer on one end or the other. If it was designed on the PS3 and ported up to the PS4, it wouldn't come close to using the PS4 for full potential. However, if it was developed for the PS4 and backported to PS3, the game would have to be so crippled that it would be something totally different.  Remember games like rock band? Where they made it for tons of different consoles? My experience on PS2 was bitter shit compared to what my friends got on PS3 or 360.  Offtopic: If they develop solely for the PS4 there's one things I pray for: Every single bolt actually counts as 1 bolt. So when you bash open a crate for 1100 bolts in the late game: 1100 bolts actually fly out. Make it rain, or should I say hail?"

RatchetAndClank,3942pr,sarcastamasta,4,Wed Jun 10 23:39:59 2015 UTC,"Great game, beautiful new graphics, fun new weapons, same gameplay you all know and love. But... In my personal opinion, it's a very, say, awkward game. It felt a lot like the first Ratchet game on PS2, a game that kicks off a great series, but experiments with things and doesn't quite hit perfection yet. The new character designs took a lot of me getting used to, especially Qwark, who's face reminds me of a muppet for some reason. They added items which obviously didn't make the cut in future installments, and all the sixaxis implementations. And the whole Ratchet and Clank argument for half the game repeats itself from R&C1 which I was not a fan of. But that's just a few things that I felt didn't sit well with the game that ACIT fixed and perfected. It's still an amazing game nonetheless and a good kickoff into the next generation. I'll vote 2."
RatchetAndClank,3942pr,CrackaBox,3,Tue Jun 9 14:12:42 2015 UTC,"Tools of destruction was my favourite game of all time.

This was the first PS3 game I had played and was leagues ahead of everything I expected, I was never able to replicate this experience. The vibrancy, the fluidity, the gameplay and story all made for the perfect way to start the next-gen."
RatchetAndClank,3942pr,TailsP,2,Tue Jun 9 03:15:53 2015 UTC,It's my favorite game! I must have replayed it about  20 times and know it like the back of my hand!

The weapons were cool, the visuals were fantastic, and the soundtrack was pretty great too. The best part of the game is how smooth it runs and feels. To go along with what critics said about it when it came out, it really does feel like you're playing a pixar movie."
RatchetAndClank,3942pr,IamAnthonological,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:49:54 2015 UTC,"It's somewhat nostalgic to me, since it was one of the first PS3 games I ever played back in 2007, and it blew my mind back then. But now that I own the game, I don't think it compares to the PS2 games, the controls and animations feel clunky and the weapons are incredibly weak, which makes combat unsatisfying. The villains and new characters also suck in my opinion, Apogee is sort of generic, Tachyon is a bad ripoff of Ripto from Spyro, and the Pirates get old really quickly. And as you said, GrummelNet is terrible (except for the Commercials in ACiT).  But I don't really hate Tools of Destruction, just like I don't hate Ratchet and Clank 1. Insomniac have always been like that, where they need time to adjust to a new platform or new franchise. The graphics are amazing for an early PS3 game, the worlds are just as atmospheric as ever, and the soundtrack is great. I also love that Clank started to have a larger role in this game, he mostly got pushed aside on PS2, a huge weakness of those otherwise perfect games.  Overall: Tools of Destruction still rates highly as a game, just not a Ratchet and Clank game.  No. 3 please."

The early games were more funny than serious, so I feel like Nefarious fit in very well. And his return in ACIT was great. To try and reverse time to let every villain succeed, you need someone crazy enough to try, and Dr. N is all kinds of crazy! I'm sure we were all surprised at his return and playability in A4O, but if you're gonna make a spin off game, why not use one of the most loved characters in the franchise? As far as boss battles, I thought UYA was a lot harder than Drek and the Protopet. ACIT was quite a challenge too, but wasn't even the final boss, but still tough. And after the lengths he went through in ACIT, him possibly turning good in A4O seems a little silly, but I'll buy it. All in all, one of the best characters in the franchise. I'll vote 2 as well."
RatchetAndClank,38lpml,CrackaBox,2,Fri Jun 5 13:56:56 2015 UTC,"I do like Nefarious' character but I wish he had better dialogue like Drek. He just feels like a good Saturday morning cartoon villain that you're supposed to take seriously. My main issue is that he just doesn't have as many memorable quotes and sometimes feels wasted. His opposite Drek was nothing but entertaining on every quote but was missing in uniqueness. I think his best moments were on the vid comics with Qwark as his nemesis, and I like the chemistry with him and Lawrence, but if only he had a few one liners here and there to really give him flavor.  Next discussion I vote Captain Qwark"
RatchetAndClank,38lpml,IamAnthonological,2,Fri Jun 5 06:13:38 2015 UTC,"I think he's more evil than Drek since Nefarious actually had loads of people killed and then tried turning everyone he didn't kill into robots against their will, he turned loads of innocent civilians on Kerwan into robots in fact. Drek just destroyed the planets, and left the people stranded without a home.  Nefarious is definitely one of the funniest video game villains ever though, and I love him to death. His boss fight in Up Your Arsenal is also pretty damn challenging and well made, though it's not the most memorable.

Sure, story tension is one thing, but does it really affect you that much? (In emotional and gripping games, yes, but that's not the point.) This is why I feel that this battle worked so well. It had story tension AND gameplay tension, which  channels the story tension towards the players, which immerses them in the end-of-the-world scenario.

I didn't think it was as hard as some people say, but it definitely keeps you on your toes and gives off a great vibe. If you're good with a tesla claw, it's not that bad. On another note, I don't mind Drek having pupils in the upcoming movie. It's supposed to be a cinematic experience so real eyes provides more facial expression than blank blue ones. That's just my take on it I suppose. I'm voting 2."
RatchetAndClank,387qdh,Virulan,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:33:04 2015 UTC,"I remember when I was a kid, I couldn't beat him with the regular weapons, so I ended up grinding bolts for the RYNO.  Just recently, I did it without the RYNO for the first tiime."
RatchetAndClank,387qdh,McCatson,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:21:15 2015 UTC,"Drek is love, Drek is life.  I still haven't actually finished the first game because I never actually managed to beat him when I played it.   I plan to get the game again when possible so I can beat him (plus because the original was pretty fun and I just want to replay it..)  1"

RatchetAndClank,385pvd,Minihood1997,8,Tue Jun 2 01:48:45 2015 UTC,"Mr. Zurkon is amazing and is a well deserved staple weapon of the series. It improves a lot from the synthenoids and acts as a second gun to make Ratchet feel even more powerful. And you can't help but love those quotes. Not only do they help to humanize Mr. Zurkon and make him feel like more than a generic drone, they continue the series' tradition of hilarious dark humor. I can imagine how fun it must have been for the Insomniac writers to come up with these. ""Why do you hide, stupid aliens? Mr. Zurkon only wishes to kill you!"" Voting 3."
RatchetAndClank,385pvd,sarcastamasta,4,Tue Jun 2 03:03:28 2015 UTC,Give us drek!!  3

RatchetAndClank,380tzu,Echowhisker,8,Mon Jun 1 00:48:15 2015 UTC,"I personally never had a problem with this weapon. It can take out most enemies in any area with relative ease, and it isn't too hard to control. The only problem for me is that it had a tendency to get stuck on walls and in corners, but with range upgrades, that problem became a benefit, as it could deal damage, but you didn't have to control it. One last thing, you can catch the tornado on the launcher and take it with you so you don't have to steer it.  I'll vote 3"
RatchetAndClank,380tzu,theweegeeofdoom,5,Mon Jun 1 05:35:37 2015 UTC,"Let's start with the white elephant in the room: sixaxis. No one liked it. I always sit with my controller angled back so I'd have to sit forward to use it correctly which I wasnt a fan of. It took a while for me to find out you can turn off sixaxis in the options menu. About the tornado launcher itself, I didn't like it that much and barely used it. Functionally speaking, it was kind of similar to the hoverbomb gun in GC, and I didn't even use that weapon correctly. I just used it as a power weapon and shot straight forward at enemies, which was much more efficient than guiding the bombs around. The tornado launcher forces you to guide the tornado around, which isn't preferable to using a quicker weapon to do the job immediately. I guess this was Insomniac's way of using the PS3's new sixaxis however they could. Fell flat for me. I'm voting 2. I think voting to talk about Mr. Zurkon would just turn into a favorite quote thread (which I'm totally fine with;)"
RatchetAndClank,380tzu,sarcastamasta,3,Mon Jun 1 02:54:37 2015 UTC,3  Tornado is ass.
RatchetAndClank,380tzu,Betruul,2,Mon Jun 1 04:16:36 2015 UTC,"This weapon is very hard to control properly, which made me use it less, and unless you upgraded it (which I didn't because I didn't use it enough) it rapidly became weak in comparison to enemies. Thumbs down. It was a great idea, but execution was not quite there. The dynamo of doom in ACIT was a massive improvement, simply because of how much easier it was to control.   Mr Zurkon."
RatchetAndClank,380tzu,Minihood1997,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:17:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I never liked it. I noticed Tools of Destruction looooved taking advantage of Sixaxis wherever it could. It was kind of annoying."
RatchetAndClank,37vtpq,Echowhisker,7,Sat May 30 20:41:33 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree here!  The plasma beasts were up there with my favourite weapons in the game. They are very powerful, with a shotgun like attack which can deal a good amount of damage to multiple enemies. After Mukow I found their power begin to decline, but up to that point they are awesome. They have pretty good range for stationary turrets, and once you max them out, they are no longer stationary! They can even target aerial enemies.   And they have small purple hulk shorts.  As for the agents of doom, I thought they were fairly useful in the first game, but in UYA they were just too weak to be useful, and they would die before dealing most of their potential damage.  As for next time. My vote goes to 3."
RatchetAndClank,37vtpq,Minihood1997,5,Sat May 30 21:23:44 2015 UTC,"I loved them. They were great whenever I found myself in a bit of a pickle because I would just spam them in my area. That being said those types of weapons have always been my favourite. Agents of doom, mini turret launcher, etc."
RatchetAndClank,37vtpq,MountEverett,4,Sun May 31 02:17:42 2015 UTC,"Sure they were sort of weak, but they were one of the more original weapons in any of the Future games, and I will give the Plasma Beasts credit for that. Besides, it's not like anything in Tools of Destruction was actually a ""tool of destruction"", every weapon in that game became really weak only a couple of levels after you bought it. By the last few levels, every weapon was all but useless, find me one weapon that could take out a Cragmite easily.  1: Agents of Doom, please."
RatchetAndClank,37vtpq,IamAnthonological,3,Sun May 31 09:58:16 2015 UTC,"Same here! I think the Plasma Beasts were a great concept, but just weren't strong enough. And yes, there aren't any weapons that take out a Cragmite easily. Even the RYNO IV wasn't that good. Personally, I just used Mag-Nets along with the Alpha Disruptor in tight spots and the Negotiator.  I'll vote 2. Liking these daily discussions! First time I've commented on one."
RatchetAndClank,37vtpq,theweegeeofdoom,2,Sun May 31 11:38:24 2015 UTC,"I can't even recall what the plasma beasts were like, they're that unmemorable. Clearly I didn't use them any more than necessary :P  I'll also vote for 3"
RatchetAndClank,37vtpq,KingGumboot,1 point,Sat May 30 23:36:27 2015 UTC,"I kinda liked using them at the beginning, but once I started getting better weapons they definitely started collecting dust. They're decently strong, but just way too slow for me. I'll vote 3."
RatchetAndClank,37vtpq,tylerchancellor,1 point,Sun May 31 01:56:32 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I had to look up plasma beasts because I forgot what it did. Every game has one or two weapons that were overshadowed, so this was probably mine from TOD. I definitely enjoyed using it as a quick power weapon, but it just felt weird for some reason. Credit to Insomniac for always trying new weapon designs and keeping what makes R&C so great, this one was just one of the more forgettable ones. Vote 3."
RatchetAndClank,37vtpq,sarcastamasta,1 point,Sun May 31 06:18:04 2015 UTC,"Must disagree - they have an upgrade that allow them to follow you around and, even late game, they can be wonderful for taking out the weaker enemies who form massive crowds. Also, excellent for raritanium grinding."
RatchetAndClank,37pli1,Echowhisker,4,Fri May 29 12:01:39 2015 UTC,"As a young johnny, the fact that the psychic squid thing gave you double bolts was always my favorite. Also, I liked how when you collected bolts in RC1 you really felt like it had more weight than when you collected bolts in later games. Don't know why that is but it was a great feature in the first game."
RatchetAndClank,37pli1,ggop_,4,Fri May 29 14:48:33 2015 UTC,"It's a good-looking level, but I don't really enjoy it much. The orange spiky fish-things are annoying, and you pretty much just spend the whole level fighting them. Blowing up all the underwater crates for the skillpoint is tedious too. I did like the jetfighter though, and you get to buy the awesome Thruster Pack"

Personally I didn't like the zodiac, it was slow to fire, while firing you are locked still, and it only killed enemies on the screen. A yeti could be right behind me and be off screen, it doesn't die when I shoot, and then he jumps me.  I much prefer the RYNO2 since it can kill most enemies in one hit, it fires very fast and rarely misses wasting ammo and you can move and shoot."
RatchetAndClank,37o83r,Minihood1997,2,Fri May 29 07:04:55 2015 UTC,"Probably my favorite gun in UYA, and definitely in my top 5 weapons of the series. Nothing beats shooting off a few in the middle of a match and just watching enemies helplessly get obliterated."
RatchetAndClank,37o83r,xeqtioner0,2,Fri May 29 11:56:43 2015 UTC,"Awesome weapon, it was one of the most fun to use when I first bought it. Watching everything get sucked away into nothingness never gets old. I try to avoid using it too much though, because it's pretty OP and strategic rift placement often means you can just stand there and wait for everything to die"

RatchetAndClank,36r29z,-OrangeLightning4,15,Thu May 21 13:44:00 2015 UTC,"Actually you're wrong, according to what they said on the PS Blog :  - Paul Giamatti as Chairman Drek - John Goodman as Ratchet’s mechanic mentor Grimroth - Bella Thorne as Galactic Ranger Cora - Rosario Dawson as Galactic Ranger support team member Elaris - Sylvester Stallone as Victor Von Ion, Chairman Drek’s villainous lieutenant   So the one you're thinking of seems to be Victor :)"
RatchetAndClank,36r29z,-OrangeLightning4,14,Thu May 21 14:00:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the clarification. I don't really like the fact that Ratchet has a mentor. I always liked that he was self taught. Pulse I feel like Ratchet's mentor is either 1) going to be killed to motivate Ratchet, or 2) going to turn out to be evil to give Ratchet internal conflict."
RatchetAndClank,36r29z,xeqtioner0,9,Thu May 21 14:07:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I totally agree with you. I'm a bit scared that they transformed the storyline too much with all these new characters, but you know, wait and see... :)"
RatchetAndClank,36r29z,res30stupid,6,Thu May 21 14:12:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I have to agree with you as well. Having a mentor kinda plays down the fact that ratchet and the lombaxes in general were engineering geniuses.

At least he has someone caring for him."

RatchetAndClank,36ekww,Wittinator,9,Mon May 18 21:53:21 2015 UTC,I'd say 50/50 - after Umbris he's definitely dealing with resentment and betrayal as it is his main character arc after Quark's betrayal (overcoming his desire for vengeance in order to stop Drek's evil plan) so I'd say they'd tone it down... or at least make it a grudge against Quark.
RatchetAndClank,36ekww,IamAnthonological,2,Mon May 18 22:20:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think he was like that because, as I see it, he's basically just some guy who's thrown into this big adventure to save the galaxy.

I was so hyped for the movie but I want to see a quality movie for what was essentially my favorite series of my childhood up until now. Realistically I've been waiting for this movie since Deadlocked so one more year is just a drop in the bucket.
RatchetAndClank,36bqea,MountEverett,5,Mon May 18 02:55:22 2015 UTC,"The film is completely finished and is no longer in post production. There will be no planned edits of the film at all. The film was marked as completed a few weeks ago and has already screened in its completed form at Cannes Film Festival the other day. People who are praising the delay of the FILM in hopes of a better quality film are dreaming, all those announced voice cast members had been on board for ages, as stated by the facebook page saying it was difficult for them to keep under wraps. I'm assuming the delay is by the hands of Focus after they had picked up the film. The R&C Movie FB page say their reason for delay is due to the huge number of animated films coming this year, and at this point in time, they could only get 2 weeks in cinemas for 2015. If they release next year (which they have slotted for the 29th of April), they can double that time and get a whole month.  Short version: Movie finished. No changes. Waiting for optimal time to release.  The game however, I can agree with, I have doubts the game is anywhere near finished, since its been a known thing for so long and nothing has been revealed. No name, no characters, no stills, nothing."
RatchetAndClank,36bqea,jayzap96,1 point,Tue May 19 09:51:13 2015 UTC,I guess I only addressed the movie but I did mean the movie/game combo. There's already been pre screening so I assume the movie is done.
RatchetAndClank,36bqea,MountEverett,1 point,Wed May 20 03:39:37 2015 UTC,I much prefer them taking their time on this. What would you rather: A movie/game released yesterday but kills the franchise and makes you hate it - or to wait another year for yet another kickass game that  Insomniac always seems to make? I much prefer the latter.
RatchetAndClank,36bqea,GetMoneySmokeWeed,1 point,Wed May 20 16:45:23 2015 UTC,Exactly. Especially if it's going to be the first game in the new console.
RatchetAndClank,36bqea,MountEverett,1 point,Wed May 20 16:49:38 2015 UTC,"I know it's a remake, but I'd so love for it to be continual! As in certain things carrying over, or even a weapon like the RHYNO but one that changes depending on the different parts used to build it. Basically I just would love to see a few things to make each person's game personal."

RatchetAndClank,3699p7,blaisek,3,Sun May 17 13:10:46 2015 UTC,Yeah I've seen this website but I'm looking for figurines
RatchetAndClank,3699p7,Kekoa_ok,5,Sun May 17 13:19:38 2015 UTC,Original toys are pretty hard to come by.  A good statue I think goes for like $200  http://www.gamingheads.com/index.php?option=com_myphp&Itemid=3&product=145
RatchetAndClank,3699p7,EdgeEdgeBatistaBomb,2,Mon May 18 02:04:08 2015 UTC,"Not much is out there in terms of figurines, you got some action figures and the new statue"
RatchetAndClank,3699p7,jayzap96,2,Sun May 17 23:57:06 2015 UTC,"Ever since, I think it was Ratchet Gladiator, I've wanted to be able to buy fuzzy lombax ears. I'm hoping they actually make them to release along with the movie. That would make my day!"
RatchetAndClank,366zhj,flyhalfboy,7,Sat May 16 19:40:19 2015 UTC,I'm really curious to know what unused content lies within the PS2 games. Someone should look into it!
RatchetAndClank,366zhj,shoopdahoop22,3,Sun May 17 01:34:39 2015 UTC,If you get to the Insomniac Museum you get to see what didn't make it into the game.
RatchetAndClank,366zhj,res30stupid,3,Mon May 18 17:33:46 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to find other unused content, such as beta dialogue, unused audio, models, etc.  I found an old R&C demo disc in the closet, so I made it into an ISO and extracted the WAD file. (Think of it as an archive file) When I extracted it, I got around 10 gigabytes of .bin files, so I am currently trying to find a way to open them. Any help would be appreciated!  (I'm starting to sound like Big Al...)"
RatchetAndClank,366zhj,shoopdahoop22,3,Mon May 18 20:17:41 2015 UTC,How could you use the city's defense network to play a video game?!
RatchetAndClank,366zhj,res30stupid,4,Mon May 18 21:18:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, knew most of these things."
RatchetAndClank,366zhj,TheSparrowX,9,Sat May 16 23:31:22 2015 UTC,"Really interesting vid, but Jesus that guy's voice is irritating."
RatchetAndClank,366zhj,JangoF76,2,Sat May 16 20:54:46 2015 UTC,"Did You Know Gaming uses a different guest per video, so he could be replaced if they make a Part 2"
RatchetAndClank,366zhj,res30stupid,3,Sun May 17 21:38:27 2015 UTC,I dunno. Sounds a lot better/less nasally than my voice. >_>
RatchetAndClank,36626i,Blakey001,7,Sat May 16 14:27:19 2015 UTC,"Well yeah.  In the first game, the wrench was nearly as viable as the other guns. In all the games after, I only use the wrench for small groups of swarmers and for breaking crates and the environment. Even in two and three, the wrench is nearly useless on non swarmed enemies a few planets in."
RatchetAndClank,36626i,Minihood1997,3,Sat May 16 15:08:53 2015 UTC,"In Ratchet and Clank 2, I used the wrench a lot. But in three once you upgrade it, its really powerful."
RatchetAndClank,36626i,Kekoa_ok,2,Sun May 17 07:21:29 2015 UTC,"Eh, they all felt the same to me. Enter a group, swing swing, power slam, repeat."
RatchetAndClank,36626i,Minihood1997,1 point,Mon May 18 02:57:54 2015 UTC,"I don't remember the wrench upgrading in UYA.  It did in GC and deadlocked, but not UYA."
RatchetAndClank,36626i,IamAnthonological,1 point,Thu May 28 07:27:07 2015 UTC,Would upgrade every time your Health leveled up. You never got a new wrench.
RatchetAndClank,36626i,xeqtioner0,2,Thu May 28 08:03:44 2015 UTC,"It probably isn't as powerful, Insomniac didn't like that many of their focus testers kept relying on the wrench and never using the weapons, so they were always looking for ways to discourage people using the wrench. That and the animation in the PS3 games are very different, so that might also cause you to feel a difference."
RatchetAndClank,361re4,Blakey001,2,Fri May 15 11:06:32 2015 UTC,And the lots of information that has come out over the last few days.
RatchetAndClank,361re4,efbo,2,Fri May 15 15:30:53 2015 UTC,"Aaaand a release date.  Btw, don't flame me but do you think that's Veldin? I can't really tell what planet it would be"
RatchetAndClank,361re4,RCDuke,1 point,Fri May 15 20:17:17 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking Aridia at night, just like how it appears in R&C1."
RatchetAndClank,35xhkv,iam_ZACK,4,Thu May 14 09:50:22 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, how could I forget about this? I have completed the game that many times."
RatchetAndClank,35xhkv,Bannharry,8,Thu May 14 10:34:02 2015 UTC,There's a lot of cool mock up posters and magazine covers in that menu. Might upload the rest for my fellow Ratchet and Clank homies.
