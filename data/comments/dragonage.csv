dragonage,3e3nem,Tiako,16,Tue Jul 21 18:30:07 2015 UTC,I also think he approves just because he likes that someone is curious about something and tries to find out more rahter than just going blidly into things
dragonage,3e3nem,Fondragon,6,Tue Jul 21 18:36:30 2015 UTC,"Right, because he used to be the kind of elf god to rush in to matters without worrying about the consequences, with the result that his civilization was destroyed and people enslaved."
dragonage,3e3nem,Fondragon,2,Tue Jul 21 18:42:20 2015 UTC,Yea his ways arent always the good ones but he is clever and his intentions arent bad at all
dragonage,3e3nem,queerbees,5,Tue Jul 21 18:45:43 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's actually pretty good. I can totally see that fitting him well. I think this fits really well in his whole wallflower thing (or should that be treeflower, Elf!). I mean, I can't really ever remember him directly stating something along the lines of ""hay! I think we should go that way."" He's always kinda giving directions on the shy, and even when it's time to get your big castle, he's all, ""oh, but you should tell everyone it was your idea, Ms mark/stigmata/lady-pope-jesus."" Like, what? Would anyone really be that surprised (or upset) that Solas knew of an abandon castle in the middle of nowhere? He knows like everything!  lol, it's actually odd, I kinda ignored Solas approval/disapproval when out-and-about because I thought that at-home approval mine of question asking made it irrelevant. I really only paid attention to the character that promised me jarred bees and the holy-cow-Gaaaaayyyy! Tevinter.  But on a side note, I actually think this reading of Solas is neat because it makes out a non-player character (though, technically, you can play as him) that is written to have interests and motivations that seem substantive to the story and unique from the protagonist. In fact, I think that's the one thing I've kinda liked, on and off, about the Dragon Age games is that they sometimes do this really well. Morrigan (and to a lesser extent Leliana), were really good in Origins, I don't speak of Dragon Age II, and a large number of Inquisition were really well developed. Though, Corypheus was a mess of ""wtf are you doing, bro!?"" and despite popular consensus, I could not find Iron Bull compelling. I have no idea what Bioware is doing with the Qunari. Maybe next installment they'll be a traveling circus?   Anyways, cool read!"
dragonage,3e3nem,completely-ineffable,2,Tue Jul 21 19:39:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  And I liked Corypheus as a sort of existential villain, the devout man who goes to heaven and finds it empty. He kind of suffers from the ending of the game being a bit abrupt, though."
dragonage,3e3nem,way_too_many_yuppies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:22:01 2015 UTC,"I don't speak of Dragon Age II,   What!? Dragon Age II does exactly what you are praising the DA games for. Unlike the other DA games, where most of your party members are following you because SAVIOR OF THE WORLD, most of DAII's characters have motives and interests that aren't just following Hawke. Merrill has her thing about spooky elf magic, Anders wants to be a terrorist (and he uses Hawke towards this purpose, lying to her to get her to fetch bomb ingredients), Fenris has his angsty angst, and so on. Granted, Anders is really the only one here whose motivation is of significant plot import, but DAII seems much better at this sort of thing than Inquisition, where a good number of party members are around mostly just because you're saving the world (Cassandra, Varric, Sara, Vivienne, all three of the advisors).   On the other hand, Blackwall is another example of an Inquisition character who has motives and interests that are pretty much disjoint from what the Inquisitor is up to. Bioware did a good job with him."
dragonage,3e3nem,northernbelles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:40:54 2015 UTC,"Yea this is a really great point, I always thought that part of why he really approves of you asking questions is the fact that he has been discredited by so many people. He doesn't get along with the dalish probably because at some point he tried to give them new knowledge that they refused to accept because it conflicted too greatly with their own beliefs. Then there's the fact that Fen'harel is feared and hated, so who would want to hear what the Dread Wolf has to say? Humans would never listen to him he's just a crazy knife ear apostate hobo, so after being ignored by so many people even though he knows so much more than so many probably left him super discouraged. Then the inquisitor comes along (bonus points if they're dalish) who respects him and seeks his counsel, he's probably really happy to find someone who actually gives a shit what his opinions are!  But you are totally correct in pointing out he loves when the inquisitor asks questions in general, he always stresses that the world isn't just black and white."
dragonage,3e3nem,quartzquandary,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with this! I noticed him approving for asking general questions during my first playthrough, but didn't really think about the context until I'd seen the epilogue. Similarly, he disapproves if you show signs of NOT thinking things through. One of my favorites is in the post-Temple of Mythal conversation, when he asks what you plan to do with your new power. My Inquisitor being a naive optimist said ""idk, trust my friends to help me!"" His response is pretty much ""NO, don't do that. Do anything but that. I did that once, and it was awful."" The second time I heard that I was like ""Ohhhhhh...."""

What would be good or comical places to test his reaction?"

Here’s a screenshot!  I removed the fog to make it a bit clearer. You can see the eluvian where you start out (after following Kieran through), the Guide statue near the entrance, and the back of the Watcher statue that is bleeding with a knife in its back that Kieran and Flemythal are standing in front of when you meet them.  Off in the distance is where the Here Lies the Abyss quest takes place.  You can see the back of the large Andraste statue with her holding out her arms, and thus, the Black City (ironically green) up above it!"
dragonage,3e3wz3,girltriesgames,3,Tue Jul 21 19:53:47 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you pointed this out! I can't say I really buy the idea we'd visit the Black City so casually.  The last time we know for sure it was breached started the Blights.   This also neatly explains why the area looks so much like Nightmare's realm. I've seen people suggest there might be something significant to that, but as you've proven, it's simply the other side of the map.  By any chance have you done a flycam of the post-epilogue area?"

dragonage,3e3wz3,ladyinsanity,3,Tue Jul 21 20:05:02 2015 UTC,"Copypasting what I wrote before:   The black city is just a flat picture of a cityscape blackened that makes it look 3d on the map world’s rotation. You can’t “visit” it as it isn’t an actual location your Inquisitor can run through.  Also, fun fact if you flycam it: all the locations regarding the Fade are on the same map. The green clouds hide the regions from each other, however.   I livestreamed myself flycamming throughout the Fade a few times and there's nothing to explore. There's the two areas (one for the Flemeth reveal, the other when you're dealing with the Hawke/Warden mission), a mountain range, and then a bunch of water for days.   There's nothing else there worth dissecting, other than the huge statues like the big Andraste statue, the demon and Venatori carving, the statue with a sword stabbed through the back with the blood coming out, the amulet of power altar, all the Tevinter city carvings, etc etc."

I posted this a while back under my old username /u/_pink_maggit but I still really like this line up.  Going to add more as I think of them!  ORIGINS  Loghain: Jason Isaacs because this actor is extremely layered, and Loghain is a very interesting character to me who is many shades of grey.  Duncan: Rufus Sewell  King Cailin: Chris Hemsworth  DA:2  Fenris: Gideon Emery. Because there is absolutely no substitute for that voice.  Anders: His voice actor, Adam Howden actually bears quite a good resemblance.  Merril: Carey Mulligan  Meredith Stanndard: Kate Winslet  INQUISITION  Ser Barris: Jesse Williams  Viv: Angela Bassett  Josie: Freida Pinto  Blackwall: Tom Hardy although I'm not quite sold on him pulling off Blackwall's beard-of-all-beards.

I thought that was standard in games like these, but didn't notice until I kept shooting off into the distance on my recent Da:I. also, the day/night cycle in Da:2 was wonderful.

The upgrade promotion sort of got bundled together with the announcement of the save importer, but what stood out to me was this:   What if I have preorder promotional items or Flames of the Inquisition items installed on my PlayStation®3 system or Xbox 360 console? PlayStation® systems: If you have preorder promotional items or Flames of the Inquisition items installed on your PlayStation®3 system at the time of the export, you can import the savegame data on your PlayStation®4 system. If you do not have the same content installed on your PlayStation®4 system, the savegame loads without it, and you must equip alternate equipment and/or armor. If you have the same content installed on your PlayStation®4 system, the savegame loads as it appeared on the PlayStation®3 system.   The way it sounds makes me think that the answer is no; DLC and multiplayer data do carry over, the latter only once.  You could try and PM /u/BioAdmiralX (BW employee, very informative comments)."

Short answer is you will not get your deluxe items transfered over, and would require purchasing the upgrade pack in order to get them on your PS4 version.  Long answer: I believe the statement that you have bolded is incorrect, but will have to follow up with that internally. I believe the implementation that we went with was, if you have deluxe items looted/equip/set (ie the horse) they would remain with you on your import, but if they were no longer set (ie the horse) then you would lose access to them. The armor and schematics would not be taken away from you, but nothing would be available for special shipments, and in future playthroughs the items would not be available at all.  On Sony platforms for DLC there is the concept of cross platform ownership meaning that once you buy it for 1 platform then it can be accessible on another platform (which I believe is the case with JoH). The Deluxe Items were not setup in this way and there is no way (as far as I know) to retroactively set them. This is why despite having the same account the Deluxe Content items would not be available to you."

I can run all on high settings and set mesh quality & texture quality on Ultra. I would avoid using GeForce Experience as it has been shown to slow down games and from experience it does with DAI. I just uninstalled it. This is my user.cfg from the game directory and these settings have improved the gameplay graphics: -  (open user.cfg with notepad++ or similar program)    RenderDevice.RenderAheadLimit 3 RenderDevice.Dx11Enable 1 RenderDevice.Dx11Dot1Enable 1 RenderDevice.Dx11Dot1RuntimeEnable 1 RenderDevice.DxDiagDriverDetectionEnable 1 WorldRender.SpotLightShadowmapEnable 1 WorldRender.MotionBlurEnable 0 Thread.ProcessorCount 4 Thread.MaxProcessorCount 4 Thread.MinFreeProcessorCount 0"

dragonage,3e1yci,Drengin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:53:46 2015 UTC,"I have an i5 3.4 ghz quadcore processor, 16 gigs of ram, and a crappy video card that I'm planning on upgrading soon (AMD Radeon R7 200 series, blarg), and I can run with almost all settings on ultra or high and get good fps.  Sometimes it bogs down on particle effects, but I can always turn them down a notch when it bugs me.  I also run with shadows as low quality as possible, because I have a thing with shadows in game.  It also saves some rendering power for those pretty textures :)  I don't know how much ram you have (the more the better!), but with that proc and video card you should be able to get good fps."
dragonage,3e1yci,Lolanie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:11:39 2015 UTC,"There is one specific setting in the graphics that a lot of people probably miss, but I found has the biggest impact on performance for my computer.  At the very top of the graphics settings is one called ""Resolution"".  Reducing the resolution reduces the overall quality of the graphics in the game.  BUT!!  You can knock it down a few notches, still have high quality graphics, and get a dramatic improvement in the overall performance!  I leave mine set at 75, which enables me to turn up other features.  Specifically Mesh Quality, Texture Quality, Effects Quality, and Shader Quality.  You want to try and have Shader Quality set to High.  Otherwise, you will not see scars and other facial details on a majority of the characters, including your Inquisitor.  (The main companions and advisers aren't really effected by this, so you'll see them the same regardless.)  If you want to see what the game looks like with the resolution turned down to 75, and a few other settings kicked up a little, I posted a picture to my Imgur account and included the settings from my computer.  You can see a marginal reduction in the quality of the graphics, but it's those little details that I'm able to turn on with these settings that I appreciate.  http://imgur.com/gjKPdLd"

dragonage,3dyymm,agayghost,2,Tue Jul 21 06:54:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, women get Alistair in DA:O! Everybody loves everybody in DA2. There is Cullen in DA:I. Also, Kaiden was exclsuive until ME3.

However, I am sure there is a bigger female demographic in games like Dragon Age or Mass Effect in general than there is in those such as Call of Duty. Like you said, it is no bad thing, just an interesting one. I for one love that there is a growing appeal of video games to women recently and gaming is not always being considered a ""nerdy guy"" thing anymore.

dragonage,3dyymm,Myusha123,14,Mon Jul 20 18:18:46 2015 UTC,"It's not the hardest. I'd say reconciling Briala and Celene is the hardest, because it requires conserving your halla statues, finding a somewhat-hidden token, talking to both Briala and Celene, as well as finding the evidence against Gaspard.   Whereas Celene's blackmail is actually relatively easy to find and acquire, since you have to walk right past it and the halla statues to open it are hanging about, and Gaspard's blackmail doesn't even require statues."
dragonage,3dyymm,likesMD,4,Mon Jul 20 18:48:40 2015 UTC,The first time I played through the game I reconciled Celene and Briala by accident. I had no idea what was going on and used my Halla statues on whatever door I came across first. Getting Gaspard's blackmail I think is the easiest because it doesn't require statues.

dragonage,3dyymm,loveofchair,2,Tue Jul 21 08:03:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I'm convinced that it can't be the worst outcome out of the given options. It requires actually making a decision you didn't even know you had, as well as being super careful with those halla statues - if you're going to go through all that effort and then have it turned on you that just doesn't seem right."

dragonage,3dyymm,andrastesflamingass,4,Mon Jul 20 18:48:46 2015 UTC,"Only problem is that they'd have to write 5 different stories into the next DLC/portion of the next game. It's a similar thing to how the ending of both console Fallout games were. In FO3, you had a fairly narrow ending with only two slight permutations, so it made it possible for them to expand the epilogue out. In FO:NV, they upped the permutations to 4, and made them all wildly different. So while it would have made more sense to expand on the ending of NV more than it would have been for 3, it wouldn't have been feasible to write four different epilogues for the price of one DLC."
dragonage,3dyymm,ArthurJohns,6,Mon Jul 20 20:07:38 2015 UTC,"If we're looking forward, there's a pretty good guarantee that any government you leave in Orlais will be toppled by the next full game release. They're all weakened by the Civil War, and it's just easier to be able to say ""X government fell and now Orlais is ruled by this new faction"" than write 5 different outcomes."
dragonage,3dyymm,Sandstorm005,2,Mon Jul 20 22:59:04 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. Gaspard rules in two. Celenes rules in two.  One of Gaspard's slots just needs to check 'Elf Sympathies' Same with Celene.  The one with all three of them is...most vulnerable.

dragonage,3dyymm,SwiftlyChill,2,Mon Jul 20 18:21:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe - now they have the Inquisition looming over them. If the Inquisitor could force them to work together at Halamshiral, it makes sense that they would assume that the Inquisitor can force them to work together again in the future if they start bickering again. So basically I guess that option is an Inquisition shadow leadership. My Inquisitor is a strong pacifist, so that option would've been ideal for her, but even more than that she wanted to reunite Briala and Celene, and I don't think you can reunite them and also force all three of them to work together. After everything when my Inquisitor's LI came to dance with her, she expressed sadness that Gaspard had to die, and I like that that was a dialogue option. Ideally she would've kept him alive, but it was the price of reuniting Celene and Briala and keeping Celene in power"

dragonage,3dyymm,Sandstorm005,17,Tue Jul 21 13:25:20 2015 UTC,"Really surprised that a majority of people let Morrigan drink from the well, always assumed it made more sense for the inquisitor to do it."
dragonage,3dyymm,AliveProbably,42,Mon Jul 20 19:17:04 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say why most people do it, but I assume:   Players who know Morrigan from DAO trust her a bit more not to blow up the world, so they're fine giving her what she wants. They don't want to risk their Inquisitor-. In fact, if you have Arcane Knowledge you know that it involves enslaving your will to an ancient god...and right now your whole problem is ancient gods. Most of these answers are informed--that is, they know exactly what the geas entails, and know Mythal is real.  In-game you don't get a whole lot of benefits from drinking from the Well.    Personally, I sort of meta'd the decision my first go-round. I knew the basic world state would remain the same no matter who drank, so why not let Morrigan have the Well? You don't even get any hidden knowledge out of it, really."
dragonage,3dyymm,eonge,12,Mon Jul 20 19:41:58 2015 UTC,"Weird, I played DAO and that was the reason I didn't want her drinking.   She already escaped Flemeth once, I didn't want her enslaved to something potentially worse."
dragonage,3dyymm,dancingmanatee,3,Mon Jul 20 20:24:53 2015 UTC,"Yup, my reasoning exactly"
dragonage,3dyymm,-Sai-,2,Mon Jul 20 21:45:14 2015 UTC,"I trusted her to sleep with my man (Alistair) in DAO, and she came through with that crazy promise. Also, her ""goodbye"" speech to me before the Archdemon fight had me in an ugly cry.  So naturally when it came to choose who used the well, I trusted Morrigan; and knew that she probably knew far more about it that I would."
dragonage,3dyymm,King-Rhino-Viking,2,Tue Jul 21 09:51:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 1, 3, and 4 makes a lot of sense. 2 for me is interesting because I always make my PC take risks before my companions, but that really comes down to personal preference."
dragonage,3dyymm,sapphoslyrica,10,Mon Jul 20 19:47:19 2015 UTC,"True, but Morrigan isn't a companion, and she really, really wants to drink from the Well."
dragonage,3dyymm,-Sai-,6,Mon Jul 20 19:49:50 2015 UTC,"Your Inquisitor is more important than some of the other PCs though. You are the Herald of Andraste and the single most uniting figure across all of the nations of Southern Thedas. While the Warden is important, a Warden is still made to sacrifice themselves to stop the blight so that is a fine decision to make. Hawke, while a good hero, is not as important as the Herald/Inquisitor. And so enslaving the Inquisitor could pose disastrous results for Thedas.   That's my take, anyway. The Inquisitor is the most powerful political figure of the the three playable Dragon Age characters."
dragonage,3dyymm,AliveProbably,2,Mon Jul 20 23:49:14 2015 UTC,"I played it as if I didn't know Morrigan and I drank from it because my Inquisitor didn't trust Morrigan. She had a sense of duty that if she was going to be the leader of the inquisition, the risks were hers to take.  And then my Dalish playthrough drank from it, despite Solas's warnings not to, because after seeing the crossroads, she wanted to recapture some of her people's glory. (And then that mofo Solas had to ruin the ancient Elvhan for her by saying her valaslin were slave markings. Stupid Solas.)"

dragonage,3dyymm,wingedmurasaki,9,Mon Jul 20 22:08:03 2015 UTC,It made me trust her infinitely more because I could easily she that see has grown and became noticeably less 'evil'. She went from not really understanding kind/proper/non-snarky social interaction to being a fairly good mother.

And he didn't really blow up so much that he's angry that Morrigan drank it, and that he wished you had that power instead of her (that was the vibe I got, anyway)  I'm going off of memory here so I could be wrong, but I do remember being surprised at his reaction after I drank from the well the next time I did that quest  Edit: Just redid it. The thing that confused me the first time was his standard ""What are you going to do with this power"" dialogue he has after that quest and his tone of voice is pretty peeved during that line, so that's why I thought that. I also said I'd rely on others, and that didn't help either TL;DR I pissed him off in that conversation. Oops"

dragonage,3dyymm,likesMD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:17:12 2015 UTC,"My Inquisitor distrusts almost every form of magic, especially magic from outside the Circles. This created something of a dilemma for him: on the one hand, he felt that drinking from the well himself would probably get him possessed by a demon (he doesn't actually understand magic, which is probably why he hates it so much). On the other hand, he was worried that if Morrigan drank from it she'd become extremely powerful. In the end, his arrogance made him decide that no matter how powerful Morrigan became, the Inquisition could stop her doing anything bad, and he didn't want to risk himself because the Inquisition needed him."

In the templar quest you get a MUCH better Cole introduction (and he's my favorite character so) and imo a more interesting adversary quest with Calpernia. Under Her Skin provided much-needed insight into Cory's inner thoughts/motives and it sucks that the majority of players miss out on that because of their mage biases.

dragonage,3dyymm,myfoothurtssobad,4,Mon Jul 20 18:27:02 2015 UTC,"Same here. I rarely had any of my Hawkes romance anyone so I didn't mind leaving them behind if it meant I got Wardens with a strong leader. I always felt bad for Varric, though. Always picked Cassandra for Divine mostly because I would always forget to talk to Leliana to soften her and she'd end up all ruthless. I drank from the Well most of the time because I usually romanced Solas and I'd like think they'll meet again one day."

Although the latest season has substituted more ""shock and awe"" than the brilliant writing that put it where it is today, the reason that Game of Thrones has been a great show so far is the heart-wrenching twists and turns that the story takes. It sucks so much ass that Hawke dies (or at the very least, just stays locked in the Fade), but it does make sense."

dragonage,3dyymm,Korrafan_1,5,Tue Jul 21 03:05:37 2015 UTC,"Viv is the least popular Divine, as expected. IMO she's the best equipped to handle the position. Cass wouldn't know subtlety if it hit her in the head, and Leliana is kinda unstable. Viv knows exactly what she wants and how to get you to do it for her."
dragonage,3dyymm,MareNigrum,9,Mon Jul 20 22:10:19 2015 UTC,"Well, if you look at the four possibilities, Vivienne is really the worst. She tries to keep the status quo, but people hate her anyways since she's a mage- meaning that there's chaos without any real change. And even in the 'good' ending where the Inquisitor is friends with Vivienne, ""all power lies with her"", which isn't something that's good for a nation as a whole. Meanwhile, if you're into reforming the Templar Order and the Circles, Cassandra does both (along with the Seekers if you ask her to) without the whole 'oh no it's a mage in power gotta revolt' angle.  And of course, most mage-supporters (which make up the majority according to the poll) will want to go with Leliana, hardened or softened, who completely frees the mages."

dragonage,3e1dpc,sirniggatit,3,Tue Jul 21 10:43:19 2015 UTC,This is the right answer. I bought DA:O Ultimate Edition second-hand and all the DLC was available in it.  There are also a fair number of promotional items that you can get for free here. These are all the promotional items for DA:O (and DA2) that Bioware later released to the fans for free. You need an EA/Origin account. I think you can create an account on the DA:O menu and then use that account on the link provided to 'purchase' the free DLC.
dragonage,3e1dpc,VarricTethras,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:14:17 2015 UTC,Oh cool! Thanks for this. Are these only available for the PC version or could you also select a console for them? I'm just curious how it works.
dragonage,3e1dpc,VarricTethras,2,Tue Jul 21 20:15:00 2015 UTC,"Yep, you can get them for console too. It's a bit time-consuming since you need to download each of the DLC items individually on the in-game menu, but you can get some pretty nice gear right at the start of the game. Unfortunately I don't think the items transfer over into the Awakening expansion, but you'll have access to a lot of other great equipment by the time you get that far.  By the way, if you are wondering what order to play the DLC in then do it this way:  Warden's Keep, The Stone Prisoner and Return To Ostagar should all be played during the campaign of DA:O. Do The Stone Prisoner early and the other two later on in the game (doesn't really matter exactly when).  After you finish Dragon Age: Origins, import your save file into Awakening. Once you finish Awakening, import your save file into Golems of Amgarrak. Once you've finished with the Golems DLC, import that save file into Witch Hunt. It's really important that you do the DLC in this order (Awakenings, Golems, Witch Hunt - they're in alphabetical order which makes it easier to remember).  The other two DLCs (Leliana's Song and The Darkspawn Chronicles) are completely stand alone campaigns with no save import.

I played up until just after Lothering, the first time I've had a camp or anything. I'll have to replay the game to that point since I was gifted a steam version of the game but that's fine. I can easily skip through dialogue and get through things a lot quicker now that I know what's going on.  I heard Leliana's song is a prequel and gets you unique items to take into the main game with you if you play it first. I'd rather not get spoilers though so I can sacrifice those items haha"

Currently working on a Qunari woman warrior and she's head-and-shoulders above all the humans.  She hasn't had anything yet that really stood out as glaringly awfu, but I haven't gotten to some of the cut-scenes that were most annoying on my male Qunari.  I can't actually remember the exact pose the male Qunari uses in judgement but I think the female is a little less slumped?  I'll see if I can snag a screenshot...  Screenshot  (No text on the screen, just my character sitting, that counts as ""no spoilers"" right?  How would you even spoiler tag a link?)"

When she was in a conversation with others close to her, she was obviously looking down, but not straight down, and when looking at anything in the distance her gaze was normal. I never had issues with face clipping. She does slouch on the throne, but it's not that bad. She's definitely head (and sometimes shoulders) above the rest of the crew but it never seemed to cause any issues. Especially for Sera."
dragonage,3e06og,Drataia,3,Tue Jul 21 02:45:46 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't think the face clipping through clothing issue is common with female qunari.

However, in some cutscenes the face is out of the frame and the camera focuses squarely on the boobs, which can lead to some unintentionally funny dialogue.  IMO, it's very worth playing as a female Qunari simply for the ""special snowflake"" value."

It's a combination of Uldred's voice, the mage's scream, the camera angles, the quick cuts from the lightning torture to the other mages. I find it way more disturbing than the Deep Roads or the Orphanage.  A close second is in DAOA when the Mother opens her mouth and screams."
dragonage,3dyqbx,gruedragon,11,Mon Jul 20 17:19:03 2015 UTC,"For me Deep Roads and the Broodmother are the top. It's like everyone has said so far with Hespith's poem, the mental image in your head of Laryn becoming the Broodmother, then coming around the corner to see her. A lot of suspense there.  The Orphanage in the Alienage was definitely creepy, but it would have a bigger effect on me if it was a longer quest. But hearing the kids then seeing all of the corpses was disturbing.  And for me, I'm playing through DA:O as a female Dalish elf, and when you encounter Tamlen in camp as a ghoul was disturbing and just broke my heart as well."

The part with Hespith and the broodmother was freaky as hell when I was first playing it, but it really is my favorite part of that game and I'm less creeped out by it than excited about it when I get to it.  If it counts, though, I'd say the actual creepiest thing from Origins was either the Harvester from GoA or the Architect's Laboratory in Awakening; the latter mostly because of finding his journals and seeing that he genuinely believed his experimentation would contribute to a good cause, and that he was so affable and genuinely wanted to ally with the Warden to continue his research despite the other sentient darkspawn he's created being almost universally evil and bloodthirsty."

Like, there's this awesome lead-in ... then this very ""bleh"" revelation at the end.  Not that it wasn't repulsive, but that it wasn't repulsive in the way I think they intended it.  I wasn't creeped out, I was annoyed at the writing.  My reaction was kind of ""Oh, body horror/monster pregnancy scare, how utterly bland.""  Seriously, some of the descriptions I've read of the Anvil when it was working are far more creepy than the Broodmother.  (But I can't remember if they're from Origins, so I'm not sure they count.)  I'm not sure what I'd vote for though.  A lot of the stuff I consider ""dark"" or ""creepy"" is more background stuff than game sequences.

dragonage,3dzu82,Fondragon,3,Mon Jul 20 22:48:15 2015 UTC,"Think of JoH as another zone you can go to and explore. Like Crestwood, or Emerald Graves, or Fallow Mire, it has it's own sub-storyline and sidequests. It's storyline is meatier than the other non-story related zones (looking at you, Hissing Wastes & Empress du Lion...), and it definitely does a lot of worldbuilding in regards to Avvar and the original Inquisition.  Solas is not in it for post-epilogue content. If you take him with you to JoH before fighting Coriphyshit, he'll work just like any other companion. There isn't any Solas specific plotlines  I would encourage playing through again with different choices, race, class, and romance, but it's ultimately up to you and your evaluation of whether the time is worth it to you."

If you're unsure of which different decisions to make start with a different gender, maybe go crazy and do a different race too. The race content is more there for flavour. Certain quests like the Winter Palace one are harder with certain races (Qunari vs Human sort of thing). If you're making decisions you normally don't make its easy to get into a new Inquisitor. The difference in content isn't crazy huge, but all of it adds up to a pretty different experience.   I wanted to antagonise certain characters the second time around coughSolascough to see their bad side. Didn't end up following through but I did end up with another distinct Inquisitor.

dragonage,3dzu82,Satanikat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:35:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, I really want to do the awful Renegade style run. Headcanon that the Mark turned my Inky insane. Be awful to everyone. Which decisions are you choosing? Going for a high death count or high misery? I mean like with Mass Effect, you can do a run where everyone dies, or a run where still lots of people die but Shepard is just the worst human being ever and screws everyone over in the worst ways.  I'm too used to min-maxing the companion approval. I know lots of people just pick the decisions they like and be damned the consequences, I need to do that more often. Some of those Judgements especially can be pretty great. I just picture this horrifying Inquisitor perched on his throne, sentencing people to be Jesters and Tranquil, or going on murder sprees then turning around and getting Josephine flowers. Just a complete nut-ball. Also Solas punching."

Also, if it gets to the point where conpanions are so pissed off with me they ask if I want them to leave I'm going to say yes haha! Looking forward to killing everyone off in the judgements, because on previous runs even if I thought they deserved it I didn't do it, as both my quizzies have been very 'for the good of the people' focused."

In the tabletop RPG wands are a thing too, and in Last Flight the act of channeling and focusing magic through a staff is described from a first-person perspective.   So not all magic requires the use of a focus, and you can cause a lot of incendiary damage with your hands, but some spells seem to require being focused! :)"

In fact, it just has 10X less stuff in it. It's pretty much an empty desert with some random enemy encounters and some tombs. The only fetch quest here is the shard quest.  Not hating on the hinterlands, but hissing wastes is nothing like the it in terms of amount of content, fetch quests, and NPCs, or structure and architecture. The only thing that's similar is that they're both massive.  But I agree with you. Hissing wastes was empty, large, took a long time, and a lot of the time I didn't feel like I was doing anything. Still, it's my favorite Map because of how atmospheric and peaceful it felt. Probably the biggest anomaly of the DAI areas in terms of feel. I just really enjoyed the ambience and calmness of the night landscape, plus the tombs were a pleasantly unique concept for the area. It's not for everyone, but the fact that I, and many others like it shows that enjoyment of the environments is subjective. So I'm rather happy they kept the feel of areas diverse."

dragonage,3dx429,WARitter,5,Tue Jul 21 00:54:19 2015 UTC,I love the hissing wastes! Love love love.
dragonage,3dx429,ms_ashes,4,Mon Jul 20 12:14:35 2015 UTC,Hissing wastes is one of my favorite areas in the game. even if there isn't a ton of stuff there I don't mind cause it's sooooo beautiful and fun to run around in
dragonage,3dx429,andrastesflamingass,2,Mon Jul 20 14:54:57 2015 UTC,obviously you didn't try to find the shards in the forbidden oasis. that place is like a maze and it took me more than 6 hours to find them !!!!
dragonage,3dx429,fmardini87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:54:00 2015 UTC,On my last couple of play throughs I've actually skipped the Hissing Wastes because by the time I'm a high enough level to get through there I'm almost ready to beat Corypheus. Especially after I realized you don't have to beat every level to finish the game.  SPOILER  Eventually I want to go 100% completionist but between there and Hinterlands I may go crazy doing it.

dragonage,3du1ms,DuapDuap,11,Sun Jul 19 14:12:03 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot! Worked really hard on her. I'm also insanely impressed by other peoples inquisitors in this sub - so I'm glad you like her!
dragonage,3du1ms,DuapDuap,5,Sun Jul 19 14:30:52 2015 UTC,The whole character creation (in terms of facial features) is probably one of my favorite parts of DA:I it's really easy to make a good looking character. Here is my Inky for reference.

dragonage,3du1ms,skinsfan55,2,Mon Jul 20 22:03:33 2015 UTC,For Eva I'm leaning more towards someone like Iron Bull or Cullen. Either getting kinky with the Bull or corrupting Cullen.

dragonage,3du1ms,Farscape29,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:26:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I know how to take a screenshot, though. It's just far too tedious to do it on Xbox One. :/ And it takes me out of the story getting the menu up and whatnot. And timing is almost impossible.   I do have a Kinect but I don't use it at all. It's in the box somewhere in my loft."

dragonage,3dxnjq,ll_Support_ll,5,Mon Jul 20 11:31:34 2015 UTC,The best tip I can give you is: just try it and figure it out for yourself. It's not that big of a jump from hard to nightmare and you should be more than familiar with game mechanics after beating the game three times. With regard to actual advice: dispel the spawning demons.
dragonage,3dxnjq,finrodess,3,Mon Jul 20 13:03:37 2015 UTC,I haven't played DAI for a while .. but I found nightmare pretty easy when I played on my rogue.  Even ran it with a dual-artificer team (Me and Varric) and the crit buff was insane ...
dragonage,3dxnjq,mow1469,2,Mon Jul 20 14:49:37 2015 UTC,"It's only hard until skyhold.   This is how I did it. I brought viv, solas and cassandra. Solas spams barrier on cooldown and viv held her barrier until I needed it somewhere.  Also don't let the mages use dispel by themselves. Having 2 Dispels and a spell purge makes rifts really easy.  Get the first perk that lets you have 4 more potions. That's all I needed. Don't take supply caches unless you absolutely need it. Lastly, SPOILER"
dragonage,3dxnjq,ThatGuyYouKnow999,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:20:04 2015 UTC,"Awesome, this seems to be what I've found in guides as well. Thanks for the tip about who to side with, hadn't seen that one, and  that person was annoying as heck last playthrough. I just assumed if you sided with the other group an equally annoying person would show up, been a while since I did it that way. (Kept it vague cuz spoiler tags are hard lol)"
dragonage,3dxnjq,magikot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:21 2015 UTC,Really? I found the other faction a lot more difficult at that stage in the game. My companions took that boss out at level 7 while I went around looting the previous wave of bad guys. When I went the other route I frantically tried to turn the trebuchet to end it faster because it was so difficult for me.
dragonage,3dwfci,lies_like_lavender,2,Mon Jul 20 02:30:39 2015 UTC,Sounds more morbid than delicious
dragonage,3dwfci,Sevhyr,2,Mon Jul 20 08:07:52 2015 UTC,Depends on which pieces ;)
dragonage,3dwfci,Sevhyr,3,Mon Jul 20 08:08:36 2015 UTC,"This is why you can't have nice things, Anders"
dragonage,3dxc36,Ormus1,2,Mon Jul 20 08:47:33 2015 UTC,For which game?  In DA:I if you chose the Rift Mage specialization you've a nearly endless mana pool thanks to Restorative veil.  Winter Stillness is also a must as it increase by 50% the mana regeneration if you don't move around.
dragonage,3dxc36,axel_evans,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:43:44 2015 UTC,Like what /u/axel_evans said - depends on the game.  If you're playing Origins or 2 then you can add willpower points when you gain a level.
dragonage,3dwdiq,butterprime,6,Mon Jul 20 02:14:24 2015 UTC,Dorian is the best character and best romance.
dragonage,3dwdiq,imuahmanila,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:56:30 2015 UTC,I'm inclined to agree with you - we'll see how the romance goes though.
dragonage,3dwdiq,imuahmanila,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:51:35 2015 UTC,"Dorian's felt like a real romance to me whereas Bull's was treated more like a joke (sorry to anyone who love to romance him, that's just my opinion). Too much of the Bull romance felt like the writers going ""lol Fifty Shades of Grey if it was played for laughs as it should have been... in Thedas."" While Dorian's relationship with the Inquisitor is probably the most realistic romantic connection that I've experience from Bioware. Dorian is such a sensitive dude who holds everyone at arm's reach with flippancy and misdirection, which I relate to, and a big reason he does it is for a specifically queer reason that doesn't really have anything to do with his father, which as a gay man I've experienced myself and I can't even think of another main stream work of fiction that's even tackled the subject.  I just can't say enough good things about that romance."
dragonage,3dwdiq,ms_ashes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:37:30 2015 UTC,"I feel you, and I know exactly what you mean. I watched some cut-scenes from the Bull romance and they did seem to be played up as being comedic, there was, however, one scene that I did find very funny. I don't know when it occurs but  SPOILER"
dragonage,3dwdiq,wrongkanji,6,Mon Jul 20 21:56:46 2015 UTC,"As a straight lady who loves RPing characters of diverse types, I personally enjoyed Dorian's romance much more."
dragonage,3dwdiq,Crystallyne27,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:02:26 2015 UTC,"I think overall I relate more to Dorian as a character, I'm not the most masculine person, but I'm pretty imposing -- so my qunari mage makes sense but I like Bull because I pretty shamelessly worship masculinity.  I think I'll probably get more out of Dorian's love tbh."
dragonage,3dwdiq,beelzeybob,4,Mon Jul 20 16:51:00 2015 UTC,"I love both of them, but I think the Dorian romance is more fleshed out.  both have the same number of cut scenes as far as I know, but Dorian has more romance specific dialogue.  You can hang with him more."
dragonage,3dwdiq,Crystallyne27,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:22:01 2015 UTC,That's pretty important to me - I think in the end I'm gonna go with Dorian.
dragonage,3dwdiq,Crystallyne27,10,Mon Jul 20 16:52:06 2015 UTC,"This is totally a personal opinion, but Dorian.  Hands down, Dorian.  All the way.  I've never done a M/M romance until I encountered Dorian.  I'm a hardcore Cullen lover, but I HAD to make a male character just to romance Dorian as I learned more about him.  LOL  (I have to admit I'm not a fan of Iron Bull, personally.  I have seen videos of his romance, and I like him well enough as a character.  I just can't see myself romancing him, personally.)"
dragonage,3dwdiq,ashkestar,3,Mon Jul 20 02:26:54 2015 UTC,"Dorian has some hang ups that hit close to home, and that mustache is everything -- but I'm a qunari and I just felt like it would make sense for Bull and the Inquisitor to end up together.  Cullen's issues with magic folk make me iffy on him but he is quite the looker, ever since origins."
dragonage,3dwdiq,Crystallyne27,2,Mon Jul 20 02:29:24 2015 UTC,"Magic 8 ball of flair picking (aka /u/Automoderator) says Dorian!   I did really like Bull's romance with a Qunari though so there's that. Also it's nitpicky but a lot of Dorian's romance scenes seem to be animated with a human sized Inquisitor in mind first, and from what I've seen a couple of Dwarf or Qunari ones look kind of strange because of the camera angles lol. hanky panky scene SPOILER If this isn't your only playthrough, I would say save Dorian for your next one."
dragonage,3dwdiq,agayghost,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:53:20 2015 UTC,It might really boil down to who joins me first - I'm having that hard of a time deciding. I hear tell that the main campaign of this game is upwards of 50 hours -- so it would be quite some time before a second playthrough.
dragonage,3dwdiq,agayghost,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:01:58 2015 UTC,"Actually it just really depends on how much of the side stuff you do.  There are 9 major quests that show up under the ""Inquisitor's Path"" category, and those are the main storyline quest.  You can finish the game much faster then that if you focus on those quests.  (I would encourage building up relationships with companions and doing their personal quests as well.)  I have already finished the game a couple times, and I have yet to even touch zones like Emprise du Lion, and others.  My friends are scandalized.  LOL  I would say that the game being upwards of 50+ hours is more for the ""completionist"" type of game, where you're trying to do EVERYTHING.  And it is wholly unnecessary, if you just want to experience the main storyline(s).  heheh"
dragonage,3dwdiq,desacralize,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:35:52 2015 UTC,"It depends on how long it takes me to get good at the game. Because out of all the gameplay styles thus far, I actually prefer the combat in Dragon Age 2 -- the combat in this game seems much slower so combat feels almost more like a chore? I don't know, it might be because I play mage and in the second game I felt like I was actually doing something with my attacks but this time around it seems more like the first game where I feel like my attacks aren't doing jack diddly."
dragonage,3dwdiq,TwistingtheShadows,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:46 2015 UTC,"I hadn't really thought about it, but I have to agree with you there.  I absolutely love to play Mages, myself.  But suprisingly enough, I find that I like archers in DAI much more!  I would highly suggest giving it a try at some point."
dragonage,3dwdiq,TwistingtheShadows,2,Mon Jul 20 18:28:29 2015 UTC,"I might have to on my next playthrough, we shall see."
dragonage,3dwdiq,ll_Support_ll,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:59:21 2015 UTC,"No matter who joins you first, Dorian is more likely to be the first romance option. Bull's requires some specific side-content to be completed before it really kicks off, which isn't super likely early in the game."
dragonage,3dwdiq,Maddieland,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:35:55 2015 UTC,thanks for the input. :)  I think I've decided on Dorian after all.
dragonage,3dwdiq,Nerdette5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:59:56 2015 UTC,"You make an excellent point about the sizing issue with Human vs Qunari and Dorian.  The one Qunari I've played, I romanced Cassandra.  I always pick a human or elf to romance Dorian, with my preference being human.  (Even though I'm crazy about elves.  lol)"
dragonage,3dwdiq,Nerdette5,6,Mon Jul 20 05:37:36 2015 UTC,"Dorian's is more emotional and meaningful, whereas Bull's is fun as fuck and surprisingly sweet. I loved both but prefer Bull's."
dragonage,3dwdiq,Nerdette5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:51:44 2015 UTC,"That's where I'm trying to decide, because I'm not the ""fun"" type person while looking for a relationship in reality, hahaha. I guess it would make sense for me to seek out similar shit in-game.  I'm just really having a tough time deciding."
dragonage,3dwdiq,venslor,2,Mon Jul 20 02:59:36 2015 UTC,"I say hook up with Bull to get some of the fun scenes. You get several times you can break it off (he's not mad or anything dw) and then you can have your emotional, romantic relationship with Dorian. best of both worlds~!"
dragonage,3dwdiq,DreadWolfByTheEar,3,Mon Jul 20 03:30:08 2015 UTC,"This is what I'd go with, /u/butterprime.  You have to go out of your way to turn Bull's romance into anything serious, he doesn't push for it because he's not looking for it (unlike Dorian who very much is), so it plays very well as a cheerful fling you can end before you move on to something more long-term."
dragonage,3dwdiq,alittlevulpix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:58:47 2015 UTC,I think that's what I may end up doing tbh. How far into the game do you find Dorian? I know it's kind of different for every person
dragonage,3dwdiq,alittlevulpix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:56:10 2015 UTC,"When you choose a side, Dorian will turn up around that time."
dragonage,3dwdiq,Crystallyne27,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:50 2015 UTC,A side? As in between Mages and Templars?
dragonage,3dwdiq,mr_indigo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:04:12 2015 UTC,Yes.
dragonage,3dwdiq,Crystallyne27,2,Mon Jul 20 17:05:23 2015 UTC,"I would say Dorian's, because the bull will go for a guy or girl, so you can romance him next playthrough if you choose to try out the female side."
dragonage,3dwdiq,mr_indigo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:12:38 2015 UTC,Dorian is the sassy tsundere type but very emotional and when I romanced him it gave me all the feels :'(  Never tried Bull tho but he seems like very fun and sweet.
dragonage,3dwdiq,Crystallyne27,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:29:07 2015 UTC,"the more I interact with Bull in game the more I'm starting to see that he's got alot of the qun traits that I really don't like, which I guess is why I'm glad the player qunari is vashoth"
dragonage,3duks9,Jay_R_Kay,14,Sun Jul 19 16:58:07 2015 UTC,Always found it ironic that Anders is only party member who can never betray you in that quest.
dragonage,3duks9,desacralize,19,Sun Jul 19 23:44:38 2015 UTC,Because then it would be one betrayal too many.

dragonage,3duks9,-Sai-,15,Mon Jul 20 00:04:37 2015 UTC,"Ah that quest is so hard if you're a Fenrismancer. On the one hand, letting him turn on you gets you an extra scene where you talk about it.  On the other hand... the last time I did it he nearly one-hit the entire party even on Casual mode with his starting weapon."

dragonage,3duks9,-Sai-,14,Sun Jul 19 23:43:09 2015 UTC,I managed to hide behind a table and cheap shot him with lightning. It probably didn't help his opinion of mages.
dragonage,3duks9,EiraRose,7,Mon Jul 20 01:54:19 2015 UTC,"Lmao! The first time I did it as a Fenrismancer I stunned him and we knocked him out ASAP, so I thought ""oh that's easy, they must've nerf'ed him for this battle."" Well, one thing led to another and I had to redo the fade (messed up those stupid puzzles when I was being a noob and not realizing that they were important) and suddenly Fenris is killing EVERYONE. I am barely keeping everyone alive as a master spirit healer. He's freaking INSANE! That's why I love him though."
