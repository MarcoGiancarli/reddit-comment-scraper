ACQR,3dzjat,wendrr,2,Mon Jul 20 20:52:55 2015 UTC,What color do you want the background?
ACQR,3dzjat,wendrr,2,Mon Jul 20 20:55:40 2015 UTC,"Anything works really, pastel colors are preferred but not a must. So you just do you!"
ACQR,3dzjat,wendrr,2,Mon Jul 20 21:01:56 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll see what I can do :)"
ACQR,3dzjat,wendrr,2,Mon Jul 20 21:14:59 2015 UTC,I'm finished! Here it is :)

ACQR,3dohb5,benreddit468,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:25:35 2015 UTC,"I found this one but you may need to settle for making your own. It looks simple.  I also found this, there's no qr code but it was creepy enough that I had to share."
ACQR,3d6yox,TinkieWinkieBag,3,Tue Jul 14 00:28:15 2015 UTC,http://www.thulinma.com/acnl/  Upload one of your QRs to this tool and copy down the strings of characters that appear next to your name/town. Upload the pattern you want to edit and change the name/town to yours and put the strings of characters that appeared on your QR into the program. Then copy this QR to your game and you should be able to edit.
ACQR,3d6yox,f1ne,3,Tue Jul 14 01:33:58 2015 UTC,"I use http://www.thulinma.com/acnl/ too.  But if you upload your dream town, don't forget to disallow sharing your patterns to avoid misattribution."
ACQR,3d1cqf,MelanyisAwesome,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"i guess ill accept, since no one else will. i have been trying to fill these requests here lately, so just give me some time."

ACQR,3czvo2,QThatOneGuy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:22:32 2015 UTC,I accept your request. I coincidentally just made the Mr. Saturn Ness alternate as a shirt. Ill be glad to do this for you.
ACQR,3czvo2,QThatOneGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:40:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! You don't have to make the Mr Saturn shirt, as I am already wearing one"
ACQR,3czvo2,QThatOneGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:01:28 2015 UTC,"well, I was actually already done with the Saturn on an unrelated note before I even saw this (something to represent Iwata/my love for Mother). anyway, I need to try to get some type of sleep."
ACQR,3czvo2,QThatOneGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:36:44 2015 UTC,Dream code?

ACQR,3czvo2,QThatOneGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:33:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just searched it up. Unfortunately, I had no other choice but to delete my shirt pattern and go for the Masked Man one. I'm going to  have go back to your dream world when I want to cycle through shirts. Thanks though!"
ACQR,3czvo2,QThatOneGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:34:29 2015 UTC,"np, hope you enjoy! later, I plan on making an album and do a mass upload. I still gotta do Eliwood like I said I would and im gonna start on retro consoles and controller designs after that. if you have video game related suggestions, im all open."
ACQR,3czvo2,QThatOneGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:36:48 2015 UTC,"Great! I'm looking forward to seeing more of your designs in the future. Speaking of future, maybe try doing some Xenoblade Chronicles related designs? I'm a fan of that game too and I haven't seen too many designs done."
ACQR,3czvo2,QThatOneGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:00:42 2015 UTC,already did. got a monado and Riki design.
ACQR,3czvo2,QThatOneGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:11:22 2015 UTC,Mind if I come over to your town?
ACQR,3czvo2,QThatOneGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:41:33 2015 UTC,"sorry, I am going to GameStop right now to swap out for the N3DSXL, which will take some time to complete. Ill be on around 3am here (which is when you are usually on anyway) if the transfer goes all good."
ACQR,3czvo2,QThatOneGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:07:41 2015 UTC,"Cool! Good luck with the N3DSXL, it's a good upgrade if you play with 3D. I've upgraded to it and it the C-Stick is useful if you play Smash or MH4U."

ACQR,3crnq6,sigyn13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:18:13 2015 UTC,"I found something and remembered your thread! On this blog there are a couple of stones with red and white borders for fall and winter, hope that helps!"
ACQR,3cqzco,DNAnimeLover,2,Fri Jul 10 01:56:15 2015 UTC,"Here is what I came up with. I did a green background, but if you want a different color I'm more than happy to change it! :)"
ACQR,3cqzco,wendrr,2,Fri Jul 10 08:16:06 2015 UTC,OMG thats so awesome thanks. _^ no no the green makes it kinda look like its a real flower on the ground thanks so much.
ACQR,3cqzco,wendrr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:12:20 2015 UTC,No problem! :D
ACQR,3cqzco,wendrr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:13:21 2015 UTC,I'd be willing to give it a try. What color do you want the background?
ACQR,3codln,silver_shroud,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:59:02 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but doesn't the way the pattern face change with the direction you face when you put it down?"
ACQR,3codln,wendrr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:36:45 2015 UTC,No.
ACQR,3codln,SuperNanoCat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:30:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not the best at designs, but I could try and make it."
ACQR,3codln,wendrr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:02:46 2015 UTC,"I wish that was the case! I'd save a lot of space in my patterns section that way. I'll look forward to seeing what you cook up if you do decide to give the design a try, :)"
ACQR,3codln,wendrr,3,Thu Jul 9 21:06:36 2015 UTC,"Here is my best effort. :) If you don't like something, let me know and I'll try to fix it!"
ACQR,3codln,wendrr,2,Thu Jul 9 22:43:39 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is excellent, it's just what I was looking for! Thank you so much for your work, I can't wait to see how it looks in my town. You rock! :D"

ACQR,3cgmkf,AstrumDrago,2,Tue Jul 7 19:27:49 2015 UTC,Oh my goodness are those on the side your character grabs items from?! Of so that is so amazing
ACQR,3cgmkf,lady_mongrel,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:56:08 2015 UTC,I actually think it is. At least I know its the side where tools appear but you don't pull it from the side.
ACQR,3cfxp4,RoNPlayer,3,Tue Jul 7 16:37:14 2015 UTC,"I have a couple on my tumblr , you'll have to scroll down a bit for the paths. If that's not the style you're looking for, feel free to describe what you'd like, and I can try to make it! :)"
ACQR,3cfxp4,Awarathe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:11:57 2015 UTC,Do you have the path above the yellow dress with a less highlighted border?
ACQR,3cfxp4,Awarathe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:47:00 2015 UTC,"Afraid not, but making a different border for it isn't a very hard job. What did you have in mind? Grassy or stone or..? :)"
ACQR,3cfxp4,Awarathe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:53:08 2015 UTC,Grassy. Just not as Highlighted as it is right now. More like the normal grass :D
ACQR,3cfxp4,Awarathe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:15:44 2015 UTC,"So more like the actual grass on the ground? :p There's no exact match, so you know, but a close one. I can do it tomorrow, if that's allright, it's nighttime in my town, so will be hard to see the colours :p"
ACQR,3cfxp4,Awarathe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:21:44 2015 UTC,I'd be really glad. And will await the result eagerly.
ACQR,3cfxp4,Awarathe,2,Tue Jul 7 20:29:11 2015 UTC,Here you go! Hope that's closer to what you were thinking. :)
