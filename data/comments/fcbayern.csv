fcbayern,3e2ovi,pewpewlasersandshit,8,Tue Jul 21 14:25:57 2015 UTC,"Rafinha would NOT be able to play for Germany even if he gets the German citizenship! He played for the Brazilian U20 team at the World Cup 2005, which is of course an official tournament. If a player has played for a youth team he can only change the association if he has applied for the citizenship of the nation he wants to change to while playing these youth team games. That means Rafinha would have had to apply for the German passport in 2005 to be eligible for playing for Germany!"
fcbayern,3e2ovi,WalterBlanco08,4,Tue Jul 21 18:04:25 2015 UTC,"we had this discussion 3hours ago.  Rafinha can play for germany once he gets a german passport 'cause he never played for the Brazilian Senior team in an official competition.       edit: he's right.   Rafinha played in the u20 worldcup under another (nick)name, making him not eligible for the german team."
fcbayern,3e2ovi,WalterBlanco08,4,Tue Jul 21 18:51:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've read that. But this is just wrong, he really can't play for a different nation anymore. These journalists are reporting false facts."
fcbayern,3e2ovi,WalterBlanco08,4,Tue Jul 21 19:07:45 2015 UTC,"mea culpa.  The 2005 u20 tournament wasn't named anywhere (even Rafinha's wiki pages,etc.) but it seems you are actually right.  Had to dig around quite a bit but Rafinha played under the name Rafael for the Brazilian U20 in the world cup - thus making him not eligible.       Great find !"

Großkreutz, Jung, Rudy or Rafinha personaly I Like Großkreutz but I think Rudy is Löw's favorite  And Löw is going to pick who ever HE feels give him the best DFB possible. Rafinha being brazilin will not affect Löw's choice"
fcbayern,3e2ovi,WalterBlanco08,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:48 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Jung be included in the squad for the Euros, if Rafinha can start that would be amazing. Boateng, Hummels and Höwedes can play alongside him."
fcbayern,3e2ovi,nickingthet,2,Tue Jul 21 19:06:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not to familiar with BuLi player registration regulations, but is there a limit on how many non-EU passport holders one team can have? I believe the Serie A has something similar."
fcbayern,3e2ovi,nickingthet,3,Tue Jul 21 19:35:31 2015 UTC,"No there aren't any restrictions on how many foreign players a team can have. There is just the Local-Player-Rule, which requires each team to have at least 8 players under contract who came up through the youth system of a German team, and at least 4 of these must have been in the youth system of the team they're playing for."
fcbayern,3e2ovi,nickingthet,3,Tue Jul 21 20:42:34 2015 UTC,He has applied for a German passport. He could not play for the German national team as he represented Brazil at senior international level so he is not able to represent another country.
fcbayern,3e2ovi,nickingthet,9,Tue Jul 21 15:01:57 2015 UTC,he could play for the national team if he gets a german passport
fcbayern,3e2ovi,Dictarium,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:03:48 2015 UTC,Nope Rafina represented Brazil at senior international level so he is not able to represent another country
fcbayern,3e2ovi,nickingthet,9,Tue Jul 21 15:10:22 2015 UTC,Rafinha has two caps for the brazilian national team but those were friendlies. That means he is still eligible for Germany.       pretty obvious stuff...
fcbayern,3e2ovi,Dictarium,-7,Tue Jul 21 15:13:57 2015 UTC,"Thought he played a few more guess I was wrong on that.   Still he will NEVER be called up to represent die mannschaft in a million years.  edit: also the FIFA rules do include: ""Any Player who ... [assumes] a new nationality and who has not played international football [in a match ... in an official competition of any category or any type of football for one Association] shall be eligible to play for the new representative team only if he fulfills one of the following conditions:""  Which playing for the Brazilian football association / national team would count as even in a friendly match."
fcbayern,3e2ovi,fleckes,8,Tue Jul 21 15:21:15 2015 UTC,"well, look at this part of your quote:   in an official competition of any category or any type of football for one Association   Friendlies are not considered official competition.Nor is the olympic soccer tournament       IF he gets called up or not depends on him and löw.  Right now the german national team needs good full backs, so it might happen.       PS: never ever will i get used to the term ""Die Mannschaft"" for our national team...can't understand why the DFB started to embraced the name"
fcbayern,3e2ovi,fleckes,-5,Tue Jul 21 15:30:40 2015 UTC,"It will never happen even if the rules allow, sings of the similar bullshit there was few years back of Almunia putting himself forward for England. Loew would rather rely on younger german players like Jung or just existing players like Grosskreutz there."
fcbayern,3e2ovi,nickingthet,5,Tue Jul 21 15:38:48 2015 UTC,And yet you're probably OK with Klose and Podolski?
fcbayern,3e2ovi,fleckes,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:53:26 2015 UTC,"Of course? How could you even compare those 2 with Rafina? They played all their youth and adult life as Germans (plus both Klose's & Podolski's families were German which is why their families were allowed to come to Germany in the first place from Poland so move on from that), now a Brazilian who has identified himself all his life as Brazilian, who played for Brazil in his youth and as an adult may get a German passport does not make that OK to play for die mannschaft."
fcbayern,3e2ovi,nickingthet,5,Tue Jul 21 16:10:14 2015 UTC,"Stop saying die mannschaft. It's dumb. He's been in Germany for 9 years, it's not exactly someone jumping ship after a year or two in a new country. Why does it matter what he has identified as if he identifies as GERMAN now?"
fcbayern,3e2ovi,TrueGamingKing,6,Tue Jul 21 16:16:11 2015 UTC,In regards to your edit: From the same wiki page you linked to   Players are generally not allowed to switch nationalities but friendly match appearances do not commit a player to one country; Jermaine Jones played three friendlies for Germany in 2008 but has played for the United States since 2010
fcbayern,3e2ovi,TheBlindLeader,4,Tue Jul 21 15:27:48 2015 UTC,Why do you think he'd never be called up?
fcbayern,3e2ovi,TweetPoster,-6,Tue Jul 21 15:24:05 2015 UTC,"Trust that Loew plans things with actual German born players who are younger and qualify better for die mannschaft in the long term like  Sebastian Jung & co. Plus just the basic fact that Rafina has represented another country at senior level, be it friendly or not and even if the rules allow it just simply won't happen."
fcbayern,3e53d1,Dictarium,9,Wed Jul 22 00:50:29 2015 UTC,"Well Vidal is still in fucking Seaworld in Miami. We only announce transfers after the medicals are over and it was reported that we'll do it before the weekend. 2nd signing will probably be a Chinese player. We're going to get our hopes up only to find out it's a publicity stunt. Like that time they said that they have a big surprise signing and it turned out to be ""the fans"" lmao"
fcbayern,3e53d1,flagship7,3,Wed Jul 22 01:21:30 2015 UTC,"Rummenigge actually stated before they went off to China, that Uli looked at all the Chinese players, but he couldn't find one that would improve Bayern, so they won't sign one for publicity like Wolfsburg has done."

fcbayern,3e53d1,crane444,5,Wed Jul 22 04:06:55 2015 UTC,"Why do you guys think the Vidal signing has not been made official yet?   Because the deal is not done.   Vidal has yet to complete his medical and sign the contract.   Do you think they traveled with the club in secret?    No.   Surely it can't be anyone huge or somebody would've spotted them.   Haha i like the idea of having a secret player hiding in the shadows...lurking in the dark... but again, no. Nobody traveled with the club.   Who could it be?    Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe KdB ? Draxler ? Lacazette ? Griezmann ? F. Anderson ? Coman ?   What position could they be?   Probably someone who can play as LW and/or CAM"

fcbayern,3e53d1,TrueGamingKing,4,Wed Jul 22 05:02:12 2015 UTC,"First, Vidal will most likely sign the contract either today or tomorrow as I believe he just finished his holidays and then he'll have his medical after which Bayern announce the transfer.  - The transfer is basically done, even Juventus' sport director stated so.  Next, the surprise signing won't be a Chinese player, as Rummenigge said in an interview before he left for China that Uli looked at all the Chinese players, but they couldn't find a single one who would improve Bayern Munich. I've been trying to find the interview video the whole time, but couldn't manage to find the video again where he said that. Guess you'll just have to believe me.  Also, just in case some people are confirmed, Rummenigge didn't actually say that they would sign another player, Sky Sports Germany said so and after them SportBild, which leads me to believe that it is quite a big player, as Sky Sports must've seen Bayern executives talk to a famous agent such as Mendes or Raiola, but they weren't sure who the player is and just speculated that Bayern woulfd finish the 'deal' before the China tour"

I also dont think that this ""signing"" traveled, i dont even think they signed anyone, but theyre probably Almost done with that signing."

As much as I can remember, GolTv showed every Bayern match as first priority, then Dortmund, then whatever else was on. I also suspect that matches will be on more than just Fox Sports 2, I assume Fox Sports 1, Fox and whatever your regional sports channel is will get some matches, especially if it's big. The matches will be aired live. You will have access to any live matches Fox/Fox1/Fox2 are playing through Fox Sports Go, anything not live will probably be on Fox Soccer Go, which is $100 per year. It's hasn't yet been 100% confirmed that it will be on Fox Soccer Go instead of a separate free service, or through Fox Sports Go, but it seems likely. There will be no other legal option if you are located in the US."

I also checked the Aug. 1/2 schedule since I think that will be the Supercup, but it's just listed as ""Bundesliga Match Live"". Maybe they'll add more details as we get closer to the date.  You could check the US Fox Sports site for the schedule. I'm not sure about the app since I currently don't have it, and I'm also in a different region so it might not be the same."

fcbayern,3e4kfx,Ibrahimnaldo,3,Tue Jul 21 22:30:13 2015 UTC,"His brother is good but he won't be as good as Thiago, they're two different players anyway, Pogba is a pointless buy for you guys considering you have a lot of midfield talent coming through, surely one of Suarez Rafinha or Sampler will leave or maybe two of them. Busquets isn't going anywhere and neither is Rakitic. Thiago is insanely good and influential, he can become the best midfielder in the world, I just pray this man can stay on the damn pitch."
fcbayern,3e4kfx,TrueGamingKing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:19:42 2015 UTC,"Well I have the most faith in Samper, he is going to be our future.  With iniesta aging Rafinha and Samper should fill the place but La Masia is going on the decline. I think pogba is great but he hinders our homegrown players."
fcbayern,3e4kfx,Ibrahimnaldo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:19:24 2015 UTC,"Well, this might sound douchy, but I am not trying to be, but if you guys still had Thiago, then you guys wouldn't need Pogba, as Thiago is better. He is our most creative and most impactful midfielder when fully fit, and despite only playing like 11 league matches last season, i would put him in a good shout for player of the season for us if there weren't Arjen Robben, Thomas Muller and Manuel Neuer.   As you probably know, he plays a little like Iniesta mixed with Ronaldinho. A real joy to watch."

Sure MU are financially very strong club but it requires more than money to bring a player at a club.   Müller is a homegrown talent of Bayern, he is a fan favorite here and an overall strong player who is easily considered as an asset for the club; I think he is very committed towards the club and the fans who has already proved his worth and this is why I think he will continue at Bayern for at least the next 5 seasons. Moreover I don't think Pep or Rummenigge will let Müller leave even if somehow he got swayed by LVG's words.  I usually don't make post on other team's subreddit but this is the most shocking rumor in this transfer window, thus I wrote my opinion here. And I would be really surprised if Müller actually ends up signing for MU."
fcbayern,3dzqyq,Football_Enthusiast,4,Tue Jul 21 11:52:53 2015 UTC,"United fan here, sorry guys!   We won't sign him, Bayern aren't stupid enough to sell Mueller after selling Schweni and don't need the money. The max we'd go up to is about 70M (so I guess 100M Euros) and Bayern wouldn't accept at that price."
fcbayern,3dzqyq,SureAviator,-3,Tue Jul 21 00:06:05 2015 UTC,"Even if you had all the money in the world it wouldn't even matter. Joke that your club have become exactly what United fans always took the piss out of Chelsea/City fans for being, long long way from what the class of 92 made you."
fcbayern,3dzqyq,nickingthet,4,Tue Jul 21 10:50:53 2015 UTC,"Football has changed, Madrid are like this, Barca are like this (Suarez, Neymar and soon to be Pogba), City are like this, PSG are like this, Chelsea are like this, the Italians clubs started all this back in the 90s/early 00s...that's life, it's a shame but that's how it goes sadly."
fcbayern,3dzqyq,SureAviator,2,Tue Jul 21 10:55:21 2015 UTC,In my opinion there is a massive difference between spending money you have earned and spending money that has been given to you.   United have more than earned the right to spend the money they can these days.
fcbayern,3dzqyq,AJMcCoy612,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:09:36 2015 UTC,I would not say money earned when the club operates with a massive debt (still over £380 million) that was passed onto the club by the owners when they purchased it.
fcbayern,3dzqyq,nickingthet,2,Tue Jul 21 15:00:00 2015 UTC,"It says it all in relation to how much United earn annually when they have that amount of debt yet they can still afford to spend millions on players.   But that is sort of irrelevant though when my original point is that United have generated all of their money through various sponsorship deals and other methods of revenue instead of being handed their fortune like City, PSG and Chelsea were."
fcbayern,3dzqyq,AJMcCoy612,2,Tue Jul 21 15:24:17 2015 UTC,"If Bayern had the money United have, they would have done the same thing."
fcbayern,3dzqyq,eyeballer94,0,Tue Jul 21 11:11:37 2015 UTC,"Nope, Bayern have the money if they wanted to spend it but Bayern are just better at picking players and negotiating transfers (and not stupid hence £25m for Vidal) plus Bayern keep the identity of the club at heart so have homegrown players and a membership driven club that is not owned by any one person which means a very close connection with the city and fans, one that United will never have. Plus simply put Bayern don't need to spend £300m over 2 seasons to try and win trophies."
fcbayern,3dzqyq,nickingthet,8,Tue Jul 21 11:24:51 2015 UTC,"Bayern are not spending because they have a good team and are winning titles.Manchester united during the Fergie era did not overspend because they were winning titles.The team post-Fergie era just couldn't compete with other teams, hence the overspending."
fcbayern,3dzqyq,eyeballer94,0,Tue Jul 21 11:39:49 2015 UTC,Good times and bad times Bayern have never overspent.
fcbayern,3dzqyq,nickingthet,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:26:44 2015 UTC,Haha what a great comment.

Muller means so much to bayern and to german football in general. It would crazy for him to leave and in my opinion and stupid decision.

fcbayern,3e29k2,stelts94,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:26:53 2015 UTC,Is Shaqiri still technically a Bayern player?
fcbayern,3e29k2,pewpewlasersandshit,6,Tue Jul 21 13:13:07 2015 UTC,no
fcbayern,3e29k2,SwissBliss,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:41:37 2015 UTC,"I might be wrong, but I think he's on loan with an option to buy. So I believe he still is technically. Bayern should have kept him, considering Ribery and Robben are out of order. I always felt Bayern handled the situation poorly (and Shaqiri partly did as well)."
fcbayern,3e29k2,pewpewlasersandshit,6,Tue Jul 21 13:18:01 2015 UTC,"No. It was a loan deal with a already fixed buy option that automatically was triggered at the end of last season.  Inter was out of money so they couldn't buy him right away,that's why we did make such a strange loan-and-buy deal."
fcbayern,3e29k2,ethanhawkman,4,Tue Jul 21 13:53:01 2015 UTC,"I think they did buy him, at least according to Transfermarkt.de becuase otherwise he would have joined us again at the start of July."
fcbayern,3e29k2,inbredgoku,3,Tue Jul 21 13:26:55 2015 UTC,"we don't need him now we have costa, who has been very impressive today"
fcbayern,3e29k2,SwissBliss,2,Tue Jul 21 13:24:54 2015 UTC,"True now. Shaqiri is a good player, there's no denying that, and in my opinion he could easily be a sub for Bayern, but there's no way a young and talented player should be kept on the bench for so long, so in the end it was probably good that he left, although I never thought Inter was the right place for him."

fcbayern,3e0fym,aguyuknew,19,Tue Jul 21 00:22:40 2015 UTC,"1974,1975,1976 3 times European Cup (now the Champions League) winners in a row. The actual trophy now sits in the Allianz Arena.   In 2012 we played in the Champions League Final at the Allianz Arena against Chelsea. Chelsea parked the bus like a motherfucker and after a late Thomas Mueller goal Chelsea scored through Didier Drogba to equalize. We went on to lose on penalties.   The next season was one of the greatest in the clubs history. We rebuilt the squad bringing in players like Mario Mandzukic from Wolfsburg and Javi Martinez from Athletic Bilbao. That season we were absolutely unstoppable. We lost one game in the league to Leverkusen and a few more in the champions league. One of the best performances of that season was the 7-0 aggregate dismantling of Barcelona. That season we won the league, the DFB Pokal, and the Champions league with Robben's last minute goal being burnt into the minds of everyone. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBXSdNbni6c  Last season we brought in Pep Guardiola former Barca Manager. He led us to the League and the Cup again but unfortunately we were beaten by Real Madrid 5-0 on aggregate with 4 of those goals coming in the Allianz Arena.  The season that just ended was a successful one as well. We won the league again but fell out of the cup and CL in the semi finals with a 5-3 aggregate defeat to Barca. Highlights of that leg were Messi turning on the magic in Barcelona scoring or assisting 3 in the last 15 minutes and our win 3-2 in Munich.  Some of the greatest players to play for the club are Franz Beckenbauer (Der Kaiser), Gerd Mueller (Der Bomber), Miroslav Klose (all time top scorer for the world cup and for Germany).  Right now we have many great players. Lahm, Mueller (my personal favourite) Neuer, Robben and Ribery (Robbery) Alaba, Boateng, Lewandowski. And many great youngsters waiting to break into the team. Hojberg, Kimmich, Kurt.   I hope someone can give a little more detailed history. I'm much better at the earlier stuff as I only just started being a fan in 2010."
fcbayern,3e0fym,Beschuss,9,Tue Jul 21 03:15:55 2015 UTC,"Beschus gave a good summed up history about FCB. You forgot about Great Kahn mate THE TITAN ! heh. You can actually get a good amount of detail of history here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich  While you take your time on that I will make note of an Important fact that we are running through currently.   Do not stand with the #pepout BS people around facebook. If you visit pages like Troll football or football related, you will see this toxic crowd. These are by all means plastic fans(well mostly are kids really) flocked around Jupp's treble year and expecting the same thing over again.  -> Last year we had a very difficult time with injuries all around. To the point of the popular joke FCB being a hospital. by the second leg of the season pep had to drive a team with Robben,Ribery,Alaba completely out unable to play UCL. He had a tough time keeping players rotated and rested to play in each league. I think he did a good job at it. He was not able to make any major attacks and had to resort to possession play to keep things safe. Barca at that time when we met was unfortunately at their very peak of performance. Luis had prepared his team well and kept on rotation with no injuries. It had good players all fit and hungry for their treble. We were just having a bad time, and the team did very well of holding things together and I am very proud of them.   -> Also regarding Basti's departure recently. Again, these people do not understand it. Of course everyone is very sad that he left. He and Lahm was like the Heart and Soul together. But it was inevitable. He was getting old and injury prone, so difficulties of keeping him in the 11 were coming up. Rather than being benched, I am happy to see him to a team that he loves to play. If he is treated well in MUFC and he is happy, all the better. So currently Pep is getting players outside as place holders, but good ones. You cant throw a good player right out of the bag into the field expecting high of him. That is why. Also Pep has some say in a transfer but its not entirely the decision of him. There is a director board to that.  -> Finally I think, stay away anti Bayern/Bundasliga sites like goal.com. Just stay away. Any time they report a news about Bayern, they make absolutely 100% sure to say something negative about it. They are so trigger happy to see a player leave and will include some mistreatment or not happy rumor inside it. The most popular being its 'Bayernliga'. If you hear that tell them that for the last 15 years we have the most number of different champions. And if any EPL fan say they are better because they are more competitive because the point gap is low, tell them to switch to Algerian league, they go by a gap 1 or 2 points.  Really like the attitude of joining in as a non-glory hunter and learning the history before joining in. We really don't need fans with high expectations like Real Madrid who boo their own Epic goal keeper and send him off in a pathetic way. That was a crime against football in general."
fcbayern,3e0fym,ThiefMortReaperSoul,2,Tue Jul 21 06:50:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think many people would consider Miro Klose one of the greatest player to play for Bayern.

fcbayern,3dytn3,baddada77,4,Mon Jul 20 23:29:31 2015 UTC,Lmao
fcbayern,3dytn3,Nordlyset,3,Mon Jul 20 19:42:55 2015 UTC,"My hatred for ManU grows exponentially each time I hear LvG lusting after our players. I understand the Schweinsteiger move (even if I dislike it), but Muller, Lewandoski, et all are OFF LIMITS! I can't wait until LvG runs this ManU squad into the ditch like he did at Bayern."
fcbayern,3dytn3,triedby12,0,Mon Jul 20 17:18:29 2015 UTC,This is hilarious. Muller isn't worth anywhere near 100m Euros plus he loves Bayern and wouldn't want to leave nor would they want rid of him. This is either made up or just LVG being an arrogant prick.  Maybe they are mad they realised they got pipped to Vidal by Bayern and ended up having to take an injury riddled Schweini instead? Poor Utd.
fcbayern,3dytn3,Camorristi,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:19:35 2015 UTC,"Man Utd's obsession with our players is getting absolutely ridiculous.   Can they please fuck off, their season will end with another 4th place regardless of who they buy :)"
fcbayern,3dytn3,TheBlindLeader,3,Mon Jul 20 21:57:51 2015 UTC,"It's not Manu's obsession, it's VanGaal's."
fcbayern,3dytn3,Camorristi,-11,Tue Jul 21 17:41:47 2015 UTC,It's not like you will win the CL or not win the Bundesliga either with or without Muller ;)
fcbayern,3dytn3,TheBlindLeader,6,Mon Jul 20 19:08:57 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's not like we won the CL or got permanent half-finals in the last 5 years... Oh wait, it's United that didnt do any of that!"
fcbayern,3dytn3,Camorristi,-7,Tue Jul 21 01:57:03 2015 UTC,"You did, but you won't anymore.  Robben is over the hill, Ribery is done, instead of Schewinsteiger you have Alonso who is 4 years older and slow.  Instead of Kroos you have Thiago.  Instead of Lahm, Pep insists on playing Rafinha and crowding the midfield.      I like Bayern a lot, but I firmly believe that FCB won't win the CL with Guardiola at the helm.  Just an honest opinion."
fcbayern,3dytn3,Skrillcage,6,Mon Jul 20 20:35:36 2015 UTC,"Costa is an excellent replacement for either Ribery or Robben. We have Götze who if he comes out of his shell can replace either of them too. And to say that Thiago instead of Kroos is a step back is laughable, Thiago is a much better player. And I won't even start to talk about on what positions Müller can play and be great... I could go on to explain how it works to you, but to be honest I doubt you would understand."
fcbayern,3dytn3,slipfan2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:38:20 2015 UTC,"I honestly think Bayern have gone backwards since Heynckes, that's all I'm saying.  I don't find the team has the tactical flexibility and the many weapons that Heynckes team had.    Heynckes’ team could starve you off ball with possession, they could press you until you suffocated, they could tear you apart from the wings (Ribery – Alaba axis was phenomenal, and Robben + Muller were very effective).  Defense was solid, Javi Martinez did a great job and Boateng and Dante ooked great.  Mandzukic was a street fighter always kept coming and coming.  That was a great team.  With Guardiola, he started playing Alaba and Lahm in the middle, moved Basti out for Alonso who’s so friggin slow (I’ve seen him for half a decade in the PL, and when he was younger), and started playing this tiki-taka bull that doesn’t work for Bayern.  Gotze has been a disappointment (will he ever gain the Dortmund form?), and both Costa and Vidal are underwhelming signings.  Costa, I’ve been following as United were linked 4 years ago.  He has 9 appearances for Brazil and looked good for Shaktar Donetsk, but doesn't seem the elite player Bayern need to replace Robbery.  Vidal, Juve have been trying to offload for 2 seasons in a row.  Linked by Tuttosport and Gazzetta with United, Arsenal, Real and finally Bayern jumped the shark.  I don’t see Bayern beating Barca or Real, and the other teams (Chelsea, PSG, United) will gradually get stronger, but that’s just an opinion.  Please downvote away ;)"
fcbayern,3dytn3,DwarfwithAutism,2,Mon Jul 20 22:06:16 2015 UTC,I really only think Barca is ahead of us right now.
fcbayern,3dytn3,slipfan2,-3,Mon Jul 20 22:56:03 2015 UTC,"I love Muller, and I appreciate all of his skills greatly, but 100 million euro is really a stupid amount of money. He is not top 5 in the world as wonderful as he is and very few players are worth that valuation, IMO."
fcbayern,3dytn3,DwarfwithAutism,15,Tue Jul 21 12:43:25 2015 UTC,"He is 25 and top 10 in the world, so that's a fair price in my opinion. He's also versatile and basically the only one who is as good at every position in the offense."
fcbayern,3dytn3,wolfmalfoy,0,Mon Jul 20 22:16:54 2015 UTC,It just seems an incredible amount of money. Is the market so inflated?
fcbayern,3dytn3,derrikjs,5,Mon Jul 20 17:44:15 2015 UTC,"Sterling got bought for 60m€ or something. We just bought a 28 year old midfielder(!) for 40m€.  Strikers like Benteke are apparently worth over 40m€. 100m€ for Müller is much, but it would definitely be worth it. There aren't many strikers/forwards available and he has about 8-9 years left."
fcbayern,3dytn3,derrikjs,3,Mon Jul 20 17:47:28 2015 UTC,"Sterling was crazy high for other reasons though, Liverpool likely would have let him go to another league for a much lower price."
fcbayern,3dytn3,flybypost,0,Mon Jul 20 17:48:23 2015 UTC,ya but man city is in need of homegrown player
fcbayern,3dytn3,black_spring,3,Mon Jul 20 17:50:22 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have a player like Muller over all those guys, he still in his prime(still getting better). he has better pedigree then all those guys(world champ, treble winner, German payer of the year, finished 4th in the ball'on door) arguably one of the more consistent player in the world, so 100mil$ isn't crazy"
fcbayern,3dytn3,Whatchanged,5,Mon Jul 20 18:24:04 2015 UTC,"but 100 million euro is really a stupid amount of money.   Okay and what should Bayern do with that money? They paid off the stadium, invested in their academy, and are more or less debt free.  That would be 100 million sitting in the bank but one really good player gone. They would need to replace him and at that level I don't know who they could get without spending a bit chunk of the 100 million."
fcbayern,3dytn3,TheBlindLeader,3,Mon Jul 20 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"Müller is an enigma. He's a constant game changer and winner. When he isn't scoring from thin air he's a total torment on the back line so that other forwards can be. He never gives up and never stops running. He doesn't look like Bale on paper, but Müller would be my choice without hesitation."
fcbayern,3dytn3,black_spring,2,Mon Jul 20 19:31:53 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of with you. If this was FM I'd sell him and get a top player, but who'd you get in the real world with that money without becoming a target of the fans? It seems like a good amount of money and it seems natural to go ""you know what? Add another 40 to that and we have a deal"", but look at these reactions alone. Shit would go down, although objectively he's not worth that money. But again, you can't just go to a shop and buy an upgrade for that money to please the fans like in FM."
fcbayern,3dytn3,TheBlindLeader,5,Mon Jul 20 19:10:42 2015 UTC,"Usually they do, but somehow I feel the connection of Müller and Munich is so big that the buyer has to overpay BIG TIME to both Bayern and Müller himself to get him to leave Munich."

He already said in the past that he would like to play abroad before his career is done. The idea that he would have stayed a one club man was in my opinion wishful thinking of the fans. This was the last opportunitu for him to leave, and while I think they did not wish for him to leave, in the case that he did they would rather sell him than let him leave for free next year."

With their high pressing he sometimes would just take a few strides and be next to the opponents penalty box when they actually though he would pass to someone (as expected from a possession based system). And if you looked at the edge of your screen you could see Alonso moving to the back and left, taking his position and covering for any accidents."

I am planning to start my coaching education soon and this really helps me to learn more about the approach I am planning to implement in my future strategies and so on.
fcbayern,3dv1ih,Eratchos,3,Sun Jul 19 20:03:44 2015 UTC,Even with just about all our youngsters on the pitch we still seem to have dominated Valencia completely. Didn't watch the entire match but this clip looked pretty damn solid for pre-season.
fcbayern,3dv1ih,Chr152112,4,Sun Jul 19 21:18:16 2015 UTC,Then again Valencia also sent their youngsters in
fcbayern,3dv1ih,aliveidt,4,Sun Jul 19 22:00:49 2015 UTC,Could someone explain to me what 'Vertical Passing' is and why it's implemented. The video is telling me it -- apparently quite well -- but I just wanted to be sure.
fcbayern,3dv1ih,timothymr,6,Mon Jul 20 04:48:55 2015 UTC,"Vertical Passing is the essence of Possession football. Pep hates the term Tiki-taka as it is the meaningless rotation of the ball from player to player just to keep the ball off the opponent. It is advantageous but only in that it keeps the ball away from the opponent.  It can be better explained by this clip(sorry it isnt of bayern but educative nonetheless)  Messi 2nd goal against bayern  How did you watch the proceedings? Did you watch the ball, did you watch where the ball might have gone or did you watch your favourite player? One alternative is to watch the enemy lines(in this case bayern).  Pause the clip when the ball is at the foot of busquets.Notice how Gotze,Thiago, Schweini & Lahm are in one horizontal line & Bernat, Alonso, Boateng, Benatia ,Rafinha in another line. Now notice The position of Rakitic'& messi . They are essentially players 'in between the lines' i.e if barca are successfully able to find these players bayerns 2 defensive lines will have failed spectacularly.The aim of total football is to move the ball around so as to stretch the opposition lines & to get 'in behind'. Now Busquets is the best in the world(unfortunately)  & no one presses him or Rakitic' in time. 2 'vertical passes' & messi is 1 on 1 with boateng.  Vertical passes are the one which take out the most opposition players out of a game  within a single pass .The aim is to have our most creative players be 1 on 1 with the opposition back-line(last 20 meters).  Now obviously the enemy understands this & therefore makes those spaces where Rakitic' & messi stood by compacting their midfield. But there is another way around. Compact too much & if if you have got quality wingers the opposition are in trouble.That is why a team with classy wingers(Robben, Ribery) & players who are capable of playing in between the lines(Thiago, Gotze) are benefitted by having possession as the initiative is always with them.The opposition always to adjust & since they are the once reacting & there always will be  a time-lag. If you have good enough players, this time-lag can be converted to goals."
fcbayern,3dv1ih,frequentemente,2,Mon Jul 20 07:00:26 2015 UTC,"Another key point is that these passes are intented to be be played in the so called ""halbräume"" . there is a good article on spielverlagerung.de ( http://spielverlagerung.de/2014/09/06/die-halbraume/ ) where these spaces are described as the most important zone of a football field.   it's not just a random long ball . pep is obsessed with these vertical passes into this space. our whole strategy relies on these passes ( contrary to the overload-heavy heynckess strategy ). and IMO it's just beautiful to watch, but unfortunatly the more casual fans don't get this and peps genius system ...  Edit: http://spielverlagerung.com/2014/09/16/the-half-spaces/ here's the english link !"
fcbayern,3dv1ih,mirror10,2,Mon Jul 20 08:08:03 2015 UTC,These passes are more frequent in teams who defend zonaly. If man to man marking is done overloading is  an approach. Roma 1-7 Bayern is a super example of Roma being manipulated man to man to isolate Cole with robben.

fcbayern,3dttjj,frequentemente,3,Sun Jul 19 12:15:47 2015 UTC,the same Mr. Di Marzio said that Darmian was on his way to Bayern to do a medical.   Journalists know some things but they don't know the whole truth since they are getting information from other people and sometimes these people will give them what they want to hear and not exactly the real truth.
fcbayern,3dttjj,Eratchos,4,Sun Jul 19 12:27:22 2015 UTC,the same Mr. Di Marzio said that Darmian was on his way to Bayern to do a medical.    Link?

fcbayern,3dttjj,DwarfwithAutism,0,Sun Jul 19 12:58:45 2015 UTC,then I am just as wrong with this as Christian Bale was about his killing spree in the movie american psycho(just saw it and felt it was fitting)  EDIT: On a more serious note. I can't find it as well. My theory is that during that period there were reports saying that he was close to joining us. I am sure though that Di Marzio wrote(or someone quoted him) with saying that Bayern were close to signing a deal off. Either there was another source stating the medical or my selective perception just filled the holes of the Darmian saga with what I wanted to hear....
fcbayern,3dttjj,Eratchos,2,Sun Jul 19 13:44:23 2015 UTC,"Yet the same Di Marzio got his transfer to United correct. I think you guys were in for him at first but couldn't agree on the fee, then United swooped along."
fcbayern,3dttjj,khdbdcm,7,Mon Jul 20 00:45:48 2015 UTC,"Juve want him, Bayern don't want to let him go, Götze doesn't want to leave. Doesn't matter how many newspapers say that Juve made offers to Bayern and to Götze. I think it would take a ridiculous sum to see Bayern change their mind."
fcbayern,3dttjj,LSAB,3,Sun Jul 19 13:42:12 2015 UTC,here's a video where he states his opinion   From what he said I really think that his strong opinion is for him to stay. He also says that any transfer is decided by the board. Pep can state his opinion but the main people to do the decision are from the board. Might put a rest to those who say that he lets go of our players

This method of pressing requires all of the players to put in the effort, even if one of them decides not to, a valencia player is free & an attack can be started. The first 11 seemed very much in harmony while pressing.  Still it is pre-season & not much should be read into it but good practice for the team from what I saw."

fcbayern,3dur1c,Insanel0l,27,Sun Jul 19 17:50:45 2015 UTC,"Lots of people here have started following Bayern and football rather recently.  That means that there are many people that came to us during one of our most successful period ever.   Not only are they really really spoiled when it comes to our achievements but also to the players we have.  Just look back 5-7 years and you would be surprised who were our first team players. Everyone who is a long time supporter knows that we had to endure hard times and we've seen teams play for our club that were just a bunch of no-names.  Now, while I get that a lof of those ""newer"" fans don't want to see us letting the players go that they have enjoyed during their prime, please remember we need to rebuild the team every once in a while.  If we don't we are just setting ourself up for failure.  I really get that everybody has a favourite player and it is really sad if that player moves on or is sold. Or if there are rumours about him maybe joining another club.  But please - you are here in /r/fcbayern not /r/schweinsteiger or /r/kroos or /r/goetze etc,etc.  We, as a club, have to stop idiolising players, we have to take of those rose-tinted glasses. No player is bigger than the club. Everbody is replaceable.  We must build for our future. That also means that we have to get players that we think might work for us. That also means we have to get rid of players that we think might not help us.  Even if they are still young and might get better.  We are now a Top5 club. That means that we also have to make the unpopular moves to stay where we are.  We are not sending anyone away just because we want to make Pep or the board happy. Or for some other stupid reasons.  IF we sell players we do so because there is an actual and good reason.  Kroos wanted way more money then we were willing to give him.  Schweinsteiger, in the end, wanted to leave and play for another big team while also having one last big contract in europe.  IF we sell Götze (given the recent rumours) - we are selling him because he didn’t perform the way we expected (and payed) him to.  And please, stop telling us and yourself that we are losing our way.  That is simply not true. Bayern always made those rather unpopular moves. We have sold Gomez,we have sold Elber and we will sell everybody that we deem ""not good enough"".  That might upset some fans and that is okay to a certain degree.  But in the end, you gotta ask yourself - are you a fan of the club,or are you a fan of a certain player ?  If you are a fan of the club, you would know that nobody is bigger than the club and it is just part of the business that players come and go."
fcbayern,3dur1c,pewpewlasersandshit,6,Sun Jul 19 18:27:11 2015 UTC,"we've seen teams play for our club that were just a bunch of no-names.   How can you say that the legendary Braafheid and the true fighter Pranjic together with Rensing and Lell were no names? /s  Braafheid and Pranjic the guys who would make it big in Bayern. When Bild tried to make Pranjic into a starplayer by writing about his performances against Germany and also called him the german killer then you kinda knew what was gonna happen. I wish van Gaal could make strange transfers with United as well.  Enough with the nostalgia. I agree with most of your points. The club is what the majority of this sub cares for but you can't help to appreciate the small things in a club like Bayern. If we compare the team now with the team for a couple of years ago then we have a lot less german nationals in the starting eleven. Although the team is much much stronger, I still kinda miss the days when we had 5-6 players that were part of the first eleven of the German NT.   So when a player like Götze gets rumored to Juve then ofc. people will react since even though many of us haven't actually cared that much about him(compared to other players), he is still a German supertalent that will make it big in 1-2 years and to see him potentially go(luckily it wont happen in the near future) would have been disappointing.  Maybe the emotions are still talking for me but I still find that there should be some guidelines that the club should follow."
fcbayern,3dur1c,Eratchos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:11:37 2015 UTC,"a German supertalent that ~~will~~ might make it big  in 1-2 years   ftfy   there should be some guidelines that the club should follow.   like what ?  our main objective should always be to stay competitive, both in the Bundesliga as well as in the Champions League.  ""Special guidelines"" like the ones Bilbao has (playing only Basques) will only hinders our competitiveness."
fcbayern,3dur1c,pewpewlasersandshit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:29:57 2015 UTC,"for example like bringing own players forward from our academy and to try to sign german nt players(which could benefit us ofc.).  I know that these kind of guidelines may hinder the club, but it may also make the team stronger. It all depends on how the guidelines are implemented and which level of freedom will be used around them.  Ofc. the focal point of the clubs ambitions should be to make itself as a major force competing for the CL title but Bayern is also a big brand that has a reputation in some fields like grooming young players and that is something I don't want to disappear. Are there any players we have promoted that actually has a chance to break into the first team? I can't recall that we have a single one since Muller and Badstuber got promoted."
fcbayern,3dur1c,Eratchos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:45:55 2015 UTC,"The question to ask is if such guidelines would really make us a better team. Bringing up academy players or signing germans just for the sake of doing so might not be the best idea.  Generally i'm all for having lots of german nt players on the team.But only if they really can make us better.   Are there any players we have promoted that actually has a chance to break into the first team? I can't recall that we have a single one since Muller and Badstuber got promoted.    Not really, but big talents don't come by that often. And taking the next step from talent to proven player is yet another step that many talents can't make...  If you look at Barca, they had a lot of La Masia players in their starting XI during the 2008-2012 era.   But now even the storied Barca youth system has problems to bring up more quality players."
fcbayern,3dur1c,pewpewlasersandshit,4,Sun Jul 19 20:07:59 2015 UTC,New Bayern fan here. I've only really been following soccer for the last 18 months. I personally started following Bayern because as a Polish-Canadian my favourite player Robert Lewandowski was moving there from Dortmund. Since then I have been a passionate fan of the club. While I have not had the opportunity to attend any games and most of the ones I watch are while I'm on my phone at school and therefore do not know any of the songs or chants. Many of my friends are in the same boat and in my opinion most foreign fans of Bayern are. While most of us have not been Bayern fans for longer than 3-4 years many of us care for the club and wish for its success just as the fans from Munich do. While the clubs success drew us to Munich I feel as if most of us are true fans now and shall stay through thick and thin.
fcbayern,3dur1c,canaman18,4,Sun Jul 19 19:22:33 2015 UTC,That's great to hear.  I didn't intend to bash new or foreign fans.   Just trying to emphasize that no player is as big (or important) as the club.

Before that, in 2010 we were lucky that Inter parked the bus against Barca (and apparently Robben's shot against United was pure luck as well), and the same again with Chelsea in 2012.    Now, other teams (ie. English) are afraid to face us, and we're seen as a team that's easily able to win the competition, especially when healthy. Did these idiots not live through the ugly Klinsmann days? Under him, we missed all fucking European competitions."

fcbayern,3dur1c,FrigOffCyrus,2,Sun Jul 19 18:06:50 2015 UTC,"They have no idea that it's actually Sammer, KHR, and the rest of Bayern's board that actually executes the buying and selling of players. Sure Guardiola has some say in the matter, but the Kroos saga clearly shows that it's ultimately up to the board and Kalle for transfer decisions. They forgot that Pep never wanted Kroos to leave and had plans to pair Kroos with Thiago in the midfield. It bugs me seeing a lot of this BS, but then again Facebook/Twitter and most social media is low hanging fruit for idiotic comments. I tried defending Pep and a lot of the transfers in a facebook group for an FCB fan club I joined, yet the people refused to see what I said. They only see an evil Spaniard that dismantled a treble winning club and is trying to build Bayern into a Latinized tiki-taka losing squad."
fcbayern,3dur1c,of_skies_and_seas,4,Mon Jul 20 03:43:16 2015 UTC,"It's not just an issue of new fans or people putting players above the club.   Bayern and Barca have a history of bringing up a lot of players through the youth and to see Kroos, Schweini and even Weiser leave while signing foreigners is upsetting to some people. I can understand it. Yes, signing foreigners who are better than the homegrown players may help the club's success and money, but I can understand why people would think it's losing the club's identity.  Some people would rather have a club rely more on local players while sacrificing consistent success, and others want both and don't realize it's not possible. It's just what happens when you want to keep a club at the top level consistently, and it happens to Barca too."
fcbayern,3dur1c,black_spring,4,Sun Jul 19 20:48:38 2015 UTC,"This, for me, is the biggest reason as well. It's what makes us different.

For bayern, we need to look elsewhere right now because of our recent injuries and our squad getting rather old, it would be pointless to simply stack up on youth players and rely on the next generation of german stars. Its nonsense and the board knows that. We got pep as our Head coach and pep brings in a lot of people that might of not joined the club if it werent for him (xabi, thiago etc) And these players are what we need right now. who knows what will happen in 2 years or 4, but saying that bayern is losing its identiy because its relying on international players right now..idk. Also, bayerns youth academy has been rather weak the past couple years, things will improve again.

fcbayern,3dur1c,ThiefMortReaperSoul,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:31:03 2015 UTC,"My say on this is, the fault is much on the uninformed,newly joined fan base. Most of the #pepout banter comes from young people who joined around the treble year. With that score we gave to Barca a big light was shone on Bayern that year. Those who joined then are expecting same type of phenomena on and on. ( For example the page 'bayern munich is my DNA' is not even managed by a bavarian, a possible kid since it went full retarded for entire last week on basti's leave)   So when it comes to players, A clubs objective is to win trophies. That is how clubs become successive. Plus we dont have anything to be afraid on destruction of identity. We have a solid-good academy. Why the world drools on our players are because they are so technical in their positions. Recent leavers like Kroos and Ozil perform in praise worthy levels no matter how bad the team ends up.  Our Identity ? Its still there. Participation in German cultural events, no matter where the player is from, is there.  Our culture is good football, and that is what we give.  We have never been accused for parking buses, our crowds have always been loud and explosive but that the same time respectable. Barca last season tweeted Bayern as a worthy opponent. If you go to a general FB chat thread I have seen Bayern fans always making sense and being constructive on their points. We have been looked as fans who admire good football irrespective of team and applaud when its due. When it comes to home, We never boo'd our players out of the club cough unlike some recent cough club cough did for a legendary cough goal keeper.  That is how I see our culture. That is Bayern culture, accepting 'We Are Who We Are'. We can have good times, we can have bad times, but no matter what happens of the two, We are who we are, Passionate lovers of the game and its players supportive of the club no matter how things turn out. That is our identity.  What we are going through now, is just a change. The team is going through a process of changing, old players leaving, young players entering in. When that happens, we need place holders. What better than to hold a place than good international players like Xabi,Thiago etc ? Under them players will learn from their experience, and pep is a good coach that fits the situation.  Just think about what good it would be if we throw in few young players straight into a starting 11 in a season ?"

fcbayern,3ds5gn,TrueGamingKing,2,Sat Jul 18 22:56:50 2015 UTC,"Just asking, why the fuck is the BUNDESLIGA youtube channel not allowed in germany, thats just so dumb :D"
fcbayern,3ds5gn,Insanel0l,4,Sun Jul 19 09:03:37 2015 UTC,"It's used as an advertisement channel outisde of Germany  In Germany the Bundesliga obviously is hugely popular and the rights to show Bundesliga videos online in Germany were sold for some good money. This isn't the case in many countries outside of Germany, here is where the Bundesliga youtube channel comes in. If the youtube channel wouldn't be blocked in Germany the DFL would probably run into some problems witth the companies they sold the online video rights to (Bild and Sky I believe)"
fcbayern,3ds5gn,fleckes,4,Sun Jul 19 11:46:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that makes sense!"
fcbayern,3ds5gn,Insanel0l,2,Sun Jul 19 12:11:25 2015 UTC,i dont know might be because sky has all the rights to show it in germany and so they just cant show it for free in germany on youtube.
fcbayern,3ds5gn,MarcraM,2,Sun Jul 19 11:38:31 2015 UTC,Copyrights issues. I believe Sky would have to tell them that they are allowed to be shown on the youtube channel.

fcbayern,3dqmto,propellerhead92,5,Sat Jul 18 16:43:39 2015 UTC,Film studies because I wanted to become as employable as possible! Thank you :)
fcbayern,3dqmto,SevenSulkySerbs,2,Sat Jul 18 18:37:23 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! I like the enthusiasm. I didn't sport any FC Bayern apparel for mine earlier this year, but I did stream the game against Mainz during the ceremony. Didn't hear a word that the commencement speaker said."
fcbayern,3dqmto,TweetPoster,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:27:08 2015 UTC,Thank you! You have to show your support somehow! I also watched the highlights of the Barcelona game from 2013 when I was waiting. I'm glad that this is a common way to pass time before major moments
fcbayern,3dqty9,crane444,11,Sat Jul 18 15:53:49 2015 UTC,"He is something special. Even after his injury he seems even more determined to prove himself. I think he'll be our key player this'd year and i agree that he will someday be the world s best, he simply oozes class"
fcbayern,3dqty9,TurntToast,3,Sat Jul 18 17:24:55 2015 UTC,People didn't believe me when I said he has the potential to be better than Schweini. He's been injured for most of his time but now is his chance and I think he's gonna be a legend for us. I'm so glad to see him hitting his stride.
fcbayern,3dqty9,FrigOffCyrus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:33:31 2015 UTC,"it really is, he was always a massive prospect (who was already established as a quality player) and seeing him truly making those leaps is great. i agree he'll become a club legend-- it was a pretty big deal to leave barca for bayern at his age while being lined up as the next iniesta/xavi"
fcbayern,3dqty9,TurntToast,4,Sun Jul 19 18:53:58 2015 UTC,He is a class player who plays with heart and has phenomenal ability to pass
fcbayern,3dqty9,bayernfan25,8,Sat Jul 18 17:40:21 2015 UTC,He's also sexy
fcbayern,3dqty9,laddkemtonius,4,Sat Jul 18 17:47:16 2015 UTC,He's our maestro
fcbayern,3dqty9,firecracker123,2,Sat Jul 18 18:37:10 2015 UTC,He really reminds me of Zidane.
fcbayern,3dqty9,karlol,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:13:45 2015 UTC,He's been unbelievable! I think he's been our best player ever since he came back from his injury earlier this year.
fcbayern,3dqty9,sinrezz,-5,Sun Jul 19 00:40:29 2015 UTC,Unfortunately by then he wont be playing for us anymore.
