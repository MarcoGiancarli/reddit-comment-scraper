loseit,3dyz2h,theserpentsmiles,2,Mon Jul 20 19:06:22 2015 UTC,Dude. MFP is a life saver. Down 65lbs 310CW 375SW. All my life I tried to loose the weight and didn't know why my efforts did nothing. Then I started to track my food. That 65lbs was lost since I started MFP in January.
loseit,3dyz2h,theserpentsmiles,2,Mon Jul 20 20:55:51 2015 UTC,I just made an account and I'll actually stick with it this time. Thank you :)
loseit,3dxoa9,redundanteater,18,Mon Jul 20 11:40:58 2015 UTC,The ability to scratch anywhere is glorious! No depending on my hubby anymore. I also find myself sitting with my knees to my chest more often. Congrats on your success!! Edit:grammar
loseit,3dxoa9,Blue_Fox9,8,Mon Jul 20 11:53:51 2015 UTC,Great NSV! I still can't get a spot between my shoulder blades. Need to do more upper body stretching.
loseit,3dxoa9,cmxguru,4,Mon Jul 20 15:11:35 2015 UTC,"I'm almost there, so close. But I already like the bigger range of motion. What a NSV. Couldn't agree more.  Keep it up!"
loseit,3dxoa9,KHShadowrunner,5,Mon Jul 20 13:40:44 2015 UTC,I didnt even consider that was possible!!
loseit,3dxoa9,MidshipSquirrel,2,Mon Jul 20 16:38:41 2015 UTC,"Haha, thats a nice NSV. I still rub my back on a doorframe sometimes like a big bear on a tree. But i also got something like this, which is amazing. :D  â€‹    M29 / 5'9'' / SW: 442lbs CW: 371lbs GW: 190lbs / MFP: Multanis"
loseit,3dyaoq,specialflesh,16,Mon Jul 20 15:01:20 2015 UTC,Time to ramp it up! Download myfitnesspal and log your calories.
loseit,3dyaoq,cmxguru,12,Mon Jul 20 15:42:36 2015 UTC,"First off, 20 pounds is losing one pound twenty times. That's a lot of ass kicking! Good job. What's your current plan/diet like?"
loseit,3dyaoq,TheUncleRyRy,7,Mon Jul 20 15:07:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that really means a lot to me! Right now my diet consists of mostly meat and vegetables. I try to do leaner meats like chicken most of the time. I also exercise everyday even if I only have time to do 20 minutes of exercise."
loseit,3dyaoq,JDSmith90,6,Mon Jul 20 15:15:55 2015 UTC,20-30 min a day can be all you need depending on what you do. I lost 30 lbs over a month and a half doing 15-30 min of non cardiovascular working out 3 times a week. I counted calories drank a lot of ice water and bam! So don't ever feel bad about only having 20 min.
loseit,3dyaoq,HexHoodoo,4,Mon Jul 20 20:17:10 2015 UTC,What'd you do?  Walking?
loseit,3dyaoq,jjness,3,Tue Jul 21 14:41:20 2015 UTC,"As a big guy, it's not that hard to lose 20 pounds, and it's not that noticeable externally, but by god is it a hell of an achievement and not to be discounted! Keep it up! I'm working to get to 300 first (just 9 more pounds to go!) and then 280 so you're ahead of me in this marathon grind! Keep at it!"
loseit,3dyaoq,JeffSC94,3,Mon Jul 20 18:24:48 2015 UTC,Thank you! No one is ahead of anyone else.  We are all doing the best we can! Those nine pounds will come off soon! Keep going!
