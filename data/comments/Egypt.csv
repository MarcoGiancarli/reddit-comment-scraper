Egypt,3e6z09,Kermitthefrog1171,7,Wed Jul 22 12:59:24 2015 UTC,"I can sum up because Egyptians (and Arabs in general) get asked this question a gazillion times.   Liberal secular 'West is best' Egyptians: ""Gays are humans too! They should have full rights! Egyptian society is backwards for not accepting them."" Apathetic 'but still empathetic' Egyptians: I don't mind it and I don't judge them for it but if they could keep it in their homes and not shove it in our faces then I'll be happy. Faux-progressive 'secretly fascist' Egyptians: Don't we have other problems? We need to fix our more important problems first before we talk about the gays. Religious 'let's modernize Islam!' Egyptians: Homosexuality itself is not a sin but sodomy is. Being homosexual is just an added test from God. As long as they don't sodomize each other they are fine. Conservative 'el3orf' Egyptians: It's disgusting and they're disgusting and they should not be allowed to mingle with us normal people. There are no homosexuals here in Egypt, they are just imported from the degenerate West.They are a corrupting influence on society and they should be jailed. Ultra-conservative 'baqiya wa tatamaddad' Egyptians: They are a cancer, they should be shot in the streets, or executed publicly to serve as a warning to others."

Egypt,3e4xkr,triangleking,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:10:47 2015 UTC,"The honest answer is...sort of. Other people have been saying that all of the ISIS stuff is strictly in the Sinai, but that's simply not true. Just in the last month there have been attacks at two of Egypt's main sites (police shooting at the pyramids and an attempted car bomb in Luxor). There is some risk, but it's also a lot better than it has been. Additionally, because of the risk and low tourism numbers, the deals you can get are incredible. I've lived here for several years now. It's a great, but challenging country. In general, I would still say it is safe enough to come as long as you hire a guide, but at this point the situation is still too volatile to just come by yourself. Ten years ago you could have grabbed a Lonely Planet and gone exploring. Not anymore. Come to Egypt, but don't do it by yourself."

Egypt,3dyaz7,watamiinfor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:03:29 2015 UTC,"Long comment incoming: I'm not gonna say that it will be easy if you study. that would be an obvious lie. so i'm not going to lie to you. This is also coming from someone who knows a lot of fellow colleagues there.(Mind you they all got excellent grades in their schools or secondary certificate (msa).But, most of them are probably below 2.6 GPA which is good to them for a first year.) ASU Engineering is hard, it's probably the hardest in Egypt right now. the exams they put the people through. the way they treat the students there. When a professor is too lazy to explain something they mark it for the student as a ""self-study"" no matter how important that thing is. their curriculum is hard to wrap up. You're probably going to have study like never before there if you really want to go to ASU Engineering. However, I know nothing about how credible it's degree is. But, working abroad requires some sort of license for you to be an actual Engineer. you'll either have to evaluate credit hours to match the specified country's credit hours so you might spend some time doing that. Unless, it's certified by a credible certificate like ABET. which only 2 universities/higher education degrees in egypt have: AUC and AASTMT. For a broader and easier category of engineering I recommend AUC or Cairo university. Cairo university has A LOT of departments in engineering has the highest number i think including aerospace/aeronautical engineering. Keep in mind, it is also not easy but it's not hard as ASU . But, if AUC is an option and there are no financial issues go with AUC. you'll be much more at ease, they'll make you study, they'll get you to do wonderful activities and it's a worldwide known university internationally certified. TL;DR : my advice is :Go for AUC if you feel that you're financially ok with it and if you want a good future,an assured certified degree, a balanced program like mechatronics/mechanical engineering is available. otherwise, Cairo university or AASTMT."
Egypt,3dyaz7,Vemyx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:25:05 2015 UTC,"Wow, holy shit. I honestly thought I would either get a response saying ""It's just rumors, man"" or another saying ""It's hard, but the ASU Engineer accumulates more raw knowledge than engineers of other universities."" In both cases, I would've proceeded with my application. Now I just see that it's not worth it.  I can't afford AUC, unfortunately, but right now, you've spoken about two of my other main options (AASTMT and CU). The other is Alexandria University. What do you think of it?"
Egypt,3dyaz7,Vemyx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:05:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not disrespecting ASU in any kind of way. I agree with you it does have the most raw material of engineering. It's more likely the elite engineering college. But it also gives you a hard time studying. I know a few friends who study electrical engineering in Alexandria university. They're doing fine. And I think it is a very credible university. It's on the same level as Cairo university. All that matters, is what best suits your needs. Depending on your location, your financial status, your capability and ways to study. Etc.. It all depends on that. If you can spend 9 hours studying and eating books then go for ASU. If not then there are a lot of other options. Good luck deciding your career and your future."

Egypt occupies an ambiguous position: while it has cultural, ethnic and linguistic ties to both the Mashriq and the Maghreb, it is unique and different from both.  Egypt is located at the center/heart of the Arab world and that is why the headquarters of the Arab League is located in the Egyptian capital of Cairo. Thus, it is usually seen as being part of neither; however, when it is grouped with one or the other, it is generally considered part of the Mashriq on account of its closer ties to the Levant."

Egypt,3dk0jy,Ginxez,0,Sun Jul 19 11:08:06 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate saying it, something similar to the Cultural Revolution that Mao carried out in China (and yes it was genocidal) could benefit all Arab nations, specially Egypt. That was the only way the Chinese rediscovered what made their cultural a great one in history.  It doesn't have to be communist, it can be anything however the only way forward is to discard the old backward ways and the take best bits of the existing culture forward, that can be achieved either through a long process of cultural evolution (e.g. Western Society) or a short period (decades) of absolute brutality and single minded reshaping with wise and consistent leadership. Jamal tried but failed, Saddam tried and turned out to be despot with no forward thinking. One of things China did so well was to avoid getting sucked into long foreign adventures. Jamal's experiment failed because he failed to first build the nation before engaging in hostilities with the west. Saddam failed because he was a despot from day one and therefore every plan he laid would be diseased.  As for Egypt today, well you just have to look back at how the population trample over each other to give back their rights to a military despot, there is no hope when the population chooses comfort and short security over a long term toil to achieve greatness. When Egyptians manage to overthrow the yoke of one despot, it only took a couple of year of manufactured crisis to hand themselves over to another military despot.  As a nation and I know I am generalising, Egypt does not know how to think for itself neither does it have the countenance for the long and arduous struggle that would be required to achieve true justice and greatness. Hence the reason why I said a Cultural Revolution similar to China's is required to break with the old ways and demeaning leadership. The challenge is where would you find that wise leadership, when Egypt as a whole destroys its most active youth as political enemies."

Property here is going to become insanely expensive and they are increasing year on year in the right place.  what u/minymina/ wrote is correct.  I will just add 6th October City as there are some nice compounds that way. It's a bit far but again it is nice to live outside of the smog. Near stuff like Arcane, Galleria Park and Mall of Arabia as well as Mall of Egypt.  Mohandessin, Dokki, Zamalek have a lot of foreigners in them with Zamalek having the most.

Egypt,3dfp3s,minymina,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:09:43 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you want to buy a house not rent. It really depends on your standards. Seeing how your you're from Canada, I'd presume you wouldn't want to live in a sha3by neighborhood.  Dont know about Alexandria but in Cairo an average apartment costs between 600,000 EGP - 900,000 EGP ($76,613 - $114,920). If suburbs like New Cairo, houses / villas can go up to 2m EGP - 5m EGP ($255,378 - $638,504) while apartments are around 1.5m EGP ($191,534). Of course, there's no real price, this is Egypt.  Most new properties can be bought with non-interest based yearly installments, though the amount and time span depends on the agreement.  Haggling is heavily required and if you're buying a newly built house (whither apartment, duplex or villa), be ready because they'll do whatever they can to scam you.  Another thing, if you're looking to buy something, say in New Cairo, I recommend you go straight to the developer as brokers will add on around a million EGP to the price.  Most of all, for the love of all that is good, dont let them know you're from Canada or else they'll start seeing $$. I'm sure you're aware of this but always keep that in mind. I'd recommend you bring a family member or close friend who actually lives in Egypt along with you when property hunting.  There are cheaper options but again, you'll probably want to live in say Maadi, Heliopolis or Misr El Gedida. Coming from Canada, or abroad in general, those really are the best place to live.  I can't exactly find a proper site with regards to Cairo, they all look dodgy.  The links below are legit though and are directly owned by (popular) real estate developers in Egypt. These two only operate in New Cairo. They don't feature the price because again, nothing is final in Egypt. You have to call them up or email them for a quota but keep in mind they'll only give you the starting price.  http://hpd.com.eg/  http://www.mountainview-eg.com/  Source: Euro - Egyptian looking to move to Egypt in three years - my father also just bought a house last year in Hyde Park.

Egypt,3dfp3s,minymina,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:22:07 2015 UTC,"""average apartment costs between 600,000 EGP - 900,000 EGP"" Do apartments work differently in Egypt? In Canada an apartment is something you don't own, you pay monthly fees to live there. I can't imagine an apartment costing $100,000 a month so I assume it's a one time payment? Do you own it?"
Egypt,3dfp3s,minymina,2,Thu Jul 16 00:37:15 2015 UTC,"As mentioned in my original comment, I assumed you were looking to buy, not rent. Yes, you can own apartments in Egypt. Though it's much more difficult to own an apartment in central Cairo then say in the suburbs like 6th of October city or New Cairo.  Personally speaking, you're better off buying in the suburbs then central Cairo. It's more expensive but it's better to buy a new apartment for say 1.5m EGP then an old one in a rundown building for 900,000 EGP. Its also a lot cleaner and less crowded. Most suburbs are only half an hour drive to Cairo so dont assume its that far a distance.  Keep in mind that I'm referring to prices regarding upscale / upper middle class neighborhoods. Neighborhoods which mimic the lifestyle of Europe and the US.  If you're looking to rent, apartments range from about +6,000 EGP. Though I'm not entirely familiar with renting prices.   To be honest, I don't own property in Egypt myself but I'm looking to buy a house in New Cairo when and if I move within three years time. Most of my knowledge comes from property hunting with my dad when he brought a villa in New Cairo.  EDIT: Grammar"

Egypt,3cunb7,zetsui,5,Fri Jul 10 22:31:42 2015 UTC,"Traditional roast Egyptian fish is usually tilapia, but you can substitute with any white (mildly fatty) fish. I think I found a good recipe on CBC sofra  Ingredients:   Two pounds of Tilapia Half a cup of Wheat bran 1 tsp Cumin 1 Spring Onion 1 tbsp ginger 1 tsp Chili Powder Some Rosemary Juice of a lemon Some Olive Oil A couple of Cloves of Garlic salt and pepper to taste   Preparation   Chop the Spring onions and the garlic and mix in the salt, pepper, chili, cumin, ginger, and olive oil and pour it over your fish (don't forget to season the inside of the fish as well.) Pack the outside (and only the outside) of the fish with the wheat bran then squeeze a lemon over it. Cover it with tin foil and roast it in a 395 F oven for 30 minutes.   As for the Tahini sauce, I just asked my mother for the recipe, so sorry if the measurements are a bit weird:-  Ingredients:   1 tea cup of Tahini paste 1 tsp white vinegar (some people use lemon, but we don't) 1 tsp salt 2 Crushed cloves of garlic 2 tbsp corn oil (can be substituted for 1 tbsp of olive oil) 1/2 tsp cumin Boiling Water as needed for consistency Chopped parsley to garnish   Preparation:   To the Tahini paste add the vinegar, salt, cumin, garlic, and the oil then mix Add the boiling water slowly while you mix until it reaches the consistency you need Garnish with chopped parsley leaves."

Egypt,3cuhyr,pyrapyrahigh,2,Fri Jul 10 21:51:20 2015 UTC,"Well, consoles are generally priced like the US/UK (PS4 player here). I'm sure most have faster internet but mine is 4mb, never experience lag or disconnection (depends on the game and PSN itself, though). I buy my games from local online retailers. The game prices are not true to their real price in the states so sometimes I resort to buying from the PS store with my credit card. For Amazon to ship to Egypt, you need to use services like Aramex Ship and Shop. They process your order and they reserve a P.O box in the states for you. Once it arrives to said P.O box, they fly your product over to Egypt. Delivery prices are expensive IMO but the delivery doesn't take longer than expected (according to my dad who used it once).  How's gaming in the UAE?"

Egypt,3cuhyr,MorphaKnight,2,Sat Jul 11 00:59:46 2015 UTC,"On average, a good majority of Egyptians in their homes have less than 4 mbps I believe. Currently sometime this year (or the next) the internet in Egypt is set to be overhauled by finally introducing fiberoptic cables. Hopefully...  I own both a pc and had several consoles. Don't bother with Nintendo consoles because you will have a hard time getting it games. I usually resorted to buying them from abroad (whenever I traveled, or a family member traveled). Xbox 360/One are also extremely hard to find and usually sold thanks to Kinect. Playstation has always been the dominant console in Egypt and a large variety of games are readily available at most stores. If not, people can either resort to buying from friends and relatives traveling or there are some facebook groups and middle eastern/Egyptian websites that act as middle men and bring the game directly to your doorstep. Although I never tried that.   Having said that, the culture of gaming in Egypt is unfortunately minimal. The only game almost all Egyptians play is football (be it the newest iteration of Fifa or the now nonexistent pro evo). Rarely do you ever see people on consoles playing something other than Fifa. To the point that whenever someone asks you to play with the playstation, they are pretty much referring to playing Fifa.  There are also several internet cafe's although now they too have largely changed into places to play Fifa on their playstation. From time to time, I still do see people playing counter strike 1.6 on PC's in internet cafes."
Egypt,3cuhyr,EzzoMahfouz,3,Sat Jul 11 01:47:03 2015 UTC,What is this you say about Egyptian network providers switching to fibre optic cables? Is this true?!

Egypt,3cuhyr,minymina,3,Sat Jul 11 13:21:47 2015 UTC,"Relying on getting things from abroad seems like the best thing to do if you travel or have someone that travels. I hope with fibre optics people will start exploring the possibilities and develop the gaming scene on Egypt as a whole. Maybe console manufacturers would realize the sheer size of the Egyptian population and start targeting it with ads and offers, like they did to China recently."
Egypt,3cuhyr,EzzoMahfouz,2,Sat Jul 11 16:30:31 2015 UTC,Game development is slowly becoming a thing in Egypt.
Egypt,3cuhyr,MorphaKnight,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:54:04 2015 UTC,This is inspiring to see. I'd love an AMA from them.
Egypt,3cuhyr,EzzoMahfouz,2,Sun Jul 12 15:28:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I is/was a hardcore Nintendo fan, and I mainly relied on relatives or traveling abroad getting my games. When I switched with the PS3, I've found that the games were easily available although they were expensive. Some of the PS3 launch titles (and other terrible games) still carry a $60 price tag till the PS3's later years.  Another thing that annoyed me is that I just recently bought a 3DS while abroad in Europe and when setting my location, you had African countries like Chad, Sudan or Angola but Egypt was nonexistent. It makes zero sense.  Also interestingly enough, but I do recall a pc gaming online publisher that has several free to play games (I think Blacklight Retribution was one of them a long time back) and they had a country block on several countries like Russia, China, Vietnam. Egypt was one of those countries. And it seemed that one of the reasons the country block was made to prevent hackers from joining their servers. So it seems that online, we have built a bit of a stereotype.."

Egypt,3cuhyr,ultrapwnd,2,Sat Jul 11 13:23:22 2015 UTC,"That's nice to hear. Isn't there any local street shops that sell games cheaper than 'official' distributors like Virgin?  Gaming in the UAE is probably the best in the middle east. Games are priced exactly as they should, gaming shops/online retailers are plenty and they're always competing with each other regarding offers and pricing. If you ever needed Amazon for some reason (You wouldn't, because everything is available here including limited editions, packages and bundles) they do direct delivery for most orders. My own internet is 20mbps thanks to Fibre Optics so lag is probably not possible. The UAE has a huge gaming scene and we've been very spoiled.  I hope you guys will start getting spoiled too. Egypt has a large population and surely there must be gamers much larger in quantity than the UAE. Is it looked down by society of anything? Or do the average person just not have time or interest in gaming?  Also, in regards to game availability, are you able to obtain niche/unpopular games, say, like Hyperdimension Neptunia or maybe games for consoles like the Wii U?"
Egypt,3cuhyr,ultrapwnd,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:41:53 2015 UTC,"niche/unpopular games, say, like Hyperdimension Neptunia   lol I'm from Canada and it's sort of hard to find retail copies of this in stores, unless you are referring to the re;birth games on Vita. I doubt you would find this in Egypt easily.  Are niche Japanese games like this widely available in UAE?"
Egypt,3cuhyr,MorphaKnight,2,Sat Jul 11 06:16:35 2015 UTC,"Lol I didn't expect that. Neptunia is available in a wide selection of stores, and you can find it pretty easily for Vita or PS3, along with other Japanese games. As long as they're translated, you can easily find them. The PS Vita's shelf has nothing but niche Japanese games, and a surprisingly huge collection of them.  Games with inappropriate material, though, will not be available in stores. After all the UAE is an Islamic country."
Egypt,3cuhyr,ultrapwnd,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:49:57 2015 UTC,"It isn't like impossible to find or anything, but it isn't one of those games where you can walk into any store that sells video games and expect to find it. You would have to call around a bit and see who has it.   Most of the Vita games are easy to find in video game stores as they are new, but the ps3 games are older and a bit more difficult. Worst case scenario you can order it from Amazon or Ebay.  Is Hyperdevotion Noire available in the UAE? The cover might seem a bit ""inappropriate"""
Egypt,3cuhyr,ultrapwnd,2,Sat Jul 11 15:24:44 2015 UTC,"I've never seen Hyperdevotion Noire in our stores here, lol, they probably don't sell it.. at least the ones that I deal with."
Egypt,3cuhyr,EzzoMahfouz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:18:38 2015 UTC,"Ah well, it's cool to know that gaming is so popular in the UAE. Out of curiosity is anime and manga stuff widely available?   I know there is a Kinokyuna in a mall somewhere in Dubai, but is there anything outside of that?"
Egypt,3cuhyr,lytali,2,Sat Jul 11 16:33:36 2015 UTC,Dubai does have its own comic con so I would assume anime and manga is very popular.
Egypt,3cuhyr,cant_make_up_my_mind,2,Sat Jul 11 17:15:59 2015 UTC,"I've seen videos of that before, it keeps getting bigger every year :D"
Egypt,3cuhyr,minymina,2,Sat Jul 11 17:33:35 2015 UTC,"Manga is somewhat available but not anime, it's rare to find anime blu-rays or seasons in shops. There are small shops that are dedicated to bringing popular manga/comic books and sometimes, figures and accessories, but there aren't a large bunch of them, I think it's safe to say most, if not all of them are in malls. The nearest shop might be a long drive.. Overall the availability is reasonable, but much, much less than video games.  e: That's not to say there's no interest in anime/manga, the interest in fact is huge. As MorphaKnight said, we have comic cons and all. The retailers, though, aren't exactly plenty."
Egypt,3cuhyr,cant_make_up_my_mind,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:16:00 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the info :D"
Egypt,3cuhyr,minymina,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:32:44 2015 UTC,"Gaming in the UAE sounds sweet.  Actually contrary to what the other guy said, the Wii U is very much available here in Egypt. Stores like Select and Best Buy sell them in all branches although the collection of games aren't that varied. On the Internet, you'll find the console and its games easily. But he is right about the Playstation being the dominant console. When I had a 360 for 4 years, literally little to no Egyptian people met on GTA IV/V, Halo, CoD or any other game besides my two friends who had Xboxes. And he's also right about what he said about FIFA.  About indie games: they're easily available if on demand. Some indie games pick up in Egypt like Outlast and Alien: Isolation so retailers start ordering them from abroad and selling them. But if an indie game isn't popular than don't expect to see it anywhere but the PS store or Xbox Marketplace."

Internet is just the worst, latency is always through the roof, connection drops a lot of the time, I have lost countless rounds thanks to connection issues and getting kicked because my ping is too high. As my fellow Egyptian said, most people have a connection less than 4mbps, mainly the 1mbps connection. Games are pretty unavailable here as physical copies and you will pay a hefty sum to get them, but some small businesses are emerging to cure that issue.  Hardware is a big problem here, I'm talking about gaming PCs not lousy consoles, I'm working on a $700 rig that'll cost me much more buying its parts from here and therr are things that aren't available here at all. At least I can thank God for VPN and digital copies, but taking 5 days to download a game is really frustrating, I'm waiting impatiently for the fiberoptics to get done"
Egypt,3cuhyr,basilarchia,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:49:07 2015 UTC,"Hardware is a big problem here, I'm talking about gaming PCs not lousy consoles   There's a street in Cairo that's lettered with computer equipment.
