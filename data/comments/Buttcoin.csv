Buttcoin,3e2e90,DrMoneyMaker,24,Tue Jul 21 12:51:56 2015 UTC,"I did not read the S-1 but i can imagine that ""the CEO getting abducted by aliens"" was also not mentioned as a risk right?   Thank you for this comment, DrMoneyMaker, you truly get it.   This seems apt: ""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you and carry on ignoring you."""
Buttcoin,3e2e90,zom-ponks,9,Tue Jul 21 13:30:45 2015 UTC,"""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you and carry on ignoring you.""   ""First they ignore you, then you have to actually do something worthwhile that solves real world problems better than existing solutions if you want that to change.""  Butters get to the ignoring part and think that's the hard part."
Buttcoin,3e2e90,RghoNomic,6,Tue Jul 21 15:47:54 2015 UTC,"This is an apt comment because ""risks"" really does have to include any even hypothetically plausible risk, up to and including aliens. Some real-life ""risks"" lists look like science fiction. That they didn't mention Bitcoin means they seriously don't consider it the slightest bit plausible."
Buttcoin,3e2e90,dgerard,7,Tue Jul 21 14:06:07 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong but your not entirely right either. Reg S-K Section 503(c) while vague does provide guidance on what risks need to be listed. A common exemption is ""Risks that could apply to any issuer or any offering"" So for example a company wouldn't have to disclose ""Our CEO is a smoker and could quite possibly die in the next year, severely affecting our operations,"" as this could apply to anyone or any company. Your right in that if there's doubt, we 99.9% of the time will disclose it, but we don't go pants on head silly with it, as that has the exact opposite effect of what we are trying to achieve. While bitcoin ""could"" and maybe should, depending on the company, make the list it is no where close to that point today. The biggest issue here is disclosure liability, which means that for this to even become an issue, the risk has to materialize. Even still it is very hard for investors to prove that a material risk existed and that management/counsel/auditors knew or should have known about. Also we tend to use what is known as ""bespeaks caution"". Look at this section to see what I'm talking about    SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   That is a companies best line of defense. Honestly though, disclosure litigation is impossible to forecast. You could list everything, and then be sued for providing too many ""risks"". No shit, that has actually happened. At this point in time, disclosures are done to get past the SEC finance review, while paying lip service to the investors. So basically this company/ counsel/ and auditors, are confident that the SEC does not view bitcoin as an even remote possible of being a risk, for this company. Other companies might/should list virtual currency as a potential risk. Its a judgment game and while its not fun, it certainly pays the bills."

Buttcoin,3e2e90,bailbtc,5,Tue Jul 21 15:17:43 2015 UTC,"On the off chance that one individual was responsible for your company, maybe. If for example one guy knew your ""coke"" formula, and that guy had it memorized, and never wrote it down, and if he died you would lose access to it, then yes. Wanna know how many companies would make it to filing an S1 under those conditions? Probably zero. However it was more to illustrate a point of what does an doesn't need to be included. Ex) metor strikes, revolutions, earthquakes, worldwide starvation. Ultimately each company is different, and even given the examples above I could find a scenario in which disclosure of those events is preferably. Its a judgment call."
Buttcoin,3e2e90,romad20000,5,Tue Jul 21 15:33:19 2015 UTC,There are plenty of media empire companies strongly built around the star at the center.

I'm not cool enough to be able to audit those. I'm thinking was thinking along the lines of gas/oil, non profits, mfg, etc..."

Martha Stewart's talents, efforts, personality and leadership have been, and continue to be, critical to our success. The diminution or loss of the services of Martha Stewart, and any negative market or industry perception arising from that diminution or loss, would have a material adverse effect on our business. While our other key executives have substantial experience and have made significant contributions to our business, Martha Stewart remains the personification of our brands as well as our senior executive and primary creative force.   So yeah I was kinda wrong on that. Learn something new everyday."

Who exactly do you think the S-1 goes to? The fucking congress? Neither management, its counsel, or KPMG thought it was necessary to include ""muh butts"" in that filing. Which means neither KPMG or management/counsel thinks that it has even the remotest of possibilities of being an issue. Or if it is an issue its so broad, that it falls under the clearly exempt sections of 503(c) mainly  ""Risks that could apply to any issuer or any offering"". Plus in order for this to even become an issue, the ""risk"" has to actually materialize. Then you could try to nail them for failure to disclose."

Can't say I ever saw myself doing this for a living. 10 years ago if you told me that I'd be running crypto-disruption for Goldman I just wouldn't have believed you. Its a path I never really thought I'd ever go down, but sometimes you just take the job you can get and grow into it. Its whatever. I'd be lying to say I still enjoy doing this from 9-5.   The problem with institutional finance is that there's such an enormous amount of low level work you need to do before you can move up in the ranks. I'm not in love with my job, but Goldman Sachs is a decent place to work, probably better than a lot of my alternatives. That being said, after 4 years on the Crypto Disruption Desk I'm definitely starting to think about what else is out there. Don't get me wrong, its been an amazing year for us. We all landed steep bonuses after the Paycoin meltdown. The Ross Ulbricht sentencing was one of the best joint efforts I have ever been a part of, seeing the Fed/JSOC/Goldman work in such perfect harmony was amazing. Props to Bernanke for personally forging those Ross Ulbricht diary entries, and Ben Lawsky had an absolute stroke of genius when he fabricated those assassination orders. The future is seemingly bright, with our coordinated attack on Bruce Fenton and the Bitcoin Foundation looming, but I'm just not as excited as I used to be. We've finalized our attack plan on the Winklevoss twins, and it's currently lined up for mid Q4, but if I'm not around to coordinate the attack, I've probably transferred to to the Cartel Money Laundering Division. Apparently now that Chapo is back out we're going to be seeing some high volume, almost as much as the HSBC days. Keep on keepin on sakkara   © COPYRIGHT 2015 GOLDMAN SACHS, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED"

Buttcoin,3e0dy4,Vba1474,31,Tue Jul 21 11:05:57 2015 UTC,"Because it's not designed properly on the economic, technological, and structural levels.  The idea that fixing supply will make bitcoin deflationary relies on unrealistic assumptions (that demand will always be slightly increasing) or an incomplete understanding of basic supply and demand (forgetting that both supply and demand affect price). Price will only be stable if demand is stable.  Then, consider that the more bitcoin's price goes up and the more useful bitcoin is as a speculative commodity, the less preferable it then becomes to spend it as a currency (if dollars lose value over time, but bitcoin gains value, it's always better to spend dollars and save bitcoin). However, the reverse isn't true either because bitcoin is essentially a foreign currency for everyone in the world, and nobody would want to hold a foreign currency that loses purchasing power over time, relative to their local one.  In meeting its primary objective of being a decentralized, trustless currency, bitcoin requires transactions to be dramatically slower and more computationally expensive than current transaction systems. To put it another way, the very way bitcoin was designed makes it harder for it to be improved in ways that are important to most people.  Can it become faster and cheaper? Yes, but 6 years in and billions of dollars in investments later, that solution has yet to be implemented; a lot of money has been spent on making bitcoin work for the masses, and blockchain transactions have at best remain unchanged and at worst become slower and more expensive. Instead, startups have just found ways to work around its limitations (i.e. offchain transactions for speed, tying it to credit card networks for ease of spending), in which case, why involve Bitcoin at all? Bitcoin doesn't have a killer app not because of external factors, but because the biggest obstacle it needs to overcome is itself.  Yet, by design there's no central authority to decisively steer bitcoin forward and improve it in fundamental ways. The block size limit debate will never achieve true consensus because everyone wants bitcoin to become different things, nevermind those who think bitcoin should never change because that's the way Satoshi envisioned it in the whitepaper. In bitcoin parlance, the ""incentives aren't aligned"". So bitcoin will inevitably always follow the path of least resistance, and that's often just the status quo."

The internet was not 'broken by design', there was no fundamental flaws that stoped the internet from growing and expanding. If you think there was what were those problems?

No matter how easy you make bitcoin, and how useful you can make it for the 'common joe', that is not going to overcome the basic problem with bitcoin, that it is fundamentally flawed from the ground up, the 'rule by math' says you cannot processes more than one transaction at a time, would be the equivalent to the internet being able to send only one packet at a time.  How can you overcome that problem and still be able to call it 'bitcoin' is just not possible."
Buttcoin,3e0dy4,ScientologyVsBitcoin,5,Tue Jul 21 08:53:51 2015 UTC,"I would also point out another huge thing that separates Bitcoin from the early Internet.  Bitcoin has been available and, relative to the early Internet of course, cheap and easy to access. The infrastructure is there for people to purchase some whenever, it is not restricted to large institutions and universities who can afford it. People in the first world have been able to use Bitcoin for many years now, but it has not reached even close to wide adoption.   Much of the first world can buy and use Bitcoin very quickly. They just aren't, because they don't care."

At that time, it was primarily email, usenet, ftp sites, and gopher.  It was useful for the people who were using it.  As it became more useful, more people used it.  The idea that bitcoin is like the early internet doesn't make sense.  The biggest problem with it is the idea that eventually, bitcoin will become easy to use, by layering all sorts of other networks on top of it.  Like, having bitcoin banks and bitcoin credit cards that let people use it without the risks and problems that plague bitcoin today.  Of course you could have bitcoin banks and bitcoin credit cards.

Buttcoin,3e0dy4,Wooomp,2,Tue Jul 21 09:55:25 2015 UTC,"Email had, and still has, several enormous differences from Bitcoin which make direct comparison between the two difficult if done honestly.    Email had obvious and advantageous use cases from the start.  Email is scalable.  Even if only two people need to use it on the entire planet, it works and it is still unambiguously useful even for that extremely limited scenario. Email has enjoyed the direct financial, logistical, and technical support of many institutions and governments to help it get traction, because of the above.  Email doesn't require its users to buy in to some ideology about how the world is ""supposed"" to work, or who should be in charge; nor does it require lengthy pondering over the abstract nature of communication in order for someone to fully understand why it is beneficial. It is very hard to find fault with the economic principles it is based on, because it isn't based on any. Email doesn't try to force full decentralization on its userbase in order to be functional. Every single email client doesn't need to know about, track, approve, and store for all eternity the entire transaction history of every other email client. This is probably the biggest single divergence between Bitcoin and Email and why they are fundamentally incomparable scenarios. The same goes for BitTorrent.  Note that many of the proposed fixes for Bitcoin's shortcomings effectively amount to manifestations of the realization that full decentralization is fundamentally impossible at the information theory level. Much backpedaling on that as Bitcoin drifts toward an inevitable patchwork of federated autonomous systems held together with externally secured trust anchors, like DNS, BGP, and everything else 'decentralized' that actually works in practice only by compromising on decentralization. Including Email."

The selling argument of ""Use us because everyone else is crap"" is the very definition of poor marketing.

Criminal activity is not an economic imperative, economies don't exist to services criminals, and fiat does not exist to service criminals.

Bitcoin has great use cases: namely, DNMs. It's never ever ever going to replace fiat or take over the world, but as an experiment it's been wildly successful. The issue is that when you're heavily invested in Bitcoin, you've got no reason to want the next iteration of the experiment to succeed. And I can say this, having been in that position for many years.  People talk about Satoshi like they/he are/is a fucking deity.    Satoshi bailed on Bitcoin 5 years ago.

The cost of maintaining the network is hidden in monetary inflation, the 3600 bitcoins awarded to miners every day for completing blocks.  Imagine if a restaurant was allowed to simply create money and give it to itself every day in exchange for being in business.  So the restaurant gets $5000 per day, and charges each customer 1 cent.  Is this really a cheap efficient restaurant, or is it an expensive restaurant being financed in a ridiculous way?  The bitcoin network cannot scale up, while still remaining decentralized.  It's already something of a joke to call it decentralized now, since its controlled by a small group of chinese miners, developers, mining pool operators and exchanges.  Any attempt to scale it up to VISA size would remove any last vestiges of decentralization, and would send transaction fees high enough that it wouldn't make any sense for anyone to use.

(At least, that's how it looks to my non-expert eyes.  I'm betting right now that Jet dies silently.)"
Buttcoin,3e0kmm,CountOneInterrupt,5,Tue Jul 21 01:58:34 2015 UTC,I first heard of Jet a few weeks ago.  Supposedly on average they are 46% cheaper than Amazon but they charge $50 per year just to buy from them.  So I'm guessing somewhere along the way their prices are subsidized by VC funds.
Buttcoin,3e0kmm,rydan,7,Tue Jul 21 02:38:01 2015 UTC,"Amazon's margins are razor-thin, from what I've heard.  Their distribution apparatus is a work of art, and they've used their near-monopoly to set prices exactly where they want them.  And you're right about VC subsidies.  The WSJ bought about $300 worth of items from Jet and found that Jet took ~$250 in losses.  Amazon can afford to operate at a loss because they're building infrastructure to rule the world; they could become insanely profitable by just flipping a few numbers on their site and killing a few of their divisions that operating at a loss.  Jet's entire business model relies on either being able to buy items massively cheaper than Amazon (not a chance) or having people buy Jet memberships and never use them (aka the suburban gym business model).  Not to mention Amazon's diversification vs. Jet (Amazon Web Services, Prime Video, the Kindle store, Pantry, etc).  I can't imagine what Jet's meant to do, besides take VC money.  They must have some advantage I'm missing, right?  That said, I signed up for 6 free months of Jet membership (there's a box on jet.com where you can enter your email).  I'm gonna take advantage of that sweet, sweet, second-dot-com-bubble VC money until it inevitably runs out.  Edit: Maybe they're trying to get bought out?  Use their VC money being a big enough thorn in Amazon's side that Amazon buys them to be rid of them before Jet goes bankrupt?  But Jet has less than a billion, and Amazon puts down about $90B in sales a year.  I doubt they can do much damage with that.  Plus, Amazon is famously willing to take short-term losses for long-term gains.  I don't know what Jet's deal is."

(The novel Lucifer's Hammer by him and David Niven was one of the very few books that I could not finish reading.  It started with one character arranging his collection of Steuben glass statuettes, then taking a Bayer aspirin, ... and so on, with one placed advertisement every single page.  I stopped reading by chapter 2 or so,  after a half-page digression on the virtues of some GM van.)"

Short summary:  Guy hacks into the UK abortion records for late-term abortions, threatens to publish them, causes the abortion agency to pay a $200K fine, serves time in jail. Has prior convictions for theft and assault. Is out now, and has ""an issue"" with his bank account. Everyone says that the bank in question will debit account and freeze assets when someone is under a fraud investigation.  I suspect that he is under investigation for bank fraud or kiting checks or something similar. If not, perhaps someone hacked into his account as some sort of divine retribution. Either way, the guy is a douchebag, and a walking example of why no one on reddit should ever believe the OP's story. Any OP, any story. It's false and self-serving until proven partly correct."

At one point they were accepting donations in BitCoin, and thanks to the magical blockchain bestowed upon us by the one true god, Satoshi Nakamoto, we know it had 478BTC in it. Supposedly his hacking group was behind a $500,000 heist of one man's 25,000BTC as well. Which I found some evidence of in that during their exit tumble all of a sudden there's a wallet with 18,595BTC in it. Just before his sentencing there was an 800BTC transaction with a LocalBitCoins merchant. Some of trails ended with transaction just last week Thursday.   My thinking is he was their treasurer of sorts, partly cashed out to pay his legal fees, support his partner while in jail, and intended to treat the remainder of LulzSec's coins in the tumbler as a pension. He probably screwed the pooch by exiting in a big way during the Greek pump triggering an automatic lump sum repayment to the BPAS."

He claims that he was arrested for his libertarian views, but the fact is he stored the explosives in his condo without telling his neighbours, and shipped them by mail in unmarked packages. The judge of this case also makes a passing mention to pipe bombs, but there are no details about this. He also ran for the california senate for the libertarian party. He was not elected.  He founded and is still owner of memorydealers.com, a second hand computer part resseller. I suppose that's how he got rich. He later became bitcoin ""rich"" by investing early. He bacame a ""bitcoin jesus"" by investing in early bitcoin business like blockchain.info, bitpay and ripple.  After leaving prision, he left the US and went to tokyo. He's lived in japan ever since. He renounced his US citzenship and bought a St. Kitts and Nevis citzenship, through their “Citizenship-by-investment” program. He later tried to sell St. Kitts and Nevis passports for bitcoin, but this idea was quickly squashed by the St. Kitts government.  He also tried to return to the US to attend a bitcoin conference, but was denied entry because he is an ex-convict who renounced his citzenship to avoid paying taxes, and have no permanent residence in the country who issued his passport (he is a St. Kitts and Nevis citizen, but still lives in tokyo).   He still attended the converence by telepresence, using a device which is basically a iPad attached to a segway. This incarnation of him was dubbed ""Ver-on-a-stick"", and it looks as stupid as it sounds.  Finally, as others already mentioned, he vouched for the solvency of MtGox shortly before the collapse in that famous video.

Edit: here's the transcript from Ver's sentencing.

After leaving prision and serving his probation, he moved to tokyo.   After my release from Lompoc Federal Penitentiary I had to deal with three years of lies, insults, threats, and general harassment by the US Federal probation department.

Hold it until Satoshi arrives on his space ship and whisks all bitcoin holders to his interstellar comet located trillions of miles away in-between the milky way and a nearby galaxy.  You see, as I'm sure you know, the days of fiat are coming to an end.  Satoshi predicted this years ago and decided to create an entirely new world.  One where truly free men could roam the planet free from jack booted thugs forcing them to fund dirty agencies like PBS or NOAA using violent taxation theft.    So outraged was Satoshi, that he knew there had to be a better currency and store of value.  Over many days and nights, Satoshi sat alone at his desk and penned one of the greatest white papers ever conceived of by man.  Known simply as ""Satoshi's White Paper"", this 7 page document outlines the future of money.  It was obvious that this paper was so powerful and important that the worlds greatest governments would seek him out and destroy him.  Satoshi had no choice but to begin construction of the interstellar comet.  The good news is Satoshi will be back any time now.  When he is nearby, you will hear nearby Bitcoin ATM's sounding their alarms letting you know it is time for departure.  Pack your bags, get on his Space Ship, pop a few unregulated free market pharmaceuticals to relax, and enjoy hyperspace.  Soon you will be on Satoshi's Interstellar Comet.  Once there, get on your new sports bike, throw the helmet onto the ground in disgust, and drive as fast as a free man can.  There is no nanny state telling you how fast you can drive, it is up to your rational self interest to decide!  Here is 1 satoshi /u/changetip.  It will be your boarding pass.

Reagent tests aren't research.  They are qualitative tests to check for the presence or absence of a substance within a sample.  They are very non-specific and have low sensitivity.  Degradation isn't a research method I've ever heard of either.  I assume he may mean denaturing? Also not a drug research method.  I saved cell cultures for last because it's just too stupid.  He's saying he wants to culture CELLS from a DRUG sample.  Either he believes in abiogenesis or he's just an idiot (C'mon, guess!).

Buttcoin,3dq929,spookthesunset,10,Sat Jul 18 14:59:59 2015 UTC,"On Satoshi's Interstellar Comet, where bitcoin reigns supreme, virtually all unregulated free market sexy pizza requires at least 3 blockchain confirmations before delivery to the customer.  These sexy pizza delivery personnel are able to whisk the pizza to your doorstep much faster than on earth thanks to unregulated free market drones.  In fact, on Satoshi's comet, the sexy pizza business is so hot right now that many rival delivery companies have weapons on their drones to shoot their competition out of the sky.  Many free men on the land protect their property from falling drones by installing a ring of surface to air missiles ready to vaporize anything that flies overhead.  Passage through these private territories is typically granted using blockchain-based smart contracts. Delivery companies simply go to each property individually to work out a deal with the owners.    Some free market enterprises feel going around to every property to negotiate a deal is too much work and simply take the risk of one of their drones being shot down.   These innovative business owners often send out several drones per order and assume most wont make it to their customer.  Some have even installed sophisticated equipment designed to seek out and destroy these surface-to-air missile launchers.  After all, there are no jack booted thugs with guns denying ones ability to protect their drones from attack.  As any truly free man will tell you, it all boils down to rational self-interest.  If your sexy pizza delivery vendor doesn't take the appropriate measures to ensure you get your pizza in under the 20 minute limit agreed upon in the smart contract and goes bankrupt as a result, it is really their fault.  I should mention that there are several scam sexy pizza delivery businesses.  These delivery businesses promise big pizzas with large amounts of sexyness, but fail to deliver.  You can mitigate this somewhat by using one of the many unregulated free market escrow services before placing your order.  These escrow services will hold your bitcoin until your sexy pizza arrives and then release the funds to the vendor.  Personally I find these services to be a waste of time.  I personally recommend you simply go down to the vendor and shake hands with the owner.  Inspect their manufacturing processes and learn about their suppliers ands assembly methods.  Then and only then can you really be assured that your sexy pizza will be legitimate and meet your personal health standards.    This is the glorious free market at work and it is only on Satoshi's Interstellar Comet.  So come, free yourself from the shackles of the oppressive system we live in here on earth.  Here is 1 satoshi /u/changetip.  Hold it and when Satoshi arrives, all the bitcoin ATM's in your area will sound and alarm signaling it is time to pack your bags.  Meet your fellow bitcoin holders at the closest ATM and Satoshi will arrive shortly on his giant space ship.  You will simply have your bitcoin wallet ready, walk up the ramp and depart for a better life.  Satoshi Speed my good friend!"

Current confession methods are old and obsolete and prone to a number of problems.  There is the danger of the priest leaking one's sins out to the world, and the problem of unfair penances being given.  Can you trust a priest to give you the proper penance for your sins and keep them a secret?  Of course not.  But you can trust the blockchain.  The Church's blockchain software will allow members to digitally encode their sins and transmit them to the blockchain, anonymously, where the software protocol will objectively and automatically assign the proper penance for each sin.  And since all of the sins will be listed in one place, it will (presumably) make it easier and more efficient for the Lord our Savior to grant forgiveness to all of the sinners of the day.  Other possible uses for the catholic blockchain include the recording of weddings, baptisms, excommunication, and exorcisms."

Under Sulla’s reign of terror, Crassus benefited by purchasing the property of proscribed citizens at cutthroat prices. Even worse, in the eyes of his fellow citizens, was his habit of buying burning homes. Rome had no fire department at the time, and Crassus maintained a personal firefighting force that would rush to the site of a burning building along with Crassus himself. Once there, Crassus would bargain for the fiery structure, as well as for the buildings surrounding it. Once he had made as many deals as he deemed profitable, his army went to work extinguishing the flames."

Seattle police say girls are advertised by their pimps on Backpage.com, a website owned by Village Voice Media Holdings.  Village Voice Media Holdings announced Monday that it has sold the print publications to a new holding company based in Denver, Voice Media Group. The sale did not include Backpage.com, which will continue to operate on its own. Seattle Weekly won’t refer its readers to Backpage.com.  The new owners said readers won’t notice big changes in the Weekly’s editorial content.  “We have a really great team in Seattle,” said Scott Tobias, CEO of Voice Media Group.  He declined to answer questions about the sex ads, other than to offer a one-sentence statement from a publicist that seemed contrary to what Stocker said:  “There will be no online adult classifieds in Seattle or in any market. Our print products will continue to operate with their current offerings,” it reads.  However, Stocker said the Weekly is different from the other print publications. He made a request to the new owners to stop accepting escort ads, and “they granted my request. Why they are not doing it elsewhere, I can’t speak to that,” he said.  Seattle Weekly will continue to advertise other adult businesses, including massage parlors and phone sex.  The escort ads were problematic because they could be placed online by pimps, without any proof that the women or girls depicted were adults. (The Weekly did require ID for escort ads placed in the print edition.) The escorts often were coerced into prostitution, according to police. By contrast, The Stranger, which runs escort ads on naughtynw.com, requires proof of age and identity.   So essentially Backpages is legit and sex-negative sleaze, a perfect match for Bitcoin."

There isn't a trusted authority for software hashes like there is for ssl certs, because the quantity of software is absurdly greater.

Buttcoin,3dmth9,zom-ponks,3,Fri Jul 17 17:05:15 2015 UTC,"There are PGP keyservers suited for fetching keys, but I don't think those are suited for your average user. Maybe it could be extended, but who knows.  And you could use openssl (or variants) to sign the software, and then use whatever CAs you deem trustworthy to verify the signature chains. And considering some odd CA certs in modern browsers, this probably would not satisfy the tinfoil-hat crowd.  Linux distros get away with hashing all of their software repositories, not to mention using their own signing keys. And Microsoft have their own PKI for verifying software. Not sure about OSX but their app store certainly has something similar.  So in a sense, it's a solved problem, but no-one has pulled it together previously to make something automated, (reasonably) trustworthy and easy to use. At least not to my knowledge."
Buttcoin,3dmth9,tebee,4,Fri Jul 17 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"All of those solutions end up being either impractically complex, or solve the problem by not covering everything, though. If you want a cutting edge version of some software, you're probably not going to be installing it from your repo, you're building it from source. Curated app stores are a trusted authority, but are pretty firmly incompatible with general purpose computing."

Again, not saying it's an optimal (or large-scale) solution, unless they introduce something absurd like e-mail verification for uploading your keys.

Buttcoin,3dmth9,this_user,3,Fri Jul 17 18:52:45 2015 UTC,"The funny thing about WoT is, the fraudulent key to the journalist's email address was actually signed by his employer, a big tech news publisher. That is, until you actually checked the signature and found out that the publisher's key had also been forged.   But yeah, if your own WoT does extend to your target there may be some assurance of authenticity, but the current system is in no way set up to facilitate contact or check signatures of random strangers.

Buttcoin,3dmth9,moolikeacow,7,Fri Jul 17 21:42:57 2015 UTC,"Linux distros will usually check the signatures of packages you install via their package manager. But this leads to the problem of making sure you you only accept signatures made with keys you can trust or keys that have been signed by a trustworthy key. For a Linux distribution that is doable, although still not perfect since keys could be compromised.  Doing it for the whole Internet is not that easy. Many open source projects will sign their builds and git allows you to sign commits and tags with your key. But this stills leaves you with the problem of obtaining the valid keys to check against. An attacker could easily make a copy of the real website, upload a malicious version of the software including a signature with the attacker's key. Unless you already have the real developer's key, you are unlikely to notice the difference.  Securely distributing developer keys on an Internet-wide scale is not really feasible with today's methods. The mess with SSL certificates is proof of that. Theoretically there should be a a number of trustworthy certificate authorities which in turn sign the individual certificates. The problem is that not all of these CAs adhere to the appropriate standards when signing certificates. Some are corrupt or under the influence by external entities. Some have had their infrastructure compromised in the past and been used to forge certificates and mount attacks. At the end of the day, it comes down to knowing whom you can trust. But in any reasonably complex system, this is a non-trivial problem since you will always have to rely on other trustworthy parties to build a web of trust. If only one of these parties is compromised, you have problem."
Buttcoin,3dmth9,sakkara,5,Fri Jul 17 17:28:27 2015 UTC,"That's what SSL is for.  And yeah, browsers do check SSL certificates.  But you still have the same problem - if making SSL certificates will be easy, every scammer will do his own one anyway, just like he is doing his own scammy website.  And, on the other hand, if you will somehow tie certificates with real life identities and will require rigorous checking, it will be a PITA for the developers to use (more than https is now).  PGP has the same problem with the keyservers - how do you know which key is genuine, etc etc."

His example was actually burying bottles full of banknotes and allowing private industry to dig them up, thus creating a demand for labor:   If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes, bury them at suitable depths in disused coalmines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish, and leave it to private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the notes up again (the right to do so being obtained, of course, by tendering for leases of the note-bearing territory), there need be no more unemployment and, with the help of the repercussions, the real income of the community, and its capital wealth also, would probably become a good deal greater than it actually is. It would, indeed, be more sensible to build houses and the like; but if there are political and practical difficulties in the way of this, the above would be better than nothing.   In both cases they are taking a complex point and distilling it down to their essentials so stupid people like you can understand them.

That government gets money like manna from heaven and can distribute it to revive the economy? Even a 5-year old would ask here ""but where does the government get the money for that?"". Gee, it takes it from taxes, borrowing and inflation - i.e., from its own citizens. So, even if the government was 100% prescient and competent and everything (which it is not by a long shot), the best it can do is return to the economy the capital it has taken from it. In other words, the best you can hope for is that the economy will not get any worse.  Of course, the practice is somewhat different. The government lacks the profit motive and always has a problem solving the economic calculation problem, resulting in redistribution of capital to the wrong targets, i.e., in malinvestments which only serve to make the economy worse.

That suggestion is quite on par with Keynes' suggestions to pay workers to dig holes in the ground for no good reason.

Buttcoin,3dl6h0,anti09,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:31:00 2015 UTC,"Because he said so   Long-time readers know that I once joked that what we needed in America was a fake threat from space aliens, which would jolt us into action on stimulus; if the aliens were later revealed as a hoax, no matter.   And we can also dig up the quote and observe that the phrasing is using a hypothetical example.  I found http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/15/paul-krugman-fake-alien-invasion_n_926995.html   ""If we discovered that, you know, space aliens were planning to attack and we needed a massive buildup to counter the space alien threat and really inflation and budget deficits took secondary place to that, this slump would be over in 18 months,"" he said. ""And then if we discovered, oops, we made a mistake, there aren't any aliens, we'd be better--""   That's clearly just a thought experience with some levity injected, and I'm not sure how you can think otherwise.   It is Bastiat's broken window fallacy all over - which Krugmen has stated - quite seriously - that he thinks is no longer a fallacy.   Here's his position:   As some of us keep trying to point out, the United States is in a liquidity trap: private spending is inadequate to achieve full employment, and with short-term interest rates close to zero, conventional monetary policy is exhausted.  This puts us in a world of topsy-turvy, in which many of the usual rules of economics cease to hold. Thrift leads to lower investment; wage cuts reduce employment; even higher productivity can be a bad thing. And the broken windows fallacy ceases to be a fallacy: something that forces firms to replace capital, even if that something seemingly makes them poorer, can stimulate spending and raise employment.   Krugman said that broken-window style spending is helpful in the face of a liquidity trap, not that the broken window fallacy is over in general.  You got too stuck on ""And the broken windows fallacy ceases to be a fallacy,"" but in the context in which he says that its clear that he doesn't think its untrue in all cases.  And he isn't arguing that capital destruction will create value in the immediate term; the argument here is that it has knock-on effects that can generate desired outcomes.  Raising employment does not necessarily add value to the economy in and of itself, for example, but his thoughts are that this will cause a situation that could lead to recovery later.  Reasonable people can disagree with it, but being unnecessarily reductive is not a good form of disagreement.  One would want to address the specific points and conditions he outlined here rather than simply claiming he is an idiot because he doesn't think a particular ""rule"" applies in this situation."

Krugman said that broken-window style spending is helpful in the face of a liquidity trap   And he is still wrong. The ""liquidity trap"" is bullshit, too. What we have is a solvency problem - credit has been expanding wildly for way too long and now the tide has turned and the bad bets are collapsing - this is what is putting deflationary pressure on the economy - not some imaginary ""savings glut"", ""liquidity trap"" or any other nonsense like that.   And he isn't arguing that capital destruction will create value in the immediate term; the argument here is that it has knock-on effects that can generate desired outcomes.   And he is still wrong, being blind to what Bastiat describes as ""the unseen"". In other words, he is a ""bad economist"" in Basitat's terms.   Raising employment does not necessarily add value to the economy in and of itself, for example, but his thoughts are that this will cause a situation that could lead to recovery later.   No, it won't. It will just further destroy capital and cause an even bigger bust down the line. All artificial interventions in the economy and the free market inevitably do.   Reasonable people can disagree with it, but being unnecessarily reductive is not a good form of disagreement.    Making outlandish claims is not a good form of argument, either, so he only gets what he deserves.

Buttcoin,3dl6h0,somegurk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:57:26 2015 UTC,They don't just attack him   Of course they don't. The vast majority of them fundamentally do not understand what he's talking about and certainly couldn't tell you for what work he actually won his Nobel.
Buttcoin,3dl6h0,TokyoSexwhale_,14,Fri Jul 17 18:35:15 2015 UTC,"It was over a thousand bucks a Bitcoin a year and a half ago and now it's around 300 bucks. And sure that sounds like a huge decline until you remember that three years ago bitcoins were trading for around 5 bucks a piece   Well...yeah. Good job reinforcing his point about it being a bubble, I guess?   But what makes Bitcoin so revolutionary is the fact that it's the first form of money that is both digital AND decentralized,   The absurdity of paper wallets and increasingly centralised miners and exchange services (without which the bitcoin economy would in all likelihood barely function) come to mind, but do go on.   the first form of money that allows trustless value transfer and storage,   I don't get why that's really a good thing. But then again I'm no expert.   the first form of money to combine the reliable scarcity of a commodity like gold   While demonstrating what a bad idea that is.   with the transactional efficiency of a purely-digital medium.   Something it continues to fail spectacularly at.  Well I don't know about anyone else, but I'm sold."
Buttcoin,3dl6h0,Monkeyavelli,8,Fri Jul 17 09:15:00 2015 UTC,"Well...yeah. Good job reinforcing his point about it being a bubble, I guess?   That's the hilarious part. The whole thesis Krugman makes is Bitcoin is a bubble. The price history that the Bitcoiners never fail to remind you about is all about a price bubble starting at $0 and going to $1200, then back to $160 in a year. And they're certain it'll go to $10k any day. Yet they disagree with Krugman because he's just an old school economist who doesn't understand Bitcoin. Well, there's no disagreement on the bubble part.   And he's right when he says you can't pay taxes with Bitcoin. I'm getting downvoted to oblivion for pointing out that the IRS will take money even from drug dealer: no matter the income, you declare it, and the IRS accepts it. Tangentially, I can't think of a worse way to dodge taxes than a public ledger"
Buttcoin,3dl6h0,PixMasterz,5,Fri Jul 17 10:55:59 2015 UTC,Bitcoin isn't a bubble tho its price rise is bc fundamentals
Buttcoin,3dl6h0,SnapshillBot,3,Fri Jul 17 12:50:43 2015 UTC,I can't think of a worse way to dodge taxes than a public ledger   With bitcoin you can buy drugs! Pay hookers! Dodge taxes! All on a permanent public ledger! Because people are literally that f'n stupid.

Buttcoin,3dl6h0,tatertatertatertot,3,Fri Jul 17 13:50:52 2015 UTC,But then again I'm no expert.   Hmm it doesn't stop butters talking about it so I wouldn't let that scare you off.
Buttcoin,3dl6h0,btc_rofl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:15:48 2015 UTC,Digital.   Decentralised.   Trustless.   Store of value.   Reliable.   Transactional efficiency.
Buttcoin,3dl6h0,Barry_Scotts_Cat,9,Fri Jul 17 10:25:20 2015 UTC,Trustless.    Define trustless    not worthy of trust; faithless; unreliable; false: He was trustless when money was involved. Distrustful; suspicious: a doorman trustless of all strangers.
