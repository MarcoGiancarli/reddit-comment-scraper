dadjokes,3dqbyk,Rhomagus,3,Sun Jul 19 00:04:22 2015 UTC,In my experience that's only common for elevations. In which case it makes sense as it's usually less than a mile and using miles would be imprecise and require a few decimals. Using meters is still better though imo!

dadjokes,3dhv4g,veryfascinating,253,Thu Jul 16 15:59:55 2015 UTC,Why would a kid go through 6th grade to go into 1st grade?
dadjokes,3dhv4g,PrinceOfTheHamsters,248,Thu Jul 16 14:16:33 2015 UTC,OP meant the summer school teaches kids in grades 1-6. It's not as complicated as others are making it out to be. Just poorly worded. You could say his mistake was quite... Elementary.

dadjokes,3dhv4g,absurdperson,26,Fri Jul 17 08:12:52 2015 UTC,"Where I am in the UK, you enter education aged 4 in a level called 'primary one' (P1). Then you move up to P2, P3, P4 etc. until P7 (aged 10/11). Then you move from your primary school to your secondary school and enter 'form one' or 'year one' aged 12. Secondary school runs from year one to year seven.   OP is probably just in a different part of the UK (or just somewhere else in the world) and is talking about the transition from primary school to secondary school, where the students are moving from grade 6 (highest grade in little school) to grade 1 (lowest grade in big school).  edit: well then."
dadjokes,3dhv4g,cjgerik,17,Thu Jul 16 16:54:18 2015 UTC,"No haha, I'm pretty sure they just meant 1st - 6th grades.    A better way to reword it would probably be:    ""... a summer program for kids that are entering grades 1 through 6"""

dadjokes,3dhv4g,LordStormfire,3,Thu Jul 16 19:42:16 2015 UTC,"I think the confusion stems from the fact that in British English we say ""grades 1 to 6"" not ""grades 1 through 6""."

dadjokes,3dhv4g,5_YEAR_LURKER,2,Thu Jul 16 16:18:43 2015 UTC,"What? Where are you getting that from?  In the UK it starts with reception, then goes from years 1 to 11, ages 4 to 16. Reception to year 6 are primary school. Year 7 to year 11, also known somewhat archaically as first to fifth form, are secondary school. Years 10 and 11 form 2 year GCSE courses. Afterwards you can either leave school and do an apprenticeship or something along those lines, or continue into 6 form or college for another 2 years of A levels.  It's nothing to do with the navy, and there's certainly no counting backwards."
dadjokes,3dhv4g,inksmithy,2,Thu Jul 16 17:56:45 2015 UTC,"Unless you are in a tier three system, in which case first school has reception then year 1, 2, 3 and 4. Then middle school has years 5, 6, 7 and 8. High school has years 9, 10 and 11 then 6th form is year 12 and 13.  Not....confusing....at......all......"
