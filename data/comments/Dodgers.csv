I use "" "" because from my experience, the ""hate"" just coincides with baseball and fun sportsmanship.   Giants fans (in my experience) are #1) San Francisco Snobs #2) Dodger Haters #3) Giants fans. (Again, just my experience) The overwhelming majority of Giants ""fans"" I've interacted with use the Giants as a proxy to exemplify how their city/culture/politics/everything is so far superior than everywhere else in the US and ESPECIALLY Los Angeles.   So if the Giants are doing well, well of course, because SF is the best and LA can suck a dick. Their fandom is foundationally based on their snobbery and hatred of all things NOT San Francisco which the Giants build upon  Versus   The average Dodger fan: ""Boo Giants!

Dodgers,3e2zuf,DodgerDoan,4,Tue Jul 21 17:04:50 2015 UTC,Should we have a PSA explaining that Guerrero has almost zero trade value? People don't seem to understand that if he gets traded he can opt out of his contract at the end of the season and become a FA. That kinda nullifies his value.
Dodgers,3e2zuf,PrussianBleu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:21 2015 UTC,"yup, which is why I think Turner is more valuable in a trade. I want this team to win a championship as much as any other Dodger fan, but I really don't want to blow up the team. However, if we can get Price, Cueto, Hamels, M Night Samardzija or whomever, then we should do it as long as we don't give up our key players."
Dodgers,3e2zuf,DodgerDoan,2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:55 2015 UTC,Hate to break it to you but Turner is a top 3 player on this team and nothing indicates that it is a fluke at this point. He has to stay.  Cueto is a half year rental and might not make sense of we have to give someone up who is significant. It's going to be hard to get something done that everyone is happy with.

Dodgers,3e2zuf,Bawfuls,3,Tue Jul 21 19:34:03 2015 UTC,"No, for the 1000th time, Guerrero has minimal trade value because he's a free agent this winter if he gets traded, and he can't play defense."
Dodgers,3e2zuf,PrussianBleu,2,Tue Jul 21 17:39:45 2015 UTC,"exactly, which is why I think Turner is more likely to be traded"
Dodgers,3e2zuf,Bawfuls,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:49 2015 UTC,"Turner is currently the starting 3B, plays well on both sides of the ball, and is cheap. They don't have a replacement for him (the team clearly doesn't see Guerrero as an option at 3B, he hasn't played there since May 24th). Olivera is still too much of an unknown to just hand him the starting 3B role heading into August.  I don't see any reason they'd trade Turner right now."

He didn't know the difference and they were too poor to buy him a righty glove so he taught himself to pitch left handed. He's naturally right handed so I'd imagine he can still throw pretty well with his right hand just not actually pitch with it.   That or the image is mirrored.

Dodgers,3e0tlf,NSFAnythingAtAll,4,Tue Jul 21 02:30:29 2015 UTC,he would've stayed at 1st and not even tried for 2nd and then that 2nd run wouldn't have tried to score if puig hadn't thrown it home.

I think he is still feeling his way around being emotionally ready to pitch big league games.  This was also his first game back at Turner Field, where he was for his whole career before getting injured. That may have contributed to the poor showing today as well."
Dodgers,3e0tlf,YocPuigerson,3,Tue Jul 21 05:55:50 2015 UTC,Bison with the 2-run bomb against the Giants!
Dodgers,3e0tlf,NSFAnythingAtAll,4,Tue Jul 21 03:07:08 2015 UTC,"Noticing a lot of unwarranted hate for the bullpen over the game chat. The Dodger's bullpen has been solid all year but casual fans seem to think the BP is terrible or lacking. We have a top 5 bullpen in the major leagues with a bunch of rookies forming the bulk of the bullpen. Do you guys really expect 7 Kenley Jansens in our bullpen? Dodger fans might be the most spoiled fanbase in regards to the bullpen over the past years due to the great bullpens we've had during the Honeycutt era. If you want to see a bad bullpen look at the Ranger's BP, Fangraphs ranks them at 31 (putting them behind the free agents who have been cut or dont have a team, lol).   Relievers are the most scrutinized players in baseball IMO, you have a game like this one and people think its the worst thing they've ever seen, but they see good performances and think nothing of it."
Dodgers,3e0tlf,YocPuigerson,8,Tue Jul 21 02:27:57 2015 UTC,I don't think it's unreasonable to expect your bullpen to not give up three runs in five innings. Especially to guys like Eury Perez and Jace Peterson.
Dodgers,3e0tlf,NSFAnythingAtAll,0,Tue Jul 21 02:34:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's unreasonable to expect your starter to go at least 5+ innings and not give up 4 rungs, especially giving up home runs to guys like Nick Markakis who hasn't hit a home run in 300+ AB before this game."
Dodgers,3e0tlf,YocPuigerson,6,Tue Jul 21 02:40:12 2015 UTC,"Normally I'd agree with you on that, except this is a guy making his second start after being out over a year following his second Tommy John surgery. Hard to expect quality this soon, if at all, from Beachy."
Dodgers,3e0tlf,Im_Daydrunk,0,Tue Jul 21 02:42:59 2015 UTC,"All I'm saying today's game was a collective disappointment by the whole pitching staff, and there will be more in the future. But to this day the bullpen has been a lot better than what people think."
Dodgers,3e0tlf,Im_Daydrunk,2,Tue Jul 21 03:13:32 2015 UTC,"But the bullpens job is to limit damage caused by a bad outing and give the team a chance to come back and win. They absolutely failed on that today, which is why a reliever was credited with the loss."
Dodgers,3e0tlf,YocPuigerson,4,Tue Jul 21 02:43:19 2015 UTC,They arent top 5 by any measure this season. Our bullpen is 19th in ERA this season which is a joke for a serious contender. They are the main reason why we aren't running away with the division.
Dodgers,3e0tlf,mevans93308,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:38:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe top 5 was a reach on my point, but they are definitely solid. Using ERA to measure pitching, especially with relievers who have lower sample sizes, is not a good stat to look at. I think the Yankees have the best BP in the league but their ERA is only 11th best. We have the third lowest FIP, second highest WAR and first in K/9."
Dodgers,3e0tlf,snarkprovider,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:01:24 2015 UTC,"The bullpen has definitely regressed a bit, but that was to be expected after how hot they started the year."

Dodgers,3e0tlf,aurabolt213,3,Tue Jul 21 04:28:51 2015 UTC,"I didn't make up anything, maybe you should research what these stats are and see how these are related to our bullpen."

Dodgers,3e0tlf,kcxiv,2,Tue Jul 21 05:49:31 2015 UTC,"The whole ""our bullpen has great stats"" thing is because they were lights out the first five or so weeks of the season. It's been all downhill bullpen wise. It's completely unacceptable to give up 7 fucking runs to the Atlanta Braves, and when three of those runs come off the bullpen right when we start trying to come back, it puts the game out of reach. Outside of Jansen and Howell, there isn't one person I trust in that pen."

Dodgers,3e3i2t,soundoftherain,8,Tue Jul 21 17:54:31 2015 UTC,"Cueto will be a lot cheaper as a rental player.  Also, correct me if I'm wrong but I got the impression from The Best Team Money Can Buy that the new ownership plans to limit spending fairly soon.  If thats the case taking on a contract like Hamels' might affect our ability to pay Greinke what he wants in free-agency."
Dodgers,3e3i2t,raider02,10,Tue Jul 21 18:02:42 2015 UTC,"Hamels is the cheaper long-term play because it allows the team to let Grienke walk. If the team is looking to cut salary, the best place to do that is to not give a long-term deal to a 30+ year old ace coming off a Cy Young year.  Grienke is going to be outrageously expensive. Hamels is cost controlled for several more years. If you trade for Hamels now, you get a 3rd ""ace"" in the short-term, and don't have your back against the wall when Grienke opts out."
Dodgers,3e3i2t,amarstan,5,Tue Jul 21 19:13:56 2015 UTC,Hamels hasnt been pitching well at all idk why the dodgers want to pursue him??? Get cueto hes much better and is necessary if the dodgers want to make a run this season. I understand cuetos contract is about to end but isnt this a win now team??

If getting Cueto means a higher likelihood of getting grienke back, then I pick Cueto."
Dodgers,3e3i2t,FBAguy13,3,Tue Jul 21 19:02:17 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, it seems like the Dodgers are the front-runners to resign Greinke even when he opts out. It seems like he has a great relationship with Stan Kasten and the front office, especially since he was with them during the draft. To me, it seems like he would want to stay, if the price is right.  The only thing I'm worried about is whether or not Friedman is willing to take a chance on an older arm.."
Dodgers,3e3i2t,turningxpoint91,2,Tue Jul 21 19:15:00 2015 UTC,What about David Price?
Dodgers,3e3i2t,Tonedog14,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:17 2015 UTC,I didn't list Price because we weren't specifically called out as an interested party.
Dodgers,3e3i2t,amarstan,7,Tue Jul 21 18:42:52 2015 UTC,Buster Olney was talking about it today. Seems that we're in the mix because Friedman and Price have a close personal relationship.  Friedman took Price #1 overall and tried to desperately keep him in Tampa as long as possible. They like each other and losing Price may have been the final straw that sent Friedman packing.  So it may be a solution since he's a cheaper trade than Hamels and will be younger than Grienke this off season.
Dodgers,3e3i2t,BeefCat10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:11 2015 UTC,Hamels because of the contracts
Dodgers,3e3i2t,ToastedFireBomb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:59 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer to grab Either Cueto or Kazmir and resign Greinke, but that may not be an option. Although resigning Greinke might not be as far-fetched as everyone believes, it's still not a guarantee. Cueto would be a better pitcher than Hamels and is younger, he would just be gone after this season."
Dodgers,3e3i2t,bryanplayspiano,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:38:56 2015 UTC,"The only pickup I could see while resigning Greinke would be Kazmir or Chavez from Oakland. Greinke is a must though, definitely."

Dodgers,3dzib1,nenright,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:54:41 2015 UTC,His highest avg is on the first pitch though so it'll usually work out for him. He's not betting 1.000 so I won't be very first pitch
Dodgers,3dzib1,Zackadeez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:54:02 2015 UTC,I'm fine with trying to hit the first pitch but he chased that ball almost to the fucking ground. Sometimes he just seems to want to do too much. Someone needs to get him to relax up there when there are runners in scoring position

Dodgers,3dzib1,alecardvarksax,0,Tue Jul 21 01:32:38 2015 UTC,"Who exactly are ""the worst arms?"" Because from where I'm sitting, literally the only quality reliver is Kenley. Literally everyone else is somewhere between ""absolute train wreck"" to ""kind of ok""."

Dodgers,3e3nzw,DonMakaveli,15,Tue Jul 21 18:39:34 2015 UTC,"Puig at his best is miles better than Ethier/Guerrero/Kike/SVS in terms of value. It's also worth noting that Puig isn't even 25 yet and already an excellent defensive player in RF (maybe not the most consistent fielder, but that arm is untouchable). Giving him and his excellent contract up for an aging Hamels with an albatross of a contract is just foolish, IMO."

Dodgers,3e3nzw,DCsportsJohnny,4,Tue Jul 21 19:15:24 2015 UTC,"That's not our decision to make. I trust Andrew and Farhan to do whatever they think is best for this team; we'll see what they do prior to the deadline. As Giobenavides above me pointed out, trading for Hamels does not guarantee a WS win or even appearance. What if he doesn't get it done for us this season? Would it be worth it to sacrifice 3 young to prime years (25-27) of Puig at $6MM/year (He's signed until 2018 with arbitration for 2019) for Hamels at age 32-34* at $23.5MM/year? I don't think so, but that's just my opinion.   *Hamels' last year (2019 - Age 35 season) is a team option for $20MM"

Even if we wanted to trade Puig, which we absolutely do not, Why wouldn't we get as much as we possibly could? First of all, Cueto and/or Kazmir > Hamels. Hamels is an aging pitcher who's good, but has a huge expensive contract. He's not worth a 25 year old 5-tool player. Makes literally no sense. If we are gonna trade Puig, we are gonna get a hell of a lot more than just a decent 31 year old pitcher."

Dodgers,3e3nzw,iamoneson,4,Tue Jul 21 18:44:06 2015 UTC,Because they would get a much better player back who is getting payed less money.  They could then use that savings to sign a free agent.

Dodgers,3dysng,DodgerDoan,2,Mon Jul 20 20:40:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, a positive DWAR generally indicates above average defensive performance while a negative DWAR generally indicates below average defensive performance. But advanced defensive statistics vary wildly from year to year. The best indicator of defensive performance is a 2-3 year average of DWAR.   Try to avoid relying on your eyes alone to evaluate defensive performance. Derek Jeter, for example, often made solid plays on balls he could reach. But he had terrible range and it was hard to discern range using the eye test alone."
Dodgers,3dysng,Jew_Tang-Clan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:29:28 2015 UTC,"Derek Jeter syndrome. It's probably a range issue.   Midseason stats are difficult to prove things with, but that doesn't mean they aren't a sign of the truth. He doesn't make errors, so it's gotta be a range issue. This could correct itself in the second half, it could be the result of some extreme shifting, or it could be that he's not getting there.   I wouldn't worry about it though too much. The dude is raking offensively, and he's a one-year solution at the position. Long-Term we still have defense lined up there."

Dodgers,3dvcx7,minimalist_reply,3,Sun Jul 19 21:39:46 2015 UTC,Yep I agree with you. I don't see any reason to trade him. He is a good player.   I just don't care for his personality.
Dodgers,3dvcx7,Clash21,3,Sun Jul 19 23:32:56 2015 UTC,I love that he has A personality. Too many boring players on the field these days. And I don't really see (at least publicly) how Puigs personality ruins anything. He's not mouthing off useless jabs like a certain bum on our rival team...

Dodgers,3dw8y6,etwardjetward,36,Mon Jul 20 01:33:17 2015 UTC,I would rather see him get 50 post season strikeouts.
Dodgers,3dw8y6,Len_Zefflin,4,Mon Jul 20 02:05:10 2015 UTC,Thisssssssss. I loved watching him go 8 shut out innings basically every start last season. I did not love watching him burn out
Dodgers,3dw8y6,ChocolateBaseball,9,Mon Jul 20 07:15:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, he realistically could get to 300 Ks this year. He's been on pace all season long for at least 285, and that pace has gotten greater as the season has gone along. He's been better in the second half than the first half the last couple years, so he absolutely has a very good chance at it. I think we could see him end somewhere between 310-320."
Dodgers,3dw8y6,NSFAnythingAtAll,5,Mon Jul 20 02:10:27 2015 UTC,"If he averages 9 strikeouts a game for the rest of the regular season he'll hit exactly 300.    Strikeouts per game last 10 starts: 14, 13, 7, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11, 7, 10.    I think he's going to do it. He's had a lot of success after the all-star break and what really matters is just innings pitched for him. If he can continue to go 7+ for the rest of the year without a bad start, he can do it.    I just hope he gets plenty of rest / doesn't push himself too hard before the regular season is over. I'm confident we'll make the playoffs and want Kershaw to be fresh and ready to go vs whoever we play."
Dodgers,3dw8y6,GlassesOff,4,Mon Jul 20 03:00:22 2015 UTC,"I think so, I think if he missed that mark it wouldn't be by much probably in the 280-290s"
Dodgers,3dw8y6,Viperking5,3,Mon Jul 20 01:47:30 2015 UTC,"I just want to see him win the next 14 starts and finish the season with 21 wins.  I know it's unrealistic, but it would be awesome."
Dodgers,3dw8y6,phuckduck,2,Mon Jul 20 06:52:04 2015 UTC,"Great analysis.  AT this point, I just hope he's an ace in the playoffs.  If he and Greinke are both on, we have an amazing chance to at least make the NLCS this year.  If we get a dominant #3, then we're really in business"
Dodgers,3dw8y6,collegemathchef,2,Mon Jul 20 04:15:04 2015 UTC,"Schilling also got to 300 K in 2002 (316 in 259.1 IP, 11.0 K/9)"
Dodgers,3dw8y6,Bawfuls,2,Mon Jul 20 04:52:22 2015 UTC,"If it happens, I'm thanking Grant Brisbee for writing this article back in February   Clayton Kershaw is about the best in the world at what he does. He was worked as hard as any other ace in baseball, and he was awesome enough last season to win the MVP. He still didn't come close to the innings pitched or strikeouts-per-nine marks we need for 300 strikeouts. He'd need to increase the strikeouts dramatically or throw dozens more innings in a season. Neither one is particularly likely, even for a wizard like Kershaw."
Dodgers,3dw8y6,Bawfuls,2,Mon Jul 20 04:57:20 2015 UTC,Year Pitcher Cy Young?    2002 Randy Johnson Yes   1999 Pedro Martinez Yes   1997 Pedro Martinez Yes   1997 Curt Schilling No   1993 Randy Johnson No   2015 Clayton Kershaw ???
Dodgers,3dw8y6,DustyDGAF,2,Mon Jul 20 06:07:20 2015 UTC,"Kershaw has pitched 131 innings in 19 starts, which means he is pitching an average of 6.89 Innings Per Start.  If he has about 14 more starts left, than it can be expected that he will pitch approximately 97 more innings.  With a K/9 of 11.95, Kershaw has a strikeout rate of 1.328 strikeouts per inning  So, if Kershaw keeps his pace, he will have about 129 more K's this season, which will bring him to a total of 303 strikeouts.  Clayton's pace will be really difficult to keep, especially with 27 K's in his last 2 starts and at least 10 strikeouts in 8 starts. Fortunately though, 5 of these starts have been since June 6, which means that Kershaw is trending upward.   So, yes it is very possible and within reach for Kershaw to get 300 strikeouts this season. But he has to keep at his pace, which will be hard to do. If we look at the list of the top K/9 in a single season, Kershaw's current performance would put him at 9th all time, only being beaten by Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, and Kerry Wood. But if anyone could do it, Clayton Kershaw would, without doubt, be the one."

Dodgers,3ds4md,kaleidoscope_ize,24,Sun Jul 19 00:00:04 2015 UTC,"Kershaw change in stats after this game:   ERA: -.17  FIP: -.17  xFIP: -.12 (.14 LOWER than last year)  K/9: +.24  BB/9: -.13  Every game he's regressing back to his dominant mean. As long as he keeps his HR/9 rate down, I'd wager Kershaw wins the Cy Young again this year."
Dodgers,3ds4md,plzb0ss,22,Sat Jul 18 22:49:57 2015 UTC,I'd wager Kershaw wins the Cy Young again this year.   I honestly think Greinke will give him a run for his money.
Dodgers,3ds4md,UncleKRob,5,Sat Jul 18 22:56:36 2015 UTC,"Aside from ERA (which isn't very predicative in the first place), Greinke isn't even close to Kershaw. Greinke is great, but a lot of his success is riding on his ridiculously low BABIP, which is around .72 lower than his career average. Of course, the season is only half over, so that can all change."
Dodgers,3ds4md,plzb0ss,3,Sat Jul 18 23:02:38 2015 UTC,"I like you, this is fun.  While xFIP is a valuable and interesting measure, I do wonder if that Greinke is controlling his BABIP in ways that are advantageous to the current iteration of Dodger defense.  I am a Kershaw proponent... but I really like that there are guys like Greinke that push our current understanding of sabermetrics... especially when they are on our team."
Dodgers,3ds4md,fos4545,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:28:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I like you too. You make an interesting point. It certainly is possible that he's able to control his BABIP as you state.   Although, I would still be very skeptical about that assertion because he's never been able to control it before (i.e. his BABIP this year seems to be an outlier). Based on Occam's Razor (choose the simplest explanation), I would be inclined to say he's just been pretty lucky (which isn't a bad thing or a fault of his own).   Yes, the current understanding of sabermetrics is not perfect, nor will it ever be. Perhaps there will be a more evolved version in the future that contradicts the current one."
Dodgers,3ds4md,plzb0ss,4,Sun Jul 19 02:50:55 2015 UTC,You both are forgetting that Greinke can control other human beings with his mind.
Dodgers,3ds4md,NiceGuyJoe,4,Sun Jul 19 08:41:55 2015 UTC,"Sure, all the sabermetrics are important, but Record, K's, & ERA are the three most important categories when determining the Cy Young winner.  If Greinke keeps up this pace - which we know he's capable of, considering his Cy Young year - I don't think there's any doubt he'll best Kersh in Record & ERA (we all know Kersh is the K King).  Kersh is no doubt the better pitcher over the course of a career, but there's no reason why Greinke can't continue the special season he's having."
Dodgers,3ds4md,UncleKRob,0,Sun Jul 19 00:31:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, a lot of Cy Young voters are putting more emphasis on sabermetrics, a la Corey Kluber winning the Cy Young last year over Felix Hernandez. Even with a lower winning percentage and higher ERA (Kluber did have more strikeouts), he still won.   Here's a link supporting this: http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/what-corey-kluber-winning-the-cy-young-tells-us/  Plus, there are indications that Greinke may regress back to his 2014 numbers, like his really low BABIP (indicative of some luck, good defense), high LOB%, and an xFIP over 3.   Again, I love Greinke. He's kickass and one of my favorite players. But if these numbers hold over the course of the year, I wouldn't be of sound mind to give the Cy Young to Greinke solely due to ERA and record. I agree it would be close though."
Dodgers,3ds4md,plzb0ss,-2,Sun Jul 19 02:41:06 2015 UTC,"Actually, a lot of Cy Young voters are putting more emphasis on sabermetrics   Which is why I stated in my previous post that:   Sure, all the sabermetrics are important   I'm fully aware that Greinke's BABIP and xFIP indicate that he's playing out of his mind and can't keep it up, but I'm also fully aware that stranger things have happened, especially in what could end up being a contract year for him.  And to me, if a pitcher is tops in two of those categories (Record, ERA, K's), I think he's guaranteed to get a CY.  Time will tell though, and we should definitely count our blessings for having two incredible starting pitchers on our staff."
Dodgers,3ds4md,UncleKRob,0,Sun Jul 19 03:55:50 2015 UTC,Yeah but if he maintains his sub 1.5 era I think hes a pretty clear favorite.
Dodgers,3ds4md,jpops4,6,Sun Jul 19 00:13:44 2015 UTC,"I honestly think public perception might prevent that.   All of my dumb co-workers still bitch about how Kershaw sucks this year. I wondered for awhile if they were even watching the games, now I know they clearly aren't."
Dodgers,3ds4md,coolcoolawesome,2,Sun Jul 19 00:57:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a shame. If Kershaw keeps this up though, it's extremely probable that he'll get great traditional stats as well and people that don't follow sabermetrics can't argue that he sucks."
Dodgers,3ds4md,plzb0ss,16,Sun Jul 19 02:53:36 2015 UTC,Kershaw is the best pitcher in baseball and his curveball is the greatest curveball ever.  Upkershaws to the (le)ft

I don't follow other teams beside the Dodgers, and I don't watch that many highlights. I know Kris Bryant is a stud because of our series with the Cubs, but is there any other legitimate candidate? Also, DODGERS WIN!!! I LOVE L.A."
Dodgers,3ds4md,macandcharlie,6,Sat Jul 18 22:52:55 2015 UTC,"Right now it's a two man race between Joc and Bryant. Joc may have been slightly more valuable up to this point, but he's slumping and Bryant has been almost as valuable in less ABs. My money is on Bryant."
Dodgers,3ds4md,Jew_Tang-Clan,2,Sun Jul 19 01:31:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pitchers are starting to figure him out. Hope he can come back and win the award."
Dodgers,3ds4md,macandcharlie,2,Sun Jul 19 02:10:48 2015 UTC,Bryant also has the narrative on his side. He's been hailed as the Cubs savior of sorts.
Dodgers,3ds4md,FeelsGoodMan2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:27:48 2015 UTC,"You may be forgetting about Maikel Franco and Matt Duffy. It's more than a two-man race.

Dodgers,3ds4md,monchi17,0,Sat Jul 18 22:56:34 2015 UTC,I hope he can continue this dominance the second half. Needs to proof real losers wrong!
Dodgers,3dtpzx,joeboma,6,Sun Jul 19 10:54:39 2015 UTC,"Kershaw is typically a better pitcher in the second half, so it's entirely possible that he finishes with the numbers. But he had such terrible numbers through his first 9 starts he has to do enough to change the perception around his season.   The problem is that were in a pitchers league right now. Just a couple seasons ago, 2.84 era would be enough to win, and the lowest era in baseball. When Kershaw had a 2.84 era at the break, he was only 11th in the NL. So the bottom line is, he very likely will be in the conversation, but it is way way too early to tell given how well so many pitchers are pitching.  Plus, as you said, it is Greinke and Scherzers to lose right now, so both would have to have a few bad starts. For Kershaw to break top 3."
Dodgers,3dtpzx,razelbagel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:37:19 2015 UTC,"Obviously he has some pretty strong competition to go up against this year and it will probably come down to the wire, but every pitcher has a rough patch throughout a season, and Greinke and Scherzer are certainly due for one at some point. I think the biggest thing that will work against Kershaw is the guys voting not wanting to give it to the same guy over and over again. Though not to say Kersh doesn't have his work cut out for him, just that we all know what he is capable of.  We are talking about the best pitcher in the world here and as razelbagel mentioned, Kershaw usually pitches better in the second half than the first.   2014: last 18 starts 1.32 ERA, 168 SO, 23 BB, 143 IP  2013: last 16 starts 1.57 ERA, 114 SO, 19 BB, 114 IP  It really doesn't matter how he started and how people viewed his season at one point in the year. What matters is who has the better stats at the end. After what he has done over the last two years, as far as I am concerned, the Cy Young is Kershaw's until the last game of the season is played. The fact that he has a good chance at 300 strikeouts on top of what he will most likely end up with will only make his case all that stronger."
Dodgers,3dtpzx,nayrrrrr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:31:42 2015 UTC,"I think how a player closes out a season helps them in Cy Young voting, but they will take a look at the season's numbers, and I have to disagree with you that it's Kershaw's to lose. How are we forgetting Greinke?? As far as I'm concerned, it's Greinke's Cy Young to lose at this point."
Dodgers,3dtpzx,biggestbroever,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:05:23 2015 UTC,"he'll definitely end up with 300Ks+   Considering no one has done this in over a decade, I wouldn't say it's a foregone conclusion he'll make it. He's got a good shot but if he misses even one start or has a rough patch he won't get there."

Dodgers,3dp7lv,thedeejus,9,Sat Jul 18 03:10:24 2015 UTC,And I thought having an all-Brandon infield was weird.  This is just bizzare... great find

Dodgers,3dnd95,bozo7337,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:15:12 2015 UTC,As a senior he has no options though for baseball. It's either sign what the club that drafted you offers or do whatever you can with your degree.
Dodgers,3dnd95,piccoroll,0,Fri Jul 17 23:21:38 2015 UTC,The only option he misses is doing exactly what he just did. I don't think he wants to refuse millions of dollars twice...
Dodgers,3dnd95,bozo7337,0,Sat Jul 18 11:31:52 2015 UTC,My point is that seniors don't get near as much money as they're offered when they were drafted as juniors. I'm not insulting the kid I'm simply stating the fact that nearly all college seniors drafted sign for below slot.
Dodgers,3dnd95,piccoroll,0,Sat Jul 18 12:46:38 2015 UTC,That's not nearly a fact.

That's just the seniors taken in the first 4 rounds. Seven of them signed under slot the other three signed for exact spot.

Dodgers,3dnqep,jitatime,2,Fri Jul 17 19:44:54 2015 UTC,The hardest part was that Kimbrel trade.  Why? Why would you do that?  I hope there is some master plan no one knows of because this was such an annhilation of an organization that is unprecedented.  It's just sad.

He has been my ""oh shit, this dude is the real deal"" player thus far imo. Letting Kemp go to make room and gamble with Joc, you'd figure when the deal was made we would take a hit offensively. But we are doing just fine, if not better than fine (bullpen is doing their best to lose it for us).  I really want to see Kemp succeed, put up the all star numbers and kill it on both sides of the ball. Just isn't happening right now :/. He might be in a different camp, but he will be one of my personal favorites."

Dodgers,3dlsgh,SomalianRoadBuilder,2,Fri Jul 17 16:09:29 2015 UTC,"Not great   Funkhouser, whose advisor is Scott Boras, is believed to be the toughest of the three to sign.   EDIT: The FO must think they can land non-tendered SP this free agency cuz I'm sure they wouldn't hesitate to overpay our draftees otherwise.   The trick for the Dodgers is to get the three signed without surpassing the club's bonus pool cap by more than five percent, which would trigger a 75-percent tax on the overage. A 5-10 percent overage would result in the 75-percent tax plus forfeiture of the club's first- and second-round picks for next year.   If they signed a tendered FA SP this upcoming offseason, they'd lose that 1st round pick anyways. I'm sure they can work their magic in buying another Comp pick (like they did w/ Baltimore) next year if they feel they need a high round draft pick."

Dodgers,3dnwno,AndrewNava,6,Fri Jul 17 20:34:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's almost a lock the Dodgers bring in at least one starting pitcher and it may even be a good bet they bring in two depending on how Beachy performs in his next start. As far as who they get and for what, I'm sure your guess is as good as mine. Reports came out today that the Dodgers have progressed somewhat on talks with the Phillies for Hamels and that their asking price has become more reasonable.   My best guess would be at least Jose De Leon or Grant Holmes or maybe both, packaged around a couple lesser prospects for Hamels. I'd be okay with that though it would be a bummer to lose either De Leon or Holmes, but you can't get a front line starter locked up on a reasonable contract for nothing. It would also provide us with a backup plan should Greinke decide to not re-sign with us in the offseason. Though hopefully the plan would be to re-sign him regardless.  Then there is the rental type pitchers that are due to be free agents following the season in Cueto, Samardzija, and Kazmir. None of which would or should require any of our top flight prospects and I am pretty certain no matter what we will walk away with at least a Kazmir type, which I think a lot of people are undervaluing currently and he would slot in just fine behind Kersh and Greinke."
Dodgers,3dnwno,nayrrrrr,4,Fri Jul 17 20:40:01 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of speculation that the Dodgers will make a move for a premium ace pitcher like Cueto, Hammels, or Price. I just don't see that happening since basically any package that would land and of those guys would involve Seager, Urias, Olivera, and Puig. Or some combination there of. I don't think the Dodgers are interested in moving any of those guys so I'm guessing the FO will make a couple moves to land a solid to good starting pitcher to round out the 3rd spot in the rotation and a bullpen piece. Just can't see any monster trades happening as much as I'd like to."
Dodgers,3dnwno,fake_sagan,2,Fri Jul 17 20:33:25 2015 UTC,"We wouldn't send guys like Seager or Urias for rentals (Cueto/Price). Hamels, maybe, but we have a deep farm to not involve any of those guys."

Dodgers,3dkrfu,mpgiii,6,Fri Jul 17 01:48:41 2015 UTC,"For those who can't read cuz LA Times is dumb:  Yasiel Puig started this season with visions of becoming the Kobe Bryant or LeBron James of baseball.  With the Dodgers returning from the All-Star break on Friday, Puig is batting a pedestrian .261. He will enter the opener of a three-game road series against the Washington Nationals with only four home runs, in part because he was sidelined for six weeks with a strained hamstring.  Puig, 24, is in his third major league season, but is still a polarizing figure. People in a position to know describe his work habits as inconsistent and his clubhouse presence as irritating.  While there is increased skepticism within the organization as to whether Puig's production will ever match his talent, Dodgers Chairman Mark Walter remains optimistic.  ""I wouldn't give up on him now,"" said Walter, the team's controlling owner.  Walter said his backing of Puig is based not on the player's marketability, but on how he thinks Puig will develop as a player.  ""I think he's just going to be a great player,"" Walter said.  Walter pointed to a groundout by Puig last week in a home game against the Philadelphia Phillies.  ""If you watch him, he's playing hard,"" Walter said. ""Did you see that squibbler? He ran his butt off. He almost got there too.""  Walter continued, ""Puig clearly, clearly has incredible potential and talent. And I think he's got a big heart and wants to play hard. So I think that will show up.""  However, Walter said that if the front office decides it should trade Puig, he wouldn't prevent it from doing so.  ""It'd be dumb for me to hire them and tell them what to do,"" Walter said.  As of last week, Walter said he was unaware of any such conversations. ""But, to be fair, I'm not in that room all the time,"" he added.  With 2 1/2 months remaining in the regular season, Walter said he is pleased with the work of the team's new front office, which is headed by Andrew Friedman, the first-year president of baseball operations.  Walter is particularly encouraged by how the Dodgers have stocked their farm system, which he thinks will translate into long-term stability. The team spent more than $20 million this month to sign international amateur players.  ""If you go back two years, we have a much better list of young players in the minors than we did before,"" Walter said.  As for the big league team's performance this season, Walter said, ""You have to feel good where we're sitting.""  The Dodgers have a 4 1/2-game lead over the second-place San Francisco Giants in the National League West.  Of Manager Don Mattingly, Walter said, ""I think he's doing fine.""  Still, Walter acknowledged the Dodgers could improve.  ""There's still work to be done,"" he said. ""There's no question about that. It's not like we're dominant.""  The Dodgers already have a record payroll of more than $270 million, but Walter said Friedman will have financial freedom heading into the July 31 nonwaiver trade deadline. The team is in search of starting pitching to replace Hyun-Jin Ryu and Brandon McCarthy, who underwent season-ending operations.  ""It just has to be smart,"" Walter said.  In other words, he doesn't want the Dodgers to compromise their future by trading a top prospect or inheriting a contract that will limit their flexibility.  ""I don't think just money does it,"" Walter said. ""We have the highest payroll in baseball, but I don't think Washington's quaking in their boots when they're playing us. You can't buy a good team; you have to build a good team.""  While Walter said he prioritizes winning over glamour — ""I'd rather win the World Series than have three guys everybody thinks are stars and not make the playoffs"" — he said the Dodgers aren't lacking in headline attractions in the wake of the off-season departures of Matt Kemp, Hanley Ramirez and Dee Gordon.  ""We have five All-Stars,"" he said, referring to Zack Greinke, Clayton Kershaw, Adrian Gonzalez, Yasmani Grandal and Joc Pederson.  Walter said he would like Greinke to remain with the Dodgers beyond this season. Greinke started for the NL at the All-Star game and has the lowest earned-run average in baseball at 1.39.  Greinke can elect to become a free agent at the end of this season and forfeit the $71 million he is guaranteed over the next three seasons to try for a bigger deal.  Walter sounded hopeful about securing widespread distribution for the Dodgers-owned cable channel, SportsNet LA, which remains unavailable to the majority of households in the Los Angeles area.  Walter thinks the situation could be resolved before the end of the season.  ""You bet,"" he said.  Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications are currently the only major cable providers offering their subscribers SportsNet LA. TWC and the Dodgers are partners in SportsNet LA. Charter recently entered an agreement to purchase TWC.  Some analysts predict the blackout will remain in place through the season, with SportsNet LA not becoming widely available until Charter's merger with TWC is completed.  Walter said he was unaware of specifics, but added, ""I know there's a lot going on behind the scenes trying to get things done.""  Walter suspects the holdup is the proposed merger between AT&T and DirecTV.  ""I think if the AT&T merger was finished, it would be done,"" Walter said. ""The companies are so focused on that."""

But he needs to understand that although he can improve and one day be an incredibly consistent player, you can't ""will"" yourself into being Kobe Bryant.  I do think Puig can be a 5.0 WAR player each season, but he's not a 9-10 WAR player a la Trout"

Dodgers,3dgnl7,joeboma,16,Sat Jul 18 21:18:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's ridiculous that someone like Kershaw can be criticized for having a 2.85 ERA and 2.39 FIP also having the most strikeouts in all of baseball ( also having an 11.57 K/9) while pretty much anyone else can have a 3.2 ERA and a 3.75FIP with less than a 7 K/9 and be hailed as one of the best in baseball. I realize he isn't doing as well as he did last year but I also realize that the kind of stats he's putting up are worthy of still being considered one of the best. I still contend that he'e better than even Max Scherzer, because I doubt he puts up those kind of numbers for even 1 more season. Only the very best in baseball have been able to do what Kershaw has done. Put up 4 straight dominant years with the 5th year being excellent."
Dodgers,3dgnl7,PhilBlumburtt,8,Thu Jul 16 03:38:00 2015 UTC,"And the year is only half over. If he gets his ERA under 2, this regular season will be an unqualified success."
Dodgers,3dgnl7,Silasco,9,Thu Jul 16 04:35:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I kind of just want him to get it at 2 or a little above 2. I'll gladly take a sub 2 though."
Dodgers,3dgnl7,Honbomb,7,Thu Jul 16 07:25:36 2015 UTC,"His advanced stats are off the charts still, leads the majors in xFIP, 3rd in FIP and the average exit velocity when a hitter makes contact with one of his pitches is the lowest in baseball. This all means he's still pitching extremely well, just getting unlucky. As the random factors regress to the mean if he keeps pitching like this his traditional stats will start to fall back in line with what we've seen in prior years."

At any time if you look at our DL it's going to be in the 10s of millions of dollars on the bench.  I do remember at one time the team we had on the DL had more WAR than several teams. I think it was the time when Puig/Jansen et al. were on the DL. That was a mindfuck.

Dodgers,3deos2,Daghi,12,Wed Jul 15 18:07:05 2015 UTC,"Losing a first round pick seems like it would sting a bit more, but Reed seemed to be struggling in our farm system.  Related note, we passed on Sonny Grey to draft Chris Reed.  Reed was DFA'd by LA to make room on the 40-man, so this trade allowed us to get another lefty arm that we can stash in high minors without needing a 40-man spot.    I hope that Reed finds success with this change of scenery and I hope that Dayton keeps up his rather impressive numbers this season."
Dodgers,3deos2,mattsergent,8,Wed Jul 15 18:35:11 2015 UTC,"We passed on Gray because the team was poor in midst of bankruptcy and the McCourt divorce. Reed was drafted because he could be signed for nothing. He was taken too early and only because of the fiscal situation the team was in at the time. If Guggenheim owned the team at this draft, Reed wouldn't be the selection"

So money was it saved. It was a scouting pick. And a bad one. Logan White has always had an affinity for big, strong pitchers; and some times he lets smaller ones like tim lincecum and sonny gray pass because they didn't fit his physical criteria. Although kershaw was a great pick in lieu of Timmy, chris Reed was not in lieu of sonny gray.   Link to 2011 bonuses  http://www.baseballamerica.com/online/draft/news/2011/2612132.html"

Some examples:  ""And this is why Kershaw shouldn't have been in the All-Star game.""  ""Kershaw was garbageeeee! Lol""  Idc what anyone says, Kershaw is the man, the best pitcher in baseball. And it's not like he pitched awful last night, he was okay."
Dodgers,3dceks,TheZooBoy,8,Wed Jul 15 12:43:48 2015 UTC,I think there is constant ruckus surrounding Kershaw before and after the all star game because ultimately he is a great pitcher. Nobody is talking about anyone else who gave up a homer/runs after Kershaw because it's pointless. So it doesn't bother me much- he's just that kind of a pitcher on his own level.
Dodgers,3dceks,dablumoon,10,Wed Jul 15 15:53:42 2015 UTC,"Good point. I feel like everyone is trying to look for his flaws because he's so good.

Before finally getting to Dodger Stadium last year (and seeing Joc's MLB debut woo!) the last player I actively rooted for was Hershiser. After the '94 strike I swore off MLB for the minor leagues. Then the McCourt crap happened and it was like watching my high school BFF overdose on a reality show. Finally came back into the fold last season, and super glad I did. It's been crazy fun to catch back up and even though I went through some disillusionment with the team, I can honestly say I've bled Dodger blue the entire time.  Kiké Hernandez is my new fave. Rally banana."
Dodgers,3deld6,sirtomgravel,3,Wed Jul 15 22:12:59 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about being away. Some years ago I was a Mariner fan, and I didn't follow the Dodgers at all. Now, with the internet, I can get all the info on Dodger Blue!  As far as this season, yes, we have had a few changes. Dee is gone, so are Hanley, Uribe(PAPI!!!) and Kemp. The team was thriving in the first part of the season, now it seems that we are hobbling along. We have been a few games ahead of the Giants, but they are not doing spectacularly this season either.  We have a glut of outfielders. Ethier, Puig, Van Slyke, Crawford and as you mentioned, Pederson. We also have Hernandez and Guerrero take outfield as well. Crawford is on the DL as was Scott Van Smash.   Yasmani Grandal has been a steady player and been the brighter side of our trade with the Pades.  Ryu is out. DL for the remainder of the year. As is Brandon McCarthy. Hopefully Paco will be better soon and come back to our bullpen.  Also, Carlos Frias has been a surprise, bringing out some much needed wins. Hopefully he gets better soon as well.  Plus, Greinke is a beast. And Vin has called Pederson, our new center fielder, one of the best outfielders he has ever seen! He has been an amazing addition to the team and some of us regret ever having questioned him from his few appearances last year."

We've used nine different outfielders. The DL has hurt us A LOT - you could basically make a whole team from the guys who have had DL time, and it would be a good team too. But you know what? Despite all of that, we're still in FIRST PLACE. The team has shown a lot of resilience, has come from behind to win several times already this year, the team is hitting a ton of home runs, and they keep fighting. Everybody says the team isn't achieving what it should based on the payroll, but I think they're doing exactly what they're supposed to - and then some - considering how much of that payroll has been injured for extended periods."

Dodgers,3dc4es,_kona_,17,Wed Jul 15 18:23:20 2015 UTC,"I got nothing against Posey. Bumgarner legit seems like an ignorant jerk. The hate stems from the fact that guys like Joe Buck, Harold Reynolds, and the ESPN team praise them non-stop, even when they do something as mundane as grounding out. It's an endless stream of compliments even when the Giants have absolutely nothing to do with what's happening in the game. I think there was one point when 3 Giants players were mentioned during Pederson's at bat, and I'm pretty sure Joe Buck didn't say Joc's name once. Just called him the ""kid in left field.""

Dodgers,3dc4es,Bawfuls,24,Wed Jul 15 23:19:50 2015 UTC,"I dislike Bumgarner for the personality/character reasons others have mentioned here, but also because I think he's phenomenally overrated by the casual fan (and national media) after last October. Yes, you can crow about ""performance on the big stage"" and whatnot, but to paraphrase the man himself, ""he's not that fucking good!""  He's still a guy that's never posted an ERA+ over 125 in a season. Guys like John Lackey and CJ Wilson have had multiple seasons better than that. He's never finished higher than 4th in CY voting, he's never led the league in any pitching stats of note, etc. His best season would not qualify in the top-500 best pitcher seasons of all time. He is a good pitcher, an All-Star, but the way some people talk about him you'd think he's the second coming of Christy Mathewson or something.  It's also difficult to describe how absolutely infuriating it is to see someone like Bumgarner pitch so well in October while Kershaw simultaneously struggles in the same month. To know with absolute certainty that our guy is the undisputed best-pitcher-alive, but to have to watch him fail in the post season while their above-average guy makes it look effortless. It would be like if you had to watch Barry Bonds hit .200/.280/.360 in the NLCS and that same year Eric Karros wins WS MVP with a walk-off grand slam and 7 RBI's in Game 7, while hitting  .410/.500/.930 in the month of October.

As for the numbers you pointed out, strikeout-based stats heavily favor recent pitchers, because strikeout rates across baseball are at an all time high right now and have risen for nearly the entirety of MLB history.   Cy Young's career K/9 was only 4.25, do you think that means he was a shittier pitcher than Bumgarner (and basically everyone in a modern rotation)? Dan Haren has a career 4.05 K/BB, 5th all time among pitchers with 1000 IP (and just a hair above Bumgarner), is he one of the greatest ever? An ERA in the low 3's is good, but again the current MLB is a low run-scoring environment which is why I cited ERA+ where he looks a lot more mortal with a 114. Roger Clemens' career ERA was 3.12, higher than Bumgarner's, but he did that during the highest run-scoring era in baseball history, so his ERA+ was 143.  Your response is a perfect example of the phenomenon that's been cited in this thread, where Giants fans seem to over react to any attempt to put Bumgarner's career into context. Again, he's a good pitcher, just not an all-time great (and probably not a top-10 pitcher in the game today), and that's perfectly OK!"
Dodgers,3dc4es,falloutranger,2,Wed Jul 15 06:25:51 2015 UTC,"Again, he's a good pitcher, just not an all-time great (and probably not a top-10 pitcher in the game today), and that's perfectly OK!   See, I'm fine with this.    Your response is a perfect example of the phenomenon that's been cited in this thread, where Giants fans seem to over react to any attempt to put Bumgarner's career into context.    Not overreacting, but maybe I got your post jumbled up with another, maybe my eyes are tired, or maybe I've read too many 'not that fucking good' posts. I'm not saying he's GOAT or anything, and anyone who does is clearly too much of a homer. Same goes for the camp that thinks he's just a mediocre pitcher who does well in the playoffs, the truth is somewhere in between."
Dodgers,3dc4es,theburninator69,9,Wed Jul 15 06:32:11 2015 UTC,You didn't hear all the people saying he was as good as Kershaw after last year's playoffs? There was a lot of them. Too many
Dodgers,3dc4es,bq87,3,Wed Jul 15 11:29:36 2015 UTC,I heard as little as a month ago (or whenever the last time Kershaw faced the Giants) the guys on PTI agree that Kershaw was already being passed up by Bumgarner.
Dodgers,3dc4es,theburninator69,2,Wed Jul 15 16:51:22 2015 UTC,bruh
Dodgers,3dc4es,sonny_goliath,-4,Thu Jul 16 01:02:10 2015 UTC,"Well bum has beaten Kershaw in 2 or maybe 3 games this year (can't remember), so that might be why, but I think that speaks more to the ""clutchness"" or whatever. Kersh just doesn't seem to thrive in big game situations, whereas bum is better than usual  Edit: not sure why im getting downvoted, im trying to say that kersh is an overall better pitcher, but at least so far doesnt have a great track record with big games and on the flip side bum seems to over achieve in those situations. cant really quantify that at all, but kersh in general is a better pitcher"
Dodgers,3dc4es,_kona_,3,Wed Jul 15 17:17:47 2015 UTC,"Looking at who wins a pitching duel is a very superficial glance at who is the better pitcher because wins are so dependent on how well the offense does. In Kershaw's three games against the Giants he's given up 2 ER, 2 ER, and 4 ER. I will gladly take only giving up 2 runs in a start. That third game is a bad outing (If I remember correctly, he got pulled with runners on and the bullpen couldn't strand them), but he's gotten exactly 2 R, 1 R, and 0 R of support respectively in those games. I don't want to detract from the Giants pitching because giving up those few runs is great pitching, but it's damn tough to win games when the offense doesn't show up"
Dodgers,3dc4es,nayrrrrr,4,Wed Jul 15 21:56:20 2015 UTC,It's good then that he didn't say he sucks at throwing baseballs or that he is really just a garbage pitcher. Also Dan Haren is 6th all time in BB/K and Oliver Perez is 7th all time in K/9.
Dodgers,3dc4es,falloutranger,-3,Wed Jul 15 06:40:18 2015 UTC,I exaggerated a little. Also I don't actually think Joe Buck wears panties (80% sure) Those are cherrypicked stats of two separate players.
Dodgers,3dc4es,mattsergent,4,Wed Jul 15 06:43:59 2015 UTC,Joe Buck wears panties   This is probably accurate
Dodgers,3dc4es,nayrrrrr,8,Wed Jul 15 18:04:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't cherrypick the stats, you did. I just provided two examples of certainly not great pitchers with superior ranks than that of your pitcher."
Dodgers,3dc4es,Rtahnum1,11,Wed Jul 15 06:48:31 2015 UTC,"I personally don't like Bumgarner due to him getting pissed at Puig and Guerrero. As for Posey I just dislike him cuz hes on the giants. This is a dodgers sub, so dodgers fans will root against the giants/ their players. that's just how it is. It also doesn't help that you guys won the world series last year, we are pretty salty..."
Dodgers,3dc4es,ilovemesomeme,10,Wed Jul 15 03:42:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the vast majority of the, ""I bet Bochy is going to start Bumgarner"" was a joke. I doubt very many Dodger fans really thought that to be true. Most of us were upset that he left out Kershaw."
Dodgers,3dc4es,steppe5,-8,Wed Jul 15 03:33:51 2015 UTC,Perhaps he didn't want Kershaw to lose the all star game.
Dodgers,3dc4es,Im_Daydrunk,3,Wed Jul 15 06:22:53 2015 UTC,"Hindsight is 20/20, Kershaw is still the best pitcher in the game"
Dodgers,3dc4es,steppe5,-6,Wed Jul 15 07:09:23 2015 UTC,It's not hindsight when he left Kershaw off the team BEFORE the game.
Dodgers,3dc4es,Im_Daydrunk,4,Wed Jul 15 15:01:10 2015 UTC,"There's literally no way Bochy or any of us could have known Kershaws performance would be that bad in ASG before it happened, therefore when we judge it that means its hindsight.  If you somehow expected Kershaw to do bad (which means you probably just hate him because he's still pitching like his old Cy Young self) then you must have thought Bum would get lit the fuck up since he's not as good as Kershaw."
Dodgers,3dc4es,steppe5,-4,Wed Jul 15 15:49:38 2015 UTC,"Bochy knew exactly what was going to happen. Don't question the mighty soothsayer. That giant head of his holds the past, present, and future."
Dodgers,3dc4es,Mednebmedic,25,Wed Jul 15 18:09:47 2015 UTC,"He seems douchy. Not a fan of him calling puig ""boy"" or the whole Guerrero incident. Makes him look like a bigot. He's an awesome pitcher and shows his experience in the playoffs."
Dodgers,3dc4es,theburninator69,5,Wed Jul 15 03:28:49 2015 UTC,"Did he really call Puig ""boy""? You cannot do that shit in 2015! I really doubt we have evidence he actually said boy though"
Dodgers,3dc4es,Mednebmedic,3,Wed Jul 15 11:27:32 2015 UTC,Let me see if I can find that article or video. I think it happened last year after a home run. Puig was going from 3 to home and they exchanged words.
Dodgers,3dc4es,_kona_,2,Wed Jul 15 15:14:03 2015 UTC,it was either during that exchange or when bumgarner hit Puig then yelled at him like Puig did something wrong
Dodgers,3dc4es,-Phoenixx-,7,Wed Jul 15 21:45:47 2015 UTC,"I'm late because I just got off work, but:  I try to like MadBum (except when he's yelling at Dodgers), but it's hard when the media tries to shove it down our throats that he's GOAT and Kershaw's a choker. Don't get me wrong, he's a good pitcher, but I wouldn't even put him in my top 10 (at the moment). He had a monstrous postseason but in the end that's just a small sample size, and he hasn't shown that same level of talent in his overall career. Then to say Kershaw is a choker when he only really struggles against one team, the Cardinals. They ignore his amazing performances against the Braves in 2013. Anyway, that's a completely different tangent to get on.  I have no problems with Posey. I like him since he's probably gonna be remembered as at least one of the greatest players of this decade (too early in his career to say anything definitive about how he'll be remembered in comparison to all-time greats). He deserves all the respect he's given (except he definitely shouldn't have been in the Franchise Four over Matthewson, but that's your problem not mine). And that Esurance commercial they kept playing today? Hilarious.  Also if there's one thing that Giant and Dodger fans can agree on, it's that National League is Best League. We both like seeing the National League win in the All-Star Game. Bruce Bochy has a 1-3 record in the All-Star Game and therefore should not manage any more. It's for the best of the league. He just doesn't have the will to win."
Dodgers,3dc4es,Im_Daydrunk,20,Wed Jul 15 08:00:36 2015 UTC,"A lot of Giants fans turn every argument into a brag about how their team has won 3 of the last 5 championship which becomes frustrating, so all we can really talk about are the Giants players. Also its not like we are the only ones who do that, the Giants sub seems very anti-Dodgers players (especially Puig)."
Dodgers,3dc4es,spike021,8,Wed Jul 15 03:13:03 2015 UTC,"¯\(ツ)/¯  I think Puig's alright. He can be a bit immature sometimes, but nobody's perfect and he's fun to watch sometimes.   http://i.imgur.com/ce9b3lx.gifv"

Dodgers,3dc4es,Silasco,2,Wed Jul 15 04:46:19 2015 UTC,What did he say to guerrero?
Dodgers,3dc4es,DatBuridansAss,4,Wed Jul 15 18:32:10 2015 UTC,"Guerrero had hit a dinger off him earlier in the game. Next at bat, bumgarner throws the pitch, and Guerrero pops it foul and out of play behind him. He then goes into this wincing crouch thing like ""dammit that was my pitch can't believe I missed it."" But you could tell it was directed at himself. He wasn't showboating or trying to insult madbum. But madbum took offense, and he immediately leaves the mound and stomps off in Guerrero's direction saying ""you're not that fucking good."" As in, ""you haven't earned the right to think you can compete with me."" It was the most arrogant fucking overreaction I've seen to what was really nothing. A competitor reacting to his own mistake. But I guess in Madbum's mind, if wasn't a mistake at all, the rookie is just inferior to him.  That's how most Dodger fans interpreted that exchange, and that adds a lot of fuel to the fire. We don't like the dude, because by all indications hes a massive prick, yet the national media washes up his balls any chance they get."
Dodgers,3dc4es,Silasco,2,Wed Jul 15 21:40:35 2015 UTC,What an ass. Just watched the video. That's totally what guerrero did. I do that shit when I miss a shot in soccer. God I hate bumgarner.

Dodgers,3dc4es,PlutoniumPa,2,Wed Jul 15 10:59:36 2015 UTC,"I didn't watch the game today so I am not sure if you are specifically referring to the reactions to incidents in the game or not. But overall I have absolutely no hate for Posey and think he is the most underappreciated hitter in the game. And I can't really recall him doing anything to rub me the wrong way.   I also believe Bochy to be the best manager in the game and am in awe of how he can get so much out of so little at times. As far as the rest of your team goes, I think most of them are pretty good guys and anything they may do that would annoy me I think any other set of players that just won 3 in 5 would do as well.  Then there is Madison Bumgarner. I think he is probably one of the 20 best pitchers in baseball and that his postseason last year was obviously one of the greatest of any pitcher ever. I also think he comes off as full of himself and a little ridiculous at times. My biggest problem is how he criticizes other players for showing emotion and yet is one of the most emotional and animated pitchers in the game. He also seems to project a sense of disdain and contempt for his competition at times that makes it difficult to not make assumptions about his character."
Dodgers,3dc4es,metrofeed,2,Wed Jul 15 06:30:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone dislikes Posey. He's a great player.    I don't have a problem with Bumgarner himself.  He's a very good pitcher.  The problem Dodgers fans have is that ever since the World Series, every time the media drools over how clutch and gritty Bumgarner is, they make sure to mention how Kershaw's a ""choker"" who ""can't get it done in October.""   He's basically the new David Eckstein."
Dodgers,3dc4es,kevms,3,Wed Jul 15 13:22:16 2015 UTC,"Jealousy.   We are mad that he shows up in the biggest possible games and our Ace, who is objectively a better pitcher, does not.   Sure this opinion will be down voted but it's the truth. If Bumgarner failed in the World Series, we'd be singing a different tune."
Dodgers,3dc4es,MystAJ,2,Wed Jul 15 10:35:33 2015 UTC,"This is the best answer in the thread. We hate the Giants because they've won 3 World Series the past 5 years. If they hadn't, we'd be indifferent to your ""unlikable"" players instead of hating their guts. That's just the nature of sports. If the Dodgers had won 3 chips the past 5 years, you'd hate Puig and Joc and Greinke a LOT more."

Dodgers,3dc4es,xray606,2,Wed Jul 15 05:01:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much every comment here. Every discussion about who the better pitcher is - Kershaw or Bumgarner - turns into, ""THREE RINGS IN FIVE YEARS. LETS SEE KERSHAW'S PLAYOFF STATS,"" when in actuality, sabermetrics have pointed to the fact that Kersh has been better. Much better.   I love posey because he never does anything wrong. He does what I was always taught while playing baseball and let's his play do his trash talking.   Bumgarner on the other hand seems like he thinks he's entitled to a lot of things. He had an amazing postseason last year but after that altercation against Guerrero, which was uncalled for, and him arguing balls and strikes (this may have just been the two or three games I've seen him pitch this year), I just feel like he thinks he's better than he is.   For me personally, I'm not taking away from his accomplishments. I just don't like his attitude."

Dodgers,3d9gsm,mevans93308,30,Tue Jul 14 15:24:43 2015 UTC,"""How come there was no mention of the now-infamous decision to bench Puig for Andre Ethier in Game 4 of the 2014 NLDS against the Cardinals?  I did write about it, although maybe it was indirect. I wasn’t surprised at all that he was pulled. Yadier Molina give Puig a hard time and everyone knows it, including Puig. In 34 career playoff at-bats against the Cardinals, Puig is slashing .235/.297/.353 with 18 strikeouts. And to take it even further, his BABip is .500. Ordinarily I would say that’s a small sample size, except that Puig’s an emotional player, and he was an absolute wreck. I wrote about how during the NLCS the year before no one could find him in the middle of Game 2 because he was in the tunnel sobbing after striking out for the third time. The coaching staff didn’t want him out there.""  Fuck now I'm crying. I love Puig more than I should."

It was fun to joke about his strange obsession with veteran bullpen guys who suck, but I never knew how deep the rabbit hole really went.  Apparently, the last straw leading to his firing was that he threw a profane temper tantrum after Kasten vetoed his proposed trade for 36 year old Joaqin Benoit, because the analytics department got fed up with his shit and mutinied."

Why? Because the anti-Puig circlejerk is strong and easy to monetize through clicks. Molly Knight at least seemed to paint a very three-dimensional Puig and gives him his day in court in the book. Yahoo could care less about that. They just want the dirt so they can get the clicks.  I mean, Yahoo has a long history of drama-whoring and clickbaiting. Ms. Knight doesn't.

Basically the book was about the 2013 Dodgers, except that team didn't win the World Series so the book kept going. And they didn't win in 2014. So the book kept going. It didn't really have a end. And it wasn't incredibly well put together or edited.  Easily could have been 100 pages less and stopped after the 2013 season, but then it wouldn't have been much of a story."

I think this is just going to make me more curious about the Dodgers then anything. I want to know the verb nickname. I want to know who has a major beef with her now. I'm sure the Dodgers organization got advance copies and the players already have an opinion and know how they are portrayed in the book and how to respond to future media questions stemming from the book.
Dodgers,3d9gsm,Bawfuls,3,Tue Jul 14 16:09:16 2015 UTC,I want to know who has a major beef with her now   I'm guessing Hanley
Dodgers,3d9gsm,capncoke,4,Tue Jul 14 22:07:31 2015 UTC,"My opinion, McKnight's sources were players who aren't on the team this year.  More specifically, I think the one person who disliked Puig the most, and could spill on clubhouse drama with nothing to lose, was Kemp.  Which is really hard to comprehend considering the Kemp/Kent clubhouse drama, and how that whole thing went down."
Dodgers,3d9gsm,ellipsesijkl,3,Tue Jul 14 17:26:40 2015 UTC,"My opinion, McKnight's sources were players who aren't on the team this year.   Considering she followed the team for two full seasons, that would be extremely unlikely. You think she embedded with the team for two seasons and just magically didn't get any information from the ones that are still there in 2015? In 2013 there would have been lots of players for her to talk to who had no idea if they would be on the team 2 years later or not."
Dodgers,3d9gsm,capncoke,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:11:16 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, so let me clarify.  I believe it's much easier for her to claim her sources had intimate knowledge of the clubhouse atmosphere if those sources are no longer with the team.  Not to mention all of her information is old news, and there were players who clashed with Puig (most notably Matt Kemp) that probably wanted to create a negative image of him."
Dodgers,3d9gsm,ellipsesijkl,2,Tue Jul 14 22:58:14 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what you're saying. She and kemp both didn't know he was getting traded when the book and interview with kemp happened. So how is this a problem with you? You do realize how long it takes to write, edit, rewrite, reedit, publish, print, and distribute a book right?"
Dodgers,3d9gsm,capncoke,-1,Wed Jul 15 00:11:01 2015 UTC,"Kemp wanted to get traded last year, and was very vocal about it.  His performance during the second half of 2014 significantly helped his trade value.  During the 2013 season, reports came out that there were veteran players who clashed with Puig, those players are not on the team.  I don't understand why you think it's hard to comprehend McKnight seeking out certain players who likely knew they wouldn't be on the team in the foreseeable future.  Like I stated earlier, if someone knows they're going to be leaving, what do they have to lose by spilling some information."
Dodgers,3d9gsm,bq87,2,Wed Jul 15 00:36:24 2015 UTC,"dude, who the hell is McKnight why do you keep saying McKnight. Kemp might have wanted to get traded, but guess what he wasn't until this year two years after he gave those interviews. I don't understand why you have a problem with her interviewing a guy who was willing to be interviewed. What's wrong with her interviewing the guys who wanted to be interviewed and respecting those who didn't?  I'm also guessing you haven't actually read the book because you keep calling her McKnight and the fact that Kemp was spilling the beans doesn't mean that he as a source is more unreliable than any other. She's looking for perspectives from other players on Puig, she's asked many others, she's observed him as much as she could, and if you actually read the book, doesn't paint him in a bad light."

It was basically a traditional old guy vs new young guys type of thing, and Kemp was the one that shot back at Kent over it."
Dodgers,3d9gsm,IHFP,5,Tue Jul 14 18:16:16 2015 UTC,"Kent was the veteran player surrounded by a group of younger players.  Matt Kemp was basically Puig in the clubhouse at the time (minus the emotions), and the two clashed a lot.  Also, this post from a year ago summarizes the potential underlying conflict between Kemp and Puig."
Dodgers,3d9gsm,npno,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:30:49 2015 UTC,"I have a theory and you guys can raise your concerns about it...  I don't think the Dodgers were supposed to win the past few years.  I feel like the management post-McCourt wanted to fill the stadium asap so they bought some exciting vets and waited to develop young prospects such as Puig, Joc, Seeger, etc.  For the past years the Dodgers have won many games, hit the ball frequently, but no WS.  Colletti was supposed to be the fall guy, once the prospects were primed and the focus shifted to a WS ready team, Colletti takes the blame and loses his job.  That's why he's still with the team, he did what he was supposed to do, he sucked."

Dodgers,3d9gsm,DatBuridansAss,6,Tue Jul 14 17:58:43 2015 UTC,"A few months ago Kemp led off in the #1 spot and she said something like ""ooo arthritis hips Kemp is leading off, lets see how this goes"" idk maybe I'm over reacting a bit, but that is kinda classless for a public reporter to say.   Edit: I'll look for it one sec  Ok found one   Apparently it's a inside joke or something, idk, I didn't get it nor did I like it."
Dodgers,3d9gsm,ieandrew91,6,Tue Jul 14 18:10:44 2015 UTC,"It's not an inside joke, and it's not a slight toward Kemp of any kind. If anything, it's complimentary to him. If you remember the craziness surrounding that trade, and all the uncertainty, and how it got dragged out for a few weeks. Then somebody leaked the arthritic hips thing, and it looked like the deal was going to be sunk, which would have been bad for everybody. Well, it went through, and now fastforward to June, and the guy with the hips that everybody was debating about is leading off. I take it as a subtle jab at the wild hype and hottakes that frantically surround these stories before stampeding off toward the next topic."
Dodgers,3d9gsm,DatBuridansAss,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:20:22 2015 UTC,"Well considering the fact that Molly was the one who was talking the most shit about Kemp when he was with the Dodgers, it's safe for me to believe that her statement wasn't a nice one. Plus, how could that even been seen as a plus comment for someone. The other guy who responded to my comment was spot on. It was a ""why the fuck is he leading off deal"" which would of been ok, but why do you have to bring his disability into it."
Dodgers,3d9gsm,ieandrew91,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:24:36 2015 UTC,"well unfortunately somebody leaked his medical info, which isn't cool. I don't follow twitter religiously, so I don't know what she said or didn't say about Kemp. But assuming she wasn't the one who first reported on his hips, I don't have a problem with her using that info in her narratives, since the info is now a matter of public record.   Also, we fans are outsiders. I would imagine shit goes down between players and beat reporters that none of us are privy to. It's possible that Kemp and Knight hate each other, and she certainly wields a great deal of power over him in the court of public opinion. Not saying it's right, but she knows shit about these guys that few others do, and it's really up to her own judgment what she is going to divulge."

""Ol ALS Lou Gehrig is leading off tonight"" this sentence to me is just as bad.  Everything else you are 100% spot on, it's her right to spill all of this and it's my right to dislike her because of it."
Dodgers,3d9gsm,ishzendejas,8,Tue Jul 14 19:57:08 2015 UTC,"Hyperbole noted, but I'm saying you're misinterpreting her point. She wasn't making fun of a guy for playing through his injuries. She was making fun of the people who were saying his career was over because of his injuries. It would be one thing if she said ""Matt Kemp and his arthritic hips are on the bench today."" That would be kind of fucked up. But this was the opposite. Like ""hey assholes, you were all saying the dude can't play anymore, but look, he's leading off.

Of course, this is in GREAT part to consistency from A-Gon/Kendrick, and surprising seasons from both Grandal and Pederson.  Puig hasn't quite found his groove (but hopefully will in Semester 2), but Ethier is having a comeback year.  Considering we have been just .500 since a great start to the season, we will definitely need to keep up a strong pace to win the division.   A lot of our offensive stats are inflated due to an amazing start to the season, so take those with a grain of salt.

Team has been in first virtually all season, despite a lot of injuries that could have crippled lesser clubs. (#3 and #4 starters out for the season, Puig missed a month, Crawford will miss more than 2 months, Jansen missed all of April, half a dozen bullpen pitchers have missed time to injury, etc)  They will almost certainly trade for another starting pitcher in the next two weeks, possibly bullpen help too. Recent Cuban signee Olivera will be called up before long to bolster infield depth, #1 prospect in baseball Corey Seager will be called up by September at the latest.  Rookie CF Joc Pederson is mashing home runs, leading the team in walks, and playing elite defense. He nearly won the home run derby last night, losing by 1 in the final. Matt Kemp was traded to San Diego in the winter and is sucking there, meanwhile the main piece the Dodgers got in return, catcher Yasmani Grandal, is quietly the best hitting catcher in baseball this year. Justin Turner has won the starting 3B job and is hitting even better than he was last year, with a lower BABIP and more power. Greinke leads all of MLB with a 1.39 ERA at the break. Kershaw is ""struggling"" with a 2.86 ERA but leads MLB in strikeouts, xFIP, and 3rd in FIP. As a team, the Dodgers lead the NL in home runs this year.  This team is good and they are still in a strong position. Here's the Dodgers record at the All Star break each of the last 3 seasons:  2015 - 51-39 (.567) 2014 - 54-43 (.557) 2013 - 47-47 (.500)    People are freaking out because there have been bullpen meltdowns and Kershaw has looked mortal, but this team is still on pace to win 92 games and coast to a third straight division win (would be a first in franchise history)."

One thing I wanted to add is a bit less tangible... I feel like there has yet to be a clear identity to this team. There doesn't seem to be much to rally around aside from Joc Pederson. The team hasn't put together dominant stretches of games together. It's often difficult to point at one thing and say, ""That's who we are.""  Of course, there's a lot of baseball still left to play to establish a sort of identity so I'm not terribly concerned about it. But it's something that's in the back of my head as the season goes on.  I think another semi-related issue is the television issue in Los Angeles. About 60% of the Southern California area are unable to watch the Dodgers regularly on television going on, like, two years now and I think that has gradually created a disconnect between the fans and the team."

I remember being at Buffalo Wild Wings when that brawl went down and seeing it on 14 screens feeling like I was one of William Wallace's troops during the speech of speeches in ""Braveheart""!!  Also, I was one of those 2-seasons-with-no-TV-availability fans, and it wasn't until the HR Derby that I woke up and said ""You know what? No stupid TV deal is gonna keep me from my guys"". And I gotta thank you guys here on this sub for getting me not only caught up but also fired up about the second half of the season!! :]"

Dodgers,3d7ecc,leftylogan,9,Tue Jul 14 02:35:52 2015 UTC,The rigged accusations are because they completely ignored the no throws until the ball lands rule for Frazier. There's more than a few instances where they just threw right through the don't throw sign from the umpire.
Dodgers,3d7ecc,mikeycamikey10,11,Tue Jul 14 06:33:10 2015 UTC,They should make it so the second person doesn't know the first persons score. It's that simple

Then Joc goes out and fucking nails it and showed up in the spotlight. The kid's a rookie and looked damn comfortable out there and not in a cocky way either. The kid is very humble and I love that about Joc. That's why he's the next jersey I'm getting.

Dodgers,3d7exr,strategolegends,14,Tue Jul 14 02:48:32 2015 UTC,"True. Right now Bryant has a higher WAR, AVG and I think OBP? Joc has a higher SLG, more homeruns and a higher ISO. Hopefully he can edge him out."
Dodgers,3d7exr,dodgers12,11,Tue Jul 14 02:50:06 2015 UTC,"If the 2011 MVP race between Kemp and Braun is any indication, voters seem more eager to reward playoff teams.

Dodgers,3d7exr,strategolegends,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:54:02 2015 UTC,Valid point. Mets are still in the race too. This may be one of the few times that I wish for the giants to win a wild card spot.

Dodgers,3d7exr,RedAnthony,5,Tue Jul 14 02:58:58 2015 UTC,Joc was awesome! I bet with my dad that Joc would win the final against the Rutgers alum but fell a little short. I said after that Joc will be hittin HR's in the postseason (hopefully) while Frazier will be sittin at home wishin he could be.
Dodgers,3d7exr,Ge0Po,2,Tue Jul 14 02:57:04 2015 UTC,Disappointing end result but what an awesome ride! Go Joc!

Dodgers,3d7exr,LOUD__NOISES,2,Tue Jul 14 03:48:00 2015 UTC,"Was it just me, or did it seem like Frazier was hitting balls before his previous ball had landed? The analysts kept harping how he had the most swings per round, and I think it was because his brother was lobbing pitch after pitch before the previous landed. Anyways, I probably just sound like a sore loser, I REALLY wanted Joc to win."

Dodgers,3d7lom,bluecuracao323,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:32:44 2015 UTC,"Greinke's gone on record as saying that he's a big believer in advanced statistics, and especially FIP as a measure of pitcher quality.  When he says he was better in 2009, and that he's been lucky this season, he's correct from a sabermetric point of view.   So far this season, while any way you look at it he's been great, his FIP of 2.65 is higher than his 2009 FIP of 2.33, and is nearly double his 1.39 ERA.  This is attributable to his career-low .233  BABIP (career average .301) and career high 89.5% strand rate (career average 74.7%), which means that he has so far been very lucky, and the beneficiary of good defense behind him."

Dodgers,3d5358,clarkbarniner,5,Mon Jul 13 16:33:09 2015 UTC,I wasn't seriously thinking it would happen but I thought Bochy would start MadBum just to get an uproar from Dodger fans.
Dodgers,3d5358,PAO_RT_IN_THE_KISSER,6,Mon Jul 13 17:04:26 2015 UTC,Zack. Mother fucking. GRANICK!!
Dodgers,3d5358,Pavel_Datsyuks_Cat,15,Mon Jul 13 17:04:37 2015 UTC,What are the chances of the Dodgers' FO resigning him? They're going to have to throw a lot of money at him to make him stay and I think it will be worth it. We can't lose the 1-2 punch combo that made us the division champs several times.
Dodgers,3d5358,thnkblu,13,Mon Jul 13 16:53:49 2015 UTC,"It depends on how much he likes it here or if he wants money. this FO won't pay him more than his worth, not with the young arms they have in the system and the FA pitchers next year. It will be interesting."
Dodgers,3d5358,keepitonehundred,4,Mon Jul 13 16:56:18 2015 UTC,"I would be surprised if it came down to him not liking it here. We are going to be contenders for the next few years and should only be getting better with how good our farm system and front office is. Money would also surprise me, but to a lesser degree, because there are only a few teams who I imagine could outbid us."
Dodgers,3d5358,CookieMonstarr,7,Mon Jul 13 19:21:51 2015 UTC,"It's probably not money, but years that would be the problem. It's hard to see them go over 4 years for someone his age, and given the last couple big FA pitcher signings I doubt that's enough."
Dodgers,3d5358,Jacktheawesome,6,Mon Jul 13 19:43:03 2015 UTC,"Zack has made it clear multiple times that he is going to go to whoever offers him the most money, but that may just be his way of avoiding FA questions."
Dodgers,3d5358,keepitonehundred,3,Mon Jul 13 19:49:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm just saying that for the Dodgers FO the limiting factor in their offer will probably be the years, as money isn't so much of an issue for them."
Dodgers,3d5358,Jacktheawesome,3,Mon Jul 13 20:05:08 2015 UTC,I hope maybe he likes the new front office and wants to stay. Having money is fine. Having money and the brains to build a good team is rare but we have it now. I think he's the kind of player that knows that and might stay if they give him the length he wants more than just the big money.
Dodgers,3d5358,atducker,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:08:18 2015 UTC,"I'm all in for extending Grienke. It's hard to pass up on such a dominant rotation. Now, if only the Dodgers can get Cueto without giving away too much, I'm sure this will be the championship rotation this year."
Dodgers,3d5358,thnkblu,13,Mon Jul 20 19:36:14 2015 UTC,"God is good! I have the giants channel at work,  so it's surreal to see Botchy sitting next to Greinke singing his praises.  Greinke added no commentary when asked if he wanted to share a few words."
Dodgers,3d5358,Briarsaunt,9,Mon Jul 13 17:20:10 2015 UTC,Awesome! I was totally expecting Bochy to pick Bumgarner so this is a great surprise. Greinke has been a beast and definitely deserves it.

Dodgers,3d78w2,astern,7,Tue Jul 14 02:43:31 2015 UTC,I think he said he would trade him for Brian McCann. You know that stung Ellis but the truth hurts
Dodgers,3d78w2,Thefirmbiz,2,Tue Jul 14 03:14:23 2015 UTC,"I just finished Molly Knight's book. What Greinke meant was that because AJ Ellis was coming off his 3.5 WAR age 32 season, he had peaked in value, and that a savvy GM should want to trade him at that time to maximize the return.  His words were something along the lines of ""Trade you and sign Brian McCann in the offseason.""  Greinke's known in the clubhouse as an extremely analytical guy who's hobby is evaluating prospects, and has made known his desire to one day be a GM. His nickname is supposedly ""Trader Zack"" because he's always wheeling and dealing in the team's fantasy football league.  Greinke was answering from the view of sabermetrically savvy GM who wants to maximize the value of a catcher coming off a career year, but will be unlikely to repeat the performance in the future, but AJ thought it was personal, and said something like ""Well, I'd trade you!"""

Dodgers,3d7foo,ThomasFurke,10,Tue Jul 14 05:40:59 2015 UTC,"There's no reason to be salty. Our guy, a rookie mind you, put up the second-largest score in the first round, was delayed by the cancer deal, then had to hit virtually twice in a row in the semis and finals. He survived Albert Pujols' big comeback and still put up big numbers each round, along with two of the biggest jacks of the night. He got booed because he wasn't Frazier, but was a class act the whole time, and his interaction with his brother Champ and Pujols was the non-HR highlight of the night. It was a fantastic night, and we should all be proud of our guy."
Dodgers,3d7foo,NSFAnythingAtAll,7,Tue Jul 14 08:13:24 2015 UTC,I ain't even mad. He put up more dingers in the derby than any previous dodger combined (fairly certain). He was even tied with the guy who won.

Dodgers,3d4ptf,AndrewNava,8,Mon Jul 13 15:09:12 2015 UTC,"i think kershaw will still win cy young. he can probably still get his era to 2.0 or less, and i doubt greinke stays under two."
Dodgers,3d4ptf,nenright,6,Mon Jul 13 17:49:12 2015 UTC,"He's got an uphill battle with the ERA currently, but he could certainly do it. Will depend on how Scherzer's second half goes as well.  Personally, I'm more excited at the chance Kershaw has of throwing 300 strikeouts this season. odds are against him, but it is within reach and no one's done that since Schilling in 2002. If he gets some run support to help the W-L, brings the ERA down to low-2's, and makes it to 300 strikeouts I bet he can win the CY even if Scherzer has more wins and a better ERA."
Dodgers,3d4ptf,Bawfuls,5,Mon Jul 13 18:12:29 2015 UTC,I don't see scherzer having a sub-2 ERA at the end of the year and Kershaw has the lowest xFIP in the league and his ERA is coming down. If he gets to 1.85(1 run lower than it is now) with 250 or so strikeouts I can see him winning cy young.
Dodgers,3d4ptf,nenright,4,Mon Jul 13 18:36:15 2015 UTC,I think it's more likely Kershaw has >250 strikeouts this year than it is he gets his ERA below 2.00
Dodgers,3d4ptf,Bawfuls,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:52:32 2015 UTC,I like your point because I think strikeouts will help him win Cy Young votes as well. I'm really doubtful though that he can put together a sort of package that he'd need to get the most votes.
Dodgers,3d4ptf,Bawfuls,0,Mon Jul 13 20:12:11 2015 UTC,There's a chance that somebody like Gerrit Cole gets hurt and Greinke's ERA increases slightly but we'd need to see Kershaw go out and pitch lights out pretty much every game he's in and deep into the post season and then he might have a chance. But he's way behind in wins and ERA right now and this is not a high scoring Dodgers team that looks to really help a guy like him out in a 1-0 game.
Dodgers,3d4ptf,Bawfuls,8,Mon Jul 13 19:02:00 2015 UTC,"we'd need to see Kershaw go out and pitch lights out pretty much every game he's in and deep into the post season and then he might have a chance.   Regular season awards voting happens before the postseason begins, so this is irrelevant.   this is not a high scoring Dodgers team that looks to really help a guy like him out in a 1-0 game.   This is one of the best Dodgers offenses in franchise history. They are currently 2nd to only the 1953 Dodgers in wRC+, for example. They currently lead the NL in OPS, despite Dodger Stadium being a pitcher's park."
Dodgers,3d4ptf,nenright,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:57:23 2015 UTC,That's a good correction about the post season. I didn't know voting started that early. On hitting you can quote stats that make the team seem better than it is but the results speak for themselves when Kershaw has taken the mound. Over the last 7 games Kershaw has pitched in he's allowed 3 or fewer earned runs in every game but the Dodgers are averaging 2.7 runs per game. He has 4 losses and 3 wins. Two of those wins were when the opposing team scored zero runs. He's lost 2 of those games by 1 run and 2 by 2 runs. He's got to be grateful for the great defense but 1 or 2 key hits would have made Kershaw a winner likely in any or all of those 4 games he lost.
Dodgers,3d4ptf,Bawfuls,3,Mon Jul 13 20:27:04 2015 UTC,On hitting you can quote stats that make the team seem better than it is but the results speak for themselves when Kershaw has taken the mound.    This is nonsense. There's nothing magical about this team that makes the offense just be bad when Kershaw is pitching and great when he's not. It's random bad luck and nothing more.
Dodgers,3d4ptf,Bawfuls,3,Mon Jul 13 20:35:55 2015 UTC,"The trouble is it takes wins as well, more than just ERA. He's lead all of baseball in ERA each of the last 4 seasons I believe, but he didn't win in 2012 because his record wasn't as strong compared to R. A. Dickey's. He might have finished 2nd in 2013 as well if there had been a 20 game winner in the NL to compare him to. With just 6 wins and nearly 2 thirds of a season over I would put my money on Kershaw finishing really strong down the stretch but not really catching the pack of current Cy Young candidates."
Dodgers,3d4ptf,Bawfuls,3,Mon Jul 13 18:58:54 2015 UTC,"Well yeah I see your point but the reason RA Dickey won that year was because he had 20 wins on a losing team, one of the very few pitchers in history to ever do that IIRC"
Dodgers,3d4ptf,bq87,3,Mon Jul 13 20:54:33 2015 UTC,"but he didn't win in 2012 because his record wasn't as strong compared to R. A. Dickey's   I disagree with this reading of the 2012 CY vote. Wins haven't been a huge decider ever since Felix won his CYA with a 13-12 record. Dickey won in 2012 because he had an historically good year for a Knuckleballer. Wins may have swayed a couple voters, but Dickey did have more IP and more K's than Kershaw that year."
Dodgers,3d4ptf,thegetawayplan9,2,Mon Jul 13 19:51:48 2015 UTC,six of the last eight winners since Felix have had 20+ win seasons. It's an important number. I think he's out of the running already and I don't think he can pitch himself back into the running. I'd love to be wrong though.
Dodgers,3d4ptf,thedude596,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:39:47 2015 UTC,"You don't think he can pick up 14 wins in the second half?  Even if he doesn't, you don't think he can plunge his ERA low enough to make up for a couple wins?"
Dodgers,3d4ptf,TheMattsMeow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:43:02 2015 UTC,"Does he even have 14 starts left this season? He could maybe plunge his ERA. I guess the best path would be 14 or 15 wins total, eye popping strikeouts, and an ERA close to the top, and hope if there's a 20 game winner in the NL that their other stats don't particularly stand out."

I just hope he doesn't follow the pattern of Dodgers in the homerun Derby (seriously, our team record is 5, by Hee Sop Choi. That needs to change).  I still think Dee regresses, his BA was unsustainable and I don't hate moving on from him. Heaney is off to a hot start but also struggled in the minors. 4.71 era in AAA and a 1.7 era in the majors through 4 games, he obviously won't end up that low. The biggest think about Kendrick though, is either we re-sign him and great, have our 2b ,for the next couple years, or we don't, give him a qualifying offer, and get a draft pick compensation when he signs a likely decent sized contract somewhere else. So it wouldn't just be Dee for Kike, Hatcher, and Barnes"

Dodgers,3d4s1n,Giobenavides,3,Mon Jul 13 23:03:26 2015 UTC,"Lots of people went to Comic-Con. Not me, however. Without checking the lineup, Stanton. Joc's approach lends itself to being good at this sort of thing, but I don't want to jinx him. This question could be answered any of three ways, depending on whether you think of ""winning"" in terms of expected, present, or future value. So far, Dee has been the most productive player of the three-way trade; but he's also hitting like vintage Ichiro, which is probably not sustainable. If his BABIP comes back to Earth, his lack of power and walks craters his value, although he has been a mich better defender this year than he has shown in the past. Heaney is ... who knows. Young pitchers are lottery tickets. I think Howie is the best player of the three, but he hasn't fully shown what he can do this year; and if he walks the Dodgers traded Dee for two middling prospects.  ""Genius"" by the Dandy Warhols -- a song that is highly applicable to any baseball analysis I have to offer. ;-)"

Dodgers,3d1m81,prindskipperskipple,10,Sun Jul 12 19:55:47 2015 UTC,"I hope Joc has a great game so he can get some national attention over Kris Bryant and gain some more momentum to win the NL ROY.  If Joc can get his average to .260 and keep up that Gold Glove level defense, I think he'll win it."
Dodgers,3d1m81,joeinthebox,3,Mon Jul 13 02:31:23 2015 UTC,"I love Joc, so I hate to say this, but realistically it's going to be hard to beat Heston after that No-No. Hopefully Pederson gets his BA up in the second half of the season. Dude has a powerful swing and is an amazing defensive player."
Dodgers,3d1m81,djlivingproof,5,Mon Jul 13 08:43:34 2015 UTC,I can almost guarantee Heston wont  win it unless he has an really solid 2nd half.

Dodgers,3d1c6y,Pavel_Datsyuks_Cat,15,Sun Jul 12 18:37:45 2015 UTC,I'm expecting MadBum considering it's Bochy
Dodgers,3d1c6y,PAO_RT_IN_THE_KISSER,14,Sun Jul 12 18:55:56 2015 UTC,Bochy tried his hardest to keep him out but couldn't do it!
Dodgers,3d1c6y,PAO_RT_IN_THE_KISSER,9,Sun Jul 12 18:45:31 2015 UTC,I was just going to say this proves that it was not Bochy keeping him out since he could have picked pretty much anyone to replace Scherzer. That he picked Kershaw says he wants to win the damn thing since the Giants tend to need home field advantage at the World Series a lot these days.
Dodgers,3d1c6y,atducker,20,Sun Jul 12 20:06:45 2015 UTC,YOU CANNOT PREVENT THE KERSHAW FROM ALL STAR GAME.
Dodgers,3d1c6y,Pavel_Datsyuks_Cat,27,Sun Jul 12 18:36:25 2015 UTC,And now we can complain that he's not starting.  Unless Greinke starts.
Dodgers,3d1c6y,wasteplease,11,Sun Jul 12 18:36:56 2015 UTC,Grienke is going to start  or at least he better

Dodgers,3d1c6y,ToastedFireBomb,7,Sun Jul 12 22:34:30 2015 UTC,Surprised you?   Bochy is the manager.
Dodgers,3d1c6y,BloodyJourno,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:50:52 2015 UTC,Fucking every time... The bias and favoritism he shows is absolute horseshit.
Dodgers,3d1c6y,ToastedFireBomb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:56:40 2015 UTC,"Matheny did it with Carpenter, Bochy will probably do it with MadBum.  Kershaw's the greatest pitcher in baseball and he's never started an ASG."
Dodgers,3d1c6y,Dacryphile,5,Sun Jul 12 22:57:39 2015 UTC,"But like.... every year that Kershaw hasn't started the guy who did start was around the same level. A top 5 pitcher in the game. Madbum? I don't understand how he's so overrated. Bias aside, he's a good pitcher, but he doesn't even crack the top 15. He shouldn't even really be an all star in the first place, let alone start a game. If Scherz got the start over Greinke, that's one thing, he's a cy young contender. MadBum, meanwhile, is the third worst pitcher on his own team. It isn't even an option IMO."
Dodgers,3d1c6y,ToastedFireBomb,11,Sun Jul 12 23:56:15 2015 UTC,"Hey, now, you're an All Star get your game on, go play Hey, now, you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid"

Dodgers,3d2846,Musingmike,3,Mon Jul 13 00:45:56 2015 UTC,I really hope it's not Puig. Everybody wants to trade him off. But that would break my heart
Dodgers,3d2846,Lazy_Typin,3,Mon Jul 13 00:53:51 2015 UTC,We would never trade Puig.  I think Ethier might end up on the block.  His contract is good through 2017 so if the Dodgers pick up some of the cash he's owed he'll make a great bargaining chip.  I think Ethier plus a solid minor league bat (or Guerrero) would be something that the Reds might dig.
Dodgers,3d2846,raider02,2,Mon Jul 13 00:59:27 2015 UTC,"Reds are rebuilding, they don't want a shifty veteran contract.   The only way we move Ethier is to a team filling an immediate need (and we can absorb lots of contract)."

Dodgers,3d2846,norris528e,3,Mon Jul 13 02:22:54 2015 UTC,"Crawford and Beckett had terrible contracts, but it's not like they were bad for us. Beckett had the no-hitter and a 2.0 WAR over 35 starts, and Crawford has put up a 3.8 WAR over 236 games. Not good enough for their contracts, but good enough.  But I do agree with you that besides Punto Gonzalez was the centerpiece of the trade, and he's the one that's really made it worthwhile."

Dodgers,3cy7z1,TehLoneWanderer101,12,Sat Jul 11 22:18:40 2015 UTC,"They had visions of grandeur. They were expecting to be competing for the Division Lead, or at least a Wild Card spot. Now, they're fighting off the Rockies to avoid last place in the West."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,strategolegends,17,Sat Jul 11 22:47:44 2015 UTC,They built a .500 team and are super angry they're not winning .600  Poor Padres
Dodgers,3cy7z1,Devilrodent,9,Sat Jul 11 23:38:25 2015 UTC,The Padres would love to be a .500 right now.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,strategolegends,9,Sat Jul 11 23:41:50 2015 UTC,"I feel they would be if it wasn't such a competitive division. Essentially, it's the Dodgers, the Giants, and a few .500 teams, but it's not like they can all be .500. Especially when the Dodgers are lurking around to steal their wins"
Dodgers,3cy7z1,Devilrodent,7,Sun Jul 12 01:50:13 2015 UTC,I went to look at the padres record and noticed that the Dodgers have the biggest lead of any first place team in baseball. That's pretty cool.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,FBAguy13,12,Sun Jul 12 00:16:14 2015 UTC,Kind of sounds like maybe the team used him as a scapegoat for their own failings. I wouldn't say he's the perfect catcher. He probably should have had at least one of those wild pitches last night. But he's pretty good and has a better bat than AJ. Sometimes guys just need a new start.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,xray606,32,Sat Jul 11 23:40:43 2015 UTC,easily the most lopsided trade of the past year
Dodgers,3cy7z1,SomalianRoadBuilder,16,Sat Jul 11 21:53:26 2015 UTC,"I'll actually say the Dodgers got far more out of the Miami trade than from the Padres. For Dee, they basically got Kendrick from the Angels (via Heaney), kike, hatcher, and Barnes. That is a ton in return."

Dodgers,3cy7z1,UPSguy,14,Sat Jul 11 23:23:16 2015 UTC,"People will point to how injuries are unforeseen, but really sliding head first into first base is pretty dumb on a baseball level. It actually slows you down and makes you way more susceptible to injury."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,EnsignObvious,15,Sun Jul 12 00:17:13 2015 UTC,I hate seeing Gordon injured. I loved him as a Dodger and I want to see him succeed so hopefully he never does a head fort slide into 1st again because it can only hurt you not help you.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,PAO_RT_IN_THE_KISSER,7,Sun Jul 12 01:11:06 2015 UTC,It makes you harder to tag.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,Pearberr,2,Sun Jul 12 01:41:03 2015 UTC,No need to tag at 1st.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,psychotichorse,2,Sun Jul 12 08:23:03 2015 UTC,While they are professionals they do occasionally make bad throws.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,Pearberr,7,Sun Jul 12 08:51:01 2015 UTC,It slows you down but if the throw is pulling the first baseman off the bag it makes you harder to tag so it is NOT a bad decision for the runner.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,Pearberr,8,Sun Jul 12 01:40:39 2015 UTC,well the fielder wasn't trying to tag Dee so it was a bad decision for him
Dodgers,3cy7z1,RanByMyGun,3,Sun Jul 12 02:28:36 2015 UTC,"Well if that's the case then yes, it would be a terrible decision for him, haha."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,Pearberr,3,Sun Jul 12 02:32:43 2015 UTC,"Sure, but how often is a player tagged out at first?"
Dodgers,3cy7z1,jgilla2012,2,Sun Jul 12 02:28:57 2015 UTC,"Even if it happens once every ten games that's once every ten games when a runner should slide.   It happens more often than once every ten games, especially for speedy guys like Dee Gordon who force infielders to make tough plays on a regular basis."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,Pearberr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:32:21 2015 UTC,"Then you have to consider the risk factor of sliding headfirst into a bag, especially at first where lots of players congregate on plays. It's more beneficial to your team to get thrown out on a play than it is to dislocate your thumb and be out for weeks when you're putting up 3+ WAR in the first half."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,jgilla2012,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:15:28 2015 UTC,"My point is that on a single play it quite likely gives you a higher chance of being safe, there is no reason to continue debating."

Dodgers,3cy7z1,MicahsRedditAccount,10,Mon Jul 13 09:08:11 2015 UTC,"those two are the best trades of the past year. We got rid of a ton of money on Kemp's contract, opened a spot for Joc to start, and got one of the best young catchers in baseball, Joe Wieland, and half of the package we traded to Philly for Rollins."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,SomalianRoadBuilder,3,Sat Jul 11 23:25:39 2015 UTC,Yeah we had to dump a bunch of money in with Matt to get Yasmani. Flipping dee and an aging Haren for everyone was a masterpiece trade.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,DustyDGAF,6,Sun Jul 12 00:45:26 2015 UTC,"We gave them $32 million, but we got rid of Kemp's $107 million contract. Net gain of $75 million. The money factor is a huge POSITIVE in that trade. We got a young All-Star catcher, a starting spot for a young All-Star center fielder, Joe Wieland, half of the package we traded for Rollins, AND $75 million for a 31 year old outfielder with a negative WAR (and Federowicz LOL). If that's not the steal of the year I don't know what the fuck is."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,SomalianRoadBuilder,2,Sun Jul 12 03:30:45 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone here thought it was going to be THAT great of a trade.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,newprofile15,3,Sun Jul 12 18:21:53 2015 UTC,"I was a huge fan of both of these trades at the time, the only thing I didn't really expect was Kemp to be so horrible this year"
Dodgers,3cy7z1,SomalianRoadBuilder,3,Sun Jul 12 18:55:45 2015 UTC,"everything has gone right with those trades... Ethier has had a decent comeback year, Joc has been a revelation, Grandal has been great, Kemp has had a weak season."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,newprofile15,10,Sun Jul 12 19:17:05 2015 UTC,I'm having trouble understanding this article. Is it really implying that the Padres should throw more inside fastballs?
Dodgers,3cy7z1,aurabolt213,7,Sat Jul 11 23:07:22 2015 UTC,Yas was basically saying that if youre a hard thrower then you should go hard in early in the count and then go to the outside with junk to get the K. SD pitchers apparently just like to throw everything on the outside so they didn't want to party with him.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,DustyDGAF,2,Sun Jul 12 00:47:24 2015 UTC,"I think the point is that their stubbornness cost them a good player, since if Grandal had played better he might not have been traded."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,MRoad,4,Sun Jul 12 23:30:12 2015 UTC,"Happy for him. There is so many politics played by managers and between players. A lot of jealousy too, perhaps out of competition, which is welcomed but some players, mostly managers and coaches hold these grudges against people that can quickly put a team in a rut for multiple seasons.    The hardest part of a successful team and organization, is really the human aspect of it."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,tvfilm,-1,Sun Jul 12 01:53:51 2015 UTC,Kind of a ridiculous article if you ask me.   It's one of those moves that is great in hindsight. Kemp could be putting up late 2014 numbers right now for the padres and Grandal hitting 8th with a .220 BA and LA kicking itself.   EDIT: Everyone just downvotes but not a single response?
Dodgers,3cy7z1,FBAguy13,6,Sat Jul 11 21:57:36 2015 UTC,"No I agree man. You never know, Kemp could've batted .300 with 40 HRs and Yasmani .210 and 5. But the FO took a gamble based on some evidence they had and it turned out to be a good one."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,mpgiii,5,Sun Jul 12 00:09:08 2015 UTC,you can pretty much say that about any player though. every move is a gamble really.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,Giobenavides,7,Sun Jul 12 00:15:49 2015 UTC,"It ""could"", but nothing in the front office business is certain. You play the probabilities game. And it was more probably that the Dodgers would get more out of the deal than the Padres, and so far things have been playing to expectation."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,LikeAgaveF,-1,Sat Jul 11 23:19:51 2015 UTC,"It ""could"", but nothing in the front office business is certain.   That is my point. Don't write an article about how stupid a team is for making a trade when it could have gone a completely different way."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,FBAguy13,5,Sat Jul 11 23:37:13 2015 UTC,"the point though, is that probabilities pointed to the trade being a steal for the Dodgers. In that sense, it was stupid for the Padres."

Dodgers,3cy7z1,Giobenavides,2,Sat Jul 11 22:32:11 2015 UTC,"Because the article is written in a way like they knew all along this would happen but wait until now to write it?  If it was so obvious, where was the article from Calkins the day the trade went through to point out all of the upsides Grandal and how much he could have brought to the team?  I am can write articles about teams who ""blew it"" when making trades if you always let me write the article months after the trade happened."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,FBAguy13,4,Sat Jul 11 23:34:22 2015 UTC,"That's why the Dodger front office is so much better. Preller in San Diego saw an athletic defender with an MVP caliber bat. Friedman and the Brain Trust saw a player who's power numbers were quickly regressing and who's range had dropped significantly in the outfield (a sign that his hips are getting worse, which also affects his power numbers).  Preller saw a catcher with a slightly above average bat and an average arm. The Brain Trust saw a Top-3 catcher, with high peripheral stats in a park with depressed offensive numbers, and an average arm.  Sure, there was the chance that Kemp goes and has a great year. There is a chance Grandal entered a super slump, but it just wasn't likely, and our front office knew that."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,Pearberr,0,Sun Jul 12 01:46:59 2015 UTC,This is very true. Not sure why everyone's down voting you.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,jsand25,-16,Sat Jul 11 22:32:07 2015 UTC,"I'll respond. Grandal was young and had lots of upside. It isn't like he was a bad catcher. His defensive numbers were good. He just needed to work on his batting. Being in the Dodgers lineup has made things better for him than it ever could have in San Diego. Also, petco is a death trap for hitters.  As for kemp, he had a couple good years in LA and everyone jumped all over him. He is NOT one of the best hitters in the game. His strikeouts were always an issue and he was very streaky. He could be great when he was on fire, but there was great reason to believe that he would be in decline. His numbers in San Diego are worse than he would have in LA, but I am so glad they got rid of him. Plus, even if kemp starts hitting, the salary dump was worth it. Also, kemp is getting older. Grandal has years left to develop.  I called this as a good trade from the start. I was right all along as I usually am. This isn't some shot in the dark which just turned out. This was a great trade by people who knew what they were doing...for the dodgers anyway.  FYI, I'm not one of those who downvoted you although I disagree. I dont downvote reasonable discussion."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,Musingmike,16,Sat Jul 11 22:32:09 2015 UTC,I was right all along as I usually am.    I don't like you based on this sentence.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,Giobenavides,-18,Sat Jul 11 22:36:35 2015 UTC,I don't care. I stated a fact. I know baseball well as I can look at a player and tell how they will likely pan out.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,Musingmike,2,Sat Jul 11 22:40:40 2015 UTC,Its amazing someone hasn't hired you since you have the ability to know how a player will be just by looking at them.  That has to be worth something.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,john6547,2,Sat Jul 11 23:11:27 2015 UTC,I was going to say the same thing. We should let Friedman know about this guy.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,Giobenavides,-6,Sat Jul 11 23:46:08 2015 UTC,"I said I generally can. There is nothing wrong with that statement at all. I'm a big numbers guy and I used to play baseball which gives me the ""old school eye"" in addition to the stats analysis which is more of a modern way of analyzing players."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,Musingmike,2,Sun Jul 12 17:36:00 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing- no you can't.  You cannot tell a player's future just by looking at them as you claimed. Professionals watch dozens of games and pour over stats and it is still a crap shoot, and these are people with decades of experience sometimes. I find it hard to believe your psychic abilities are more accurate than that."
Dodgers,3cy7z1,john6547,5,Sun Jul 12 18:07:37 2015 UTC,Haha you edited your response three times.  nice.
Dodgers,3cy7z1,Giobenavides,-13,Sat Jul 11 22:44:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I sure did. I didn't wanna come off too harshly to your comment which added absolutely nothing to the debate."

Dodgers,3cy7z1,feedmecupcakes24,-3,Sun Jul 12 06:08:04 2015 UTC,"In one sentence, I simply stated I am pretty good at telling which players will pan out. Now everyone is jumping on some bash me fest for what? I have more than proven I am generally right about players over the years. Jeeeez. I never tried to come off as some asshole. I just love baseball and I think this was a great trade for the Dodgers from the get go and I called it as such even when many were criticizing it. That is my point. Don't you remember when people were freaking out over the trade?"
Dodgers,3cy7z1,Musingmike,3,Sun Jul 12 17:32:42 2015 UTC,I completely agree with everything you just said man. I just don't think even the best GMs can look at a player and predict how their careers will go all the time. There's way too many variables
Dodgers,3d0lgx,DodgersFann,5,Sun Jul 12 14:35:36 2015 UTC,Depending on where we are in August I could see us pulling him up. He has wow stuff and a big league demeanor. That type of young injection could be just what we need.
Dodgers,3d0lgx,mdh5083,3,Sun Jul 12 17:19:28 2015 UTC,"I agree, they've been saying he has no more projection left and MLB ready stuff for years. Can we afford to waste some of the best pitchers in our organization on AAA? Beachy going to get the job done? I don't know. We'll see."
Dodgers,3d0lgx,Musingmike,3,Sun Jul 12 17:35:36 2015 UTC,"Nope. Odds are far greater that zach Lee comes up and maybe has a role with the BP than Urias doing that. He hasn't even hit AAA yet, but will next year. Lee has been in AAA for awhile now and will be ready come September...not Urias. Lee had his shoddy 2014 which everyone freaked out about, but 2015, with the exception of his injury time, has been solid. I think he can keep that up and be a welcome addition in the pen. Urias could be in the pen next September though."
Dodgers,3d0lgx,nayrrrrr,5,Sun Jul 12 17:47:44 2015 UTC,"A top prospect skipping AAA isn't unheard of for the Dodgers and typically the good pitchers only end up there if they need to work on something. Kershaw never pitched in AAA. Not that I am saying Urias will be on the team this year and considering he is still only 18, odds are he won't be. Though not to continue to compare him to Kershaw, but Kershaw pitched 210 innings in the minors before he got his shot and Urias would be on track to reach that mark before September. I think he is probably closer than you think and if he finished this season strong, he could certainly be poised to compete for a rotation spot next spring."
Dodgers,3d0lgx,hopesfail,3,Mon Jul 13 01:21:43 2015 UTC,"I could see him getting a call up when rosters expand and maybe getting a few innings in low leverage situations, but nothing serious. The Dodgers aren't dying for pitching and can afford to let him develop on a relaxed timeline. Zach Lee is a far more likely candidate to get a call."
Dodgers,3d0lgx,kcxiv,2,Sun Jul 12 19:42:27 2015 UTC,"At what point is he not learning anything in AAA.  You can keep him down there i guess, but everything in that article pointed to him getting out there ""soon"" They said he already has big league commands of his fastball and all his pitchers are +.   sometimes people are just that damned gifted."

Dodgers,3d0lgx,AndrewNava,3,Sun Jul 12 16:48:59 2015 UTC,"haha, Eyelid surgery. The rest/surgery was planned by Friedman. It could have waited but they suggested he do it in season. I wrote on it here. http://sb.gg/Bor4"
Dodgers,3d0lgx,frakking-anustart,2,Sun Jul 12 17:22:49 2015 UTC,I agree with this.  He is at 38 IP this year thanks to missed time and I imagine they'll want to get him as many starts as it will take to get up to roughly 90-100 IP for the year.  It's doubtful that he'd be able to get that in working from the pen.   Think of the time he missed for the eye surgery as the innings he would have missed by shutting him down at the end of the season.

Don't know how comfortable you would feel not being familiar with the area, but I would suggest you take the route during the day so you can get familiar with the areas you'll be going through.  If you want to take an Uber home from the stadium, walk down the hill and get picked up by Douglas and Sunset. There are plenty of people that will be walking towards that area, so you'll feel ok if you are alone.

Dodgers,3czqv4,msc80451,9,Sun Jul 12 14:44:57 2015 UTC,It's probably easier to walk down the hill after the game and get picked up on one of the side streets.  Otherwise your poor driver will get stuck in traffic.

Dodgers,3cyk0y,jn2010,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:07:00 2015 UTC,"Vin says because it hit the ground first.  If it had bounced from the wall off of Ethier and over the wall, it would be a HR."
Dodgers,3cyk0y,daringescape,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:06:52 2015 UTC,I'm not disputing that it wasn't a home run.  But going out of play off of a defensive player should have advanced the runners.  A run should have scored and Braun should have been on 3rd.

He walked into the dugout slammed his helmet into the ground and out of frustration he threw both of them over.  Were you the guy in the blue, or the guy with the wife to his left?   Edit: Upon further inspection of the pic, you were the guy in the blue with the aisle seat. You're reaction was priceless when you realized what had landed next to you. (I could be wrong, but I believe you caught the first one and then the 2nd was thrown to the right a few rows up behind you.)"

I've been a Dodgers fan my whole life. Parents took me to my first game when I was 2 or 3, went to ~20-25 games a year with my father and grand father. I basically had no choice.

Unfortunately while the game stayed 0-0 till the 9th where we left to ""beat the traffic (friends dad wasnt too big on non-football sports and wanted to do nothing with that traffic after the game)"" and missed the walk off home run that shook the stadium while we walked on the outside, I ate my first dodger dog, saw and met so VERY passionate and awesome fans and had fun.  Even though I don't have a california hockey or football teams - The dodgers were my first pro sports game that I went to and had a blast doing so the end result: Dodger Fan.  Also that game really sold me on baseball as I matured. Earlier I couldnt watch baseball and now it seems so methodical that its second hand to throw a game on. Still deciding that...."

Dodgers,3cufl0,ernestreyes,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:34:59 2015 UTC,Did they wear grey for aways back in 1916? I'm not sure.
Dodgers,3cufl0,clarkbarniner,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:04:18 2015 UTC,"Are their uniforms grey in this picture? They look white to me. The Dodgers website says that their uniforms for that year where the same except for the greys being away and whites at home. Also, after some quick google searches of Ebbets field and its dimensions I'm pretty confident that this was not taken at Ebbets field."

Dodgers,3cv8sn,IndigoLaser,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:27:08 2015 UTC,I was looking at his numbers and they seem...okay.  Just not a lot of innings pitched to look at.   I am cautiously optimistic.
Dodgers,3cv8sn,Gravedigr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:57:28 2015 UTC,He's been decent. I'd say he is better than McCarthy whom a lot of people were excited about for some strange reason. His issue has been staying healthy...like Anderson.
Dodgers,3cvr70,biggestbroever,3,Sat Jul 11 04:31:46 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Kazmir or Chavez, plus Clippard, for prospects. Clippard would be huge to bolster the 'pen"
Dodgers,3cvr70,bryanplayspiano,3,Sat Jul 11 08:23:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed, we need a good bullpen arm as much as we need a starter. Clippard and Kazmir for Lee, Schebler and one other (maybe Cotten as suggested in the article) would be good by me."
Dodgers,3cvr70,NSFAnythingAtAll,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:16:47 2015 UTC,I'd be fine with a prospects package for Kazmir or Chavez.
Dodgers,3cvr70,Holy_Toast,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:18:05 2015 UTC,"Lol Austin Hedges is on the Padres, not the Dodgers. But yeah I think Kazmir would be a great four starter and we could probably get it done for something like Schebler and Cotton plus maybe one more ok prospect. I would try to get Jesse Hahn as well but he has a lot of team control left so idk if Beane would trade him."
Dodgers,3cvr70,SomalianRoadBuilder,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:06:42 2015 UTC,"In general I don't like this ""win now"" mode thing, as it seems pretty obvious from watching the Giants the past couple years that building a super team at the cost of long term assets is not as good as just being decently competitive enough year after year to give yourself plenty of chances to get hot at the right time and win it all. That being said, I think the article proposes some reasonable trade targets and potential traded prospects. Every trade hypothesis involving prospects I've ever seen regarding the Dodgers starts with Seager and/or Urias, and that clearly isn't going to happen, but it's also not necessary in my opinion to trade for an ace right now. They'll have their pick of FA pitchers after this season to replace Greinke if necessary, and until then this rotation needs shoring up, not another top or second tier pitcher."
Dodgers,3cvr70,Jacktheawesome,0,Sat Jul 11 06:57:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not huge on Chavez. I think the Dodgers should look into kazmir for the rotation and clippard for the BP, but Chavez would just be another mediocre arm and not worth it. Schebler is a great trade chip as the Dodgers are loaded with OF depth for the next few years although I would miss his potential. I could see trading Barnes and actually be less upset over losing him. I wonder what it would take to get kazmir and/or clippard though..."

Dodgers,3ct12s,Snaaaaaaaaaake,15,Fri Jul 10 17:16:19 2015 UTC,"I really hope the FO makes a real effort to sign him again. Throw enough money at him so he can't say no, he does  seem super happy to be here. Though, I do realize he really just wants a World Series ring and that will factor heavily into his decision."
Dodgers,3ct12s,Jloother,10,Fri Jul 10 15:48:36 2015 UTC,"I actually would argue he cares most about being paid (and winning and playing well obviously, those things go hand in hand for him). He's said he doesn't mind pitching for the worst team if they are paying him the most of anyone who offers. Luckily for us, Guggenheim's gonna make it rain for him (if they don't, they're insane)."
Dodgers,3ct12s,M0ralHazard,3,Fri Jul 10 15:53:52 2015 UTC,For sure. I hope they do make it rain for him. My confidence in the FO has been wavering as of late. But I'm probably just insane.
Dodgers,3ct12s,Jloother,11,Fri Jul 10 16:00:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think Guggenheim has a problem paying the guy. If anything, Friedman might not want to commit enough years to keep him. If some team offers him 7 years, I don't see the Dodgers topping that."
Dodgers,3ct12s,DatBuridansAss,3,Fri Jul 10 16:14:50 2015 UTC,"That may indeed be the sticking point. However, something less than 7 I'd probably be ok with. His game has and will continue to age well, and the guy is constantly looking at himself in a scouting framework to improve. I think Greinke 6 years from now won't be elite, but he'll probably still be good."
Dodgers,3ct12s,M0ralHazard,7,Fri Jul 10 16:25:26 2015 UTC,"I don't even care if he has a risk of aging poorly. I'm a fan and I want him on my team, whatever it takes. Probably why I'm not qualified to be a GM."
Dodgers,3ct12s,DatBuridansAss,2,Fri Jul 10 16:32:37 2015 UTC,"That's how you end up like the Angels, and even the Dodgers of old times. Paying a bunch of money to players who sit on your bench or are not even on your team."

Dodgers,3ct12s,Jloother,3,Fri Jul 10 16:47:17 2015 UTC,Same. He's the kind of guy I hope retires as a Dodger and transitions to a FO capacity. That would be awesome.
Dodgers,3ct12s,DatBuridansAss,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:48:47 2015 UTC,He definitely has the mind for it. Didn't he just build/buy a home in SoCal? I wonder if that would play into his decision to stick around.
Dodgers,3ct12s,Jloother,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:55:52 2015 UTC,Perhaps. I know his primary residence is Florida. But he sure as hell can afford a second home in SoCal so it's possible.

He is massively valuable, and the Dodgers should not trade him lightly. Not only is he an incredible talent, but he comes with one of the best contracts in baseball.   The only way I'd consider trading him away is for a young, high-value starting pitcher like Noah Syndergaard for the Mets (Who actually has 2 extra years of team control than Puig has).  All the people wanting to trade him for Cueto are idiots. Hamels is a little better, but that's a big contract. I know it's not as big of a concern for the Dodgers but why trade a zero-risk player in our control for 4 years for a high-risk player who we'd have control for 3 years?"
Dodgers,3cufnx,Pearberr,7,Fri Jul 10 22:30:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know why the people here are so against trading Puig.

I hope the Front Office does their homework (they are the experts at projections), but if they made a trade along those lines I would neither be upset nor would I be totally floored. Remember...  Syndergaard is a massively valuable incredible talent who comes with one of the best contracts in baseball. That's why a trade isn't unreasonable."

Upton's best season was 2011 when he posted a 141 wRC+  Puig's career wRC+ is 149, and Upton is significantly worse on defense. And 3 years older.

The Dodgers have Joc, Ethier, Crawford, SVS & Prospects like Scott Schlebler and Alex Verdugo who are all capable outfielders. Syndergaard helps us fill a need today while downgrading, not eliminating our strength in the outfield.  I'm not saying it will or should happen, that's the Front Office's job. All I'm trying to say is that Puig isn't completely untouchable. He's a massively valuable chip, and trading him away wouldn't be done lightly, but he is not and should not be untouchable."
Dodgers,3cufnx,Pearberr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:27:26 2015 UTC,"Those guys aren't highly rated and prospects are never sure things.   That means you would likely be trusting 2 of SVS, Ethier and Crawford to be in a starting role going years into the future. I mean I like SVS but he certainly has some major flaws that will prevent him from being anything more than average. Ethier is gonna be a shell of his former self soon enough due to natural decline and Crawford can't stay healthy. We need Puig to anchor our Outfield along with Pederson. Having 2 old/injury prone/slow guys in our outfield will hurt us in the long road.   Puig shouldn't be traded unless we are robbing the other team blind."
Dodgers,3cufnx,Im_Daydrunk,0,Fri Jul 10 23:39:02 2015 UTC,"Yup, you have to trust somebody. SVS is a solid major league starter. Crawford & Ethier are terrible contracts but that's not changing no matter what else happens. With this trade the space is opened up for Ethier to take a shot at redeeming himself and some of that value.   This also opens up the ability to platoon Right Field, Joc has secured center and SVS is doing fine in Left.   Oh and it gets us one of the most valuable contracts in the league with an immensely talented starting pitcher for years to come, two extra years in fact than we'd get from Puig."
Dodgers,3cufnx,Pearberr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:53:20 2015 UTC,Having an great player and two average to below average players starting around him isn't the ideal outfield for a serious contender. All the top contenders have top level outfields with good defense and getting rid of Puig would sap us of that. We would bascially have to hope our infield becomes the best in the majors or else we won't be going as far.

I'd say the 3B line either bottom level a few rows up or else this tier is the best group of seats in the stadium. I had the chance to get free tickets and sit behind home plate recently and trade in these seats, but i declined.  Sadly, the Dodgers lost to the Giants in that game though.

Dodgers,3cryf8,theburninator69,5,Fri Jul 10 10:10:58 2015 UTC,"But no to be more specific, great start to the year followed by a long period of .500 ball which I hope we're starting to come out of around now. Dodgers have been in first basically all season, but with the Giants hanging around within 1-3 games back the whole time. Just recently the Giants have plummeted so we have a juicy 5.5 game lead at the moment. We have a good mix of offense, defense, and pitching. The pitching is a bit of a surprise, our #3-5 starters are pretty much nobodies who have ended up performing quite well. The offense is top tier but flakey as a motherfucker. Too many games scoring 0-2 runs. Joc's looking like a stud, Greinke's a god, Kershaw is being Kershaw, Rollins sucks dick but may be coming out of the slump, and Puig has been injured a lot"
Dodgers,3cryf8,theburninator69,2,Fri Jul 10 10:16:05 2015 UTC,"Hmmm on fire to start, offense has slowed but seems to be picking up lately. 2/5 of our pitching rotation are out for the year, Kershaw (according to the national media is having a down year) despite the fact that his numbers other than wins are better than just about any other pitcher. Greinke has the lowest ERA and has been our most consistent pitcher which is amazing considering we have Kershaw. Joc the rookie looks good, Grandal has been great as the new starting catcher. A book is coming out that claims all the players hate Puig and yet can't deny the fact he's a top 5 talent. Donnie still making some puzzling decisions, Vin Scully still is the best and most importantly we lead the NL West.  Go Blue."

I know they say this also applies to the accounts and description of the game, but that would mean every Instagram photo, personal picture, photograph of a historic moment taken by a fan (such as a home run milestone) Facebook post or tweet would be breaking this disclaimer. I say someone starts an indie gogo campaign to get you lawyered up. Don't let the big guy push you around.   Abner Doubleday didn't create this game for bullshit like this.

Dodgers,3cpg3x,DodgersFann,10,Thu Jul 9 18:45:47 2015 UTC,"That was REALLY well written, great job! You made some excellent points and convincing arguments for sure. Obviously as a Giants fan I'll back Bumgarner all day everyday- he's our (only) Ace right now and that comes with inflated expectations, expectations created by previous heroic and stellar performances.   But if Bumgarner is going to be carried through a good/mediocre first half of the season predicated on results not solely from this year, it's only fair that Kershaw should be given that same respect. Kershaw seems to have begun to right the ship while the last image I have of MadBum pitching is giving up 3 runs to the Nats on five pitches.   I get that the All Star Game is like a high school homecoming dance, it's a popularity contest. But you're absolutely right that it's broken when Cueto & Kershaw have to have last minute campaigns put on to get them in. It's broken. I won't put it all on Bochy but rather the idiotic and confusing way the All Star Voting has been twisted into. I can't say that I would remove Bumgarner from the ASG in favor of Kershaw if I had that power, I'm a Giants fan. But if I did have that power it would definitely be used to make Clayton Kershaw an All Star."
Dodgers,3cpg3x,Ficadin,3,Thu Jul 9 22:46:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response. To tell you the truth, I don't see it as Kershaw VS anyone in particular. My focus was more geared towards those who focus on only one or a few stats and see Clayton as struggling. I think wins are only a small piece of the overall pie and leading the league in K's as more indicative of his true position. It seems like I have intelligent baseball conversations with most Giants fans. I'd keep Madison on the team over Burnett and Wacha if it were my choice."
Dodgers,3cpg3x,Ficadin,3,Fri Jul 10 00:03:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I don't remember the exact start he had, but ESPN and everyone else were definitely doing some scorched earth reporting about Kershaw taking a bit to get his first win. Plus you factor in games he might've gotten little to no run support (something a Giants fan knows all about). Bottom line- he should be there. Cheers to civil, intelligent baseball conversations- at least until October."
Dodgers,3cpg3x,nenright,4,Fri Jul 10 00:21:04 2015 UTC,"the funny thing is that there wasn't even anything wrong with kershaw. in fact if you look at stats like xFIP, K/9, WAR, you'd see he's having a damn good year. the only reason his ERA is so high is because of a BABIP thats 30 points higher than his career number, and a HR/FB rate thats double his career number. I have no doubt that if you reduced those numbers to his career averages, he'd have a sub-2.0 ERA for the fourth straight year(sucks that luck might ruin that for him). And i know that we can't do that, obviously, but still, if you look at basically any measurable stat other than ERA and win-loss, he's still having a great year."
Dodgers,3cpg3x,smcdowell26,2,Thu Jul 9 23:15:55 2015 UTC,"HR/FB   I cut my mention of his HR/FB out because it was way too long. Good catch on the BABIP, I haven't even looked at his BABIP lately. I didn't want to say it in my post but it's likely that Kershaw makes it when Max or someone else can't pitch on short rest. I'm pretty sure Bochy is thinking something similar. Especially after last nights shutout."

Then, of course, there is his win-loss record, 6-6 after Wednesday's game, which we're just supposed to discard because sometimes pitchers pick up cheap wins or underserved losses. And because, you know, the sabermetric people told us we should do so.  But to put absolutely no value on the win-loss record for a starting pitcher is going too far. It's not as if there's no correlation between a starting pitcher's performance and who wins and loses.  Certainly there are pitchers who run into unseemly stretches in which they are offered precious little offensive support. Although the Dodgers have been something less than a run-scoring machine in support of Kershaw this year, he is getting 3.72 runs per start after Wednesday's game.  That ties him for 28th in the National League, and is higher than All-Stars Jacob deGrom (3.71), Zack Greinke (3.71) and Max Scherzer (3.53). And they all have winning records.  It's also more run support than Johnny Cueto has received (3.50), and if any pitcher should be complaining he was left off the All-Star team, it's Cueto.  Cueto has a better ERA (2.61), WHIP (0.87), opponent batting average (.190) and opponent on-base (.236) than Kershaw. About the only place Kershaw has been clearly superior is in strikeouts. Both have given up more home runs — 11 after Wednesday's game — than one would like.  Now Cueto and Kershaw have been dumped in that final vote silliness, in which the fans vote for one of five candidates for the last spot on the All-Star team. And really, if it comes down to the two of them, it should be Cueto.  Kershaw has swell numbers, just not ones that scream, “He just has to be an All-Star!” It's no insult to be an All-Star runner-up.  Don't misunderstand, it isn't as if Kershaw's performance is stinking up the joint. It isn't as if anyone wants to move him to shortstop. He's having a very good season and, who knows, by the time it's all over he may have lifted himself back into the Cy Young conversation.  But he wouldn't be in it now, any more than his first-half performance demands he be an All-Star.  That guy who wrote the commentary next to mine needs to drop his little blue-and-white pompoms and stop looking like some hometown hack.  There's no whining in baseball."""

Dodgers,3cpvwb,nenright,7,Thu Jul 9 21:45:12 2015 UTC,I'd like him to compare Kershaw to MadBum.  Either Kersh or Cueto should be in there before Bochy's homerism pick.
Dodgers,3cpvwb,Dacryphile,3,Thu Jul 9 22:42:36 2015 UTC,"i'm looking at fangraphs right now, and the only important stat in which bumgarner is better than kershaw is in walk rate, where kershaw is giving up about 1 more walk every 40 or so innings. and the only reason kershaw's ERA is so high is because of a ridiculously high BABIP and HR/FB rate. hilarious that kershaw is getting so unlucky and STILL is having a far better season than bumgarner.  EDIT: rephrasing"
Dodgers,3cpvwb,nenright,15,Thu Jul 9 23:01:09 2015 UTC,This writer Steve Dilbeck is the biggest fuck of a writer I have seen next to Bill Plashcke. He has done nothing but berate the new front office for the Dodgers since the offseason moves and hate on the team the entire year and throws everyone under the bus any chance he gets. He probably should go write for the Giants at this point.

Dodgers,3csbpd,I_DONT_SLEEP_ENOUGH,3,Fri Jul 10 11:09:48 2015 UTC,"I've heard that they're going to shuffle the rotation at the start of the second half, separate Kershaw and Greinke so the bullpen can get more regular rest after the other three starters. Of course, it still remains to be seen who will take Frias' spot long term, because I can't imagine they'll want to do a bullpen start every fifth day either.   My guess is that Kershaw will start the first game back, on the 17th. That means Greinke will probably not be on the 18th, maybe that will be Bolsinger. Greinke on the 19th, and Anderson on the 20th would make sense to me.   Please note: these are complete guesses, I'd even bet that FO and Mattingly don't know for sure after Kershaw right now.   TL;DR - possibly Bolsinger on 7/18 and Greinke on 7/19, but not sure."

STOP with this stupid narrative!    Why Kershaw should be in the all-star game:     Kershaw is an all-star caliber pitcher. Saying he shouldn't go is saying it's ok that Bumgarner is there. Fuck that.  Kershaw is competitive. He wants to strikeout some suckers in the AL and give the NL the best chance to win. Regardless of whether he gets in, he's going to be hungry to prove himself the rest of the season.    Kershaw has plenty of time with his family. I know the season is long and it's probably tough to get days away, but he only plays 1 every 5 games... He'll have time during the all-star break to get away.   Kershaw is family.

But now I just set mortar tubes in my hair,  'Til I’m roughly the temp of the suuuuuuuuuuuuun!”  No one’s dead like Gaston, skins all red like Gaston,  No one blows off their own fucking head like Gaston  “I use Black Cats in all my decapitating!”  My, what a guuuuuuuy…GASTOOOOOOOOON!!!!  ────────  May be too soon, but I worked hard on this."

Dodgers,3ck6qw,theblakeshow32,16,Thu Jul 9 18:14:12 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that not getting voted in will piss Kersh off so much that after the all star break he pitches nothing but perfect games.
Dodgers,3ck6qw,macwelsh007,3,Wed Jul 8 17:45:58 2015 UTC,"He could pitch nothing but perfect games the entire rest of the season, the entire playoffs, the entire next season up to the ASG and MLB would create some rule so Mattingly can't be the ASG manager and his replacement wouldn't have Kershaw start.   Dude gets robbed every ASG."
Dodgers,3ck6qw,poppymelt,3,Thu Jul 9 01:10:42 2015 UTC,Inside track has madbum starting ASG thru 2020
Dodgers,3ck6qw,dukenuk12,14,Thu Jul 9 04:21:54 2015 UTC,Doesn't help that Cueto pitched that CG shutout last night...
Dodgers,3ck6qw,vinegarstrokess,4,Wed Jul 8 15:55:25 2015 UTC,and he did that wiggle... i had to give him a few votes for the wiggle.
Dodgers,3ck6qw,bauermundo,7,Wed Jul 8 20:23:39 2015 UTC,I voted for him like 50 times last night. We can do this.
Dodgers,3ck6qw,TheOctagon24,19,Wed Jul 8 16:10:36 2015 UTC,I voted for him like 40 times the other night. It hurts to see him so low.....
Dodgers,3ck6qw,Im_Daydrunk,12,Wed Jul 8 15:45:37 2015 UTC,And #VoteDozier on the AL side. He should have been named in the first place and there are already too many Royals on that team.

Dodgers,3ck6qw,roroskis,15,Wed Jul 8 21:12:41 2015 UTC,I'd rather Kershaw get the extra rest. Keep him fresh for us.
Dodgers,3ck6qw,cherokeesix,10,Wed Jul 8 17:34:51 2015 UTC,Let him rest and give him a reason to pitch angry in the second half
Dodgers,3ck6qw,IHeartBurpees,5,Wed Jul 8 19:19:54 2015 UTC,"The rest part makes sense, the pitch angry part is just a cliche in my opinion."
Dodgers,3ck6qw,DodgerDoan,12,Wed Jul 8 20:57:54 2015 UTC,I just voted for Kershaw like 100 times. Let's fucking do this.
Dodgers,3ck6qw,SoManySwags,5,Wed Jul 8 15:55:30 2015 UTC,we have to bring him up
Dodgers,3ck6qw,JusAnotherBeaner,3,Wed Jul 8 19:37:48 2015 UTC,Is the text method unlimited too?
Dodgers,3ck6qw,rachelebelle,8,Wed Jul 8 17:54:04 2015 UTC,Why do they even allow unlimited votes? They've got to find a better way to do this.
Dodgers,3ck6qw,delslow,3,Wed Jul 8 17:59:05 2015 UTC,Not voting for him because a week off is a hell of a lot better for him than to pitch in this game.
Dodgers,3ck6qw,Ge0Po,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:50:23 2015 UTC,if kershaw gets snubbed we'll just make our own all star game with blackjack and hookers!

Dodgers,3ck6qw,dodgerhamster,-5,Wed Jul 8 16:46:55 2015 UTC,Cuss Cueto is not having a better year than kershaw statistically?  Ok..
Dodgers,3ck6qw,Bawfuls,4,Wed Jul 8 17:20:16 2015 UTC,You could argue it; his FIP and xFIP are worse than Kershaw's
Dodgers,3ck6qw,Mednebmedic,3,Wed Jul 8 17:41:30 2015 UTC,Apparently you can't  have an opinion...
Dodgers,3ck6qw,mattsergent,3,Wed Jul 8 18:27:27 2015 UTC,"I'd rather Kersh than Cueto any day, but I agree the downvotes are ridiculous"
Dodgers,3ck6qw,Viperking5,-3,Wed Jul 8 19:42:32 2015 UTC,"We need to be real, as much as we love Kershaw, does he deserve the ASG this season. He hasn't performed up to expectations this year and Greinke looks to be our ace this year. Don't get me wrong Kershaw is my favorite player, he's the first jersey I ever bought, but I just don't think this is his year. If he wasn't MVP last year no one would be even looking at him.   I feel he shouldn't go to the ASG and rest so hopefully he can come back the second half a beast like he was before. He's really in a slump this year and he shouldn't put the stress of the ASG on his shoulders, considering now the ASG means something, WS home field advantage."
Dodgers,3ck6qw,kcxiv,4,Wed Jul 8 22:47:37 2015 UTC,same with Bumgarner.. nobody would look at him if it weren't for last October.  Plus the ASG is not completely based on this season's stats.

Maybe we as a fanbase should stop giving him accolades and have him realize that EVERYTHING IS EARNED, NOTHING IS GIVEN      And have him lead us to a World Series. Deal?"
Dodgers,3clzcf,dodgerhamster,2,Thu Jul 9 04:27:15 2015 UTC,Have you tried taco bell bro
Dodgers,3clzcf,leftylogan,3,Thu Jul 9 04:28:59 2015 UTC,"He's tried. Mattingly, the bullpen, and the offense haven't always helped him"

Dodgers,3clzcf,ShakeNBakey,2,Thu Jul 9 04:23:34 2015 UTC,Spamming this final vote reminds me of a few years ago for the All Star Game at Chase where Ethier was the final vote :')

Dodgers,3clzcf,bryanplayspiano,4,Thu Jul 9 04:26:14 2015 UTC,"Guys, I'm really sorry. Did not smoke rally banana hookah last night. Went to a casino and put money on the Dodgers to win, and then got HAMMERED and realized I had missed almost the entire game. ...and we lost.  Lesson learned.  Tonight, the hookah is in full force once again, and here we are, up 5-0 in the seventh inning stretch.  Kersh is an all-star, and tonight (once again) proves it, and it's up to us to vote him there, since Bochy is an asshat. I'm going to vote for him 10 times for each of his 10 strikeouts tonight, and I challenge you to do the same. Then go vote for him all day tomorrow too. And every day until the voting is over."

Dodgers,3clzcf,MystAJ,2,Thu Jul 9 04:21:02 2015 UTC,that's the same thinking that looks at home runs as rally-killers
Dodgers,3clzcf,Quesly,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:25:45 2015 UTC,Home runs are good because they win games. All star games don't help the dodgers win games... at all.
