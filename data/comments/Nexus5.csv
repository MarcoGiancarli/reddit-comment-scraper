It doesn't mean it's crumbling before your eyes.  EDIT: Missed the part where you dropped it. You can try to RMA if you have warranty, but because it was caused by a drop, it probably won't cover it. If you're daring, you can buy the housing and replace it, but that would require you to be able to transplant the screen (not an easy task).

Nexus5,3dzits,AN649HD,16,Mon Jul 20 21:27:24 2015 UTC,"It's a very common occurrence in my experience, I've had it happen on two different devices with a range of batteries.  A significant power draw makes your phone report a lower battery level than it has, as the draw then normalises your phone reports gradually more correct data which manifests in the graph as battery capacity going up. Why it happens I've no idea, what I can tell you is it's very minor on my N5 and mostly when reaching the sub-20's, and on my old Galaxy S the shittier quality battery I had the worse it'd be, one battery was so bad if the screen was on for an hour it'd be at under 50% then shoot up to 80%."
Nexus5,3dzits,ShacloneMan91,8,Tue Jul 21 00:33:41 2015 UTC,"It has to do with how batteries operate, I see the same behavior and I have the stock battery. When you are doing something power intensive on your phone (watching video, playing games, etc.), the battery has to supply more current which causes the battery voltage to ""droop."" Once the high power activity is over the current will drop which allows the cell chemistry to stabilize and the voltage will rise slightly. Since your phone uses the cell voltage to monitor state of charge it will appear that the battery is charging on its own."

Nexus5,3e0aq7,dankrusz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:54:57 2015 UTC,"This happened to me a couple of days ago, actually...rebooting the phone fixed it."
Nexus5,3e0ras,flamingspartan3,3,Tue Jul 21 01:55:12 2015 UTC,"That's normal. The phone limits itself to charge at a maximum rate of ~1A if I'm not mistaken, and it's by design. Electronical devices only draw as much current as they need, so even if it was a 2A USB charger, the Nexus 5 will still charge at about 1A. This is by design, and is the limit set by whoever engineered the phone.  Volts on the other hand is different. You will find all USB chargers more or less give 5V (some 5.1V for example). Whatever voltage the source outputs is what the device will have to receive. Give your phone's charger port a nice 6V 1A amount of power and it'll most likely fry a component."
Nexus5,3e0ras,Skeptikel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:11:49 2015 UTC,"With a Samsung 2A charger, I charge at around 1200-1400 mA. Not counting the idle state usage.  And I have seen people charge faster with the blade, over at XDA.."
Nexus5,3e0ras,Wall-SWE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:35:11 2015 UTC,"In the past with Samsung chargers, I've gotten 1.6 amps of speed. I assumed that the blade would do this speed as well; that's the entire reason I bought the charger. The Nexus 5 is capable of 1.8 amps but accounting for 200 mA of idle drain, this would show up in Ampere as 1.6 amps."
Nexus5,3e0ras,raxiel_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:54:35 2015 UTC,"I've gotten +1.6A with Ampere using a 2A 'Hudl 2' charger (A tablet sold by Tesco, a big grocery retailer in the UK) and an almost flat battery, faster than any other 2A charger I've used.  I was getting 3-400mA drain unplugged which would suggest it was pulling the full 2A, but it's also possible the drain dropped once I set the phone down and let Ampere do it's measurement."
Nexus5,3e0ras,zleuth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:32:08 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the Nexus 5 tops out at 1.8 A so any idle drain would be subtracted from that. My Samsung 2 A charger used to also get 1.5-1.6 A but now I only get ~1 A.
Nexus5,3e0ras,svx3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:17 2015 UTC,"Precisely the same thing happened to me, exactly the same readings via Ampere. I'd love an explanation as well."
Nexus5,3e0ras,Vigasaurus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:48:23 2015 UTC,"That's honestly pretty good. I've tried many many different charger combos, different adapters, different cords and they all all pretty much charge at 600-800 ma. Even the stock nexus charger barely gets me around 700 ma. I currently use an iPhone charger with some random Motorola cable I had. That gives me around 1010 ma, it charges quite fast. I use battery widget reborn and it says charging speeds are at 1 minute to 1 minute 20 seconds per 1%."
Nexus5,3e0ras,nullstring,2,Tue Jul 21 07:27:26 2015 UTC,Yes but the phone is capable of 1.6 Amps of net charging speed; there are prior posts on Reddit of this charger being capable of that. I've even gotten these speeds in the past with Samsung chargers but no longer do. I feel it might me a software issue.
Nexus5,3e0ras,BitingChaos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:56:11 2015 UTC,"Well, you are losing charge in the wire, and you will lose even more if the phone and port are old."
Nexus5,3e0ras,ZeOppositeOfProgress,2,Tue Jul 21 12:59:31 2015 UTC,No but this is the speed that the phone receives; please see the XDA link I posted in the main thread. It clearly shows 1.6 Amps of charging speed being received by the phone.

Nexus5,3dy383,andreiknox,18,Mon Jul 20 14:03:12 2015 UTC,If it just says optimizing apps that is likely because your cache got cleared. No update. But clearing cache can potentially increase battery for a bit.
Nexus5,3dy383,DoesntPostAThing,6,Mon Jul 20 15:03:26 2015 UTC,How did the cache get cleared? Why?
Nexus5,3dy383,JeremyNT,18,Mon Jul 20 15:14:13 2015 UTC,"I've observed this behavior after hard lockups or ""random"" reboots due to heat etc.  My guess is that on the next boot the system assumes the cache was left in an inconsistent state and just nukes it from orbit. That's the only way to be sure."
Nexus5,3dy383,bakgwailo,2,Mon Jul 20 15:45:29 2015 UTC,"There is a bug in the 5.x line that causes the N5 to randomly reboot, and it also appears to clear the cache and have to rebuild it."

Nexus5,3dy383,myownlittleta,0,Tue Jul 21 07:16:29 2015 UTC,Its a known bug for the N5 on 5.x.
Nexus5,3dy383,jazavchar,4,Mon Jul 20 21:34:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is still the case, but it used to be that just after an app ""installation"" (""optimizing..."" counts as installation), an app won't start at boot if you haven't launched the app at least once (technical details - basically BOOT_COMPLETED doesn't fire until you run the app).  So you might actually just be running with many of your start-at-boot apps no longer running in the background.  Also means you'll need to pay attention to what you're running, because you'll probably eventually re-activate whatever app was sucking your battery...."
Nexus5,3dy383,myownlittleta,-7,Mon Jul 20 17:28:46 2015 UTC,"Placebo at work. You ""feel"" your battery is better when in reality it's just your mind. And besides, I've day is not enough to judge battery usage"
Nexus5,3dy383,Ketturen,4,Mon Jul 20 16:12:36 2015 UTC,"Nah man, far from it, I've watched the data: for a few weeks up until Sunday it's been 6-8 hours per charge, tops. Yesterday I lasted from 2PM until 12AM and still had 30% left - all with the same usage level. Today, again, charge lasted way longer."
Nexus5,3dy383,jazavchar,2,Mon Jul 20 16:17:21 2015 UTC,My battery lasts significantly shorter after upgrading to 5.1.1. I can tell because my habits did not change and I cannot start the day with a full charge and make it to bedtime. It used to be my routine and it has not happened once since updating about a month ago. That's no placebo and I actually make a conscious effort to use my phone less if I'm nowhere near my charger.  There is no reason for the reverse not to happen. That's very dismissive to say.

I do have a few friends with Nexus 4's still though and they've never had any issues. I will say I think the Nexus 5 has a lot of issues though. I got my first one replaced by Google when it was a little bit out of warranty for GPS issues. About a month ago my WiFi stopped working for the most part, GPS occasionally drops, and Qi charging stopped working... I haven't been rough on my phone or anything I don't think, outside it still looks brand new. Just the build quality of the internal connections seems to not be up to par, every problem I have I'm sure is just loose connections internally.  That said I still loved my time with this phone and 2 years is an acceptable life I think... I'm still planning on buying a ""2015 Nexus 5"" if they release one. Either that or hold out as long as I can until another phone comes out with USB Type-C. As an iPhone convert (iPhone 5 to Nexus 4), I really loved the lightning cable and I really hate micro USB, I've had multiple cables break and I can never plug it in the right way. My next phone having USB Type-C is one of my biggest priorities actually, as silly as that may sound to some people, and I'm pretty sure Google will put it on the new Nexus line."

Nexus5,3dtwvi,cnliberal,2,Sun Jul 19 14:04:08 2015 UTC,As other comments a over may be a battery issue.   I ordered a new battery and going to install it and see if that helps.   It's about 13$ on eBay
Nexus5,3dtwvi,hiToriKelly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:38:04 2015 UTC,"This is happening to me too.  It seems to happen with taking videos, and recently, with taking pictures.  The odd thing is that this only started happening when I bought a ""new"" battery for my phone."
Nexus5,3dtwvi,cnliberal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:59:29 2015 UTC,I wonder if you ended up with a bad battery?  Or is the root of the problem really software instead of hardware
Nexus5,3dtwvi,oh_no_aliens,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:53:23 2015 UTC,"exact thing happened to me when i swapped out the old battery for a new one.   unplug the battery, straighten out the ribbon (cable/connector), and bend it gently and put/connect it back in. It solved the problem for me."
Nexus5,3dtwvi,oh_no_aliens,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:58:17 2015 UTC,I'll give that a try.  The ribbon cable seems quite stiff.

Nexus5,3dwgmd,PascLeRasc,4,Mon Jul 20 02:42:43 2015 UTC,"I think we've reached a certain point where current processors aren't much faster compared to the Nexus 5 (unless someone is able to create some next-level stuff), so I'm pretty confident it will last another 2 years or so, minus the official support of Google (but you never know).  I definitely suggest you get it if you aren't worried about software upgrades, but even then, the custom ROM scene is very active and will probably keep it going for a couple more years."
Nexus5,3dwgmd,CluelessMuffin,-1,Mon Jul 20 03:09:24 2015 UTC,"Well I really like nexus devices, stock feel and best Android . Also it always comes with best android experience and hardware. But If @ralphodog is right 150 box is very good price for lg g2, I'd suggest you to buy it, 100$ extra cash is perfect money. But according to my friends lg g2 (which I was obsessed with nexus 5 then, I was trying to make him to buy Nexus 5 either.) G2 has way different Android experience. It is almost has same hardware (unless battery, battery is %30 better, camera has 2 times more pixels but I think nexus 5 has far better camera)  Shortly, Lg g2 feels like a old car with v10 machine (may have some problems ) and runs slower under easy apps. Nexus 5 feels like v8 Porsche (idk if there is v8 Porsche :D) because it fast as much as g2 but it moves quicker."
Nexus5,3dwgmd,ManYouLookingFor,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:52:41 2015 UTC,Why not? If u are okay with 1.5 to 2.5 hours of SOT when other flagships can provide twice of that.  I am still sticking with N5 due to amazing dev support. Easy root toolkits for N5... Exposed working... Gravity Box.. And the geeky community.  Though I am looking forward to a Note5 or Z5 for that battery life. Kinda tired to charge it frequently.
Nexus5,3dwgmd,mystrilreddit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:57:26 2015 UTC,Just because YOU get 1.5 to 2.5 hours SOT doesn't mean everyone does. I easily get 4-5 hours of SOT so your poor battery life is something on your end.
Nexus5,3dwgmd,flamingspartan3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:47:33 2015 UTC,I'm curious what kind of things you're doing if you get 4-5 hours of SoT.  I've been getting pretty poor battery life on 5.1.1 before I updated to the M preview 2.
Nexus5,3dwgmd,cynical_bohunk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:25:43 2015 UTC,I mostly do browsing on Chrome and occasional YouTube videos. Stream music throughout the day but using GPS/Navigation in the car drains the battery heavily.

Nexus5,3dtp4a,robotsongs,2,Sun Jul 19 16:21:13 2015 UTC,"I haven't noticed any issues with the Nexus other than the standard abysmal battery life; as with any battery, it'll reach its EoL and especially so if it's always being charged. The only reason I replaced my N5 was due to dropping the screen - being a general idiot with its safety.   It's the (was?) the best bang for your buck."
Nexus5,3dtp4a,Devian50,5,Sun Jul 19 11:32:42 2015 UTC,especially so if it's always being charged   You're thinking NiCad here. Lithium Ion/Polymer batteries do better if you keep them charged. Look it up.
Nexus5,3dtp4a,IAmYouAYA,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:05:30 2015 UTC,Yep/Nope. (Depending if I'm misunderstanding your message) Li batteries prefer 80 - 40 - 80 style. Keeping it nearly topped off isn't healthy either.

If it's not that great or the price isn't right I'll be sticking to this one until it finally crashes into the ground. This place has kind of gone past the hype of the phone because of how old it is, but the phone is still a great device. Not 100% perfect, but still great.

I can't really complain though as the service from Google was amazing both times. The first one I called in on Boxing day when the speaker stopped working, and had a brand new replacement delivered on the 28th.

Also, my boot time is about two minutes, so it's really annoying. I've learned to perform a hard reboot every time I notice any slowdown, because I lose too much time otherwise. It really sucks when it happens when I'm doing something time-sensitive, like trying to enter my destination address for a Lyft ride (I've noticed that opening an app that uses the Maps API has about a 75% chance of triggering this) or answering a phone call.

After a lot of use, it wears down and sometimes gets stuck.  This can be temporarily fixed by flicking your fingernail against the back where the power button is. Try different strategies. If it boots up, back up all your data and RMA it. If it's out of warranty, you can send it to sites such as iFixit.

Nexus5,3dp9ve,Wall-SWE,0,Sat Jul 18 05:21:54 2015 UTC,I was thinking of slim porting but it means I need to get an slim port adapter and a controller board for the display. If I can't find another way that is probably my only option. Unfortunately that means spending upwards of 50 dollars and then I might as well just replace the screen.

But comparing to G2, it's worse. I usually get more than 3hours of SOT, but sometimes wakelock happens overnight and it drains my battery a lot, sometimes by 30%. In my honest opinion, N5 is better than G2. I've seen people switching between them and the general impression is that N5 is much more fluid and lags a lot less, overall performance is better. The only downside is the battery, but you can get used to it."

Nexus5,3dil8u,JustAThrowaway4563,3,Thu Jul 16 16:47:11 2015 UTC,"Micro managing can be bad, yes.  However, for something like Franco kernel, you don't have to keep managing it. Just install, go through a learning phase, and then you can forget all about it.  Find what settings you want. My Moto G LTE feels hella fast at just 1.2 GHz, so why does my Nexus 5 need to run at 2.3 GHz?  Got your speed down? Now lower the voltages. I started with a -50 across the board. I found out that I could even do -75 on my 300 MHz/Sleep setting.   Sound amplification was set to ""10"". I found that I got sound distortion on the high-end (such as with max-volume Alarms) if I went above 10.  I then wrote down what I found to be good settings. If I need to wipe & reinstall, it will take me just a few seconds to put things right back to where I want them.  The end result is that I'm still near-stock, using a very popular kernel, and I'm getting the kind of battery life that I'm happier with."

Nexus5,3dil8u,yellowbluesky,2,Thu Jul 16 23:33:08 2015 UTC,I've used all of them. Elemental x is like stock kernel feels smooth no lag battery life is acceptable a bit better than stock but you get a chrome lag all time. Code blue feels just as good as elemental x but sometimes you get amazing battery 24 hours then the next day you get 12. Franko on the other hand sleeps like a champ.. Stand by time is amazing but battery drains a bit faster when being used I would recommend this kernel for people that work and need battery when they go home.
Nexus5,3dil8u,Dz1,2,Thu Jul 16 18:06:11 2015 UTC,The latest ElementalX has fixed the Chrome lags.

Nexus5,3dil8u,branran,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:02:50 2015 UTC,"I use it. I find it smooth, and I find it gives me 3 hours to 3.5 hour of SOT.   I'm also wanting to read results from other people; see if the switch to eX is really worth it.    Edit: just flashed eX 4.02 Gonna test eX 4.02 with these settings: - max cpu on screen off: 970 - max cpu screen on: 1190 (can't change this because mpdecision hotplug is enabled, will test later turning it off since lower cpu triggers more on/off on other cores) - stock thermal throttling    Update:   After using ElementalX for a Day, I can say that the screen on drain is much less noticeable than on Code Blue, this can be a mix of Code Blue's blu_plug and governor...  Honestly both are almost the same, I'll have to try eX for more time in order to cast judgement...."

I called up T-Mobile and they had me turn my phone off, wait 60 seconds then turn it back on and it fixed it.

Nexus5,3df6jt,tamus,3,Wed Jul 15 20:08:05 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure those weird colours and upside down image are due to the LCD glued behind the glass being broken in addition to the glass. I broke my screen a couple of weeks ago and it was looking a lot worse than that but a new screen (+ front housing) fixed it.

I have mine rooted anyway so I just downloaded StickMount and it worked like a charm. I actually got an SD card reader USB OTG dongle and then I also have a micro OTG to female USB adapter so I can plug flash drives and anything else USB right into it.

Personally I'm down to 3:   OnePlus One - Faster processor (801 vs. 800 snapdragon), more ram (3Gb vs. 2Gb) and (64Gb vs. 32Gb) memory than Nexus at same price (in the UK). However, support etc. is probably not as good. Also they just ran out at OnePlus so need to wait for new handsets to arrive before you can buy any from OnePlus Nexus 5. Good specs, not quite the most powerful phone anymore but still reasonably fast and great married with pure android. Pure android is fucking brilliant full stop. Battery isn't great. 3rd Gen Moto G. Out in 2 weeks. Slightly less powerful processor than Nexus 5. (1.8Ghz vs. 2.3Ghz I think), 2Gb Ram version, only available as 16Gb (but if same as old think it has SD slot). Will probably be cheaper than Nexus (Old moto G is £150 so new one might be same maybe up to £180). Moto G software is almost pure android.   I can't quite decide between them.

However, as far as your question goes use only the command that flashes the radio image when you are at the part in the guide where you use command prompt:  fastboot flash radio <where-your-radio.img-is-located>\radio.img  Again, I wouldn't recommend flashing only the radio. Safer to do the whole image and install Cataclysm on top after. Should fix any issues having to do with the radio."

I like having safe reference material when I say anything here)  After this I flash the ROM I want (Cataclysm for you). From my experience if you skip flashing ""userdata"" in command prompt your data is not wiped but you WILL have to install your apps again. It's just your files (music, pictures etc on sdcard) that are spared. I use Titanium Backup in combination with Google Drive to backup all my apps before doing any tinkering so I don't know if this method will spare app data along with your files. Backup everything to be safe.  If you only flash radio.img you will lose absolutely no data so if you really want to avoid the effort of starting over, just flash radio and see if it solves your problem.  tl;dr: Starting over is the safest option but try flashing only the radio file first and see if your problem is fixed."

Yes it is a hardware issue. many people have had the issue. When mine finally got to the point where button mashing and smacking the phone on my palm didn't work I took it apart and used compressed air to blast the heck out of the button. This kept it from restarting, and I am using gravity screen. The problem is at some point I'll have to press the button (phone dies or something) and at somepoint the button will stick again. I have no idea if/when this will happen to the point that I can overcome the issue without a replacement button."

My understanding of the issue is that both elements are problematic, but that the power cycling issue is the switch on the motherboard. I do think the black button is an issue, thus why blasting it with air helped. I did remove the power button from my case, so to hit the actual button I need to be super intentional and use a key or something else."

My friend had an old N5 with a cracked screen, so he said I could use it to tinker.  Rather than dismantle his entire phone, I decided to Frankenstein the two together, connecting his charging port to my logic board, carefully holding them in place. Funny thing is that it would boot his screen off my mobo, since the screen is connected through the charging port. Cool, huh?  The same thing happened, though. Screen came on, Google logo appeared, reboot, reboot, reboot.  Since this was a sort of strange setup, I decided to test the reverse as a proof of concept. My charge port into HIS motherboard. It worked just fine. So my Frankenstein setup was sound. Hooray for laziness!  So I learned two things from this experiment:   The problem was not my charge port. The problem was not my screen.   I can only assume the motherboard itself is busted, which gives me little hope of ever recovering my data. Oh well."

Nexus5,3d5yyq,ttebrock,2,Mon Jul 13 20:02:46 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem and couldn't really find any good solutions without root.  Here are a couple of things that help:   Enable the accessibility setting on the phone that allows you to hang up using the power button. This is essential otherwise when you call someone and it goes to voicemail, it is impossible to hang up! Note that this still doesn't allow you to type in numbers during the call (e.g. ""Press 1 for such and such...""). Make calls using a headset. I just use a cheap wired one (basically just headphones with a microphone clip on the cable). Then, start the call with the headset in and the screen should stay turned on. If it goes off after a while, pressing the power button will turn it back on (as opposed to hanging up as above). Hold the phone in one hand and hit the back of it on the palm of your other hand. I read this suggestion somewhere to ""re-seat"" the sensor which may become dislodged, and that sometimes seems to fix it. A good way to test without making a call is to get one of the phone tester apps that less you view all the sensor statuses. If it says ""Near"" even when the sensor is not covered, then it's broken (or the screen above it is dirty / cracked). If it says ""Far"" then it should work."

Nexus5,3d2wux,thejavakat,9,Mon Jul 13 03:09:23 2015 UTC,This. Rice will only absorb water it comes into contact with. Take some of that silicon and seal it in a bag. Don't open it for a few days otherwise you will let moist air in and have to start over.

Nexus5,3d1cqu,SamSlate,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:12:18 2015 UTC,I know that and I don't understand why would people use it. I installed certain apps like Messenger so I would instantly get a notification when someone sends me a message. If I use Greenify it would disable the app and I wouldn't get a notification and wouldn't know if someone sent me a message until I entet the app. And I don't want that since I can then just go to the website every time to check.

I've never done this before, and I tried to look up some guides.

Is there an up-to-date trusted guide somewhere that I can follow to root it? I don't want a custom ROM or anything. I just wanna root it so I can install apps that require it (mainly one to increase the volume on it, I can barely hear it when I connect it with an aux cable in my car) but keep it otherwise the same, but I don't know enough about rooting or Nexus 5s to recognize which guide is good and up-to-date.

Nexus5,3d2kof,Kahroo12012,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:19:37 2015 UTC,Google music still counts. Before I moved closer to work I would always hit that limit and it was solely from Google music on the subway/walk. I don't know if the prepaid plans have that music service option but I could be very wrong
Nexus5,3d2kof,scottweiss,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:07:01 2015 UTC,I only use Google Music and it definitely does not count against my quota. I even download 1GB playlists over LTE when I know I'll be entering poor coverage areas. Hopefully they're being consistent.

Nexus5,3d1b8d,akaChromez,2,Sun Jul 12 18:55:38 2015 UTC,An amoled display is where the display can turn off individual pixels for true blacks. The only nexus device to use this is the nexus 6.

Nexus5,3d1b8d,hrkristian,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:29:03 2015 UTC,Isn't that the same thing though? Screen Filter just adds a layer of black no?
Nexus5,3d1b8d,rerennnn,2,Sun Jul 12 22:21:06 2015 UTC,"Nah, for one Twilight can't do anything to the system UI so the notification and navigation bar stays the same. It's kinda shitty to look at for those of us with the latter as it easily glares. Beyond that the red layer of Twilight etc is much less comfortable to look at than what you get with cf.lumen, Twilight just adds a uniform layer above your app, cf.lumen dynamically changes each original color so that it looks... good. For example pure black with Twilight becomes a very dark red, while with cf.lumen it stays just black, because red is not better than black [given the screen isn't blue-tinted for some fucked up reason] for this purpose."

Using an app called GPS status shows that it seems to be looking for the wrong satellites. The ""constellation"" shown is all wrong. Like it is convinced that it in some other hemisphere, and keeps trying to get a fix from satellites that re not visible, until after a few minutes it finally figures out where it is and what satellites it should be in few.

Nexus5,3d0zm2,psychoticpython,6,Sun Jul 12 16:50:22 2015 UTC,"Nexus 6 specs leaked in Oct. 2014. We first saw a picture of the first Nexus 5 in September of 2013 and leaks of the specs in Oct 2013. We first saw spec leaks of the Nexus 4 in Oct 2012. So if they are following their normal schedule the earliest we will see something will be late September/early Oct.   It might be different this year. The nexus 6 was supposedly part of a failed android silver program, so it seemed like it was thrown together at the last minute. The next nexus(s) will probably be better thought out and have a structured release schedule. The iphone usually launches in September so Google might want to put some heat on them this year and perhaps launch ahead of time(pure speculation). Jelly Bean was launched in July 2012 with the Nexus 7 so we do know incremental OS launches can happen outside of the normal October-Nov reveal. There are rumors of unusually early release in August and some rumored specs but they are from sketchy sources(Android pit and GeekSnack) and should probably be taken with a grain of salt."

Hold the Volume Up key for 5 secs then release and a new menu will appear. Use the volume keys to select Wipe Cache Partition and press the power button to select it. Wait a while (5-30 minutes although I've read it can take an hour) for it to complete   I don't remember if the phone reboots automatically here or not, but if it doesn't, just hold the Power button for about 15 seconds and it'll reboot.  I had some little issues getting it to work for me a couple of weeks ago, I think for the ""No command"" part I held Vol+ for a few seconds and then pressed Power and released both.  Apparently you can ""wipe"" it through Settings->Storage->Cache, but that isn't a full wipe of the partition. You could try that first though and see if it makes a difference.

In some Nexus Units, the power button tends to wear out after a while, and can often get stuck, forcing your phone to bootloop.  A temporary solution is to tap your phone on a hard surface with a bit of force whenever it happens to unstick the power button, but a more permanent and better option is to either permanently un jam the power button using the guide that can be found on XDA, or getting your power button replaced."

Nexus5,3cyke7,Ben3862,3,Sat Jul 11 23:13:55 2015 UTC,"The newest version is usually the best version to upgrade to. Some people like the look and feel of KitKat better than Lollipop though, so its really personal preference. If you are rooted and your bootloader is unlocked, then you will have to download the factory image from the Nexus factory images site and flash it through fastboot. If you are not rooted, then you can take the over the air update when it becomes available. You can check if there is an OTA available by going to settings, about phone, check for system update. If your bootloader is unlocked, there is rarely a time when you can't root. You would just have to flash the newest SuperSU package through recovery. If you mean unlocked in terms of cell service providers, then yes. If you are talking about the bootloader, the answer is still yes. You can back up your phone through TWRP, CWM, or Philz recovery. You will see an option that says back up, just check all of the boxes and start the backup. The file can get fairly large depending on what you have on your phone. It does not back up the /sdcard files which are the ones such as pictures, music, videos, etc. It will back up the system, data, cache, boot, and recovery partitions of the phone. You will have to transfer the files from /sdcard to a computer through the USB transfer cable. If you do a full backup like it was described above, then yes you can restore it to exactly how it was."
Nexus5,3cyke7,lcallahan7,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:53:43 2015 UTC,"Nicely said. All I would add is that if you use the factory image to upgrade, do a full backup including /sdcard as it will completely wipe your phone. OTA upgrade won't. Unlocking your bootloader will also wipe your phone.  Basically...always back up before tinkering."

Nexus5,3cwb3c,bruzie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:11:59 2015 UTC,"I too have the same case. The champagne back scratches fairly easily and there's a chance that the plastic around the power button can snap. Otherwise, this case has held up well for the ~1.5 years I've had it and looks great"

Nexus5,3cwb3c,matkv,2,Sat Jul 11 11:28:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah this was one of the biggest issues I had with this case, but otherwise it's a nice case. Some of the larger/shorter audio jacks don't fit through hole.. though this is a problem for a lot of other cases out there.  I got the champagne one on release and it was good, looked nice, cleaned easily, even dropped it a few times and it shielded well. After about a year I started caring less for the safety of the phone as it wasn't brand new anymore, and switched back to naked with a dbrand skin on the back.   IMO the N5 (and phones in general) usually feel more premium to me without a case because they get too bulky, but if you're the type who drops your phone everyday then there's no other way. Though I like to think going naked makes you more self-conscious/less clumsy for fear of dropping your phone :)  A few other minor gripes: on the edges there's a bit of a bevel where the sides round out, and if you hold the case for too long it starts digging into your palm somewhat. Also the case is really tight, which is a good thing I guess, but annoying when trying to take it off.  Wireless charging works through the case."

Nexus5,3cwb3c,TH3J4CK4L,3,Sat Jul 11 13:26:36 2015 UTC,People think it's actually part of the phone and only realize it's a case after I take it off. 10/10 would recommend.
Nexus5,3cwb3c,papijaja,3,Sat Jul 11 15:46:14 2015 UTC,Can you still utilize the wireless charging with this?  I have a spigen with metallic bumper but the back has the matted feel akin to the N5 and the wireless charging works well
Nexus5,3cwb3c,GorJus,3,Sat Jul 11 20:12:47 2015 UTC,"Yup I've used this case before and you can still use wireless charging, although I think it's a little slower since there's more material between the phone and coils."
Nexus5,3cwb3c,Jayowend,8,Sat Jul 11 22:58:57 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I bought that case long ago and I hated how it felt so much. I still have it somewhere and its like brand new.  After that I bought the Diztronic TPU case and I am still using it. It does not feel premium at all, bit I love the way it feels. I'd try something with aluminum in it so you can get the cold/heavy feel that is usually referred to as premium."

Nexus5,3cwb3c,Zedriodor,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:57:25 2015 UTC,I have this too. Good case but I would definitely not consider it premium. The plastic bezel feels cheap and the buttons rattle and look cheap as well. Paired with a glass screen protector this is a great combo. I work in construction and it protects my phone sufficiently.
Nexus5,3cwb3c,othernamewastaken,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:07:49 2015 UTC,I really love this case. I've had a lot of people ask why I don't have a case on my phone and get surprised when I pull the case off.

Nexus5,3cwb3c,Taliesintroll,6,Sat Jul 11 13:39:25 2015 UTC,I'd recommend you put a dbrand skin on the back and a glass screen protector on the front. I can't go back to cases once I did this.
Nexus5,3cwb3c,Korinu,3,Sat Jul 11 19:26:30 2015 UTC,"Not really HTC One-ish, but I got a dbrand Carbon Fiber texture skin and it feels fucking amazing. I'd previously had a Spigen Ultra Hybrid case, and because the N5 is the perfect size for my hands, any case would make it feel too big, so I couldn't use it much."
Nexus5,3cwb3c,thecolonelofk,2,Sat Jul 11 20:52:17 2015 UTC,Agreed. I went with a wood skin and tempered glass on the screen. Feels amazing and still turns heads wherever I go.
Nexus5,3cwb3c,astroballs,2,Sun Jul 12 00:04:16 2015 UTC,My phone likes to be naked. Haven't come across anything that feels as good as a caseless N5 (unless someone has made a sandstone black case similar to the One+ One).
Nexus5,3cwb3c,BumWarrior69,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:32:39 2015 UTC,"Try the official LG case (not flip), it is the closest to naked you can get.

Nexus5,3cwb3c,oldbaldfool,3,Sun Jul 12 03:41:53 2015 UTC,"I like the Ballistic case.  A little more on the ""rugged"" side, but the black and white one looks great."

KitKat has better battery life by far, but it also has worse graphics performance and you lose out on things like smart unlock (which also doesn't help battery) and colored status bar.  Lollipop looks great and performs great, but I had to carry a portable battery with me everywhere just so my Nexus 5 wouldn't die in the middle of the day. People say shit like root it, flash a rom, and uninstall every social app, but that's not an ideal solution.  I ended up getting an iPhone after smashing my Nexus 5. Hopefully this will work a little better."

I'd be curious if anyone has had the issue with a known-to-be real battery, like one taken from another Nexus 5.  If so, it seems like it's more likely to be a software issue.  Also, I'd be curious if anyone had done a full factory image flash, and whether that might fix it.    FWIW, the new (possibly fake) battery is awesome so far except for the temperature.  On its first full day, it got 21.5 hours / 4.5 hours SOT, which was roughly double what the original battery got by the time I replaced it.  If I can get comfortable that it isn't going to overheat at some point, I'd be fine with keeping it."

You should uninstall it immediately. They can not speed your phone up in any way. The best they can do is nothing. The worst is slow it down. I can elaborate further if you'd like but I'm not going to go into an unsolicited rant about what a cache is any why it's incredibly stupid for these apps to claim clearing it speeds up a device.  Were you not backing up photos automatically to Google+? If so, they should still be there despite being deleted from the device. They should still show up in the Photos app if that's the case, but not the Gallery app.  Unfortunately since KitKat there is no easy way to mount internal storage as a block device. It's all abstracted by the kernel. If you're rooted, you can use ADB shell and get your storage mounted as a block device using this method but you'll probably want some Linux command-line knowledge for that."

That app doesn't know what is and what isn't important on your storage in terms of junk leftover by apps. A fine example of that is it deleting your photos. I highly suggest you uninstall it and never look back. It's a scam. That's obvious just by the wording used on the Play Store description. Running that app is analogous with installing RAM optimizers on Windows. They can't help.  That said, without root you're shit out of luck.

If your button is stuck, opening the device, removing the battery, and cleaning the power button with something mild may be able to un-stuck it.  It is totally possible to remove the button completely - I've left it out accidentally on 2 different repairs and had to go back to the bones to put it back in.

If it's mechanically stuck, you should be able to at least pop it out.  If it is stuck because some gunk got there, the solvent can do it (just allow thorough drying and make sure you don't get any where you don't want it).  The button is a physical switch.  If you remove the plastic piece precisely without damaging something else, you should be able to subsequently actuate it with a toothpick.  But I would give you very, very poor odds at your chances of removing the plastic part without also pulling off the conductor inside.  I plain do not recommend this.  Completely replacing the power button is quite possible, but you better be damned confident in your fine soldering skills: http://protyposis.net/blog/replacing-the-nexus-5-power-button/  An OEM power button is less than $10 on eBay.  If you fuck this up, you'll need a new mobo, which is more or less where you stand right now anyway, so not a lot to lose.

We have addressed many issues brought up during the first phase of the developer preview. Check out the release notes for a detailed list of changes in this update. Some of the highlights to the update include:  Android Platform Changes:     Modifications to platform permissions including external storage, Wi-Fi & Bluetooth location, and changes to contacts/identity permissions. Device connections through the USB port are now set to charge-only mode by default. To access the device, users must explicitly grant permission. API Changes:     Updated Bluetooth Stylus APIs with updated callback events. View.onContextClickListener and GestureDetector.OnContextClickListener to listen for stylus button presses and to perform secondary actions.     Updated Media API with new callback InputDevice.hasMicrophone() method for determining if a device microphone exists. Fixes for developer-reported issues:     TextInputLayout doesn't set hint for embedded EditText. (fixed issue)     Camera Permission issue with Legacy Apps (fixed issue)"

Too bad android doesn't have battery cycle count like iPhone's. I've been using the N5 for about 1.75yrs now so I'm probably beyond the 500cycle count.

Chroma is also a nice fairly minimalist one for an AOSP.  Xposed is also pretty stable on 5.1.1 now so you could always do stock + xposed too.

What I've been told is that the random reboot and the optimizing app issues are not related one to the other.

The fact that somethinghaha said owh yeah and restarting the phone in the google logo or when booting up is what causing the optimizing apps thing makes me finally a little confident since fixing the power button should resolve everything (I seriously hope so)  PS: the optimizing app only happens in Lollipop, I've downgraded to KitKat 4.4.4 and it seems like I only get the reboots"

Also, rebooting at the google logo, and plugging in your phone to charge, as Gorge said, should no have an effect on whether or not your phone reoptimizes the apps upon boot.

As a last resort I tried to flash KitKat 4.4.4 few days later and the ""optimizing app"" notification disappeared, while the random reboots did not. This situation led me into thinking that not only my power button isn't wortking properly, but that there's some kind of issue with the rest of my hardware somewhere (which isn't necessarily true, just a guessing of mine).

Nexus5,3cj73u,DryYourTears,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:54:07 2015 UTC,"Aah, okay, I had most of that. The reason you aren't getting the optimization every boot is because as of 5.x, Android runs on the ART runtime, meaning it compiles all the apps once, supposed to be per update.

Before these chargers I had some cheap $5 ones off of eBay and it was always really hard to get everything lines up just right. The Tylt has multiple areas that work for charging so I just set the phone down and go without having to check anything. It also doesn't seem to get as hot as the cheaper chargers that I had.

Possibly some wall chargers put out a little more than 5v spec which allows the phone to pull until its limit."
Nexus5,3cgn6v,ThatFuckinGuy-,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:15:31 2015 UTC,Hmm that's pretty cool. There was another user who is showing the same thing with some sort of chromebook charger as well. So it seems there are a few others now. Alrec huh? Sounds like a fire waiting to happen haha
Nexus5,3cgn6v,iHateMyUserName2,3,Wed Jul 8 11:12:38 2015 UTC,"Nah well known Australian electrical brand. No coil whine either, couldn't sleep at night with the stock charger."
Nexus5,3cgn6v,ThatFuckinGuy-,2,Wed Jul 8 11:25:25 2015 UTC,Oh gotcha. Yeah that whine is a bad capacitor. LG loves to use shit circuitry so it was a common issue on the N5 and the N4. FWIW Google was doing RMA's for those suckers if you are really interested in getting a new one and you bought it from the GP Store.
Nexus5,3cgn6v,iHateMyUserName2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:58:49 2015 UTC,Is this perhaps a BB thing? I've been using a blackberry charger at my PC desk for several years now and have always found that it charges faster than others. It's an old charger that I admittedly hiked off a former workplace (they were getting rid of all the old Curves and Bolds...they were already pretty much scrap so I figured one of 30 chargers wouldn't be a big deal) but definitely not a tablet charger. Could it also be running at 1.8A with my N5?
Nexus5,3cgn6v,gaflar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:37:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm honestly not sure if this applies to all, but if it does then I guess your sitting on a gold mine then. Here's how to check: download Ampere from the Google Play store and let it run. Now typically your phone will use around 300mA if the screen is on and the phone is basically at idle. So if they are charging at 1.8A, you should see a reading of about 1500mA or slightly more (up to 1800mA max but realistically up to 1650mA or so)."
Nexus5,3cgn6v,iHateMyUserName2,8,Wed Jul 8 13:02:50 2015 UTC,How does this affect the battery in long term?  I've avoided using anything but my N5 charger because of that.
Nexus5,3cgn6v,elmorte,15,Tue Jul 7 22:34:59 2015 UTC,"the phone only takes what amps it can handle,  more amps is more heat but over the life of a battery it is not taken into account as its negligible. Ive used 2.1amp charger for the last 8 months and it charges my phone fully in an hour. personally even if this effected my battery id just spend the 12 dollars i think? for a new battery"
Nexus5,3cgn6v,eddied96,3,Tue Jul 7 23:00:27 2015 UTC,"You can use up to whatever amperage charger you want as the phone controls that. Ex: you could use a 2.4A charger but the phone will only accept 1.2A with the exception being with this BB charger- then it will take 1.8A. Either way, the phone controls it so it'll be fine."
Nexus5,3cgn6v,iHateMyUserName2,2,Wed Jul 8 02:12:31 2015 UTC,"Can you explain this to me, why will it take 1.2A from a 2.4A charger but it will take 1.8A from this BB charger?"
Nexus5,3cgn6v,ChosenGSR,-1,Wed Jul 8 10:51:18 2015 UTC,So the reason it takes 1.2A from a 2.4A charger is because that's where it's supposed to be limited to- it's not supposed to go any higher. The BB charger for whatever reason seems to be able to get around that but I'm not sure why.
Nexus5,3cgn6v,iHateMyUserName2,3,Wed Jul 8 11:10:40 2015 UTC,This coupled with one of their 3 foot cables is the best combo I've found. It pulls 1.5 amps at the wall when measured with a Kill-a-Watt.
Nexus5,3cgn6v,mstrmanager,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:12:17 2015 UTC,It should be pulling more than that. How dead was your phone when you tested it? You should've seen above 1.8A at the wall... like somewhere right around 10W (2A)
Nexus5,3cgn6v,iHateMyUserName2,2,Wed Jul 8 02:14:03 2015 UTC,"It was around 30 or 40% but I can't remember. I'm sure at different intervals, especially when I'm close to 90%, it will change slower than that. Everything else I tried was around 1.2. I have various cables including a few from monoprice, and anker. The stock cables were normally worse than the third party cables."
Nexus5,3cgn6v,mstrmanager,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:23:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, still at 30-40% you should've been good. So that is kind of odd. Not sure if you're talking about that premium Monoprice cable, but if you are, that thing is pretty damn solid so I'm not too surprised there."
Nexus5,3cgn6v,iHateMyUserName2,2,Wed Jul 8 02:27:46 2015 UTC,Regardless that combo charged my N5 from 10% to 100 in under an hour. I was seriously impressed. It didn't get very hot as well. When I use an anker cable with the same charger my iPhone 5 gets really hot and takes longer than my N5 to charge. I have an OPO now and the Anker 5 port still works very well.
Nexus5,3cgn6v,mstrmanager,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:30:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that leads me to believe that there was an issue with the reading. 90% of the N5 battery is 2070mAh, so that would require right around a 2A input for an even hour charge. A 1.5A charger would at a max get you 1500mAh (obviously) so taking you from 230mAh to 1730mAh or from 10% to 75% in an hour. So that BB muuuuust be charging faster than 1.5A.  Yeah, I have a ton of Monoprice cables and always had better luck with them over the Anker ones as well."
Nexus5,3cgn6v,iHateMyUserName2,2,Wed Jul 8 02:36:21 2015 UTC,"1.5A from the wall is 1.5*110=165W, assuming you're in a 110V country..."
Nexus5,3cgn6v,Lampshader,0,Wed Jul 8 11:02:35 2015 UTC,"The outlet may be at 110V but the charger is at 5V. So if you look at any of the chargers for sale, they're typically listed as 10W or whatever (nothing above say 15W per usb socket)"
Nexus5,3cgn6v,iHateMyUserName2,5,Wed Jul 8 11:09:04 2015 UTC,Perhaps I should re-phrase:  The only time you'll see a USB charger drawing 2A from the mains is when it's on fire.
Nexus5,3cgn6v,Lampshader,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:39:02 2015 UTC,"Haha, well to be fair, the only time the N5 draws 2A is when it's on fire. Tablets draw 2A+ all the time."

For charger enthusiasts, the speed of how fast a charger can well charge is based on it's amperage. This one is 1.8a, and the default travel charger the nexus 5 comes with is 1-1.1~a"
Nexus5,3cgn6v,kay911kay,5,Tue Jul 7 21:17:35 2015 UTC,This is what I'm using as well and it's been the best charging cable I've ever used.
Nexus5,3cgn6v,provoaggie,4,Tue Jul 7 22:10:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the default charger is 1.2A for a reason- the Nexus 5 is supposed to only charge at 1.2A. The BB charger somehow gets around that at 1.8A. Ill bet you that your Nvidia shield charger provides a 1.2A charge as well."
Nexus5,3cgn6v,iHateMyUserName2,-2,Wed Jul 8 02:01:11 2015 UTC,Not sure how that works unless the way its constructed is completely different from other chargers. Anyways I did a lil bit of checking on ampere and the default n5 charger got about 600mA and the 2.1a shield charger got about 900mA while screen was on
Nexus5,3cgn6v,kay911kay,2,Wed Jul 8 02:16:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah man I honestly don't know. I tried digging around to find some differences a while back, but came up with nothing other than this BB charger being the only one able to hit 1.8A. My guess is the circuitry in the charger is somehow wired differently than normal because I've tested a ton of high quality chargers and nothing.  Thanks for checking that stuff, it's right what I would've expected. Typically if you're below 80% or so, you have your screen on, and your basically at idle, it typically seems to consume around 300mA (thus 1200mA-300mA = 900mA which is what you saw). The 600mA is kind of unusual though. For the first 30 seconds or so, it'll typically ramp up so if you only tested it for about 30 seconds, maybe that's why?"

So chances are your Chromebook charger charges at the typical 1200mA or 1.2A rate that is default for the N5. This BB charger is the only known exception that will go to 1.8A or 1800mA (thus your reading would theoretically be 1640mA if you tested it the same)."

My N5 will not recognize AC charging sources consistently, and will charge at the much lower USB rate. It happens with this charger on occasion (seems like it's actually more often than not), and is sometimes resolved by unplugging and reinserting the USB cable. Rebooting the phone doesn't do anything, so I really suspect it's a physical issue, but it's intermittent enough that Google isn't calling it a problem..."

When charging with my 2 amp touchpad charger I could never get more than 1.5A, and that was only after trying many different cables. I picked up a second BB charger for $10 recently.

If you're worried you should take the back off, take out the battery and scrub with a clean tooth brush to get out the bits of organic matter from the rice. Then hot hairdryer the insides to dry it out.   I dunked my N5 on new years day. Dismantled the thing with a dinner knife, it was fairly simple to follow online instructions to get most of the components loose enough to sop up puddles with tissue then hairdryer to dry.

Nexus5,3cc54p,evilf23,2,Tue Jul 7 19:59:20 2015 UTC,"Good daaaaamit! I just wrote the longest reddit post of my life and hit the wrong button, deleting it seconds before it was to send. If I'm brief it's became I'm all written out, alas.  RR doesn't vastly differ from the majority of AOSPs for hammerhead, it's more that with ROMs for the Nexus 5 they differ primarily by whether they have RRO support or use Theme Engine, offer up PIE control/app bar/ app wheel  baked in and in what combination. Apart from that they're alms of identical in terms of what featuresets they offer. Apart from a few ROMs or Kernels or combination of the two that seemed to have it out for my battery more so than the norm I haven't noticed all that much difference in the battery life department even when comparing Cataclysm alongside Code Blue to Generic CM 12.1 fork with stock or ElementX or whatever. Even in the performance department the differences are fairly negligible. That being said, RR offers a diverse set of features, and (for me) up until the last few weeks it also paired excellent stability with that. Unfortunately the last few builds haven't played nicely with my phone at all and my touting of RR is more out of habit. You should give it a try since this stuff affects one person and never happens so much as once to another. It's also the only ROM apart from Cyanide L and Euphoria that regularly introduces fairly major feature additions.  Now i jump between a hunch of ROMs as new builds materialize out of curiosity, but primarily use Cataclysm or Cyanide L since they're the ROMs that offer the most original experience in regards to features and things of that ilk and also manage to be stable as shit (while obviously not as stable as pseudo-stock Cataclysm, Cyanide L (can't recommend it enough) has SOOO many features even if I were to just count the ones that are purely available on said ROM and still manages to be more stable then the large majority of other, more popular ROMs out there)  I fear that since I only got this phone well after the release of Lollipop that I got it after the phone had been pushed to its limits, for the time being at least, and as a consequence it's become difficult for ROMs to differ from one another all that drastically. Any suggestions for anything that really differentiates itself from the pack I may have missed?"

Nexus5,3cc54p,makintoos,3,Tue Jul 7 13:14:33 2015 UTC,Layers is more stable and gives less of a performance hit than the CM engine. The CM engine is still in alpha and I remember using it and having things like my settings menu constantly crash when a theme was applied.
Nexus5,3cc54p,evilf23,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:09:31 2015 UTC,CM theme engine lagged noticeably when i tried it a while back. has it gotten any better over time? been thinking of getting a galaxy tab s for the amoled screen and flashing a CM 12 build on it with a amoled black theme.
Nexus5,3cc54p,painfullyalone,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:21:34 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough I'd somehow managed to go through a seemingly impossible amounts of time without that being an issue when I asked the question, and had totally forgotten about how maddeningly unstable theme engine could be. In the 24 hours since my luck has run out and its day driving me nuts. Its consonant enough to most likely be a ROM issue, so I'm going to try and give one with RRO support another shot"
Nexus5,3cc54p,Victitious,2,Wed Jul 8 14:33:42 2015 UTC,PA always seemed to lack customizability
Nexus5,3cc54p,KingKobra87,4,Tue Jul 7 01:42:13 2015 UTC,"Always? I guess you never used PA on Jelly Bean.  That said, I've been disappointed in PA since then."
Nexus5,3cc54p,painfullyalone,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:20:39 2015 UTC,"I've only been aware of PA since KitKat so I don't have any experience with it prior to that, was the difference in how much customization it offered that pronounced? I noticed a definite shift towards sacrificing freedom in the ux department for an ""on rails"" experience as the various builds progressed and the different itinerations of KK were released, and now its just ugh, but I thought it gave a fair amount of options right up until 4.4.2, even at the latter stages. I'd be interested in hearing how it changed direction from the JB days."
Nexus5,3cc54p,KingKobra87,4,Tue Jul 7 07:49:45 2015 UTC,"PA made itself famous by pioneering several amazing UI customizations. System UI mode (phone, tablet, phablet), per-app DPI settings, pie controls, Halo, etc. Just watch this video to get a better idea of what I mean.  A lot of Jelly Bean and KitKat ROMs cherrypicked many of the features from PA, but if it wasn't for PA, these features may have never been possible. PACman was a ""SuperROM"" of sorts which basically combined everything from PA, CM, AOKP, and others. Your options were basically endless.  Nowadays, I don't see PA being much different than CM."
Nexus5,3cc54p,painfullyalone,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:36:45 2015 UTC,"That explains all of these PA features I've seen alluded to but never encountered on any of the builds I've flashed, regardless of phone. I knew it was a pale shadow of it's former self on lollipop regardless of build or phone, but always assumed when I was on KK that I had the bad luck of always buying phones that had limited PA development.

And that's coming from someone who merely likes Cataclysm as opposed to worshiping it."
Nexus5,3cc54p,shinrikyou,2,Tue Jul 7 07:45:19 2015 UTC,"I came here looking for this. Used PA extensively in KK and it had all the features I wanted while keeping it stock. This 5.1 build, apart the theme engine and the immersive mode button on the pull down setting, has literally nothing. Not even the very basic stuff like the clear all button in the recent apps screen. What the hell happened? I flashed it a few hours ago, but I guess by the end of the day I'm gonna flash another ROM because this is 98% pure stock and that's not a good thing really. Might as well just flash the official 5.1.1 image and root it, it'll be exactly the same thing as far as I'm concerned."

For most devices, we suggest TK GApps which are a continuation of the old-school PA GApps. For flounder, Banks 64bit GApps are advised instead. Additionally, if you are using a flounder, you should flash the vendor partition of the LMY47X factory image to avoid system issues - and if you are not comfortable with doing that for any reason, you should wait for the next build as it will include a minor change that will get rid of this requirement."

I installed the few apps from the stock manually and that was it, but it was the first time I ever got that error message after countless ROMs and gapps packages I've tried in the 1.5 year I've owned my phone. Doesn't really make much sense since I'm pretty sure I've used 400 and 500MB gapps packages in the past."

I've broke the camera on my n5, the screen, replaced them, managed to super glue the power button in place while trying to glue the crack in the side beside the sim tray, got caught outside in a crazy rain/hail storm and never ever killed it with water.  I once lost a borrowed flip phone on the side of the highway. Outside of a city 2 hours from where I live after my car engine blew up. I made a post online, some random person went to the place where I waited for the tow truck, and walked through the ditch of 2 foot tall grass, found the phone, and the met me to give it back.  I lost my lg optimus g outside a Tim Horton's while getting a coffee in a town 45/minutes west of my place while getting a ride to a town 3 hours away to buy a new car.  Once I was driving away in my new car I realized I never had my phone. Called it a few times, finally someone ""figured out"" how to answer the phone. He found it in the town close to my house, and drove with it about 30minutes from where I picked up the new car.  I drove from a town I've never been into, to another town, with about 4 pieces of instructions remembered in my head.  Whaddya know? The guy was parked where he said with my phone waiting for me.

Nexus5,3carqg,discocristo,2,Mon Jul 6 22:30:56 2015 UTC,"Sure, all I meant by working fine was booting, since the OP was having that issue. However I would say its useable now, 3/4g works, WiFi and Bluetooth are fine too. The apps or scopes are pretty stable, though the music app could be more intuitive. Call logs and message history is saved correctly, settings all work and the notification area is great.     However as a multirom its limited by the fact that it can't access my Android partition for files etc, so if it was installed and operated as a main rom personally there would be no major issues, just a lack of apps at present. All the main ones are there or can be accessed via web apps. If you have 2gb free on your phone and you're rooted just give it a try!"

Nexus5,3caraa,Adderbox76,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:35:20 2015 UTC,"Well I think the reason I couldn't charge it was because I left the battery in.  Hence my advice to get the battery out.  Taking off the back plate to remove the battery also allows it to dry faster.  From the research I did when this happened to me, the biggest threat from water is in the battery cells losing their polarity.  If your battery didn't get wet from the initial dunk, pull it out as quick as possible and set it aside until the phone itself is dry as a bone again.  They you MIGHT have a chance.  With that taken care of, all you have to worry about is whether or not there was a short circuit in the time it took you to get the phone out of the toilet and turn it off.  If there wasn't, then you wait for it to dry (we're talking at least two weeks in rice), pop your battery back in and hope for the best.  If there was a short (ie, you're phone turned itself off or made funky sounds, or the display went wierd) then you still do the exact same as above, but your odds are decidedly lower.  Chances are if there was a short, in three weeks you'll pull your phone out, pop the battery back in, and have a nice brick...like mine.  :-(  Sorry I can't give you better news."

Nexus5,3ca55l,ThinkBritish,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:53:56 2015 UTC,"I can confirm that this is an issue. I'm running full stock, unrooted 5.1.1 and since I got my Nexus 5 this has been an issue. It occurs randomly when using the keyboard in any app, though as you mentioned, typing at speed is the worst offender. I have tried different keyboard apps but they haven't fixed anything. If anything, since 5.0 it has improved the situation, however 5.1.1 has seemingly made it worse.   If anything it sounds like the buffer for the keyboard isn't big enough and the phone lags with dynamic memory allocation, can't say for sure though as I'm just guessing.  In all honesty, It's not a major hindrance and it works itself out shortly. Only problem is if you're trying to proof read."

It’s just a barely perceptible augmentation of your own voice -about 8%  Without sidetone, talking on a mobile phone feels exactly like what it is in reality: holding a piece of plastic to your ear and speaking out loud. There’s no feeling of connection, no audio “interface” between you and the device; your voice just propagates outward as it would in any other situation, lost to the ether.   http://pocketnow.com/2012/09/21/sidetone-the-best-calling-feature-you-never-heard-of  I lost this fix when updating my rom and hadn't thought to put it back until learning about sidetone.

To some the sound quality of recorded video would have a muddy tone. It almost sounds like the middle tones and bass have been scooped out of the video.  The ""fix"" just aims to take some of the noise suppression out of the microphone and allow a broader spectrum of range to come through in recorded videos.

If you bought from Google, just double check that your phone definitely isn't under warranty, if they send you a replacement it comes with an extra 2 years warranty.  As a temporary fix, do as AutoModerator suggested, flick the power button, squeeze, shake etc until the phone turns on and then do your best not to press the power button again.  If paying for a repair is out of the question just now, download Gravity Screen, this will allow you to lock and unlock your phone without messing with the power button at all.  And if the phone is definitely out of warranty, try find a guide online on fixing the power button yourself (it is a very common issue)."

Nexus5,3c6lm6,ekswhyzed,2,Sun Jul 5 12:55:42 2015 UTC,"No I don't believe they are related. Random reboots is most likely caused by stuck power button. I've gotten the optimization of apps though, and I got it bad. When it first started happening it would shut down at about 70-80% battery left and when I try to boot it up, it would go through the boot animations and start the optimizing of apps but wouldn't get past a couple apps before it shut down again. Worked 100% fine while charging though. In the beginning I didn't think it was a battery issue because if I boot into fastboot, I can stay there all day and my phone wouldn't die. It got progressively worse and died at maybe 93% and also died in fastboot mode so I concluded it was a battery issue. Swapped the battery and its the best thing I did because now I don't get any more optimizations and got 5-6 hours of SoT with no sim, only WiFi and with sim at least 3-4 hours of SoT.  tl:dr: pretty sure not related, swapping batteries helped in getting rid of optimizations.

Nexus5,3bzvos,_Momotsuki,58,Fri Jul 3 14:52:53 2015 UTC,Power button.  Fix the damn power button. It is just too flimsy/gets stuck or just plain broken too easily.

I'm not really sure what major leaps have been made in terms of hardware since the 6 came out. Nothing major I can think of. I'd be a fan of the old Nexus 5 frame (maybe slim it down if possible) with the Nexus 6 specs at the Nexus 5 price point. Like literally I'd be the first one to buy it.

Nexus5,3bzvos,-Rivox-,19,Fri Jul 3 15:48:43 2015 UTC,"But I'm sure that would increase the price of the phone if you choose the premium case. Don't get me wrong I would love to see that but, i rather see increase in performance rather then look."
Nexus5,3bzvos,jeff0106,6,Fri Jul 3 15:52:39 2015 UTC,"It would be either metal+$$$, or plastic without any increment in price. I would go for the second one. I want a nexus that costs 350$ at launch, not one that costs 500$, we aready saw what happened in that case."

Nexus5,3bzvos,for_lolz,6,Sat Jul 4 17:29:43 2015 UTC,The Nexus 5 looks good but I do hope they improve the build quality. I've had 3 Nexus 5s due to RMAs and they're always creaky.
Nexus5,3bzvos,Annihilia,3,Fri Jul 3 16:30:21 2015 UTC,"That's how they make them so cheap. Although the nexus 4 has great build quality (though bad design decisions, both sides are glass!), so I'm sure they can up their game a little bit."

I'd be all for them refining it a little bit like doing away with some of the plastic to give it a premium feel.
Nexus5,3bzvos,LiteweightPhenomenal,2,Sat Jul 4 06:06:11 2015 UTC,"That's what I meant. Making a few changes, but making it generally look the same(dimensions and corner rounding)"

The reception compared to most other phones, especially something like an iPhone is miserable.  This doesn't come into play in great reception areas but somewhere where the signal is low it makes a world of difference.   Example.  My parents house when lucky I get 1 bar HSPA, no LTE.  My wife will get 2 dots on her iPhone on LTE, same network obviously.  She can pull about 2-3mbit on speed test, my speed test won't even run.  Half of my calls don't go through, and same with MMS.  Her phone does either no problem.  And it's not just my phone.  My father also has an n5 and my mom has the iPhone 6, same exact result."

I don't really need a new phone with a ton of extra features. In fact the phone can remain exactly the same. EXCEPT FIX THE GPS AND FIX BATTERY LIFE! For the love of God! Why is the GPS so horrible?! Why does every promise of a GPS fix fail? GPS on this phone is so bad that I'm considering buying a Garmin. What is this the early 2000s? A Garmin? Yes. That's how bad the GPS is on this phone. I'm willing to go back in time to when life was simpler and full of wires.  While I'm back in the past I guess I'll prevent my younger self from getting that student loan. That's also really running my life. I'll tell myself that being a carpenter is a good career choice and that growing a moustache is cool again. Although, being a carpenter from '08 to around '13 was a little rough.  Whatever. The point is that I'm spending a ton of natural resources that could better be used at solving world hunger to instead build a time machine in order to buy a GPS system that fucking works.  LG.

Nexus5,3bzvos,CRCasper,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:42:14 2015 UTC,Original design with enhanced build quality and improved craftsmanship would be ideal. More battery capacity would definitely make sense considering its much anticipated upgraded specs in the 2nd gen.

I made a thread just today because I finally got to the point where I want some answers where before I've mostly been one of the silent."
Nexus5,3bzdqg,hrkristian,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:44:27 2015 UTC,"Of course people who have issues will be more likely to complain than those who have no issues. If someone's phone is working fine, they're not going to post about how great it is. On the other hand, those who  encounter problems will be the most vocal about it."
Nexus5,3bzdqg,flamingspartan3,2,Mon Jul 6 16:33:23 2015 UTC,"Well obviously, but you completely missed the point.  My point was there are people out there who are using phones with the exact same issue(s) you hear about here, but because they either don't realise or care about it you don't hear from them. Your asserted those who are silent are people without issues, in truth there is no direct correlation between the two. For instance, for us to hear about an issue here a person would need at least three qualifiers: knowledgeable enough about tech to understand there is an issue; knowledge about /r/Android; caring enough to have their voice heard. Take away any one of those and we here never hear the person (disregarding other outlets we might hear from,) and there is no way for us at present time of gauging what the state is of that majority group's phones."
Nexus5,3bzdqg,hrkristian,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:06:21 2015 UTC,I agree but the vast majority of silent users have no issues.

If someone is not at all bothered by a problem in their product, then they don't consider it a problem or ""issue"". As a result, most of the buyers of the Nexus 5 are ""silent""  and most of those either don't have issues or have issues but are not bothered by them. It is unlikely that a huge portion of users will see awful battery life, be annoyed by it and sit silently about it."

Nexus5,3c0mq8,Left4Head,5,Fri Jul 3 18:04:28 2015 UTC,What phone right now I'd honestly as premium as other flagships but has stock android? None.   GPE phones failed because nobody wanted them either.  Nexus 4 and 5 succeeded because a great all-rounder at a fair price is what people want.
Nexus5,3c0mq8,nawoanor,0,Fri Jul 3 23:22:20 2015 UTC,But they weren't even Nexus'. People just saw them as the same phone and as the carriers but at a higher price with no discount on the phone that the carriers offer. Plus the updates on those were a joke.
Nexus5,3c0mq8,bblzd,2,Sat Jul 4 07:02:44 2015 UTC,"That's what many were saying before the Nexus 6 happened.   wants to see a premium Nexus 5 2015 device  The Nexus 6 was just overprice   Choose one.   I'll gladly save myself a couple hundred bucks for weaker speakers, weaker vibration (I lol when people judge vibration motors TBH), weaker camera, plastic casing etc. As long as they don't skimp where it really counts: display, performance and mobile signal.  Nearing 2 years and no issues with my $400 Nexus 5. Flawless GPS since day one, battery easily gets me through a day, build quality solid and all phone functions working correctly."
Nexus5,3c0mq8,bblzd,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:47:39 2015 UTC,"The Nexus 6 was initially supposed to be the Moto S. It's not even a real Nexus. It was 6"" and had a Galaxy S4 panel which was 2 years old at the time. What a fucking joke, of course it was over priced for what it was. Can you imagine what a premium Nexus 5 would be like that has proper R&D? Maybe we wouldn't see more than half this sub complain about issues like we do now.   My N5 is flawless too and I love it, but I would still rather have a premium N5 compared to the one we got 2 years ago.  Typing on my S6 feels a lot better than on the N5. Why? The motor. My gf gets full bars connection standing next to me on her Note 4 while mine is struggling to pick anything up. Why? Because of the radio. My GPS is kinda flaky while my friends' G4 is spot on. Why? Better GPS.   Someone said there were GPE decides but they still weren't a Nexus and they didn't receive proper updates like the Nexus does now."
Nexus5,3c0mq8,qverk,2,Sat Jul 4 07:01:26 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair no Nexus phone was a ""real Nexus"" until Google decided to make it one. They're all just prototype devices that may or may not get recycled as another phone if they're not chosen by Google. The only thing we can take out of that is it probably wasn't Google's idea originally to have a 6 inch Nexus.  Every OLED phone uses Samsung's old tech and that isn't going to change. Samsung will not sell their latest panel tech to competitors as it is one of the only ways their hardware can stand out. So the Nexus 6 screen had the highest quality and costing OLED panel they could have put into that device at the time.  Typing feels the best with vibration turned off completely as no amount of haptic feedback is going to make them feel like real buttons. All I need from my vibration is that it vibrates, anything else is nit picking to the extreme. I don't use ""first world problems"" very often but I think it would perfectly describe complaining about vibration motors.  Zero issues with my Nexus 5 GPS. Since I've never failed to get a lock, never lost a lock, and never had accuracy issues I fail to see how a more expensive device could improve on that. Perhaps your GPS connector was loose? In which case I would've RMA'd personally.  The radio I agree could've been better, but then there are folks in my work with Note and Galaxy devices that have the same issues I do maintaining a consistent data connection (only in our work place) so I don't think it's unique to this device.  There's either a well priced device with compromises, or an over priced device with slightly less compromises. Those are the only options available to us."
Nexus5,3c0mq8,makintoos,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:30:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah but all that is really subjective. I am sure I'm not the only one that would love to pay for a premium Nexus 5. In the end, I would still think having two is better: a cheaper model and a premium one. Because really, I want stock Android but I don't want a half assed phone."

Nexus5,3c0mq8,teunkoerts,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:51:32 2015 UTC,I think Google should follow something like what Sony did with the z3 and z3 compact. Release two phones with the same internal hardware but make one a little more premium and expensive.  A lot of people on this sub want something like the 2013 N5 because of the low price and good value.
Nexus5,3c0mq8,teunkoerts,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:41:41 2015 UTC,"In terms of speed the Nexus 5 was way more than premium, it's still really fast.

Nexus5,3bui4l,nummytreat,4,Thu Jul 2 06:49:33 2015 UTC,"Its the liquid crystals that are leaking out. You need to change the digitizer and lcd as they are glued together (you can buy it as such). Now, if its not that big of an issue, just leave it as is, but if its unusable, you can get a replacement online for like USD$60. There are many guides (text and video) online that you can follow. Look at them fully before deciding to take on the job. There is also a chance of receiving a defective replacement, so theres that to take into consideration. Having someone do it (if cheap enough) is better, but if not then it might be better to just get a replacement phone."

It is definitely on the verge to becoming unusable (beginning to glitch bizarrely, like a phantom is pressing the screen, among other things). The only cell phone repair type store we have within a certain radius would charge at least $100 just for a cracked screen, let alone the liquid crystal issue, but I will get a quote just to be sure. Money is insanely tight, so if I were unable to fix it myself or have it repaired within our budget, we'd just be phone-less for a while.   In your personal opinion, is replacing the digitizer/lcd a ""doable"" job for a hardware-foreign person as long as tutorials are strictly followed, or is it really risky to mess with?

Nexus5,3bui4l,mitchmalo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:19:43 2015 UTC,"Having replaced the display on a Galaxy Nexus and opening up my Nexus 5 I can say it is doable. You need to take into consideration some things:     find a tutorial with high quality and preferably no jump cuts (this is a good example for Galaxy Nexus) Edit: I found a video that will help you with the upper part of the phone. Try to find a display with included frame, even if it's more expensive. The frame is a piece of metal in the middle that is glued to the display and all other components screw into it. If you buy a display without a frame you will have to separate your current display from the frame and this can be tedious - you will also need to buy the adhesive tape that sticks the display to the frame. I had good results with eBay be very, very careful when opening the back cover - the plastic clips that hold it together are very easy to break. Look at the iFixit teardown to see where they are"
Nexus5,3bui4l,vladk2k,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:07:50 2015 UTC,"Here's my two cents. The job is very ""do-able"" as you ask. Go to ETradeSupply.com and they sell the screen/digitizer/frame part all put together for you for about $60-$70. Basically the entire repair process includes prying off the back plate, being careful not to break the plastic clips that keep it connected to the frame, then removing some screws, disconnecting the ribbon cables for multiple components, lifting out the battery and motherboard and other components from their respective places (note: some videos say that the battery and other parts have light adhesive keeping them on the phone, this was not the case for me. It took a bit more prying on some of them than I expected, so just be cautious to not apply too much force), then you will be left with the old frame/digitizer/lcd piece. The rest is just putting everything back into the new LCD/digitizer/frame piece in the reverse order of how you removed them previously. Took me maybe an hour or so, and so far it has been the perfect fix. Just watch lots of videos to familiarize yourself with the process. It's difficult to mess it up too bad."

Battery is better during idle but google play services tends to go nutz sometimes and drain it quickly. My favorite little fun thing was when I installed Netflix and it pulled my log in credentials from chrome. Blew my mind!

My fix (possibly only temporary) I opened up my phone and poked at the pin that gets pushed by the button trying to jiggle it around a bit.

Nexus5,3brm7e,Zak,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:13:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I was a bit shocked as well considering it was technically still rooted. Though tbh I reckon they repaired it without questions because of the potential fire risk involved... The phone did heat up so much that the metal USB connector fused with the phone port and came away from the rest of the cable.   I'm just happy they fixed it and replaced the battery as well!
Nexus5,3brm7e,gabel160,2,Thu Jul 2 00:19:53 2015 UTC,It's my impression that LG has been well-behaved about warranty service for things that are clearly hardware problems regardless of whether a Nexus 5 is rooted. I'm not surprised they fixed it out of warranty either when it's so clearly a safety issue.

Thing is, you should be wary when ordering from there, as there are a lot of fakes floating around, but as long as you're aware of that and apply the ""is it too good to be true?"" razor you should be safe.  This one looks legit to me. I've never heard of N5 fakes (who would fake a phone as old and as niche as the N5? Galaxy S series are far better options for fakers), they offer 820/821 variants (fakers are lazy, I doubt they'd go that far), the phones in the pictures look legit and the price seems reasonable for refurbished units.

Nexus5,3bqiui,nicknoxx,33,Wed Jul 1 09:44:21 2015 UTC,Nexus 5 would definitely be a worthy upgrade; it still represents great value even today.  Just don't expect much out of the screen on battery life without voodoo magic/animal sacrifice.
Nexus5,3bqiui,PolishRoulette,14,Wed Jul 1 10:20:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, my N5 got passed down to my girlfriend. And I jumped on the OnePlus One hype train. Impressions?   1: it's too big, but like anything, you get used to it  2: insane battery life, I've had it since last fall, I saw someone raving about their battery swap showing 3.5hrs of SOT, I was at 5.3hrs without any voodoo at the same percentage, this is the best feature of the phone  3: Support? What support? They apparently have bad customer service, and a sizable number of people have had issues with their touchscreen, the most recent update apparently alleviates that, at least for a good amount of people, I've never had a problem.   4: the phone is actually faster, and has a better camera than the N5  5: $250 for 16gb, $300 for 64gb  If you're OK with a big phone, and you're feeling lucky like dirty harry, I'd recommend the OnePlus One over the Nexus 5, that being said, the Nexus 5 is faster, better battery life, and better camera than the N4."

Nexus5,3bqiui,SirPribsy,2,Wed Jul 1 16:14:55 2015 UTC,"Second that. My N5 went to my flatmate and I'm on a OPO now. Battery life alone is worth it. Can't wait for the new Nexus phones in November, though, I'm so sick of CM and want to go back to stock.  I'd say, if you need a new phone now, at this second, get an OPO over the N5, the N5 is seriously dated at that price point. If you can wait I'd rather wait for the next Nexus generation.

It still keeps up really well as far as performance and handles 5.1 smoothly. Sure the battery isn't the greatest but that could also be that my phone is from 2013 and the battery is losing juice.  Honestly, what I would do, is wait to get the new Nexus line coming out this fall. The chances that they'll be cheap again seems to be likely. Maybe just pick up a 'free' phone and upgrade when the new Nexus is released?   Edit: I just saw your post about needing it now.

Nexus5,3bqiui,Preconscious,0,Wed Jul 1 14:35:03 2015 UTC,It's an upgrade from the N4 in every way. From that perspective if you liked the N4 you'll be happy with it.   You might be able to do better for the same money depending on your priorities. The G3 is available pretty cheap these days. The OnePlus One would be another good bet.

Nexus5,3bqe0o,hab1_87,10,Wed Jul 1 08:33:02 2015 UTC,"Nexus 5 has 2 different official versions of CM12. Hammerhead (the codename for Nexus 5) and HammerheadCAF.  Their difference is that the usual hammerhead uses kernel / library code from AOSP, Google. The code for this device is fairly old by now.  HammerheadCAF uses code / libraries released by Qualcomm (the manufacturer of our devices system-on-a-chip). This code is newer and more optimized, leading to arguably better performance.  I am using CAF and the added benefits of it are Ambient display (like Nexus 6) without a huge battery leak. Display color calibration. Better sound. Arguably better battery life (ymmv). And noticeably better performance.  Word of advice, if you do decide to go CAF route, then you have to use CAF compatible recovery (TWRP recovery, you have to use the unofficial variant here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/google-nexus-5/orig-development/recovery-twrp-2-7-1-0-touch-recovery-t2511507/post61523386#post61523386) and you cannot use custom kernels unless they are specifically CAF compatible. But I would advise using the kernel Cm12 comes with anyway.  Cons of going to CM12? Umm you kinda have to wipe your device? You have to do a little research in how using Custom ROMs works on Android?

It's smooth as liquid and can run high graphic games like a fuck (lag free).  Standby time increased to 2 days after i installed latest updates. My phone can easily survive for 3-4 hours on heavy gaming and 12 hours on normal run (internet browsing + phone calls + messages). I tried cataclysm rom but didn't impress me much.

Nexus5,3bmku9,mattsatwork,18,Tue Jun 30 12:58:43 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm using stock android with Xposed. I know there are a bunch of guys here that will vouch for flashing a rom, however there isn't one RIGHT rom, it's really up to personal preference. Same thing with kernals, personally I'm running elementalX and have the cpu running at a lower base clock and have undervolted it just a touch to help with battery. In my opinion Xposed is top dog for me just because stock android is as stable as it gets and adding Xposed to that is pretty much like getting a custom rom + much more. Gravity Box has more customizable features than Cataclysm (source: me lol) so there really isn't a point to flashing custom rom IN MY OPINION."

Nexus5,3bmku9,AMajesticOtter,2,Tue Jun 30 19:23:36 2015 UTC,"The cool thing about going stock + xposed is that YOU decide which features you want to have. If I want to have Ambient Display, then I install the respective xposed module. If I want to customize the status bar, then I get GB. It's your choice and you have only the extra features you want in your phone."
Nexus5,3bmku9,Allavaz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:39:03 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you from a practical standpoint, but admittedly there's something about flashing a really awesome new ROM and having all of these new tweaks opening up at once, discovering new features, etc. that I can't really replicate with stock + xposed. Plus I like CM Theme Manager way more than layers, personally, and for someone as hun up on aesthetics as I am that's a really big draw. That being said, this is the exception, not the rule. To date on this phone Cataclysm, Cyanide L and MAYBE Resurrection Remix are the only ROMs I'd comfortably say I prefer to stock w/ Xposed, and Catalclysm is essentially Stock+.   The ability to use Multirom to have all three on tap at once, and OTG to not pay the price of having limited memory as a result, has given me the luxury of not really having to choose between form, function or a combination of the two. This stuff is so subjective, to boot."

Nexus5,3bo91j,s_webermanjensen,5,Tue Jun 30 20:23:45 2015 UTC,"I have a N5 and a PowerBot PB1020 Qi charger (cheap, 13USD at Amazon).  They only get warm if I do not place the phone correctly centered on it, but it is more heat coming from the phone than from the charger.  My educated guess is that when both coils are not correctly aligned (there's a coil on the phone and one on the charger; high frequency AC current on the charger coil induces current on the phone coil), you end up inducing currents where you shouldn't (other metal parts in the phone), or creating useless induced currents in only a section of the phone coil (instead of circling the coil, parasite currents fighting each other on parts of the coil).  These currents in the wrong places obviously are not used to charge the battery and are dissipated as heat. In my experience, the heat appears more in the phone than in the charger. It is possible though that due to the resulting wrong impedance seen by the charger, more power is drawn from it, so it heats more too. I don't think this is significant, as the charger can only send as much power: During ""aligned"" charging of a uncharged battery, it is providing  X power, but the energy is correctly being stored in the battery. When the battery is charged, it ""tells"" the charger to power down. During ""misaligned"" charging, it is still sending X power, but part of it is being wasted as heat on the phone. So from the charger point of view, it is business as usual, and it shouldn't get warmer than usual (at least it's what it looks like is happening on mine).  When the phone is correctly aligned, I don't get more warming than in a normal, wired charging.  Alignment is so important that the original Nexus Qi Charger has 4 magnets, which ""catch"" 4 metal stubs in the N5, around the Qi coil.  I only mess with the alignment when I reach for the phone while half asleep to see the time, then place it back not awaken enough to do it right. The phone then is quite warm in the morning."
Nexus5,3bo91j,jsveiga,2,Tue Jun 30 22:06:53 2015 UTC,"I have an aftermarket Qi pad. When I first got the pad, it ran pretty hot. After awhile (8 months) i noticed that it was struggling to charge properly (like cycling on/off at the pad) and getting crazy hot. Turns out the terrible usb charger/plug they shipped with it was the cause. The base plugged into a generic looking wall usb charger.   Swapped that out and the phone/base stay cool now. Huge difference. Don't know your setup, but it could help.  *Edit: I have one of these."
Nexus5,3bo91j,beerhawk,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:08:47 2015 UTC,"If I ever get hear from my qi, is because I put it on to charge from <10%, and left the case on."
Nexus5,3bo91j,Knubinator,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:50:23 2015 UTC,So thermodynamics tells you that heat is lost energy. Heat therefore is common in every case because no process is 100% efficient. A hard cord (ie micro usb)  is known to be about 90% efficient or so. Qi on the other hand doesn't even have a physical connection between the transmitter and the receiver yet has a fairly large bit of space between the two. Because of this space there is more transmission loss in the process and thus more energy loss therefore more heat. So all in all the heat is the nature of the game.   FWIW I've tested tons of different chargers and different positions for each all with the same results even with different devices- they always heat the device up to about 110°F then cools down the last 10% or so.
Nexus5,3bo91j,iHateMyUserName2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:56:09 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that said, what I'm curious about is how you think that heat is generated and dispersed.  There's two actors in this equation, the charging base and the phone with the internalized coils to receive. I'm wondering whether it's an issue of the base generating most of the heat and it entering the phone through conduction, or if the phone internally generates a fair amount of heat simply by having the qi coil inside of it.  The reason I ask is because if I'm interested in modding my base station to have air holes to help dissipate the heat if the base station is the culprit, but if it's the phone, not a lot I can do there."
Nexus5,3bo91j,bblzd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:34:14 2015 UTC,"Both sides will feel warm, the 25% of energy that is converted to heat (Qi being only up to 75% efficient) will get absorbed into all surrounding plastics and metals.  The effective way to reduce heat would be to use a fan of some sort."
Nexus5,3bo91j,bblzd,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:18:40 2015 UTC,"Do you think a passively cooled solution might work? I was thinking of removing the coiling and circuitry from my cheapass ebay charger and making a wooden housing for it replete with larger holes to allow the dissipation of heat.   If this is an issue of the base charger being the primary source, and then conduction heating the phone, in theory such a change would heavily alleviate this issue. However, if the internal circuitry in the phone is heating up at an equal rate or generating its own heat, obviously such a solution would not work."

Nexus5,3bkerz,khyberchef,19,Tue Jun 30 18:30:06 2015 UTC,"So I forgot where I read this but it makes sense. The cables that you received in your nexus box is a 24/28 guage wire. Whenever you use a dollar store type thin wire, it uses a the 28guage wire. Even if you plug it to a 2a port it won't charge as fast as a 24guage wire. It said that 24guage is for power while 28 is for data. The cables I have are from monoprice and are 24/28 guage cables. They are solid cables and cheap but even better is that they charge pretty quickly. I have a 12ft one and it works as well as a 3ft one. In terms of the power going into the cable, just check the output amps. Some will be a 1a or 1.5a and that's fine. But for car charger I look for 2a or a 5a.   Do some research on it. This is what I found and it works for me."
Nexus5,3bkerz,ch1k,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:36:00 2015 UTC,Yep. Lower # gauge means bigger wire. Bigger wire has less resistance which in turn also allows more power in at once.

Nexus5,3bkerz,lilotimz,3,Tue Jun 30 00:24:14 2015 UTC,Yes and even wires from the same brand line can perform extremely differently depending on length.  The ever popular and cheap monoprice 3 foot one with the ferrite core is an absolute beast in both data and charging but the 6 ft and 10 ft ones leave much to be desired (i acquired all 3).   All my other random wires charge in the ~500mA to 1A range while the Anker ones  i have (1 ft / 3 ft / 6 ft) + monoprice one charges as fast as the charger allows (1.2 / 1.5 / 1.8A).

The little prongs on the microUSB end are really cheapie and the metal plug end would bend easily, so the little prongs wouldn't hold onto the device and the cables would fall out. I threw them all away."
Nexus5,3bkerz,FireBallBryan,3,Tue Jun 30 12:50:09 2015 UTC,That's weird. The standalone Anker cables are really solid. I've purchased 2 off of amazon so far and they are some of the nicest micro USB cables I have used.
Nexus5,3bkerz,twerps,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:14:10 2015 UTC,Indeed. The monoprice cables with the ferrite core + a 2.1A charger that's been modded for AC charge mode tops off my phone incredibly fast. I see 1.5% per minute vs. other chargers barely breaking even.
Nexus5,3bkerz,iHateMyUserName2,0,Tue Jun 30 13:08:32 2015 UTC,"1.5% per minute is a pretty high rate and if that's true then it has nothing to do with the cable. In order to achieve 1.5% per minute or 90% in 60 minutes, you'd have to charge at 1.8A. The only charger I know of that does this is the Blackberry charger and all the rest including stock is like 1.2 or 1.4A meaning charge rates are 0.87% and 1.01% per minute respectively. I agree though, those cables are awesome but not that awesome."
Nexus5,3bkerz,cakemuncher,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:24:11 2015 UTC,You're wrong. There are plenty of chargers that are 2.0A and up.
Nexus5,3bkerz,iHateMyUserName2,0,Tue Jun 30 16:15:48 2015 UTC,"Again, the Nexus 5 tops out at 1.2A regardless of the charger. The only control the charger has is the minimum charge rate. Ex- plug a Nexus 5 into a Nexus 7 charger (that charges at like 1.6A or whatever it is)  and it will only charge up to 1.2A."
Nexus5,3bkerz,ataturk1993,2,Tue Jun 30 16:47:54 2015 UTC,Yes.  I have a cheap cable that only manages to slow down the discharge rate when im using the phone as well.
Nexus5,3bkerz,twerps,2,Tue Jun 30 10:26:40 2015 UTC,"Yep. I have lots of cheap and many more nice heavy cables. The heavy gauge ones charge noticeably faster. Cheap chargers also suck and finding a car charger that puts the phone in AC charge mode is the difference between ""4 hours remaining"" and ""30 minutes remaining""."
Nexus5,3bkerz,AZwildcatsNT,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:06:11 2015 UTC,Makes a huge difference. I only charge my N5 with either Samsung cables or the original one it came with

Nexus5,3bkerz,TH3J4CK4L,4,Tue Jun 30 15:06:17 2015 UTC,"Not true as a rule.  It's easier to make a shorter cable of higher quality, yes, but I have some 15 inch cables that will charge at exactly the same speed as your three inch cable.  (I say exactly, because at this point the charging speed is limited by the circuitry of the phone, not the cable)  With research (AKA monoprice) it's possible to find a cheap cable of any length that will charge the phone at the full 2A that it will take."
Nexus5,3bkerz,bluenote73,3,Tue Jun 30 00:46:28 2015 UTC,Totally wrong. A cable with good gauge wire all things being equal will push more current if it's shorter.  I use a usb current gauge from ebay to test mine.
Nexus5,3bkerz,TH3J4CK4L,-1,Tue Jun 30 01:14:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, and I could use my multimeter to test mine.  Or just the current meter on my phone.  Both work.  Again, at a certain point, the phone will start to limit the current charging the battery.  You can't charge your phone at 5 amperes.  It limits it to a bit under 2, and there are long cords designed to do just that.  Sure, it is /easier/ to have a short cable transmit a greater current, but it is very possible with a long cable as well.  It really just matters the quality of the cable.  Short cables are not always better than long ones, as many times the short cables are made in low quality, with cheap materials, and will not charge as quickly as a higher quality long cable."
Nexus5,3bkerz,TheEvilPenguin,2,Tue Jun 30 03:31:12 2015 UTC,"The resistance per unit of length goes up as the wire size decreases, which is why cables with thicker power wire charge faster, but by the same reasoning a shorter cable also has less resistance.  The larger wire diameter gives a larger difference, but the length is still significant."
Nexus5,3bkerz,TH3J4CK4L,-3,Tue Jun 30 03:40:21 2015 UTC,"I'm going to just copy my comment to bluenote73 here.  Yes, and I could use my multimeter to test mine.

Nexus5,3bkerz,TheEvilPenguin,2,Tue Jun 30 03:29:38 2015 UTC,"Given the large difference in the range of charging times that have been recorded for different cables and the tiny resistances involved, I guess it has more to do with the voltage drop across the cable.  If the internal resistance of the battery is low, maybe the cable resistance becomes significant.  All I know is that people have measured that higher quality cables charge a battery much faster, and the only difference between the cables is resistance.  A 6 cm low quality cable can have less resistance than a high quality 1m cable, so it seems very plausible that a 6cm should be able to charge faster a 1m cable."
Nexus5,3bkerz,cakemuncher,0,Tue Jun 30 03:41:46 2015 UTC,"A 6 cm low quality cable can have less resistance than a high quality 1m cable, so it seems very plausible that a 6cm should be able to charge faster a 1m cable.   Can, but not necessarily. The 6cm could be made of much higher resistance material (shitty material) OR much thinner than the 1m cable.  By my experience, usually ""low quality"" wires just have a smaller gauge wire than the ""high quality"" ones. That on it's own effects resistance tremendously which in turn slows down charging regardless of the length."
Nexus5,3bkerz,TheEvilPenguin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:12:44 2015 UTC,"Using the wire gauges here (24 gauge in good cables, 28 in cheap), a 1 m good cable has a resistance of 0.084 ohms and a 6 cm cheap cable has a resistance of 0.013 ohms - 85% less resistance on the cheap, short cable."
Nexus5,3bkerz,whiskey_rambler,2,Tue Jun 30 16:22:20 2015 UTC,Less voltage drop... makes sense.
Nexus5,3bkerz,U2_is_gay,5,Tue Jun 30 22:54:02 2015 UTC,Shouldn't be that severe though. 1 ft vs 10 ft is pretty negligible. You start worrying about voltage drop when you get over 100-150ft.
Nexus5,3bkerz,Elemetrix,2,Tue Jun 30 02:24:15 2015 UTC,"The best cables I've used are the Anker range. I have the full range of 1ft, 3ft, 6ft and 10ft. It's surprising just how much of the difference it makes. If I'm in a rush it's enough to make me go for the shorter cable.   Still the 10ft will perform better than the short Microsoft one you get with the Xbox One controllers."
Nexus5,3bkerz,iHateMyUserName2,0,Tue Jun 30 04:10:50 2015 UTC,"Uh yeah, no it doesn't pal. 85% of the Nexus 5's battery is 1955mAh. All that in an hour flat would require a 2A input. Now if your not familiar with how this works- the Nexus 5 is limited to either 1.2A or 1.4A input unless you're using one specific known charger- the BlackBerry charger and even that is 1.8A. Try it again and I'll bet you that it takes about 98 minutes or more."
Nexus5,3bkerz,rebola_thesequel,2,Tue Jun 30 07:13:14 2015 UTC,"Some cables, especially cheaper ones, don't have the shorted pins necessary to signal to the phone that it's hooked up to an AC charger. If you use one of these data cables, the phone will only ever draw 500mA (thinking it's hooked up to a USB supply) and charge slow as hell."
Nexus5,3bkerz,Swedophone,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:34:35 2015 UTC,The shorted pins should of course usually be located in the USB AC charger not in the USB cable. A USB cable with shorted data pins is only needed when using a nonstandard USB AC charger.
Nexus5,3bkerz,rebola_thesequel,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:58:48 2015 UTC,"That may not be the mechanism then, but some cables register only as USB on the phone even when hooked up to an AC charger. So cabling does matter."

Nexus5,3bj59h,s_jubei,2,Mon Jun 29 18:03:36 2015 UTC,Mine started acting up towards the end of April with the same issue.   A little massage and percussion therapy for the power button always resolve the issue and it occurred pretty rarely until last night.  Now it's pretty screwed up.  Pressing the power button in any way will resume the messed up state.  I have to be pretty aggressive with the button to get it out of boot loop and then very careful thereafter.  I'm not trying an app that automatically turns the screen on or off depending on the angle the phone is rotated to.    This sucks :(.  I might have to buy a used N5 off of eBay to make it until the next gen Nexus 5 is released which wouldn't be a big deal for most people but I'm a poor nursing student.  I have loved this phone and have used it daily since the day it was released.  I'm in grieving but I can't imagine owning anything but a Nexus.
Nexus5,3bj59h,astrings,2,Mon Jun 29 23:59:55 2015 UTC,"Do you use a case? If so you might be able to remove the power button on the case, and install Gravityscreen. This will prevent you from having to use the power button every time you want to look at your phone.   I had the issue multiple times. even though I reported it to google during warranty (and it started working again) they wouldn't do anything about it after the warranty expired. I've got a power button in my amazon cart, ready to replace once I can scrounge up enough cash to know I can replace the phone if I screw it up. in the mean time Gravityscreen works pretty well."
Nexus5,3bj59h,mattsatwork,2,Tue Jun 30 00:46:31 2015 UTC,This happened to me 3days ago after researching it seems banging the phone on a table was the most popular solution and it worked for me

Nexus5,3bixew,rebrain,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:41:54 2015 UTC,"Your grill is clogged, I had this exact problem. You could take a small gauge wire and try to unclog each earpiece hole directly, but you will just be pushing the dirt inside and I'm not sure that is such a good idea. I am personally more technically inclined so I took my phone apart and cleaned the grill holes one by one, reassembled everything and the problem was gone! The only issue was that there is some sort of fabric filter that I had to break apart on the inside of the grill to be able to reach the holes. I replaced it with some cotton wool afterwards to keep the dirt out, so far so good :-D   You could also take it to a professional if you don't feel at ease doing what I described.  For some reason, when you lie in bed and cover the top microphone that is used for noise cancelling, the phone decides your voice is noise and filters it out. The only solution I found was changing my position. Good luck and let me know how it turns out!"

Nexus5,3bixew,tudy77,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:13:28 2015 UTC,"Yup, that speaker is the one I am talking about. The one on the front side of the phone above the screen. It has some fine holes in the grill on top of the speaker that get all clogged up by dust and dirt and pocket lint and sweat and whatnot, up to the point where you don't hear the other person at all anymore. Said dirt needs to be removed.  What gave it away was the fact that I could hear the other person better through the back-cover than through the front grill :-) that meant the speaker itself was fine, just that the sound did not get to me."

I mean it's kind of in their interest to make sure their phones don't last too long including their batteries.   I'm not saying this is not fake but there is regularly some minor improvements of batteries over time. It's always dangerous to try these cheap new batteries but it may be worth it.

Nexus5,3bfnpk,Zak,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:44:08 2015 UTC,"are we sure Samsung and other are really trying to pack the most energy in their battery?   Reasonably. The pouch cells used in current flagship phones have a little less volume than cylindrical 18650 cells. The best of those are 3400 mAh. Panasonic was selling some claiming 3600 mAh, but they didn't deliver. The market for 18650s is highly competitive, in large part because Tesla uses them in its electric cars. If Tesla could get 3600 mAh cells instead of 3400, they would have a 90 kWh car instead of 85, and they are very motivated to do so.

You can see on a daily basis people talking about ""rewraps"" So i can see your point.   Though the nexus 5 isn't really a modern flagship anymore, so is the battery inside it.   I know batteries didn't really evolved that much in two years. But there is a lot of revolutionary techs announced every few months. And sometime a simple improvement in the way a battery is discharging can have a dramatic effect on autonomy (see batteriser, extremely simple tech, extremely effective).   So appart from risking seeing your phone dramatically burst into flame it could be worth trying for an end of life device."
Nexus5,3bfnpk,Zak,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:23:21 2015 UTC,"And sometime a simple improvement in the way a battery is discharging can have a dramatic effect on autonomy   Well, there was just a recent announcement about Samsung discovering tech to nearly double Li-ion capacity, but it hasn't been commercialized yet and probably won't show up first in cheap knock-off batteries.   see batteriser, extremely simple tech, extremely effective   That's just a boost converter. Hooking that up to a Li-ion ahead of the circuitry that should cut it off when it's discharged to its minimum will over-discharge it, which can cause an internal short next time it's charged. Internal shorts in Li-ion batteries are exciting.  Using it with alkaline or NiMH batteries might make sense, but many devices that use those already have a boost converter. Over-discharging alkalines makes them leak goo that damages electronic devices, so I don't really recommend that either. I'm having trouble thinking of devices that are good candidates for using these... maybe old or really cheap flashlights."

Nexus5,3bfgkj,WonSuperDude,4,Sun Jun 28 19:23:23 2015 UTC,"Be careful. I bought a Nexus 5 battery from the very same dealer roughly a week ago.  The new battery had the same performance as yours, noticeably longer lifespan (2 days with light use) and had an easy 4 hour SOT before out of nowhere it started malfunctioning. The battery itself did not die immediately, what happened was that the sensors stopped working and the battery wouldn't charge when plugged in. When it drained down to 39%, I thought a quick reboot would help but I was stuck in a bootloop that wouldn't fix itself until I went back to my old original battery.  I am still in need of a battery so I requested a return/replacement.  Maybe we're just playing the lottery here when it comes to batteries."

The damn thing crapped out on me within a week.  I decided to pick up a cheapo phone to get me through until next gen of n5 comes out. Didn't want to drop 600+ on a phone that I knew I would hate (n6 is too fuckin big, m9 is nice, but $$$ and Sense isn't my thing, and I just don't like the galaxy line)  Well. I went out and dropped $200 on a BLU Vivo Air. This phone is 90% straight mediocre, and 10% awesome.  SUPER light and SUPER thin.  Not much ram, slower than the n5 noticeably sometimes. But it works and its cheap. 200 unlocked, and it works good enough to get me through til oct/Nov when the new n5 comes out, and I'm happy.

So far the words are all typing instantly and there's no lag so I better keep typing to see how long it takes. Nope still nothing seems to be working fine. Pretty weird since I actually recall having the same issue you described writing long Reddit posts, but usually they get much longer than this so I have to keep typing. No input lag whatsoever just yet. By the way I'm using the US version of the Google keyboard so I'm not sure how much of a difference that would make, I always figured that would only affect the predictive text. Now that I think about it I should probably start using the UK version since I live in Canada. But anyway at this point I'm still not getting any input lag so maybe it is just a problem with the UK version. What's the difference between the two anyway? Is it just the predictive text or do you get some different symbols or something? Anyway at this point I'm starting to notice some input lag when I type as fast as I can but it's not that unbearable.

Powering back on would result in random power figures from 1% up to about 15% and usually the cycle would start again only much sooner. All of this without any warning that the battery was going 'critical'.

I believe it's the battery causing the issue. My experience says that warm batteries, especially ones that are old or faulty, won't be able to push enough current for the phone to stay on. In some cases they still have a reasonable voltage so the battery percentage is reading moderately full.  Also, I don't experience the problem when charging. Do you have the same?

Charge for half a second and then stop, then charge again, then stop. It does this on a continuous cycle, or it doesn't charge at all. I figured shutting off the phone and letting it milk its way up to 100% would be fine with me, however it reads shows the full battery with the lightning symbol, then starts with the battery charging symbol then shuts off and repeats this cycle. The battery does not charge during this. Any help would be so, so appreciated."

Within Storage settings, tap the menu icon to bring up the options to select 'USB computer connection', such as Media Device (MTP) or Camera (PTP).  You'll want to use MTP for transferring files to/from your internal SDCard.  If this doesn't help, you can use USBDeview to view and manually cleanup the USB devices associated to your phone in case it is driver related:  http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb_devices_view.html  It's a handy util that came bundled with Wugfresh's Nexus Root Toolkit which helped me cleanup and correct my Android USB devices when things got messed up, for whatever reason (i.e. managing multiple Nexus 5/7 devices)."

Nexus5,3b9swo,jpdb,3,Sat Jun 27 04:39:48 2015 UTC,"The USBDeview application doesn't do any sort of automatic cleanup for you.  You would use USBDeview to ""Uninstall Selected Devices"" that have been already recognized and added to your system.    For my Nexus 5, the devices show up with a Vendor ID of ""18d1"" (Google Inc.).  Of these devices, you can have multiple ""Product ID"" values which can represent the different states your Nexus 5 might be in:  e.g.   4ee1 = MTP  4ee2 = ADP?  d001 = fastboot?  Note: product ids may also be shared by Nexus 4, Nexus 10, etc.?  See the USB ID Repository for some more examples:  http://www.linux-usb.org/usb-ids.html  For Vendor ID 18d1:  https://usb-ids.gowdy.us/read/UD/18d1  I've added a small album showing some of what I'm trying to describe here:  http://imgur.com/a/UN5NC  You can follow the steps from the ""Full Driver Configuration Guide"" instructions provided in WugFresh's Nexus Root Toolkit (very handy Nexus utility) for doing the drive and USB device cleanup, followed by driver re-install."

Nexus5,3b9swo,jpdb,3,Sat Jun 27 05:51:28 2015 UTC,"You'd still need to perform the driver cleanup via Device Manager and uninstall drivers, however USBDeview also allows you to remove the USB devices/connections your computer has previously learned too.  It's adds visibility to the USB configuration that wasn't otherwise available, unless you resorted to using RegEdit to clean up USB devices after something goes wrong (shudder).  This type of cleanup is something I've had to do a few times, probably because I use my computer to manage my wife's and my Nexus 5's and 7's, and using multiple similar devices across multiple USB ports is probably just enough to confuse Windows..."

Couldn't wait until November and the new processors are as near as makes no difference identical with the performance, so an 801 will do me fine, as will the 'only' 1080p screen. The biggest test, I guess, is how it feels compared to my Nexus."

Nexus5,3b6n6d,itili,4,Fri Jun 26 12:00:39 2015 UTC,"The Nexus 5 cannot boot without a battery, even when connected to an AC adapter.  If the temperature sensor went bork, you might want to check if the battery connector on the motherboard is broken. Mine was and I had to retire my Nexus 5 after 1.5 years of service :(  Also, the new battery that you got should be fake. AFAIK only LG and Sony batteries are used but not Samsung.  Edit: some background info about the rising number of malfunctioning temperature sensors - for the N5, the sensor is located in the battery. Usually, even fake batteries have properly functioning sensors. However, when people replace their batteries on their own, they are not aware that the adhesive removed during the removal of the original battery is extremely important and neglect its replacement. This causes the battery to undergo excessive movement, especially during drops, resulting in the breakage of the battery connector and the phone being unable to communicate with the temperature sensor. Unfortunately, the battery connector is part of the motherboard and is probably difficult to replace.  TL:DR - your battery connector is probably broke. RIP Nexus 5"

Nexus5,3b6n6d,nckb,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:52:42 2015 UTC,"Your situation seems like mine a few months ago! Here's what you should do to prevent your nexus 5 from dying:   Your old battery has some existing adhesive on it, so it shouldn't move too much within the case and the connector should be fine for now.  The battery connector is very very fragile!! Use a spudger or a flat stick to remove the plug in a vertical motion so that you prevent it from breaking or becoming loose. Get your battery from a reputable seller. Ebay is notorious for fakes (2 fakes in 2 purchases!!) and you absolutely shouldn't get your battery there. I heard etradesupply sells genuine batteries but can't confirm it. Purchase some adhesive (thin, double sided tape, about 5mm wide?) to secure your battery to the phone. There should be some black tape markings on the device assembly to indicate where the tape goes. If your battery connector somehow got broken, take a look at this xda thread to see what you can do.    Hope this helps keep your N5 alive! Don't want the same thing to happen to others."

Nexus5,3b4kaz,pigiron_boulder,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:17:07 2015 UTC,"If some chargers do it and others not while they are all the same rating, that seems unlikely to be software. I'm not an expert in electronics components or DC, but I do have a decent background in electricity (I was an Engineer for FirstEnergy for a while) and can tell you that even if the voltage and amperage are the same, there can be significant differences in the quality of the signal and how it stresses devices. It's most obvious in moving cyclical things like a fan, where an imbalance in your circuit design for vars create vibration giving inefficieny and shorter service life. Vars themself won't be the case here (they are an AC force only if memory serves me right), but without someone more knowledgeable chiming in I wouldn't assume there isn't a higher function effecting our chargers as well."

Nexus5,3b5f6f,evilf23,2,Sat Jun 27 13:31:46 2015 UTC,Not sure if this is the same as my problem. but I had similar things going on with my N5 with strange battery usage stats. Do you find that your % drops suddenly but also it appears to charge to full very quickly. I also noticed points when my % power dropped then increased again without any recharging. It turned out my battery was damaged. Noticed it first when a gap appeared between the back plate and the rest of the phone body. The battery was noticeably swollen. Got a replacement battery online and followed some simple youtube guides on how to change the battery myself and now everything is back to normal. Hope this helps.

I didn't find anything on google anyway.   I didn't expect LG to do it for free haha, but I mean if it's going to cost about the same as etradesupply, give or take a few dollars, I'd rather just send it to them, that way I know I'm getting a good replacement. (Or at least I should be)  The other thing I was thinking last week was, I'm with Koodo Mobile, I was hoping they'd have Nexus 6's that I could get on a tab and just pay so much a month towards it instead of replacing my Nexus 5 screen, but they don't have those. I COULD however, get a replacement Nexus 5 on a tab with them, which isn't very economical in the long run, because it's an extra $360 over however long, but it would work in the short since it's only $15/mo added to my bill. Either way I can't really flat out buy a new phone. Not a good one at least."
Nexus5,3b5cnx,nullrinzler,2,Fri Jun 26 03:04:29 2015 UTC,"Well, I've only been to Nova Scotia once. Beautiful place. But I digress. If you're looking to replace it, you might also consider an LG G3. The price from Koodo is around the same as a Nexus 5, if I'm reading the website properly (4th year with them and I still can't using properly -.-). I might be mistaken. In which case, ignore this whole part up to this bold series of words Another Nexus 5 is cool too, if that's your cup of tea. But if you got another, even it would start to show it's age by next year or later this year even. Then again, you could just give LG a call and deal with paying for them to fix it."
Nexus5,3b5cnx,barriecary,2,Fri Jun 26 05:05:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm going to call LG tomorrow I think and get a quote. If it's too much I'm probably just gonna 'lease' another N5 or G3 from Koodo. I'm not overly worried about having a dated phone, because really, I wasn't really planning to replace my current N5 until it completely died. I did have a look at the G3 earlier and asked a friend about it. I'll have to read up on it a bit more, because the whole reason that I bought a N5 in the first place was because of how easy it is to root it and do basically whatever I want with it. I'm not sure if the G3 would be the same, but it does look like really nice phone, that's for sure."

Nexus5,3azov3,1__________,2,Thu Jun 25 03:55:41 2015 UTC,You don't need root if use adb to change the density. I personally use 445 but I've seen a lot of people use really low numbers <400 but that's way too small. You could just play around with it until you get where you want that's what I'd do.
Nexus5,3azov3,LeLocle,2,Wed Jun 24 20:32:37 2015 UTC,I'm at 390 and enjoy it :D. What do you find too small?

Nexus5,3azov3,jimbob320,2,Thu Jun 25 04:42:49 2015 UTC,"400 adds another row/column to the Google launcher, 445 would be the native screen DPI and makes things a tad smaller. I recommend trying a few as I never knew how much I wanted 400 until I tried it."

Nexus5,3azov3,openforbusiness69,4,Thu Jun 25 07:01:42 2015 UTC,adb shell wm density 'x' && adb reboot  where 'x' is the desired ppi.
Nexus5,3azov3,deepfriedchril,2,Wed Jun 24 22:15:36 2015 UTC,"Edit your build.prop with the new ppi as well. Some apps like to cause problems if only one of these values are set, for example SwiftKey."

Nexus5,3azr7k,Simply_Mad,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:16:46 2015 UTC,TWRP 2.8.5 had a showstopping bug that made it unreliable for installing. Maybe that's what you have installed?
Nexus5,3azr7k,nrq,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:52:21 2015 UTC,TWRP 2.8.5 is 4 and a half months old by now (there was quite the 3 month gap between 2.8.6 and 2.8.7).  Nevertheless it's of course still a possibility that this is what's casting the problem. It would be kinda dumb not first trying to update to the latest version of TWRP to see if it fixes the problem. Again though OP didn't mention what TWRP version s/he used (though that's definitely something that's worth mentioning regardless).

Nexus5,3b1oru,mitchmalo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:30:41 2015 UTC,"Yes I did, the LCD/glass/digitizer/front frame all come put together. All you basically have to do is remove the battery cover (the back plate with the nexus logo), remove some screws holding plastic covers, unhook and remove the battery, remove some electronics (motherboarrd, display driver flex cables, etc), then peel out smaller parts (both cameras, speakers, etc), and add them to the new housing but in reverse order. Its super simple with respect to other kinds of cell phones (looking at you iPhone 6...).   As for the motherboard, if I were you I would honestly open up the phone first and take a look at it. I'd assume that you've had the phone for over a year and its out of warranty, so there's no reason to be afraid to open up the phone. The motherboard is easily accessed, so if you have the tools and know how to YouTube some videos of people taking it apart (or use the iFixit teardown), then you can look at the motherboard fairly easily to see if there is any damage. Just make sure you disconnect the battery as soon as you have access to it, will prevent you from shorting anything out or causing issues."

So I tried all the fixes and nothing would work. Then I decided to cut my losses and flash the factory images and lose all my data. That didn't work either.

Nexus5,3avgbq,bblzd,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:44:04 2015 UTC,A larger battery can still drain itself within a couple hours when you have this type of issue. What you need to do is find out what software is draining the battery abnormally.  Did you think people with 3000mAh batteries don't complain about battery issues? You will always find people who are having issues with their battery no matter how large the pool size is. Even the devices that are known high battery performers have hundreds of folks like yourself making these same topics because anyone can run into these issues and having 700mAh extra battery pool doesn't make even make the slightest difference if you are.
Nexus5,3avgbq,bblzd,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:31:07 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I don't think anything abnormal is draining my battery. I think it's either an old battery, or its Lollipop itself.   A larger battery may drain just like my battery is, but at least it would last longer. That's my point. Use brute capacity too offset these 'issues' that are constantly plaguing our phones, and always will. I'd call it being prepared for the inevitable.   Of course people will always complain, even if they have a Droid Turbo. But it's generally accepted that the Nexus 5 has a pretty small battery, and that battery life is pretty shitty."

(Find it in settings > battery > screen)  You should be getting at least 2 to 3 hours, if not a bit more with such a new phone.  You have a few options.  The easiest (but maybe most aggravating) way would be to wipe your phone back to factory and start fresh.  If you've been syncing with google, it should be painless to get everything (like contacts, and even apps) back to your phone.  See what happens for a few days without installing too many new apps.  If that fixes everything then great!  Try to be careful next time when installing apps.  If it doesn't, then your physical battery is broken.  If you're still under warranty, give it a shot.

Nexus5,3atujg,Mizun0h,3,Tue Jun 23 13:42:50 2015 UTC,"I always recommend:   Checking your battery in settings. When charging, it will say whether it's charging on wireless, on AC, or on USB. This won't tell you what the actual current is, but it gives you an indication of whether your charger/cable combination is allowing it to charge at its full AC rate. Checking/changing your power adapter. Checking/changing your USB cable."
Nexus5,3atujg,LickItAndSpreddit,2,Tue Jun 23 14:36:27 2015 UTC,"From a 1.8A Blackberry charger, 1.8A power bank or 2.1A car charger using a good cable, a bit over 2 hours from dead to full. The factory charger takes longer. It also takes longer if it's running something power-hungry like GPS navigation.  A likely problem is that your combination of charger and USB cable is being detected as a data-capable connection and the phone is slowing down the charge rate so as to not disrupt data communication. System monitoring apps like Elixir2 can tell you whether it's in USB mode or AC mode and the rate at which it's charging or draining the battery. Around 1000ma is the full-speed charging rate, so if it's in AC mode and you're not getting that, the charger or cable is inadequate.  If it's in USB mode, you can get it in to AC mode using a charge-only cable, a different adapter or a third-party kernel and configuration tool that lets you select in software. FKU supports this, as does Cyanogenmod."

Nexus5,3as8mr,bblzd,2,Tue Jun 23 15:44:06 2015 UTC,"I had this problem. It's just the phone. I got so sick of my gf who lived 800 miles away at the time, not understanding anything I'm saying, and having to repeat myself so much that I got a moto x 2014. It's everything I wish my n5 was. That's my hardware mod. A new phone. I was so excited for the n5 too. I got it launch day in white 32 gigs and now it collects dust in my computer desk. Also the camera stopped focusing and started clicking just out of the 1 year warranty which is when I bought my moto x. Very cheaply made phone, even considering the price."
Nexus5,3as8mr,fivdd,2,Tue Jun 23 21:12:34 2015 UTC,"Hear me out here, but are you using the phone on your right ear? If so, try switching it to the other side to your left. The microphone of the phone is on the bottom right of the phone, so I'm assuming that something with noise cancellation comes into play when you don't speak directly into the bottom right of the phone. I haven't had any more issues ever since I've started doing this."
Nexus5,3as8mr,eddied96,2,Fri Jun 26 04:00:22 2015 UTC,I'll definitely try this. Thanks for the advice.

Nexus5,3aq2n8,Willy-FR,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:10:30 2015 UTC,"Why do you do that? It seems to me that something's wrong if you benefit from rebooting often.  Not to imply that something isn't wrong. Lollipop, from 5.0 to 5.1.1 has been consistently bad about not leaving enough memory free. When it gets down below about 250mb free, everything becomes slow, choppy and unresponsive. This has been true with both the stock ROM and CM12.1, and with stock, Franco and CM kernels. Rebooting or killing memory-hungry background apps fixes it.  The cause seems to be that Lollipop has disabled the kernel's low memory killer module by removing read permission from its configuration files in /sys/module/lowmemorykiller/parameters. Making these files readable for all and writable for root (chmod 644) enables it again. I also configured it to start killing background apps when there's less than 384mb free by changing the last value in the configuration file 'minfree' to 98304. There's an app that's supposed to let you configure this without poking around the filesystem yourself, but it crashes on launch for me."
Nexus5,3aq2n8,koibunny,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:02:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll check out that app. I'm a power user, I tether, and open up about 40 Google Chrome tabs, just got addicted to MK X and much more. For a normal person rebooting isn't necessary,  but for me it is."
Nexus5,3aq2n8,infinitevalence,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:18:26 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from, but I think needing to reboot often is still a sign of something not quite as it should be. It may not be something you can fix any other way though.  I'd like to hear if the app works for you. I'm thinking it has compatibility issues with newer versions of Android and might be inclined to write a replacement."
Nexus5,3aq2n8,thechilipepper0,8,Tue Jun 23 17:30:44 2015 UTC,"Francisco Franco has a lightweight app called ""SimpleReboot"" that gives you the same advanced reboot menu that comes with CM & Gravitybox. It's good for users who want to be low-impact on power buttons that have a certain reputation for failure."
Nexus5,3aq2n8,rogowin,14,Mon Jun 22 20:18:15 2015 UTC,Have you tried turning it off and on again?
Nexus5,3aq2n8,thechilipepper0,11,Mon Jun 22 22:11:47 2015 UTC,I'm guessing because generally—particularly with a non-rooted phone—it just isn't likely to be used. I can't recall restarting my Nexus 5 in months..
Nexus5,3aq2n8,quietyoufool,5,Mon Jun 22 20:21:24 2015 UTC,"Not only that but it implies that the device might require a reboot.  I would be willing to bet its in-part a marketing decision.  Does apple have a reboot?  If not, that is telling."

That was true of the N5 as well, but Google's strategy with the Nexus brand has never been to compete head on for mass market share. Maybe that's not Sony's strategy either, but I can't imagine why it shouldn't be.  One correction I just noticed: the Z3c does take a hit in terms of RAM relative to the Z3: 2gb instead of 3gb.

Band 12, T-Mobile's 700mHz spectrum they bought from Verizon with funds AT&T gave them after the failed merger, is now being implemented all over the country.  The iPhone 6, Moto X, Nexus 5 and many other 2014 and 2015 phones lack this band.  Phones that have it are rare, but more are coming out.  Examples are the GS6, Note 4 and Nexus 6.  I giggle when poor OnePlus One owners complain they can't get any rural service on T-Mobile, only to learn their phone lacks Band 2 LTE - which is the vast majority of T-Mobile's rural LTE service.  The HTC One M8 was a disaster for T-Mobile.  It was unable to use AWS 3G, which was the vast majority of T-Mobile's 3G network before they refarmed it to PCS to make room for LTE.  Next up is more AWS spectrum and a large 600mHz auction.  I'm sure, once they're bought, they'll be released as fast as they can on T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and regional carriers as well.  Care to wager?"
Nexus5,3anxxt,roadrunnersk,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:50:43 2015 UTC,"Tech upgrades aside, you are saying that the nexus 5 will be a paperweight, unable to obtain network connectivity in major metropolitan areas such as New York and Los Angeles on T-Mobile, by say, August 1st, 2017?  Or are you saying there is / will be a band that it's incompatible with?  Depending on the specific terms of the wager, I may be willing to bey a hundred bucks, sure."
Nexus5,3anxxt,dcdttu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:15:45 2015 UTC,"In New York, you often can't connect to LTE when you're in a building because T-Mobile's network used to only use high-frequency bands for their LTE.  The deployment of Band 12, that the Nexus 5 can't do, is helping with that.  So in a sense, yes.  In 2017, and now, the Nexus 5 could be a paperweight if you try to use it and don't have all of T-Mobile's bands on your phone.  100% paperweight, all the time?  No.  Of course it won't be 100% incompatible with T-Mobile's network.  But I never said that, and to even think that is a little silly.  T-Mobile currently uses 3 LTE bands for LTE.  By 2017, T-Mobile could be using 5 different bands for their LTE.  The Nexus 5 only supports two of those 3 or 5 bands.    Things don't just stop working one day, it's not that black and white.  You know that.  I, personally wouldn't want to be using a device in 2017 that only connects to 2/5ths of the LTE bands my carrier uses.  Would you?"

I read up a little on it here:http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/8/is-it-appropriate-to-use-short-form-of-have-ve-when-it-means-possession  In short, the problem is that you used ""I've"" as the main verb, like ""I've it"". If you used it as the secondary verb, like ""I've got it"", where the main verb is 'got' instead of the shortened 'have', then it sounds natural.  Also, this is only specific to American English. According to that link, what you said would sound fine in British English (but I'm American so I can't confirm).  English is a weird beast and there are subtle differences between American and British, so Americans will tell you that you're wrong but it's just British, and vice versa."

I also watched a few different youtube videos. the hardest part is taking the back cover off without breaking the tabs in the middle of the phone, and just use a blow dryer on low heat to soften the tape that holds the bottom of the back cover on.   Edit: looking again at the ifixit link, the speaker looks super easy to replace. pops right out!"

I disagree with the sentiment that Google is trying to kill Nexus.  Android Silver was supposed to replace the Nexus program last year, but when the logistics of getting that going didn't pan out, I think Google decided it had to rush a new Nexus device to market in time to be the Lollipop flagship.  The easiest candidate to do that with was Shamu since the design and engineering work was pretty much done, Moto's mostly stock use of Android meant there probably wasn't much of a problem just going pure Android, and most importantly, Google still owned Motorola at the time."

He returned to xda but soon created another shitstorm over someone using his code and rebranding it. I guess someone did that again.   XDA non original development section is a shit-fest of people stealing other peoples code and rebranding it where-ever possible. I honestly don't dare to use anything from that section (after having LiquidSmooth during the ICS days on GNex - oh god, I got banned from Rootzwiki for pointing out that the ROM was just a huge pile of rebranded code from CM and AOKP all piled together. In setting there were 3 separate menus for changing the notification bar toggles because CM and AOKP had different ways of doing it - none of them worked. Their default ""Liquid Launcher"" was just copy pasted Trebuchet launcher from CM. So forth. And people circlejerk around that shit, thinking it's the greatest thing ever.)

For unlocking, I use gravity screen, which works surprisingly good and I have noticed no visible battery drain so far. I turned off the gravity sensor and only use the proximity sensor. It's quite awesome - the phone wakes up when I move my hand above the sensor at the top, so not only do I omit using the power button, but can also do a hand gesture kind of similar to what Moto x offers (not as good of course, because you have to move your hand much closer, but it's still very convenient to check notifications this way). I'm impressed how reliable this app has been so far. It's not something that works 9 times out of 10, leaving you frustrated (like some lame implementations of tap to wake, for instance I have checked my friends one m8 and it wouldn't always wake up), it just works."
Nexus5,3ao432,Satanmymaster,2,Mon Jun 22 05:16:44 2015 UTC,"I use an app called Screen Off and Lock which will let you tap the icon to shut the screen off instead of using the power button every time. I don't use Google Now, so I configure the swipe up motion from home button to screen off and lock. You can set Greenify to hibernate and lock the screen using the same motion. Also, I install Quick Reboot, so I can restart the phone and even reboot into recovery, ect. without needing the power button. I generally only have to use my power button to wake the device now, so I am below 50% normal usage."

If you're rooted (or plan to root), there are several choices for backing up. Many people swear by Titanium Backup, but I personally prefer Backup +  The above apps will only take care of backing up your apps and app settings, though.  When it comes to music, photos, and everything else, backing up from USB storage should suffice. You could even do it wirelessly over your network via Samba (basically Windows file sharing) or a specialized app. Many file managers support Samba, including (but not limited to) ES File Explorer and my favourite, Solid Explorer  TLDR; Might not be as simple as iOS, but it's certainly possible."

Nexus5,3aj2yu,masterpat98,3,Sat Jun 20 18:04:20 2015 UTC,I think the back light of the screen takes up more battery than the rendering of the lower resolution.
Nexus5,3aj2yu,xSoulsaber,8,Sat Jun 20 23:29:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think there would be, because the screen is still pushing the same resolution. UI elements would just be larger if you changed the DPI."
Nexus5,3aj2yu,jw12321,3,Sat Jun 20 18:16:05 2015 UTC,Not the DPI. I mean the real resolution.   For 720p you can do that with    wm size 720x1280
Nexus5,3aj2yu,PabloVermicelli,4,Sat Jun 20 18:22:38 2015 UTC,"This is correct, your battery still has to light up all the pixels of your screen, so it wouldn't really make that much of a difference"
Nexus5,3aj2yu,jw12321,12,Sat Jun 20 18:21:38 2015 UTC,But the graphics processor only has to render a quarter amount of pixels in comparison to 1080p.
Nexus5,3aj2yu,analogpixel,5,Sat Jun 20 18:31:05 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea. I think it might save a bit of battery life, but I would imagine not much. Maybe you could run some tests and see if there's a noticeable difference? Would be nice to know."

Nexus5,3alkdh,gaeuvyen,2,Sun Jun 21 12:29:57 2015 UTC,Both have good cameras. I'd say the iPhone 5c is slightly better. Battery life? iPhone wins.
Nexus5,3alkdh,gaeuvyen,-1,Sun Jun 21 13:46:28 2015 UTC,"According to most reviews the talk times for both the iphone 5c and the nexus 5 are 10 and 17 respectively (that's 10 for the iphone and 17 for the nexus 5). Now I'm going to go out on a limb and say that both of those numbers are incorrect as I've used both, and neither of them has had those kind of hours even idle (when stock, when I modded the phone they lasted a lot longer). Now going by the actual hardware, the nexus 5 has a better battery as it has a bigger capacity While the iphone has a smaller capacity. Therefore battery life then comes to other hardware on the phone, as well as software that will use more of those resources. The iphone 5c has less RAM, and a more efficient CPU. Whereas the nexus 5's cpu can get higher speeds at the cost of using more power. So the battery life under normal usage of the phone without doing anything too intense would go to the nexus 5 seeing as it has a better battery, however under full load the nexus 5 would drain much faster than the iphone will."
Nexus5,3alkdh,Dunk_13,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:09:30 2015 UTC,"What works in a lab may not be applicable in the real world, because battery usage differs between person to person.

Nexus5,3alkdh,Dannyseed,2,Mon Jun 22 15:57:02 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on your thinking.  I'm also in the midst of an N5 repair scenario.  There seem to be a lot of similar stories out there many which reflect some not so great design decisions by LG, ie screen breaks easily, power button is flaky and for me(and many others) it is the Sandisk flash chip which just one day went permanently read only - the N5 won't boot.  On top of this there is the issue you mention when the OS is upgraded - maybe battery related or the flash again.  It's too bad, the phone was good value, I really liked it.  Mine was two weeks out of warranty when my flash issue occurred.  Google said too bad, LG(Canada) has been helpful but there is a wrinkle with mine in that I broke my screen ~4 months ago and repaired it myself.  I work with electronics so I really liked being able to get parts do the repair.  Unfortunately with this flash issue the CPU boards seem hard to find.  Now LG's repair center, FutureTel, noticed this screen repair and is now being a pain - even though I don't want it replaced - it works great.  I'm not an Apple fan boy but this experience is making me think that Apple has a significant leg up in the the customer service department over most if not all of the Android phones."

Nexus5,3alkdh,Toastbuns,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:08:03 2015 UTC,"And lose the benefits of a smaller phone? No thanks.  Either way, this is most likely a software issue. Only started happening with the latest update. A thousand other owners can corroborate this."
Nexus5,3alkdh,gaeuvyen,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:44:42 2015 UTC,so just flashed a clean image from the developer page? Back when my N5 was on kit kat I had some weird issues so I flashed a fresh image and my phone has been bug free.
Nexus5,3alkdh,Toastbuns,2,Sun Jun 21 13:56:03 2015 UTC,I'll give it a shot. KitKat was the best.
Nexus5,3alkdh,flamingspartan3,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:00:13 2015 UTC,Yeah no issues tho here with 5.1.1 but a clean system image would fix most bugs. And try using an OEM charger and not a janky weird one.
Nexus5,3alkdh,notstarboard,2,Sun Jun 21 14:02:31 2015 UTC,All you need is a USB cord that isn't wired improperly. USBs are standardized and the one that comes with the nexus 5 isn't some special one.
Nexus5,3alkdh,rainydayseveryday,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:11:09 2015 UTC,"While I wish this were true there does seem to be a difference from a 30 cent cheap Chinese USB cable and a quality made USB cable, at least from my anecdotal experience."
Nexus5,3alkdh,SuminderJi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:55:39 2015 UTC,"That's because the chinese one probably has spotty wire work. Well I guess the connector port could make the quality different too, but again that doesn't mean the one provided by google is some special alloy they patented, at least I don't think it is."
Nexus5,3akxs3,Aperson3334,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:24:18 2015 UTC,Ballistic cases have served me well.  Magpul also makes a pretty solid one.
Nexus5,3akxs3,kapyrna,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:00:04 2015 UTC,"2nd vote for magpul, dropped my phone many times no issues so far"
Nexus5,3akxs3,openist,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:29:31 2015 UTC,"Ballistic SG Maxx case is what has held my nexus 5 for the last year. I'm a blue collar guy, and work in the field, and have dropped my phone several times over the year. The first few, I cringed...now, I just expect the sg maxx case to keep me safe. Its a good case. I also use a film screen protector in place of the heavy piece of plastic covering for the screen."
Nexus5,3akxs3,ZApophis,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:23:26 2015 UTC,Definitely Ballistic.
Nexus5,3akxs3,vinsnob,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:30:56 2015 UTC,I've used a Ringke Fusion case for 18 months now and the phone is still in good condition.
Nexus5,3alhdp,Dashpops351,2,Sun Jun 21 11:09:45 2015 UTC,"Flash stock with NRT. You probably weren't stuck in the bootloop the first time, when you boot after installing a rom, it takes a while to boot up for the first time, from 5 to more than 10 minutes. Just use NRT and flash latest stock rom, you won't need any instructions, it's all simple."
Nexus5,3alhdp,marrecar,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:16:51 2015 UTC,"I know it takes a long time to boot, I left it on over night;p I was in a boot loop for sure."

Nexus5,3ai4j4,toelzstudios,2,Sat Jun 20 11:56:18 2015 UTC,I cut a super small piece of scotch tape and applied to non chip side if the Sim card. Acts like a shim. Haven't had the problem since.
Nexus5,3ai4j4,sasquatches,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:13:39 2015 UTC,This. I used the sticky part of a post it note.
Nexus5,3ai4j4,7834,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:28:11 2015 UTC,It worked. It just made a call which lasted seven minutes! whohoo Thank you guys!
Nexus5,3ai4j4,Garandhero,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:22:04 2015 UTC,I get this sometimes too
Nexus5,3ai4j4,baalsitch,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:14:18 2015 UTC,"A factory reset does nothing.  I've just lived with it.  I can use LTE, make calls, and text.  IDGAF, I am running CM12."
Nexus5,3ai4j4,SuminderJi,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:59:33 2015 UTC,I was getting the same thing on Chroma.  Switched ROMs and no problem yet.
Nexus5,3ai4j4,whativebeenhiding,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:41:53 2015 UTC,Same. This happened after I dropped my phone and cracked the screen. I have since replaced the screen but Im pretty sure I damaged an antenna or something.
Nexus5,3ai4j4,SashasFather,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:12:45 2015 UTC,Has it happened since?  I am having the same problem (several times a day and not always with phone calls). Rebooting seems to work for me which makes it confusing whether it is a hardware or software issue. I am running all stock and it is becoming extremely annoying.
Nexus5,3ai4j4,SashasFather,2,Mon Jun 22 10:23:13 2015 UTC,Yeah it happened today again :/ I'm gonna try another SIM.
Nexus5,3ai4j4,SashasFather,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:11:40 2015 UTC,I do believe it is a software issue related to dropping signal. I live in a converted warehouse and work in a hospital and when I lose signal from being too central to the buildings I notice it occurring around these times. Does this seem to correlate with your sim problem?
Nexus5,3ai4j4,SashasFather,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:40:29 2015 UTC,"Could be. But it also happens, when I'm outside. Did you encounter this before the last update?"
Nexus5,3agqng,jpjamo,21,Sat Jun 20 00:52:39 2015 UTC,Use this before repairing it
Nexus5,3agqng,p4block,3,Sat Jun 20 01:54:10 2015 UTC,"Could you explain why OP needs that in this situation? Genuinely don't know, myself."
Nexus5,3agqng,ABarkingCow,2,Sat Jun 20 09:19:05 2015 UTC,"It can unroot the phone from the phone itself, plus it will flip the TAMPERED and unlocked bootloader flags so the phone will appear pristine and new to LG."
Nexus5,3agqng,p4block,6,Sat Jun 20 09:46:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks /u/p4block that app worked a treat from the looks of it. Feel a bit more confident in sending it back and getting it repaired now, cheers"
Nexus5,3agqng,Elzanna,2,Sat Jun 20 13:21:39 2015 UTC,"To confirm, BootUnlocker can not unroot your phone, it simply locks/unlocks the bootloader and lets you reset the tamper flag.  To unroot you would first use BootUnlocker (while rooted) to lock the bootloader and reset the tamper flag. Then once done you can use maybe SuperSU or whatever root manager you use to unroot your phone. I am not sure how the unroot part of the process goes though, I haven't done it before."
Nexus5,3agqng,aysz88,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:19:17 2015 UTC,Cool looks like it could be exactly what i need. Will look into it more thanks
Nexus5,3agqng,PriceZombie,6,Sat Jun 20 09:45:55 2015 UTC,"I recently went shopping for the appropriate replacement - this looks like it would work.  And here's a how-to on disassembly (actually, it shows more disassembly than you need, so just do the part up to replacing that one piece).  (edit: I practiced a little disassembly, so the instructions are good, but I haven't actually ordered and replaced the part so I haven't vetted that.)"

Nexus5,3agqng,known0thing,6,Sat Jun 20 09:48:10 2015 UTC,"If you can't get it repaired then use a wireless charger. Similar thing happened to my Friend's nexus 7, they just bought a cheap 15 pound wireless charger from Amazon and use that now."
Nexus5,3agqng,GhostriderJuliett,7,Sat Jun 20 05:17:08 2015 UTC,That's pretty heavy
Nexus5,3agqng,alpain,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:57:35 2015 UTC,"Yep, the wireless charging is great. Between that and bittorrent synx I rarely ever plug my phone in nowadays."
Nexus5,3agqng,Socrateswasacowboy,4,Sat Jun 20 18:36:51 2015 UTC,They probably will. Worst case scenario they will email you saying you voided the warranty and you'll have to pay for the repairs or have it shipped back still unrepaired.
Nexus5,3agqng,Socrateswasacowboy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:31:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks, i wasn't to sure if they would keep my phone if it was rooted! I'll send it away with the battery drained and see what happens, as you say worst case they won't do the repair and just send it back"
Nexus5,3agqng,Socrateswasacowboy,3,Sat Jun 20 09:49:15 2015 UTC,"my co worker went on vacation on a Disney cruise starting/ending in Florida, he took his phone, sometime down there something happened he figures humidity but who knows maybe a combo of that plus a drop or 3?  now i have his nexus 5 which eats any USB cable you plug into it that's plugged into a computer, it charges fine when plugged into a charger, but any data connection the usb cable starts to fry where its plugged in to the phone with some nice smoke coming off it.  just got a new battery in the mail today cause i don't trust his old one and awaiting a 11 dollar board from china to replace the board when i pull his old battery out.  will of been a month in the mail soon tho but that's what you get for 11 bucks Canadian from china.  ps: anyone remember what thread recently had someone asking about dates on batteries for N5? my replacement says 2015.04.28 if anyone's wondering."

Nexus5,3agqng,heyhumpty,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:11:17 2015 UTC,Yeah it was the stock wall charger

Nexus5,3agqng,Splendiferous_,2,Sat Jun 20 14:23:40 2015 UTC,"If all else fails and LG decides to not repair your phone, opening your phone and replacing the USB port (possibly the battery as well, although I am not 100% sure what is causing the overheating) is easily doable. thankfully N5 doesn't have a lot of glued parts so opening the phone is straight forward.   Finding a USB port is a little tricky, I've previously brought a replacement USB port from etradesupply.com and it caused my monitor to stutter... looking for broken N5s for spare parts maybe a better option."
Nexus5,3agqng,gabel160,2,Sat Jun 20 02:55:58 2015 UTC,"I had approximately the same thing happen, except the charger itself overheated instead of the phone. I ended up sending it to LG and they totally ignored that it was rooted.   On the other hand, they also totally ignored my requests for a new usb cable and they took my screen protector off for no reason."
Nexus5,3agqng,Modilist,2,Sat Jun 20 05:40:34 2015 UTC,"LG always removes all accessories when you send the phone to them - but they should have warned you that beforehand. When I sent them my N5, they said that I should remove all accessories before sending it - screen protectors, cases, etc."
Nexus5,3agqng,DominikTVDE,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:48:06 2015 UTC,"Good to know, i'm hoping they just do the repair and don't delve into the phone too much."
Nexus5,3agqng,euaneggs,2,Sat Jun 20 09:51:39 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, they aren't renowned for their thorough work."
Nexus5,3agqng,iCapa,2,Sat Jun 20 14:21:13 2015 UTC,Your phone (using presumably stock charger and other hardwear) overheated to the point where it could have become a fire hazard. Regardless of the root status LG should be bending over back backwards to repair it for you without you kicking up a stink legally or in the tech media.
Nexus5,3agqng,stepawayfromthegirl,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:43:23 2015 UTC,Yeah that was my thoughts tbh...however my experience has been less than helpful from them. When i first did a web chat with their support and explained about the fire hazard they were quick to phone me back and the girl said she would escalate it to head office and get back to me personally within 24 hrs.   However i heard nothing and it took about 5 phone calls and 10 days of me chasing them before i got hold of someone who told me that they were sending a prepaid envelop to return the phone. A bit of a joke really.  Gonna send a covering letter back with the phone when i post it on Monday
