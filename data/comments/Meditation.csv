Meditation,3e2bps,Gojeezy,2,Tue Jul 21 14:53:06 2015 UTC,"Planning is an austere discipline. One easily drifts into day dreaming about things beyond the planning horizon. Do you really manage to just plain plan your PhD thesis? No fantasy about you Nobel-Prize-For-Medicine acceptance speech? Will you patent your bio-science thing, get rich, buy a sports car, keep it in a garage, or parked on the street,...  When I try to plan I lose 70% of my planning time to going too far, in self-indulgently planning implausible extras that aren't actually part of what I planned to plan. I find this quite hard to control. There is an obvious danger that one might go meta: drawing up a plan for planning, drawing up a plan for drawing up a plan for planning, etc. My tendency to drift into day dreamy fantasy planning uses this as its primary defense mechanism. When I catch my planning going soft and fluffy I say to myself ""Alan, what are you doing? Just stick to near-term realistic planning."" but the part of me that wants to day-dream replies ""Alan, stop the meta-planning, I'm being realistic enough."""
Meditation,3e2bps,Efficiency_straw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:59:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting....very. And likely very insightful.  I should clarify; planning is more of an example of something that isn't as fun right now. My dilemma is between doing things I find fun right now vs. things that I know will net overall more for me and my cohorts.   Which sort of answers my own question. Thereby it's just a matter of remembering enough and this thread has aided in doing that.  Your comment has aided me greatly in realizing that doing now something for the the future is far more impactful than that hopeful, nebular, unassured planning now for the future."
Meditation,3e2bps,Gojeezy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:30:55 2015 UTC,"The difference is between being mindful and mindless. When planning for the future do not get carried away by thoughts of desire, anger, anxiety and general laziness of both mind and body. Instead, plan for the future.  When feeling guilt or shame do not get carried away by feelings of desire, anger, anxiety or laziness. Instead just experience the guilt."

Instead, plan for the future.   Yeah, but how?  Per my other post:   How do people deal with planning? Obviously you need to plan things, I would be homeless rather quickly if I didn't. But often times when I am planning, whether it's in my mind or on paper, I start worrying about everything I still have to do, and it derails my thoughts.  So, does anyone have tips, perspectives, or reading material on this matter?"
Meditation,3e2bps,jstock23,3,Tue Jul 21 16:02:32 2015 UTC,"You develop concentration (free from the hindrances) through meditation. Then you apply it to life outside of meditation.  When planning for the future, just plan. Just planning means you are not giving attention to the hindrances to mindfulness (desire, anger, doubt, worry and laziness).  When walking, just walk. When cooking, just cook. When eating, just eat. This means that you should not let your mind wander to the hindrances. In addition, you should not be thinking of anything but the task at hand (especially for the novice practitioner).  E.g., when you are showering do not plan for the future unless you are doing it with intention and awareness; being aware of both actions and thoughts simultaneously is next to impossible for a novice meditator. Instead, when showering just shower. This can be a tricky concept to understand unless you have spent some time meditating and can discern when your mind is wandering (mindless) and when it is not wandering (mindful).  A good indication that you are not aware is, if you look back at what you were just doing/thinking, you can not remember one or the other or both. Someone who is mindful can recount their thought process. The more aware they are the more they can recall. Some masters of mindfulness can recall their thought process for an entire day or more, in detail, without skipping over thoughts.  Here is a meditation technique if you are interested. . .   Mindfulness of breathing:   Focus on the breath.   A. Pick either a physical sensations (e.g: the rise and fall of the abdomen, the breath passing through the nose, the breath passing the tip of the nose, etc... ), a mental concept (""in"" and ""out"", or a point in space that the breath passes, or the process of the rising and falling of the abdomen, etc... ) or both. The mind will begin to wander. When you notice it has (a moment of mindfulness) return focus to the breath. Rinse and repeat.   Sometimes a moment of mindfulness is not enough to let go of thoughts (when trying to return to your anchor) though. In that case, there are a few different techniques that will allow you to bring the mind back to your anchor.   Here is a link that explains 5 different techniques for letting go:  Vitakkasanthana Sutta: The Relaxation of Thoughts   The Buddha offers five practical methods of responding wisely to unskillful thoughts (thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion)"
Meditation,3e2bps,lyam23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:15:59 2015 UTC,"While helpful, that doesn't really answer my question specifically. I am well aware of the practice of mindfulness you describe, but I find that it doesn't help me much when I am forced to think about the future, which often raises anxiety. How do you reconcile this with staying focused on the present? I am mostly looking for some practical advice on how to deal with this, as I find that common methods of mindfulness such as focusing on sensations only help temporarily; when I continue planning I lose that focus."
Meditation,3e2bps,jstock23,2,Tue Jul 21 16:35:30 2015 UTC,"Through meditation that anxiety will slowly diminish, as your mind is pacified, even when you are not actively practicing sitting meditation.  I can not offer much advice beyond that because I am, for the most part, a renunciate and my experience comes from meditating many hours a day.  As far as I know, if you spend more time engaged with living what is considered a normal life than you do meditating you will have a harder time being mindful (it is not impossible though- so I do not want to give you that idea). I have heard this is especially true if you practice mindfulness meditation . . . but I am not sure how much credence I give that idea.  With all that said, with enough mindfulness and concentration (that you developed during sitting or walking meditation) you will notice when anxiety arises immediately or within a few moments. That way you can consistently bring your mind back to what you are doing when you notice it has wandered. If you are not able to bring your mind back easily then try doing micro meditations after you notice anxiety. Meditate until it subsides, then bring attention back to the task you were trying to complete. In this way, during any task you are still meditating."

Meditation,3e2bps,Efficiency_straw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:51:40 2015 UTC,"Watch the thought, take it back to its root and figure out why. If it has to do with a past action, realize that you can only change the present and it is useless to dwell on something you can not change.  Again, stop making excuses to justify your guilt, there is no reason to have it in the first place, it's a useless thought that distracts you from reality."
Meditation,3e2bps,Squant0,4,Tue Jul 21 21:30:12 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't with planning or having goals. The problem is with attachment to those plans and goals, and attachment to expectations and projected outcomes.   That's what gives rise to anxiety, fear, worry, etc. It's self-imposed suffering, and robs you of time and energy that you can use now, in the present moment, to actually make decisions and take action."
Meditation,3e2bps,Mountainriver037,3,Tue Jul 21 14:32:26 2015 UTC,"Here's what I think. Seeking short term pleasures or working towards long term goals can both be ways of living in the future (rather than the present) if the result is a rejection or unawareness of the present moment. If you remain present, you can either more fully enjoy your pleasures or more diligently work towards your goals.  Living in the moment need not lead to hedonism because without the conditioned mind flailing about complaining about hard work and focus, wishing you were lounging at the beach, or whatever, you can actually take greater pleasure in doing the things you know deep down are right for you."
Meditation,3e2bps,jstock23,2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:35 2015 UTC,"We are never not present. The present is eternal, and yet so elusive. Nothing has never not occurred in the present - from a perspective stand point, anyway.   If you are thinking of the future, you are still doing so in the present. Similarly, as with many meditative concepts, there is a captivating sense of irony in planning for the future while being present. If we are truly planning for the future, such as working on a project, we will enter a state of flow without being overwhelmed with the outcome - whether that be anxiety, anticipation, fear of rejection, or hope of egoic appraisal. Outcome independence often leads to better outcomes."
Meditation,3e2kt3,lordisa,8,Tue Jul 21 13:52:14 2015 UTC,"The best thing for dealing with anxiety I've found is allowing it to be. After a great deal of searching into specific techniques and methods I can use to deal with anxiety when it arises, it seems that just dropping all resistance and saying ""ok, do what you want"" is the best way to approach it. It can be quite difficult to learn how to truly accept something that we've learned to resent, I think it comes with repeatedly seeing how ineffective trying to get rid of it is. For a long time I used what I thought were really good techniques to get rid of anxiety - focusing on the breath, scanning the body, repeating mantra - and whilst these are good things to do when feeling anxious; crucially, it's the intention that matters, doing the aforementioned techniques with the intention of getting rid of anxiety, just seemed to bring attention to the fact that these various things happening in the body aren't going away.   What I do now in the moment I notice anxiety arise is just welcome it in, I'm not going to serve it tea or anything, but it's totally free to do whatever the hell it wants, I'll just be here and watch.   As the resistance drops, the fear drops, and then there's just sensation, unaccompanied by the fear and terror that was once attached to it, it will pass quicker than trying to will it or relax it away.   Tara Brach's RAIN method is good too."
Meditation,3e2kt3,Swallybongo,2,Tue Jul 21 16:44:53 2015 UTC,"I've found is allowing it to be   I love that. I have also found it best not to fight with it, but rather to accept it. Like ""oh hi anxiety. I appreciate that you worry about me, but i am ok."" Thank it, and let it go, or leave it there. When I fight with it, it rises and I panic. When I thank it, sometimes it seems to go away, or I forget about it :)"

Meditation,3e2kt3,sneeku,3,Tue Jul 21 14:41:57 2015 UTC,"True. I have Asperger's Syndrome and with it comes anxiety. If a large truck or a tractor passes by, I feel this panic rumbling up through my body from deep within my abdomen. I learned (after I started Zen meditation) to 'not give a fuck' as you call it. And it works. Sure, the feeling of anxiety is still there to observe, but if I choose not to pay attention to it nor respond to it in any other way, be it action or thought, it ebbs away very quickly. The adrenaline still rushing, I can remain calm and go about my ways."

Meditation,3e2kt3,NolanKnight,3,Tue Jul 21 15:29:27 2015 UTC,"I also suffer from anxiety. The benefits will increase the more you deepen your practice. Also, try and extend the time you practice. I noticed that when I meditate for 45min-1hr it, the calmness and effects last way into the afternoon; while with a 20 min practice I get easily thrown off (although it helps a lot than not doing it at all). Mantras work for me to ease my anxiety: I repeat a mantra opposite to how the anxiety makes me feel. So when I feel agitated and sweating, my mantra is: ""I am calm and dry"". It works every time and it's getting easier to control because I'm conditioning my mind to relax in those moments.  Keep at it!"
Meditation,3e2kt3,Aalchemist,2,Tue Jul 21 15:54:25 2015 UTC,"I used to suffer from intense anxiety, and sitting meditation only did so much for me. It wasn't until I started studying moving meditation that I started to feel real results. I began by standing on one leg before I went to bed every night, and my balance slowly got better. I realized I had to work from the outside in. Some form of wellness Tai Chi, Qigong, or Yoga may be what you are looking for. The more I felt comfortable in my body, the easier my anxiety was to address. You are literally rewiring your brain, so try not to be discouraged by slower progress. Your existential questions will seem easier to address when the anxiety is lessened. Also, do not be afraid to talk to a counselor or mentor, as that can be incredibly instructive. Another way is finding a place to volunteer where you can be of help to people in need."
Meditation,3e2kt3,Mountainriver037,2,Tue Jul 21 16:45:49 2015 UTC,"I think a huge thing that helps reduce anxiety is follow your intuition. Do what you feel like doing, ignoring all the thoughts that say don't. The more you follow your intuition the less these anxious thoughts pop up.  Just try to be more genuine (at least that's why I'm doing right now)."
Meditation,3e2kt3,Arrade,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:53:14 2015 UTC,"I am going to piggy back on this comment because intuition was brought up.

Meditation,3e4iq5,ego-check,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:53:48 2015 UTC,"can one be at ease   Sure, but there are ways and environments in which one can more or less easily 'forget' that they are ultimately ok, that's how the ultimate and the relative can work together: if you're in jail being raped all day, you may technically be able to be alright, but lots of yogis recognize that it's harder for most of us to remember that we're unconditionally at peace if the conditions are harsh enough.   In other words, if you're really-really-REALLY the kind of yogi who is just as at-peace being tortured as they are at a monastery, then you can probably say that no conditions of the world matter regarding being at ease; but if you're like the rest of us, you start to accept that some events are harder than others to go through whole keeping that link with the ultimate.   That's not to say that you need a whole lot in order to be satisfied or at peace. But I think it's another extreme when we overestimate the durability of our practice or understanding, and then we find ourselves in some sort of overwhelming misfortune that we may have avoided had we been a bit more humble about what we can handle."

The function is to notice and learn that thoughts and feelings are conditioned and spontaneous.  They arise... float around for awhile... and then fade away.  Nothing is permanent.   Instead of pushing the thoughts away, you might try letting them float around until they fade away on their own.  Stay focused on the breath as if you are tracing a fine line as you slowly inhale and exhale.  You can use your inner dialog to note ""breathing in... breathing out..."".  I hope this helps.

But I think it's fine if you count to whatever number you feel like counting too.  It's just about focusing on the breath.    Edit: What beats do you listen to? I just started doing this. Have you found particular types of beats to be more helpful/better than others?

It is said in a buddhist commentary that dismay and detachment are the basis of insight but given enough time and practice the practitioner will delight in detachment.  If you want to avoid this then work specifically on samatha until you develop the factors for jhana (pleasure and happiness)."

It can change a person and interfere with their career and relationships.  Mediation should quiet your mind but it should not cause depression.  If someone is experiencing unpleasant psychological changes from meditation, I would suggest two possibilities:  1) Learn  to release unpleasant thoughts and feelings that arise during meditation: https://sites.google.com/site/chs4o8pt/meditation-1#meditation_release  This can release a lot of emotions so someone should carefully consider whether they want to try it or not.  2) Learn a type of meditation that produces positive feelings: https://sites.google.com/site/chs4o8pt/meditation-1#meditation_serenity"
Meditation,3e3l0c,wheneverrichardcory,4,Tue Jul 21 18:14:04 2015 UTC,"Meditation tends to increase compassion through several means. While some types of meditation, like Metta (Loving Kindness Meditation) specifically focus on cultivating compassion for oneself, and for others, many other types of meditation have compassion as a ""side effect,"" but not all.  If one is doing some kind of mindfulness based meditation, eventually one begins to understand and experience the interconnectedness of all sentient beings. This interconnectedness is like a web. Even those who prefer, or experience solitude are still a part of it. Eventually, one starts to realize how similar one is to all other sentient beings. No matter how many differences we may construct with our minds to set ourself apart, there are undeniably more things which are similar. I think this was best personified by Carl Sagan in his passage, Pale Blue Dot.  What Metta specifically cultivates, is the understanding that one's compassion and ability to have it for oneself, is also interconnected with one's ability to have it for others. So, from a purely selfish point of view, if you want to be able to experience unbounded love and compassion for yourself, it is only by recognizing your own humanity and the humanity of us all, that one can do this.   For example, sometimes other people are just plain annoying. They're rude, and obnoxious, and loud or they get on our case about the way we are. Mindfulness and metta allow you to open your eyes and see the truth- that you are as disagreeable to some others as others are to you. So, when you learn to have compassion and empathy for the faults of others, you are also learning the same release from judgement for yourself regarding the ways you are also imperfect.  People who are unable to have empathy for others at all, may have had some kind of traumatic experience that has closed them off to certain feelings. This may have served as a protective means, especially if one's trauma occurred when one was a child. In this case, regardless of whether or not one's goal is to be empathetic or compassionate, one might benefit from therapy.   True happiness can often be increased by leaps and bounds through becoming more connected. Disconnection is protectiveness, which may feel comfortable, but will limit one's capacity for happiness overall.  Edit: typo"
Meditation,3e3l0c,JustMeRC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:25 2015 UTC,"Disconnection is protectiveness, which may feel comfortable, but will limit one's capacity for happiness overall.   Nice comment, but I think it's better to say that you might think it's more comfortable, because in my experience it's not more comfortable to protective and 'on guard'."
Meditation,3e3l0c,AlwaysBeNice,2,Tue Jul 21 21:58:45 2015 UTC,"For me, I found that metta practice really helped my compassion. You could google metta bhavana or just metta practice or metta compassion to find out more. I have found it beneficial to view other people's actions through a lens of compassion, and to try to understand why they might be doing what they're doing. This in turn makes me happier. So, I suppose, if you avoid doing any metta practice, maybe you won't have any compassion ""side effects""."
Meditation,3e3l0c,epipin,2,Tue Jul 21 18:27:31 2015 UTC,"From my perspective, compassion and empathy is at the core of happiness. Your inner peace/happiness overflows into the world. Bodhicitta is the wish for the end of suffering for other people. When it comes down to it we're all one people. Through having a desire to end your suffering and the suffering of others, enlightenment is brought to fruition. Your spiritual growth in turns spurs the growth of others. There's no removing yourself from the web. Perhaps this isn't the answer you want though. As you said, you don't care about people. Meditation is a tool to use it how you want to. Since you don't have the desire to be compassionate it won't happen no matter how much you meditate."
Meditation,3e3l0c,KilluaKanmuru,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:28:45 2015 UTC,"Well, one of the reasons can be that people actually have a shift in perception as to what they see themselves to be.   Some people might believe that what they are is not their personality, thoughts or body but actually just the consciousness observing them, as these former things pass but the consciousness doesn't. And now different beings might not seem so different any more, from the outer parts everything is still unique yes, but what we are within is simple observing consciousness and so more compassing could arise.  To take this one step further one might actually belief that this consciousness actually is universal or one with all other consciousness at a greater level.  This belief or 'knowing' for some comes from the experience people can have in meditation, where the personal sense of self dissolves and the greater being becomes apparent.  The way people describe this is as if one now experiences the true reality (whereas this life is a more like a dream compared to it), it's described as pure being, being boundless and quite literally eternal, it's described as perfect peace and perfect bliss, aka satcitananda or nirvikalpa samadhi"
Meditation,3e2dos,wheneverrichardcory,4,Tue Jul 21 12:46:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, the book ""Autobiography of a Yogi"" by Paramahansa Yogananda made a huge impression on me.    The book was written in 1946 and still is considered a classic in spiritual literature, kick starting many careers in yoga and essentially starting the ""spiritual autobiography"" genre.    The way it relates to suffering is that Yoga (the classical yoga path, not the gym yoga version that most people have experienced) is the path of permanent removal of all forms of suffering.   The main idea is that suffering is caused by ignorance of man's essential nature as the soul, and that by calming the mind one can become aware of this inner blissful soul-nature that exists beyond the body and is obscured by a restless mind.     Paramahansa created a home-study course for attaining awareness of this inner bliss and joy, and his methods are very effective.   So I can say that it has removed much suffering for me by focusing on the opposite quality of joy (bliss / love / peace etc).    I know many other people who have gotten similar results, so for those so inclined, it's a worthwhile path to explore."

Meditation,3e3uz9,flagrant_armadillo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:02 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about acting like these supposedly different prototypes, the Taoist sage and the Buddhist sage. Rather, combine who you really are right now with whatever your teaching instructs or reveals about your current circumstance.   Buddhist monk Ajahn Sumedho said something similar in a story a while back. He was enchanted by the energetic and relaxed attitude of his teacher, Ajahn Chah, and thought very often that he should also try to have Ajahn Chah's dignified  playfulness. So off goes Sumedho, acting energetic and bouncy, with a bit of dignity mixed in, just like Ajahn Chah.   But Sumedho's community didn't respond at all to the way he was acting, even though Sumedho and that community had undoubtedly agreed that Ajahn Chah's attitude was brilliant and refreshing, ideal in many ways. So Sumehdo tried other things, acting very differently to another degree and that didn't work either...until he realized that he had to simply be himself and take what he was really inside, then put that into his practice; then he would become authentic and wise in the way that suited him perfectly.   I have spent years thinking that I wanted to have this quality or that quality, of this Buddha or that teacher, but I really was interested in copying a personality instead of genuinely growing a quality from the inside using what was really there; but it may be very much harder to practice with what's really there, in the sense that confronting the reality of our unimpressive personality or basic-skills can be very sobering in the beginning.   There's a saying that may be relevant: I'd rather have one real dollar than a hundred counterfeit bills. Similarly, people can really appreciate a genuine but awkward moment (like one beat-up bill)  much more than a copied yet elegant moment (a counterfeit but 'valuable' bill). Coming from the heart has pain as part of the process, but its rewards are at least as big as the pains are."
Meditation,3e3uz9,Sampajanna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:33:24 2015 UTC,This leans me toward spontaneity because that feels more genuine. Maybe the bad moments are just learning experiences and I can naturally integrate what I learn instead of rejecting the whole thing.
Meditation,3e3uz9,Sampajanna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:46:47 2015 UTC,"Well, the whole idea that there's spontaneity on one side and Buddhism on the other is not necessary, like a stencil you're trying to make your journey fit into. Taoism and Buddhism can both allow for spontaneity and ethics/consideration, but we can easily get caught up in whatever image we have of 'the most Buddhist person ever' and think according to that instead of dealing with where we are and what Buddhism or Taoism says about where we are at in our path.   Buddhism doesn't just say, 'Be like that,' it says 'Become such-and-such from the inside out,' which means that you gently accept whatever is the case with you now and then you play those cards that life has dealt you according to your chosen teaching; we don't just look at a spiritual icon and try to act like them. That results in extra strain and confusion for the practitioner and inauthenticity from the standpoint of others observing you. We simply look at ourselves and try to use what we've got to bring about the qualities of an icon, but we don't force or look externally for qualities to impose.   Spontaneity can definitely be a part of a Buddhist path. If you want paths that explicitly make room for that, look into Zen Buddhism and some of the writings of this Tibetan Buddhist figure named Padmasambhava who talks about spontaneously self-perfected, wise conduct that is nevertheless 'carefree' in an important sense."

Meditation,3e0k4l,chickenmaster,10,Tue Jul 21 15:46:44 2015 UTC,"You add equanimity to the watching/seeing process. Some would say that 'the seeing' is intrinsically equanimous, but for now, just think of the process as 'seeing plus equanimity.' It can help to think of equanimity as a kind of serenity that is partly based in the direct personal realization that all things pass. It's not quite 'relaxation,' it's more of a mature serenity that's partly based on the undeniable fact that whatever's happening now will pass (without you needing to 'do' anything to make things pass).   Dhamma teacher SN Goenka called awareness and equanimity like two wings of a bird: they have to be equal in size and equal in strength for flight to be possible. He also said that they are like two wheels of a cart: if one is too small or weak, or one is way more strong, then the cart won't be able to do its function. Make equanimity/serenity as strong as awareness. Spend time noticing impermanence and let that build a sense of 'calm' or of letting go. Mix that with the awareness.   Without equanimity, then merely noticing or looking around can intensify things (as your intuition rightly said), and the intensity can be overwhelming in the wrong place or time.  Good luck!"

Just sense them as a feeling, make them physical: where do I feel this in my body? What happens with those feelings as time passes? Observe with interest and a keen eye for detail.  What ever you do, don't go into language. Don't start to tell yourself stories about the why's and how's and the who's-donnit and the ""Yes, but!""

Having a social setting be ""tense and terrible"" is most likely due to the fact that you are not ""in the moment"" to begin with. But rather, you are in your head, in the near future, imagining all the bad things that you think are going to happen. ""In the moment"" and ""in your head imagining things"" are essentially two different places,  so to speak.   I feel like focusing on the present would just amplify the negative surroundings.

Meditation,3e0k4l,rosscmpbll,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:10:28 2015 UTC,"The majority of responses here seem to indicate that suffering is some kind of mental construct that simply needs to be overcome.  Just change your mind, is basically what they are saying.    I'm here to say something vastly different.    While I more or less agree that our minds are contributing to, if not directly causing our suffering, I don't believe that simply deciding that something painful isn't painful is honest.    Denial and/or blocking our own feelings and experience was the strategy that our young selves began doing during the creation of our ego structures.  In fact, our egos essentially exist to prevent us from re experiencing the pains we felt in early childhood.  Being mindful doesn't mean coercing our experience into something else.  It is a tool that allows us to get enough space from our experience that we can observe it in a way that informs us about why it is happening.  It is a tool that can allow us to see the truth in a situation.  If a situation is causing suffering, there is a reason.  Focusing on the suffering itself is not going to be helpful, but neither is denying that you are experiencing suffering.  Instead, bring your awareness into your body.  Sense your feet and legs ""from the inside"".  Really feel them.  Sense into all of the sensations you feel there, and just be observant.   Are you tensing them up?  It's ok if you are, just observe.  Do the same thing with your arms and hands.    Feeling your body is a way to access the present moment without focusing on suffering, or denying suffering.    Also, if the suffering you feel is in your body, like if you've broken a leg, don't sense into that leg.  Focus on your arms and hands instead.  We aren't trying to amplify your pain in any way.   We only want to root our mind in the present moment, and again, sensing our bodies is one of the best ways to do that.     If you are in a tense social setting, this practice should help you gain more space from your mental activity, which will help you see both your own  reactiveness and you will likely see more about the social setting itself.     I recommend The Void by Almaas, if you are interested in learning about having more space from your experience."

If you're in a similar situation of discomfort, instead of resisting it, just accept that it is and act natural. Just let it play out. I like what someone posted earlier about equanimity. Sometimes really focusing on the situation makes it feel worse, but you have to remember that it is a fleeting situation. It took me a while to realize it's not about getting rid of or reducing those feelings, but just being able to let go and let them be. There is less ""suffering"" that way."
Meditation,3e0k4l,Arrade,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:55:55 2015 UTC,"You can't ever not live in the moment.  This moment is all there ever is.  Now, if the moment is intensely unpleasant, our mind tries to run away from it -- that's the established habit pattern of the mind.  In meditation, we teach the mind to relax and accept everything -- whether pleasant or unpleasant -- and realize directly that peace will never come if we are constantly wishing things to be other than they are.  Things will never be other than they are.  Wanting them to be so will only cause additional suffering, above and beyond whatever unpleasantness might be arising in the present moment.  The skill of accepting things as they are is called ""equanimity."""

You never know when you might get drunk at a party where someone has a crush on you.   I'm just saying cheating can sneak up on you. You don't have to be a douche, player, or great looking guy for a girl to decide she REALLY wants a piece of you. Once it's gone that far it's basically over.  You might even kinda feel like you were raped even though you said yes. It just felt so amazing you couldn't stop it, and you're still drunk or high,  so you're not making great choices anyway.   I'm just lucky my SO was understanding and wanted to work it out. That was a hard conversation I'm sure you would like to avoid having with yours.   So, like you do when you've realized your mind has wandered during meditation, gently bring yourself away from thoughts of boning your gf's bff's when you realize you're having them.

How about saying ""OK, I am sexually attracted to this person, but I am not going to act on it"" rather than ""Oh, I'm so bad and a terrible person for having these feelings.

Drove me near insane one day. I'm not very experienced in meditation but I found that mindfulness meditation would help quiet the thoughts for at least a little bit. Most of all what helped was that I tried to stop worrying about how to stop it. Distract yourself, think about something else, I eventually got to the point where I don't think about it anymore, and that's basically what has allowed my intuition/unconscious thought/mental imagery to come through."

It doesn't really matter, though those who don't have the voice tend to read faster. It's just your brain simulating saying the words and using the same functions it would use for speech.   In general, it is best to try to keep this voice to a minimum in daily life as it can take control. In previous cultures it was seen as a bad thing,  a distraction etc. It's not bad, but it adds little value in daily life. It's something that takes practice. Stay in the moment."

Notice when there are thoughts.  In time you will notice that you are not the inner-dialog and that it is just stimulus/response noise.  When you fully realize that you are not the inner dialog you will stop paying so much attention to it and over time it will gradually become more quite.  Think of it as the neighbors dog that barks every time the wind blows.  Gradually over time as you notice this the yappy dog that is constantly jumping around will change into a silent old wise dog.

Concentration is basically what you develop until you are an intermediate/advanced practitioner.  Mindfulness of breathing:   Focus on the breath.   A. Pick either a physical sensations (e.g: the rise and fall of the abdomen, the breath passing through the nose, the breath passing the tip of the nose, etc... ), a mental concept (""in"" and ""out"", or a point in space that the breath passes, or the process of the rising and falling of the abdomen, etc... ) or both. The mind will begin to wander. When you notice it has (a moment of mindfulness) return focus to the breath. Rinse and repeat.   Sometimes a moment of mindfulness is not enough to let go of thoughts (when trying to return to your anchor) though. In that case, there are a few different techniques that will allow you to bring the mind back to your anchor.   Here is a link that explains 5 different techniques for letting go:  Vitakkasanthana Sutta: The Relaxation of Thoughts   The Buddha offers five practical methods of responding wisely to unskillful thoughts (thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion)  If you have any questions just ask."

Meditation,3e0sxt,natalee_t,2,Tue Jul 21 05:03:23 2015 UTC,"It's not unusual, I think most people go their whole lives without noticing that there's a choice not to listen. The key with meditation is that you're not trying to quiet your thoughts directly, you're simply training your attention not to focus so much on the thoughts. With daily practice, you create a distance between 'you' (awareness) and the thoughts. Often, it feels like we are our thoughts, or we are somehow in them, that they form us. It's simply an illusion because we've allowed our untamed attention to go unchecked for so long.  So, meditation is by no means a quick fix to quiet thoughts, but given time we can learn to train our attention. The less attention you give to unnecessary thought, the less you're feeding the internal narrator, and over time it will stop trying to narrate everything as you're just no longer interested."

Meditation,3e0sxt,natalee_t,3,Tue Jul 21 09:20:08 2015 UTC,"There're loads of recommendations in the sidebar here! But really they all come down to one thing: choose an object to concentrate on, such as the breath, a sound, your heartbeat, whatever is easy for you to feel and pay attention to. Place your attention on that thing, and whenever you notice you're distracted, just gently place your attention back on the object.  The key thing that a lot of beginners miss is that you're not trying to force your mind to stop, in fact resisting the mind is exactly what fuels it. If you notice you're thinking about something, imagining a situation or memory, or anything else, don't get annoyed and don't think you're doing it wrong. It's completely natural, and every time you notice it is a useful opportunity to develop mindfulness. Just let it do its own thing, and accept it for what it is, but let it be in the background while placing your attention back on the object. Over time, you will notice this process becomes easier and easier.  Once that happens and you can rest on the object of meditation for a decent portion of time (perhaps a minute or two), you can move onto other styles of meditation such as Vipassana. But first and foremost, developing your attention is key! Best of luck."

Promise to yourself that you will sit for 1 minute every day, for at least 30 days. There's no way you won't find a single minute in your day ... and if you're already sitting, you can extend it to 15 minutes if you wish so. But don't skip this single minute.

You can be naturally mindful, and you can cultivate the state of mindfulness through a consistent meditation practice.   and  Mindfulness is an action. It's noticing your thoughts have taken you out of the present moment, and moving your attention back to the present moment.

Meditation,3e25d4,elphabaloves,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:14 2015 UTC,Mindfulness is being aware of what you are doing as you are doing it instead of thinking about the past or the future or anything else.  Touch your nose with your finger. You did that mindfully. Touching your nose happened too fast to for your mind to wander and it was new so you didn't do it on automatic pilot.  There is nothing mystical or special about mindfulness. It is simply a way to meditate during daily activities and keep your mind from becoming turbulent between meditation sessions.
Meditation,3e25d4,ringer54673,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:34:05 2015 UTC,Exactly. I see some people here decribe mindfulness as absorbing as much as they can from reality and that is not what midfulness is for me. You are not supposed to notice and be aware of everything around you. As long as you do not get caught up in your thought you are being mindful. When you are not focusing all your energy in your thought you are more aware of the surroundings naturally and spontaneously.
Meditation,3e25d4,Efficiency_straw,2,Tue Jul 21 11:51:33 2015 UTC,"I think most people are describing ways to achieve mindfulness, since that is the most difficult part of the whole thing.   One way that works really well for me personally is to focus on how I am connected/related to everything around me. I focus on the ground under my feet. Then I focus on everything around me, and my position relative to these things. This is simply a way to achieve mindfulness.  Being mindful is more like a state of mind, like you said. The practice of focusing is not mindfulness in itself. But since it is very hard for most people to get in this state of mind they need some tricks to get there. Once you get there and you are comfortable with it, it is easier to get in this state of mind without the tricks."
Meditation,3e25d4,Gojeezy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:17:35 2015 UTC,"You are not supposed to notice and be aware of everything around you.    That depends on whether you are trying to develop focused awareness or open monitoring, a more diffuse type of awareness.  The more developed your mindfulness the more you will be able to be aware of sensations in any given situation.   As long as you do not get caught up in your thought you are being mindful.    That is pretty much true. Even, like my good buddy /u/tastypruno says, you can even be mindful when thoughts arise . . . . But getting caught up in them is a hindrance to mindfulness. ""Hindrance"" does not necessarily mean that mindfulness is totally impossible . . . just next to impossible and at the very least greatly diminished."
Meditation,3e25d4,xtpd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:22 2015 UTC,"I think what you're talking about is more the objective of mindful practice and not necessarily mindfulness. For mindfulness practice, you should try to be aware and notice when your thoughts or feelings are taking you away from the moment or when they are causing you to resist what is going on. So, starting out, there is need for watchfulness. This is practice. Much like lifting weights helps build muscle and studying helps build knowledge and understanding, mindfulness helps build awareness.  At a certain point, though, you must become aware of the watcher and the ways in which watching prevent you from responding in the moment. I agree when you say that when you're not focused on thoughts you are more aware of the surroundings naturally and spontaneously. However, letting go of this watchful state can be difficult (in my experience), but without letting go it will not be possible to experience relaxed states of present moment awareness.   In this state of awareness or ""flow"", you are not being mindful. You are present and aware. You are responding to what is coming up without any mental noting."
Meditation,3e25d4,xtpd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:57:44 2015 UTC,So what you are saying is that focusing on different external things or internal things you PRACTICE mindfullness but that is not mindfulness but the practice to get it more naturally. And the results of that practice itself is mindfulness which whith practice happens more easily.
Meditation,3e25d4,clickstation,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:53 2015 UTC,"Sorta, but I'm not sure I follow what you're saying. For me, meditation serves as a way to build concentration, which allows me to see things as they arise and come up. So, as I practice meditation, I more easily see the beginnings of my anger or my anxiety. It is easier for me to notice when I'm getting caught up in life's dramas.  Mindfulness is an extension of my meditation practice. When I practice mindfulness, I actively bring my attention to whatever it is I'm doing: walking, breathing, filling my water bottle, etc. It is deliberate, focused attention. By being mindful, I'm less likely to get distracted. I am walking. I am breathing. I am filling up my water bottle. That's it. One thing at a time.  In my experience, if mindfulness is applied more broadly, it can be easy to get caught up in the act of watching and, in doing so, one is not actually experiencing what is going on. Instead, you end up experiencing your watching. Life becomes a television program with mindfulness providing running commentary.   So, mindfulness is an exercise routine, a way to practice bringing awareness to what is happening right now. At some point, though, the practice falls away and leaves awareness behind. It is when awareness arises that we can more easily experience the ""flow"" you describe.  My thinking on this continues to mature as I practice and read more. I often see mindfulness used in the place of awareness or the two being represented as synonymous. It is useful to me to define mindfulness as the practice/exercise and awareness as the muscle being developed. Since there are many people from different backgrounds and experience, it's to be expected that there would be different ways of understanding the terminology."
Meditation,3e25d4,Gojeezy,0,Tue Jul 21 16:27:50 2015 UTC,"Is mindfulness that state where you are in flow?   In the strictest definition of the word ""mindfulness"" and ""flow""... No. It's the exact opposite. Flow is an absence of mindfulness.   I always have thought that being mindful is a spontaneous process. You can not make yourself be mindful by trying to be mindful.   Well, yes and no. It's like bending and touching your toes: yes, you can't make yourself able to bend and touch your toes, you have to ""have"" the flexibility. But once you do have the flexibility, you can make yourself bend and touch your toes.  That being said, ""mindfulness"" is not everything that's well and good in spirituality (or psychology), not unlike how ""strength"" is not everything that's well and good in physical fitness.  You want to pursue flow and be spontaneous? Go ahead :)  Whether or not that's a ""good"" thing, you'll have to decide for yourself."
Meditation,3e1dz1,Deanb1307,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:20:24 2015 UTC,"I hear and read a lot to ""meditate on this idea""    That means you meditate, just like normal, then come back to that specific thought process/idea. It is like when someone says, ""sleep on it."" They mean, go to sleep then, in the morning, when your mind is more clear, come back and look at it.   how does meditation (if focusing on breathing and not thinking) help solve problems or inner conflict, person issues, etc?   Inner conflicts and personal issues are not rooted in reality, e.g., a scenario, an action or an object. Instead, they are rooted in ignorance and delusion in regards to the fundamental characteristics of reality (impermanent, painful and non-self).  What that means is, negative thoughts are not rooted in any situation. Instead, they are rooted in your reactions to situations. By pacifying your reactions you are pulling out negative thoughts at their roots.  The mind and its reactive nature are pacified through meditation."
Meditation,3e1dz1,Gojeezy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:26 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the purpose of meditation is to not think, but to improve your relationship with your thoughts; as in how you react to them. It's pretty difficult/near impossible to completely clear your head and stop thinking all together.  To answer your question, there are different forms of meditation that serve different purposes. One practice i've read about is called ""focusing"" which is similar to what you're asking about. I submitted a post talking about it a while back on this sub. If you want you can read more about it here."
Meditation,3e1dz1,Jollyranchr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:50 2015 UTC,"""To meditate on something"" means to sit down and consciously exploring an idea and feelings associated with it. This comes from the classical Western use of the term ""meditation."" The newer meaning of ""meditation"" comes from Eastern philosophy and is much closer to the classical Western term ""contemplation.""   For example to meditate on a business decision is to imagine the various outcomes and your feelings associated with it. Does one of the scenarios feel wrong? Is there a conflict? What if you change this detail, does it reduce that impression? And so on."
Meditation,3e1dz1,bebestman,0,Tue Jul 21 18:02:22 2015 UTC,"Lets look at it like this.  Imagine you have a huge room with a bunch of stuff.  The stuff being all of your thoughts, but everything is all disorganized and scattered.  thoughts that you once had are still there but tossed to the side.    Forgetting about them through meditation is like taking everything out, polishing it and putting it back.  Now in the case of your ""meditation on one idea or thought""  if that thought is all you want to think about then you can program yourself to only think on that by chanting it in your head.    For example if you keep chanting   I AM A STUD.    what do you think your brain will interpret and expand on in that case?"

Mediation can help you get a clear view on subjects if you're able to allow different angles and approaches and focuses to naturally occur. In everyday thinking you're likely to steer your thought in a certain direction. In the free flow of a meditating mind, it is like you're brainstorming with your self :)  But still, I too think this is not the 'purpose' of meditation. For me meditation has no real purpose. It is what it is. Doesn't add or do or develop or grow. It's just ... I don't know."

The ""insight"" that one derives from meditation is entirely experiential.  My favorite metaphor for explaining the difference involves eating oranges.  In everyday life, we typically go around conceptualizing what an orange tastes like, analyzing it, thinking about it, explaining it to others using language.  In meditation, we cut through all that and simply taste the orange."

Something that requires you actually to stop sitting and deal with the situation?  If that happens, I will always return to sitting if I can, but that's not always possible.  Sort of depends on the situation. :D  But I wouldn't typically think of it as ""starting over.""  My practice involves observing whatever is happening right now -- maybe the breath, maybe some sensations.  When I sit back down, I simply do that.  There's no need to restart.  Just return to the practice, the same way you might return to the breath.    Regarding anything that comes up during my meditation that doesn't require me to get up and deal with it, like loud noises, phones ringing, dogs barking, and so forth, I simply treat everything as part of the meditation, something else to observe.  When I am practicing, there are no ""interruptions"" or distractions, all just stuff and things arising in awareness."

You wonder why you ""can't be persistent and determined until [you] achieve something.""  Well, there could be lots of reasons, but if that's the way you are, consider accepting it and then working from there.  You might not be any better at getting things done, but at least you won't have to stress about it.  And that's the main problem, right?  If you want to fix it, then try and fix it, but just accept whatever happens -- whether you fix it or fail to fix it.

Meditation,3e19d8,wheneverrichardcory,4,Tue Jul 21 04:33:30 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I read your links and I really don't see how or why you are characterizing people as being so cruel. Perhaps I did not see what you were referring to when I read the comments and discussion.  I saw many people being very kind and supportive, and the worst I saw was some people approaching the story from a different perspective.    I also do not understand why you are judging the world based off of reddit.  The internet, especially reddit, where rape forums and wife beating forums were allowed for years and only recently has it decided to care about other hate forums, is, imo, not a great measuring scale to use for all of humanity.  It seems to me that you took a snapshot (your link) of a shitshow black pit of tactlessness and hate and cruelty (reddit specifically, and internet forums in general) and you made a generalization about the whole wide world and all of the people in it.    Further, even that snapshot of a shitshow black pit of tactlessness and hate and cruelty, did not seem so bad to me.    I have a different perspective than you, and I do not think that makes me cruel or insensitive - just as I don't think those posters were cruel or insensitive.   Instead, I think you are sensitive to the story you posted.  That is fine, I totally get that, I have a lot of shit I'm very sensitive about myself.  Nevertheless, those are your feelings, and they are just your feelings.  You are entitled to your reactions of hurt and anger and sadness.  But that does not mean you need to label redditors, reddit, the internet, and certainly it does not mean you need to generalize and label to the entire world and all its inhabitants and life in general."
Meditation,3e19d8,wheneverrichardcory,0,Tue Jul 21 11:44:05 2015 UTC,"Gee idk maybe it was the part where people told me what a scummy cunt I am - that could be part of it. Maybe it's the part where people tell me what I see and how I feel, as if they even know all the details of the story off of a 2 paragraph description. Either way, I've found again and again the following attitude prevalent in reddit: The most important thing is to be correct - not compassion, not understanding. Obviously having a different perspective doesn't make you automatically cruel. Even in your post I feel a similar sort of nose in the air kind of feel. You're like, ""You're just being sensitive brah cuz it's your story and your feelings, but don't generalize everyone off of reddit."" Maybe if you experienced rape, deather, liars, cheaters, then you'd know that the world can be a cruel place, and it isn't coming from a immature  generalization on my part. Even still, generalizations are just that: generalizations. I know there are kind people in the world. But I also find that the general population of people who spend time on reddit are very know it all and casting down most of the time. People want to debate all the time and argue all the time, and it's just getting to be too much. There is a truth I think we can all know on the cushion, and that is where I am going to spend more of my time now. I think reddit gave me a lot, but now I have nothing left to give to reddit. I've tried to help many people, but we are at the mercy of our words on this site; to me that is where the danger of reddit lies. words words and words. I could add to the story that I confront my mom honestly or that I told my brother not to bug anyone's phone, or that my dad and my mom are some of the nicest people I know, but that would break the story, wouldn't it? You're post kind of reminds me of why I don't want anything to do with this site anymore. It just has that flavor of superior truth to it - I always feel helpless in defending someone who knows to how make a marionette out of words. People can be cruel, people can be beautiful, and your post doesn't even consider that I could know such a thing. You jump right in to that place of ""objective"" truth as if you know the whole story.   Take care everyone. I will keep reddit, my family, america, ISIS, and Israel in my prayers."
Meditation,3e19d8,nootao,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:08:58 2015 UTC,"The most important thing is to be correct - not compassion, not understanding.   I have found this on reddit as well – including in your post here.  The people who called you names – of course you have a right to be hurt by that behavior ( I know I would be) but my perspective on those comments was this: Those commenters very poorly communicated themselves, but they cared enough to communicate at all.  You are a stranger on the internet, they have never even met you or your family.  Yet, judging by the upvotes, hundreds of people read your post. The people who personally attacked you, seemed like they were empathizing with either, or both, of your parents.  They seemed, to me, to be feeling compassion not towards you, but to your parents.  They felt angry at you, and others, who, from their perspective, worsened an already bad situation for your parents. This upset them.  To say they were not being compassionate because they attacked you, is to be upset because it was not you they were showing compassion towards.  For them to attack you that way, I am quite certain they must have had an emotional reaction to your story – otherwise why would they have even bothered to post, respond, or say such words to hurt and provoke. Their reaction was based on being upset for either or both of your parents, and they were angry at those – all of those – they interpreted to be worsening a bad situation for your parents. That is compassion. That is just not compassion for you. It is compassion for others who are not you.  That anger and vitriol, that came from their compassion.  That the compassion was not for you, and that they communicated that compassion for others with anger and vitriol towards you – well, that is the part that understandably hurt you and upset you. As I said, you have a right to be hurt and upset by that.  But to call them not compassionate? That I do not see. I saw compassion. I saw it for your parents.  I also saw a lot of compassion for you too.  I saw compassion in all of those posts – what I saw, was a difference in who those posters chose to feel compassion for, and how they chose to communicate that compassion.    I hope you are able to find some compassion in the world (and to see it when you find it), good luck."

Keep practicing, and your perception will become fine grained as you keep going, to the point where it's all going to be one flowing, fluid unit with little bits of sensation bouncing around at all times.   Let yourself perceive a gap or blank spots, and as you do that, you'll see little fuzz around the edges of those gaps, which become little bits of sensation over time, and then the edges of the blank spot turn into more and more fuzz that turns into sensation, and then there's no gaps eventually."
Meditation,3e071o,Sampajanna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:26:17 2015 UTC,How exactly do you mean I should perceive the gap or blank spots? I've tried putting my focus on the blackness in my vision (my eyes are closed) which seems to make my concentration overall better.
Meditation,3e071o,Sampajanna,3,Tue Jul 21 08:46:52 2015 UTC,"You try to keep your attention in the same field, the field of sound (now that you clarified that your technique is to concentrate on the sound of your breath and not your sensation of breathing). But you just accept at that moment that there's no input in that field just like you can notice your tongue even if there's no tasting or eating happening.  Your attention may feel like it 'has' to go to vision or something, but that's not necessarily true, it just may feel very tempting. Just as blankness of vision is noticeable to you, blankness of sound is also noticeable, just in a different way that may take a bit more time before it feels comfortable.  In other words, keep your attention in the same field, that's one of the main points of your technique. You don't go bouncing around the moment there's no input, moving from breath-sound to vision or from breath-sound to sensation or thoughts. It makes the quality of attention far less refined to bounce around to whatever is more vivid.   While your attention stays in one field, your attention gets more refined because more and more of your mind is devoted to noticing stuff about the sound-of-breath only (and not thoughts or vision) and so, slowly, much more is noticed, and gaps disappear over time. Without letting your attention gather in one field, the attention will not really get strong and steady but will just keep detecting that which is less-subtle in the moment. The purpose of 'subtle' is that to notice extremely subtle sound (and non-sound) is the mark of heightened attention, and blankness or inability to notice subtle things is a sign of weak attention/concentration."

If you want to keep it breath related, shift your attention to your abdomen. You'll notice that while you're breath can't really be felt, the belly or chest is still expanding or contracting slightly and the skin changing with it.

This is sometimes called ""nose awareness"" rather than breath awareness.  Another strategy is to focus on the rise and fall of the abdomen. Even when it is between rising and falling you can focus on it. You could also work on continuous breathing so that there is no gap between the rise and fall.

But this may just mean you are not flexible enough and will kneel or use a chair for now. Lying down, standing, and walking are valid postures for meditating, they are just not primary.

Meditation,3dz40q,thetuna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:48 2015 UTC,"This is not abnormal.   If things are largely quiet you might try letting go of counting and just try bare awareness. You can either totally let go of counting or let go of it 5-10 minutes into a meditation session. Just try it out and see if it works for you; you sound like you might be ready for it though.  Aside from trying to continuously breath without a gap between the inhale and exhale, if you are experiencing a space between breaths then you can focus on a spot in the nose so that, whether or not their is a sensation of air passing through, your awareness is always focused on that location.  Otherwise, you can focus on the rise and fall of the abdomen. This way you can continue to focus on the abdomen even if there is no rise and fall.  Another strategy is to create a mental concept, like a visualization, of the air entering and exiting your body. When there is a pause between the rise and fall you can still hold onto the image. Just visualize a lack of movement in the air."

There is nothing inherently virtuous about it that makes you a good person, or better than other people if you do it. If you don't want to meditate, don't do it, and don't feel bad about not doing it. If you want to do it once in a while but not regularly, you can do that too."

What if smiling and being nice feels like a chore? What if eating right feels like a chore? What if taking care of my family feels like a chore?  You have to want the state that anything brings more than your normal state (ie, your state without it).  For meditating, that's not being lost in thought vs. being lost in thought. Being lost in thought leads to problems you face every day: stress, anxiety, issues with focus, productivity, self-confidence, and on and on.  You have to develop a solid understanding of this. How? In my opinion, Tolle offers the best understanding of your compulsive mind and the problems it creates in his book ""The Power of Now."" If you don't like the spiritual feel of that, check out Sam Harris' ""Waking Up.""  And if you don't want to dedicate the time and effort to read either, maybe meditating isn't right for you now.

But joggers tell me that if you do it long enough, you'll start to experience the runner's high, and after that, it's easy breezy to motivate yourself to go running.  In fact, you want to jog, you enjoy it, you make time for it.   Meditation is not dissimilar.  If you get far enough along the path -- whether practicing concentration or insight -- it becomes interesting.  Your interest then allows you to more easily overcome boredom and continue the practice.  You'll still go through rough stretches, boring stretches, uncomfortable stretches, but the more you practice, the more you realize that those are just mind states that come and go, and you sit through out it all."

Meditation,3dwvji,thebezet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:18:13 2015 UTC,"So I've been meditating on and off for a couple of years. I get into a rhythm of a couple of weeks and then my patter breaks and I don't do it again for a couple of weeks.    Meditation is a little like exercise in that it requires diligence to produce tangible benefits. Doing it on and off isn't likely to do much of anything. Meditation should be considered in terms of months and years rather than days and weeks.   Sometimes I feel the benefits of meditating, sometimes I don't. But the overwhelming feeling I get when I think about it is it's a chore and I don't want to do it.    Feelings of boredom and of meditation being a chore while practising is common amongst people starting meditation. When the mind isn't fed things to comment on, it usually begins to complain about the lack of things to comment on, because it wants to maintain its interminable monologue.   The benefits don't outweigh the hassle.   You don't have to meditate if you don't want to. If it isn't for you right now, then don't do it. Maybe some point later in your life you'll be inclined to make the commitment that meditation requires."

Incidentally I have a very similar issue about going to the gym, peaks and troughs of activity and inactivity. I wonder why I find it so difficult to commit? Something to meditate on ;)  So I've been using Headspace and while I have found it really useful, but I think I might try it on my own to see if I get on better. I have found it a little irritating (and ironic) that when I'm just getting into it and he speaks about something else. I don't feel like I'm in control of the experience  Anyway, I've got a bit of motivation from this, so thank you. I'll see how I get on alone."

You need to commit yourself to an external structure, whether it's a schedule of meditation, say twice a day for five minutes in the morning and evening (to start), or whether it's joining a sitting group or finding a teacher and doing ongoing practice with them.  Banishing thoughts is not possible just now. The main thing is to banish attachment to thoughts. So you need a practice where you can train your ability to disengage from thoughts — even from the attention-grabbing ones like drama, pleasure, spirituality, anger, and so on.

Meditation,3dygz1,bobthebobofbob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:12:25 2015 UTC,"I spent a long time feeling that same way.  Mindfulness means awareness.   Awareness is considered unhindered when you are able to focus on any sensation (both internal and external, e.g. a car, bird, another person, the sky, the grass, even your entire field of vision, etc . . . or an itching or burning sensation on your skin, or tightness in your muscles, etc . . . respectively) without simultaneously experiencing any feelings of desire, anger, anxiety, doubt and laziness (of both body and mind).  Most people have to work their way up to unhindered awareness/mindfulness through mindfulness meditation. By the time a practitioner experiences unhindered mindfulness they are usually considered intermediate/advanced.  A technical Therevada Buddhist definition, from the  Abhidhammattha, of mindfulness (in pali: sati) is:   The word sati derives from a root meaning 'to remember,' but as a mental factor it signifies presence of mind, attentiveness to the present, rather than the faculty of memory regarding the past. It has the characteristic of not wobbling, i.e. not floating away from the object. Its function is absence of confusion or non-forgetfulness. It is manifested as guardianship, or as the state of confronting an objective field. Its proximate cause is strong perception (thirasaññā) or the four foundations of mindfulness.   If the technical definition is confusing let me know and I will try and tease it out for you."

When you do this, the variations in your experiences meditating seem much less mysterious and you can try to work with your daily schedule and find the best times to meditate.  http://ncu9nc.blogspot.com/2015/02/why-is-it-so-hard-to-concentrate.html  If your mind is racing it is probably due to stress or mental fatigue. Meditating in the morning, particularly after breakfast might help. But I think most people have an unrealistic expectation of how meditation should calm the mind. In reality it helps to calm the mind before meditating. That is why on meditation retreats and in monasteries they do different practices such as bowing practice and chanting practice before they sit down to meditate. An ordinary person should not  expect to be able to sit down and just start meditating. It is perfectly normal to need to do, for example, a half hour of relaxation exercises, before you are able to meditate. So you could also try that if you care to spend the time - do some relaxation exercises, hatha yoga, meditative tai chi, etc before you meditate.  When I meditate, I split my meditation session into two parts, a relaxation part and a concentration part:  https://sites.google.com/site/chs4o8pt/meditation-1#meditation_serenity  That might work for you too.  Also, when an unpleasant thought or emotion arises you should take a few seconds to release it rather than push it away otherwise you might start repressing things. https://sites.google.com/site/chs4o8pt/meditation-1#meditation_release"

Meditation,3dv0xo,shqualhla1,21,Sun Jul 19 19:14:28 2015 UTC,"I've had social anxiety for years. I can control it pretty well these days. What I often do is imagine how much I don't care about things. Like what people are doing, what they're wearing, what they're saying. *I listen, but I doubt that most are so tuned in. There's so much that goes on inside someone's mind that a blemish probably isn't something people fixate on. I try to think about the fact that most people won't recognize me tomorrow. That I'm just another face in an endless crowd. Most people don't pay attention. In the meantime I absolutely lose myself in a task. Think about what I'm doing and what needs to be done. Perhaps checking occasionally that everyone is still not giving a fuck. It makes me give both myself and others the benefit of the doubt more often. Makes reality less intense. It's kind of funny, it's like I am a disembodied consciousness. I'm connected, but everything else is more important."
Meditation,3dv0xo,teddymutilator,23,Sun Jul 19 20:33:48 2015 UTC,"I think Eckhart Tolle explains this well when he talks about 'creating space' or a spaciousness when we're with others through our practice of awareness.  By being aware, you are just allowing things to happen rather than being unconscious speaking to say words.  I think sometimes being mindful in social settings can feel a little bit like you're being a wall flower but if I don't have anything meaningful to contribute to a conversation, I just stay quiet and stay in awareness.  I still smile and laugh and am open, I'm just not trying to be the life of the party as the ego would want.  Hope that makes sense; that's a good question."
Meditation,3dv0xo,CatchNotBreak,4,Sun Jul 19 19:54:58 2015 UTC,"In addition to what Tolle explains, I tend to add empathy into the social mindfulness process in order to better key into what the social circumstance might require to remain enjoyably calm and appropriately engaging. Empathy allows one to more easily set an appropriate tone of interaction and feel less controlled, provoked, or manipulated by the social queues of the other person/people and to maintain a similar focus one experiences in meditative exercise."

Meditation,3dv0xo,CatchNotBreak,8,Mon Jul 20 14:04:44 2015 UTC,"The way I practice mindfulness in conversation is by truly listening when the other person/people are speaking rather than planning what I might say next. I used to have a lot of social anxiety and I'd get so wrapped up in figuring out something not stupid to say that I'd completely miss the other person's point. Now I try to avoid that and focus my full attention on what they're saying and if I don't have much of a response, I just ask questions."
Meditation,3dv0xo,YOLObear,4,Mon Jul 20 02:29:38 2015 UTC,"came here just to say this. and people might think that if you're just listening to the other person and when it's your time to speak, you won't know what to say. but it's not the case... the words kinda just flow through you, from somewhere deeper."
Meditation,3dv0xo,pleasewait,4,Mon Jul 20 09:54:49 2015 UTC,"Good question.  I don't have an answer, but I find that if I'm trying too hard to be mindful in a conversation (or in general) then it leads to me actually losing track of the conversation, focusing on their eyes instead of what they're saying for example.  I think the best approach is more like the second one you mention, because in a social setting the important thing is the communication between people."
Meditation,3dv0xo,Innervaet,5,Sun Jul 19 19:48:28 2015 UTC,"True letting go to me means the following: thinking when I think, listening when I listen, but neither being the thinker or the listener. I almost feel like I'm a chemical compound being dropped into the realm of another person or chemical compound, and I just watch the natural reactions that take place. However, I'm not simply bouncing off of reactions because I am always aware of reactions as they arise and pass away. The important thing is the have the wisdom to take the space of mindfulness with you wherever you go (there you are.) True letting go isn't something that can be done by a self."
Meditation,3dv0xo,psychonautalot,2,Mon Jul 20 01:12:02 2015 UTC,So I guess the most important thing is just remembering being mindful right?
Meditation,3dv0xo,psychonautalot,3,Mon Jul 20 01:22:25 2015 UTC,I don't know because sometimes it becomes an obsession that actually takes you out of the present moment. Like...if you're always having to remind yourself to be present it can subtract from presence. Takes practice to find the right balance that works for you.

Meditation,3dxo5d,Segol,3,Mon Jul 20 11:39:16 2015 UTC,"If you're not on any substances that make you hallucinate, then you're not very likely to see anything visual just from meditation. Visualizations such as shifting patterns or shifting ""blobs of light"" are more common and full on hallucinations usually play out like dream sequences, so they're actually not that scary unless you have a lot of scary thoughts and have intense nightmares.    I used to have a group of about 10 people that I met with regularly to talk about yoga and meditation. Only 2 of us out of the group would talk about seeing things during meditation, and it didn't happen regularly for either of us.  In conclusion, hallucinations are not common, and when they do happen they're very dream-like, so saying you're scared to meditate because you might hallucinate is like saying you're scared to sleep because you might have a dream."

Meaning that once it comes into being, your awareness it has already begun to pass away.  Hope this helps.

Meditation,3dxo5d,YouAreAlwaysMe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:23:03 2015 UTC,"There are ""hallucinations"" as a result of insight stages but in meditation these are seen as heightened perception rather than perceiving things that do not exist.  In any case, to experience those stages of insight takes a great deal of concentration. Moving on to insight from a heightened state of concentration is not necessarily guaranteed without turning your attention toward the fundamental characteristics of reality. So you can develop concentration, clear the mind, resolve conflict, acknowledge your faults and overcome them without worrying about insight stages or ""hallucinations"" arising on their own."

Meditation,3dw0m4,killertofuuuuu,17,Mon Jul 20 00:18:20 2015 UTC,"What you experience as ""insecurity"" is simply a collection of physical sensations (rapid heartbeat, tensing of your muscles, sweaty palms, etc.) and thoughts (""everyone's looking at me"", ""I'm so alone"", ""I don't like how I look"").  With mindfulness, all thoughts are seen equally. You apply the same curious & accepting quality of attention to ""Everyone's looking at me"" that you apply to a thought like, ""A burger would be nice right now."" You apply the same gentle, nonjudgmental attention to the sensation of wind on your face, to the feeling of your heart racing.  When you do this, the thoughts & feelings lose their power over you. You realize they are fleeting, usually not based in reality & don't have to determine the actions you take in the present moment. In any given moment, you are never ""insecurity"". You are a human being, experiencing emotions and thoughts.  Being in the now means you don't have expectations. You just are, right now, with everything else that is. So when you're feeling that ""insecurity"", notice it's component parts - the sweat forming on your palms, the choked feeling in your throat, your quickening heartbeat, the thought ""Everyone's watching me"" - just observe each of these things, trying not to judge them. There is nothing wrong with feeling any of those things. Let them be a part of your experience.  What typically happens is that you get to the point where you realize that all of those things - thoughts, boredom, insecurity - are just thoughts. There's no need to run from them. And the only thing that actually ever exists is what is observable in the present moment.  Sorry this was so all over the place. I hope I got something helpful across lol."

Meditation,3dw0m4,nani_kore,2,Tue Jul 21 00:01:50 2015 UTC,"Sure there are reasons you have those feelings. But usually the reasons don't matter as much as we think. We don't have to fix feelings to do things differently in our lives. Once we've made peace with feelings of insecurity etc., we can then take mindful action towards whatever we find worthy.  The reason insecurity seems like a problem for you right now is because you believe that it's presence is keeping you from doing things you value. But it isn't. You can go out, make friends, cultivate new interests & hobbies, etc, regardless of what feelings or thoughts you are experiencing. It just takes detaching yourself enough from those feelings & thoughts so they no longer define you.  As you start taking mindful action, so for example, talking to someone new even though feelings & thoughts of anxiety are present, you start to realize that thoughts only have the power that we give to them by identifying with them. You'll start to think, ""If I can talk to a new person even though I feel anxious, imagine what else I can do despite whatever feelings or thoughts I have at any given moment!"" That's freedom."

Actually see it's quite the opposite with weed , it is believed that it makes you cloudy and further separates you from your astral self. Also when you smoke your astral body like expands a lot and there can be tears in your astral body leaving like holes for astral entities to attach themselves to you.

Meditation,3dybqt,TheHeartOfTuxes,3,Mon Jul 20 16:56:15 2015 UTC,"Many people think that freedom means getting their favorite situation. Many people think this way.  But that is not freedom. That is your preference controlling you. If you live this way, then whenever you don't get your preference, you are at a loss, unhappy, dejected, confused. You think ""this can't be right"".  Imagine that! Here is real life, and you think ""this can't be right"" or ""this isn't enough"".  Trying to get a situation that never feels uncomfortable makes you a slave to comfort. The more you try in this way, the more you give your power to your like-and-dislike mind, your mind that is always chasing here and there, and is never able to be satisfied with what is.  Freedom means you can be with your favorite, and that's fine; and you can be with your not-favorite, and that's also fine. You can show up in awareness, compassion, and sincerity without being controlled by outside circumstances.  So while outer influences can make a big difference in your life, the central point is how you show up. How do you offer yourself to each situation?  That is the main reason why altering your thinking and feeling with substances is not helpful. Yes, the substance itself may not be so good for the body or the energetic system; but in some cases it's not so dire. We have all kinds of pollution around us. The main thing is your attachment. That is the real impurity, the real blockage."

Meditation,3dvqwh,ringer54673,0,Mon Jul 20 01:54:31 2015 UTC,"Qi is real, it's just that people who have not experienced it will ascribe it to 'pseudoscience' or wishful thinking.  One of the danger signs in finding a Tai Chi or Qigong teacher is if they say Qi is folklore and superstition, and try to explain it all away as 'body mechanics.'  Nowadays we have the specialty of 'medical' acupuncture (as if acupuncture is not medical). They attempt to explain acupuncture in terms of physics and chemistry. Eventually perhaps, East and West will meet when scientific instruments become sensitive enough to measure Qi.  I suppose there will be holdouts who will insist that Qi is a myth, meditation is hallucination, when you're dead you're dead and the body is merely a bag of chemicals. No Qi for me thanks, I'm a scientist."
Meditation,3dvqwh,clickstation,2,Mon Jul 20 01:35:40 2015 UTC,"So um, if that paragraph was satire have you tried any Qi practices? I'm just trying to branch my knowledge on the subject, I find it very interesting and have been reading a book about it lately."
Meditation,3dvqwh,Skellingtron,0,Mon Jul 20 01:58:10 2015 UTC,"What's your guy's opinion on Qi?   It is real:  Sensing the Qualities of Qi  http://ncu9nc.blogspot.com/2009/06/sensing-qualities-of-qi.html   We deal with all this so routinely in the lab, I didn't think to mention it to the qigong master in our first experiment. We simply handed him a dish with cells growing in it, and said, ""There are normal cells in the dish. Please give them a healing treatment. We hope to see them grow well, even more than untreated control cells."" That was the procedure. Seems straightforward, right? This qigong master had agreed to the task and I figured we'd let him take his time and do his thing with the dish. But after treating the cells he came out of the treatment room shaking his head. ""Those cells are not normal,"" he said. ""They are very abnormal, so I didn't try to make them grow. I tried to eliminate them.""  I was feeling skeptical about the whole experiment and my first reaction was one of sheer irritation. I tried to be polite but I told the man he was frankly wrong. There was no question. These were normal brain cells. He came right back, just as confident as I'd been. He defied me outright. ""No,"" he said, ""they are not normal. I sensed an abnormal qi.""   Well, at that point, it hit me. I realized there were in fact only one hundred normal healthy brain cells in that dish, and they were growing on top of ten thousand tumor cells in the process of committing cell suicide. So, if this healer could in fact perceive anything about the cell culture as a whole, we might perfectly well expect he'd take notice of the dying tumor cells, not just the much smaller percentage of healthy cells. At that point, I backed up and explained the nature of the culture to him. He nodded and let me know that now everything made sense.   That episode intrigued me. Maybe this man really was able to perceive something quite unknown to me. Our experiments have unfolded from there.    You can learn to sense it too:  http://ncu9nc.blogspot.com/2013/01/a-synthesis-of-spiritual-healing-and-qi.html"

Meditation,3dvqwh,clickstation,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:23:14 2015 UTC,"electrons are real, they are matter.    You are missing the point. Electrons are an abstract construct or model that allows us to predict some physically detectable phenomena. They are a product of mind, and only real in that sense. Same with 'gravity'."

If gravity wasn't real we would not be alive.   No, our being alive has nothing to do with gravity itself, it has everything to do with the effects of gravity. Or, rather, the phenomena which we ascribe as the effects of gravity.  We invent the concept of gravity to model the cause-and-effect of some observable phenomena."

You're body will breathe as it sees fit and your mind is simply observing subtleties of the experience. I try to feel my lungs expand and contract. Your breath isn't a song with a tempo, don't think too much about the rate of your breath. But since the goal of meditating is to clear your mind don't think about it too much. This was just a turning point for me in understanding my breathing"
Meditation,3dtxvv,thugasaurusrex0,5,Sun Jul 19 17:50:44 2015 UTC,"But since the goal of meditating is to clear your mind    Exercise caution with this. I thought that clearing my mind of thoughts purposefully will make it clear but it can backfire. Like really bad. Just make sure you don't actively participate with whatever is going on while meditating, which is sometomes hard to notice at first. The best advice I can give you is don't have a goal, don't have idea of what meditation is or is supposed to look like because whatever it is it will show itself so don't try and alter it."

Technically, according to ajahn brahm, this is nose/lip awareness rather than breath awareness but it will still work for developing concentration and mindfulness.  Or else you can do breath-work, where you develop a good breathing pattern, in addition to your meditation. If this interests you look into diaphragmatic breathing."
Meditation,3dtxvv,Gojeezy,5,Sun Jul 19 13:37:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for asking this. I'm new to meditation and realize I'm doing the same thing.
Meditation,3dtxvv,tulily,2,Sun Jul 19 18:34:16 2015 UTC,Whenever focusing on my breathing I am actually focusing on the feeling of the air leaving my nostrils. Or the feeling on my top lip. If that doesn’t help it might just be a temporary thing. I seem to remember experiencing something similar years ago when I was first starting. As you get used to meditation it might pass.
Meditation,3dtxvv,ZenTemujin,2,Sun Jul 19 14:55:41 2015 UTC,"Try focusing on a single point where the effects of the breath are noticeable - not the breath itself. Like others have said, the nose/upper lip is a good point of focus. It's very subtle however, at least for me, so don't worry if it takes quite a bit of concentration at first to notice any sensation of air movement there."
Meditation,3dtxvv,nani_kore,2,Sun Jul 19 15:40:59 2015 UTC,"I look at it like an exercise. The more I focus on my breathing, the better I get at controling my breathing, and the better I am at staying in a rhythm when I'm no longer thinking about it. During my meditation sessions I often use breathing as a focal point. I'll practice breathing in different patterns with a real emphasis on doing the patterns exactly."
Meditation,3dtxvv,SouthShoreBum,2,Sun Jul 19 18:02:32 2015 UTC,"Just notice that the body breathes on its own without any need to control it. There is no 'you' that is necessary in breathing. When you're asleep or not focusing on the breath, it still occurs right? So no need to control. Notice the breathing process and also notice the desire to control the breath and the tension that arises when you try to not control it. Eventually the tension will go away as you relax"
Meditation,3dtxvv,firstsnowfall,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:28:58 2015 UTC,"Focus on specific aspects of the breathe, such as the coolness of the inhale and warmth of the exhale, or the rise and fall of the chest. Just focus on one specific part of the breathe to help narrow your focus which will help with the self-conscious thoughts about if you breathe is right or not. It should flow effortlessly and be natural. Meditate more, just breathe and don't worry, there is no right or wrong way in the long run."
Meditation,3dtxvv,PurpleMonkeyRunner,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:38:38 2015 UTC,"I notice that if I try to focus on my breath, my breathing gets out of sync and I have to spend time trying to get my breathing correct so I'm not uncomfortable, rather than just focusing on breath.   Your breath being out of sync doesn't prevent you from attending to your breath. Neither does feeling uncomfortable. Neither does thinking about how your breath is out of sync or how you're feeling uncomfortable. These things can all pass through your mind as you attend to your breath.   What can I do to avoid this?   You don't. You attend to your breath while this kind of stuff happens. If your attention entirely moves to something else, then gently bring your attention back to your breath. That is it.  These other things that you experience during meditation are like ripples in a pond. If you try to stop the ripples, you will only end up making more ripples. But if you leave the ripples alone, don't interfere with them, then they disappear by themselves."
Meditation,3dtxvv,TastyPruno,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:57:22 2015 UTC,The problem with that is that I'm new to meditation and adding something so necessary as breathing to my already scattered thoughts just makes it increasingly difficult.

Meditation,3dtxvv,Lolnichego,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:36:44 2015 UTC,"adding something so necessary as breathing to my already scattered thoughts   As a newbie I thought the same way, but believe me, concentrating on the breathing will strongly help you to let the thoughts stay somewhere on the background. It may not be so easy the first time, but it will help, and relatively quickly, actually. At least, for me it was very useful when I got it; before it was just an endless battle with thoughts, which can become tiresome very fast."
Meditation,3dtxvv,caseynouveau,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:30:01 2015 UTC,Me too. Incorporating breathing was what made me finally understand how to 'just be' after trying to understand meditation for the past 15 years.
Meditation,3dtxvv,TastyPruno,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:03:20 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is that I'm new to meditation and adding something so necessary as breathing to my already scattered thoughts just makes it increasingly difficult.   That doesn't matter. Even if your attention only rests on your breath for a millisecond, you place it there, and move it back each time you notice it's moved.  As the meditator, it's not on us to consider the progress or success of a particular session. The only thing to do is follow the instructions, even when it seems entirely unproductive.   I think what you're suggesting is possible at a later point in my practice when I've learned to control my thoughts a little better.   You'll probably find that any attempt to control your thoughts will only make the situation worse. Like with pond ripples, generally the more you try to interfere with thoughts, the more thoughts you end up creating. But if you leave the thoughts alone, then they dissipate by themselves.  It's worth noting that meditation is primarily about self-discovery, not changing things or controlling things. This is why many people, when they start meditating, feel like meditation is actually increasing the amount of noise in their minds, and they think they're doing something wrong. The reality is that the noise level has probably remained the same, and they're beginning to cultivate awareness of a small amount of the noise, so it's actually working as it should."

When I try to focus on my breathing, I struggle with breathing naturally and sometimes feel like I'm not getting enough air.  So instead, I focus on the sensation on my nostril and the area immediately below it, and the breathing remains natural.  This focus is also the technique taught at Goenka centres, prior to introducing Vipassana techniques."

As an alternative, when you catch yourself thinking about it, take your focus off the breath to something that makes you happy and calm (an image of a loved one, a lake) or feel the breeze or the air touching your body. Check the breath periodically and when it's calmer, non-judgmentally return to feeling it as calm as it is."
Meditation,3dtxvv,matznerd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:40:30 2015 UTC,"Simply notice when you're doing this, thinking about controlling the breath. Focusing on the breath isn't about controlling it, there's no such thing as ""correct breathing"" as far as meditation is concerned. You simply watch your breath, whether its breathing quickly, slowly, heavily, subtly etc. etc. If you feel discomfort, notice that, be aware of it, accept it as part of the meditation. Worrying about avoiding all that may not be the thing to do, as it means you're being less detached from what is happening, seeking out a more pleasurable experience, than an uncomfortable one, rather than simply accepting what happens as it happens"

Meditation,3dtxvv,Ariyas108,3,Sun Jul 19 15:54:00 2015 UTC,"I second this. The whole point of meditation is to observe your thoughts as if you're an objective third party. You're not supposed to control them, just let them come and go. You'll of course have thoughts about your breath since that's the very thing you're trying to focus on. Just let those thoughts come and go and bring your attention back to the breath itself, and not the speed or frequency of the breath."
Meditation,3du6lx,whoawhoano,8,Sun Jul 19 14:40:58 2015 UTC,"Accept that these ""highs"" are temporary.  Get curious about that.  They come, and they go.  So happy feelings are temporary and don't last.    Now, that might sound depressing and discouraging, but actually it's not.  Because what that means is that those times you feel like shit?  You'll realize they're temporary, too.  And that will bring relief the next time you feel like shit.  You'll remember the old saying: ""This too shall pass.""  And you'll be halfway toward moving out of it.  Your pain isn't so much that the happiness or highs go, but that you cling to them and don't want them to go.  You want this permanent happy feeling all the time.  That's very understandable, very natural, and we all feel like that from time to time.  But a deeper wisdom sees that attachment to happiness actually reduces your chances of happiness.  The more you want it, the less likely you are to experience it (and you already seem to be noticing this).  People meditate for different reasons, but my reason (Buddhist-based) is to realize peace and freedom from stress.  In my practice, ""happiness"" or feeling ""high"" isn't the point.  A very good book on mindfulness meditation put it this way:   Misconception #8 Meditation is a great way to get high  Well, yes and no. Meditation does produce lovely blissful feelings sometimes. But they are not the purpose, and they don't always occur. Furthermore, if you do meditation with that purpose in mind, they are less likely to occur than if you just meditate for the actual purpose of meditation, which is increased awareness. Bliss results from relaxation, and relaxation results from release of tension. Seeking bliss from meditation introduces tension into the process, which blows the whole chain of events. It is a Catch-22. You can only have bliss if you don't chase it. Besides, if euphoria and good feelings are what you are after, there are easier ways to get them. They are available in taverns and from shady characters on the street corners all across the nation. Euphoria is not the purpose of meditation. It will often arise, but is to be regarded as a by-product. Still, it is a very pleasant side-effect, and it becomes more and more frequent the longer you meditate. You won't hear any disagreement about this from advanced practitioners.   Hope that's helpful."

If you're not, and if you're feeling bad for very prolonged periods of time where meditation alone isn't helping (or you're just not able to meditate because of it), please don't hesitate to seek out professional assistance. Meditation cannot, I repeat cannot, replace legitimately needed therapy and medication.  Or if you can manage to meditate regularly, try for about a month; but if you see no improvement, you should still see someone.  Meditation can then be a good supplement, but again it's not a cure for more serious issues.  Just pointing this out in case it's something you need to consider, and it's nothing to be ashamed about or judge yourself for if you decide you do need it.  Literally thousands of people benefit from therapy and medications, some of whom are people you interact with everyday and may not even know."

Meditation,3du6lx,nani_kore,2,Tue Jul 21 11:56:56 2015 UTC,"That's the result of clinging.  It's important during meditation to be aware of the mind's tendency to cling to things it perceives as ""positive"". This creates suffering, because as you said, if you're attached to that euphoric state, then you're automatically afraid of losing it. This creates a constant source of fear and anxiety.  But if you develop a sense of detachment from all states, even the pleasant ones, then you'll be able to enjoy the pleasantness when it's there, without those feelings of fear and anxiety poisoning your present experience.  You want your meditation to help you grow that capability of being detached & observant of what you're feeling and experiencing, no matter what it is. The irony is that as you learn to stop trying to hold on to that ""high"" when it comes, the more you're able to experience.  tl;dr: Stop clinging and accept whatever presently is."

Meditation,3du6lx,teddymutilator,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:13:08 2015 UTC,"It's not complicated at all actually :) The thought, ""meditation is complicated"" is merely a thought. And ""shitty state of mind"" is a thought, and ""it's hard"" is also a thought. So is, ""I have fallen apart"".  Mindfulness is applying an accepting and observant perspective to any & every thought. This acceptance has no limits. You must even accept thoughts about other thoughts, those are also part of the thought stream."
Meditation,3duxy7,Vatyan,2,Sun Jul 19 18:49:34 2015 UTC,"My meditations are quite simple, I close my eyes and observe my thoughts while focusing on my breath. When I am distracted, I shift my focus to my breath and go back to observing again. In a sense, I resist thinking. I wonder, did I do something wrong?   Most of what you said sounds okay, except that you resist thinking. It's possible that you're meditating in such a way that is causing your feelings of detachment.   And these three days I've begun feeling like I'm living in matrix, and everybody is a projection. This morning I meditated again for 20 minutes, and after that I was at the peak of my detachment, it was like I couldn't even recognize my own family at the breakfast. By the afternoon everything was normal again. And thank goodness for that. It's almost midnight, and almost everything seems to be good for now.   I'm not a doctor, but I believe what you're describing here are classic signs of depersonalisation disorder. It doesn't seem to be a big problem at the moment, but it could be if it gets worse.  I'd suggest you stop meditating for the moment. If these kinds of things keep on happening even though you're not meditating, then you will want to see a therapist.  If further down the line, these things stop, and you want to take up meditation again, I'd suggest reading a beginner's book or two and joining a local group where you can be guided by more experienced meditators. If something about the way you meditated was responsible for your feelings of detachment, then doing the above should prevent you from creating the same detachment again.  Here is a fairly comprehensive write up about the dangers of meditation, written by a clinical psychologist. It's well worth reading: http://www.jimhopper.com/mindfulness/#caution"
Meditation,3duxy7,TastyPruno,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:33:33 2015 UTC,"What you said about resisting thinking, it's true. I want through a period of depersonalization last year and it's not something I'd wish on my worst enemy honestly. You absolutely can't resist thinking or feeling, you MUST acknowledge it. It came from a panic attack, but that panic attack came from confusion and not addressing my feelings for months and months. It leads to pent up emotions and feelings to the point where your brain is almost stuck in a fight or flight response. So your brain eventually blocks everything out to keep itself safe, or to survive. This is why I tell people to feel everything they do. If you're sad, feel completely sad and cry. If you're mad, scream, punch something, get it out. Holding things in is far worse than letting something out and hurting someone's feelings. Maybe I'm rambling but hopefully you can get my point."

The irony is that many of us turn to meditation precisely because our lives are shitty, and we're hoping that meditation offers the escape we desire. I think this is why some people's practice can contribute to dissociative disorders, because they're violently trying to escape."
Meditation,3duxy7,TastyPruno,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:36:53 2015 UTC,"Quite precisely. I did a lot of stuff leading up to when it happened to me. I lost my dad, and subconsciously began to drink and drink and drink, then I was smoking tons of pot, then one day I just crashed. I didn't realize I was doing it, but I think I was trying to cover up my sadness and pain every single day by doing that until it became a habit. It was my escape.

Meditation,3duxy7,jbtk,2,Mon Jul 20 17:02:26 2015 UTC,"It's made me who I am being open, and even friends of mine have said I have helped them.   I think sometimes when you become more open to your own thoughts and feelings, it can give others permission to do the same. Although, that said, it can have the reverse effect with those too scared to open themselves, and they can shun you as a result.   Life is wild, honestly. I hardly meditate to be honest. I'm more here to take lessons and gain insight. I make a conscious effort to think positively and dwell on the good in my life daily, and I guess in a sense that really is meditation.   Meditation is a practice specifically designed to cultivate awareness, but it doesn't have a monopoly on it. Awareness can found in things as simple as a cool breeze on your face, a single deep breath, or the taste of your morning tea. Appreciating life on that level is its own practice."

If you try to escape you continue the chain of fabrication. If you try not to escape or fall in love with your experience you're also fabricating.   You're right. The instruction to ""fall in love with life"" could be interpreted in such a way that involves feeding their current fabricating. But so could any instruction, no matter how simple, like ""attend to the breath"" -- I'm inclined to believe that that's exactly what lots of beginners do. Even if you qualify it, and say they should ""passively attend to the breath"", even that can be turned into the idea ""I must attain this future state where I passively attend to my breath"". And even if they read all of what I've just read, they might then say ""I must attain the future state where I'm not trying to attain some of future state.""  As I understand it, the ""fall in love with life"" instruction is aimed at people who are averse to their emotions. So when a supposedly negative emotions arises, they fabricate in response to it, freak out. It's possible that such a person might read the instruction ""fall in love with life"", and start to change their relationship with those emotions, stop trying to push them away, and therefore break that particular chain of fabrication.   Whether or not someone perpetuates a dissociative or escapist pattern I don't think matters much to meditation as you would think...if that's their goal they're going to do it no matter what,   Light escapism isn't necessarily a problem, and I think it's possible that some people must seek, wear themselves out, in order to realise the futility of seeking for themselves. But violent escapism, the kind that results in the dissociation like what that the OP describes, can develop into a severely debilitating mental illness, and turn life into a nightmare, as I understand it. As /u/jbtk said, it's not something you'd wish on your worst enemy.   and anyways it's a useful defense mechanism until they can finally realize things are ok.   I think that to realise things are okay, you must perceive things as they are, and you cannot do that if you refuse to look at them. You cannot be fully open to what you're currently experiencing if you're lost in a story about how you need to block out what you're currently experiencing."
Meditation,3duxy7,TastyPruno,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:38:19 2015 UTC,"The point about fabrication is good. Skillfully fabricating can be good especially if we have a lot of aversion but eventually we want to go beyond fabrication. Now the point about mental illness is more pressing...I'm not sure that meditation will make worse whatever condition exists. The subconscious pressurized towards the surface and it's likely that such a debilitating condition would have developed regardless of meditation. One cannot ""see thigs as they are"" without some degree of armour. That's why the dissociative mechanism exists and why the subconscious remains subconscious. We push things away until we are ready to face them. Meditation cannot force anything to ripen only provide conditions for us to let go when we're ready."
Meditation,3duxy7,stupidcuntbag,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:29:47 2015 UTC,"These feelings are quite common among beginning meditators, but the detachment is as temporary as may be a teens revolt against the outside world, though it usually lasts much shorter. Try different approaches to meditation and do not try resist thinking immediately - acknowledge it at first and contemplate for a while on the source of that thought. Then, once you're comfortable with it allow it to go away and go back to focusing on breathing. You might want to get acquainted with mindfulness meditation and try to gradually work your way towards it. Here's a short, straight forward guide to mindfulness: http://anpene.com/blog/experience-mindfulness-for-the-first-time/  There are other posts connected with the subject if you'll be interested in finding out more. The practice is tremendously beneficial and I would encourage you to keep working on it. Treat the detachment as any other troubling feeling - acknowledge it, contemplate it and move on."
Meditation,3dvu3z,Segol,4,Sun Jul 19 23:22:02 2015 UTC,"As soon as you notice that you've become angry, say to yourself ""Anger is present in the mind."" Then, go back to whatever you were doing beforehand. Once you've simply acknowledged the presence of anger and return to your previous activity, the anger will automatically decay rapidly, all on its own. When it comes back again, hours later, minutes later, or even seconds later, just repeat.  When you notice that you've become angry, notice the anger with a neutral and unbiased mind. In other words, you don't want to become frustrated, or angry, or impatient with the anger having arisen. Just know that anger has arisen, without making any judgements about it having arisen. You don't want the anger to become a stepping-stone --- a launchpad --- for a cascade of subsequent negative emotions.  Do not let anger suck you into its story, its narrative, its drama-vortex. Don't talk to yourself about the content of the anger. Your duty is only to know that anger, as a raw sensation, has arisen. The amount of time that you spend on any given instance of anger arising should not exceed the few milliseconds that it takes to acknowledge its presence and nudge your attention back to whatever you were doing prior to the anger having arisen."

I think I had pretty much the same trouble as you 2 years ago before I started practicing meditation daily. In my opinion you are quick to anger because your mind can't stand the fact that not everything will go as planned/desired. Anger is just a desperate attempt to have every thing under your control, which is pretty much impossible, no matter who you are.  If you start meditating you will notice you will care less and less about the unplanned/undesired events that are a part of everyone's life."

Meditation,3dvizf,booodah,0,Mon Jul 20 09:46:06 2015 UTC,"""To achieve the transcendental state of consciousness, one must access a kind of internal fountainhead. This infinite reservoir of energy and intelligence has also been called Kundalini. Regular practice can habituate inner balance by improving an individual’s energy and intelligence through normalized hormone secretions and a calm nervous system. To achieve a transcendental state it is necessary that one trains his or her mind to achieve this state regularly and effortlessly. Fortunately the body cherishes this state of complete relaxation, therefore once this state has been attained a few times, the body will remember and more easily slide back into the transcendental state of peace and contentment. When the conscious mind reaches the source of thought and allows the convergence to shift the body into transcendental consciousness without twitching, they will then be filled with an energy and intelligence deeper than that of typical daily existence.   During the experience, the entire body will enter into what seems like a state of paralysis, and a tingling warmth will take over while the body re-calibrates the nervous system and stimulates the organs. Through exercising this technique, any individual can improve their ability and performance in a very natural way, thereby giving them an advantage to be more efficient, productive, and creative in life without accumulating excess stress and strain on the body temple due to the surmounting daily responsibilities of society."""
Meditation,3dsjvm,Scroke,85,Sun Jul 19 01:18:02 2015 UTC,"Invite your anxiety in for a cup of tea, but also remember to leave the back door open so that the anxiety can come and go as it pleases. You'd be surprised how powerful acceptance truly is. The moment you try to even remotely push your anxiety away is the moment anxiety will ask, ""What's for dinner? This snack you just fed me was delicious!"" Good luck trying to get anxiety to leave anytime soon after. No worries, just realize you've accidentally given it a snack, and wait until it decides to leave. If you try to throw anxiety out of the door, it will just come back even more pissed and ready to fuck up your shit. Hope this helps. As a beginner, I recommend just simple breath meditation and watching how the breath moves, especially in relation to different mind states. Once you are more capable of concentration, you'll get better and better at letting any thought or emotion come and go for a cup of tea. Sometimes it can turn into hours of tea. The most important thing to remember is this: the only way to truly let something go is to first allow it to be there. Only then when you are able to dive into the vast jungle of demonic ugliness can you grow power through understanding and cultivated awareness. How can we let go of something we cannot see?"

It's your brains natural defense against anxiety, trying to separate you from excess stimulus so it can get a rest. It's not something that will continue forever; as the anxiety reduces, so will the fog you feel. If meditation helps reduce your anxiety, which it certainly does for me, then it will reduce the fog as well. Over time, I also found one of the best ways to lower anxiety is to simply keep busy. Well, not simply, since that's not always easy, but try to occupy most of your day with work or activities. Anxiety, and thus brain fog, can be brought on by both overstimulation and under-stimulation. Good luck, it all gets better with time.  Tl;dr - Meditation usually reduces anxiety, and reducing anxiety reduces brain fog. Give it a shot, you've got nothing to lose."

Even if you feel the underlying issue is anxiety, these things might worsen your condition.   Also, helpful to me with my anxiety has been reminding myself that I do not have to believe everything I think. Meaning we have the power to choose what we believe.

But you need to be patient as it can take time to work, it takes years for us to build up our personal neuroses so they can't be overcome by any quick fix I suppose, drop by drop. What Dippydawg says here is very true .. ""Infact a lot of our thoughts are absolutely ridiculous gibberish. This, I think is one of the lessons that comes through from meditation and why it's beneficial to people who suffer from anxiety."" As you start to practice meditation and learn to just recognise and look at your thoughts more objectively without being pulled away on journeys of association by them they start to have less and less power you see them for what they are, just empty passing mental phenomena that come and go like passing waves on a beach. It's easy to rationalise and verbalize that idea but you have to practice meditation a bit to experience it and to understand this more intuitively.  Another thing I noticed years ago was that I often felt anxious when I hadn't eaten properly too. Sometimes thoughts can spring from a physical cause that can just be a very basic primal tension or nervousness in the gut that we are not always aware of. What's also good with meditation is after a while you become much more aware of these physical sensations and then start to notice how they interact with and influence asubsequent thought process that almost feeds off them.  It sounds weird but after 6 months or so of meditation I started to feel just from repetitive observation that I sort of had 2 brains that were the source of many emotions and feelings, one in the stomach and another in the head and that they would interplay feeding off each other.   As I learned by pure observation to separate the physical from the mental and just see them interact it was fascinating. All that comes from careful relaxed and non-judgemental observation which takes a bit of practice but I definitely think meditation can help. Good luck."
Meditation,3dsjvm,WalterWhitesLeftNut,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:26:31 2015 UTC,"You may also try breathing exercises, which helps to calm the nervous system and bring clarity to the mind.  This is one of the several techniques of Pranayama (Yogic Breathing).   Close your right nostril with your right thumb, and breath in through the left nostril, counting 4 Then close your left nostril with your right index finger, open the right nostril, and breathe out counting 8   You can go for 3-6, or 5-10, 6-12, etc. The important thing is that the exhalation be twice the length of the inhalation.  Breathing should be soft, even, and as soundless as possible. Do not force yourself, it should be comfortable. So adjust your count according to your capacity.   In the beginning it may be a bit hard to get the exhalation twice as long as inhalation, but by time and patience we get there.  You can practice this for 5~15min. It is very relaxing. After that you can just breath normally, and follow with your meditation practice of focusing the attention on the breath, on a mantra, or on the space between the eyebrows."

It finally came to a head in college and mediation feels like it's the only thing that has truly helped me. (SSRIs never worked.)  The clearheadedness I feel now was something I had never experience before. It was like when I first got glasses in middle school, and I learned that not everyone felt as blind as I did.   Also if you are in to unconventional remedies, I would recommend LSD. It's not so much the trip that makes me feel good but the vacancy left by the trip. It's like it turned the volume down on the world to a point that I could actually process the information instead of being terrified by it. But if you do decide to try it, start small, 25ug is enough to get an idea and feel the positive affects. You would rather be underwhelmed than overwhelmed. Trust me."

Meditation,3dt3yk,Sarkastik_Knome,8,Sun Jul 19 04:55:05 2015 UTC,"Combine awareness with equanimity. If you just watch stuff (awareness) then things might just intensify unless you're lucky. So you add in equanimity, which can be done by noticing in the moment how impermanent things are (like the tingles in your toes or the mood you're in, everything, just see how long things last),  and this can bring about a particular flavor of non-reactive clarity that feels like it is cooling.   It's not quite 'calm,' because most people think of calm as the facile 'relaxation' exercise type of calm; equanimity is deeper than this because it is partly based on the ultimate truth that all things pass; this truth can help us relax our clinging and aversion because whatever's happening will pass without any struggle or being upset, all things will pass."
Meditation,3dt3yk,Sampajanna,4,Sun Jul 19 05:04:07 2015 UTC,"when you become angry at a person, being mindful of the feeling of anger is only the first step. the next step is to open to that person, and what they're feeling. if you observe the anger and where it is coming from, it's likely you'll find that it stems from feeling misunderstood. at it's root, you are not understanding her and how she feels, and she is not understanding you and how you feel. to move through the experience, you'll need to open to why the conflict is arising and experience that in attention.    you are doing it right. dealing with these feelings is not easy. you may not have control over how you feel, but you have control over how you react to those feelings. react by opening and doing your best to understand."
Meditation,3dt3yk,staticwarp,4,Sun Jul 19 06:59:41 2015 UTC,"Today I had a situation with my girlfriend where I started to feel angry. I used mindfulness to note this feeling and to become aware of it. But this feeling has stayed with me all day, and I can't seem to shake it. Being mindful of this feeling didn't seem to do much, so I don't really understand if I'm doing this wrong or how I'm supposed to deal with these feelings without blowing up.   You cannot shake this feeling precisely because you're actively trying to deal with it. Stop trying to be mindful, trying to shake the feeling. Mindfulness is passive, not active.  You don't need to deal with these feelings. You think you do because you're constantly thinking about what should be happening, what you should be feeling, and getting upset because the world isn't matching your expectation of what should be happening. That's why you feel like you might blow up.  That said, it's important to note that not actively dealing with these feelings doesn't mean not responding to them. It's possible that you're trying to deal with these feelings because you don't want to deal with the situation -- treating the symptom to avoid the underlying cause."

If you do not deal with the feelings what should you be doing? How can you sit back and be passive toward a reactive emotion?  As I understand it, if a person is angry in the present moment then that is the situation. What do you mean by dealing with the situation rather than the feeling of anger?   If I am mad because I did not get ice cream is it important to find a way to get ice cream or is it more important to accept and be at peace with the moments when I do not have ice cream?"
Meditation,3dt3yk,Gojeezy,2,Sun Jul 19 13:55:53 2015 UTC,"Been thinking about me much?   Anger is a hindrance to mindfulness.   No thing that arises in your consciousness can prevent you from being mindful, because you can always attend to what you're currently experiencing, no matter what that may be. To say you cannot be mindful if you're experiencing anger is like saying you cannot count to a hundred because of the number 93. It makes no sense.   Being angry in itself is being reactive. If you do not deal with the feelings what should you be doing? How can you sit back and be passive toward a reactive emotion?   I didn't say be passive towards anger. I even said ""it's important to note that not actively dealing with these feelings doesn't mean not responding to them"". I said mindfulness is passive. It seems in your eagerness to make a bid for my attention you made little attempt to comprehend what I wrote.   How do you think the idea that ""mindfulness is passive"" relates to my suggestion that you can respond to feelings like anger? Maybe next time, before you reply to one of my posts, you should spend a few seconds to consider such things, so you don't end up asking questions that are answered in the post you're replying to.   As I understand it, if a person is angry in the present moment then that is the situation. What do you mean by dealing with the situation rather than the feeling of anger?   If you read a little further, you'd notice I clarified that comment by saying ""treating the symptom to avoid the underlying cause"". Since you apparently still cannot understand what I'm saying, I'll give you an example.  Let's say that I exclaimed to reddit ""/u/gojeezy is stalking me because he's desperate for my attention!"" and in reaction you felt anger and also thought ""I'm not a stalker! I'm an advanced meditator with lots of progress and attainment, and I'm following him around because I'm so wise and charitable that I help such lowly peons!"" The hindrance to mindfulness in this example isn't the anger or the thought about how you're so great. The hindrance is the rejection of the fact that you're desperate for my attention, an aversion to that idea. That is the underlying cause of both the thought and the anger.  In this situation, you might believe that the anger is the problem and therefore actively try to block it out, try to change the situation. In my post, I referred to such attempts as ""actively dealing with the feelings"", since that was how the OP used it. If instead, you ""dealt with the situation"", you wouldn't attempt to change what you were currently experiencing, but would survey what you were experiencing, form a plan, and then act. So ""dealing with the feelings"" involves trying to change your current mental state. ""Dealing with the situation"" involves being aware of your mental state, and then acting based on what you're experiencing. ""Dealing with the situation"" doesn't involve trying to change the present moment.   If I am mad because I did not get ice cream is it important to find a way to get ice cream or is it more important to accept and be at peace with the moments when I do not have ice cream?   Anger at what is is futile, sure, but that doesn't make anger worthless. It is useful in many situations. Some children discover that anger helps them get ice cream."

If it's been with you all day, you've indulged it somehow...or else it wouldn't be with you. It might pop up now and then, but that's different than what you are saying.  Mindfulness is simple: you either indulge those feelings (which perpetuates them, makes them stay around longer, and usually gives rise to more feelings) OR you let them be as they are, independent from you and your attention.

Instead, I'm talking about where you focus your attention. ""Letting them be as they are"" means you move your attention away from them and back to the present moment (or your breath if meditating).   It means you aren't dwelling on them, indulging them, perpetuating them.  Anger arises, you notice it, ""there's anger."" What do you do next? Indulge it, or move your attention away from it?"
Meditation,3dt3yk,elphabaloves,0,Sun Jul 19 14:09:45 2015 UTC,"Passing away means something that has arisen in our perception will eventually disappear. Sensations constantly arise and pass away. Just try pinching yourself. The pain arises then slowly fades (passes away). Why do you see that as a figure of speech?  If it is a reaction or a manifestation of the false sense of self and you move your attention away from it what is left to sustain it? It is sustained by being dwelt on and by being indulged in. If you are not dwelling on it, indulging it or perpetuating it what would sustain it? Will it not dissipate, i.e., pass away?"

If you want to say it's still there for awhile - 5 minutes, an hour, a day - you just aren't focusing your attention on it, that's cool too.

Meditation,3dsvnr,nicolemriker,4,Sun Jul 19 03:22:16 2015 UTC,"Nicole,  Welcome to /r/Meditation!  When you're doing Samatha (tranquility meditation) and you find yourself progressively developing deeper levels of concentration and calm, then you're on the right track. When you're doing Vipassana (insight meditation) and you find that Mindfulness (spontaneous awareness of, e.g., feelings, thoughts) is progressively arising more often, automatically, then you're on the right track.  One way to get started with Samatha would be to focus deeply on something internal (e.g., your breath or a mantra). Repeatedly, your mind will wander off. When it does; just know that it has; without any judgement, frustration, or annoyance; and simply nudge your focus of attention back to whatever you choose as your meditation object.  One way to get started with Vipassana would be to watch your body throughout your daily life. When you are sitting, know that you are sitting. When you are walking, know that you are walking. When you are laying down, known that you are laying down. When you are eating, know that you are eating. Whatever your body happens to be doing, just know so. Know so neutrally; your job is only to observe, not to have any particular disposition toward what your body is doing at any given time.  Many people choose to do Samatha followed by Vipassana as Samatha has a restorative and energizing effect that powers their Vipassana practice.  Please feel free to ask whatever followup questions that you may have. We're here to help."

The mind will begin to wander. When you notice it has (a moment of mindfulness) return focus to the breath. Rinse and repeat.   Sometimes a moment of mindfulness is not enough to let go of thoughts (when trying to return to your anchor) though.

Meditation,3dubuc,binnorie,3,Sun Jul 19 15:35:09 2015 UTC,"There are many approaches and methods of mantra practice. It varies according to the tradition of the practice; so it's good that you're looking for a center or teacher, so that you can get consistent, integrated teaching rather than a smattering of various (reasonable or unfounded) opinions on an indistinct collection of different practices.  Is your goal to feel more focused, or to be more focused? They are not the same. Don't attach to feeling. This in itself will help your focus, as you will not be chasing after appearances. When you don't chase after appearances your mind can be still; and then you can apply it to your positive activity.  You won't necessarily always know when you're more or less focused. The mind is like a mirror; it reflects what appears in it. So the task is to come closer to your mirror-like nature and to disengage with the things that come and go as images (i.e., thoughts, feelings, sense objects, events). But until you are able to perceive the difference between your basic reflecting mind and the images that appear in it, sometimes you might think that you are not focused when in fact your focused mind is just reflecting outside movement like a chaotic situation or an upheaval of thinking.  The problem is not with thinking but with attachment to it. The problem is not with appearance but with the assumption that it has its own reality apart from the mind.  All this by way of saying that you don't need to judge your practice. This is a kind of hindrance. Only do it; then you will get the fruit of it. But yes, you should learn a method properly: the why and the how of it.  There are many good centers in New York. The question is which ones will teach mantra meditation. I know that the Kwan Um School center (Chogye International Zen Center) teaches mantra practice along with other methods, and the teachers can help you use it as your main practice if you choose. In case you need some evidence that you can get the results you're seeking, you can see for yourself that the teachers there are quite focused.  Regarding the avoidance of anything too religious: (From the video on the Chogye IZC page linked to above, What is Zen?)    Zen is before words, and it points to a question that is there before concepts, philosophy, or religion.   Aside from that, you can do a Google search for meditation in New York and make some calls inquiring about their style of practice."
Meditation,3dubuc,TheHeartOfTuxes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:21:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your thoughtful response!   Regarding feeling or being more focused, I think my goal is to be more focused. I want to be able to use my mind more efficiently. I'm looking to be able to live my life better, accomplish my goals with more happiness, control and ease. I'm hoping to learn how to deal with problems more readily, with calmness and positivity. I have a tendency towards anxiety and spaciness. I would like to curb those habits.   So, if I'm understanding you properly, I shouldn't judge my practice based on what I feel. Is that right?  I'll check out the Chogye International Zen Center and see if they can guide me - thank you for that suggestion."
Meditation,3dubuc,TheHeartOfTuxes,2,Mon Jul 20 01:47:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, right. That goes a long way toward freedom.  Usually, we are moved here and there by our feelings. We always chase feelings we like and run away from feelings we don't like. Correct meditation has a bravery to it: to remain stable and not get swept here and there by feeling.  But also we don't avoid feeling. We perceive. Be the witness rather than getting all caught up in appearances of thought and feeling. Witness it all coming and going. The witness is stable.  So an object of meditation helps you remain stable. You have something definite to return to. When thought or feeling takes you away, no problem; once you realize it, instantly and in a neutral way just return to the object (in your case, the mantra).  Returning, returning, gradually your returning becomes stronger than your going away. You become more stable as the witness.  It is like climbing to a vantage point and being able to see everything around. You are no longer caught up in it, thrown about here and there, but you can still see and respond."

The whole experience is indescribable - it just can't make sense without experiencing it. I find there are common and important stages of a trip.   self-consciousness - where you feel anxious about something. You recognise the 'bad-vibes' associated with feeling anxious.  Realisation -  You can understand how your thoughts eventuate into external world. You can become detached from your ego and step into the seat of the observer. Egoless thought - You're brain's capacity to think of massive concepts in this state is wonderful. You don't have the thought filter of the ego and this makes you feel really connected - like the barrier that your ego forms is removed and you are magnetised to life. This is where you are a god.  Reality over again - Personally my mind takes me back through the most fundamental things I understand about reality. It's like Cosmos or some documentaries about life, the universe, physics and our place as humans.

Meditation,3dqnr7,Sampajanna,8,Sat Jul 18 20:47:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe it'll clear things up to read this meditation instruction from him. I'll share a little excerpt that tries to explain what Harris is going for:   Simply rest as that condition in which sounds and sensations and emotions arise and change and pass away.  Take a moment to feel the sensations of your face and head.  Perhaps it feels like your awareness is 'behind' your face, or 'in' your head.  But the feelings of your face and your head are in awareness in this moment.  They're appearing in the same condition.  They're appearing in the same 'place' where you're thinking.  Your thoughts are not in your head, your awareness or consciousness is not in your head, as a matter of experience. Everything is appearing, moment by moment, in consciousness.  This includes the feeling of having a head, the feeling of being behind your face, looking out at a world that is other than what you are.  In fact, what you're calling the world is appearing in this same space...  That which is aware of sleepiness is not in fact sleepy. That which is aware of restlessness is not in fact restless.  Meditation is simply a means to continually drop back into this state, of mere witnessing of everything that arises."
Meditation,3dqnr7,sleepycorn,2,Sat Jul 18 15:56:28 2015 UTC,"That is the Headless Way, also a type of Dzogchen meditation. And while Harris does advocate that, I think it's misleading to say that's the main thing he is trying to do with his book. It was one of 4-6 techniques he suggested, wasn't it?  And the point of the book wasn't even that. The point of the book is to say that it's actually possible to reduce your suffering by becoming less entangled in the illusion of self. And that this is neuroscience, not mysticism."
Meditation,3dqnr7,Sampajanna,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:46:55 2015 UTC,"That is the Headless Way, also a type of Dzogchen meditation.   It is highly questionable that Douglas Harding's self-taught awakening method is a type of advanced Tibetan Buddhist meditation teaching. Sam Harris, when referencing Harding in 'Waking Up,' wasn't saying that the Headless Way was actually the same way as Dzogchen. Harris was just explaining that Harding's description of his state of 'Headlessness' was very similar to Harris's experiences practicing Dzogchen. But Harris says many times in the book that to actually get the authentic Dzogchen experience, you need a Dzogchen teacher. For actual Dzogchen, check out works from figures like Padmasambhava, Shabkar Lama and Chogyam Namkhai Norbu, not Douglas Harding.   while Harris does advocate that, I think it's misleading to say that's the main thing he is trying to do with his book. It was one of 4-6 techniques he suggested, wasn't it?   Did you see the rest of the meditation instruction I linked? I typed only an excerpt. Here is another part from the link:   gradually become aware of the process of breathing.   That's touching on the 'vipassana'-flavored 'technique' from the book. Then he touches on the emotion-driven technique from the book when he starts to say:   Take a moment to recall something that bothers you — a disappointment, or a recent embarrassment. Some conversation that went terribly.   Either way, Harris does happen to believe that the summit of 'reducing our suffering' is to abide as the intrinsically-equanimous property of consciousness, and that way is best done in Harris's view through the 'Headless' experience (and the way for Harris is Dzogchen). For a more in-depth talk on Harris's actual view of real Dzogchen, on the illusion of self, and the freedom from suffering we can get from realizing these things, I suggest this 2-hour-plus discussion between Harris and dhamma teacher Joseph Goldstein.    The point of the book is to say that it's actually possible to reduce your suffering by becoming less entangled in the illusion of self. And that this is neuroscience, not mysticism.   I'm confused. How does this relate to what I directly quoted from Sam Harris? He has written that we become free from suffering the illusion of self by doing the Dzogchen-style techniques of witnessing everything, and then, ""[o]nce one recognizes the selflessness of consciousness, the practice of meditation becomes just a means of getting more familiar with it."" That's what the last line of my quote is saying: the mere witnessing of everything that arises, is what consciousness is doing, and consciousness is intrinsically free of self. ""The goal, therefore, is to cease to overlook what is already the case,"" that consciousness is free of the illusion of self and is witnessing everything that arises, free from grasping at self.   neuroscience, not mysticism.   Maybe they don't have to be separated, at least according to Sam Harris:   Mysticism is a rational enterprise. Religion is not. The mystic has recognized something about the nature of consciousness prior to thought, and this recognition is susceptible to rational discussion. The mystic has reasons for what he believes, and these reasons are empirical. The roiling mystery of the world can be analyzed with concepts (this is science), or it can be experienced free of concepts (this is mysticism).  —Sam Harris, 'The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason' (p. 222)"

Meditation,3dqnr7,Sampajanna,0,Sun Jul 19 04:19:13 2015 UTC,"What about all of my other points?  My question about the relation wasn't rhetorical, it was about the fact that your point didn't seem to engage the actual substance of what I had submitted, there was no explanation of how what you said undermined or directly engaged the guided meditation excerpt. So I am asking how what you said exactly engaged what I said, how it is related, not that I think they're unrelated. Your sentence was just a very general statement about one vague project he has had for a while, and your saying of what it was didn't seem to shed light on, criticize, or counter anything I had submitted, but then you said that your point was 'neuroscience not mysticism', implying that something I had said was...mysticism by comparison or something? and then I submitted Sam Harris directly saying that mysticism wasn't necessarily a bad thing. I'm submitting direct quotes to back up what I can. If you have counters, I'd like to see your citations if you can do me that favor.   Sam thinks that the way to gain that freedom from suffering to which you were referring is through meditating in the way that I submitted him guiding us in my first comment. The fact that the entire book wasn't about the technique doesn't mean that it's not one of the crucial keys of his path and project; he spends most of the book explaining the need for experiencing the results of that centerpiece (the way to abide as intrinsically-selfless consciousness) and he spends a bunch of time offering a philosophy around it that's appealing to skeptics.   I genuinely don't understand what you're arguing about. I'm not trying to defend anything, I'm just kinda confused at your responses. I submitted a guided meditation excerpt of all Sam Harris which he produced while he was writing 'Waking Up,' and during that guided meditation he includes almost all the techniques from the book (except for the eye gazing one), and the techniques are key because they are the how, and then I included the 'what' that Sam was saying we should be going for during that meditation: become free from suffering (neuro-scientifically if you like) by doing what I submitted, which helps you observe things in the mode of consciousness which is intrinsically free from self."

I submitted a guided meditation excerpt of all Sam Harris which he produced while he was writing 'Waking Up,'... almost all the techniques from the book   Okay, first of all, I was confused. I thought that was just the Headless Way (since there are so many variants). Secondly, my take on the OP's question was that he/she wants to understand the book more deeply. It's primarily a nonfiction work that makes a group of claims about consciousness, motivates the claims, and supports them. So when the OP asks what he should take away from it, I think describing the meditation exercises is a mis-characterization. It is important, but it was not the thesis of the book. I thought it was a pretty small part (though I skipped around when I read it).   there was no explanation of how what you said undermined or directly engaged the guided meditation excerpt   Right, I just didn't feel that was an actual answer to the OP's question. The reason I considered that misleading was that the OP asked ""What should I take away from this book"", and it is not primarily a book about how to meditate."

Meditation,3dqnr7,flowfall,3,Sat Jul 18 18:58:19 2015 UTC,"Awareness and consciousness are interchangeable here:  A consistent theme in the book is that we are awareness, flexible, expansive, all encompassing, and the end goal is to no longer identify as our thoughts but as awareness, to increasingly condition ourselves so that is our default. You don't have to eliminate all thought to do this, for you can be aware of thought itself, you only push away thoughts in the beginning because it is easier to get in touch with that awareness since we're so used to grasping to thought.  Once we have gotten comfortable with just observing, we ditch the need to push away thoughts, and simply watch them too. Concentrating on the breath is essentially the training wheels. Being open awareness, consistently, is the goal.  We are the sum of our experiences for our awareness becomes our experience, but thoughts are part of the experience too, and need not be eliminated. They are useful for planning and reflection. They have their purposes, we just need to be able to choose whether to be lost or not, to interact or dismiss.  Plus, Harris himself is skeptical if all thought can be permanently eliminated.  We recondition our habit of grasping at anything, thoughts included, and then there's no need to eliminate thoughts, we just watch them like any other content of consciousness passing by.  One cool thing I stumbled upon not long after reading the book is:  You can be aware of sensations,You can be aware of your emotions, You can be aware of your memories, You can be aware of your thoughts, You can be aware of the fact that you are being aware. But if we are not our thoughts, our senses, or emotions, and we are simply watching. Who or what is watching? Awareness envelopes everything, but what comes before awareness? Assuming we are not what we are aware of."

Meditation,3dqnr7,Sentient_Star_Stuff,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:07:43 2015 UTC,"shake off distracting thoughts   I think it's more to shake off being lost in distraction instead of trying to remove thought entirely. The funny thing is  the more one rests as the witness/awareness, the more one's mind becomes still and focused. Thoughts still arise, but the space between them grows. If one were to do strict concentration practice, then eventually thought would drop off completely and one would enter into a profound stillness and silence - I'm not sure total silence is ever even necessary.  TL;DR Shake off the distracting element of phenomena versus attempting to remove phenomena entirely."

Meditation,3dqnr7,Tabularasa00,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:15:33 2015 UTC,"Interesting post. Here are my two cents. I have been practicing a generic form of 'mindfulness' meditation for the past few months, I found the results so compelling after 6 months that I started to look more deeply into the whole subject of meditation both in scientific study and traditional buddhist texts.  I delved more deeply into the underlying buddhist philosophy side of things and discovered Vipassana through listening to talks by Joseph Goldstein (one of the first westerners to bring back some of the Eastern teachings to the West, he has lots of content on youtube).    Then I was intrigued to find that both Sam Harris and Goldstein were long term friends, they recently had a very detailed and quite esoteric debate on meditation which is available for download on Sam Harris' site. What struck me about their debate was how Harris was first of all a long term meditator which I was unaware of previously. Secondly what intrigued me was how Harris seemed to be pushing Goldstein to find out if years and years of meditation had served him any real or lasting purpose. Harris felt that while in intensive retreat (meditating hours per day for 3 months or so) he had gained profound insight but then in returning to everyday life it had had a less lasting 'usable' (for lack of a better term) impact. Although quite familiar with Harris already I then read 'Waking Up'. As a beginning meditator I was intrigued by his questioning of Goldstein and was obviously keen to to explore all possibilities and opinions to avoid pitfalls at the very outset rather than commit myself to 20 years of treading meditative water so to speak. Harris seemed to suggest that he had been meditating for years but wasn't really getting anywhere. Now I understand that striving for results is a form of grasping and expectation that is not a correct mindset for practice but that said I found his ideas interesting as a beginner.  Waking Up introduced me to Dzochen, Sam speaks of receiving 'pointing out instructions' from a Dzochen master that were quite profound;  “I came to Tulku Urgyen yearning for the experience of self-transcendence, ” he writes, “and in a few minutes he showed me that I had no self to transcend.”  Sam talks about Dzochen but his advice in the book was basically to go find a qualified guru in this practice and then… good luck! I am sure many seasoned long term meditators and Dharma practitioners would laugh at my naive explorations and can laugh at my musings but nevertheless it still struck me how Harris was sort of quizzing people like Goldstein in his typical analytical way to sort of find a more efficient and detailed step by step path to enlightenment and he seems to think in Waking Up that that path can be found through Dzochen practice. Now he might hold that opinion out of pure naivety form the perspective of a seasoned buddhist monk trained in Goldstein's practice but that doesn't mean we can't explore his ideas.  Intrigued this lead me to a guy called Alan Wallace. Another westerner with considerable experience like Goldstein but one who after 20 years of practice eventually came to Dzochen, what is unique Wallace is that he is one of the few Westerners who was ordained a monk, speaks Tibetan, practices Dzochen and has subsequently spent alot of time translating some of the key texts in this area with help and commentary from some of its most qualified practitioners alive today.  Alan Wallace stresses that before practicing meditation or Vipassana  in general 'mindfulness etc you should first gain a strong foothold in Shamatha. Shamatha is the basic form of meditation. A sort of conditioning of the mind to make it more stable and increase your faculties of attention to a very high degree. You are training in intense and deep concentration to create a mind that is exceptionally sane and very very stable. Then when you have gained some stability you can apply this to Vipassana or say receive the same 'pointing out' instructions as Harris did with a mind that is more stable balanced and much more receptive.   You are forging a more stable path to enlightenment rather then just having fleeting glimpses that you can't hold on to, your mind isn't up to the task. With Shamatha you end up with a better stronger and more serviceable mind perfectly set for insight. I downloaded a series of talks by Wallace at a week long retreat in Denmark and he explains in more detail in English how to meditate in a way Harris was alluding to in Waking Up. The 'No head' thing makes more sense if you listen to Wallace explaining Dzochen and how to create a strong and stable path towards it first by striving to perfect the quality and vividness of your meditation technique through Shamatha. So it seemed to me that people can spend 20 years meditating every day and achieve states of bliss, clarity and contentment but they can get stuck in it if they don't focus first on what the Buddha taught about Shamatha. Perfecting your practice so your attention is incredibly sharp and refined. THEN you can practice insight with a very attuned and stable mind. Otherwise you could spend 20 years wasting your time with a wishy washy meditation practice that is not stable and of a low quality. Your wasting your time. But maybe in the West this is fine for alot of people because they are not seeking the path or they don't actually believe that enlightenment is an attainable goal. This is what struck me with Harris in Waking Up  as he seemed to be pressing for the most efficient and proven path I suppose.  Wallace stresses that you must first get a foothold in Shamatha before approaching Dzochen or any practice for that matter. This will create the stability which will greatly improve Vipassana or whatever you turn your attuned and refined attention to. Sort of like sharpening the axe before attempting to cut down the tree. If you felt a bit bewildered after Harris talked about Dzochen then left the reader wanting more  I found Wallaces' books and his talks a good place to start as they are in English and digestible. Again to stress I am only a beginner too so I do understand that Dzochen is an advanced practice and that it is only one of many many paths, also it is not taught to everybody of course for obvious reasons of ability and suitability but  Wallaces' foundational ideas about Shamatha and how it is the foundation of creating an authentic practice are very interesting to me and are a good place to start for any meditator who wants to really improve the quality of their practice. After 6 months in generic meditation I then started reading books on Shamatha, learning techniques on how to deal with the extremes of too much excitation or excessive mind wandering, versus  the the opposite of too much lethargy,sleepiness and laxity in your practice. How to focus better for longer, being both relaxed yet also focused at the same time, its sort of teaching you in a very tactical way how to find that knife edge balance.  I have made much faster and more significant progress this way by improving the basic quality of my meditations, maximizing quality over quantity of time spent I suppose. I recommend looking into Shamatha first anyway. It was through reading waking up that i moved to trying to perfect Shamatha over a more generic (when the mind wanders just bring it back to the breath etc) practice (Dzochen as a someday goal!!!) and I have found a much more stable and consistent meditative practice by studying it anyway with much more significant gains in a much shorter period of time."
Meditation,3dqnr7,elphabaloves,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:59:52 2015 UTC,"Interesting comment. Where do you recommend one starts with Wallace's work, be it books or audio/video?"
Meditation,3dqnr7,Tabularasa00,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:10:14 2015 UTC,"I started with some of his audio then bought one or two of his books later to get more detail on specific Shamatha techniques. The whole Dzochen thing is something I plan to look at in the future. There are a series of recordings from one of his retreats here:  http://alan-wallace-gomde-2014.moving-meditation.dk/. Now it's interesting stuff but very long and esoteric and he goes on alot about his ideas about consciousness and the universe and chucks in the odd bit of quantum physics here and there. It gets a bit sort of Deepak Chopra woo woo science at times (Wallace did actually study physics however) but that said there is gold in there if you have the time to just play it and dig through it. There are some really interesting guided meditations that are refreshingly detail specific though. I just cut them up with an audio editor pulled out some of the those then kept the other stuff for occasional review, There's alot of content. But the guided meditations on day 02 (@25:48) and particularly day 03 (@10:49) are quite good introductions to basic Shamatha. I got alot out of these and am still working in this area.  After that he moves into Dzochen techniques like meditating without a sign, and using the mind as the object of meditation, all done with the eyes open too, I found that quite challenging so am content to just work on Shamatha with the breath as the object of attention for the time being, trying to maximise attention and the overall quality of my own meditation. He also has other audio content available free on iTunes from other retreats but I haven't listened to any of those yet.   As for books I have read his work, ""The Attention Revolution."" which is quite digestible and focuses mainly on Shamatha, it's more for the popular Western market. Another good one that's lighlty more esoteric again but even better with detailed specifics in terms of proper practice and good technique is ""How to practice Shamatha Meditation: the cultivation of meditative Quiescence."" This is a series of notes and translations he produced from a retreat with a master of the practice back in 1988. It's sort of something to read over again and again and refer to.   Harris seems to have been correct in his warnings about how much religious trappings you would have to be prepared to imbibe with Dzochen though so a bit of perseverance and patience is probably needed to get into this stuff and to try to understand it I would say. It's not as accessible, simplified and stripped of it's roots as other popular forms available in the West. There are times when you just have to loo up terminology and try to plow through it, stop furrying your brow for the umpteenth time trying to understand the terminology and language a bit and just struggle on. I'm really only a beginner so I wouldn't take any of my comments here as definitive advice of course, just sharing personal experiences and research here really. But if you find his stuff useful great."

His thesis seems to be: science and the meditative practice of contemplative individuals points to the premise that reality does not include the 'self.'    Further, while this realization may have benefits, it sounded to me more like Sam wanted us to simply recognize that the self is an illusion, thoughts/feelings arise all the time from various parts of the brain with no central locus, and that consciousness is something worth exploring without religious baggage.

Meditation,3drqj3,deadswans,4,Sat Jul 18 20:40:07 2015 UTC,"Meditation is supposed to allow you to face whatever it is that you are holding in you. It means you are on the right track.  A few important points to guide you along the way:  Self-compassion: Anyone in your exact background and situation would have similar feelings. No reason to blame yourself and feel like there is something wrong with you. Be kind to yourself and treat yourself like you would treat a good friend who is in a similar situation.  Acceptance & Patience: As much as we want these feelings to go away as soon as possible, that is not the right way to think about it. The work is not making them go away but making peace with them. It requires a lot of patience, and acceptance. It is basically personal growth, and it happens when it happens. We can't force it. So patience, patience, patience...  Off the cushion: Meditation is a powerful tool. But don't neglect the rest of your life. Being in good company, eating well, exercise, doing this that you enjoy are tremendously important.

Those are very important if you're having anything nearing the clinical or treatment-level.   If your approach to death anxiety has been to 'try to avoid thinking' about such-and-such, then meditation may not help you in that regard because meditation isn't ultimately about supressing thought or avoiding things. It's about changing how you see or relate to what arises, about not being fearful of the reality inside, about becoming harmonious with what is as opposed to what we would want things to be.   I'll be laying there trying out things I read or following audio guides for beginners   It can make a big difference what you try.

What I found personally were my thoughts instantly jumped to the worst possible things and the thoughts were what got me, the physical sensations were just sensations. If I run outside and have a racing heart I feel great, if I'm sitting inside thinking and my heart is racing and I'm Thinking about how everyone could die i get more anxious.  Once you sit and focus on the anxiety and are aware of your thoughts and watch and feel as it subsides you feel better. And it's always easier after that if it happens again.  Thich nhat Hahn also has great books on emotions and meditation.  I hope that helps!"

Smile when you're done. Once you can do this exercise with ease, try to visualize the numbers while you count-- see them in your mind. Smile when you're done."

Meditation,3dqamx,Vanthu,3,Sat Jul 18 18:18:28 2015 UTC,"This is the ""heart chakra"" that you are activating.    For most people, they feel it when they feel love -- a warm happy glowing feeling in their chest.  Often people experience the emotional connection of bringing their heart chakras together in a ""good hug"".      Most ""skeptics"" do not have the ability to feel these centers of consciousness (it's not  physical energy but it can feel like it, leading to cross communication between people who can sometimes feel these things and literal-minded skeptics)  The reason I put skeptics in quotes is that the position is a matter of perception.   If 90% of people were totally colorblind, then there would be plenty of skeptics who would not believe in color, and a few people who could see color.     Since some people are partially colorblind in various ways, if only 5% of people had ""true"" color vision and another 5% were partially colorblind in various ways, then skeptics would use the fact that people who claimed to see color did not always agree to consider the whole concept of color vision ""woo woo"".     So it's the same thing with chakras.   Chakras exist in consciousness, they are the inside experience of parts of your nervous system.   Some skeptics want to say that since there is no special unusual energy at the various chakras that this is somehow a proof that chakras do not exist, but there is nothing special about various wavelengths of light that make us see them in different colors, just the rods and comes of our eyes.    I didn't plan to spend this long on the skeptics part, but it becomes challenging because many people are extremely literal-minded.  I am sure that some will argue that physical differences between eyes could show that some can see color, but my point is that there is as yet no way to  prove that people perceive the inside of their nervous system differently yet.    The reason I am writing this long comment on this is that yoga meditation makes a lot of use of chakras, so that the experience of them becomes commonplace if you go deep enough in yoga meditation.    You actually do not need to go that deep at all, plenty of people in /r/meditation feel a sensation at their forehead chakra or see lights or various colors of blue/white/gold there.      It's not proof of anything except that people experience their nervous systems differently, but that does not mean that there are not inner features of your nervous system that you can use to attain various levels of consciousness.     The very difficult thing in a forum like this that is focused on consciousness is that there are many people who will argue that anything that cannot be detected by a machine is not real.   This poses a real challenge when people are discussing their experiences in consciousness, because none of that inner experience can yet be proven by any machines.     Finally, this does not mean that many people who believe in chakras are not full of bs themselves -- there is no need to have someone ""open"" your chakras, balance them, or what have you.   Just as some people refuse to believe anything they can not find in a high school physics text book, others are willing to believe anything."
Meditation,3dqamx,snickerpops,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:33:04 2015 UTC,"Well, thanks for this long comment.  I consider myself skeptic, but not the usual way (you describe).  For me, experience is the very first source of knowledge. Everykind of knowledge, I believe, can be reduced to making an experience and then generalizing it to a broader spectrum (I perceive two different chairs -> I see that they both can be sit upon -> other people call things we sit on ""chair"" -> I conclude, from those experiences, that these are both to put in the category ""chair"" as a stupid example). The same with ""a priori"" knowledge as numbers (I see a collection of things, I see a few other collections of things, I see that I could draw double-arrows from every object of one set to every other one of another set, I call all these things that have so-and-so-many things the ""n""-ness (e.g. twoness), and I invent a word for all these classes: two, three, ... and from there I deduce rules: if I put the two sets with two elements togehter, I get 4 elements. So: 2 + 2 = 4. And when this is once done, I subconsciously deduce more rules that allow me to add sets of things I have never seen, because the operations are the same: s_n(a) = n'th successor of a; e.g.: s_2(0) = 2. a + b = s_a(0) + s_b(0) = s_a(s_b(0)) = s_b(s_a(0)) = the a'th successor of b (or vice versa), and because we have a simple numeral system we can do this by just changing digits on a paper). I hope this attempt is a bit clearer now.  Ignoring any experience, how ""esoteric"" it might sound at first, hinders us on gaining knowledge, and it's our task (as skeptics) to gain as much knowledge about the real world as possible. This, as I said, is only possible due to senses.  Any experience I have that I cannot explain is a starting point to further investigation (e.g. tonk's answer, which sounds reasonable to me), not something I have to ""ignore away"" because I do not get it (right now).  So, now I have this experience described in the starting-post: I have no real idea what it is, so my task is to see whether I can explain it with what I know right now, and I couldn't. That's why I started this thread. ;-)  I also believe that Qualia is not ""shareable"" (Qualia = the ""what's it like to be this and that""), though reducable to physical matters.   Our experience is the only thing that allows us to have ""contact"" to the thing-in-itself, so we cannot ever dismiss any of it.  I do not believe in chakras, because I have no idea what they are supposed to be. But I wouldn't dismiss it just because some people talking about chakras and mixing them with (other?) bs.  I hope I made my point clearer. I'm hard to convince that those are chakras, but it's far from impossible.   And I want to thank you for your detailled reply."
Meditation,3dqamx,Dispassionfruit,2,Sat Jul 18 18:49:50 2015 UTC,"Consider evolution. Primitive organisms have a spinal column, but no brain, or an extremely small brain, yet these primitive creatures go about the business of surviving, reproducing, socially organizing etc. These patterns are all evidence of thought. You might say ""That's not thought, that's instinct"". OK, that works too. What is instinct or thought on this level? It is a drive or impulse that comes from somewhere. The theory of chakras is that these thoughts come from the spinal column, and that these different kinds of thought, survival, reproduction, socialization etc. come from different, specific parts of the spinal column. That's it. That's what chakras are. It's known by science that different thoughts come from different parts of the brain. Where is the strain in accepting this coming from? Because new age people believe it?  Take the story of Mike, the headless chicken: http://www.miketheheadlesschicken.org/history  This chicken lived for 18 months without a head. On what thought did this chicken continue to animate? The theory of chakras says the thought in it's spinal column.   Woo woo busted. There really is science behind it."
Meditation,3dqamx,redditsucksandsodoyo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:38:32 2015 UTC,"Well, why then call it other than ""spinal cord reflexes""? It just confuses people coming from a scientific or philosophical background (like me). Why mix words with new-age-people when you mean something completely different than they usually do (because they don't have any idea how they mean, usually).  I don't really believe that there is somekind of ""thought"" in the spinal cord though. There are mainly just quick reflexes and born-in-reactions to certain circumstances, which are, I agree, precursors of thoughts.  But as I said: I am quite open to new ideas if there is any good reason to believe them. And I can certainly feel something (though I am still not sure what it really is). So the ""what is that"" of that feeling is open for my quest for knowledge."
Meditation,3dqamx,Boycat89,2,Sat Jul 18 21:49:41 2015 UTC,"Well, why then call it other than ""spinal cord reflexes""?    Reflexes are automatic, unthinking.      I don't really believe that there is somekind of ""thought"" in the spinal cord though.   How would you know?    The spinal cord is filled with nervous tissue, and together with the brain makes up the central nervous system.     What's different about the nervous tissue in the spinal cord that makes it somehow incapable of consciousness?  You're just assuming that one set of neurons and synapses is capable of conscious thought, and that the other one is just automatic reflexes, like a power cord for a computer.    A parrot or a crow has been proven to be quite capable of high-level and abstract thought, and they have barely a walnut's amount of brain tissue in their tiny heads -- there is more than that in a few inches of spinal cord.    If you think the spinal cord is just simple reflexes, then you need to look at the very high level of sophistication of its anatomy.    Even I was amazed when I looked at that page and saw how complex the spinal column is.  It has both gray and white nervous tissue in it,'the same as the brain, and is protected by the same three membranes as the brain proper.    The main reason I am writing this is not because I care what you believe in -- you can worship Carl Sagan for all I care.   However the chakra system has been used by yogis for thousands of years to attain higher levels of consciousness, and the ancient methods that they have been using such as meditation are now the ""latest thing"" scientifically and culturally."

But with my own model of consciousness (I am working on this for my university), it needs memory. And afaik the spinal cord cannot have long-time-memory, and even short-time-memory and the ability to learn is not present there.  I might very well be wrong, and I'm surely taking a look into the link and try to find out more.  Thanks for that."

Meditation,3dt0jo,mamtic,4,Sun Jul 19 04:15:32 2015 UTC,"That is a great book. I don't know that this belongs in Meditation. Most people are not ready for this. Most people should be targeting a committed and loving relationship. Before I went for brahmacharya, I was in a committed and loving relationship where my discipline was to never have a sexual thought about anyone other than my partner for a period of several years. I was not 100% successful, but I was mostly successful. That was hard.   Shakti is the lifeforce within the spinal column. She is much more powerful than most people realize. In an orgasm, this power, this lifeforce energy gets channeled into the nervous system. That energy is then lost. This energy is the source of life. This energy is also the source of lust, of sexual thought. I was taught how to offer the energy of lust back into the spinal column. I haven't had a slip up in 6 months. Every once in a while I start to slip. Then I have to pull myself back from the brink. This is the only time there is any great effort any more. Most of the time, it is just a balancing act. Stay balanced and no carnal pictures in the head, no morning wood, no disturbing feelings, no erect.   The siddhis (super powers) only lead to pain. They are not the answer. If you are attracted to them, know you will have to walk away from them some day, like leaving a relationship that is bad for you.  My super power is I live in a raging fire of sat chit ananda. It's always burning. I am in peace, while waves of bliss rise up my body and pulses of the most intense love explode in my heart. I feel free and at peace, like being free of debt. I still don't have mastery of my emotions. I still get angry, sad and fearful at times, and lose life force that way. I didn't achieve this on my own, I have been studying under my Guru since 1982. I'm a slow learner and a poor student. Others have learned this much faster than I and have progressed far beyond where I have with it.   The purity of mind achieved in brahmacharya leads to some incredible levels of peace and bliss. Love is where it's at. Metta and Boddhichitta. That's where the little bird learns to really fly."
Meditation,3dt0jo,Vanthu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:51:31 2015 UTC,"Are you familiar with that book? Like I said, I personally believe there are benefits to be gained from semen retention. But the book surely is exaggerating both the benefits of semen retention, as well as the consequences of indulging in lust.   In a nutshell, ejaculating makes your body and mind extremely weak and feeble, while semen retention is the key to realization.   Do you agree with this?"
Meditation,3dt0jo,Vanthu,2,Sun Jul 19 17:26:30 2015 UTC,"I am very familiar with that book, and have read it extensively, though not recently.   I don't think the book is exaggerating. I think it is correct, but I think the aims of the book are beyond what most people are able to accomplish right away.   I do think that most people are better of in a committed and loving relationship than trying to force a semen retention program they are not yet ready for. For me, it became a natural progression based on the realizations I was building on over many years. I first had to be in a loving and committed relationship where I did allow my imagination to create images, and I did allow myself to feel attraction to only one person. I had to let my caring for this person to matter more to me than my own carnal desires. There was great benefit for me in doing that.   If you walk into a gym and try to bench press 300 lbs on your first day, you will hurt yourself. If you try to go full brahmacharya before you are ready, you will hurt yourself. It's ok to try to extend your time between, but don't overdo it. When I realized how orgasm (because this applies to both men and women) degenerates the mind and depletes the body, pulling up into full brahmacharya was a natural progression."
Meditation,3dt0jo,8732664792,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:23:14 2015 UTC,"I still think the book is exagerrating, and I think you think so too or you would be agreeing that not ejaculating is the most important thing for everybody no matter the cost.   But... I think I really like the book now. I am having a pretty difficult time with my urges right now, and rereading the book talking about how vile women and sex is and how one drop of semen is worth 80 pints of blood is quite inspiring and motivating when I'm feeling weak. Maybe since lust is so strong and ingrained, the author knew he had to stretch the truth a bit to get his point across.  Thank you for sharing. It sounds like retention worked well for you. I know it'll work well for me too if I could just refrain from mental fantasies."
Meditation,3dt0jo,Vanthu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:05:36 2015 UTC,"So wait, you never get morning wood or ejaculate in your sleep?   I have no problem with abstaining from sexual thoughts, but after about a week, I start having orgasms in my sleep and I'll also come a bit sometimes when I use the bathroom. What does your body do with the...product that it is creating while you redirect yourself/abstain from all sexual desire? Do you not experience the things I mentioned?"
Meditation,3dt0jo,ringer54673,2,Sun Jul 19 18:20:14 2015 UTC,"Correct.  I was never able to force the abstention either. The pull of desire is just too strong. Until I could see the source of where the desire comes from, then I could redirect the energy back to it's source before it gets manifested as an erection. The only time I ever feel desire any more is if I am doing one of the 8 things the book says you are not supposed to do.   I don't know, the energy just flows up into my spinal column and I experience it as peace, bilss, love. The energy never gets directed into my genitals and I never experience the pull of desire... unless I slip a little, but I have always been able to pull myself back from that brink before falling.  Of course, I have been buffeted by the strong winds of desire my whole life, just like everyone else. It is only in the last 6 months that I have been free of it."

With each step you take, count up to 100 in your mind. Focus only on the counting of your steps, and simply observe any thoughts that pass through your mind, but do this without attatchment. Don't label the distractions as ""good"", ""bad"", ""annoying"" or ""pleasing"", but simply note the existence of these thoughts, and continue counting. Each time you reach 100 steps, restart your count, going back from 1 to 100. A 10-15 minute walk daily should suffice.

(little extra: i remember when i started getting interested in meditation i was kinda skeptical maybe. so what i used to do was research about scientific benefits of meditation .. like for hours. and reading about people's success stories. that was a good boost for me to go to park, sit down and meditate the shit out of me) ;)"

Meditation,3dquff,Fuskers,3,Sat Jul 18 15:58:59 2015 UTC,"It seems more like an insight about change than an insight about the observer. Your post adds the extra step that says, because we are different (or are alienated by the old thoughts), then expressions couldn't be us. Well maybe they are us partly, but we simply change so much that looking back at old thoughts can feel quite dissimilar to our current thoughts. And we haven't changed as much between yesterday and today as we have between today and years back, and that is why the older thoughts seem more distinct: more because of the nature of change, maybe also the nature of memory (not that they're unrelated).   I'm not saying that we are our thoughts either. There are ways to explore that, like observing the semi random nature of their arising and how little they can be related to what you're actually wanting or considering.   But this post of yours seems to be more about assuming that there's a self that's unchanging  to imply that the changing thoughts (or alienation at old ones) are therefore separate from us, and also that we are that separate observer. I'm not necessarily against these ideas, but I'm not buying that this set of experiences necessarily implies the insights you're offering. I think this set of experiences is more closely related to insights about change over time, maybe memory too, than about the self/Observer necessarily."
Meditation,3dquff,Sampajanna,2,Sat Jul 18 16:28:04 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean. I seem to think of the ""observer"" as a pure self that is unchanging, like you said, but maybe that isn't so. You made it more apparent that we reside somewhere in between the two, but when I look back on emotionally driven pieces of mine, I can't help but feel that my ""higher self"" is looking at them with a more pure set of eyes, rather than a new pair. As thoughts and feelings pass over (under?) me, I sense a return to myself rather than a sense of change, but maybe that is only in the short term. I'll have to explore the idea of change more."
Meditation,3dquff,Sampajanna,2,Sat Jul 18 17:04:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your thoughts (no pun intended, hehe).   I am not against the idea of a higher or independent self, necessarily. I tried to put it out there that my comment was about what follows from that experience in your post (art -> change versus art -> observer), and not about what else is true generally outside of your post (maybe both change and Self/Observer are true outside of the post).  I like it when people take the time to connect their direct lives to spiritual or abstract ideas. That's when I think the rubber hits the road and these teachings start to make a difference in our daily lives. So I think that's important to remember: the habit of wondering how your real life contains or expresses these teachings is almost more important than what we conclude at any given time about the expressions. Good on you for having that habit!"
Meditation,3dquff,lost_lurker,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:32:55 2015 UTC,"IMHO the observer isn't self either. It is still interdependent with other phenomena and is without a fundamental unchanging essence as are all conditioned things. It's in Buddhist terminology ""empty"". Not to say that it doesn't exist or that it doesn't have a purpose but that doesn't make it a self."
Meditation,3dquff,garden-of-peace,2,Sat Jul 18 19:16:21 2015 UTC,"The observer is indeed not-self. When one's practice develops sufficiently, one sees -- much like all thoughts rise and fall -- that the observer itself also rises and falls."

The sages observed this flow of thoughts and sensations and asked, ""Then where am I?"" The parts (thoughts, feelings, ""the observer"") do not add up to a whole; they just flow by. Like physical phenomenon, the mind is a field of forces.   In my opinion, it's important to remember that even identifying as an observer will get you caught up. (although maybe necessary at first) I believe thoughts, the observer, emotions, ego, all are one, in constant flux.

The other half is actually dwelling in that ""gap"" as someone earlier put it.... BUT don't make it a goal or objective to be ""there"", just get ""there"" naturally, after witnessing thoughts.... and if you don't get ""there"", oh well, you still observed your thoughts like a referee from the sideline, so you are still reaping benefits.

If you have a goal and progress in mind you are not meditating. By insisting that there is a goal you already subject yourself to missing the mark. Goals are made in the realm of concept which ultimately can never measure up to reality so you are doomed to fail from the start. The benefits and insights or whatever are byproducts.

I start to imagine my body slowly getting heavier, starting from the tip of my toes, up my legs, to my torso, then my shoulders and neck, and finally my head.

Meditation,3dpt2d,lost_lurker,2,Sat Jul 18 19:26:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah might be a good idea to change your location and see if that helps. Exercise will be good even if its just 20-30 minutes of brisk walking each day listening to a podcast / audiobook / music or something. That breathing exercise helps me out sometimes when i have trouble sleeping so it's worth giving it a go.  When you say you are keeping your thoughts clear what do you mean by this? The purpose of meditation isn't to clear thoughts but to cultivate Awareness & or Concentration.   Typically in mindfulness meditation you use the breath as an anchor to go back to when you get distracted by a thought. You become aware of the thought/distraction and calmy return your awareness to the breath. Then repeat this consistently which all the while increases your level of mindfulness.   The other popular form of meditation is Samatha which trains mainly concentration first and moves to awareness in the later stages.  You gotta be careful of being too forceful in approach as this can cause some issues and just a guess here but if this forceful approach is causing excess frustration then maybe your mind is linking this frustration with laying down in your bed.  Maybe a good idea to read up a bit more on your technique & approach. This place has a load of info, I like shinzen young (has some good audiobooks and web articles) & ajahn brahm too."
Meditation,3dpt2d,MerchantR,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:42:20 2015 UTC,I just had to correct this mistake! I was meditating laying down in my bed for over a month because it was really comfortable and facilitated deep concentration but when I tried to go to sleep at night I couldn't. If you don't want to sit you can put a small folded blanket or pillow under your tailbone and a pillow under your head and put your feet flat on the floor with your knees up pointing to the ceiling. That way you're still laying down but not associating your meditation with the bed. Aparrently it's really bad sleep hygiene to do anything other than sleep or sex in your bed.  Best of luck.

Meditation,3dpgtx,Solieus,3,Sat Jul 18 12:35:55 2015 UTC,"People seem to have jumped on you for something that some of your words seem to have said, but that the totality of your words did not mean: you're not literally a force-feeding, evangelical meditator...you were just asking about the experience of benefiting from meditation and consequently noticing that it sure would be great if others experienced that benefit too. What to do at that point? Great question.   I never understood how to crack that myself until I came across a very popular principle from the well known 12-Step traditions: ""our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion."" It means that you only try to embody what you're promoting while living your daily life, and you let that become the 'scent' that attracts the nose of the interested. Someone may come along and ask one day, 'wow...we're doing the same job but I'm over here being stressed and you're not at all -- what's the secret?' That's when you get to explain or share what you're embodying: at the point when the person says that they now want what you have and/or want to be taught, not before then.   Otherwise (and I've been on BOTH sides of this): we can turn people off by giving unsolicited help that can make them feel insecure, like if we started giving weight loss advice to someone who didn't think they were 'fat' or didn't think that we were very fit."

What I wanted to get at with my less than tactful question is ideas for reaching / inspiring non-meditation audiences with my videos. Sort of like how the ""10% happier"" author Dan Harris addresses skeptics with his outsider tone, or how Sam Harris seems to address the atheist / sciency crowd (haven't read his book yet though). I myself was a ""chance convert"" to meditation. I'm planning on doing more of a sciency and self development approach since I find those topics interesting. Any other ideas are very welcome.

Normally, proselytizing never works unless you convince someone that they're going to burn for eternity or get 80 virgins.

The reason for my enhanced skepticism is that I've encountered some research that says breath awareness just doesn't do it for people, statistically speaking. That's not to say it never works, but in aggregate, it may be good for relaxation or concentrating, but not for changing your conscious experience."

Trying to a clear, quiet Buddha. Identification with this pattern will clearly bring one back to the first place. I believe the true meditative state, is when you let the thoughts happen. You do not try to classify whether they are the thoughts of the 'thinker' or the 'observer.'   Untamed stream: This is a beautiful glass. The weather is pleasant today, I'm glad I decided to sit in the outdoor area. Why is that man chewing so loudly?  Observer: Don't judge. Don't classify. It only bothers you if you let it, let it be.  So, it is the same thing but just a different pattern. Let all the thoughts come and go, pass by like clouds.   It should not take great efforts. One often tries to tame thoughts-- but it is not possible to bite your own teeth.   Otherwise, one ends up thinking in circles, trying to force their thoughts to match the format of the 'observer' pattern.  This is my view, and I have been thinking a good deal about this lately. I would like to hear other perspectives."

I have tried to do this and one thing I have realised is to be kind to yourself when you fail. When you practice meditation, you may get lost in thought for seconds or minutes at a time. When going about your life, it may be hours. That's okay. Don't condemn yourself you have failed. Return to the now.  Moreover, I think you should be wary of 'identifying' with the obeerver. It sounds as if it is just the mind playing an elaborate trick, and rather than actually observing, you are just labelling your mind in another fashion.  Be the observer in your day to day life, but be kind to yourself when you are not."
Meditation,3doz0y,Geovicsha,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:03:49 2015 UTC,"What are your opinions on the idea of being able to identify with the observer instead of the thinker most of the time?   It might be a bit of a pedantic remark, but I don't think it's necessary to identify with an observer either. I think it might be a better long term goal to stop this ""identifying"".   Is it possible for the average(twice per day) meditator to get to a point where they are more often likely to be in a ""meditative state?""   Yes. In order to get into a meditative state, and maintain it, most of the time you have to put in some effort. Sometimes more, sometimes less. So if you put in effort in order to reach a meditative state, is that already meditation?   Or would that require hours every day of meditation?   Yes, it will require about as much meditation (in the loose definition from above) as you want to spend in a meditative state. Which doesn't mean that you will always have to sit on the cushion while you are doing that.  If you want to know how long you will have to sit on a cushion every day... Well, that's really hard to say. It depends on what exactly the ""meditative state"" is you are aiming for.  There are some meditative states, like deep absorption into the Jhanas, which require several hours of meditation a day to get there and stay there.  Then there are simple things, like joy or loving-kindness, which one can make arise rather quickly and with quite little effort (given enough practice and a balanced mind).  So to actually get toward a real answer: 20 minutes twice per day is probably enough for maintaining a basis for making some meditative states arise with so little effort that it can be done in everyday life.  But it's a skill. You need to know the meditative state you want to get in really well. You need to know the conditions you need to get there, you need to know what you need to do to get there, and you need to be able to do it while engaged in everyday life.  In order to learn that, some time with a few hours of meditation a day is probably helpful."

I often tried to ""focus"" on the physical aspect, as in my ""heart beats"" but this seemed to increase the anxiety. This might be because i was in fact focusing on the thoughts of 'worry' instead of the actual physical feeling, thus feeding into my anxiety.   This time however, i seemed to focus on the ""pressure around my chest region"" and with it, I seemed to releasing a lot of energy build up in this area..   I'm not really spiritual as such, but this was an incredible feeling, being able to feel a rush of energy dismantling from the anxiety around my chest, dissolving into the rest of my body.

Meditation,3dm0z3,cellux,14,Fri Jul 17 17:49:57 2015 UTC,"""In Buddhism, we express our willingness to be realistic through the practice of meditation. Meditation is not a matter of trying to achieve ecstasy, spiritual bliss, or tranquility, nor is it attempting to become a better person. It is simply the creation of a space in which we are able to expose and undo our neurotic games, our self-deceptions, our hidden fears and hopes. We provide space by the simple discipline of doing nothing. Actually, doing nothing is very difficult. At first, we must begin by approximating doing nothing, and gradually our practice will develop. So meditation is a way of churning out the neuroses of mind and using them as a part of our practice. Like manure, we do not throw our neuroses away, but we spread them on our garden; they become part of our richness.""  (Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche)"

They were messing around with a heart rate monitor and realized they could will their heartbeat to slow down while watching it on the monitor. I always thought this was cool and have attempted to will my heart rate to slow down since learning this. I have no idea how it works, but it always relaxes me and makes me feel more in control. I hope that helps you somehow.   And if not, the one other piece of advice I can offer is to not put pressure on yourself to have this experience again. If you are laying there, trying to recreate a past meditation, you will be focused on a past event instead of putting your focus on the present moment.

Meditation,3dlvcn,0Beechlgz,41,Fri Jul 17 09:18:42 2015 UTC,"You ask a very good, but very expansive question. I hope I can answer it with clarity, without writing half a book.   What we are aiming for is to develop equanimity, which basically means that we attempt to react to all things 'similarly', without judgment. In practice that means that we attempt to experience what we experience, be it sadness or joy, anger or kindness, we try to accept it for what it is and see it's true nature and motivation. The fruit of such an approach is that one becomes more present in the here and now, doesn't flee into worries or nostalgia, and because of this you see more of the present moment, enjoying it more.   As you might have noticed in your life, you can't really will yourself to be in a certain mind set. For example, even if you know your worries are futile and irrational, you still have them and can't really stop them (look up the 'white bear effect'). Even more mundane, you can't will yourself to sleep, it's futile and counterproductive. However, what you can do is to create suitable circumstances for you to go to sleep, i.e. go lie in bed, eliminate distractions, etc. Formal meditation practice is similar to this, we create a suitable environment for our minds to observe everything in a place of safety, i.e. we are sitting in a comfortable place so that we can look at our fears without being afraid of it coming true. This results in our minds becoming more at ease with bad feelings (the usual training response is at work here) and this carries over into life. .. as a final metaphor, think of it as putting your brain into the shallow end to practice it's 'swimming' without the fear of drowning.  I hope I was clear enough, if not, feel free to ask.  EDIT: I forgot to add that, as some of the other replies have mentioned, there are many reasons to meditate. Many of them specifically target feeling calm and happy without going beyond that. The goal (and approach) I mentioned is embedded in the larger context of Buddhism and its goals and ideals, and appears to be the goal of many of the more 'hardcore' meditators."
Meditation,3dlvcn,Tinuz1,11,Fri Jul 17 09:47:12 2015 UTC,"Boredom.  In my own experience, presence and concentration are the opposites of boredom. I don't know why that is, but it is. I developed concentration and presence, I went from being bored almost all the time (craving constant stimuli/input/entertainment), to being okay with what's happening most of the time.  I have regressed slightly. That's why I'm on reddit. :P  Edit: Tinuz1's answer is good, too. But mainly, I'm telling you what brought me to meditation. Oh, and also pursuit of awakening. But you may not think that exists. That's fine--another conversation for another day."
Meditation,3dlvcn,sleepycorn,6,Fri Jul 17 10:50:59 2015 UTC,"I think what we are describing is almost the same thing, actually.   The constant craving motivates us to do many things but never be satisfied. We are searching for that one something that will make us happy, for now and for ever, but of course we never find this. Being present in the here and now makes us see this for what it is, an illusion, allowing one not to chase it anymore. Although this sounds like a rather deliberate action, it seems to come rather naturally to most.   I think almost all meditation practices have a similar goal, the difference in goals is just a matter of how far one is willing to go. When you start, you will feel calmer and happier, more present in the here and now. If you go further there will be a whole lot of pain, but the reward for this pain is that the feelings of calm and happiness become easier to maintain and more prevalent.   In the end, what drives us to the pillow is different for all but the end result is almost always the same: being more present in the here and now, and being more capable of accepting things as they are. This in turn results in us being more able to perceive our motivations and thus being more able to change our actions."
Meditation,3dlvcn,Tinuz1,11,Fri Jul 17 11:08:32 2015 UTC,"The average person has over 50,000 thoughts a day, and most of us aren't even aware of it. Those thoughts (and emotions, and urges, etc.) influence our behavior and dictate our actions and reactions.   As a result, we tend to go through our days on autopilot - if ""X"" happens, we do ""Y.""   Problems such as stress, self-doubt, anxiety, a lack of focus (and so on) are a direct result of being lost in thought, and buried in all the mental noise.  Meditating is a dedicated exercise that helps you increase awareness of what is happening in your mind. You develop the skill of observing it without getting caught up in it.   Once you develop that skill, you can apply it to your daily life. This is mindfulness - it's nothing mysterious. It allows you to focus on what you are doing now, in the present moment. When you are mindful of what your are doing, you can better allocate your time and energy, and improve your decisions, actions, and reactions.  So, if you're interested in improving your quality of life, give it a shot. If not, don't. Best of luck either way."

This conditioning or mental programming limits our ability to be happy and reach our full potential because it restricts our thought and behavior. You ever heard of neuroplasticity?  Basically our brains form channels like a river or a wagon wheel in a rut. The  more we use a neural pathway, the  more it reinforces itself and you more easily slip into that pathway in the future. One way to look at it is like addiction. We are addicted to certain thought patterns and for many people this causes suffering.   Meditation is mind-rehab. De-conditioning the pre-existing pathways and learning to acess and strengthen new pathways. By illuminating the mind with awareness, we can take a conscious role in training the brain away from judgement, resistance, and attachment, towards love, wisdom, and insight."

Meditation,3dlvcn,nani_kore,3,Fri Jul 17 18:14:46 2015 UTC,"Right - meditation is a tool used to gain insight.  Our minds are heaving with chatter all of the time. A lot of this chatter is about how we see ourselves or how we see other people.  We take this chatter quite seriously (and we often think that it reflects the reality).  In truth, it's just noise. It's not real.  Meditation helps us get a better grip on this by encouraging us to see the nature of this chatter and how it flows constantly.  Constant practice of this skill strengthens the parts of the brain that don't respond emotionally to our thoughts and instead respond rationally.  A more rational approach to a lot of the stimuli that we are presented with on a daily basis is an approach that leads to a happier and more successful life.  Thank you, meditation!"
Meditation,3dlvcn,HarshaKarpos,3,Fri Jul 17 12:08:42 2015 UTC,"Enlightenment results in a peaceful existence. It is like clearing the mind permanently of self-referential thoughts.  Clearing one's mind means freeing the mind of about 99% of thoughts; sometimes stopping thoughts completely for a certain length of time. It is not necessarily permanent like enlightenment in that it can only be experienced during deep states of concentration.  Mindfulness is awareness not hindered by desire, ill-will, doubt, worry and sloth-torpor. Basically, heightened awareness based on clearing the mind of self-referential thoughts. This can happen permanently from enlightenment or temporarily from concentration."
Meditation,3dlvcn,Gojeezy,3,Fri Jul 17 14:01:10 2015 UTC,"Meditation, of which there are two types, Samatha (tranquility) and Vipassana (insight), are the training techniques that develop Mindfulness. These techniques have neuroanatomical effects: a decrease of gray matter in the Amygdala, and an increase of gray matter in the Hippocampus and Prefrontal cortex.  Mindfulness, describes an automatic and spontaneous awareness of state changes in the body and mind. For example, as Mindfulness develops, you'll find yourself less and less being ""lost in thought"" (i.e., not knowing that you're thinking as you're thinking). Mindfulness, fully developed, will result in the Stable Observer.  The Stable Observer describes a state of being wherein you are aware of, e.g., but not limited to: each and every thought and feeling. The Stable Observer is that which is necessary in order for you to ""see things as they really are,"" i.e., see the Three Characteristics: impermanance (annica), suffering (dukkha), and not-self (anattaa). Seeing things as they really are will result in Enlightenment.  Enlightenment, of which there are four stages, will, at the 4th stage, completely eliminate all forms of mental suffering. The earlier stages will drastically reduce mental suffering. A person who is enlightened will be perfectly equanimous; they will not be affected by anxiety, fear, depression, etc."

It's like giving your mind a work out - it improves your concentration, ability to reason, memory etc.  It can actually change your brain structure over time. It allows you to identify and let go of thoughts that are rolling around your subconscious making you anxious.  This makes you less anxious generally."
Meditation,3dlvcn,rainbowWar,7,Fri Jul 17 17:01:15 2015 UTC,"Can anyone explain in clear terms, without resorting to buzzwords such as ""mindfulness"" and ""enlightenment"", or oft-repeated but unexplained phrases such as ""being present"" or ""clearing one's mind"", what meditation achieves and why it's worth investing time into learning to do it?   No.  I have to admit, I am a bit confused: You don't understand what mindfulness means? The sentence: ""Be mindful of your surroundings"", makes no sense to you?  ""When I listen to music I am totally present"", sounds like gibberish and you don't know what it means?  ""Talking to some friends about my problem cleared my mind"", is a sentence that needs additional explanation?  I think those are all pretty common everyday terms. We can understand and use them in everyday language. And their meaning in context of meditation most of the time is not particularly special. If you know what they mean in a general context, usually you know what they mean in a meditative context.  And if you don't know what they mean in an everyday context... Well, then I am really sorry, I can't explain to you what meditation is about because you don't merely lack the vocabulary, but the concepts to understand it.  And enlightenment? A beautiful and permanent state of joy and freedom. That's the shortest and most general definition I can come up with. Now you know what that means too."
Meditation,3dlvcn,Wollff,2,Fri Jul 17 12:43:40 2015 UTC,To act like ppl don't get hung up over the definition of mindfulness is strange considering I see posts all the time on r/Buddhism and this sub as well arguing over the definition. Also your definition of enlightenment is extremely controversial considering serious practitioners have many varied and oftentimes mutually exclusive definitions for it.   OP asks a good question and the answer is explainable in simple noncontroversial terms. Instead of basically calling OP stupid you could just answer the question in a way they would understand.
Meditation,3dlvcn,lost_lurker,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:02:15 2015 UTC,"To act like ppl don't get hung up over the definition of mindfulness is strange   I don't act like that. I just think that it's not a problem when people get hung up over definitions. It doesn't mean that the words which are argued over are suddenly meaningless buzzwords.  There is that term ""evolution"", for example. Usually it's defined as genetic change (and subsequently the formation of new species) over several generations by natural selection, or something along those lines.  And people argue over its definition: Does natural selection mean selection on an individual level? Or does it work on a group level? Or evolution even work on a bigger scale, as some people (gaia hypothesis) suggest? Is it all about genetic change, or does metagenetic stuff also play a role? Should we use the term ""species"" in the definition of evolution?  People argue over this definition. And yet, when someone tells you that fundamentalist Christians don't believe in evolution, you know exactly what I mean.   OP asks a good question and the answer is explainable in simple noncontroversial terms.   I really don't think so.  I feel that what OP is asking for is like someone wanting evolution explained to him without such buzzwords and poorly defined terms like ""natural selection"" and ""gene"". Someone who is slightly annoyed that explanations rely on oft repeated but unexplained terms like ""generations"" and ""sexual reproduction"".  I would be as baffled by this question as I was by OP's question, and would have to ask if he really has never come across the concept of ""sexual reproduction"" (or, as in the OP, the concept of ""a clear mind"").  That's not because I consider OP stupid. It's because I think that OP knows perfectly well what the terms he asks for mean (as in: he can use them in a meaningful sentence), but I think he just makes things more complicated than he needs to. There are discussions about the exact definition of mindfulness or enlightenment. But for OP's question an approximate, everyday meaning we ascribe to those words seems perfectly fine and sufficient.  That's why I didn't worry about my ""controversial"" definition of enlightenment. Doesn't matter at all, because it approximately captures the concept. And that's enough."

While we may use the word ""mindfulness"" in everyday conversation it may mean something slightly different to a Buddhist or regular mediator than it does to the general public. In fact different practitioners have different definitions of it. So when OP says ""please avoid buzzwords"" they are asking for a simple straightforward explanation without confusing or vague terminology. Sometimes things do get confusing for ppl who are not privy to the various shades of meaning these words and concepts can have and they just want someone to cut the bull and shoot straight with them.  And your definition of enlightenment does not come close to approximating the various definitions as given by different schools of thought. Not to say you're wrong but that it doesn't represent the diversity of opinions for that word."

When you know how accurate definitions are, then you have an idea about how accurate your conclusions are going to be. Not. A. Problem.  What worries me is that you insist that this definition of enlightenment doesn't do the complicated phenomenon and its cultural implications justice. I mean, you are totally right. But you seem to be perfectly fine with the idea to leave that ""buzzword"" out in a discussion about the aim of meditation.  You can't have an honest discussion about the aims of meditation without the buzzword enlightenment. Can't be done. If you want to understand that topic, you need the term.  Not only that, it is as you suggest: You need to look into the meaning of the word, the controversies, and different definitions. Then you will get a good conclusion.  Or you can do what I tried to do: Give a short, simple definition that doesn't quite do it justice, and be honest about its lack of quality. Then you will get to conclusions that might be a bit inaccurate, but at least you know what you get.  Or we can do the worst thing, and do what OP wants: Leave out the annoying terms, while pretending to shoot straight and cut the bull.

Meditation,3dlvcn,lost_lurker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:25:32 2015 UTC,"There are different reasons for meditating.   I meditate because the technique I use fills me with happiness and love. It's an easy technique that doesn't require the intense levels of concentration that some meditations do.  Being present means being aware of what you are doing when you are doing it rather than thinking about the past or the future or anything else. Mindfulness is the same thing. It is a way to meditate during daily activities.  Enlightenment is like this: http://ncu9nc.blogspot.com/2015/03/realizing-ultimate.html  Meditation produces enlightenment either by stilling the mind so you experience reality without the illusions produced by the mind, or by observing mental activity so carefully that you see through the same illusions. http://ncu9nc.blogspot.com/2015/06/beyond-joy.html"
Meditation,3dlvcn,ringer54673,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:39:48 2015 UTC,"At a basic level it helps with calming the mind and learning to work with thoughts in a way that reduces stress, anxiety, erratic behavior and overall mental suffering. There are numerous modern studies that indicate these benefits as well as 2500 years of anecdotal experience from religious traditions that use a vast array of meditative styles.  Moving beyond that, meditative traditions claim that from the vantage of a calm mind one can better understand the nature of reality, of the self (or lack of self), of our behavior and aspects of cause and effect.  Most people here speak about Buddhist meditation and secular mindfulness practice, but Christian prayer, Stoic contemplation and Sufi dancing meditation are a few more among a myriad of other meditative traditions.  Mindfulness is a practice of mental and sensory awareness that requires concentration but focuses on non-judgemental awareness of the immediate present happenings.  Enlightenment is an overloaded word used by many traditions to express a sort of ideal state or end goal. Explaining that is best done in the context of whatever particular tradition you are interested in. In my opinion it isn't important for a beginner.  ""Clearing one's mind"" and ""Emptying one's mind"" are unhelpful phrases that are often misunderstood. What most people mean is maybe better expressed by saying, calming the mind, slowing down the mind, reducing discursive erratic thought patterns and achieving some level of ""peace"" inside the mind. The mind will never be empty or clear of some form of experience unless you are unconscious or dead."

Attempting to do so is just running circles around it. For instance, how would one explain the subjective experience of consciousness? It's not something one can really understand intellectually, but rather a state of being one has to experience.  Meditation teachers provide signposts that direct you to the state of being present. Meditation itself is one such signpost- simply a vehicle to get you to the state of presence.  The benefits of meditation are concrete, however. You are less reactive to the world. You can control your actions to a greater extent (more self efficacy). It makes you happier, reduces anxiety, improves sleep, increases BDNF (your brain's growth hormone)."
Meditation,3dlvcn,rationalawareness,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:52:18 2015 UTC,It really depends on the type of meditation.  Bhavana means to cultivate so Metta Bhavana is the practice of cultivating kindness.  Vipassana Bhavana is the practice of cultivating insight to the real nature of things as the Buddha taught.    Anapanasati Bhavana is for training the mind to concentrate specifically using the breath.  Some will say that samadhi is a meditation for developing states of absorption (jhana).  To some extent it is but it's really more about letting go so these states can arise.  There are more types of meditation than Carter has little pills.

Give it a try, dedicate 10-15 min a day to the practice,  you will learn a great deal about yourself in the process, about how you react to the environment around you. It will bring a smile to your face, it will bring peace and calm to your thoughts and your day.  Essentially it's an exercise to calm your mind. If you know about yourself that your mind is racing, maybe not letting you go to sleep easily at night, or constantly thinking about possible scenarios in the future or how you might of handled things better in the past, then  ""clearing one's mind"" can be something that can be helpful for you. Also this means that you are not ""being present"", or enjoying life to the fullest in the present time, whatever the present moment may bring to you.   Take meditation as a mind exercise, where you learn how to focus intensely on one thing (breath, candle, etc). This developed concentration will then flow into your daily life and you will observe new details about the present moment, which in turn will make living more enjoyable, free flowing and care free. Is it worth it being dedicated to the practice? You bet it is, it may be the greatest thing I have ever done."

Have you ever wondered that maybe some truths can only be experienced subjectively and there is a reason why it is so? Maybe God wants to go play hide and go seek. Either way, it doesn't matter because I have nothing to prove to anyone nor would I want to be a spectacle for people. I'm content with knowing truth and living it, and it greatly saddens me to see such a prevelant, close-minded science worshiping view. Don't get me wrong, science is a great tool to observe what is in front of us, but who is the observer? I think the answer to this question can only truthfully be answered through one's own subject experience. The problem is that it is also very easy to get lost in subjective ""truths"" which end up being false and leading one astray. It isn't a coincidence that many advanced meditators report of experiences of this type of woo woo nature.

Meditation,3dn1fs,ganonduff,5,Fri Jul 17 16:29:40 2015 UTC,"This is a very important question. The answer to this question applies not only to meditation, but also to any other aspect of your life that you want to change.  This is my take on it. I'm still learning, but hopefully you get some value from this.  Reading about habits was a turning point in my life. There is a lot of research out on how we make and break habits, and a lot of that information is not intuitive. Viewing myself more objectively as a machine that can be ""hacked"" into learning new habits, was the key mindset change for me, and inspired me to read into the science behind it. And gave me the understanding that you can change pretty much any part of your life by applying that habit-changing algorithm.  The short answer is to manage your limited willpower each day and use it to get a foothold in establishing a habit. Eventually it becomes more or less automatic (how long that takes varies with the habit and person).   So how to do it?  -Manage your willpower. Recognize that we all have a very limited ability to break out of our routines. Our limited willpower can break us out of our habits and help us create new ones, but it is a scarce resource. Being hungry depletes it. Being underslept depletes it. Eating well and exercising gives you more of it. Meditation actually gives you more of it, by working out the part of the brain responsible for impulse control. So cultivate your willpower and use your very limited daily allotment to build the habit each day.  -Know that your willpower will grow like a muscle, to some extent.  -You have more willpower in the morning, so you might want to focus on just entrenching the morning meditation habit first.  -Furthermore, know that once you get started, it's an upward spiral. Meditation will strengthen your willpower, you'll start doing it more regularly and entrenching that habit, it will become easier, etc... But you have to dig yourself out of the hole, first.  -Tie your new habit to your existing routine. Our habits are very strongly tied to context. Where we are, what we just did, etc... So it's useful to tie in meditation with part of your existing routine. For example, you can make brushing your teeth a cue to meditate, by meditating immediately after you brush your teeth. And if you're moving in the near future, that's a great opportunity to create a whole new set of good habits in your new environment.  -Read about habit formation. There's a lot more to it. I'd recommend checking out ""Making Habits, Breaking Habits"" by Jeremy Dean. Also ""The Power of Habit"" is pretty good. Finally, ""Mini Habits"" has a simple but valuable message (set really small goals, and you'll always achieve at least what you set out to do, and probably more). Simply knowing that we aren't designed to start new habits easily, especially such lofty, long-term pursuits as meditation, really helped me not judge my failed attempts at starting a consistent practice in the past.  I'm going to make a series of videos on this topic soon. My channel is here if you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-GLeSSXgFk06Qx2xjVnrZw"

From what I hear and have learned (don't take my word for it — research it yourself):  For a tea-like drink that doesn't have the unbalancing effect of caffeine (jitters, sweat, anxiety, highs and lows) you can try Rooibos, which is available in many stores now.  For calmness of body and mind, and mild tonification of energy, find Long-An (Dragon Eyes) berries at a Chinese herb store. 2 or 3 in a mug, or a small handful boiled in a pot, make a mild and sweet drink.  For more centering effect you can mix ground Lotus Seed (also available at Chinese herb stores) with a grain drink. They may try to substitute Fox Nut, which has a darker brown skin; it's okay, but Lotus is better for centering. It calms the heart and invites your energy to settle there. Occasionally drinking this can encourage meditation.  For both support in meditation and support of deep resources (e.g., in cases of adrenal exhaustion), the Ayurvedic remedy of Ashwagandha Powder is recommended. You can mix it into hot drinks like coffee substitutes or smoothies.  Regular herbal teas found in most stores do well too: Chamomile calms the digestive system and can relax you (good for cramps & tension). Mint tends to relax you by helping pent-up energies flow; it is also good for calming the digestive system, and has a fresh feel. For those who already have thin, flighty energy Mint can sometimes increase it because of its spreading quality, so then something more substantial (like Long-An) is better.  Check these out for yourself."

My own version is that substances should only be used as celebratory and not as daily use. And meditation should in my opinion be integrated in your daily life. Meditation is good when it forces you to find your true self and discover how much love this world holds. When you are affected by for example THC, you are not your self and such i find very little benefit of using THC. This is merely my opinion."

Should I incorporate Metta in my beginning meditation practice?   Yes   Should I practice different types of meditation?    Love is all you need. Love is all you need. Love is all you need.   How the heck do I get myself to do this every day?   It's easy. It is relaxing and pleasant so you will like to do it.  You can sit comfortably in a chair, you don't have to sit still through itches, aches, or bugs crawling on you. Or you can learn do it while out for a walk. Experiencing the world through intense feelings of love is even better than cultivating those feelings while sitting inside.   when I first heard about it, and I felt that it could help me become the loving, kind person that I really want to be.   Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time"
Meditation,3dohjd,ringer54673,2,Fri Jul 17 23:36:36 2015 UTC,"Which practices are good to accompany Metta   A more single-pointed concentration practice. Metta is a concentration practice in and of itself but it is generally more diffuse attention.   how are they incorporated into each other   The better you can concentrate the quicker your metta will develop.   Should Metta be part of a daily practice, or just something added sometimes?   It is up to your preference. If you want to focus on loving-kindness that is not a bad thing.   Should I incorporate Metta in my beginning meditation practice?   Sure   Should I practice different types of meditation?   You can. Sometimes it is easier to stick with just one. Don't be offended: KISS, Keep It Simple Stupid.   If so, how do I do that?   I practice developing both concentration and insight and I will sometimes switch during the same meditation session.  You can also switch between morning and night meditation or daily or weekly. What is important is that it feels right for you and that it is working; this can take a while of trial and error.   Should I do a guided meditation or just do it by myself?   Do you need a guide? If you do a guided meditation will you last longer than if you practice on your own? Again, it is what feels right for you. Generally, guided meditations are for novices that are unsure of what to do.   How the heck do I get myself to do this every day?   I can't really help you with this. For me, it came down to either being totally suicidal and apathetic or trying to do something about it. It is not that hard of a choice when death is the alternative option."

Additional note: Remember the Two Minds (this is a Buddhist concept). The thinking mind makes you anxious, and the observing mind is watching the anxiousness. Identify with the observing mind. It's not ""I am anixous"", but rather ""I feel anxiousness"". In other words, you're being mindful of the emotion but you're not controlled by it. Don't identify with the anxiousness, and act despite it.  http://markmanson.net/your-two-minds"

Meditation,3dj4zj,jms1225,26,Thu Jul 16 18:12:17 2015 UTC,"This topic is a bit timely for me. I just finished Chogyam Trungpa's book ""Cutting through Spiritual Materialism"" and just started ""Work, Sex, Money"". We cannot simply sit for 10 minutes following our breath and expect everything to be ""better"". A deeper practice may improve my efficiency, my productivity, and the company's bottom line, but all of that is ancillary to my practice. I get benefit whether to company does well or not.  However, as someone whose introduction to meditation was through an MBSR course, I know it's possible to receive a relatively loose introduction to  meditation and then have that practice deepen. For that reason, I'm generally optimistic about the introduction of meditation/mindfulness in corporate environments. The effectiveness for any company will be limited, superficial, and short-lived without broader changes to corporate motivations. Specifically, the motives to increase market share, profit, and shareholder value.  For individuals, though, such programs may be just the introduction they need. Which is not to say that everyone needs to go super deep into Buddhism to have a good meditation practice."

A good thing taken out of context and used with different intentions can turn it bad. A kitchen knife used by your mom, taken out of the kitchen and used by a murderer, is now a weapon. A medicine pill, when in the hands of a drug dealer and the intention of intoxicating others, can turn the pill from a reparative tool to a potentially dangerous drug.   It happens all the time, and mindfulness is not exempt from that general principle, I think. Context and intention, context and intention!"

Yeah, I often hear about mindfulness in the context of 'making your underlings more efficient' and 'lowering healthcare costs,' not really at all about lessening suffering, just lessening the cost that can arise from being bummed on the job.   If severe mental illness made employees super productive and didn't have any healthcare costs, corporate mindfulness would have no 'place.' Its current pitch is that mental health and concentration are profitable and cheap. But that doesn't seem like a good individual-longterm motivation to practice."
Meditation,3dj4zj,Sampajanna,10,Thu Jul 16 19:02:50 2015 UTC,"Even the historical Buddha was rebelling against an older tradition that had lost a certain amount of focus on practice and was maintaining the ""status quo"". The Bhagavad Gita has many passages about the caste system and the dangers of trying to break outside of your caste, etc... These things come in cycles. I think if it gets people meditating (just like putting a gym in the office will get people working out) the net effect will be positive.    As daverupa points out, people may do it incorrectly and without proper guidance, but for the most part it's better than not trying at all. Hopefully people will look outside the corporate structure once their initial curiosity is sparked."
Meditation,3dj4zj,mbalavi,5,Thu Jul 16 22:35:31 2015 UTC,"While you are correct that the Buddha was rebelling against an older system that had become ritual-bound and superstitious, the Bhagavad Gita describes a caste system that was originally designed not to be hereditary,  but to be in accordance with people's natural tendencies.    So originally the son of a laborer could be very spiritual and be a Brahmin, and vice versa.    Then later on the caste system was co-opted and made to be hereditary, and thus the source of many evils and also the source of India losing her freedom to the British according to some Hindu philosophers.    So just as Buddhist anti-capitalist practices are being co-opted by capitalism to create better servants for the shareholding classes, this kind of thing has a rich tradition. The Bhagavad Gita has verses that are fairly terse and dense / short, and it is the commentaries that try to ""unpack"" those verses but often also add extra baggage depending on who is ""interpreting"" it."

Five thousand years ago, the ancestors of modern Indians were comprised primarily of two groups: ancestral North Indians, who related to people of Central Asia, the Middle East, the Caucasus, and Europe, and ancestral South Indians, who are not closely related to groups outside the subcontinent. The mixture between these two groups and their many subcategories happened mostly between 4,200 and 1,900 years ago, according to the study.   Around 1,900 years ago, the mixture largely stopped, as Indian society moved toward endogamy—the practice of avoiding intermarriage or close relationships between ethnic groups—which reached its most extreme form in the creation of the caste system. As one of the study’s authors told the Times of India, ""the present-day structure of the caste system came into being only relatively recently in Indian history."""

The problem is you have to get past that mindset and detach from it. You have to let go and enjoy.  For a lot of people mindfulness will just be a short online course, a seminar or something they tried once to improve productivity or as a key to unlock happiness. That isn't dangerous, it just doesn't really work.  For others that initial seminar will be a gateway to a journey that takes them deeper."

Meditation,3dj4zj,Joshbot,5,Fri Jul 17 00:16:02 2015 UTC,"So, anti smoking campaigns among corporations are insidious because they hide the reason people are smoking themselves to death? I find that melodramatic.  To edit that to be less callous: Mindfulness meditation is based on the vipassana movement which is a function of theravada Buddhism. There is a Thai Buddhist center for theravada Buddhism near me and they have a public meditation instruction they do every week where they teach (wait for it) mindfulness meditation. One of the core principles of their discipline is that attainment of nirvana can only be achieved by freeing yourself of delusion (I'm paraphrasing as a dirty nonbeliever). The act itself is what they try to spread. Not the dogma. So if you're wondering what Buddhists think about more and more people mediating - for many of them it's the mission statement of the religion."
Meditation,3dj4zj,pfunkmort,9,Fri Jul 17 00:55:11 2015 UTC,"I think those anti-smoking campaigns should be critically examined, sure. If the company could double their profits if their workers smoked, would they still encourage them to quit? Reminding workers that their owner is not their friend is productive in the big-picture.  Interesting point with the Buddhists. And maybe, overall, it is a net-positive. I don't know.

Meditation,3dj4zj,OrbitRock,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:18:51 2015 UTC,"Thats a straw man argument, equating business owners and slave owners. They are not equivalent, and claiming they are undermines your original point. Not all presidents owned slaves, and not all business owners view their role as an executive leader as equivalent to owning slaves.  Your assumption that ALL businesses work the way you described is a false one; there is a such thing as ethical capitalism, failing to recognise it working right now in the real world puts you in the same place as the greedy oligarchs that claim that it can never work so they should keep doing what they do. Co-ops make profits, encourage mindfulness meditation, and avoid hierarchial structures.   It seems that if a business makes decisions that make their workers more miserable, its terrible but expected. If they make decisions that make their workers less miserable, its unexpected, and thus MUST be for nefarious reasons, so it is terrible as well.  Do you hold that any step in the right direction that does not completely tear down the concept of private enterprise as a whole, everywhere at once, is too flawed to praise for its efforts?  There must be a middle path, which allows businesses that beleive as you do to improve their own workers' lives, even when the larger business world continues to maintain the status quo. No one company can change the entire economic machine, so they must be allowed to balance profits (not going out of business and having to lay off all of their workers) against their efforts to help workers lead better lives.  If you assume 100% of businesses are just as greedy and driven to force ever higher quarterly profits at the expense of their workforce, you fail to give credit to those businesses that are trying to make the changes that you want to see."

That isn't to say that corporations shouldn't have gyms or daycares or mindfulness classes. However it's important to keep in mind that these companies are not going to raise their workers pay if they become more productive due to meditating. Virtually all the benefits are reaped by the executives and shareholders. Providing services to workers is also an efficient way to avoid paying them more. People see all the benefits they get and are more willing to accept a salary that is less than what they're worth. This isn't inherently bad, but it does present a moral danger since relatively small amounts of capital can have very large impacts over long periods of time due to compound interest."

Sure, it doesn't deny that meditation is bad, it even says it's good... but I'm still sensing an anti-capitalist ideology that seems a tad bit blinding. Materialism and capitalism aren't two sinister overlords, and meditation is just a practice that is in no way obligated to abide by Chinese guys with shaved heads. The people in business are there because they want to work hard and climb the ladder, who are we to disparage them for that? Sure, it may be for the wrong reasons, but we can't paint them all with the same brush. If they want to work, let them work. If they want a big house and hot SO, them them try. Why should we step outside of that sphere and pretend we're somehow above them just because we're seeking a higher state of mind and not material things?

I know there is a temptation to add politics, saying that just mindfulness is removing lots from the original teaching, or is just done to fit in to capitalism, but in my mind that is wrong. To say these things is too add more, it is adding onto for the sake of ego.  Mindfulness is meditaion. If you want to try and add all the extra stuff and compain about mindfulness then you are just satisfying your ego not following the original teaching.  It's sad because mindfulness is still going to exist thousands of years from now when the petty political issues they care so much about are long buried in the annals of history. I am sure in the time of the last man, capitalism, communism ect will all be things they look back on as we look back on the ancient egyptians.  All this shall pass. Mindfulness shall not. The last man will still be breathing. He will still exist. He can focus on the sensations of his body. And in that he will have the ability to accsess the beauty of mindfulness.  Frankly the author of this needs to get over himself. He has identified eastern thought with modern left wing politics. Which is a very western thing to do. The teaching goes far beyond that.  History is vast and our time is short. We are but snowflakes melting on the edge of reality. When we die time will continue and everything we care so much about will be lost forever.

Take Tibetan Buddhism for example. In the West we associated it with the lovable and harmless Dalai Lama but historically the Tibetan Buddhist church and the Lamas were not such nice figures.   This 1st (or 3rd) Dalai Lama seized monasteries that did not belong to his sect, and is believed to have destroyed Buddhist writings that conflicted with his claim to divinity. The Dalai Lama who succeeded him pursued a sybaritic life, enjoying many mistresses, partying with friends, and acting in other ways deemed unfitting for an incarnate deity. For these transgressions he was murdered by his priests. Within 170 years, despite their recognized divine status, five Dalai Lamas were killed by their high priests or other courtiers. 6  For hundreds of years competing Tibetan Buddhist sects engaged in bitterly violent clashes and summary executions. In 1660, the 5th Dalai Lama was faced with a rebellion in Tsang province, the stronghold of the rival Kagyu sect with its high lama known as the Karmapa. The 5th Dalai Lama called for harsh retribution against the rebels, directing the Mongol army to obliterate the male and female lines, and the offspring too “like eggs smashed against rocks…. In short, annihilate any traces of them, even their names.” 7  In 1792, many Kagyu monasteries were confiscated and their monks were forcibly converted to the Gelug sect (the Dalai Lama’s denomination). The Gelug school, known also as the “Yellow Hats,” showed little tolerance or willingness to mix their teachings with other Buddhist sects. In the words of one of their traditional prayers: “Praise to you, violent god of the Yellow Hat teachings/who reduces to particles of dust/ great beings, high officials and ordinary people/ who pollute and corrupt the Gelug doctrine.” 8 An eighteenth-century memoir of a Tibetan general depicts sectarian strife among Buddhists that is as brutal and bloody as any religious conflict might be. 9 This grim history remains largely unvisited by present-day followers of Tibetan Buddhism in the West.

Yesterday we had this monster of an article come up, which argues that traditional meditative practice will literally ruin you unless you are ready to live the life of a renunciate who is willing to give up material life and subject himself to the feudal (or sometimes godlike) authority of spiritual leaders.   They do not know what the path of the householder is, and they mistakenly poison householders with their toxic attitudes toward sensuality, ambition, desire, and individuality. I think it will take a hundred more years to adapt Hindu and Buddhist meditation teachings to the West, and to evolve meditation practices that are nontoxic to women, married couples, industrious business people, and artists.   It's a big shout out that we need to adapt Eastern meditation teachings because as it is, it is toxic. We must make meditation nontoxic, which means to purge it from its roots which lie in material detachment, in order to make it compatible with the beautiful things that sensuality, ambition, desire, and individuality are.  One of those articles is wrong. Have we already decided which one?"

Meditation,3dj4zj,SamuelColeridgeValet,0,Fri Jul 17 04:53:33 2015 UTC,"In the case of mindfulness, business leaders cite a number of reasons why they’ve adopted the concept so wholeheartedly. Studies have found that mindfulness meditation reduces stress, thereby making it a safeguard against employee burnout. Research finds that mindfulness bolsters memory retention and reading comprehension, which means employees can be more accurate in processing information. One Dutch study found that mindfulness makes practitioners more creative, helping ensure workers remain a fount of ideas. And some schools for children as young as first grade have begun teaching mindfulness meditation, based on studies that suggest it helps maintain focus, a resource in constant threat of short supply for those multitasking their way through so many mundane, workaday obligations.   Conclusion:  You and the comrades had better start practicing if you want to lead the proletariat to the Workers Paradise!  Edit -  The author doesn't even know what mindfulness is.     The pesky problem with meditation, now dubbed “mindfulness,” was its connection with Buddhism.   The word ""mindfulness"" is the English translation for the self-awareness and awareness of the present moment that is at the heart of Buddhism. The Noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism, which includes Right Speech And Right Action, includes Right Mindfulness.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path  Among the books of Thich Nhat Hanh is The Miracle of Mindfulness. Like many Buddhists, he promotes mindfulness in daily life. Another monk has said, ""If I were to summarize Buddhism in two words, they would be 'Be mindful'.""  The article mentions Jon Kabat-Zinn.  Dr. Kabat-Zinn's program MBSR, developed in the 1980s and shown repeatedly to help people cope with serious problems such as chronic pain and cancer, teaches mindfulness meditation as a means of helping people to achieve mindfulness in daily life. This program is secular rather than religious in nature. Patients who go to clinics for MBSR are not taught about karma or the Buddhist gods. That is not to say that Dr. Kabat-Zinn's work is in conflict with Buddhism. I defy you to show anything this man has said that contradicts the ethical precepts of Buddhism.  In detention centers and school districts in high-crime neighborhoods, mindfulness has become the favorite tool for departing from the violent status quo of teenagers, and this has been shown in research by the Mind-Body Awareness Project and Mindful Schools. Also, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy challenges the status quo for prevention of relapse after recovery from depression, as research cited at MBCT.com shows."

Meditation,3dn2zp,zavaa,2,Fri Jul 17 16:41:51 2015 UTC,"I used to do quite a bit of cardio at the gym. I have my fat percentage where I like it so I stopped for now.  So, what I used to do on the bike was set up a breathing rhythm. I would focus on my breath. Not the people. Not the tv shows, not the the music. My breath. Sometimes I would start a mantra in my head. I enjoy a few very specific ones, but thats really up to you to discover.  So essentially my 30 min cardio was also a 30 min meditation. Sure people could tell I was... Somewhere else, but did that matter? No. It just breaks my concentration, and well you know, back to the breath.  Take care friend."

Meditation,3dn2zp,TastyPruno,2,Fri Jul 17 18:45:48 2015 UTC,"I run on a treadmill for 30 minutes, three times a week, and like /u/gedwards363, I'd also say it's pretty much meditation, although I would say that I am completely there, not somewhere else.  I attend to everything that I'm experiencing, which is usually my breath and the fatigue in my legs, the gym music, and the occasional thought moaning about wanting to stop. The more I get tired, the more fatigue and thoughts about wanting to stop monopolise my attention.   I know that if I don't I can get into a trance like state which is desirable but a lot of effort too.   I think your typical westerner's approach to cardio is to try and disappear into a daydream or distract themselves with music in order to lessen the suffering involved. As someone who has meditated for a fair bit, I actually don't try to avoid the feelings of fatigue.   I think the reason many people try to avoid the feelings of fatigue is because they assume that those feelings themselves are what make the exercise arduous. In my opinion, it isn't the feelings of fatigue themselves that are the problem, but the narration about the fatigue that makes such cardio arduous. I've personally found that when I attend to the feelings of fatigue, my suffering is actually less. Even when thoughts come saying things like ""Make it stop!"" as I grow tired, I find that providing I don't get caught up in the thought, that is fine too.  I recently watched  Rupert Spira video where he discussed the idea that meditation is ""saying yes to everything"". I like that, and that is my approach when I'm on a treadmill."

Meditation,3dlmrq,marcin_108,5,Fri Jul 17 08:53:47 2015 UTC,"I've actually found the opposite - it doesn't make meditation easier per se, but almost bypasses it a little and makes it very easy to 'remember' and just snap straight into that space.   That's said, I think sober meditation practice is vital. Your brain can spin off into all kinds of crazy directions if you're stoned, you've gotta be able to step outside of that."
Meditation,3dlmrq,voidgrinder,2,Fri Jul 17 12:52:38 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. In my experience the initial high (first 10-30 minutes) results in heightened awareness and altered consciousness that can result in profound insights. After that comes a few hours of reduced awareness.  A lot of people that use hallucinogens and psychedelics get into meditation from that so there must be something good going on.

It is perfectly fine to smoke marijuana and meditate. It may impede your ability to concentrate, that is a bit of a different issue. this type of thinking will lead to having the ability to remain mindful in more disruptive situations, like if somebody upsets you or if your under stress, instead of fighting the stress you will get used to accepting it as how the situation currently is."

Meditation,3diy3z,Sampajanna,2,Thu Jul 16 17:23:10 2015 UTC,"I am having a hard time understanding your wants. Do you want to sit with a bunch of people that are skeptical of what the benefits of meditation are? If so, that does not sound conductive to your practice at all.   What do you think is the reason for this near-complete lack of secular groups geared toward longterm meditators?   Probably because the longer you meditate the more insight you experience. For most people who have not experienced it, insight is mystical mumbo jumbo.  Also, because groups result in group-think, i.e., the basis of what most people consider ""religion"".   If by religion you are referring to attainments and experiences that can not be shown or given to you then maybe following daniel ingram is not a good fit for you either. Dude is into things (e.g., psychic powers) that a skeptic would be turned off by."
Meditation,3diy3z,Gojeezy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:49:14 2015 UTC,"skeptical of what the benefits of meditation are   It depends on what you mean by skeptical. I just mean people who go through life applying skeptical principles to some things that they do, not that they try to harshly undermine or disdain. The words 'faith' and 'skeptical' are often not given a fair shake — skeptics can paint faith like it's 100% gullibility, but also skepticism gets the unfair reputation of deflating, undermining, while many skeptics might say that their stance strengthens whatever survives their standards.   groups result in group-think, i.e., the basis of what most people consider ""religion""   It may be a part, but the reason people can easily distinguish politics from religion is because there is generally some sort of supernaturalistic or faith-based feature to religion while politics is generally understood to involve group-think that is more socioeconomic.  In other words, a skeptic could easily see a group just in the way many fitness-advocates view exercise groups: as a social species, a human group benefits if they build commitment and interest by using their social side to their advantage while focusing on a thing they care about.   Ingram   Yes I know his views, and I am not against his beliefs in and of themselves, I am not talking about beliefs per se - more about the willingness and desire to apply skeptic principles to experience, which he says he does and I think he does overall (maybe not the way I'd like, fully, but his type would surely welcome my basic stances too as long as they result from basic attempts to apply my standards of evidence)."
Meditation,3diy3z,Gojeezy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:56:11 2015 UTC,"I just mean people who go through life applying skeptical principles   That just sounds like buddhism in general. The buddha suggested a healthy amount of skepticism when he said, don't believe something simply because I say it. Believe what works for you."
Meditation,3diy3z,Gojeezy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:10:29 2015 UTC,"I am not going to try to argue over whether Buddhism is full-on skeptical. I have read many analyses of the Kalama Sutta (from which such assertions about skepticism tend to originate). While testing things out for oneself was one ingredient of that sutta, other writers have noted (Buddhist writers, not just me) that the sutta definitely went past mere 'skepticism' and was just trying in that part to emphasize the primacy of experience while on the Buddhist path. I suggest Bhikkhu Bodhi's analysis of the sutta if you're interested, as well as Allan Wallace's (in an open-letter response to Stephen Batchelor or some Secular Buddhist alliance, if I recall correctly).  Other religions (or at least sub-branches) seem to certainly support some form or other of 'skepticism', no doubt. For example, I know little of Tibetan Buddhism, but I hear that they train some lineages for a long time in the art of debate and discussion for hours and hours. I think that's great. But it's not too hard to notice that there's a little more to Tibetan Buddhism than the argumentation/criticism part. Many Christians are also advised to be able to answer in detail, and to the depth of every non-believer's mind, every doubt and to show that their faith is the most reasonable. Great. If we didn't have these basic standards of being able to explain our beliefs to others, interfaith discussion might be quite tough. But discussion and testing things out for oneself aren't what I'm talking about."

They're not exactly people who know about the jhanas, Mahasi, Raja yoga, pranayama, the suttas, et cetera, but who are also not Buddhist, Hindu, anything'ist at all.   I understand that what I'm asking about may seem very narrow and I never thought there'd be many like this, for sure.

Meditation,3diy3z,mbalavi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:40:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not so much interested in sharing the same beliefs.   In fact, 99% of my awkward experiences in religious groups are from times when I believed one thing and the other person, uninterested in discussion, said my belief was because I 'didn't understand yet' and that my curiosity was a sign of 'spreading doubt onto people who think otherwise.' Often I'm just asking because it's in my nature to explore and understand like that.   I'm all about having different beliefs, to feel otherwise would be some sort of odd thought-policing, but I do seek in others an openness to similar stances of questioning or standards of evidence. In other words, it's not what you think necessarily that makes me your buddy at all, but more possibly it could be about 'how' you think when we're trying to understand something. Not really 'thinking,' either, but I hope you get my drift: I don't have a cookie cutter for people with beliefs, just a desire to meet folks with similar ways of processing things (regardless of how the belief comes out on the other side of your processor).

I didn't mean thought control or wanting people to share beliefs, but that for such a group to exist would require enough people with a similar belief to yours, a dedication to skepticism, for that to occur.  I agree and have shared your experiences with groups. I however am not as tolerant as you and abandon people, or at least stop listening, when they start talking woo. I like to question too and  I find people find that deeply hurtful. I think it is something to do with ego.  I have kept away from 'groups' for many years and practice on my own because I have not found one when I searched that didn't feel somehow weird. Some cult like, some people looking for an experience, others people searching for faith or something. Many good people I am sure  too.

Can be hard to find a good community. Find some groups here: http://www.buddhanet.info/wbd.  Where is the line between path work which would end up being based on one or another historical text or tradition, and a more modern skeptical attitude? Scientific study of mediation is in its infancy, and without that objective backing it devolves into subjectivity, and various groups based on various teachers proclivities.

I currently have been meeting up with a Goenka group for ""old students"" (you have to have completed one of their 10 day courses to attend the meet ups). It's kind of a good thing that they make that requirement because everyone that shows up has at least a basic level of seriousness/dedication.

Someone decided to take general meditation practices and market them for very high prices. It's not really that much different from what Scientology does. They make money by saying it requires a guru to teach.  Here is the 30 second guide to TM without having to pay $2,500: http://caic.org.au/eastern/sydda/free-tm.htm    ""TM merely adds a scientific veneer to a simple technique and pretends that there is something unique about it. There isn’t. You could stroll down to your local community center and learn to practice meditation, perhaps for a donation of ten bucks.

I know some people have benefited from it, but I'm still skeptical about any guru or spiritual teacher or technique that requires payment. If it's truly beneficial for society, wouldn't you want it to be available to as many peope as possible? I'd suggest looking at the roots of TM if you can't or don't want to pay a guru. Maybe it evovled from an older practice you can learn for free."

Meditation,3djgqx,SaurabhJMadan,3,Thu Jul 16 19:37:12 2015 UTC,"I read about this a really long time ago. In hindsight it's really interesting, because the way the practice which implements this concept was described seems similar to vipassana: Whatever comes up in your mind you notice and lay aside, because ""neti neti"", I am not this, I am not that.  Nearly the same thing as noting practice, you just say different words."
Meditation,3djgqx,Wollff,2,Thu Jul 16 22:42:52 2015 UTC,"It is an insidious myth that it has to take years of practice to attain the first stage of enlightenment: stream entry. It only takes many years if one is doing it wrong. Unfortunately, most meditators make a number of mistakes that slows their progress to a crawl.  One common mistake is in thinking that Samatha alone will yield Wisdom. Samatha, by definition, is manifestly incapable of leading to insight. You can't see the truth of the mind if you are not observing the workings of the mind. Focusing intently in a single-pointed fashion on a meditation object is the polar opposite of observing the workings of the mind. Vipassana must be practiced in order to gain the insights necessary to enter the stream. This is not to say that Samatha is not a wholesome endeavor, it's a requirement to develop concentration, tranquility, and has a profound restive and restorative effect; it's great preparation for Vipassana.  Another common mistake is intending. If one has any intentions, whatsoever, progress will be greatly impeded. One must practice with a neutral, unbiased, equanimous mind. Bringing any intentions to the table is the proximate cause of inducing, e.g., frustration, impatience, anger, resentment, animosity, etc.; a frustrated mind is not a neutral mind. If you expect to become enlightened you will never become enlightened. That expectation will cause one's mind to prematurely, incessantly and constantly check whether or not the expectation has come to fruition. This subsequently causes the aforementioned negative states of mind, which results in a mind that is not neutral.  Yet another common mistake is attempting to control, force, or fight the mind. The mind is not you. You are not your thoughts. You cannot win any fight against the mind because you can't even fight it in the first place. Thinking that you can will merely result in unending misery as you'll be metaphorically flailing your fists about in front of you hoping to strike an opponent, yet you strike nothing but air. The mind is like the lungs. The lungs are not you. You are not your breaths. You cannot control your lungs, in any meaningful way, much like you cannot control your mind, in any meaningful way. You can ""borrow"" temporary directed control of the lungs, like your mind, but you have no de facto control of it whatsoever. The lungs will do what they do all on their own. Similarly, the mind will do whatever it does all on its own. Trying to battle the mind would be as nonsensical as trying to battle the lungs, if you thought that they, e.g., were respirating too fast or too slow, or too shallow or too deep. Your only job is to observe the mind; never to control it."
Meditation,3djgqx,garden-of-peace,2,Fri Jul 17 04:22:54 2015 UTC,Great comment. Thanks very much for the extremely informative read. As a quick follow up on intention: do you mean that one shouldn't carry the idea/wish/hope/yearn etc into a session as that will ultimately weight you down? Or that expressing that intention prior to practice is in itself bad? The reason I ask is many teachers  mention being clear in your intention when you practice. I'm guessing this is a case of confusing usages in different contexts but I'd love to hear your thoughts if you have a moment. Thanks.
Meditation,3djgqx,LarryBills,2,Fri Jul 17 04:49:36 2015 UTC,"Any expectation that is capable of being the mechanism of action -- the cause -- of suffering, internal or external to the context of practice, must not be expected.  Any given mental phenomenon arises as the direct result of a specific cause (or causes). For example, if you hope that meditation will calm you, and it doesn't calm you (fast enough, consistently enough, potently enough, ...), that very hope becomes the direct cause of the negative emotions -- the suffering -- that you will subsequently experience: frustration, annoyance, etc.  As such, to short-circuit that suffering, simply skip bothering to generate that hope in the first place. It's like understanding that eating a candy bar will make you gain weight and you simply choosing to not eat it in the first place as opposed to having to waste half an hour burning the 300 kcals off on a treadmill.  Additionally, the reason for many of the [Buddhist] moral precepts is not, in fact, to principally promote ethics but to principally reduce unnecessary cognitive and attentional load. If you lie, you have to maintain that lie, so as to not get caught. This wastes an utterly unprecedented amount of cognitive resources that would otherwise be free for your mind to devote to developing Mindfulness, the stable-observer, and Wisdom. This same concept applies to expecting as now your mind is going to have to waste cognitive resources continuously monitoring against that expectation.  This is why bothering to expect drastically reduces the rate of progress; it drastically reduces work capacity. Just imagine if you had built up a whole bunch of wishes, hopes, and yearnings..."

Here are some more precise instructions from Buddhist monk Henepola Gunaratana, in the book 'Mindfulness in Plain English:'   The breath [in the nostrils-area] will always remain your primary focus. You switch your attention to the distraction only long enough to notice certain specific things about it. What is it? How strong is it? and, how long does it last? As soon as you have wordlessly answered these questions, you are through with your examination of that distraction, and you return your attention to the breath. Here again, please note the operant term, wordlessly. These questions are not an invitation to more mental chatter. That would be moving you in the wrong direction, toward more thinking. We want you to move away from thinking, back to a direct, wordless and nonconceptual experience of the breath. These questions are designed to free you from the distraction and give you insight into its nature, not to get you more thoroughly stuck in it. They will tune you in to what is distracting you and help you get rid of it--all in one step."

I find it quite compelling how much easier it can be to feel loving kindness toward this person I hardly know, than it sometimes is to feel it for people I know a bit more.   Sometimes I think about the well-known saying, familiarity breeds contempt, and it reminds me to take a step back from the little details which make people I am closer to, more challenging to deal with. I think, if I can feel such love for a practical stranger, what humanity am I missing when I look at some friends and family members?   I used to think Metta worked the other way, with closer people being easier to feel metta for, teaching us to have the same feelings for strangers. Now I find that every time I meditate, the feelings flow in different directions each time.   I've cried, laughed heartily, felt neutral, and had a whole gamut of experiences.

Meditation,3de8lx,DarkwaterV2,7,Wed Jul 15 16:13:19 2015 UTC,5 weeks straight is awesome! Could you share what benefits you noticed overall?   Was it difficult to keep yourself on track every single day regarding carving  out meditation time?
Meditation,3de8lx,mirdellingpots,11,Wed Jul 15 18:58:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, overall this post about sums up what I'm noticing. It's the awareness of the fact that a lot of negative emotions are brought on entirely by my own thought processes. The more awareness, the more I can just shut the thoughts off and be content. I'm here, I'm young, I'm alive, the air is fresh and I'm pretty much a picture of health. That sort of stuff.  I'm reminded of a quote by Victor Frankl: “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space lies our freedom and power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and freedom.”   Keeping myself on track was not really difficult. Why not? Because I knew if I let it be difficult, it wouldn't work. That's why I started out as easy as possible.  Ten minutes a day. There is no conceivable excuse to not meditate for 10 minutes a day. Done your ten minutes but feel you can do more? No need! It's about forming the habit first of all. Don't burn yourself out in the least. No more than 10 minutes allowed. Done your ten minutes but you couldn't focus on your breathing at all? Mind running wild? No big! You did your 10 minutes. Cross off another day. Hell sometimes I was just too tired or stressed to even sit still for those ten minutes. No problem either. I tried and that's what counts. Miss a day completely? A shame, but you didn't miss it on purpose and there's always tomorrow. The point here is gradual habit forming and a distinctly positive self-coaching attitude as opposed to negative. Another quote, from Will Smith this time: ""You don't set out to build a wall. You don't say 'I'm going to build the biggest, baddest, greatest wall that's ever been built.' You don't start there. You say, 'I'm going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid. You do that every single day. And soon you have a wall.""  I used the 7 Weeks Android app to track my progress (there's probably an iOS version too). You can enter habits you want to pick up in there and it displays a 7-week calendar where you can cross off the days where you did what you wanted to. There's a whole subreddit for it called /r/theXeffect. The theory is that if you can consistently do something every day for 7 weeks, it's officially a habit and you've succesfully integrated it into your day-to-day.  As the weeks progressed I noticed it was getting easier. While I really had to put in the effort to sit and meditate in the beginning, it's much easier now. Wouldn't want to kill that streak! And as soon as you find the meditating really coming more easily, you can up the ante a little. I noticed meditating around lunch time was way more effective for me than meditating after 11PM, before going to sleep. So I'm meditating in the afternoon more often now. I'm even relaxing the timer-restrictions. I started a stopwatch instead of a countdown to see how long I could keep meditating effectively. 15 minutes on the nose. Great! Still only asking 10 minutes of myself, but 15 is fine too! But bear in mind this was a recent development. I'd been at the 10-minute stage for a whole month before this 15-minute session came along. It's all about forming the habit. Doing it right can come later. Focus on doing it at all first.  Also, I found what I can focus on the best: my abdomen. As I'm sitting, I try to focus completely on the air filling my abdomen, creating this tight feeling, like a belt, all around my midsection. And out it goes again. To me that's just the most concrete thing to focus on, and it allows me to quiet the mind down the easiest.  That's pretty much where I'm at now. Man, this turned into a whole rant. Hope it helps!"

I love the things meditation has brought to me so far, my empathy for people seems to have really been enhanced, I've been able to stop my thoughts running away with themselves as well as becoming more present in each moment.   Some days are harder than others and I think it's easy to forget how far you have come sometimes.

Meditation,3dgtfc,dokupehakase,5,Thu Jul 16 03:57:39 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that my five senses are just more thoughts appearing to me. Even the sensations of breathing are just created by this brain and I can see it as the same thing as a thought, but different in feeling.   You don't have to think about the sensations related to the breath to perceive them. They exist whether you think about them or not.   Is this an expected realization, or what? At what point is reality real and not just me thinking?   I think what has happened here is that you've started to bring your internal monologue into your awareness. Previously, this monologue was invisible to you, but now you're aware of a few of these thoughts, although you're still identified with them.   It is because you're perceiving the universe through the lense of your internal monologue that there is seemingly no distinction between a sight, for example, and your thoughts about that sight. Within the perspective of the internal monologue, nothing can exist without thought, because only once the monologue has told itself that its experiencing something does it notice it. From its perspective, if there was a sight in your mind but you didn't think about it, then it wouldn't exist, even if outside this perspective the sight is in your mind.  Your realisation suggest to me that your practice is cultivating awareness as it should. I think your realisation is based on insight, on the fact that you're beginning to be aware of your internal monologue, although I'd say that your interpretation of that insight is a little wonky. With realisations from meditation, it's best to sit on the fence for as long as possible, and to tentatively hold any ideas and beliefs you do form, so you're not concerned about giving them up later. Often our initial judgements are incorrect and if you become attached to that understanding, it can end up interfering with your practice. Ideally, you'd have a teacher who would prevent that from happening.  All that said, I wouldn't change what you're doing. I think you're headed in the right direction. As you continue practising, the distinction between your naked perceptions and your conceptualisations of those perceptions will become clearer."

It's good to know that meditating more will clear everything up.

I had this thought while meditating and started wondering whether it was 'right' or not, and I realized that if I asked some sort of master he'd probably just say to keep watching the breath   That's what the guru types tend to do. Very annoying. :)   You say I'll know the difference between naked perception and conceptualizations about those perceptions; does that mean my brain will let me see more of what I'm seeing and not filter so much out subconsciously?    You're already seeing everything, but because the mind gets caught up in the story of those things, it doesn't see those things as they are.   To give an example from my own experiences, I once hit a seeming plateau in my meditation, where it seemed like my mind was completely quiet. It remained that way for a while, maybe even several months, despite the fact that I was meditating a lot at the time. But then I started noticing that my mind wasn't as quiet as I thought, that I was thinking to myself thoughts like ""My mind is totally quiet right now"". Because I was identified with those thoughts, I hadn't seen them for what they were.  In one sense, I had always been aware of those thoughts. But because of the perspective with which I was viewing them, I hadn't perceived them as thoughts, and therefore I thought my mind was completely quiet. It's like when you're looking at a picture and you forget you're looking at a flat surface, and instead see a 3D image, the ""story"" of the picture. If you learn to distinguish the story you've read into the picture from the picture itself, the picture doesn't change. What changes is your relationship with the picture, because you realise the story was something you interpreted into the picture, not an inherent property of the picture itself, if that makes any sense."

Is this the same situation that you went on to describe regarding your mind being perfectly quiet?  It seems like there's going to have to be words or judgements made by us all.  When we recognize them for what they are, are they no longer our opinion anymore?  Sorry if my question is vague."
Meditation,3dgtfc,TastyPruno,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:19:52 2015 UTC,"One question here. You mentioned above that it is annoying when gurus simply tell you to return to your breath.   That was a joke.   Is this the same situation that you went on to describe regarding your mind being perfectly quiet?    When someone tells themselves that they're annoyed by something, they usually identify with those thoughts in the same way that I was identified with the thought ""My mind is so quiet"". So you could say that the reason those thoughts are veiled is due to the common factor of identification with them.   It seems like there's going to have to be words or judgements made by us all. When we recognize them for what they are, are they no longer our opinion anymore?   I'd describe judgements that appear in someone's mind as their opinions, since that's what they are by definition. That doesn't change if they no longer confuse their arbitrary judgements for reality. It's just how such things are described in language.   That said, there is a change in that person's relationship with those judgements, since they're no longer identified with them. The change is from the judgement being invisible, being assumed to be an inherent property of the universe, to the person realising the judgement is an interpretation of the universe.   So when they're identified with the judgement, they wouldn't recognise a judgement was made at all. If they unconsciously judged someone as greedy, for example, that person would appear to them as being inherently greedy. If they no longer identified with the judgement, saw it as it is, then they might say something like ""I think that they are greedy"" but would also appreciate that their judgement could be incorrect.   Sorry if my question is vague.   Feel free to clarify if I've misunderstood what you were asking."

Often times i ruminate to see if i am believing the ""right thing"".  Perhaps I have been looking at things wrong.  Maybe there's no problem with being wrong in judgements as long as you don't identify too strongly with them.  What stops us from becoming murderers and such as a result of this disidentification?"

Ultimately, meditation isn't primarily about your intellectual understanding, but about cultivating perceptual awareness. You may develop a more accurate intellectual understanding with greater awareness, but that isn't really the point of meditation.   What stops us from becoming murderers and such as a result of this disidentification?   Nothing, but my guess is that that identification has created more murderers than disidentification."

Usually there is a feeling that comes along with it, like anxiety, worry etc.  Notice what happens to this feeling when you watch it for a few seconds.      If you didn't notice this thought (you didn't have awareness), you would have identified with it (i am anxious) without even knowing it.

Meditation,3dgtfc,vajra_bendy_straw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:33:25 2015 UTC,"It may be good to look into physics, biology, evolutionary psychology, psychology if you want to understand more about the workings of: sensation, perception, and cognition.   I do understand that there are schools of philosophy that take your line of thought very seriously, but the scientific method has provided an extreme amount of evidence to validate it, whereas there is little to no evidence to support these philosophies.  A good take on these sorts of things is to not ignore them or act like they are irrational, but to seem them as interesting quirks of the mind. I had an experience a while back that was drug induced where I experienced god. Despite being a theistic at the time, I didn't take this experience seriously, I did not actually believe that god or a god was communicating with me, rather I understood that this was just my brain doing something interesting.  In a similar way, I have synesthesia to some degree. It isn't at all extreme, but music and sounds often have textures associated, concepts and thoughts are often represented in abstract pictures, and so on. I would not say that sound and texture are synonymous simply because it fits into my experience, but I might note that my brain interprets sounds as texture to some degree.  In a similar way, you might be noticing that you perceive thoughts the same as you do sensations. This is certainly interesting, but it isn't saying anything about the world, it is rather just saying something about your brain. It might also be true of other people's brain's.  Perhaps this is a pet peeve of mine, but I've heard a lot of people talk about how ""you are the universe"" and ""everything is one"" type experiences, and they act like it is a truth they discovered through meditation. I've had this sort of experience before, and there is no doubt that it is convincing in how it presents itself, but it is just an interesting mental state. I feel confident in saying that at the time it felt like everything was connected, but I would never claim that this subjective experience was revealing information to me about the nature of reality."

I feel confident in saying that at the time it felt like everything was connected, but I would never claim that this subjective experience was revealing information to me about the nature of reality.   With all due respect I think many people confuse the aims of two different projects with statements like this. To put them in common terms, I might say that the project of ""physics, biology, evolutionary psychology, psychology,"" etc, is to construct reference points about our experience which are as solid as possible using a rigorous and honest methodology. Meanwhile, for some people at least, the project of meditation is to deconstruct all reference points using a rigorous and honest methodology. And the hoped-for result there is not new information—new, better reference points—but structural change: transformation.  Both projects are (at their best) approaches to the big WTF of being: basically, ""what the heck is going on here?!"" :) And they both (at their best) are rigorous, honest, and completely genuine approaches.  But there is a tendency among many people to assume that one project or the other is the ""correct"" reference point for all experience—the ""real"" project. To use the terms of one project to validate or invalidate the results of the other project.  When overly woo-woo people do this it's a pretty embarrassing blunder since the whole project is to deconstruct reference points; not to find the ""right"" one, at all. When overly intellectual people do this, they insist on reducing all experience to descriptive terms. An experience can then never just be itself. It must be the brain doing something interesting. Not that that isn't necessarily happening, too, but to reduce experience to a description is to neuter it.  Interestingly, this also seems to be the basic move of self construction, aka the ego: take experience arising in the radical openness of being and fit it into a coherent self/other narrative as quickly as possible. Reduce the unknown to something manageable and ""known"" as quickly as possible. Whether that known thing is a chakra or neural pathways. This kind of thing is totally necessary for survival, but to treat every experience in this way becomes very painful. Especially if your narratives include maladaptive assumptions about your self. Most folks' narratives seem to.  tl;dr Anyway my point is that it is entirely possible to hold experiences like ""everything is one"" as valid and real in some sense, and also to accept the predominant physicalist/scientific reference points of the world as valid and real in an equally strong sense. I think it's a mistake, on the other hand, to use one project as the ""real"" project against which the other must be validated when the projects' terms of validation are quite different. Both are aimed at investigating the nature of reality and both can be quite rigorous and genuine."

You can stare at an object or whatever and repeat the mantra ""seeing"" in your mind and you focus all your attention on what you are seeing without thinking about what you are seeing.   You can then listen to the sounds around you while repeating ""hearing or listening"" in your mind. Pay attention to the sounds around you for a few minutes and you will feel like as if you are meditating.   You can also focus on the way your skin/body feels. I usually do this when I go out for a walk in evening when it's windy. I focus my attention to how the wind feels on my skin and I try to experience that moment. It feels amazing.   If you are around something that gives fresh/sweet air, you can focus your attention to that smell. It's like trying to smell with full conciousness."

One way is to just keep meditating after you get up from sitting.  You can observe the breath during daily activities.  When walking, you can count steps per breath.  Or you can note each thing you do as you do it. Like if you are washing the dishes, you would say to your self, ""rinsing"" as you rinse something, ""reaching"" as you reach for another dish ... etc. If the water feels hot say ""hot"". If the dishes clink together say ""hearing"". If a bowl has an intense color say ""seeing"". etc.  You should always try to do it in a relaxed way, if you are too  intense about it, it can become a source of stress which it should not be."

Meditation,3df1nu,Kraktruk,2,Thu Jul 16 11:58:26 2015 UTC,"It’s difficult to say how much the contribution of meditation was vs. the contribution of alcohol. But it was probably a mix. The meditation does begin to give you access to emotions that you have suppressed, for sure. It does this by giving you more awareness about yourself. Sometimes this “increase” is not necessarily an actual increase in emotion, but simply that you notice more when the emotion happens. Judging by what you’ve written, I think that you understood that to some extent.   Alcohol lowers inhibitions, and in so doing, can make us express emotion that we might have suppressed, but it’s not necessarily a healing expression when it comes from this. In an intoxicated state, we may actually replay negative thoughts and feelings over and over, and fan the flames, making it more intense and entrenched. When emotions arise in a mindful state, we feel them, but we’re more inclined to let them flow through us with less resistance, letting them release."

Meditation,3de554,JustMeRC,2,Wed Jul 15 15:47:28 2015 UTC,"It's a long read, but worth it for those who have questions about about the renunciations involved in some meditation practices.   From the article:  In a nutshell, monks and nuns evolve by living a life of detachment, disconnection, and aloofness. They may be very attached to their robes and their spiritual order, but their practice is about renouncing their desire for ""worldly things."" For them, spirituality is irrevocably tied up with denial.  Non-monks, on the other hand, evolve through working with the material world. Detachment is not the primary attitude to cultivate. Rather, the opposite of detachment is indicated: being involved, close, committed, and intimate. For some odd reason, (ignorance? unskillfulness?) this distinction is not being honored, and the wrong techniques are being taught on a wide scale – “sadhu-style” practices, which may be appropriate for 1% or less of the modern Western population, are being recommended for the 99% of the population that are householders."
Meditation,3de554,snickerpops,3,Wed Jul 15 15:52:20 2015 UTC,"I think this type of ""distinction"" confuses the issues.    Attachment is what tortures people and causes suffering.  But to be able to deal effectively you have to understand that what we call ""attachment"" is merely the idea that something will cause you to be happy.     Rather, the opposite of detachment is indicated: being involved, close, committed, and intimate.   Not being attached does not mean ""detached"".  Being attached to something means that you care for the wrong reasons.   When this is fixed, the result is not that you do not care at all, but that you care for the right reasons.    Spirituality is the process of finding your source  happiness in inner rather than outer sources.   Love, happiness, and joy come from the inside, so one cannot find them in outer temporary and changing circumstances.    Happiness and joy are made out of consciousness.   So they can only be found inside, in one's own inner consciousness.  The result of this is that people are not attached or looking for happiness in outer sources.    For example, a person who is attached to his mate thinks that his happiness comes from her, so he might suffocate her in his desire to be close to her, and torture her with his desire for happiness from her.   A non-attached householder can still love his wife and children very deeply, but knows that his happiness does not come from them.   Secure in this knowledge, he can treat his family according to their needs rather than his own, because he is focused on their happiness, not trying to extract his own happiness from them.   So non-attachment is for all.    However you can not be non-attached until you has found happiness in the core of your being.    Until then you are forced to chase it in the will-o-the-wisp of outer termporary and changing circumstances.   This creates tremendous torture, because the law of change will take away external  happiness even if someone seems to find it.    All that being said, I do agree with the main point -- that there are practices that create dispassion and distance from ones feelings that are more appropriate in the ashram or for mature practitioners.    Most young people who are searching for higher consciousness need more love in their lives, since love provides purpose and meaning.   When they do ashram practices that create more dispassion to false motivations, they end up feeling adrift."

Meditation,3de554,snickerpops,3,Wed Jul 15 23:54:29 2015 UTC,"I think the next sentence makes pretty clear what is meant:   When this is fixed, the result is not that you do not care at all, but that you care for the right reasons.   Especially in a western context, a detached person is someone who doesn't care about anything at all. It has a nihilistic ring to it, which also comes through very strongly when the author talks about the term:   For a householder, practicing detachment is indistinguishable from practicing depression. The symptoms defining depression include: loss of interest in most or all activities, significant change in weight or appetite, sleep disturbance, slowed behavior, loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness, and suicidal thoughts.   Does not being attached mean ""detached"" in the sense that is explained in this paragraph? I don't think so. And I think this was what more or less what snickerpops wanted to say here.   It's true, those implications are not necessarily correlated with the term. But they certainly go together whenever the author uses it."
Meditation,3de554,Gojeezy,2,Thu Jul 16 09:42:54 2015 UTC,"The terms ""attachment"" and ""detachment"" are borrowed from the physical world to create an analogy for something that is hard to see and understand:  human feelings.    As an analogy, it is necessarily imperfect.  Only a psychopath or sociopath is truly detached.    The goal of monastic aspirations is not to be an uncaring psychopath.    So a fully realized monk might work tirelessly to build a hospital, and if someone steals the money or destroys the hospital not be affected by that negative outcome.   He cares enough for the suffering of the people to work to build the hospital, but he does not get upset at setbacks but continues working for the end goal.    A person who is attached to the outcome of building a hospital might work hard to build the hospital, but then when that outcome is threatened by theft or fire, get upset and depressed and maybe discouraged.     So the monk does care -- he is not detached from the suffering of the people and he is motivated to work hard to alleviate their suffering.   Many monks and people known as saints are hard at work with charitable works all around the world -- they are not detached from the world, but working hard to improve it.   There are also many psychopaths and sociopaths who are detached -- they are the ones who would steal the hospital money and run away with it.    There is also the famous example of the Nestle company offering free formula to breast feeding mothers in Africa long enough for their breast milk to dry up.    Then when their ""free trial"" ran out they were forced to buy more.   If they could not afford the formula or did not understand that you could not ""stretch"" it by adding more water, or if they were not able to get fresh clean water for the formula, their babies died.    That is true detachment."

The point I was trying to make with the way I defined detachment was that, these two ideas are not mutually exclusive. That is to say, an individual can be detached and still be working for the benefit of others.   That is true detachment.   I do not understand defining a term and then saying ""that is the true definition"" since without explicit definitions the definition is based on context."
Meditation,3de554,Gojeezy,2,Thu Jul 16 17:37:35 2015 UTC,"I was making the points the way I was so that new people do not think that the goal is somehow to become uncaring.    Yes, there is vagueness in these definitions -- you are correct about that.    Very often people are unhealthily focused on the ideas that outside things will make them happy.  One result of practice is to get rid of the unhealthy attachments while still leaving normal healthy emotional connections alive.   Western society is filled with people who are focused on work and careers to the detriment of human connection.   The result of this is an epidemic of depression and anxiety.   We have tremendous things and an abundance of food, but the people are often lonely and nervous and unconnected.     They do not realize that love is necessary for a sense of meaning in life. Without love and normal connection, all meanings are arbitrary and culturally imposed.   When people like this without much love in their life start practicing and realizing that their lives are empty of meaning, it can be frightened to them and it can create emotional problems for them.    If you look up the Wikipedia definition of detachment, it has two definitions: one is a pathological inability to connect emotionally.      Emotional detachment in the first sense above often arises from psychological trauma and is a component in many anxiety and stress disorders. The person, while physically present, moves elsewhere in the mind, and in a sense is ""not entirely present"", making them sometimes appear preoccupied or distracted. In other cases, the person may seem fully present but operate merely intellectually when emotional connection would be appropriate. This may present an extreme difficulty in giving or receiving empathy and can be related to the spectrum of narcissistic personality disorder.[1]   The second definition is a decision to not connect emotionally:   Emotional detachment in the second sense above is a decision to avoid engaging emotional connections, rather than an inability or difficulty in doing so, typically for personal, social, or other reasons. In this sense it can allow people to maintain boundaries, psychic integrity and avoid undesired impact by or upon others, related to emotional demands. As such it is a deliberate mental attitude which avoids engaging the emotions of others.  Emotional detachment also allows acts of extreme cruelty, such as torture and abuse, supported by the decision to not connect empathically with the person concerned. Social ostracism, such as shunning and parental alienation, are other examples where decisions to shut out a person creates a psychological trauma for the shunned party.[3] As a result, the decision as to whether emotional detachment in any given set of circumstances is considered to be a positive or negative mental attitude is a subjective one, and therefore a decision on which different people may not agree.   The person who is not attached as a result of deep meditative practice becomes a normal healthy person.     ""Non-attachment"" is a state of not being overly attached, not detached and aloof from normal emotional connections.    Humans need emotional connection, and a person without any emotional connections is a psychopath.   In the definition above, where there are positive aspects of detachment, what is mean is avoiding unhealthy or negative attachment or avoiding negative results but leaving normal levels of human emotional connection.      Monks will typically disconnect from normal human family relations in order not to distract from their goal, but will normally replace that with work based on uplifting all humanity, such as the Dalai Lama working for world peace.    So maybe saying that the ""true"" definition is not correct, but the main point is that the result of correct meditative and spiritual practice is one who cares in the right and healthy way.     Attachment itself has several definitions at least.     In psychological terms, it just means emotional connection.     Metta meditation, or compassion meditation, is all about creating healthy emotional loving connection.    So that is not avoided in meditative practice.    What is avoided is unhealthy ideas that external things can make you happy, such as money or career or family love.    That is what ""attachment"" often refers to.    The main point here is that loss of normal healthy emotional connections is not ""nonattachment"" and it is not the goal of meditative practice.     I am writing quickly here in offhand ways so yes I might word things in ways that can be improved."

I then went on to say that regardless of how much you practice a person should consider that.

Though in my experience it is (mainly, generally) created by by our minds, I am not invalidating therapy, medicine or other ways of going about it as that can work for people, but time and time again I have seen meditation and mindfulness being quite a miraculous tool, it has helped me, over both a short and long term period, bring me from an unbalanced, restless, unhappy state of mind to a peaceful happy state of being. Over the years I went from Depressed > sad > less sadness > neutral > ok > subtle peace, more peace / subtle joy that keeps evolving.   So for this reason, because it has not only has removed the initial feelings of depression but also because it revealed feelings of peace, joy and contentment, is it that I belief that everyone is capable of finding and experiencing this, by continual consistent practice of tuning down the mind and going more and more within, where our peaceful happy self exists."

What’s your view?   From this buddhist's perspective, this may be because meditation doesn't need to ""cure"" depression. It is about accepting depression and weakening its hold on us through this acceptance. Nothing needs to be banished, eradicated or wiped out; it's more a question of vanquishing it.  That said, I must acknowledge that I am -to date- blessed by never having suffered from depression and I can imagine how my outlook might be perceived as frustratingly naive by those who have."

Meditation,3dbu7y,JustaThought4ya,3,Sun Jul 19 01:40:48 2015 UTC,"I think it really, really depends on how your depression manifests.  My depression manifested as physical and mental exhaustion, not sadness.   Have you ever really overexerted yourself?  Like, to the point you couldn't lift your arm anymore because it just couldn't, when it stops being a matter of willpower and starts being a matter of the muscle being physically incapable of working more?  That's how it felt to me, except it was my brain and all the rest in the world wouldn't fix it.  I don't know if acceptance can really help in that situation, although I also didn't try.  Not everyone's depression manifests like mine, and it might help for some (I'm positive we'll eventually figure out that ""major depression"" is in fact multiple distinct disorders).

You wrote (in your fascinating interview) that you couldn't understand why some buddhists were reluctant to say that meditation ends depression.   The answer is simple: it was never intended to end depression. I doubt the buddha actually knew what depression was! Meditation is used to cultivate insight - although I stand open to correction on this.  Research (the holy measure by which the Science Age silences dissent) also suggests that meditation can give rise to both depression and suffering...at least that seems to be the premise of the new publication The Buddha Pill.  I think you might be saying that the eradication of suffering implies the eradication of depression. I don't agree, but have to recognise that I am far from an expert in this. However, my position was only ever put forward to provide an explanation to your bewilderment at why some buddhists were reluctant to say that meditation can cure depression.

If you have decided that depression is part of some sort of genus then this explains your confusion. If you cannot -or will not- understand why other people may have a different view, then that pretty much closes down any discussion.  Is depression also pain? Is pain part of the genus suffering or is suffering part of the  genus pain? For me, there is plain and there is suffering. There is suffering and there is depression. One can experience pain and not experience suffering. One can experience suffering and not experience depression. Where you and I differ is that I can envision feeling depression and yet not suffering.  By the way, it's quite a jump to assume that the Buddha left his palace because he was depressed. It's probably less of a jump to assume that he left because he was dissatisfied with the palatial life and what it had to offer him. Dissatisfaction is also different to depression.  Your point about science backing up your thesis is disingenuous. Show me one well-designed scientific study that proves that meditation cures depression and I will readily concede this point - without asking you to explain the disconcerting evidence. Remember that the scientific method doesn't require you to supply confirming evidence, but to use your hypothesis to explain any evidence that suggests it is wrong. If you seriously want to invoke the blessing of Science, you are either suggesting that nobody who meditates can suffer from depression (which would be absurd) or that you can explain why some meditators continue to suffer from depression despite the fact that meditation cures depression.

Meditation,3dbu7y,Darkchyylde,9,Thu Jul 16 15:04:54 2015 UTC,"Meditation ultimately cured my depression. The real problem that I had to overcome before my depression would ever get better was forming positive habits. These included a consistent sleeping schedule, exercise, folding laundry as soon as it was finished, etc.  Before I even knew that mediation would help I started with exercise. This helped with a sense of well-being, confidence, and perseverance for the long 5 year road ahead. Exercise didn't cure the depression, but just made it tolerable and gave me the ability to do things like keep a job. Eventually I realized that after talking to four therapists they all recommended mindfulness if I was not going to take medication. Eventually I decided to do some research and landed on mediation. Signed up for Headspace and after about 8 months of near-daily mediation I can say that I am cured  and have no worries of relapse. The catch is that I had to perform a habit on a daily basis, but that gets easier by the day. I really had to persevere though, because even though the first few weeks of meditation seemed to help, it seemed no greater than placebo. I had to stick with it and trust science.   I am now reading a book called The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Please read this book! It reflects a similar journey that helped me to recover and I guarantee it would be the perfect start to recovery. Curing depression is simply about using neuroplasticity to change your default perspective to something naturally positive. This is accomplished by invoking positive habits. Habits of which their effectiveness may vary a little between individuals. I have noticed a huge change in my initial response to my environment. I use to always have a naturally negative outlook, but now it's positive.  There are many tools in the toolbox of recovery, and some tools may work better for some people than for others. Just remember that a tool is useless if left sitting in the toolbox."

After finding out my wife got pregnant I knew there needed to be a change. After 5 months of meditation right up until the birth of my child, I regained control of myself, got used to the married life and became a functioning and productive member of society. The huge fights my wife and I use to have became respectful conversations of compromise. I got out of bed everyday, was able to work out regularly and even improved my situation at work.  Still, I had to meditate daily and exercise regularly.  Now that my daughter is here I am going through a whole new period of adjustment and learning.

Meditation,3dbu7y,phro,3,Wed Jul 15 10:08:37 2015 UTC,"much of the cause of depression is being stuck in a cycle of negative moods and thoughts. the idea of meditation is you take your attention down into your body and take yourself out of that habitual rumination and over time gaining more discipline to bring yourself out of that cycle.  however, meditation alone often isn't really enough, you need a lifestyle change, much like doing a course in mindfulness (buddhist or Jon Kabat-Zinn clinical style). but it's definitely possible to defeat it all the same."

No, new research shows that the causative factors are not abstract and intangible chemicals that are out of our control, but real life stress that has shape and form in various situations and thought processes.

Meditation,3dbu7y,AlwaysBeNice,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:48:47 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand me. Life stressors do indeed influence depression, but they can only do so through a chemical mediation. We have moved away from vague psychological explanations of mental health in order to look at multiple causes. However, no matter whether the causes are societal or behavioural, they still result in effects at a chemical level. This is highlighted in the link your provided. The 'thought processes' you talk about - what do you think underlies them? The chemical reactivity of the brain, not some mysterious subconscious!"
Meditation,3dbu7y,Hans-U-Rudel,0,Thu Jul 16 08:51:23 2015 UTC,"You are confusing the issue, as several people have pointed out already. Chemical differences can be detected in every thing we do, that does not mean they cause them at all, or that we need external chemicals to change them. That is way more mysterious than dealing with tangible stressors in life. If people show more levels of cortisone when angry, does that mean they should take anti-cortisones, or work on their anger? The stressors underlie the chemical changes, not the other way around."
Meditation,3dbu7y,ZosoGG,0,Thu Jul 16 15:02:18 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but you are creating a false dichotomy. I appreciate the point you are trying to make, but cause and effect are intimately intertwined. If we are unable to source an 'external stressor' for depression then our next best bet is to treat the symptoms. Don't get me wrong, I am very supportive of psychological as well as biological therapies, but ultimately it all boils down to biological factors. Look at CBT for anxiety. By recognising the racing heart and breathlessness as a false flag, we can reduce the feedback loop thereby reducing anxiety over time. Regardless of the stressor, it is a biological misattribution that is important here. The downregulation that occurs during CBT is simply a way of modulating chemical activity.  So sure, work on your anger, but the effect is still a biological one: down-regulation of the cortisol response. If someone has anger bordering on a clinical condition however, then yes we need to treat it chemically, alongside any other psychological treatment that can benefit them. As I have stated before, I am not disregarding the potential benefits of meditation in treating depression, just making clear that some people DO benefit more from drug treatments.  EDIT: and also, biological factors CAN underlie stressor response. See e.g. predisposition to depression with differing gene lengths coding for serotonin transporters."

Buddhism pinpoints that source precisely: the suffering that comes from attachment and craving. That is what meditation addresses and why it resolves the problem. Science and anecdote show it works. No need to treat symptoms when the ""source"" has been uprooted - unless you are trying to make a billion dollars on meds.   And as for your  outdated 2003 study, it proves nothing. Newer research has found that genes are also altered through  both meditation and stress, showing they, like your mysterious ""chemicals"",  are not the primary underlying factor: http://news.wisc.edu/22370"

What I am saying is that this interaction goes both ways. It is not correct to say that depression is only the fault of external stressors. And it is offensive to suggest that 'oh you're only depressed because you can't deal with your suffering - just get rid of craving and attachment and it will all be fine'. I think we all know that removing attachment and craving is not easy!  Your link is not hugely supportive of your claims: ""However, it is important to note that the study was not designed to distinguish any effects of long-term meditation training from those of a single day of practice.""

The four noble truths are, ""problem (suffering in buddhism), source of problem (clinging), solution to problem (detachment), path leading to solution of problem (noble eight-fold path)"".   These truths can basically be applied to every problem. In this case, if the solution is a positive state of mind then there is still a path that has to be followed to develop the solution.  By following the buddhist path, the last step being meditation, you might continue to be physically depressed for any various reason but you would let go of the mental clinging that results in mental depression."

If (and it's a big if) I could have gotten into a regime of effective meditation during my experience with depression, I think it would have been almost as effective as the medication I was on, which really worked wonders for me, you hear a lot about people having weird psychological side effects from anti depressants, but my experience was as good as you can get, no side effects and a gradual improvement until my body got used to them and i found the right dosage, then I was like any other normal, happy person, consistently.

You say that it is beatable because the mind is plastic, but it is not the mind that is plastic but the brain. Plasticity is a function of chemical change, and it is this chemical change which may aid in the reduction of depressive symptoms (which are, in turn, caused by biological factors). However, it is not a perfect process, and there are verifiable biological markers of depression as there are with all mental disorders.  As I have said in other comments, meditation may be able to help depression in some individuals, but anecdotal evidence is useless in developing useful approaches to treatment.

Psychiatry includes drug treatments and talking therapies, both of which have shown success for different people.  Yes, lots of people have benefitted from meditating, I am not disputing that. But the evidence for its effectiveness in treating depression is still in the early stages. We don't develop new treatments for people based on word of mouth. We need to know who they work best for and how to best implement them. It is no good saying 'well just meditate'. You need to establish a consistent course of care - how long to meditate for, what sort of meditation, etc etc.  I'm afraid it is you who is misunderstanding the complexity of the affliction, by boiling down all negative mental phenomena to some mysterious thing that can be solved if we all just meditated. It undermines the varying degrees of difficulty people with different mental health problems have. There is plenty of evidence for differing types of biological causes in different types of mental health disorder: anxiety has different underlying pathology to depression, as does schizophrenia etc. Whilst I agree that almost everyone can benefit from meditation, it should not be seen as a sledgehammer approach to mental health treatment.

There is some evidence that meditation rewires the brain so long time meditators might have better concentration, but the factors I mentioned at the time you meditate can have a really big effect on your ability to concentrate.   Try to notice how you get distracted. Do you completely stop meditating when you are distracted, for example do you stop counting the breath? Or, does part of your mind wander while you are still meditating, for example you continue to count in the back of your mind. The latter is pretty normal and you have to really meditate a lot to get past that stage.  Try meditating in the morning after eating breakfast. If you meditate in the evening your mind might be turbulent from all the day's activity and stress.  After you eat a balanced meal you will also be more relaxed, less stressed, and might have better concentration (unless it makes you drowsy). If you are anxious it can be almost impossible to meditate because anxiety can cause you to be fixated on the source of stress. Try to meditate when you are not anxious. If you are meditating to cope with stress, you might have better results from relaxation exercises.

I would like to add that you be easy on yourself and accept that the mind is unruly and wanders off frequently. Let go of any inner criticisms or notions that if your mind wanders you are not doing it right. Ironically, once you become comfortable with that, you will relax into sustained concentration with ease."
Meditation,3dfqwu,mbalavi,2,Thu Jul 16 01:11:03 2015 UTC,"I think you should try perseverance.  The mind wanders? The mind wanders. Ain't no thang.  Do you spot it wandering off? Yes, you do...you're already more mindful than most.  Months are not years (self-evident, I know!). Years are not decades. Perhaps the fruits of the practice take a long time to blossom?"
Meditation,3dfqwu,HarshaKarpos,2,Thu Jul 16 06:18:15 2015 UTC,"You should try more clear practice.  You have tried various methods rather than sticking to one. When you check your practice and judge it to be insufficient, you change. This keeps the picking-and-choosing mind alive. But you have to do away with that mind, and only follow the method. If you switch your approach whenever things get tough, you will never break through the tough parts.  And just labeling things 'tough' is already a problem. This is called checking: stepping outside of the practice to have a look at yourself and make judgments. Checking is the number one problem people have in meditation (and in life!). So you have to learn to only do it!  How did you learn the methods? Are you very clear on what the method is, how you should apply your mind at any moment and in any situation? This is important. So both the learning and the application of method should be very meticulous. When you know very well what to do, and when you do it without wavering, then the method has the chance to work and you can grow in trust of it. But if there is doubt about what to do, then wavering, then suspicion, it is difficult or impossible to develop faith and commitment that propel you past obstacles.  Next, practicing on your own tends to be self-limiting: you practice only to the limits of your own preference and view. You tend to find reasonable what you have always found reasonable, and you tend to find unreasonable what you have always found unreasonable. So it is difficult on your own to move beyond the habits that have always limited you.  Therefore you need to use external structures to help you. The foremost support, and indeed precious and powerful gift, is contact with a good, respected teacher who has attained the fruits of the method. Better yet, contact with an enlightened being. (There are many!) The degree and ways of support a good teacher provides are inconceivable.  Next, practice with a group of sincere seekers has many benefits you can't possible find on your own. You can be inspired. You can share your own inspiration and help, overcoming selfishness. You can see role models at every stage of the path. You can receive teachings in everyday-life contexts. And you can be supported by the schedule and form that everyone follows (rather than falling back on your own personal preference).  The rest of your life is also inextricably linked to meditation. It is impossible to use your bodymind in negative ways in life, and then to experience clear meditation and spiritual progress. You clear and calm your mind as much with your everyday activity as with special sessions of meditation. So learning about karma — the positive and negative causes you make, and their positive and negative results — is essential to meditative progress.  Finally, you can adjust the environments, relationships, and routines of your life to support you. Your mind is influenced by everything. Is your living space clear and clean and noble-minded, or does it encourage slackness and vulgarity? Do your relationships aim at peace and truth and love? Are your sleeping, eating, and physical activity in balance? These are ways you can help your mind to focus and be calm. For example, one enlightened master, Mangala Anshumati, says that proper eating can account for half our effort on the spiritual path — it is so influential.  In the practice session itself, use the structures of environment, ritual, and posture to help you. Clear and clean the space for practice. In the old days, with more access to natural spaces, the ideal locale was a fairly secluded glade where the sounds of wind in trees or running water would naturally calm the mind and heart. Mountains are also traditionally excellent sites for meditation. In our modern lives, we may need to create some beauty and spaciousness and flow in our living spaces to welcome that ease.  An altar can help you focus your intent and ignite your aspiration. You can place a sacred image on the altar — an image of an enlightened being, or a symbol of enlightenment itself. This is not to be thought of as worshipping an external god, but rather as honoring your own enlightened nature. You already have a mind that is perfectly clear; and you wish to approach it and unify with it. So besides doing that in meditation, you can do that with an altar: it is a place where you approach and unify with your original clear and compassionate nature.  An altar can be a whole separate table, or it can be a small area cleared on a shelf. A simple offering can be made, of water, or light, or something beautiful like a flower or fruit. This moves your energy in the right direction — in the direction of giving yourself to life rather than trying to take something from life. (It's not that you shouldn't receive good things, but that the attitude of grasping keeps you in your churning, suffering mind; and the attitude of offering moves you to your calm, content mind. In fact, starting your meditation from a place of offering rather than getting can change your meditation and your life!)  Doing your practice in the same way and at the same time each day creates a power of repetition. If you repeatedly apply yourself sincerely, regardless of difficulty, each new time will build on a foundation of previous efforts, and will gain power from them. If you do this very regularly there will be times when the repetition itself carries you along, when otherwise you would be at a loss.  Posture of mind and body go together. Your body posture should be upright without being rigid. Learn correct meditation posture (another reason to study with a living teacher). The body supports the mind in awakening by taking an awake posture. The body supports the mind in relaxing by taking a relaxed posture. Meditation posture should be both awake and relaxed.  ~  The most significant parameter of all is why you do your practice. If the motivation is only selfish, to get some good condition for yourself, it is inherently distracting; it perpetuates the dualistic, self-obsessed, grasping mind. If the motivation is generous, for the benefit of all, it is inherently stabilizing, as the mind finds its essential home not in the world of appearances but in radiant compassion.  So behind all of the structures I wrote about above is the issue of why you do practice or why you do anything in life. What is the best, most complete motivation? It must include all others, the whole universe of universes, and not be limited to narrow self-service.  ~  I hope this helps as a fairly complete guide to beginning practice: gathering the conditions that lead to clarity."
Meditation,3dfqwu,TheHeartOfTuxes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:08:10 2015 UTC,"What I do is just notice the breath. Sitting upright helps with my focus for that. Thoughts will come and I don't note them or anything like that, and I don't go on a tangent about how I""m supposed to be focusing on my breath, I just return immediately to the breath. Just keep returning immediately to the breath and eventually you'll return faster and faster.   when I say immediately, I mean immediately when you notice you've wandered. The time between noticing and wandering will decrease as you practice more.   This is what helps me. There's no pausing to note or worry, just go right back to the breath."

Meditation,3dh0ij,kramerjameson,2,Thu Jul 16 05:08:14 2015 UTC,"It should not be due to strength because you should sit so you are balanced and not using a lot of strength. If you can stand or walk for 20 minutes you have enough strength to sit for 20 minutes.  You might need to stretch so you can sit more in a more balanced way. Stretch your back by sitting on the floor with legs out in front and lean forward to touch your toes, let your chin fall to touch the top of your sternum,  point your toes towards your head. Stretch the other way: standing up, move your shoulder blades back towards each other push your chest out and neck back. Be careful stretching, move slowly, don't use a lot of force, let time do the stretching not force, so you don't hurt yourself.  Sit on a cushion, or a couple of bed pillows, or a folded blanket, so your pelvis slopes down and forward and that will give your lower back a more natural curve than you get sitting directly on the floor and you will be able to sit with your spine balanced not supported with strength. But this shifts weight on the knees so you have to be aware that it could cause knee problems.  If you are having difficulty finding a balanced posture, try putting your hands on your knees or thighs to help support the weight of your trunk rather than using your back to hold yourself up.   You should not feel a lot of tension in your back when you sit, that will lead to back pain.  But I think it's okay to ignore what I wrote and meditate in a chair and lean back if your back hurts or even if it doesn't hurt."

Meditation,3dh0ij,lightqwerty,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:00:49 2015 UTC,"If you are doing it for the first time, you will experience some discomfort near your ankles....especially if you do it on a hard surface...(like floor etc)..you may experience some pain...  But with time..as you keep practicing this, you will find that pain goes away and your ankles will be much more flexible.  I have never used a meditation bench as such....But i used to do it on a mattress...or a carpet...or any soft surface when i was starting....now i can do it on any floor on top of a simple thin blanket....But the best place and the best ""surface"" i found for meditating in this posture is...in an open area..like a garden or a park and in the Grass (with a blanket on the grass)...  So my recommendation is as follows:  1) If you can do it on grass (which i think is the best way), take a blanket...or bed sheet..or something of that sort (basically a piece of cloth to sit on)...lay it down on the grass...and practice on that... You will find that your ankles may get numb after a while ...but as time goes on it will get easier for you to sit in this position.  2) If you can not do it on the grass,... do it in your house...keep a cushion on the floor and practice it on that...and once you get comfortable with practicing on the cushion, you can replace the cushion with a simple blanket.   And i Just have two words of caution for practicing this,  1) Never ever do it on the bare floor/ground. Always keep a blanket (atleast) on the floor.  2) Always stretch your ankles before and after performing this posture, especially if you have stiff ankles and never force yourself to sit for long especially if you start experiencing pain.  But, there is nothing to be scared of. If done correctly, this is pretty helpful. You can read more about this posture on the internet."

That's a bit different than how I was taught.   The advice typically offered by meditation teachers is to ignore it. Let your heartbeat be one sensation of many, and give it no particular energy or attention, they say.   In my experience, ignore isn't what most teachers instruct (those I've been exposed to, at least). Instead it's more ""let it be,"" independent from you and your attention. Ignore is kind of like covering your eyes and ears and repeating ""that's not happening.""  Good chatting!"

Meditation,3dea45,ibzzi,2,Wed Jul 15 16:24:05 2015 UTC,"I don't really know anything about hyperventilation, but the solution to the problem of stage fright is simple.  It's 99 percent rehearsal.  Practice, practice, and more practice, until you can do your set in your sleep.  This is how I dealt with stage fright as an actor.  It's not a fear that the audience won't like you or that you won't be performing at your peak.  It's a fear of ****** up.  I know the look of agony in the eyes of an actor who has no idea what his line is and doesn't even know how to fake it.  It's Hell.  That's what inspired me to learn my lines.  The other one percent is mostly knowing how to get through the first minute or so of your act.  That's the critical part.  When you're through that, you've pretty much got it made. If your band is into jams, I'd work it out so that you can rely on something well-rehearsed at the start of your act.    People have different ways to get ready just before going onstage.  I would like to be ""in neutral"" - relaxed, not in character.  Whatever suits you."
Meditation,3dea45,SamuelColeridgeValet,2,Wed Jul 15 17:25:47 2015 UTC,"It's good that you are turning to meditation. It will help you but also be aware that it may unlock something deeper within you that may need to be addressed. Having someone to call on whenever you feel like you are not grounded and going into anxiety is very important. A friend is fine but usually someone professional is a better option. All of that said, what I believe is one of the most important things when practicing meditation is to ground yourself. Whatever seated position you decide to take, be aware of the earth beneath you and imagine that you are rooting yourself with the image of actual roots or some sort of cord that will keep you connected to the earth. A great way of coming back to the present moment and not the chatter in your mind or the loss of control emotionally is to connect to your senses. It's mindfulness meditation and you simply start by being aware of your breathing. What does it feel like? Can you feel your breath flowing in through your nose and exiting from your nose? Stay with this awareness until you are much more present and then move that awareness, that single pointed focus, over your entire body, beginning at the crown of the head and moving down to your toes. You are just recognizing sensation. You can bring your awareness to your sense of smell by being aware of any odors around you, to your sense of taste just by swallowing and your sense of hearing by listening to the sounds around you, diving deeply into the sounds, not just hearing the superficial noises. Keeping the eyes close, dive down behind the eyes and ""look"" within. Go into the void. Perhaps you'll see color. There's no wrong experience, as it is yours. Lastly, feel any parts of your skin that may have sensation. While you do this, commit to being completely still. This, too, will keep you present as this takes effort and awareness. I know that you said the breathing exercises weren't helping but try this one if it hasn't been suggested. This will calm you. And if you need to do the mindfulness practice first to be able to do the breath work, do that. Breathe in slowly through your nose (mouth closed) for a count of 4, hold for a count of 7 without tensing up the chest, neck/throat and shoulders and then touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, open your mouth and allow the breath to release on an 8 count with almost a hissing sound as the breath releases. Do this several times or until your mind comes to calm. It also helps with falling asleep. I wish you peace in your mind and heart."

It'll stabilize your attention, and that stabilization can be transferred over to other techniques if you ever feel later like it's time to move on, or you found a path that fits you better that doesn't use the breath.   In other words, you wouldn't be 'starting over' if you use the breath and then switched up later, because the main parts of breath meditation usually build the qualities of mind that are needed for many other techniques.   Breath meditation is often the foundation or beginning part of other techniques because it's great, simple, and you don't have to be in any particular posture or location to breathe.

It feels nice and brings about healthy qualities of mind.   Your mind will get pulled away. I like Buddhist monk Henepola Gunaratana's technique for when you get distracted: turn your attention to the distraction, and silently note 1) what it is, 2) its intensity (very painful or loud, or is it soft but interesting and that's why you were distracted by it?) and 3) how long it lasts before it fades away.   Once you note those three things silently, turn gently back to the breath. Don't worry how many times you turn back and forth from the breath. The actual progress comes when you notice the distractedness (that's a moment of mindfulness) and then you turn back gently ( that's a moment of patient persistence).   Good luck!

Meditation,3dd91l,MrColecovision,4,Wed Jul 15 10:41:50 2015 UTC,"One of the things you get from meditation is that the idea that you are the active thinker that is doing the thinking isn't quite correct. There's definitely some part of the process that is going on behind the scenes that you aren't normally aware of.  Another thing meditation can teach you is that this entire process can be far more productive if you stop being judgemental about it. For example when you're mad with someone and your mind is full of more and more new reasons that this person is bad, ""Oh they were nasty to me that time"", ""They weren't polite when they asked me to do X"". If you play close, non-judgemental attention you can see that what you're doing it actively trying to find reasons to dislike the other person.  This is a habit just like any other, a habit you can break."

Meditation,3dd91l,jalanb,2,Wed Jul 15 17:29:20 2015 UTC,"When you're actually trying to return to the breath you notice that some thoughts are very sticky and loud and keep grabbing your attention. As long as you continue with the practise you're pretty much guaranteed to learn that some thoughts need a kind of non-judgemental attention before they'll go away.  Also when you're not formally meditating over time you get this sense of where your attention is and a slight handle on how to use it. For example you'll be in a situation that normally makes you angry but you'll notice the anger building and using the same non-judgemental attention on it makes it kind of melt away.  How this all filters into critical thinking is this, most of what you normally assume is critical thinking is actually rationalising against pre-chosen outcomes. If you can stop yourself being dragged around by that, the better quality critical thoughts will bubble up of themselves."
Meditation,3dd91l,naughty,2,Thu Jul 16 08:12:09 2015 UTC,"I understand that whenever thoughts arise I'm supposed to bring my focus back into the know usually done by redirecting the focus on to your breath.   Breath meditation is not 'instruction for thinking critically,' breath meditation is just one meditation instruction that can build a mind...one that's able to think critically —one that may be in whatever other mode of mind— with much less fog. This stuff is not about thinking itself, it's about that which is thinking — not the software, the hardware. But this change of emphasis doesn't mean that meditators throw all their critical-thinking skills out the window.   if I do this then, there is absolutely nothing.   You sure about that? Noticing nothing is one thing, assuming that 'there is' nothing is another. I may not notice anyone on the street right now, but that doesn't mean that I believe nobody exists on the street anywhere. The inner world has plenty going on, trust me. Don't jump to the conclusion that nothing's happening during meditation quite yet!   How could Siddhartha possibly come up with 4 truths and the 8 path without critical thinking?   I wouldn't jump from your 'non-insightful' experience noticing the breath to the founder of Buddhism's personal experience, as if he also must have not noticed anything the way you did. Give this process some time, let your mind sharpen, you'll notice a lot more as time goes on.   How do I gain personal insight?   You ever read something in a book and see it out in the world? It's like that but for your 'inner world.' The insight isn't just about forming thoughts...it's like you are looking at the stage and the actors (your day-to-day mood and thoughts) and haven't yet noticed what the backstage is, the stage itself is made of, and what everything else is made of.  Start small. Notice your breathing, notice the mind that is trying to do this exercise. Work with your frustration, that's part of the 'game:' you're not just breathing, you're noticing directly what it's like to want to do something and to have expectations fall apart second by second as your attention wanders and thoughts catch you over and over.   Is actively thinking considered being in the now?   Knowing that you're actively thinking right now, is considered being in the now. But if you look at anyone on their iPhone, we can tell that 'actively thinking about something' doesn't mean that they are being aware at the same time.   Is planning things ahead of time, and solving and preventing future issues doing mindfulness wrong?   No. Just know what you're doing while you're doing it. If you forget that, then you've lost mindfulness and 'gone into the future' the way we go into a daydream and forget where we actually are."

In general, I find that mindfulness, instead, enhances my own critical AND creative thinking by presenting the idea of perhaps. Essentially, I find I can take the space to consider the idea that ""perhaps"" something is good, bad, something other than we thought, and be open to it unfolding.  If it helps there is a really cool Buddhist story of ""maybe"" (sometimes the story of ""perhaps) that exemplifies what I mean.

Is actively thinking considered being in the now? Is planning things ahead of time, and solving and preventing future issues doing mindfulness wrong?   It all depends on your intention of doing so. From what you're saying right here it sounds like it's not a problem."
Meditation,3dd91l,Jollyranchr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:33:56 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of your confusion comes from the fact that we don't know exactly how the Buddha meditated.  He said alot about how to live ethically and the characteristics of enlightenment, but most meditation traditions that have survived to the modern day actually come from people who lived after the Buddha and independently worked out their own way to enlightenment.  Another point of confusion, which I believe somebody else in this thread brought up already, comes from the difference between experiential and conceptual understanding.  When you look up at the sky, for example, you could have all kinds of thoughts about what you are experiencing- labels such as ""blue"", ""vast"", or what have you.  That's all conceptual.  Or you could observe with bare attention and just see.  The very act of seeing, before the intrusion of thoughts, is experiential.  When Buddha came up with the four noble truths, he didn't arrive at them through thinking, and you don't have to either.  If you closely examine your moment-to-moment experience with bare attention you will eventually see phenomena constantly arising and passing away (hence impermanence) and the absence of any true self.  If anything, these characteristics of reality are most apparent before the arising of thought, not in the midst of it."
Meditation,3dd91l,jimjamjello,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:20:33 2015 UTC,"There are many many different types of mediation. Basic mindfulness meditation tends more to deal with just focusing on the breath or some other aspect, and less to with cognition. There are other forms of meditation that focus more on problem solving, using the imagination, and so on.  There is nothing wrong with using mediation to think, but as far as I'm aware, it is a lot harder to do. I've seen it recommended that you get really really good at the basics before doing thinking mediation.  I'm no expert in mediation, so take the opinions lightly.   I think that if you want to use mediation for problem solving and thinking, that you want to train in keeping your mind focused. I find that when I start thinking, my mind tends to go off into fifty different directions and starts bringing up every other problem I have to solve. As a result, I don't get much done.  The problem with thinking is that without sufficient practice in basic awareness, it is very very very easy to lose your train of thought or to be overwhelmed with hundreds of other thoughts. Though you may have success in going straight to thinking meditations, it may be analogous to jumping into a 5K without training.  Sometimes after a meditation, I don't really have this issue. It is like a state of cognitive flow, where I don't really get sidetracked into thousands of other thoughts. It is kind of like taking ritalin for the first time, where your train of thought rides so smoothly. But it isn't often that this happens."
Meditation,3dd91l,npepin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:36:16 2015 UTC,"But if I do this then, there is absolutely nothing. How could Siddhartha possibly come up with 4 truths and the 8 path without critical thinking? How do I gain personal insight?   Insight isn't a intellectual understanding, but a perceptual understanding. Once you have this perceptual insight, then you can use that to form intellectual ideas about those insights, just as the Buddha did. But it's worth noting that those ideas can never communicate that insight, in the same way that the word ""sweet"" doesn't communicate the actual taste of sweetness.   Labels can only point to things. If you're talking to someone who hasn't ever tasted something sweet, then it doesn't mean anything to the person you're saying it to, and the best you can do is tell them go eat something sweet.  It seems like a simple point, and intellectually it is, but most of us confuse our labels with the things they supposedly point to on a regular basis. Intellectually understanding that this confusion happens doesn't protect you from it. The Tao Te Ching thinks it's important enough to make it the very first thing it tackles: ""The Tao called the Tao is not the Tao.""  To give a real-world example, people often unconsciously judge fear as being somehow wrong, and therefore freak out when they're feeling fearful. If you gain insight into that, you will be able to perceptually distinguish between the fear and your judgement about it.   Based on this insight, you might tell someone else suffering from the same issue that their perception of fear is distorted because they've conflated it with a judgement. But even if they believe you, that doesn't stop them perceiving the fear and their judgement of it as a single thing. To reveal the hidden judgement they're making, they must perceptually investigate it for themselves.   Is actively thinking considered being in the now? Is planning things ahead of time, and solving and preventing future issues doing mindfulness wrong?   You are always in the now. The point is that you can get lost in ideas of the past and future. So you can actively think or plan ahead. The point of mindfulness is to be aware that that is what you're doing, rather than getting lost in the story that your thoughts tell."
Meditation,3dd91l,TastyPruno,0,Wed Jul 15 12:25:28 2015 UTC,First you quiet your mind by doing meditation. After the meditation session is over you can think about what ever you want and you won't be distracted by emotional impulses. Also by quieting your rational mind you might find some really good ideas coming from your intuitive mind.  Or you could try vipassana meditation where the techniques are not all about quieting the mind but involve examining mental phenomena.
Meditation,3dd91l,ringer54673,0,Wed Jul 15 11:10:02 2015 UTC,"Okay, this is complicated, so let me do my favorite thing and compare meditation to music. I'm going to abuse your post a little for that.  This is the part of piano practice that seriously confuses me. I understand that whenever I am distracted I'm supposed to bring my focus back into the now by concentrating on the process of playing my current piece.  But if I do this then, there is absolutely nothing. How could Beethoven possibly come up with whole pages of sheet music without critical thinking? How do I master music?  Is actively thinking about sheet music considered playing the piano? Is planning harmonies in your head, and solving and preventing issues when practicing the piano wrong?  That on its own might answer all questions.   I understand that whenever thoughts arise I'm supposed to bring my focus back into the know usually done by redirecting the focus on to your breath.   That is practice. It's the practical aspect.   How could Siddhartha possibly come up with 4 truths and the 8 path without critical thinking?   Who says good old Buddha came up with that without critical thinking? Piano time: You improvise. You listen to how what you play sounds. When it sounds good, you write it down as sheet music, so that other people can play that genius piece of music too.  It's basically what the Buddha did (even though it was all oral transmission in the beginning). He put the way to practical insight into a system that makes it easy for others to understand and follow.   How do I gain personal insight?   You mentioned the noble 8 fold path somewhere up there....   Is actively thinking considered being in the now?    Where else would you be? The problem is that we often don't consider it to be that, that we prefer ""thinking now"" to ""painful hip on the cushion now"", we stick to one over the other and... well, you know the rest.   Is planning things ahead of time, and solving and preventing future issues doing mindfulness wrong?   No. As long as you don't mistake solving issues for actual practice, it's fine."

If you meditate for a while, you may find you don't - they just arise and cease, and the control you think you have is simply an illusion.  As such, it comes down to where you focus your attention, time, and energy. Creativity and problem-solving don't come from thinking more, or continuing to be lost in thought.

Meditation,3db02q,throwawaybachelor23,27,Tue Jul 14 21:44:38 2015 UTC,"Having a dedicated meditation space and decorating it to be relaxing and pleasant is very helpful for practice.  That idea doesn't seem to resonate well in this sub for some reason, which is a shame because many good teachers advocate it. Yes you don't need any particular external conditions to meditate, but an environment that cultivates relaxation and peace is very helpful for practice. For some reason there seems to be an almost arrogance about it in this sub. ""Pfft.. I don't need anything to meditate, I can meditate wherever I want. You and your silly meditation space and ornaments...""  If you value Buddhist teachings, which I'm guessing you do to some extend if you practice mindfulness meditation that is taught by Buddha, in the scriptures it says go and meditate in a forest under a tree. It doesn't say go and meditate in some random spot.  Bottom line, the environment is a lot more important than it is given credit for in this sub. It is a shame and can be misleading for beginners."

I think these sort of 'crutches' may be helpful in the beginning but overtime aren't entirely necessary.  The OP said:   I get anxious easily in spaces that are cluttered or loud (since I was very young)   So, right now I think it's good he is creating this calm space.  He must work with where he is at -- this is okay.  The potential problem is if he becomes dependent on this calm space then he will not be able to be okay with sitting in what he considers chaotic environments.  His peace is dependent on peace and quiet but the peace he seeks shouldn't be dependent on having a calm space.    He is where he is at and he knows himself best and he will be the one choose what works best for him."
Meditation,3db02q,sirfartalot,5,Wed Jul 15 01:28:46 2015 UTC,"I get what you mean and it is good to have your attachments in check.   That said, don't forget that we are all attached to things. There is no way to become unattached to everything. That is not a reasonable or achievable goal.   he will not be able to be okay with sitting in what he considers chaotic environments   If you are so aversive to chaos and disorder that you get so agitated when you leave the safety of your house, yes that can be a problem.   But as far as which environment to meditate in your home, I don't think that's a huge problem. It is highly likely that he/she will always have some sort of a house or apartment and it is generally easy and possible to make it tidy and nice, and not chaotic.   There is also a way to embrace your attachments. People are attached to their bodies, their loved ones, homes, favorite food, activities etc. That shouldn't stop these things from enriching their lives.  What is bad about attachment is when you don't notice it, it stops you from enjoying these things. I think that is something we can agree on. So if you realize that you are attached to something, don't rush to get rid of it, which is aversion. Just notice the attachment and see if you can keep enjoying that thing.  So it is not non-attachment for the sake of non-attachment. It is non-attachment so that you can enjoy life more. And at that point, enjoying life is enjoying the very thing you are/were attached to."

If you look at any meditation center or temple you'll see that they pay tremendous amount attention to keeping it tidy, clean and calm.   People's homes need not become temples of course. But I would think that there is a good reason why these people who are really advanced in mindfulness practice don't ask the question of whether their peace is dependent on a calm and tidy environment."

If you have a difficult time following a schedule, don't set yourself up for failure. Just whenever you have an extra ten minutes or perhaps more if you're feeling up to it practice quieting your mind. A lama once told me that that it must be more important than using the restroom. ""If you have ten minutes to use the bathroom, then you have ten minutes to meditate! You must make meditation higher on your scale of importance"" he has a good sense of humor, lol.   As far as techniques go, if you really want to get into it pick up a meditation pillow, buckwheat filled usually provides solid support. Sit as a tripod in a half lotus, the balance points being your knees and spine. The idea is the balance your upper body on your spine like a J to minimize discomfort. If you feel extremities start to go numb, slightly shift to allow blood flow and return to your position. If you find yourself thinking about something, it is unnecessary to chide yourself. Just allow the thought to pass and refocus on your breathing or energy centers. Keep in mind, this is only a perspective not the end all be all of meditation. Meditation is a state of mind. :)"

Then there's The Ten Stages of Meditation, which will help you pace yourself.   Basically it boils down to this.    Sit with your back straight and unsupported.  The body is like a glass of water, and thoughts are like sediment. Motion stirs the sediment into the water. Be still, and the water will become clear.  Goal: to maintain undisturbed focus on a single point.  Strategy: Focus on a rhythmic point within yourself, the breath, the heart. Choose one point on which to focus all attention on. For instance the nose, where the breath first enters and leaves the body.  Obstacle: Thoughts will continuously distract you from achieving your goal. Don't be discouraged. As you begin your training, know that every time you catch yourself lost in thought you're doing the equivalent of a mental pushup.  The longer you sit, the better the results.  First step to master, sit every day. Doesn't matter how long it is.    This is the first stage. The second stage involves taking that ability to focus on a single point, and turning it towards your awareness of your surroundings."

Meditation,3dbrl9,abvavrg,8,Wed Jul 15 01:13:40 2015 UTC,"I bit the bullet and bought a one year subscription to Headspace. It's been worth it for me.  It has been the only app I've been able to stick with and I really do like the program and method.  The content is pretty good and you can pick and choose from a lot of different packs once you've completed the first 30 days (take 10, take 15, take 20) I just finished up the Anxiety pack which was good.  The technique used in that pack was noting which I found good for building mindfulness overall.  I'm sure it helped with my anxiety as well but I have used other meditation apps for anxiety which were more targeted  (specifically At Ease by Meditation Oasis).  I'm not sure which pack to try next so I'm going through the take 10, 15 and 20 packs again.    I've been meditating daily with Headspace for over 2 months and have really noticed a difference in my mood and stress level. I'm generally a lot more calm and content.  They have do have a month to month option if you want to continue to try without a year long commitment."
Meditation,3dbrl9,ladyjessop,2,Wed Jul 15 01:43:21 2015 UTC,"I was wondering if headspace was worth it. I don't have any income, so it is quite expensive for me. I've used the free trial and it helps me sleep at night. I do get startled if he stops talking and suddenly starts talking again though. The take10 trial was very similar to the grounding techniques I learned at counselling, but I was wondering if the content is significantly different from the trial or is it very similar? I am interested in the sleep meditations, but I wish I could sample it first. Any thoughts on the sleep ones?"
Meditation,3dbrl9,nanabeams,2,Thu Jul 16 02:00:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what grounding is but the paid portion of Headspace continues with more techniques like learning to note and observe your thoughts and emotions. I've only been through one pack besides the intro take 10, 15, 20 so I don't know what other techniques are used.  The take 15 and 20 packs help you meditate longer and also concentrate mostly on gently observing your thoughts and going back to your breathing.  You must complete these in order to have access to the rest of the packs.    They have a one off sleep meditation which you can use to help you go to sleep and also a 30 day sleep pack which introduces techniques you can use daily don't know what they are though because I haven't tried it yet.    Meditation Oasis, which I mentioned above, also has a sleep meditation app that I have used. It's not expensive, about $5 and you might like it. It has different techniques to help you fall asleep at night, soft music and sounds and also a meditation to use when you wake up and can't go back to sleep.    I actually do not have a lot of sleep issues but when I do have the occasional bout of insomnia sleep meditations don't help me because they just remind me I'm not sleeping.  :)  But that's just me...."

Meditation,3dbrl9,nopantsu,4,Sun Jul 19 06:00:47 2015 UTC,"Insight Timer is great and it has guided meditations, but it is not in any way structured. The app is more about community where you get a sense that you are meditating with people around the world. You can join groups and stuff. Its timer and bell sounds are also quite nice.  I have tried both Calm and Headspace in the past, and they can both work as a good starting point, but now I just use Insight Timer without any guide.  Headspace is probably the most structured of the guided meditations. However in the long run, I didn't fell all the extra ""courses"" added much more than the take 10 trial. Headspace has all kinds of courses focusing on various things like health, relationships or productivity, but to me it didn't really make sense to try put meditation into these sort of frames or focus.  Calm has some good basic guided meditations as well, but their more specialised topic focused ones didn't settle with me well either. Some of them are not really meditations in my opinion, but more like visualisation techniques to help you sleep for example."

Meditation,3dd8ro,TheHeartOfTuxes,2,Wed Jul 15 21:11:36 2015 UTC,"These kinds of questions have their answers within the various traditions of practice. If you practice with a teacher, you should ask your teacher. If you practice within a tradition, you should check with that tradition's instruction.  What you focus on, and why, determines the effect of your meditation. So you should be clear on that. What is your method and your reason for practicing meditation?  There are many different forms of meditation, with different purposes. Concentration-style tends to be the most commonly known. I can give a general response, but really you need to clear up the points I've mentioned above.  In many courses of training, if you are working on concentration with an object of focus you are expected to stay with that object. Work with some objects, like breath, can be adjusted to embrace pain or emotion. For example, you see how the breath changes with the feeling, and return to awareness of that quality of breath.  But when pain continually interrupts and distracts from a concentrative practice it is generally best to then use the pain as the main focus. There are various ways of doing this. If you work with sensation, as in some Vipassana methods, you can investigate the pain in the same way. This can be very liberating in itself — to see the empty and evanescent nature of all pain; and if you manage to unify with the sensation a great blissful comfort can be experienced.  Another method is to find the boundaries of the painful sensation. Try to find where the pain is, and where it is not, and sort of find a boundary line around it. This can sometimes help people who otherwise find the pain overwhelming, as they can see that it is limited and not their whole experience. If followed through this practice can also lead to the realization that pain is empty and ever-changing: you can't ever really pin it down; it's not one 'thing' but an always-moving collection of momentary flashes.  If the mind (or the pain distracting it) calms down enough, you can then resume your regular practice.  You might also look into the way posture can affect your experience of pain, and take care with what you wear during meditation (so you don't have things pressing on your belly). The approach to meditation itself should be very calm and joyful rather than stressed because you're hoping to get or avoid something; so take care of how you enter your practice. This will help settle the IBS.  One can shift from ""poor me, in pain"" to ""just this is also truth""."
Meditation,3dd8ro,TheHeartOfTuxes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:47:10 2015 UTC,"One can shift from ""poor me, in pain"" to ""just this is also truth"".   Sounds wise, but is extremely difficult to accomplish after days and days of pain/insomnia, and not noticing improvement with meditation. Again, that is not to say that I think this is the best attitude one can take.  At the moment I'm using the mindfulness of the breath technique, explained in this subreddit.    For example, you see how the breath changes with the feeling, and return to awareness of that quality of breath.   It's kind of trying to notice the breat when somebody is shouting in your ear. Now the strange thing is, and this is what makes me doubt the whole psychosomatic origin of the pain, is that the pain seems to exacerbate when I try investigating it. So much so, that at a certain point my natural tendency is to try blocking my ears, trying to escape the pain by getting up, and walking around or something.   The approach to meditation itself should be very calm and joyful rather than stressed because you're hoping to get or avoid something; so take care of how you enter your practice. This will help settle the IBS.   solid advice. Thank you!"
Meditation,3dd8ro,elphabaloves,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:45:28 2015 UTC,"I suggest acquiring a mala. A mala can be used as a support, and can help you keep the thread of mindfulness even in great pain. I know — I've practiced through tremendous migraines that have lasted for days, and have also practiced through flu and fever.  Practice with the mala is very simple. You can work it in time with the breath: one breath, one bead. The tactile feedback gives you more to go on, more to return to. At times when you are not working with the breath, you can just work the mala bead by bead, staying present or returning with each bead: just now... just now... just now... just now....  Any time during the day, you can access your mala and have a few moments of simplicity. No need to strategize or try to get anything. Only a simple moment. That is very good practice.  When you are racked in pain, even if you can't do anything else you can work a mala bead by bead. The bead becomes your object of concentration. You can turn your attention from other things (including the pain) and focus on each new bead. Let your life be completely there: just this bead, just now.  Later, when you are going about your day's activities, you can work the mala as a way to keep you anchored. In this case you don't focus only on the mala, but you use it in the background (perhaps in your pocket) as you're walking, riding the bus, watching TV, or talking with someone. It rhythmically keeps you more engaged with the present moment.  ~  Instead of thinking that 'just this is truth' is some kind of destination that you will arrive at if you get good enough (or lucky enough), start from this point. This is the point of your life; and this is the point of your meditation. Just this is truth. Breath is truth. Pain is truth. Thinking is truth. The real situation, as it is, is truth.  It is because we believe that there must be something else, something special, something that feels better, something that is more fancy, something that pleases us — it is only because we think this that the moment is insufficient. Actually, the moment is always enough. The moment is already truth. So this is where you start it is not some other place or state to get to.  This attitude is open-handed. It is the correct attitude for entering meditation. As-is.  Then, if you have pain, that is already your meditation situation. If your mind is agitated, that is already your meditation situation. Your task is to be present, unmoving. Neither to avoid what arises nor to try to hold it. Neither to add your own material to the way things are nor to subtract your awareness. You sit as the witness and let life flow around you, the whole universe swirling and unfolding in its own way.  If you think ""I can't, it's too painful"", that is the thinking that you add to the situation. You make ""I can't"". The situation doesn't make it. Actually, the pain is helping you to be present. It is very, very obvious. It brings you to the present moment. And if it is overwhelming, the pain encourages you to go to the place where the mind doesn't move.  If your mind moves and you start thinking about yourself, you encounter a lot of suffering. The more you think and struggle, the more you suffer. So pain encourages you to settle more deeply. Instead of saying that the pain makes it impossible for you to concentrate, you can legitimately say that concentration is a way toward ease. As you return to the object of concentration, you disengage with the pain. You give it less power; you give it less attention. The object of concentration becomes like a haven in a storm, an island in a tumultuous ocean, a cool oasis in a burning desert. This is one style of practice.  When you are driven by pain to deeply unify with your object of concentration, that is called Diamond Pain Samadhi. If you want to try this style, you must not give in to indulgence. Self-defeating thoughts are just thoughts. Your task is to let go of thoughts that appear, and return to the object. No thought, no matter how reasonable or lofty it seems is worthy of disengaging from your method. Only return to the object, without fail. If you keep this clear form of practice you will soon unify with the object and experience moments of bliss.  That is one style. It brings the mind to one point and lets go of all other points. It is not the only way."

Try Weil's 4-7-8 method - I know a few people who have gotten tremendous relief from it.  From a meditating perspective, you learn not to build stories around the pain that cause you to suffer more. It's not denying the pain, it's not ignoring the pain - it's refusing to let your thoughts and emotions about the pain lead you down a path that makes it a lot worse.  Do you meditate? I know several people who have successfully treated their IBS by building a consistent practice."

Meditation,3dd8ro,linqua,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:18:00 2015 UTC,"I hope that as you follow your doctor's advice you learn about the use of mindfulness and mindfulness meditation for chronic pain, which has been studied since Jon Kabat-Zinn began work with the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program at the Univ of Massachusetts Medical School in the 1980s.  Dr Kabat-Zinn and MBSR were the subject of a Time magazine cover article, ""The Mindful Revolution,"" in January, 2014.  The article says    477 scientific journal articles about mindfulness were published in 2012.   Studies show that MBSR can help people cope with pain and serious illnesses, such as cancer.  The program is available at hundreds of clinics across the US.  Also, there's an audiobook by Jon Kabat-Zinn specifically for chronic pain relief - Mindfulness Meditation for Pain Relief: Guided Practices for Reclaiming Your Body and Your Life - available at Amazon.    You can sample his guided mindfulness exercises on YouTube.  The Body Scan is popular.    Sometimes, there's a simple way to cope with pain - just calming down.  Slow. deep breathing is an effective way to calm down when you're agitated.  Psychologist Marsha Linehan, who designed the therapy program DBT, has specified a particular breathing method.  This is breathing slowly and deeply through the nostrils with a hand on the abdomen to feel it rise and fall - 4 seconds for the inhale and 6 seconds for the exhale.  Some people use a relaxation method like this before the start of a meditation session or mindfulness exercise.  A book on chronic pain for nurses might have ideas you'd find useful.  If your local library doesn't have one, you can search the catalog of a nearby college or university library, find a good title, and ask for an interlibrary loan at your local public library.  If they get federal money, they have to do this.  A book like that has stress reduction ideas like massage that can help people."
Meditation,3dd8ro,linqua,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:33:13 2015 UTC,"This is really interesting. Do you have personal experience with Dr Kabat-Zinn's methods? I'm curious to how it differs from 'traditional' meditation (such as the simple mindfulness of the breath method I'm using atm, or Vipassana or whatever)."
Meditation,3dd8ro,jstock23,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:47:42 2015 UTC,"I never took the 8-week MBSR course but I read the book in which he explains MBSR, Full Catastrophe Living, and used the audio CD that comes with a book he co-authored with the other designers of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy, The Mindful Way Through Depression.  As I understand it, MBCT, developed at the Univ of Oxford, is popular mainly in the UK, whereas MBSR - the program the Oxford program is based on - is very popular in the US.  That CD I think is sold separately with the title Mindfulness for Beginners.  I would say though that since Dr. Kabat-Zinn now has an audiobook specifically for pain management, that would be the logical choice for you.  It might be that after your experience with the pain management audiobook you'd have second thoughts about the 8-week course, which naturally costs a bit of money and might involve inconvenience, like driving to a clinic.  Kabat-Zinn says that he relied on his experience with his Korean Zen teacher in designing MBSR.  The difference between Zen and Vipassana is not clear to me, but I know that some Zen traditions have not adopted the idea of mindfulness in daily life, which is an important part of the Kabat-Zinn approach.  You will sometimes find a Zen teacher who says that mindfulness (or, ""Zazen"") is just for sitting meditation).  On the other hand, the Kabat-Zinn approach was greeted enthusiasticly by Zen teacher Thich Nhat Hanh, who wrote the Preface to Full Catastrophe Living.  I've seen mindfulness in daily life promoted in Vipassana literature.   An extensive review of studies (""The Effects of Mindfulness Meditation: A Meta-Analysis” by Eberth and Sedlmeier) suggests a significant difference between MBSR and courses that only teach mindfulness.  What accounts for the difference in effects, we don't know.  MBSR includes gentle-stretching yoga (rather like tai chi).  Presented to groups, it may have the dynamics of group therapy.  You can see this if you see the U of Mass Medical Center program ""How mindfulness can change your life"" on YouTube.  MBSR might be thought of as a kind of psychotherapy.  It's certainly not plain old relaxation.     I think the success of MBSR owes much to the person of Jon Kabat-Zinn, as a theoretician and as a teacher.  If you listen to YouTube audio of him guiding you through an exercise like the Body Scan, you'll know what I mean.  Anyone can tell you to concentrate on the heel of your left foot, but he does it artfully.  He has a gentle charisma that's perfectly suited for this."

Meditation,3da7oe,LarryBills,2,Wed Jul 15 16:13:05 2015 UTC,"I can't remember exactly but the sitting was followed by mindful walking for maybe 8-10 minutes on several different intersecting trails around the cabin. We walked single file and matching step so if you didn't pay attention it was easy to step on somebody feet.   It was good and disorientating how all the trails crossed which keep you awake I guess.   In my practice I just walk about 8 minute after 30 hour meditation. Hand over lower stomach and count 'left, right, turn.   Walking through your house is pretty distracting so you have a backyard trail do that.   Best of luck to you!

The best I have come up with is mindful walking, both hand over lower abdomen. Say left, right aloud as you walk. Make sure when you turn you lead with the same foot. Do that for 8 to 10 minutes and meditate on why it is harder to focus then sitting.  I find reading to be great! Zen mediation can get very dark and bleak at times and a related book can frame that relative suffering in context. I was re-reading ""zen mind, beginners mind' through out the retreat.   Other good ones are 'everyday zen' which is very user friendly, and ""the joy of living"" which studies zen from both a hands-on, and scientific neuroscience perspective. Also standing and reading is great when you knees need a break but you want to stay in zazen.  Go easy on yourself! You should do a intensive retreat but zen in not in your apartment, it's out your door, and you already know what you need to do. But do a retreat anyway."

I personally don't care for teachings where people do stuff like that, because the teacher doesn't know what to do when the student doesn't get it.

Sorry what I said earlier wasn't really based in the proper context!   all there is, is the present.    I dunno how a gong is supposed to be a representation of the all-encompassing present more than a snap of the finger, because they're both events that produce sound that appears to move in time, the snap is just a smaller and shorter version of the gong in that respect.   I guess you could get super metaphorical, and say that the present is 'eminating' time from the center outwards...kinda like, the gong seems to be like the sun sending out wavy patterns of energy from a center? I dunno though! I hope someone else knows better than I."

Meditation,3dabal,thatguyfromcanada,9,Tue Jul 14 20:40:47 2015 UTC,What a terrible attitude.
Meditation,3dabal,Aza1177,6,Tue Jul 14 20:59:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Nietzsche frequented brothels; Sartre had multiple relationships with women and men, Heidegger was an antisemite and a sexist, etc. Yet they all had profound ideas regarding consciousness, reality and self-modeling. People are fallible as are ideas. There's no ""bad"" or ""good"" fruit. There's just fruit. To worms, a rotten apple is ""good""."
Meditation,3dabal,Reincarnate26,3,Tue Jul 14 23:04:18 2015 UTC,"It's pseudo moralistic judgements of matters that are not your own that save you from critical thinking, a priori analysis and the firing of neurons. But don't worry, keep closing doors, it's you who will be left impoverished of any wisdom, for it is your attitude, not watts that repels learning and wisdom and quite honestly it's a little sick, like willingly putting your brain on life support."
Meditation,3dabal,Aza1177,4,Tue Jul 14 21:52:05 2015 UTC,"I would not try to figure out what Alan Watts says. He was a womanizer and died of alcoholism. A bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Sorry.   Logical Fallacy: Ad hominen attack. Your responding to an argument (Alan Watt's philosophy of consciousness) by attacking his character, not the content of the argument.  The great thing about ideas is that their truth value isn't changed by the people who repeat them.   Furthermore to defend Alan Watts, because I personally think the man was a brilliant lecturer, philosopher and entertainer, his ""womanizing"" may have been considered slightly ""taboo"" in the 1950's, but after 60 years of further sexual liberation that was just gaining steam around that time, his behavior would  be extremely common for a handsome, rich bachelor in today's modern society.   In the 1950s, being older and not settling down was kind of looked down on, and that combined with having multiple sexual partners was considered almost immoral. Now a days its almost the norm, and certainly not, in my opinion, wrong or suggestive of any general moral failing.  Alan Watts was a human being liked you or me. He wasn't a monk or a priest and didn't pretend to be, he made a point of referring to himself as a spirtual entertainer, telling students to NOT look at him as some sort of spiritual/philosophical authority believing everything he said, judging his message and argument for themselves  He liked having fun, which in the 1950s especially, and possibly even more so today, meant drinking and having sex. I also find those activities immensely enjoyable, and think if anything it has only deepened my understanding of others, the world and myself - it doesn't mean the man, or anyone else who likes to get drunk and have a lot of sex for that matter, isn't capable of brilliant philosophical insights."

Meditation,3dabal,Reincarnate26,2,Wed Jul 15 03:19:19 2015 UTC,"I would say that the character of a person colors their ideas, and even if the ideas themselves are good, they are just ideas and words, whereas those of a person of character, and in the spiritual world, of realization, whose life embodies the ideas, are full of life and power. For a person striving for higher life, reading living words are much preferable.  As to relative morality, changing with the times, this has no place in spiritual life. What Buddha said about morality still applies. Jesus and Krishna's teachings do not become ""out of date"" as ""wiser"" generations arise. And as a teacher of Buddhism, Watts should have known that.  Yes, he, and everyone says things which are true. Our words are a mixture of sugar and sand, and as Sri Ramakrishna said, one should take the sugar and leave the sand. But doesn't it make sense to read words where you have to do as little sifting as possible?"
Meditation,3dabal,OmYogi,3,Wed Jul 15 14:27:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah but Jesus didn't condemn the man for being a womanizer, you did, or more specifically people that lived 60 years ago. This is /r/meditation, not /r/Buddhism or /r/Christianity. So yes, your judgment of his ""immorality"" is completely relative and subjective... You're making the classical mistake that so many ""spiritually minded"" people do of confusing your own subjective viewpoint and opinions with those of the religious authority that you follow.  Regardless of his moral failings, the character of the person may color the ideas they come up with, but that ""color"" would be fully evident in the ideas themselves. It wouldn't be some hidden thing that would change the truth of it if found out after the fact.   Like you said, ""Love your neighbor"" may reflect some fundamental, non-relative morality. It doesn't matter if the first time a child hears those words are from his abusive alcoholic uncle, it doesn't make their moral or truth value any less true.   But doesn't it make sense to read words where you have to do as little sifting as possible?   And how is that different from intellectual laziness? Shouldn't you think for yourself?"

It's free online, and be sure to search for the FAQ and posture guide that go along with it. His book is a collection of techniques for mindfulness (being deeply aware of thoughts, feelings, sensations). And he describes a path to awakening, involving equanimity and sensory clarity.  He actually describes how to develop equanimity. It basically involves waiting for it, then becoming mindful of it. But you would get more out of reading the book than my description. It's pretty short, with a lot of repeated content (like a reference book)."
Meditation,3dc5s0,sleepycorn,2,Wed Jul 15 13:02:58 2015 UTC,"The more you think and strategize about how to develop equanimity the harder it will be to actually do it.  In open awareness meditation just come back to being with whatever is when you realize you are distracted. Just sit there. Even better, just wait. And be aware.  Paying attention to the random arising and passing away of background sounds (such as street noise) is a good way to get into the mindset of open awareness meditation."
Meditation,3dc5s0,lxl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:49:06 2015 UTC,"In regards to mindfulness, open awareness is more-so an attainment than a practice. It happens as a result of concentration.

Pick either a physical sensations (e.g: the rise and fall of the abdomen, the breath passing through the nose, the breath passing the tip of the nose, etc... ), a mental concept (""in"" and ""out"", or a point in space that the breath passes, or the process of the rising and falling of the abdomen, etc... ) or both.

Meditation,3d9u3x,Stiegleman,2,Wed Jul 15 03:52:03 2015 UTC,Could you please expand on your references to the noble truths?
Meditation,3d9u3x,Geovicsha,2,Wed Jul 15 01:55:35 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. The 4 noble truths:  1) Life has an inherent pain to it, a dissatisfaction that seems to be unavoidable. We will be separated from what we love, ""you can't always get what you want,"" and other forms of what they call ""suffering.""  2) There is a cause of that pain, and it is a natural reaction we all have, whenever a thought or feeling or sensory input of any kind arises: to mentally grab on and identify with that input and either ""I like it!"" or ""I don't like it!"" (or even just ""I am experiencing this!"") It's all downhill from there. (Oh btw, that whole thing is what Buddhists call ""craving,"" though I don't think it's an ideal translation for what's really happening... It's more like ""mentally tensing up and identifying with, but that doesn't sound as good :-))   3) Just as craving causes suffering, if you don't crave you won't suffer. (Hmm, how do we not identify with those inputs and crave, if it's such a natural reaction?)... (wait for it...)   4) The way to stop craving is by learning ""the eightfold path,"" the details of which I'm not going to lay out here.. but is basically a way of summing up the Buddha's teachings on calming the mind to the point that you can see how this craving thing happens so quickly.. And what it actually feels like.. And how simple it actually is to not do it, once you see it up close. Just like a musical instrument, practice an hour a day and you get pretty good at it. (hint: relaxing mental tension is a big part of it!)   Make sense? Lemme know if questions!"

Close your eyes. Focus on something that is real (i.e. that is not being invented by your mind). Most people use their breath. I use the sounds around me. When your attention strays and you start thinking along the lines of ""He-said-she-said"", recognise that your attention has strayed and go back to focusing on the real things that are actually happeniong here and now. When you've had enough, get up and carry on with your life. Do daily.   Can anyone show me scientifically proven merits of mindfulness meditation?    What would that help? Meditation is about direct experience, not about double blind random control trials. Try it and see. If it works, great. If it doesn't, what point is it trotting out a whole load of journal articles (most of which probably would fall short of the Golden Standard)."
Meditation,3daqk7,HarshaKarpos,2,Wed Jul 15 05:59:54 2015 UTC,"I can't say if meditation will help you.

When a thought or a fantasy or an internal dialogue comes up, just notice that you are aware of it. When they pass, notice that you are aware of the breath.

Guided is alright, but it's a lot like you're talking with someone and their voice is essentially 'thoughts', like the commentary in your head saying 'OK so now our attention is gonna move to our feet, now our knees, now our breath...' but in full silence you're realizing that the voice never learned to be quiet: 'now our feet, now this, now that, commentary about this, i like that, i don't like this' has gone right on, you're just aware of it now that it has nothing to work with and you're there with it. Give yourself some credit, you've been doing one thing for 17.5 months, and now you've changed for 0.5 months (2 weeks), so there's going to be an adjustment period.   Just wondering if this was something anyone else has experience and whether it will tame itself with time and practice? I feel very out of control of my practice at the moment.   It's totally normal. Whenever you switch things up there will often be a rough patch. The longer you've been sticking with something, the more uncomfortable it may feel to give it up. You'll be fine. Just be gentle with yourself.   Most of the pain during adjustment is the self-hatred that comes when we're 'failing' at it: 'Goddammit, I was so focused before, now I'm a mess! What the hell! Just pay attention, idiot!' That desire to discipline ourselves harshly needs to be balanced with gentleness.   I can focus on sitting in that blankness AND focusing on my breath   That may feel comfortable for now, but it's a disaster if you're trying to get centered and reach that ...zero..point? At most, do one after the other, or spend time relaxing the facial muscles and other signs of tension before the breath-meditation, maybe do the wave-thing before then the breath after. But your attention's not REALLY going to gather if you're doing that simultaneous stuff.  Just stick with your breath, be gentle, but be peristent — patience, do it smilingly. It's inevitable that the benefits will come if you keep with it and don't beat yourself up, just continue: 'Ah, my mind has wandered away. Back we go. And now my mind is split and thinking. Back we go. Ah, I can't focus at all. Try my best to anchor, back we go.'  Good luck!  By the way...what is 'zero point?' It's not even in urban dictionary."

You might have become dependent on guided meditation and will need to learn how to allow the mind to come to rest on its own.  Keep at it.  The noise eventually calms down.  Don't worry about the split awareness.  If you watch closely you'll notice all of the various senses (including the sense of mind) are all dancing with each other with no real center point.  Everything is dancing with everything.  You are the witnessing of what is happening.  You are not the center.  Try to follow the sensation of the breath like you are tracing a fine line.  Notice the subtle sensations of the inhale, pause and exhale.  Don't ""concentrate"".  Simply focus on the awareness of what is happening.  Good luck!"
Meditation,3dbtd2,Gojeezy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:24:42 2015 UTC,"It's almost like a have a ""thinking"" mind, that is occupied with the breathing, and a ""fantasy mind"" which still runs rampant visualizing things.   That just means you do not have very well developed concentration.   What I've noticed happening is that I can be 100% focused on my breathing but my mind can be thinking at the same time   Bluntly, no you can't. To be focused 100% on breathing means (to me implies single-pointed concentration) that your mind would not be wandering. With that said, concentration takes effort. It takes effort to apply the mind to a single sensations and to sustain singular focus on that object.  In this way, the practice in and of itself is not necessarily calming. It is the result of the practice, concentration, that results in a tranquil abiding.  Some people strain very hard (some even too hard) to achieve concentration . . . . The buddha said, if all else fails beat thoughts into submission like a strong man beating a weaker man.   Once here, I can focus on sitting in that blankness AND focusing on my breath,   Maybe focus on your forehead instead of the breath until you calm your mind. Then switch over to observing the breath. By focusing on both you are not developing single-pointed concentration; which is required for insight practice.  Focusing on the forehead until the mind is blank is concentration. Then switching to watch the abdomen rise and fall (arise and pass away) means you are developing insight.  With enough practice you should be able to focus just on an aspect of the breath, i.e.,  a single sensation in regards to it and develop concentration that way.  Mindfulness of breathing:   Focus on the breath.   A. Pick either a physical sensations (e.g: the rise and fall of the abdomen, the breath passing through the nose, the breath passing the tip of the nose, etc... ), a mental concept (""in"" and ""out"", or a point in space that the breath passes, or the process of the rising and falling of the abdomen, etc... ) or both.

For example: if these are things that you feel you need to do, that you can do, but you're still not doing them, then I think it comes down to why are not doing them, and your acceptance of that explanation/excuse.  I'm can be a pretty heavy procrastinator quite often, and it's something that can really bother me at times. I see these things that I think I should be doing, watch them float by, as I choose to not do them. Before, during and afterwards, it can cause many negative thoughts and emotions that trouble me as I allow this to happen.  I have watched the result of my inaction many times, and it has sometimes caused me great suffering, and yet still I do it.  Perhaps I'm rambling a bit here, but it comes down to one's expectations, and one's perspective.   I may be very happy to do nothing at all, and procrastinate indefinitely. Some people do this and lead relatively happy lives. I may be very happy to do everything that springs to mind, and jump at each opportunity. Some people do this and lead relatively happy lives.   It's up to each individual to decide what is important to them in the present, and what will be important in the future, so that they may prepare for it. Most importantly, though, one must learn to be satisfied with the choices one makes, and not revisit mistakes made in the past, wallowing in regret, or worry about the future, shaking with anxiety.  ...  Even if this has diverged a little from the original subject, or doesn't make any sense to anyone else, I'm going to leave it here.

Meditation,3d57vr,-Pelvis-,3,Tue Jul 14 06:08:30 2015 UTC,Negative thoughts will always arise. The key is not identifying with your negative thoughts. You can observe them as they arise and pass without letting them consume you. Zen masters get angry thoughts. It happens. But only the unaware are ruled by the many passing thoughts that come and go. When you watch your thoughts you see that they just pop up randomly. Many emotions. Many thoughts. Then they pass.

How can you be something that is temporary? That comes and goes?   I think I'm something that is temporary.

For the sake of coarse transactions like traveling or something, we say 'cross that river,' but the river is ultimately a complex flux of things with no true essence or identity.   I accept that I'm like that. Maybe it's not uplifting to some to live without an eternal or solid, discernible essence—but to me, experiences and life are that much more precious because of existence's fleeting and unique, conditional nature:   Before saying a word, [Buddhist monk Ajahn Chah] motioned to a glass at his side. “Do you see this glass?” he asked us. “I love this glass. It holds the water admirably. When the sun shines on it, it reflects the light beautifully. When I tap it, it has a lovely ring. Yet for me, this glass is already broken. When the wind knocks it over or my elbow knocks it off the shelf and it falls to the ground and shatters, I say, ‘Of course.’ But when I understand that this glass is already broken, every minute with it is precious.”"

I know this sounds like it's not what meditation is about, as this involves not being in a current moment for a while. But when you know you have skills to return to a current moment at any time and let go of thoughts, you won't be lost in your wandering mind.

So let's say you are just hanging out and randomly a sad thought or an intrusive thought comes do you just observe it? Do you ignore it? What do you think about the YouTube video Elliot hulse - destroy negative thoughts? (If you seen it)   This really depends on the person having the thought but there are a couple approaches. One approach is the meditation style of recognizing the thought as just a thought and letting it go. For a beginner this is pretty hard to fathom much less do. For me I have been meditating and studying for about a year and while I can understand this as a video approach, depending on the particular thought I may or may not try to let go, and may go with a second technique.   I've suffered some nasty bouts of depression and this is a cognitive behavior technique I learned to help dig myself out: The second technique is more geared towards automatic thought. When a self deprecating thought comes, I recognize it, and then talk back to it. So I may think ""wow I am such a loser because I did not get  much work done today"". With practice, I can catch this thought as automatic, and then respond with ""that doesn't make any sense, I had a lot of meetings yesterday and I could not help getting much work done"".     How about feelings? If you wake up in the morning let's say confused and stressed and anxious do you just try to ""man up"" or do you just breathe and go?   I would say that for everyone, dealing with these things is different. For me, I'm getting better at recognizing anxiety feelings and thoughts. I actually use a combination of the two options. Life doesn't stop because you're thinking too much, so on one hand you need to ""man up"" and go about your day, and on the other you need to calm yourself down. The best way I've seen to really bring down the chest feelings of anxiety is to focus your awareness directly on the feeling (this comes from Eckhart Tolle). It is very effective.    I mean basically you don't control what you think just how you react to what you think?   This is pretty spot on. Your mind produces thoughts, that's it's job. Through meditation and study we can learn to detach from the stream of thoughts, to train the mind into realizing that there really isn't as much to think about. We can begin to use the mind instead of the mind using us.    How do you known what's the best way to self talk?   Self talk isn't too complicated, it's mostly a rationalizing away of the irrational anxiety. A really good book on this is called Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy.   Hope this  helps."
Meditation,3d57vr,withoutclass,2,Tue Jul 14 12:32:39 2015 UTC,"So let's say you lost $20 fee out of your pocket   Do you say ""at least I didn't least $100"" whew   I think the point is that you don't need to say anything at all. When people lose a little money, it's probably precisely because they're saying things to themselves that they're getting upset over an inconsequential loss.  This point remains true even if we switch to a more extreme example, like the death of a loved one. If someone close to you dies, it is natural to experience sadness, but making judgements about that sadness generally tends to make things worse. People commonly try to push away such sadness, because they've judged it as too much or as somehow wrong, and that means they never truly mourn their loved one and carry around that sadness for years. There is no overcoming such a loss, but you can learn to abide in such feelings.  This story from the Dalai Lama is instructive. An old monk asked him for advice, and the Dalai Lama suggested something that had the unintentional result of the monk committing suicide: ""So the Dalai Lama was left with regret that he had unintentionally nevertheless been responsible for this man’s death, this man’s suicide. The interviewer was stopped in his tracks and he said, “Oh my goodness, how did you ever get rid of that feeling?” The Dalai Lama paused for quite a long time and he thought about that and then he said, “I didn’t. It’s still there. I just don’t allow it to drag me down and pull me back. I realized that being dragged down or held back by it would be to no one’s benefit…not mine or anybody else’s so I go forward and do the best I can.” We have this idea that we either have it or we get rid of it and the question came from that point of view. But there’s an ability to be pierced to the heart by the sorrow of the world and your own regrets without it dragging you down."""
Meditation,3d57vr,TastyPruno,2,Mon Jul 13 19:19:13 2015 UTC,"This Dalai Lama story includes the second half that most people don't include when they respond to these things.  The humanity of it all.

Instead, meditation teaches you that you don't have to get caught up in those thoughts - you don't have to identify with them, or follow them down a path that leads to conditioned behavior and outcomes.

Meditation,3d57vr,pjaall,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:23:38 2015 UTC,"Valid point.  However, your friend can still choose to be happy. Relating this way to thoughts about the rape can then be a way to let go of the bad experience, and enjoy life right now. She is not responsible for the rape, and in a better world, the rape would never have happened. But she can still choose to be happy even though it has happened. If she can see thoughts for what they are - thoughts - she can find more peace of mind.  Of course she can still press charges to the perpetrator, or take measures to protect herself. The point is merely that a bad situation doesn't make you unhappy. Only your thoughts about it."
Meditation,3d57vr,Audioverstaerker,0,Tue Jul 14 14:10:07 2015 UTC,"I think that's not true, you can't always choose to be happy. The chemistry and hormones in your body and especially in the brain have a big say in it. By meditation and zen you can calm the mind and you can direct it in certain ways, but that doesn't always allow you to choose your emotions from a list or something, that's just overblown bullshit.  If you could just always choose to be happy clinical depression wouldn't be a thing, or PMS or other cases where your emotions go crazy.  Not to mention she has serious mental problems now especially since it happened in her childhood... You can't just make mental illness go away by meditating, it's not that easy sadly."

This has been shown repeatedly in the study of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, which was has been used to treat pain since the 1980s.  There is a mindfulness-based therapy for people with psychological problems called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, which is based on a very simple principle - people troubled by, for example, extreme anger, should observe their thoughts.  While this may not be the best way to deal with behavior problems, it does help with feelings that trouble people.    If someone asked me if I'd recommend mindfulness or morphine for people suffering from severe pain, such as that from a passing a kidney stone, I'd say go for the morphine.  On the other hand, some people might be able to use both.  Also, the question of how much we can benefit from practice is interesting."

That unhappiness—that extremely horrifying experience—has nothing to do w/ the thoughts of the matter. In fact, the thinking brain has nearly shut down in the quest for survival.   The reason this small child is unhappy is because it hurts, really bad, and there's bleeding and bad smells and forces she or he cannot fight against.  Until we grow our practices to encompass everyone, we are just idly giving ourselves jollies with thoughts like this."

Meditation,3d8rbn,R0bbleX,13,Tue Jul 14 11:38:37 2015 UTC,"Cold bath? That must've sucked.   Make yourself comfortable. Sit. Close your eyes. Follow your breath. You could follow the in breath for 10 minutes, then the out breath for 10 minutes, then think about your whole body breathing. Or just follow your breath.   The act of meditation is taking your focus off of everything and anything going on in your head, and bringing it back to your breath. Every time you do that, you're doing meditation.   While you meditate, try to be very still, don't move or stretch. If you become uncomfortable, try leaning into it like it is comfortable (without moving too much). It can really help. Your head should feel like it's trying to float up, that'll help keep your back and neck straight.   During meditation you'll either plan forward, or reminisce backwards. It could either be hyper focused, and after your meditation you'll have a clear idea of what you were thinking about, or it'll just be about nothing in particular and you can't quite remember what you were thinking about.   Leave all that behind. You don't need to think about that. It can wait. Find the middle area, your centre, and allow yourself, be kind enough to yourself, to focus on just that.   The more you do it, and the longer you do it for (in terms of years practicing and how long you sit for) will help. I saw a real impact within just a few days, and since then I've made so many gains I can't imagine my life without meditation.   Get stuck? Ask for help. Something weird happen? Ask for help. We are a digital sangha and all meditating like crazy. I've had weird brain orgasms, felt like someone was touching my face and correcting my posture for me, and felt 100ft tall whilst meditating. It's all part and parcel, the main thing to do is sit down and meditate every day through it all."

Meditation is bringing your focus back to your breath.   I started counting my breaths in daily life, especially when I was nervous or something.   Basically, meditation will help you know what is happening in your mind and body. You notice the subtleties of them both. I get anxious, and I'd end up feeling really bad and not knowing where it started, why, or how long I had felt like that. Because I wasn't paying attention.   I find it hard to explain it all. It really affects your whole life in such a positive way. And it happens over time. If you speak to ten different people who meditate they'll all be thinking about different things and give you a different answer. But that's because we all come from different places and practice differently.   Whatever you do, just sit every day. Just do it. No excuses. And at night if you can.   It helps you stop judging every moment. It just is. No big deal. Makes it easier to accept things you can't control. You'll start being a better person. I don't really drink anymore, eat far more vegetarian food. I'm happier, friendlier, funnier (obvs).   I have heard it described like masturbation.

Be aware of everything that is happening inside you and outside you.

Meditation,3d8rbn,Gojeezy,5,Tue Jul 14 22:25:54 2015 UTC,"These will help.   Practice Deep Circular Breathing. In very deep and slow through the nose, out very deep and slow through the mouth. Make it a point to strive for a number of times you do this, I like 10 but during times of heightened anxiety, I choose 20.  As you inhale, relax and allow yourself to calm, as you breathe out, imagine stressful and anxious thoughts exiting through your breath. Focus on the breath, not on the thoughts. This will be exceptionally hard to do and takes many people a long time to master. You will find that you can only focus on the breath for very short periods of time, sometimes only seconds. Focusing on the breath brings you into the moment and your mind will fight this, especially if you are trained to live in the past or the future. If a thought enters your mind, don't let it break your calm. Lightly smile at the thought and allow it to go like a puppy that came for attention gently shoo it so you can get some work done. As your body relaxes, you can try imagining your energy expanding into a vibrational cocoon protecting you as you begin to heal yourself. You may feel as if you are becoming comfortably paralyzed, go with it and allow yourself to love the moment. If you are having a hard time maintaining a brainwave frequency, try binaural beats. There are a number freely available on youtube. Try different ones because some are not pleasant to listen to and some are better. They are scientifically proven to put your brain in the right brainwave frequencies for meditation, so long as you wear headphones. Try to always meditate in the same place and love that place. Love everything about it. Charge it with your love energy and eventually it will become a comfortable retreat that you look forward to going to. Invest in a good meditation mat or bench(if you aren't that flexible). Some anxiety can be made worse if you can't get comfortable. I recommend a zabuton and zafu combination or a pi bench with a bench cushion if you find that crosslegs is painful. You will find that you will quickly feel so good that you 'don't need meditation anymore' and that is great! Good for you for feeling so great. But don't stop meditating. You will find that if you do, soon you will be needing meditation again. It is good to maintain a schedule so that you can keep your vibration right for growth. Be easy on yourself. Don't beat yourself up. There is no right way to meditate, only ways that have proven more effective. Find your own rhythm and you will do fine.   Source: I have been meditating for about 8 years."

It's like lifting weights--""pick up heavy things"" is okay advice, but it's not really good advice. For that, you need to find more thorough instruction.  One note that I can mention: feeling ""zoned out"" may be what one author termed ""sinking"", where you become more distant from everything, including the thing you're trying to pay attention to. This is something to be avoided. If it happens, renew your focus.  Also, I like the idea of a lukewarm bath, if it'll keep you from falling asleep.

One thing I heard from a teacher that you might want to think about is that it seems to take people a week to know whether a given technique is working for them. So when you try something new or make a change, stick with it for at least a week, if you want to really know whether it suits you.

Each technique has a lot more to it than meets the eye, things which can bring you 'the same' benefits as other techniques if you take the time to master those features of the technique.   If you are starting out, it may seem reasonable to take on several techniques because each technique seems to have their own peculiar strengths. But getting really familiar with one of them can be sufficient, and if you wanted to branch out later, you would have a great experiential understanding of the universal principles of meditation that apply across techniques."
Meditation,3d8tl8,Sampajanna,2,Tue Jul 14 13:50:54 2015 UTC,"I second this. I would add that each of those techniques do not exclude the other. You can do zazen/mindfulness by the morning, and then mindfulness/zazen by the night. Or dedicate a week to one and another week to the other, or whatever suits you good. But becoming good at each of them might take you farther than continuing an eclectic method. Besides, I'd suggest you to take a look at this.

How will it affect other areas of your life? i.e. more focus helps get work done, or helps you enjoy being in the moment with a loved one (where it didn't before)  If you are getting what you want, then what you are doing is perfect for you. It's more important to pay attention to your results. People get so caught up in the idea there is a perfect way to meditate. Be okay with each progression and celebrate when you do meditate. That turns into habit. Nitpicking at it, turns into habit as well. :P :)  However, choose one method and stick it out long enough to notice a result. It's also a good idea to have a real mentor. You mentioned zazen so I'm assuming you learned this from a temple or a practitioner. Go to them for advice as well.   Also, questions plants more seeds in the mind. The mind needs to be asked the right question that lead you into the direction you want to go towards. Here's a better question, how can I achieve (intention goes here) with this meditation so that it can create (more intentions goes here ie. happiness, joy, focus) in my life?   Does this help?

Here's shift in thinking when defining ""social anxiety"", as taught to me by a very humble Hawaiian Shaman who likes to state things in plain english.  Anxiety - is the signal from your unconscious mind that you're focusing on what you don't want. Therefore, gently bring your attention back to the present to what you DO WANT. Or focus on something the makes you feel something positive, lol. Pattern interrupts help, like looking up puppy or kitten videos. Just giving you options.  Meditation is a learned behavior. It's a muscle that will develop over time if you work at it. Learn to love the journey.   Have a good night."
Meditation,3d97vs,SilentToasterRave,3,Tue Jul 14 14:15:27 2015 UTC,"I'll offer two related pieces of advice, one related to the physical and one to the mental.  Physical first: Make sure your sitting posture is correct. You should be like a tripod, with the knees and your butt equally holding your weight. Secondly, the hips should be slightly elevated so that your pelvis and coccyx bone can be in a straight line, so that the lower back is straightish (I say -ish because the spine has a natural ""S"" curve that we wish to preserve; we don't wanna be like a rigid solider while meditating). As for the head, I've found this simple adjustment to be really awesome: Tuck your chin down, like you are holding an orange between your chin and chest. Next, move your neck back, so that the top of the chest becomes more open. Now heres a weird thing I've found, by relaxing the tongue and the throat, it helps to make the upper chest/lower neck more relaxed. Finally, relax that jaw. So much psychological tension manifests here, so relaxing the jaw is a great way to relax the face. Lastly, bring mindfulness to the crown of the head, I've found when I do this, it is almost if a little string pulls me up and straightens out my whole back.   Next, the mental: As regards trying to hard and head tension, I believe you are on to something. I've found, and I've heard many teachers say, that too much effort can create head tension. The Buddha said our effort in meditation should be like tuning the string of a guitar: if we are too slack, no music. If we are too tense, no music. WE have to find that ""Goldilocks zone"", called by the Buddha ""Right Effort"" (A factor of the Noble Eightfold Path). It's really hard to find! And is something that is a life long practice to achieve. When we are trying to concentrate on the meditation subject, the forehead sometimes crinkles (like when we are thinking really hard), the jaw gets tense, and the face in general gets tight. Head aches for meditators are actually extremely common, and it is something that everyone has to deal with at some point; its perfectly natural, and I think is a good sign that you are putting forth a lot of effort!   But, for real, the same piece of advice applies to this head tension as applies to every problem in meditation: just be mindful of it. Ask yourself: when does the head get tense? What thoughts or emotions immediately preceded or coincide with this jaw/face clenching? How do I react to it?; with aversion? suffering? wanting it to go away? I believe you will find that asking these questions, not in a philosophical way but in terms of actually experience, you will become more open to investigating this as just another phenomena. If you are able to maintain a clear, non-judgemental awareness of the tension, and note it as pain and discomfort etc., you will find that eventually this tension will soften and disappear, and a whole new energy will enter into you, that was previously trapped in the tension. However, even if you relax it once, twice, a hundred times, it will probably return! Do not fear, this is part of the mediatiors journey. Head tension can be a great way to gain insight into how mind and body condition each other, and how are thoughts manifest on a phsyical level, and how our physical condition effects our mental states. Mind and body are not as separate as we think.   Hope you find something here helpful. Metta."

Meditation,3d97vs,Gojeezy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:51:04 2015 UTC,"Head pain can be a result of one-pointed concentration. Try adding some samatha to your vipassana (i.e. relax more). Check some talks by Bhante Vimalaramsi, he teaches this really well."
Meditation,3dbjdl,icecreamcon3,2,Wed Jul 15 00:09:56 2015 UTC,"Thats pretty common I'd say.  My advice would be to start with metta or kindness/goodwill mediation toward yourself and others. Traditionally compassion is the second aspect of the brahma-viharas. But here are some resources on compassion that may help, from Tibetan tradition but feel free to find others as well: http://thubtenchodron.org/buddhist-approach/02-handling-emotions/04-compassion/"
Meditation,3dbjdl,technologia,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:11:29 2015 UTC,"Could you explain the difference between metta and compassion, i thought they were basically the same? Where you think of a friend and then a stranger and then an enemy and try to feel compassion for any struggles they may go through."
Meditation,3dbjdl,technologia,2,Wed Jul 15 01:18:03 2015 UTC,"For example, here are the definitions from the site I linked:  metta: Wish beings happiness and its causes. (aka Kindness) http://thubtenchodron.org/2002/04/cultivating-goodwill/  compassion: Wish to allay suffering of beings. (aka sympathy)  they are closely related, but goodwill is the basic attitude compassion comes out of Id say."
Meditation,3dbjdl,Gojeezy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:39:00 2015 UTC,"I find it hard to feel any emotions is this normal?   Well it is not abnormal. I used to be full of so much hate that metta meditation was a big joke (not a funny one either) to me.  With well enough developed concentration you will have a tranquil abiding and at least make room for developing love and compassion. With even more concentration love will arise on its own.  In any case, metta is still a good practice even if you do not feel it. Not wanting to practice because you do not have a skill is a good way to never develop the skill."

Don't expect too much, because no matter what anyone has told you, those ten days are going to be very much your own. There are a lot of parallels between peoples' experiences, but the experience of those ten days for you will be singular.  My favorite part of each night is Goenka's discourses. So good."
Meditation,3d7t2p,Sampajanna,2,Tue Jul 14 05:22:02 2015 UTC,Goenka's discourses? what's that?
Meditation,3d7t2p,roundm3,2,Tue Jul 14 05:35:15 2015 UTC,"At the end of each day you get to watch (at least we did) a video of Goenka giving a discourse to a Vipassana group. Essentially he sums up the experience of that day, gives some theory background regarding the technique, and makes a lot of observations, lighthearted and otherwise, about the practice and the dhamma."
Meditation,3d7t2p,atomused,2,Tue Jul 14 12:33:23 2015 UTC,"discourses   YES! Goenka's voice will be in my head forever. Here are my greatest-hits:   ""What we are doing?"" ""Maaadness!...MAD fellow..."" ""NOTHING DOING!"""
Meditation,3d7t2p,atomused,2,Tue Jul 14 06:14:47 2015 UTC,"""crying, crying, crying..."" ""What is wrong with you? Do you have eyes or buttonholes?""  His voice truly lifted me up at the end of each day. But it's a several thousand year tradition, and I feel like anyone with experience teaching the technique realizes there are things that can bring closure when said on certain days. His voice is striking and he is charismatic and the discourses were always like a tonic to the difficulties of the day. Laughing with your fellow meditatiors was always very relieving."
Meditation,3d7t2p,atomused,2,Tue Jul 14 12:32:07 2015 UTC,"Well-said. Also, I was amazed by how well the discourses predicted the moods of the students [like on days two and six especially]!  His voice and sense of humor really were just what we needed to hear at the end of the day."
Meditation,3d7t2p,qret,2,Tue Jul 14 12:35:22 2015 UTC,"The discourses were also a great example of how easy it is to fall into secularism. This whole experience is very deep and difficult for a lot of people; you feel vulnerable, and along comes Goenka with his wisdom and charisma and voice, and he gives you something understandable and relatable and tangible at the end of a long and difficult day. He is very lovable and makes you feel human. He makes you want to be a part of what he is describing. That's the power of the thousand of years of lineage of the technique.   I'm not saying I don't love him or the technique either. I just realize that the structure of ten days of silent meditation is a powerful way of breaking down barriers and making you feel very open and vulnerable, and the reason it spread is because Goenka himself has a power of personality that makes him so irresistible."

Meditation,3d7t2p,therealmrfish,3,Tue Jul 14 18:44:37 2015 UTC,"did you get a hang on your thoughts? i mean the voice inside the head, did it go silent?"
Meditation,3d7t2p,therealmrfish,8,Tue Jul 14 04:47:25 2015 UTC,"WOW actually not silent, no! But it was a huge thing.  Day 3 I was very frustrated with Anapana and having a recurring issue of hypnagogic imagery luring me almost to sleep, and having to abruptly straighten myself up! There was a negative voice in my head and I finally started to see it as separate from my self, realizing that I have little to no control over it. I decided to just accept its presence, because if it frustrated me that was some kind of reaction. I could observe it. I could NOT for some reason observe sensation on my obviously senseless upper lip. So I fed it things to say things I say to myself every day, and more, the worst things I could tell myself. (your friends don't even like you, you can't do anything right, you're worthless etc) And after a while they all started to seem absurd and almost laughable.   I think it was a really important moment for me. After that the voice slowly got easier and easier to identify. Sometimes the voice of Goenka would argue against it (did i go crazy?) and later it was nearly quiet. I really felt I experienced a quiet mind for the first time in a very long time. Still I would have thought reactions to things but it was easier not to follow them down the rabbit hole."

Meditation,3d7t2p,atomused,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:57:20 2015 UTC,"There was a lot more pain before we started practicing the actual Vipassana technique. The technique helped me perceive the sensations differently. Also around the sixth day or so I finally came upon what I deemed my favorite way to sit, and the experimenting between sitting postures and props often led to uncomfortable results.   FYI my fave way to sit was on my round zafu, turned on its side. I would sit on it like a saddle with my shins on my floor and the top of my foot just beyond the edge of the foam square mat under me.  There were rest periods where you were free to walk around the grounds, but no set walking meditation periods. You could also walk and meditate during optional meditation periods (meditate in the hall or in your room at your/the teacher's discretion) but you were encouraged to meditate indoors focus on the practice on its own."

Very difficult at some points, but I feel I learned some valuable things about myself and about how I react to things. Coming back afterwards is a huge learning experience for me because life in general is not like those ten days.   I had ups and downs every day. The food was really tasty. I got used to not eating in the evenings pretty quickly. The grounds were beautiful, and all the servers were aweseome.   It was a bilingual retreat and the teacher did not speak much English. I can speak French but I have not practiced in a long time. because of that I didn't end up asking many questions."

Meditation,3d7t2p,LarryBills,2,Tue Jul 14 04:41:29 2015 UTC,"I wasn't annoyed by the 4am wake-up after the first four days or so. As well the first three days were very challenging for me, simply due to the nature of the meditation we were doing and how I was habituating to the long hours of being alone with my thoughts and watching the games one's mind can play when you start to quiet it. I thought I'd really miss eating past 5 pm but after the first day or so I didn't mind at all. You're doing so little physically that you're just not that hungry. Sometimes late at night my belly would rumble but it got easier and easier to just experience that feeling and try not to react too much.   Breakfast was always a relief and Lunch was always very exciting as it was the one thing each day that was a wildcard."
Meditation,3d7t2p,LarryBills,2,Tue Jul 14 04:53:13 2015 UTC,"were the days long and boring? (no talking,internet,music or anything) all you have to do is meditate, did the time seem to go slow?"
Meditation,3d7t2p,clickstation,6,Tue Jul 14 04:52:11 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it went slowly, sometimes it flew by. It all had to do with how things were going in the meditation, if you were interested in it, and if you were practicing diligently. I don't know who said it, but boredom is a mask discomfort wears, and this kind of thing will really teach you about that. Practice offers up a lot of stimulation, it is just difficult to surrender yourself to it.  Either way, once we hit day 5 things seemed to fly by. The first three days I thought it would never end. Perception is funny."

Meditation,3d8ygp,dami79,2,Tue Jul 14 12:52:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe the jhanas, I guess. But really, if you do any time-tested technique well, and you follow all the instructions, your mind will be less splintered, and that will probably give you what looks exactly like 'more' IQ points although it's just 'less' of a divided-mind. You'd actually have the same basic parts, but they'd be unified and integrated."
Meditation,3d8ygp,Sampajanna,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:33:41 2015 UTC,"The jhanas are not a meditation in themselves, but just degrees of concentration.    It's your mental stress that makes you feel bad.   So when that long-accustomed mental tension is gone to a certain degree, then we decide it must be a thing and we have to give it a name.    Your mental  tensions / thoughts / desires / worries / identifications hide your inner joy, like the clouds can hide the sun.    It's amazing that when these are finally relaxed to some degree, you feel peace, bliss, joy, etc.    This joy is always inside you.   That's why people are  always looking for happiness --- that joy is within them, but hidden by their constant search for it in external things.   So if a person wants to experience the jhanas, then they should do a concentration meditation.   When their minds are sufficiently concentrated, they will start to feel very good.  The reality is that their minds are now so concentrated that they have forgotten to feel bad (worried / stressed / tense / lonely / unloved / ""bored"").   Edit: breathing meditations are a great route to concentration."

I was speaking kinda off-the-cuff, in shorthand, implying that they should:   do a concentration meditation   -in such a way that they'd experience piti/sukha/et-cetera. Whether or not the jhanas arise as a result of 'kleśa'/obscuration-removal or whether they arise from 'sambojjhaṅgā'-unification/strengthening is an interesting discussion I think. But either way, their question implied to me that they were not really deep into their research yet, and maybe they were just looking for some terms or names to look into. I was just quickly giving them a term to google ['jhanas'] instead of trying to bombard them with jargon/theory (don't get me wrong, I love me some jargon and some theory!)."
Meditation,3d8ygp,Sampajanna,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:32:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks -- I just wanted to clarify the point about the jhanas because I keep seeing posts from people referring to the jhanas as a technique in themselves.   So I just wanted to post a clarifier.   I do wonder though if the obscuration removal and unification of the mind are just two sides of the same coin, just as hot / cold and dark / light are just different points on the same continuum."
Meditation,3d8ygp,snickerpops,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:29:49 2015 UTC,"It's a question that's always fascinated me. I think your intuition is solid there, that they are probably two sides of the same coin.  As someone who gets easily discouraged sometimes, I respond to obscuration removal (since we're 'already there' or already intrinsically have the latent necessities, but it's our confused relation with them that we undo) whereas other people who are energized by a healthy sense of urgency/samvega can really seem to respond to a model that frames things in terms of moving from their current weakness/splinteredness to a strong and healthy unification of enlightenment-factors that inspires them. That model tends to make me feel daunted and inspires craving for the factors, more than the obscuration-removal frame for some reason."

Meditation,3d77ua,Hooots,6,Tue Jul 14 01:41:23 2015 UTC,"Your post is inviting others to boast of personal achievements, and that is not at all helpful for your practice or theirs. Awakening also doesn't depend on duration of thoughtless states. Why should it matter how long others experience a particular state? If you know what you are supposed to be doing in meditation practice, just do it. If you don't know, find out.  The state of radical, effortless absorption is called samadhi. It is usually categorized into two types: Absolute and Positive Samadhi.  Positive Samadhi is effortless concentration where an object still appears. Because subject-object relationship (you and the thing you're concentrating on) is still possible in it, insight can appear, and experiences of freedom, all-encompassing unity, and bliss can also appear.  In Absolute Samadhi, subject and object are merged. There is no external object, but only silence. And there is no sense of a self experiencing the silence. No self, no other, no sight, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch, no thought. But it is not a dull, unconscious state. It is very intensely concentrated, aware.  Positive Samadhi tends to be more fleeting. People can experience small flashes or some minutes of it. Absolute Samadhi tends to last longer, and have a timeless quality. One can enter it for minutes, hours, or even days, and come out with the sense that little or no time has passed. There are stories of beings living in samadhi for many years, and even for eons. I've encountered enough great beings with exceptional attainment to believe that this is not only possible but almost certainly true.  We give lip service to the idea that our potential is limitless. But when the attainments of others forge beyond what we ourselves can conceive we may become doubtful. The fault is not with the attainment, nor the report of it, but with our own limited perception. As our own attainment develops, our perception grows and we can see beyond what others see.  Take responsibility for your own practice. Don't check others. If you are in doubt, clarify the doubt by learning the proper method and its application. Then just do it. Avoid taking pride in spiritual athletics, as this will inflate your ego and pose a huge obstacle to progress."

Why begrudge someone else the chance to learn about the topic they asked a question about?  In any case, if you don't like it you don't have to read the comment; but those who want to learn something about the thoughtless state of samadhi (including possibly OP) can go ahead and read it.

I didn't ask about that at all. I think you're holding on to your ego buddy , let it go.  I was simply curious about other people whats wrong with that. And it's not boasting , if they are responding to my question... If they made there on post about it then I think that would be an ego based response.

Attentive work where by you realize that you are not the doer is called Karma Yoga.  Constant Self Inquiry using the question Who am I? will kill I, the ego. The first thought formed in the mind is the I, the ego thought all other thoughts come to serve I, the ego thought.  Where is no I, the ego the thoughts have no one to serve and they die. Till you kill I, the ego and absorb yourself in self, you cannot totally get rid of thoughts.  Staying in meditation for 15-20 is just like a temporary feel good massage. Practice Self Inquiry meditation for a much more permanent transformation.  http://www.advaitameditation.in"

Yes, it's possible to go for days. But you have to do nothing else but practice to get to that point.

On an average day, a few seconds up to maybe a few minutes. It gets easier when you practice more or less continuously, like on a retreat."
Meditation,3d6mjd,veedizzle,3,Mon Jul 13 22:52:57 2015 UTC,"It's ironic how many of us come to meditation because we are desperate to escape certain feelings, and we jump to the assumption that meditation will somehow help us to get rid of these feelings. It can be a bitter pill to learn that meditation is actually about the complete opposite, that instead it invites us to confront those feelings we have been trying to escape from, to become deeply intimate with them.   It isn't actually the feelings themselves that cause the suffering, but our estimation of them. Because our judgement about the feelings is unconscious to us, we assume the feelings are inherently bad and must be somehow conquered or changed. But actually the feelings aren't a problem -- a fact that is revealed as one gradually learns to stop running away, and just be with them as they are, unadulterated and unfiltered. Then we discover that the supposedly fearful thing that was going to irreparably harm us isn't actually a problem at all, and that can often feel intensely liberating."

What you can do is to be aware of your behaviour in order not to go astray.  In my opinion adaptability to different situations is a great thing, putting a mask to hide yourself because of some fear not so much. It requires a deep level of self-awareness to know if you're doing the former thing or the latter.  Whatever you do, know yourself and accept wholeheartedly who you are (which is always changing)."

I think the point is not to put on a mask because you're fearful of facing up to yourself. If you do wear a mask, put it on out of choice, because the situation calls for it, not to match some idea you're attached to about who you are.  This ability to face up to yourself is about being aware of and being okay with what is in your mind in all situations -- any sight, sound, thought, emotion. It's about your situation exactly as it is, behind all the ideas you have about yourself, without being compelled to judge it as somehow wrong or compare it some idea you have about what should be.   While this kind of insight into yourself might inform how you act, it doesn't mean you shouldn't react to what you're experiencing or that you'll magically know some hypothetical correct course of action. The only difference is that with such insight you'll choose how to act based on a more accurate idea of what is, since you can better distinguish between primordial perceptions and your judgements about and interpretations of those perceptions."

I mean I've been high and had that feeling (that there was no difference from what I perceive, my consciousness, and my awareness of the present moment), but that doesn't really mean anything to me when I am sober. I am open to the idea of panpsychism, for instance that a bug has much less advanced consciousness capabilities than a human and therefore that spectrum may go past animals and beyond humans, but I don't say I believe in it.

Meditation,3d3gf3,sleepycorn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:06:44 2015 UTC,I am saying the answer you are starting with is panpsychism and/or nondualism and then meditating to find that answer true.  I try not to be the kind of person that seeks to reaffirm my existing beliefs but instead search for things that contradict my beliefs which moves me towards a more moderate stance in many things. I say try because all humans have an innate confirmation bias. This says more of human nature and psychology than of non-dualism.

Meditation,3d6j6b,blueofnoon,6,Mon Jul 13 22:27:10 2015 UTC,"The beauty of Buddhism —what little of it I understand— is that it is very practice-oriented. I have spent a lot of my life 'deeply understanding' the problems of my life, knowing the whole story of my life on the intellectual level, backwards and forwards. But when it came down to it, something experientially made me feel like the same attached person — I couldn't do what it took to reverse the cycle.  Meditation is a great tool because it provides ways to stabilize your attention, to notice the true way that your mind behaves as it's happening, and this cuts through all of that surface intellectual 'understanding' that we think is sufficient to make change. I'm so glad that I stumbled on the experiential-wisdom of meditation (like, for example, sitting with a bout of attachment/anxiety and really watching over and over how utterly impermanent it is and that it disappears all on its own: we know in our heads that 'things pass,' but it only gives us deep, unshakable serenity when we see the full-on transitoriness of strong mental episodes over and over)."

Meditation will not fix your suffering immediately. It'll take time before you even realize what it is doing to you. But this is the only process that you can use to eliminate all suffering in life. If you decide to do psychedelic drugs, meditation will also help eliminate the possibility of a bad trip.  With that being said, psychedelic substances can help you skip a few roads in the spiritual journey. Tripping on shrooms or LSD will enhance your consciousness and your level of perception. It is like experiencing what happens after you meditate for years and years. When you are in an altered state of consciousness, you will understand spirituality on a higher level. Psychedelics are NOT a replacement for meditation, though they are great for having a spiritual realization."

How do we know there's anything happening or being experienced at all? Investigate your experience. You can't find consciousness out there in your visual field, or in the sky, or on the walls, and yet nevertheless you know you're conscious. It's that base-element. You don't just know you're conscious because you're thinking about being conscious, something else knows that you're experiencing the thinking. It seems fundamental to me.  You can't necessarily see it, but you can be it. 'I am' does not seem to be a traditional object of meditation (like a thing you 'hold' with your attention such as the breath, et cetera) or an object of consciousness (like a thing your sense field or cognition detects)."

I really believe it is a very effective way to understanding yourself. Big teachers/prophets like Ramana Maharashi, Nisgaratta Maharjai, Mooji stress this over and over again, as a potent way. I have strong faith in them, for they know what they are talking about.  But it is known that there was always confusion by there desciple with this way.

Oh man, on a sidenote: I saw a pretty funny video of Spira trying to 'point' his interviewer to the 'I am.' It didn't go as expected. To me, the true test of a great teacher is when the student gives unexpected or confused answers, answers that are definitely 'not what the teacher planned for.'   In the video I linked above, you'll notice that Spira just stops at the 9:48 mark, and tells him 'where I was trying to lead [you] with the questions.' I've had that happen with some teachers: they couldn't work with the student's level of understanding and just started to tell the person what insights to have, what the finish-line was supposed to be. It's hard to meet a student at the student's level, then walk up with them step by step, so that they can then have that moment of beautiful discovery for themselves.  To Spira's credit, it seems incredibly difficult, and incredibly rare to be able to point-out stuff to someone whose intuitions may be a little...eccentric or who maybe isn't listening to the instructions in-context. That probably takes a full-fledged master, like a Maharshi or something, to turn such a moment of confusion into pure discovery."

The other thing to consider is different explanations and different teachers resonate and make sense to different people at different times. If you are just bashing your head against some technique even if it holds high promise, you may just want to poke around for other teachings that do make sense to you.   The other other thing to consider is that bashing your head against a problem or technique is a time honored spiritual path in it's own right.

Being 'in the present' means being consciously aware of your mind, your thoughts, your body and your immediate surroundings. Noticing what 'is' - present tense - but not judging it or trying to modify it. Your mind wanders and you think 'I was worrying'.  You do not say 'Goddam I was worrying again, stupid me'.  You observe and ... that's all.  So you say 'I am breathing slowly', 'I am sleepy', whatever.  By consciously observing you gently start to push other mind processes aside until ALL you are thinking is about is 'here and now'.  I guess that's why focussing on your breathing is so important."

I asked him how he'd feel if he were locked in a back vault with all that money, permanently. I explained that super-rich people like various luxuries, and that this often includes the prestige of high-profile charities, operating foundations named after themselves.  In day to day life, interconnectedness means thinking of ourselves as parts of our families, neighborhoods and communities, being friendly and open-minded instead of suspicious and judgmental.  You can think of this as anatta for beginners."
Meditation,3d5mq8,TastyPruno,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:32:04 2015 UTC,"The describe it with the ""sense of being"", ""sense of existence"", ... I still dont know where to put my attention or what to do at all. Is it a thought?   The sense of ""I am"" isn't a tangible thing that can be perceived like a thought. It's the awareness that perceives, the sense of space in which things arise. Trying to find that sense of I in objects is as futile as trying to use a knife to cut the same knife or shining a torch to illuminate the same torch. Perceptually investigating this sense of I doesn't involve trying to find that I in things, but becoming interested in the awareness in which the objects appear."

It is not a sense object, where I should I rest my attention? On the space? I'll try the intuitive sense of being. I just know I am.   I think that's fine. To attend to your sense of being, you must give up the search for it, since your sense of being cannot be found in a concept or in a particular state of mind. If you give up the search, if you completely abide in the present moment, then ""being aware of awareness"" is what you would be left with. It is the screen on which all your ideas and judgments appear.   Mooji said this in the video you linked to: ""You don't have to go someplace to find consciousness. That is foolishness, because the very 'I' that you feel is consciousness. But because this consciousness has somehow developed a limitation onto itself by identifying with the body, it starts to look for consciousness."" To give an analogy, it's like someone is standing in front of their fridge, looking inside at the contents, and yet believes that they must somehow search to find what is in their fridge. They're already looking at what's in the fridge! But they don't realise that because they're so caught up in their search for what's in the fridge. If they stopped the search for a moment, then they'd realise that they were staring at the fridge all along.  It is this kind of searching, done unconsciously and constantly, that prevents us from perceiving the current moment as it is. We get so lost in our stories about what is happening, our ideas of what could be, searching for satisfaction, that we never actually check the way things actually are right now, behind our judgements. The instruction to ""attend to your sense of being"" encourages you to make that check.  As a final point, I think the confusion you feel over what to attend to suggests you're following the instruction as intended. You feel confused precisely because your mind is searching for a concept to latch onto and is feeling dissatisfied that it cannot find one. Don't try to resolve the confusion. March into it."

Again, without the OP's references it's tough to say where they got their inspiration. If you liked the flavor, then the OP did mention Eckhart Tolle, so there's that as a possibility.

We have learned a lot about psychology and the human body through scientific research. BUT, to truly understand, you must start meditation.

She is wonderful, and like any relationship I lose sight of that sometimes with dirty dishes or crying child and find myself making hurtful remarks. I believe I learned my anger behavior while growing up, but now it's my problem to fix and not pass to my kids.  Meditation has helped me slow down my reactions. I still get angry, but sometimes I am able to recognize and take a deep breath and stop the angry response. Not every time, but sometimes. And I don't put so much value in the mental conversations that usually spiral me into a sour mood. More often I've recently found myself taking a breath and letting them go.  Gratitude is what I've been adding to my mindfulness practice lately. I try to give mental thanks to random things over the course of the day and think of why it's amazing that thing is a part of my life. A fun experiment has been to take anything negative and try to make something grateful about it. Dirty dishes reminds me to be grateful that my family is well fed and that we have modern conveniences like ovens and running water."

The relaxing is important.   One other thing I'd recommend if you're doing that many hours, is breaking it up with walking meditation. Every couple hours, do a half hour of walking meditation.

Meditation,3d5ytw,thaninley,2,Mon Jul 13 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"It could be that you're still unconsciously tensing there, just as a by-product of your focus on your breath. Cool that you found Bhante V's talks though -- I consider him my main teacher, and I've been having really good luck with his way of teaching!  I have still occasionally found myself getting tense in the head, even doing the relax step. I think that's because of the way I was relaxing -- forcing myself to relax. Imagine holding a tight fist, there are two ways to unclench it: you can force open a flat palm, or you can just gently relax the muscles and allow the tension to fade. Obviously, the latter is what we're going for. :-) I sometimes have to check in with myself and make sure I'm doing everything gently.  One thing Bhante V often recommends to students that are new to him, but who have been practicing other methods before, is to switch from breath to metta. That way you are less likely to hang on to your old concentration habits. Metta is very pleasant and body-focused. At first, it's a warm fuzzy feeling in your chest, and it eventually starts radiating throughout your body (and further than that). It's also a little easier to carry with you through the day, as you can beam that nice feeling at people you are interacting with, etc. It's a little more applicable ""out there in the world"" than the breath, IMHO.  Good luck, and let me know if you have questions..  Edit: also, don't keep your attention on the tension. I bet it's one of those things that's there because you don't want it to be. Just let it go, relax, come back to the breath. (""6R it"" :-))"

Meditation,3d5gl4,reptilee,3,Mon Jul 13 17:55:26 2015 UTC,"I disagree. If you were noticing that thoughts arise during your meditation, craving about the timer, then it's not necessarily wisdom to alter your technique to cater to your agitations during the session.   Of course if something gets torturous then you change it, but the other side of meditation is that we can really gain wisdom by noticing when we generate agitation from within (i.e., the anticipation you were having, which I've experienced a lot). If we simply sit with it for a little while, these kinds of problems easily can be worked-with and become material of great benefit once if we notice that it comes and goes, and brings up lots of interesting stuff about our personality.   I've had that kind of 'timer craving' a lot, but it's just more material to work with, I don't think it's necessarily a sign that timers are intrinsically bad. Non-timing has its plusses but it can have its minuses: non-timers also have the problem of catering to their agitations without a timer: 'Ok, I feel like ending now. But wait.. is it the right time, or am I just feeling like it because I'm being weak? How can I know when I'm just being impulsive or balanced?' That line of questioning can cause its own set of problems, and yet non-timers have learned that this internally-generated pattern is also material that brings wisdom once we sit with it.  In other words, it's not the session's fault that we're annoyed, we're annoyed and we're supposed to sit with it with clear eyes such that we can learn about freedom from annoyance, not just to take away a timer or customize a couple of settings here and there."
Meditation,3d5fhn,PeacefulJungle,4,Mon Jul 13 17:47:36 2015 UTC,"It's just a synonym for continuous, non-reactive watching.  If you're really seeing something as it arises the whole time, you're acknowledging it: 'That is really that, right now. I accept the reality, as it is. Not as I would want it to be.' That's it, you're not supposed to be in love with anything or do much at all, it is just acknowledging reality and not fighting it.   how is that suppose to silence my mind   It's not about a silent mind necessarily, it's about a healthy relationship with your thoughts. If you can learn to let thoughts slip by without getting into a fight or tumbling around, then there's a lot of space and freedom that can feel very much like the relief that comes with silence.   As you keep practicing, and you learn to watch things without getting involved or reacting, then you learn that things arise and pass. Those experiences of arising and passing give you a kind of calm that is called 'equanimity' in the meditation world, a calm that goes deeper than mere relaxation because equanimity is based partly on our direct experiences of watching thoughts come and go without us being harmed in the process."

Meditation,3d5fhn,meditationELI5,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:12:40 2015 UTC,"I have a question for you on the top thoughts that I observe.  Should I be simply acknowledging them during the meditation and then after trying to do something differently.  For example, I beat myself up a lot for being lazy.  I don't realize I do it oftentimes until I'm meditating and then observe those thoughts.  But I need to also work on not being lazy, right?"
Meditation,3d5fhn,beautyoftheday,2,Mon Jul 13 20:06:44 2015 UTC,"When you observe your top thoughts, pay attention to the sensations, images, sounds, and feelings that 'come with' the thought. This sort of attention doesn't have to stop when you are living your life and not in 'meditation mode' as you can observe them as they happen as well.  For example when you are meditating on your laziness you may come across images of old memories where you were berated for being lazy, who said it? how does it feel in your body when you relive that memory? do you just stop the memory and say 'I've remembered this before but it does me no good' and stop? you should let the entire sequence of thoughts run through without being attached. Each individual thought and sensation or feeling can be studied and will open up to other related images and sensations and each will give further insight.  You will also sometimes find contradicting beliefs that you've held without really knowing. For example perhaps you resent people who work hard because they've made you feel bad in your past. If you have a belief that being non-lazy will compromise you somehow, and hold another belief that you being lazy will make you a bum it is hard for the mind to reconcile both and take action. Your whole system will be in conflict.  So in the end the work is done on both ends. You of course should use your meditative insights to help achieve goals in your real life, and your real life experiences is also full of information to further be meditated upon.  If you find yourself having trouble feeling the finer parts while meditating, you should work on some concentration-meditation. The more work you do in that area will help you better separate and see/feel clearer the sensations and going-ons when you do the work described above. The mystical part about meditation is that once you see clearly your beliefs and thoughts and decide to no longer trust them or hold onto them, they will disappear without you having to 'keep it in mind' in your waking life.  In the end, don't be so tough on yourself. You are already starting on the path. The old you that is lazy is not your fault. You may have done things to make it worse but in a way you couldn't help feeling that way because you weren't taught to manage the inner stuff. Be kind to yourself as you do these exercises and don't take my words as 'it' and operate on that, you will eventually realize these realizations on your own in your own way. Good luck!"

Failure to provide evidence to support a claim is not the same as providing evidence to debunk a claim. Your entire article is this fallacy.

Meditation,3d3p5e,Sampajanna,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:57:13 2015 UTC,"A very good technique I learnt from a highly respected monk here in Perth (ajahn brahm if you're interested) is to say the thing you want or need to remember in your mind 3 times, visualise yourself remembering/ doing it and then once you have done that, forget it, let it go.   I find this so incredibly effective and I totally understand what you mean when you have really important thoughts during meditation.   So for example say you suddenly realise "" I totally forgot to pay my phone bill and it's a month overdue, ahh!!!"" Or ""I've been meaning to listen to that album a friend recommended and I couldn't remember the  name of it and now I do"" simply say to yourself (in your mind) ""once this is done I will listen to aja by steely dan"" ( great album) be confident that you will remember it and while you are thinking this, envision yourself finishing your meditation and remembering it. Do it 3 times then get back to your meditation. I guarantee you if you don't remember it straight afterwards you will soon enough and this isn't a very disturbing method. Best of luck!"
Meditation,3d2sb3,ZosoGG,3,Mon Jul 13 01:48:52 2015 UTC,"Is trying to simply accept my anxiety counterproductive because I am paradoxically giving attention to it   The trick is, you don't just look at things, you make sure that your attitude is based in equanimity —an even-mindedness, a non-reactive stance.   If your agenda isn't to look non-reactively, even-mindedly, then looking will just intensify things unless you're lucky.  Some folks cultivate equanimity by noticing directly how smaller experiences are totally impermanent, and then when bigger experiences come, you have built up direct confidence that 'this too shall pass,' a confidence that is deeper than the intellectual understanding that things pass.    How can I better concentrate my mind given the higher stakes ""if I don't concentrate correctly I'm gonna have a full blown panic attack""   I don't understand. If you're having life-altering, crippling mental-health problems, don't you have a therapist or psychiatrist? Almost all mental health professionals are aware of which forms of mindfulness work together with psychological paths like Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, and so on. You should be consulting whichever professional is treating your panic attacks and other things.  You may need to work on acceptance first, because you're in no position to think you can use willpower to concentrate away a crippling life-pattern or a big attack, at least as a relative-beginner. It's such a tall and painful task to try that route, in my experience.   I love the following 'acceptance' meditation style, from Buddhist monk Ajahn Brahm:   You’re aware of things as they appear right now, and you allow them to come in or stay or go, whenever they want. Letting-be meditation is like sitting in a room, and whoever comes in the door, you let in. They can stay as long as they like. Even if they are terrible demons, you allow them to come in and sit down. You are not at all fazed. [That's the equanimity part, it's not just noticing, it's non-reactive noticing] If the Buddha himself enters in all his glory, you just sit here just the same, completely equanimous.“ Come in if you want.”“ You can go whenever.” Whatever comes into your mind, the beautiful or the gross, you stand back and let it be, with no reactions at all— quietly observing and practicing silent awareness in the present moment. This is letting-be meditation...  Letting-be meditation can become quite powerful. If your breath meditation or mettā meditation or any other type of meditation isn’t working...just do the letting-be meditation...  If I’m in pain, if I have a headache, stomachache, or some other ache, or if the mosquitoes are biting, I say, “Just let it be.” I don’t argue with it, don’t get upset about it. I just watch the feelings in my body as the mosquito pushes its nose into my flesh and itching sensations follow. “Just let things be.”   —Mindfulness, Bliss, and Beyond: A Meditator's Handbook (p. 72-74)."
Meditation,3d2sb3,Sampajanna,3,Mon Jul 13 02:31:54 2015 UTC,"My understanding of it is to try and concentrate on your breaths, and try and let your mind roam freely.    Keep the practice simple.

Meditation,3d2sb3,garden-of-peace,3,Mon Jul 13 05:27:30 2015 UTC,"The mind is not you; you cannot control it. Can you will your mind to sleep right now, immediately? Can you order your mind never to have anxiety again? Can you make yourself elated, right this instant?  You've been attempting to control something that is not controllable. Can you see now why this has never worked? Can you see now how even attempting to do this only ever results in frustration, anxiety, and worse? Can you see now how thinking your mind is you or that you are your thoughts is causing you suffering?  When the cause of a mental phenomenon's continued existence ceases to exist, the mental phenomenon itself will cease to exist. When anxiety arises, just see that it has arisen, as quickly as you can. Then go back to whatever you were previously doing. The anxiety will fall away rapidly, all on its own, because the cause of its continued existence (you allowing yourself to be sucked into it and thus keeping it alive with your attention to it) has ceased to exist.  Also, when you see that anxiety has arisen, be sure to see it with an impartial, unbiased, neutral mind. Otherwise, you will simply be giving a direct and immediate cause for frustration/anger to arise.  Mental phenomenon are all impermanent. They all come and they all go. Do not try to pull in positive states. Do not try to push away negative states. Do not try to fight. Just let the mind be natural, doing what it does. Just observe it; just observe the mental phenomenon rise and fall, repeatedly, again and again."
Meditation,3d2sb3,Tqxl,2,Mon Jul 13 05:33:43 2015 UTC,"Since you have improved your situation in regard to your anxiety it seems like you are on the right path. Keep it up! I'm absolutely not an expert, but my initial thought here is that you shouldn't focus nether on the anxiety, or to block it out, or to think bout something else, but rather just return to your breath and focus on your immediate experiences and stay present. Note your experiences objectively without judgement and return to the breath."
Meditation,3d2sb3,Dispassionfruit,2,Mon Jul 13 02:25:45 2015 UTC,"I totally know what you're talking about. I recently had a weed-panic-anxiety-attack -- I barely smoke anymore, so that's part of it. I thought I'd be able to deal, using my meditative skills, but only going to sleep helped.. This kept coming and coming. The moments that I was able to combat the anxiety, I was looking through my body for where I was tensing up, and unclenching those areas. Then I looked for the feeling of the anxiety. It was an occasional sweeping unpleasant physical sensation that my mind would immediately latch onto, and start thinking bad thoughts. That's the key.   If you can find that feeling, and let it be there... Keep your awareness on that yucky physical feeling... Then your mind won't latch onto it and try to explain it away with all these anxious thoughts.   So basically: 1)see that anxiety is an an unpleasant physical feeling combined with an immediate, habitual mental grabbing-onto and running-away-with. 2)add an element to your meditation where you relax that mental tension every time you bring your attention back to the breath. No matter how bad the thoughts seem, let them be for now.. Don't push them away, just come back to your breath and relax. 3)dont smoke weed anymore. ;-)  Depression actually works very similarly."
Meditation,3d2sb3,Dispassionfruit,2,Mon Jul 13 03:17:44 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah, this last panic attack was the final straw for me and weed. It's been a love/hate since the beginning but I've finally realized im just too anxious of a person to smoke. I also tried using the weed as a means of helping confront my anxiety for a while (because I believed that it helped bring subconscious anxieties to the forefront of my mind), but I don't think its worth it at all anymore. Anyway thanks for the advice. Once I realized that a lot of my anxiety was being cause by the actual physical sensation of anxiety, it actually helped a lot."

Meditation,3d2sb3,SubtropicThunder,2,Tue Jul 14 02:48:20 2015 UTC,"Your understanding of meditation is only a part of it, but it is not wrong. When you meditate and bring your attention back to your breath, what you are doing is training your mind to focus on one particular thing.  As you meditate this way more and more, you start to notice how the mind works. How it starts off with one thought and jumps to the next and how if you are not mindful you will be lost in your thought before you know it. The goal of this type of meditation is to see how your mind works and moves.  After you've done it enough, you can expand your meditation to be aware of what is on your mind but view it from a distance so to speak. To not be as attached to each thought and see them but not be lost. What you've been dabbling in, is this 'further' type of meditation.  You couldn't remember what happened because your mind wasn't strong enough and also because you were probably too high. If you were able to allow your mind to not fight the panic attack and 'let it happen' but also observe it from a distance at the same time, you can slowly see each individual component of your panic attack.  What do you think about when it happens? what images or words or sounds do you hear? are parts of your body feeling heat or numbness or pain? When you are able to meditate on it 'all' you start to see each piece and more and more each time. When the process plays out several times you gain a distance and understanding of where they came from and which events brought about their existence. This understanding can be further meditated on to help you slowly unknot each individual panic attack experience.  It takes time, it's not easy, but it does get easier and I wish you the best."

Yeah, but there's also other vitamins that are part of being healthy. However, if you're deficient in one vitamin, maybe that one vitamin 'really' matters.  Meditation is a multi-faceted art/lifestyle. Duration is a facet. But maybe you need to focus on quality of work and not quantity, who knows. If you're dragging through a 3-hour meditation, it may not yield as much for you as a truly committed 15-minute session of unbroken, pristine, instruction-following.  That's when I find it beneficial to have a teacher or community or something, where we have a set of eyes that can give us an idea of which factor 'really matters' the most for us.  Maybe time is your deal, maybe you should actually be thinking about your technique, or posture, or your scheduling of when you do it (some people do it at times when they're half-asleep, or after they have insanely heavy food, et cetera).

If you'd like to know why, I keep hearing two explanations:   Meditation is changing your brain, and those big changes happen better with more practice. You don't see serious musicians that practice for less than an hour a day. The brain quiets down after about 40 minutes, so this is when the real meditation begins.

It really is like a drug trip, maybe not a psychedelic trip but it's not normal meditation. Every breath you take is like a hit from a bong, but there's no bong. And it is hugely spiritual. It doesn't require super intense concentration so I think most people could learn to do it. I had to stop the other day because it was so intense I was getting nervous. How many people do you know who were feeling so happy, and connected to all things and feeling such intense metta that they were worried they might never get back to normal? And I felt the presence of non-physical entities too.   It also creates a kind of synesthesia where everything I see and hear I also feel in my body as if they are part of me. There is an effect like the brain is a virtual reality machine and what I see is really a movie inside my head (I am still looking for the screen behind the movie), like my mind contains the whole universe including me walking around inside it. It changes the ""energy"" of your surroundings too. You could go to the filthiest shack in the poorest slum in the most miserable God forsaken corner of nowhere and meditating this way would make it a place of beauty and joy. These effects are not gross like a psychedelic trip they are subtle like a change in understanding. And these experiences are not restricted to sitting meditation, you can have them walking around town or out in nature.   The best thing about this type of meditation is not the intense experiences, the best thing is that between meditation sessions I'm happier and I worry less.   And it doesn't cause vomiting or diarrhea like Ayahuasca does. It's 100% free. And as far as I know it's legal everywhere."

Meditation,3d0xyv,noeinhaltss,6,Sun Jul 12 20:15:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe more like ELI7 - but, it's not complicated.  You either notice your thoughts (observe them) or you are caught up in them.   Our normal condition as humans is ""lost in thought"" - we tend to let our minds lead us around, and we are usually at the mercy of what it produces: thoughts, emotions, urges, the ""voice in your head"" that comments on and judges everything.  Being lost in thought leads to stress, anxiety, endless worry, self-doubt, etc. It makes you victim to conditioned behavior that greatly influences your decisions, actions, and reactions.  If, on the other hand, you notice (observe) your thoughts, you are no longer at the mercy of what your mind produces. Some people say it's like taking your life off ""autopilot.""  edit - added a period (.)."
Meditation,3d0xyv,elphabaloves,3,Sun Jul 12 17:05:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, but how?"
Meditation,3d0xyv,186394,6,Sun Jul 12 17:08:40 2015 UTC,"How do you observe your thoughts?  I think the question makes it more complex than it needs to be.  You observe your thoughts the same as you observe anything else - a bird, a smell, a sound.  Meditation is an exercise that cultivates awareness, and helps you develop the skill of observing without getting caught up in.  So, I guess meditation is one answer. Though you don't have to be trained in meditation to observe (as opposed to ""being lost in"").  If you are looking for meditation instructions, see the FAQ. It's well worth your time and effort!"
Meditation,3d0xyv,elphabaloves,3,Sun Jul 12 17:16:23 2015 UTC,"How would you define ""thoughts""? Is it internal monologue or is it like bubbles in boiling water of your mind popping in and out before you say them out voicelessly?  I still cant catch with that feeling which meditators are fond of (euphoria? broadened perception?). When I start to analyze my ""thoughts"", it goes like.... connecting the dots... whatever the starting thought might be: i see the wall... hmm wall? ok... is it white? yes it is.. why did i ask myself?.. why do i think about the wall? forget the wall... think about the window.. ok.. is it clear sky outside? yes, seems so.. why do i need to think of the damn sky? what made me think of it?  And it can go on and on for several tens of minutes until I get completely bored and bail out. :-Q"
Meditation,3d0xyv,ToadForce,3,Mon Jul 13 03:43:16 2015 UTC,"The definition of thought encompasses both of those examples. And I would offer this - if you are asking for a definition, you are making it way too complicated. I think you know what thoughts are (pun intended).  As far as ""catching that feeling..euphoria, broadened perception"" - that's a bit problematic. When meditating, I was taught not to strive for a particular state. You are setting expectations that can't be met, which means you'll get frustrated and give up. Just practice consistently, and what comes will come.  In regard to your experience, that's pretty normal. Now that you've seen how thoughts give rise to more thoughts, and you are aware of the sheer volume of thoughts that exists, try changing what you do just a bit. Based on what you wrote, you are ""obsessing"" over observing every thought - meditating isn't a video game where your goal is to catch all your thoughts at the exclusion of everything else.   Instead, the goal is to notice when your mind wanders, and return to your anchor (mantra/breath when meditating, present moment when not meditating). This ""noticing and returning"" helps you develop the skill of not getting caught up in your mental noise...of not getting lost in thought...of not following your mind where it leads without question.  When it comes to thoughts, emotions, urges, and all your other mind-made activity - you can either indulge it (become wrapped up/lost in it) OR let it be as it is, independent from you and your attention. The latter is meditating, and people tend to find a better quality of life with they pursue that path.  edit - I posted a link to a free guide you might find helpful in this comment."
Meditation,3d0xyv,elphabaloves,2,Mon Jul 13 11:08:19 2015 UTC,"The problem that you're having is that you're thinking without being aware that you're thinking. You're getting lost in thought.  When this happens, just know that it has. Say to yourself, ""The mind was just lost in thought,"" each and every single time that you know that it has happened.  When you know that you've been lost in thought, just know so neutrally. Becoming frustrated or angry about having been lost in thought will markedly slow your progress.  Do not ""watch in advance"" or ""wait expectantly"" as this will completely block your progress. Just be aware, as much as you can, as soon as you can, after the fact.  After doing this for a short period of time (days at minimum; weeks at maximum), you will notice that Mindfulness will begin to arise automatically, on its own accord. When Mindfulness arises as such it will result in you spontaneously becoming aware that your mind has went out to think.  The more you practice, the more Mindfulness will arise. The more you practice, the quicker Mindfulness will arise (i.e., decreasing thought-detection latency).  Once you reach this point, only then can you begin to ""observe your thoughts."" However, this does not mean to observe the content of your thoughts; Do not allow yourself to get sucked into a thought's narrative or drama vortex.  Observing your thoughts means only to be aware of when a thought arises and when it falls. Your duty is to simply observe the birthing and dying of thoughts, repeatedly.  This will lead you to develop insights about impermanence (annica) within the context of your very own experience. This insight will contribute to reducing or eliminating mental suffering."
Meditation,3d0xyv,garden-of-peace,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:46:47 2015 UTC,"this is quite simplified but should be a good start:  Thoughts usually come to us as sounds, words, images, or a combination of them.  When you have a thought, you 'see' and 'hear' a scene or an event taking place 'somewhere'.   For example imagine your mother,  the 'place' where you imagine her image and 'hear' her words or your past interactions - that's where you're observing your thoughts.  when people say to observe your thoughts it means to see what is going on in this 'place' without directing it. You just let it go where it wants to go and observe it without directing. It's hard but that's the work.  Your second question, you don't 'treat' a thought in any way. It just takes place. If your thought is someone having a conversation with you, that's great! that's the thought that's going on so just keep seeing/listening to it and see where it goes.  let me know if you have further questions because I'm sure this raises more than answers."

Your mind is ALWAYS like that with thoughts. It's always talking to you, commenting on what is happening, kind of like babbling idiot! Some people call this ""monkey mind"".   Meditation is a thing you can do that calms you down and lets your mind calm down. First, you just sit, and focus on your breath: breathe in, breathe out.  You do this for a few minutes. Guess what your mind does? It wanders.  But you can notice you aren't thinking about the breath anymore, and go back to thinking about the breath.  This is sorta ""catching"" your mind thinking and trying to calm it down a bit, like catching your dog running around, and petting her to calm her down.  This is concentration meditation (some people people call it a fancy name of ""samatha""). This meditation strengthens your mind and lets you focus. That's good for the next step in observing thoughts. You've already caught your mind wandering a lot. Let's watch what it is doing!  Once you get pretty good at this by meditating every day (it takes a little while), you can try ANOTHER way of meditating --  just start being aware of those thoughts coming and going, like cars passing by on the street. Hearing sounds, smelling smells, your leg hurting, noticing the taste remaining of the cheeseburger you just ate -- those are all just thoughts! What you think of as YOU is just all these thought-cars zooming by. The more you watch, the more you see these thoughts aren't helpful, and they repeat a lot, and mostly cause you stress and suffering! But you keep watching.   The better you get at it, the more thought-cars you can watch arise and pass away!  This type of meditation is called insight meditation (fancy word: vipassana), and concentration meditation made your mind STRONG so it can FOCUS on all these thoughts whizzing by!  After a LOOONG time, it really sinks in that things are impermanent (thing of all the things and people that have passed through your life -- gosh!), unsatisfactory (weird how I have last year's iPhone but that new iPhone makes me SO EXCITED! and my iPhone looks poopy now), and self-less/not-you (you don't identify with those crazy monkey stream of thoughts).  This changes your perspective on life and reality, which some people think is really cool!  So get your mind STRONG and calm down those monkey-thoughts jumping around first. Then when you mind is strong, you can just try to be aware, separate from all those thoughts jumping around, driving by, a ""bare awareness"" of all the thoughts this brain is thinking. Once you do THAT, you will feel like all of us are ONE, and that is really something!"

Meditation,3d0xyv,SecretAgentSunny,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:54:11 2015 UTC,"""Watch thoughts like clouds"" is describing an attainment of meditation (some people have this ""attainment"" ""naturally""). If you can not even envision it then you have yet to attain it.  If you can not observe thoughts it is because you are attached to them and identify with them. Therefore, there is no separate you (from your perspective) that can observe them.  Through meditation we learn to detach and distance our selves from thoughts. Then we can observe them."

Meditation,3d0xyv,voidgrinder,0,Mon Jul 13 02:46:52 2015 UTC,"People always say observe your thoughts but I can't wrap my brain around that phrase.   How do you observe your thoughts? Do you treat a thought the same way as someone having a conversation with you?   I think you're making it too complicated. Observing or being aware of a thought is the simplest thing in the world. You will already do it with many thoughts you have.  Let's say I told you to observe the second hand on a clock. If you're observing the second hand, then you would be attending to and aware of the sight of the second hand moving around. You would observe every single tick it made.   If you were not observing the second hand, your eyes might still be on the second hand, and the image might be in your mind in some capacity, but you would be attending to something else, and therefore wouldn't truly be aware of the second hand. If you became aware of the second hand after a period of distraction, it would seem as if the hand had jumped.  This situation where we perceive something but don't really perceive it happens all the time. When people start cultivating awareness, they commonly start noticing sights they've seen a million times as if they're looking at it for the first time -- like sights on their way to work or to their local shop -- because they've started observing and being aware of what they're actually seeing rather than being lost in thought. ""The day you teach the child the name of the bird, the child will never see that bird again.""  This is why you might hear some meditation teachers talk about how ""the truth is hidden in plain sight"". The truth is right in front of your nose, staring you in the face. You just have to attend to it."

How does that factor in?   What is currently in your mind is currently in your mind. Thoughts about what you believe you control or don't control is irrelevant as to whether you're observing what you're experiencing. The idea that you control or don't control something is a judgement you're making about what you're experiencing. That judgement doesn't effect your ability to attend to what you're currently experiencing.  Our judgements about things can distort our perception of them. If your judgement that you control a particular thought was conflated with the thought you were judging, then the thought and your judgement about it would perceptually appear to you as one thing. So you might say to yourself, ""I can control this thought"", and it would seem axiomatically true, because you're unaware that the judgement has been made. Mindfully observing this thought would allow you to distinguish the thought itself from your judgement about whether you control it. You would observe the thought as it is, independent of any judgements you may make about it.  edit: corrections"
Meditation,3d2f2c,cpf,3,Sun Jul 12 23:54:23 2015 UTC,"If you have time to reflect before making important decisions, then I would write down different options on paper and visualize where each of them might lead you. As for meditation, visualizing yourself in certain situation while scanning your body might show you if you feel uneasy. Don't forget that personal development often comes at the price of getting out of your comfort zone, so if you don't feel as mindful after an eventful week just take a few days off for yourself and meditate, because this too shall pass... yet it will."
Meditation,3d2f2c,TheCleansingFlame,2,Mon Jul 13 02:35:51 2015 UTC,"I've not tried to make decisions during any specific type of mediation. I have noticed that getting myself into a peaceful and neutral state during meditation, makes it easier to decide things immediately afterwards. So essentially I'm saying that its not the type of meditation, but the quality of the practice, and letting your mind take as long as it needs to clean itself out beforehand."
Meditation,3d2f2c,newpants69,2,Mon Jul 13 00:45:19 2015 UTC,"I think the better you know yourself, the better a decision maker you will be. Ultimately when you're struggling with a decision, it's because you want to pick the 'right' thing, but you don't know what the right thing is. When you're sure of who you are (what you prefer, what your goals are, what you believe in etc) it's easier to make decisions because you will be able to choose based on what you know will be best for you. Until you build confidence in knowing yourself though, you will struggle with decisions. I've been there so I get it.   Meditation isn't going to help with decision making per say, but meditation will let you have a clearer mind when you take time to think about things afterwards. I'd say start by taking some time each day to just think about who you are and what your goals are (big and small). Analyze yourself. Learn about who you are. So many people put a lot of effort into studies at school etc, spending hours analyzing various subjects but never taking any time to study themselves. We tend to assume that we just 'know' ourselves...but I think consciously understanding yourself does take effort.   So i'd say step 1 = be more conscious of taking time to thinking about who you are. step 2 (more measurable) = try to start increasing your speed on small decision making (ie. picking something out of a vending machine...don't spend 5 minutes, spend 10 seconds). You'll find that you really have to know yourself in order to make decisions quickly like this. It's good practice for feeling more confident with the bigger things."
Meditation,3d0nk3,percyhiggenbottom,15,Sun Jul 12 14:57:35 2015 UTC,"I'm lucky he didn't slap me with a switch like the Zen guys do...   As someone who has lived with, and been one of, the 'Zen guys', I'll just testify that when the sitting monitor or Zen Master comes around with the stick, it has always been a welcome and blessed event. The most profound culmination of sitting practice can be expressed in a single hit. Whack: direct transmission. The Master's mind goes into you.  In the moment of the hit, there is nothing else. All thinking is cut off. That means that Samsara, the ocean of suffering, is in that moment cut off.  Furthermore, after long hours of sitting in one posture, I've also gratefully welcomed the instant massage and release of tension that can come with a good thwack on the back muscles or shoulder muscles.  In all my years of practice, I think I may have declined a hit only once or twice. No big deal. You silently bow 'no thank you' and the monitor passes on.  Many people come from a family or society culture that equates hitting with aggression or punishment; so they don't understand even the first thing about a Zen hit. They don't understand that its very basis is utter compassion. It is a complete support; and at times far more than that. At times is is an awakening experience, mind to mind, and beyond mind.  In some Zen lineages a hit may be used as a correction. I have not experienced this, though the extreme clarity and vigor of the Master can be felt through the stick, and it can be bracing and encouraging and can bring your own petty mind into clear focus, all at once. Even when the stick is used for corrective purposes, it is supposed to be only used compassionately. Like tough love, perhaps. The one carrying the stick stands in for Manjushri Bodhisattva, the enlightened being of Great Wisdom. The one carrying the stick is supposed to be without ego, without agenda.  It is one of the many things in Zen that is utterly beyond description, and which can wake you up with a single encounter.  I have always, always felt deeply fortunate to experience a hit from the Zen stick. A hit that can stop the mind."

Meditation,3d0nk3,TheHeartOfTuxes,4,Sun Jul 12 17:24:56 2015 UTC,"It's usually covered in any introduction to the particular center's practice, so it's more of an overt consent. Visitors may drip into the practice, and then, yes, the consent is implicit.  Even so, at the centers I've trained at, if someone has a negative reaction beyond mere stubbornness -- if getting hit triggers flashbacks to soak abuse our childhood trauma, for instance -- they can opt out.  At the end of retreats, the Zen Master gives hits to everyone, without participants having a choice in the matter (except for the special opt-out cases). This has its own meaning: clarity being driven into your life regardless of your 'yes' or 'no'.  In terms of posture correction, some centers use the stick in another way, laying it flat along the sitter's back so they can feel their alignment. The act is performed as if to say ""This here is vertical. You can shift back a bit."""

Meditation,3d1m3o,ringer54673,5,Mon Jul 13 02:05:20 2015 UTC,"First off you didn't waste your time. There are 2 kinds of meditation. The first kind is based on concentration. Meditating on either nothing or one specific thing, it sounds like you were doing it well.  The second kind of meditation is to not focus on one thing, but let whatever and whichever thought come and complete. Not trying to judge or twist or stop your thoughts in any way, letting your thought go to places where it makes you happy, sad, angry, disgusted, whatever. This second kind of meditation is 'helpful' for your mental health. The first kind of meditation is helpful to see clearer when you do the second kind. They work with each other.  Now because you didn't do the second kind as much, when things that should be thought about doesn't because you push it away, it does make it worse. You're just stuffing it all down without feeling it.  Sad things happen to all of us. We shouldn't avoid feeling them. When we feel them in our minds and think about it we hurt. That hurt is hard to face but when you've meditated enough the second way, you realize that the hurt hurts but not as much the second time, the third time.  You also gain insight into why things hurt and how you keep them around to hurt you and you get much better at facing them.  The goal of meditation is not to be at peace or relaxed if you are not at peace or relaxed. You see what is there, you have to see it all first and be okay with it all before you can relax and that's okay.  Also one thing about pushing things down is that when we push down sad things we also inadvertently push down good things. When you start getting comfortable letting out bad things good things that you never realized also comes out and creates a balance.  =)"

I just don't think it fits with the mindfulness key of what I'm trying to sort of focus my life around right now and which I've been studying with my therapist for the past few years. I definitely think the second kind that you described is absolutely what I should be trying to do and what will be beneficial for me right now.  That was a very insightful post. I know I won't really be able to dive back into meditation and I have to keep trying to get the ball rolling again. Thanks for your post, I'll keep that in mind."
Meditation,3d1n8l,nani_kore,2,Sun Jul 12 20:03:37 2015 UTC,"Hey man, i thought about this too and the only way i see is to seek these situations that provoke anger and to listen very carefully for the thought that creates the dissonance and dissolve it through observing and understanding. Maybe you ll even be thankful for these situations, which show you something about youself. I kinda recommend it, its a good feeling ;) We can do it!"
Meditation,3d1n8l,Mystliner,2,Sun Jul 12 20:48:00 2015 UTC,"It is absolutely all ego.  I used to get angry at strangers in the exact same way, except it was for not looking nice or being fit or looking ""cool"". I've always been an extremely judgmental person, but I also had tons of irrational thoughts of self-doubt and self-hatred. I soon felt people in my town were judging me (in reality my thoughts were judging me), and i'd judge them right ""back"" for being ""trashy"" or ""uncool"" or whatever. This naked elitism developed quite consciously as a coping mechanism, and soon it got out of hand.  Eventually I'd silently judge people who were nothing but kind to me. I'd judge my friend. I judged the shit out of my girlfriend, and ended up dumping her in a vicious way. I'd judge girls I was in the middle of talking to, whether they liked me or not. I'd judge literally everyone in some vague negative way where I was so special and self-aware and they weren't, and i'd call it ""realness"". I became an asshole without even knowing it. i'd be absolutely vicious to other people, and then I wouldn't know why they felt hurt by me. I have a feeling that this development alone is what might have caused my extreme neuroticism to become what looks a lot like a serious personality disorder.   I think that when you draw boundaries against others, you draw boundaries against yourself. Looking down on someone for not dressing nice means you'd look down on yourself if you didn't  dress nice. Looking down on homeless people means you'd look down on yourself if you became homeless. I think this whole worldview only worsened my social anxiety, because i'd fear looking like the things I judged.  All this stuff about feeling genuine anger at these people for preaching silliness, that's a boundary against other people and, therefore, a boundary against yourself. I don't think I'm at the stage where I'll want to have compassion and acceptence and empathy for literally everyone, but as I begin to expand it I begin to have even more compassion and acceptence and empathy for myself.   You should understand your anger, have empathy for yourself, accept it, and let it go. But I think you should have true empathy and compassion for all those other people too.   At the end of the day, you think you're better than them. And that road will only lead you to hurting yourself."
Meditation,3d1n8l,le_greatest_ledditor,3,Mon Jul 13 11:07:02 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks so much for this insight. It nearly brought me to tears. When I was at my most troubled (highschool) I experienced the same thing you mentioned about judging everyone harshly. And it was really a reflection of how low my own self-esteem was at the time.  I'd venture to say that the anger I felt at the people at church, is the anger I felt within myself as a budding atheist several years ago who was confused about what she believed and upset that she'd been ""lied to"" all those years. And although that confusion is now gone, the anger & judgment isn't.   The truth is that everyone regardless of what they believe is simply trying to find a path towards happiness. And me sitting there angry inside isn't going to get anyone closer to that path. All it's going to do is, like you said, draw boundaries against others and myself. Not only did I feel angry in that church, but I felt alone. Like cripplingly isolated. That was a big part of it too that I didn't mention.  It's funny, because this is one of the very few areas that I still struggle with judgment towards others - when it comes to religion. I think if I can overcome this, there'd be no bounds for my compassion (okay well maybe I'd still have some trouble being compassionate towards killers & rapists but)."
Meditation,3d1n8l,meditationELI5,3,Mon Jul 13 12:31:21 2015 UTC,"You're angry because you know the world could be a better place and 'those people' are holding it back. If they could all reach your current understanding, the world would undoubtedly be a better place.  That anger is love. It comes from love. You being angry won't help the world. You will and should express that anger and 'let it out' in a way that is suitable for you. Once that anger is expressed you will realize to help, you have to change yourself and help to change the people around you.   The cultivating is just coming to this realization on your own (not just reading mine or anyone elses words). You can start slowly by just meditating on the idea, then slowly progress. It doesn't change overnight and you're already doing much more and 'handling' it better. Just keep going."
Meditation,3d1n8l,Wollff,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:14:17 2015 UTC,"I think metta would be a pretty usual answer here. You can find instructions for that kind of meditation everywhere on the internet, so I won't bother. I might try to describe what it looks like in this case.  In the end metta starts with a simple thought: May all beings attain happiness!  That really is one of the very few thoughts one can stand behind without reservations: When all beings are happy, that would be good. So one can honestly wish that all beings become happy, no exceptions.   During this state sometimes, like today, I start to feel this anger and/or discomfort with the materialism in our world and the obsession with getting things, including social status, etc.    Metta always goes two ways: First of all you wish that you can become happy, even though currently materialism just annoys the heck out of you. And then you can also wish that all materialists become happy. Maybe (unexpectedly) through materialism. Maybe by overcoming some hurdles along the way and seeing some deeper truth. It would be nice if they could solve all their problems and attain happiness.   And I couldn't help but think ""ugh don't you realize you're just chasing false happiness? And that trying to push away ""bad"" emotions is just keeping you in suffering?"" And I felt angry that I had to sit there witnessing them screaming these false messages and I couldn't do anything.   Again, metta goes two ways: First of all you again can wish for your own happiness. After all being angry at someone is hardly ever a happy state of mind. And then you can try to wish for the happiness of churchgoers. I hope they find the salvation they look for in Jesus, and if they don't, I hope they will find it somewhere else eventually without too much of a struggle.  It is that kind of outlook which metta meditation helps to cultivate. You are making: ""May all beings attain happiness!"", your sole philosophy of life during the time of the meditation. That often ends up feeling really nice. And that carries over to everyday life."

Most forms of meditation you can read about in a book first and then find a teacher if you want pay for instruction. Many meditation centers accept only voluntary donations often at the end of a retreat not at the beginning so  you know what it was worth to you and no one is kept away because they don't have money.  ""Pay us the money and we'll tell you the secret"" is one of the oldest scams around.  I don't trust people who operate like that.

Meditation,3cysno,clickstation,3,Sun Jul 12 03:26:39 2015 UTC,"If ""paying"" is the only distinguishing characteristics of TM, sure, I agree with you.  That is to say, if TM makes the technique freely available on their website, in text or audio or video form, where everybody can learn how to do it, and they need to pay only when they want the privilege of being guided through it, then yes, my opinion on TM would increase drastically. (Though I can't promise it would reach the positives.)  Oh, and if they also actively try to dispel the (supposedly mis-)understanding that their mantras are unique, or divine, or special in any way.. that would also help."
Meditation,3cysno,trickfield,10,Sun Jul 12 05:05:37 2015 UTC,"I've actually always been really skeptical myself and wanted to give it a try, but was put off by the money as well.   (I've done 10 day Vipassanna retreat and practiced forms of Zen and Mindfulness as well over the past 4 years)  But this is the internet and if there's information you want, you can find it.  The following link is the first half of the classes for Transcendental Meditation.  The only thing I haven't been able ot find is the advanced technique.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnS_1GGDAfI  After four years of willing myself to meditate (never really felt like it ever came easy or natural but I was determined to be consistent), I finally came across this guided TM video and it instantly changed how I completely thought about meditation.  It was so easy and natural to find that awareness within me that I couldn't believe I had spent so many years on a practice that wasn't suited for me.  On the first session, I was able to sit there effortlessly for over an hour.    I understand how charging hundreds of dollars to learn TM can seem like a total ripoff when there are other styles of meditation that offer instruction for free, but please don't let that deter you or any way think of it as the ""Scientology"" of meditation.  TM has over 350 peer-reviewed and published studies that all show similar beneficial results.   Edit:  It seems like a really consistent theme in this subreddit about how all meditation should be free and it's ridiculous to charge anyone to learn this.  I'm not sure why people seem to think this one area in the economy should be a free, public service.  This particular practice wants to preserve the sanctity of it's methods and so has to create a structure of training every single teacher identically as well as building new locations all over the world.  We pay for psychiatrists, dentists, doctors, psychologists, schools, physical trainers, sports coaches, physical therapists, surgeons, masseuses, chiropractors, and so many more areas to take care of our mind and body.....but when it comes to meditation - it seems that this sub would rather read a Wikipedia page and go from there instead of having a local place in the community that might charge you a few hundred to LEARN the practice and have it the rest of your life."
Meditation,3cysno,kryptobs2000,11,Sun Jul 12 03:54:25 2015 UTC,"I think the reason there are so many TM studies is because the TM practitioners fund them, it's generally thought/the impression I've gotten was that they're applicable to meditation in general though.

Also your post kind of reads like an advert, are you a plant?  edit: I totally agree TM is not remotely scientology though. One is a cult."

All others fall into the categories of FA or OSM but TM doesn't exactly fit either of the molds.  I hate the celebrity endorsements around it and the money, but I think the reason is that the dude who ran it after the founder stepped down, wanted to market it towards high-stressed, high-net worth and worldly influential people in some thought that that's there it would be the most far reaching effectiveness  Edit:  I think that the practice itself is a great meditation practice but it's true value (that i believe is does have) is being exploited  *Even if TM practinioners fund them and orginzations like David Lynch Foundation, those studies still have to go through a peer-review process of 400+ institutions and then get published, so the entire field has approved it"

If doctors operated on this basis (there's no way to learn except by individual apprenticeship), we would still be in the dark ages. Schools teach ALL of subjects you mentioned. Nobody teaches TM besides their robed and annoited elders.  So nobody expects people to teach TM for free, but there are presumably those who would want to share TM techniques publicly, in books and blogs. As I understand it, those people are bound by contracts and NDAs and trade-secret law on a level we don't expect from any honorable field.

Meditation,3cysno,samadhi_gee,6,Sun Jul 12 04:27:39 2015 UTC,"Yes! I have. I do it twice a day for a little under an hour each time and have taken advanced courses. I want to say first that having watched a few documentaries on scientology, the TM ""movement"" doesn't seem anything like that; although, they do have their own paradigm to understand how TM works.   If you know scientology, they're very manipulative. They start out with a sort of positive-psychological feedback therapy (dianetics) to help you get over your troubles and then take it from there to stealing more and more money from you for the cause along with making you believe in this absurd philosophy. Read about it, it's way out there.   On the other hand, I've never really felt manipulated by the TM movement. I have to say, I'm pretty catholic, so this eastern tradition stuff scared me a little. I found myself questioning TM teachers with inquiries that try to expose if it's ""culty"" or not, and then committing the strawman fallacy to convince myself that it was. One day, I finally got a chance to question one of the TM big wigs in private about it. He talked to me for about 2 hours, then at the end I realised I didn't listen to a word he said. I was listening to what I wanted to hear. Eventually, I started listening to what they were actually saying and got over my conflicts. If anything, this resolution seems like more of a self-realization than a manipulation because I feel like I've grown from it instead of being pinned down. Now, I believe what fits my paradigm and brings me greater happiness.  Another things is that each TM teacher is different, but, knowing TM teachers, they teach because they love TM, not for the money. This, however, I'd admit is an appeal to probability.  As for the cost of learning, I'd say /u/trickfield sums it up. Hope this helps!  Ps.

The TM organization itself doesn't disclose them, probably because people tend to get hung up on mantras - ""Why did you give him that mantra and not me? I'm more spiritual. I don't like my mantra, can I have another one?"" Etc.  ""Training programs given by people who have given more money than you"" - What are you referring to here? I paid $35.00 to learn TM, it was money well spent at the time.  Yes, eventually Maharishi Mahesh Yogi raised the prices; he wanted TM instructors to be able to make a living teaching, and believed the technique was undervalued. Few TM teachers could afford to do so full time though.  I think that in his late years, Maharishi became rather unglued and railed against a world that he felt didn't appreciate what he was doing. But he is gone now. His successor Tony Nader inherited a large organization and it is up to him to bring it down to earth.  It's not money, but the end result of TM that I think should be more open about. TM's result is to drive a wedge between the individual and his experience. This in order to prevent experiences from making deep impressions on the person. TM originated in the philosophy that deep impressions are what bring a person back to physical life again and again (the cycle of reincarnation).  So TM aims to prevent this. In TM this is known as Witnessing. They do explain this, but mainly in the advanced programs that the average person has little interest in."

The TM teachers really want to help the world, and to help you in particular. TM is a secular technique. How is this anything like Scientology? It seems like you just don't want to pay for quality results. That is your decision, but you must also live with it and stop complaining. Or at least find some good reasons for your complaints. Just my opinion."
Meditation,3cysno,Tqxl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:10:32 2015 UTC,"I have never been involved with the TM movement, but from what I have read and heard about them there are several pretty big problems with the organization and its mode of operation that goes beyond wether its ""working"" or if its reasonable to pay money for an education in something. I saw a clip of David Lynch comparing it to a vitamin company, in that we should be glad there is a company making money from producing vitamin pills because otherwise there would be no vitamin pills. Of course the TM movement doesn't ""produce"" meditation and it could easily be thought through a book or youtube clip or whatever, and there is no logical way to compare it with a company making tangible goods. I think this pretty much sums up what's strange with TM, that they use fallacies and empty rhetorics to warrant their way of making business. TM-practicioners also often claim that the goal of the business model is to be able to enable more people to access it, which of course isn't true. It is the only branch of meditation style that views other styles as competitors. Bob Roth gladly explains how other techniques are insufficient in comparison to TM.    The reason I feel like the TM-movement is both dishonest and somewhat cult-like is that they have a facade having charitable goals, while everything about it, including copyrights, trade secrets, aggressive marketing, vague promises of self improvement (correlating to the amount of payment you give) and unreasonable high price plans (but still claiming that ""no one is making real money of it"" while they clearly do) points to a different truth. Combine this with the fact that people who have taken their courses are fiercely trying to justify everything about the way it works with very little criticality, and it's hard not to associate some of it with scientology."
Meditation,3cysno,shizzlefritz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:44:58 2015 UTC,"I paid 250 dollars to learn TM as a 19 year old back in 1996. It changed my life  in ways I did not expect, most of which have been positive.  For example I quit smoking two days after I first learned TM and that was not even my motivator for learning.  For the first time ever I was in touch with my body enough to feel how I was poisoning it and I just did not want to smoke any more.   Six months later I got an opportunity to study Ayurvedic Medicine through that same organization (the Maharishi folk) and went overseas to study in the Netherlands for a year.  After my education was finished, I decided to walk away from working within the organization.  I found that there was a lot secrecy, a class structure almost identical to the caste system in India, and misogyny abounded.  I was a lowly white female that only practised TM (which is the bottom of their meditator ranking system). Even though I fell in love with Ayurveda and TM I would never be allowed to be a doctor within their organization because it was not my birth right, etc. After I came home I generally lost touch with the organization.  They made some effort to stay in touch as they had clinics that needed people with my particular training (Panchakarma Technician), but I was not interested and they let me be no problem.      Studying at that school was one of the best memories I have. I made tons of friends from all over the world, and I became a better person in many ways. I grew up fast in one year.  They are definitely not like Scientology.   They are good people, but they are weird and have adopted many of the sad things that exist in Indian culture, but TM comes from the Vedas and the Vedas come from India, so it is not a big surprise.  Almost 20 years later I still meditate, but learned Vipassana in 2007 and have been doing that for the last 7 years. That is a whole other story.  I think that meditation should be free. I also think it is important to have people to practice with. You need some sort of community - people to support you and inspire you. Those people do not have to be creepy."
Meditation,3cysno,SaurabhJMadan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:15:44 2015 UTC,"I have not done Transcendental meditation, so I cannot speak for the effectiveness of the practice, and neither do I know anything about Scientology. So my response is about the idea of charging money for teaching meditation.    This is really hairy and challenges many beliefs we have about money and spirituality in general.    If we think about Christian traditions, they have a concept of Tithing, where one gives 10% of their income for spiritual development of others. When I think about India, some Temples in India have millions and millions of dollars worth of gold. Donated by people for various reasons.   I have learned Meditation free of charge from a very generous organisation that does not even take donations from people who have not completed their free course. I liked this concept very much. And naturally wanted to pass on the gift. This is a very good organisation.   But I also know of others, which do not charge money, but have accused of corruption. Making money through other mean such as buying up land around their temples.   From that point of view, when I look at organizations such as Art of Living, which charge a fee for their courses, I think it is a fair and transparent system. People know what they are in for. If they agree with the exchange, they undertake it otherwise they are free to let it go.   At the end of the day, whether an organisation charges or does not charge, money is needed to run such organisations. Otherwise, they would never be able to have the impact they have on the world. If they do not charge money, how are they expected to carry out their work?   We must also note that as a culture, we are a very different people than we were two thousand years ago. I have read that when Gautam Buddha went from Village to Village, 10,000 monks would accompany him, but wherever he went, he was welcomed and his people fed because the people of that time recognised the value of what he gave in return.   In today's time, I have heard a very famous spiritual master share his own journey. When he started teaching his technique in the 60s, people would leave the course mid way, not valuing what they were getting for free. For us, money determines how much we value something.   See the example of the Diamond industry. I have heard that there was a deliberate effort to increase the price of diamonds much beyond what they were worth at that time. The current value is man-made. A diamond is not actually any better than an equally shiny piece of glass, but its perceived value (created in our minds) makes us save for months to buy one (if you decide to buy one). Have we every wondered ... is <some diamond company> the Scientology of Diamond merchants? Or is OPEC the Scientology the Oil products? Why do we not expect other products to be given for free?   Is meditation any less valuable than a diamond? Om Mani Padme Om? So why does this question arise so vehemently in spiritual dialogue? It even arises inside me ... and I do not have an answer.   One thing I feel is that we elevate spirituality above the rest of life. We think that meditation is beyond all that there is and so it should be priceless. Whereas the essence of spirituality is to be ordinary. to be just normal. Why make Meditation anything above a commodity that is sold in the market? But I am not sure I have found the right answer.    Personally, I do not (as of today) charge to teach meditation to anyone.   Here are some videos about Osho that touches this aspect. It is another point of view to consider: I Am the Rich Man's Guru ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0O9IK8bxM8 )"
Meditation,3d01z1,Deezigner,5,Sun Jul 12 09:53:05 2015 UTC,"I've met someone who researches nonsymbolic experience, which refers to the same thing as ""enlightenment"" or ""awakening"". He has a long paper on the subject, describing what are the states of this trait and how this knowledge was gleaned. (It was interviews. Lots and lots of interviews. And once he met someone that really did appear to be in a ""nonsymbolic"" state, he asked if they had friends that were in a similar state. Then interviewed the friends.)  Paper here: http://nonsymbolic.org/PNSE-Article.pdf  And I could tell you what it was for me when I had a temporary experience of that state, but it wouldn't necessarily be the same for you. Experiences abound. I think one commonality is detachment. I.e., you're not so invested in things anymore, instead just letting things happen. That doesn't mean you give up--for example, you might still work very hard at something, but you know that if you don't succeed, it'll be absolutely fine. Not the bullshit ""don't worry"" that people comfort themselves with, but being as content with failure as with success. That doesn't mean you can't work hard at it anyway."
Meditation,3d01z1,sleepycorn,2,Sun Jul 12 10:36:20 2015 UTC,"I am skeptical that this research actually measures enlightenment. It measures psychological characteristics and ignores realization. It's like saying we can understand how to play chess by measuring the psychological characteristics of a chess master. Or worse it is like saying we can create chess masters by reproducing their psychological characteristics. Unless you examine the knowledge of a chess master you are not really getting at the essence of a chess master. Unless you examine the realization causing enlightenment you are not getting at the essence of enlightenment.  It makes sense from a psychologist's point of view, that the use of enlightenment is the improvement in well being, but it is not necessarily correct to say that improvements in well being equate to insights into the true nature of reality. Some people might be attracted to meditation because they want to improve well being and they could benefit from this research. However other people might be attracted to meditation because they are interested in the true nature of reality and they might be misled by this research."

I know a lot of people feel that way without even meditating. I expected something more specific.

Meditation,3d01z1,sleepycorn,3,Sun Jul 12 10:56:21 2015 UTC,"""I feel good right now and that's more than enough"". Im not sure if it's what they call an enlightenment though.   According to Jeffery Martin (the researcher I mentioned above), deep contentment (fundamental okay-ness, all the way down) is indeed the best indicator of whether someone has transitioned to a nonsymbolic state. Personally, I don't see why the two are related. (More on that below.)   I expected something more specific.   Okay, I can tell you about my experience. I accepted (and for the most part, remembered) that what we conventionally think of the ""self"" does not exist. However, something was incomplete, since I kept forgetting this fact and needing to remind myself (and try to reinforce this new outlook). The significance of this experience was that I believed it in my gut (mostly), rather than just as a conceptual fact. This freed me from worrying about what other people thought of me, how people treated me, what happened to me in the past, what would happen to me in the future. I continued to have thoughts, but I frequently dropped them, because they were not interesting. Do you spend all day thinking about Professor Snape? No, because he's imaginary and not very significant. So when I found myself thinking about myself (what someone said to me or what I might do in a certain situation), I realized it was silly. It's not very interesting to think about stories and eventualities about an imaginary character. I dropped the thoughts and returned to the present moment (visual/auditory sensations mostly), which was much more interesting. That's not to say I was present all the time--I don't think my brain is physically wired for that.  To sum up the above, normally my thoughts are like a dream. I realized that actually, my thoughts were a dream of a dream, too far abstracted from reality, and thus not important.  Another thing is that I felt really happy and contented. The contentment was a type of detachment. Nothing was a big deal. I could not imagine something being a big deal, because none of it affected me (there was no me for it to affect). The happiness was different from other times I've been happy, since it was born of no stimulus. It was not the excitement of having performed well on stage, nor the joy of something good happening. I don't know where it came from or what caused it. I didn't see why my new outlook would directly cause happiness, but there it was.  During this experience, I was ""being"", instead of ""being me"". In these states, people find different concepts to be more meaningful than usual, so we tend to invent words that don't exist in English. This is why you sometimes read books/blogs that say ""being-ness"" or ""is-ness"". Because someone feels 'What I feel is what I am, and what I am is whatever's happening (""is""), without any agent at the center.' That's an important concept that has no single word in English. Although all concepts were diminished in importance. Ideas are not directly knowable. So they don't matter much. What is directly knowable? Being-ness. Okay, what that means is the sense of being at this place at this time, feeling whatever feelings exist at this moment. Past, future, and other places are just concepts. So why think about them so much?  This doesn't restrict you from thinking in classical ways, though. A good friend of mine also had a temporary awakening experience, a week or two apart from mine. He told me not to put a plate next to the stove since it was going to get really hot. Without missing a beat, I countered, ""But I thought you said there is only Now?"" He just said trust me, it'll be hot."

Then ask yourself whether the thought knows the touch or can feel the touch. Or whether the thought is aware of the touch.   When enlightened, you will know that neither the sensation knows the thought nor the thought the sensation.   Think of the implications of this. ""I feel this sensation"" no longer makes sense because how can thoughts sense objects."

Enlightenment means just seeing that there is no one controlling your life. That's the event. But afterwards it takes time for the body to learn how to function with that. For me, after the event happened it was just the same as before but all was in a state of flow.  Then things needed further looking and I was fluctuating up and down between normal state(usually depressive) and complete happiness. In terms of mere practicality it might not be worth to pursue enlightenment. Because it's a very long process nothing like what they describe online.  You've probably read a thousand times that it's the seeing of the true nature of yourself - namely that you are a thought. But that's only the event it takes time for the happiness to stabilize.  There's no way you wouldn't know it when it happens. It's other worldly. However, you don't just stop worrying the moment you become enlightened. And the curse is that you still might try to get into past states and this further creates complications.  Enforcing the ego and doership."

If you google it you can find instructions on how to reach the first Jhana. I'm guessing that the path to enlightenment is similar to that. You just need guidance by somebody who knows the path.  To answer your question I don't think enlightenment is a simply a deep meditation. I think it's actively cultivating a state of mind and working towards a specific goal with the help of a teacher.

In Sufi terms there is a distinction between hal (peak experience) and makkam (where you are overall in the journey of realization). Meditation is a means by which you cultivate the experience of unity (samadhi). It takes many such experiences for that knowledge to sink into your being, affecting your personality and the way you relate to others. Ken Wilber talks about ""waking up"" (meaning having peak experiences) vs. ""growing up"" (the longer term work of reflecting what you have realized in your being). I do not know of any scientific evidence of any of this... but of course, very little of what matters in the human experience can be measured -- is there scientific evidence of love?

What it was like was coming so close to losing any sense of individuality that at first I was terrified and then incredibly relieved that I could let go of all of it, all my petty worries, fears, desires, lusts, and aspirations. And not just a cognitive mental experience but somatic too, and it was the body trip that stuck with me more than the mental gymnastics I did.

It can be a side-effect of a consistent practice, but it's not the objective. If you go into your practice thinking you'll come out calm and relaxed, you'll likely be disappointed.  It can help with your stress, but it does that by cultivating awareness of what's happening in your mind, and teaching you to notice and not ""blindly"" follow the thoughts and emotions that culminate in conditioned behaviors leading to struggles such as stress. This is treating the root cause, where ""relaxation techniques"" only treat the symptoms.  I posted a link to a free guide in this comment - it's a great place to start.

As you let go, often it feels like the body is re-balancing its energy. When we integrate this redistribution of energy into our system, it may take a while for us to get our bearing and feel grounded. Often a walk on solid ground outside, preferably barefoot, will help you feel more stable and less out of sorts. Sometimes a strong feeling will occur, but if you don't grasp after it, or try to repress it, it eventually goes away. As you practice meditation, it is good to have contact with a teacher. A good teacher will be able to offer useful advice on the sort of experiences you are having. Lots of interesting things are occurring during your meditation, thank you for sharing with us!"

But still.. it's odd to me that this happens every single time, especially considering that during this time I am solely focused on detaching from the part of my mind that cares about things like time and things of that sort.

Meditation,3cxqwk,neversayaword,2,Sun Jul 12 02:36:42 2015 UTC,"Here's two possible explanations (I'm sure there are tons more):  1) Your unconscious mind:  People can program themselves to wake up without their alarms.  This is because the unconscious aspect of minds doesn't sleep and is aware of everything going on.  So, on some level, you know about when you alarm is going to go off and get signals right before.  2)Quantum theory:  kind of goes hand in hand with the unconscious mind explanation, simply put:  you're connected to all information.  You're true/""quantum"" self isn't bound by the limitations of your limited ego identity.  Therefore, when you meditate and dissolve your limited ego self, you get inclinations of information from your deeper being.  I'm not advocating either answer - just two interesting possibilities to consider."

But when you are priming YOU really aren't controlling your thoughts either.  You can observe that if you would like.  I don't think it is worth thinking that much over.  Priming is real and powerful.  If it helps you you should definitely utilize it.  Perhaps, you could prime yourself to be more mindful."

Meditation,3cxdiq,Wollff,3,Sun Jul 12 00:22:03 2015 UTC,"I ask because mindfulness meditation is based in the idea that we can't control thoughts/emotions and that we should simply let them be as they are.   What you say is not wrong, but I think you are placing a strange emphasis here: Mindfulness meditation is originally a practice which aims toward the realization that there is nobody who controls our thoughts and emotions.   But priming suggests that we CAN influence some thoughts/emotions - and that it might even be in our best interest to attempt to do so as long as it's in the correct way.   First of all, priming is not special. Influencing emotions is easy. Read a good novel, and even other people can influence your emotions. When you write yourself a post-it with ""SMILE!"" on it, and you look at it every morning, you are influencing yourself from the past. And when you actually smile, that is probably not a bad thing.   Staying aware of the fact that we can't directly force certain thoughts/emotions would still be necessary.    But you can. Think of a Cockroach. Congratulations, you have just forced a certain thought. Ever tried loving-kindness meditation? I can only recommend it. With that practice you force yourself to love the whole world (well, more or less).  What mindfulness meditation is about, is the realization of what is actually happening when you think, feel, or do something. We often regard thinking (or feeling, or doing) as there being a thinker, who controls what is being thought.  When it's actually more like a river. It flows. With the current some stones move. That changes the current. Which might make some stones move again..."

Not sure if that makes sense, and I agree with /u/dczx in that I don't believe in methods, just time and practice and finding what works for you."
Meditation,3cymo3,superoriginal1234,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:49:18 2015 UTC,"Hold your breath until it feels mildly uncomfortable, then let yourself breath. That will make the ""natural"" breathing signals stronger.  Make sure you aren't sitting in a way that restricts your breathing. Make sure your clothing is not restricting your breathing.  Try to relax all the muscles in your chest and abdomen.  Try to breathe deliberately just by inhaling from the diaphragm and exhaling by relaxing the diaphragm so the inhalations and inhalations are about the same length. Don't tighten the abdominal muscles when you exhale. Don't tighten the chest muscles when you inhale. If you breathe this way you are doing very little to interfere with the natural breathing and it might be easier to switch over to natural breathing. If you breathe this way while meditating, you might switch over to natural breathing without realizing it.  It might help to make sure your diaphragm is completely relaxed before inhaling.  But I do control my breathing while meditating because it is more relaxing.   https://sites.google.com/site/chs4o8pt/meditation-1#meditation_serenity   If you are stressed your ""natural"" breathing could be contributing to maintaining stress. For example when ""natural"" breathing is very rapid."

Meditation,3cxctq,shqualhla1,2,Sat Jul 11 16:49:18 2015 UTC,"That's a good sign of progress. Go with it!   Side note, if the forehead pressure is a thing, I recommend adding more relaxation to your practice. Notice how each thought that arises brings a teeny tension to your body (either your head, chest, eyes,...), and relax that as soon as you see it. Just like unclenching a fist. Keep doing that and you'll get more of the good stuff and continue to go deeper.   Also, instead of focusing really hard on the breath, try a lighter focus. More of a constant awareness of what the breath is doing, without being too single-pointed.   A little fear is normal, especially the first couple times reaching a new ""signpost""... Don't worry. And yes, losing sensation in your body and floating around, feeling like you're about to fall off a cliff -- all good stuff, keep it up. :-)"

Meditation,3cxctq,Dispassionfruit,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:35:18 2015 UTC,"It could be! Jhana has a few ""factors"" that show up including (for the first jhana) pleasure/bliss (tingles?), excitement, sudden ease keeping your attention on your object (breath in your case), equanimity, and others. Each progressive jhana has different factors. In the 5th jhana (aka ""infinite space""), you feel no more body, and like your mind is expanding, going out and out and out... Pretty cool. :-) takes a lot of relaxing to hit that.   If you're interested, Bhante Vimalaramsi has some good down-to-earth talks on YouTube about it, where he reads suttas and comments in more modern words on what they mean. (At least, I haven't found any other teachers that are as pragmatic about jhana, though there must be some out there.)"

Meditation,3cyc06,arya000111,6,Sat Jul 11 21:57:21 2015 UTC,"Okay my advice from experience, is that as a beginner you should not try to force detachment. What usually happens when beginners focus on ""detaching"" is that, since they aren't familiar enough with what true detachment feels like, they instinctively attempt to detach by pushing away their thoughts. Which is the opposite of what we want in meditation.  Instead of focusing on detachment, focus on acceptance. Accepting your thoughts, whichever ones come up. Focus on just allowing them to be there. Don't get involved. And if you find that you did get involved, notice that, and allow that thought too.   When you get used to accepting all of your thoughts (& feelings, & whatever else), detachment occurs naturally as a result of that. You let everything be there without interfering or struggling, thus a sense of detachment is achieved.   ""The chatter does not stay away for long and the calmness is lost very fast"" This means you're chasing the calm, which is a rookie mistake that I also made. You're not meditating ""to be calm"". Whether or not you achieve this calmness, you should still be willing to meditate. Let go of any expectation of how you should feel - that's clinging. Instead accept everything. And accept it again. And again.  Detachment & calmness will follow in time."

Meditation,3cyc06,Solieus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:00:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your advice. What I have been trying to do is not drive away the thoughts but not get involved in it or respond to it. What I mean by the chatter is that I am constantly responding to my thoughts.  For eg. Say my entire head space is a classroom and my thoughts make it a very noisy classroom. I am not trying to reduce the noise  or forbid any other noisy person from coming in.I just want to watch that noise and not add to it further. I do not know if I have been able to explain-I do not really have a good analogy for this :)  What I am trying to say is that I am ok with my thoughts-ugly, good, bad whatever. I just do not want to participate or talk back to it which is currently what I am doing."
Meditation,3cyc06,nani_kore,2,Sun Jul 12 04:09:07 2015 UTC,"I see. Well when you find yourself talking back to them automatically, then allow that too. Think, ""this is chatter."" Then continue to let the chatter keep going, or even get louder if it wants to. Or if it stops, let it stop. Just let it be there when it wants to be, as intensely or as softly as it wants to be. Even if you're adding to it unintentionally. Treat it the same way.  The idea of meditation is to let go of absolutely everything going on your head, and simply let it all be. That includes any chatter that's talking back to the original thoughts.   What you'll eventually find is that upon truly letting go of anything that happens mentally, you become wholly connected with the observer. The part of your experience that's pure consciousness, absolutely nonjudgmental, clings to nothing, and just simply watches and allows everything to be as it is.   The observer is the ultimate state of consciousness because it applies absolutely NO expectations or biases or judgments towards what it sees. It simply sees.   ""I should stop replying back to my thoughts! I'm not supposed to be chattering while meditating!"" <-- these are judgments. ""It's so noisy in my head already, I don't want to add more."" <--- that's a judgment too."
Meditation,3cyc06,shortCakeSlayer,2,Sun Jul 12 04:59:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not amazing at this yet, but what's really seemed to help me is having something to focus on, that I can bring my attention back to when I find my thoughts wandering or intruding. Again, my thoughts still totally wander, but using a guided meditation where I can focus my thoughts on a human voice giving me instructions or inspirations on what to visualize helps.  ALSO, doing some yogic pranyama exercises helps, especially if you're counting breaths. I do this one sometimes at the end of a class that's later in the afternoon or evening (the 6-second breath or longer is good for activating the parasympathetic nervous system and shutting off the stress response after a long day.)   Sit comfortably and begin breathing deeply, consciously filling up your belly and letting it fall slack as the breath comes in and goes out.  Began focusing on your breath; notice how long each inhale and exhale lasts.  Try inhaling for four seconds, holding the breath for a second, and exhaling for four seconds.  After a few breaths, increase the duration of each inhale and exhale by a second, with a second of held breath in-between.  Increase again another second.  Continue this pattern until you feel you've reached the apex of how many seconds you can extend the inhale and exhale; then slowly begin taking a second off your inhalation/exhalation, coming back down to four seconds.   I've moved my breath retention up to 9/10 second inhales and exhales easily, and I think focusing on counting keeps me in the present and helps keep those thoughts from intruding. Someday I may be able to just breath without even counting. <3"

That ""you"" don't listen, but sounds freely come and go from your experience with nothing done by yourself - no ""you"" who is hearing sounds - just sounds coming and going.   Then you may notice how body sensations come and go in a similar way.  Then you may even notice how things in your visual experience will come and go.  Then perhaps you will notice that thoughts come and go...just like the sounds, body sensations and sights."
Meditation,3cxa9i,puglex,2,Sat Jul 11 16:26:37 2015 UTC,"The best tip I can give is that until you stop viewing it as a chore or another item on your ""to-do list,"" you'll have a hard time developing a consistent practice.  If, instead, you fully understand and internalize the compulsive nature of your mind and the problems it creates in your life, you will come to view it as a way of being. A critical aspect of this view is transferring what you do while meditating to your ""non-meditating"" time - i.e., you work to keep yourself grounded in the present moment and bring mindfulness to what you are doing when you're not on the cushion.  As far as posture, you need to work on correcting it - and not just for your practice! Do you not have something to support your back while meditating? A chair with a straight back? Or, sit on the floor with your back against the wall.   Also note that discomfort is part of the practice - you can view the pain just like anything else that arises in consciousness. See it come and go, and recognize that it - like everything - is temporary. Don't identify with it, don't build a story around it. Just let it be as it is, independent from you and your attention."

I'm only young (22) but most of my life (and my current job) is spent slouched in front of a computer. I do have access to straight back chairs, but the meditation course says to ""come away from the back of the chair so the spine can be self supporting"" which I always had trouble with. It's a constant battle of slouching, realising I'm slouching, then sitting up straight again which takes me away from the breath. Maybe I would be better off just resting against the back of the chair."
Meditation,3cxa9i,elphabaloves,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:26:52 2015 UTC,"You have to take baby steps - you are a self-admitted sloucher(!), so start trying to correct your posture by sitting properly and using the chair as it was meant to be used.   When you master that, then you can work on being ""self supporting"" without the aid. Does that make sense?  Having the support as you are correcting your posture won't hinder your practice at all (I say this with 20 years of experience as a practitioner and teacher).  Best of luck - PM me if you ever think I can help.  PS - start sitting better at work too. You'll thank me in 10 years!"
Meditation,3cxa9i,Siejj,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:34:02 2015 UTC,"One the tips I've gotten from this website that has helped me the most is this: ""It's harder to go from 0 to 1 minute a day than to go from 1 to 15 minutes a day""  Meditation is most effective when done daily, so the most important thing to begin with is simply establishing the habit. After receiving this advice i meditated for 5 minutes (too short forme to say ""oh well i dont have time or energy for that!"")twice a day, (before and after sleep) for a couple of weeks. After that it was easy to build up to 10 and 15 because my brain was already used to the idea of sitting at those times  hope this helps!"

I think part of the problem was that I was jumping straight into this program, which required about 20 minutes a day straight off the bat. Later on it increased to about 45 minutes and that was when I usually dropped off.

More importantly, do not make it a chore, and do not put up expectations for meditating, as if you were going to be enlightened faster by meditating more. Not saying that's your goal, just making an example.  6 hours a day is a lot, while 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the evening is more reasonable if you're an intermediate.

Meditation,3cwh0w,IHazOwies,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:09:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it depersonalization simply because it has negative associations to it, and I think it is mostly referred to as part of a psychosis. If that is how you interpret it, I understand that you may want to get rid of it, but see if you can decide whether it is simply a dampening of your ego, or is actually an undesirable phenomenon that is occuring to you. Either way, I think anyone would benefit from balancing their practice by doing both types of meditation.

Perhaps evaluate how you want to live your life. Do you want to be in a total meditative state constantly (it seems like you don't)?

For example, say your life partner dies unexpectedly. A period of grief and mourning is probably normal and healthy, but eventually you need to  get on with the business of living.

Setting up thoughts as some sort of enemy, trying to ""completely ignore them"", I cannot see this being of any benefit.   You should have a wise relationship towards the natural process of thinking. There is nothing wrong with it. Meditation is about learning to sit and observe. Its about learning equanimity   Think on this; where is your intention coming from? Is it coming from a place that feels desperate and full of anxiety? Trust me when I say that attempting anything while coming from a place like that will do no good, and in fact might be of harm. You should have the intention of wanting to understand yourself, of wanting to understand the feeling tone that underlies these thoughts and fuels them. Simply and kindly just observing yourself can do a lot of good.   I've had some wrong attitudes with meditation in the past, and let me tell you, it only ends in pain and confusion. Please don't try to have some sort of battle against your thinking.   I would suggest you read this little book, that might at least give you a different perspective on what meditation can be. It's specifically about Right Attitude when beginning a meditation practice, and the context is Theravada/Vipassana, which is about learning to observe and understand the processes of mind and feelings and body, not fighting with them. Please give it a read and see if any of the mindsets might help you.   Here's part one  Part two  Part three  And the sequel (They are pdfs)  I truly wish that you can find some peace and happiness. Remember, be kind to yourself, and give yourself time. The hard feelings are like clouds floating past, and the sun is shining behind them."

Instead, just notice whatever arises in consciousness and let it be as it is, independent of you and your attention.  Garbage, good stuff, negative, positive - none of the labels matter."

Meditation,3ct0nm,irs320,16,Fri Jul 10 17:15:06 2015 UTC,"my teacher said the conceptual mind is always mistaken, not wrong, not garbage, just not an accurate representation of reality because it causes us to go through life with all these biases and filters, which severely limits our ability experience life firsthand.   my personal take is that this benefited us in pre-agricultural periods out of self preservation, but over the years as we've evolved into a purely analytical disembodied society, the rational mind has totally spiraled out of control and we're living this second hand representation of life based on symbols and mistaken predetermination, which keep us from fully experiencing this reality as was intended. i think the prevalence of ptsd and anxiety and depression nowadays is pretty good proof of that.  it's not about shutting off your thoughts, you couldn't shut them off if you tried. they'll always be there and thank god for that. it's about not identifying with them so heavily and not taking your own storyline about yourself and the world so seriously. when you start to develop that quality then it really opens you up to live with a tremendous sense of freedom."

We're always caught up in what we want and what other people have, it drives you crazy. When really you need to turn that off, or at least ignore it. Appreciate the present and instead find things to be happy about in the moment. Ultimately we have more control over how we feel than our thoughts might dictate. I'm not sure if I'm getting the right message, but I did feel a brief sense of liberation at the revelation that I don't need that fancy car and that big house with a beautiful wife for one moment, I can be perfectly happy on my own if I choose to be. Maybe that's the message, I don't know. I still think I'd be better off with that stuff, and I can't shake those materialistic views and wants that society bombards us with every day. Yet I know that if I had that, if this line of thinking continues then I'll only find new things to worry about and I'll be just as unhappy."

So you're not ruled by your thoughts and you won't be taken down a path you don't want to go down, like a depressive thought cycle or one than invokes anger. I think I might understand, can meditation really do this? Give you complete control like that? I'm sure it's limited though, I don't see how you'll be able to completely stop feeling horrible if something horrible happens to you."

Meditation,3ct0nm,princemoutai,2,Fri Jul 10 17:47:34 2015 UTC,"I experienced a very visceral breakthrough to this kind of thinking through meditation. I've had increasingly anxious thinking and was diagnosed as having mild PTSD - my anxious brain would chatter away constantly (and never say anything productive) and it was making day-to-day life pretty difficult.  Through a lot of reading and a lot of practice, I realized that the voice wasn't me, and then I went one step deeper. My thoughts went something like this:  Anxious Voice: ""But I'm never going to get this work finished in time! My life is slowly spiraling out of control!""  Me: ""That voice is not me.""  Anxious Voice: ""But look at all this shit! This presentation needs to be finished tomorrow! This place is a mess, too! I'm screwed!""  Me: ""That voice is not me. This is me. That voice is just thoughts in my head. I don't have to do that, I don't actually have to think.""  [Anxious Voice goes silent for a moment]  Other Voice (no longer anxious): ""Hang on, if this voice just thoughts, then what are you?""  ?: ...  At this point my mind just stopped. I realized that ""my"" thoughts were the same in nature as the anxious voice, and that I was DELIBERATELY thinking anxious thoughts... and I didn't have to do either of those.  Also cue cataclysmic understanding that my thoughts, ideas and identity are mine but not ME. They are a product of the workings of my mind, and after taking a couple of steps back I saw that I was really the living thing 'behind' the mind - this is all that ""watcher/observer"" business people are always on about.  It was intense - I was absolutely dumbstruck by the realization that thinking is completely optional. I try to sit peacefully like this for 10 mins a day now - I still get caught up in anxious thinking, but I'm getting better at catching myself and remembering that I actually don't have to participate in those thoughts if I don't want to.  I also found the book ""Power of Now"" very useful for putting a bit of a framework around it and a couple of other things to work on - I reckon you'll find it a useful read.   Hope this helps!"

I also think you're not getting a taste of actual reality if you're mellowed out all the time. Losing my way occasionally, losing the benefits of meditation, etc is part of the process."
Meditation,3cv39n,iamadogforreal,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:09:12 2015 UTC,"I think this is something a bit different. Many people have difficulties sticking to a schedule. I too, sometimes, don't want to meditate within the schedule I have. Sometimes, I'm just too tired in the morning, or in the evening, or I just don't have enough time before/after my lunch. Sometimes, I come home from a party, somewhat drunk, and I definitely don't want to meditate. How is it then another attachment? People who smoke to keep other drugs away need to smoke. They can't ""not smoke"". A lot of people sticking to schedule have to force themselves to meditate. That's a part of it though. If you never do anything uncomfortable, you'll be stuck at one place and never go anywhere else with your sitting, if you ask me. Discipline, too, isn't a ""have it"" or ""don't have it"" thing. One trains his/her discipline when sticking to a schedule and that's important too, in my mind. (just something like 2 months ago, I had to study for 4 weeks 8 hours a day - I was really glad for my focus then).  What's more, ""actual reality"" and ""mellowed out"" are somewhat...

Meditation,3cw28r,clickstation,2,Sat Jul 11 06:46:30 2015 UTC,"Possibly. More, that I have a lot of repressed memories, feelings, thoughts, etc, not only from growing up with an abusive alcoholic mother, but also being in combat in Fallujah in 2004 during some of the worst fighting. I've done a lot of cognitive processing therapy to help adjust some of the conscious thought patterns that contribute to my PTSD, but I still fall into bouts of depression, dissociation, or hyperarousal when triggered or really stressed out.  I have a dear friend who's a shamanic practitioner who I started working with before she moved, just to access and begin healing those subconscious aspects of my experiences.  Yoga and meditation has helped, but the idea of journeying, for me, is more about trying to gently re-access those places that have been ""cut off"" because of trauma, resulting in the symptoms I experience consciously.   I honestly thought a generic ""ancestors"" meditation would be relatively safe, as getting pregnant made me think twice about doing any deep subconcious work until after my son is born and my hormones are stable and everyone is sleeping well enough to handle the shifts that kind of work can bring on. Maybe just no journeying at all until my son is born? Do you have some good references where I could learn a bit more about metta meditation?  A lot of my meditations before I got into journeying were focused on breathing and breath retention and some chakra balancing, so I don't know a lot about Metta or other buddhist meditations."

Even though it's a guided meditation, it would be a good practice to start with the boundaries of what you want to accomplish, see, or why you are doing the meditation. Without setting a clear intention you may be set adrift at any time with pressing issues from the past. Especially since you are pregnant, you obviously don't want to be in a state that may create stress on yourself or baby."

And I've never had an hour session with zero, zero consciousness, as in zero fleeting thoughts that are even a microsecond.  I for some reason I highly doubt that most mediators at this level can achieve this.  So you are saying you can go an hour without ever seeing yourself even begin to form a thought, I'm not only talking about conscious thought, I even am talking about the subconscious, such as when people think to breath in and out, that is conscious thought, but to see that the act of thinking these thoughts is the subconscious. You are saying you can do an hour not even thinking of that? I can't find that easily to accept as possible for almost most meditators I've learnt from or the ones here,  please let me know!"

Meditation,3cuavx,theelevenses,5,Fri Jul 10 20:57:58 2015 UTC,"I can see it as a root cause for much of the way I generally act and the source of a lot of suffering.   I absolutely agree. Whenever I closely observe what I think about, it really is a lot of thought motivated by fear.  I find fear itself very interesting, but it is obvious to me that many facets of it are a little too sensitive for the time we live in.  I remember a little self test I did some time ago.   When I was young I was horribly scared by some scene of a horror movie I happened to stumble upon. Due to my very active imagination, being alone in a dark place I did not know was always profoundly frightening and if possible avoided entirely.   This is a sort of survival mechanism of life, which was kickstarted in an unnatural way and had haunted me ever since.  Until I decided I had enough of this aspect of my life. When I moved to a new appartment, I took the plunge against my fear.  One night, at about 2 AM I stood up, took my keys, went into the dark hallway and went 2 floors up to the attic. The attic is a very spacey area where people usually hang their laundry, it also has about 5 tiny windows and is pitch black at night. I'm talking darkness in which you can not see your hands even when you wave them in front of your face. (well for about a minute or two, then you can make out rough shapes and dim light at the windows)  I took a deep breath and opened the attic's door, stared into the abyss and went in. I shut the door and there it was, complete silence and darkness. Your eyes become entirely useless. I was actually scared and nervous I had never thought that it would be this intense. Every noise was amplified, the sensations on my skin were pronounced and distinct. I was very conscious of my surroundings, but I could not move any deeper into the darkness.  It was fascinating. Minute by minute I could feel the fear receding and almost vanishing entirely.  What followed was a time in my life that was very different from life ""before"" the experiment. I still have my imagination running wild from time to time, but I now know I can simply investigate my fear to see the illusion.  This was a very intersting question, thank you"
Meditation,3cuavx,datTrapezius,3,Fri Jul 10 22:36:04 2015 UTC,"We have distracting thoughts because the nature of the mind is to think.  There wouldn't be much point to vipassana if we stayed on the breath.  I am of the mind that vipassana is a state rather than a meditation method.  If we have a stick with vipassana on one end and samadhi on the other we cannot pickup the stick without picking up both of them but I digress.   Yes. Fear or not remember that the thoughts are not you.  We don't own them, they don't belong to anyone, they arise from conditions and when conditions cease they pass away.    Have you tried sitting for an hour or two?  It's a different experience in that there is much more time for thoughts to settle.  If we fill a jar with water and mud then shake it up it takes a while for the mud to fall to the bottom then the rest of the water is crystal clear.  We get to observe the experiences dispassionately through clearer lenses.    Pleasant journey"

Meditation,3cvqr6,probablyawalrus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:27:19 2015 UTC,"There are several versions of Vipassana method. It's best to choose one and learn it well. So the answer to your question isn't absolute — we can't say ""you do such-and-such"", we can only say ""well, according to such-and-such teacher or tradition, you do such-and-such.""  I'll leave the advice to those who have practiced successfully with the method described in Mindfulness In Plain English. If you mix methods you will likely encounter times (perhaps every session) when you are forced to decide between which method you apply. This means that your discursive thought and preference start to gain sway over the process. You should be clear on the method and on your chosen object of meditation when you sit down to apply yourself to practice."

That means a moment where you can fully apply your mind to observing sensations without mental chatter.   If you have momentary concentration then just start paying attention to sensations arise and pass away. Start looking at sensations as having a beginning middle and end then try to observe all three. Then notice how mental intention leads to action and how actions result in intentions and thoughts. Try and observe every intention and every action and vice versa.  Mindfulness of breathing:   Focus on the breath.   A. Pick either a physical sensations (e.g: the rise and fall of the abdomen, the breath passing through the nose, the breath passing the tip of the nose, etc... ), a mental concept (""in"" and ""out"", or a point in space that the breath passes, or the process of the rising and falling of the abdomen, etc... ) or both. The mind will begin to wander. When you notice it has (a moment of mindfulness) return focus to the breath. Rinse and repeat."

Meditation,3cvxut,TheHeartOfTuxes,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:28:42 2015 UTC,"Buckwheat cushions tend to offer more firm support, but if they are not absolutely stuffed full (and thus hard and heavy) they can shift when you change your posture. Really you have to try it out yourself. A buckwheat cushion can be adjusted by pushing the filling to one part of the cushion; and you may consider that flexibility an advantage or a disadvantage depending on your needs.  An overstuffed kapok cushion will tend to be more stable. Some cushions will have a flap rather than a fully sewn seam, so you can stuff more kapok in to suit your needs. In this scenario, you have one cushion shape to work with, for better or worse. Because of this, you might also consider what shape would work best for you: round, rectangle, crescent, wedge, domed, flat.... All of these shapes, and more, are available on the market.  Sitting on the front edge of your cushion will help relieve pressure on the nerve at the back of the thigh. This positioning tends to equalize cushion shapes, as it doesn't matter as much what's behind you when your sit-bones have found their place on the front edge.  Cotton tends to settle and harden with use, until it finds its own resting place. If it happens to be at your ideal height and hardness this can be very stable, but there's less adjusting possible with cotton.  Many meditators use a combination of cushions; and this is also common in traditional use (for example in some Japanese and Korean temples). A round zafu may be used with either a wedge or a rectangular cotton support cushion underneath. The rectangular cushion can either be placed fully under the round one, or at the back edge where it can function in a similar way to the wedge, angling the upper cushion down to the front. In places where both cushions are available, more flexible people (usually indigenous Asians) may use only the single shallow support cushion; and some pile up two of them instead of using a round zafu.  I'll just mention that the 'old school' approach is to train the body to adapt to the seat, and to gradually reduce the amount of support needed. One teacher-monk I practiced with encouraged me to frequently reduce the amount of support I use for sitting, five minutes at a time. The aim was to eventually be able to sit comfortably without a cushion at all. (I haven't taken him up on the recommendation... yet.)"

My other advice would be to add in some others - like mantra and visualizations - to balance the sometimes more hardcore self-inquiry ones.

Well, we're all on the journey of finding medicines for our individual afflictions, so what works for me will not necessarily work for you. Again, a good (in person) teacher sounds boring when you start, but is a little akin to a doctor versus ""medicine over the internet"".   Mantra can be a great way to really experience non-effort... it's a state that is neither ""slack"" (our normal minds), nor ""too tight"" (normal effort in meditation). I personally have found the techniques in /r/nondirective and tantra very useful.   There are very, very powerful self-inquiry practices, but it depends on the traditions you are interested in. And most of the good ones will wait until you're ready before they pull out the big guns! A school like FPMT.org or Rigpa might  be two recommended places to go within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition for these."

Meditation,3cuzc6,Madredchris,2,Sat Jul 11 00:10:35 2015 UTC,"Hi!  I feel generous now, sharing some of the insights as I found happiness. But I have to tell you that if you are just simply curious you will not find anything worthwhile. When your whole being is telling you to go for it, then it is the right time.  Don't do meditation for any goal, or to reach any goal. It may seem strange, because we are taught and conditioned to make goals and become something.   The goal is the issue, that keeps us in anxiety. Meditation is an effort to let go of the goal, so that we can be relaxed and happy.   Moving forward in life will take you further away from your center. You try to rush somewhere. Are you in a hurry before death? Meditation is here and now, relaxing for no purpose.   The way to really move forward is to move inward. Don't look for concentration. Meditation is not concentration, it is a non-focus, openness to everything. Although if you find inner silence then there will be no issue to use the mind when you need it.  When the mind is the master then you are in confusion and with a full mind. Through letting go of goals, coming back to relaxation, watching your thoughts without judgement. Knowing that if you can watch your thoughts then you are not them, you are the watcher. Just following your breath. Letting go of being serious, and start being more playful.   Dancing is a great way of being in this present moment. Just bring more awareness to your minds function, while remaining seperate from it, a watcher. The more awareness you bring the less thoughts will be in your mind. If you can catch the space between two thoughts then you will know that you are not your mind."
Meditation,3cu6co,pleasewait,2,Fri Jul 10 20:22:44 2015 UTC,"I am by no means an expert, so please take this just as my opinion.  To me, meditation should be whatever it happens to be at that moment. I may start out being mindful of breath, and then a body sensation crops up and I find my observation passing to that.  The key for me is that I recognize that transition of awareness, and don't try to grasp one technique or the other.    Being preoccupied with ""am I doing this right?"" was something I had to learn to let go of.  Keep in mind though that there are many methods of approach to ""proper"" meditation, and I'm sure someone would say my method of just letting the moment decide how I meditate is faulty.  It works for me however, and has helped me greatly with non-identifying and non-grasping.  All the best in your journeys :)"

Meditation,3cu6co,ringer54673,2,Sat Jul 11 07:42:39 2015 UTC,"The Path of Concentration & Mindfulness by Thanissaro Bhikkhu http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/concmind.html   But when you actually look at what the Buddha taught, he never separates these two practices. They are both parts of a single whole. Every time he explains mindfulness and its place in the path, he makes it clear that the purpose of mindfulness practice is to lead the mind into a state of Right Concentration — to get the mind to settle down and to find a place where it can really feel stable, at home, where it can look at things steadily and see them for what they are.  Part of the ""two practices"" issue centers on how we understand the word jhana, which is a synonym for Right Concentration. Many of us have heard that jhana is a very intense trance-like state that requires intense staring and shutting out the rest of the world. It sounds nothing like mindfulness at all. But if you look in the Canon where the Buddha describes jhana, that's not the kind of state he's talking about.  So it's important to realize that there are these three stages to mindfulness practice, and to understand the role that deliberate concentration practice plays in taking you through the first two. Without aiming at Right Concentration, you can't develop the skills needed for understanding the mind — for it's in the process of mastering the skill of mindful concentration that true insight arises."

If someone agrees with your take on it, will you then think that you're right? Or if you find a few people who buy into your view, does that confirm it? It is very easy to be quite confident about your opinion without ever dispelling the original doubt.  So maybe some more instruction is in order, whether it's learning from a book or from a living teacher, to understand better the aim and process of meditation, the obstacles and misunderstandings, the levels of attainment and their signs, and the many ways all of these play into your own character and situation.  There are many paths and many methods within the paths. A good number of them are complete courses of training, from beginning to enlightenment. They are not necessarily the same process, and cannot necessarily be mixed, but should usually be understood within the context of their own tradition and structure of practice.

So that you can drop them and simply relax and be silent.  Because there is no question of achieving enlightenment. All that we need to be absolutely fulfilled on our own, we have already. All we need to do is relax into it. We cannot relax while we are unsatisfied with outselves now, and want to improve, and become enlightened and better, to become more aware.   When you can accept yourself fully, say yes to yourself fully, then you can relax. If you can relax you will find out you are totally good enough as you are. You will find out that there is no need to go anywhere or do anything. In fact, you will know that if you try then you will move away from relaxation, away from your center. You will drop desire on your own, because you will have everything you could ask for. You will be grateful for this gift of life. You will dance in celebration."

Meditation,3csgxv,elphabaloves,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:02:19 2015 UTC,"So my question is, can I meditate too much?    Yes. It's easy and common to burn yourself out with too much meditation. This is a lifestyle change, not a short sprint to some quick goal. Take it easy. Once daily is recommended, and enough. More than two or three times daily is probably overdoing it.  Some people like to sit more frequently than others, so YMMV. Let your life tell you what works for you. Just don't burn yourself out. Easy goes it."

Meditation,3cscjg,CryzX,3,Fri Jul 10 11:20:22 2015 UTC,"Great to hear it's working for you! I had a similar experience, where I was a really irregular meditator, and then Headspace gave me the motivation to pick it up more regularly, and now it's a complement to my daily practice, and I can't wait to get onto the mat everyday.  I'd recommend sitting with all the options Headspace offers, and see which topic resonates. You can't really go wrong. I've started one, and realized it wasn't resonating, then switched to another stream. Just do what feels right.  My favourite so far has been the Self Esteem stream. I loved the exercises they talk you through. Much more playful than the standard stream. They are not specific to self esteem, so anyone can do it, and they do help if that is something you want to work on."
Meditation,3cscjg,locationundefined,4,Fri Jul 10 20:05:14 2015 UTC,I'm doing the anxiety pack at the moment and really enjoying it :) it's helped me to become a lot more present in day to day life and get a grip on my thoughts when they start to run away with themselves

If you can't sit down and practice to master a single technique for yourself, there is something you are running from. If you jump from technique to technique because you are bored.. there is what you need to face in meditation. Find your boredom and face it down."
Meditation,3cscjg,ladyjessop,2,Fri Jul 10 19:24:31 2015 UTC,I started the anxiety pack after finishing 10/15/20 based on the recommendation of others.  It's pretty good.  You don't have to suffer from anxiety to benefit as it's pretty general and gives a good introduction for mindfulness techniques you can use for anything. Sounds like you are enjoying Headspace! I love it too! It helped me turn daily meditation into a regular habit.
Meditation,3cscjg,Klassypa,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:57:40 2015 UTC,I too completed 10/15/20 and then made the decision to go on without a guided meditation. I was apprehensive at first but I stuck with it. That was over three years ago and I haven't missed a day since then. I used Headspace as my training  wheels but I don't regret giving them up.
Meditation,3cscjg,pristineamit,0,Sat Jul 11 11:48:49 2015 UTC,"Headspace is limited. Headspace is not something of our own. But our breathing is. Use headspace or any other app/props as little as you can use. Don't depend on them, like forever.   At the end of the day, at the end of all these apps/beats and other props, you'll have to be with your breathing. Befriend it. Throw your phone out of the window.  I'm not sure whether it'll get downvoted or what. But please, feel free!"
Meditation,3cscjg,pristineamit,6,Fri Jul 10 12:24:22 2015 UTC,Have you ever done Headspace besides maybe the take 10? You have to do most by yourself. Especially when it comes to the breathing. The guide doesn't talk at least for approximately 12 mins when it comes to following the breath.   It's just great to learn further techniques and to get the most out of the meditation IMO. I fully respect and understand your point though.
Meditation,3cscjg,YouveBeenHereBefore,-5,Fri Jul 10 13:14:55 2015 UTC,"Nah, I haven't tried it. And I'll not. But I do understand and agree to your point that technology helps, a little. I'm the kind of guy, who'd like to sit with no props(at least no phones, no laptops, no tablets and other technologies around and during the session). Try that sometimes, if you haven't. It's completely different experience.   And, instead of Headspace or other such apps, I'd rather sit with a group volunteered by a teacher, a real teacher. Find one.  Headspace will not direct/help you when things go the wrong way. But with a help of a teacher, it's a lot easier to rectify things."

Meditation,3cra5c,kevin420allday,7,Fri Jul 10 03:28:54 2015 UTC,"Movies, books, internet, etc. are often used as distractions from discomfort we feel moment to moment. Before meditation if I was unhappy or feeling low, I could turn on a funny show and be distracted from my unhappiness. I could spend hours on the internet to distract me from my boredom. I could get high and distract myself from difficult situations in my life. The feelings wouldn't go away, I just wouldn't be paying attention to them.  As I began meditating and bringing mindfulness into my daily life, I saw these activities for what they really were: distractions from discomfort or unease. Since I had built such an intricate set of distractions, it was difficult (and still is difficult) to know what I should be doing. I still watch television and spend a fair amount of time on the internet, but I'm also more willing to sit with my boredom, my discomfort, to see what's really going on.  More often now, if I sit patiently, I realize there are things I want to do: gardening, talking with family, exercise, etc. However, for many reasons over the years I have put up barriers to engaging in these activities (I don't know how, I don't have the time, no one will like it, etc.). With meditation and mindfulness I begin to see these obstacles as being entirely mind created. They aren't real obstacles. They seem real because I've been telling myself they are for so long, but realizing they are just stories has helped me get started on more engaging, useful, habits and hobbies instead of distractions that bear no fruit.  It has taken a bit of time (a few years) to break down some of these barriers and get past the boredom. I still engage in recreational activities (bike rides, television, internet, etc.), but usually for a discreet amount of time and for specific reason. Boredom isn't a bad thing, it will pass."
Meditation,3cra5c,xtpd,3,Fri Jul 10 11:40:28 2015 UTC,"Yup. Nice, huh? The joy I get from meditation is way nicer than weed etc anyway. I still fall back to the occasional toke/fap out of habit or curiosity or social obligation (well, not the fap part), and see it's not as gratifying as it once was.   Thing is, you don't have to decide to quit anything. It'll just one day be not interesting enough, if you stick with meditation."

Meditation,3cra5c,Thevents,2,Fri Jul 10 12:22:55 2015 UTC,"Try picking up a good book or studying an interesting, challenging subject instead. You may find that there is a reason you have lost interest in these leisure activities, and that it might be for the better."
Meditation,3cra5c,zen_nerd,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:15:44 2015 UTC,"This same thing started to happen to me, so I backed off of meditation. Is the idea that you will find other things that interest you? I felt very confused about my identity, and found it hard to connect with friends who still held the same interests (social drinking, shopping/clothes, finding new music).  I've started meditating again and accept that this may happen again, and am curious to hear from someone who has passed through this stage."
Meditation,3cra5c,omtastic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:58:20 2015 UTC,"First of all, I'm still a neophyte in this field, so I can't really say that I've passed through any stage. However, since I started meditating, I find myself indulging less in activities that give me short-term pleasure at the expense of health, wealth or time that could be spent otherwise.  If you're referring to social drinking as sitting in a park or by the beach on a nice sunny day, drinking one or two beers with good friends, then yea, I will still do that and enjoy it very much. But going out clubbing and getting wasted is something I'll be much less likely to do.  I think that you may find that when you're transitioning from one ""stage"" to another during the time that you practic and advance in your meditation, there may be some grey areas where you don't really know what's what. You suddeny lose interest in something that you used to enjoy (playing Angry Birds on your smartphone or whatever), and there will be a time where seemingly nothing that you used to do is as interesting as it once was. At this point, you will keep meditating, and you may find that new interests starts popping up. Perhaps these interests seem to be more enriching for you, or provide you with something bigger than your previous activities ever could!  Personally, I think this phenomenon has something to do with your concentration and attention expanding and advancing to another level, thus enabling you to enjoy more complex or sophisticated activities. I'm not sure how this translates to socializing, though."
Meditation,3cra5c,zen_nerd,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:41:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the answer! At the time, I didn't have a proper teacher or know anyone going through something similar, so I was understandably freaked out.   And not being interested in the same things as my friends made it hard to find common ground and feel connected to them in turn. Perhaps that is something that would get easier to deal with, too -- or perhaps I would find deeper friendships."

The film features four inmates, all convicted of murder, and includes interviews with guards, prison officials, local residents and other inmates, and reenactments of their crimes.   The soundtrack includes music by Low, New Order and Sigur Rós.   The film was directed by Jenny Phillips, a cultural anthropologist and psychotherapist, Andrew Kukura, a documentary filmmaker, and Anne Marie Stein, a film-school administrator.  In 2008 Phillips released Letters from the Dhamma Brothers: Meditation Behind Bars (ISBN 1-92870-631-2), a book based on follow-up letters with the inmates.   The Dhamma Brothers has been compared with another documentary, Doing Time, Doing Vipassana (released in 1997), which documented a large scale meditation program at Tihar Prisons in India with over a thousand inmates using the same meditation retreat format.

Metta is a good object that works great on the cushion, AND you can beam it at people while talking to them. They like it too!   Oh also, keep an eye on where tension arises in your body when interacting with others. I find that my chest/heart area tenses up subtly when I'm planning my next sentence. Sometimes little muscles in my head too. Right when you notice it, relax, open up.   Tl;dr: relax and send metta."

In this case you may try to use the person's voice and body language as the object of meditation.  When you are deeply listening, they are your breath.  You can also practice listening to audio lectures or watching video lectures that are fairly ""boring"" to practice this skill."
Meditation,3cr6wm,elphabaloves,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:29:14 2015 UTC,"Using the breath as an anchor (what you call focal point) during meditation is great. Being aware of the breath when you aren't meditating as a means to ground yourself is also great - but not while engaged in another activity/task.  When you are being mindful in your non-meditation time, your anchor should simply be the present moment. You want to be fully engaged with what's before you right here and now. If you are trying to have single-pointed focus on your breath, you are taking away energy that should be allocated to the current situation and task at hand. Why would you do that?  Focusing on your breath as the anchor while meditating helps you develop the skill of noticing your thoughts and emotions without getting caught up in them. You then transfer that skill to your non-meditating time - if your mind wanders, you notice and return to the present moment (your ""non-meditating"" anchor). As such, you're not following your mind away from ""now,"" and you're more engaged with everything that unfolds before you.  When talking with others, talk with others. When you are washing the dishes, wash the dishes. When you are walking the dog, walk the dog. When you are working, work.  edit - formatting, clarity"

I have had varying degrees of success with this, but perhaps I need to give this greater importance as it is the most powerful thing to practice. The only problems I encounter are that, I tend to get lost from the moment, because absolutely everything is constantly changing, and I feel like my mind gets swept up into distraction unless I have an physical sensation as an anchor. But I think you're right, because my awareness of thoughts should come naturally from meditation time if I practice enough. I should not be trying to meditate during daily life. I guess I have been half-meditating during everyday life in an attempt to make up for time I haven't been spending enough on the cushion."

I understand what you're saying, and you've (knowingly or unknowingly) touched on two of the most critical insights when it comes to mindfulness, meditation, and understanding your mind: impermanence and the urge to control.  Change is constant - nothing stays the same, and our minds are constantly trying to control what happens as a result. Clinging to these thoughts, pushing away those thoughts.  You say ""my mind gets swept up into distraction unless I have an physical sensation as an anchor."" But you're still caught up in the mind here - you are worried about what it does. Your job isn't to control the mind or stop the insanity (for lack of a better word), your job is to become aware of what's happening without getting caught up in it anymore.   Take this view: let your mind be as it is, independent from you and your attention.  I hope that helps."

My advice is to not get attached and excited to whatever it is you're actually feeling and carry on. Maybe your brain is not used to having stillness, that it's trying to bring in thoughts and you're cutting them off, which makes the brain uncomfortable. You said you still feel sensations? How about you dissect those sensations even further, and seek the root of pure awareness."

Meditation,3cqcr1,TheHeartOfTuxes,2,Mon Jul 13 21:20:40 2015 UTC,"This state is neither good nor bad. Also, it is only relatively still in comparison to what you are used to; there is much, much more territory possible by way of stillness.  For instance, what you describe does not even yet enter the first traditional category of concentrative unity or 'absorption' known as Dhyana (Pali: Jhana), of which there are eight levels (some say nine levels, while one writer identifies 25 distinct states). The second level is quite still; higher levels move into formless states like infinite consciousness and beyond.  But mere stillness is not an end in itself. Although some good things can come of stillness, by itself it doesn't have the power to bring awakening insight. So take care not to get too fascinated, proud, awestruck, or otherwise attached to stillness.  All of this can come quite naturally without mucking about if you follow a traditional course of training. Most important is for your direction to be clear, in life and in practice. You've heard ""it's not about the destination, it's about the journey""? This is a very important point. If you fixate on reaching states of mind you will completely lose the point of practice.  Meditation, and any spiritual practice, is for the purpose of awakening from the dream of life, and helping all beings awaken and move beyond endless cycles of suffering. Meditation that is only 'for me' is not only stunted, it can also lead you down the wrong path and bring eventual harm. The whole purpose of meditation is compassion... love, not selfish grasping at states and powers.  Opinions and speculation about ""what just happened to me"" are useless, wasteful hindrances. This is known as checking. You may have an authentic experience, but then you move back to your self-centered, conceptual view and try to label what happened. What a shame to kill a vibrant, boundless experience like that!  Checking also can happen in the present moment, as you try to peek at yourself while something is happening. It's like taking selfies instead of actually being present with the journey: you revel in seeing yourself doing something you deem special or spectacular. This does nothing but increase your egocentric mind.  But checking is also often prompted by fear and doubt. The self-image begins to dissolve for split-seconds, and one wonders whether the terror of losing the grip on everyday forms is appropriate or dangerous. This is why it is helpful (and in fact necessary beyond beginner's efforts) to make contact with a good teacher and learn a method and path very well. You should be very clear on what to do with your mind, and why, at any moment and in any situation that may arise. This comes from a combination of proper explanation and proper testing through your application. Only experimenting on your own or getting various slapdash opinions can't help you remove doubt.  Finally, practice is not about any particular feeling. If you are fascinated with a feeling or trying to explain or attain a feeling, you are fixating on something altogether unnecessary. Feeling is part of the contingent, dualistic world. It is a form that comes and goes, like thought. Meditation is about that which doesn't come and go. That is why non-attachment is so important: we let go of things that come and go so that we can perceive and rest in our original unborn, unchanging nature.  Sitting and not knowing is not bad. But sitting and not knowing and thinking that you should know equals confusion. You need proper instruction to make sense of open, boundless attitude and experience in meditation."
Meditation,3cqcr1,Nobodhichitta,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:23:11 2015 UTC,I think you are talking more about a spiritual access to meditation. I personally started it as part of treatment for my depression. So my access to meditation was goal oriented from the very start but I alredy noticed that the desired succes comes the less you try to achieve it. How do I find a teacher that is able to deal professionally with depressed students? Currently I am doing an 8 week program with a book from an oxford proffessor for psychology.

Meditation,3cq8eo,akirakiki,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:44:05 2015 UTC,"Same here. I normally feel very anxious the second I wake up and it can be very unsettling. What I did to deter the stress and anxiety is I created a morning routine that includes meditation, and then follow it every morning. The consistency of the tasks I complete in the morning take my mind off the stress and force me to focus on other things. Ill wake up, start the shower, start the coffee maker and then jump into the shower. After the shower I'll go and grab the coffee that is just finishing up. Then I'll proceed to read some news or the current book I am reading and sip the coffee. Then at about 6:45am I'll head to my room and meditate for 20 min. Seriously, after about 5 min of meditating there will be no trace of stress.  Hope this helps! Hang in there. Stress is invisible and holds no weight."

Meditation,3cq8eo,snugglehistory,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:51:41 2015 UTC,"The morning is the one time I am truly at peace. I usually wake up completely stress free. Especially if I have some time to hang out for awhile. I'll go meditate in my yard, and just stare at the trees and animals and watch the insects and the clouds and things blowing in the wind. I have dogs, and I just sit outside with them. At these moments I actually feel like an animal. Like I'm just lazily sitting there looking around, and all the silly human concerns mean nothing. I'll get real curious about things like what the ants are doing, or what type of bird flew into the yard, or just looking at the sky. I can spend hours in this sort of state, but usually I don't have enough time to hang out for as long as I would like.   Inevitably the time comes to get back to the ""real world"" and go interact with people and take on responsibilities, and do all the things I need to do. My little morning meditative state will fade away, and then in the course of the rest of the day is when I'll actually experience things such as stress and anxiety. Oh well. Until next time, I guess."

Two years and I am still doing it. I no longer worry about whether I am making choices or not, I just make them!  In my search I haven't found any self or choice-maker, but choices still get made.

Reality happens the way it happens, regardless of how we narrate it. He suggests that we recognize this inner voice, which provides comfort but also can perpetuate stress, anxiety and a false sense of control.  Thats what I got out of the first few chapters"

I get so anxious about this, and the fact of what is ""me"" and all the questions under the sun similar to it. I never cared about this before I had this massive anxious episode, which is why I think I can fix this and become well again.

Meditation,3cnnpt,elphabaloves,2,Fri Jul 10 19:21:57 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of Sam Harris's philosophical writings. (Not so much for his religion based books, just too long winded)  His whole theory is covered well in his book ""Free Will"".  First you have to know he is a Neurologist and knows much about the brain. They have done studies that show they can identify what the brain is about to think/choose within just a few small small matters of fractions of seconds. He argues that in 15-20 or maybe 50-100 years time that there is no good reason to believe we won't be able to extend that time to 5 minutes or 5 days.   He is basically suggesting that in the relatively near future we will be able to know what we will do before we do it.   It simplifies it like this (this isn't exact just a rough outline of how he explains it):  You wake up in the middle of the night and you're thirsty. What do you grab to drink?   Now let's just say you choose milk.   Why not water? Why not orange juice? Those are both completely capable of satisfying your thirst.  Sam Harris says this is where there is no free will.   You never had the option of choosing the orange juice. That's why you chose milk.  So if it was 100 years in the future and we scanned your brain we would see ""hey he's gonna choose milk tonight"".  Take all of that with a grain of salt. I don't think Sam Harris honestly believes we will know if you'll have milk or not but its just an easy way of explaining it.  All of life is a course of decisions leading to the next decision. Sam is saying because of those past decisions and every decision we make thanks to our brains was really just the brain not having another option.   Our minds are made up before hand.   I think the spiritual view you can apply to this is that we are not in control of even our own minds. That's my goal for meditation is to let my mind go and be a blank slate.   On a day to day basis just tell yourself that it's all out of your control and because of that there is no reason to worry. There's nothing you could do anyways so why fret and worry over something that's out of your control."

Meditation,3cnnpt,clickstation,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:16:57 2015 UTC,"Give his book ""Free Will"" a quick read. Very very short book.  Also remember this is just one set of views.  Dan Dennett is a philosopher that contradicts Sam Harris and his view of free will.  Personally I find Sam Harris to make more sense than Dennett. To each his own though.   http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pCofmZlC72g  If you don't have time to read ""Free Will"" the link above has him going into plenty of depth about the topic and in my opinion sums up his views better than the actual book."
Meditation,3cnnpt,AMFYOLO,3,Thu Jul 9 15:21:13 2015 UTC,"What Sam is explaining is the same thing taught on the spiritual side of the fence. You are not your body. You are not your brain. You can use your body and your brain, but they are not you. Your brain is a monkey. An advanced monkey, but a monkey nonetheless. It doesn't always listen to you, sometimes it tries to do what it wants.   Getting control of the monkey mind means quieting it. It really can help to watch dog training videos to see how this works, i recommend The Dog Whisperer, but there are others. Use posture and concentration to gain this control. Meditation is the means, the training ground, if you will.   Once the monkey mind is quiet, then you (who you really are) has more control over your thoughts. This is called thinking with your higher mind. It makes much more use of feelings and imagery than normal noisy thought.   So, the idea isn't the channel the monkey mind, the idea is to stop it from running around creating havoc, and get it to sit still and be quiet, so you can think.   This is the essence taught on the spiritual side of the fence."
Meditation,3cnnpt,OstensiblyHuman,3,Thu Jul 9 10:49:25 2015 UTC,"With all due respect, that's not what Sam teaches. He is an ardent opponent of the concept of free will, and the ""thought"" that you have the ability to control anything at all - including what arises next in consciousness.  He doesn't espouse stopping anything, or controlling anything.   He goes into his philosophy a bit in this interview with Dan Harris, and you can get his book ""Free Will"" from Amazon.  note - I'm not dismissing what you say in your comment as a legitimate response to OP's fears. I'm just pointing out it's not what Sam teaches."

The only reason he got into neuroscience was to try and figure out what was going on in the brain to explain all these philosophical/spiritual contemplations.   That said, you still have to take him with a grain of salt. He is still just a guy with his own personal biases. Also, just my personal opinion, but although I used to be quite captivated by him, the more I listened to him, the more I seemed to find holes in his thinking. His latest appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast was particularly awkward. Basically, I think he's smart and knows a lot of stuff and has some really great ideas, but I don't think he's as smart as he thinks he is."

I went through a similar thing after reading The Power of Now and decided to have a break from meditating and come back to it once the anxiety over it had gone. I cant find the exact quote, but the best advice I read was from a book by Thich Nhat Hanh, it said something like: Dont worry about trying to work out the true nature of reality until you have been working on concentration [coming back to the breath in this case] for at least 6 months. I try to feel the sensations of my breath in as much detail as possible. I am also in the process of recovering from a complete breakdown and I totally understand the compulsive over-thinking thing!

Once you accept the fact that this loss of focus will happen, it relieves a lot of the stress and actually makes maintaining your focus easier.   There is a lot of value in noticing that you aren't focused on your breath. Every time you notice that you have lost focus on your breath is an opportunity to return to your breath. You should be grateful when you become aware that your mind as wondered away. When this happens, gently bring yourself back to your breath. Instead of thinking, ""Man, I totally lost focus again,"" try ""Good. I get to return to my breath.""  Also, you may want to try meditating for a bit longer on some occasions. Three to five minutes is barely enough time to calm the mind. If you're short on time, maybe find one or two times a week where you can sit for longer (15-20 min).   Be patient with yourself."

There are many different translations into English, and I'm probably saying it wrong, but the wording I use is ""may all beings be happy, may all beings have peace, may all beings be free from suffering, may all beings be enlightened as to their true nature."" You can either do it generally, thinking about all beings, or do a specific order, starting with yourself, someone you like, someone neutral and a ""difficult person"". So, one round of ""may I be happy...."", one round of ""may those prisoners be happy.....,"" and finally to the people doing the inflicting of pain. If you think about it, nobody can inflict pain and suffering on others without some damage - either they are already mentally damaged to want to do that to others, or if they are doing it because they are ordered to do it, they will become mentally scarred from their actions.

Meditation,3cm025,MerchantR,3,Thu Jul 9 01:18:33 2015 UTC,"Meditating to figure things out is the Western definition meditation.   Basically just focused thinking.    The Eastern definition of meditation is one of going beyond thoughts, by focusing on the attention.     Even if the method involves thoughts, in Eastern meditation the emphasis is on where the attention is placed: either on the object of meditation or just wandering.    So every now and then people get confused by these two conflicting definitions."

When I do that I generally acknowledge the thoughts I have, sometimes consider them a moment, and then after an amount of time that depends on my goal in meditation, I dismiss them softly. When I want to relax and be calm, I don't consider thoughts long at all and often just focus on the sounds and the room and my breathing.  When I'm meditating on something specific, I often use the meditation as a way of finding other ways of looking at it. I think gently from one angle and then let that angle go and wait for another thought to appear. If it's relevant and interesting I consider it, and if it's not, I dismiss it.  Just my experience, hope it helped!"
Meditation,3cm025,Calebdgm,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:31:23 2015 UTC,I don't focus on it.

Meditation,3cm025,fxthea,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:36:23 2015 UTC,"The true goal of meditation, is to be that which remains unobserved. Let me explain. Just as a nerve, such as one in the finger-tip, cannot touch itself. The finger-tip must touch what we call ""Everything"" to experience different sensations of touch. In truth, the finger-tip is the basis for all of these sensations; it is only because this is so that the finger experiences sensation in relation to itself when touching objects (the information is not within the object, but that which touches the object). In the same way, your awareness of all that is happening, is often stuck on that which it perceives. Just as if a finger-tip were to associate with everything it touched. Just as the finger-tip cannot touch itself, that which is the ""nerve"" or ""finger-tip"" of the mind cannot observe itself. It is the origin point of awareness. This is what you tap into and rest in, while in meditation."

Meditation,3cmhcd,pinstrap,4,Thu Jul 9 01:34:26 2015 UTC,"First, you have to realize and accept and take to heart what's important and what's not important. This is a difference between ignorance and wisdom. One aspect of ignorance is taking unimportant things as important, and taking important things as unimportant.  I get the sense that your thinking about the gym is not so much about health as it is about appearance and self-image. If it were about health, there are many, many activities you could take up to maintain a healthy level of activity. But I think you've tied your sense of self-worth to something that happens (or that you hope will happen) at the gym.  So you need to look into this. If you are experiencing feelings of lack of self-worth, or if thoughts about your appearance or public image are taking over your life, you need to seek help in working through those issues. Compulsive exercise, obsession about exercise, or over-exercising because of urgent impulses all fall into a similar category as other body-image issues like anorexia and bulemia. It is possible to harm yourself physically by overdoing in the long run as well as by taking on risky behavior like using too much weight or lifting too intensely. Besides the physical danger, continuing the pattern can injure your sense of control over your thoughts, feelings, and life.  Getting bulked up is not important in the grand scheme of things. And if your self-image rests on how big or strong you are, it is a recipe for despondency. You should feel good about yourself based on noble human qualities like generosity, virtue, diligence, integrity, and compassion. These are important. How you attain your life purpose is important. How you help yourself and others become happy is important.  So the first thing is to get clear on this point. What is truly important, and what is not important?  Next, you will have to become aware of your patterns of thinking and reacting, and let them go as they arise. This awareness may be facilitated by a mental health professional or life coach or counselor. You may need that support to continue. If it turns you that you don't need that support, then it's a matter of mindfulness practice: staying aware moment to moment, so you can identify your attached thinking and release the grip when it arises. Any kind of mindfulness practice will help. The key is ongoing awareness. It's not a one-shot deal where you can take a pill or get a spectacular experience and be finished with the whole issue. Like exercise, it takes consistent work."
Meditation,3cmhcd,TheHeartOfTuxes,2,Thu Jul 9 02:33:18 2015 UTC,"Although you're completely right that over-exercising is a problem, I see nothing in the original post that would indicate that pinstrap is over-exercising. Furthermore, although body-image isn't a stereotypical goal of a meditator, I don't think it should be shunned, I'd even go so far as to say that it should be somewhat valued although society seems to conflictingly over-value body image and shame that over-valuing of body image, but that's another story."

A school/university counselor, public health office, phone help line, or website may also be a stepping stone to resources. It may be a good idea to talk to an expert in body image therapy.  Here are a few sites that come up in an online search:   Negative Body Image Excessive Exercise and Orthorexia (overly stringent eating) Negative Body Image Muscle Dysmorphia Body Image, Disordered Eating, Over-Exercise Positive Body Image   Good luck! Remember that you are not your body, and help yourself understand that you are already valuable and lovable, regardless of your physical state.  Edit: I would recommend against seeking advice from online forums. Many different people with different levels of understanding and different agendas go on forums, and there's no guarantee that you won't be getting absolutely the wrong advice from someone who, for example, has the same issue but is unaware of it.

If he says your form is good, your form is good. After that, you will continue to worry, but you can treat those worries as all other worries in your life (i.e., as thoughts), since you are safe."

One key thing to congratulate yourself about is that you are currently aware you're ""overthinking the simplest things."" This implies you're not completely consumed by the reality of the thought, and that this overthinking is happening regardless of your desire to stop.  Okay, good. So, the overthinking is there. Perhaps it is not so much to stop overthinking the simplest things, but it is accepting that you are currently overthinking the simplest things without your volition? How about when it occurs, rather than resisting this apprehension, fear and neurotic overthought, you merely observe and accept its presence? ""There is fear"", ""there is the overthought."" and accept them without judgement. Once they pass, invoke into consciousness the excitement that used to naturally arise - perhaps you need to review your own motivations. Regarding form, if you haven't looked at some video tutorials or talked with a personal trainer, it would be fairly sound to do so.  What happened in the past is the past. Rather than try to run away from the feeling you're doing something wrong, rather trying to label that feeling as something adverse, observe and accept it."

The mind will begin to wander. When you notice it has (a moment of mindfulness) return focus to the breath. Rinse and repeat.

Meditation,3cjxq2,startingfromscratch2,29,Wed Jul 8 14:22:58 2015 UTC,"Ajahn Brahm has a really good story to try and illustrate the concept of letting go and accepting:  ""The first disciple, in great pain, tries letting go . ""Let go,"" they suggest, gently, and wait.  ""Let go!"" They repeat when nothing changes  ""Just let go!""  ""Come on, Let Go.""  ""I'm telling you: Let! Go!""  ""LET GO!""  We may find this funny, but that is what we all do most of the time. We let go of the wrong thing. We should be letting of the one saying, ""Let go."" We should be letting go of the ""control freak"" within us, and we all know who that is. Letting go means ""no controller.""  The second disciple, in terrible pain, remembers this advice and lets go of the controller. They sit with the pain, assuming that they're letting go. After ten minutes the pain is still the same, so they complain that letting go doesn't work. I explain to them that letting go is not a method for getting rid of pain, it is a method for being at peace with pain. The second disciple had tried to do a deal with pain: ""I'll let go for ten minutes and you, pain, will disappear. Okay?"" That is not letting go of pain; that is trying to get rid of pain.  The third disciple, in horrible pain, says to that pain something like this: ""Pain, the door of my heart is open to you, whatever you do to me. Come in.""  The third disciple is fully willing to allow that pain to continue as long as it wants, even for the rest of their life; to allow it even to get worse. They give the pain freedom. They give up trying to control it. That is letting go. Whether the pain stays or goes is now all the same to them. Only then does the pain disappear."""

A general sense of detachment and letting go happens after you have developed enough concentration and mindfulness. It probably happens as a result of non-directive but I can't say for sure.

I once had a habit of straining my forehead muscles in a particular way because it felt like it made me go in to a deeper meditative state. Later I learned that it wasn't working for me and just giving me a headache. Instead what you must do is make an effort to physically relax all the muscles in your body. Imagine relaxing breath energy coming in and releasing tension on the outbreath to your back head, side, front down the neck and shoulders,  down the back, the chest and stomach area and the arms, hands and finally legs and feet.

Meditation,3clsiz,shivanaHS,2,Wed Jul 8 22:16:39 2015 UTC,"What have worked for me before is making a journal, how hours are spent during my day, you will realize if you keep a tight journal that many hours a day are wasted daydreaming, thinking about the past or the future, at your job or at school. If you meditate this ""waste"" is reduced, for example it might take you half a day to clean your room if you roam around not knowing where to start, but if you sit for 20 minutes meditation, and then clean your room, you will realize that by being focused on the task at hand instead of 4 hours it only took 2 hrs. Including 20 min. of meditation.  This way I have found time for me to sit and meditate, I do it probably 2 or 3 times a day, even at work, when I feel stressed or very anxious, I go to the meeting room, close the door behind me, set my watch and meditate for 12 minutes.  I found that it helps me calm and therefore be more productive during the day, but is a constant fight instead of letting your mind wander when tired, you have to force yourself to a little meditation time, to re-focus and continue with your day.  When arriving home from work, if my first reaction is go to the fridge and grab a beer, I know the remaining of my day will be spent playing Civ or walking my dog, but if I arrive, and sit and meditate,  I feel like making dinner, doing some jard work or studying.  But like I say, everyday is a struggle a constant fight between do the positive thing (meditate) or try an easy scape route (alcohol or weed)."

Some of the things you mentioned like anxiety/depression will improve with meditation and exercise.

After a few minutes you will become relaxed so will your breathing which could be why you can't hear it that well.  I had a similar sort of problem, inhaling for X seconds, holding breath for X seconds and exhaling for X seconds. I was concentrating on the sticking to the pattern/rhythm that my breathing became difficult, so I just breathe naturally, let it all come and go without intention/force.  Are you eyes open or closed? I would have that feeling when I meditate with eyes open, but it's not a problem for me, though I usually meditate with eyes closed."

Meditation,3cjnsx,Gojeezy,2,Wed Jul 8 20:44:54 2015 UTC,"Rather than complaining about your peaceful breath, you should be celebrate it (quietly, of course).    What this means is that your body and mind are getting extremely calm, so calm that your body barely needs to breathe.    This calmness means that your mind is concentrated, and there is relatively very little restlessness of the body and mind going on to obstruct your meditation.    Just let the peaceful breath be a guide to further refining your concentration.   If your breath even gets so peaceful that it seems to pause at times, just rest and relax in the pauses.   This is not a problem -- there are people who are so restless in body and mind that they literally cannot sit still for 4 minutes.    Their breath is not difficult for them to follow, they just can't sit still long enough to follow it for long at all.    All meditation brings benefits, but the more your mind is concentrated and the deeper in meditation you go, the more mental power is available to you since it is not being dissipated in random restless thoughts and body movements."

Meditation,3ck1bj,dirk_b,2,Wed Jul 8 14:51:19 2015 UTC,"Feelings that you describe are what made me open up myself more for meditation. If what you feel is this tingling restlessness and worry and impatience, then it is similar to what I felt.  Accepting this is the first real step here. Meditation will never help you solve those problems directly and as you can see from your example, meditation worked for you until 'difficulty level was raised'. A mind in worry is far more difficult to tame - which is why meditation seems to come so easily to people with less worries.  What meditation helps you to do is practice focus and patience through breathing while minimizing your senses other than thoughts. Your mind wandering - which in my case led to more worrying - is perfectly alright.  What I would do in your place is to try and focus on breathing - as is usually recommended - on the flow of air or how loose muscles are in your arms while meditating or traversing your body in your own mind. Everybody tells this, nothing new here right?  But there is. Let me give you something what you may not have heard before.  While focusing on the act of breathing you'll see that you'll still wonder and start thinking about the worries that you have. And as you discover your mind wandering, you'll worry that you 'blew it' again and failed at meditation. But accept that this happens and return to the thoughts that you wandered off to. What you should do is that whenever you detect yourself wandering - worrying about your girlfriend for example - then instead of thinking about that worry or blaming yourself for wandering from the original intent, practice focusing on the 'breath' of that thought.  Meditation does not tell you to focus on your breathing literally. It means a breath of thoughts but one that you have to discover not as a checklist you prepare, but as a blind menu served to you by your own subconscious. The trick is to stop yourself from developing those thoughts and instead of think about the root of those thoughts. Think about the act of thought and make this your new challenge. You might discover that once you start focusing on that, your mind does not wander off to another concern or worry.  Trying to force yourself out of those thoughts will only mean that you will wander off again and find the same worry again or another one. What you will discover in time is that meditation is not an escape away from your worries, but a focused attempt to confront the root of them - the very breath that feeds them. And it's that which will give you peace in the end. And while this means at times that you had a meditation session where you were focused on a troubled thought, thinking that it must have been a 'bad session', that is not so. Because no one will consider a meditation session troublesome if you discover your mind wandering off to a good thought instead. Not a narration, not a story, but an emotion or a feeling, a comfort of a hug.  As a sidenote: I was once thought an interesting practice for this. My mentor, if you could call it such, told me to pick up one or two objects every day and just look at the object closely for five minutes, ten or more. Think about what features it has, what is its purpose, how old it is, how it might have been made, then the people that were involved in the making of it and more. In a way it's like awake-meditation, but one that doesn't have your inner-self in focus."

This is a different approach then what you usually find, but I will consider it and take it with me, this seems like one of those things you can also apply when not meditating. Thanks!"
Meditation,3ck1bj,YouveBeenHereBefore,2,Thu Jul 9 21:33:27 2015 UTC,"Acceptance is the answer. But acceptance is not ""distracting"" yourself until something ""goes away.""  I think this points to something a little bit deeper.   After a few years of meditation, you have spent a lot of time observing many things. One of those things, of course, is thought. I am sure in meditation and in life you have watched many thoughts arise, and you have watched them drift away, totally undisturbed. It is easy with many thoughts (e.g. it is raining outside).  These thoughts come and go easily because we do not identify with them. We see them for what they are — thoughts that we observe.   There is some benefit to this. But you should also know that the mind does not like being observed, and it does not like non-identification with its thoughts. It likes when awareness goes entirely to thought, when we identify with them as representations of ourselves.   Our minds have many tricks for achieving this. One is to give the illusion of slipping behind awareness itself. The mind speaks to you as though it is awareness. I feel anxious and I am distracted and I am back to square one. These thoughts seem to come from awareness itself. I am aware, and I see that I am feeling anxious. You identify with them, and they are given great power. They become a problem that you need to do something about. They become an obstacle to meditation. Instead of arising and dissolving like many other thoughts do, they stick with you. This is all because of identification.   Although this mind trick is very seductive, the solution is very simple. Bring awareness to these thoughts as well. It is all thinking. When your mind says you are too distracted to meditate, be aware that thinking is happening. When you feel restless during meditation, be aware of the feeling. When you feel frustrated because you became distracted, be aware of that as well. Then contemplate who is observing all of this noise. Who is watching this resistance to meditation, and who is resisting? Who is saying that you need to stop meditating because of them, and who is watching that as well? The mind and body feel disturbance, but is awareness itself disturbed?   This takes us back to the original point — acceptance. You cannot accept what is happening if you identify so strongly with it. It is too powerful and unpleasant, so you drive yourself to distraction. But if you can bring awareness to the thoughts and feelings that are troubling you now — and truly recognize that they are not a problem, that they are just phenomenon observed by your totally undisturbed awareness — the identification with them will break, their power will go, and you will be able to accept them."

The mind will begin to wander. When you notice it has (a moment of mindfulness) return focus to the breath. Rinse and repeat.   Sometimes a moment of mindfulness is not enough to let go of thoughts (when trying to return to your anchor) though. In that case, there are a few different techniques that will allow you to bring the mind back to your anchor.

Meditation,3cg1em,purplelephant,19,Wed Jul 8 00:27:27 2015 UTC,"But I can't just force my feelings away.   You hit on the crux of the matter right there.  Mindfulness is the act of watching the mind.  Watch it.  See how it behaves.  Eventually you'll notice that everything the mind does is conditioned.  It is like a flag that is flapping in the wind, moving just so due to its interaction with the wind, only the mind believes that it is choosing to move just so.  Once you realize that you are in fact the awareness that is perceiving the mind the pressure is off.  Even the act of being mindful is the mind acting out its conditioning because I just mentioned it.  Don't try to push down the feelings.  Allow them to float around all they want, just don't pay any attention to them and they will subside on their own.  Recognize the conditioning that is causing the feelings.  Notice how they arise due to the conditioning and that you, the awareness, have nothing to do with them.  There is also a technique called Self Inquiry.  Ask ""who is heart broken?""  Notice that the heart break is a feeling and thought that is arising on its own and you are perceiving them.  I hope this helps.  Feel free to PM me with further questions.  Letting go can be a challenge but it can be done.  It is the clinging to the desire to bring back the relationship that is painful."

It's hard to give advice without knowing more details but basically in a relationship(and everything in life) you need to worry about what you can control, YOUR actions and reactions.  What you can't control is your partners reaction, so if you live your life ""clinging to a desired outcome"" (""oh I baked him some cookies, I hope he likes them"") you'll never be happy.

Meditation,3cg1em,karmaisdharma,8,Wed Jul 8 16:37:05 2015 UTC,I don't see how going on facebook and feeling lonely is meaningless. That pain is inside you somewhere and is worthy of being explored. Why can't you find meaning into why going on facebook makes you feel lonely and learn from it?
Meditation,3cg1em,miguelon,7,Tue Jul 7 21:49:04 2015 UTC,"Hey! I do agree that meaning can be found in everything. I think the greatest example is Viktor Frankl who found meaning even within a concentration camp. However what Frankl said was that there are three ways to create meaning in your life (1) by creating a work or doing a deed;  (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; [in my example going out even though you have social anxiety] (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering [this would be the sitting in front of the computer example - you would try to find meaning in it by changing your attitude - however being lonely at home is not unavoidable suffering]  Now being at home and sitting in front of your computer and feeling lonely isn't inherently meaningful. For this reason it's a meaningless pain, meaning that this pain doesn't serve a greater meaning and it doesn't bring you closer to your values nor does it help you to grow. Of course you can always try to find a meaning in situations that inherently don't have meaning however as Frankl said trying to find meaning in things by changing your attitude should be rather reserved for circumstances that you can't change. And as long as you have the freedom to take action you should always try to create meaning through active action towards your values.   And the bigger point behind this is that pain doesn't equal suffering. Suffering comes from giving in to emotional pain that doesn't help us to grow nor moves us closer to our values - even though we could change it."
Meditation,3cg1em,J_Keezey,2,Tue Jul 7 23:00:18 2015 UTC,"He's trying to get people to actually get out and face their pain.

It's not that going on Facebook and feeling lonely is meaningless, but using those things to escape pain is fruitless."

It can certainly help, but there's a lot of factors going into sleep hygiene.  Make sure you cut out all screen time two hours before bed. Phones, TV, computer, all of it. Read a book if you need something to do, or meditate!  Get exercise every day. Even if it's just going for a walk for 15 minutes. Just get your body moving. When you've worked your body, it will feel like it needs rest and it will be easier to fall asleep.  No caffeine after 12:00pm. No soda, coffee, or caffeinated te.  Get some sunlight during the day. Even if it's cloudy, just go outside. This could be your exercise time as well.  Use your bed only for sleeping or sex, and if you can, your entire bedroom as well. Move everything else to an office room or living room. Do not sit on your phone or watch TV in bed. Your bed is for sleeping or sex. That's it.  If you can dim lights in the evening, do so. If not, try doing things in the evening by candlelight or a dimmable lamp.  Have a sleeping routine. Stretch, meditate, brush your teeth, listen to relaxing music (without looking at a screeen), read a chapter from a book.. whatever is relaxing to you do that doesn't involve screens, do that. And do so with dimmed or turned off lighting.  Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends. If you have to be tired for one day, you can do that. Better to have a consistent circadian rythym. No sleeping in and no naps.  Get your planning done in the morning or evening before bed. Write everything you want to accomplish the following day or that day so you don't need to think about it at night. Journal too to let go of any topics you may want to think about.  Meditate before bed. Feel the sensations of your body becoming heavy, of your aching muscles to lie down and relax. Play the whole day in fast forward in your head. Don't get stuck on any one thing. Then do a body scan and slowly release each part of your body for sleep, starting from the toes to the very top of your head.  Finally, this will all take time. You won't instantly fix your sleep by doing this today. You need to give it a week or so of consistent sleep hygiene. Your toothache doesn't disappear because you start brushing your teeth. Dental hygiene takes time, but if the habits are there, it will develop. In the same way, if you begin implementing these sleep hygiene habits, you will see improvements. Therapy is also a very effective treatment for insomnia if you don't think you can do it alone. But whether or not you need support, you can do this! Let me know if you have any other questions and stick with it! :)"

Seems really early but anything is better than staying up until 3:30 and having a job interview the next day. Yesterday I had an espresso at 4pm but I ran 8 miles after that, so figured that would wear me out enough."
Meditation,3cj66i,trevordabomb,2,Wed Jul 8 23:49:20 2015 UTC,"The general rule of thumb is six hours before bedtime, but I think if you're having severe trouble, noon is a good cut off point to reset the circadian rythym."

If you practice mindfulness you can develop enough concentration that you don't have racing thoughts . . . or any conceptual thoughts at all.  Trying to stay awake can be the hard part for meditators that develop enough concentration and tranquility.  Mindfulness of breathing:   Focus on the breath.   A. Pick either a physical sensations (e.g: the rise and fall of the abdomen, the breath passing through the nose, the breath passing the tip of the nose, etc... ), a mental concept (""in"" and ""out"", or a point in space that the breath passes, or the process of the rising and falling of the abdomen, etc... ) or both. The mind will begin to wander. When you notice it has (a moment of mindfulness) return focus to the breath. Rinse and repeat.   Sometimes a moment of mindfulness is not enough to let go of thoughts (when trying to return to your anchor) though. In that case, there are a few different techniques that will allow you to bring the mind back to your anchor.

Meditation,3cj66i,SteelTooth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:53:06 2015 UTC,"I've been suffering the same as you my whole life. In the last 3 years it has gotten bad. I suspect the majority of my problem stems from artificial light in monitors and phones.   I recently have managed to bring that time down from 2am to about 11:30pm-12:30 it makes it much more manageable and I rarely have really bad nights. You know, the kind where you didn't fall asleep until after 4 and you got up before 8.  I used meditation to help. One night while my mind was keeping me up I put myself into a meditative state. After about 10 minutes I tried to let go of the meditation to fall asleep. Didn't work. I let myself get deeper into meditation, 10 minutes later try again. I kept this up for what was probably an hour until I realized my mind and body had fallen asleep and I was observing it. I has full sleep paralysis with the exception of involuntary restless leg syndrome. I watched myself sleep the rest of the night.   The next day I wasn't nearly as rested as I would of been had I gone straight to sleep. By the end of the day I couldn't keep my eyes open. That night I did it again, this time I got to a point I recognized my body had fallen asleep, and upon first realization I let the meditation die, just let go. Woke up well rested.   Now I use a mixture of these two techniques to get to sleep when I can't naturally. At the very least I will get a partial sleep every night."

Meditation,3cjuzi,OrbitRock,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:45:57 2015 UTC,I can't help but feel that sitting with a goal in mind kind of defeats the point of sitting. The point of sitting is to sit. So set a timer and focus on your breath.  Going off the way you talk I imagine at some point you'll probably think you've 'got it' or you will sit with the idea that in the future you'll finally have 'it' but the process is ever changing. Just sit
Meditation,3ckom1,weahman,2,Wed Jul 8 17:38:43 2015 UTC,"[Edit - I don't think I expressed my thought about meditation clearly in this, my first comment.  I suggest reading my second comment after finishing the first one.]  The idea that a practice that calms people, that's good for stress reduction, such as meditation, is good for panic disorder seems like common sense.  However, if you read a book by psychiatrist David Burns, the author recommended most often by professionals for depression, you'll see that it's not that simple.  In The Feeling Good Handbook, Burns recommends the opposite - trying to make yourself panicky.  The calm-down approach is avoidance.  It's like agoraphobia - thinking you can escape from the attacks by staying at home or hiding in the bathroom.  The key in cognitive therapy is understanding the nature of panic disorder.  It's a phobia, like the fear of cats.  In Buddhist terminology, the poison of aversion.  We're not afraid of fast heartbeat or sweat while we're running, and there's no reason to fear these things with an attack.  When people come to see the attack itself as a nuisance, like the dizzyness you get from a roller coaster, the attacks are less severe and less frequent, or they just go away.  There's nothing wrong with stress reduction, of course.  It's just not an especially good treatment for panic disorder.    I hope you'll talk about this with a qualified professional."

Meditation,3ckom1,Gojeezy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:44:10 2015 UTC,"The calm-down approach is avoidance.    According to mindfulness, by avoiding a conditioned mental state you are unconditioning the mind in regards to being inclined toward that mental state.  Does he separate external and internal sensations at all?"
Meditation,3ckom1,SamuelColeridgeValet,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:48:02 2015 UTC,"A very common reaction when people start having panic attacks is to say, ""How can I calm down?""  It's the wrong question.  In a nutshell, Burns says to confront your fear.  He actually said that if you're afraid of doing something silly in public, you should go ahead and do something silly in public.  If you think being at the library triggered a panic attack, go to the library.  If you feel an attack coming on, say, ""Good! I hope this is a first class attack!  That reminds me, where did I put that tape of The Exorcist?  I need a really scary movie now.""  This reminds us of a quote from Thich Nhat Hanh - ""Don't turn away from your anger.  Welcome it.  Observe it as you meditate on your breath.""  If you asked a psychologist about mindfulness for somebody with panic attacks, I think the answer would be, ""If mindfulness helps the person to confront fear, that's fine."""

Meditation,3cihv6,zarav70,3,Wed Jul 8 04:15:59 2015 UTC,"Look into diaphragmatic breathing exercises. There are a lot of different videos on youtube that explain the process.  Also, if you practice mindfulness it will help. Sorry to say, it might not help too much (although it will probably help a little) for a trip that you have coming up soon though. It takes quite awhile of serious commitment to overcome anxiety when you are alone and meditating let alone out and about.  Definitely doesn't hurt to try though. If will always help down the line too.  Mindfulness of breathing:   Focus on the breath.   A.

Meditation,3cihv6,Gojeezy,3,Wed Jul 8 11:02:23 2015 UTC,"I too am an anxious person. I worry about stupid things too like ""what if I suddenly die?"" or ""what if I have Alzheimer's when I'm older?"" I always worry about the things that I can't control and even if I tell myself it's irrational, my mind continues all the same.  What you have to realize is that worrying does not mean you have to suffer. I tried so hard to get rid of my worried thoughts, but it just doesn't seem to work and I suffered a lot from it. After that didn't work, I took a different approach. Can I worry and not suffer? Can I worry and be perfectly content and happy?   Turns out, you totally can be. This might seem crazy, but this is what mindfulness is all about. Your brain is gonna worry and it's gonna worry about some stupid stuff, but you don't have to be a part of it. You can just watch it happen. Watch your brain come up with countless what ifs. Watch your heartbeat accelerate a bit and your breath change. There's nothing inherent in these physical changes that cause suffering, the suffering is your desire to make the worry go away.   Also, try and distance yourself from the worry. Notice the worry separate from you. Instead of saying ""I worry"" say ""worrying is happening."" Try to see that worrying is something that happens, just like a dog barking. You can't control it. Trying to stop a dog barking causes lots of suffering. Accepting the dog barking and being aware of it leaves the barking, but removes the suffering.  So, try a different approach. Try accepting your worry. You know what happens when you fight it, so try something new and see what happens when you don't fight it!"

Learn to observe the thoughts/emotions that comprise your worry as they arise, and condition yourself not to follow them or get caught up in them. If you are meditating, return to your breath instead. If you aren't meditating, return to the present moment and whatever you are doing.   The sooner you start, the sooner you'll see results in the form of worry losing it's hold on you.  edit - this is a short article you might find helpful."

A big help in meditation would be looking into some books as well.  Mindfulness in plain English is a great one and can be found on Amazon.  As far as religions go Buddhism is mostly focused on meditation so that would also be a good place to start.

Get as deep into the sensation as you can and break it down, similarly to when you were learning to focus on your breath while meditating. Aim for the greatest awareness of your discomfort - in this first session you don't need to achieve the state of mindfulness yet. Just focus on the pain - like Johnny Cash used to."

I never do anything special beforehand and I've never done a sun salute in my life. Maybe you should start by just sitting and not getting up for five minutes. It doesn't matter what your mind does as long as you keep your ass on the ground or in a chair. Then work from there.

No attempt is in vain. I can provide sources if desired.  The next piece of information is something I heard for years before I actually listened to what it meant. We've all heard the analogy that meditation is a category in the same way as sports. Just as physical exercise of the body can take many different forms through sports, so can mental exercise of the mind segment through different meditations. Different sports place different emphasis on different parts of the body, many times to achieve a shared quality. Ballerinas and sumo wrestlers both work to perfect the art of balance, albeit the mechanism to perfect that balance vary greatly.   What style of meditation are you referring to?  I think it's silly to completely ignore the physical reality our bodies are born into. If you were born with the body and of a ballerina, and you heard about sports as a way to express this body, but the only introduction you had to sports was sumo wrestling then no amount of practice would overcome the fact that sumo wrestling is not the most practical sport for someone with the body of a ballerina. Balance can be learned, but it won't be the most natural and fluid way.  Thinking that all meditations focus around the breath is like believing that all sports focus around the ball. Yes, it's a very common and shared mechanism, but it's not the only path to growth.   So basically...  -the willingness to attempt is the success. Define success as attempting and forget about the length of each session.    Find your most natural sport. No meditation is harmful but there are some styles that are naturally easier to acclimate and practice for some than others. Find yours."
Meditation,3cg736,ThankTheCreator,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:55:55 2015 UTC,"I would first of all suggest a timer. How long do you think you can realisitcally sit on an average day with moderate effort? Start from there. No getting up until the timer rings.   Does anybody else struggle like this? Does the fact that I'm struggling mean I'm doing something wrong? What do?   Yes, you keep getting up before the timer rings.  Seriously though, it might be a case of too much effort here. You seem to be psyching yourself up toward meditation by getting ready for it, and then putting in more effort and focus, and probably grunting and sweating, until you can't take the stress anymore...  What you can try is the following slight modification. First of all you don't focus hard on your breath, but softly. You just notice it. You don't focus, you are aware of it. And with every breath you take, you consciously relax. Inbreath - relax - outbreath - relax. You don't need to vocalize it.  And then there are the distractions. You might also try something slightly different here. You don't go back to the breath directly. As soon as you are aware of a distraction, you first smile, and then you go back to the breath, and again relax with every inbreath and outbreath. That smile acts like a bit of a buffer, and might help in actually letting go of the agitation which makes you jump up like a gumball after a few minutes. While currently you might take all that tension and carry it into your breathing, making relaxation more difficult than it needs to be.  Instead, let it things go with a smile."

Confront and be mindful of how you're feeling and seek to find the true reason behind your anger. Then you will know a tiny bit of more peace and self control. This breaks the cycle"

Meditation,3cg3dt,clickstation,2,Tue Jul 7 17:26:41 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, I am not meditating because of certain goals, like chasing jhana or trying to change my mind. I don't have any expectations and I meditate to simply experience the moment in a more present way compared to how we all live in this frantic life.  The reason why I am asking is because i'm trying to understand my mind a bit more (i have undiagnosed anxiety and quite likely adhd) and the effects of these condition(s).  I am 27 years old and seeing the moment and surroundings in those 30ish seconds is something that i remember happening only a handful of times in my entire life.

Meditation,3cg3dt,Gojeezy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:31:22 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it is the same. My understanding is that satori refers to a peak experience in meditation. It could be a samadhi experience, or an experience that is a peak for that practitioner. Of course the term satori comes from the Zen tradition of Japan while the term samadhi comes from the Vedantic tradition of India."
Meditation,3cg3dt,Gojeezy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:17:21 2015 UTC,"That is just momentary concentration. When momentary concentration becomes strong (you can sustain focus for 5, 20, 30, etc . . . minutes or more) then you are in access concentration. It might be relatively strong momentary concentration but I would hesitate to call 30-60 seconds of focus, access concentration. When the rest of the jhana factors (physical rapture and happiness as a result along with equanimity) start to arise within access concentration you are starting to experience jhana."
Meditation,3cg3dt,SteelTooth,2,Tue Jul 7 21:59:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about the concentration levels you mention though.

Meditation,3cg3dt,mungojelly,2,Wed Jul 8 17:08:44 2015 UTC,"One-pointed concentration is different than the concentration it takes to talk, work and play music. Physical rapture, in the jhanas, consists of pleasant physical vibrations, e.g., ASMR or kundalini."

Meditation,3cg3dt,Shuun,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:05:57 2015 UTC,"It's hard to guess really from a short text and not knowing you, but that does sound to me like jhana. I think it could be either the first or second jhana, they're named that more as advice than as a law of nature I think and you can sometimes skip to the second before the first (or with only a quick tiny skip through the first, which is functionally about the same).   So here's the distinction between the first and the second, so you can try to figure out where you are. (Note that this is just my opinion, my map, and there's some variety in exactly how people map it out-- just something to keep in mind when comparing different people's explanations.) The first and the second both have ""piti"" and ""sukha"" which are like the feeling of enjoying something and taking pleasure from it, and the feeling of being satisfied by and contented with something. The difference is what you're enjoying.   The first jhana, you're enjoying withdrawing from the hindrances. That is, same thing different words, you're enjoying becoming more focused on your meditation object. There's a feeling of, OK, phew, I can just let go of everything and focus on just this, wow that's great. The way the first is lower or less that gets it named ""first"" is that it's more in touch with the hindrances. It's in touch with them in a negative way!! Being distracted, not putting in energy, etc.-- phew it's a relief to put them down-- that's still connected to those things, connected to them by experiencing putting them down. So while it's obviously a very focused state and way better than not being able to focus at all, it's still somewhat less stable than the second and so forth.   The second jhana, you're enjoying your steady concentration on the meditation object. What falls away here is the setting up your attention onto the object or holding it onto the object. In the first you still had to set up the attention and hold it there, and then you could enjoy how that pressure of attention on the object takes away the hindrances, phew. But now you don't have to hold the attention on the object any more, it sticks there, and you can just take pleasure in how it's stuck.   So it's hard to tell from your short description but I feel like it's possible you got it stuck into that second jhana position for a moment-- which naturally would be very unstable if you're not able yet to produce a stable first jhana, you need that for a base to build it on.   Feel free to ask me more questions any time here or in PMs or wherever.

Meditation,3ccz6c,altopowder,2,Tue Jul 7 02:42:09 2015 UTC,"I think to add onto this I think it tries to stress that in reaction to external stimuli, you experience thoughts, which in turn cause emotions. If you think ""I'm angry"", you'll think that the external stimuli are causing the emotions directly which is wrong. It's your intermediate thoughts that cause them. Saying ""there is anger"" helps promote a sense of self awareness about the fact that there's a thought process causing emotions."
Meditation,3ccz6c,rightwaydown,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:57:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry it took a while to get back to you.  There are a few things going on in this exercise. The first is the immediate realization about how often everything is about you. There are languages and cultures that focus much less on ""I"" Japanese for instance use ""lets"" far more frequently.  Then there is the deeper realization that ""I"" is often found with certain things or feelings. It's always important to monitor your self appraisal because it's one of things that can go wrong in a big way.  It's also a good exercise because the language usage changes for a while to be about other people. Until you learn to doubletalk about yourself you find it just easier to talk about other things. Which is nearly always a good thing.  There is a raft of interesting psychology going on here but none of it is to be used for self diagnosis. It's just interesting. Except maybe you could ask if others are interested in ice-cream rather than saying you want ice-cream. That can net you a heap of ice-cream."

I'm two years into consistent daily practice with Vipassana and Zazen.   One thing I've learned to let go of is the idea or action of suppressing. That really helped me bring the meditative state and mind into my daily life outside the ~20 - 40 minutes a day of formal practice.
Meditation,3ccz6c,zen_nerd,2,Tue Jul 7 15:50:04 2015 UTC,"So how do you manage your thoughts without the idea or action of suppressing in your daily life? I find it easy enough to observe thoughts and pack them away while meditating, but while performing movements or doing things in everyday-context, it's harder for me to reach the state of an observing mind."
Meditation,3ccz6c,allthehobbies,2,Tue Jul 7 17:09:04 2015 UTC,"Attention!  I like this one: http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~beatrice/buddhist-practice/attention.html  Less about managing, and more about paying attention. When I'm aware of what is going on I tend to just behave in ways that are healthy.   I find it easy enough to observe thoughts and pack them away while meditating   I don't. I focus on simply being aware of them, intensely and I try to avoid any ideas about getting rid of them, blocking them, not liking them, etc. If I can't avoid those ideas, then I make sure I am aware of them too and they eventually leave.  The observing mind doesn't pack things away or suppress or block or reject. It just observes!  As for movements and doing tasks throughout the day - it depends on the task. If it is a very physical thing then I focus on being aware of my hands, feet, muscles and how they are moving and doing the task. If it is a knowledge driven task then I treat my thoughts like an object of meditation. I eventually get distracted, I turn my awareness on the distraction and may involve some rational thought (is this thought something I need to take care now?) and move back to the task on hand.  If I try to suppress or block or pack away something in my mind it tends to fight back, or i find that my focus narrows on that thing, or I find that I am suddenly ""involved"" with it as if I own it. ""I don't want this thought!"" implies that you are being given that thought or maybe that you had it in the first place. Instead I simply watch, I don't own the thoughts or sensations or feelings.   You can't pay attention to all things all the time. Just pay 100% attention to whatever is needed in the moment. I eventually realized that worry, guilt, hatred, anger, despair and such are not needed. They still occur but usually leave when I don't get involved.  Hah it is all much easier said than done. I'll just keep on doing."

You can never get only one side of the coin. So if you are after happiness, sadness will follow because sadness is part of happiness.   Meditation is different in a sense because you are chasing something rather you are just accepting whatever comes in your way and that is what produces bliss which is many times more pleasurable/rewarding than regular worldly happiness."

When you recognize that and acknowledge it, then ask yourself what the benefits of doing the thing (in this case, practicing mindfulness) would be.

There was a survey of studies in The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry in which reports of adverse effects were noted.  At retreats, prolonged meditatation can sometimes result in unpleasant sensations that go away if the person just rests for a while.  Authorities recommend that people suffering from mental illness not participate in retreats.  No, there are no reports of adverse long-term effects."
Meditation,3cgfnt,ultralurk2000,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:51:54 2015 UTC,"In my experience, hallucinations have less to do with quantity of practice than mental and physiological imbalances. During my first year of formal Zazen practice, when I would begin to practice for more than 2-3 hours a day, I would see faces in the wall literally all the time. figures of all kinds. I've had zero history of any mental issues so it bothered me quite a lot. My teacher assured me that it was just a phase, that it arised from my own mind, and that I should probably relax my breath more. It was really difficult for me to get the hang of the abdominal breathing of Zazen, but I worked on my posture and breath-following, and did my best to treat this phenomenon as just another mental condition to let come and go. eventually, one session it was like my lungs dropped down an inch or two, I became very centered and relaxed, and realized how restricted I've been for years. After that, the hallucinations stopped. I've practiced for 4 years since then and can easily sit for hours, with none of those types of side effects. Various types of dizziness are common when I take up regular practice after a period of slacking off, but they were more pronounced in the beginning of my practice, strange feelings etc, nowadays it's more easily handled... When I practice very intensely, I stop dreaming. That's about it.  Edit: Hallucinations and other side effects aren't really desirable in Zen practice, it might seem like a ""fun"" thing but it can also make you question your sanity, which really isn't fun. But yeah, put more than a couple of hours a day in, and use a wall-facing posture where your eyes are open, and you might experience a thing or two."

Meditation,3cewhm,poo_whistle,4,Tue Jul 7 11:12:19 2015 UTC,"Here's something that has been foundationally helpful for me dealing with nimittas (although I don't ordinarily call them that.)  When you're going into meditation, you're alert, and the distractions come up - there's a temptation to look at them and play with them, and this throws you off your course and you're back to square one.  What you can do, is draw your attention to that aspect of you that desires to look at the nimittas. The urge to come off your concentration. The call of the sirens, so to speak. See if you can breathe with that urge, giving it space to be there.  This too will dissolve, leaving you emptier and more peaceful.  Hope this helps!"
Meditation,3cewhm,zenmonkey87,3,Tue Jul 7 15:37:41 2015 UTC,"The way to deal with nimitta (counterpart sign) varies according to tradition and lineage. Some say they are merely a sign, and that the method should be continued. Others teach that you should shift awareness to the nimitta itself. Yet others urge us to disregard nimittas. Although some commentators may be right and some wrong, in established traditions the instructions have a sense within the greater context of the training; so the mere fact of differences in instruction is not enough to suggest that one course of training is right and another wrong.  Here is a good discussion of some various perspectives on nimitta.  In the Zen tradition, these would likely be treated as makyo — mere mental projections with no real significance. The instruction is usually to treat them as pitfalls: forget about them and return to the method. Have no doubt about your method, have faith in your method, and throw yourself wholeheartedly into your method. Then the play of appearance will not have a hold on you.  I tend to think that if what you call nimitta appears as a visual manifestation, it is not really nimitta. The counterpart sign is a brightness in terms of vividness and tremendous clarity, but if you're seeing visual objects it would seem that it is just further proliferation of appearance. Don't touch, don't mess with it. It is because you have developed the idea that the experience is somehow significant, even worthy of pride, that the experience then has the ability to take hold of your process and distract you. It is just the kind of sabotage the ego would like to wreak upon the meditative process, to keep you engaged with the drama of selfhood: ""Ooh, now I'm getting something important! Oh, but it took me away. So now maybe I should push back with more effort. Or should I use this to my advantage?"" And so on and so on, regenerating the sense of a self experiencing lights and attaining states and making practice happen. It is all illusion.  If you want a clear answer to what to do with nimitta, you need to present yourself to a teacher and commit to a course of training. Maybe it's time to remove this type of doubt from your practice. Messing around on your own will only regenerate a prideful sense of selfhood. But if you connect with a teacher, learn a method very well, and gain faith in it through experience, you will know what to do with your mind at any turn, and appearances won't have the power to draw you out of your task."
Meditation,3cewhm,TheHeartOfTuxes,2,Tue Jul 7 22:00:46 2015 UTC,"I don't remember how exactly did I reach the first jhana before   With focus. The first two factors of the first jhana are initial application of mind and sustained application of mind. By switching your focus to your nimitta you are initially applying your mind to it and sustaining your mind on it so that is not a problem.   I suspect wanting to get into jhana makes it harder   Only if you are wanting it while you are trying to focus and that want is distracting your mind. Resolving to experience jhana, before each sit, is not a bad idea at all.   Also, what should I do when nimittas arise?    Ignore them until they become obvious and solid. Then you can switch your attention to them. Otherwise, like you said, if you focus on them too early they simply degrade."

Meditation,3cewhm,volandovoy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:15:55 2015 UTC,"Whatever happens, just bring the attention back to concentrating on the object.  Again and again.  You might find yourself staring at the nimittas, 1 times, 2, times, 20 times, 30 times.  But as long as the attention comes back to the object, there will be movement into the first jhana.  And don't sweat it, really.  Even teachers whom have been practicing jhanas for dozens of years just have those days it doesn't happen.  Good samadhi is useful even if you don't become absorbed that session.  If it isn't happening, consider opening up the perspective broadly as possible and practice taking in all objects and letting them go as they come up, one after the other."

Put another way, when you are depressed, nothing is enjoyable -- because inner joy is unavailable.    Now you can contact your own inner joy directly, rather than having to go through the intermediary of external activities / things (which will always change so they will never actually be that enjoyable).    So finding your own inner joy in meditation is a great thing -- you are changing the process of enjoyment from an unconscious passive activity to a conscious purposeful activity that you are in control of - that is very powerful.    In addition you are changing your mind to become more peaceful, calm, and more powerful because it can now focus and concentrate.   The very act of concentration is enjoyable, so another way of putting this is that you have learned to concentrate your mind, which allows you to use your mind very much more effectively on external things.    Keep it up!  Good things are happening."

Meditation,3cfgek,DaringOffensive,2,Tue Jul 7 14:30:16 2015 UTC,"First, let me describe aural halucunation.  People describe it as a voice like someone in the room with them speaking in a loud voice, not like inner voice or making voices out of white noise.  Although this may seem unlikely, consider the possibility that you dozed off and were dreaming."
Meditation,3cfgek,SamuelColeridgeValet,2,Tue Jul 7 16:19:50 2015 UTC,"Sound logic but I definitely wasn't dozing off, I've fallen into lucid dreams before while in shavasana. This was different, I was still making adjustments to my seat and working on my breath while this was happening. I labelled them aural hallucinations because I knew they were aural hallucinations, given the fact that I had earplugs in I knew the source was internal and so labelled as such as well. Probably should have added that I've heard singing before while listening to white noise but this time I could make out words and sentences."
Meditation,3cfgek,ironpotato,2,Tue Jul 7 16:34:29 2015 UTC,This happens to me pretty consistently when I'm falling asleep. I quite like it. Don't think I've ever had it while meditating though.
Meditation,3cfgek,shastatone,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:37:14 2015 UTC,"It's not uncommon in meditation or deep relaxation. It's not a hallucination; a hallucination would be something that ""isn't there"", when the input is there, but is not from a physical source. The trigger level varies for different individuals, but generally once one gets to a particular level of relaxation the inner senses open up. Most people are in sleep or dreaming at this point but will see and/or hear these phenomena if some sliver of conscious awareness is kept going. The everyday waking mind is not able to deal with the multiplicity of input so you get an effect that is like tuning through radio stations with different programs. As to the basic art of using interior sound for meditation, try this."
Meditation,3cexuv,FastCashToday,5,Tue Jul 7 11:30:05 2015 UTC,"I've been sitting for about two years.  First, realize that sitting is an exercise. When starting any new exercise that you haven't done before you need to start gradually, slowly and often take rest days or entire rest weeks to allow the muscles to heal.  You should also be doing stretches regularly to compliment the muscles used when sitting.  Here is an excellent guide on sitting:  www.shinzen.org/Retreat%20Reading/AboutPosture.pdf  I also recommend the book ""The Posture of Meditation""  In general, try to vary your meditation postures. Meditate standing, meditate walking, meditating sitting, meditating laying. Incorporate stretches and consider some basic yoga routines.  After a year or two you'll be able to sit a long time without any pain, unless you have a specific bodily dysfunction. That case you should see a doctor to get checked out and then use alternative meditation positions that don't involve sitting.  Sitting is very conducive to meditation, but it is not required. You can meditate in just about any posture. Meditation happens in the mind, but it is influenced by the body."
Meditation,3cexuv,allthehobbies,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:43:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Ive added this to my reading list. It's frustrating because it feels like my body is constraining the progress my mind wants to make.  I'll be sitting and I feel it in my back. Thought bubble ""oh, you better correct your posture"" correct posture, breathe in, breathe out. Thought bubble: ""oh your back still hurts, you're probably hyperextending"". Correct posture, breathe in, breathe out. ""Is my neck in alignment? If my hips weren't so contricted I bet this would be easier. Why is meditation so painful? UGhhh I need to focus on my breathe."" Breathe in, breathe out. Thought bubble ""you're sloutching again because your back hurts. WHY AM I SO BAD AT THIS? If only my body was quite my mind would be also... How much time is left? Don't check, just breathe."" Correct posture. Breathe in. Breathe out. Pain reasserts."
Meditation,3cexuv,allthehobbies,2,Tue Jul 7 16:17:52 2015 UTC,"Well, you don't make any progress without some level of discomfort.  In meditation that discomfort can be amplified, because your eyes are closed and you are focusing on sensations in the body and mind.  The key is to be aware of all the thoughts and feelings you just mentioned.  Do the best you can to have correct posture and not hurt yourself, then in meditation just watch all those thoughts and feelings about it. That IS meditation. Meditation is not supposed to be pain free or discomfort free. If you are aware of what is happening and not getting ""involved"" in it, then you are successful.   Drop the expectation of trying to clear your mind, or having a peaceful mind, or having a happy mind. Go into meditation to see what is there, what is happening no matter what it is. Don't judge it, just observe. That is where you gain insight into your mind and learn how to deal with the stuff life throws at you.  You can look at the discomfort you are experiencing currently in meditation as a sort of micro vs the macro of life.  Try something next time you meditate. Try to find the physical sensation of pain and separate it from the mental sensation of ""negative"" ""bad"" and even further from the thoughts or verbalizations of ""i want this to stop"" or ""i should fix this"".  See if you can identify the physical sensation, the feeling tone and the thoughts. Do this for any sensation that arises, ""good"" or ""bad"". Try this for many meditations and see where it takes you."

Meditation,3cf925,behseh,22,Tue Jul 7 13:27:28 2015 UTC,"This is a very good topic to get clear on.  We need identity; it is necessary for relationship. It's just that we shouldn't get stuck in one identity. And we do; we get very, very stuck.  When you play a video game, an identity is necessary for you to play the game. If you don't have a game character, you can't participate.  But as you go through the game, you experience all the gains and losses as that character. Whatever the game character attains brings you pleasure, and whatever the game character loses brings you displeasure. This is what enables the drama and excitement of the game: you live and die with the game character. Trepidation, fear, tension, frustration, aggression, grief, feelings of superiority and inferiority, puffed-up pride -- all of these are experienced as if they are real, but they are all based on illusion.  Likewise, we need some kind of identity in order to relate in life, but our big mistake is that we go through life as if this identity is real. Therefore we experience all kinds of disturbance, and we vie to put ourselves ahead of others.  Within the illusion, there is no chance for harmony. Attached to a false idea of self, we do anything and everything to serve the self. Getting what the false self wants becomes the most important thing in life, so compassion and wisdom are relegated to mere concepts -- dreams in a dream world.  But if you wake up, you can use your identity without being controlled by it.   Within the video game, if you truly realize that the game character is not really you, you can be free of the drama, the agitation, and you can relate in a balanced, compassionate  way, and your life can open to far greater possibilities than just the game.  But of course, many people are so attached to the drama of their identity that they don't even want to consider waking up. They have to suffer deeply, until they realize that their attachment isn't helping them. If you don't make a point of waking up, then suffering will do it for you.  We might say that psychological maturity is the ability to take on many different identities, each depending on the needs of the moment. But beyond that is realizing the true nature of your own mind, which is originally without subject and object."
Meditation,3cf925,TheHeartOfTuxes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:56:34 2015 UTC,"Isn't the identity real though, just not constant?"
Meditation,3cf925,deterrence,3,Thu Jul 9 15:13:02 2015 UTC,"It's real in the sense that everything, even imagined stuff, is real. But the self is not what you think it is.  Rather than dealing with it theoretically, which is always subject to the severe limitation of words and concepts, it would be much better to see directly. Thus there are many meditative (and contemplative) practices that bring attention to the impermanent and interdependent nature of that which we automatically and habitually think of as an ongoing 'thing'.  When you are shown how to identify the Big Dipper in the sky, you can hardly see it without seeing the Big Dipper shape. But the Big Dipper originally doesn't exist. The stars are only visually close, but in space they are far away from each other. The stars never said ""we are the Big Dipper""; humans added that idea. It's just a way of organizing thought around a constellation of separate things. But when you look up and see that shape, it is difficult to see only the stars as they are without seeing the added template of 'Big Dipper'.  Similarly, it is extremely difficult for us to undo our 'knowledge' about an existing identity; and furthermore we have tremendously deep and ingrained attachment to this constellation of self — inconceivably more attachment than we have for the Big Dipper, which is already difficult to un-see, or to see in its real aspect without added concept. So in this sense, the Big Dipper is unreal; it's a fabrication, as is identity."
Meditation,3cf925,TheHeartOfTuxes,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:01:03 2015 UTC,"I suppose that my question still stands though... To put it in your terms, if we break the habit of thinking of the self as an ongoing thing, and start thinking of it as a variable, interconnected aggregate of all these conditions feeding into it, doesn't it still have some 'thingness'?   I also feel like stretching your analogy... The big dipper isn't a real structure as much as it's just a trick of perspective, but that trick is really useful because I can use it to find Polaris to navigate my way home. Could that usefulness not be the Big Dipper's 'thingness'?"

When, in meditation, you and your experience unify, you have a chance to experience that unity as your own being. You can directly perceive the nature of everything — the substance of everything, as it were.  It is not dissimilar to waking up from a dream with the direct experience of its dream substance: that whole world, including your dream identity, is made of dream substance, made of mind.  We can talk and talk about whether it's this or that, but the talk can only go so far. It can't uproot your basic doubt. You need to see for yourself. If you want to remove the doubt underlying your life, take up training with a respected teacher in a tradition of awakening.   Subject + Object = Enlightenment"

Meditation,3cf925,deterrence,2,Thu Jul 9 18:40:58 2015 UTC,"Well for starters, it's good to know that it's not what you think it is, and it's good to know that concepts are limited; so that's worth sharing.

We all have the identity of our physical bodies, but we also construct an identity of our thoughts, values, or attributes we imagine ourselves to possess in some quantity greater or less than other people's. But its all imaginary. Empty. A facade.  This imaginary constructed identity is necessary to some degree, for communicating with others, but if you believe it is really who you are, you will be held back from achieving any kind of true or lasting happiness in life.  Identity is constructed by the subconscious and conditioned by input from our environment. It isn't you. And it limits us in so many ways, often preventing us from doing what would really make us happy."

Anyone could look at the universe, with all of its crazy physics and relativity and star-making supernovas, all of its life, its rainbows and storm clouds, its snow flakes, its animals, its dancing and music, and then decide all of that means ""nothing"", it is ""nothing"".   Or you could look at it and see awe and beauty, and stand in utter amazement at how magical the whole thing is.   In the same way you can do the same about yourself and your role in it.

Meditation,3cf925,jonmatifa,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:17:54 2015 UTC,"There seems to the idea that because there is a false notion of self or identity then all notions of self or identity are false. As popular as the idea of no-self, or the illusionary self are, there plenty of others who believe in a relevant concept of ""self"", for instance Carl Jung, Carl Rogers, etc. There are a variety of thoughts about what constitutes the ""genuine self"" and different people using different terminology, but the overall idea of coherent wholeness of the mind seems to be consistent. You could approach meditation with ""no-self"" in mind and abandon all pretenses to identifying with anything including yourself but presumably all genuine aspects of what make you ""you"" would endure and be present in a way that wouldn't require any thought. Perhaps that's what many people mean when they advocate for ""no-self"", the concept isn't necessary even though it may be relevant. On the other hand, some may advocate for ""no-self"" because they are terrified of their inner reality and cope by dissociating with it. I wouldn't presume anyone was doing that, however, I'm weary of that possibility. According to Jung, ""There is no coming to consciousness without pain."" and if it is the meditator's goal to avoid suffering and pain, he/she may do so at the expense of themselves."

Meditation,3cf925,SpaceCadetJones,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:23:12 2015 UTC,"I find the common philosophy on this sub (really meditation in general I guess) interesting as it's so different from mine. I had read a few articles and such touting why meditation is great, but while I found it interesting I never tried it as it was so different from how I functioned. I generally walk around in circles all day thinking and thinking about ideas and analyzing things. Not the negative living in the past, worrying about the future sort of way a lot of meditators talk about. I just have a very creative and busy mind, it can actually be a little maddening sometimes when it gets too loud.  What brought me to meditation was seeing all of the research behind the benefits of mindfulness in psychology circles. I have a very difficult time regulating my attention and sometimes emotions (have been diagnosed with ADHD), so I decided to give it a whirl. I thought it would be tough since I generally like to be on my feet all the time, but I found after 10 sessions or so it really became natural and very refreshing. I continue to practice in hopes continue improving my personal awareness, increasing focus, and better understanding myself. I find the idea of being in the present all the time and eliminating ego very interesting and I love hearing what that side has to say, but it's not what I'm looking for. I like my ego most of the time, I'm hoping to have a better relationship with it and to keep it in balance."
Meditation,3cf925,SteelTooth,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:20:54 2015 UTC,The self is an illusion of ego.   The primary goal of meditation is to secede from the physical self so that only the observer remains to observe himself. In this the ego dies as one realizes that the self they spent their lifetime identifing as never truly existed. It was a false construct of the nature of how the body and the observer coexist.

Then of course,everyone develops persona's.they start small.bieng one way with your mother to bieng the other way with your friend.then it can go big where someone out of hurt adopts a persona of a thug.years later when they have been to jail,speak like a thug,listens to thug music.this person who started acting like a thug now believes himself to be a thug.how on earth will meditation help this person who thinks is a thug.it wont help him for long,for him to have any progress he will have to let go of the thug persona.  Which comes back to you.no one holds a philosophy that you must dissasociate from who you are.the thing is meditation is a cure.the more you do it,the more you end up letting go of your beliefs,actions and inactions,thoughts and feelings.to someone else this looks like dissasociating but the reality is that this person going through this is letting go of all they have aquired.

Meditation,3cevkb,clickstation,2,Tue Jul 7 11:24:51 2015 UTC,"Nirvana is definitely Buddhist first.  Not sure when moksha came about, but the concept is vaguely similar between Brahminism (proto-Hinduism) and Jainism, and Jaina moksha definitely existed at the time.   Anyway, the extinguishing in 'nirvana' refers to putting out the five aggregates, which is only non-existence if you conflate the aggregates with self. ;)"

Meditation,3cevkb,TheHeartOfTuxes,4,Tue Jul 7 20:06:29 2015 UTC,"You can get into deep states of meditation that seem to be nirvana,  but are temporary.    As you persist in returning to those states, then it becomes permanent.    The whole point of yoga is union ""Having that gain where there is no greater gain"".    You are intellectualizing this stuff too much, and letting doubts and worries hinder your practice.     Nirvana is not the permanent extinguishing of anything but your troubles, or the Buddha would have ceased to exist as soon as he attained it.    The reason desires are extinguished in the state of nirvana is that you have so much joy that desiring anything to make you happier would be like a man in a lake full of gold coins asking for more money.    The people who have attained this state say that it feels like they were striving all their lives for a thousand dollars, only to find that they became a billionaire (in inner joy and wisdom).    The yogis describe two states of samadhi -- sabikalpa (""with difference"") samadhi which is a state of union where the outer body is dead to the world but the consciousness is united to everything.   The next higher state of nirbikalpa (""without difference"") samadhi is one where the body is walking and talking and continuing all of its outer activities while the inner consciousness is still in samadhi, or union.   The outer body consciousness is merely a distraction from the inner bliss.  However when a person is firmly established in the experience of that inner bliss, even external body consciousness  cannot distract him (the yoga scriptures state).   At that time it is impossible to have desires, because nothing can add to that condition.  Only a beggar asks for money -- the billionaire has all he needs."
Meditation,3cevkb,GhatsbysGhost,2,Tue Jul 7 15:02:44 2015 UTC,"Nirvana is not a state, so not subject to change. In a conventional sense it is attained, because we need to gather the conditions that allow us to overcome the habits, attachments, blind spots, negative tendencies, and other obstacles that cover up this basic and essential non-thing. In an absolute sense it is not attained because there is not really a self to attain anything, and Nirvana has never not been our essential nature.  But in its essence Nirvana is not created or conditioned or changing in any way; and after we 'attain' it, it is not lost.  Along the way you may have glimpses of your original (Nirvanic) nature, but the glimpses are conditional and temporary as long as there is some vestige of clinging to selfhood and appearance. If you think of Nirvana as a 'thing' at all — as an object or state or dimension — you will be completely off the mark.  Next, as a point of practice: if you want to progress in spiritual practice you should embrace humility. Clinging to opinion regenerates the illusion of self which is the very obstacle we are trying to overcome. These kinds of personal beliefs are just speculation. If you don't know, it is much better to admit that you don't know than to dredge up one more in an endless litany of opinions to cover the fact. Focus on practice. Be curious, do your inquiry, but free yourself from speculation and opinion. It will reap benefits in your spiritual career.  We have been deeply conditioned to think that we have to know. Many times in our lives, we have been called to task or shamed for not having the answer or being in on the joke. We carry this habit with us into spiritual practice, where it doesn't belong. It is a tremendous hindrance to seek a sort of prideful comfort by making opinions, rather than the plain honest truth. Don't settle for anything other than complete freedom from doubt, which is only attainable through experience — through the practice of letting go of concept — and never attainable through thinking-understanding. Nirvana is boundless and uncreated; how can thought touch it?"
Meditation,3cevkb,MerchantR,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:35:19 2015 UTC,"It is my understanding that there are two distinct states of Nirvana. Nirvana, and Parinirvana.  Nirvana being an extinguishing of unsatisfactoriness in this life, and Parinirvana being a final cessation that comes with death."
Meditation,3cevkb,rodeozz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:16:40 2015 UTC,Here is my understanding of this: Desire leads to suffering and nirvana is the liberation of all suffering. In this state mind no longer clings to desires.  Nirvana is not merely a trance state. It is  a fundamental shift in your perspective brought about by long term meditation.
Meditation,3cdw4i,ndc3,8,Tue Jul 7 03:45:43 2015 UTC,"Mindfulness of breathing:   Focus on the breath.   A. Pick either a physical sensations (e.g: the rise and fall of the abdomen, the breath passing through the nose, the breath passing the tip of the nose, etc... ), a mental concept (""in"" and ""out"", or a point in space that the breath passes, or the process of the rising and falling of the abdomen, etc... ) or both. The mind will begin to wander. When you notice it has (a moment of mindfulness) return focus to the breath. Rinse and repeat.   Sometimes a moment of mindfulness is not enough to let go of thoughts (when trying to return to your anchor) though. In that case, there are a few different techniques that will allow you to bring the mind back to your anchor.   Here is a link that explains 5 different techniques for letting go:  Vitakkasanthana Sutta: The Relaxation of Thoughts   The Buddha offers five practical methods of responding wisely to unskillful thoughts (thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion)  If you have any questions just ask."

I couldn't sit for one minute without obsessing over thoughts that passed through. Soon, depending on how often you practice, you get tired of listening to every nagging thought and feel comfortable and ""ok"" to let them slip by. My trick was I had to trust myself to know I will take care of what I needed to when I could and that right now is me time. All my issues or appointments will be there after I sit still for X amount of minutes. I can now comfortably sit for twenty minutes. It took two years of practice. You will be different but whatever you do, DONT GIVE UP! Please take a break once in awhile (a day or week) and please feel ok about the break. You'll always come back stronger than you left it.

Meditation,3cdw4i,RedheadedYogi,2,Tue Jul 7 03:55:15 2015 UTC,I also have ADHD. My advice is to pick a tradition and start really really slow. Ppl with ADHD have a very hard time starting new habits and keeping them. Start when 5 minutes a day and tack on 2 or 3 minutes every other week. At no point do you want it to feel like a chore. If you're in it for the long haul starting out a little slow shouldn't be an issue for you and it will solidify the habit and make it second nature.   If you want advice on which practice to choose and how to go about it from an ADHD perspective I would be more than happy to share my personal experience with you.

As in, she's MY girlfriend, and it's unfair for life to take her somewhere else. We have to accept that someone or something does not belong to us, just because our mind may put them in a ""my things"" box. They live their own life, and you may be totally powerless to put yourself into their life. I'm not a meditation master or some genius on the forefront of a new thought.

When you try to observe the breath it will suddenly wander away and start thinking about random thoughts. All would agree that whatever action we make it is based on thoughts (microthoughts and can be macrothoughts). If one does have control over the flow of thoughts, one does not have control over actions. Which means that we have limited control over our lifes. Our characters, our actions are based on the habits we generate over years and these habits are comprised of the society, community or the family that we grow in.

Meditation,3c9tg5,buttcrabs,3,Mon Jul 6 18:54:24 2015 UTC,"From what I've read on it, TM is simple mantra meditation. A lot of the money supposedly goes towards getting the right mantra and pronouncing it right.  When it comes right down to it, it seems like the money goes into a Buddhist koan of a finger pointing at the moon. Focusing on how to pronounce a mantra and what mantra to use are like looking at someone's finger, when that finger is trying to direct your attention to the moon.  I'm guessing other major benefits of TM, though, is that it could provide structure for people to first begin learning and motivating themselves to stay on track, but any retreat does that and many don't cost that much. For celebrities, TM seems to be very popular because money often isn't an issue."

It's been shown in the past that the mantra is based entirely on your age and gender, though maybe that's changed now.   For celebrities, TM seems to be very popular because money often isn't an issue.   I do wonder if that was kind of the point of TM - when they started, it was free, when the guy who started it was dying he jacked the price up. I wonder (in a dangerously conspiracy theory kind of way, but the thought comes up all the same) if it was kind of an attempt to 'market' TM at rich people because rich people tend to have the most sway in society; that if they could get the rich hooked on meditation, perhaps through the media meditation would catch on in a more widespread way."

Not depending on certain sources in order to establish credibility, that's easily antonymic to the meaning of critical thought. I typed up my thoughts on TM in another comment not too long ago. Although yoi're not the first to say something like that, I'll say I don't really understand it.  Just a quick google search pulled up this  Like the cliche now, it says as little as it can and then tells you to go off and find  teacher. But even still it manages to underline:    Though TM is not a mantra-based meditation in the sense that its main core and direction is oriented towards transcending, it does involve use of mantras.   My opinions come from objective reesearch of the Yogi himself, the original movement, and it's orginal intents. The reason it's able to be represented as a mantra-based meditation is only due to the wesrern colloquialization of the meaning of mantra.  Indian mantras are specific ritual changes, general mantras are sayings, moods, or sounds that you express to yourself in your own head. So in a very loose sense TM does that, because you are meditating, and you are focussed on something. People even describe the trandscendtal aspect as some kind of esoteric note or hymn that you hear in your head while you are TMing, and there's some truth to that, but that what gets labeled a mantra. Even though the whole original goal of it was to achieve the focus without any of the man-made crutches. I really don't get why this whole sub seems to be so stuck on that and can't see through it, I really thought the amount of critical thought necessary for that would be minimal compared to what this sub is capable of."

In any case, it appears that many sources say TM at least uses mantras, so if that's incorrect, IMHO there's a larger education issue to be tackled, and the issue doesn't appear to be lack of critical thought, but more that the sources available do seem to point to mantras being part of TM.  It might be more practical to find a new/different term to describe what you're talking about, since attempting to define TM to exclude use of mantras would appear to be a difficult uphill battle AFAICT?"

The other half of the problem is people considering them not only as a legitimate source, but also as the only one.  Most of my understanding comes from reading Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's own words about TM, the one who started TM in India in the 50s instead of the Western organizations that have picked up the label for something else recently.  Your own soul is the primary source for this. Meditation should come as naturally to people as eating, breathing and sleeping. It's something that is inherent within us and should come on it's own without any man-made crutches (like sayings, classes, and most techniques in general). The world we live in today though is anti-conducive to this, which is why you find a mass unfamiliarity with true meditative practices and the ability for false-hopes to flourish.  Just look at the word itself. Transdcendental. The idea is to transcend all time, space, and especially anything man-made. You can completely forget about transcending the first two if you can't transcend the man-made. The idea of true TM is to access the core of your nature and to reach the mindset possible without any man-made crutches.   The goal is to keep your focus on your breath instead of any man-made sayings or counting, etc. You use nothing but your own body exactly the way God made it, and what is inherent within you to maintain your focus. And that focus is the meditation itself. You attaining it completely on your own without the man-made crutches is what generates the exponentially greater results."

""In the original 1958 TM, a single syllable (mantra) was used, and there were not ""personal"" mantras, that were introduced in 1969. The results seem to be the same (read testimonials), but TM teachers will tell you that personal mantras are necessary to make TM unique, so that TM results can't be achieved in any other way. You compare, you decide. Here is what TM teachers will tell you: 1) different, personal mantras are indispensable for an effective meditation; 2) no technique is as effective as TM; 3) no valid technique can be learned through a manual; 4) you must spend $2,500.00 (update: reduced to $1,500.00 in 2013) if you want to learn an effective meditation (TM).""  From here:  ""Transcendental Meditation is just a fancy name for a common variety of meditation in which a mantra – a word or series of syllables – is repeated with the intention of creating a meditative state. Pretty much any word or syllable will do, despite the hype of TM, which insists that a mantra can only be given by a ""qualified"" instructor. The TM initiate is told never to reveal her mantra under any circumstances, lest its magic be lost. My instructor suggested that he had some particular insight into me in choosing my mantra, but this is utter nonsense. People who have taught TM have admitted that they are given a list of mantras they’re supposed to divvy out according to age and gender. Nothing mystical about it. Here’s one list, which contains a version of my ""personal"" mantra. In violation of the sacred rules of TM, I’m now going to reveal it to you: “aima.” That’s my mantra. Two syllables. Vaguely pleasant sounding. If I repeat it consistently for several minutes, I begin to feel a little spacey. The same thing happens, I have found, when I repeat the word “Tallahasee.”""  And the reference list linked in that article: here  Here is an excerpt from an interview:  Smith: Suppose [...] I say: please tell me how to meditate transcendentally. What advice would you give me?  Maharishi: I'll suggest to you... one syllable.  Smith: A syllable? What you mean?  Maharishi: By syllable I mean some sound...  Smith: ... like 'rose', for example, 'room'... ?  Maharishi: No, some sound which will not have any meaning. Its value will be just the sound.  Smith: Well, could you give me an example of such a sound?  Maharishi: [...] When we say a rose, then the mind goes on the rose and the mind floats on the horizontal level [...]: thinking, contemplating something, is the horizontal activity of the mind...  Smith: ... can you give me an example of such a syllable?  Maharishi: Examples? We don't give [...]  Smith: So you keep it a secret.  Maharishi: It's a secret. Everyone is told to keep that sound, on which he experiences the subtle states [...], to keep it in himself.   ————  Can you share with me some resources that justify what you're saying? I just pulled these up to demonstrate what my point of view is based on. From what I understand of TM, what you're saying isn't accurate. If I'm mistaken I'd like to know, as I haven't taken a TM course."
Meditation,3c9tg5,elsimer,5,Mon Jul 6 13:09:51 2015 UTC,"The TM courses themselves being considered as legitimate sources on true TM is half the problem. The other half of the problem is people considering them not only as a legitimate source, but also as the only one.  Most of my understanding comes from reading Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's own words about TM, the one who started TM in India in the 50s instead of the Western organizations that have picked up the label for something else recently.  Your own soul is the primary source for this. Meditation should come as naturally to people as eating, breathing and sleeping. It's something that is inherent within us and should come on it's own without any man-made crutches (like sayings, classes, and most techniques in general). The world we live in today though is anti-conducive to this, which is why you find a mass unfamiliarity with true meditative practices and the ability for false-hopes to flourish.  Just look at the word itself. Transdcendental. The idea is to transcend all time, space, and especially anything man-made. You can completely forget about transcending the first two if you can't transcend the man-made. The idea of true TM is to access the core of your nature and to reach the mindset possible without any man-made crutches.   The goal is to keep your focus on your breath instead of any man-made sayings or counting, etc. You use nothing but your own body exactly the way God made it, and what is inherent within you to maintain your focus. And that focus is the meditation itself. You attaining it completely on your own without the man-made crutches is what generates the exponentially greater results."

I agree with your take on this and I've said the same things about meditation in the past. The confusion is just coming up because you've been using the term TM, Transcendental Meditation, capitalized, which people take to refer to the brand. I think we're both on the same page in disapproving of the branding of it and the mantra focus. It's just confusing to use the name of the technique that's being sold, but not referring to that.  Also I did ask for resources, saying that my soul is the primary source is great and all, I get what you mean, but it doesn't help justify using the phrase ""Transcendental Meditation"" to refer to something other than what people take it to mean. If you could provide some of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's words on TM where he talks NOT about mantra practice, that would help a great deal."
Meditation,3c9tg5,alien_lanes,2,Mon Jul 6 13:59:25 2015 UTC,"/r/nondirective has many different meditations on its sidebar some with mantras some without. All of these meditations are using the same technique as TM. I have never seen anywhere where Maharishi Mahesh yogi describes TM as focusing on the breath. At some points the awareness may go onto the breath and stay with it, but it is not anchored there. The point of these meditations is to allow the awareness to be free, able to transcend."
Meditation,3c9tg5,elsimer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:03:33 2015 UTC,"I'm using the abbreviation for the obvious reason that I didn't feel like typing out a long term over and over, any time I was referring to the movement I made that obvious.  I could give you resources but it wouldn't say anything radically different than what you've heard. It's labeled as a mantra practice, but telling people to focus on a mantra is disingenuous. You're supposed to focus on the intrinsic properties of your body, and the mindset will come to you. So they decided to label that mindset a mantra, and that confuses people. That's the only real problem. You got to understand that it's not all one big fallacy, and I'm not claiming that. It's just presented in the least easy-to-understand way as possible. But the thing with brands is that they need short, simple, easy to repeat sayings that they can hammer into their customer base. They don't care about how good of a result you get from the product, the only thing they care about is that you keep coming back for more. So that's why you have all these people running around yelling ""Transcendental Meditation! Do it! You just say a mantra to yourself!"" It could be explained much better, but then it'd be boring and not interesting because you would have to think and try to figure out what they're trying to say, makes it a lot harder to attract people to the product. Just another compound issue in the endless communication of society."

How my body and mind feel heavy, how time seems to slow down, etc. If I begin to nod off, I usually call off the session because otherwise I will just fall asleep, but I will meditate until the nodding begins.   On some occasions when I don't really have any other responsibilities, I like to try meditating while nodding off. I try to be aware of the exact moment my head falls. I can sometimes maintain awareness in the half-asleep state where you're partially dreaming, but still not quite asleep and just being aware of the visual hallucinations my mind is creating.

Meditation,3cdhfp,Dispassionfruit,2,Tue Jul 7 13:16:17 2015 UTC,"I believe there are two types of tiredness: First we need to differentiate between the two types of sleepiness, I generally classify them into two areas. ""illusory"" and ""real"" tiredness.    Sloth and torpor - are forces in the mind that drain vitality and limit effort(lethargic state of mind). (Read further: http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/books-articles/articles/the-five-hindrances-handouts/the-hindrance-of-sloth-and-torpor/) Genuine tiredness - its when you have spent a whole day working and you are indeed really tired.   Sloth and torpor happens when one is about to advance further into deeper concentration, such as access concentration. It's actually one of the five major defilements that is identified by the buddha.  One of the most effective methods that I use, would be to   Identify the sensation of the ""tiredness""  Simply put your attention on the sensation Stay with the sensation, until the sensation of sleepiness fades away.   The method works with the theory of ""impermanence"".  In addition:   One will need to gain a certain level of concentration from Samatha practice, before this is effective. If this doesn't work you are genuinely tired. Just take a nap."
Meditation,3cdhfp,TimTams1990,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:24:20 2015 UTC,I believe sloth refers to physical tiredness and torpor is mental laziness. But I think the point you make in regards to taking a nap if you have to still stands and was even suggested by the buddha.
Meditation,3cdhfp,Gojeezy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:55:04 2015 UTC,"Yes you are right Sloth manifests as a physical absence of vitality, while Torpor manifests as a mental lack of energy. The presence of sloth and torpor does not mean that energy is not available, it just means that we are not accessing it, therefore it's viewed as an illusion."
Meditation,3cdhfp,TimTams1990,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:07:11 2015 UTC,"If this doesn't work you are genuinely tired.   Very good, helpful post, except for this part. We can't necessarily say that if a bit of effort doesn't change the pattern, that means it's about physical ('genuine') tiredness. We don't know the karmic causes involved. Patterns of resistance may be piled up deeply. If that's the case, more ongoing effort is required.  One may need to harness external factors to one's benefit, changing lifestyle, adapting environment (clean space, fresh air, the right amount of stimulation — neither dead silent nor clamorous), connecting closely with a teacher, practicing with a group (where both the schedule and the group energy carry one through), and so on. Maybe cold showers twice a day....  As in my post in this thread, other lifestyle factors may apply, beyond mere exhaustion.  And substituting a nap for a sitting may or may not be appropriate, depending on one's intent in meditation. If the intent is to transcend deep habits, caving in to tiredness will not help. In contrast to one redditor's strategy of napping and then sitting, if one's motivation goes beyond temporary mood alteration I would suggest the other way around: don't skip practice ever, but take a nap or improve your sleep schedule after.  There is the exception in cases of extreme exhaustion, where not only is the slightest meditative effort impossible but one's health may depend on getting sleep now. Those cases are rare, and point to problems elsewhere in one's life. But even this exception is relative. For example, monks and advanced practitioners may commit to periods of practice with little or no sleep. Because of their motivation and their meditative focus it is possible. For someone with very clear motivation, it is even possible to be brighter and more energized through meditation than through sleep. I have met and lived with monks and nuns for whom this is the case, and I've experienced it myself at certain periods in my life. I know one monk, for example, who practices through the night — every night without fail — and who never sleeps lying down. It is beyond the capacity of the common person to conceive of this; but if you've done no-sleep practice, you may have a taste of the possibility.  And just a note on naps: Five to twenty minutes seems to be the ideal duration, according to studies. Short naps contribute to mental acuity and a feeling of brightness. After 20-30 minutes it becomes far more likely that you will experience stagnation and a feeling of extreme tiredeness. It would be better to take a short nap and then focus on getting a good night of sleep. For some people even a short nap during the day will make it more difficult to sleep well at night, in which case it would be better to forego the daytime nap altogether."
Meditation,3cdhfp,TheHeartOfTuxes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:36:06 2015 UTC,"I was hoping to just make my first post brief, but here goes. Yes, I do agree that a bit of effort does change the pattern, in my earlier post however I did also mention that the practitioner will need to differentiate (by investigating) for himself if the tiredness is genuine or not, and that requires the practitioner to be mindful about about himself and what he have been up to the past few days before he sits on the cushion. Perhaps he have been slogging away in his job and have been burning the midnight oil for the previous days, or he might have just woken up from his night's rest just a few minutes before his practice(I will normally start meditating only an hour after waking up), or that he have just done a marathon. I would consider these genuine tiredness, where the mind and body is truly in need of rest.   However, if the practitioner have been sleeping too much or taking too much naps, and he have not done any strenuous activities in the previous days prior to meditation, that is sloth and torpor.  Therefore, mindfulness is important he will need to investigate this for himself, if it's illusionary or genuine.  I agree with your idea of not skipping. I should have rephrased myself for    If this doesn't work you are genuinely tired. Just take a nap.   into  ""If this doesn't work you are genuinely tired. Just take a nap and continue meditation after""  In addition, I would like to clarify with you that from my understanding that sloth(physical tiredness) may or may not be ""genuine"" too although it may be physical it may not be genuine. The defilement is called sloth and torpor for a reason, it's because they come as a package. Don't forget the mind and body link. It's like when you drop your head and face the floor during meditation the mind becomes a little sloppy, however when you raise the head a little or stop yourself from slouching you feel a little bit more alert. Also, to highlight the influence of the mind, with a change in mind's perspective we can see from this quote,   With a change in conditions, energy may reappear in a moment. This can be seen clearly in young children who switch from being “tired” (while shopping, for instance) to being energetic (about an offer of ice cream, for instance) in a matter of seconds. The energy level depends on whether they evaluate the situation as boring or exciting."

Differences in approach will always appear, and the don't necessarily mean that one way is right and the other wrong.  The point about the mind influencing the energy is very interesting, and very good for students to grasp. That one point can serve a student well if they take it to heart.  Another example, and one I've witnessed from both the student and facilitator roles, is the difference in energy that becomes available when the task at hand becomes about 'me'. We ask people to find a partner, and one partner tries to ignore the other, while the other does anything and everything to get their partner's attention. The eruption of energy that happens when the situation becomes about getting attention is incredible.  We also see quite often a tired, grumbly, defeated demeanour among family members turn suddenly to brightness when a visitor appears at the door: ""Hiiii! How are you?"" It shows how much of our reality is based on thoughts we have about our situation."

I've known a lot of people who basically go to sleep in sitting posture. Of course, they feel very refreshed. They've had nice feelings, perhaps nice dreams. It's not necessarily the same as correct meditation.  But there is something to the notion that tiredness can help your practice. When you are tired, your karma is also 'tired'. The mind doesn't have as much energy or inclination to wander and fabricate. You can experience moments of simplicity and openhandedness where you just don't bother to make anything happen. This can be very revelatory."

Meditation,3cdhfp,emmeline_grangerford,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:35:03 2015 UTC,"What's a 'good' meditation session?  Or maybe more to the point, what's not a 'good' meditation session?   Show me one thing in the world that is not medicine!   The limitation of your thought is what defines a session as good or bad. *Your task in meditation isn't to concern yourself with the result, but to offer your best effort in the moment. * When it's raining, things get wet. When you're out in the cold, you feel cold. When you're tired in meditation, your meditation has a tired quality. That's all. No problem.  If you commit to a practice, only do that practice. That is the only way you will be able to move beyond your current habits and obstacles. When we begin on the path, we are very conditional: our sense of things is very dependent on results; so we get pushed and pulled around by our habits and mindets rather than being able to see and act clearly. In order to move beyond this, we have to surrender our conditional nature. That is one reason why we commit to a schedule and structure of training. It is so that we can learn to be unconditional, like our original nature.  So if it's time to sit, only sit; and do your best.  If tiredness appears because your life is not in balance, then bringing it to balance will address this problem. Improve your sleep schedule and quality of sleep. Cut out unnecessary stresses and attachments.  Diet also can contribute to tiredness. Eating too many heavy foods like lots of meat or rich fatty food can bring an overall sluggishness. Eating sugars and refined carbohydrate foods, as found in many breads, snacks, and sodas, creates a blood sugar spike and rebound. When the body responds to a blood sugar spike, the sudden rush of energy becomes a sudden drop in energy. This can cause tiredness and dullness in sitting. Eating too much, or eating immediately before sitting in meditation can both cause drowsiness.  If there is imbalance in your physical activity it can lead to sluggishness and nodding off. Overexertion creates deep exhaustion over time, which can only be cured by taking better care of yourself and refraining from overextending. Under-exertion creates weakness and stagnation of body, mind, and energy, and your resulting feeling can be just as tired. You need to keep the energy moving, flowing, in your body, mind, and life.  Aside from issues of balance in lifestyle, one dynamic creates many of the dull, sluggish, tired experiences in meditation, and that dynamic is resistance. As you sit openhandedly, your inner life reorganizes itself. Deep-set patterns are freed to find their proper flow. Suppressed material bubbles up from the unconscious mind. The correct approach toward all of these movements is to continue moment-to-moment openhanded awareness: don't touch.  But the very fact that much of this material is — for us — unconscious and habitually ignored, denied, or suppressed makes it difficult for us to be aware of our unconscious and habitual reactions to it. In formal sitting meditation, we have put ourselves into a situation where we allow and face all kinds of new material (or new to our awareness, at least). We begin to come into contact with all the hidden and disowned parts of ourselves. Perhaps for some years or for most of our lives we have built up patterns of avoidance, but now we come face to face with the things we're not used to seeing and feeling. One of the ego's strategies, then, is to dim the awareness. ""If we can't avoid the sitting, then let's avoid being aware"", it says.  A sort of sub-category of this is lack of motivation or unclear motivation. When you are listless because things have started to become meaningless or hopeless, it is time to clarify your motivation. Why do meditation? Why bother to wake up and eat and keep yourself alive? Human life is a rare and precious opportunity to get clear and move beyond suffering. This point has to be very clear for meditative practice to have big energy. Unclear motivation means small energy for meditation and other pursuits.  Many meditators go through a phase or several phases where dullness and sleepiness seem to blanket the practice. It is often a sign that they are coming into closer contact with inner material that would otherwise be habitually suppressed or avoided. So persisting in meditation even when tired is no small deal. It can be a tremendous, transformative healing. It just doesn't feel spectacular. But the application of open awareness even through tiredness overcomes one of the deepest obstacles we have to awakening. The power that you attain with this practice is considerable.  The Five Desires or Five Attachments in Buddhist teaching are:   Attachment to sleep Attachment to food Attachment to sex Attachment to money (power) Attachment to fame   These are the categories of obstacles that most deeply control our thought and behavior. If you get free of these attachments you will be far beyond a common person, and you will be able to act with clarity and compassion in all kinds of situations. Imagine George Costanza from Seinfeld, elbowing past other people to make sure he gets a slice of cake. It's funny, but pitiful! That's what our mind is like in relation to these Five Desires. It's not a noble way of life, but it's our habitual way of life, unless we make great efforts to move beyond those attachments. That is why we commit to practicing even when tired: so tiredness doesn't control us, and we can develop the ability to show up for life and show up for others, independent of brightness or tiredness.  If your second sitting in the late afternoon is sluggish, it could be the time of day. You've been awake, you've done a lot with your action and thinking, you've engaged with many issues already; so it may not be the ideal time for feeling bright and energetic. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, if your Yin energy is deficient you may experience a sort of withering feeling later in the day, as the cool, supportive Yin energy in you has become too depleted by the heat and active energy of the day (like oil may get used up by a hot engine). The effect of deficient Yin may be something like the wilting of a flower when it doesn't have enough water. Eating more calming, nurturing foods like watery vegetables can gradually support the Yin. Taking more restful breaks and in general turning down the hot activity of your life can help. Don't 'burn the candle at both ends'. In extreme cases, herbal medicines and bodywork like acupuncture and certain massage therapies can help.  But you may also want to try meditation early in the day, when you first wake up. That is a good time for bright practice. Very early morning (3 - 5am) and midnight are also traditionally times when your personal energy and the earth's energy work together to make very bright meditation. One of the signs of this bright energy is the fact that many men get erections in early morning, even in their sleep. In spiritual traditions they will sometimes direct this energy toward awakening in meditative practice."

Then, after you develop concentration and mindfulness, when new problems arise they won't be so bad.  Mindfulness of breathing:   Focus on the breath.   A. Pick either a physical sensations (e.g: the rise and fall of the abdomen, the breath passing through the nose, the breath passing the tip of the nose, etc... ), a mental concept (""in"" and ""out"", or a point in space that the breath passes, or the process of the rising and falling of the abdomen, etc... ) or both. The mind will begin to wander. When you notice it has (a moment of mindfulness) return focus to the breath. Rinse and repeat.   Sometimes a moment of mindfulness is not enough to let go of thoughts (when trying to return to your anchor) though. In that case, there are a few different techniques that will allow you to bring the mind back to your anchor.

You can watch that urge (or desire) to control arise. You can sit with it and be uncomfortable...""I want to make it do this, I want to make it do that."" You can condition yourself to observe it, but not engage with it.   Let it be - it will come, and it will go. Just like everything else that arises when you meditate.   Your breath teaches you two things:   Whatever arises will cease.  You don't have to try and control things, and in most cases your ability to control anything is just an illusion to begin with."

Meditation,3ccfjw,SamuelColeridgeValet,4,Mon Jul 6 20:57:34 2015 UTC,"According to a Zen teacher who was asked about this at a Buddhist forum, Zazen means awareness of natural breath, not controlled breathing.  I would just comment that, because it's best to be relaxed before starting to meditate, and because controlled breathing is a good way to relax, I don't see anything wrong with a short time of controlled breathing before you start to meditate.  Slow, deep breathing through the nose, hand on the abdomen to feel it rise and fall, has been shown to help people deal with high blood pressure.  Only two or three minutes of this can have a relaxing effect."
Meditation,3ccfjw,Gullex,2,Mon Jul 6 21:11:19 2015 UTC,That's one interpretation of zazen. Not all teachers teach awareness of breath. Zazen is kind of a tough cookie to adequately explain.

Meditation,3ccfjw,Redfo,2,Mon Jul 6 21:49:29 2015 UTC,When starting Zazen: Breathing out is with conscious control. Breathing in happens on its own. Once this settles into its rhythm there is no need to force breathing.

Meditation,3cdbvz,Smeed,2,Tue Jul 7 00:54:20 2015 UTC,"What is the present moment? It is 10 to the power -43 seconds. Where is the time to focus too much? It is ever changing! Consider the perception of breathing to be the same as the perception of the ever changing present.    The goal of single pointed meditation is to keep the object of meditation in the mind without movement, whatever the object of meditation may be. If you are doing that then that is very good.  Thinking that you are good at meditation is normal. I would guess that it takes years of practice to escape the ego-self."
Meditation,3cdbvz,MerchantR,2,Tue Jul 7 02:14:18 2015 UTC,"This peace has led me to think that I'm pretty good at this meditation thing.    Enjoy the peace.  Stop thinking about your feelings. Just enjoy them.  Keep focusing on your breath.  More than anything else, you are your breath."
Meditation,3cdbvz,AmazingGraced,2,Tue Jul 7 03:59:07 2015 UTC,"Is it possible to focus too much on the breath, the point of sacrificing your presence?   The breath is always arising and passing away in the present moment. You can focus on it to the exclusion of other sensations that are arising in the present moment but it is important to develop a certain level of concentration. If you are practicing mindfulness of breathing, when other sensations arise just note them (be aware of them) then return to your anchor.   I find the most focusing on the sound of ""now"" and letting go of my desire to watch my breath or to really exert any control over anything at all.    If it works for you then it works. Simple. Although, I would caution that you could be falling into the mindfulness hindrance of sloth-torpor if you don't focus on anything at all.   What do you mean by focusing on the sound of ""now""?   I almost imagine myself as a dog, unaware of the past, future or ticking of the clock.   If you do this during your meditation session then it is a hindrance to developing mindfulness and concentration."

You can just start by sitting up straight and focusing on relaxing and/or following the breath. It really is that simple. Later of course if you feel like it you can start trying out some fancy techniques, but till then that's pretty much it.

As far as mindfulness, this will get you started:  Mindfulness of breathing:   Focus on the breath.   A. Pick either a physical sensations (e.g: the rise and fall of the abdomen, the breath passing through the nose, the breath passing the tip of the nose, etc... ), a mental concept (""in"" and ""out"", or a point in space that the breath passes, or the process of the rising and falling of the abdomen, etc... ) or both. The mind will begin to wander. When you notice it has (a moment of mindfulness) return focus to the breath. Rinse and repeat.   Sometimes a moment of mindfulness is not enough to let go of thoughts though. In that case, there are a few different techniques that will allow you to bring the mind back to your anchor.

So, for me it's not quite that I'm not making progress or I feel as I did before starting meditation, but it's more so a bunch of anger because of this wall or whatever emotions are hidden are starting to leak out inappropriately.

I've gone past blocks before - I've hit multiple walls - and it is kind of shitty just immediately after I get past it.  It makes me anxious about keeping to do it, but I have to remember that meditation is all about acceptance.  In the case of a wall, it means keep trying and stick with it, but maybe accept that your mind/brain is just not ready to get to that level yet.  It needs some patience and some time to ready itself.  Even when there is a wall, just like in physical sports, the brain is re-organizing itself just like an athlete's body is re-organizing even when progress cannot be seen."

Meditation,3cbsh7,startingfromscratch2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:59:56 2015 UTC,"I fear whatever emotional baggage is behind that wall is finding a way into my life.   Yeah but the emotional baggage creeps into your life worse if you do not face it and express it than if you do.  Meditation helps bring it to the surface, so you feel it and express it, and then that baggage has less control over your life.  Without its expression, it just sinisterly and creepily sneaks in and affects your life without you being able to recognize it and have power over it; so it has power over you.  With meditation, you gain the power.  The baggage will still be there, but you will have power over it, versus it controlling you.   I have been meditating for just over four months.  I was doing breathing and body focused meditation (focus on breath, focus on heart rate, focus on bodily sensations) but then a few weeks ago I switched to non-directive (just let my mind wander, let thoughts come in and go out).  It's been good. You?"
Meditation,3cbsh7,startingfromscratch2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:45:00 2015 UTC,"That's true. Then my issue is handling the baggage overall when it does creep into my life. I'll just have to keep working on it.   I'm glad your meditation has been great!  How has those four months been, discipline-wise, with keeping up with it? What's your routine? I ask because I'm only a month in, though I meditated on and off before that, so I'm curious about how you have kept up with it. After a while it becomes challenging and sometimes a chore.   For about a month I've stuck to focusing on my breathing. 20 minutes daily. Yoga before every meditation. For the first three weeks of it I was successful but thoughts started to wander and things in my life began to get chaotic on the fourth week (now). So, I just started letting my thoughts wander too and just acknowledge what they are when they pop up. It's been a great relief when something has been bugging me and I'm able to dissect it and my mind not judge, which was problematic before. The voice in my head wasn't kind before I began meditating but I find myself reverting back to that with this emotional wall (hence my original posting of concern)."

Its become part or my day now though, even though I don't do it at the same time every day its just become a part of my daily routine.   It also took me up until a month or two ago to really see and appreciate the benefits of meditation. Give yourself time to get used to it. Once you start to feel the benefits of it you'll find it easier to enjoy. I'd say definitely stick with it. It definitely has its ups and downs. I felt like it wasn't working for a long time, and then I felt like I was getting it for a while, and then I felt like I went way backwards and wasn't doing it right. Now I feel like I'm getting it and really benefiting from it again. You've just gotta keep going, and see where it takes you, and just trust that if you stick with it long enough you will see a change.  Edit: Also I still find it hard to focus pretty much every time. But I've learnt not to let that worry me, or stop me. As long as I keep trying, and keep focusing after I'm distracted its all good."

Rlysrh makes a great point that I just wanted to reiterate; this shouldn't worry you at all. In fact, every time you realize your mind has wandered off you've actually achieved a victory."
Meditation,3cbrhs,startingfromscratch2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:47:56 2015 UTC,Nice way of looking at it.
Meditation,3cbrhs,startingfromscratch2,2,Tue Jul 7 08:06:31 2015 UTC,"Hi Ruben, can you give us more info? What is your meditation technique, how long each session, how many times a day, etc.?  The two most basic problems people encounter are a ""dull"" mind (difficulty staying alert/awake) and an ""overactive"" mind (difficulty concentrating). Fortunately for you, it seems you have no problem staying alert :-) !!!  Maybe try a relaxation technique immediately before you meditate. A very basic method is to create tension in all your body (flex all your muscles tightly for a couple seconds) and then proceed from head to toe relaxing each muscle as completely as possible.   Then maybe shorten your meditation time per session, but try to have more frequent sessions. One thing you might be overlooking- in the beginning your concentration will increase, but your awareness will also increase. So while you are improving in concentration you are also getting better at realizing how overactive your mind really is!!! So it may seem like you are making no progress (or for me it even felt like I was going backwards) for quite some time!  At work right now so I didn't go into too much detail, but I will check back-- if anything I am saying resonates with you I am happy to elaborate in more detail."
Meditation,3cbrhs,Painismyfriend,2,Mon Jul 6 18:19:24 2015 UTC,"Oh just to agree with /u/mbalavi, when I was doing the shorter sessions initially, I did do them several times a day. 5 minutes = 4 times per day, 15-20 minutes = 2x a day, and generally 40 mins is once a day.  So yeah, the shorter sessions multiple times is better than one long, frustrating session."
Meditation,3c9wqr,Nofapemergency,28,Mon Jul 6 06:20:10 2015 UTC,"When the old patterns and ideas about what you were striving for start to fall away, there is always some frustration and feeling like life has become stagnant and without direction.  Be patient with yourself. You recognized the energy behind your ambition was fueled by old emotion reasoning instead of what's truly in your best interest. It is only natural for you to feel the way you now do. Do you want to keep that kind of false, fear driven ambition? If not, then decide that what has happened is OK and that it's the next logical step for you to feel the way you do. Better you come to this realization and feel the way you do now instead of figuring it out several years into med school.   Just because you're not necessarily going to go down the path you were thinking about, that doesn't mean the only alternative is for you to become a milquetoast monk sitting in your room. It only means you haven't stumbled onto the next, greater source for your energy and ambitions. However next time, you'll know yourself better and you can pursue it from a place of excitement that is less influenced by fear and feeling small.   Without trying to get too esoteric - in the mythos of the heroes journey, anytime he must leave the tribe to meet his calling and grow stronger, there is always backlash. People tell the hero that he can't journey into the forest, that he will grow weak and die and that he is best off remaining with them at at the camp. Psychologically interpreted, if he succumbs to the tribe (in this case, the tribe is both your thoughts, fears and the people around you, eg parents, teachers etc) then he will remain as he is, driven by the same symbols and meaning as the rest of the tribe. There is no growth. When people wander away from the prescribed tasks that the rest of the tribe is comfortable with, there is always backlash because they become afraid and are forced to face themselves and their own ideas. If people judge or doubt you, that is only the reflection of their own inner uncertainty and you can't let that dictate what you will become. If the hero continues to be brave, disregard the tribe and his fears of being condemned, he then follows his inner calling, and even though it is scary, the hero overcomes the trials, grows stronger and returns to the tribe to strengthen it.   Be proud that you are growing to understand yourself and have patience. You're doing well.  I am proud of u my nig"

Meditation,3c9wqr,Vigro318,7,Tue Jul 7 02:27:34 2015 UTC,So meditating helped you realize your ambitions were fueled by your need for acceptance?   If it's painfully obvious you were doing something you had no passion for I think you're a step closer to becoming self-actualized.   You will find anything you put the intention out that you're looking for.
Meditation,3c9wqr,lightqwerty,5,Mon Jul 6 07:13:26 2015 UTC,"You can look at it from a different perspective. Meditation actually helped you understand why you were following that ""dream"" or ""ambition"". Let's assume that you were not meditating and you never got the realization you have now. And lets assume that you made your way to a medical school...graduated...became a successful doctor. Now at that point if you realized what you have realized now, how do you think you would feel? I bet you would curse yourself for doing something just because you wanted to be accepted.   In other words, take it as a good sign that meditation has helped you get in touch with your ""true self"" and at least you have realized that this is not what you want (probably?).  Now, how about you start looking for what you want? I believe meditation can help you find that. And meditating doesnt mean ""getting molded in to a monk"" or losing your ambition.  My advice would be stop beating yourself up that you do not have any ambition and start a new beginning. I believe you are pretty young (20's may be) and it is not too late to start afresh. Atleast it is better than starting afresh in your 40s."
Meditation,3c9wqr,PostNationalism,0,Mon Jul 6 07:23:26 2015 UTC,"exactly. meditation certainly wont kill ambition. that said i think a life spent purely on meditation is quite useless. (too judgmental, i know)"

Meditation,3c9wqr,NO_LAH_WHERE_GOT,5,Mon Jul 6 14:56:00 2015 UTC,"Here's my experience: Meditation purifies ambition. It cleanses away all the baggage, all the obssessive need to prove things. It removes the prickles and leaves behind what's true– childlike curiosity, wonder, awe, and a love of laughter, happiness, service.  You don't need to become a monk in a monastery if you don't want to. You don't need to become a medical student if you don't want to.  Meditation is about listening to yourself, and in the silence and the calm you start to get a clearer sense of who you are.  Sit in silence. Listen for gratitude. Listen for joy. Listen for service. And in those things, you will find work and challenges that stretch you. And you will smile in service of those goals, and you will shine with ambition. Or maybe you won't, but it doesn't matter.  Listen to yourself. You already know the answers. You're asking us this because youré hoping we have the answers. We don't. You do.   Listen."

Meditation,3c9wqr,nani_kore,3,Mon Jul 6 07:10:58 2015 UTC,"Here the thing: I always acknowledged that I had a fear of failing while I was pursuing this goal.

The stress to the system builds up until you hit a wall and something got to give or it breaks apart. I could no longer lie to myself. My consultant contract was up for renewal and I quit my work that had become increasingly stressful. My landlord had tried to cancel my sublease for a year and I gave up fighting. My physical health was in decline. I ended up moving back with my mother and started to live off my savings.  After certain experiences while meditating my perspective shifted - some fundamental mistrust of life went away along with various pent up emotions. I used to have these conversations and arguments with my closest friend that I see now was fueled by this mistrust. I stopped engaging, I said ""no thanks"" to them, I no longer felt the need to rationalize my path. This was enough to challenge his perspective to the degree that he no longer felt I was respecting him. This ended 15 years of friendship.  I realized that I don't need my friend to validate my perspective. I learned that confidence flows from a place, from a strength that lies within me. Knowing that love, happiness, wisdom, strength, confidence, are qualities that flows from within has freed me from a lot of anxiety and worry. My health has improved - allergies and digestion issues have gone away. Not seeking validation and worrying what other people think has also removed a lot of social anxiety.  So I'm in my early thirties, lost my closest friend, have no income, and I'm living with my mother.. and I'm happier than ever."

I am ridden by anxiety and regreat about my failure to do more with myself by this age and I'm not sure saying "" i've meditated and I realized it's ok to be a loser will fly too good with my friends, family...and sincerily, myself!"" I would want to do something, more...i just don't really know how yet.

Meditation,3c9wqr,Ariyas108,3,Mon Jul 6 20:47:40 2015 UTC,"You are leaving some important things out in your explanation.   After almost 7 months of meditating, I've come to the realization that I have been chasing this 'dream' because I want to be accepted by friends and my family, specifically my father. In other words, I felt 'small' and I thought this 'dream' would bolster me up and make me look intelligent. I have had fears of feeling stupid and wanted to prove everyone wrong.   Here you explain your discovery: You have now understood why you are wanting to go to med school. That's a good thing.   Now, this realization is glaringly and painfully obvious and I cant go back to chasing medical school.    Why?  You don't answer that question. At all. It might be helpful if you express why you feel that you can't continue what you are doing. After all, being accepted by friends and family, making them happy and proud, is not necessarily a bad reason to do things.  If you want to make a decision, it is much easier to make it when you can clearly express your reasoning behind it. The less you leave implicit, the better you can understand what is actually going on.  What might be a good direction to think about in order to get more clarity about your future path in life, might be values: In the end you imply that making your family and friends proud and happy is not enough to justify your choice of a career. You don't seem to want to work in order to gain social recognition.   So if you don't want to work for social recognition, what is important to you? Furthermore, it might be a good idea to ask this question: Is it really not important to you to be recognized and accepted by others? Because, if it is, keeping with your current choice might still not be a bad idea."

Just because some of the reasons why you were doing something turn out to be superficial doesn't mean that you can't still find joy in what you do. You might not, but you may too. Slow down, and listen to yourself with more patience."
Meditation,3c9wqr,nani_kore,2,Mon Jul 6 16:45:21 2015 UTC,My 'realization' is glaringly and painfully obvious and I'm choosing not to attend medical school because my decision to chase this 'goal' stemmed from expectations of what my family and friends expected me to fulfill.  This goal did not stem from myself. It came from fears of not being good enough in the eyes of my friends and family. I let their expectations mold my ambitions.   I have realized that I want my ambitions to come from me and me alone. It is not important for to me to be recognized and accepted by others. This is why I am not choosing this path. Thank you for these thought provoking comments. Hah they really pushed me to think and search for an explanation.
Meditation,3c9wqr,Soumonev,3,Mon Jul 6 23:25:49 2015 UTC,"I think the main thing your post is hinging on is the fact that you weren't actually following your own ambition. If you were planning on medical school in order basically to change or shape other people's opinions of you, then essentially it was their ambitions/world-views/beliefs that shaped you. The fact that you no longer want to pander to them is, possibly, your own ambition coming to the forefront.  I think that you will not find meditation undermining your own ambitions or passions (except impulsive, destructive ones)."
Meditation,3c9wqr,Painismyfriend,3,Mon Jul 6 17:10:57 2015 UTC,"I'm a successful entrepreneur and meditation is what has allowed me to become one. It doesn't undermine ambitions, it clarifies them.

I stopped a bunch of freelance work and stepped out of being a part of some online shop that I still believe will be successful in about 3 years. Both of those were about money and while I'm not rich (relative term) I feel that spending my time not enjoying myself or not meditating isn't worth it.   I had a bunch of things that I was planning on doing and now I see things very differently and I don't feel the need to chase those ""dreams"". I've only been meditating for about 3 months so it's still very new to me. At times I get worried that I may end up becoming a monk and lose everything I've worked hard for, but that wouldn't really be a bad thing if it ends up happening. I'd be happy and alive.

And I was having doubts about it before, but I, too, after 6-7 months of meditating, had a sort of realization that going into medicine to impress people/feel ""smart""/prove myself to my parents and make them happy/etc. would be an insanely huge mistake.  Especially since I've recently been looking into the minimalist lifestyle and have decided I want to live in a small, eco-friendly, home - therefore pretty much rendering a doctor's salary unnecessary.  Since that day (it was kind of an ""awakening"" I think), I've slowly come back to my ego-centric self and kind of bullied myself into pursuing med-school again. But I'm scared that as my meditation practice continues, I'll have more and more moments where I come to the same realization."

And the goal being to end craving, you can't do that while remaining sexual. The Buddha started an order of celibate monks for a reason.

Meditation,3cb3an,mbalavi,2,Mon Jul 6 18:24:56 2015 UTC,"Hypnosis seems slightly different, because it almost implies a complete lack of self-awareness or mindfulness. You are more malleable and truthful because your conscious mind is shut down so you aren't connected to your senses anymore. An outside actor is governing your thought, not yourself being guided. Maybe? Just my initial thoughts about it.  I dunno about you, but I have never been able to be ""hypnotized"" and don't really understand how it works.

Meditation,3cb3an,Solieus,2,Mon Jul 6 16:10:20 2015 UTC,"Hypnosis isn't a lack of self-awareness. Stage hypnosis and clinical hypnosis may both be heightened suggestibility, but they are not at all the same end result.   Most clinical hypnotists define hypnosis as selective focus paired with non-judgment. That's pretty much the way many would describe meditation, isn't it?  Putting stage hypnosis aside, clinical hypnosis typically doesn't put the conscious mind to sleep. That's a rare occurrence and it's why you think you can't be hypnotized. If you're capable of learning new behaviors and unlearning old ones, you can be hypnotized.   We tend to think of hypnosis as someone controlling us and that's why we have this aversion to thinking we can be hypnotized. But really, hypnosis is more like a heavily guided meditation. The results of vastly different, but the mechanisms are similar."

Meditation,3cb3an,Solieus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:31:33 2015 UTC,"Primarily because that's what they believe happens under hypnosis. There is absolutely nothing in the act of hypnosis itself that has people forget their experience.   First off, forgetting is rare. It just does not happen very often. It may happen for traumatic experiences, where forgetting is a protection mechanism. In any other instance, it's really because your beliefs about the experience shape the experience. If you believe you won't remember, you're more likely to not remember. Even still, this is a rare occurrence.   And the only time it happens where a hypnotist suggests forgetting is when it's on stage. A different beast altogether."

Meditation,3cc9ti,landoncain,2,Mon Jul 6 20:05:51 2015 UTC,"This sounds like something very common, a panic attack.  As you say, you became afraid of your feelings.  The mechanism is like feedback of an audio signal - the loud noise when a mic is too near a speaker.  It starts with being nervous about being nervous and leads, very suddenly, to a high level of anxiety.  The word ""panic"" says it - a sense that you want to run away, but running away won't help, because you know it's in your mind.  This can be very disturbing for people who haven't experienced it.  It comes out of the blue, without warning.  There's no defense against it.  But the key is to not defend yourself.  The attack has no power except the power you give it.  Trying to escape from it is saying it's terrible.  Trying to make yourself calm is like hiding in the bathroom - trying to escape.  A well-known psychiatrist and self-help author, David Burns, says do the opposite of what seems right.  Instead of trying to calm down, try to make yourself afraid.  Instead of saying ""Please don't hurt me,"" it's best to say, ""Do your worst!""   Panic disorder is just a phobia - fear of something harmless. When people come to see the attacks themselves as nuisances, like the dizzy feeling you get from a roller coaster, the attacks become less intense and less frequent, or they just go away.  If you're afraid of doing something silly in public - do just that.  Burns' book The Feeling Good Handbook has advice on panic and other problems.  You can see how popular it is at the Amazon ad -and the price of a used copy - dirt cheap.  Fear for sale - people pay money for roller coaster rides, horror movies, and yes LSD.

Meditation,3cbbr4,Solieus,2,Mon Jul 6 16:04:45 2015 UTC,"When this used to happen, I kept a notepad with me to write stuff down. Many of us get into meditation because we're stressed and anxious, and the stress and anxiety can often be a symptom of poor time management, poor task management and so on.  So when you stop to take a breather, you may find that tasks and commitments pop into consciousness. I write them down, and put the notepad away. If another task comes along, I write it down, put it away. I continue sitting.  I too dislike my impatience, my forgetfulness, tardiness, etc. Meditation is soothing, but not nearly as soothing as subsequently taking action to make sure that I am prepared, that I complete my work, that I fulfill my obligations. The two work together in tandem. Inhale, exhale. Reflect, Act."
Meditation,3cbbr4,NO_LAH_WHERE_GOT,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:52:46 2015 UTC,"If you are meditating you should have an easier time recalling these ideas afterwards without any thing else stimulating your memory. So give that a try. If it doesn't work then try writing things down and your method sounds good too.   Sometimes I just get up and go do the thing and keep a mindful attitude during that activity. Then when I am done I resume sitting. If you are doing some activity the sensations in regards to that activity are arising in the present moment; that is your ""right now"". Meditation doesn't have to be done while sitting."

Meditation,3ca8nj,elzilcho13,3,Mon Jul 6 09:12:18 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're doing it right to me. I'm still relatively new to meditation (about three years developing my practice), but I've had moments of feeling a little down in mood.  For me, I came to the conclusion that I was so accustomed to swings in emotion and feeling - peaks and valleys. Meditation made me more aware of my desire for such peaks and everything kind of evened out. It wasn't that I was feeling down, but that I wasn't getting the emotional swings that I normally experienced.  I've also had periods where my meditation felt like it wasn't ""working"". Related to my down mood above, since I was so new to meditation, what I noticed initially was so different to my normal experience that it was easy to notice. As my practice progressed (and progresses), what there is to notice is much more subtle (seemingly). I finally reached a point where I decided that my meditation wasn't going to work. I decided to sit and see what ""not working"" was like.   Those are my two cents, but it does sound like you're ""doing it right"". Beginner's mind and patience (I tell this to myself over and over)."

When you first start with a technique it is new it requires your full attention but once you become familiar with it your mind starts wandering.   I've heard about bliss during meditation and, again, I feel like I may have experiences this more often at the beginning, although still today I will occasionally have moments of bliss or clarity.   If you want bliss, try this:  https://sites.google.com/site/chs4o8pt/meditation-1#meditation_serenity  It causes the brain to release serotonin, endorphins, and dopamine.   each meditation does tend to be quite different and I never know what to expect   You can learn to recognize what is going on with your mind how that will effect meditation, and knowing that can help make your meditation experiences more consistent.  http://ncu9nc.blogspot.com/2015/02/why-is-it-so-hard-to-concentrate.html"

Meditation,3c99e3,ChiefWilliam,8,Mon Jul 6 02:15:11 2015 UTC,"Mindfulness of breathing:   Focus on the breath.   A. Pick either a physical sensations (e.g: the rise and fall of the abdomen, the breath passing through the nose, the breath passing the tip of the nose, etc... ), a mental concept (""in"" and ""out"", or a point in space that the breath passes, or the process of the rising and falling of the abdomen, etc... ) or both. The mind will begin to wander. When you notice it has (a moment of mindfulness) return focus to the breath. Rinse and repeat.   You can use any sensation to focus on since sensations arise in the present moment. Some sensation that relates to the breath is easy because the breath will exist as long as you exist. There are also 39 other objects of meditation in buddhism.  Focusing on nothingness would be an arupa jhana. You probably want to have either momentary concentration, access concentration or jhana before trying to develop arupa jhanas. I think, technically, arupa jhanas take 4th jhana (equanimity) as a basis.  I can't really say anything about ""aum,"" krishna or introspection (self inquiry?) because I don't use them."
Meditation,3c99e3,Gojeezy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:36:09 2015 UTC,"I have a question:  When I first dabbled in meditation about 6 years ago, I'd read and heard very little about meditation, so my techniques were not necessarily of ""the book."" Instead of focusing on a physical sensation of breathing, I would generally mentally visualize various things--oftentimes my breath, but not always. Sometimes I would just focus on visuals arising in my mind, like an individual sitting in lotus position floating through various mindscapes. These would often ""work"" in the sense that I would not be attached to my ego, and I would view things calmly and objectively.  Since those early days, everything that I've read seems to indicate that I may have been ""wrong"" in some way, so I've tried to transition to focusing on more physical sensations of breath without any success whatsoever. I've never been a habitual meditator, but it seems that visualization seems to work much better for me than focusing on physical sensations.  My questions are: 1) Are there any drawbacks or risks to this method? 2) Is there a specific type of meditation that teaches this?  Thanks!"
Meditation,3c99e3,CirclingLife,2,Mon Jul 6 07:55:46 2015 UTC,"I believe that in the vissudhimagga (therevada buddhist commentary) and abidhamma (therevada canon- might still be considered a commentary) they teach jhana using visualizations and conceptualizations.  First you focus on an object (parikamma nimitta) so much that it becomes, in a sense, etched into your mind (uggaha nimitta). Then you focus on the mental image (uggaha nimitta). Then after focusing on the mental image long enough it transforms into a conceptualization (patibhaga nimitta) and becomes perfect.  In the visualized image faults appear, e.g., if your preliminary object (parikamma nimitta) is a disk made out of clay there will be cracks and obvious imperfections in the disk along with color and form (basically individual characteristics). In the conceptualized image all faults vanish. The patibhaga nimitta possesses neither color or form and it is born of perception. More or less it is like a bright light. I believe it would be reasonable to describe it as a gateway to pure consciousness.  I am not sure how well this translates to your technique. If you have a visualization that you could steadily focus on without changing it or losing it then I believe over time it would turn into the patibhaga nimitta. The different mindscapes as you describe it might pose somewhat of a problem for this though.  Aside from that I don't believe there is any problem with it. EDIT: Some of the objects of buddhist meditation are considered recollections; so they would be similar to your technique. I suppose it comes down to what your goals are. Stress relief, tranquility (jhana), enlightenment, etc. . . .I don't have any experience with visualizations in the way you describe though so I can't really say for sure."

Meditation,3c99e3,syntaxvorlon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:20:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think you 'should' do anything- I know it is popular at the moment to focus on the breath, but I find I get better results by giving my mind more of a 'job', so to speak. I like practicing yoga nidra, a body scan technique, because I am able to quiet the thoughts that cross my mind during normal consciousness that are sometimes too loud, whereas I often lose focus by just focussing on my breath by itself. If body scanning doesn't suit you, you could also try yogic breathing techniques (I don't know the names but eg. alternate nostril breathing, in-cool, out-warm sensation focus.. There are heaps). I think it comes down to what feels best for you personally. Just try some and see what you think! Good luck"

Meditation,3c9tff,PM_me_a_dirty_haiku,9,Mon Jul 6 05:40:39 2015 UTC,"If you're following that method, you should follow it precisely. Every tradition evolves with its own completion, and every method has its own sense, its own context in that tradition. The very reason that you do not know (after all, you're here asking about it) is why you are not in a position to change the method to suit your sense of things. Whether it's arbitrary or whether it's based on a consensus of sundry opinions among anonymous voices on the internet, the change would be based on ignorance.  Yes, it's important to follow the method exactly. If you don't have enough faith in the method to follow it without question, then you need to learn it better. If learning from a book is not good enough (and it may not be), then find a living teacher who can respond to your doubts.  Breath is intimately connected to physicality, thought, and mood. It affects and is affected by all three. This is one of the reasons it is such an effective object of meditation; but it is also a reason why breath-based practice can go off the rails so easily. Because the breath is so influential, you must be meticulous in following the guidance of experienced, awakened teachers within a tradition of proven results.  The in-breath gathers; the out-breath dissipates; the turning of the breath is open. If these are out of balance, some aspect of self becomes skewed. Gulping in breaths more deeply than would happen naturally tends to express and evoke an acquisitive mindset. One may gain a sense of vitality, but it comes at the cost of detachment: duality is subtly implied with each breath: ""I"" get more power. That is not real power; it is ego-based illusion.  Forcing the breath in some way has always been an attractive proposition, and many meditators and even meditation teachers don't realize why this is so; they only follow their sense of it. The attraction (or, really, attachment) arises as a psychological shadow. It is the unconscious avoidance of openness. To put it succinctly, one fears the silence and tries to fill it in with activity. One fears the vulnerability and tries to cover it with controlling actions.  When the breath is very natural and uncontrived, it becomes seamless, gentle, effortless. The feeling of it becomes more and more subtle. The gross formations of self begin to settle as the mind moves more deeply into absorption of pure awareness. But our attachment to these formations — our attachment to what we think of as our self — is very deep and strong. When we begin to lose the grip on the formations, a rebellion appears in the mind. The ego seeks ways to maintain control, to feel itself. So it makes more formations; it stirs something up to comfort itself. It is how masturbation becomes addiction. Or, more related to breath, it is why smoking becomes such an attachment, beyond the chemical dependency: one feels one's existence through the breath. Like sucking on a pacifier, one feels ""okay, I exist, I am here"".  So when the breathing becomes more frictionless and silent, notice the discomfort, the anxiety that arises. Notice the urge to fill in the silence, to create feeling that re-establishes a sense of your existence. It keys on the gross sensation of accumulating power through the breath, and it keys on the manipulative relationship to the breath and to the method itself, as your attention turns to 'tweaking' the process rather than surrendering to it.  The Third Patriarch of Zen said that human beings' shared sickness is our anxiety about emptiness. This is what prompts us to manipulate the breath, manipulate the mood, make more thoughts, stay busy with activity, and so on.  Some traditional methods do force the breath, for various reasons. The innate imbalance may be used to circulate or build energy or to control the mind in some way. It is not an inherently pure way of practicing, but it can be used positively. It relies heavily, though, on a very clear and strong motivation and/or a structure that keeps the practitioner on the correct path. This structure may include close and continual guidance from a teacher, practice in a group setting, rules of conduct, and lifestyle commitments or vows.  But that is not the kind of practice taught in Mindfulness In Plain English. If you choose to follow the practice in the book, follow it and don't place yourself above the teacher (by questioning or tweaking the method). Don't let ego get between you and the liberative instruction. You will only understand the meaning of the practice when you fully attain its fruit, after a great deal of diligent effort."

There are many different methods all over the internet, but perhaps the most basic is to sit comfortably somewhere you won't be disturbed. It's important that your phone's off and your computer is put to sleep.  You sit there, sitting upright with your spin straight. It helps if you're sitting on the floor with a pillow or something under your butt.  You place the back of your right hand into your left hand and let your thumbs touch. Eyes closed or half-closed.  You then bring your attention to your breath and take a couple nice, easy breaths. Then, after a while, left your breath rise and fall automatically while you gently observe it.  Do this, keeping your attention on your breath. Do this for a couple minutes and you'll feel much better.  You'll certainly be distracted by your thoughts, but whenever you remember, just bring your attention back to your breath.  Good luck!"

That's inconsistent. Either there is the color blue and there are wavelengths of 400nm, or there exists no blue and there are no waves either.  What is a wave? In this context it's a mathematical description, represented by certain neurons in your brain firing up in this situation. It's no more and no less real than the color blue.  if we want to desperately want to argue, I would even say it's a layer more abstract and less real, but who cares?  400? That's a number. An idea represented by a different set of neurons.  ""nm""? An idea that has things to do with the concepts of length and measurement. When nobody understands what a measurement even is, does ""length"" have meaning?  This 400nm of wavelength sit upon a big throne of rather advanced and abstract concepts which you need for that to mean anything. For the color blue? That just needs an eye and a brain.   The neural network of the brain takes this wavelength and creates a false representation of the sensation of ""blue"".   One can describe this the other way just as well: When we learn about colors, a neural network in the brain takes the color blue and from that it creates the abstract concept of a wavelength...   The brain is creating a model of reality that is then perceived.   I am not sure about that. Recently I like a different model better: The brain is not merely creating a model of reality. The brain creates all of reality.   We have no access to anything outside what this brain of ours creates. So why even distinguish between ""model"" and ""reality"" then? If the same thing is true for everything that appears within perception, then the terms ""model"" and ""reality"" are totally equal."
Meditation,3c9hsn,curtdbz,3,Mon Jul 6 03:35:29 2015 UTC,"i think you can focus it on anything that is extremely readily available. give it a try. a heartbeat to me is not quite as intricate as a breath of air, and would be harder for me personally."
Meditation,3c9hsn,PM_me_a_dirty_haiku,2,Mon Jul 6 05:50:33 2015 UTC,"The traditional methods have been passed down through a lineage of awakened masters, people who have completely transformed their lives through the practice, who have gained the complete attainment of the practice. The methods have been refined over many generations, among thousands or millions of practitioners. If you put yourself on the same level and imagine that you can invent your own practice based on your own whim, it will be whim guiding you, not awakening.  It is like they say: the doctor who treats himself has a fool for a patient.  As to the validity of heartbeat as an object of mindfulness, sure, there's no great problem with that or any of a thousand different objects. Why do you choose hearbeat? What do you think is more special or effective? One problem with the heartbeat as an object, compared to the breath, is that for you to perceive it, it has to be quite a gross sensation (i.e., not subtle). The breath can be perceived at very subtle levels; and then the focus moves to the awareness itself. But when the heartbeat becomes more subtle you may not perceive it well, and so it loses its value as an object."

I'd venture that much of the profound feeling of the heart meditation comes from bringing the mind and energy to the heart center, or what some masters call the seat of the soul (located almost in the mirror image of the heart, slightly to the right of center). The physical beating is still a gross sensation.  There are many types of heart meditation, some less well known as you say. As an object of concentration, my sense is that the actual physical beating doesn't appear as well as the breath in terms of fine, subtle perception. I could be wrong.

Meditation,3c9hsn,asatar,2,Wed Jul 15 15:34:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Tracking the emotions (in this case, through the heartbeat) can be very helpful indeed. Emotions tend to control us far more than we realize; and taking the witness position can give us a much-needed awareness and equanimity.  The pitfall in this and other heart-based or devotional practices is that one may attach to form. This is a pitfall in all paths; the way it manifests in heart-centered practice is attachment to feeling. If one enters the practice with the prejudice or assumption that a certain feeling — or feeling in general — is 'good', superior, or ideal, one regenerates attachment to feeling throughout the practice.  This is not to say that heart-centered practice is any worse than other practices. It, too, can lead to liberation. It just has its own flavor and its own set of traps. Attachment to feeling is a particularly insidious one. Good teaching on correct motivation and approach is perhaps the best aid to avoiding this sticky trap: when you know, going in, that feeling is itself empty, you can use the practice to gain freedom from attachment to feeling rather than go deeper into the attachment."

But thanks for poking back in the very first sentence, that makes the intent very clear.  Necessary things first and it was necessary to point out that I attacked you. Do you need help or can your ego cope with it? It's like your first post. At the beginning the lecturing to put him into his place and in the last sentence the answer to the initial question. It's almost as if you realized that you have to bring up an answer otherwise it would look stupid :D  Since I don't think that you realize what you are doing I felt the need to point it out, you can take this as an attack on yourself or a learning opportunity. Sometimes when we can't see it ourselves it's great to get slapped from the outside.   Where do you see condemnation?   Where do you see it ? Did I talk about it ?  You seem to know a lot but your ego shines through even in flowery phrases like this which are merely an excuse and a hiding place for your ego:   I'm voicing my opinion as an imperfect but experienced fellow practitioner.   It seems humble but actually isn't, because you didn't have to say that you're experienced but you chose to, to make it clear for everyone that you know what you're talking about. It's like saying ""Oh look at me."" :)  Or here:   You and OP are free to question away.   So what and why do you think you're so great and better than the OP and myself that you're able to answer every question we possibly could have. Well not every but ... Do you have any idea how much like an asshole I would feel if I would be so audacious(is this the right word?) to offer my wisdom for others to question me? Seriously who the fuck do you think you are ?  How bloated is your ego ?  Do you really think I want advice from a person who gets derailed and goes on a rant from a simple yes or no question? Why would I do that ? You should come down from your high horse and in my opinion with all your theoretical knowledge you have to learn when to give advice and when to stfu.  Like I said. It was a yes or no question and...    Yes, but when the heartbeat becomes more subtle you may not perceive it well, and so it loses its value as an object.   ... basically would be enough to answer it. There was no need for lectures or history lessons. Simple question, basic answer and the guy before you had it covered already so why would or should I ...   want to offer another side of it  It's easy to cut down, not so easy to support; easy to point the finger,    Yes it's very easy to lecture other people you clearly are experienced in it.   not so easy to bring awareness to the cause and effect of things.   Well, I'm trying to bring awareness to you and in this case you can see my reply as the result of your actions. You may find it offensive but in reality I'm what you sowed. Cause and effect. Isn't this great?   Experienced students and teachers know very well that there will be a backlash against mention of discipline, but that doesn't overturn the fact that freedom is not possible without discipline.   Come on this is an excuse. Nobody asked for your lectures or discipline. It also has nothing to do with discipline or the initial question itself that you're going on a rant about traditional methods. Nobody asked you for this.  Why do you think you know better what's good or necessary for other people? Let him go his way, who are you to decide?"

Meditation,3c99u8,sungmny,4,Mon Jul 6 02:19:15 2015 UTC,"Mindfulness. Being aware. Watching, listening to your breath, body, mind and surroundings. Being everywhere, and nowhere. Being in peace, ease,  balance and comfort with oneself and others. You can generally do this in most settings, its useful in stressful environments. Just the mindset of being aware, aware of what's being said, what you're saying, why you're saying it, and so on. And ultimately acceptance of the situation. But people tend to lack awareness, and that's all easier said than done."

You're not doing those things to achieve a particular goal, as if there will be some time in the future when you will have a dazzling pearly white smile that will win the day. You will find yourself in a state of good health, recuperate from wear and tear, and be physically ready for the future as it emerges.  So mentally, psychologically, or spiritually, meditation not only affects how you handle things that have already passed, it sets up the conditions that allow you to respond to and navigate the world as new challenges arise. Recuperation and emotional resilience."

To become more peaceful and do better when negative states come along.   To gain deep ability to focus and apply attention.      To experience deep meditative states of mind.      To experience life more fully.     To unlock creativity and perspective.     To unravel your nuerosis.      And I'm sure there's more. And you know what, it works for all of this. You have to ask yourself why you are meditating. Although, if you don't know yet, thats fine too."

But for me at least I find that when I meditate regularly, the whole world seems that much more intense and enjoyable.   It's subtle and I didn't really notice until I went on a long retreat, but everyday we try to see everything but by doing so never really pick up anything. Through meditation I see more of each little thing, but still seem to take in the whole as well.   It's kind of like you become the person in a movie who walks through a scene of utter chaos with a smile on your face, because the chaos isn't there for you so much."

Meditation,3c99u8,daverupa,0,Mon Jul 6 23:39:00 2015 UTC,"The goal of meditation is enlightenment aka full kundalini awakening. When kundalini is sparked by being of light from the heaven, it feels like a lightning running trough the spine and head to the crown chakra area above head. Lightning causes 7 chakra explosions for example in heart and mind. Chakras are energy, activated to be burning on a very high frequency. Heart chakra feels the eternal flame of love. Mind turns from human brain to blown supermind. This kills the ego permanently. Soul receives biological immortality, entrance to the heaven, ability to fly, soulmate in heaven, amazing creativity, ability to read music notes in color, perfect detoxification of the body and burning crown which resembles the sun. The soul becomes saint and receives halo around the head. The term psychonaut comes actually from the light body's ability to fly to outer space and beyond the galaxies to the higher dimensions of the universe, where the space and time don't exist. Soul is crowned the king or the queen of the universe.   Reaching enlightenment is a very hard task that takes years of dedication and intensive psychonautical training. Meditation combined with the music is the main psychonautical tool for reaching this. It requires fully silent mind. Also psychedelics like LSD and magic mushrooms can even work like keys to the kundalini and the light if used this way."

Meditation,3c7vsl,lost_lurker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:28:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say there is such a thing as a 'bad session'. There were times when it was difficult to get up in the morning and hit the cushion. When I was younger if it went on for a while I'd get frustrated and quit for a while. Then I'd start again. Then I'd quit if something more interesting than my cushion was happening (like a new love). This went on for about 25 years. I finally settled into a solid practice about 13 years ago. Now I practice morning and evening for a total of 2.5 hours a day. Meditation is like life (it is, after all an activity embedded in life), it has its ups and downs. I suspect that people who take meditation seriously find something similar happening over time."

But with Headspace he tells you exactly what the purpose of meditation is, has cute little video clips that explain it, etc etc. So I never felt like ""what am I doing, am I doing this right?"" - which is how I would've probably felt if I just started trying to meditate on my own.

Had anyone bothered to look at it, its effects could be as well researched as the effects of physical training by now.  Running is a good example you bring up: It's popular because it is well studied. We know how to train well without doing harm. We know how much training is enough and how to train efficiently. We know that, because running as a discipline has been a topic of research since the beginning of sports science (so around 60 to 70 years, I guess).  Mediation was also around during all that time. It just wasn't researched until the 2000s, because... well, I don't know.  I am sure someone will get mad when I suggest that it was mainly because scientists preferred research that didn't endanger one's career. And that meditation research endangered scientists' careers because science as a whole is very open to discouraging promising research in fields that are not popular among the scientific establishment at the time.

Meditation,3caasc,dtxvsk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:03:09 2015 UTC,"The idea behind meditation is that you're waking up to your larger reality. You enter into meditation under the assumption that you're in a hypnosis of sorts that you're simply not conscious of, and when you meditate, you wake up and see it for what it is, with a grander perspective.  Now, with this said, the way to expand in your awareness is to draw your attention toward nothingness, emptiness, stillness... silence.  When, in your meditation, you contemplate silence, you align yourself with silence and recognize your existence outside of content.  Does this make sense? I don't mean to get overly technical.  Speaking metaphorically, the purpose of meditation is to become aware of the stage that's home to all the plays. To be aware of the sky that makes space for clouds. When you do this with your attention, it allows you to grow. Your awareness expands.  In this way, it's better to meditate without music. Because when there's music, it gives you something to focus on - more content. It keeps you ""entertained"" the same way a TV or Reddit would. You're just switching one point of focus for another.  But when you meditate in silence... it would be very difficult because there's nothing to focus on, and the conscious mind gets bored quickly. When this happens, it will try to get you to get up and do something else.  The aspect of you that feels uncomfortable meditating in silence is the aspect that feels threatened by it.  With this said, it's not like you're making ""negative progress"" with by meditating to music. There are still many benefits. But I think you'll find it more rewarding if you keep it quiet and find comfort in the quiet.  Hope this helps."

Meditation,3c9dk8,6ames,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:55:01 2015 UTC,"First, I am not a Doctor. I hope you are already working with a medical professional.  There are a large variety of meditation styles. Some include forms of cocentration meditation that can be used as escapism. That sounds something like what you are doing.  The problem is that it can be something like playing video games or eating cake to avoid dealing with the root issues of some agitated or depressive thought pattern. That is, a distraction from dealing with the issues. Albeit, a powerful distraction that it sounds like you have refined over time.  My advice is that you add something like vipassana to this concentration practice you have. When you feel comfortable enough to think about facing the anxiety head on then use vipassana or other awareness techniques to face and observe the root anxieties and depressive thoughts.  in this way you can start training your brain to face the root issues and be equanimous rather than reacting in the current way.  This should all be done under the guidance of a professional if you are truly experiencing psychotic episodes."

This is why we're able to do things like walk and operate machines and juggle and execute complex motions in general. The body knows where it is with relationship to its image of the world.  The world around you is itself a fiction that your brain develops based on your memories and thoroughly scanning the surroundings at all times. Things like the perception of the color of objects around you are based on your mind cataloging them and remembering them.  Test pilots in high-g planes and centrifuges have indicated that this happens under prolonged high acceleration sometimes, probably due to the shifted distribution of blood in the brain (but I digress)."

Meditation,3c8enq,NicCage182,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:32:43 2015 UTC,Do some breathing exercises right before meditation like breathing in from your left nostril while blocking the right one and then exhaling. Do the same with right nostril while blocking the left nostril. Do this about 10 times and breathing will become a lot easier and mind will also calm down a bit.
Meditation,3c8enq,Painismyfriend,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:34:26 2015 UTC,"You can do some yogic breathing exercises (pranayama) for 2-3 minutes before mediation. It helps a lot.  This is one of the several techniques of Pranayama (Yogic Breathing).   Close your right nostril with your right thumb, and breath in through the left nostril, counting 4 Then close your left nostril with your right index finger, open the right nostril, and breath out counting 8   You can go for 3-6, or 5-10, 6-12, etc. The important thing is that the exhalation be twice the length of the inhalation.  Breathing should be soft, even, and as soundless as possible. Do not force yourself, it should be comfortable. So adjust your count according to your capacity.   In the beginning it may be a bit hard to get the exhalation twice as long as inhalation, but by time and patience we get there.  You can practice this for 5~15min. It is very relaxing. After that you can just breath normally, and follow with your meditation practice of focusing the attention on the breath, on a mantra, or on the space between the eyebrows."

Meditation,3c6zal,duncancarroll,3,Sun Jul 5 19:00:08 2015 UTC,"There's a persistent notion that morning is the ""best"" time to meditate, and that other times are not as good (for reasons never well-explained.)  I've found this to be 100% without basis.  Whenever I've tried to sit in the AM, I just fall asleep.  Tried 10-15 times with no luck.  Why sit at all if you're going to be drowsy / asleep?  So I began sitting in the early evening, when I get home from work, at 6ish, just before dinner.  It's perfect; although usually I have to have a light snack or some juice in the afternoon just so that my stomach isn't growling from hunger.  I've done it for years, hundreds of sits, and it works far, far better than the morning in my opinion.  tl;dr any time before a meal is typically good.  After a meal can be distracting due to digestion."
Meditation,3c6zal,WxOnWxOff,2,Sun Jul 5 19:29:34 2015 UTC,"Something that really helped me when I first started meditating is that there doesn't necessarily have to be a specific time or place where you meditate. Like you, I also go to school and find it hard to wake up early just to meditate so what I began doing was meditating whenever I had the time.   In the mornings on the way to school and even in class, I often focus on my breath/breathe deeply and it helps get me focused for the day. I fully meditate (eyes closed, in half-lotus) in-between doing my assignments or before bed when I begin to ""gear-down"" for the day.   Something that really helped with accomplishing my school work was taking regular breaks every 1-2 hours to focus on my breath for just 10 minutes. I will often get frustrated or impatient with my studies, and meditating really helps me ease out of those feelings and focus on the tasks at hand. Sometimes I will feel stressed and think that I don't have the time to do so, but stopping what I'm getting worked up over and meditating instead always made me feel much better about myself and the situation .  I'm beginning to learn that meditation is a constant practice. There was something I read in this subreddit where this man in a village was interviewed about meditation and he said: Meditation isn't just about sitting still with your eyes closed. You still have to cook and fetch the water as well. Look for opportunities to simply enjoy your present moment and breathe deeply. You may be surprised how uplifting and effective it really is!"
Meditation,3c6zal,WxOnWxOff,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:10:39 2015 UTC,"Great Response. I know that meditation doesn't need to be time specific but the main reason I asked this is because whenever I try to sit and meditate at mid day, I doze off to sleep, which is not what we want. Do you drink some coffee or tea beforehand or you don't need it?"
Meditation,3c6zal,hotsnakesnbubblegut,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:22:28 2015 UTC,"If I'm feeling sleepy or tired at the time, I usually go and hit the weights or go for a run, take a cold shower, then meditate afterwards . It's a good way to wake your body up and feel invigorated, and it makes me feel even more peaceful when meditating.   When I used to do P90x, there was a yoga component that made your body sweat and ache, followed by a session where you sit, close your eyes, and say some ohms. After doing this, I always felt this sort of ""completeness"" with the workout because it changed my mindset from an intense (and sometimes raging) ""keep pushing yourself, you can do a couple more"" mentality to more of a calming, serene mentality. This helps when I know I need to focus on studying, reading or practicing piano afterwards.   As for the coffee and tea. I generally only consume coffee when I really need the caffeine, otherwise I feel a little queasy and my hands shake. On the other hand, I drink tea throughout the day. It helps when I meditate because I attribute the act of drinking tea with being relaxed and calm. Though the kinds I consume don't contain caffeine, it does help me get into the mindset!"

That's just how it rolls, unfortunately.   You should try to be more mindful of the thoughts. Not in the way where you're analyzing every single thought that pops into your head, but understanding that your thoughts are like clouds.   Imagine you're looking up at the sky and you see a cloud roll in and it blocks the sun. You notice that the sun is no longer shining, but it's just a cloud and you can't do anything about it. The cloud then moves along and you can see the sun again.   Thoughts are clouds. They roll in. They roll out. Pay no attention to them. Thoughts aren't intentions or actions. They're nothing and they mean nothing.   If you find yourself on a long train of different thoughts then you're already off the train. Just bring it back to your breath."

Meditation,3c6hbh,ifeelsillyy,31,Sun Jul 5 08:02:16 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, meditation isn't about ""not thinking"". (This is going to be long, sorry...)  Typically, meditation is used to practice awareness, concentration/focus, or both.  Meditators often describe the ""normal"" (for people who don't meditate) state as the ""monkey mind"": the mind produces thoughts that typically repeat, either rapidly or more generally over time. Many of these thoughts are ""harmless"" or even ""positive"", but sometimes they can be unpleasant, and people tend to have a lot of trouble chasing these unpleasant thoughts away.  The monkey mind doesn't respond well to trying to shut it up forcefully, but it does respond well to what we do in meditation (even if, for some people, it's really difficult to find a way to get started that works for them. You're evidently not one of these people, so hooray! :))  Most people are so used to this monkey mind thing that they find it hard how to imagine how to function without it. Well, first off, the goal isn't to get rid of all thoughts. It's to be more able to be aware of what's actually going on (rather than being focused on the stuff the monkey mind keeps coming up with), and to be more able to narrow down your mental focus whenever it serves you. Basically you aim to control where your mind goes, or where it doesn't go, rather than letting it happen by chance.  As you learn more about this, you'll probably begin to get an understanding, hard to put in words, that the absence of ""normal"" thinking isn't really the same as ""not thinking"". Instead, your mind starts doing a somewhat different kind of processing. Have you ever been really absorbed in some kind of activity and afterwards, noticed you achieved a lot more than you would have thought possible, and by the way where did all the time go? That's one example of a state of mind where you're very focused. It doesn't feel the same as normal thinking-in-a-circle, but it sure isn't ""thoughtless"", either. Awareness, meditation style, is almost an opposite of that, only the two have a lot of things in common, too.  Awareness isn't just about being more fully aware of what's going on, of what your senses are telling you, of what's going on in your mind. It's also, indirectly, a way of letting go of thoughts/feelings you used to be stuck with... because when you're Aware (ooh, capitalized... how special) instead of trying to analyze and judge your experience on an abstract level, these things begin to dissipate.  You probably don't want to get rid of everything you think/feel/believe, nor do you want to spend every waking moment experiencing things fully instead of analyzing them... but it's a great alternative to the monkey mind thing.  From your description it seems like you like to have things figured out, get a handle on what they're like, and so on. If you think about it, this is basically the opposite of awareness, in a way: you want plenty of reference experience so you know what to expect, so you can go, ""okay, I know this, I can deal with this.""  You've already noticed that you're beginning to rely less on that. That's because you're learning mental skills that allow you to take things as they are, to not get tripped up by unexpected things, to feel at ease in unfamiliar settings. Okay, so you're not quite there yet, but you're a beginner, so you've got plenty of time to get there.  For example, trying new hobbies. You've probably heard the saying ""the perfect is the enemy of the good""... same thing applies here. If you're going to try something, it doesn't matter whether there's something ""better"". Take it as it is (don't worry, this will get easier sooner than you might think) for some time. Unless there's something you really dislike about it, of course. Then, after a while, you can still decide whether you want to try something else, too.  Is there a ""better"" hobby? I'm gonna tell you a secret: nobody knows. All of us have to deal with imperfect knowledge. :) The only way of dealing with not knowing is to accept not knowing, and then, if you want to, do things to reduce the extent of your ignorance, step by step. Personally, I don't really have a ton of hobbies, but I'm fine with what I've got, and am not actively looking for new things, even though it's pretty much guaranteed that there's something completely awesome I haven't found yet.  Anyway. Will it continue to get easier? Yes! Can you help it along? Yes! The best way to help it along is to practice not judging things. This is easiest at first on irrelevant things. For example, if you're walking through a forest, look at the things around you... really look. People tend to mask out the scenery because it matches their expectations. They go, ""yeah, forest, basically"", and they don't even bother putting it into words.  What's the alternative? Well, you could go and subdivide it into trees, branches, leaves... but that's just more of the same. The goal is to see what's there, not to make it abstract.  This can be difficult at first, which is why a lot of people talk about meditation practice in terms of focusing on the breath, where you focus on a very specific detail to avoid accidentally getting on the abstract level. Personally when I discovered that the ""just look at stuff"" is an option for practicing awareness, that was a breakthrough for me, because I found it was much easier for me than focusing on my breath... and as I got a handle on how to do ""raw experience"", observing my breath became easier, too.  The idea of ""raw experience"" in general seems to me to be connected to meditation-style awareness. Perpetual raw experience isn't necessarily the goal, though... it's an antagonist to the monkey mind and in time it will be easy to quieten aimless thinking and let the rest of your mind do its thing."

I have such a hard time making major life decisions because I am afraid there will be something better that I could have chosen. Accepting that I will never have perfect knowledge never dawned on me.   I can also relate when you say you've had most success with ""raw experience."" Aside of exercising awareness in your daily life, do you sit to meditate with a timer regularly? Do you just practice raw experience then or focus on your breath?"
Meditation,3c6hbh,casschips,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:23:29 2015 UTC,"No, I never sit down formally. My time management is a bit... unmanaged. ;) The most I deliberately practice is on my way to work or back (I don't drive, so there isn't really any serious risk of injury). I could probably be getting a lot more out of that, but most of the time I don't remember to actually do it. I do spend a lot less time with the monkey mind, but that's a baseline change and not deliberate practice of awareness and/or focus.  So how come I'm getting anything at all? Well, a few years back I had a couple of weeks with absolutely nothing to do, and I guess I practiced quite a bit then. Those skills are still with me today, since I've kept using them, even if I haven't spent a lot of time developing them any further.  By the way, these insights like about imperfect knowledge have done just as much for me as, if not more than, the simple practicing part. For instance, the day I began understanding how self-esteem and social anxiety are actually kind of nonsensical concepts triggered a huge change in my life. I was really insecure and withdrawn before that. I guess most people can't tell these days.  In many forms of meditation they talk about delusions. That means ways of thinking that seem completely reasonable and logical from your current perspective but which are actually not necessarily true, so there's a least some wiggle room you're not aware of... and buying into delusions can limit your freedom of choice, because you believe you have to do things you actually don't have to do, or because you believe you can't do things you actually can do. In time you'll find a whole bunch of these delusions in your own thinking (I know this because everyone has delusions), and each time life is going to get a little bit easier. Yay! :)"

I am a young adult getting acclimated with the idea that I can do whatever I want, while still feeding into the pressures of wanting to please others, etc. This push/pull leaves me questioning everything in an 'analysis paralysis' sort of way. I find mindfulness and meditation to be extremely helpful, but I seem to ""fall out of it"" and forget the things that I learn. A concept can totally resonate with me, but somehow I will slip away and start living in my mind again. That is why I asked if you practice. I'm wondering if that would help me to make it more of a constant in my life.   I realize this got pretty lengthy, so only respond to what you would like or nothing at all. If anything, I appreciate you giving me the chance to vent :)"
Meditation,3c6hbh,casschips,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's the ""social interactions"" package. :}  The big paradox in social stuff is that there's you, and the way you see yourself, and the way you actually act (sometimes different from each other). And then there's the way another person sees you. Each person sees you differently, filtered through their own history and beliefs and expectations and stereotypes. And not a single person on this planet will ever see ""the real you"". The real you is not observable.  With that in mind, think about what it minds trying to please other people.  It means you have to guess at what they expect... and it also means that it's completely impossible to always please everyone at once, because people have wildly opposing expectations and belief systems. It also means that, when it comes down to it, pleasing person X might not actually fit into your own value system. If there's a conflict between someone else's values and yours, and there's no viable compromise, your values win, by default. This is the way you need to do it if you don't want the whole world to walk over you, and there is simply no alternative. Within this set of parameters, you can still decide how much you favour your own wishes over someone else's, but there are clear boundaries and you should always honour those.  Once you realize that there will always be people who judge you poorly, even if you are practically a saint, it's not a huge leap to also realize that there will always be people who support what you do, who are on your side. Again, neither of these are seeing the real you... but paying more attention to the people who support you is a whole lot more enjoyable, and you can still consider the opposing side's view and ask yourself if there is any truth to it. If someone says you suck at resolving conflicts, there's a chance they're right, and if that matters to you, you can look into ways to handle conflicts differently. Getting emotionally caught up in whatever they said is basically optional; they're biased anyway. Take the sliver of insight and ignore the rest.  Big decisions: yeah, those are tricky. I can maybe say some more about this if you give an example. In general, if you've got a big decision to make and, after looking into it, all options have a comparable amount of advantages and disadvantages, then any choice you make is workable. You can roll a die if you like. (If you suddenly start feeling really bad about one of the choices while the die is in the air, there might be a good reason to not pick that choice.) For some decisions, it's actually more feasible to do a ""trial run"" than you think. Should you go to university? See if there's a free online programme you can look at. Should you get into the workforce? Maybe there's an internship somewhere that you could check out. Should you travel the world to ""find yourself""? Definitely not. You're already right where you are. No need to chase yourself. ;)  Will constant practice help? Yes. The important thing is to do it consistently... either at a specific time, or in a specific situation that happens fairly regularly. A commute is a great example of the second one. I recommend not planning longer sessions than you can handle, by the way. Sitting down for fifteen minutes and spending ten of those fruitlessly fighting a sense of unrest is much worse than sitting down for five minutes. When you're done with a session, draw a mental line, clearly mark out the end. This, too, adds an element of consistency and trains you to end the session when you mean to end it, not when you get distracted.  More questions? Feel free to ask. I might not always be around, though. :)"

Building the confidence to honour my values is something I am trying to work on. I have been feeling lonely and unhappy because I feel incompatible with my friends. They are so enveloped in partying (which no longer aligns with my values). Reading your response is very helpful to me.   As far as the major life decisions go- you've pretty much hit it on the head. I'm looking for a job in nonprofit work but am having a hard time pinpointing a focus because so many things sound like they would be great. Reading your response is revealing to me that I am not as ""stuck"" as I thought. Whatever I choose will be okay, and if it's not, I will act on that situation. As many of us do, I sometimes try to manipulate the future. Obviously this is futile and only leads to anxious thoughts for me. :)   Thank you again.

I don't have any super fancy advice for that, but the classic is to find people with common interests, via clubs, work places (warning: doesn't apply to all work places) or basically any kind of community that shares more than a demographical label. It can also be interesting to talk to complete strangers. There are plenty of opportunities for doing that that are perfectly socially acceptable. Often enough it will make for no more than some idle chit-chat or just a brief exchange of words, but who knows what might happen..."

My eyes are wide open, and I just let the world around me... sink in, for lack of a better word. Sometimes I may focus on my breathing or stuff like that, but I don't actually do that a lot... it's not nearly as compatible with being up and about than this more open-ended awareness is.  (Sometimes I do doze on the bus and fall asleep, but I always wake up before it gets to my stop. Power of the mind and all that.)"

Meditation,3c6hbh,ringer54673,2,Sun Jul 5 22:24:16 2015 UTC,"That's a bit strongly worded, actually. Meditation develops the skills needed to become aware of delusions. Whether you actually use them for that is a different question. In my experience there's an element of luck involved, too: it has to occur to you that something is a delusion. You can't really control that... only indirectly, by adopting a general mindset of being sceptical of limitations and obligations/requirements."

Meditation,3c6hbh,entist,2,Mon Jul 6 00:10:52 2015 UTC,Is there a specific type of meditation I should do to enhance this process?   This works for me: https://sites.google.com/site/chs4o8pt/meditation-1#meditation_serenity
Meditation,3c6hbh,RasSupreme,2,Sun Jul 5 11:40:27 2015 UTC,"If your way of thinking doesn't seem to be productive, it's only reasonable that you're looking for some way to change it. If your problem seems to derive from anxiety, sitting quietly and learning to relax in a nice way will help. If your tendency to overthink affects your meditation, that's to be expected, and you can't solve that by thinking even more.  If sitting quietly makes it hard for you to keep from overthinking, say by giving rise to memories and anxiety, that might just be the price you pay, but you might also want to practice some other method of relaxation that isn't as free-form and intense – like biking or drinking tea or walking in parks.  Physical exertion is a time-tested and straightforward way to lessen anxiety and rumination. It might make meditation seem less intimidating. If team sports make you anxious, you could focus on more solitary exercise for a while.  Another thing with trying to meet people socially while also tending to overthink and get anxious: cognitive stuff in your head affects how comfortable you will feel around people. Some people report success with therapy, but you can also learn by observing people who seem to be at ease. Is there anything different about the way they relate to others? As with so much else, it has to do with what you want. If you want people to like you, that might inhibit you from talking at ease. If you want people to be nice, that might be possible, but if they're not, such is life.  Anxiety is interesting. It doesn't make you a bad person or whatever. It's just a facet of the mind related to perceptions of danger. You may have poor self-esteem about stuff, but your negative thoughts are also shaped by your situation and habits, and if you change those, you might find self-esteem merely in the occasional absence of negative self-valuations.  ""Huh, I feel simply okay right now. Interesting... Maybe I tend to be overly negative about myself and my projects because of some negative experiences in the past that aren't as relevant as my anxious thoughts suggest..."""
Meditation,3c6hbh,Gojeezy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:15:30 2015 UTC,thank you. Yah I do have an anxiety disorder and I wonder if low self esteem is just as symptom of that.  And so is feeling uncertain about trying new things.
Meditation,3c6hbh,blackohat,2,Mon Jul 6 00:56:31 2015 UTC,"I know exactly how you feel. I over think everything, try to stop over thinking and then panic that maybe I should be thinking about said thing etc. I've been practising mindfulness and one of the improvements i've felt is with my concentration and attention. Now I have the capacity to say to myself when I get stuck in a thought, yes this thought might be valid or important but it's not helping me achieve the task i'm currently trying to do. Now that my concentration is better I can shift my attention to thing i'm actually doing and stay with it, tell myself that my other thoughts, while they may be important, can be thought about at a more appropriate time.    I've tried different types of mediation in the past but what appeals to me about mindfulness is their approach to the wandering mind. i.e. that the mind wanders, this is natural, this is okay. Just acknowledge your thought and then bring your attention back to breathing. The same thing each and every time your mind wanders during meditation. This part of the practice I definitely attribute to improved attention and concentration, I feel as though I have more power to choose what thoughts I entertain.    I struggled with the whole 'are you supposed to just 'do' things without examination' thought when I started meditating more seriously, now I can see it's not about 'not thinking' it's about having more control over when and what thoughts occur and how much you choose to entertain them at any given time.    just my two cents from personal experience, hope it helps."

Meditation,3c7foj,Tinuz1,3,Sun Jul 5 16:22:31 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a rather typical description of the unhappy meditation phases. Welcome to The Dark Night of the Soul, as they nowadays call it.  The Theravada people have done a really good job of describing the ups and downs one can encounter in the practice of insight meditation in several classical commentaries on meditation (the Visuddhimagga for example, if you would like to read something really old about meditation) . Here is modern version of one of those ""medtation maps"" from a book called Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha by Daniel Ingram.   What probably is most relevant for you is first of all a positive phase, which is described with The Arising and Passing Away here. Bliss, great postiure, great concentration, and many other happy things can happen. Only disadvantage: Doesn't last.  The next chapter is titled: Dissolution, Entrance to the Dark Night. So yes, after feeling really good for some time, it seems to be very common that uncomfortable stuff starts to happen. Dark emotions bubble up, and once one concentrates on them, they disappear rather rapidly (which can be the case for pretty much everything one concentrates on strongly; thus the name dissolution). Loads of physical pain and discomfort during meditation? Yes, also seems to be typical.  The next few chapters are titled Fear, Misery, and Disgust. Yes, all of that indeed is not pleasant.  So how does one deal with that? There are two aspects which I consider central.   One thing which makes all of that easier is compassion. Try to face yourself, your emotions, and the uncomfortable things you encounter while meditating in an understanding and open way.  The second aspect is equanimity: Whatever happens, it will happen. Whatever emotions bubble up, they will just happen. There is nothing you can do about it. Things will dissolve when you look at them, fear, misery, and disgust will happen, and meditation might feel like hell distilled into the form of a cushion. And once one can accept that this is just how it is right now, things get easier.  Then there might be a third aspect: Patience. It's going to take some time until all things that need bubbling up have bubbled up, and all the struggle against them has ceased.  The advantage? Once one is through those dark phases, one has learned to be okay with many more things. And that's a valuable skill."
Meditation,3c7foj,Wollff,3,Sun Jul 5 17:46:28 2015 UTC,"There few things you can do here for your emotions you can try vipasana meditation, where you just watch as your thoughts and feelings as they arrive. I dont know what type practice you follow but i follow the Hindu practices and whenever i have a good or bad emotions i offer them to my guru or the great masters and ask for help. For your physical pains you can try yoga and planks (http://www.psychetruth.net/fitness_workout_videos/workouts/yoga-for-balance-strength-core-abs-back-workout-10-minute-at-home-workout/) especially the third video it will destroy you but it will make your back strong. One simple meditation posture is, you can try laying your back. Also, ever since i started practicing the path, i noticed the little things i did were also important, such as diet, and sleep. After i started eating properly, eating at the right time and practicing yoga, my back pains went away. If you eat meat try not to eat too much. I ate fruits for just three days and everything started to change. And remember meditation is a journey. It's never smooth for me either, but everything your doing is preparing you for improvements. To clean a room you have throw out the garbage first."
Meditation,3c7foj,mindsculpt,3,Sun Jul 5 17:40:36 2015 UTC,"After working really hard on accepting these, I got to a place where I could just sit and be in the moment (took a month or so). I was suddenly capable of staying calm during work and simply accept mistakes, felt happy, and even slept well.   It's possible that meditation wasn't responsible for these changes. Perhaps this happened the other way around: you were calmer at work, felt happy, etc., and therefore you found it easier to sit and be in the moment.   Unfortunately, this lasted a whole 3 days... In the past two weeks since then, my back has been killing me, negative emotions are fewer but much more intense (and last longer), loads of physical pain during meditation, and I am often overcome with feelings of hopelessness/despair/sadness during the day that vanish as soon as I attempt to experience them (but are back once I start doing something else).   Meditation feels more pleasant (or even euphoric) when life is good, and people often believe their meditation practice is going well. Equally, when negative feelings arise during meditation, it feels hard and difficult, and people often believe their practice is going badly. The reality is that their practice isn't going well or badly in either instance. The difference is what is arising in their mind, and that people's minds generally freak out more when things they consider negative arise than when things they consider positive things arise.    The question: is this just a bunch of old emotions coming out?   It could be any number of things, but why this is happening isn't really important in terms of meditation. Ultimately, what you experience during meditation is somewhat irrelevant. What is important is how you relate to what you're experiencing.   Or am I perhaps doing something wrong by attempting to deal with the slew of emotions?   Outside of meditation, you may try to make changes to your life to improve your situation, but during meditation you shouldn't be attempting to deal with these negative emotions. If negative feelings are arising while you meditate at the moment, then that's what's happening. Don't judge what's happening or try to change what is happening. Find the peace that is independent of what is happening."
Meditation,3c7foj,TastyPruno,3,Sun Jul 5 18:50:32 2015 UTC,"You have all the knowledgeable answers here. My take on it is to try something more physical like yoga. A moving body has its own rules and does its own stuff. Do continue meditating as you see fit, but don't lock yourself into ""should"". I actually believe there is danger in sitting all alone with one's thoughts when they get out of hand. There is a difference between meditating all alone and having a master and a group. That is the danger of importing into a Western frame a practice that has been largely collective and normalized in totally different cultures. Not ok to say this here, but here you have it. Test yourself in different practices, find guidance if you are feeling worse."
Meditation,3c7foj,smokescreen1,2,Sun Jul 5 22:03:00 2015 UTC,"It could be either (or both), but this is not an uncommon experience at all.  It might be helpful to pair meditation with therapy as many prominent Western teachers have.  What is most important though is that you continue to try to greet these unpleasant feelings with as much friendliness and curiosity as you can."

You can talk about MBSR meditation (mindfulness based stress reduction) that is taught at a leading research hospital in an agnostic/scientific approach focused on healing, pain management, etc. Search this board/Google for Christian Meditation. There are a number of proponents who essentially fit the mindfulness meditation techniques into their Christian practice. YouTube has a ton of 'how to meditate' primers. Perhaps take a look through and find someone you think this woman might be receptive to watching (tone, gender, etc)? Within two minutes you are guaranteed to hear value-words like: peace, lovingkindness, empathy, releasing of anger which should resonate with her devout Catholicism. How about from a priest?!

No.  If they can't clear that up on their own, then this marriage thing might not be a good idea in the first place. They have to communicate with each other, and if it's about things which are important to them, they will have to reach a decision that is acceptable for both of them.  I also think it's a bit dishonest to try to explain meditation from a Christian viewpoint in this case. Does your uncle practice meditation in a Christian context, with an aim to experience unity or communication with God? No? Then please, let's not pretend that there is a Christian context for what your uncle is doing, when there is really none.  I can totally understand that meditation practice might be unacceptable for a faithful Catholic, especially when it's practice taken directly from Buddhism (which I assume is the context, since one of your uncles has shaved his head). After all it is practice which, in its original context, is made in order to prove the nonexistence of the immortal soul, practice made to disprove a centerpiece of Catholic dogma.  My advice is very simple: If your uncle wants to be respectful toward the faith of his future wife, he should stop meditation, or practice it in a context that is explicitly Christian and acceptable for her."
Meditation,3c5ywe,magicboy9,23,Sun Jul 5 03:34:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have an easier time speaking clearly and concisely now, as well as deciding whether something is worth talking about or mentioning.  A few months ago, I was awash in lots of stress/anxiety, and i was always more or less on-edge and distracted. I was very prone to overthinking things, and at some points, it was bad enough that my speech and train of thought could get needlessly nuanced and confusing. I would occasionally completely lose myself and those with whom I was talking by following convoluted strings of logic (or lack thereof), often about things that were unimportant or tangential to the main point.  Since I've started meditating, I've been less distracted and anxious; it's really done great things for my peace of mind. That's allowed me to be more clear, focused and aware of what I'm talking about.  I also try not to pride myself in using complicated words a lot, like I admittedly used to."

Downvote me if I am).  Between three and four years ago I woke up after a night of partying and had to take a monster pee so I got up and started to make my way to the bathroom. Along the way vertigo kicked in and I ended up hitting my head hard twice within a few seconds which concussed me and made me have a seizure.  After the seizure I had hospital stuff and junk.   Since then though, I've had a stutter. It annoys me more than anyone else because I wasn't born with it. Anyone I meet is very acceptable of it but I'm not. It's something that makes me mad.  Meditation helps me reduce my stutter to almost nothing. Two years ago I could barely get one sentence out without stumbling over at least one word. Then I started meditating again (I had been a meditation practitioner before for acrobatics/martial arts) and since I've started it back up my stutter has gotten progressively less intense.  tl;dr: Two years ago I could barely speak without stuttering. Now,with meditation and mindfulness, I only stutter a few times a day. I'm almost certain that the state of mind that meditating creates is responsible for my ability to communicate clearly through words.  If anyone has any questions I would be more than happy to answer them. PM's or reply's to this post, I'll try and answer them all."

I had fully formed thoughts in my head and I would try and speak them and sometimes I just couldn't get a word out. This was extremely frustrating for me as someone who loves to share my thoughts and theories and I especially love telling jokes. I learned early on though that getting frustrated made it worse and even harder for me to say what I wanted to say and that taking a deep breath and waiting a second before I continued speaking helped drastically, which was the spark that lit the now blazing fire that is my meditation habits."
Meditation,3c5ywe,Fungruel,3,Sun Jul 5 10:29:06 2015 UTC,"As I am often more conscious of the way I speak now it is easier to see the flaws and correct them. For example I used to beat myself down over not finding a specific word because I would be desperate to express something in a specific way. Instead of taking an easier way I beat myself down. I don't do this anymore, and another thing is I try not to babble and let the conversation be 50/50. Still working on this one.."

After the meetings, it would hit me that I didn't say what was on my mind for weeks.  I also speak with exactly the right tone and volume.  This all changed the month I started meditating.    I also used to repeat the things I said out loud in my head over and over in a very critical way. I called it echoes. Since I started meditating I feel very confident in my speaking."

Meditation,3c7rqs,f-a-p,2,Sun Jul 5 18:15:45 2015 UTC,"You can meditate anywhere when you realize that meditation doesn't have to be some silent activity. It's really just being mindful of the infinite awareness that surrounds you on a daily basis.   I sit down at my cube and I'll meditate on the sound of the keys hitting the keyboard from my coworkers. I'll meditate on objects on my desk. I get lost in the smell of popcorn being made in the kitchen.   Meditation is just being aware of what's around you :) So, sit back in your desk, take a deep breath, and soak the world in.   Also, if you find that you need that silence to meditate and you can't do it in your cube, why not drive to work in silence? That's what I do! Silence is the best gift you can give yourself! So, turn off the radio and meditate on the humming of your engine. Meditate on the feeling of the wheel under your hands. Meditate on how you are living right this very second and this second is the only one that matters."

Meditation,3c4i0p,LadyGrizabella,9,Sun Jul 5 02:41:41 2015 UTC,"I was the CTO (North America) of the largest private publishing house in the world. I worked out of the NYC and California offices. Since they were a private company, they would purchase other companies to take 'public'. I was in charge of all of the servers, databases, security & web design for two of those initial public offerings. (All Sun, Oracle...) This, of course, led to scrutiny by the securities and exchange commission. I was also in charge of all of the electronic preparation (except internal phone systems, desktops, and e-mail) for Y2k. (Remember how much fun that was?)  It was required that I wear a three piece suit, and boutonniere every day at work and I traveled to California regularly, along with other offices in North America.  Since we had an e-commerce site (for magazines and a major publisher of romance novels) which stored credit card information, and I had full access (along with others obviously) I had to go through a full background check and be bonded.  One of the requirements of the position was to 'translate' between the technical people and artists and the board of directors.  I live a simple life-- not extravagant in the least. I was probably the only one I met at work that did not smoke, drink, or regularly use anything (think of coffee) that might be addictive. The other executives had yachts, would take the company jet and fill their expense account. The only thing I regularly expensed (which wasn't necessary) were small 'give aways' that I would drop on the people that reported to me (things like movie tickets and enough for dinner for two at a place like Friday's Restaurant).  I did not fit in with the other executives but did very well for the company (and myself) financially, so they put up with me.  I tendered my resignation right after September 11th but remotely worked with my boss (without additional compensation) until they had a replacement lined up.  While the other executives discussed their weekends of yachting and golfing, I smiled and nodded. I never discussed that I taught in prisons or worked soup kitchens. They just though I was an introvert and shy. They would never have guessed I was a Buddhist or would pull the 'hold my calls' to meditate at work.  I can assure you I don't have a 'hippy' hair cut (any more). We'll just keep that a secret! ;)"

My kid has had all his vax, I use medicine/go to the doctor when it's appropriate and I don't eat purely ""clean"" organic food. I clean with chemicals..sometimes. Most of the time I use a vinegar/water solution but every now and then (like today where I spent close to six straight hours cleaning) I'll get the urge to deep clean all the things and use bleach, Mr. Clean and various other cleaning solutions that come in a bottle.  I LOVE heavy metal (especially classic metal from the 70s/80s) and I drive a mom-mobile hatchback.

But I lean towards his learning some sort of Judaistic spirituality, maybe Kabbalah or something similar. This is because he was recorded to have written something in the sand right before he committed a ""miracle"" (IIRC about ""casting the first stone""). This hints toward something occult.  Well, there's always the possibility that he learned both.  Edit: forgot to answer the question.  Whether or not the spiritual practice of this tradition involves something that in modern terms falls under ""meditation"" is, of course, still debatable.

Everything that I do, I do meditatively. Or at least endavour to do so.  At the end of the day, meditation is just the practice of keeping your awareness grounded deeply in the present moment, so that the future and past aren't clawing away at your attention.  This is likely how Jesus lived his life. I've never had a chance to meet him, but it's quite certain that he was meditative in all of his movements and stillness.  The alternative is to be unconscious and caught up in worry, stress, ambitions, and/or goal-setting. It's unlikely that someone could have had that incredible influence on history without being heavily grounded in his meditative practice.  Hope this helps."

I think most historians agree that Jesus, in some form, existed, but that's about it. I consider Jesus as the son of God to be a fiction. It's pointless to speculate whether that over-idealized demigod would have meditated. There are Christians now who meditate, though. It's certainly not in conflict with Christianity.

Meditation,3c74d5,YourMVP01,3,Sun Jul 5 14:22:44 2015 UTC,"Bhante G.: ""Samatha can be translated as 'concentration' or 'tranquility.' It is a state in which the mind is brought to rest, focused only on one item and not allowed to wander.""  ""The object of Vipassana practice is to learn to see the truth of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness of phenomena.""  http://www.tricycle.com/new-buddhism/mental-discipline/vipassana-meditation"
Meditation,3c74d5,plooberdoo,2,Sun Jul 5 16:28:59 2015 UTC,"This is coming from a Vedic understanding, specifically ""The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali"".  When most of us begin meditating, we are unable to concentrate for more than a few seconds at a time, if that. We need a technique that allows us to focus on a single thought long enough to gain insight from it. So, we begin by concentrating on the breath.   A natural occurrence of this practice is a slower, more deliberate thought process. This is called contemplation, the ability to take a thought and spend brief moments of time on it, over and over again, until such times at we gain insight from the thought.   As we keep progressing, we get to concentration, or the ability to hold a single thought in mind until be receive flashes of insight from it.   Trying to start out from Insight is a little like going to the gym the first day, and lift weights in the back with the body-builders. Most mortals just can't do it.   Most of us don't even know we can't do it. The breath gives us irrefutable proof of our weakness. Then there's the problem of Makyo, when we think we are concentrating, but are in fact daydreaming.   Yes, it is possible to get profound insights from Samatha, or breath concentration. The foundations you build will be with you til the end. Anyone who thinks they can do concentration without being able to focus on the breath is probably fooling themselves.   A good guide is a rare treasure. May you find one.   May your path lead you to the ultimate goal."
Meditation,3c74d5,Vanthu,2,Sun Jul 5 16:30:11 2015 UTC,"Insight from the perspective of vipassana is understanding the three characteristics of existence: impermanence, painfulness and non-self.  If you continue to practice the technique you described you will develop both mindfulness and concentration. Once those two are sufficient you can move on to developing insight that culminates in enlightenment.  You will know concentration and mindfulness are well enough developed when you reach the insight stage of ""arising and passing away"". This stage is where the fundamental characteristic of existence called ""impermanence"" starts to manifest on a perceptual/sense level. Some people describe this as ""losing one's boundaries."" The way it manifests on the tactile sense level is through ""piti"". You can look at the wikipedia page for piti (as it relates to buddhism) for a description.  You can do this by yourself. It just takes a certain level of concentration and mindfulness and the realization that when ""arising and passing away"" manifests you need to be aware of more than just the breath. Instead you will spend time focusing on the body (e.g the breath, posture, movement, etc . . . ), feelings (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, piti, etc . . . ), the mind (passion, irritation, the mind free of passion, the mind free of irritation, etc . . . ) and mental qualities (altertness, mindfulness, investigation, etc . . . ). This describes the four frames of mindfulness meditation.  You can focus on and be mindful of these frames of reference before A&P but it is easier to build concentration by focusing on a single sensation like the breath.  You can know when a good time to switch your focus is when you enter the insight stage of A&P. EDIT: Just to be clear, if you meditate for an hour a day this stage of insight could take decades to develop. If you meditate 5+ hours a day it could take a few months. If you meditate 10+ hours a day (like on a retreat) it could happen in a matter of days."

Meditation,3c6egd,shyguy1212,3,Sun Jul 5 07:12:19 2015 UTC,"The fact that you noticed the sensation is most likely due to your meditation, but only you would really know whether the feeling arose because of your meditation or some other cause. You will notice a variety of sensations while meditating. Some pleasant and some unpleasant. Some will arise because of the calming, concentrating effects of meditation andsome will arise for reasons long present but getting noticed for the first time because you are paying close attention.  You should endeavor to avoid too much fascination with any particular feeling or sensation arising in the body. When we attempt to recreate a feeling or find it again in successive meditation sessions we risk disappointment when we don't find it, and we are also distracted from what is actually going on in our mind and body at that moment - some of which could be more pleasant than the feeling we're seeking.

Meditation,3c5kax,Xeroxkx,5,Sun Jul 5 00:36:43 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think ""stopping thoughts"" as in punching them to death or shoving them away hard is the best way of going about it (in case that's what you're doing).  Thoughts are not enemies. They're indications of what's going on in your mind. The reason why meditators talk about ""getting rid"" of thoughts isn't because they're evil, it's because they're abstract (that's my perspective, by the way, not necessarily theirs). Working on something on an abstract level rarely changes your thinking and your emotional responses.  So, what you do is look beyond the thoughts, because the thoughts are really just an executive summary of sorts, and also easy to misinterpret. Then, when something more concrete, more ""feely"" or more ""experential"" comes up, it's important to remember that whatever is coming up doesn't have any inherent meaning, it's just something you have ""learned"". If it's something that you feel doesn't serve you well, keep your awareness firmly on the sensations and feelings, don't fan the flames by reading anything into them. Just observe them and the subtle and less subtle ways in which they are changing. Remind yourself that this is an experience, not meaning. If any memories come up, same thing applies. You're in the here and now, and the memory is just an experience.  It's easier to do this on smaller things, especially in the beginning. If you've got any stuff that's loaded with powerful mental responses that you want to let go, don't start with that. I mean, you can try if you like, maybe you're better at it than you think... you can't really make it significantly worse unless you keep trying really hard to not judge and you're not really succeeding yet.  Over time, yes, this kind of process takes apart conditioning.  However, conditioning isn't inherently bad, and it's probably not a good idea to go on a mission specifically to exterminate all automatic responses that bother you. Some ""negative"" emotions reflect valid concerns, some don't. Meditation practice doesn't fully replace therapy or guidance from a mentor. In the absence of that, if in some area of your life, any attempt to get rid of ""bad things"" only ends in new issues coming up, maybe that's an indication that there's something you're missing. This is probably one reason why people recommend meditating without a specific goal in mind: you're less likely to ""meditate away things"" you're not actually better off without. That said, in my opinion, letting small things dissipate is almost certainly safe and can have quite far-reaching effects if you keep at it."

But how does the de-conditioning work, exactly?   Exactly like that.   By letting thoughts, that are a hindrance to mindfulness, continue the mind becomes conditioned and those thoughts strengthen. By putting an end to wandering thoughts whenever we become mindful of them the mind becomes less and less conditioned and those thoughts weaken.   If I stop myself from engaging in certain thoughts through mindfulness and will power, will they become less prevalent?   Yes   Also, what exactly causes habits/conditioning to form?   The hindrances to mindfulness (desire, ill-will, doubt, worry, and laziness) and mindlessness in general.   Also when feeling very stressed and anxious what is the most important thing to remember in order to not facilitate conditioned responses?   Mindfulness. Then apply that mindfulness in such a way that brings an end to the hindrances of mindfulness.   And is my practice a good long-term way to get rid of conditioned responses?    Yes."
Meditation,3c5kax,Gojeezy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:54:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great response! This next one is a bit unrelated, but the basic principle of mindfulness is to observe and return, correct? Observe the though, observe the feeling, and return to the present moment. I was wondering how doing so makes us ""know ourselves"" better. I mean, I've noticed hundreds of thoughts just today, not considering the many thousands I haven't. How exactly does the practice work in that regard? Does it work subconsciously in some ways? I'm not asking for a neuroscientific answer or anything like that, but I would appreciate an answer out of experience. Thanks!"
Meditation,3c5kax,Gojeezy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:11:50 2015 UTC,"the basic principle of mindfulness is to observe and return, correct?   Yep. Observation and awareness are two ways to describe mindfulness and returning to an anchor (initial application of the mind to an object and sustained application of mind) is concentration. These two qualities come together as mindfulness meditation.   I was wondering how doing so makes us ""know ourselves"" better.   Well, like you have said, you are starting to notice your thoughts; attachment to thoughts is part of what constitutes the ego or illusory self.  Aside from just noticing, by building concentration you are pacifying those thoughts. This way you are pacifying attachment and therefore the ego and the illusory sense of self. What is left after all attachment (to every sensation- not just thoughts) is gone is the true self or non-self as some traditions call it.   Does it work subconsciously in some ways?   I am sure it does but mindfulness meditation, according to my understanding, is the most conscious way we can go about letting go of attachments. That is why insight can be so painful; we are aware of all the letting go we are doing."

Meditation,3c5kax,tpm_,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:22:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree with some of the other commenters that ""pushing away"" thoughts is the way to decondition yourself. I think, if anything, that is the opposite of what you should be doing!  I used to do that during meditation, and I hear a lot of newbies do that as well, and they struggle with meditation.   Being in the moment, ""zen,"" or meditative, whatever you want to call it, is a restful, peaceful state.  It is NOT about exerting yourself. Pushing things away from you is exertion.  Saying, ""I don't want this thought! Go away, I will not think this thought!"" is a waste of energy. If anything, it will make the thoughts stronger.  Why? Because your thoughts are there for a reason. Whether your mind is being illogical or not, it is giving you these thoughts because it is trying to show you something. I sometimes find it helpful to think of my inner mind, subconscious, ego, whatever you want to call it, as like a little child.  If you yell at it, you're just going to teach it to hate you. If you try to talk to it peacefully instead, it is much more likely to work with you.  When you get thoughts you don't want, instead of pushing them away or engaging them, you do the middle ground between these two things: you don't do anything.  If I'm scared of spiders, and the thought of finding a spider pops into my head, I should say: ""thank you mind, but I don't need that thought. I know, pretty reasonably, that there are no spiders here. And if there were, making myself panic about them will not make them go away.""   Or, if you're even better at meditation than that, you can just ignore them entirely. You don't shun them, but you act indifferent to them. ""That's nice, thanks, but that's totally unimportant to me right now.""  If the thought comes to you 100 more times, you just do the same thing.  You are peaceful, you are zen, your true state is calm, logical, and one with what is around you. You are not swayed by anything.  The hard part about meditation--and the thing that makes it so stupidly brilliant--is that it involves not doing anything. It's a way of getting yourself to say, ""I don't have to worry about this, or that, or feel ashamed or regretful of this or that. I am a calm being, I am logical, I am secure, and I'm going to save my energy for something better than worrying about some fucking spiders.""  This is what helps me, at least. When I started thinking of meditation in this way it made all the difference."

Meditation,3c7f9h,mindsculpt,2,Sun Jul 5 17:50:27 2015 UTC,"Why don't you try to meditate on the outside sources? Meditation, at least for me, is being in that infinite awareness within yourself. You allow yourself to feel everything all at once.   Actually, ok, this is a neat story that I think you'll identify with:   I went to a meditation workshop in Philadelphia a few weeks ago and we were in a yoga studio. While we were meditating, I could hear the people in the apartment above the studio. Someone was walking and I could hear a dog prancin' along. Maybe a bark or two.   After the meditation session, I had said to the teacher that it was interesting that the dog upstairs didn't bother me today, but when I'm at home meditating I'll bug out if I hear my dog barking.   He said the reason that the dog in the yoga studio didn't ""throw me off"" was because, well, it had nothing to do with me. That isn't my dog. I don't have to attend to the dog upstairs. However, when I'm at home, I feel obligated to check on my dog to make sure he is OK.   So, with that being said, what about your outer stimuli? Are they directly related to you? Do you feel like you have to address them? If you have no relation to them, knock it off. Just let the outside world do it's thing. You focus on you. That outside stimuli is just reminding you that you are totally alive and present in this very moment :)"
Meditation,3c60ol,fastifguy,3,Sun Jul 5 03:56:47 2015 UTC,"There are 40 meditation objects in buddhism altogether but some of them only allow the practitioner to reach access concentration. Jhana is easiest with:  (1) earth, (2) water, (3) fire, (4) air, wind, (5) blue, green, (6) yellow, (7) red, (8) white, (9) enclosed space, (10) bright light.  Here is what the wikipedia page says:   Of these, due to their complexity, eight recollections (excluding the recollection of the Body (kāyagatāsati) and of Breathing (ānāpānassati)), the perception of disgust of food and the analysis of the four elements only lead to access concentration (upacara samadhi).  Absorption in the first jhana can be realized by mindfulness on the ten kinds of foulness and mindfulness of the body. However, these meditations cannot go beyond the first jhana due to their involving applied thought (vitaka) which is absent from the higher jhanas.  Absorption in the first three jhanas can be realized by contemplating the first three brahma-viharas. However, these meditations cannot aid in attaining the fourth jhana due to the pleasant feelings associated with them. Conversely, once the fourth jhana is induced, the fourth brahma-vihara (equanimity) arises.  Due to the simplicity of subject matter, all four jhanas can be induced through mindfulness of breathing and the ten kasinas.[3]"

Make sure you aren't sitting in a way that restricts your breathing. Make sure your clothing is not restricting your breathing.  Try to relax all the muscles in your chest and abdomen.  Try to breathe deliberately just by inhaling from the diaphragm and exhaling by relaxing the diaphragm so the inhalations and inhalations are about the same length. Don't tighten the abdominal muscles when you exhale. Don't tighten the chest muscles when you inhale. If you breathe this way you are doing very little to interfere with the natural breathing and it might be easier to switch over to natural breathing. If you breathe this way while meditating, you might switch over to natural breathing without realizing it.  It might help to make sure your diaphragm is completely relaxed before inhaling.

Meditation,3c5vba,Kroovistos,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:07:09 2015 UTC,"Why don't you try some advanced forms of breathing meditation? Most of the early stages in learning that is getting used to the feeling of certain techniques and learning how to feel the breath and the power.   Visualization is a good technique because it forces your mind to focus on whatever you're trying to visualize. For instance, if you're getting ""stuck"" manually breathing, imagine that your chest is a bellows and breath in deep, breath out slow and steady, and visualize a fire growing stronger from within your core.   Optionally you can go straight for non-thought meditation which will target the problem (your mind going off course). Non-thought is sometimes hard to accomplish without some sort of primer ie: being good at visualizing so you start to think more with images instead of words -> learn to suppress thoughts via visualization techniques like your mind is an ocean, your thoughts are the bubbles coming from vents underwater, and you control the vents -> learn how to silence mind completely without imagery."

I assume you all were lying down because it's really hard to fall asleep and stay asleep while sitting.   If you were lying down had your eyes closed and were in a relaxed state, then your body doesn't really care if you need sleep or not. This is familiar and your body will go to sleep and it sometimes doesn't care if your mind is still awake or not.   You most likely were on the onset of sleep and in a borderland state between dream and waking life. In this state all kinds of hallucinations are common.   I tried to lucid dream for some time and one technique is called WILD. This is the description for it from the luciddreaming subreddit:   ""Wake-Induced Lucid Dream - A technique in which you maintain consciousness while your body falls asleep. Not for the squeamish""  Take a guess why they explicitly say ""not for the squeamish"". That's because you run into all sorts of bodily sensations,  hallucinations and even sleep paralysis.

May the Reality dawn on me so that I realize that I am the immortal Self and not the body.  -- Sri M  By experiencing life through the sorrows, the pleasures, the pains and the happiness, one evolves into a better and cleaner entity before touching a level that cannot be called human, but divine.  -- Sri M  If what we think and how we act can go together, then meditation begins. To not bring about this dichotomy in one’s life, one has to be eternally watchful. It means, as you go about your life, a part of your mind should carefully watch your thoughts and action. This eternal vigilance, I think, is a better form of meditation than sitting cross-legged for an hour and falling into a semi-sleep.  -- Sri M  The Buddhists say compassion is the essence of Nirvana. I believe there is only one Self manifesting as you and I—if I serve you and others, I serve myself; If I hurt you or others, I hurt myself. It’s important to watch our mind, to watch our thoughts, to watch what happens around us. Such constant awareness leads to a greater understanding, which is indeed the start of compassion. The virtue of showing compassion to all living beings is central to all faiths of the earth.  In the early days of establishing the Belur Math, Swami Vivekananda’s co-monks expressed their displeasure about one of the Math’s main dictums of serving the poor. Swamiji was annoyed and, as he prepared to leave the Math forever, he spoke to the monks about Sri Ramakrishna’s pilgrimage to Deogarh. The town of Deogarh was undergoing a severe famine and the people were dying from hunger. Sri Ramakrishna, seeing the plight of the villagers, was deeply anguished and refused to leave until a supply of rations was organised for their survival. Sri Ramakrishna ate only after the villagers were fed. Hearing this story, the monks immediately apologised and requested Swami Vivekananda to continue in his leadership role at Belur Math.  Religions may differ in their intrinsic philosophy but all religions profess the same message – a human being should become compassionate, kind and loving.  The prayer of a Muslim mentions two words, Rahim and Rahman; here there is a definite mention of compassion and mercy. If all humans could demonstrate these two qualities to everyone, there is no greater way to get closer to God and to Manav Ekta.  There is a story related to Prophet Muhammad who was leaving to offer prayers on Ramadan day. He was a little far away from the mosque he frequented and he was getting late. It is usual for followers of Islam to buy new clothes for children on this auspicious occasion. On the way to the mosque, the Prophet met an orphan child wearing tattered clothes. He asked the child if he had any new clothes for the occasion. Understanding his plight, he took the child with him, bought new cloth and had them stitched, thus making the child happy. All the while, his followers kept reminding that he was getting late for the prayers. The Prophet gently told his followers that what he did for the child in itself is the greatest prayer and, even if his prayer got a little late, it was not of greater importance than this act of compassion.  Hundred years ago, Sree Narayana Guru, sadhu and social reformer from Kerala, said, “Whatever be the religion, man should develop goodness.” While extending one’s compassion unto others, forget not oneself since, more often than not, we are unkind to our own selves than to anyone else.  Compassion brings us together and, let me remind you, its practice involves a reflective attitude: Do to others what you would have them do to you.  -- Sri M"

When I am clear,  The is no point where one can be clear,one can feel clear but how on earth can one be clear and how is it possable to know that.  when I can control what thought I want,  Thought cannot not be controlled,right now ask yourself can you control thought.can you slow it down or create a time when it will occure.another question is who could the controller be that controlls thought."
Meditation,3c4syv,bottlecap123,2,Sun Jul 5 13:50:05 2015 UTC,"Sri M comes from a rather advanced lineage.   Just because you cannot do it.... yet, don't assume he cannot. Just because you cannot do it.... yet, do not assume you will not be able to in the future. I believe you will.  When the alarm clock goes off in the morning, you can indeed control enough thought to make yourself get up. That is thought control. It is just a matter of building up enough strength that, when the space between thoughts at the top of the breath and the bottom of the breath becomes great enough that bliss becomes one's thought, a subtle shift in the energies of the mind, created through conscious control, can set it's direction."
Meditation,3c4syv,Vanthu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:23:35 2015 UTC,The point is not whether I can control thought right now. Can I control it after decent experience and discipline?

Look now.can you control thought,can you stop them,can you make them come,can you know which will come an hour from now  This is called direct pointing,through taking the negative route of founding out what you not in order to find out what you are.your true nature.one of this exercise is finding out own your own that you cannot do anything to thoughts."
Meditation,3c493n,indigokrones,7,Sat Jul 4 17:02:25 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are present to your emotions - and that's certainly a large component of being mindful.   It also sounds like you are attaching judgement values to the outcome of your practise.  Try switching your 'goal' from ""Breakthrough or mitigation of troubling emotions"" to experience for the sake of experience.  In this way, no matter what happens, your ""goal"" (if we need an arbitrary measure for our practise) will be just to sit in stillness and be present to whatever comes.  Hope this is valuable."

After meditating on everyone's responses for a few days I think I've come to some conclusions.   As someone said below, I believe my issue has largely been with my attitude towards this emotional state. I realized during my meditation today, that, while I hadn't been explicitly labeling it as such, I had been viewing this emotion as intrusive and unwanted.   After having this realization, I tried to be present with in a much more patient and loving sort of way and was even able to find some peace and light in it, which was really great. Thanks a bunch everyone!"

Meditation,3c493n,Trower12,2,Sat Jul 4 19:29:59 2015 UTC,"Meditation can bring up a lot of past emotional energies that you have been ignoring for a long time. Sometimes while meditating I would feel strong emotions that seem to come out of nowhere: fear, doubt, sadness, etc. I stay with the feeling, experience it fully, send it patient love, and afterwards I often feel rejuvenated and at peace.   It can be very tricky to overcome old habits, the old energies want to stay within you and prevent you from making a real breakthrough. Experiencing physical and/or mental discomfort while meditating could be a sign that you are making real progress and are actually dealing with your old negative energies in an effective way."

You say you feel these emotions, but wouldn't these emotions only come about when you actively think about the circumstance that caused the emotion? I'm somewhat new to mindful meditation, and I may be looking at the practice entirely wrong. Aren't you supposed to be feeling, and focusing on, what you feel in the present moment, and nothing else?  I don't mean to sound condescending either, sorry if it came out like that."
Meditation,3c493n,BudgetTheLeech,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:30:16 2015 UTC,The issue for myself has largely been that these emotions are seemingly coming from nowhere. There isn't a specific thought that triggers them. I feel fairly confident in my practice so I don't believe it's a lack of mindfulness or concentration which brings this heaviness up. It really seems to come out purely on it's own volition.   I do agree with the person above who says that I'm being a bit too judgemental about it - and that a bit more equanimity would help soften it's impact. The point of my post was my trying to gain some insight into what I think might be my minds way of releasing old tensions and negative energies which I had been suppressing or had been numb too. A healing process if you will.

Meditation,3c5508,txgamer77,3,Sat Jul 4 21:54:24 2015 UTC,"Having a tic or twitch is certainly not on the same level as pushing down any and all thoughts and feelings; though (as you seem to suspect) the tic may arise from the suppression.  This is not at all the correct approach to meditation. You may be taking a certain posture and trying to do a certain method, but what you are doing is not meditation.  But before getting into the issue of meditation, I recommend you address the 'super control freak', suppressive relationship you have with your mind. Meditation may not be helpful to you at this time, and may actually be a bad activity for you. If you habitually suppress your mind, coming in closer contact with it could be harmful.  Have you ever told parents, doctor, counselor, or mental health professional about these issues? Have you received treatment for them? These are your first steps, not meditation."

Meditation,3c5508,ringer54673,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:48:59 2015 UTC,"Generally, physical twitches are the result of relaxing muscles that had been active for a long time. E.g., if you face is always contorted into a scowl, then if you release that tension you will notice a lot of your facial muscles will want to twitch.   As soon as any kind of emotion or feeling arises intense up and push it down.    There are skillful ways and not so skillful ways of doing this. If you do it through mindfulness meditation, by letting go of emotions (there are a few different techniques for letting go, the least of which is actually by sheer power of will) and returning to an anchor, then it is a fairly skillful means of dealing with emotions. Overtime, you will pacify your self of these conditioned emotional responses.  On the other hand, if you push emotions down and try to replace them by getting caught up in another series of thoughts, or some other type of pleasant sensory stimulation (video games, television shows, etc. . . ) then that is not very skillful and is not pacifying your conditioned mind. Instead, it is conditioning your mind to be more mindless and to wander more; this will result in more strong emotions that arise in the future."

Meditation,3c5508,Gojeezy,0,Sun Jul 5 00:48:00 2015 UTC,"Of course.  Mindfulness of breathing:   Focus on the breath.   A. Pick either a physical sensations (e.g: the rise and fall of the abdomen, the breath passing through the nose, the breath passing the tip of the nose, etc... ), a mental concept (""in"" and ""out"", or a point in space that the breath passes, or the process of the rising and falling of the abdomen, etc... ) or both. The mind will begin to wander. When you notice it has (a moment of mindfulness) return focus to the breath. Rinse and repeat.   Sometimes a moment of mindfulness is not enough to let go of thoughts though. In that case, there are a lot of different techniques that will allow you to bring the mind back to your anchor. The least of which is simply by sheer power of will . . . which has always worked the best for me (but I am a simple man) but most people (at least the most vocal on this subreddit) are opposed to any force being applied at all.   The buddha even said, if all else fails, beat thoughts into submission like a strong man beating a weaker man.  Here is a list of the different techniques you can use to let go of wandering thoughts:  Vitakkasanthana Sutta: The Relaxation of Thoughts EDIT: BTW Each paragraph describes a different technique.

Your ""waiting for it to go off"" is just another thought that has to be let go, just like any of the other ones. Continue to sit until it goes off. You've already committed yourself to meditating for a certain amount of time, so there's no reason to wait for it to go off. It'll come in due time.  I meditate with a timer, usually, but sometimes if I'm not in a place I can use my phone or computer (or don't want to, like when I went on a beach trip and thought it'd be a good time to detox from tech) I used my malas. 108 beads takes me about 20 minutes to get through, with one breath per bead.

It also happens every now and again that I lift my eyes, breaking meditation and look at the timer just a couple of seconds before it goes off, pretty cool when that happens.  However, does anybody know of an iPhone app that can make me set time notifications every 10, 15 or 20, minutes? It'd be great the have the phone just make a tiny sound after 20 minutes so that I can continue if I want to. Normal alarm just breaks concentration too much because I have to turn around (I put the phone behind me) and switch it off."

For example if I have only 15 minutes to meditate before a meeting then I put on a 15 minute recording, or if I'm feeling like playing another one - slightly longer - then I start it 15 minutes prior to the end. It is quite a gentle exit from the meditative state as the great audios tend to have very smoothing and pleasant to hear endings."

Id like to meditate without worries so i make sure i have no appointments no one to disturb me and all my stuff dealt with then i go to a clean safe environment to feel safe and relaxed. Then i focus on my meditation. Everyone is gonna tell you their opinion but in the end it is what you think its best either way take it was a learning experience. I have tried it both ways and found mine in time you will too. The important part is to let go of your thoughts and making sure you are focused. The rest doesn't matter. If you let go even for a small amount of time then it will only get better from there. Advice: Deal with your stuff first make sure you aren't tired to practice meditation because i found it to be somewhat harmful at least for me then when you don't have any worries go for it! Time doesnt matter! Its what you make out of the experience! Dont pressure yourself into imma do this for x time. It takes out the purpose of meditating.

For my part, I used meditation or mindfulness to deal with the pain of being stabbed through the hand in a kitchen accident. But, I didn't bring my attention away from it. I put my attention full-on right at the pain, feeling it without resistance. It did help me, in the immediate aftermath and while I was recovering.  In fact, I think it might have worked too well. I never got any painkillers afterwards, because I think that the nurses and the doctor in the emergency room thought I was an opiate addict who had stabbed himself to get drugs by how calm I was.

In regards to not experiencing a difference in thoughts: focusing on the breath is concentration meditation. It has to be accompanied simultaneously by mindfulness meditation, which will raise your awareness above the thoughts.

From my experience with people, including Muslims, the feeling of belonging to a religion is secondary to the spiritual emotions it provides for the person who practices religion.  I would also like to point out that there are buddhists terrorists. Did you ever hear of Myanmar/Burma? Buddhists there have been persecuting and murdered Muslims for a few years... Humanity is capable of savage things. There are Jewish terrorists. Etc. Etc.... These actions are inherit in our biology but religious doctrines give the followers an excuse to be savage, especially Abrahamic religions which have the most violence in their scriptures (the Torah, Quran, Bible... open all of them up and see). The issue with Islam is that it has much more religious people then any of the others today. Did you ever hear about the Spanish inquisition? Where Catholics were committed the terrible crimes in the name of Christianity?  All religions are man-made and the elimination of all religious doctrines would be a boon for humanity. But even then terrorism will persist. Humans are capable of destruction or violence regardless of what doctrine they use to justify actions.  But yeah, the reason I said all of this in response to your simple comment is because it set a trigger to the way people make it look like Islam is inherently worse than all other religions. It's a horrible religion if you choose to look at it that way. But so are Christianity and Judaism."
Meditation,3c2npq,mock94,6,Sat Jul 4 16:52:23 2015 UTC,"The reason is NOT because there are more Muslims. No doubt the other Abrahamic religions also have extremely violent and horrible doctrines, but they have undergone a mass reformation (over hundreds of years and probably millions of lives lost) where the majority of Christians are taught to ignore large parts of their ideology in order to accept modern values. The reason there are more Muslim terrorists today is because such a reformation has not taken place in most of the Muslim world. It's not just terrorism, by the way. According to research by the Pew Center it is MAINSTREAM belief in the muslim world that: death should be the penalty for apostasy, that sharia should be in place, that men are above women, etc. Islam is an incredibly dangerous ideology, and its followers believe that ideology much more literally at this moment than other religions in the world. Of course this may not be politically correct and offensive, so it is not a popular belief."
Meditation,3c2npq,Heathen26,2,Sat Jul 4 17:12:30 2015 UTC,"Well, firstly, it's actually an extremely popular belief. The notion that Islam is a deeply violent and regressive religion because it hasn't had a ""secular"" reformation like Christianity is hugely popular opinion on both sides of the Atlantic.  Secondly, this is an incredibly simplistic explanation for Islamic violence and religious thought -- or any violence or thought, to be honest. Religion is certainly an important aspect of how society is shaped, but the line of reasoning you're giving here presents it to the exclusion of the multitude of other factors that contribute to broader political phenomenons (like violence). Rather than a sole determinant, it is part of a complex web of factors. Geopolitics, the economy, foreign involvement in very long historical perspectives, religion, availability of natural resources, population growth, and so on. All of these affect one another in complex ways, and they all contribute to things like violence. Singling out a single factor and claiming it is ""the reason"" makes you sort of a blind man describing the trunk of an elephant, you know?  I'm not disputing the results of the Pew polls, these are certainly problematic attitudes -- but claiming Islamic religion is the dominant, let alone the only factor, seems rather simplistic to me."
Meditation,3c2npq,shahgaltaligu,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:25:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah for whatever reason people struggle with correlation vs. causation in situations like this. The reasons are less due to the religion and more to do with the fact that the middle east, a part of the world where the majority of people are Muslims, faces abject poverty and political instability in many areas.   For instance, Uganda, a largely Catholic nation, is on the verge of committing genocide against its gay population. Does this mean Catholicism causes people to want to kill gay people? No, of course not, there are many political and economic factors that have led Uganda to this point."
Meditation,3c2npq,ThePoodlenoodler,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:16:32 2015 UTC,"I've found that many many people are unwilling to accept ideology as the main or even one of the factors behind this phenomenon.   I would agree that it is not the only reason, of course not. However, I'm arguing that it is the most important factor. Geopolitics, the economy, foreign involvement, and other things have had a huge effect on the middle east, but to say what has happened is the normal reaction to it is absurd. These events are part of the reason the secular reformation hasn't taken place and fundamentalist Islam is still popular. But this is only a problem in the first place because the ideology of fundamentalist Islam is a problem.  I look at other countries and places where there has been much foreign involvement and slow economic growth (southeast asia for example) and see a very, very different reaction."

Meditation,3c4092,pdoogs,3,Sat Jul 4 15:39:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not totally sure if I know what you're asking, or are you asking anything? Are you just sharing your new insights?  A thought is information that is held in the mind and accessed by awareness. Most minds are an enormous collection of thoughts.  Most people align their sense of identity very tightly and heavily with their minds. Therefore the more they think, the more they can attach to themselves who they think they are.  So for example when you say something that just occurred to you and someone else says ""Oh yeah, I've thought of that already, a couple years ago."" It's like they're saying ""Oh yeah, I've already attached that thing to who I am."" ""So large is my mind, that this and many other thoughts have already passed through it.""  There's also a satisfaction of being ""ahead"" of someone. If you think something today that I thought yesterday, then it's almost as if I'm ""a day ahead of you."" I'm winning the ""race"" of who can become the biggest and best.  Winning is another way a person may attach more value to themselves, feel better about themselves, feel more significant. Losing, has the opposite effect. Even if you're losing a game of solitaire.  A good question can be: Is there any reality to winning and losing? To being smarter or dumber? To knowing many things or knowing only a few things?  Is one really ahead of anyone else? How is this evaluated?  That was interesting. Thank you!"

Perhaps there are notable people that your family respects who also meditate. It might be worthwhile to do a bit of research to see if you can find someone familiar to them.  It's not unusual for family members to react negatively to something about which they know little.

Meditation,3c36td,PixieSnakes,3,Sat Jul 4 10:42:35 2015 UTC,"Yes! It can. That's the short answer.  Yes, but not in the way that you think. Your question contains an error, that if you can see it, will help you significantly move past all your guilt and fear. At least I hope so :).  ""Can consistent meditation eliminate these deep, intrusive, irrational feelings?""  Good! Good question. Now here's my question about your words, deep, intrusive, and irrational:  Where do they come from? If they're intrusive, then from where do they intrude? If they're deep, deep where? And what makes you think that they're irrational?  Because when you say irrational, it tells me that that you've disowned these feelings. You don't like them, you want them to go away.  And yet... they come from you! Right? They are quite clearly your own creations, aren't they? Guilt doesn't come from the sky and harass you, it comes FROM you. It is spun by your mind.  You start thinking about something that happened, and you feel guilty, and you keep thinking about it, you feel more guilty. Your emotions are painful, your body is cringing with shame... It's coming from you. You're doing this.  And yet when I say ""You're doing this."" It's not YOU who are asking for help on Reddit, it's... your pain-body. That's what Eckhart Tolle calls it. It's your madness. It's your dysfunction.  You're divided, you see? There's a part of you that continues to revisit those memories that make you feel guilty. Again and again. You're doing this! It's not necessary to access those memories, but there's an aspect of you that wants to because it finds that guilt strangely... delicious.  Do you see? Are you following me? You keep going into those thoughts. Analyzing and over-analyzing. Shame. Fear. Guilt. You keep coming back to them. Why? It's like junk-food for the mind. It's bad for you but you keep doing it because it's... weirdly satisfying.  And YET... at the same time it has a certain momentum to it that sucks you in. You're meditating, and these feelings are deep, intrusive... they scream at you: ""Pay attention me! Think about me some more! Do you remember how bad it was when...?""  And you're tortured by them! You just want them to go away, but they won't because they won't go away any more than your own hand or foot will go away. It's all you. It's all the same chemistry. When you eat food, you're feeding it as well.  So now we can finally answer the question: ""Can consistent meditation eliminate these deep, intrusive, irrational feelings?""  No! You can't eliminate anything. It's all you. Your question means that you're rejecting your own self. You're splitting yourself in two. You're driving a wedge in your own self. You're splintering. Your question is a violence on your very own beloved self. ""How to get rid of myself?""  To make the suffering stop, stop the war!! Put down your arms. Stop hurting yourself! Make peace.  How to do this? It means, for a moment, stop struggling and fretting and condemning. As much as you can, stop hurting yourself. Stop being hard on yourself. Stop speaking hurtfully about yourself.  Here's a very important distinction that I believe will help you immensely:  There's a difference between thinking and feeling. There's also a difference between dwelling and healing.  Thinking, returning to unhappy memories creates more bad feelings. You revisit these memories again and again, you create more guilt and more shame.  But -  Feeling the guilt, heals you. Ultimately - and please hear me, /u/behseh, you have been dwelling on memories and avoiding your feelings. Now it's time to reverse it. Now you allow yourself to feel guilt, and stop dwelling on the memories. The guilt is HERE RIGHT NOW. It's in your moment. It's present even as you read this message. You've been avoiding it. Stop avoiding. Allow your guilt, fear and shame. Allow yourself to feel these feelings. This is how you heal.  It's uncomfortable. You've been denying these feelings for your whole life. You've been trying to push them away, and you've been suffering as a result.  Stop the war. Bring unity in yourself. Let yourself feel what you feel. You can even take the label off. You don't have to call it ""guilt"" ... just a pattern of energy that makes you uncomfortable. Let yourself get into and feel it completely.  It will be just for a short period of time, then it will heal. You will heal. You will feel better.  Okay! That's all. Good luck!"

I've found myself really invested in the outcome and unwisely following the loud, angry noise, instead of the usual skimming headlines and seeking out good conversations. On the one hand, it's the internet and doesn't matter much, but on the other hand, I would miss aspects of community if it came down to losing them or seeing many users migrate.

Meditation,3byjcw,zenquest,0,Fri Jul 3 07:48:41 2015 UTC,"Drama? It's passionate people expressing their loyalty to what community they created.  They'll come for you sooner or later. Just a question of how soon. You don't get it now, but the system is predicated by its code. Moderators and admins. You won't realize the change until the day you move on, the way you left MySpace and later, Facebook."
Meditation,3byjcw,ajm7,4,Fri Jul 3 14:33:14 2015 UTC,"If all the subs promoted post that exposed the issue and bring it to forefront till it's resolved, I can understand loyalty. If mods shutdown subs as the most powerful thing they are capable of without regard/opinion of subscribed users, it's beyond dissent, it's hostility.  The issue is that there is no natural escalation or warning but raw clash of ego, which makes it drama-tic. You may get what you want but you've also displayed you're willing to have passion override reason to get that."
Meditation,3byjcw,zenquest,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:59:45 2015 UTC,"it's beyond dissent, it's hostility.   That is certainly a view, and one of many. But considering many of us are not well versed in what goes behind the scenes to make reddit what it is, how can we understand the mod's plight, and their decisions?  In this, many won't care: they only want what they come here for, not to help build and create the community. But for those who care it's critical we begin with an important distinction: Management, admins and mods. With admins being under reddit's payroll and mods being unpaid community volunteers. And as I've understood it, based on reading the various opinions of other subreddit's mods and their reasonings for blacking out - it's that this blackout has been long and coming, after changes in management, the last couple of months. That mods, who do in fact make reddit's community a better place - are constantly a secondary thought in actions that are making it increasingly difficult and onerous for them to do what they love. The loss of the now famous, or infamous, Victoria - is that she was a fantastic admin who facilitated the mods volunteer work and management, for most likely commercial reasons, chose to fire her. Granted, the reasoning may not be publicly discussed given the sensitivity of a possibly legal matter, but it stands to reason that Reddit's management could have prepared a replacement for her, to ease the transition phase for mods: they didn't. And this has been seen by many of Reddit's mods as a slap to their faces, in a sign that management does not care for the moderators of various communities. Worse, Victoria volunteered to continue working, and was rejected by management.  Now likewise,  one may use my previous note to argue that we cannot possibly understand the issues admins, and CEO, have for their abrupt decisions. Yet we do have one: the profit motive. Having received seeded funding, Reddit is for profit company, not a cooperative. As such, they may do as they please. However, so may mods.  I've yet to understand more, on what's going on. Between hiking and my work, I've only read up on it while potty/when I can't read a good book. Yet I do love the communities I read and belong to. And while I know reddit will perhaps go the way of Digg, in the past, I am at least glad I expressed my opinions as best I could. It's part of the contribution of discussion we should all be having, i believe, as members of this community-built group."
Meditation,3byjcw,ajm7,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:45:11 2015 UTC,"This is much better thought out and constructive response than others, and appreciate you putting effort into clarifying.  There is no doubt that change was not handled well by admins, and in fact it was a disruption to AMA. While I try and understand mods frustration, I'm not sure going private was the most constructive way to address the issue. At least /r/truereddit tried to check the subscribers pulse before making a decision. Also /r/pics /r/videos /r/funny and few others had over 2 pages of rant posts, and I'm glad it gave me a reason to unsubscribe which I probably should have done ages ago. This was what my original comment was about."
Meditation,3byjcw,zenquest,2,Sat Jul 4 21:59:40 2015 UTC,"Hostility against censorship and politicizing of a forum? You're darned right.  Today they are removing an admin from a sub reddit, AMA, where free discussions took place, instead of a pr pre screened narrative - like those presented on every televised show out there. Perhaps you are ok with scripted discussions and debates taking place, but luckily for all of us, and dare I even say - our species, there are a few willing to question and dissent from the current path management is taking this community towards.  And I do dare say our species. It may be seen a pompous, arrogant, and grandeous, but we all know of the growing influence of redditors: we even see them quoted on tv, with their admittedly cheeky user names. Yet regardless of their appearance, the insight still streams through. As a community, the strongest voices do help shape a message that ultimately reverberates and gets repeated across the globe. It's the true impact technology has fielded, no different than the impact a portable camera allowed a single individual to have.  We are now all free to make up our minds on any matter. We're not beholden to any rights and privileges dispensed to us, as we may now choose what rights and liberties we deserve for ourselves, if given ourselves the chance.  You may say it doesn't matter. That mere bytes and zeros matter only to those blinded by their zeal. But thoughts matter. Passion matters. It's the truth and part of who we all are."

Some people are so narrow minded, and its ridiculous that some subreddit mods took it upon themselves to shut their sub down as a reaction to this.

Meditation,3byjcw,BitBotRobot,-1,Fri Jul 3 17:30:05 2015 UTC,"It happens to people every single day, get over it.   So being glad that it happens to people everyday is ok?  If you ever lose your job doing something that other people appreciate you for, would you want people to be glad for that to have happened?  Only selfish, evil people talk like that.  The kind who are so into themselves that they couldn't care to empathise because ""it happens to everyone"".   Everything happens to everyone, so should we just not react and show emotion anymore?  When people go on strike you think its to stroke their own ego?  You fail to empathise with other people because it seems you think yours is the right way and everyone else is wrong.  Look in the mirror cause your ego is easy to spot.  Todays entitlement generation?  So you put down the ones coming up, yet you lack the understanding to see that the ones who came before them,  meaning you, are the ones who are suppose to set the example.  Yet since you couldn't you feel passing the blame is ok.  Look at yourself before you judge.  You shouldn't speak so foolishly."
Meditation,3c2b9y,holt5301,4,Sat Jul 4 02:40:59 2015 UTC,"Emptiness is not something to talk about and make theories for. This isn't a matter of creating ideologies. Instead, continue to meditate, and once it gets deep enough you will begin to get an idea of what is really meant by emptiness. Everything else is useless imagination and pontification. To really learn, go deeper with how you practice meditation and mindfulness.   Also, the Buddha's teaching isnt a nihilistic one. Buddha didnt teach people to sit and not speak or act. He taught them to observe to gain insight into their minds so they can speak and act from wisdom and not from the defilements."

Your insights will bring you to a place beyond conventional philosophy and beyond such labels as nihilism.   Your insights will even bring you beyond purpose. If you cling to purpose, that will hinder you from truly gaining insight and understanding of the universe around you.  Let it go. Let it all go, even the sense that it is ""good"" or ""bad"" to not have a purpose. Move beyond it."
Meditation,3c2b9y,ego-check,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:00:46 2015 UTC,"Nihilism to me seems like a sense of detachment without a home.  It gives no real sense of ... connection I guess.  It breeds cognitive dissonance just in the act of experiencing.  It's like a refusal to process anything   Let it go. Let it all go, even the sense that it is ""good"" or ""bad"" to not have a purpose. Move beyond it.   What's your interpretation of moving beyond these ideas or emotions?  What does that process look or feel like?"
Meditation,3c2b9y,ego-check,2,Sat Jul 4 05:12:40 2015 UTC,"First off, most hard core nihilist don't exhibit this ""refusal to process anything"", so not sure what you mean by that. Perhaps you are talking about your own personal interpretation of nihilism rather than how it exists in most people that believe in it?  Desire is suffering. Buddhism, not nihilism. You feel nihilism is suffering because you desire there to be something that doesn't exist...  You desire there to be purpose, or meaning, or ""home"", so you see yourself suffering as you detach or realize their non-existence in the present. This is only suffering because you desire those things.  Let them go and you'll see they never existed in the first place, and therefore you aren't ""losing"" anything...  You say ""no connection"", I say ""How can there be any disconnection!?"" When you see your sense of self or individualism is an illusion, then you see you are the universe, and that the mental act of separating yourself from the present is what creates this disconnection that you then feel a need to connect back through. You'll never really be connected until you let go of the notion you were ever separate in the first place.  And that can only happen once you let go of this desire for purpose... for connection. For how can you desire to connect to yourself? The mere act of desiring it creates its own barrier.   What does that process look or feel like?   Self-destruction. Letting go of everything you use to define yourself and all desires and concepts. Answering ""Who Am I?"". Getting to the truth."
Meditation,3c2b9y,Gojeezy,2,Sat Jul 4 08:35:23 2015 UTC,"How can I understand insights and understandings from meditation regarding detachment without becoming nihilistic?   Tranquility and concentration.  Detachment accompanied by tranquility is insight.  Detachment unaccompanied by tranquility is dissociation (the psychological disorder).  Also, it is said in a therevada commentary (sorry can't remember which one) that the basis of insight is dismay and detachment but rest assured that the practitioner will eventually delight in detachment."
Meditation,3c2b9y,HarshaKarpos,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:43:20 2015 UTC,"As we learn about detachment and disidentification, how can we maintain purpose?   Where does purpose come from? From outside? From inside? From things? From goals? From actions?  Emptiness is just a label. Form is emptiness; emptiness is form. There is no such thing as emptiness. Just as there is no such thing as life, nor no such thing as you, nor no such thing as purpose.  There is this."

Meditation,3c2b9y,elphabaloves,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:13:02 2015 UTC,"There is a subtle difference between detachment and non-attachment, but it's important.   Detachment is a defense mechanism that people employ to keep from feeling emotions. It's equated with a cold, callous attitude, and an inability to love and appreciate other people and things.  Non-attachment means not getting caught up in your thoughts, emotions, and urges. This is what we strive for in meditation.  In regard to emptiness, view it as empty of inherent existence.  Everything is a product of causes and conditions. It's a delusion to think that something exists in and of itself unaffected by everything else. Emptiness describes this nature of things arising dependently.  Finally, these aren't things you ""learn"" - you experience them. That's important, because right now you are trying to understand them by thinking more. But these things are beyond thought, which is why we practice daily."

You could choose to be a better person, but that takes work. Why not just choose to make someone else feel like a worse person?  Of course anger is a double ended sword and I'm not advocating for it, but it's not hard to see how people will make time to get angry about things when it provides so much short-term satisfaction."
Meditation,3bzsj8,athenasbranch,5,Fri Jul 3 14:50:30 2015 UTC,"You're right about the sense of community, but I believe it goes deeper than that.  The root of anger is fear. It's the fight half of the fight or flight response that occurs when a threat is detected. When people see a (perceived) threat to their way of life, they want to protect it.  Immigrants, unchaste women, homosexuality, even people liking different music and clothing are common targets of ire because people pine for the ""good ol' days"", whether or not they ever existed in the first place."

Meditation,3bzsj8,EdgarAllenPoeHunter,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:40:35 2015 UTC,"That is a very poignant way to look at it. There seems to be a pretty common-sense way of approaching the world: that we ""feel"" something towards a specific object (hatred towards the chair you stubbed your toe on, love for the pizza you want to eat, disappointment towards a person).  I think it seems a more nuanced way of seeing things to understand that the emotions emerge somewhat ""around"" the object, or, more accurately, that they emerge in your mind (whether they have any credence or not is another story).    Maybe these people don't have anger for an object but an object for their anger?   That reminds me of when people treat others badly who work in customer service. It seems like the personelle might be the source of the anger, but it appears to me that these feelings just kind of ""latch on"" to whoever the person tends to talk to."
Meditation,3bzsj8,macjoven,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:45:33 2015 UTC,"I dig what you're saying, and I'd also say it goes both ways. Sometimes you're mad because you just witnessed an infraction that should be addressed, giving you impulse to address it. And that isn't an impulse that should be trusted, but it's a positive. But I've come to think anger is also a coping mechanism. More specifically, it's my coping mechanism and I'm learning how miserable that makes me. And to handle my misery, I get pissed off. And then I get pissed about the futility of that feedback loop. It's a real mess.  Now, I don't believe my anger is hateful or bigoted like OPs examples, but I think I have something in common with those people. And maybe you and OP do, too. If not, I'm sure we all have toxic coping mechanisms which we have to overcome. Maybe we should learn from OPs examples rather by creating distance by saying we can't understand them or we as meditators have surpassed by these bad habits.

If being afraid of racial injustice is an insecurity, that does not automatically mean people are wrong for having angry emotions appear when dealing with racism online.   When I think of my own over-zealousness towards defending against racism or bigotry online, I was often frustrated and angry because I felt some measure of ""duty"" in ensuring that everyone accepted my ideology -- an ideology I still hold to be one which maximizes personal happiness and minimizes suffering, however annoying it is to encounter.

Meditation,3bzsj8,vawksel,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:54:28 2015 UTC,"Once awakened, you're less likely to hit yourself with a shovel. Getting yelled at doesn't feel scary anymore. Having your child being bullied (it happened to mine), is more ""huh, interesting, my son is beating himself up through another child"".   The logical understanding that you are one with the world doesn't stop anything. It's simply being one, and seeing reality for what it is (a projection made by you alone) that takes away all the ""Scary"" from the dream. It's the actual experience of being dis-identified with the ego, not the logical understanding of such. The roller coaster of humanity doesn't quite have the peaks and valleys it did before, because you see who's making the coaster as each turn comes up.

Meditation,3bzsj8,nootao,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:27:13 2015 UTC,"During the experience of pain, and fear, which I do still get both, I am mindful that it is the experience I WANT to have while having it.   A few weeks ago I was on the roof of my house, and I have a little fear of heights. So, I was clinging to the shingles, catching myself saying over and over ""don't fall, don't fall"", when suddenly I am mindful. Sure, I can still feel the anxiety being generated by my body, but now I am watching it rather than living mindlessly in it. It's a subtle shift to a huge difference in actual experience.  I then began to meditate on the roof, allowing myself to feel scared, and being with it. After some time, enough was enough, and I decided to let my poor ego have a break and climbed back down the ladder.   I think the difference is you don't lack fear, but when you do experience it, you again, know where it's coming from and what it's for, so that in and of itself, makes things less scary. You can actually be curious about fear, and even curious about anger. You can investigate those emotions while they happen instead of being lost in them.  What led me to this perspective? The higher self decided it was time to wake up, it's the only way it happens. The ""permission slips"" my ego gave itself to ""allow"" this to happen were lots of daily meditation mixed with psychedelics  here and there for about 5 years. Note: ANY ""thing"" you do to wake up, e.g. meditation, drugs, etc, is again not real. It's only a permission slip you give yourself to allow yourself to experience your true nature. If we just awoken suddenly without a ""REASON"", then that can be too scary to the ego. We want to wake up slowly and for some reason, often painfully."

You're not talking to each other, not touching, not even seeing each other and yet the connection is so distinct.

If you have well enough develop concentration you will start to get a sense for what concentration feels like. Then you will be able to sustain it with or without an object.   Like, if my focus is on the nostrils, I will simply be focusing on the fact that I can't feel anything around them at that present moment.   Ajahn brahm says doing this is more-so nose awareness rather than breath awareness. I believe he suggests creating a mental concept of the breath and using that concept to focus your mind on. You can still continue to use the sensations of the breath flowing past a certain point but I would maybe pair the two."

When your eyes are closed, the information received by your visual cortex is not so complex, hence it enters a relatively idle processing state. This may perhaps lead to increased mind wandering. If it does, then it would make meditation harder. When eyes are opened the alpha activity is suppressed, this may be correlated with decreased mind wandering.   This is a fairly simplistic hypothesis and there are so many factors which can come into play, which makes giving an absolute answer to your question very hard."

It's like there's a part of me that knows the longer I'm with the breath, the closer I get to the end of me. The more I realize the truth, the easier it becomes to just breathe - after all, breath is always happening.  Ajahn Chah:  Q: You have said that samatha and vipassana or concentration and insight are the same. Could you explain this further?  Answer: It is quite simple. Concentration (samatha) and wisdom (vipassana) work together. First the mind becomes still by holding on to a meditation object. It is quiet only while you are sitting with your eyes closed. This is samatha and eventually this samadhi-base is the cause for wisdom or vipassana to arise. Then the mind is still whether you sit with your eyes closed or walk around in a busy city. It's like this. Once you were a child. Now you are an adult. Are the child and the adult the same person? You can say that they are, or looking at it another way, you can say that they are different. In this way samatha and vipassana could also be looked at as separate. Or it is like food and feces. Food and feces could be called the same and they can be called different. Don't just believe what I say, do your practice and see for yourself. Nothing special is needed. If you examine how concentration and wisdom arise, you will know the truth for yourself. These days many people cling to the words. They call their practice vipassana. Samatha is looked down on. Or they call their practice samatha. It is essential to do samatha before vipassana, they say. All this is silly. Don't bother to think about it in this way. Simply do the practice and you'll see for yourself.  more from interview"

Hint: try to be aware in a single spot in the first 100 hours of meditation. Wether its your breath, your heart, the tip of the nose or the top of your head, let it be the same place for a long extent. Also, ""just be aware"" means to drop your thoughts as much as possible and be empty. It also means not to visualize things, not to meditate on any concept, just witness what you feel in your place of meditation. It is a form of surrendering to what exists inside you. You don't need to add anything else but pure awareness, everything you need is already there. Just collect your consciousness inside, like a stream that accumulates in a lake. When the lake is filled (you passed your 100 hours of single spot awareness) you will have a translation in a different state of consciousness. You just have to keep your awareness open no matter if you experience pain or pleasure, and let it all come to you with equanimity."

Meditation,3by7ze,archermitch,4,Fri Jul 3 23:18:20 2015 UTC,Watch the smoke and see how it moves and changes according to conditioning.  Now watch the mind and see how it moves and changes according to conditioning.  Notice that mindfulness is itself a conditioned mental formation that arises due to conditioning.
Meditation,3by7ze,Singular_Thought,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:06:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's fascinating. I was watching it slope downwards off a shelf & then back upwards when it came to the bed, to cross over! It even seemed to move in speed with the song playing. Aha!"

Meditation,3bzajj,shutupshuttinup,3,Fri Jul 3 10:41:51 2015 UTC,"I'd like to place this response under a general umbrella message of:  You're right to put ""bad"" in quotation marks. You're coming to a place now where you're getting much more instant feedback on the efficacy of your practice. You're able to feel your way out about which is the best method for you.  Now, with this all said:  Generally, meditating on an idea such as ""peace"" or anything else is more of an uphill battle. The mind likes it, the ego likes it for the same reason a dog likes a bone. It's something to chew on, something to do. There's a similar appeal in guided meditations.  Meditation ultimately assists a person in recognizing their existence, their presence outside of thought. Learning to exist in such a way that thought is just simply an aspect of life.  Living in such a way that thought is your main M.O., one tends to become overly wed to their personal story, their struggles, their problems. This is all thought-stuff. This makes life complicated and difficult.  Meditating and discovering the space outside of thought, you are able to directly experience such things as peace, tranquility, serenity and so forth. And you'll inevitably discover the difference between these things as concepts and actually experiencing them.  It's very difficult to experience peace by contemplating the concept of peace.  I think you'll find your practice richer, much more rewarding if you tune your attention into the space in which thought appears. If thought were the actors, then see if you can turn your attention toward the stage.  The difference will be undeniable.  Good luck!"

Meditation,3bz19v,gio_self,2,Fri Jul 3 12:06:34 2015 UTC,"I think I have an idea of what you're asking.  Actually, I'm getting more of a feeling that you don't know what you should be doing about your thoughts, if anything, and if something - for what?  The real objective here is to ""wake up"" out of the stream of thinking, so that you can experience enough of your life outside of thought, that you remember that life and thought aren't the same thing.  Keep bringing your attention into your body, into stillness. Keep recognizing silence. Keep recognizing the arena in which thoughts come and go, the empty space that holds thought. Keep bringing you attention back to NOW, even though your mind may find this moment to be incredibly boring or unfulfilling.  This is how you'll grow in awareness and become more peaceful.  You don't need to do anything in particular with your thoughts. You don't need to fight, sort through, reject, analyze, interpret, or collect them. Just let them come and go. Positive and negative ones. Don't need to turn them into problems or enemies.  Just let them be. Let them come in. When you see a thought appear, just know that the thought is there.  This way, the incessant stream of thoughts that is constantly capturing your awareness will wane, decrease in intensity, and you'll be able to actually live your life more.  Be easy!"
Meditation,3bz19v,zenmonkey87,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:24:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you! This gives me more of an understanding. If don't attach meaning to our thoughts, when are we happy? I mean I'm pretty much always happy, but do our thoughts not make us happy?"
Meditation,3bz19v,zenmonkey87,2,Fri Jul 3 17:48:40 2015 UTC,"Thoughts are just thoughts. One thought could make someone happy, and another person sad.  If you're happy, that's great. But it's not possible to be happy all the time. It's like the weather - sometimes it's rainy, sometimes it's sunny.  One main purpose of meditation is to discover the peace in your own self that remains the same, regardless of what you think or feel.  This is why it's good to discover life outside of thinking."
Meditation,3bz19v,elphabaloves,2,Fri Jul 3 18:00:45 2015 UTC,"You can't not think, so that isn't ""what this is about.""  It's also not about analyzing thoughts or labeling them ""positive"" or ""negative"" - doing those things is simply more thoughts, and more mental gymnastics.   Meditation is cultivating awareness of everything that arises, viewing it non-judgmentally, and learning not to get caught up in it.  It sounds like you could use some instruction to aid your practice - I posted a link to a good guide in this comment."

By thinking I mean any mental process ranging from conceptual thought all the way to bare perception.  1st jhana consists of applied and directed thought (already free of conceptual thoughts)  9th jhana is extinction attainment, which is fruition or the experience of nirvana. There isn't even perception happening on this level."

Meditation,3bxvww,nocensts,2,Fri Jul 3 03:29:43 2015 UTC,I have mental health issues as well as general relaxation issues. Meditation helps me feel like myself and forget my worries. I have come to appreciate its place in my life. I don't advise forcing it on yourself though. I view it as medicine but many believe in its proactive benefits. I'm not one of them.
Meditation,3bxvww,redballooon,2,Fri Jul 3 07:20:08 2015 UTC,"I keep doing it because I notice the positive effects it had on my life. This helps me want doing it in phases where I don't feel much progress.  Be mindful of what happens in your mind when you don't want to sit down. It might reveal something you need to address.   Myself I had phases where I struggled with meditation because I found it very hard to concentrate and exhausting. In the end I was not getting enough sleep. Somehow I knew this all along, but it took some time of being honest about this to myself before I was ready to get into the habit of going to bed earlier."

Meditation,3bxvww,mnemoniker,2,Fri Jul 3 03:20:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, even if I'm having an unproductive session it's like a nap that no one will judge me for taking. Or in the morning it's like sleeping in, but my wife admires me for doing it. If you're not as lazy as I am, you might not identify with this hidden benefit. When I feel like I'm getting away with something, it becomes more addictive.  And then on most days, when the session goes well, I get the psychological boost, too."

I came back a few months later, and started doing 20 minutes via Headspace instead. For whatever reasons, the extra 10 minutes made a significant difference, and made me want to come back for more and stick to the routine.  I'm now at over 3 months of daily meditation using the app, no breaks.   Point is, for me increasing the daily time was very helpful."

Meditation,3bxvww,SavageDark,3,Sun Jul 5 05:46:08 2015 UTC,"Meditation is exercise for the mind.  But unlike physical exercise for the body, meditation needs an everydayness to make it really work.    The reason you don't feel like meditating is your ego-mind wants to do everything possible to retain control of your mind.  Your ego is run by the habitual-thinking analytical mind.  You are running on automatic pilot and don't even know it.  To take control of your mind you need to study it, apply methods, and only then will you reap the rewards...(a disciplined, aware, joyous mind).    It will take awhile for you to understand why you are meditating, but for now (at the beginning) you need to discipline yourself.  Here's a tip: Ask ""what is this?"" - in other words, a thought comes from nowhere, it persists, then fades away... just like the breath."

Your brain is like any other muscle in your body, it requires discipline and consistency. Both of which takes time and everyone is completely different in terms of a learning curve.   I bet you money if you mediated 4 days a week at 20 minutes a day for 6 months, you would effortlessly be pulling some mindful gains.   And I'll let you in on a little secret: it doesn't matter if you fail, it's the act in itself that's the reward, not the results.  Edit: grammar"

Meditation,3bxvww,StonerMeditation,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:50:08 2015 UTC,"it doesn't matter if you fail, it's the act in itself that's the reward, not the results.   That's really the philosophy I've come to myself about a lot of the structural aspects of my everyday life. I spend quite a bit of time learning and practicing new skills (language learning, playing instruments, reading philosophy, going to the gym). I'm aware that these actions are like building a castle in the sand for the sea of death to eventually wash away.   That doesn't really take away the fun and importance of just doing something. I could spend my days living in a cave and that wouldn't be a fundementally, intrinsically less worthwhile existence. That being said, it's at the very least a day-to-day distraction to improve on skills (even if the product of the skills results in nothing eternal or extremely amazing)."
Meditation,3bxvww,Qassud,2,Sat Jul 4 05:35:13 2015 UTC,"I don't like it when people say 'stop thinking' - I don't think that's accurate or even possible, although it's true that thoughts calm down after years of meditation...  The brain is made to think, just like the heart is made to beat.  The goal (even at the beginning) is to let-thoughts-go unimpeded.  In other words, no attachment or clinging to thoughts, which is much more difficult than it sounds.  You want to notice how much control ego-mind (habitual-thinking) has over you, and accept that for years it's been limiting you with false emotions, or even lies ('you are such a fuck-up', etc.).  Be kind to yourself.  If you find that your concentration has moved from the breath, gently bring it back to your breath again.  No big deal...  I go into this stuff in detail in 'Stoner Meditation' (on amazon), but it's not a book for everybody.  If you can't afford it however, PM me with an email address and I'll send a free copy.  EDIT: I should mention that 'stopping thoughts' is a valid technique, and taught by very respected schools (Vipassana, Zen)... however, I personally don't find it a workable method."

Meditation,3bxvww,basado,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:21:36 2015 UTC,"I started using Headspace in about April last year. Did it for a couple of days, but then felt like you and stopped. More of my friends were telling me how much it helped them, so I started again. I committed to doing 20 mins a day. I realized that they count how many days in a row you do, and give you a month free code at certain spots. I had friends wanting to try it, so that motivated me to get the code for them. I'm now at around day 45 and need it every day. I found the Foundation series really quite boring, but when you get through them, you can move into some really cool exercises. My favorite one right now is the Self Esteem series.  You may want to try doing it just before you go to bed. It's a nice way to wind down, and I found my sleep got much better when doing it."

I meditate to try and figure out what I really am, but that's my urge. Others seem to get 'on the path' for other reasons - if you're looking for motivation, i'd say really look into what your motives are and maybe that will help.  I will also say that once you've practiced enough to see the benefits (which can vary greatly depending on the person, but make no mistake - right practice will lead to results), those benefits will make it much easier to continue to practice"

Meditation,3bxvww,KilluaKanmuru,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:58:21 2015 UTC,"Are you stressed in your life?   Stress can make it more difficult to meditate, and really mess with your routine.    That's why the sages advise the yogi / meditator to lead a pure life.    However exercise can mitigate stress -- that's why yoga was invented, to calm the body and mind for deep meditation.    In the face of a restless mind and body (which you are experiencing -- that is the obstacle to enjoying meditation) I would say limit your meditations to 5 minutes at a time, and do them at least twice a day (morning and evening).    Before beginning your meditations, a yoga class would be best, but at least take a nice walk, preferably in nature if you can.   The breathing and movement will help to energize and balance your nerve energies for deeper more enjoyable meditation.    As time goes on, you will find this time in meditation to be very enjoyable and rewarding, and you will want to lengthen in.   However in the beginning just use a timer or the insight meditation app or something so you can let go of thoughts about time and immerse yourself in your efforts."

I read in one of my beginners meditation books (might have been mindfulness in plain english or what is meditation) that you should imagine there is a balloon at the top back of your skull gently pulling your neck and spine up. Try ""pulling"" your spine up from the back of your head while using the bare minimum amount of muscle required to do so.  If it still hurts then dont sweat it do whats comfortable. Just try not to slouch because it will make you lethargic and meditation is about being aware not asleep."

If you're just sitting on the floor in some form of lotus position, I've noticed at least for me, my lower back will eventually start to bend and become painful. Making sure your hips are above your knees with a cushion kind of fixes that; I guess it puts your body into a more ergonomic position. I feel like as long as I'm balanced and my knees aren't lifting off the floor or swaying, my back will kind of fall into the proper upright curve it should be. Feels good actually when I do it right."

Meditation,3bxnv6,luthis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:06:57 2015 UTC,"The juxtaposition of ""rigid"" and ""upright"" in your post is telling. Don't assume that upright means rigid. Sitting posture doesn't have to be rigid, but it should be upright — upright in body and mind. The body supports and reflects the mind; the mind supports, reflects, and guides the body.  For example, if you slouch in your body, it will encourage your mind to be lax, dull, and defeatist. If you rely on a back support, your mind may not be trained as well in independence.  You are a living symbol, an expression of your inner life. But when starting meditation, the mind is not stable; it flits here and there, habitually attaching to objects and playing out old patterns of reaction. Therefore we use the body as well as the meditation method to help bring the mind the mind to stability. Noble, open, calm, stable, awake and aware posture gives constant signals to the mind. Then soon you can identify your original mind, which has those qualities, and you can rest in it.  Rigidity, then, has these two aspects: physical and mental.  The physical needs to be addressed by forming a very stable base — getting the butt and knees solidly on the sitting platform(s), with the help of folded blankets or firm cushions where necessary (and it's usually necessary) under the hips, perhaps under one or both knees, perhaps even under the hands and forearms to keep the shoulders from bearing their weight. The physical is also addressed by taking account of the inflexibilities and imbalances that lead to tension. It takes some learning, and likely takes some applied practice outside of meditation time to increase core support and joint tone and flexibility. Tone and flexibility must be trained together, because flexibility without some firmness can lead to injury and anyway doesn't provide enough support for comfort.  The mental aspect is addressed primarily by correcting the motivation and approach. Why are you meditating? What are you trying to achieve? If meditation is only 'for me', it will have what Zen Master Shunryu Suzuki called ""a gaining idea"". You will be in one place, and the thing you imagine you need to get will be in another place, and you will make effort to try and get that thing. Already that is tension. Already that is illusion. If you repeat it, perhaps making greater effort, you drive tension and illusion deep into your practice and into your being.  The correct approach is openhanded. No gaining idea. Don't want or make anything; only follow the method. Don't try to push away certain thoughts or experiences. Don't try to attain or hold certain thoughts or experiences. Don't attach to good or bad feeling. Don't check and judge your situation, your condition, or your relationship. Only put it all down.  This put-it-all-down mind is your original mind, which is always spacious and serene and comfortable. You don't get it by trying to get it. You already have it; you already are it. You just have to put down everything else that has built up on top of it, all those assumptions and attachments and habits that get in the way of your natural relaxation.  Both physical and mental aspects are important. They support each other. Ultimately, they are the same. Within deep meditation, there is no separation between body and mind; there is no separation between world and mind. Mind is everything, and there is no 'thing' called mind. Your original still and open awareness is an experience, a living reality rather than a concept.  ~  Picture mind and body as a graceful mountain, like Mount Fuji. The base is utterly stable, unmovable. A stable base allows comfort above. The top of the mountain rises — almost wafts — upward. Solid, stable base, top opening or wafting up and out. The bodymind should be like this in meditation.  Notice also how the solidity of a mountain comes from its settling. A mountain has no agenda. It has settled on itself, found its ground, found its arrangement of least resistance. Anything precarious sinks down to its most stable place. It is like Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching says, or like Jesus says in the Bible: the high shall be brought low, and the low shall be uplifted. If you make an effort to hold onto a certain form in your body or mind, it will eventually be broken down by exhaustion or circumstances. But if you settle into the ground, with humility and sincerity, the relaxation will uplift your body and the open sincerity will uplift your mind.  ~  My previous post from another thread, in its entirety:   A healthy back is not straight, but gracefully curved. Returning to the natural curve of the back is not a matter of forcing, but of undoing set patterns of use. There is a spectrum of modalities, from forceful hands-on, like Structural Integration and some Chiropractic... to very gentle hands-on, like Osteopathy or Craniosacral Therapy... to vigorous hands-off, like various Yoga forms (Hatha Yoga, Restorative Yoga, etc.)... to gentle hands-off (awareness based), like Feldenkreis or Alexander Technique. I've heard that many meditators have had good success with Alexander Technique. Some forms of standing meditation also help you find your own structural integrity. Zhan Zhuang, for instance (from Qigong and Internal Martial Arts) helps you develop sensitivity to the tensions you hold and the energy blockages that manifest because of them.  Part of the issue is relaxing or even stretching physical structures that have become bound up. Heat and stretching regimens can be effective. It has also been proposed that a minute or so of hanging from a chin-up bar can counteract hours of improper sitting in a chair. But many curative techniques have to do with a relaxed return to neutrality or balance; so for example, just lying down (face up) on a firm flat surface can help the spine return to its proper form. Using a bolster or folded towel or blanket under the mid-back, you can lie with your arms spread wide; the chest opens, and the 'hump' in the middle of the back is stretched and relaxed. There are many poses in Restorative Yoga that can help the body rediscover its integrity: some degree of stretching may be included, but the main point is dropping the types of movements that have been harmful, by finding postures that support the body enough for it to relax.  Without a particularly strong core and legs flexible enough to provide a very stable base when sitting on a mat, it's difficult for most people to relax completely in sitting posture. So postural work should be done in addition to meditation (i.e., outside of meditation period). This work may involve lying down, or other supported postures, so the body can completely relax and you can start to listen deeply to its natural setup. I'd suggest you check out Alexander Technique, Yoga Therapy, and perhaps Zhan Zhuang for starters, to see of any of them are a good fit for you.   ~  Here is my recent post with many links on many aspects of sitting posture."

Meditation,3by16g,Palladium106,3,Fri Jul 3 02:30:34 2015 UTC,"I know this can be hard at first but my advice is to pick a technique and stick with it.  I stick with buddhist mindfulness meditation because that is what I know and it has worked for me.  Mindfulness of breathing:   Focus on the breath.   A. Pick either a physical sensations (e.g: the rise and fall of the abdomen, the breath passing through the nose, the breath passing the tip of the nose, etc... ), a mental concept (""in"" and ""out"", or a point in space that the breath passes, or the process of the rising and falling of the abdomen, etc... ) or both. The mind will begin to wander. When you notice it has (a moment of mindfulness) return focus to the breath. Rinse and repeat.   Feel free to ask any questions about it. There is also a sutta (anapanasati sutta) that breaks down mindfulness of breathing into tetrads.    What are the main skills/habits/experiences that could benefit an exploration of meditation?    Mindfulness of breathing will give you enough concentration and mindfulness for insight to arise. Then, when impermanence manifests during the insight stage of A&P you can use impermanence as your object of focus/anchor for continuing to develop insight. Even then, it is still the same basic technique . . . just with broader, more diffuse attention (impermanence manifests in the entire field of one or all senses); this could be technically wrong but I understand impermanence arises as a matter of heightened perception rather than as any individual sense. It just is more readily observable in certain senses depending on the individual, e.g, as the tactile sensation called ""piti"" or the visual sensation that resembles visual snow.  Aside from all that, look up the rules for monks. You probably won't find better advice than to follow their rules as closely as possible.   My own thoughts are tending towards establishing a strong familiarity with breath, good posture and sitting habit   I don't worry too much about posture (just make sure I can get good, diaphragmatic breaths) and even less about sitting habits. With that said, maybe it is because I have established a fairly good habit with them. I do sit in full lotus for the first 30 minutes of each meditation but then it becomes painful and I am better off flexing my knees a bit and continuing in any posture that is comfortable.    And any good resources online or offline?   For Therevada Buddhist canon check out Access to Insight  Also, there are quite a few monks (from all lineages) who have videos on youtube."

A lot meditators get lost in too great a wealth of information, it becomes too complicated, stops being helpful.  Your best bet is to just chose a single practice, keep it simple, and only solicit help when you must, when you feel absolutely lost.  The sooner you can begin to rely on your own internal sense of wisdom, of what's effective and what's ineffective, the better.

Meditation,3bvw2x,kaliyo,8,Thu Jul 2 16:07:18 2015 UTC,"Meditation has been shown to help process trauma. Trauma is not just visual flashbacks, it is emotional flashbacks as well. What you are describing sounds very similar to my experience too. I am new to meditation, and I have experienced exactly what you are describing. Meditation helps with trauma processing, and is known to release memories.   This is because meditation slows down the amygdala, which generally helps to keep memories suppressed in the hippocampus. At the same time, meditation revs up the hippocampus and the thalamus - two areas of the brain responsible for holding and processing memories. In other words, meditation causes the perfect conditions for memories to be released. These memories are visual, olfactory, tactile, auditory, even by taste, and especially, emotional. If they were memories from trauma (such as child abuse) then the thalamus never processed them, so during meditation, it has an opportunity to do so thanks to the calming of the amygdala and the revving up of the hippocampus.  I don't know if it helps you to have this explanation for it. But you asked if it is normal - and not only is it normal, it is a major reason mental health care professionals recommend their clients meditate. It helps to process trauma very effectively. It's the reason I got serious about meditation."

Meditation,3bvw2x,OrbitRock,4,Fri Jul 3 03:49:34 2015 UTC,"The thing is that you can't say ""it was meditation that did this"". No, it was you. Meditation may have helped you be more open to the experience, and helped you allow it to happen. But ultimately, it's your own mind, memories, feelings, and experiences that cause this.     And that's not a bad thing. If we have trauma, we should allow ourselves to experience it when it comes on. But I wouldn't begin to associate meditation with trauma-release. There's a reason it is said so much in Buddhism, ""don't attach to this experience, don't attach to that experience"". Let this experience go. Don't become too overly invested in it.   At the same time also acknowledge that you do have trauma in you. Be kind to yourself, and do what you can to work on the healing process. It is good to be open to our emotions, and also at the same time you shouldn't let your emotions overrun you in your daily life. There's a good balance to be struck there, between being open to these, and setting it aside and moving on with life."

Meditation,3bvwu4,iamruben2,19,Thu Jul 2 16:12:56 2015 UTC,"That's a great question, and one I wondered about for a while too. The way I see it is kinda like this:  There's a story of a monk in a cave (Milarepa? one of those dudes, I forget), and these big nasty slobbery demons come and try to scare the heck out of him. But he just calmly offers them a seat and a cup of tea, and goes about his business tending the fire, washing his dishes. They eventually get bored and take off. (Please note, this is highly paraphrased by me, for illustration purposes.)  When you meditate and these big scary thoughts try to come into your cave, you can just let them be there without putting your attention on them. They might keep getting in your face over and over for a little while, but just let them. It's very important to relax any tension, as that is part of how you engage with thoughts -- by tensing your mind and body. So, whenever you notice thoughts tangling with your mind, relax and return to your anchor.  The other side of this, which I would think of as suppression, would be like if you shut the cave door. No thoughts allowed in here! This can be done by focusing your attention really strongly on the anchor/breath. This leads to more tension, and the kind of stuff that makes people go crazy on 10-day vipassana retreats. What you want is to have an open awareness, gently keeping your attention on your anchor. This way you can start to see when the thoughts are coming up, and you (eventually) learn about the process of how thoughts come up. When you see that process over and over, you start to develop dispassion for them (i.e. you see that they're not YOURS, they're just these THINGS, so what's the big deal, shrug!)...  Got it?  :-)"
Meditation,3bvwu4,Dispassionfruit,6,Thu Jul 2 16:42:41 2015 UTC,"This was a great answer. Along similar lines, how I see it is as follows. Your focus on breath should be soft, and to a small degree you are still experiencing the negative thought. The focus on breath is there to enable you to see that you are not your thoughts, but rather the observer of thoughts."
Meditation,3bvwu4,MerchantR,3,Thu Jul 2 18:53:34 2015 UTC,"There's a story of a monk in a cave (Milarepa? one of those dudes, I forget), and these big nasty slobbery demons come and try to scare the heck out of him. But he just calmly offers them a seat and a cup of tea, and goes about his business tending the fire, washing his dishes. They eventually get bored and take off.   Rumi's poem The Guest House makes the same point:   This being human is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival.  A joy, a depression, a meanness, some momentary awareness comes As an unexpected visitor.  Welcome and entertain them all! Even if they're a crowd of sorrows, who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, still treat each guest honorably. He may be clearing you out for some new delight.  The dark thought, the shame, the malice, meet them at the door laughing, and invite them in.  Be grateful for whoever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from beyond."

Meditation,3bvwu4,emerty,3,Thu Jul 2 16:51:25 2015 UTC,"One thing that helped me end my 35 year struggle against anxiety was from a random person on here. They said 'You are not your thoughts, you are the one that hears them'  I ran that thought around in my head for a good six months before it really sank in. Once that did, I realised, in a lovely scary moment, that scary thoughts make me feel scared and conversely kind thoughts make me feel better. I kept up the practice and began to notice something - By returning to the breath every time a scary thought occurred, I found a calm state of mind.   This was like an oasis. When I was scared, it felt like a mirage, but everytime I focused on the breath, within a couple of minutes I could find this calm state. Over time this calm state has grown, and grown, and I'm guessing, after recently meeting a man who has followed the buddhist traditions for 42 years, that it keeps on giving.  Keep on sitting, maybe try some mindful yoga or qigong, it really helped me.   Oh, and metta. Try that."

No, it's there - it exists, and it's doing its thing. You, however, aren't caught up in it - you are doing something else.  You have three choices when it comes to thoughts: (1) suppress them, (2) indulge in them, or (3) let them be as they are, independent from you and your attention. The third choice is what you do when you meditate."

Meditation,3bvwu4,LarryBills,3,Fri Jul 3 01:30:40 2015 UTC,"My take; nowhere near an expert:  You bring the breath in, to remind yourself that you are not that thought or anxiety. This allows you to then explore the anxiety, without it taking over and you becoming unaware of the moment.  The idea is not to replace the initial thought with the breath, but to focus on the thought or anxiety itself - how does it feel physically? How does it effect your emotions? Can you identify the ""edges"" of the thought?  Look up the 3 minute breathing space by Kabat-Zinn for a much better explanation."
Meditation,3bvwu4,elphabaloves,2,Thu Jul 2 16:40:56 2015 UTC,"When you have a thought you simply notice that there is a thought and return to your breathing. You do not get caught up in the thought and follow it with more thinking/analysis. (This includes whether it is good, bad, loopy, weird, old, new, exciting, etc. You impassively note 'thinking' and return to your breathing.)   When you go back to the breath, that thought may still be 'there' but you've noted it and are back doing your thing.   It's like if you are reading a book and a car stops in front of your house playing loud music. You would 'notice' the car/music and go back to your book.  You shouldn't start a dialog with yourself about how it's your neighbor xyz, who is always disrespectful to others, or , hey! you actually like that song - when was the last time I heard it? Oh! it at that party last summer when you took a drive with that friend and....  See? The music/car is there. You've noted it. You go back to reading. From time to time that music may intrude again on your activity but it will often recede from your focus.    The active noting of the thought will take away a good deal of it's power. This is the initial step taught in most CBT dealing with anxiety.   Cheers!"

Meditation,3bvwu4,SamuelColeridgeValet,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:39:05 2015 UTC,"Let me answer this a different way. Single pointed meditation means keeping the object of meditation in the mind without any movement. The moment you realize you are thinking of something else, you immediately shift your attention back to the object. So in a sense this is suppression of thoughts.  Then there is the other form of meditation, where you cultivate the no mind, where you can watch your thoughts flow without attaching to them or as is said, in a non-judgmental manner. However, this no mind does not come overnight. It may seem contradictory but to get there you have to become skilled in single pointed meditation. Think about it for a while and see if you can figure out why this is so.  So single pointed meditation is important. Later as you gain more experience as a result of the practice, you can begin cultivating a softer awareness. I would value other insights/experiences on this."
Meditation,3bvwu4,TheCleansingFlame,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:01:12 2015 UTC,"If you acknowledge the thought, it does not sound like suppression, because you've acknowledged it. Focusing on your breath is not as much suppression, it is bringing the focus to your body and how you feel.  With strong emotions such as anxiety, the reason people, like myself, get stuck in a thought pattern, is because the left-brain is trying to dissociate from the discomfort of the feeling of the anxiety in your body.  For example, OCD behavior is a way for the left brain to distract a person from the uncomfortable feeling of anxiety in the body by obsessing over certain thoughts, or rituals, and then compulsively engaging in those rituals. By focusing on OCD type behaviors, like turning a stove off and on twenty seven times, or being so perfectionistic about a report that you've checked it for spelling errors fifty times already and are still obsessing about the spelling, you distract your mind from the feelings of discomfort in your body.  By focusing on your breath, you force your attention onto your body. I would not suggest fighting your left brain by arguing about your thoughts. For example, when you are focusing on your breath, do not be thinking: ""Stop thinking this thought. Dammit I just thought it again. Stop thinking this thought. Dammit brain stop it!"" If your brain wants to think on the thought, you let it think. But you make sure to focus on your breath, because that puts you in your body and you feel the discomfort.  Over a long time of many repetitions, this trains the brain to become accustomed to and tolerate the discomfort of anxiety in the body. Breathing can change this discomfort far more than thoughts can. Over time the left brain relaxes a bit, because it does not have to protect you from feeling the anxiety by running around and around with thoughts. Over time, it can just be and slow down, because then it knows you can tolerate the feeling of anxiety, and you can ameliorate the feeling yourself with your breath. Then the thoughts slowly relax. Fighting the thoughts is completely counter-productive - because that is more left brain action, not less. If you get mad at your thoughts and thought-argue in your head, you rev up your left brain distractive mechanism. The anxious thoughts absolutely love it when you argue with them and try to suppress them and try to change them, because that feeds the anxious thoughts and gives them more energy to keep distracting you. So don't fight your thoughts with thoughts.  It takes a long time, and a lot of repetition."
Meditation,3bvwu4,Persiankobra,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:11:07 2015 UTC,"Remember what ""negative thought"" means.  It doesn't just mean a thought you don't like.  You call a thought negative if it's serving no purpose, bothering you for no good reason.  It might be worrying about some little mistake you made twenty years ago or an idea that's just plain false, like worrying about something that can't happen.  A negative thought by definition is a thought you should let go of."
Meditation,3bvwu4,CleanAndRebuild,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:27:17 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of great answers, but I'll add that suppression isn't that bad. See, I imagine my mind chatter as a monkey that keeps entertaining itself(I watch him as the watcher), sometimes I have important work to do so I tell the monkey to stop for a moment, I'll give it space to be a little later. To achieve this you need a good relationship with your monkey. So I wouldn't say that there's a right time to suppress your thoughts, but more-so a right way. Once I've ""suppressed"" him, I'll give space to my inner ox.  This all sounds funny when written down, but I'd like to think that making this practice fun and enjoyable is always welcome. I'll often smile for no reason when I think of my monkey's chatter and that brings warmth to my chest as well as a degree of compassion for my minds unrelenting ability to bring shit up(seriously, I could write a few novels every week). Remember to leave your thoughts to be what they are. When I say that I tell my monkey to stop I have my subtle and gentle way of toning it down, it's a mutual understanding that doesn't feel forced.  Finally, the word ""suppression"" is a little hard, it's just a word that I don't take seriously, but if you have an anxiety disorder you might want to go for a smoother term."
Meditation,3bwgzj,dizson,3,Thu Jul 2 18:45:17 2015 UTC,"So, diaphragm-breathing refers to the primary muscle being used - the diaphragm, in this case - as opposed to chest-breathing which primarily uses the rib intercostals.  Relaxation is more important than 'holding still', and in fact trying to force certain body-parts to remain immobile (e.g. the chest) may in fact increase tension.  So, having taken a stable posture, begin breathing in and out at a natural, gentle pace by using the diaphragm; a deep inhale will first feel like something is pushing down on the intestines, and one should gently allow the belly to expand in order to give the intestines a place to go.  Additionally, the lower-back will feel the 'back' of this diaphragm motion (and remember that going to full lung capacity is counter-productive; natural breathing is best, once you've re-trained yourself to breath this way).  With chest-breathing, the rib intercostals are the first to engage, which often means that the chest or shoulders move up/around & that there's general muscle tension throughout the upper body during a breath cycle.  The overall goal, basically, is to hang the muscles on the skeleton like ornaments on a xmas tree, using mostly/only the diaphragm to breathe."

A little different that what people do with mindfulness meditation (or other meditations), as was mentioned above. With those you are cultivating a silent awareness of what arises in your experience, be it thought or whatever.     With what you are doing you are consciously using your mind and applying it towards something. So your getting similar mental benefits of a) focus, and b) quieting down any discursive thought. But there are also some different things being exercised in meditation that is not being exercised here with directed thinking."
Meditation,3bwlpg,TastyPruno,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:03:16 2015 UTC,"I was just wondering because when I think about one subject for a long period of time my mind feels more focused and clear.   You can cultivate mindfulness in any circumstance. Meditation is just a practice that is, for most people, generally more conducive to doing that.  So critical thinking could help you be more aware of what is passing through your mind, if it involves perceptually checking what you're experiencing. Questioning with the aim of answering with a perceptual check rather than another intellectual idea is another type of spiritual practice that some teachers call self-inquiry.  A potential problem with critical thinking as a way to cultivate mindfulness is that you could get lost in the story created by the thinking, and therefore stop paying attention to what you're ideas actually relate to, to what you're actually experiencing. As Anthony de Mello puts it, 'The first time the child sees that fluffy, alive, moving object, and you say to him, ""Sparrow,"" then tomorrow when the child sees another fluffy, moving object similar to it he says, ""Oh, sparrows.  I've seen sparrows.  I'm bored by sparrows.""' The child attends to their idea of the sparrow, and therefore sees their concept rather than the tangible perception of the sparrow. They see the sparrow, the sight of the sparrow is in their minds, but yet they don't see it, they don't attend to that sight.  You might ostensibly be reaching correct conclusions during critical thinking, but if these intellectual conclusions don't involve paying attention to what you're actually experiencing as you think -- sights, sounds, thoughts, feelings, etc. -- then that critical thinking is divorcing you from reality and isn't cultivating mindfulness."
Meditation,3bwlpg,aryabrah,2,Sat Jul 4 08:37:00 2015 UTC,"No, that is simple introspection/contemplation. There is a type of meditation where introspection is discussed. What is meant is that after one has left a period of deep concentration, there is a post-concentration state of enhanced focus that can be used for insight. But this is still different than what you are discussing. It can be helpful for laying the foundation, however, which can eventually lead to better/genuine meditation sessions."
Meditation,3bwlpg,Orvy,2,Thu Jul 2 21:25:29 2015 UTC,"I think there's two main stages to meditation (as far as I interpret it from the teachings of Sattipathana)  The first, and hardest step, is to completely let go of your usual style of thinking and experiencing mind's attention. Completely relaxing all the tension in your body and being fully aware of your breath and clearing your mind.  Once you are able to do this then you can work on one-pointedness, which I think is the launching pad for many incredible realizations. This is of course easier said then done, don't mistake any temporary state of relaxation for one-pointedness, it's an incredibly hard place to reach.  Once you can feel absolutely centered and relaxed, your mind begins to become clear and focussed, interrupting thoughts come very rarely (maybe one every few minutes), and when they do come, you can let go of it very quickly. The best way I can describe this stage is ""darkness"", even the darkness behind your eyelids seems clearer.  Then you can begin to focus on your object of meditation, and if you so desire, that can be any critical question you might have. The difference now is that your mind is completely centered on the question at hand.  This object can be anything you want, in Tibetan Buddhist traditions, some prefer to focus on feelings of compassion, tranquillity, and love. Others prefer to think of colors or visual objects called kasina, the Buddha himself puts a lot of emphasis on visualizing and thinking about death and decaying corpses. Here's a few more of these objects..  This doesn't mean you only have to think about those things, but they are the most spiritually beneficial. I personally find it extremely beneficial to sometimes reach one-pointedness and then begin studying or working while maintaining that focus."

Even the feeling of everything is going wrong or I'm doing the exact opposite of what I'm instructed to do, that very feeling can also be observed and let go of. Adyashanti had a good way approaching meditation in my opinion. He said that you can approach it like a question, ""what happens if I let everything be exactly how it is?"". Not like an intellectual thing to ponder but as an approach to whats before you. Doesn't matter if your mind is chaotic, or whatever goes on. Just let everything be exactly how it is and eventually you'll see that theres a part of you that's unaffected by all of it.

Meditation,3bv9a0,Redfo,3,Thu Jul 2 13:47:51 2015 UTC,"If you conceive of yourself in one place, struggling against your thoughts in another place, you are creating a division that doesn't originally exist. Thus you are creating the schism, the anxiety, yourself by opposing one part of the mind with another part.  The key in the meditative approach is in what you identify with. Identify yourself as the Witness of all thoughts, visions, senses, emotions, events, and experiences. You are not your body. You are not your thoughts. Merely witness.  The more you do the practice of witnessing, the more easily you will move into the role of the Witness. This will calm anxiety, as you will experience directly that the Witness is constant, stable, open, aware, and never disturbed by any appearances.  Your original Witness mind is like the sky: open and clear. Anything can appear in it freely, but the space of the sky is not marked or harmed in any way. Likewise, anything can appear in your awareness, but the awareness itself is continuously open and unmarked, unmoved by what appears.  If you identify with thoughts, you will label some as wanted and some as unwanted, some as good and some as bad. You will try to grasp the wanted and avoid the unwanted. So you will be moved around by appearances. This is agitation; this is anxiety.   The mind that attaches to appearances is very anxious. It is especially anxious about letting go and resting. Because it thinks of itself as just another appearance, just another form, it sees its death in resting. ""If I become the sky, I will die!"" This anxiety doesn't come from your original sky-like nature, but from your attachment to appearance.  Therefore, if you stop identifying with appearances and instead identify as the sky-like Witness, you can rest in your original nature and no appearances — no thoughts or events of any kind — will disturb or harm you.  So what is the approach? 'Sky-like' means completely open and ungrasping. Only watch; only perceive. No need to hold any sense of ""I am doing this practice"". Even that is another appearance. Merely perceive all appearances.  The sky-like Witness is also very still and stable. Find a posture that will allow you to remain comfortably still and awake, your body taking on the quality of the still and awake sky-like mind.  If you need further guidance on the approach, go gaze at the sky. Understand its constant and open quality; take it in. Then keep that Witness mind. That is what you really are.  Soon, appearance and Witness will merge. From the beginning they were not separate, but thinking made them seem separate. When subject and object come together, that is awakening. No need to strive for it. Only do the sky-like Witness practice."

Meditation,3bv9a0,marzipanzebra,2,Thu Jul 2 14:33:26 2015 UTC,"See. Hear. Smell. Taste. Feel. Perceive thought.  You want to understand it before you try it. That's not how it works. You have to try it, and then little by little you get the understanding.  First, maybe go out and gaze at the sky. Take a half hour or longer, and look up at the sky. It will do its thing on you, you don't need to do anything special. Just be willing to let some of that openness in.  Later you can sit still in a comfortable but awake posture, and witness. The attached mind will jump here and there from one object to the next, from thought to sound to object of sight back to thought.... Each time, bring it back to just witnessing. Your mind already sees everything. There is an aspect of it that doesn't go chasing anything, but just experiences it. So come closer to that aspect and be it. Be the one who is reading this right now. Be the one who hears the sounds that appear and change and disappear right now. Be the still and open one. It is already what you really are, you just need to keep admitting it and being it."
Meditation,3bv9a0,OmYogi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:54:14 2015 UTC,"I have always struggled with this idea is ""what should I do?"" In meditation and spiritual ""work"", as well as in social situations and in life... Since I was a kid I felt like everyone else had gotten some kind of manual that I didn't get. I desire specific instructions and in doing so I think I am limiting my ability to figure things out for myself. I have realized that this view is wrong and I am slowly letting go of it...  You should stop worrying about what to do and concern yourself with being aware of what is happening now, and simply being open to the natural flow of things. With practice, eventually I noticed that I was resisting the natural flow, being tense and anxious as my normal state.  Letting go of resistance, for me has been a key aspect to making progress. Tai Chi, therapy, and psychedelics have been instrumental in teaching me that resistance is futile. Along with mantra meditation. I hope this helps... Good luck."

Meditation,3bwz3i,relljr,2,Thu Jul 2 21:00:21 2015 UTC,Sounds like momentary concentration or access concentration. I would be hesitant to call it access concentration though if you can only sustain it for a minute. Maybe very weak access concentration.  All this really means is that you are starting to be able to sustain your concentration. The longer you can sustain it the stronger the feelings of bliss (rapture and happiness) will become.

Meditation,3bwam4,onetwothreex,3,Thu Jul 2 17:59:06 2015 UTC,"I think meditation can help you.   You have a lot of self hatred going on. And, in a way it's justifiable to be experiencing this self criticism for the suffering you have caused in the past. But in another way, it is not helpful. Beyond recognizing the nature of your wrongs, these thoughts will not help you move on, or atone for what you've done.   I know that, at least in my own experience, meditation has helped me experience things more deeply and fully. There is a certain type of experience, where you can allow yourself to just silently be with suffering, without criticising yourself or immediately shutting down the experience. Whether it is the suffering you have caused, or the suffering you have experienced, or both. There is something powerful about that.      You shouldn't try to take my words and make yourself experience what I talk about. But if you begin a practice of sincerely and wholeheartedly opening up to what you have experienced and what you have done, I think it might help you through this.      The track of self-criticising and automatic thinking can be slowly put to rest too. Ultimately its of no use for you. Thinking about these things in this way will serve no purpose but to make you more stressed. Change comes from deep experiencing, not surface level thinking. Do you deserve to feel happiness? Yes. Yes you do. The more you are happy, the more good you can do and make others happy too. You want to know how you can make up for what you have done in the past? Help other people, sincerely. But first you have to become able to help and do good and spread happiness. How do you do that? By allowing yourself to be happy also. Nobody in the world deserves love and happiness as much as you."
Meditation,3bwam4,OrbitRock,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:44:28 2015 UTC,"Hey man. We've all done bad stuff before. You do deserve to feel ok about yourself. Guilt is natural, and part of karma, but you don't have to believe the thoughts that you deserve this-and-that pain or suffering because of it. Those thoughts are mental habits that take a while to reverse.   I'm glad you're in counseling. Have you tried different counselors? I know I had to shop around a little to find a good one that clicked with me.   Have you heard of forgiveness meditation? You basically sit, relax your body as much as possible, and every thought that comes up, you try to cultivate a forgiving attitude towards it. If it's about someone else, say in your mind ""I forgive you for not understanding."" If it's about yourself, think ""I forgive myself for not understanding."" (or you can substitute something else for ""not understanding,"" but that one tends to cover most everything.) Just keep doing that. If it feels nice, that's good -- you do deserve that. You'll probably eventually notice a warm fuzzy feeling if you're doing it right.. Keep that going!"
Meditation,3bwam4,Dispassionfruit,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:13:21 2015 UTC,tnx for the reply man.  I really do want to forgive myself. but sometimes it feels like its impossible.  I mean how could one live with himself when knowing you did such things in the past?  the other way that i look at it is that back then i was driven by my ego. i had less sense of hoe my actions could hurt other living beings.  but ever since the awakening off my own self. i now understand  some of my actions were bad.  The problem now is. everytime i hear or see something that resonates from my past actions like: seeing someone cheating on tv. or hearing about it. or the pictures of my past away dog in my book shelf.  everytime i see or hear those things i feel very depressed and filled with remorse and pain.  I cannot function anymore at that moment. At such a momet its al about surviving the inner suffering.
Meditation,3bwam4,Dispassionfruit,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:20:20 2015 UTC,"I hear you. I've definitely been in places where it feels impossible to get out of certain mental situations. But you have to start somewhere. You know you have good in you, right? Or else you wouldn't know that you've done some wrong things, and you wouldn't be writing this stuff here.   If you try the forgiveness meditation thing, it's ok if you're just mentally saying the words at first. Fake it til you make it. The self-criticism will keep coming at you, but you just keep countering it with forgiveness. Let it be ok that you did that stuff, that your parents did that stuff. As my meditation teacher says, ""it HAS to be ok, because it's the truth."" So let it be ok -- you're responsible for turning things around, and here's where you start, by starting new mental habits."

First start rebuilding and bringing positivity back into your subconscoius. Hypnosis helps to reach deeper into you so that things can be steadier and then you can have a chance at being able to start some momentum meditating. Positive afirmations or mantras during meditation also.

While your in groups counseling they don't do individual counseling because they could interfere with each other.  The fact is. i never talked about the dog subject yet in the group or individually. Because some people in the group have dogs to. And i think i am just to scared to anger them with my past mistake's.  There is some kind of trust in the group, and we have shared a lot of personal issues with each other. But this subject just goes a bit to far for me.  I am afraid people will see me as a animal abuser. which i really am not. But i know people could think i am.  Everytime i hear stuff about animal cruelty i feel so bad, i get so angry at people who do that. but at the same time i am hurting so much, because i used to be an a*** hole to my dog as well.  What i am about to write now is a serious trigger warning regarding the suicidal topic.  This morning i woke up and felt terrible. my head was pounding, and i could not stop thinking about a post made earlier on another board. the post was that i should not have any pets, or be around children. This while i never had any intentions of huting other animal / children or whatsoever. Neither will i ever hurt children.  That post has really struck me, and made me feel like an complete a*** hole. one who does not deserve to live.  So i walked to my dressing room, grabbed my Jiu-jitsu belt, and wrapped it around my neck. i sat down in front of my dressing room door. there was a mirror hanging right in front on me and i looked myself in the eyes. i knotted the belt around the door handle, and started putting pressure on the belt, choking myself.  Suddenly i thought about my wife and cats and bursted out in a huge crying spell. the ones you only see kids doing.  I love my wife and cats to much, that i could not finish the job."
Meditation,3bvr4x,ZenNate,2,Thu Jul 2 15:29:15 2015 UTC,It was suggested to me that the minimum number of minutes you should meditate a day is equal to your age. Some said it should be double that once you really get into in.

Meditation,3bwulo,wolfie12345,3,Thu Jul 2 20:26:05 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the particular center you are going to, but at the last one I attended (also Vipassana, in the style of SN Goenka), during a private interview with the assistant teacher it was brought up that I had been trying as well as I could to sit for two hours straight in the earliest morning session. The teacher actively discouraged this, at least in my case, and told me to do an hour sitting, followed by some time doing walking meditation on the footpath in the forest. Once again, I cannot speak for the center you are attending, but at mine there were only three mandatory sits per day in the meditation hall (1 hr each) and the rest of the time was left up to us to either remain in the hall or sit in our rooms or walk. I am not going to lie; I laid on my bed a few times to meditate and fell asleep haha.   10 hours a day of sitting can definitely become difficult toward the end if you are not used to it (which I was not) but this is OK and perhaps to be expected in some cases.   The only real advice I have is to do what you are capable of while challenging yourself, and keep in mind that there will probably be a day  or two where you may have strong feelings about wanting to leave the retreat, but this is normal and I BEG you to stick it out no matter what it takes because I can practically guarantee you that it will be beyond worth it. The smiles and energy in the room on the last day are so worth toughing it out. Also it will most likely provide a great boost to your practice, so please just stick with it!!  bhavatu sabba mangalam!"

But the context could take a dozen years to come clear and be digested.  We shouldn't mistake the lovely picture of a meditating monk as a seal of approval. Just because there are some words next to a nice picture doesn't mean the words are wise. And just because words are true from a certain perspective doesn't mean they are helpful in one's current situation.  This 'shortest guide' is a sort of glib, pop culture wink and nod. We get the point: just do it, and keep doing it. Fair enough. But that doesn't make it an actual guide to meditation.  Many may not know what ""focus on the breath"" refers to. Does it refer to the breath itself (the air), or the energy that moves with it; does it refer to the sensation of the air passing in the throat or nose; does it refer to the bodily movements of inhalation and exhalation; or does it refer to the awareness of any or all of these? All of these objects and more have been offered as 'breath meditations'.  In addition, and more importantly, most meditators will not start with a clear knowledge of why and how to apply this meditation in life. Only focusing on breath excludes everything else. Is that what we want — for the rest of life to disappear? If so, why? What is the practice's purpose and function? How does it help one live? How does it help one to help others? What is the intended result? How does one identify the intended result? What signs of attainment appear? What signs of non-attainment appear? What are the risks and obstacles? How are they prevented or overcome? What other activities have to be taken up for the practice to be complete?  Glib and trite, the 'shortest guide' shouldn't be seen as anything other than a supercilious reminder that actually doing the practice is essential. It's not an actual guide.  $7 per month for this? ಠ_ಠ"
Meditation,3brd5g,TheHeartOfTuxes,8,Wed Jul 1 18:53:24 2015 UTC,"This brings to mind the shortest course of training given by the Buddha, recorded in the scriptures as the story of Bahiya. Here we find a profound teaching, offered spontaneously and in complete harmony with the situation, capable of swiftly bringing one to enlightenment:   Another teaching from the same collection recounts the story of a wanderer named Bahiya. He stopped the Buddha on the street in Savatthi and said, “Venerable Sir, you are the Samana Gotama. Your Dharma is famous throughout the land. Please teach me that I may understand the truth.”  The Buddha replied, “We’re on our almsround, Bahiya. This is not the right time.”  “Life is uncertain, Venerable Sir. We never know when we are going to die; please teach me the Dharma.”  This dialogue repeats itself three times. Three times over, the Buddha says the same thing, and Bahiya responds in the same way. Finally, the Buddha says, “When a Tathagata is pressed three times, he has to answer. Listen carefully, Bahiya, and attend to what I say:  In the seen, there is only the seen,  in the heard, there is only the heard,  in the sensed, there is only the sensed,  in the cognized, there is only the cognized.  Thus you should see that  indeed there is no thing here;  this, Bahiya, is how you should train yourself.        Since, Bahiya, there is for you  in the seen, only the seen,  in the heard, only the heard,  in the sensed, only the sensed,  in the cognized, only the cognized,  and you see that there is no thing here,  you will therefore see that  indeed there is no thing there.        As you see that there is no thing there,  you will see that  you are therefore located neither in the world of this,  nor in the world of that,  nor in any place  betwixt the two.  This alone is the end of suffering. (ud. 1.10)  Upon hearing these words, Bahiya was immediately enlightened. Moments later he was killed by a runaway cow. So he was right: life is uncertain. Later Bahiya was awarded the title of “The Disciple Who Understood the Teaching Most Quickly.”    recounted by Ajahn Amaro"

I should not have had to work as hard as I did to concentrate pre-amphetamines.  I was constantly working against myself.  Life didn't need to be as hard as it seemed.  Nobody blames a person with bad vision for wearing glasses.  Nobody faults someone with a broken leg for using crutches.  Your frontal cortex needs chemical support.  It works better with an amphetamine than it does without.  Using it now, doesn't mean you will always need or even always want it.  But right now, it might facilitate life's challenges.  The human body isn't perfection.  Enlightenment doesn't mean accepting cancer.  It means being conscious of what benefit you get from it and whether you need it or want it.  Don't take it lightly, but appreciate it for what it provides.  If you need it more than you want it, seek professional help for support.  Don't make it harder than it needs to be."

I started taking medication for my ADHD-PI after about eight or so years of not taking soon after I began meditating and realized that I was not able to get my shit together on my own even with the best intentions. The medication helped a great deal and I took it until my doctor told me to stop when she got worried about high blood pressure two years later. Since then I have been okay with out it. I get what I need to get done, done and have a good job with a decent social life and so on. I meditate when I remember to and have times where I am really consistent and times when I am not.   So be kind to yourself. ADHD is not a joke. It can cause a great deal of suffering. But there is a lot you can do about it. Medication is one aspect of dealing with it and the medications have improved and diversified a great deal from short term stimulants Ritalin and Adderall. Meditation does help too. Therapy helps. Exercise, a good diet and a phone that knows to remind and bug you about things all help too, as does other things such arranging your environment (of all kinds) to support rather than fight you.   What meditation really does for me is make me face myself much more clearly and honestly. I didn't want to start taking medication again. But it was clearly what I needed to do at that time and meditation helped me see and have the humility to do it."

If you do have ADD, be kind to yourself — my biggest regret is that I didn’t confront my diagnosis sooner, and that I allowed myself to believe I was shitty or broken. Seek people w/ ADD you admire, and learn from their wisdom. Luckily, these days there’s no shortage of successful role models w/ ADD. The founder of JetBlue said, “""I have an easier time planning a 20-aircraft fleet than I do paying the light bill.””  Meditation, therapy, and exercise are the golden ticket for anyone. Medication is not something to be taken lightly, but if you have ADD, and a doctor you trust feels medication is worth exploring, adderall can be just as helpful as anything else on the ticket.  If you’re scared about taking medication regularly b/c you worry you might abuse it, this is one of many considerations to discuss w/ your therapist. If you’re scared about taking it regularly for conceptual/existential reasons, then is something worth getting over with the help of a therapist. Again, seek role models.  If medication turns out to be right for you, don’t be afraid. The person who prescribes my adderall is also a vipassana teacher. After dragging my heels, I’ve started using medication on retreat at his suggestion; I’m so glad I took the advice. Mediation and medication are both compatible and extremely helpful to some people, and there are lots of wonderful professionals out there who’ve thought about this a ton and would love to help you find what’s right for you. Hope this helps!"

I've decided to go to a psychiatrist and get evaluated, but I'm a bit intimidated by the selection process and the fact that I know not a lot of PhD's are sympathetic to adult ADHD. If anyone has a recommendation for a therapist/psychiatrist/doctor/etc in the Bay Area (SF specifically), that would be a HUGE help."
Meditation,3btfai,hadoulken,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:36:27 2015 UTC,"So sorry you’ve come across PhD’s unsympathetic to adult ADD, that’s insane. There are mountains of peer-reviewed evidence... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3016271/  Not all diabetics require insulin, but if a doctor doesn’t even acknowledge diabetes, that’s crazytown…  If you’re entertaining medication you’ll need a psychiatrist; even if medication might not be the right fit, I find it comforting if a therapist is an MD as they’re tethered to hard sciences (w/ an implicit degree of scientific rigor)  Wish I could offer specific names of doctors in SF, tried a google search for “psychiatrists San Francisco meditation”, found this on the first page —it’s psychologists who specialize in CBT for depression, but it looks like they’re all experienced meditators and could point you in the direction of like-minded psychiatrists… http://www.mbctbayarea.com/instructors.html  here’s another bay area resource: http://www.vipassanatherapists.org/  Worth saying outright that the process of finding a good therapist can be frustrating for anybody, especially for someone with ADD (as we’re statistically way more likely to get derailed when things don’t work out the first time in any process we find difficult to begin with). It’s really impressive that you’re engaging this, I hope you find your balance in whatever works best for you…  Hope this helps at all, best wishes…  edit: added links, condensed answer"
Meditation,3btfai,cheezy8,3,Thu Jul 2 19:12:41 2015 UTC,"It's understandable, the reluctance to want to take prescription pills. There's a kind of stigma - even I told myself ""well I don't want to be popping pills all my life!""  But honestly, we shouldn't be so hard on our selves. If it improves the quality of your life (without any terrible side effects), why not? I put off going on anti depressants for a long time. When I finally went on them, I found that they helped quite a bit (esp with anxiety). That along with meditation, my life has gotten better.  I think we humans tend to view ourselves as weak simply because sometimes we may rely on manmade medications to help us with certain parts of our lives. But I don't think it's weak. Don't make life harder for yourself."
Meditation,3btfai,KingJoffreyTheBaked,3,Thu Jul 2 04:06:06 2015 UTC,"was diagnosed at 13, took ritalin untill i was 17. Fucked me up, totally. Got depressed because of the amphetamines. But boy, could i work. i got shit done, and it hurt. You know, not getting shit done without support. and every evening when it stopped. The sadness and blandness. When i was on it i had no problem that everything was bland, i wasn't aware of it. but as soon as it stopped working, everything bland and boring. Sad. You probably know where this is going. Got higher dosage. all effects stronger and getting more depressed.   dropped Amphetamines. Started meditation (and vaping weed in the meantime) The weed helped me over the time before the meditation was implemented for me. now im about 170 days in my meditaion journey and feeling great."
Meditation,3btfai,SamuelColeridgeValet,2,Thu Jul 2 07:31:43 2015 UTC,"Even if meditation happens to be the best stress reduction method, it's not the only one.  I suggest looking at all the stress managment approaches.  For example, see the Univ of Kansas TLC site, with information on lifestyle and mood, also the Metapsychology review of the book on TLC, Depression Cure by Ilardi.  If you google ADHD and tai chi, you can find info on studies showing this helping young people with the disorder.  I've been thinking about the difference in what a meditation advocate like Jon Kabat-Zinn says and what a healthy lifestyle advocate like Steve Ilardi says.  One talks about non-striving and the other says go for it, the more active you are the better.  Look for what they have in common.  Ilardi doesn't say frenzied activity.  He likes the idea of friends going for long walks and he warns against burning out on too much exercise.  A hobby you find interesting and enjoyable doesn't have to be face-paced.  You can relax with Kabat-Zinn and Ilardi, but Ilardi says you also have to burn your calories."

What's more likely is that the neural pathways involved in focus will grow stronger. Wikipedia's page about ritalin says:   Meta-analyses and systematic reviews of magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that long-term treatment with ADHD stimulants (specifically, amphetamine and methylphenidate) decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD.[19][20][21]   I used to feel the same way, but it's backwards.

Meditation,3btfai,cunhamatata,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:52:30 2015 UTC,"I was prescribed vyvanse and adderall and it changed my life no doubt. They are extremely powerful drugs. For two years I took them almost every day. At first I loved it but I can guarantee they will lose their luster. I built a tolerance to it. I would feel like absolute shit all the time, wouldn't be able to do anything unless I popped a pill. It's impossible to just chill while on the stuff, there's a reason why they call it speed.  Then, I had a break in my classes and I stopped taking it all together. I went through really shitty withdrawals, felt like a shitty lethargic zombie blob for a month. Once I got through it though, I. Felt. So. Good. It was amazing, having consistent energy throughout the day, having an appetite, no headaches, being able to relax and just chill, it's amazing.  I had my hardest semester ever coming up and I was looking for any possible way to not go back on adderall for the entire semester and be a zombie again. I found a morning routine and a couple of tricks that aloud me to focus way BETTER than with adderall. 1. Get 8 hours of sleep, every fucking night 2. Wake up, and MOVE, do some so of exercise even if it's for only 20 minutes 3. Blend a fuck ton of healthy vegetables fruits and vegetables and drink that shit, you'll literally feel  nutritional blast to your face, I do a variation of Joe Rogan's hulk load shake, PM me if you want the recipe 4. Meditate, it's infinitely more powerful than any drug, just get in 10 minutes, the headspace app is great.  Doing these four things in the morning made me feel like the Incredible Hulk. It didn't cure my ADHD but it gave me the energy I needed to be able to tackle it without drugs. If you organize your day and then start it off right, you'll be able to crush it."
Meditation,3btfai,Keepem,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:06:24 2015 UTC,"The best thing for my diagnosed ADHD was never medication. I tried almost every one of them. What made life much easier was meditation. Training that meditation muscle gave me an edge over ADHD. It was hard at first, but when I got the hang of it, it really changed my life. Now I have controlled focus when I need it and can be my normal self when it's not necessary.   Medicine can seem like an easy way out, but it's just a cover up. It has many negative side effects long term and short term. I suffered a lot during my medicated years.  If you stick it out for meditation, you'll help yourself in many more ways than ADHD. It took me over a year to get it, but it was very much worth it.   Many people don't agree with me and may down vote me, but I'm speaking from a person who actually went through this process and it helped me much more than the amphetamines did. If I didn't share my side of the story, I would be doing an injustice."
Meditation,3btfai,r3dlazer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:15:51 2015 UTC,"ADHD is what's called an ""Axis 1"" disorder.  There are also Axis 2 disorders.   Axis 2 disorders are noted because they behavioural problems - someone has been taught or learned a series of negatively-reinforcing behaviours that compound into a serious problem. This happened to my girlfriend, who was recently diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I thought this was really bad at first, but it turns out she just needs to learn some techniques for managing her emotions and thoughts, which boils down to mindfulness, and she'll be all set. It'll take her a long time, but it can be done.  ADHD is an axis 1 disorder, or a neurological disorder. Our brains do not produce the right neurochemicals to regulate our activities correctly. It's true that some people have beaten their ADHD with thought alone, but presumably those people had a milder form of ADHD or have other  advantages that might help them manage it.   Meditation, despite it's promise, is not magic, and it cannot undo the damage done by simply lacking the chemicals we use to stay focused and concentrate on whatever task we have at hand.   I went off my medication because I couldn't afford it (Strattera), but now I'm really thinking seriously about going back on it. I have a lot of writing to do if I'm going to write my way out of poverty.   In any case, good luck."
Meditation,3brzb6,rationalawareness,5,Wed Jul 1 17:51:12 2015 UTC,"It's weird you said this, because just two days ago I decided to sum up my newer meditation phase as, 'game-like cheerfulness and compassion.'  It's game-like only in the sense that, before meditation, there can be a very melodramatic intensity to our worries because we don't have an internal source of wellbeing -- all the wellbeing is 'out there,' or 'in this person' or even 'in my solid self-image...' and so when we have this attitude, 'we better get that external stuff damnit,' because that's what all our chances for wellbeing are--external.   Because of that extra source of wellbeing with meditation, we get a chance to take a step back more, and then we can finally notice 'the Now itself,' as Tolle says. I think that's where the literal video-gameness came in for me: once you're not as reflexively freaked by the 'displays,' you can finally explore and appreciate the display source itself-- the inner-screen, the inner-speakers, and so on."

After a few months of practicing awareness of breathing for 90 minutes/day I started having the HD vision experience you talked about. I still haven't had the non-identification with thoughts/sensations experience though. Would you say experiencing non-identification was just a matter of lots of awareness practice, or was there some trick or subtle mental gesture that triggered it?"
Meditation,3brzb6,flagrant_armadillo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:44:34 2015 UTC,"For me, the trick to experiencing non-identification in my everyday life was continual breath awareness. Before, I could experience a little bit of that state of objectivity, but honestly not much.  I do youtube videos about that technique. Please give it a try! Here is the intro video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRaV2kCdsQY  It is a little daunting starting out, but remember that your sole criterion for success is returning to the breath: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dZKSKNb8hQ  One thing you can try right now is just focus on your breath while counting your breaths up to ten and back down to one as you do other things: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33-szlHhSs8 Might take you a few minutes to get it (start over at one when you catch yourself drifting), but it might give you a glimpse of what I'm talking about.

It's happening right now actually. My vision is becoming extra vivid too.   Anyway, listening to you talk about meditation I can tell we're really on the same page in approaching it rationally. I think there's going to be more people like us in the near future with the greater access to information online and celebrities like Eminem saying publicly that they do a lot of meditation. Some may even develop their practice to the point of non-identification as you have and spread the word about what's possible through meditation.

In this case, though this is interpretive & by no means conclusive, the existentially defeating neurosis that would rob a westerner of his or her own life can be traced to the metaphysical notion of time, and the crisis culture born of the idea that the second coming can & will come at any moment and faith must be displayed through ones works.  But this is my interpretation, information & ideas naturally spread and echo in ways that history cannot keep up with. When practicing mindfulness, it is not hard to see the effect the delirium of history has upon us. It is not hard to begin to see our own minds as the container for viruses & bacteria that bind time & space to infect & manifest as impulse or neurosis that ultimately devastate or rob the lives of many."

Many words can be spoken about living well; but living well still goes up and down, up and down, in an endless cycle of gain and loss where one never moves beyond the illusion of dualistic life. The actual Dharma, and the teachings of the Dalai Lama, can go beyond merely 'living well', to cut off the source of suffering at its very root.  In other words, most of us are attached to our dream; and when we hear nice words about having a nice dream we cheer them on, unaware that they are not bringing us any closer to waking up.

I have lost my way. I need a hand. If you truly feel as though your practise has stagnated, try and find a place near you to go on a retreat for a weekend or a week or so. Otherwise keep at it, all these feelings good or bad are to be observed, and ultimately will pass.

Do it for 20 minutes. Use different techniques like counting your breaths forward, backward or repeating some mantra like ""I am aware/mindul"" or ""may I be happy"" etc. Make it a part of your life and forget thinking like if it's going to benefit me or whatever.

Relying on meditation to solve all your problems doesn't work any more than a prescription does.  One thing we can say about meditation - no harmful side effects.    A big advantage of professional help is somebody you can talk with about all these different aspects of your life.  About meditation, everybody starts out saying they can't do it!  Everyody's mind wanders.  It's unnatural for the human mind to pay attention to one thing, like breathing, indefinitely.  We work around that. The teachers know how to teach it, have been doing it for thousands of years.  It works!"

Do you have any close friends or family members you can open up to? Hang in there. Life can be tough. Tbh I've been feeling pretty low too. Hope to hear from you... Um.. Man? Hehe -.-"""
Meditation,3bsp0k,saywhat420,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:13:33 2015 UTC,"I am really a mess, I am getting upset extremely easily and inside I feel like I want to cry. Outside I can't and I look tough as nails. Its like two different people, one wants to yell and the other, cry.   It seems that you feel like this because you don't want others to view you as weak. So when sadness arises in public, a thought will arise saying something like ""I mustn't appear weak!"", and to protect that idea you yell in an attempt to hide your sadness.  Incidentally, you say you look tough as nails, but when people use anger to hide an insecurity -- which is what you seem to be doing -- it is fairly obvious to most people. The reason this tactic works isn't because people actually think you're tough as nails, but because they won't suggest you're not in fear of reprisal. In extreme situations, where someone cannot even admit such a weakness to themselves, they will fight others for the tiniest implication that they're not tough, because they're scared others aren't buying into their act. Friends will desperately try to avoid making any kind of implication that they're weak, and even then the person will frequently become aggressive.  The key to overcoming this is to disempower the thought ""I mustn't appear weak"" or whatever it is you're averse to. So when you next feel like yelling, you can break the cycle by not yelling and instead stepping aside and slowly counting to ten. If you do that every time you feel that way, that small amount of time will allow you to learn to abide in the feeling and discover that the thought ""I appear weak"" doesn't harm or damage you.   Ive been trying to meditate but I have had some pretty bad sessions. I keep getting distracted and I do not feel like it is beneficial.   When you go about your day, your mind will frequently be distracted without you realising it. Noticing that you have been distracted is a sign that you're cultivating mindfulness and should be considered a positive. By meditating, you're beginning to bring these distractions into you awareness. That's the whole point of attending to an object like the breath, so that when your get lost in a story and your attention unconsciously moves, you will notice it has moved because you'll no longer be attending to the breath."

Physical movement practice can be very helpful. But essentially, one requires strategies, practices, and the basic willingness to be moved — to allow the natural flow of feelings and energy to arise. At some point, an initial avoidance of some of these movements hardened into a pattern of avoidance, shutting down natural life. A life-embracing context is necessary.

People in this world rarely do it for me, but knowing how things work and being aware of my environment so thoroughly really does make my life better. My only warning is that you have to make a place for yourself in the world. Sometimes the more you know, the harder it is to find a purpose. I don't need the kind of purpose other people seem to. I'm just happy to bring a little peace to the world around me. I know how desperately it's needed. I can't help but cry when I look at stars. In a good way.

Go to a park and watch some squirrels. Whatever you do, don't give into ""met, whatever"", because that just discredits the experience you are having.

My advice is anytime you do feel something like that, ride it out as long as possible. Ask yourself why this is so profound and try to understand your emotions. I have only been mediating for 2 days and am using it to enhance my mind and continue tearing down the walls I've built.

Meditation,3brojd,BudFromBC,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:09:23 2015 UTC,"I empathize with you my friend. I too have been struggling with blocked emotions; I suffered from emotional abuse throughout my childhood and shut my feelings off as a result. Here's the thing - you didn't get to where you are in a day, or even a few weeks. You've built up these emotional blockages over the course of years, and it's going to take some time to break the walls down. That's ok! Be gentle and patient with your self. If you feel lifeless, really experience it, really feel the lack. You can't force yourself to feel, but maybe as you practice mindfulness you'll experience more and more of these ""little feels"". Instead of thinking that these ""little feels"" are inadequate, try experiencing them as fully as you can, for however long they're around. Be grateful for them, and perhaps over time you'll get deeper into these emotions.  Another suggestion is to look at areas where you've blocked yourself. For myself, I find that there are experiences/feelings I'm afraid of, so I tend to tense up in situations where I might feel them. Being aware of and retraining this response is a step towards breaking the habit of shutting off feeling. Best of luck to you! I'm very interested if anyone else has advice on the matter."

As for the note or frequency, you want to experiment until the sound is loud enough and you can physically feel the middle of your chest resonating and resounding. Now repeat over and over again trying to not force the yam mantra but let it flow smoothly from start to finish when letting out the breath.

Meditation,3bqvfh,nani_kore,2,Wed Jul 1 14:30:25 2015 UTC,"However, I am struggling to find the time and space to practise when I share a household with 3 others. The only ample time I have alone is during the night when they're sleeping but for unknown reasons I feel their presence still interferes.   If you're meditating alone at night, there is functionally no difference between if others are in the house or not. If you pay attention to what you're actually experiencing -- and, at it's root, that's basically what meditation is about -- you will mostly hear the same sounds, see the same sights. If you're in a room by yourself and nobody is making any noise, then there is nothing in your immediate environment that will tell you that others are in the house.  What is different is that thoughts are arising in your mind about how others are in the house. When these thoughts arise, others thoughts are arising in reaction, telling you that this is interfering with your meditation. This will trigger even more thoughts, elongating this story about how you can feel the presence of others and therefore cannot meditate.  The key to overcoming this is to realise that thoughts about others being in the house isn't a problem. You can just notice the thought, and then return your attention to your breath (or whatever else you attend to). You don't need to make these thoughts go away.  Meditation isn't about changing what you experience, but about learning to work with your current situation as it is. So if you're thinking about how others are in the house, that's what you're thinking. During meditation, you can learn to be okay with these thoughts, to not view them as a problem that you must fix.  It is this mindset, of learning to be okay with what is arising in your mind, that provides many of the benefits meditation provides. As a practical example, if you have to speak in front of a group of people, you may feel a little nervous that you will somehow embarrass yourself. Many people will react to these feelings, freak out a little, and therefore not give the best speech they could. Someone who has meditated a lot would still feel the same nerves, but would be able to be okay with those feelings, and therefore the feelings wouldn't affect their ability to give their speech."

I find it helpful to use foam earplugs and a dark eye mask and sit on the closet floor with the door closed. I've also used headphones and meditative music or something from Robert Monroe (biurnal beats) to drown out the house noise.

This group is very Buddhism oriented and follows the rituals .I felt they were fairly authentic. Zazen = sitting meditation     Sesshin = 3 day (or longer) retreat.more intense  Kinhin is walking meditation which is usuay done with zazen.  Sesshin retreats are charged .you can try a weekly sit for no charge  PM me if you want to know more

I've dealt with tons of depression and anxiety in the past year, and so while most people interpret this as ""don't be hard on yourself for 'bad' thoughts"", I interpret this as ""nothing you do really matters and you're trapped, you're completely subject to your experience with no ability to change"".

Meditation,3bra48,holt5301,0,Thu Jul 2 15:08:29 2015 UTC,"That sounds like nihilism. I had that same view when I was depressed. There is also the theory of compatibilism that states we can simultaneously have free will and not have free will. I don't really understand it though.  I wish I could give you an in-depth, technical, therevada buddhist answer. Here is my best try: From what I understand, during a single thought process multiple thought moments arise (at most 17), some of them conditioned by past karma and some of them not (somewhere between 1-7 I think). The more mindful we become the more we are able to tune into the thought moments that are not conditioned by past experience. There are also billions of thought moments in the time span of a single bolt of lightning, for example.  In the end, since being depressed gives you a skewed sense of reality, it might be better to just believe in free will (right or wrong) until you can change your circumstances."

Meditation,3bra48,Sampajanna,2,Wed Jul 1 17:17:16 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna bypass the whole moral-responsibility rabbit hole and just touch on why /r/meditation may be interested in the free-will debate on some levels (not all parts of the debate).   Some people beat themselves up for 'having' some thoughts, as if there were a malicious mini-me who must be somewhere inside though it's unfindable, and this mini-me seems to pre-approve all manner of bizarre, random, draining, inefficient mental movements in our minds, day in and day out.   To make it less abstract: We know when we are breathing naturally versus 'having' a conscious breath with an extra layer of volition. But because of thoughts and their nature, thoughts can all seem intrinsically volitional to some people, because that 'is' their mind to them.   So that's why free will is of interest, on that level: because a little bit of loosening-up on our idea of free will (namely the 'libertarian' free will idea) can liberate a person who has a subconscious confusion that they are approving every thought before thoughts appear; if someone feels like that, then every thought seems to risk becoming fused with their identity on some level.   And that's quite related to meditation that involves making a healthier relationship with thoughts, on and off the cushion."

I think the passive frame theory is simply a more sensational branding of a system that has been considered for over a hundred years.

Jungian psychology proposed the different theoretical orders that individuals might be expressing their ""pure"" subconscious with the MBTI. I'm not saying I give credence to the details of this theory. I only bring it up to provide evidence that this thinking isn't new and was approached with more nuance in the past.        Throwing the word ""free will"" in there just seems like an attempt to make an incremental finding seem like a groundbreaking discovery. Do we have a definitive definition of freewill? Couldn't we say that freewill doesn't exist because we can't fly through a wall? I think this type of research verges into the territory of pseudoscience. Anyone who has ever had anxiety can prove the type of freewill this theory describes. I take issue with them using a word that has such connotative prowess. It's the same as people coining that LHC discovery the ""god particle"". It's clickbait that people take very seriously. I think it's an ethical issue. People are most sane when they perceive they are in control and can impose order on their existence. To me, this type of jargon usage is straight up manipulative and dishonest.

Meditation,3bra48,Sampajanna,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:15:59 2015 UTC,"I think the passive frame theory is simply a more sensational branding of...the interplay between different parts of the brain and their processes.   Interesting. Is there somewhere where the authors of the study say that this is the first theory to show that the brain has an interplay between its parts? I'll talk about this issue a few times more later.  It just seems to be a neuroscientific attempt to account for data about the mind's possible modularity, in my opinion.   Jungian psychology proposed the different theoretical orders that individuals might be expressing their ""pure"" subconscious with the MBTI   Well, the Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator system isn't exactly on the cutting edge of neuroscience, and the world famous academic journal in which passive-frame theory was published —Brain and Behavioral Sciences—is really in a league of its own when its comes to harsh, rigorous standards. It wouldn't accept merely repackaged old stuff. But that's an argument from authority I suppose. I would just caution bringing in something like 'personality-type' systems when we're talking about a BBS-journal article about consciousness's interplay with the somatic portion of the nervous system.    this thinking isn't new and was approached with more nuance in the past.    Jung and Meyer-Briggs seem far more unrelated than Fodor's work on modularity of mind from the 80's, in my opinion. It's not quite appropriate to take the nuance of Jung's psychological speculations or MBTI and compare it to the nuance of attempts to account for neuroscientific data with a conceptual framework. There may be much more nuance with Jung, but I'd say that these appear to be different projects in that regard.   Throwing the word ""free will"" in there just seems like an attempt to make an incremental finding seem like a groundbreaking discovery.   That's usually more about science journalists than the scientists themselves. Here's a copy of the actual study from the scientist's website, and we can see that nowhere in their intro, claims, analysis, or conclusion did they mention free will at all.  It's often journalists who try to get attention and clicks at the expense of scientists who are not trying to make such dramatic and crude, blunt, un-nuanced claims.   Do we have a definitive definition of freewill?   Frankly, I find the whole free will debate unnecessary. I'll paraphrase philosopher Daniel Dennett, who said that we really care about 'morally competent volition,' which could be a higher-order deterministic process but is still very important for our moral judgments.   Couldn't we say that freewill doesn't exist because we can't fly through a wall?   I suppose someone has possibly said that before.   I think this type of research verges into the territory of pseudoscience.   Again, I know it's an argument from authority, but I really wouldn't assert that the BBS-journal is pseudoscience. I would be right with you that most of the journalists who are trying to interpret the author's study are making off-the-wall claims, and that I find unfortunate.   I take issue with them using a word that has such connotative prowess. It's the same as people coining that LHC discovery the ""god particle"". It's clickbait that people take very seriously.    I would just refer back to the study itself which didn't reference free will in the body of the paper at all, it's the journalists who did that.   I think it's an ethical issue. People are most sane when they perceive they are in control and can impose order on their existence.   I agree, there's something to that. I have seen lots of research on hopelessness, and I think it's important to avoid blatantly demotivating and deflating people. Unfortunately, science and formal-philosophy don't care much for whether we 'perceive that we are in control' or not, they want to know what the level of control we have is, not what level we want to have.   To me, this type of jargon usage is straight up manipulative and dishonest.    I agree, and I might again reference the journalists on this one, and not the academic community which didn't seem to even try to jump down the free will rabbit hole.   I also take issue with using theoretical evidence to, in essence, excuse our ""impure"" thoughts.   Do people use theoretical evidence to excuse thoughts? I almost always see that discussion centering around people who mercilessly self-abuse, and come out once they realize that there's a bit of automaticity in the mind. In other words, some people feel like there's a mean guy who needs to be punished over and over, on the inside, whereas once we have an understanding of conditioning, we can reverse the cycle; in other words, when we reverse habits of body and mind, it can help to notice that conditions can be the reason we thought and acted a certain way, and those conditions can be changed, changing our health for the better.   This is no different than using the findings of quantum physics in whacky-ding-dong new age religions.   I would say that the journalism around this study is a bit like that, indeed.   Meditation is not about booting theories to make us feel better about ourselves. That's what sets it apart from religious prayer.    Sure, but I don't think most people are talking about that when it comes to meditation. It's just about the direct nature of thought-observation, not religion: when we sit down and watch our stream of thoughts, there may be a noticeable voluntary aspect here and there but there's a lot of movement that seems to come out of nowhere too. And I think it's fine to admit that there's some complexity there, a bit of automaticity in our lives that could stand to be noticed for what it is."

The libertarian is generally quite happy to allow that all deliberation and decision making is undertaken by the brain, in conjunction with the agent's history and environment. The libertarian is only committed to the position that free will would be impossible in a determined world and in the actual world some agents, on some occasions, perform freely willed actions.   The difficulty of figuring something out demonstrates that it may difficult to figure out, not necessarily that a different hypothesis is correct.   No, but as supposing the reality of determinism appears to be the only reason that people could have for denying that they have the free will that they appear to have, determinists need to support their position with more than wishful thinking, because they appear to be mistaken.   Your comment appears to simply say that libertarianism is more intuitive from the point of view of first-person-experience.    It's a lot more than that! We can't function without assuming the libertarian position is correct and we constantly and consistently demonstrate the reliability of that assumption. If there is anything that can be considered to have been conclusively established, it is that we have free will and that we would not have this free will in a determined world. After all, this is why free will deniers talk about ""the illusion of free will"".   There's also determinism, which many scientists seem to endorse on one level or another.    I guess you mean hard determinism. Many scientists also hold that the world is not determined, one Nobel prize winner has argued that life would be impossible in a determined world, another has pointed out that the assumptions required for experimental science include the libertarian stance on free will.   If you think that the libertarian is mistaken, what's your argument for that claim?"

To that degree though? How would that be demonstrated scientifically? As I said, deliberation is much more plausibly an event that is a result of prior causes that determined that deliberation than 'something else.' But that all depends on just how free your personal definition of free will is. If all you mean is 'deliberation is free will,' then sure I guess I'm with you. Either way, if your view is right, I'm fine with it too. I really don't see the problem if either side is right; there seems to be a lot of caricaturing on both sides of the aisle when it comes to this hot-button debate.   determinists need to support their position with more than wishful thinking, because they appear to be mistaken.   Again, this really hinges on what is meant by 'free' when some people define 'free will.' If you mean a somehow completely cause-free volition that has nothing to do with determining forces, that seems far more like wishful thinking to me because it's not demonstrable in the lab at all, compared to the plausible claim that effects determine causes.   We can't function without assuming the libertarian position is correct and we constantly and consistently demonstrate the reliability of that assumption.   I truly, honestly, don't think that's true. This is a really huge assertion, that the human race can't function unless they take on your philosophical stance. A determinist can value 'morally competent volition' without having to be concerned at all with free will on the libertarian level. A determinist can care about the arising of intentions, actions, harm, and harmony, and not have to claim that they're non-causally volitional inside.   If there is anything that can be considered to have been conclusively established, it is that we have free will    Um. Free will is literally one of the most un-settled debates of all time, that's why people call it a philosophical rabbit-hole so often.   this is why free will deniers talk about ""the illusion of free will"".   No, actually, it seems like 'free will deniers' (?) only say that because they are honest enough to admit that it's an illusion: meaning that it really does appear to be one way (meaning that it IS a point in favor for libertarianism, in that sense) but upon further reflection or investigation does not survive scrutiny. So it's illusory: it appears one way, no doubt, but is not that way (according to determinists).   one Nobel prize winner has argued that life would be impossible in a determined world   Scientific consensus is far more reliable than one individual scientist's assertion.   the assumptions required for experimental science include the libertarian stance on free will   I would like do see that argument.   If you think that the libertarian is mistaken, what's your argument for that claim?   I have, frankly, no vested interest in the free will debate. I'm just fascinated by the passion it generates, sort of like the god-debates. In both debates, if something is or is-not the case I will accept it, but I'm fascinated by how much caricaturing of the opposing view goes on (on both sides, to be fair) when the stakes appear to be high.  To me, the stakes are not only not high in this debate, they're totally irrelevant to my life, as is god. Most Westerns don't even seem to realize that many in the non-Western world have full religious lives and cultures that never even tried to worry about a god or free will. Free will originally was an attempt for Christians to reconcile the claims that everything is God's will ultimately with the fact that evil actions and hell-bound humans seem to clearly exist.   In other words, there are whole cultures, one of which I'm a part, which may be somewhat interested by free will as an entertainment or speculation, but have ultimately gone on just fine without feeling like they must become determinists or libertarians at all."
Meditation,3bra48,ughaibu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:29:18 2015 UTC,"deliberation is much more plausibly an event that is a result of prior causes that determined that deliberation than 'something else.' But that all depends on just how free your personal definition of free will is.    The most that philosophers are talking about, when they talk about free will, is the capacity of certain agents to make and enact a conscious choice from amongst realisable alternatives. Determinism is the stance that 1 there are laws of nature which are the same at all times and in all places, 2 at all times the world has a globally definite state, which can, in principle, be fully described and 3 that given the state of the world at any time, the state of the world at all other times is globally and exactly entailed by the given state and the laws.   First, notice that determinism is not about cause and effect, not least because causal relations are local, time asymmetric and explanatory, whereas the relations in a determined world are global, time symmetric and ontological.   Second, bear in mind that we do not know if the actual world ever has a definite describable state, neither do we know if there are laws of nature and if there are, whether they are the determining sort.   Now consider a typical social situation, you and a friend are deciding where to go for a drink. You've been to the Red Cow, so you know that you're capable of going there, you've also been to the White Horse, so there are two destinations that you know that you're capable of going to, and if you discuss which to go to, agree on one and then meet there, you have apparently demonstrated free will.   Now let's suppose that the world is determined, that is to say that billions of years ago, before there even was an Earth, the state of the world and its laws entailed exactly that you would meet your friend at the White Horse (if that's the pub you chose), but you don't know what the laws of nature are, if there are any, so how do you know which pub to go to? What if you toss a coin to decide, the laws of nature entail exactly that you match the correct pub to the correct face of the coin and then go to the pub indicated? It just isn't plausible, as far as I can see.   Scientific consensus is far more reliable than one individual scientist's assertion.    But there is no scientific consensus in favour of determinism, in fact, deterministic interpretations of quantum mechanics, for example, are considered highly eccentric.   I would like do see that argument.    Experimental science requires that procedures can be repeated and that we can perform incompatible courses of action. The first condition is required to avoid fraud, mistakes, etc, and the second is required for controlled experiments, and without these, we cannot show that an effect is significant. So:   1) experimental science requires the assumption that a researcher can repeat either of two incompatible courses of action   2) in a determined world, exactly one course of action is entailed by the laws and state of the world   3) therefore, in a determined world the requirements of experimental science are not met   4) the requirements of experimental science are only consistent with a non-determined world in which the researcher can consciously choose and enact either one of a set of realisable procedures, ie the libertarian position.   To me, the stakes are not only not high in this debate    Human beings are social animals, as a consequence they need to have a world in common about which they can effectively communicate. The only non-arbitrary way to decide on such a world is to take the world as it demonstrably is, that means accepting the truth of evolution, global warming and free will, or any other facts that people deny because those facts threaten their worldview. That in the case of free will the denial is primarily espoused by atheists and neuroscientists does not lend the position any respectability. Free will is demonstrable, so any demonstration that there is no free will would mean that we live in a world that is logically absurd. Further, free will denial is inconsistent with the assumptions and practice of science, so no empirical science can ever be consistent and cast doubt on the reality of free will.   Free will denial is irrational and anti-social, personally, I think that is sufficient to make it worth combating."

Clearly you're very convinced that this issue is really worth going into depth about, argument-wise. I can respect that if it's something you think is important. I don't think it is and I never have. I've read quantum indeterminist views, libertarian views, on and on, and I'm not personally convinced that it's an issue where I need to be a determinist or a libertarian at all or that others must take a stance on this for the sake of social hamrony. But that's a personal temperament-thing, possibly.   Free will denial is irrational and anti-social, personally, I think that is sufficient to make it worth combating.   If you personally think that, then I can see how you think it's worth it to formally engage the issue and arguments. I don't, past a certain point, just like the god-debates: I am fascinated for the sake of intellectual stimulation, but that's about it.

And how would you deal with people that want to leave? Would they stay on as crew and just not do the meditation? How would you deal with people that don't want to work (as in ""I quit"")? Sea-sickness? (""Meditate on your illness"" will not work for everybody.)  The idea sounds fun. Although retreats aren't supposed to be fun. Would the fun be too distracting from the work of meditation?"
Meditation,3bqtux,sleepycorn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:04:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  The work would be non urgent and meditative at the same time, like calligraphy in the zen tradition I suppose.  Routine could be simple. Rise, meditate, eat, sail, eat, work, eat, meditate, rest, rinse repeat. :)  Wanting to leave would be up to the individual, I would always want to be in a safe harbour overnight so there is a chance every day if people were having a difficult time.  Sea sickness is interesting. I've been on and around boats all my life and have been sea sick from time to time. A lot of it is in the head and how you respond to nausea can be a lesson in itself. Again, down to the individual, some could quit, some could recover.  Depends on your idea of fun really. Crashing through waves or lying still at anchor can be both or neither depending on your state of mind I guess."

Meditation,3bqtux,clickstation,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:08:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying. My thinking is that it would offer an alternative to reflective, almost controlled meditative environments. The sea does what it does, sometimes calm, sometimes fierce. The learning would be in how you respond to the environment and your crewmembers.   I suppose it also depends on what you are struggling with. If it's fear, then putting yourself in fearful situations that are out of your control might provide some good grist for your meditative mill? The sea can be a scary place, if you are not a little scared then you are not aware of the possibilities. Where I live in the UK the sea claims lives every year from those that fail to understand the power of the combined elements at sea."

I'll spare the details, but over the course of a few years, I had one more experience that topped that one, but I felt safe because I was   with a spotter(partner?).   Since that time, during some of my meditations, I get a pressure right in the middle of my forehead. Sometimes it pulsing sometimes it's not, but it always freaks me out. It only seems to happen during meditations, but does sometimes linger throughout the day. This leads me to believe it's probably not a medical issue.  Nonetheless, I have been scared to meditate, but it was a big part of what kept me clear headed and focused. I'll probably make a post taking about that later, if this post doesn't get too productive, but I'd like to know why you fear meditation.  What is causing you to fear meditation? Is procrastination part of your personality? Do you often complete things that you start or do  you lose interest?

I dont think there are any nerve channels where the chakras are located; it might be something else which can felt in the material world but to me it's very much there. Mundane or 'magical' it's there. Also, don't discredit things just because we can't perceive them. Try explaining vision to a blind man.

Meditation,3bokf5,ThePhilocypher,2,Wed Jul 1 07:52:32 2015 UTC,"You mean ""scared"" as in avoidant? Or scared as in actually terrified, like something scary happened?  I'd say if you feel yourself avoiding/procrastinating it, stop the program you're doing for now and just aim for very short meditations - 3 minutes, 5 minutes. Don't commit to a lot at first. Two weeks is still very much beginner stage, so it hasn't be established as a habit yet. Therefore it's easy for resistance to sneak up and try to pull you away.  Short meditation is the answer. Tell yourself, ""just 3 minutes of breath focus then I'll get on with whatever else I have to do"". Then keep that up day after day till you're comfortable with doing more."
Meditation,3bokf5,nani_kore,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:26:55 2015 UTC,"avoidant is probably the better term. it doesn't scare me to mediate, i just avoid it. i don't want to stop the program because i enjoy it and the benefits to being mindful. i'm more trying to find out why i'm avoidant of meditation. it's strange."
Meditation,3bokf5,nani_kore,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:40:10 2015 UTC,"There's no reason to find out why you're avoiding it. It's simple - we resist anything that's new or strange. It's just how our brains work. This happens with EVERY new habit, not just meditation. Even if you're enjoying it and feeling benefits, the feeling of resistance can still present itself.  I've been practicing for 7 months now, and in the beginning I had the exact same experience with not feeling like it. That's why I recommended the 5-minute thing. That helped me break through my resistance easily. Sitting daily is a must now - I literally feel uncomfortable if I try to skip it.   Setting very low standards like 5 minutes a day makes it way easier to build up the consistency you need in the beginning to make it a habit. 30 minutes a day of something new is always going to feel hard at first and is far more likely to lead to you skipping days.  But if you want to stick to your program by all means, cool. Just forget about explaining and get back to your practice. It'll become easier to keep up the more you do it."

In other words, as we gain the objectivity that meditation brings, we begin to see the mind as it is with all its flaws and delusions. This can be alarming, to say the least.  But think of it as purging the mind of its defilements, and when it is done it is much more manageable.

Now I just can't get back into Buddhism or meditation because I feel I've strayed too far from it and since I allowed myself to get so far, that I don't deserve to be in that kind of state of mindfulness.   Now if I were to try and meditate, I feel awkward, like I shouldn't do this because IT'S NOT ME and having been to Buddhist meditation practices and whatnot, I know that I shouldn't feel that way and I should just accept what has happened and continue my training, but just some part of me feels like I can't and that's what's holding me back.  It really sucks.  I love Buddhism and I love the simplistic monk lifestyle and I've always wanted to go to a Monastery and just be away from it all and learn Buddhism and what the Monastery has to offer.

There are legit Skype teachers, real people who webcast for free, and so on. There's also /r/redditations that is a great group of folks doing group meditation a lot, and breath meditation is likely a core practice there or at least shared preliminary-part of the session where people settle in.

(Too many don't do the latter, and assume you'll just ""clear your mind"" and figure it out. Or they just say ""focus on the breath!"" and don't map out the various states you might experience.)   So.. My 2c, first find a style you want -- a branch of Buddhism? Which one? Or perhaps something more secular? Etc. ...

How do you do yours: do you label the thought, do you anchor your attention in the body, or do you just do a 'non-directive' method of letting whatever happens happen (check out /r/nondirective by the way, an underrated place).  If you haven't already I highly suggest taking a look at this page from our subreddit, as a sampler of techniques that may have specific enough instructions to keep you in line and not have too many odd things happen.

Meditation,3bnbgh,dczx,2,Tue Jun 30 20:48:28 2015 UTC,"Eh, detail matters here.  If you see meditation solely as a means to some end, then that could be very limiting to your practice and result in unnecessary frustration when you don't get ""the result you wanted"".   But practicing primarily for the sake of developing your practice wherever it takes you, while allowing whatever benefits to come and acknowledging them as they do - I see nothing wrong with.  We all began meditating for a reason, whether it was to help us with depression, anxiety, problems focusing, or even bad habits. It wouldn't make sense if we didn't have any initial reason. The key is just putting those things into perspective and making sure consistent practice is your priority overall, no matter what outcomes arise or when."

Meditation,3bqp09,le_greatest_ledditor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:12:23 2015 UTC,"Insecurity.  Everyone has varying levels of it. But the more compassion and ""no-self"" you cultivate, the less room there is for insecurity to thrive. Because essentially it's a ""you vs. them"" mentality that causes it. ""What if they're better than me? What if they're judging me? What if they're talking about me?"" Them them them. Me me me.  The compassion for yourself and others that grows via meditation can help you identify more with people around you, so there's less ""you/them"" and more ""us"". Also, as you become less judgmental of your own thoughts and feelings, you start judging others less too. And as you learn to sit and observe thoughts/feelings mindfully, in the same way you gain the ability to observe your social surroundings mindfully and unreactively.  Then, wahlah. You start to get offended less as well and can be more relaxed in social situations :)"

Meditation,3bpzu6,nd235,2,Wed Jul 1 05:32:31 2015 UTC,"What in the world? That link is not even Zazen, it's just some elementary breath meditation with a counting-drill added to it. Zazen isn't about trotting around and trying to do number games. You may be doing way too much busy-work here, let alone the fact that it's not even Zazen.   If that breath/counting deal helps calm you first, keep that. But then do actual Zazen after you've calmed down. In Zazen, you don't have to be 'pushing through the part of your mind' that says certain things, as the instructions you have claim. In Zazen, if you're sleepy or scatterbrained, you do 'sleepy/scatterbrained Zazen.' There's not a shred of experience-modification or involvement with appearances during Zazen, it's just a pure, non-reactive watching that can 'hold' the entire world of your mind, including your state, bugs, honks, and so on."
Meditation,3bpzu6,Sampajanna,2,Wed Jul 1 06:49:17 2015 UTC,There has been a video posted on this subreddit before of a zen monk giving zazen instructions. He basically just explains mindfulness of breathing.
Meditation,3bpzu6,Gojeezy,2,Wed Jul 1 08:16:07 2015 UTC,"Which video? I'd like to see it, if you can remember the name/lineage/terms.  If he starts people out on that, as many paths begin with mindfulness of breathing, that makes sense. So that zen monk could very well be teaching the beginning of a series which transitions. But if we're talking all of zazen being breath-mindfulness...that isn't zazen, that's more like an all-encompassing anapanasati.   That's not to diss anapanasati (I practice anapanasati), they're just different."
Meditation,3bpzu6,Sampajanna,2,Wed Jul 1 08:18:40 2015 UTC,Taigen Shodo Harada Roshi  He talks about counting the breath at around 15:25
Meditation,3bpzu6,Gojeezy,2,Wed Jul 1 08:36:55 2015 UTC,"This is very clear that the monk is breaking down preliminary stabilization/calming-exercises, as is typical in many paths:   The initial stages of training in zazen usually emphasize concentration, by focusing on the breath at the hara, often aided by counting...until there is some initial experience of samadhi or ""one-pointedness"" of mind. At this point the practitioner moves to one of the other two methods of zazen [koans or shikantaza].   It's the intro-part, as breath-meditation is for so many paths, so that the student can have stability and one-pointedness that can be used to learn the centerpiece technique. Zazen is like that. That's what I was saying before.  Starting at 7:10 of that video:   We could also say that the place of the awareness becomes the centre of the zazen [not just the breath]...However, even if the form is in order, if your mind is not in order, if your mind does not calm down [aka, the monk's about to teach beginners how to relax]...those who are used to it [zazen's shikantaza/koans], understand it, but for those who are not, it is difficult to understand.   For putting in order the mind, the formless mind, it is an important tool to put in order the breath [tool, not all of zazen], because by doing so we gradually lead the mind towards order, too [it's a simple principle of samatha, almost every path has an aspect of samatha].   This is an extremely typical and standard intro-samatha technique, counting/breathing, and isn't what Zazen is all about. Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo also taught this identical technique as the mini-step-one before the actual centerpiece technique in his tradition. Nobody is equating Dhammadharo's intro-step with his main technique.  Other Theravadins have also shared the same exact technique from your video, and OP's link and made it clear about its place:   [A]dditional devices to engage and hold the mind have been offered [just devices to calm, not the centerpiece]. For instance, there is (mental-) counting of the breaths. This can first be done in a slow pattern by counting each succeeding in and out breath as follows:  Inhale (count) one ... exhale (count) one  Inhale (count) two... exhale (count) two  Inhale (count) three ... exhale (count) three  Inhale (count) four ... exhale (count) four  Inhale (count) five ... exhale (count) five  Then return again to counting one-one, two-two.....etc., but this time continuing the sequence so that you end with six-six.  Repeat the sequence again, returning to one-one (and so on) but this time adding seven-seven; then back to one-one and then up to eight-eight, one-one then up to nine-nine, and finally, the completed sequence from one-one to ten-ten.  After completing a full sequence from one to ten, begin the cycle again as before, i.e. one-one to five-five and so on, until reaching one-one to ten-ten again.  When the mind is sufficiently steady, a pattern of more rapid counting can be used. This entails (mentally-) counting one with the inhalation and two with the exhalation. Continue this sequence until you reach five.   Then, returning to one continue until you reach six.  Carry on these rounds until you reach ten.  These counting techniques can be individually adjusted to one's own practice so as to achieve satisfactory results. One possible adaptation, for example, is to count from one straight through to ten and, having counted ten, return to one and start the cycle again.   All well and good, to me. Again, I practice breath-mindfulness. I just see no need to say that counting breath-mindfulness is a standalone zazen form; it's just what preps students for shikantaza/koan zazen (as breath-meditation preps so many students in other paths for their centerpiece technique).  My original gripe was that the link was presenting breath-mindfulness as a full-blown, standalone form of zazen, instead of an intro-part of zazen from which one transitions onward."

Meditation,3bpzu6,Gojeezy,2,Wed Jul 1 21:00:46 2015 UTC,"So maybe OP's link would be better titled, ""10 step guide to the first step of zazen"". lol  What is your understanding of shikantaza? Mostly insight? Whereas zazen is mostly concentration?"

Meditation,3bp1oq,nootao,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:32:30 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying. I think OP's post could be interpreted different ways. I took it as, in the context of mindfulness meditation, if it's more difficult some days to return to our anchor, we should accept that and feel good that we're being diligent with our practice anyway.  But now that I reread it I can see how it can be taken as ""just letting your mind wander when it's hard is ok"". I think there should always be some effort to return the focus to your anchor. Once you've noticed your focus has shifted, there's no reason imo to ever just sit there and not try to direct it back at all.  But maybe we're talking about two different types of meditation."

Meditation quality improves with consistency and that comes from sitting everyday no matter how you feel.

Meditation,3bp1oq,tryELI5,3,Wed Jul 1 03:09:40 2015 UTC,yeah i think theoretically we would all prefer quality over quantity - but the quality of meditation isnt necesarily in our hands. I get what you are saying completely.

Meditation,3bp1oq,nani_kore,2,Wed Jul 1 06:06:33 2015 UTC,"haha man you dont understand us :)   we are saying that while we all prefer quality over quantity- we feel that quantity is more important because it leads to better quality of meditation. If I take a two week break from meditating, my next meditation is going to be very bad. But if I do it constantly, twice a day for ten minutes then it is very likely that I will have a quality meditation each time. In other words, we feel quality of meditation is a function of quantity and consistency."

But consistency is entirely in our control, so it's the only thing worth focusing on."

Meditation,3bob8x,dipsta,5,Tue Jun 30 20:39:51 2015 UTC,"That's a tricky question, because we tend not to notice 'how long ' something popped up until we quit meditation: 'Ok, so meditation was giving me that stability that I don't feel right now, since I quit. Back on the horse I go!' In other words, you can often feel meditation's absence from not-doing-it more than you may feel the difference it makes while you're doing it.   Anyway. Started at 18, after reading a bunch of philosophy that did nothing but bum me out and then stumbling on a little book called 'Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind' that seemed to look at the same issues but without using thoughts to find relief. Been into it ever since then.   It helped me a lot mentally, but it took a long while until it transformed my actions. There was a long while where I was just the same-me but with relaxation and stability in the background. Now the background is closer to the foreground. The trip may take a while for meditation's  background relaxation/stability to come to the foreground, but the stops along the way are well-worth it too."

Im 23, about to be 24, and as far as I can remember my whole adolescence, including my young adulthood were constantly under the control of my thoughts. And these thoughts weren't just any thoughts; they were extremely negative. They were debilitating. Always trying to live up to certain ""standards"". It was overwhelming, and I had to live that way for many years.  I was never happy. Always dissatisfied and angry, and because of that I pushed many people away from me. I always had the desire in me to try to figure out why I was unhappy and to ultimately fix it, but everything seemed to be temporary. I would try so hard, too hard, to try to be happy. It was sad; I was sad.  I attribute much of my recent depression to my father passing away a little over 2 years ago. I was lost. I had a great girlfriend at the time who tried her best to help me through it, but my own hatred within spoiled our relationship. I pushed her away, broke up with her, and broke her heart.   Ive been meditating now for roughly 3 months and the benefits have been astronamical. Ive seen a real profound change within myself. A change from my roots. Im actually, sincerely happy. Meditation has been a god send. Something that I've needed for a long time.  3 months is nothing compared to the years and decades that people devote to this, but all I can say is that it's been an amazing ride so far and Im here to stay."

That's why along with meditation I've done a lot of studying into Buddhism and have really tried to peel off some of the layers of my emotions.  Look into Actualized.org. The man has helped me a lot. He has a ton of free videos on Youtube; just look up ""actualized"".   I see meditation as the basis of human growth. We must always come back to it to ground ourselves, but it'll take a little more introspection if you really want to see results.  And as far as meditation goes, don't let people complicate it for you too much. All you need to do is sit still, close your eyes or keep them open, and calm your mind. Oh, and work on mindfullness. It's very powerful."

Meditation,3bob8x,bihfutball,2,Thu Jul 2 13:01:09 2015 UTC,"And thats the absolute truth. Many of us try to change the outer aspects of ourselves and our lives without actually understanding them, and honestly I used be the same way.   Just look at people who work out and go to the gym religously. Im not saying its a bad thing, your health is very important and should be taken seriously, but some of us take it to far by getting too big for example. Because when you think about it you go to the gym to change your outword appearance because you feel that it'll make you feel better, happier, people will respect you more and you'll attract the opposite sex more. But thats not the case. If youre not mentally strong, you'll never have any of those things. And I truly believe that if you can conquer yourself, everything outside of you will be easily achieved.   If you have strong roots, then nothing can throw you off and bother you. As Bruce Lee said it, be like water. You'll sway with the negative things you come across, but they'll never bring you down."

I kind of only meditated when shit was going wrong in my life... which I definitely don't recommend ;)   But this time around it is so fucking serious. Back in March, my ex and I broke up and I was all out of sorts. It was no good. But the breaking of our relationship really forced me to look at myself and say, ""Who are you?""   I realized a few things:    I need to be cool with being alone.  I need to realize that my happiness comes from within and not external factors.  I need to pull back from things that are giving me anxiety instead of going to the source of anxiety to only create more anxiety (this works with only some situations. This isn't like, ""AH! MY ROOM IS DIRTY AND IT'S GIVING ME ANXIETY! Let me ignore it for another day to get rid of the anxiety."" This is like, ""Fuck. He hasn't text me back. LET ME TEXT HIM ANOTHER 15 TIMES TO ALLEVIATE MY ANXIETY!"")   Anyway, I decided to meditate every single day for the month of May. And I did. And then June. And now July. Every damn day.   I picked up a book called ""Natural Meditation"" and it changed my life. I felt the positive effects almost instantly. Just that total calmness and joy. And all of that came from within me.   Now I view life like we are on top of the ocean. There are waves at the surface. These waves hit you and knock you down. These waves can give you pure elation. But sometimes the waves make it difficult to breathe. It's choppy up there, you know.   So, what do we do? We sink. If we just sink a few feet below the surface of the ocean we will find that there is an infinite calmness. The boundless awareness within ourselves and everything around us is in that ocean. And the best thing is that we can always jump into that ocean whenever the water is rough on the top.   Long story. :)"

Meditation,3bop1x,Thefoundue,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:20:50 2015 UTC,"You heard about the importance of grounding. What did those folks define as 'grounding'? It's a very general word which just means, 'to make sure you've got a solid foundation under you.'  Some people say grounding to mean getting out of your head: the solid foundation of reality instead of your thoughts. Others say grounding to mean grounding yourself in the practice: the solid basis of practice and not the day-to-day mode we usually live in. And so on.   It's hard to explain the effects of grounding without defining it for us first. But extremely generally, people mean that it gets you out of your story and into the present reality. Sometimes people say this in the context of body-mindfulness, because it gets you out of your head and into the present 'aliveness' happening within. Others say it in reference to Zazen, because your eyes are open during Zazen (as opposed to the 'close-eyed' Vipassana techniques), and the rationale for open-eyed sometimes is that you're grounded by visuals that are real(er) than the blackness of closed-eyes that can induce daydreaming bigtime."
Meditation,3bop1x,Sampajanna,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:46:54 2015 UTC,"See I had heard that when you neglect grounding it leaves you less connected to reality and more in less physical dimensions, but allows for more energy flow/control/etc. and when you are grounded you are more connected with reality and the physical dimension, but less energy flows."

Meditation,3bnais,mirdellingpots,6,Tue Jun 30 16:21:24 2015 UTC,"""psychic powers"" is probably a clumsy translation of ""siddhi"" if that helps.  siddhi are specific abilities to control the functioning of the mind. they're not magic but they do of course seem very magical as they allow you to alter your perceptions.   for instance someone could develop a siddhi where by concentrating in a certain way they're able to make everything seem to them to glow very brightly. it's not a physical phenomenon where you could measure with a light meter the brightness, it's an internal mental phenomenon-- but it's still a powerful experience.  for another instance someone could develop a siddhi where by concentrating in a certain way they can cause everyone around them to feel really calm. this would of course be due really to unconscious posture changes or pheromones or something about the tone of their voice or whatever, it's probably not by magical energy waves except to the extent pheromones count as magical energy waves, but if you're not able to figure out the particular physical mechanisms and all you know is that putting your mind into a certain state makes the people around you start to act calm then it certainly feels magical.   so that magical feeling is what people are talking about when they start to talk all woo-woo. and as the book says you're free to ignore such things and probably should as they're um not real of course in a sense and thus can be very distracting."
Meditation,3bnais,mungojelly,7,Tue Jun 30 16:36:54 2015 UTC,"Walking through walls and flying are a couple of other siddhis reported over time. Must be some crazy strong pheromones in those cases.  The approach I prefer here is to simply admit that we don't know what the bodymind is, we don't know what a ""physical object"" is, and we don't know what this ""reality"" thing is all about. In which case, you'd still be absolutely right that there must be nothing magical about siddhis, but that becomes a statement reflecting how much we don't know, rather than a call to shoehorn anything that makes us uncomfortable into the tiny box of what we think we know.  Man, I'm really belligerent this morning! Sorry! :)"

We certainly don't understand everything, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be discerning in what claims we accept at face value, even from meditation masters. In regards to the flying claim, we have to ask ourselves what seems more likely: that meditation can give you the ability to fly, or that someone told a less than truthful story about their own abilities?  What we know really is a tiny box compared to what is possible, but if a claim means rewriting all of the most fundamental laws of physics, biology, and chemistry then it should have lots evidence backing it up before we accept it as truth."

Meditation,3bnais,vajra_bendy_straw,3,Tue Jun 30 19:39:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, psychic powers are in the suttas indeed. Here is one example from the Kevatta Sutta:   The Miracle of Psychic Power  ""And what is the miracle of psychic power? There is the case where a monk wields manifold psychic powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds.   Here's my policy, which I also incidentally use with 'karma:' as a practicing skeptic, I don't buy it in all its forms, BUT as a practicing agnostic, I don't make the false leap into certainty that it's false at all either. As long as we never fall into confidence that these things are false, we're fine. Just practice, and if you see such-and-such for yourself, then that will be your experience if and when it comes to pass."

Any of these phenomena are completely at odds with any scientific understanding of the world It would be extremely easy to verify their existence in the lab if they were true.   As a practicing Bayesian I am nearly 100% sure that these phenomena don't exist simply because every piece of evidence I have acquired points in the other direction.  It so happens that the more I learn about the world, the more I am sure that they don't exist; I couldn't have predicted that ahead of time, but it turns out there is strong evidence against this and other sorts of woo that people seem to invent."

Meditation,3bnais,Sampajanna,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:12:28 2015 UTC,"points in the other direction   We might be in agreement but using different definitions in the background of what we say. I'm not saying that I am simplistically agnostic, like 'gee whiz anything's possible, I'm going to ignore the basic principles of critical thinking, methodological naturalism, science, logic and all that I understand about  the apparent laws of physics, and so on.' I'm just saying, by example: I am an agnostic atheist.   What that means for me is this: theists have come to me with a positive claim about how the world works. Then, they take on a burden of proof for their claim. Then, after that defense, I have so far come away saying, 'Gee. That defense did not sufficiently bear its burden of proof in my opinion. Such an extraordinary claim was not met with extraordinary evidence or reasoning, to my mind. I do not put belief into that framework. On I go with my day.'  There's nothing extra needed in that process that requires me to claim, 'Therefore the universe has no (unfalsifiable) gods,' or 'Gee whiz maybe there still is a fifty percent chance that there is a god floating behind my back that I never see.' None of that is needed. I happen to think something like what you think, but those other conclusions arose from confronting other positive claims (about likelihoods, say, like the 'intelligent design' folks who talk about the likelihood of a 'designer' versus 'no-designer'). I am trying to share with you a more precise idea that I have about what it means to constantly, openly await evidence in a particular way--not supporting that silly idea that agnosticism gives quasi-approval to every unfounded phenomenon.   To bring it closer to us: I have been presented with many a positive argument for psychic abilities, and other things, and not yet felt there was sufficient bearing of their burden of proof in that instance. So I just say that I suspend belief in that proposed framework, not that I know the universe and it contains not-psychic-abilities.   I am also not trying to say, 'I'm now going to act as if it's likely that the world fifty-percent may contain psychic abilities.' I'm just saying, 'that kind of belief will go on the table when there's evidence that rises to my standards, end of story.' That has many consequences, when applied to all levels of a positive claim, and sometimes that attitude can sculpt a reasonable view of likelihoods in the process."

Oh, one note:   you're just too coy   Usually when I am with fellow skeptics and we discuss some of these things, we usually conclude that we agree, we shake hands, and then begins the post-discussion banter about how some of the group is essentially courageous because they say such-and-such like this, while the others are not. I think the skeptic movements require all kinds, as long as they're honest.   With that in mind, because of my style I've been called something of a coward or a pandering diplomat by people who prefer to be skeptic firebrands. That's their (expected way of putting their) opinion. I personally think it's really just a matter of our preferred styles/stances/quirks at a certain point of skeptical exploration of evidence.   I would chalk the point we're at right now up to my coy temperament (meaning I am just a reserved person by nature), not the kind of coy that hides important details or hides from confrontation (you can find plenty of heated, honest, undiplomatic confrontations in my comment history!).

Meditation,3bnais,phob,2,Tue Jun 30 22:49:33 2015 UTC,"A lot of people believe that texts within holy scripture like the bible for instance are not to be taken literally.  Like the writing about how Jesus fed thousands of people with just a few loaves and fishes.  Even many Christians think that this is more of a parable than based on reality.    Since many buddhist writings are ALSO written thousands of years ago, do any of you believe that these writings about walking through walls, walking on water, etc is simply ""just how it was done"" in those days regarding holy texts?    I guess my point is that almost every major religion seems to stem from a similar time frame (within a thousand years or so) and all of them discuss seemingly ""magical"" happenings, regardless of which religion you reference.    I guess what I am getting at is that I want to follow a certain path or group of people, for instance Buddhism!  But I always am unable to believe the unbelievable (in a modern perspective) and lose connection with those that are die hard believers.

I prefer groups that accept the suttas for what they are and thus don't even try to take on the Buddhist-brand while distorting scriptures into some full-blown 'Buddhist Secularism.' My preference is the openly secular, but Buddhist-influenced, groups that are based on the view from meditation teacher Shinzen Young, because Shinzen isn't like your average secularist.   He really, really has a grasp of the finer points of things like precepts and skillful action that are almost totally ignored or unaddressed by secular frameworks.

Having read this book through and through, referring back to it throughout the years, I can honestly say that, as a meditator, I was a skeptic. I do not simply believe in psychic powers because this book told me to do so; I DO practice though and the whole point of meditation is to seek answers and be a guide unto yourself.   So, if Bhante says down the line these phenomena will develop for those who seek to develop them -- it's probably because there are people who seek to do so and invest themselves in that way.  To me, it sounds like this brief mentioning of these abilities struck a chord with you, but all I can truly say is do not allow your prior beliefs to get you stuck somewhere. If you believe something doesn't, or does exist, does that make it so?   Best of luck on your travels!"

Meditation,3bnais,lost_lurker,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:34:40 2015 UTC,"Hi - Sorry for the delay.    Why are you insisting on only discussing subjective results?   Because my original comment to OP was precisely that subjective results are what actually matters here. OP and many people in this thread seem very concerned with whether or not psychic powers exist. (Or at least concerned with arguing that they couldn't possibly exist.) The meat of my comment was: don't be concerned with that question. It's a distraction. That question is what's off-topic.   (That's also, by the way, Bhante Gunaratana's instruction: don't worry about it for now.)    To elaborate:   We're in a culture that is infatuated with a flavor of metaphysical physicalism. There's nothing wrong with that family of views per se, but to be infatuated with it, or any solid view for that matter, is an obstacle in meditation. My suggestion to OP, as someone with more experience than he in this realm, is to recognize an attachment to a view, no matter how cherished, and experiment with loosening that attachment. See what happens.  And if it isn't obvious, the physicalist view can serve precisely the same role for overly-attached atheists as theism does for overly-attached evangelical Christians, who are usually portrayed as metaphysical opponents, even though they're both dancing the same destructive dance. Both views serve as points of reference for constructing and maintaining an identity, both personal and tribal. The tone of argumentation in this thread suggests that activity to me: tribal-identity maintenance by attacking what's perceived as an opposing view. This is totally understandable as a human thing to do, but it can lead to a lot of unnecessary aggression.  An antidote to that kind of view-identity recommended in meditative traditions, or at least I'll say an antidote in my experience, is to work with the impulse to compare subjective experience to any point of reference: teachers, science, parents, God's will for us—whatever. This is challenging because we all have deeply-ingrained points of reference in terms of views, judgements, and ideas about who we think we're supposed to be.  So while I was pretty reactive the other morning and probably not articulating things well, my overall point is: for the sake of meditation, don't cling to a view. Try to notice when you're clinging to a view and work with loosening that impulse. The more cherished the view, the harder it will be to work with, but also the closer you're getting to the meat of why we meditate to begin with.    Psychic powers? Sure I don't see why they couldn't exist. Is that what you wanted to hear? :)"
Meditation,3bnais,vajra_bendy_straw,4,Fri Jul 3 17:28:35 2015 UTC,"That's fine. But until you perform the experiment, you are not qualified to judge others' results. It would not be science to insist on a model of the world which you have yet to test via experiment. It would be dogma.   This is incorrect. We can objectively test psychic claims using science without the need of each individual on the planet verifying it. OP doesn't need to personally check if psychic phenomena is real through his subjective experience in order to be a ""scientist"". This would be like saying you have to get a cold to know if viruses exist."
Meditation,3bnais,phob,2,Tue Jun 30 17:35:56 2015 UTC,"I would suggest that subjective experience is the only evidence that matters when it comes to meditation. Otherwise, why bother? We don't meditate to publish in journals. Well I mean ... I don't, anyway.  The relevant question is: Does your experience of your self and your world become more open and free? If so, then what a scientist, or the Buddha, or your friend Larry says is completely irrelevant. If not, then hey, at least you did the experiment. But listening to a scientist or the Buddha or Larry and then calling it good is to completely miss the point.  With respect to psychic powers, it's fine to be skeptical. But I'd be wary of clinging to any dogma, whether theist or atheist. Science produces excellent and useful ideas about our experience but experience must always trump our ideas. That's the heart of the scientific method. That's what I meant by saying that OP is a scientist: you must be willing to let your experience trump your ideas about your experience. Otherwise, why bother?  ""Doing the experiment"" in the case of siddhis may mean years if not decades of dedicated practice and solitary retreat. I've practiced for only a handful of years and it's clear to me how our ideas about the world have very little to do with being in the world. I would be more surprised if siddhis weren't a thing, but whether they are or aren't doesn't change my basic human situation.   This would be like saying you have to get a cold to know if viruses exist.   The analogy is a little unfortunate but the point for us here isn't to know whether or not viruses exist. That's actually irrelevant. The point is to experience getting a cold. That is what's going to change us."

Well this is a little confusing because you're saying that a) for something to be ""science"" it must be testable, and b) the tests for psychic phenomena have revealed no evidence, therefore c) psychic phenomena are not ""science""?   I think you mean to say psychic phenomena are ""science""/(aka, admissible hypotheses) because there are tests for it, but that so far tests have not yielded evidence in their favor. Correct?  I think further what you really mean to say is that psychic phenomena do not fit into the generally physicalist world view that scientists tend to assume as implicit as they are doing their work. I agree with that.   Also personal observation does not count as science. Testing your observations and having others repeat your tests is science.   Finally, you are appealing to the working model of the contemporary scientific process as demanding peer review and repeatable results before a theory is generally accepted. I agree with that as well.  However, none of the things you're talking about here relates to what I was originally suggesting. If you're curious I invite you to read my other responses in this thread—maybe this one in particular—to suss out what I had in mind."
Meditation,3bnais,vajra_bendy_straw,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:46:27 2015 UTC,I'm saying that testing psychic claims is trivial. There are many that claim to have psychic abilities and none have provided any evidence. This doesn't mean psychic phenomena are not real but it isn't scientific to claim they are. Also observing phenomena without testing it isn't science. So to tell someone that they can't know whether these phenomena are real or not without personally observing it isn't science.  Believing in a hypothesis with no objective evidence is not science. Believing in a hypothesis in the face of evidence to the contrary is the opposite of science.  Edit: all I'm arguing against is your claim on science. I'm not arguing against anything else you are saying. Although I do disagree somewhat with the rest of your post but not totally.
Meditation,3bnais,lost_lurker,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:28:50 2015 UTC,"Edit: all I'm arguing against is your claim on science.   I think the only thing I said about science qua science specifically—instead of comparing something else to science as an explanatory device—was this:   It would not be science to insist on a model of the world which you have yet to test via experiment.   Which sounds an awful lot like what you said:   Believing in a hypothesis with no objective evidence is not science.   So I'm not sure what you're arguing.   I did not, as I have said many times in many comments, claim that psychic phenomena are unconditionally real, nor did I advise OP to believe in psychic phenomena without evidence. In fact my original comment was aimed precisely at encouraging OP not to believe things without his own evidence, as collected by doing his own ""experiments"". I compared the obligation of the meditator to witness her own subjective experience to that of the scientist who wishes to confirm the results of her colleagues. That is: you have to do the experiment.  It's hard to see how any of what you've said so far is problematic for any of what I've said so far.  I did, on the other hand, intend to imply that OP's beliefs about psychic phenomena are liable to change if he takes the practice seriously enough. But if that's all you're upset about, please read the comment I linked to above regarding what I feel is an unhealthy fixation on a (usually unexamined) metaphysical position which is actually quite problematic, philosophically."
Meditation,3bnais,vajra_bendy_straw,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:27:36 2015 UTC,"I'm arguing that OP doing the ""experiment"" by himself is not science. If for say he showed his friends that he could walk on water or see through walls then that would count as scientific. I agree that attachment to views is a hindrance but I also think that the scientific method although not perfect is the best method for settling claims that I know of. If OP goes really goes deep into meditation and starts thinking he has psychic powers he shouldn't just trust his own observations. He should try to verify them.  Basically the disagreement between what we are saying I think comes down to his subjective experience and how valid ones own experience is. I don't think ones own subjective experience by itself qualifies as science. I also think looking at how the world works should discourage us from believing in psychic phenomena. We should still be open to believing in them but only if the appropriate evidence is provided. Which hasn't been done."
Meditation,3bnais,lost_lurker,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:28:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think ones own subjective experience by itself qualifies as science.   I never intended to imply that it did. Seriously: I can't tell if you're trolling at this point. Am I being that unclear? Or are you that obtuse? I made a fucking comparison. I'm not sure what else to say.   Basically the disagreement between what we are saying I think comes down to his subjective experience and how valid ones own experience is.   Valid with respect to what? With respect to science, as typically conducted in our culture, I agree. But subjective experience—and only subjective experience—is where the action is in meditation, and if you think otherwise, I think you have a dysfunctional picture of what meditation is about. One that seems to demand that your subjective experience be constantly validated against an external reference point: probably some vague and reductionist notion of neurons and chemicals. That is a great way to make your meditation practice safe, sanitized, and mostly inert.  Now, comparing one's subjective experience in mediation against reference points is wise and sane. That's why teachers and a group of peers are very important. But at the end of the day, even a teacher guarantees nothing in the way of solidity or ""truth"". (Note well: neither does science.) And if reaching for external validation is an expression of clinging to a view—whether scientism or theism makes no difference—if that compulsion remains under the radar, it will be an obstacle to effecting the change I assume you are looking for by practicing meditation to begin with. As I said elsewhere: why bother?  I'm sorry if none of this makes sense to you. I hope it triggers some mote of curiosity. Good luck to you."

Meditation,3bnais,vajra_bendy_straw,2,Sat Jul 4 05:02:36 2015 UTC,"Experiments performed by yourself, on yourself are not good science. We have so many biases and expectations. ""I started eating lemons and my cold went away, therefore lemons cure colds."" This is what a lot of pseudoscience claims rely on. ""My horoscope came true one time, thus horoscopes must be accurate""  We also only have one data point (ourselves), which we can poorly measure. If you are genuinely curious if you can get magical powers by meditating, the best way would not just to do it yourself, but setup a double-blind trail, with a large and varied sample group and repeat that experiment a number of times.    Secondly, the claim ""Only after the meditator has reached a very deep stage of jhana will he or she be advanced enough to work with such powers"" isn't verifiable. If When the OP fails to achieve magical powers, one could claim that they just aren't at a ""deep enough"" stage of jhana.  “It pays to keep an open mind, but not so open your brains fall out.” ― Carl Sagan"
Meditation,3bnais,vajra_bendy_straw,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:14:49 2015 UTC,"No, of course: I get it. I'm not talking about collecting publishable results that are peer-reviewed. We're not actually talking about science. We're talking about meditation. But you can (and should, I think) approach meditation with the same premise of the scientific method: data trumps your ideas about the data.  In this case, the data is your subjective experience. At the end of the day, your subjective experience is the only data that matters. Which means that you have to perform the experiment. Any judgements made using only the reports of others is pure conjecture.  The analogy breaks down further—and now I regret comparing the two :)—because scientists are less interested in the data than in making the ""right"" model that fits the data. So: ""do psychic powers exist or not??"" is the issue for science.  That's not what meditation is about. We aren't interested in gaining the ""right"" model of our experience, but in the experience itself, with as little modeling as possible. Do psychic powers exist? The answer is irrelevant. The issue is the extent to which we can experience our psychic powers or lack of psychic powers without resistance.  However I do think a big part of that process—particularly for intellectually talented people—is being willing to let go of what you think about your experience. A skill which is also critical to the scientific project.   When the OP fails to achieve magical powers, one could claim that they just aren't at a ""deep enough"" stage of jhana.   Yup. And I'm not arguing (nor does the author) that one should try to answer the question of whether there are magical powers. It's irrelevant."

You can see the emotional stuff I'm saying in yourself too, if you want to explore it. For example, next time you're overwhelmed with emotion, check your face —namely the middle forehead and eye-sockets— and you'll find an unmistakable pulsation-pattern and a wave of heat that increases in intensity as your emotion intensifies, and dissipates as the emotion passes.   Fear that that emotion will return again can, ironically, creat an 'after-shock' or miniature version of the same wave."

Not every meditation instruction has an anchor, and some techniques that do use an anchor advise different things for when there's mind-wandering. What's your technique?  Here is my favorite example of an anchor-technique that talks about wandering, but doesn't tell you to return to your anchor immediately. From 'Mindfulness in Plain English,' by Buddhist monk Bhante Henepola Gunaratana:    Make the distraction a temporary object of meditation. Please [note] the word temporary. It's quite important... We do not expect you to adopt a whole new object of meditation every three seconds. The breath will always remain your primary focus. You switch your attention to the distraction only long enough to notice certain specific things about it. What is it? How strong is it? and, how long does it last? As soon as you have wordlessly answered these questions, you are through with your examination of that distraction, and you return your attention to the breath. Here again, please note the operant term, wordlessly. These questions are not an invitation to more mental chatter. That would be moving you in the wrong direction, toward more thinking. We want you to move away from thinking, back to a direct, wordless and nonconceptual experience of the breath. These questions are designed to free you from the distraction and give you insight into its nature, not to get you more thoroughly stuck in it. They will tune you in to what is distracting you and help you get rid of it--all in one step."

We just want to create a relationship of awareness and mindful, unattached observation towards our thoughts - whatever they are - and develop the ability to refocus our attention to the present at will when needed. :)"

Meditation,3bm743,S4tterbrain,29,Tue Jun 30 10:08:49 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that I'm a lot more tolerant and accepting of people now, but I can't make sense of how meditation might cause that? Can anyone help me understand? :)   I like Charlotte Joko Beck's explanation in Everyday Zen: ""Suppose we are out on a lake and it's a bit foggy -- not too foggy, but a bit foggy -- and we're rowing along in our little boat having a good time. And then, all of a sudden, coming out of the fog, there's this other rowboat and it's heading right at us. And...crash! Well, for a second we're really angry -- what is that fool doing? I just painted my boat! And here he comes -- crash! -- right into it. And then suddenly we notice that the rowboat is empty. What happens to our anger? Well, the anger collapses…I'll just have to paint my boat again, that's all. But if that rowboat that hit ours had another person in it, how would we react? You know what would happen! Now our encounters with life, with other people, with events, are like being bumped by an empty rowboat. But we don't experience it that way. We experience it as though there are people in that other rowboat and we're really getting clobbered by them.""  When you're intolerant of someone, you're comparing their behaviour with some idea you have about how they should act, and you are attached to that idea. Since their actual behaviour doesn't match your idea of how they should act, you feel their actual behaviour is somehow wrong or unjust.  For example, if someone calls you an idiot, if you compare that situation with one where they didn't call you an idiot, and you feel that imagined scenario is what should have happened, you will feel annoyed, like the person has wronged you in some way.   The key here is the idea they you think something different should have happened. This idea of what should have happened is your own creation, your own expectation. Making such comparisons is fine, but most people don't realise they've hold such expectations, and so, from their perspective, the situation appears to be inherently wrong. They're not aware that the judgement has taken place.  Through meditation, we learn to distinguish between what has actually happened and the judgements and stories we create about what has happened. We pay attention to the raw feelings and sensations, beyond our judgements about them. As that distinction becomes clearer, our judgements about people and situations don't influence us so much, because we perceive them as arbitrary rather than inherent properties of the universe.   So you might prefer that someone doesn't call you an idiot, but you don't think the person is somehow inherently wrong to call you an idiot, because you recognise any judgement you make as arbitrary, as your own creation, rather than an objective rule the people and the universe should abide by."

Meditation,3bm743,wisekernel,10,Tue Jun 30 13:32:51 2015 UTC,"Neurologically, research shows that regular meditation (especially types that get you focusing on what's going on in your body, be it emotion or other sensation) helps to strengthen and increase the insular cortex (also known as the insula). The insula is responsible for empathy and so, in general, more meditation helps to increase empathy which makes people more compassionate because it helps to feel what it's like from another person's shoes.   That said there are lots of meditations that help develop compassion too like tonglen or metta. Plus because we are social creatures we live relational lives and meditation often helps us deal with relationships in a balanced, nonjudgmental way which eventually has us face the idea that we have to feel and accept others too and then helps us through that process by helping us recognize our own attachments and aversions so we can let go and be more open to others needs. Essentially, if everyone is suffering and meditators have simply made more space to deal with that suffering we become more familiar with suffering and how it works in an objective way and then once we can see that we notice everyone else is still IN their suffering and subject to it and, having ""been there"", it is hard not to feel compassion for that.   Does that help?"

Meditation,3bm743,elphabaloves,2,Tue Jun 30 12:28:10 2015 UTC,"Meditation, done with proper instruction, helps break down the mental constructs that propagate a belief that we are distinct and separate from everyone and everything else. When those mental constructs are broken down, compassion is what remains as a natural state."

Meditation,3bm743,clickstation,2,Tue Jun 30 10:51:02 2015 UTC,"In some schools of Buddhism and/or psychology there is the idea that we are by nature compassionate and kind creatures filled with boundless love. But hard times and struggles causes us to develop mental habits and responses that we feel help us better deal with life. These habits, responses, and judgements  cloud and hide our true nature, and repeated use causes us to think this is our true self. Meditation slowly sculpts aways at the rough exterior to expose the polished purity of our true nature.  With this everyone is capable of great love and kindness but they do not know it, or lack the resources to help uncover it. Knowing this compassion comes easy, you're just a person who has started chipping away at some of this, but you understand where others might be now because you were once there, in the dark about your true self, you just happened to be open enough to learn/try, others might not be so open/ might have a thicker crust."

I don't know exactly how it would relate to empathy, but I suspect meditation's stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system also allows empathy to occur, especially if you normally live a hectic life.  Also, some of it could be placebo effect. When someone hears that meditation makes you more empathetic, they may consciously or subconsciously act more empathetic as they identify with the ""meditator"" role. Kind of like how some people (I've done this too, haha) act all zen when they get into meditation.  That's why when I talk to people about continual breath awareness, I urge people to not view it as ""meditation"" per se, because they probably have mental baggage around that term that won't necessarily help them get present."

Meditation,3bp641,kumhor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:57:04 2015 UTC,"One likes to think that there is a situation that will just 'click' with one's personality and make it easy to achieve great heights; but that's a fallacy and a fantasy. Achievement is gained in exact proportion to correct effort in correct method.  Going step by step up the mountain is how you get to the top. If you shift around to start another route up, that's fine, and you may have gained some kind of experience from the previous effort, but you are still essentially starting from the bottom and you are still essentially climbing step by step. These things can't be skipped.  And there are many correct methods. Of course, there are many more shallow or bad methods as well. So it is best to find a traditional, proven method, taught by a well regarded and achieved master — someone who has attained the fruits of the practice; if not the 'mountaintop', then at least 'high up and experienced in climbing'.  More important than style is the teacher. If you have the opportunity to study with a very stable and accomplished teacher, that is very precious, and you should thank your lucky stars for the opportunity. If you have the opportunity to study with a true master, that is exceedingly rare and inconceivably valuable, and you should not hesitate to do everything in your power to deepen your connection and follow their guidance.  Once you learn the practice and integrate it in your life, it will become an organic part of you. Then it will 'suit' you. Before you yourself integrate the practice by learning and doing enough, there is no style that will suit you. This is because the ego will always resist good practice. The self-image and the habit of preference don't want to go away, so they will dislike and resist. The integral being, however, loves the rigor and truth of practice — it comes alive! But only through participating, not by arranging and doubting and hedging bets.  That is not to say there is only one way to go about the search. You may indeed try out several different styles. It doesn't mean you will necessarily know any more (or less) than if you stick with one. You may try this and that, you may get confused, it may prompt a crisis, you may give up... and then you may be ready to start from a very good foundation.  Or you may stick with one style and teacher for a long while, until you start to feel the practice in your bones, and you may at that point feel the need to explore or seek more depth.  Most spiritual journeys are not all one way or the other. You may try one practice with different teachers, or you may read some books before trying, or you may have some fortuitous meetings with other students or teachers. Your travels may bring up new connections; your gains and losses in life may shift your priorities.  So in view of all this one may ask a very good question: what is the central point? What's the point of it all; what's the goal? That is a very good guiding question for you. Why meditate or do any spiritual practice, or anything in life? What is the central point?   All suffering comes from mind. As your mind goes, so goes your life. As our minds go collectively, so goes our world. We will certainly die. We do not know when we will die, but when death comes we will surely feel it comes too soon. At the time of death, none of our possessions, relationships, ideas, habits, awards, roles, or achievements can help us. The only thing that can help is the actual spiritual practice we have done in life: if we have acted with clarity and compassion throughout our life, we may have some ability to guide our mind at a deep level; but if we have acted with unclarity or selfish attachment for much of our life, the deep mind will continue in that vein, flailing about in unclarity and being enslaved to attachment (and thus creating the causes of ongoing suffering). Therefore, meditation is for the purpose of developing clarity and compassion, to awaken from the dream of life,and to save yourself and save all beings from going around and around in suffering.   If you keep that central purpose foremost in your heart, you will be able to distinguish between true spirituality and fake packaging."

But it also brings me to another related question, which was touch on in your reply: having a good meditation teacher. So far, I merely rely on books, guided meditation on YouTube and the likes and forums like this one. How essential is a teacher, considering I do a lot of research on my own?"
Meditation,3bp641,TheHeartOfTuxes,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:20:36 2015 UTC,"All great masters have emphasized the necessity and preciousness of a good teacher. One person among many billions may achieve enlightenment in this life without an external teacher, and that is only because in countless previous lives she or he has been guided and taught and blessed by other enlightened beings.  If one's aim is quite shallow, for example to lessen mental stress, simple practices can be done from a book or video. But finding one's way through obstacles, developing one's character, overcoming trouble in life, learning to relate with compassion, and helping others to be happy requires a training that goes beyond ego, beyond one's own blind spots and habits. Thus an external guide is necessary, someone capable of consistently holding the view beyond ego, and offering guidance when the countless stumbling blocks are encountered. There are many, many issues that one can't even conceive of when one first sets off on the path, much less overcome. The ignorance one starts with will be built into one's view and choices; a more achieved guide is required.  A good teacher...   gives correct teaching does not give incorrect teaching helps you understand the teaching, not only in your thought but in your experience guides you through obstacles corrects your errors nurtures you and your aspiration with compassion inspires and teaches with her/his everyday activity provides a living example of the attainment of the practice encourages through words, energy, and action reflects your mind flawlessly so you can witness it blesses you and grounds your agitated mind with his/her presence karmically links you with the path of truth creates opportunities for you to become more of who you really are"

Meditation,3bp641,TheHeartOfTuxes,2,Wed Jul 1 10:16:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know that there's one standard way. You try. You keep trying. It's worth it.  The most important thing is to keep visiting and clarifying the central point of your life: why meditate, why do anything? This takes repeated introspection, not just going around to this or that event. Throughout your life it is a question to be contemplated: ""what is my true purpose, what is the best use of my life?""  When this point is clear, you will know what to look for in a teacher. And on the other hand, a good teacher will help you clarify this point. A good teacher gives you back to yourself.  If you know some students of a spiritual teacher -- people who you respect for their straightforward and compassionate character -- that could be a good connection. Don't get taken in by talk of spectacular or strange experiences. Plain, practical kindness is a far better indicator of maturity. 'Consciousness hacking' is a juvenile and often arrogant diversion from true practice.  Seek out traditional lineages. These are streams of teaching that have been passed down from master to master, in which the teaching has been proven over time and the teachers have been checked and confirmed by other awakened masters. Modern inventions may have some benefit, but often miss very important aspects of practice -- the training is limited by the opinion, bias, and narrow view of the inventor.  Nowadays it is much easier to find information on training in traditional lineages: you can look it up online. Google your hometown name along with some keywords. You can also go to online forums where actual scholars and practitioners convene, like Dharmanet. (Check their 'friends' page, which I linked to, for a list of many respected teachers and writers.) The classified pages in magazines such as Tricycle and Shambhala Sun, Yoga Journal and Ascent and Om Yoga will also have listings for study opportunities. YouTube is another possible springboard for your research.  Also online, you can cross-check teacher names or centers for alerts about possible cult activity or other controversies. Here's one resource. The mere presence of controversy does not mean a teacher is necessarily bad or low-class; but it's good to go into a situation with your eyes open, and at least know what kind of questions to ask before you commit yourself on a deeper level.  Visiting an introductory meditation session, public service, or workshop at a local temple or center can give you an initial peek into their practice. You can dip your toes in the water, so to speak.  Some organizations have received almost global recognition and respect for their training; some of these initially center on a single teacher while others are community-based efforts.  I wouldn't make a suggestion without being asked, but I'm happy to provide recommendations if you want them. It would depend in part on your own interest, lifestyle, and beliefs (or your willingness to explore beyond them).  Good luck on the path!"

I think meditation can be used by anybody to increase not only their level of presence, but also their self efficacy. And if they're a baddy, then watch out!  The mere act of directing awareness has a lot of positive benefits for the practitioner no matter their moral bent. So a bad guy / someone who does not feel remorse could meditate for more focus and better sleep, and continue, refreshed, on his evil quest the next day.  Will meditation make a ""bad"" person less bad? Maybe, because meditation stimulates your parasympathetic nervous system, understimulation of which can make you freak out and do something drastic. Or it could simply be used by baddies to lower their level of overall stimulation, so they can better perform precision tasks (as taught in the military for that reason).  Then there's the question of whether anything is objectively bad, and whose moral standards we're judging by. But I won't tackle that one here!"

Anxiety seems to be one of the earliest and most significant reductions experienced from meditation, which should help in all areas.  OCD is anxiety. Fear of doing it wrong is anxiety. Even boredom is anxiety: anxiety that you could be doing or experiencing something better.

My back of the envelope estimate is if you are sitting three hours a day as a beginner, that is probably too much. As with everything else in life, take the middle way. Keep your sits to once or twice a day and up to a max of 30 or 45 minutes each.

I can achieve presence throughout my day, even as I do other stuff, with continual breath awareness. It's an active and deliberate process. The state it puts you in is powerful, in that it frees you from your conditioned responses. It's pretty sweet.  As to whether such a state is possible to sustain subconsciously / without effort, I doubt it. Achieving the state of no-mind is pretty unnatural in my opinion, although some people apparently achieve it. I view it like going to the gym, in that I have to keep up the practice otherwise I fall out of that state.  I started a channel about this practice and I post every day. Here is the intro vid, maybe you will relate. I hope it works for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRaV2kCdsQY"

If I'm ever in a state of frustration or stress, or anything negative, I just count my breathes - inhale 1 - exhale 2. In traffic or when I'm running late, it's crazy how fast things can go from 60-0 just by breathing. Yeah, I think the gym analogy really works in this case. Thanks alot! I'll take a look :)"
Meditation,3bm4wm,AtractiveYoungFridge,2,Tue Jun 30 19:23:36 2015 UTC,"By meditative state, what is your definition? Having no thoughts?  If so, that is not meditation. Meditation is accepting thoughts and allowing them to be without blocking them off or pretending they don't exist. Really feeling the emotions and thought trains attached to your being and then being comfortable in it. If you have that state, in a complete way, then that is very impressive for meditating only once a month and you surely would have amazing progress from meditating daily."
Meditation,3bm4wm,Gojeezy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:32:53 2015 UTC,"Thoughts would definitely pass, and the last thought I would have to all of them would be ""This is how it's supposed to be"" or ""Everything will work out the way it's meant to"", ""Don't worry about it, do what makes you happy"". Now that I think about it, I guess this would have been a change in perspective and state of mind, which turned into a habit itself.   So when meditating, fully relaxed, the mindframe and mindset I had before was what I should be aiming for? I spend a lot of time alone reflecting on things i've been doing on a week to week basis as well. I'm guessing I incorporate all the above into meditation, slowly and gradually."

Let me get this straight, research - if done right - is very important for our community, but it may not find its place on the main reddit hub about meditation.  I am a very no-bullshit person, just like many of you. Today, there is a big general incentive towards healthier lifestyles (among first-worlders). Gluten-free diet, veganism, you name it. As good as they all might be, it appears to me that we are currently swimming in various media pieces trying to explain to us why we should eat this and not that, sleep like this and not like that...  This alone turns me off. At this point, there are very few people on earth who follow a gluten-free diet that I might take seriously. It's like a religion, they want you to join their side so much. I say this because I know it is a turnoff for many other people.  Meditation is real. It's not a belief. It's the brain equivalent of going for a run once a week. We know that because of research. Do we need to go on to people's faces to tell them about it? I don't think so. People are linked to this sub all the time, newcomers trying to get a grasp on the concept. If they are anything like me, reading the frontpage of /r/meditation will turn them off almost instantly. We don't need to preach about this, just like we don't need to preach about running a 5k every Wednesday. Instead, why don't we focus on making this place as welcoming as possible? I'm not saying remove research articles from here, but maybe limit their visibility or presence somehow? What I l love the most from this place is when someone asks a question, and gets tons of upvotes and answers. That should be the face of /r/meditation.

Not exactly clear what sort of effects meditation really has...some people think its ""anxiety reducing"" effects have to do with a placebo effect of people taking action to change their lives. For sure, dry insight practice, aka mindfulness, is known to destabilize people in the process of tearing the attachments/defilements out of them. Maybe tranquility practices, but still, the path is nonlinear and the whole point is to uncover suffering at every turn. Most of the research focuses of very new practitioners. I might have recommended meditation to my friends-in-suffering once but knowing what I know now I would recommend meditation as a last resort and send them off doing a lot of cardio, more sleep, eating better, therapy, etc. as all better options."

Meditation,3bkatm,tom_wilde,4,Mon Jun 29 23:27:36 2015 UTC,"Having overcome paralyzing anxiety, I can tell you personally why it is so powerful: it's because the worry, when it repeats and we stop questioning it in the moment, becomes a mini nightmare of 'what-ifs.' The imagery really happens for a brief moment.   It's as if you did experience that worst case scenario, sometimes. And because it's so unpleasant, we think that worrying about avoiding it even more will help, but that just picks the scab even more.   A great thing that works for serious cases is body mindfulness. Why? Because it forces us back into the present (instead of 'what-if land), it grounds us in a neutral stimulus (your feeling of chest-inhalation is like a piece of cake compared to trying to be mindful of the nightmare), it gets us out of our heads, but it ALSO shows us the subtle signals of our emotions: sometimes an oncoming worry fest can be detected bodily, believe it or not. Once you get better at it, you'll be able to sense things before they spiral, or you'll have a safe place in your body while the spiral passes.   Good luck. Worrying, taken to some degrees, can feel like you're in hell or in the worst case scenario, again and again. It must be draining for you. It was for me (and is sometimes).  If you want some detailed instructions, I have books and guided meditations in mind if you're curious."

Meditation,3bkatm,theugandangiant88,5,Tue Jun 30 05:45:19 2015 UTC,"I overcame the paralysis-part, but not all of my anxiety is gone.   Most of my relief has come from lots of time spent in therapy, and lots of time spent doing systematic meditation with thoughts, where you do ab-so-lutely nothing to the thoughts but watch, knowing that it'll disappear.   It took me a long time, but, as one famous dharma teacher explained, eventually it feels like all thoughts are just thieves that ran into an empty house: they can't actually do anything, but we gave them so much power in the beginning that we have to spend some time unlearning that power.   Learning just how little power thoughts have over consciousness has to come from the inside though, there's no book that can convince us that thoughts are really that powerless until we see, over and over, how completely unaffected our seeing is itself compared to the thought we see."
Meditation,3bkatm,Citta_Viveka,3,Tue Jun 30 06:06:13 2015 UTC,"I especially love your last paragraph here. Before I started meditating I spent countless hours looking up articles on equanimity, & how to become less attached to my thoughts, emotions, & urges. For some odd reason I was very resistant to actually start meditating, but I'd convinced myself I could gain an equanimous mindset by just learning about what it entailed.   I was really naive to say the least lol. Now that I've been practicing for months, I can clearly see my equanimity developing in ways that simply would never have been possible without an actual, consistent meditative practice.   It's like how they say, no one can master a sport by reading books on how to play. They have to get out there and play. Knowledge is no replacement for practice."

We have conditoned our minds to worry about things to an extent that sometimes you worry for no reason but that reason is in your subconcious mind. Meditation lets you clean the subconsious mind and makes you aware of what is happening right now instead of clinging to the past or worry about the future. What is going to happen will happen; there is no way to escape that but worrying is destroying your present moment. So you are not living at all. Your shoulders are burdened with heavy weights of invisible worrying. Meditate on worrying. Look for it in your meditation. Deal with it head on in your meditation. Ask questions like ""where is this worrying coming from"" in your meditation. In the end you will just find that worrying was nothing but illusion."

I had a similar case of ""unwanted swallowing"" too -- was worrying about disrupting other meditators with the sound (swallowing is surprisingly loud in a silent group meditation). I found that if I allowed myself to swallow, the saliva factory would beef up production and I'd find myself swimming in a swallow loop.  what worked for me was just observing the swallow-suggesting-discomfort, as you would with any other pain or discomfort, and continuing with whatever technique you're practicing. This concept has been helpful to me when applied to simply sitting still: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhitthana  when applying this concept, it’s ok to move if pain becomes unbearable (or swallow if saliva discomfort proves too great), but I’ve found it profoundly simplifying to remove the possibility of fidgeting from the equation, as all sensations are more easily viewed in the same field (and you see them arise and pass away).

There are a few obvious things you will want to avoid when looking for your retreat. A yoga retreat probably would not be right for you, for example.   You should probably be fine with most Buddhist Vipassana retreats. Depending on the specific retreat there will be some ritual (chanting), dharma talks, and meditation instructions will depend on the specific tradition. Specifics will vary. Zen should also not be a problem. If you include those, that probably will increase the amount of choice you have significantly.  Since you like the Kabat Zinn-crowd, you might look up MBSR (Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction, Krabat Zinn's brand) retreats. I don't know about the cost of those though.  Oh, about cost, there is one retreat which will inevitably come up: Goenka retreats (easily googleable). Those are 10 day retreats and for first time participants they are completely free. AFAIK as a first timer you are not even allowed to donate anything.  So the price point is certainly an attractive factor about those retreats, and even though it's not universally liked (but what is?) it seems to be a solid, cheap, alternative to try out what it is like."

I don't have perfect posture, but can do it (and still meditate ;)).   One experiment you can try is - measure the amount of time you can sit in Lotus position. Even if it is one minute, it is Okay. Keep that up for 40 days. After 1 minute, you can change positions. In the next 40 days, go for 2 minutes. If you give your self believable goals, you will be able to do it (persistence is needed).   All the best,  Saurabh"

I've been sitting in half lotus and it feels like my legs and my back are compensating for my lack of stomach muscles. Why is my stomach not ""struggling"" like the other parts of my body?"
Meditation,3bjpkb,sleepycorn,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:45:24 2015 UTC,"If I can extrapolate from other types of muscle imbalances, it never will. It needs to be targeted specifically (ideally, in a similar way to the way you intend it to be used) to wake up your nervous system to the fact that the muscle should be used.  Muscles that don't activate when they should is a nervous system thing. Your body has just decided not to use those muscles. I have this in one calf--even after a run (toe-landing), that calf is not sore, since my body is somehow using other parts of the calf and foot. The point is, it's not simple and won't happen automatically, once the body has decided to use other muscles instead. It might help to devise an exercise that starts or ends similar to your target posture, but uses the stomach to get there. (But that's really a shot in the dark. The search terms for this sort of thing would normally be ""muscle imbalance posture"", but I don't know if it's too obscure to add ""half lotus"" into the mix.)"

I add L-theanine to my coffee and it prevents (or at least severely diminishes) jitters and restlessness caused by the caffeine, while preserving the focus and attentiveness.  L-theanine is a compound that's naturally present in green tea, which also explains why caffeine from green tea causes much less restlessness than the same amount of caffeine from coffee. As you observed, you can get the same benefit by simply switching to green tea.  The caffeine + L-theanine combination has been well-researched with positive results. I buy my L-theanine at Amazon."

I own an Aeropress and buy whole-bean coffee, grinding it just minutes before drinking. Living in NYC there are are some top-notch local coffee stores where I can get fresh, good-quality beans just a few blocks away. Also, there's more caffeine per cup so the effect is greater.  Based on most of the responses I got, I'd guess that many share my preference as well. That said, a cup of matcha is perfect every once in a while too.  If cost were my only concern, I'd take caffeine pills. There are even caffeine + theanine pills out there, too, but they tend to be cheaper separately.  (Note: My user name does not refer to coffee.

Meditation,3bif8b,sleepycorn,2,Tue Jun 30 16:01:00 2015 UTC,"I actually don't have any secret trick for avoiding addiction. As far as caffeine goes, the best way I've found to preserve potency and avoid withdrawal is the way everyone already knows about: only use it when you need it, taking a break from the drug when it loses its effectiveness.  The only reason I can think of for tea being safer addiction-wise is that it has a smaller amount of caffeine per cup, so is a more controlled dose."

Meditation,3bif8b,trotternama,2,Mon Jun 29 15:32:36 2015 UTC,"Caffeine in large doses has a huge impact on cortisol, the ""stress hormone"", so it's very common that too much caffeine can make you anxious and jittery. Green tea has significantly less, so generally just gives you a small lift to concentrate better.  Typically I suggest meditating without caffeine, partly because it can make your mind wander more, and also because you don't want to suck at meditation if you don't have access to it some days. Of course this is only from my experience and won't apply to everyone."

Meditation,3bif8b,xtpd,2,Mon Jun 29 16:03:40 2015 UTC,Coffee leaves me too jittery / edgy to enjoy my sitting as I normally do. I use matcha tea which has a good deal of caffeine and L-theanine which stops the caffeine buzz from being edgy and just provides the energy and alertness on a smooth level. I still drink coffee I just don't do it within about 3ish hours of wanting to sit.
Meditation,3bif8b,DinglebellRock,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:42:23 2015 UTC,"I second the theanine motion- it's a big advantage of tea over coffee.  However, I find the worst drawback of caffeine on meditation / being in the present state is when you come down off that caffeine. A lot of people don't realize they are coming down- they just feel tired, or irritable, or moody. When that happens, you don't have the mental energy to meditate, and so that's one of the reasons I don't use caffeine anymore.  For people who experience initial benefit from caffeine while meditating, I'd say that's the problem right there- it's a crutch, something that you'll come to need in order to meditate."
Meditation,3bhz39,Brainstorm95,4,Mon Jun 29 11:16:08 2015 UTC,"For specifically like that - Gregorian Chanting.  Some more good listening here...  Adi Shankara's Nirvana Shatakam - This beautiful song contains in capsule form the teachings of advaita vedanta, with it's use of negation (practice of neti, neti - not this, not this) to explain brahman and achieve liberation.   The story behind it is a bit crazy. Supposedly Shankara at age 8 walks up into the himalayas to find a master. When he encounters the sage who was to become his master, the sage asks the boy ""who are you?"" and Shankara answers with the Nirvana (or Atma) Shatakam. He was obviously excepted as a disciple after that.  Mahakatha's rendition of it is really beautiful. I could have listened to it all day long :). The translation is in the description.  Krishna Das has a lot of good chants and everyone seems to like him. Many are fast paced though and a bit of a different feel, and are done kirtan style with call/response. Jaya Bagavan and the Hanuman Chalisa are good one's to just sit back and listen to.  Qawwali - Sufi devotional music. More fast paced. Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan is considered The Man.

As part of my overall morning routine, I spend thirty minutes meditating (sometimes as few as fifteen if I'm up a bit late), thirty minutes for coffee and checking my websites, thirty minutes getting ready for work, thirty minutes for breakfast. Meditation is the most recent addition to my morning routine and it took time for me to get fairly regular about it. I sometimes skip a few days or fall off for a couple of weeks, but this is happening less frequently.   For me, the longer I go in the morning, the easier it is for me to find reasons not to meditate. In order to incorporate meditation, though, I did have adjust my schedule and start waking up earlier. Totally worth it. I've found that a regular meditation habit has helped to regulate my sleep so 5:30    doesn't feel early. Of course, I'm a married man with a tame social life so I can get to bed at a reasonable hour.

Meditation,3bhzzv,Hhahahahhhaa,6,Mon Jun 29 11:28:47 2015 UTC,"Is rational thinking acceptable in everyday life by meditation?   Meditation is not an authority or a rulemaker. Meditation involves the practice of concentration, awareness, acceptance and other factors depending on the style. None of these factors exclude rational thinking.  Meditative practice should help your rational thinking be more clear. At the same time it might help you realize when you are over-thinking a situation.  Not all situations call for rational thinking. For example, observing a sunset just for the sake of it.   And how to accept emotions but not let them run you behaviour?    Mindfulness meditation can help you with this.   Should I accept that emotions are always going to be there but not to be driven from them because I can not control them?   You will always have some emotional sensation in the mind. Meditation can help you regulate the reaction to them. There is nothing wrong with feeling or displaying emotion. Where people suffer is over reaction or chronic cyclical reaction to past or future events that are not important at the moment.  With mindfulness meditation you will come to experience emotion more intensely and intimately, but at the same time your reactivity will lessen and you will perceive more ""control"".   How can I achieve this?    Choose a style of meditation and practice it daily. Try for 10-20 minutes a day to start."

If I do go that direction I try to use the word non-attached or non-attachment, which often prompts a question for more explanation.  It is hard to tell how to word things on the internet!  I agree with your summary... remove attachments, but I go with the Buddhist terms skillful and unskillful instead of good and bad.

There's deep, tremendous wisdom in your emotions. They know what they are, and they're here to help you. They're not your enemies, they're very wise guides and holders of intuitive knowledge.  Instead of trying to control them, let them control you. Yes, accept that they will always be there, and give yourself some time and space to open up to the emotions that most unnerve you, that repulse you.  They don't need to run your behaviour in the sense that you don't need to start throwing bricks into windows, but you can sit down and let them all sweep in, say ""hi"" to them all, give space to them all and... above all... try not to favour some over others.

Here's my response:  What makes this question trick is that you're posing it in such a way that invites generalities, and there can really be none applied here. Both immolations were done by different people in different situations. There have been numberless suicides historically, each for a slightly different reason, proving a slightly different ""point"" if there is a point at all.  There are even some lines of thought that say that ALL deaths are suicide, viewed from a grander perspective, because the inner being, the larger Self, arranges for the life to end at such a time and place.  The only way it could be possible to ""evaluate"" someone's self-immolation is to be with them before and while they do it. Are they burning themselves to prove a point? To advance a cause? Well then it's ego-driven and creates karma, creates more unconsciousness.  It doesn't really matter how impressive the display of martyrdom is. It seems that martyrdom always comes with a bit of psychological baggage, some more us-vs-them mentality.  Have you seen Braveheart? William Wallace, played by Mel Gibson fights for freedom against English tyranny. Without giving away the ending to that fabulous movie, I will tell you he did end up as a martyr.  It's very impressive looking, but it ultimately conveys us-vs-them. Good guys vs the bad guys. This is ego-identification. This is unconsciousness. This is being trapped in illusion.  Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, I would say that there's no true ""Awakened Martyrdom."" It might be possible, it may have happened before, but I think most martyrdom is driven by unconsciousness.  Thanks for asking! That was interesting."

Meditation,3bigjq,Wollff,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:39:25 2015 UTC,"They probably meditated quite a lot. That might have played a role in what they did, and how they did it.   That's a stretch. I don't think you can assert that meditation caused them to self immolate. If that was the case you see a lot more meditators self immolating. Maybe one could make the argument that Thích Quảng Đức was able to sit with (apparent) equanimity while the fire blazed because he had cultivated that equanimity for many years but that might be the extent of it."

Stupid nonsense.  I don't want to tell anyone their Buddhism, but its stance against killing is about as strong as it gets: Killing is never skillful, unless it is the very last and only means to save many, and performed with the correct intentions.  So in both cases one will have a hard time to justify this suicide. Unless one brings a whole lot of political and religious glorification into the picture. Then it's easy. But then it's always easy.  I don't think there is much of a discussion to be had about that topic. As soon as one gets into actually interpreting Buddhist scriptures, there is little to be said. Just doesn't work AFAIK.  And when someone really wants their actions to be justified by a certain text, well, I am sure there is some way to do that. It's probably not interpretation anymore, but I am sure it can be done."

Meditation,3bibrv,peglegb,5,Mon Jun 29 13:37:09 2015 UTC,"You could meditate on your struggle to breath through your nose =P --to see what frustration might arise and how your mind and body react to a resistance outside your influence.   Honestly, meditation that focuses on the breath is just a technique that's been highlighted in the west as being effective. It's all just practice for applying that mindfulness during daily life. You can meditate doing anything. Why don't you look into walking meditation? Personally, my three favorite places to practice are while rock climbing, doing the dishes, and driving. Breath meditation is just easy for most people because it's a measured and repetitive action. You could try chanting mantras for the same effect I suppose?"
Meditation,3bibrv,tastytoast,2,Mon Jun 29 13:53:04 2015 UTC,While driving? Could you please elaborate?
Meditation,3bibrv,james_bond_junior,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:45:55 2015 UTC,"Well, if I'm feeling particularly agitated by daily activities, or the act of driving, I will turn off my car audio and take some time to experience the drive itself -- to notice how I'm driving in relation to those around me and how I am reacting to them in turn. I typically carry a lot of tension in my belly and my shoulders. So I let my focus drift to them, why that tension is present, how it is affecting the present moment of driving, and to let that tension release just as I would while sitting -- for example: to recognize that it is originating from clinging to past grievances (jerk just cut me off) or expectations of future events (must drive fast so as to avoid being late). Metta practice (loving kindness) is extremely easy to try, though not as easy to employ when another driver threatens your life with their inattentiveness. You cannot always control the situation, but you can control how you respond to it.  Essentially, all I meant was that, while doing anything, you can use that activity as the focus of your meditation-- to drink in the act fully for what it is rather than what you expect it to be or to have been. Be present. As Ram Dass puts it: Be Here Now  Hope that helped answer your question =)"
Meditation,3bibrv,tastytoast,2,Mon Jun 29 15:19:01 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! There are a lot. In fact, I find most of the meditations Ido are not primarily focused on the breath (though the breath is often part of it). First, know the breath is simply an anchor and so you can chose to use something else to ""anchor"" you (or to come back to from time to time if you get off track). For clients who have significant breathing issues, for example, I often suggest the feeling of their feet against the floor as an anchor.  Other meditations you could try can include body scans, grounding visualizations, expansion visualizations, internal or external awareness meditations, tonglen and metta or other compassion meditations, immersion meditations, or others. I have a channel with a bunch of free guided meditations so feel free to let me know if you care for the link (otherwise I don't share it as I don't want to be self-promotional about it, only offer it to help). You can also search for some of the items I have suggested above on YouTube and just find a teacher that works for you :)  Also, I agree with tastytoast that you could also use the struggle as a teaching tool and examine how you relate to it and what comes up for you around that struggle. Forgiveness meditations, meditations in impermanence or letting go, or ones just focusing on how we relate to attractions and aversions can all help with that :)"

I guess if you're accustomed to guided meditations, though, that constantly refer to the nostrils and you've long been breathing through your nostrils that it could be a little frustrating.  I've long been accustomed to ignoring the specifics of how to breath and instead focus on how I am breathing. It's kept me alive this long!"

OP, you will never be happy until you:  a) Admit to yourself that what you did was wrong. This means no more excuses. No more blaming the woman that was posing as a 13 year old girl. No more blaming who you believed was a 13 year old girl for ""initiating"" the conversation about sex. No more blaming your attorney for not getting you off. No more blaming the state for convicting you for a sex crime, No more pretending you were trying to ""protect her"" from pervs like you on the internet. You need to accept that you were wrong, and you did something that was both illegal and immoral.   b) Accept that only you are responsible for your actions. Nobody forced you into that chat room. Nobody forced you to continue the conversation once it turned to sex. Nobody forced you to go to that girls house. Nobody forced you to say the things that you did. You have to accept that.   c) Think about someone other than yourself. This is likely not the first time you have engaged in explicit sexual conversations with a minor. Stop making this about you. You could have severely emotionally damaged a young girl, and you are complaining about being punished for it.   d) Work to change. You don't have to be this way.

I would try to do anything that puts you in positive communities (not just meditation, but anything that puts you around positive people).  And when you get there, GIVE. You've been dealt a hard hand, but GIVE as much as you can by staying positive around others, making others feel good even when you want to break down, asking others about their stories and really listening with the goal of helping them. It's good to be congruent to your emotions, of course- but focus on doing good for others, and staying positive, as hard as it might be. Ask, how can I give more of myself today? And expect nothing in return.  Also, beware the self-image you have developed around being victimized. As unjust as people have been to you, it doesn't serve you well to ruminate on it. These mindsets tend to be self-fulfilling and self-perpetuating. ""I am responsible for my situation"" is an empowering mindset to have, even though, of course, some things are completely outside of your control. You may even consider a new username (""nnarmstrongreborn"").  Don't judge yourself for having a hard time meditating. Remember that when you do meditate, you are successful if you put your attention back to the breath. You WILL fall off of it, everyone does, so just come back.

The best—indeed, the only way to counteract them is to intentionally generate pleasurable impressions. This is considered preliminary to meditation but it sounds like you're not ready to restart meditating anyway.  A common and very effective way to generate positive impressions is by chanting. You can chant a mantra that you have faith in, or even simply chant ""Happy, happy, happy."" I know it sounds simplistic, but it really works!

But this is what comes to mind:  If you're still seeing a therapist, you obviously need to talk with them about the memories that are coming up and troubling you. Meditation doesn't work to supress these things, but will help you to deal with them in a new light. Given what it is you're dealing with though and your (previous/current ?) condition, having support to deal with it all is also going to be a good idea.  What do you have to work with? Do you have a phone that can play mp3s? Do you have any money to be able to buy yourself a 2nd hand ipod that you could load some guided meditations onto? It sounds like guided meditations might help, so that they could keep your mind occupied and stop it wandering onto your distressing memories.  Depending on where you are, you might be able to find a group that does free meditations, whether at a local spiritual centre/temple/etc, or through something like www.meetup.com and searching for meditation groups in your area.

Yes, that was bullshit. Not only was the bullshit, that was obvious bullshit.   I always get a little annoyed when some wonderful daily mail like media outlet then unpacks the frowny: ""REVEALED"" headline, and pretends that there are some shocking new developments, when nobody is really that surprised.  Everyone with some solid meditation experience probably could tell the daily mail that meditation always had some risks. I get the impression everyone knew. It's only now that scientists are beginning to look more closely at the topic, and before scientists don't send you a press release, you can't put it in the paper, it seems.

Meditation,3bix1r,millarm12,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:31:30 2015 UTC,"Hey Millarm,  The purpose of meditation is awakening. In this context, we mean awakening in that you can reclaim the inherent peacefulness in one's moment-to-moment existence.  Whereas most people meditate while sitting cross-legged on a pillow, it's possible to be meditative in any activity at any time of day as long as you bring your attention faithfully back to this moment, again and again, until it can stay HERE on it's own.  It's great that you're getting into meditation, but be careful about turning it into something that helps you continue to feel bad about yourself. Either meditate, or don't. Do it once and then not again for three weeks. Either way there's no problem.  At a future time, you'll be driven to your meditative practice again and again until you can find the peace that is impossible to achieve on the level of actions and accomplishments.  You don't need will-power to meditate. Just sit down and breathe easily, keeping your attention on your breathe, and bringing it back every time you realize that you've been lost in thought.  You're going to do great. Good luck!"

Pick either a physical sensations (e.g: the rise and fall of the abdomen, the breath passing through the nose, the breath passing the tip of the nose, etc... ), a mental concept (""in"" and ""out"", or a point in space that the breath passes, or the process of the rising and falling of the abdomen, etc... ) or both.

Meditation,3bftpe,muhelos,4,Sun Jun 28 21:33:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that is an accurate assessment. I used to feel this way, but the more I practice mindfulness the more I question it.  Who has a choice?  Lets say an unmindful person has options A,B and C. Which one do they take?  Lets say a mindful person has options A,B and C. Which one do they take?  If you are saying that the mindful person has some ""you"" inside that was obscured by mindlessness and now that ""you"" has a choice because they are mindful then where and who is the you that is now choosing? Where were they when they were not mindful?  In the end, a choice is made, something happens regardless right?. Isn't it that we feel more like we are making a beneficial choice, or that we are more aware of the choice being made? Perhaps with a more calm and aware mind the choice that is made is more conducive to suffering less.  I'm just not sure I'd say that we have a choice with mindfulness but no choice with mindlessness. It seems more like as a being we just make better choices when we are calm and aware.  What do you think? Am I wacky?"
Meditation,3bftpe,allthehobbies,3,Mon Jun 29 03:35:13 2015 UTC,"We definitely have a choice both ways for sure. It's just that the mindful person is able to RECOGNIZE that they have a choice - even in the midst of the urge. An unmindful person would likely get the urge and act on it immediately without even thinking (or if they were really determined, try to fight against it through white knuckling, but that usually ends in giving in anyway due to the emotional energy thats exhausted when you fight against your feelings).  I read in an article that in the unmindful mind, the quiet observer (the ""you"" that does the watching) is for the most part ""asleep"". Mindfulness wakes up that observer so that we can become one with it. The mindless mind on the other hand is pretty much a slave to the monkey mind."

I'm inclined to agree with you though I do think your view does exclude the distinct feeling of 'not thinking in the moment'. Mindfulness allows one to grab their thoughtprocess and apply it to CURRENT events instead of floating somewhere in the past or future. My question is.. Can a person really make a choice if (s)he does not consider the options?"
Meditation,3bftpe,allthehobbies,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:57:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand what you are saying about ""not thinking in the moment"". I understand some concepts about empty mind and mental chatter calming down, but I'm unsure how it relates to choice in this conversation.  About applying the thought process to the current moment - I agree there.  In regards to your question, I have asked myself the same. My current thought is that it depends on your definition of choice. It is surprisingly hard to define. My personal feeling is that ""choice"" takes place whether we are aware or not, whether we consider options or not. I feel that in a calm and aware state we perceive the processes happening more clearly and that our minds in a calm state make choices that lead toward less suffering."
Meditation,3bftpe,allthehobbies,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:28:59 2015 UTC,"Hmm I see what you're saying. Maybe then, there should be a distinction between ""intentional choice"" versus ""automatic choice""?"
Meditation,3bftpe,Gojeezy,2,Mon Jun 29 19:35:28 2015 UTC,"That may be a practical distinction. Philosophers and scientists alike debate what it is that chooses in the brain and when a choice is made. Intentional vs Unintentional or Manual vs Automatic could be helpful in at least pointing out the perception or how it feels to choose when aware. It is debated what may be intentional or not. One confusing element is the relation of the environment and circumstance to our choosing. We don't choose in a vacuum.  Given the option between candy or vegetables, mindless allthehobbies will probably choose candy. Mindful allthehobbies will probably choose vegetables. But not always, what if I'm tired? What if I just drank a bunch of water? What if I already had candy earlier? What if my hormones are at such and such level? What if I was just chased by a rabid dog and I have adrenaline fatigue? What if it is hot vs cold out? What about my religion? What about learned behaviors from upbringing? What about genetics?  All of what we are made of and how we have lived and the data we take in on a daily basis is taken in and computed either subconciously or conciously and then a decision is made whether we are aware or not. Even when aware, the options we have and the choice we make is still dependent on a thousand factors outside ourselves.   A choice can certainly feel intentional and that is probably the most practical way to differ it from a choice we are not so aware of making.  It is funny though, we don't really know who made the choice. I mean, this body was involved, but it was only a small part of the whole process.   Sorry for the rambling! I'm in a pondering mood."

It made me realize how many times throughout the day I get the urge to make coffee or tea just for the hell of it.

Meditation,3bftpe,SamuelColeridgeValet,3,Sun Jun 28 22:10:12 2015 UTC,"In meditation, even the most basic urges can be intercepted. That's why I believe in moderate fasting before an extended meditation, because in a highly mindful state you can begin to see through the control that these reward mechanisms have over us, and as soon as you drop that feedback loop of ""I'm hungry - I should eat"", your hunger ceases. Then you can go through the same process to gradually liberate yourself from seeking tactile pleasures, approval from others, mindless entertainment, and other distracting attachments."
Meditation,3bftpe,Tokentaclops,4,Mon Jun 29 07:37:10 2015 UTC,"When I started, I noticed that people would often mention the dishes, that you can be mindful washing the dishes.  I've come to the conclusion that it's easier to be mindful while I'm slowly, carefully washing the dishes than while I'm sitting and meditating.  Activity brings your attention to your senses.  There's something calming about slow activity, as opposed to reckless, careless activity.  My theory about why this is good for reducing stress is that emotional self-regulation is like a man sitting at a console like the one Homer Simpson sits at, working at the power plant, with dials and buttons that register changes and effect responses of the autonomic nervous system.  The man does a better job if the room is well lit, and if the room is too dark, mindfulness is like putting in a good light bulb."

Also, I don't think mindfulness involves a lot of decision-making.  It's an interesting question."
Meditation,3bftpe,G8_TGR_BULLSHARK,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:22:56 2015 UTC,"Yes! Mindfully washing dishes or doing any other basic manual tasks, slowly and with intention can be very meditative.   Speaking of which, I highly recommend the book ""The Practicing Mind"". It's centered around the idea that focusing on taking mindful, present-moment action towards or goals, is the best way to go about achieving them. Not thinking about the end point - but instead bringing our attention towards each little action we're taking, and the moment-by-moment sensations that we experience as we pursue that goal."

Meditation,3bftpe,ihaphleas,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:23:33 2015 UTC,True. But those habits are chosen intentionally by the monks because they are conducive to their lifestyle. Also they are carried out with intention and purpose. I'm talking specifically of habits we didn't intentionally choose and that direct our lives in negative or unskillful ways. Impulsive ones. Addictive ones.   I see absolutely nothing wrong with having chosen daily routines or rituals. That's not what I was referring to lol sorry if that wasn't clear!  edit: What Bad_Bishop said. Lol.

Remember that there is nothing inherently wrong with checking facebook, eating cookies, and wasting time on the internet. It is totally possible to be mindful while doing these things and in fact I encourage you to do so because it makes everyday stuff like this more enjoyable!  The desired result of being mindful in everything you do is that by consequence you won't get sucked into mindless action like wasting 3 hours at work without realizing it, but again the act itself isnt necessarily something you should avoid and it is totally possible to perform the action mindfully. Its a little paradoxical in this way!    Also, remember that being mindful is definitely not like ""taking back the reigns."" In fact its accepting that you never had reigns to begin with!"
Meditation,3bftpe,isogram,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:56:26 2015 UTC,"Oh I wasn't suggesting there was anything inherently wrong with those behaviors. It's up to us to decide what behaviors we value taking and which ones we'd rather not take. For a lot of people compulsively checking Facebook or eating without thinking when they aren't actually hungry, are behaviors they'd rather not continue because of the consequences (wasted time, mental overload from social media, stomach ache, weight gain). So I was just using those as examples of behaviors that a lot of people (not all) perform only as a result of mindlessness - in that if they were being mindful, they'd be more likely not to make those decisions because they aren't decisions they actually would want to make if not for the impulse. If that makes sense lol.   And by taking back the reigns I meant how we react to emotions & the actions we choose. I think mindfulness definitely allows people who previously acted impulsively on their emotions, to take back the reigns on their behavior much more and actually make decisions that are more conducive to their wellbeing if they choose, instead of automatically following any urge, emotion, or thought that comes to mind."
Meditation,3bftpe,ihaphleas,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:49:36 2015 UTC,"The way I see it is that there are two systems in human thinking, the automatic system and the reflective system (See the book Nudge for more info).  In brief, the automatic system is pleasure-seeking and unthinking, ignorant of long term consequences, kind of like Homer Simpson. The reflective system is deliberate, thinking about every choice and making logical, rational decisions, kind of like Spock.  We can tame the automatic system to better serve our goals through building good habits and ceasing bad ones. But mindfulness is training yourself to actively defy the automatic system, making the reflective system encroach on its territory, overriding its decisions."
Meditation,3bftpe,ihaphleas,2,Mon Jun 29 12:21:28 2015 UTC,"Yes! This is exactly how I see it too. And I've read many sources that suggest that our automatic system and our reflective system (what I've heard referred to as the executive system) are actually seated in two different areas of the brain. Our executive function sits within the prefrontal cortex (the part of our brain that gives us evolutionary advantage over other animals & allows us to be self-aware). And coincidentally, this is said to be one of the major areas strengthened through mindfulness meditation :)"

Over time thoughts may diminish, but I don't think it is possible for them to go away completely forever. What might work better is to observe your breath, by focusing at the entrance of the nostrils, and just bringing your attention back to that as soon as you notice it has wandered away. That way the breath is a focus point and rather than trying to avoid something (thoughts) you are focusing on something which will take you deeper into yourself."
Meditation,3bhi6m,macrophone,3,Mon Jun 29 07:02:27 2015 UTC,"Willpower is a muscle that you train. Meditation is a way of training it. The first obvious way it helps you is by making you less prone to procrastination. I've found this to be true with me.   Meditation always trains focus. It has made me painfully aware of fragile attention can be. I never multitask. Meditation helps me to be in the zone. To be immersed, to not let my mind follow tangent thoughts (even when those are more or less related to my object of focus). I choose a direction and point the focus to it - this is the scenario I work towards. Laser like focus: highly directed, high power.   Of course, this is just two ways meditation helps in the area you specified. There is research relevant to both these things (and many others), but I don't have sources handy on the phone.   Now, if this encouraged you let's talk of  your procrastinating the practice. You have to build willpower to not procrastinate. When I first started I meditates early in the morning. I found that if I let my practice to later in the day, I was less likely to meditate (the rest of the day had already been tapping into it). Currently, I wake up, do some quick yoga (10min just to get the blood flowing) and then meditate. It comes easier to me why my body is also in the right mood. And I meditate again at night as part of my shutdown routine, but I started that a long time after I started meditating.  Build habits. You to make your going to practice is as effortless as possible. What I mean is if you know something will make it harder to actually practice remove it out of the way or change your practice to some other time. With time and practice it will become easier to actually do whatever you want when you want it.   Now, go sit!"

The mind has a tendency to alight where is wishes, and keeping it focused and disciplined on the object can seem difficult. The success is the recognition of this deviation and to bring focus back to the object. The skill is able to keep the mind focused and not wandering, and over time this concentration becomes stronger."
Meditation,3betwp,numbersev,3,Sun Jun 28 16:18:23 2015 UTC,you need thoughts in order to learn to meditate. once thoughts intrude you retrain your focus.
Meditation,3betwp,xoxoyoyo,8,Sun Jun 28 16:20:26 2015 UTC,"There is no ""supposed."" Find a set of instructions and follow it :)  As long as you follow it, you're good!   You have conscious thoughts? Follow the instructions. Subconscious thought? Follow the instructions. Pure bliss? Follow the instructions :)  If ""following instructions"" put a bad taste in your mouth, think of it this way: do it one step at a time. Left foot forward, right foot, left foot, right foot. No matter what you see on the road, the walking is what you're supposed to do, not the absence/presence of things on the side of the road."
Meditation,3betwp,clickstation,3,Sun Jun 28 16:13:01 2015 UTC,"set of instructions   To be fair, maybe they are following the instructions but the instructions are too vague for this person. Sometimes we just need to find some way more precise instructions/teachers.   I also see users give really vague instructions to other users about breath meditation and I just know it'll be tough for that beginner (I've done this also myself, surely):   ""OK beginner, when your mind wanders, just notice you're distracted, and then...Uh, become interested in your breath again. Yeah that's it!""  ......?   What the hell, how do you just 'become' interested, the beginner thinks. And so on.   I think the underrated key is to find precise instructions or dharma talks. Those can be kinda hard to find, but boy, it is totally worth it to keep searching, because once we find a very clear dharma talk or set of tips, things fall into place much faster."
Meditation,3betwp,Sampajanna,2,Sun Jun 28 16:56:06 2015 UTC,"So, which precise instructions or dharma talks would you recommend? Any podcasts, or (audio) books like that?"
Meditation,3betwp,Necrowizard,2,Sun Jun 28 20:16:32 2015 UTC,"There are many precise instructions out there, so I'd have to narrow it down regarding you and your desires; just like precise work-out plans are out there, the right plan depends on what you want to 'work-out.'  There are precise instructions for concentration, 'mindfulness,' resting-as-awareness, loving-kindness, and much more, my friend.   What is your goal, what are you trying to develop or which technique(s) are you trying to find precise instructions for?  Cheers, looking forward to the possibility of helping."

Meditation,3betwp,clickstation,2,Sun Jun 28 17:02:11 2015 UTC,It's realizing the thoughts are not you. You are what becomes before the thoughts.
Meditation,3betwp,Sharkhumanfusion,2,Sun Jun 28 17:20:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, watching your thoughts is a great place to start."
Meditation,3betwp,DroopysNumberOneFan,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:17:33 2015 UTC,"I'd say it kind of depends on what you consider ""thought"". Meditation certainly is not the absence of any mental phenomena. If you eliminated all activity in your brain, you'd just fall unconscious and/or die. For me, personally, I always start by trying to stop my inner monologue. A specific kind of thought that seeks to narrate and categorize everything. Once I achieve that, I loosen my active suppression of mental activity to allow thoughts to, as many introductory texts call it, ""pass by like clouds."" Thoughts then become simply a phenomenon like any other. You hear a sound, you think a thought, you see a cloud passing by, it's all the same. There is no use in trying to block all that out - instead, try to observe it."

Meditation,3betwp,immortalvibe,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:14:40 2015 UTC,"am I supposed to be in a state where my only thought it on my breathing?   Yes, even then you don't need to be conceptually thinking about a sensation in regards to the breath. Instead, you only need to be aware of that sensation.  For a beginner it is much easier to conceptualize concentration and mindfulness through ""noting"" though.   Any thoughts that wander from the intended object of concentration are considered a hindrance to mindfulness.   Or are subconscious thoughts supposed to be a part of the experience?   To me, ""subconscious"" means that you are not consciousness/aware of them. At first, the more you meditate the more wandering thoughts you will become conscious/aware of. You just need to treat these as you did all others, by returning your focus to your intended object of concentration.  If by ""subconscious"" you mean wandering from the intended object of focus, then yes these are part of the practice of building concentration but they should be discouraged and the longer we can go without having wandering thoughts the better our concentration is."
Meditation,3betwp,Gojeezy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:48:25 2015 UTC,"Depends on what meditation philosophy you adhere to. IMO, no thought is impossible and myself (and seemingly most people in this sub) subscribe to mindfulness which is, basically, focusing on the present moment usually via focusing on the breath"
Meditation,3betwp,EatATaco,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:50:33 2015 UTC,"Not in my opinion, but there are a lot of opinions out there.  To me, meditation is just about developing our relationships with ourselves by noticing and acknowledging how we relate to the world. That can involve thinking at times but the silence reveals a lot too. Does that help?"

Meditation,3bg5ic,adannytoremember,6,Sun Jun 28 22:52:04 2015 UTC,"As a beginner I meditated lying down, right after waking up. It was easy for me to do without falling asleep because my body automatically wakes up early by itself.   But once I started doing it upright in a chair, I noticed it was much easier to focus. I do it sitting criss cross on my bed now and I prefer it most :)  So whatever works for you and allows you to be alert & comfortable."
Meditation,3bg5ic,nani_kore,3,Mon Jun 29 01:57:25 2015 UTC,"The  muscles will develop as you sit. You don't need to force pain, but it won't be doing you any favours by avoiding it all together. Ease in and it'll get easier with time.  If by two minutes it starts to get painful and not just sore, stop at 2. After a while move to 4 or 5 minutes.   The ideal is a straight spine, stable, but relaxed. It's not easy so don't worry about it too much, meditation is about the mind. A stable body will just make concentration easier.  You might want to play around with the position, too. I stack a couple pillows on a folded blanket, it's around a foot high uncompressed,  pretty high by most standards.  But I'm able to feel stable in that position so that's what I do. It might take some play to find what feels right.   Best of luck."
Meditation,3bg5ic,Beard_halp,3,Sun Jun 28 23:57:00 2015 UTC,"Get used to meditating sitting up, make lying down a novelty. It will benefit you. Being able to meditate while you wait for the bus, in the lunchroom at work, etc is a lot easier without lying down. Being vertical also helps a lot with alertness. You want to be alert and aware when meditating, not drifting off into the void."
Meditation,3bg5ic,luthis,2,Mon Jun 29 03:43:41 2015 UTC,"It's ordinarily preferable to keep your back straight in order to allow the kundalini to flow.  But if it's not possible without discomfort, than any position is fine. Some teachers recommend not lying down lest you fall asleep. But if you think you can stay awake, then there's no other problem with meditating while laying.  Luck!"
Meditation,3bg5ic,zenmonkey87,2,Sun Jun 28 23:11:02 2015 UTC,"Lying down will probably make you sleepy and it make it very hard for you to concentrate. An experienced meditator can meditate lying down if he is not sleepy, but it is not recommended for a beginner.   I meditate sitting in a chair using the back rest. I know of too many cases where someone injured their spine or knee trying to sit on the floor."
Meditation,3bg5ic,ringer54673,2,Mon Jun 29 01:46:21 2015 UTC,"Lying down is for sleeping and sitting up is for meditating.   The mind/body has had years of training learning that when we lie down and close our eyes, the intent is to sleep.   So it's best to meditate sitting. Over time, as we practice, the mind/body learns that when we sit down and close our eyes, the intent is to meditate so we automatically slip into meditation mode.  It's possible to mediate lying down but we are sending a confused message to our system if we do. So it's simpler to follow the above rule."
Meditation,3bg5ic,dmco,2,Mon Jun 29 08:03:34 2015 UTC,"Whichever you prefer. You can sit, lie down, or stand in a fire. As long as you can meditate COMFORTABLY you'll be fine. Most people will claim that you NEED to sit in full Lotus position and be a rock that's completely devoid of any human emotions, but that's bullcrap. Just do whatever makes you comfortable. You should start exercising and stretching regularly though, it'll improve your posture and relieve that back pain."
Meditation,3bg5ic,DO-The-Gaming-Guy,3,Mon Jun 29 07:19:48 2015 UTC,CAUTION: Only EXPERIENCED meditators are able to meditate while standing in a fire. NOT recommended for beginners!
Meditation,3bg5ic,drowzram,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:41:19 2015 UTC,An improper sitting up position can easily cause back pain to even experienced people. This is one reason why proper posture is considered important.
