The Saudis preach racist anti-Shia rhetoric but the Iranian government and people's problem with Saudi Arabia is political, not racial or sectarian.  Saudis fund Daesh and other global jihadi terrorist groups, allow US bases in the Middle East and make racist remarks at Shias and Iranians on a daily basis. The ideology of Taliban, Al Qaeda, Daesh, and all similar groups originates from Wahhabi Takfiri Saudi Arabia."

iran,3e4et2,fedora_gentlesir,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:35:40 2015 UTC,Perhaps. I say the saudis are tools because they are promoting sectarianism due their rivalry with Iran. They act irresponsibly supporting groups that are uncontrollable. They actively strengthen western nations at the expense of their neighbors and have named an entire country after themselves. For all their faults and rivalries the leadership of none of the middle eastern countries come close to the destructiveness of the saudis. The Iranian regime reacts while the saudi regime initiates destruction

Or are you saying it's just a symbolic explanation for the practical aid of crutch? If that's the case why not bring a staff to lean on? Or even a ceremonial sword?

I will find the video for you.  In fact, the whole Islam imposed on us was really emphasized and propagated by the former Shah, who sought to gain influence and westernize his nation by creating a separate and distinct nationalist identity that was inherently anti-Islam and pro-West (the whole Iranians are white thing, the Shah attempting to change the Persian alphabet to latinized symbols as Ataturk did).

The overwhelming majority of Iranians welcome these sanctions as relief from the war waged on the Iranian civilian population by arrogant foreign powers.  Every government wants to maintain power and advance their interests.

There is disagreements within the government on how to achieve this goal.  The other goal is to protect and impose Khamemei's personal opinion of what Islam is on the citizens. Rouhani has signaled that he does not approve but he is being shut out by Khamenei and doesn't have the power to make a permanent change.

No one wants Saudi Arabia to have nuclear weapons, and there are numerous treaties present in international law to ensure that they do not gain them.  You aptly noted that Saudi Arabia was built through foreign investment hands earlier. Now what would the affect be if all those hands were pulled out, simultaneously?  Let's not even discuss the security capabilities, the operational capabilities that Saudi would be required to have (that it would be unable to have) to maintain nuclear weapons. There is no need to.  No one should give any credit at all to this laughable grandstanding by Saudi Arabia that they will build a nuclear weapon. This will only further damage the nuclear deal, by aiding the false narrative of an arms deal, which simply will not take place. Any instance of Saudi claims for nuclear weapons should be met by one thing - derision - instantly and strongly."

If they don't pass a bill blocking it in 60 days or less it goes into effect automatically and if they do pass it it'll be vetoed immediately without the possibility of being overturned.    Either way, basically everyone wins.

He's a very smart man and knows the Iranian government is a rational actor and won't build nukes because it will no longer be in their benefit. The sanctions put chains on Iran and now the chains have been broken off. He knows that with this deal, over the next 15 years Iran will able to purchase modern military equipment and they'll have hundreds of billions injected into their economy and military. It will stabilize the Iranian government and he will never get his best case scenario of a revolution in Iran. Instead, the opposite is far more likely to happen where in the long term Iran will continue to increase their sphere of influence in the Middle East.  He knows that in the long term it'll mean that Israel might not be able to get their way all the time and it's far more likely Israel will have to concede to a two state solution with the Palestinians. I'm not saying there is risk of Iran-Israel war if they don't concede, because there isn't. There's too much to risk for both sides. With the chains off, Iran can grow and consequently their regional and international influence will too. And they can use that to bring the international community together on how Israel has been stealing land and stalling and arguably even sabotaging a two state solution.   Bibi failed to do what he wanted because he's like Ahmedinejad and has no idea how to deal with the international community. He really fucked up with Obama. I assume he had some plans on how it was going to pan out but it didn't happen and it seems to have backfired.  Edit: just to clarify he is in fact a very smart man. Here is him interviewed at 29 years old, confident and eloquent. Two years before this he graduated the top of his class at MIT. Israel was lucky to have someone like him so dedicated to their country, but he was the wrong PM to counter Rouhani and his backers."

He's a devoted nationalist with a twisted world view. It seems like the whole Israel thinks they are the only democracy in the Middle-East and in a brink of destruction so they must only pursue their own gain to SURVIVE! It's a delusional and distorted view, and only seems to get worse. As a Finnish nationalist, I'm not against nationalism, but when it reaches the point where it severely hurts the other people, it goes too far.   In 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, Israel called an airstrike to a very well designated UN observation post, killing four UN observers, including one Finnish observer whom my father knew. Before the airstrike, the area was shelled by IDF artillery for 6 hours, and the IDF liaison officer was contacted ten times to end the shelling and each time the officer promised to stop the bombardment. There is no question that it wouldn't have been an intentional attack. They just didn't like UN to observe their actions. When it happens just once, it can be pretty much passed with ""it was an accident, we're deeply sorry""-excuse."

It was definitely newsworthy, and they did have a leader (sort of), but like you said, the organization wasn't there. I don't think Iranians are actually ready for another revolution.   Months later, the Arabs had their ""spring"" and showed us how it's done...even with all their mistakes nowadays.   Showed us how to do what? Are you talking about Syria, Egypt, Bahrain, Kuwait, or perhaps Yemen? Yeah mean, that worked so well for them. Which country actually had a revolution? It was like Tunisia or somewhere nobody cares about. Their revolution probably didn't even work out great either.   With this deal, I'm still neutral about it. Sanctions hurt the regime, it hurt the people, no doubt. What can be done now that the sanctions will be lifted?   With sanctions lifted, Iranian people are no longer going to feel that their lives are being ruined by hostile foreign powers putting Iran under siege. They are going to have their hopes raised a lot for a new potential increase in their quality of life. (This hope is very dangerous, especially for the regime.) So the result is that now the Islamic Republic is under more pressure than ever to improve peoples' lives if it can. If the public ends up disappointed, it will increasingly single out the government as the sole thing holding them back, for better or worse.  Anyway, cheer up. Iran is going to be alright."

If you used pomegranate juice instead of molasses, you'd be adding quite a bit more fluid than it needs (as the juice is so much less concentrated than molasses) and thus ruin the end consistency."

iran,3dvpqf,uncannylizard,9,Sun Jul 19 22:44:02 2015 UTC,"Germany: Economic ties with Iran depend on improving relations with Israel  German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel urged Iran at the start of a three-day visit to improve its relationship with Israel if it wanted to establish closer economic ties with Germany and other western powers.  Gabriel, who is also economy minister, is the first senior figure from a large western government to visit Iran since it struck a landmark agreement with world powers on its nuclear program last week.  The deal was reached despite strong opposition from Israel, with which Germany has cultivated a close relationship since the end of World War Two, when the Nazis killed six million Jews.  That puts Germany in a delicate position as it seeks to win new business in Iran after a 12-year standoff over Iran's nuclear program during which sanctions sharply reduced trade and investment.  Conscious of that diplomatic difficulty, Gabriel kicked off his trip with a plea for Iran to improve relations with arch-enemy Israel and said Germany would like to act as a mediator.  ""You can't have a good economic relationship with Germany in the long-term if we don't discuss such issues too and try to move them along,"" Gabriel told a gathering of German and Iranian business people in Tehran.  ""Questioning this state's (Israel's) right to existence is something that we Germans cannot accept,"" he said, adding that now Berlin and Tehran can re-establish closer ties it was necessary to talk about human rights.  Gabriel, who will hold talks with Iranian President Hassan Rohani and several ministers, said he wanted to talk to human rights representatives in a country that the United Nations says is guilty of human rights violations against women, religious minorities, journalists and activists.  A strong signal  By travelling to Tehran with a delegation of industry group representatives and company officials, Gabriel sends a strong signal that Germany wants to quickly rebuild economic and political ties with Iran after a 12-year standoff over Tehran's nuclear program.   Under an agreement struck on Tuesday, sanctions imposed by the United States, European Union and United Nations will be lifted in exchange for Iran agreeing long-term curbs on a nuclear program that the West thought was intended to make a nuclear bomb. Tehran has always denied seeking nuclear arms.   ""The agreement reached between the E3+3 and Iran in Vienna has laid the foundations for a normalization of economic relations with Iran,"" Gabriel said before setting off. E3+3 refers to the group of countries that negotiated with Iran.   ""The precondition for this is that the steps foreseen in the agreement are now implemented,"" said Gabriel, who is also Germany's vice chancellor.   Germany's DIHK chambers of trade and commerce has forecast that German exports could double to about 5 billion euros within just two years and companies like Volkswagen and Siemens as well as thousands of smaller family-owned firms are eager to take back their dominant role in shipments to Iran.   Iranian exiles' criticism   Gabriel told German newspaper Bild he would use the trip to suggest that Germany could be a mediator between Iran and its arch-enemy Israel and said he would insist that the Iranian government recognize Israel's right to exist.   ""And really stable, good relationships with Germany will only be able to develop if this is accepted in Iranian politics. I will keep making that clear during my trip to Iran,"" Gabriel said in comments due to be published on Monday.   He said while the nuclear deal was a first step towards normalizing relations with Iran, further steps needed to follow in terms of Iran's role in conflicts in the region and especially its relationship with Israel.   ""Germany can and wants to offer itself as a mediator for this,"" he was quoted as saying in an advance extract of the interview.  However, the visit was received with criticism from members in Berlin's large Iranian exile community. Fariborz Jabbari, the uncle of a young Iranian woman who was executed for killing a former officer who allegedly attempted to rape her, said Gabriel was ""doing business with an inhumane regime.""  ""When he signs contracts, he should think about the people sitting in prisons, about the regime critics, the tortured, the condemned,"" he told Bild, AFP reported.  The head of the German chapter of Reporters without Borders urged Gabriel not to lose sight of human rights during his economic visit, and to call for the release of journalists jailed in Iranian prisons.  It would be ""disastrous"" if Gabriel put economic interests ahead of human rights and press freedom during his visit, Christian Mihr told Bild, AFP reported."

This is a weird generation divide I see ... older people from Iran (from the educated class - scientists, programmers, lawyers, doctors, etc) that I meet from my years of traveling to conferences around the world never have one time said to me a nasty word for Israel.  Cyrus the fucking Great supported Jews and the right for them to live in their native land. He financed Jews to return to their conquered capital, Jerusalem, and build the temple. Zionism is the movement for Jews to have self-determination in their historical and cultural homeland - SO THEREFORE CYRUS THE GREAT WAS ZIONIST.  It is weird to see this contrarian circle jerk against Israel from Iranians - the majority of history between Persian (and all Iranian peoples) with Jews is positive. For all the 1900s there were Zionist associations in Iran, including before 1948 (I have uncle that left Iran for Jerusalem in the 1920s) . Maybe I am talking with a small selection bias of Iranians in my professional life (educated and living in Western countries), but in my normal experience I never see such ignorance and disrespect to Israel."

Or Hamas would somehow become less hostile if the blockade persists indefinitely?  About the Iranian position, my thoughts are that the current stance is useful for geopolitical reasons and Hezbollah's strength is a good deterrent from Israeli military action against both Iran and Lebanon. When Israel does make peace with Palestine with the approval of the Palestinians there is no doubt Iran will recognize Israel."
iran,3dvpqf,MJive,2,Mon Jul 20 21:57:19 2015 UTC,"Why do you disagree with the removal of the Gaza blockade? For how many more generations should Gazan Palestinians suffer?   its not about Gazans, its about Hamas, which is an entity which is outwardly and aggressively hostile towards Israel. No country would allow another country to freely attack it. Hamas either needs to be wiped out, needs to submit to the authority of the PA, or it needs to change its policy towards Israel. Until then it cant be given resources that it can use to attack Israel.   That being said, I believe that if Israel were to agree to a two state solution with the PA then Hamas would shrivel and collapse, because much of its energy comes from the belief amongst Palestinians that the Abbas led PA is impotent. Therefore I do blame Israel and Hamas for the situation in Gaza. They are both to blame. hamas should change its policy. israel should sign a two state solution with the PA. They should both be doing these things, neither can use the other as an excuse.    Do you honestly believe the Palestinian Authority which Hamas is a part of would agree to any peace without the removal of the blockade? Or Hamas would somehow become less hostile if the blockade persists indefinitely?   Hamas is not part of the PA. They were expelled from the PA after their illegal formation of private militias and their illegal seizure of Gaza. There was a reconciliation deal last year, but it was never implemented because Hamas refused to honor any of its agreements (such as handing over control of Gaza to the PA security forces), and now the deal has officially collapsed and Hamas is totally separate from the PA.   I believe that Hamas would weaken if Israel agreed to a two state solution and peace deal between in and the PA. The people would see that there is a real alternative and Hamas would lose support. It would eventually be pressured to submit to the PA or it would be overthrown.    About the Iranian position, my thoughts are that the current stance is useful for geopolitical reasons and Hezbollah's strength is a good deterrent from Israeli military action against both Iran and Lebanon. When Israel does make peace with Palestine with the approval of the Palestinians there is no doubt Iran will recognize Israel.   I agree that this is the reason why Iran has taken this position, but I also believe that Iran has better opportunities now other than relying on fringe extremist groups. It should pressure their proxies to change their stances. There is no reason why a group like Hezbollah needs to oppose a two state solution. They can still fight the occupation while agreeing that ultimately there should be a two state solution, simply because there is no other option that can improve the Palestinian condition. Iranian allies like Syria and Iraq have basically already agreed to the arab peace initiative proposals so they are already on board. the rewards of such a shift in policy towards israel would be great as Iran would have less of a problem with America staunchly backing Iran's enemies.

Once this is understood they can come to the realization that Iranians' opposition is of a political nature and is not based on religion or race.  Cyrus the Great's freeing of the Jews under Babylonian captivity and the rebuilding of the temple was 2500 years ago. The Jews that have immigrated to the middle east are not native to the land and they are building illegal settlements on illegally occupied land, where Palestinians were illegally displaced and their homes were bulldozed to make way. That is the reason why Israel will not be recognized in its current form.  It is exactly like when Iran stood up against Apartheid South Africa after the revolution until Mandela rose to power with the support of the masses and thanked Iran personally for the continued support.  At that time it was USA and Israel defending the Apartheid state in the United Nations, with USA vetoing United Nations resolutions against the Apartheid regime the same way it does for Israel today."

The 81-year-old South African leader called Mr. Barak ''a man of vision'' for his pursuit of a settlement with Syria.

Perhaps the subsidies come with conditions about exports. That's just me speculating.   I did notice a 20% increase in peanut butter prices over the past few months.

iran,3dv0e9,fuckitallogy,4,Sun Jul 19 23:03:28 2015 UTC,the idea of McDonald's in Iran just does not work. organic food is accessible to every one so fast foods must have a really high quality to sell Iran's market. the funny stands or shops that use the logo from KFC or McDonald's  usually are there because most people associate them to fast food.

iran,3dv0e9,marmulak,2,Mon Jul 20 09:01:22 2015 UTC,"Well, partly joking, but as a serious analysis of American culture there is something to be said about the role fast food plays in it. Like many Americans, McDonald's is something I grew up with. It occupies a traditional part of our cultural sphere, but at the same time, just as fast food is very American, so is hating fast food a big part of American culture. It's interesting how at the same time McDonald's is one of the oldest and most beloved fast food chains (I can certainly say that it was part of my childhood) as well as one of the most hated.  Of course, I don't think McDonald's is evil. All they do is sell cheap food that's full of fat, salt, and sugar. Basically what all restaurants everywhere do. Americans have little respect for their culture, though. You could go to a Pakistani restaurant and have the same unhealthy crap--everything fried in a bucket of oil, diabetes-inducing desserts. And yet because it's their ""culture"" it's considered special and good.  Americans don't want to think of Coca Cola as being a traditional American drink. They spend too much time talking about how unhealthy it is and making hyperbolic claims like it being poisonous and deadly. These sentiments, while held by many Americans, also get easily picked up in anti-American circles. Iranians who hate America may gleefully share posts on Facebook calling Coca Cola a health hazard and a plague, meanwhile downing liters of chai nabaat every day, which has almost the exact same effect on your health (same amount of caffeine, sugar, and acidity). Russians are proud of drinking kvas, a sugar-loaded bubbly soft drink that monks prepared in monasteries, yet Americans can't be proud of their own bubbly sugary drinks. Please."

There is also a lot of new construction going on, previously one of the tallest buildings in Mashhad used to be that Red Crescent building but contractors are taking up new projects.   oh yeah, one of the biggest projects though I think is the new padideh district, look it up. The hotel is fucking massive. They redid the Imam Reza Stadium, and they're building a mega mall next to it too. There is also another mall being built I think it goes by the name OXIN. Also the ridiculous amount of hotels being built next to the Imam Reza shrine as well.   Its hard for someone who lives here to register everything new that has happened in 15 years because for me change is gradual.

iran,3dwn46,Assyre,6,Mon Jul 20 03:42:37 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I want to know why Iran won't decide to change there name back to Persia?   You know, this was hotly debated by Iranian scholars at the time. The question was not about what the country's name actually was (it was always ""Iran"" to Iranians), but whether foreigners should continue calling it ""Persia"" in their own language. Basically ""Persia"" was a name referring to the whole country that was popularized in the West, and it stuck for so long that basically every English speaker knows what ""Persia"" is and you find that name being referenced continuously for literally ages. The Shah had asked the international community to refer to Iran by its actual name rather than the popular ""Persia"", which caused some objection since the name ""Persia"" was so well established. The fear was that Iran would lose its brand recognition.  Personally I prefer Iran because I speak Persian, but it's not that sensitive of a subject for me. I noticed Americans (especially older Americans) care more about the fact that the name was changed. Calling Iran ""Persia"" is like how in English we say ""Germany"", but in German they say ""Deutschland"".  However, it's not just a matter of translation. Strictly speaking, ""Persia"" and ""Iran"" mean two different things. ""Persia"" comes from ""Pars"" (now known as ""Fars""), which is where the Persians come from. Persians established a very famous empire in ancient times, and they basically conquered Iran and were such a huge power and influence in the Iranian world that being Persian (or Persianized) and being Iranian practically became synonymous. However, to put in the most simple terms, ""Iran"" is the name of a country, and ""Fars"" is a region in Iran whose ethnicity and specifically language dominate Iran. So their language is ""Persian"", which they call ""Farsi"", and it can be said that Persian and Farsi are the same word but in two different languages.   the huge tolerance levels in Persia which made them so powerful   Iranians today tend to super exaggerate the modern concept of ""human rights"" and cultural tolerance in ancient Iran. You sort of have to watch out for this, but that being said it is true that for an ancient civilization the Iranians were one of the more tolerant ones. They were not unique in this behavior, though. When Iranians conquered a land, they allowed the leaders there to pledge allegiance to the Iranian emperor, and the empire would extract taxes, but otherwise wouldn't interfere too much in the country's internal politics or culture (including religion). Other empires did this too, and the Hittites were not just tolerant of other religions, but even institutionalized the religions of the people they conquered, to the point where the Hittite kingdom officially recognized hundreds of local deities. Even the ancient Persians did some of this, as the Cyrus Cylinder indicates that Cyrus wanted Mesopotamians to think that he worshiped their god in order to legitimize his rule.  Westerners are always impressed by Cyrus because the Jews wrote good things about him. He probably deserved the praise.  As for tolerating those who ""look"" different, the Persian empire ruled over an area where people were basically Caucasian. If modern Persian culture is any indication of their traditional culture, they're actually rather racist towards black Africans and also a little bit toward East Asians. That's not unusual, though.   Do people in Persia regret revolting against there King and replacing it with the muslim man?   Well the funny thing about that was that the king was himself a Muslim man, as were all Iranian kings for the past fourteen hundred years. The 1979 revolution was an unusual moment in Iranian history, and it's not as radical as some people may think. Iran already had a history of democratic movement, as the Islamic Republic of Iran is, at its core, a constitutional democracy, albeit a theocratic, revolutionary one with rather limited democracy.  I don't think Iranians regretted ending monarchy per se. They had wanted that for a very long time, and they would have done so sooner had countries like the US not forced monarchy back onto Iranians in order to get what it wanted. The whole ""death to America"" thing has more to do with the fact that America ruined democracy in Iran rather than anything to do with religion.  But of course some people regret the revolution. For most people it's too late to think about ""what if"" and to go back to what they had before. The only direction is forward, which is to continue some elements of the current government, with more emphasis on democracy.   Why wont there be a revolution? I mean, look at my country, The French revolution was the bloodiest but it was done(though as a royalist I am upset because i believe one person shouldn't affect an entire institution.... adopting a Consitutional Monarchy is good as well you know?) but why wont Persia just decide to revolt?   It's basically too late for that. They technically already did revolt, and the current government is what they got out of it. To some extent Iranians got what they wanted, especially a big increase in national independence. They are tired of the theocratic elements, but at the same time still want their country to be self-governed and free of foreign influence, as it is now.   Theres a lot of beauty and history in the Persian name... so why keep Iran?   Definitely this matters to English speakers. Probably native speakers especially, but it doesn't really matter to people living in Iran.   Is it true Persia is sponsoring Terrorism? i know this is a strange question but the things i read and see on tv, id like to know.   The straight answer is yes, but it's important to understand that Iran is not especially involved in terrorism. Iran basically plays the same game that the US and other countries do, which is that they make political maneuvers in the region and try to back groups that support their own interests. For example, during the war in Iraq, Iran backed up factions that were sympathetic to Iran, while the US backed factions that did what the US wanted. The support that these countries give to their ""friends"" comes in many ways, such as money, equipment, training, etc. Some groups that Iran supported have engaged in acts that may be considered terrorism. However, Iran's goal is not to intentionally cause harm to innocent people, but it's messy and it happens I'm sure. Same with the US. The US also covertly backs terror when it's convenient, so we can't say that Iran is especially strange or evil of a country.   Why wont Persia decide to just sent troops? like im not talking small scale but large scale and just remove isis once and for all?   They are working on it. Whey the don't fully engage ISIS probably has to do with their analysis of the costs and gains. All-out war would be risky and costly, but they are working on taking ISIS down none the less.   Do you truly believe having a nuclear capabilities is a wise decision with the current situation happening in Persia?   Yes, Iran is a modern, developed country. If they didn't have ""nuclear capabilities"" that would just be silly.   Someone sid what if they decided to drop a bomb into Israel?   People have been following this issue closely for literally decades. All the research that's gone into it shows that Iran doesn't have a bomb, isn't even trying to build one, and almost certainly would not attack Israel even if it had nuclear weapons. The rest is just Israeli propaganda because Israel wants to feed excuses to the US and Europe as a pretext for war in Iran. Israel wants Iran to get hit because Israel and Iran compete in the region for resources. Iran was basically the main thing that stood in the way of Israel from invading and conquering more territory than it did.   Do you guys believe you can be trusted with things that can wipe a whole civilization?   Nobody can be trusted with it, which is why the US is potentially the most dangerous country in the world with its nuclear arsenal. It is also the least trustworthy nation because it's actually used nuclear weapons, and also America has this weird delusional culture that it's the most important country in the history of mankind. They think that America is God's chosen country and think it's fair to destroy the whole world as long as they stay on top.  Anyway, thanks for the questions. It always makes us happy when people want to get to know more about Iran.  Edit: Thanks for the gold, amazing person. I also wanted to add another point about the difference between ""Iran"" and ""Persia"". You can think about it like Britain, where ""English"" is a language and people from ""England"", and England is part of a bigger country called the United Kingdom of Something or Another, which is basically Great Britain. So Persian language is from Persia, like English language is from England, and both lands are part of one bigger country."

iran,3dwn46,fuckitallogy,4,Tue Jul 21 11:56:28 2015 UTC,"hello and welcome to /r/iran :)    I want to know why Iran won't decide to change there name back to Persia?   Persia as a name represents Persians who are a large ethnicity in our country but Iran represents all of the few dozen ethnicitys in the country. for example in united states you got of Irish or French or African or Scandinavian heritage but they live in a country called United States. the translation for the name Iran is ""the land of honorable People"". it would not be respectful to chose the name of one group of the people where you got dozens of honorable and well respected groups living for a long time in your national borders.    Persia changed its name to Iran because of Germany yes?    no. the king who changed the name of the country actually was supported by the British and united states and he and his son had really close relations with both countries.    The immortals?   have you played assassins creed? the Idea of hashashin soldiers also comes from Iran.   who today can say that they like Israel?   no one really wants to know the Iranian stance on Israel. everything that you know about Iran-Israeli conflict is a lie. ask me why.    Do people in Persia regret revolting against there King and replacing it with the Muslim man?   some do. remember the occupy wall street movement in united states ? imagine if that ended up toppling the united states federal and state governments and all the ""1%"" ran away from the country. that's what happened 35 years ago in Iran.  it was not as much about the religious man in charge but the Idea of the way that the meaning of the word ""life""  has changed in our perspectives and what is the price we are paying for a ""better life"".    Why wont there be a revolution?    why would be ? isn't the era of revolutions over? more than a revolution we need to have national discussions or topics we have differences on.    Is it true Persia is sponsoring Terrorism?    the united states government supplies weapons to Saudi Arabia and Israel. Saudi Arabia kills Yemeni children and has been attacking on Hothi minority in Yemen for years. Israel has been doing the same and using the sympathy that gained from the death of innocent Jewish people in Holocaust to hide its war crimes. ask me how.   don't trust the media.    Why wont Persia decide to just sent troops? like im not talking small scale but large scale and just remove isis once and for all?    ISIS is Saudi Intelligence trying to occupy Iraq. Iran does not want Iraq and we know that if anyone can pay the price for removing ISIS its the people of Iraq. if we send troops there there gonna be an ISIS 10 years or 20 years from now. if the Iraqi and Syrian people destroy ISIS it will not be emerging again and there wouldn't be any sympathy for them from no one.    Do you truly believe having a nuclear capabilities is a wise decision with the current situation happening in Persia?    we never wanted the bomb. we don't need it. there are no evidence of Iran trying to make the bomb. however cheap electricity makes the price of producing anything lower which is good for the economy.    Do you guys believe you can be trusted with things that can wipe a whole civilization?   no one should be trusted with those. unfortunately the world is full of them."
iran,3dwn46,Lucifer_L,2,Tue Jul 21 06:54:53 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for your kindness and answering my questions friend.  Edit:    Persia as a name represents Persians who are a large ethnicity in our country but Iran represents all of the few dozen ethnicitys in the country. for example in united states you got of Irish or French or African or Scandinavian heritage but they live in a country called United States.   I never thought of it that way.

iran,3dwn46,Host13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:16:13 2015 UTC,"In world war 2. Persia changed its name to Iran because of Germany yes?. (Aryan race).   Lol, what??  I think you're naive at best if you actually believe that Christians and Israelis are not militant, as though there is a God up there somewhere who's actually working to magically bless either Christians or Israelis and ""rightfully"" place them as hegemons (de-facto or otherwise) of the globe. These things are won through warfare, and if you had any idea the scale of innocent people who are trampled between the tank tracks and who get crushed into a bloody pulp through your precious religious ideology and you had an ounce of a conscience within you, you would immediately repudiate and disavow any allegiance to those concepts nor would you ever behold them as legitimate spiritual practices.  I take your sort of Christianity as seriously as I take that of a Spanish inquisitor: it's nonsense. I have met people who I could call bona-fide Christians, and what they represent is completely unlike what passes for Christianity today in the popular consciousness.   And I truly like that. And it truly upsets me to see Persia the way it is. Persia has always been a world leader in the middle east since history can prove it.   This world isn't made for your pleasure and how you believe it works has absolutely no bearing on historical facts and events that other people have experienced for themselves, your opinion and your outlook (which are themselves byproducts of your upbringing) are irrelevant no matter how sincerely you believe that you are just trying to do the right thing and express what is best for everyone's interests.  TL;DR: nobody cares what you like.   Why wont there be a revolution? I mean, look at my country, The French revolution was the bloodiest but it was done(though as a royalist I am upset because i believe one person shouldn't affect an entire institution.... adopting a Consitutional Monarchy is good as well you know?) but why wont Persia just decide to revolt?   No offense, but who do you think you are?   Is it true Persia is sponsoring Terrorism? i know this is a strange question but the things i read and see on tv, id like to know.   The only thing that is true is that, honestly, sincerely, you live inside of a bubble and you have absolutely no idea how the world works. You are literally breeding stock for waging war. Go have your civilian friends and family killed in war in your homeland and watch every glimmer of hope you had in the politicians who promised to end it all get smashed to pieces and then come back and talk your shit.  If I had any advice to give you it would be to stop consuming HFCS-laden soft drinks and read history books and news archives of events in the past 50 years and then come back and tell us it's as black and white as you see it now, and that changing the name of a country and putting a smile on our faces for a bunch of belligerent liars is going to make it rain lollipops and cupcakes."

iran,3dt6mi,Lucifer_L,4,Sun Jul 19 23:41:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think the people that are saying Zarif are very familiar with the way the majority of people actually living in Iran think. Zarif's entire appeal is to Westerners, which made him very good for his job to finish the nuclear file, but does not really fit the role of the president of Iran. He is too Americanized for such a position. He is not populist at all, unlike Rouhani. Just because he works very well in one position does not mean he is a good candidate for other positions.  Another Ahmadinejad is not going to come into power. I also do not think a reformist will, though that would be idea. The biggest group that will gain right now are the moderate conservatives like Larijani and Nategh Noori.   If we want to look at people associated with the nuclear file, Abbas Araghchi would have a better chance than Zarif. Even more than either of them would be Salehi, who was a key factor in the negotiations, but is very close to the Supreme Leader and also served in Ahmadinejad's government. He is probably someone acceptable for most 'jenahs'. Someone else similar to all these people is Ghalibaf, who was doing very well in polls until the last week before last elections. He might have best chance at this point.  In the end, you cannot really predict Iranian politics because it is so volatile. Everyone moves around, and the different camps are very fluid. Not to mention, you talk about 'progress' right now, but Rouhani hasn't really done much yet, and the real question is now that the whole nuclear stuff is finishing, what will he do now? Will the economy really get better? Will he be able to bring inflation in single digits? Reduce unemployment? Reduce rampant corruption? If people don't notice a difference in economy in one or two years they won't see him as a hero any longer."

He didn't work diplomatic magic like Rouhani did, either. However, Iran could see some success in electing a ""flexible"" or at least more intelligent conservative figure.  Not that I'm against liberals, but if Iran gets too much liberalism too fast it will cause a knee-jerk reaction by the establishment and undo slow gains. Iran needs very shrewd presidents, and Rouhani is shrewd but still comes off as overly liberal."

iran,3dqiam,rezsahin,18,Sat Jul 18 13:51:35 2015 UTC,"This would be an economic and perspective dream. Though if not handled correctly, our tourist sights may deteriorate and our welcoming attitudes may be tested too much."
iran,3dqiam,TILopisafag,17,Sat Jul 18 16:48:07 2015 UTC,"I agree, that would be a shame.  One of the things I appreciated on my visit was that the hallmarks of mass tourism weren't evident. I enjoyed visiting the country without being targeted as a walking wallet.  People displayed sincere interest and that is an uncommon experience in this day and age."
iran,3dqiam,ThisWasMySistersIdea,7,Sat Jul 18 17:17:32 2015 UTC,"I was really hoping for that exact experience, so it would be disappointing if everything became commercial and tourist-trappy."
iran,3dqiam,Vaginuh,4,Sat Jul 18 21:00:59 2015 UTC,They might have to start implementing quotas such as 'this many tourists for at this time of the season or something.
iran,3dqiam,derintellectual,7,Sat Jul 18 19:43:35 2015 UTC,That might not be a terrible idea...I wonder how many foreign tourists Iran can accommodate easily.
iran,3dqiam,ThisWasMySistersIdea,7,Sat Jul 18 20:28:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think they have the infrastructure to cope with so many tourists, and many rely on the couch surfing. In a sense, I've said it from the beginning, Iran opening up its mass tourist industry will really mess up the authenticity of the country."
iran,3dqiam,derintellectual,8,Sat Jul 18 21:33:08 2015 UTC,"I truly hope that doesn't happen.  The world is losing it's authentic places.  They are being replaced with plastic, fake environments designed only to make as much money as possible for wealthy investors.  Neither the ordinary person living there or tourist benefits from that kind of tourist industry."
iran,3dqiam,ThisWasMySistersIdea,3,Sat Jul 18 21:55:05 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Iran should be really really careful how it handles this. If it wants economic prosperity, then it must say goodbye to the nostalgia and history that is attached to its sights and what a shame that would be if it happens."
iran,3dqiam,derintellectual,3,Sat Jul 18 21:59:32 2015 UTC,I would like to think that the Iran could learn lessons from some other places which have embraced mass tourism and have ruined cities chasing the almighty dollar or euro or....  Maybe delayed tourism to Iran is good as it will give people a chance to think about this issue thoughtfully.  I am sad when I see what has happened in places like Istanbul where the government has bulldozed neighborhoods to make shopping malls and other things the people who live there do not want. All to satisfy tourist demand.
iran,3dqiam,ThisWasMySistersIdea,2,Sat Jul 18 22:09:11 2015 UTC,Yep. Although the attitudes of many Iranians is that they are just interested in seeing so many foreigners and they may not be able to fully comprehend the negative side effects of mass tourism. I'm interested to hear what avenue Iranians would express their view concerning mass tourism.
iran,3dqiam,derintellectual,2,Sat Jul 18 22:17:06 2015 UTC,"I understand the point you are making.  By people I meant officials in charge of tourism.  Most of the time ordinary citizens don't get a chance to voice their opinion until it is too late.  At least that is the way it is here.  And yet, who could blame ordinary citizens from wanting to benefit from the increased income mass tourism would bring."
iran,3dqiam,ThisWasMySistersIdea,2,Sat Jul 18 22:39:33 2015 UTC,"If you want to see the future of Iranian hospitality in tourist cities, go to Nagsh-e Jahan Square in Esfahan. It's probably the only place in Iran where the concentration of foreign tourists is high enough that fooling them has become a culture. That culture will start spreading to other well-visited places. However Iran has enough hidden gems that the authentic travel experience will not disappear, but tourists will have to venture outside of Esfahan, Shiraz, Yazd and the other tourist cities."
iran,3dqiam,Schwarzwald_Creme,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:51:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, yeah..."
iran,3dqiam,Ahmad_Zadan,9,Sat Jul 18 20:21:04 2015 UTC,"I'm torn on this issue. If Iran allows mass tourism I just feel like the authentic feeling of being in iran is gone, I don't know if that makes sense."
iran,3dqiam,Jose-armendariz,6,Sat Jul 18 23:36:58 2015 UTC,"Good. Let them see the hidden gem. Hope Iran can get some historic buildings renovated, and stops demolishing valuable buildings to build ugly new structures."
iran,3dqiam,IR-TR,4,Sat Jul 18 22:58:09 2015 UTC,"and stops demolishing valuable buildings to build ugly new structures.    Err, that is exactly what happens when money is an incentive."
iran,3dqiam,derintellectual,3,Sun Jul 19 10:23:03 2015 UTC,"Uhm no? People visit Iran for it's history, not because it's some awesome party destination. So when you destroy the history, then WTF would any idiot want to do in Iran except business?  There is a difference between demolishing shoddy 1970s buildings and historical hundreds year old buildings with significant value."
iran,3dqiam,IR-TR,4,Sun Jul 19 10:54:02 2015 UTC,"Uhm no? People visit Iran for it's history, not because it's some awesome party destination. So when you destroy the history, then WTF would any idiot want to do in Iran except business?   Have you been to Istanbul? It has history, yet tourists are still after the party scene as well. North Tehran and Shiraz better get ready.   There is a difference between demolishing shoddy 1970s buildings and historical hundreds year old buildings with significant value.    The medium storey buildings you see in many major cities will be demolished in favour of soulless skyscrapers. It happens every time and Iran will be no exception unless its careful."
iran,3dqiam,derintellectual,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:25:44 2015 UTC,"Well, my mom's from Turkey and half my family lives there so jah:D But Istanbul's party scene is different. There actually is an overt party scene, so during daytime you see the sights, at night you party. Iran is different. It has many beautiful historical sights, which will be the first to attrack tourists. Later on perhaps they'll party too  (or now, underground).   If those medium story buildings are those boxy, boring, shoddy 70's 80's 90's buildings with no historical significance, I say demolish them. What pains me is old Iranian historical buildings being demolished for a quick buck. Those should be preserved and renovated."
iran,3dqiam,IR-TR,3,Sun Jul 19 12:43:54 2015 UTC,They have been saying this for years.  Isfahan only has 3 decent hotels and 2 of them belong to the Pahlavi era.  There are some nice small boutique hotels but too small to accommodate a large number of tourists.  I remember once Sepahan FC was hosting an Asian game and at the same time Isfahan was the host of the non aligned countries meeting.  There wasn't enough hotel rooms available.  The team (I think it was Al Hilal) had to stay at an inferior hotel and they even complained to FIFA.
iran,3dqiam,Sepahani,2,Sat Jul 18 23:56:16 2015 UTC,Of course Al Hilal would complain to FIFA...
iran,3dqiam,BardiaSaeedi,0,Sun Jul 19 07:36:09 2015 UTC,If you have any hotel recommendations for Isfahan I would love to have them for an upcoming trip.

iran,3dqiam,ThisWasMySistersIdea,2,Sun Jul 19 13:13:11 2015 UTC,"Same here, I just stayed there one night as my dad paid for it, I couldn't afford it on my own. Anyhow, I think it's definitely a place I will revisit if I go to isfahan again. Btw, have you looked into couch surfing? I don't know your background, but as you know Iranians are super hospitable, plus you'll get to know a completely different Iran too."
iran,3dqiam,Kashik,2,Sun Jul 19 13:45:02 2015 UTC,"As an American with only an American passport, I am restricted to guided tours and hotels unfortunately.  The guide from my trip last Spring did tell me I could stay at his parents house in Shiraz the next time I visited Iran and his Mom would teach me how to cook.  He knows the rules so I am not sure what kind of work around there is for that.  Or perhaps it was just a bit of taroof??"
iran,3dqiam,ThisWasMySistersIdea,2,Sun Jul 19 14:09:38 2015 UTC,"I understand. Hopefully, that will change now and you'll be able to travel freely.  Well, it could be a mix of both. I mean, most iranians are really nice indeed but also talk a lot of bullshit - I'd just ask him casually if you can still take him up on his offer."
iran,3dqiam,Kashik,2,Sun Jul 19 14:29:38 2015 UTC,"I plan to do that. I want those cooking lessons! Right now I have to make do with cookbooks.  There is no substitute for learning in the kitchen with an experienced cook though. I think my friend is serious.  He keeps telling me that his mother asks when her American daughter is coming to Iran to cook.  Besides, I will need a translator and someone needs to eat all of the food we cook up.  I can see who will be the beneficiary of my lessons!"
iran,3dqiam,ThisWasMySistersIdea,4,Sun Jul 19 15:28:57 2015 UTC,Iran doesn't have the infra structure to handle 20 million tourists a year. They can get there in 10-15 years but not immediately.

iran,3dqiam,KingJamesX,6,Sun Jul 19 03:14:40 2015 UTC,I would be one of them. Need to visit my mom's house in Tehran and Shiraz
iran,3dqiam,squarerootof-1,5,Sat Jul 18 19:44:41 2015 UTC,I'd be another. No family links in Iran but we have so much shared heritage which intrigues me. I was actually checking flight routes to Iran a few weeks ago when I was travelling and they were all awkward. Hopefully next year I can go straight from my location to Tehran to Islamabad on Iran Air.
iran,3dqiam,Mazdaian,2,Sun Jul 19 07:53:39 2015 UTC,There will definitely be more Zoroastrians visiting Iran after this
iran,3dqiam,marmulak,-1,Sun Jul 19 04:50:29 2015 UTC,How? Why? They've probably already been visiting since before the deal.
iran,3dqiam,Mazdaian,2,Sun Jul 19 13:17:20 2015 UTC,"It will be easier to travel from the West, I would think.  Why? Because Iran is the ancestral land of most Zoroastrians."

iran,3dqiam,Mazdaian,2,Sun Jul 19 16:09:15 2015 UTC,There are many in the West
iran,3dqiam,tehranigirl,2,Sun Jul 19 16:35:44 2015 UTC,I feel this figure is way too high. But yes tourism will be one of the major industries to grow. I just hope they keep a tab on so called multi national hotel groups who come and destroy heritage sites to build ugly looking structures.

iran,3dqiam,ThisWasMySistersIdea,2,Sat Jul 18 22:59:49 2015 UTC,I know I have felt that way in Istanbul.  The pressure to buy from shopkeepers and restaurants was really oppressive.  That is why I really enjoyed Iran. It was so different from that experience.

iran,3dqiam,ThisWasMySistersIdea,2,Sun Jul 19 07:56:19 2015 UTC,So even the barbers are into the game of harassing tourists!  I wouldn't let an angry barber near my head with a pair of scissors either.  You might end up looking like a human topiary!

After bringing the food, he rearranged the flags so the Iranian flag was no longer next to the British flag but next to the American flag.  He then told me that the Iranian flag and the American flag had to be next to each other because we were friends."

iran,3dr5s1,1337Bolshevik,2,Sun Jul 19 13:15:14 2015 UTC,"Even though it seems promising to hear, the article misses many important points. One, India has changed its policy in the last few years. Of late its acting like an outpost for the Americans. Just few years ago, they had voted against Iran in the UN even when countries with which Iran had no contacts had abstained. Plus India has been dithering on making oil payments as US was pressuring them and asking them not to buy Iranian oil. There was also talk of a pipeline from Iran to India. But the US govt pressurised India and they caved in.  Even the chabahar port has been mentioned numerous times in the last 10 years only for India to backtrack every time. In the present circumstances, Iran should be opening these projects to bidding and allow them after vetting their credentials. I don't think there's any need to give any one nation preferential treatment. Also, the present govt in India is a hindu nationalist one who consider Israel as their preferred ally. They want to form an India-Israel-US cooperation. Thus giving them preferential treatment could be a threat to Iran's security. Frankly, I feel China would be a better option. One they have been buying our oil for some time. Second, they dont care what the US says or thinks. No amount of US pressure works on them. India is still not big on the world stage. they weren't even part of the negotiations also. Plus tomorrow if the republicans come in power in US and try to scuttle the deal, having the chinese would help to veto any such move."

iran,3dqhvt,ShzMeteor,4,Sat Jul 18 15:02:29 2015 UTC,"This, I think a lot of people have gripes with the corrupt legal system.   On the topic of envionrmental problems I dont think will be that hard to get laws passed. Actually fixing the problem is going to be ridiculously difficult though, a lot of people lack the baisic savad to understand what this means to the country. Its actually really shocking about how uninformed people are about this topic. I heared the government was running some courses for farmers to not waste and use up as much water as they are, but I doubt that alone would be effective. I think the government needs to be more heavy handed on how its handling thins like the enviornment, I know its an unpopular opinion, but at this point given how badly the lakes and rivers are drying up, its time for serious action.   I'm confident he can fight two battles at once, more than that, its impossible.    •Social reforms desired by the minorities and people in general   this and the enviornmental crisis are likley higher on the list. The influence of the Pasdars isn't something thats affecting me on a daily baisis, and well to be fair neither is the censorship. But that is a more immediate concern of people rather than the influence of the Basij. That also might make him enemies which he doesn't want."
iran,3dqhvt,Nmathmaster123,2,Sat Jul 18 15:27:44 2015 UTC,"What's the current problems with the legal system? Do you think they'll follow any particular model that exists today?   On the topic of the water issues, Iran has dried up due to climate change in the region that has been on going over the last 2500 years. We know this because a lot of the stuff written by travelers with Alexander documented the rivers they traveled to get around Iran and Central Asia and they don't exist anymore. To fix Iran's environmental problems it will require a lot of big projects, which means big $$$$ investments"
iran,3dqhvt,Nmathmaster123,8,Sat Jul 18 15:44:53 2015 UTC,"The legal system is really fucking corrupt, thank god I've never had a serious case/run-in, but rich people get let off really easily, the way they process the people on deathrow is just compleatly disfunctional. Its also really hard to get anything moving through the courts. Sometimes it can take a year to just get a case started.   I think corruption in the legal system rather than the punishments/penalties are the bigger problems. Courts don't take female on male violence seriously at all, sometimes the judge just might throw out your case without fully compleating the case if he thinks the evidence is sufficient enough.   Also on climate change, it might have been going on since 2500 years ago, but people's stupididty today is just accelerating the problem. They will have to tear down a lot of the land, and the government will need to deal with farmers who are skirting regulations more seriously. People waste water washing their fucking driveways for gods sake. My asshat neighbor (he lives above me). Irania besavadan, take it from me. Despite all the government does to drill it through people's thick heads, nothing will happen until the Iranian people want it to happen. People don't wear their seatbelts, every time I mention it they just laugh at me, every time I tell my friend not to throw his garbage out of the window he just laughs at me. People will keep wasting water until they get smacked by a policeman or until there is no water left. . ."

They delivered everything as promised and were great at answering emails promptly.    FYI, payment for this trip was made once I was in Tehran. I know 2 other Americans who made trips to Iran and used Iran Travel Service and they were also happy with them.    It took 3 weeks to get the authorization numbers from the MFA in Iran.  Once the numbers are issued, it is pretty much a done deal to get the visa as long as you send off for it within the specified time frame.  I mailed my passport off to DC and it took 10 days total to have it returned to me from the time I mailed it.    My understanding is that your stamp from Israel would prevent a visa from being issued.  I think a new passport would be necessary to insure there are no problems getting the visa to Iran."

There is a reason that Zarif insisted that those sanctions be among the first to be lifted. I expect Iran will take full advantage.  However I will say that if Iran does shun American products and services, Obama and those who support him (there are many of us even if we are not always loud) will not feel betrayed. Obama believes that America's economic future lies in the Pacific Rim, which is why he has worked so hard to create the TPP, an economic zone that will encompass more than 40% of the world's GDP with its inaugural members alone (the EU captures only 21%).  Obama is always focused on the big picture. He did not strike this deal with Iran in order to make America richer. He did it because he believes it will stabilize the region and prevent future Presidents from repeating the mistakes of George W. Bush. He does not want America to waste precious resources on pointless wars. Even if Iran does not buy a single thing from America, as long as this deal is upheld, America's interests will be protected."

iran,3dn2pa,rezsahin,5,Fri Jul 17 22:02:48 2015 UTC,"They landed all of their allies in a quagmire too. Bin Laden's 2004 speech:   The events that affected my soul in a direct way started in 1982 when America permitted the Israelis to invade Lebanon and the American Sixth Fleet helped them in that. This bombardment began and many were killed and injured and others were terrorised and displaced.  I couldn't forget those moving scenes, blood and severed limbs, women and children sprawled everywhere. Houses destroyed along with their occupants and high rises demolished over their residents, rockets raining down on our home without mercy.  The situation was like a crocodile meeting a helpless child, powerless except for his screams. Does the crocodile understand a conversation that doesn't include a weapon? And the whole world saw and heard but it didn't respond.  In those difficult moments many hard-to-describe ideas bubbled in my soul, but in the end they produced an intense feeling of rejection of tyranny, and gave birth to a strong resolve to punish the oppressors.  And as I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children.   So you can go and blame that shit on Israel's Dahiya-doctrine."

This was the first conflict that successfully repelled an Israeli invasion.   For what it's worth, even the 1982 invasion is not regarded positively either by Israelis.   The subsequent confidence Israeli leaders had in their ability to deter an all-out Arab attack was reflected in the invasion of Lebanon in 1982. This operation was designed to establish peace with Lebanon, inflict a punishing defeat on Syria, remove the Palestinian problem from the regional agenda, and enable Israeli absorption of the West Bank and Gaza. However, the results of the Lebanon War, including the collapse of ambitions to establish a friendly government in Beirut, deep divisions inside the army and inside Israel, and 18 years of costly and unsuccessful occupation of Lebanese territory exposed the limits of Israeli power and weakened Israel's deterrent.   What Arabs learned from the Lebanon War was not the inevitability of accommodating themselves to Israeli diktats, but the vulnerability of the Israeli army and Israeli society to determined Arab and Muslim political and military action. With the PLO relocated in Tunis and the ""Resistance"" in Lebanon gaining credibility, Palestinians in the occupied territories began to build new forms of distributed, clever and defiant organization that led, five years later, to the Intifada, by any measure a revolutionary act of Palestinian confrontation with Israel.   -- Abandoning the Iron Wall: Israel and ""The Middle Eastern Muck""  These two events combined have led to the usage of the Hebrew term, habotz haLevanoni, which means the ""Lebanese muck.""

iran,3dn2pa,IAma_lama_Ama_,3,Sat Jul 18 01:22:14 2015 UTC,"That question in itself is misleading. A bombing campaign cannot stop Iran from building a nuclear weapon, if the people running the program and the country are determined, it can postpone completion a bit at best. To stop a weapons program by physically destroying the factories and infrastructure involved in the process, you need to do more or less continuous bombing runs on the sites involved, otherwise people will rebuild, improve defenses and hide their sites more effectively. Bombing is only a delaying tactic and it might very well be beyond the capabilities of Israel to delay an Iranian nuclear weapons program by more than a few months. If an attack convinces enough people that Iran really needs those weapons right now, then it might even speed up the program.   It is not possible to prevent Iran from obtaining an atomic bomb by bombing. Unless Israel is going to launch its own nuclear arsenal to do it of course."

First who connected the tablets names with Croatian ethnonym was A. L. Pogodin in 1902.[64][57] First who considered such a thesis and Iranian origin was Konstantin Josef Jireček in 1911.[58] Ten years later, Al. I. Sobolevski gave the first systematic theory about the Iranian origin which until today did not change in basic lines.[58] In the same year, independently Fran Ramovš, with reference to the Iranian interpretation of the name Horoathos by Max Vasmer, concluded that the early Croats were one of Sarmatian tribes which during the great migration advanced along the outer edge of Carpathians (Galicia) to the Vistula and Elbe rivers.[58] The almost final, and more in detail picture was given by Slovenian academic Ljudmil Hauptmann in 1935.[58] He considered that Iranian Croats, after the Huns invasion around 370 when the Huns crossed the Volga river and attacked the Iranian Alans at the Don river, abandoned their initial Sarmatian lands and arrived among the Slavs at the wast lands north of Carpathians, where they gradually Slavicized.[65] There they belonged to the Antes tribal polity until the Antes were attacked by the Avars in 560, and the polity was finally destroyed 602 by the same Avars.[65] The thesis was subsequently supported by Francis Dvornik, George Vernadsky, Roman Jakobson, Tadeusz Sulimirski, and Oleg Trubachyov.[66] In 1985, Omeljan Pritsak considered early Croats a clan of Alan-Iranian origin which during the ""Avarian pax"" had frontiersman-merchant social role.[67]  Origin hypotheses of the Croats"

On the other hand, 3rd writer, Porpgyrogenitus, also writes about about possibility that ""White Croats"" from area of Poland came to present territory of Croatia in order to fight Avars, which gives indication they had history of fighting each other."

Is this same Galicia as this one? My great great grandparents were ethnic Poles that immigrated to the United States during the partition of Poland, so at that time Poland was not a real country that you could write on your immigrant papers. (Or maybe it was possible, but Poles ended up living in a variety of territories.) Anyway, my father found the immigration papers, and he noticed it says that in country of origin they wrote ""Galicia"". I'm still not entirely sure what this means about my family history and possible ancestry."
iran,3dmmg7,marmulak,6,Fri Jul 17 16:38:55 2015 UTC,"There's a special relationship between Iranians and Slavs that a lot of people don't know about. Lots of Slavs and Eastern Europeans like to speculate about having Iranian roots, but it's important to say that both linguistically and genetically Slavs are a distinct group from Iranians. (Although I am not familiar with every single case. It could be that certain Slavic communities have Iranian ancestry.)  Of course, be that as it may, we're both from the Indo-European family, and the Iranian and Slavic branches are not far from each other. The number of Iranic loanwords in Slavic languages is well known to Slavicists.  People used to make fun of me on here for claiming that it's possible that I have Iranian ancestors because of my Eastern European ancestry, but I still think the cultural contact between different ethnic groups in Eurasia is fascinating.  I don't know about -mir and -an because I'm not familiar with rulers in those areas. These thingies are very simple and could very well be false cognates. For example, ""Vladimir"" ends in ""mir"", and ""Miroslav"" begins with it, but I'm pretty sure it's a different ""mir"" than in names like ""Mir Hossein"". -an is another thing that has some basic grammatical function in Persian. Primarily it's a suffix for plurals.  Edit: What does ""mir"" even actually mean in Persian anyway? I know in Russian ""mir"" is a word meaning both ""world"" and ""peace""."

My family immigrated to the US from somewhere that may even now be in the Ukraine. Also, ethnic Polish communities could even be found in the Ottoman Empire.  It was just myself that ""immigrated"" to Tajikistan because my wife is Tajik. I'm actually very Persianized, although my Slavic heritage is actually one of the factors that came into play when I met my wife and considered marrying her. It's hard to say how many Tajiks exactly have Russian ancestry, but Slavic/Persian cultural blending is really strong here.  I might as well be an ethnic Tajik now... I even use a lot of the Russian vocabulary in my everyday speech that my wife's family uses. To some extent it's unavoidable, and also it can just be necessary to communicate with those around me. However, I haven't been able to pass off as Tajik yet except for perhaps some limited circumstances. Most people assume I'm Iranian by a combination of how I talk and look, unless I try really hard to stay in the Tajik dialect, in which case they usually take me for an Afghan. I think part of the issue for them is my appearance, since I'm more Caucasian looking than the average Tajik, although I've seen straight up Russian looking people here speak Tajik with an obviously native accent. Probably he was born and raised here, which is rare because usually the ethnic Russians that lived in Tajikistan spoke Russian almost exclusively, as do some Tajiks.  If I don't say anything at all I think most people in public assume I'm somehow local or from a country that's nearby or familiar to them. When I first got here a lot more people would ask me if I were from Europe or something like that, although it's now happening remarkably less often. I think perhaps I'm subconsciously becoming more like them. >_> Also if you speak their language well enough it's hard for them to mentally process that you're a foreigner."

I almost became Hindu but couldn't accept all the superstitions and cultural baggage, so I ended up becoming Muslim instead mainly because of the monotheistic basis and simple, fundamental practices. I met my wife several years later, although prior to my conversion I did have some Muslim friends and dated a Muslim girl before I got around to studying Islam more carefully. I did appreciate the Islamic lifestyle and values.  Mainly I cam to Tajikistan to further my cultural understanding and experience since I studied the language extensively. It was actually my studies in Persian language and the Tajik dialect that led me to meeting my wife. We don't really want to raise our kids here, which is kind of ironic, but also being close to her family was important to me. We're going to move for school most likely, and raise our kids wherever our careers take us."

For many, the reason why their parents left Iran is to ensure that their Judaism would not be challenged.  These factors affect different people in different ways.  There are 3 parts to that identity, that is, Iranian, American, and Jewish, and it depends on which 1/3 resonates most with that individual.

I know some on the internet and they feel very attached to the culture even if they've never been to Iran. I also honestly think US-born Iranian Jews are more likely to speak Persian than US-born Iranian Muslims.  But I will say this: as someone that knows a lot of Jews, grew up around them, always lived in parts of London full of Jews, I can say as a fact many of them do not feel a loyalty to the country they live in, are citizens of or originate from. Israel usually take precedence. One very telling example is that more British Jews are currently serving in the Israeli military than the British military. Where I live in London you see more Israeli flags attached to people's cars or homes than British flags, which is something I personally find quite disrespectful.   I see no reason why this shouldn't be the case with the Iranian Jewish diaspora. I know despite feeling an attachment to Iran, most of them do feel a very strong attachment to Israel too and do a lot of charity and fundraising for Israeli causes. Of course they'll then defend Israel over Iran. It applies to all Jews though, whether they be from Russia, France or India. How do you think AIPAC became so powerful and influential if American Jews didn't prioritise Israel over America? How did Netanyahu disrespect America so much and speak in Congress if American Jews didn't prioritise Israel over America?  Most Jews that are more loyal to their own countries than Israel are assimilated Jews, which are very common in the USA now seeing as most American Jews now marry non-Jews and do not participate in Jewish society anymore. It's a bit different in Europe, I find Jews in the UK more closed and I rarely see Jews dating non-Jews let alone marrying them (and I only know secular Jews).

iran,3dljch,ShiraziGuy,3,Fri Jul 17 07:57:50 2015 UTC,"Jewish Iranians, as a group, are pretty attached to Iran. Like any group of Iranians with a minority culture, many among them obviously come to see themselves as apart from the Iranian norm in some way. You see this with some Kurdish Iranians as well. With Jewish Iranians, the very intense promotion of Jewish nationalism, and the idea of a ""Jewish people"", in the West, compounds this tendency to distance themselves from their Iranianism. Ironically, Jewish Iranians genetically cluster with other Iranian groups, and are culturally arguably more Iranian than Muslim Iranians, as they've preserved more pre-Islamic Persian customs."

I should also add though that most Iranian Jews no longer have any family in Iran but do have family in Israel, which adds another layer of detachment. Overall though, there is this sentiment of the infallibility of Israel that many American Jews of all backgrounds share. The ones that have this sentiment are often very vocal, so you'll see their posts on FB more than those with a moderate position.  To address your other points though, claiming that Iranian Jews should support Iran now because of what Koorosh did thousands of years ago doesn't follow directly. It's almost like the reverse of being anti-Italy because the Roman Empire sacked Jerusalem and exiled the Jews. Not saying that Iran as a nation or a people shouldn't be supported, but that's just not a reason everyone can get behind, though it is the reason I chose my flair for this subreddit.  As for the intermarriage ""problem,"" traditionally Jews believe that the religion is passed down through matrilineal descent (ie your mother must be Jewish for your to be automatically Jewish), so of course Jews will marry other Jews. If you mean marriage solely within the Jewish Iranian community, most of the people I personally know have married American Jews if they grew up here."

iran,3dljch,Persiandude73,-1,Fri Jul 17 14:58:33 2015 UTC,"Well, let's get historical and contextual.  The general view of Iran-Persia among Jews and Christians has been positive for thousands of years. Persia comes off as positive in the Bible. Great civilization, etc. Simplistic, of course. Most people had never traveled to Iran or knew an Iranian.  Then came 1979. I honestly think most Americans and Westerners realized the Shah was an autocrat and hoped for a democratic-Republic--sort of like the first Russian revolution.  But then the Bolshevik equivalent seized power. It's hard to describe the hatred most Americans felt for the Ayatollah...and since then it seems that Iran has tried its best to act the part of the evil, cackling super baddies. From the Marine Barracks to the Argentine Jewish Center to The Syria War (which is one big Iranian Black Op), Iran has made itself lol evil.  You can't keep churning out hate for others and expect them to love you? Right now, any Jewish or Christian misgivings about Iran is wholly eclipsed by outright screaming hatred of Iran among many, many Sunnis. Have you ever watched talk shows in SA or Egypt? The mass of Sunnis pretty much blame Iran for everything. When I talk to my Sunni friends I'm the moderate. They see Iran as all bad.  So you ask why Jews whose parents were citizens of Iran might not cheer the Ayatollahs? Sorry, you should, ask why so many people hate Iran.  Solution: Have another revolution, please. Set up a democratic republic and respect the rights of Jews, Baha'is, etc. Stop supporting the Asaad criminal dynasty. Stop supporting the puppet government in Iraq...  Again, I love Iranians. Never met anyone who didn't like them on a personal basis...but you have a crew of sociopathic religious nuts running your government, so please understand why we non-Iranians might not be so fulsome in our praise of your Country.  Bless you....I know you are not the government."

iran,3dn29i,two_line_pass,2,Sat Jul 18 04:03:44 2015 UTC,I reaaaally doubt that has anything to do with it.

Two questions:   How do think the recent nuclear deal will affect the everyday lives of regular Iranians? Whats the significance of the deal other than economic and military advantages? A la Parts Unknown, what is the beautiful side of Iran which is relatively not shown in the media?"

Food, music, arts, scenery, philosophy, I suppose religion, and even science in a way that is uniquely Iranian beyond what the bearded soldiers in combat fatigues marching in lockstep suggest."

I look forward to visiting iran someday.  anyways, let's move on to my question:  manila has an infamous metro rail system that consistently receives negative feedback in the subreddit for good reason. I'm wondering how other cities' metros fare in comparison, and how manila can improve with that in mind. now, how is tehran's own metro system? what do you guys think about it?"

I was attacked in the metro once,  nothing serious though.   Your police need to be more brutal haha, idk really, I just ride the metro to work everyday, and I haven't been to manila's metros, so I can't really pinpoint anything that works. As far as assault goes, Iran's trains are segregated, that might help in Manila with the sexual attacks."

iran,3dksx6,hojjat12000,4,Fri Jul 17 07:30:33 2015 UTC,We are not free to express our selves. especially about religion or politics. We used to be more free when Khatami was our president. But Ahmadinejad ruined everything. Rouhani is trying to fix Ahmadinejad's mistakes. But he doesn't care about human rights and citizen rights. He is preoccupied by our sanctions and our poor economy.  We are very much happy about this deal. Living under sanctions is brutal. Also living under the threat of war is also horrible.

Can people convert to other religions from Islam?  What about the freedom not to believe in any god?

Nobody tries to convert others here, Muslims don't do it to non-Muslims and non-Muslims don't try to do it to Muslims. It's illegal to try and convert others , although the only people who have trouble with this law are the evangelicals (a sect of Christianity that isn't naitive to Iran like Armenian orthodox)   What percentage of the population do you think want more freedoms, specifically freedom of speech and expression?   Uh, everybody? These are baisic things everyone wants.    available in Iran or are news and certain sites blocked?   Yeah, they're blocked, but you can just bypass the censors with a VPN.    How about the rights and respect to non persians in Iran   They are treated the same as Persians.

However, the government recognizes the feast by making the day an official holiday. This means everyone, regardless of religion, gets the day off.   Like most holidays, the meaning of this one is usually lost to most people so many go on vacations unrelated to the feast.   Since this one falls on a Friday, we have a long weekend so we take advantage of this by either staying at home resting or going to beaches.   This is not in disrespect to the feast. We also do this to Christian holidays like the Holy week or All Saint's day.   I am neither Christian nor Muslim so I get to enjoy these holidays guilt-free :)"

iran,3dksx6,imonkeyah,2,Sat Jul 18 17:41:02 2015 UTC,"You asked some great questions! I'm not an expert in politics, but I can try to answer some of your questions.  First off, you should know that Iranian politics are not always representative of the people. Iranian people are some of the most westernized people in the region and tourists including Americans are very welcomed there. In the case of the ""death to america"" chants, these are only for political purposes, they are sang only by a small minority and are not meant literally. The reasons for it goes back to 1953: a coup d'état perpetuated by the CIA to overthrow the democratically elected prime minister, the support for the Shah, then the role of the US in Iran-Iraq war, etc.  Same thing applies to the Holocaust. Iranians generally believe in the holocaust. There was even a TV show in Iran about an Iranian diplomat who help Jews escaping from Nazis.  About the gays however, I feel that Iranians are not as open minded as they are about other subjects. Even the educated bunch see homosexuality as an illnes. Hopefully it will get better with time."
iran,3dksx6,gmvancity,2,Sat Jul 18 22:19:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you for enlightening me on the death to America chants.    I am Filipino and live in Canada now.  And the Philippines and the US are close allies.  The Philippines was once a colony of the US.  In fact,  there was a war in 1898 where more than 100k Filipinos died in the fight against American colonization.  But since then,  the friendship and relationship with the US has grown.    As to death for America,  that was an interesting explanation.  And enlightening.  I mean,  if let's say the Philippines and Iran were not friends and you guys kept chanting death to the Philippines,  I as a Filipino will feel threatened and not like that chant.  But as you said,  it is political and by a small minority.    Hopefully Iran will become part of the world again and hopefully it will help bring about peace.  There are lots of persians here in Vancouver Canada and they are very enterprising,  educated,  entrepreneurial. Etc.  They are not interested in war and nuclear weapons.

iran,3dk4h5,Stealthy_Lehninger,16,Fri Jul 17 00:03:10 2015 UTC,"It's important not to look at the issue through a simple sectarian lens. When other articles reduce the conflict to a Shia vs. Sunni struggle and fail to mention Saudi Arabia's deliberate role, it's usually a good sign the author has no idea what they're talking about or their bread is getting buttered elsewhere. Consider the following cases:   Iran supported the largely Sunni Northern Alliance in Afghanistan. Saudia Arabia in turn supported the sectarian Taliban to oppose them. Iran used to support Sunni Hamas when it was purely the force for resistance. Saudi Arabia took over when Hamas turned sectarian over the Syrian issue. Iran currently supports both Shia and Sunni militias in Iraq, giving aid to Sunni Turkmens and Kurds against Wahhabi ideology funded largely by donors from Saudi Arabia. Iran cooperates with Sunni Pakistan, while Saudi Arabia funds Jundullah (sectarian terrorists) in Balochistan provinces.    The KSA is an artificial state: the Wahhabis, who are a Sunni minority, can't achieve natural legitimacy at home so they must rely on foreign powers to consolidate their rule. This upside-down pyramid set up is deliberate enough to ensure that the country with one of the world's largest hydrocarbon reserves would never achieve self-rule and become self-determined. In order to thusly remain in power, the Wahhabi minority must succumb to will of their foreign masters and act in accordance. To date, and shown in the examples given above, this will is to be carried out against Iran.   It is the KSA's supreme guiding principle to oppose Iran in every aspect and shape possible -- even if it means going as far as aligning with Israel, which has a clout in Washington. Since it won't last a minute without American support, anything it says or does is given by America.  So to stop the ""whole Sunni-Shia conflict,"" one has to stop Saudi Arabia. Yet Saudi Arabia is merely a puppet in this game, so in reality, the ball is in America's court."

iran,3dk4h5,Stealthy_Lehninger,2,Fri Jul 17 08:54:12 2015 UTC,"It seems not and the Arabs will not a stop to it. It has been going on for hundreds of years. Saudi Arabia in particular is investing more in western countries such a Canada, England, Australia to build Islamic schools and mosques. Some of which are being opposed by local residence, but hence local councils are interested in the money, they don’t really look in to the negative impact it will have safety wise. Lets face it , it has been verified  Saudis are investing in these establishments to import their brand of Islam, which is combination of Wahhabism and terrorism. Lets not forget how the invaded Persians by savagery and force, but Persian repelled this and shaped their own version of Islam. It is also the fact that Saudi’s are taking similar approach to Zionist but investing heavily in media and influencing politicians by means of providing financial aid so they could buy their immunity and at the same time advertise for their own gain.  But have in mind that the state of Saudi Arabia is weak and fragile politically and its only the matter of time that it will crumble just like Iraq and Syria. It’s a shame and smart move that they use religion as a source of gain and unfortunately hey have made fools of every Muslim to go on a  pilgrim to their holy cities and spend thousands while other in world suffer from hunger an disease, while they spent people’s money on lavish hotels and Lebanese hookers, and child prostitutes from Bangladesh and Indonesia. At one stage they even used to kidnap Iranian girls for sale as human sex slaves and were eventually murder or force to marriage.  They should be sanctioned and branded as a terrorist breading nation with no respect for human rights."

iran,3dgl9r,felinebeeline,11,Thu Jul 16 02:44:21 2015 UTC,"I went to Georgia and South Ossetia last summer to study their language and I had a generally nice experience. Since /u/dfc222 already covered the major points very accurately, I won't need to repeat them, but I can tell you the specific details:   Everyone in Georgia, including the Ossetes, assumed I was from the Republic of Azerbaijan (I'm indeed from Iranian Azerbaijan so they weren't too far off) and automatically spoke Russian to me at the beginning of every interaction. It got annoying after a while, but it was understandable since that's how all the post-Soviet countries communicate across borders.  When I told them I was from Iran, the Georgians became more welcoming but also more cautious. Iran luckily has a reputation of sticking out for Caucasian Christians in its support for Armenia, but it also has close cooperations with Russia which makes Georgia look for allies in NATO rather than Iran. Ossetes were unaffected by this fact, and the ones who supported unification with North Ossetia were even approving of Iran-Russia relations.  Most Ossetes were self-aware of their Iranic identity -- after all, they call their language Iron. I was pleasantly surprised when many people knew about the Shahnameh and even the connection between Ossetians and the Kingdom of the Alans. Many trace their political claim to the land to the Scythians, which is their main source of disagreement with the Georgians. Even more surprising, I should say, was when a couple of students recited some parts of it in original (albeit broken and heavily accented) Persian.  The Ossetes, like most Iranians, are very politicized people. I went there during the Israeli incursion into Gaza and the heat of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict. The debates were fierce in the middle of the tea house, with many claiming that after Crimea, South Ossetia will be the next Russian annexation and others claiming that Georgia might take preventative measures -- in the manner of Israel against Gaza -- too early for that to happen. What a strange coincidence it must have been for them that these two conflicts occurred at the same time.  My opinion, which I didn't assert too heavily both due to the language barrier and worries of overstaying my welcome, is that Georgia should maintain its territorial integrity while also upholding the rights and freedoms of the Ossetian people. A multicultural and just combination of Georgia and Ossetia will be more powerful than an unjust, fractured state. Or a state under Russia, for that matter. Efforts to connect North and South Ossetia should also happen.   In all, like many post-Soviet nations, Georgia and Ossetia are both culturally very Russified. However, the constant Ossetian desire for unification has the positive byproduct of making these people proud of their religion, language, and history."
iran,3dgl9r,rezsahin,2,Thu Jul 16 13:00:40 2015 UTC,"This is fantastic; thanks so much! It looks like they were wise in their predictions about Russian encroachment on their territory. That is surprising to me as well regarding their knowledge of the Shahnameh, and quite impressive.   I have a few questions for you, if that's alright.   Do Ossetians taarof? (Starting with the important stuff...) To the best of your knowledge, compared to traveling in Western Europe, is there a bigger safety gap between men traveling alone in S. Ossetia and women traveling alone there?  What was the prevailing attitude toward the Israel/Gaza conflict? What documentation is necessary to legitimately enter South Ossetia? How does one qualify for it in America and/or Iran? Whom are the various institutions led by and how is it or isn't it organized? What I've read on Wikipedia and State.gov is very vague and undetailed. Do people drop dead left and right from a lack of medicine? Is medical care very expensive there? Does Georgia have any administrative control?  Does anyone travel there for tourism without having a specific connection or going there as a student or for work? Is there any conflict between religious groups, particularly against religious or non-religious minorities? Did you get the impression that the are militarily organized? Did you produce a document that became public or is it strictly in-house research?  Is Iron pronounced like ""Iran""? Also, what is South Ossetia called in Iran and what is their language called in Iran?  What is the education system like there? Is public education available, and if so, up to what age? Who administers this? Does any entity collect taxes? Also, what is higher education like there? How many universities are there and how competitive and costly is it?"
iran,3dgl9r,rezsahin,2,Fri Jul 17 03:19:51 2015 UTC,"Not in the same manner as Iranians, but the code of hospitality is still there.  It's the same for both men and women: generally unsafe. As with any impoverished place, the possibility of crime is greater and women may face more danger when traveling alone. They negatively view Israel's actions towards Gaza. For them, the incident was another demonstration of an occupying power's brutality. They feared that Georgia might apply the same tactics, and the international community would be just as silent. They praised Iran's support for the Palestinian people. You can only get to South Ossetia from Russia. So I had to apply for both a Georgian and Russian visa. Anyone who is not a citizen of Russia has to go through South Ossetia's Foreign Ministry, which will interview you extensively. Having an Iranian passport helped for once, and so did showing them my research and university papers. It's a mess. The separatist government controls the capital and most towns around it, the Georgian government controls villages around the border. There's no clear split, which is another source of turmoil. There is a hospital there but I'm not sure of its costs. I didn't see anyone die, but rubble from the 2008 war still stood in some areas. I didn't see many tourists there; I was even advised to not take pictures as it would attract unwanted attention. I only have some pictures of Georgia and the farmlands leading to South Ossetia. The few foreigners there were humanitarian workers. Not at all, because the conflict is over ethnicity and land. Both sides are mainly Orthodox Christians. There are said to be some Sunni Ossetes, but I didn't encounter any.  Indeed. Russian ""peacekeeping"" forces and their outposts are visible in most places.  Privately sponsored university research. The abstracts were translated to Russian, printed out, and given to the Foreign Ministry. They cared more about my connection to and role in the university to ensure the documents weren't fabricated. Which, in the end, meant showing them how much I paid to attend. It's pronounced like ee-rohn, and they call their country Iristan. In Iran it's simply called Ossetia, and the language Ossetiyai. Not sure about how much it costs, but there is only one noteworthy university there. Russia and the Provincial Government collect taxes and maintain it, along with the public school system. Their currency is the Russian Ruble and Russia maintains a tight control over Ossetia's nonsensically dependent economy. The university students are usually from poor backgrounds, as the wealthier types leave to study in Russia. The population of South Ossetia is little more than a large American town, so there is barely a handful of universities and schools."

One guy went to Iraq, one to Afghanistan, two (including myself) to Georgia, and the rest decided to play it safe and go to India."
iran,3dgl9r,rezsahin,2,Sat Jul 18 02:34:40 2015 UTC,"I would have made the same choice you did. Btw, I had typed up a long list of questions and my computer restarted and I lost them all and had to start over, so I ended up forgetting some. Argh. But I just remembered a couple of them!   Can Ossetians freely go to any part of Georgia and vice versa?  I know you said you went to study their language, but had you already begun studying it before that? If so, what programs/books/etc. did you use? Do many people there speak English? Do they teach a second language in school? Is Russian the default taught as a second language?"
iran,3dgl9r,dfc222,2,Sat Jul 18 03:57:07 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's too bad. If you end up remembering the other ones, feel free to PM them to me. I'll be happy to answer them.   No, they can't, security checkpoints won't allow it which is why it's only possible to enter South Ossetia from the Russian border. I should also mention that once someone enters South Ossetia, they will have a hard time getting back into Georgia from the Russian border. We left Russia from Beslan Airport (North Ossetia). We had an Afghan professor who knew Ossetian and other Iranian languages (like Pashto), so he taught us some basic phrases and how to read the alphabet.  Very few people there know English. It's essentially like a remote Iranian shahrestan. Almost everyone knew Russian though, and it is the default language taught in schools. Russian is so pervasive that there are campaigns within Ossetia to further encourage the use of Ossetian. Some members of the younger generation barely understand Ossetian. Since they all have Russian citizenship, many of them find no reason to know Ossetian and view Russian as a more ""useful"" language."
iran,3dgl9r,tinlizzey12,2,Sat Jul 18 05:18:59 2015 UTC,"Cheers; I'll keep that in mind. :)  The Welsh have, in the past few years, also made a number of efforts to encourage/preserve the use of their language (Cymraeg). Were I an Ossete, I think I would be among those encouraging the use and preservation of Ossetian. Languages dying is a sad thing, in my opinion. It's an essential part of culture, history, and identity, and no one language captures everything that another language does. I have a Dutch friend who thinks that their language should be abandoned and that they should all just speak English, as well as the rest of the world; that there should only be one language in the world, English, to make communication easy and possible between all peoples. While he is not wrong that such a benefit would result, I would hate for all other languages to disappear. What do you think?"

iran,3dgl9r,tinlizzey12,5,Thu Jul 16 03:57:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response.    The language isn't very intelligible to a Farsi speaker.    I watched a couple of YouTube videos of Ossetians speaking and came to the same conclusion. A couple of the words were intelligible, but certainly not the majority.   I, too, have long had an interest in Ossetians. When I was in college, I wanted to study in South Ossetia and learn more about its history and relations of the people with Iran, as well as compare and contrast the culture and language. Unfortunately, the ongoing political turmoil did not make this possible."

It was an important admission because this very fact had been denied at the time of the Iranian revolution in 1979 by the Ayatullah’s office in Gumran, outside Tehran.

iran,3dcync,IAma_lama_Ama_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:16:55 2015 UTC,"""but, but Israel has them so why not Iran?"" doesnt sound a bit childish to you?    Nope. The only people who're wholly childish on this issue have a star of david on their flag and claim that they're the ones who created hummus.   Also, that's not what I said. You're lying again.  What I said was, Israel's nuclear sites ought to be inspected and that state should comply to international regulations as far as nuclear weapons go, before anyone starts jerking off over ""b-but nuclear proliferation because the Iran deal!""    We know that Israel has had a bomb for a while now and has kept it safe and secure.   Nope. We know that they have a supremely retarded ""maybe we do, maybe we don't"" policy when it comes to the existence of their 200-400 nuclear weapons. We know that they absolutely refuse to have their facilities inspected or, as I said, comply to any international regulations as far as nuclear weapons are concerned.  Some good advice for lurking Israeli muppets-- going ""oh but we didn't sign the non-proliferation treaty!"" doesn't make you look good or ""better"". It makes you look worse.    Can we trust Iran not to give a potential weapon to Hezbollah or the Houthis or some other proxy?   You trust and believe lying Israelis and assume that the Iranians are lying to a man because the Israelis say they are.   That disqualifies any of your babbling from being seriously considered, in my opinion.  If Iran hypothetically makes any nuclear weapon to use as leverage or a power asset, why in the world would they hand it out to any other group, when it's purpose would be as a strategic asset? As in being a nuclear-armed power?   They seem to do fine when it comes to shipping conventional weapons to Hezbollah. Hezbollah certainly wouldn't use a nuclear weapon in a million years, outside the rabid and delusional fantasies of Israelis."

As much as I despise many aspects of the leadership of the IRI and have several very good reasons to not recognize them as a legitimate state entity in any shape or form, I still have to wonder what sort of leadership the OP would provide were he in Khamenei's place, to speak so nonchalantly about Khamenei's death as though it would be something desirable or that the annihilation of a person - no matter how bad - is something to which we should pay no mind."

Instead you have Netanyahu and his cronies trying to disrupt progress. Why not take advantage of the deal and try taking the first steps to sorting things out with your neighbors?  Yes, congrats. The IDF provide Intel and train forces (every Western country does that and more). The IDF are at the forefront of demolishing occupied territory. I will say, Israel treating Syrians at the border is noble and a good gesture.  And yeah sure, ""cute"". Go on patronize, me more. Hezbollah and Iran have no intention of outright striking Israel (especially after the deal that was reached). How can you can continue playing the victims with your military, that easily outclasses every other one in the region? In the event of you fighting a defensive war, then you'd have more than enough support from the West.  I don't understand, these opportunities are presented and rather than seeking reconciliation, people would rather be fighting (this goes for hardliners on each end). Israel could very well be instrumental in leading the region to prosperity, if they put more effort and resources into incrementally lowering hostilities, rather than participating in them.

Look it up and find out what the leadership of Iran really think of Israel, USA and the rest of the West.  Israel would love nothing more than to live peacefully with its neighbors, which is why there are peace agreements with Egypt, Jordan, and renewed talks with Saudi Arabia.  Guess what though, Iran wants to control the Middle East, not mend relations with its neighbors - they plan on doing it with an atomic bomb and their proxy armies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon.  This deal will start a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.     ""Yes, congrats. The IDF provide Intel and train forces (every Western country does that and more).

iran,3d8659,boushveg,21,Tue Jul 14 07:46:44 2015 UTC,"Israel fought desperately to preserve its outsized influence in the region. Its influence derives from its unique relationship to the world's superpower, which naturally also enables it to transgress international norms with relative impunity. It fought with lies, assassinations, and arrogance, even attempting to maintain its relationship with the United States by openly subverting its President in Congress. Perhaps, in the decades to come, this deal will lead Israeli decision-makers to understand that its relationship to the United States cannot be completely divorced from the quality of Israeli conduct.  We, as Iranians, should nonetheless view this deal as an internal achievement, rather than some kind of victory over Israel. I am partly ashamed to see the top comments as those that stick tongues out to Netanyahu or r/Israel. You and I have nothing in our blood that makes Israelis our enemies.  This deal is much more so a victory for the Iranian people and its legitimate government. I smile at the prospect of future finance and wealth inside Iran. Let us not turn our inward joy into outward gloating. Its treacheries aside, all Israel has done has been in attempt to preserve the uniqueness of its relationship with the United States. And treachery is a given, when states pursue their own interests. We do it and have it done to us. It is a fact that we should approach soberly. Why be proud of Assad's pilots while being hateful of the Saudi's or Israel's? The prize of this deal is not their weakness, but the chance of our internal strength and development."

You see, Israel really has no beef with anyone in the region (beside the Palestinian Arabs), but everyone else seems to be keen on actively fighting us. Israel and Iran are very far away from each other, and Israel does not threaten Iran in any way shape or form.  Netanyahu was against this deal partly because the removal of sanctions will embolden the Iranian gov't to keep funding our enemies.  Anyway, congrats on the deal... but at the end of the day, your country is still run by a brutal theocratic dictatorship, and there you have a lot to learn from Israel."
iran,3d8659,Caleb666,4,Tue Jul 14 16:14:39 2015 UTC,"Then why are you actively arming our enemies?   These ""enemies"" have been fighting to remove the occupiers from their land. Israel is currently illegally occupying the Golan Heights of Syria, the West Bank of Palestine, and illegally blockading Gaza of Palestine. Previously Israel was illegally occupying Southern Lebanon but thankfully it withdrew from there.   You see, Israel really has no beef with anyone in the region (beside the Palestinian Arabs)   So as long as Israel is the occupier in the region it will always be seen as an evil, foreign colony in the Middle East. Israel has done nothing to prove its neighborliness ever since 1948. All these years now and still no peace agreement with Palestine to allow for the region to recognize Israel's nationhood.   Netanyahu was against this deal partly because the removal of sanctions will embolden the Iranian gov't to keep funding our enemies.   If Israel made peace with the Palestinians, withdrew from occupied West Bank and Golan Heights, ended the settlements and exploitation of natural resources on occupied land, and halted the blockade on Gaza, the whole region will recognize Israel and you will have no more enemies. Hitler's Germany and Napoleon's France, two conquerors in Europe, were also treated harshly by their neighbors until their countries ended their imperial ambitions.   Anyway, congrats on the deal... but at the end of the day, your country is still run by a brutal theocratic dictatorship, and there you have a lot to learn from Israel.   Thanks, I believe this deal is a victory for not only Iranians but Americans, Europeans, Israelis, and all other people of our region.

iran,3d8659,ShiraziGuy,2,Tue Jul 14 20:51:01 2015 UTC,"Forgive me if you find the quote trite, but ""war is merely the continuation of policy by other means."" Iran and Israel have warred and still war upon each other, which includes Iran's arming of proxies, because the two states have conflicting policies. Israel aims to rapidly develop a prosperous and secure state for the Jewish peoples. In the face of enemies, it has premised its security on a form of regional domination and, all things considered, fairly minor expansion. Its ability to thus dominate and expand requires a strong, essentially monopolistic client relationship with the United States.  Iran aims to (again, ever again) restore a prosperous and secure state that is indigenous and maintains broad territorial integrity. Iran's blessing has always been its land. The Iranian plateau possesses enough natural power to have harbored and made cohesive the peoples within it throughout much of history, despite their differences and many harsh events along the way.  Iran's policy of restoring natural power threatens Israeli policy and vice versa in at least two ways. First, it challenges Israel's security at face, inasmuch as Israeli security is premised on regional domination. Second, as a natural power, Iran at capacity provides a very attractive ally to other global actors with interests in the region. Remember that Iran, not Israel, was the United States' top ally in the Middle East not long ago.  These are the policy conflicts at root of our having each others blood on our hands. (That is, if you ask me, which you have.) I say ""at root"" because there are also more superficial reasons, which otherwise derive from the policies above. For instance, in order to have an indigenous government, Iran has embraced a political form of Islam; and it has strategically capitalized on anti-Israeli Islamic populism in the Arab world to gain soft power. You might think soft power abroad is inherently imperialistic and menacing, but all responsible states play the game, so to speak; and recall that Iran has suffered threats and indeed actual harms to its sovereignty repeatedly in the near past. Because this is superficial, it can change. It will change as Islam changes, which it has rapidly; it will change as the Iranian people's relationship to Islam and its government changes; and it may also change if Israel begins to premise its security on something other than regional dominance.  I will take issue with your final words. You should not deign to tell us what our government is. I invite you to learn its structure, the role of the leader, and how political accountability functions in our republic. No one pretends it is a painless affair, especially given substantial partisan differences inside Iran. Nonetheless, the very deal today was a manifestation of the people's political will. Our form of representation may move more slowly, but the people are not absent from it. Countermajoritarian features, like the United States' Supreme Court (which changes law dramatically without say of Congress or the President), alone do not make for a dictatorship. For that matter, allegations of vote rigging in Iran, etc., have been quite thoroughly discredited by independent polling organizations.  You should also not deign to pretend that Israel is not brutal."
iran,3d8659,leisurelycommenter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:11:01 2015 UTC,"I can tell that a lot of thought went into the writing of that comment, so here is what I could say to that:   Iran's policy of restoring natural power threatens Israeli policy and vice versa in at least two ways. First, it challenges Israel's security at face, inasmuch as Israeli security is premised on regional domination.   I agree with this in theory, but I think you aren't taking it far enough. Iran's ambition seems to be to be able to withstand not only Israel, but also the USA, at least on their home turf. If Israel's protector loses its dominant position in the Mid East, even if only slightly, then Israel as a client becomes weaker too. Israelis would be the first people to notice the waning of US military domination. So if we say that the USA has a slightly weaker position in the Mid East with a strong Iran, then the Americans might still be able to get everything that they need from the region, but they might lack that little bit extra to give Israel the complete cover it seeks.  That said, I find the next one doubtful:   Second, as a natural power, Iran at capacity provides a very attractive ally to other global actors with interests in the region. Remember that Iran, not Israel, was the United States' top ally in the Middle East not long ago.   Iran will not be a reliable ally for the USA for quite some time yet, as far as public perception gos. The American public would not tolerate an open declaration of alliance. Look at the grand standing in Congress when Bibi went there to talk to the republicans, that was really popular. There is a strong anti Iran feeling among those Americans who even know where the country is. Add to that the many Persians who fled the revolution and ended up in the USA, those people don't want to strengthen the regime either. In the face of the constant anti Americanism that the Iranian government has been spewing for decades, they too would find it hard to explain the 180 when they are suddenly supposed to be American allies. So the best that can probably achieved is an under the table agreement and quiet cooperation, not a full and open alliance, and the first will only happen if most of the Iranian and US interests align. Seeing how they don't agree on the Syrian question, we might say that this is less than likely any time soon."

How can you support a theocratic regime that executes political dissenters and homosexuals? I guess it's not that hard for you since you also probably support Hamas whose end-goal is a global Sharia where non-Muslims are bound to Muslims, and where the only woman's right is to to do what her husband tells her."
iran,3d8659,Caleb666,5,Tue Jul 14 20:17:37 2015 UTC,"How can you support a theocratic regime that executes political dissenters and homosexuals?    Iran doesn't actually execute homosexuals. A couple homosexual teenagers were executed several years ago, and the warmongering anti-Iranianists have been jumping up and down and repeating how Iran executes homosexuals ever since (when, ironically, the war and indiscriminate sanctions they advocate kill thousands of innocent Iranians every year), when in fact, they were executed for raping a 12 year old boy, and not for homosexuality. There is a very large population of homosexuals in Iran, and they are not subject to capital punishment.   The execution of dissenters has pretty much stopped as well. Most dissenters get a few months, and at most, a few years in prison. Iran is far from perfect, but then what nation, particularly in the Middle East, is?"

There's isn't a large population of homosexuals, it's an illegal act that can get you executed. Executions of homosexuals may not happen often but it's still allowed under the law, just like executions for apostates from Islam. Iran is one of the worst places on earth to be gay.   Political dissent in Iran is not allowed. Writing blogs critical of the government is worthy of imprisonment, even my cousin's husband is monitored and has to regularly have check ups with the authorities because in the past he had a blog where he made minor criticisms of the government. Look no further than the cartoonist Atena Farghadani in solitary confinement practically for an entire year for making harmless cartoons."

There are no credible reports of individuals being executed for homosexuality in recent years, and there IS a large population of homosexuals in Iran, some of them very obviously homosexual (there are even forced sex re-assignment surgeries for those who are openly gay, showing that execution is not used to punish homosexuality in practice).  Execution of dissidents meanwhile is very rare, and reserved for committed opponents of the regime. Does this mean that the Iranian government doesn't persecute dissidents? No of course not. But again, that doesn't mean one shouldn't challenge lies exaggerating the brutality of the Iranian government's practices, intended solely to sell indiscriminate sanctions against the Iranian people.  The sanctions retard development of Iran's civil society, place hardships on the people, and prevents the increase in knowledge and connectivity within the Iranian populace that leads to better protection of human rights."

A man in Iran has been sentenced to death for ""insulting the prophet of Islam"" on Facebook.  Soheil Arabi, a 30-year-old blogger, was convicted in August after admitting posting ""offensive"" material on eight Facebook pages, under different names, including one titled 'the generation that no longer wants to be the burnt generation'.   I know this sub is full of nationalists that hate it when anyone criticizes the Iranian government, but I have a hard time believing people here are so deluded that they'd defend sentencing someone to death for writing an anti-Muhammad message on their Facebook."

Would you rather I allow the lie that Iran executes homosexuals to stand?  And as for Arabi, he was executed because the Iranian government is still an authoritarian theocracy, that will not tolerate one of its subjects repeatedly challenging its legitimacy by ridiculing its religious foundations. Again, no one said the Iranian government is above fault. There's a difference between admitting there are problems in Iran, and believing in every single lie spread about the Iranian government in order to sell the idea that it is the worst government in the Middle East, and needs special attention from the US in the form of war and indiscriminate sanctions against its entire populace.   but I have a hard time believing people here are so deluded that they'd defend sentencing someone to death for writing an anti-Muhammad message on their Facebook.

Again, there are tens of thousands of homosexuals in Iran, some of them not living particularly hidden lives. There is no way homosexuality could be a capital offence in Iran and be as common as it is.   When your government   How about you cut the racism and stop assuming every person of apparent Iranian descent is represented by the Iranian government. No wonder you are crying crocodile tears for Iranians executed by the Iranian government. You want to create a cassus belli for sanctioning tens of millions of Iranians, because you are racist toward them, and are willing to see more them killed to achieve your political agenda.   finally admit it's an incredibly shitty regime that's not worth defending in the slightest. And yes, one of the worst in the Middle-East.   It's not ""incredibly shitty"" by Middle Eastern standards. This is a region where the supposedly democratic and liberal state, Israel, keeps five million people under a 47 year military occupation, and where its leader, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, praised a man who said ""the sole purpose of non-Jews is to serve Jews"", as one of the country's ""wisest men""."

Without that, they have no place in the world – only to serve the People of Israel,” he said in his weekly Saturday night sermon on the laws regarding the actions non-Jews are permitted to perform on Shabbat.  According to Yosef, the lives of non-Jews in Israel are safeguarded by divinity, to prevent losses to Jews.  “In Israel, death has no dominion over them... With gentiles, it will be like any person – they need to die, but [God] will give them longevity. Why? Imagine that one’s donkey would die, they’d lose their money.  This is his servant... That’s why he gets a long life, to work well for this Jew,” Yosef said.  “Why are gentiles needed? They will work, they will plow, they will reap. We will sit like an effendi and eat.  That is why gentiles were created,” he added.  Yosef’s Saturday night sermons have seen many controversial statements from the 90-year-old rabbi. In August, Yosef caused a diplomatic uproar when he wished a plague upon the Palestinian people and their leaders, a curse he retracted a few weeks later, when he blessed them along with all of Israel’s other peace-seeking neighbors.     wow!"

It does not need to somehow independently pass or otherwise ratify the deal. Its control is limited to affirmatively retracting the deal. That means, if Congress wants to act, it will need to overcome the President's veto.  As for the next administration: the deal will create obligations for the U.S. that will outlast the President.

Don't forget that if there was the will to do so, Washington can find other ways to escalate tensions with Iran if it wanted to that don't concern the deal. And I strongly appreciate the fact that this deal isn't between just the US and Iran. If Iran was isolated and US military leaders deemed it doable there would have been full regime change years ago.

I did have a guide and we did have to file an itinerary and stick to it but in no way did I feel minded or prevented from seeing anything I wanted to see. Our guide was licensed by the government and was knowledgeable and fun.  I also didn't feel like I was getting an ""official version"" of history or events.  I would love to see restrictions relaxed too if it means more people consider traveling to Iran to experience the history, culture, and people.  But don't let the current situation prevent you from going to Iran.  I am sure you will have a great time how ever you experience it."

iran,3d99l1,al_assad,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:03:43 2015 UTC,"I paid a flat $1300 for 12 days in Iran which included getting a visa authorization code, all hotels (doubles which included breakfast), all transportation and transfers with a private van and driver, a guide, and all admission fees.  I shared the trip with 3 ladies.  Certainly the cost would have been less if we had taken public transportation while in Iran instead of a private van and driver. I went in March right before the busy Nowruz celebration.  Prices might be lower at other times.  I asked about guide fees at one point and was told that guides make between $50 and $100 a day, depending on experience and whether they are also a driver.  Obviously, if there is a group, the cost is shared. There seems to be a really upsurge of interest in traveling to Iran now, you might be able to find some like minded travelers to share the cost of a tour, customized to suit you.  If you have any other questions, please ask.  I had a great time and am happy to share my experiences and thoughts about Iran."

While Netanyahu has been losing his mind spending years trying to beg the US to go to war with Iran or somehow provoke a conflict, Iran has been playing it smart and won major diplomatic victories.  Israel only thinks it can compete regionally with Iran because it has friends in high places, which in the end didn't win it for them.

iran,3d2bqb,LordElrondd,6,Mon Jul 13 07:54:36 2015 UTC,"Rohani hints deal with West is imminent: I've kept my election promise to resolve nuclear issue - Barak Ravid  Iran and the world powers are closer than ever before to signing a historic nuclear deal that would put an end to more than a decade of negotiations. A Western diplomat familiar with the talks told Haaretz that he was optimistic about the possibility of reaching a nuclear agreement and announcing it on Monday.  Iran's President Hassan Rohani hinted Sunday evening at an imminent agreement, and said that he has kept his election promise to resolve the nuclear issue.    U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who have been in Vienna for the past 16 days, held another meeting on Sunday to resolve the final open questions in the agreement.  After the meeting, Zarif told reporters that there is still work to be done, but added that there would be no extension of the negotiations beyond the deadline of Monday at midnight. A senior member of the American negotiating team also said that ""major issues remain to be resolve.""  The final issues to be resolved will be discussed on Monday in meetings attended by the foreign ministers of Iran and the world powers. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi joined the talks in Vienna on Sunday, and British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond will arrive on Monday.  France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who is already in Vienna, told reporters that he hopes ""that we are finally entering the final phase of this marathon negotiation.""  Preparations for a final deal are also taking place in Iran. Tehran police spokesman said on Sunday that authorities have completed arrangements for the celebrations expected across the capital immediately after an agreement with the world powers is announced.  President Rohani's statements on Sunday left almost no room for doubt that a nuclear agreement is a matter of hours. ""Thank God, I have fulfilled my election promise to try and solve the nuclear crisis,"" Rohani said at a Ramadan fast-breaking dinner with a group of Iranian women. ""We are a few steps away from the peak… even if the process stops now, we have performed our duty.""  A hefty document  The nuclear agreement taking shape is a hefty document. The main chapter consists of 20 pages, but includes addendums of some 80 pages. Iran's Fars news agency, which has close ties to the Revolutionary Guard, quoted a source at the Iranian delegation on Sunday afternoon as saying that according to the draft deal, ""all sanctions will be lifted from Iran, but temporary restrictions will remain in place for a period of time.""  According to the official, all of the economic sanction and bank-related sanction will be lifted immediately after the agreement is adopted. The source said that even the embargo imposed by the UN Security Council since 2006 will be lifted, and temporary restrictions on arms trading with Iran would be placed on Iran for a period of time. According to the source, none of the clauses in the agreement deviate from the red lines presented by Iranian Supreme leader Ali Khamanei.  Netanyahu slams 'murderous aggression'  In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the world powers over the imminent nuclear deal. ""Iranian leader [Ali] Khamenei has said that the U.S. should be fought even if an agreement is reached, Rohani is heading a hate march in which U.S. and Israeli flags are being burned and calls for death to America and Israel are being made, and at the same time, concessions are being offered to Iran,"" Netanyahu said at start of the weekly cabinet meeting.  The prime minister added that the deal currently in the works paves a path for Iran to create multiple nuclear bombs and endangers the world at large. ""Iran is not hiding its intentions to continue with its murderous aggression against those who are now negotiating with it,"" Netanyahu said. ""Maybe the powers are willing to give in to a reality underwritten by Iran, which includes unending calls for the destruction of Israel. But we will not accept that.""  During the cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said the upcoming deal reminded him of the agreement signed between the U.S. and North Korea – adding that the world knew how that turned out. Netanyahu showed the minister a video of former U.S. President Bill Clinton making a speech on October 21, 1994, the day the U.S. and  North Korea signed the deal meant to put an end to the communist state's nuclear program.  In the video, Clinton says the agreement will bring North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program, making the world a safer place as nuclear proliferation grinds down. North Korea disavowed the deal in 2003 and resumed its military nuclear program. Several years later it tested a nuclear weapon, and according to some estimates it possesses several nuclear bombs."

iran,3d1969,ashbourne10,3,Mon Jul 13 00:29:33 2015 UTC,"Well, not been to the place (SodaBottleOpenerWala). There is a certain kind of stereotype about Parsis(and Iranis also I think. Note: Iranis =/= Iran Iranians) that they are eccentric and quirky. I think they are playing that card?  :D  There was a critically acclaimed movie about a Parsi family/guy, called Being Cyrus, a few years back.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_Cyrus"
iran,3d1969,ashbourne10,-6,Mon Jul 13 01:46:40 2015 UTC,Something that all Iranians should be ashamed of is that Zoroastrians were made to feel like outsiders in their own homeland and made to feel like natives in the foreign land of India.   Very sad to read about the horrors Zoroastrians had to endure at the hands of Muslims in Iran and then moving to India where people were so tolerant and kind to them and where they really led a happy existence. Much of this is due to Indian culture mixed in with British law that gave religious freedom to such refugees.
iran,3d1969,autowikibot,12,Sun Jul 12 23:53:08 2015 UTC,"Mixed with British laws? Wtf? British gave us some the most regressive and repressive laws, some of which are still today. The so-called ""anti-homosexuality"" law in India is attributed to the ""great"" Brits. Still, till date there have been zero cases registered.  The majority of Iranians (the Parsis) came to India more than thousand years ago. Iranis came in the Qajar era.  Crediting the tolerance of India, even remotely, to the Brits is an insult."

These cafes were all are set up by Iranis, i.e. Zoroastrians that left Qajar Iran to British India.   I didn't credit tolerance in India to the Brits solely, I said in my original post that the Indian culture of tolerance mixed with British law meant India was an attractive destination for Zoroastrians fleeing Iran. Their laws were attractive to many other religious minorities in the Middle East as many Armenians and Iraqi Jews also moved to India under the British too.   One of the reasons the Kalash of what's now Pakistan still follow their ancestral religion unlike their Nuristani cousins that were forcibly converted to Islam is because their territory came under British rule."

It states the date of arrival at 936 CE. It was constructed in the year 1920 to perpetuate meomory of the arrival of the Zoroastrians in India. There is a Parsi dharamshala in the complex. The local Parsis of Sanjan celebrate the arrival of the community by celebrating Sanjan Day in November. The 'Stambh' is made of Vadodara granite. Its height, including the leaping flames of fire is 50 feet. The column rests on a square platform. There are 23 decorative rosettes.

iran,3cyysq,koodak,3,Sun Jul 12 01:34:15 2015 UTC,I remember having kalleh pacheh during the 1994 world cup qualifiers at 4 am with 50 Iranian sibil kolofts at Iranian and Mexican restaurants when people didn't have a satellite dish.  We paid $20 for kalleh and the right to watch the game.  Good old days.

iran,3cx7zd,wbeeman,23,Sat Jul 11 16:05:47 2015 UTC,"Both men and women refuse food, not because of its effect on their waistlines but because accepting it on the first offer would be rude.   There have been no articles or studies on the matter that go further to explain why ta'rof is a part of Iranian culture and how it earned its place. The explanation lies in Iran's cultural status as being neither fully Eastern nor fully Western.   While Western philosophy emphasizes individualism and Eastern philosophy embraces collectivism, Iranian culture seems to be a mix of both. While Iranians are generally individualistic people (as evidenced by their constant desire for independence and their performance in individual sports like wrestling and weightlifting compared to team sports), they also place emphasis on collectivist elements such as family cohesion and conformity. The resulting effect is individualism based on altruism and loyalty; where the individual is meant to be sacrificed for a greater goal. Almost all Iranians have an ingrained sense of responsibility to devote themselves to something else, and it is very difficult to find an Iranian who is truly living for his or her self.  This philosophy is as old as Iran, and in the beginning, ta'rof was the product in day-to-day interactions. For example, the honor of sacrificing that last slice of pizza so a guest or a friend may eat it instead, would be more fulfilling and provide more spiritual sustenance than eating that slice yourself.   This type of true ta'rof -- a sacrifice of the individual's desires to fulfill a higher purpose -- is also seen in the Shahnameh where Iraj offers his entire kingdom to his jealous brothers, Tur and Salm.   But as time went on, and ta'rof became more and more widespread and poorly practiced, it lost its true value and became associated with dishonesty and pretension. In its current mainstream form, ta'rof is the most widely disliked cultural trait."
iran,3cx7zd,rezsahin,3,Sat Jul 11 17:36:42 2015 UTC,"great comment rez, thank you.   You've put into words feelings I've been having for a while that I maybe had troubling expressing clearly as an Iranian living in a Western society."
iran,3cx7zd,_flac,3,Sat Jul 11 18:20:15 2015 UTC,"One thing I dislike about Iranian culture is the extent of formalities which I believe contributes to Iranians often being perceived as 'fake' or insincere. I hate taarof and think it's an absolutely pointless piece of etiquette. It's not even charming, so why do people do it?"
iran,3cx7zd,ashbourne10,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:03:14 2015 UTC,"A few years ago, I went out to eat with this guy. He got two big steak dinners and I got some little $6 sandwich. Anyway, we got the bill and I put down a $10 bill. We owed about $60. He kept taarofing and insisting I take the money back, that he will cover it, that mine was practically nothing. Eventually, I took the money back and said thanks. A couple minutes later: ""Wh-where is that $10 bill?"" I reply, ""it's in my wallet."" His eyes grew wide. ""No, no, bring it out, bring it out. I was just taarofing; daneshjooam!"" I was so vicariously embarrassed for him.   Moral of the story: If you taarof insincerely, you have to remember: taarof amad o nayamad dare. There is no 100% chance the other party will decline, so you might want to think twice before taarofing your new Ferrari...or, if you're that cheap, before taarofing $10. lol  All of that said, I would rather have someone taarof than be the opposite extreme of the spectrum. I had an American boyfriend who would get out a tub of ice cream, make himself an elaborate sundae in front of me, slowly eat it and describe how delicious it is - all without offering me a bite or finding it the least bit awkward."
iran,3cx7zd,felinebeeline,0,Tue Jul 14 04:37:39 2015 UTC,"somehow i think this definition of ta'arof comes from Isfahan.  in south ta'arof means ""to offer"".  تعارف اومد نیومد داره."

The Taliban came to power during America's continuation of Operation Cyclone in the 1990s after the Soviet invasion had come to an end. Only this time, Operation Cyclone was refitted to counter Iran's allies in Afghanistan, the Northern Alliance, who were actively fighting against the Taliban. The same Taliban whose hosting of Osama Bin Laden was used as a pretext for the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Now, NATO is to be celebrated for picking up after its own mess?"

Just for drama points western news articles claim it's the IRGC doing it, but really it's the corrupt as shit border guards. This is why conscription should be either abolished or seriously revamped. Conscription was necessary for the days of the Iran-Iraq war, what good is it now? It's just making it harder for the state to finance a more potent and smaller military. I'm speaking from first hand experience: certain sectors of the Iranian armed forces are severely under-funded (and yes the salaries are shit) this leads to high corruption and the smuggling in of alcohol.

Yes she's revealing her hair...which most women on earth do, even Muslim women in cultures like the Punjab, Central Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa reveal their hair.. Not sure how that's immodest.   I think we shouldn't judge women's character based on their clothing or use of makeup. I've seen PLENTY of Muslim women dressed in hijabs that behave in a disgusting and arrogant manner. The fact none of their skin is showing doesn't take away from the fact they're often very bitchy or become rude to people in service professions, or that they are often bullies at school. Wearing a hijab doesn't make you a better person, simple as that. I remember last month I was in a cafe and a teenage girl (maybe 17/18) wearing a hijab was asked a very simple question by the waitress (like if she wanted ice with her drink or something like that) and she rolled her eyes at her and stared at her for about 5 seconds before saying yes. When the waitress left she turned to her hijabi friend and started joking about how stupid the question was. I thought that was incredibly classless behaviour and demonstrates her arrogance.   The sweetest girls I've met are often Scandinavian, Finnish or Irish. They often wear makeup and wear clothing that reveals their legs or even more than that, but they are so kind, rarely have attitude problems or big egos, and don't engage in bitchy or conniving behaviour that South Asian and Middle Eastern girls typically engage in, etc."
iran,3cy6jc,IAma_lama_Ama_,2,Tue Jul 14 22:24:06 2015 UTC,"Look dear, I know many Muslim women out there have really crappy attitudes and it makes me want to do a entire social engineering programme on them to sort them out, but the thing is, I don't think dressing modestly = bad attitudes and manners. In fact, the concept of modesty goes far beyond clothing and this includes the inner disposition and outer mannerisms, which admittedly, many Muslim women do lack.   Having said that, I don't think that's an excuse to unveil, rather their modest clothing should complement their attitudes and manners, how Islam intended. For the record, I don't believe wearing skinny jeans and having an eleborate hijab equals modesty.   You mentioned Irish and Scandanavian women. Well the thing is, I went to Germany about a month back and the people I came across were very noticebly aloof, outwardly. I discussed this with another foreigner who was there at the place I was staying at and guess what he told me, go the Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland and the people there are even more cold. So my conclusion is, it's got less to do with clothing, and more to do with culture where you're down to your own devices of 'do whatever you want as long as you hurt no one'. Something fundementally opposite to Eastern culture."
iran,3cy6jc,derintellectual,0,Tue Jul 14 23:22:53 2015 UTC,"was that suppose to be an insult?  Anyway, I have met people who've dressed like that and in almost all cases, I was right. They didn't have an interesting or intriguing personality.   Louie CK did a segment on this.. In almost all cases, people who dress like that, have the personality that Louie here suggests. It's not judging, its the truth.  I would like to be with someone who is beautiful AND intellectual. Someone I can hold a conversation with.   You just like to accuse people of things when they don't agree with you, and in this case its pretty much everyone. First you call people religious (as if its some sort of a negative characteristic) and then when that doesn't work out, you accuse me of ""having a small brain"". lol  Buddy, I'm sorry.

He's talking about hot girls in bars. We're not discussing hot girls in bars.   My question wasn't meant to be an insult. I'm asking because the other judgemental person lives in Mashhad (at least allegedly). I've been to Mashhad and 9 out of 10 women there wears a black chador, which that person also thinks is wonderful and better than the way women dress in Europe and Tehran. If you live in that environment it is reasonable to point out you're ignorant when you make misogynistic comments about this woman for her clothing that isn't even outrageous.    I would like to be with someone who is beautiful AND intellectual. Someone I can hold a conversation with.   I don't know what this even means. Ugly women often dress like that, and so do intellectual women. Oxbridge is full of girls that dress like the girl in the photo and I also have many friends that went to American universities like the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia, so I know as a fact that many of the girls attending there also have a fashion sense that you would deem to be 'shit' and suggestive of them lacking personality or intellect."

I for one, and many other people (as evident by this thread) don't like the way she's dressed, purely on non-religious reasons, and that is because she is screaming for attention by dressing like that, and lots of us don't like that personality.   You're making it sound very black and white. We're either religious and we do not tolerate this, or we're not religious, in which case (apparently) we have to like this dress code. That's simply not true.  Inb4 you're judging. No we're not. As so it happens, you can tell a lot about someone's personality by the way they dress.

Some of the cultural sights are the pink mosque, ruins of persepolis, Rudkhan castle, and the Eram Garden  If you are in Iran, you should try the local cuisine, see the sights, and take parts in the festivities of the time.  As a foreigner, you will get a lot of invitations to come over for dinner.  Couch surfing is also well developed.  As for what not to do, ideally use common sense.  Don't go into a street corner and start yelling the the government/islam is bad.  In private, feel free to say what you're comfortable saying with the people you're with, but in public use your brain.  Dress appropriately(This applies to men as well).

Ferdosi's Shahname claims that it was one of our kings that thought the humanity to weave cloths; of course that's a legend and not very credible. We were a country long before the Greek became united to form their own; i've read it in a history book how they were used as mercenaries for other nations (including Persia). There was no clear form slavery and workers were paid for their work. Persepolis was one such grand structure to be built by well paid (and even insured if I remember correctly) workers and architects; it was later burned down by alexander, so you can judge who the uncivilized one was.  I don't really know about any ancient work of art that displays romans and greek but it stands to reason that such works of art exists. I think the stories about how Persia captured Rome's emperor Valerian are more likely to exist since it was an achievement for the king and also because there are more traces of it in modern literature that tell us of his fate after he was taken prisoner.  As for your second question, any president is better than Ahmadinejad, and so far I've been happy with how Rouhani operates."

I visited Iran with my mother, my sister and a female friend of mine.  Basically, all I'd say is be careful to dress conservatively.  We had a bit of a close situation when some ""morality police"" were looking very closely at my friend's bum.  They didn't say anything, but after that we got some clothes locally to be sure that they were dressed appropriately.  You don't need to wear a chador, but you should probably have something like a manteau."

The people are very hospitable and kind, and they are curious about foreigners. However, that doesn't mean you are exempt from scams and the like!  I recommend the Caspian coastline, Shiraz, (where my family is from) Isfahan, and of course, Tehran. Maybe you could go to Abadan or Mashhad if time permits? You can see ancient Persian architecture in Persepolis, and arts in Tehran. Astonishingly well."

If you like nature there are plenty of incredible forests and greenery up to the north. Combine those greeneries with seas and the mountains and you can fine incredible places. I went to a place called "" Mazichal"" last autumn and it was stunning.  If you prefer historical sight seeing then there are a couple of cities like Isfahan and shiraz that can keep you busy for a couple of weeks.   I recently found a grand canyon called ""Hayegher"" in ""Firoozabad"" which I really want to go and see :P.

I have great interest in the middle east as a whole, but Iran has always captured my attention. I even plan to study in Tehran someday if I have the possibility :)  I'd like to ask the following:   How accurate is the graphic novel Persepolis depiction of the revolution of '79? While I like Persepolis, sometimes it seems to condemn the whole revolution as a backward and obscure movement. Does the media depiction of Iran in international news annoy Iranians? All we hear about is mostly about women being stoned to death because they were raped, how Iran wants to develop nuclear weapons, the financing of Shia militias in Syria and Iraq and how now Iran prohibited certain haircuts because they are too western. I am very doubtful and always question things as portrayed by the media, but I'd like to hear an Iraninan opinion."
iran,3csycs,LordElrondd,3,Fri Jul 10 16:51:42 2015 UTC,Hey welcome:)  I watched Persepolis a long time ago and can't clearly remember the details so let me skip to your second question.  It doesn't bother me personally. Politics and Media are the same every where in the world and they only get to fool the ignorant. Not saying everything they say is untrue but they tend to highlight the ugly parts.   But most of my friends and families are bothered by the image they show of Iran. They want to show Iran as the beautiful country it is. I think thats one of the reason they try too hard to be friendly with foreigners. They are trying to compensate for the image media created.

The revolution was originally headed towards the left political spectrum, but as no common leader was found to guide the shift, the conservatives took it over.  I felt like some change had to be done, but I wish that the revolution would have stuck with its roots.  On culture,  I would say the importance of literature & Poetry.

For muslims, they can just buy it off someone/befriend a non-muslim.  Not sure what the punishment is, but it can't be that bad as the government has opened dozens of rehab clinics in the capitol in this year alone.  Religious practice negligence:  As long as you keep it to yourself, the government doesn't care.  If you walk into a mosque during a sermon and start yelling that religion is a lie or something, then you may get into trouble.    Ideally, anything can go if you keep it under the radar."

iran,3csycs,johnnybigoode,2,Sat Jul 11 05:30:19 2015 UTC,"Music is banned because of Islamic laws.  Listening to anything like folk or allowed bands in Iran is ok. If you are listening to western songs or Iranian songs with a western type and there is police around or a female lead singer, you are in big trouble. Teens in Iran risk it all. It's all part of  the usual YOLO. There are no concerts for the banned types of music. Musicians and bands often get arrested because someone snitched on them for money or by insiders. Here's an example of an allowed band in Iran, Aryan, which sang with Chris De Burgh and planned to do an album together which ended up being disallowed by the government: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtMTzPI84JQ  I like retro songs from the 1980's and Iranian songs did not fulfill my taste. I am an expat and I have lived away from Iran for a while so there's also that. In general, there is a type of music that not a lot of people know about yet and it's called New retro wave; 1980's music composed by musicians today: https://soundcloud.com/aspaceloveadventure/power-rush"

I noticed that there's some playing guitar.  I liked the Arian, I like pop music. What about rock, or rap, and art music, classical? What are the differences between before and after the revolution?  Man, my mind is blowing with this chat!  Edit: And I loved the revisited 80's music! Smooth, very nice."
iran,3csycs,m2084,2,Sun Jul 12 02:28:42 2015 UTC,"Women in general are often unsung heroes iran, in anyway. Artistic ways are similar but the amount of exposure to women are limited unless they really have talent. There are women that have art galleries in NYC and various places in iran. Things considered illegal are electric guitars and politicized lyrics.   We have all types of genres. Its the matter of whether there is popularity.  Before the revolt. People were very conservative about music. One of the pioneers of western-style music in iran was by kourosh yaghmaei in 1976, which his son, kaveh, is a rock musician that recently went to Canada. It eventually became mainstream to do so by the mid 1990's."

iran,3csuet,AlCapone564,16,Fri Jul 10 14:23:27 2015 UTC,"In general, how do the Iranian people feel towards the American people?   The feelings are largely positive. Lots of Iranians love America. As in the case of many foreigners, this love is often misguided and ill-founded. America is like a fantasy thing to most people in the world.   Are the Iranian people hostile to the American people or is this more a conflict of government interests?   Basically government conflict. Both governments are looking out for national interests, so to some extent American and Iranian people really do have competing interests, but the governments take the hostility to an unnecessary level.   Would the people of Iran be happy if there was a Israeli and Palestinian peace?   I believe if the peace were fair, it would satisfy most Iranians. A lot of Iranians don't even care that much about Palestine, although they know that Israel poses a danger to Iran. The Iranian government probably would not be happy if Israel and Palestine became friends because it erodes their political position.   Would they be supportive of an integration of cultures or are the people of Iran completely against the existence of Israel completely?   If Israel were a nice and peaceful country, I doubt Iranian people would have any issue with it.   How much control does the Iranian government have over it's citizens?   Very little.   With the recent anti-US/Saudi/Israel demonstrations I have read that government employees were required to attend. Is this true?   Sounds plausible. This kind of thing is normal in countries over here. For example, in Tajikistan students are routinely forced to take part in public events by threatening their grades. I'm sure workers are also forced by their employers to take part in social things."

I have been a pupil, a student, a cadet in the.military (conscription), and employed, and nor I nor anyone I know was ever asked or forced to take part in demonstrations or elections. I have never even been asked whether I have taken part or not afterwards. To the contrary, I recall that some demonstrations/events happened in the morning (e.g. Student's day and friday prayer) and since taking part in them meant you would have to be given a day off of school/military, everyone was so keen to go, yet the numbers they would take was very little, 6 out of our 30 pupil class, and 7 from.our 69 soldiers group.  Sure it happens some places, but its not widespread.   Edit: im talking about Iran"

It's honestly pathetic at times.

Thanks again."
iran,3csuet,LordElrondd,5,Fri Jul 10 15:19:34 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit late to the party, but I wanted to answer your questions in short.  I can say with confidence that the majority of people in Iran like Americans. You just have to listen to the tales of Americans who've traveled to Iran. As a recent and high-profile case, check out Anthony Bourdain's trip. I myself have many American friends, some of which I consider my best friends.   Iran, just like every other nation would love peace in every country, be it Israel, Palestine or any other country. We generally disprove of Israeli government actions, however.  I suggest if you're interested enough to travel to Iran yourself and see how you're treated by everyday people on the streets. I can guarantee you'll be surprised."

The IRI leaders wouldn't like to accept Israel if this turn of events came about because opposition to Israel is part of how they maintain their hard-line. It's important for them for Iran to be under siege for their ideology to be effective. However, they may be forced to accept Israel if the Palestinians themselves do."

And Iranians have never hated Americans, regardless of their opinion about the US govt, which is rather remarkable considering the history. Even at the height of the 1979 revplution, no American was ever hurt. In fact the last time an Iranian killed any American for political reasons was in the early 1970s, when a certain terrorist group assassinated US military advisors, and that group is the MEK which was recently delis Ted by the US as a terrorist group.

The debt in Iran is future checks.  If I buy your house I would give you a check with today's date for 50% of the purchase price and let's say a check for 0.25 of the purchase price with a check dated 3 months from now and a check for the remaining balance for a check dated 6 months from now.  Interest is tacked on to each check with the future date.  If you went to the bank and my check didn't pass you could have me arrested after warnings. Banks have computers and so do schools and hospitals. Don't know about the court as I luckily have never set foot in one."

Like other people have said, it's inside a building and there's a door in the front. It's always closed and residents buzz in everyone who doesn't have a key.    The Judge during the trial, everybody speaks for himself, there are no lawyers and the judge can give almost any order to everyone, restraining people on his own will. Can a judge really do that in Iran?    Yeah... The legal system in Iran is a big casserole of nonsense.     The creditors: Hodjat's creditor's have him jailed for his debts for a couple of days. Can somebody be jailed for his debts, by his creditors, in Iran?    Yes. You know, the legal system...    Computers: no computers in the bank Nader works in, no computers in Termeh's school, no computers in the judge's office or in the hospital. Is that ordinary?    There are computers in banks but we cant see them because they're under the counters. Public schools usually don't have computers for students to use.

You can tell when they show the crazies from an Ashura rally at 15:00 when the narrator is talking about ""The Iranians"". Because of the ignorance of Westerners about Iran, showing these type of images of Iran when discussing an ""alleged Iranian hostage taking plot"" just adds on to the demonization of Iran and Iranians so many bigots and warmongers are funding and working for.

iran,3cpjny,MardyBear,-17,Thu Jul 9 19:14:22 2015 UTC,"But can Iran ever truly be trusted, not to turn their nuclear power (ie: energy generation) program, into a nuclear WEAPONS program? There are tribes (yes, tribes, as in 'tribal elders' and such) in Iran that have been at war with one another, not to mention some that have been at war with neighboring tribes in Iraq, for 100's and 100's of years. Do we really want to give a country with, basically, an ongoing civil war, the ability to create nuclear weapons? What's to stop one of those tribes from breaking into a weapons facility, stealing a neaclear weapon, and lobbing it over the proverbial fence at their neighbor, in an attempt to end a tribal feud that they most likely don't even know the reasons behind why it was started in the first place?  Stealing a conventional bomb (non-nuclear) and throwing it at your enemy is VASTLY different than tossing a nuclear bomb their way.  I'm all for easing sanctions on Iran, truthfully, but they're really going to have to prove they can secure their shit, before my opinion will change on lifting the sanctions completely.   That said, how effective ARE the sanctions we've been imposing on them for the last 30'ish years? Apparently, not very, as they seem to have a thriving economy, albeit a bit 2nd-world. They're techonologically advanced. They can feed their people. They trade with other nations. They have a security force. IMO, they fulfill all of the major requirements for a semi-1st-world nation.   Keep in mind, this is all from things I've read online. Never been there, nor met anyone from there, so I don't have 1st-hand knowledge. I just know what I read, process it, and formulate a misguided opinion!

No one gives a damn what these Iranians think, because frankly they are sociopaths who don't care about other people, are majorly ignorant about the political reality of Iran and are delusional enough to prefer revolution to reform despite what history has taught us. Such people should just go and die, because the world is better off without them."
iran,3cldt4,hotlineforhelp,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:06:39 2015 UTC,"That's one side of it. Obviously, there can always be people with nefarious desires for both keeping the sanctions in place and lifting them. However, opposing a deal regarding Iran's nuclear deal is not inherently nefarious in and of itself as a position of principle.   Consider the fact that Iran's nuclear program has been completely legal and Iran is practicing its legitimate right of having nuclear power. Not only has the international community, unjustly and illegally, placed sanctions on Iran, but they have also refused to help Iran establish this nuclear program as they were obligated to do so under the NPT.  Why then, should Iran go to the negotiating table and argue over its sovereign rights just to get a pittance? Why should Iran even be negotiating over its basic rights? If anything, Iran should leave the NPT which the international community has failed to follow and pursue its own, unrestricted nuclear program even if it means more sanctions.   This is the position that many conservatives have.   Still another side, is a position espoused by former president Banisadr. This argument is similar to the first, but includes the fact that for years, the Iranian reformists have been trying to engage in dialogue with their own government, but have been continuously silenced and marginalized. The government has been so unyielding to the demands of its own people, the reformists, but is now making concessions to foreigners.   So in all, it's not just a simple matter of ""sociopaths who don't care about other people, are majorly ignorant about the political reality of Iran and are delusional enough to prefer revolution to reform;"" in some cases, it's quite the opposite."

There are those who also think that opening Iran up to the USA will even transition it to a democracy. As if Iran was guiding itself towards Democracy before 2006, before Bush, before the first UN sanctions. That's horseshit. Iran was never paradise and it's been a shit hole of executions and oppression since 1979 and none of it is the blame of the USA or the boogey-man Israel. If you truly cared about the Iranian people, you'd support a scenario where the Islamic Republic collapses or is overthrown. Removing these sanctions only further secures this regime for another 20-30 years.

iran,3cldt4,hotlineforhelp,9,Wed Jul 8 21:38:22 2015 UTC,"I can understand that, but what it really comes down to is that if the Islamic Republic fails, lots of Iranians are going to die or be thrown into poverty. Such a terrible crisis isn't worth it, in my opinion.  If you compare to Saddam's Iraq, the sanctions and eventual invasion created a situation where literally millions of people died and Iraq went from being reasonably prosperous to the most ruined country in the region. (Well, until Syria happened.) Even Syria's misfortune is due to the work of those supposedly patriotic Syrians who just wanted the government to fail. US just wanted to take out Saddam and bring democracy (yay).  So if you want Iran to become another one of these countries then be my guest and try to take down the Islamic Republic. What makes it even less worth it, however, is that unlike Bashar and Saddam, the IRI is not a form of minority rule. The IRI is light-years ahead of those regimes in terms of providing democracy and representing its population. It doesn't get flying colors, that's for sure, but I'll take the IRI over practically any government outside the western world.  At present I don't think there can be made a true distinction between the IRI failing and Iran itself completely failing. Maybe one day the IRI will eventually give way like the USSR did 25 years ago, but even that didn't turn out so great for Russia, did it? Russia is still ruled by corrupt, oligarchic bastards and has only ""democracy"" for show."
iran,3cldt4,NaiveGoat,0,Wed Jul 8 22:36:25 2015 UTC,"True. I agree with everything you said, except the part about IRI being better than all non-Western countries. I'd much rather live in Brazil or Argentina or any Latin country (as a system of government).  I agree with the comments about Russia and Syria and Iraq. I'm not saying war is the way to go. Iranian won't fight the USA if the USA drops a few bombs on Natanz or other nuke sites.   Maybe a few of these Basiji motherfuckers might, and hell, let them all die. At the core thought, is my sincere belief that this regime CANNOT be reformed, so all these speculative long-distance projections about what Iran might look like in 20 years is all fantasy to me."

They can't pay their subsidies, and they fear public unrest and inflation. I'm not saying it might lead to regime change but it'll obviously cause public unrest towards the regime. The regime doesn't give a shit. They will get their $100 billion once their deal is finalized and continue to fund Hezbollah, Hamas, etc. My point is that the regime was not giving a shit about the Iranian people BEFORE the sanctions and it doesn't give a fuck about them now; what they DO care about is taking over Syria and Iraq and maintaining their power over their own citizens. Without hard cash flowing it, they can't do that and they're shit scared. (BTW I'm Iranian if that matters to you)."

iran,3cldt4,marmulak,7,Thu Jul 9 07:39:51 2015 UTC,"No but obviously the sanctions are hitting the regime HARD.   It's a folly to think of the Iranian polity as a homogenous monolith, which you call 'the regime'.  You can't apply the same generalisations to the Supreme Leader, as you do to the Revolutionary Guards, the Basij, the Majlis, the moderates and the Green Movement. The most hardline elements of the regime, i.e. the IRGC, have benefited immensely from sanctions. The sanctions, through choking up direct routes of trade and creating a need for middlemen and economic intermediaries, have gone a long way to enrich the revolutionary guards more than ever. It is precisely because of the sanctions that the IRGC have emerged  in recent  years as a force to be reckoned with, even for the supreme leader himself. There has been a direct correlation between Iran's economic isolation and the increasing monopoly of the IRGC over diverse areas of the Iranian economy. Your reasoning doesn't match up with the reality of the recent years.    My point is that the regime was not giving a shit about the Iranian people BEFORE the sanctions and it doesn't give a fuck about them now;   Had Ahamadinejad never been elected, and had Khatami's legacy been sustained and strengthened, Iran would be in a completely different place from where it is today. Ahmadinejad's election was an enormous political setback in every sense;  a setback that was facilitated by the Bush administration's unrealistic foreign policy, which consistently rejected Khatami's overtures in favour of an intransigent regime-change policy, thereby discrediting the reformist camp by making Khatami appear weak and ineffective. In a similar fashion, if a nuclear deal is concluded and comes to fruition, this will count as an historical success for the reformist and moderate causes in Iranian politics. Hard line elements, such as the IRGC and the Majlis, will suffer a long-term and possibly fatal blow from which they will never politically recover. Iran will then be set on a long-term path of reform, which will take us to a better place through persistent and incremental improvements."
iran,3cldt4,hotlineforhelp,5,Wed Jul 8 23:35:32 2015 UTC,"They are obviously shitting themselves   They probably just did a cost-benefit analysis and decided negotiation was to their benefit. I think what brings both sides to the table is the belief that a diplomatic solution will benefit everyone. The US obviously sees no end in sight to the sanctions, otherwise they could just press on. Iran has basically shown that they can shoulder the sanctions indefinitely, making it an untenable policy for the US."

But that aside, how long are you willing to wait before the IR is overthrown, and how can you have any degree of certainty as to what it will be replaced with? If you really underestimate the strength and stability of IR so much so that you think it might realistically be removed in the near future, what then do you make of the very real possibility that in the chaos that ensues Iran will fall prey to the flood of terrorist groups coming in from neighbouring countries as well as to opportunistic separatism?"

iran,3ckd3x,Sacha117,-1,Wed Jul 8 23:00:29 2015 UTC,I heard the black outs are basically a propaganda campaign for the population to support nuclear energy
iran,3ckd3x,Nmathmaster123,4,Wed Jul 8 21:27:01 2015 UTC,"They idolize the relationship they once had with America.  I could not have you see and feel my experience, but believe they Love Americans.

iran,3ckd3x,Sacha117,-5,Thu Jul 9 08:57:59 2015 UTC,Iran has one of the worlds largest oil reserves and possibly the worlds largest gas reserves. It hasn't got a shortage of fuel to make electricity. The fact that black outs occur in a country with such abundant fuel at hand should make you question its ability to generate nuclear energy safely. I mean if we can't even run coal/gas stations what hope have we got for nuclear?
iran,3ckd3x,CYAXARES_II,3,Wed Jul 8 20:09:01 2015 UTC,"well, I've lived almost my entire life in Iran, this has happened a grand total of 5 times to me in Mashhad (it happend a lot in Valiabad lol). The building code here sucks, but electric shortages aren't a common occurrence. I'm in Turkey right now so I don't know whats going on back home, but this isn't something common."
iran,3ckd3x,Sacha117,3,Thu Jul 9 02:17:59 2015 UTC,Burning oil or even gas for energy creates pollution and is a waste of money when it can be exported for more money instead. Nuclear energy is multiple times cleaner.  It was the USA during the time of the Shah who recommended nuclear energy for Iran as oil is a limited resource which a country can't rely on strategically for its energy needs.  Not to mention Iran's oil and gas industry are sanctioned by the West which prevents Iran from not only exporting oil and gas but also from importing the necessary supplies to increase production.
iran,3ckd3x,CYAXARES_II,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:34:42 2015 UTC,"Sure but if we can't even get coal right what hope have we got for nuclear? First show you can power a country with gas and coal then go onto nuclear. Blackouts happen too often and bring doubt to the ability of Iran to make nuclear energy safely.  And nuclear energy was recommended so that American companies could sell it to Iran. I don't think the main reason it was recommended by an American president was for the benefit of Iran, even if he believed it."
iran,3ckd3x,Sacha117,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:17:54 2015 UTC,"What do you mean we can't get coal right? The country doesn't have an energy problem like you're claiming it does. It did 10 or 20 years ago, but nowadays the power outs are from the poor infrastructure more than from the lack of electricity.   Did you notice how the Milad Tower and the neighboring buildings still had power in this video?  The point of the NPT is so to not only prevent nuclear proliferation but for countries to share peaceful nuclear technology as an incentive for non-proliferation. In Iran's case, not only is it not developing nuclear weapons but its nuclear program is sanctioned by Western countries and their allies, effectively making Iran's nuclear energy program less safe. Meanwhile it is being threatened of being bombed by Israel and/or USA, potentially causing thousands of deaths from nuclear fallout."
iran,3ckd3x,CYAXARES_II,0,Thu Jul 9 18:47:43 2015 UTC,"What I mean is every time I go to Iran I get a blackout and this was in central Tehran. That doesn't give me much confidence that Iran is ready for nuclear in a country that has lots of earth quakes. Let's see whether Iran can go a full 5 years without a single black out then maybe I'll trust that we are ready to make nuclear energy, but of course why would we want nuclear energy when we could have solar and wind until nuclear fusion comes along?  Did you know that the cost of Chernobyl is approximately 3 trillion dollars and counting? One of the main reasons the USSR fell apart was that cost. 500,000 engineers had to be totally dedicated to its clean up and it's still going on TODAY. Yeah, let's not half arse nuclear energy Iranian style thanks."

iran,3ckap5,ashbourne10,18,Thu Jul 9 13:14:06 2015 UTC,"Iran isn't a tribal society or a society divided along ethnic lines, so your belief that Azeris look up to Khamenei as their leadership is false. There isn't a culture of voting or supporting politicians based on their ethnicity, there isn't a culture of insisting to marry within your ethnic group or any other sorts of ethnic-based divisive behaviour you see in many other countries like Iraq, Turkey, India, USA, etc. When Azeris move to cities outside their region (and they frequently do) they never form little ethnic hubs, neighbourhoods or ghettos where they all cluster together. Because they don't view themselves as foreign there isn't a strong desire to keep their language alive when migrating outside of their linguistic or ethnic regions, which means that it's rare to find Tehran-born Azeris that can speak the Azeri language, and because their Iranian identity trumps their Azeri identity there isn't any pressure or culture of endogamy where they marry among each other. Azeris outside of their region in Iran marry whoever they like without taking their ethnicity into account and I'd say marrying non-Azeris is the norm. This happens in Tehran despite them making up something like 30% of Tehran's population.  There is little identification between Azeris on both sides of the border due to centuries of separation. In my controversial opinion, the two people have adopted two different ethnic or national identities despite having a nationality using the same word. I think there's more to sharing an ethnicity and national identity than merely sharing a language and this is why I believe the Azeris of both countries are distinct and separate people. They don't even have the same priorities or national aspirations. One example of this is that Azeris in Iran like Armenians and Armenia yet the Azeris of the actual country Azerbaijan hate Armenians and Armenia to the same degree that Palestinians hate Israel. There is no interest in knowing what happened in that conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan among Iranian-Azeris, and there is a great deal of ignorance with a majority perhaps not even knowing there was a war between them. Iranian-Azeris like to go on vacations to Armenia, and when they enter the country it doesn't even cross their mind that Armenia was engaged in a brutal war with Azerbaijan.   The Azeri separatist movement in Iran is basically non-existent. Its most vocal supporters are people from the Republic of Azerbaijan and to a lesser extent Turkey who frequently pretend to be Iranian-Azeris on the internet and troll the internet with YouTube videos and Facebook pages. It's basically a YouTube and Facebook movement made up of fake profiles that take on fake nationalities and pretend to be born in countries or cities they've never even been to.   In real terms, there is no chance of Azeris separating from Iran because there's no desire and because they also simply don't identify with the nation-state of Azerbaijan. No amount of efforts from Baku promoting Azeri nationalism is going to change that because there's a disconnect between the two peoples. My opinion that they don't identify with the nation-state of Azerbaijan isn't one that Azerbaijani nationals are going to like, but it's the harsh truth. Iranian-Azeris have had a long time to understand the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, yet after 20 years the average Iranian-Azeri hasn't got a clue about the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, doesn't care to know, and most continue to have positive opinions of Armenians and often take vacations there due to their liberal laws. There are enough Azeris in Iran and in the Iranian government to influence Iranian foreign policy yet Iran still sides with Armenia without an ounce of controversy or opposition among the general population, and furthermore there have been no Iranian-Azeris that have decided to go to Azerbaijan to fight in its wars. There have been countless Armenians from Iran, Lebanon and Argentina that have decided to take up arms and join the Armenian army to fight in its wars against Azerbaijan, yet despite a larger Iranian-Azeri population there have been no reports or stories of Iranian-Azeris joining the Azerbaijani army over a feeling of loyalty or duty to Azerbaijan or to 'protect' it from Armenia.   People from one ethnic group taking up arms to fight a war for a state they don't come from but identify with culturally or nationally is common, yet it's lacking among Iranian-Azeris in regards to Azerbaijan. It's very common for Jews in so many countries (USA, UK, Mexico, Russia and even Iran) to volunteer to join the Israeli army and participate in its wars. Kurds from Iran, Turkey, Germany and Belgium frequently join various Kurdish militaries fighting right now (Peshmerga, PKK, etc). Armenians from Iran, Lebanon, Syria, USA, Argentina and other countries joined the Armenian military in huge numbers in its war with Azerbaijan. Arabs and Muslims from many countries have joined ISIS to participate in its wars. There could be as much as 15 million Azeris in Iran, but we don't ever hear of them joining the Azerbaijani military, never hear of them concerned over its problems or its territorial disputes with Armenia. And I cannot find even one example of an Iranian-Azeri joining the Azerbaijani military to fight in its various wars with Azerbaijan. Iran's roughly 100,000 Armenians had countless numbers of men going off to join Armenia's military when it had its war with Azerbaijan though - and this to me demonstrates that Iranian-Armenians feel an affinity towards Armenia and see themselves as sharing a national identity with them (despite also feeling an affinity to Iran). Funny that 100,000 Armenians in Iran produce more volunteers for Armenia's army than the 15 million Iranian-Azeris for Azerbaijan.   If that isn't evidence of no identification with the nation-state of Azerbaijan among Iranian-Azeris then I don't know what is."

iran,3ckap5,marmulak,8,Thu Jul 9 12:46:23 2015 UTC,"Some people commented that there is a huge difference between the country Azerbaijan and the Azeris living in Iran. I'd say this is very accurate considering the history of these territories. Azerbaijan was an original part of Iran before it was taken from Iran by the Russian Empire. I think this was around 200 years ago or thereabouts. Azerbaijan later became a Soviet Socialist Republic, and so not only do you have centuries of Russian rule, but also communist historical revision and the indoctrination of generations of people in Azerbaijan. There's basically no way that they can be considered the same people as native Iranians.  Also Azeris in Iran are on the opposite side of a cultural and political divide between the Safavids and the Ottomans. ""Turkish"" identity has a lot to do with the Ottoman empire, Sunni identity, and Anatolia. Iranian Azeris share in none of this stuff and may even be in stark opposition.  As an analogy, it's like asking if Poles would be interested in Pan-Slavism."

Iranian Azeris are more Iranian than they are Turkic and are largely more removed from the whole Turkish illusion going on that Azeris in the RoA face.   The fact of the matter is, ethnic groups living in Iran are much more likely to retain their Iranic roots than those outside. So as long as Turkic influence is cut down (and it helps that  Iran's state tv broadcasts in Azeri I don't think it will be that big of a problem. There are also more Azeris living here than there are in Azarbaijan :p   as a personal observation, a lot of the Azeris I've met are very well integrated into Iranian culture (its a very weired sentence lol since they are Iranians lol). While the issue of more cultural rights seems big with the people i've met, I've never gotten the sense that they want to separate (much like Kurds)"

iran,3cf6lm,IR-TR,3,Tue Jul 7 14:48:18 2015 UTC,"All for the partition of the countries in the region. Which is why it's vital to have the plans stopped in Syria and Iraq. Heck, even Iraq would probably suffice. Thank god Sunni areas haven't got a single drop of oil in Iraq. Might help them stay together yet."
iran,3cf6lm,107126943738213,8,Tue Jul 7 21:56:58 2015 UTC,"Also, consider pitting Iran and Saudi Arabia against each other as a similar situation, much like the other commenter stated. Sunni vs. Shia. Placing embargoes on Iran while funding Saudi Arabia and supplying them with weapons. The US certainly benefits from undermining Middle Eastern nations through neoliberalist tactics to keep the area in endless turmoil. A united middle east, in America's opinion, is a national security threat."
iran,3cf6lm,107126943738213,7,Tue Jul 7 17:05:24 2015 UTC,A united middle east is what Khomeini said would be the ultimate fight against Israel in the 1980's.  It's not possible at all because money speaks and America is funding it all.
iran,3cf6lm,107126943738213,5,Tue Jul 7 17:43:27 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, but it would also be a greater national security threat, because a united middle east would also challenge western economic and cultural hegemony. The preservation of Israel is just a small factor."
iran,3cf6lm,107126943738213,8,Tue Jul 7 18:54:35 2015 UTC,Israel is not a small factor.
iran,3cf6lm,koodak,8,Tue Jul 7 19:46:01 2015 UTC,"Why is that?  Israel is just a tool to keep the middle east in turmoil. If Arabic nations would unite, and focus on much larger global issues, like forming a federation, then they would be able to resist western economic and cultural hegemony and exploitation, and Israel would be a pebble in a sea of boulders."
iran,3cf6lm,107126943738213,7,Tue Jul 7 20:34:52 2015 UTC,"Israel is an American satellite. If America wants a quick fix in the middle east, it orders Israel not UAE, Qatar or S.A. because there is a strong bond that takes them back as far as the 1950's. These two have such a mutual relationship that Israel is more than just an ally in the region; it's a control."
iran,3cf6lm,107126943738213,3,Tue Jul 7 20:41:41 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The US and Saudi Arabia have a much older relationship, and maintain a special relationship. Their relationship extends from 1933, when the US was one of the first nations to recognize them. The first being Great Britain.  You can see how much influence over America Saudi Arabia has by how quickly the US acquiesced during the Yom Kippur war after Saudi Arabia began an oil embargo. The US brokered a deal between Egypt and Israel where both sides shared political victories, because of Saudi influence.  Saudi Arabia provides 17% of US oil, the second largest amount. It provided the most oil to the US for nearly 60 years and only recently, 2009, was surpassed by Canada.  Saudi Arabia is a much more strategic partner in the Middle East due to it's control over vast resources vital to America. Like I said previously, Israel is a distraction for Arab nations, along with fights between Sunni/Shia and ethnic conflict. A united Middle East would be a huge issue for America.  *Edit  I agree Israel is a satellite of the US (obviously), however, like I stated, it is a tool for the US to create conflict in the Middle East, and keep the Middle East from uniting. A distraction from global involvement, if you will. I think we are arguing the same thing from different lenses. You have to think about the greater scale of things.   Imagine the economic force that a united Middle East that opposes western cultural hegemony and neo-liberalist economic coercion would pose."

iran,3cf6lm,IR-TR,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:21:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry, let me rephrase - your ""analysis"" of the US role in Middle Eastern politics is laughably bad. The US benefits from stability in the region, not chaos. That's why it's trying so desperately to sign a nuclear deal with Iran, the most stable country in the region. Chaos means less trade and economic growth, a less stable oil supply, and openings for insurgent groups to gain power, which the US then spends time, money and blood fighting. If you think the US is intentionally creating chaos in the Middle East in order to keep the region weak and exploited, you're a complete idiot."
iran,3cf6lm,IR-TR,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:56:04 2015 UTC,"You should look more into US involvement in the region and what neoliberalism actually is. If you think that geopolitics actually operates in a non-game theory manner, you are naïve. Between the many covert operations to engineer regime changes (Syria 1949, Iran 1953, Iraq 1960-1963, Afghanistan 1979-1989, Iraq 1992-1996, Iran 2005), not to mention state sponsored terrorism and the CIA arming insurgent and rebel factions for the last 50 years, all evidence points away from what you say. US involvement is classic neo-imperialism. Destabilize the region and extract the resources.  They are signing a nuclear deal, because the US wants to decrease it's reliance on Saudi Arabia, and has been doing so since 2009. Signing a deal with Iran and lifting the embargoes will further destabilize the region as the Saudi Arabia and Iran vie for superiority in the region. Destabilization does not only equal armed conflict.  No, occidental nations do not benefit from a strong, stable Middle East. A strong Middle East would pose a huge threat to western economic and cultural hegemony in the region and abroad. The US does not want other world powers that are not aligned with their ideology. Look at their containment of China as an example of that.  Maybe you could leave the personal attacks out of this and have a legitimate conversation."
iran,3cf6lm,Dasizme,4,Wed Jul 8 12:48:34 2015 UTC,"The worldview that you're demonstrating here is essentially a colonized mindset. The US is an all-powerful master of events, and when things blow up or descend into chaos it's the result of careful planning that advances an agenda. This view is ""colonized"" because it ascribes omniscient power to the US, in which the world-as-it-exists is just the result of ""occidental"" interest-furthering. The truth is that the US has no ability to master events in the region and is riding the tiger of Middle East politics, doing its best to advance its interests and struggling to figure out what happens in region X if it pulls a lever in region Y. I truly can't stand the attitude that ""if it happened, it must be because the US (or the English, or the Russians) wanted it to happen and made it happen."" There's no allowance for the randomness and human error that characterizes all politics. Americans aren't all-knowing gods, they're bumbling planners that screw up all the time, just like everyone else. You may think of yourself as fiercely anti-US, but the worldview you're advancing depends on Americans being able to pull off super-human feats of foresight, planning, and manipulation. Case in point - did Daesh arise as the unintended result of terrible policies undertaken during the occupation of Iraq? Absolutely. Did Daesh arise through a carefully-planned American effort to create an insurgent group that could offset Iranian regional hegemony and create a pre-text for further intervention? No, and anyone who thinks this is suffering from a colonial hangover in which nothing can happen unless the Western masters want it to happen.  The other problem with this worldview is that it's tautological. The premise is that the US has a secret plan, so if evidence is given that the US is motivated by something other than ""destabilize the region and extract the resources,"" you can just say that that's the fake plan for the public and the real, evil plan is secret. It's all very convenient. I.e. - if the US signs a nuclear deal, it must be part of a neo-liberal plan to de-stabilize the region and start an arms race and proxy wars between Iran and Saudi Arabia. If I show you an interview in which Obama explains that the nuclear deal is designed to achieve literally the opposite, as part of an effort to de-incentivize Iran from engaging in asymmetrical warfare and sponsor insurgents because conventional avenues of power projection have been closed off through sanctions and isolation, you can just say that he's lying. How could you ever be convinced that he's not lying? Your argument already assumes what it's trying to prove, so there's no way to falsify it and it's impossible to engage in any dialogue. You might argue that your argument is based in fact, like that the US government is ""neo-liberal"" and has invaded regimes for the sake of its own interests in the past, but that's not evidence. It's saying that the US is one kind of regime, and this kind of regime always does X, so the US must always be doing X at any given point in time. That's not an argument...that's the kind of thinking that allows people to justify racism or other non-thinking prejudices (""This person belongs to a category of people that are always violent, so this person must also always be violent!"") Argue on the facts. If you think that the US is pursuing a nuclear deal to encourage Iran and Saudi Arabia to get in a war, you'll have to provide more evidence than ""do you even know what neoliberalism is?? The US overthrew Mossadeq in 1953 so they must be doing the same thing now too!!!""  The final problem with your argument is that it doesn't make any factual sense. The US does have interests - those interests aren't ""destabilize and extract resources,"" those interests are ""free trade,"" which is different than ""extract resources."" The US wants it to be easy for any country in the world to buy lots of American goods, and it wants any country in the world to be able to sell its goods to America cheaply and reliably. The US therefore has a powerful, almost overriding interest in stability, because stable conditions allow for investment, consumption, and trade. When a country descends into war, investment becomes too risky and people that would have started businesses or invested in growing businesses flee and put their money somewhere that's more likely to generate a return. Consumers exit ""spend"" mode and enter ""save"" mode, hurting American business interests that depend on selling stuff. Now, does this mean that the US will sometimes have an interest in removing a regime that makes business impossible (Saddam, Castro, Allende) and replacing it with a pro-business regime? Yes, and this has happened. However, if you've been paying attention to the world, this path of action has become extremely rare. The US has learned that de-stabilizing a country by removing its government tends to produce unpredictable outcomes that usually work against US interests. In the past 50 years, the number of coups, interventions, civil wars and interestate conflicts has gone down dramatically, and the average standard of living (including in the Middle East) has risen dramatically as more people gain access to cheap consumer goods and businesses gain access to investment capital that allows them to produce more reliably, cheaply, and profitably. This benefits the US immensely, and while it is certainly possible that it would conclude it has more to gain from removing a government than encouraging stability, this is an increasingly rare pattern of thought. It's not an accident that the US stopped trying to assassinate Castro and ultimately decided to just end the embargo. It's not an accident that the US started investing in Burma instead of sponsoring a guerilla group. It's not an accident that the US stopped trying to overthrow the IR and is instead concentrating on ending economic sanctions. It's not an accident that literally everyone, including the US security establishment, considers Iraq to be the worst foreign policy mistake America has made in the modern era.   I'm not saying the US will never overthrow another regime. I'm saying the US has recognized that 9 times out of 10, its interests will be better served by lowering barriers to trade instead of creating instability through conflict, which hampers trade. Your analysis that the US will always be motivated to create instability is just wrong.    A strong Middle East would pose a huge threat to western economic and cultural hegemony   What does this even mean? American economic power depends on their businesses being able to grow, and that's dependent on finding more consumers that will buy American stuff. A strong, prosperous Middle East would make America billions and billions of dollars. Cultural hegemony...come on."

If it was better designed, I'm sure a lot of people would use it and he could make a lot of money. A few worrying points keep me from using it, however:   The website is not hosted through https, and does not have a valid SSL certificate. In order to purchase a ticket, you have to figure out what line you want to take (it doesn't determine the optimal path for you) You need to put your name, gender, email, passport number (!), and what kind of seating you want -- all in an unencrypted, non-https page Then it gets manually reviewed, and if a booking exists and your application is legitimate, you pay for the ticket through a paypal gateway and you can use your credit/debit card there (I didn't get this far) By some agreement and a sprinkle of trust, a ticket will get emailed to you once the payment is received.   I wouldn't recommend it."

I will have to apply for an Iranian visa in London.   ""Since 1st December 2011 the Iranian Consulate in London is closed until further notice. However still we can apply for a visa code and send the visa approval number to any other Iranian consulate in the world so you can stamp your passport.""  Source."

iran,3c88zg,QueLogico,3,Sun Jul 5 21:12:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news.  My last trip was in April 2014, but because I already had my visa before then, the new rules didn't apply to me, so I can't tell you anything about what the tours are like, but Persian Voyages (the link in my previous post) were very helpful when I was getting my visa (I sent my passport to the consulate in Dublin - it wasn't cheap or quick, but it was easy), so I would recommend talking to them about the kinds of tours they offer.  (Sorry for the long and messy sentence...)"
iran,3c88zg,stax_n_stax,2,Sun Jul 5 21:20:22 2015 UTC,"How much did they charge you for the passport-to-Dublin process? Did you ever visit the consulate in London when it was open? It was a special, chaotic, fruitless experience when I done it years ago."
iran,3c88zg,ks918,3,Mon Jul 6 16:04:20 2015 UTC,"Especially if a nuclear deal is reached, I'd be pretty optimistic that the situation with the tour requirement will soon change. There's a lot of talk about the Iranian Consulate in London reopening, and vice versa.  There's also a rumour that British citizens don't need a tour anymore, only an authorisation code, according to the Dublin and Paris embassies. Travel agencies, however, aren't providing the codes without a tour.  EDIT: Though perhaps not soon enough for this Autumn! I'm going in that time period, actually - fingers crossed that you'll be able to, too."
iran,3c88zg,ThisWasMySistersIdea,3,Mon Jul 6 00:47:13 2015 UTC,"I have heard that the British citizens who don't need a guide or to be on a tour are those whose origins are not England, say India or Pakistan.  It is really hard to find official information about this.  You are right, the tour agencies are still insisting on tours before providing codes.  It is very hard to find accurate information about this."
iran,3c88zg,ThisWasMySistersIdea,3,Mon Jul 6 12:01:09 2015 UTC,As a British national you will have to be either part of a group tour or hire a private guide through a travel agency.    Most people in the UK wanting a visa to Iran travel to Dublin to have the visa put into their passport. You do not need to go to Dublin yourself and you can pay a company to go to Dublin with your passport to have the visa put in.  You can also designate picking up your visa at an Iranian embassy in another country but you have to designate the location when authorization codes are applied for.  There is a time limit in which the codes are valid and you need to have the visa put into your passport before the codes expire. I traveled to Iran with two ladies from Britain and they said it was a bit complicated but not impossible to arrange.    Iran is a cash country due to sanctions restrictions.  I just carried as much cash as I thought I would need and then extra.  I have heard that some people have managed to get cash via their credit cards using merchants who have overseas branches with credit card processing capabilities.  Accessing cash this way is expensive and should be avoided if at all possible.     Visiting Iran is more complicated than going to most places.  But I think the experiences you will have there will greatly outweigh any  hassle you might encounter in getting a visa or needing a guide.  I had a wonderful time there and I am sure you will also.

iran,3c7vuw,uncannylizard,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:52:04 2015 UTC,"In case of paywall here is the text of the article:  Iran has already started selling nuclear deal to its people - Anshel Pfeffer   VIENNA — U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that Iran and the U.S. have made ""genuine progress"" on a nuclear agreement, but added that there are several difficult issues to resolve.  Speaking at a press conference, Kerry said Washington is ready to walk away from the talks if need be.  ""We have in fact made genuine progress but ... we are not yet where we need to be on several of the most difficult issues,"" he said. ""If we don't have a deal and there is absolute intransigence and unwillingness to move on the things that are important… President Obama has always said we're prepared to walk away.""  The foreign ministers of the six world powers are scheduled to arrive in Vienna on Sunday evening.  Meanwhile, as the latest round of talks on Iran's nuclear program enters its 13th day, the country's leaders have started trying to convince Iranians that the deal is a good one.  On Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met with his American counterpart, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, as the marathon negotiations between the P5+1 powers and Tehran continued.  The main obstacles remained Iran’s objections to “invasive” supervision of its nuclear facilities and its demands for commitments to lift all sanctions as soon as possible. The negotiators are expected to need all the allotted time until the Tuesday-night deadline.  But a major revelation happened Saturday night when Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Iranian TV the two sides were very close to agreeing on wording.  From Araghchi’s statements, it seems final approval will not happen this week but will be done in three stages. Other officials in Vienna have made similar statements: The current round of talks would end with an “adoption of the agreement” but probably without a formal signing.  That stage would last about two months, during which the U.S. Senate and Iranian parliament would consider and vote on the deal. (It seems a veto from U.S. President Barack Obama would be needed to overcome Republican opposition in the Senate.)  During the next stage, the Iranians would have to let inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency confirm that Tehran was keeping to the deal and had halted its nuclear program for possible military purposes. Only at the end of this process, probably toward the end of this year, would the agreement officially take effect.  This framework is meant to meet a central requirement that Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei raised two weeks ago: The economic sanctions on Iran must be lifted immediately upon the signing of the agreement.  The fact that Araghachi has already provided details stems from President Hassan Rohani’s need get public opinion on his side against objections by conservatives.  The Obama administration, meanwhile, is expected to run into objections mostly in the Senate and is trying to moderate expectations. It has told reporters that only a draft is being negotiated by experts, with nothing so far agreed on by the foreign ministers.  This was the response put out by the administration Saturday, when the news broke of agreements to establish a committee to discuss possible violations by Iran, and the possibility of restoring sanctions.  To reach a deal, the parties still need to craft the details on lifting the sanctions and agree on procedures for supervising and inspecting Iran’s nuclear facilities. These two issues could still cause big problems, with the Iranians demanding more detailed commitments on removing sanctions while trying to soften the inspection procedures.  Any wording needs the approval of all six countries taking part in the negotiations — the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius is seen as the biggest hawk in the talks, someone who will demand significant commitments for supervision and inspection.  During a visit to Israel last month, Fabius said that only a serious inspection regime could prevent countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt from developing nuclear weapons of their own."

When the rice is almost done put a few pieces of paper towel or a tea towel on top of the pot without letting it touch the rice and hold it in place with the lid of the pot.

iran,3c6bzx,2012DOOM,2,Sun Jul 5 20:30:16 2015 UTC,"There are two main reasons why Baha'is are disliked in Iran: Political and religious.  First the political: 1- Historically, Baha'ism was created from Babism. The Bab was himself a madman whose followers created chaos in the country. He first claimed he was a Gate to the Mahdi, then he claimed he was the Mahdi himself, then he stated that he was a Prophet with a new religion and finally he stated that he was God and then after receiving a good beating he recounted all his claims. No sane person would act like this. The laws of the Bab were to destroy everyone and anything who did not follow his religion: they were the Qajar era ISIS. His followers caused three civil wars in Iran that resulted in the death of thousands. They also tried to assassinate the Shah of Iran. Baha'is greatly praise the Bab, his laws, and his actions. Any people with this attitude will not be loved by the citizens of a country.  2-Baha'u'llah, the creator of the Baha'i cult, who was himself a former follower of the Bab, was one of the people who had collaborated to assassinate the Shah and was put on death row but was saved by the Russian government who was at war with Iran in that time. You all know the attitude of the Russian government towards Iran in those times and the miseries they inflicted upon us (and still do). That same cruel Russian government saves the bottom side of an inmate on death row who is creating discord in the country and in return receives great praises from Baha'u'llah. Again no citizen of a country will like the followers of a person who praises their arch enemy and is supported by them.  Religious: The majority of Iranians are Shia Muslims. The Baha'i cult founders have done everything possible to insult Shia people and beliefs and state laws/beliefs that completely contradict Shia Islam and its prophecies. These range in Baha'u'llah claiming that he is God in very explicit terms and that all people are his creations and that he must be worshiped by everyone, claiming that Shias are infidels and his deniers are bastards, insulting the Shia scholars for not believing in his claims, claiming the Bab the madman who was executed without achieving pretty much nothing is the true Mahdi who was according to Shia belief supposed to fill the earth with peace and justice once and for all. They also praise the creator of the Shaykhi cult, Shaykh Ahmda al-ahsa'i, and believe he prophesized about Baha'ism. This Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa'i was indeed a strange man with even stranger beliefs who believed in the existence of a city filled with women who impregnated themselves using a penis tree. Anyway, propagating beliefs like this amongst a Shia population will not earn you respect specially when you are insulting the Shia beliefs in every way possible."

iran,3c6bzx,felinebeeline,2,Mon Jul 6 10:05:09 2015 UTC,"According to Abdu'l-Baha, the second Baha'i leader, these were the laws of the Bab:  در یوم ظهور حضرت اعلی منطوق بیان ضرب اعناق و حرق كتب و اوراق و هدم بقاع و قتل عام الّا من آمن و صدّق بود  عبدالبهاء، مکاتیب، ج 2، ص 266  ""The utterance of the [book or religion] of Bayan in the day of the appearance of his Highness Ala (meaning the Bab) was to behead, burn the books, destroy the monuments, and massacre [everyone] but those who believed [in the Bab’s religion] and verified it.""

iran,3c52s3,thewanderingmystic,5,Sat Jul 4 21:32:19 2015 UTC,"Muslim scholars have a long history of differing views on music. I have never once seen any agreement on the subject between major scholars.  To understand the confusion, the first point is that the Qur'an says nothing about music. Like, absolutely nothing.  Next, there is hadith literature. There are hadiths which condemn music, but there is a huge caveat, which is that Arabic did not contain the word ""music"", and I'm not even sure if Arabic has an equivalent word for it. What Arabs back then thought of as ""music"" was frivolous entertainment, like people reveling and throwing licentious parties where people drank alcohol and danced. Islamic tradition was strongly against that, but otherwise didn't seem to have an issue with music itself.  One of the most famous hadiths dealing with music is when the Prophet stopped Abu Bakr from throwing out drummers that Aisha had brought into the house. This hadith coupled with Arab tradition lead to Islamic scholars generally declaring drumming permissible. They also generally encouraged singing, as Islam was quite favorable toward vocal expression. Lots of traditional ""Islamic"" music features only singing and drums because of this.  Then there are hadiths which say that people who listen to music will go to hell, and these are popular with Shias. Therefore, some Shia scholars are absolutely opposed to music in any form. Such scholars tend to take a harsher stance even than Sunnis do. (Their dislike of Aisha probably has something to do with it at as well.)  On the other hand, top Shia scholars have issued different opinions. Ayatollah Sistani, the most-followed marja', says that only music which is ""suitable for vain gatherings"" is forbidden. In one of his books he specifically states that how the music sounds or makes you feel is irrelevant, and only its social function is considered. Other Shia scholars say exactly the opposite, and say that music that is stimulating or makes you want to dance is forbidden. Khamenei, who is rather lenient on the issue, says music is allowed if it's stylistically tame, such as classical music or music that might be used for film soundtracks.  Of course these are contemporary views. I have no idea what classical Persian scholars specifically wrote on the issue, but I doubt a whole lot has changed in the past millennium."
iran,3c52s3,marmulak,4,Sun Jul 5 19:12:51 2015 UTC,"I think the classical music scene in Iran like the traditional kemancheh, setar, tanbur, flute, tar etc is probably the most scholars out there will tolerate with regards to music and maybe some poetic singing as long as it's about something halal. I actually stopped listening to rock and other forms of modern Western music years ago lol and recently moved to the more classical, refined 'small gathering' music."
iran,3c52s3,derintellectual,3,Mon Jul 6 01:04:15 2015 UTC,Yeah Iranian classical style is actually very sophisticated and unique. There's nothing quite like it

iran,3c52s3,Sepahani,3,Mon Jul 6 21:45:54 2015 UTC,"Music has actually been hotly debated for centuries within Islam.  Abu Hamid Ghazali (a Persian) has one of the most famous and convincing defenses of music in Sunni Islam.  Fayz Kashani (a Persian and a Shii scholar) not only permitted music, but encouraged his students to listen to it.  Others have declared it haram.  So, there was not one answer, but in general, those who inclined toward Sufism (in Iran) tended to be more receptive toward music.  Let's not forget that Rumi was very much a ""classical Persian Islamic scholar,"" and his love of music has become famous.

Also, even though we are all communicating in English, what languages are spoken in Iran and which language is the most common?  Thank you!"
iran,3c0e2c,hseldon10,13,Fri Jul 3 17:15:14 2015 UTC,"I would say that Iran has been painted in a very bad light.  The civil rights and state of democracy are far from perfect, but there are US allies like Saudi Arabia which have arguably worse records, yet are viewed in a positive light.  The people in Iran are usually more liberal and open minded than the government to give another perspective on the society.   Persian is the main language, but there are around 17 other languages regularly practiced depending on the region.  Some of these are Kurdish, Azeri, Gilaki, Turkmen, Mazandarani, Luri, Balochi, and Arabic."
iran,3c0e2c,hseldon10,5,Fri Jul 3 17:23:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone in the US sees Saudi Arabia in a positive light. I think everyone understands that Saudi Arabia is tolerated by the US because of the oil.  How do liberal Iranians deal with government restrictions? I remember when Mexico used to be a lot more closed, there were many restrictions, but people basically didn't care and did whatever they wanted. People were only ever prosecuted for political reasons, or for failing to pay taxes. Is it similar in Iran?   Finally, is Persian a hard language to learn?"
iran,3c0e2c,MEXICAN_Verified,7,Fri Jul 3 17:46:23 2015 UTC,Most liberal Iranians ignore them/get around them.  Website blocked? VPN is used.  Muslim wants alcohol? Gets it from a non-muslim/friend.  The list goes on and on.  I would say that political and drug trafficking are the biggest reasons for prosecution.  I've heard that Persian is somewhat easy to learn for foreigners due to it being in the Indo-European language family(Lots of similar grammar and diction)
iran,3c0e2c,Nmathmaster123,2,Fri Jul 3 18:08:16 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone in the US sees Saudi Arabia in a positive light.    Yeah nobody.. just most of the media.

Here is an Iranian folk music and is still popular among older people: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Uu0a8nJqa8   Underground music is pretty big in Iran right now. Most underground singers escape to L.A. where Diasporic singers from the 70's laid their foundations. It is one of the most biggest Iranian communities there as a result and they call it ""Tehrangeles"".

I never came across them at Iranian gatherings or restaurants in the US, so I thought it was not a usual thing for them.

iran,3c0e2c,IranianJew2,7,Fri Jul 3 18:15:14 2015 UTC,"The closest to a taco would be a ""loghmeh"" which is a ""bite"" of flat bread with which you eat some food, typically cheese, crudites and herbs. But it's not something someone would prepare for you, it's just a way of eating bread with other things in small bites, as opposed to in the west where people might make a sandwich."

iran,3c0e2c,WyselRillard,7,Fri Jul 3 18:45:56 2015 UTC,"Yes,  Persian identity comes first, then Judaism.  Religiosity depends on the individual. I would say about equal.

iran,3c0e2c,littletamale,7,Fri Jul 3 19:02:56 2015 UTC,"Adding to what /u/IranianJew2 said, I'd say that Iranian Muslims are the same in that their Persian/Iranian identity comes first, Muslim is second. I am not speaking about the many Iranians who don't consider themselves Muslim - I am speaking about the ones who do, who highly value Islam. Even for these people, Islam doesn't seem to define them the way I've seen with some Arabs or Indonesians."
iran,3c0e2c,WyselRillard,4,Fri Jul 3 20:03:58 2015 UTC,So if they had to choose between Iran and Islam they'd choose Iran? Interesting. Thanks for telling me.  Why is it like that? Are you an Iranian Muslim?
iran,3c0e2c,WyselRillard,6,Fri Jul 3 20:15:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think of it in terms of choosing, since I can't really imagine that scenario. It's more about what's present in how people think and speak about themselves and who else they identify with, if that makes sense. I personally don't consider myself Muslim, but I did grow up with people who did, including my dad who was a bit the strict Muslim dad stereotype. :)  Most of the Iranians where I live now don't see themselves as Muslim, they might not be atheist but they're not religious either. Obviously Islam isn't part of the identity of these people. If anything, the more pro-Shah people see Islam as being contrary to Persian culture and having soiled it somewhat.   But speaking about the others like my dad who are very proud of being Muslim and attached to Muslim values, etc... I still have that impression that it comes to the forefront when it's relevant to the context. Otherwise their identity is really more about being Iranian and they are very proud of Iran's civilization and culture independently of Islam. I started noticing a contrast when spending time with North Africans and other Muslims. I have a friend here who lived in Iran until her teens and has a lot of Arab friends here in the US; she says the same thing. Other people may have different observations of course.   I would guess one of the reasons it's like this because there was already such a strong culture and history, big urban centers, and so on, that Islam got added on instead of replacing what existed."

iran,3c0e2c,WyselRillard,3,Fri Jul 3 21:45:27 2015 UTC,"Basically very strict when it comes to things like going out and having a boyfriend or even male friends (if you're a girl).

iran,3c0e2c,KomodoDwarf,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:43:10 2015 UTC,0_0  how many languages do you speak?
iran,3c0e2c,2012DOOM,5,Sat Jul 4 15:30:28 2015 UTC,"My Spanish is really ghetto, but I'd say it's slightly better than the average American. Most Americans know a little Spanish just because it's so pervasive in our society.  Spanish was my first foreign language, and I took Spanish classes all throughout high school, which sadly weren't that effective. I fell short of fluency and never developed my skills outside the classroom.  When I went to college I started getting interested in Asian languages. Like many nerds, I learned a handful of common Japanese phrases from anime. Then I decided I want to learn Korean, so I taught myself Hangul. (Sort of. I didn't understand all of the diphthongs.) Then I gave up on that and started learning Urdu from my Pakistani friends.  My interest in Urdu led me to taking Arabic classes, and after a couple of semesters of Arabic my interest in the language was rather lackluster. I thought it was cool and had lots of Arab friends, but I didn't get the motivation to try to master the language. (Like Spanish.) At that point I was still hoping to develop my Urdu further.  That's when I discovered Persian, and I was so interested in it that I pestered friends to teach for a few years. Then I started taking classes, and the crazy thing is that finally after three years of regular studying and a bit of practice I finally became fluent. Then I married a Persian speaking girl and now I have to speak it every day.  When studying Persian I learned Cyrillic because I had a mind to learn Russian as well. Ended up studying Tajik instead, and then when I moved to Tajikistan I had Russian forced upon me. Now I know like beginner-level Russian, but haven't tried seriously studying the language. It's one of my future goals, though.  After that I started studying Turkish. I think I got a pretty decent handle on basic Turkish since it's so similar to Persian. Studying Turkish helped me pick up some simple Uzbek while I was traveling. (Uzbek is a seriously underrated language.) Tajik is the closest Persian dialect to Uzbek, so that helped me a lot.  Other than that, I played around a bit with Duolingo. I can tell you my levels: German 9, Spanish 8, Turkish 7, Swedish 6, Irish 5.  Duolingo levels are weird because you level up too fast in the beginning and then in the later stages leveling becomes really slow. Therefore, it took a long time for me to get to level 9 in German, so that's the most-practiced language I have on there. I feel like it was good experience, yet I can't speak German worth a damn. Like, I can barely express myself even in simple sentences, whereas in Turkish I can say loads of stuff. Spanish I basically tested into level 8 and left it at that. (I was just curious to see how much I remembered.) Swedish I mostly forgot, which is a shame because it's so beautiful and its grammar is easier than German. Irish I completely forgot. Irish is hard and less rewarding than, say, German.  So if I had to rank all the languages I ever tried to speak/learn, it'd probably look something like this:  Fluent:   English Persian (Farsi)   Low functioning, but studied:   Spanish Turkish Arabic German   Novice; little studied but have some practical experience:   Urdu Russian Uzbek   All of the above language I've had to use in some situations, even if I could barely get by. Knowing little of a language is much better than knowing nothing, so it was totally worth it.  One weird situation was the first time I traveled to Tajikistan, was in the airport in Istanbul on a layover. Some young Iraqi man homed in on me in order to ask me for directions because he was lost and didn't know where to go. He was on a layover from Iraq going to Russia. First I tried English, then Persian, and then I realized the guy could only speak Arabic. I used a combination of sign language and very rudimentary Arabic to show him how to find his gate number. He was super happy; I was like, ""Thank God that's over!"""

I was reading that thread posted the other day about what people thought of the Persian slave who killed Caliph Umar and everyone seemed to adore him so what I'm asking is this because of nationalism or because of Iran being Shi'a (I think Shi'as don't like Umar) or a combination of both? Also do Sunni Iranians also dislike Umar?  What do Kurds living inside the IRI think of the efforts to chance the script from Arabic/Persian to the Latin one? What do other Iranians think of the romanization of the language?
iran,3c0e2c,marmulak,3,Fri Jul 3 18:54:31 2015 UTC,"What is the closest country to Iran culturally speaking?   There are a few, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say Afghanistan. A strong competitor would be something like Azerbaijan. Both used to be part of Iran (Azerbaijan until more recently).   What are the biggest non-Iranian influences in Iran's culture?   In my own biased experience, the English language. I think British influence affected Iran very deeply and also upturned its politics over the past century or so. The British made tea drinking a thing in Iran, just like they had done to India and elsewhere.   I was reading that thread posted the other day about what people thought of the Persian slave who killed Caliph Umar and everyone seemed to adore him so what I'm asking is this because of nationalism or because of Iran being Shi'a (I think Shi'as don't like Umar) or a combination of both? Also do Sunni Iranians also dislike Umar?   I'm going to guess that Sunni Iranians like Umar. For Sunnis it's fundamentally part of their religion to revere Umar. For Iranians who hate him, it is a combination of both nationalism and Shi'ism. The two overlap quite a bit.   What do Kurds living inside the IRI think of the efforts to chance the script from Arabic/Persian to the Latin one? What do other Iranians think of the romanization of the language?   No idea about the first question. Iranians are not absolutely against Romanization. It's done informally all the time, and formal uses of it exist in some key places like street signs. However, if you ask any Iranian about officially changing the script for everything, they're super against it. It's part of their cultural identity."

iran,3c0e2c,WyselRillard,6,Fri Jul 3 19:24:52 2015 UTC,"Could you tell me more? I don't really know that much about the British in Iran besides the coup thing   I'm not a historian, but I am a British Iranophile, so I'll try my best to answer this one.  The very first contact the British had with Iran was apparently traders travelling through Russia and then to the South.  One of the earliest was Anthony Jenkinson in 1561.  At that point, British influence in Asia was basically non-existent, but after the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588, British influence grew and during the 17th Century the East India Company became a major economic player in the region.  During this period relations were quite good, and the British sent various trade delegations, as well as military advisers to aid Iran against the Ottomans.  However, as we know, the British didn't remain only a trading power in India.  Ironically, the British were only really able to take control of India after the Iranians, under Nader Shah, invaded India and decimated the Mughal military.  The Mughals were Persianised Mongols/Turks who ruled most of Northern and Central India.  Moving into the 18th Century, the British were emerging as the dominant power in India, pushing out the other European powers, and Iran was having serious problems in the north with Russia (much of the Central Asian post-Soviet republics used to be Iran).  The end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th Century was the period during which the British became heavily involved in Iranian politics, ostensibly helping the Iranians counter the Russian incursions, but arguably also taking advantage of their weakness.    Then, as we get into the 19th Century, the British solidified their control of India (And, incidentally, started large scale tea production there.  Before that, the British had just been trading Chinese tea across the world, without being able to produce it themselves.) and began to move onto Iran.  This period is referred to as the 'Great Game'.  Presumably having learnt a thing or two from their involvement with the Russian-Iranian conflicts, the British won the Anglo-Persian War in 1857 and drew the modern Eastern borders of Iran, permanently splitting what's now Afghanistan and Pakistan from Iran.  Just 15 years later, the infamous Reuter Concession was signed, which was described at the time as ""The most complete and extraordinary surrender of the entire industrial resources of a kingdom into foreign hands that has ever been dreamed of"".  During this period, the British were also conducting other forms of heavy-duty 'economic warfare' on Iran, in the form of very cheap manufactured goods (in particular textiles), forced contracts for railways, and forced 'free trade' deals, which all but destroyed the local economy and caused significant hardship for ordinary Iranians.  The opening of the Suez canal in 1869 was a major step in this process.  By this point, it could be argued that the British were practically a colonial power in Iran, with a military presence in many cities, which was necessary as the British were not at all popular and I've read you were liable to be lynched as a Briton walking the streets of Iranian cities undefended.  But believe it or not, it managed to get worse.  The 20th Century is where it gets really complex, and to stop this post getting too long, I might have to rush a bit, but basically there was a political crisis known as the Constitutional Revolution, the Russians and the British more or less called an end to the Great Game by effectively partitioning Iran, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (now British Petroleum) was founded to take advantage of Iranian Oil, the First World War happened and Iranians watched powerlessly as the British and Russians marched around as they pleased.  After the war, the British tried to expand their zone of control, but ran into difficulty with the Iranian parliament.  This resulted in the overthrow of the Shah by the British, and the introduction of a new dynasty, which was officially neutral, but in practice was considerably pro-British.  The Second World War was almost a repeat of the first, with an Anglo-Soviet invasion and a lot of marching around.  After that, the Iranians once again tried to regain some independence, which resulted in 'the coup thing', by which time British power was waning and the baton had been passed onto the Americans.  I hope that wasn't too long and boring.  I tried my best to cover all the main points, but I'm certain I missed some (probably crucial) details, but hey, this is Reddit.  I hope you enjoyed it, and if you have any questions, I may or may not be able to answer them.  Saludos.

As for tea, I don't know what was popular beforehand. I am going to take a wild guess and say coffee because historically a lot of coffee-drinking cultures switched over to tea. In Iran the word ""qahvekhâne"" (قهوه خانه), literally ""coffeehouse"" is the main word use to refer to any and all cafes, which mainly just serve tea. No joke, I heard many of them don't even serve coffee."

Azerbaijan are also Shiites, but they got Sovietized big time. Technically Azeris are Iranians, and they speak a dialect of Turkish like many people inside Iran. Afghanistan is also a Persian-speaking majority like Iran, and there are historical links there. Tajikistan may be Persian-speaking and Iranian, but it's also sort geographically and culturally disconnected, being so remote. Armenia, well... I don't know man."
iran,3c0e2c,rezsahin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:00:25 2015 UTC,"What is the closest country to Iran culturally speaking?   Afghanistan and tajikstan, although that would be if Iran was Persia, Iran is a multi-ethnic country and as such all other Iranic ethnicities would be considered close to Iran culturally speaking. Although I will say Iraqi kurdistan, and armenia are also very close, unfortunatley it doesn't seem azarbaijan seems to value their iranian identity much :(    •I was reading that thread posted the other day about what people thought of the Persian slave who killed Caliph Umar and everyone seemed to adore him so what I'm asking is this because of nationalism or because of Iran being Shi'a (I think Shi'as don't like Umar) or a combination of both? Also do Sunni Iranians also dislike Umar?    Okay so, yes he rid us of the tyrant, unlike Abu Bakr, Omar never was super special, but mainstream shia islam (despite having a lot of animosity against the first 3 caliphs) says its wrong to insult them outright, much less kill them. Shias do it anyways though, (which I think is wrong but at the same time if you see what they did you would be pissed too). its supportive to borderline neutral.    What do Kurds living inside the IRI think of the efforts to chance the script from Arabic/Persian to the Latin one? What do other Iranians think of the romanization of the language?   I'm guessing they think its a shit idea because they already use the perso-arabic script. Much like Iraqi and some parts of Syrian Kurdistan, Iranian kurds use the perso-arabis script and speak Sorani. Turkish and some Syrian kurds speak Kurimanji. Sorani is very simmilar to Farsi but i'm not sure about kurimanji. but otherwise Iranian kurds are much closer culturally to their roots than Turkish kurds."

iran,3c0e2c,f16falcon95,3,Fri Jul 3 22:04:48 2015 UTC,How was Iran affected by the Mongol conquest? Did they leave anything significant behind? Were a lot of people killed?  I read that Persian Miniature style painting in which people seem to have East Asian features came from China via the Mongols is this true?
iran,3c0e2c,WyselRillard,10,Fri Jul 3 18:42:15 2015 UTC,"The Mongol conquests were the most destructive of all invasions into the Iranian heartland. Major cities that were once centers of Islamic philosophy and scholarship were depopulated, and the massive loss of population -- which never fully recovered until the 20th century -- caused a shift from urban settlements to rural, tribal lifestyles. Iran essentially lost its status as a competing superpower, and instead became one of the poorest countries in the world; leaving it exposed to foreign occupation. The demographics of the region changed too, with many Iranian areas (Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, etc.) being settled by Turkic peoples and Turco-Mongol words being introduced to the Persian language. Due to these patterns, religious mysticism became more favorable among the population; laying the groundwork for the Safavids and eventually, the modern state of Iran.  The Mongols, however, left behind some interesting things: One are the miniature paintings which you described, as they were popular following the Mongol invasions and drew influence from the Chinese. More importantly, as they were no longer attached to the rest of the Islamic world, Iranian historians, scientists, and officials began writing in Persian, as opposed to Arabic. Hulagu Khan's destruction of Baghdad and the Abbasid Caliphate terminated the Arab domination of Iran. In agriculture, Rice became a staple crop and is still a central part of Iranian cuisine. Similar to China, commercial relationships with Europe opened up, for better or worse.   Ultimately, like all of Iran's invaders, the Mongols eventually adopted Iranian culture and converted to an Iranian style of Islam. This ability to subsume other cultures, is a source of pride among many Iranians. If you think about it, it was Iranian culture that convinced Timur (one of the most brutal Turco-Mongol invaders) to convert to Islam and get himself circumcised. This makes us the only culture on Earth that successfully convinced an invader to chop off a piece of his own penis; he may have conquered a lot of land and killed a lot of people, but he'd never be able to reclaim what we took from him."
iran,3c0e2c,f16falcon95,0,Fri Jul 3 20:43:15 2015 UTC,"in Persian, as opposed to Arabic.    Why did you guys adopted the Arabic script?   an Iranian style of Islam.    Was Iranian Sunni Islam different from the one in North Africa and the  Arab lands?"
iran,3c0e2c,Nmathmaster123,6,Fri Jul 3 21:43:26 2015 UTC,"Why did you guys adopt the Arabic script?   Modern Persian uses the Perso-Arabic script which has a number of differences with the Arabic script.   It is important to note that Iran did not have a unified script for its court or academic languages until after the Islamic conquests. For example, Achaemenid edicts were written multilingually, and Old Aramaic was the lingua franca of the era. The Achaemenids standardized Old Persian's cuneiform writing by basing it on Imperial Aramaic's orthography.   Middle Persian, then, came to be written in a derivative of Syriac known as Pahlavi script. Under Sassanid rule many variants of this derivative were devised, including the artificial script specifically created to preserve the Avesta known as din dabērag or ""liturgical script."" This was one of the first, probably the first, entirely artificial scripts.  With New Persian, and the influences of Arabic on the Persian language, the Perso-Arabic supplanted these older, disorganized scripts. The educated elite of Iran at the time were also either religious clergy or academic -- the lingua franca of both fields being Arabic at the time -- which also led to its widespread usage.   Was Iranian Sunni Islam different from the one in North Africa and the Arab lands?   Iranian Sunnism had elements of Iranian culture that was exposed to the Turco-Mongol invaders. See this quote by Bernard Lewis, a prominent source on Iranian history:   In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, a new Islam sometimes referred to as Islam-i Ajam. It was this Persian Islam, rather than the original Arab Islam, that was brought to new areas and new peoples: to the Turks, first in Central Asia and then in the Middle East in the country which came to be called Turkey, and of course to India. The Ottoman Turks brought a form of Iranian civilization to the walls of Vienna.""   -- From: http://www.academia.edu/3878421/Iran_in_History_by_Bernard_Lewis"

Beside thinking that Ali should've been the first Caliph what are other differences between Sunnis and Shi'as? Are there any other Shi'a denominations (or schools of thought) in Iran besides Twerlvers? Do shi'as have the Ramadan fast too? What's it like? What other Islamic festivities are there? And how are they celebrated inside Iran? Is Jumah prayer mandatory? What do you guys think about Saudi Arabia? And its handling of Medina and Makkah? Especially in regards to all the buildings being constructed in the latter? Are time schedules centered around the 5 salat of the day? Or how do people manage to do then when doing everyday stuff? Are Sunni Mosques different from the Shi'a ones? Why are there so many Shi'a shrines inside Iran when up until the Safavids most of the country was Sunni? Are Iranians allowed to go on hajj/umrah to Saudi Arabia? Are people who go allocated the title of hajji or is this and Arab thing? What do you guys think about Bahrain and Iraq the only other countries in the world that are also Shi'a majority? A guy in /r/Arabs explained to me what a Marja' was so who are Iran's popular Marjas?

iran,3c0e2c,WyselRillard,3,Fri Jul 3 19:38:02 2015 UTC,"I'll let more knowledgeable people answer these questions, but a note that the main festival in Iran is not a Muslim festival, but rather a squarely Iranian festival that predates Islamization of Iran. The festival is Norooz. It translates literally to ""new day"" and it is the Persian New Year, which falls on the Spring Equinox - same as the Mayan New Year.  Most other Muslim countries don't celebrate Norooz, but Kashmir for example does celebrate it because Islam was brought there by Iranians. In the context of India, where Muslims are a minority, celebrating Norooz is an affirmation of that identity even though it is Zoroastrian in its origin."

It is celebrated on the day of the astronomical Northward equinox, which usually occurs on March 21 or the previous/following day depending on where it is observed. The moment the sun crosses the celestial equator and equalizes night and day is calculated exactly every year and families gather together to observe the rituals.  Nowruz is celebrated by people from diverse ethnic communities and religious backgrounds for thousands of years. It is a secular holiday for most celebrants that is enjoyed by people of several different faiths, but remains a holy day for Zoroastrians.

iran,3c0e2c,WyselRillard,2,Fri Jul 3 20:21:45 2015 UTC,"Why it survived is an interesting question and I can't give a good answer, but i think it is important to remember that the Islamic conquest can't be compared with the conquest of the Americas. It wasn't as thorough or destructive, and even with smallpox and settler colonialism, in Mexico there are still indigenous religious practices. With that comparison it seems less surprising that the Zoroastrian heritage lived on. Norooz isn't the only Zoroastrian festival that Muslims celebrate btw, there's also Shabe Yalda which is the winter equinox."

The destruction of historical sights in the area is also upsetting.  Jumah prayer is not required.    Iranians are Shia now, so the faiths of ancestors can be disregarded.

So is this true?   yes,  mostly because the millennial generation like me saw the abuses of power by the IRI and for some this translated (somehow) as Islam doing the oppressing and abusing, and they became disenchanted with religion.

iran,3c0e2c,f16falcon95,3,Fri Jul 3 19:54:32 2015 UTC,"1953 Iranian coup d'état:       The 1953 Iranian coup d'état, known in Iran as the 28 Mordad coup, was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran Mohammad Mosaddegh on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the United Kingdom (under the name 'Operation Boot') and the United States (under the name __TPAJAX* Project_).      Mossadegh had sought to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), a British corporation (now BP) and to change the terms of the company's access to Iranian petroleum reserves. Upon the refusal of the AIOC to co-operate with the Iranian government, the parliament (Majlis) voted to nationalize the assets of the company and expel their representatives from the country.    Following the coup in 1953, a government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad-Rezā Shāh Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran (Persian for an Iranian king),  to rule the country more firmly as monarch. He relied heavily on United States support to hold on to power until his own overthrow in February 1979.     In August 2013, 60 years after, the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) admitted that it was involved in both the planning and the execution of the coup, including the bribing of Iranian politicians, security and army high-ranking officials, as well as pro-coup propaganda.   The CIA is quoted acknowledging the coup was carried out ""under CIA direction"" and ""as an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government.""   Iran's oil had been discovered and later controlled by the British-owned AIOC.  Popular discontent with the AIOC began in the late 1940s: a large segment of Iran's public and a number of politicians saw the company as exploitative and a central tool of continued British imperialism in Iran.   Despite Mosaddegh's popular support, the AIOC was unwilling to allow Iranian authorities to audit the company accounts or to renegotiate the terms of its access to Iranian petroleum. In 1951, Iran's petroleum industry was nationalized with near-unanimous support of the Majlis in a bill introduced by Mossadegh who led the Iranian nationalist party, the National Front. In response, Britain instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically.  Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the British-built Abadan oil refinery, then the world's largest, but Prime Minister Clement Attlee opted instead to tighten the economic boycott  while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh's government.  With a change to more conservative governments in both Britain and the United States, Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration decided to overthrow Iran's government, though the predecessor Truman administration had opposed a coup.  Classified documents show that British intelligence officials played a pivotal role in initiating and planning the coup, and that the AIOC contributed $25,000 towards the expense of bribing officials.   Britain and the US selected General Zahedi to be the prime minister of a government that was to replace Mosaddegh's. Subsequently, a royal decree dismissing Mosaddegh and appointing Zahedi was drawn up by the coup plotters and signed by the Shah. The CIA had successfully pressured the weak monarch to participate in the coup, while bribing street thugs, clergy, politicians and Iranian army officers to take part in a propaganda campaign against Mosaddegh and his government.  At first the coup appeared to be a failure when, on the night of 15–16 August, Imperial Guard Colonel Nematollah Nassiri was arrested while attempting to arrest Mosaddegh. The Shah fled the country the next day. On 19 August, a pro-Shah mob paid by the CIA marched on Mosaddegh's residence.  According to the CIA's declassified documents and records, some of the most feared mobsters in Tehran were hired by the CIA to stage pro-Shah riots on 19 August. Other CIA-paid men were brought into Tehran in buses and trucks, and took over the streets of the city.  Between 300  and 800 people were killed because of the conflict.  Mosaddegh was arrested, tried and convicted of treason by the Shah's military court. On 21 December 1953, he was sentenced to three years in jail, then placed under house arrest for the remainder of his life.    Other Mosaddegh supporters were imprisoned, and several received the death penalty.   After the coup, the Shah ruled as an monarch for the next 26 years   while modernizing the country using oil revenues, until he was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution in 1979.    The tangible benefits the United States reaped from overthrowing Iran's elected government included a share of Iran's oil wealth  [clarification needed] and ensuring the Iranian nation remained under the control of an allied dictator. Washington continually supplied arms to the increasingly unpopular Shah and the CIA-trained SAVAK, his repressive secret police force;  however by the 1979 revolution, his increasingly independent policies resulted in his effective abandonment by his American allies, hastening his downfall.  The coup is widely believed to have significantly contributed to anti-American and anti-British sentiment in Iran and in the Middle East. The 1979 revolution deposed the Shah and replaced the pro-Western monarchy with a largely anti-Western authoritarian theocracy.

iran,3c2fdv,alyssadonya,3,Sat Jul 4 07:05:24 2015 UTC,"The diet is not predominantly meat-based. People only think of kabob but in fact kabob is something more special that you have at a restaurant. When my dad was a kid in Iran they only ate meat a couple times a week because people couldn't afford more; like in most other third world countries it's easy to forget that the recent availability of meat is very new.   People eat a lot of stews that have meat, but that largely feature other ingredients that make a complex, well-rounded dish on their own. It's super easy to just make these omitting the meat or replacing it with seitan, tofu or mushrooms. You can just google any type of khoresht and follow the recipe like this. Luckily Persian food doesn't usually have hidden ingredients like broth. (I'm vegan and make Persian food, also know other Persian vegans, let me know if you have any questions)   Edit: to explain more what I mean about the diet not being predominantly meat based. Yes, most dishes have some meat, but the pieces are actually quite small and it's more about adding something to the rest of the dish, as opposed to being the main thing on a plate. Then as people started to be able to afford more meat, the pieces got bigger, but it's still not like a steak dinner where if you remove the steak there's nothing left. Other ingredients and foods are also highly valued (fruits, etc) and one of the most popular soups (ash) is vegetarian."

iran,3c2fdv,white-bmw,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:13:17 2015 UTC,"persian food is actually very easy to convert to vegetarian or even vegan. as otherwise noted,  the majority of dishes are based around fruits + vegetables, with meat really only used for flavor. traditional recipes tend to only use like 100-300 gms (1/3lb to 1 lb)of meat for 10+ people, although we would usually use a little more meat when cooking for special occasions. the majority of our food has ""rustic"" origins, and until modern times meat wasn't really that affordable or readily available in large amounts. this is also why a lot of persian food is set to cook for long periods of time on very low heat, to help tenderize + increase the flavor of what some might consider ""bad"" cuts of meat.  in most recipes you can just simply leave out the meat. although you might want to add in some sort of legume to get protein. different legumes pair better w/ certain dishes. i prefer to use split peas (lapeh) for tomato-based khoreshts (kadu, bademjan, etc.), and kidney beans or chickpeas for herb-based ones (ie khoresh karafs, ghormeh sabzi, khoresh gojeh sabz). when i was a vegetarian i used to add a little bit of MSG to the food i cooked, to get some of that savory meaty flavor as well, but you can also use mushrooms, soy sauce, or chicken/vegetable broth to add some savoriness."

iran,3bz4e8,goftarenik,34,Fri Jul 3 09:18:35 2015 UTC,"The US lied about the location of the USS Vincennes inside Iranian territorial waters for 4 years until a joint Nightline/Newsweek investigation exposed that fact it wAS NOT ""defending itself in international waters"" as claimed, but had entered Iranian waters pretextually and had started shooting at patrol boats that posed no threat to it, possibly as part of an undercover deception operation intended to draw out the Iranian navy so it could be clobbered by the US.  http://www.newsweek.com/sea-lies-200118  The US blamed it all on the ""fog of war"" and complicated technology, as well as the Iranians for ""allowing"" the airliner to fly over the Vincennes while it was supposedly defending itself against attack.  The US denied liability and paid some compensation only ""ex gratia"" (without accepting responsibility)  The US legal advisor, a govt lawyer named Harold Maier, claimed since the US vessel was acting in self-defense in international waters, and that the Captain of the USS Vincennes, William Rogers III, had acted simply to protect himself and his crew in a rough situation and so had to make a quick decision etc etc. so basically, it was all ""just an accident"" and so the US was not responsible, and if anything, the Iranians were responsible.   The United States might be legally liable if it caused the injury while engaged in an internationally illegal act. In this instance, however, the stated objective of protecting the rights of shipping on the high seas, coupled with what was apparently a legitimate belief on the part of the American commander that he was firing in self-defense and the fact that actual fighting was going on when the missile was fired suggest that the ship’s activities, including the firing of the missile, were not illegal under the circumstances.”   He went on to claim that the US was actually setting an example for Iranians to act as a “civilized nation”:   It does seem, however, appropriate and important that as our part of this humanitarian effort is completed, we call, perhaps by joint congressional resolution, upon the Iranian Government to observe how civilized nations should act if they intend to be responsible citizens of the world community. Statement of Prof. Harold G Maier as reproduced in “Agora: Iran Air 655” , American Journal of International Law Vol 83, page 332, 1989   Prof. Andreas Lowenfeld, the Editor of the American Journal of International Law, dismissed this legal reasoning and pointed out that under the standard of international law, the US was automatically responsible regardless of what the Capt of the Vincennes wrongly thought, and this was also the standard that the US had applied to other states in other similar cases:   ""I do not understand Maier's argument at all… the correct legal principle, I am clear, is not as [the US government legal advisors] would have it -- no legal liability to victims of airplane disasters without proof of fault beyond a reasonable doubt, and no fault in combat zones -- but rather liability regardless of fault, so long as the cause is established, as it clearly was in the case of Iran Air 655, as in the case of Korean Air Lines 007. I would have hoped that those who spoke for the United States about the tragedy of July 3, 1988, from the President on down, would have recognized this principle, so essential for the safety of civil aviation, as other spokesmen for the United States and its allies have done when other states' military (whether or not on orders from on high) brought down civilian aircraft that may have strayed off course.""   Then he concluded:    “That principle, it is clear, was breached by the United States in the case of Iran Air 655, and it follows that the United States is responsible. To say that is not to condemn the United States or even to find fault. It is simply to state that responsibility flows from the action itself.”   Andreas F. Lowenfeld, “Looking Back and Looking Ahead” American Journal of International Law Vol 83 Page 336 (April 1989) https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&doctype=cite&docid=83+A.J.I.L.+336&key=87885349dc7bcb901e1bb0af93296045  So in other words, all the excuses for the actions of the Vincennes are legally irrelevant; the Vincennes is automatically responsible by simply doing the act of shooting down a civilian airliner, even ""mistakenly"" or ""accidentally"" or ""unintentionally."" This was also the standard that the US applied to the Soviets when they shot down the Korean airliner which had genuinely strayed off course into Soviet space.  Prof Lowenfeld wrote that in 1989, just less than a year after the incident, while it was still assumed that the Vincennes was in fact in international waters as the US Navy claimed, and that the Iran Air Bus had strayed off course towards it. It was only in 1994 that Admiral Crowe (then retired) told Ted Koppel that was not the case either: the Vincennes had actually entered Iranian waters (and the Airbus was shot down while it was still taking off, inside Iranian airspace, and its wreckage fell inside Iranian waters too.)   Ted Koppel [interviewing]: But if I were to ask you today, was the Vincennes in international waters at the time that she shot down the Airbus—  William J. Crowe Jr.: Yes, she was.  Ted Koppel: In international waters?  William J. Crowe Jr.: No, no, no. She was in Iran’s territorial waters.  Ted Koppel: Let me ask you again. Where was the Vincennes at the time that she shot down the Airbus?  William J. Crowe Jr.: She was in Iran territorial waters. http://www.endusmilitarism.org/vincennes_massacre_anniversary.html   So not only is the US automatically responsible for the shooting under international law anyway even if the missiles were ""accidentally"" launched and  the US Navy ship was outside Iranian waters, worse yet the US navy ship had entered well inside Iranian waters and had then initiated the shooting that ultimately led to the deaths of 290 people...making this an international crime that has gone unaccounted-for.  Some politicians and people in the media then popularized the idea that Iran had placed dead bodies on the plane and deliberately aimed it at the Vincennes in order to score propaganda points. As proof, they pointed out that the dead bodies floating around the wreckage were mostly nude -- because clothes tend to disintegrate when you're blown out of the sky, actually.

iran,3c02o0,babajafar,3,Fri Jul 3 15:30:37 2015 UTC,"Iran does have high interest rates, but you need to also account that it has high inflation as well. You may lose money if you set your money in a fixed interest rate account, while inflation could sky rocket, so it's a bit of a risk. But since in Iran, inflation is always in flux, it hits it's high and lows and if you know the market well, you could make a great deal of profit.   Plus, I think the ""high"" interest rates accounts requires you not to touch it for 5 years."
iran,3c02o0,TeslaRocksss,2,Fri Jul 3 16:12:10 2015 UTC,"Apart from the hi inflation rate you also have to worry about how to take the money out of the country since under current sanctions laws it is illegal for any bank business, and furthermore sanctions laws make it illegal for many to have accounts in Iran, and then if you're a US citizen you have to declare your foreign bank accounts on your taxes etc. etc. and eventually if the US and Iran really do restore ties Iranian banks will have to report the accounts of Americans to US authorities which is now the case for most other countries too"
iran,3c02o0,tinlizzey12,0,Fri Jul 3 16:35:22 2015 UTC,You can transfer money through a sarrafi service (currency exchange).
iran,3c02o0,CYAXARES_II,2,Fri Jul 3 16:38:28 2015 UTC,"Not legally, and so there is every chance that the sarraf will either run away with your money with zero options for you to follow (since it is illegal anyway) or the money will be interrupted along the way and will be confiscated, and even if it makes it into your bank account, now you have a record of a criminal act that furthermore you have to explain to the tax authorities. The only reason they don't crack down is because this is too common, probably, and they want money to leave Iran -- but certainly not enter. So if you go and invest in Iran, there are potential legal consequences for Americans. Serious ones."
iran,3c02o0,tinlizzey12,0,Fri Jul 3 16:44:13 2015 UTC,"I didn't know this was illegal, but I have seen many people transfer funds back and forth from Iran this way with no problems. A reputable sarraf wont run away with your money because he has more to gain by continuing doing his services since the demand for it is so high."
iran,3c02o0,CYAXARES_II,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:46:33 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, super-duper illegal.  Everyone is reputable until they're not. And like I said, the money can be interrupted along the way too, by other banks. The sarraf himself can have his accounts stopped etc etc. Either way, you have nothing but hope as your guarantee, and no legal recourse. Is that worth the benefit, as any investor should ask."
iran,3c02o0,tinlizzey12,2,Fri Jul 3 16:54:05 2015 UTC,If you are moving anything under a total of $400K in smaller 20-30K amounts with a reputable known sarraf you will be safe.
iran,3c02o0,LongArmedKing,2,Fri Jul 3 17:06:02 2015 UTC,"No, you are not ""safe"" with any amount, just perhaps less likely to be pursued...but note that arranging transactions in such a way to avoid setting off alarms (for example by dividing up deposits into multiple but each less than $10,000 amounts so as to avoid reporting to the IRS by the bank) is itself a separate crime called ""Structuring."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuring"
iran,3c02o0,tinlizzey12,2,Fri Jul 3 17:10:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know why the 30K limit, sarrafi usually have it. We are talking about personal wealth (not corporate) that has payed all taxes fully prior to transfer. With the intention that you are not doing business in Iran (eg you say reason for transfer is to buy my mother a home in Iran etc etc). Not 100% safe, but not that problematic. Never heard of any problems for anyone so far. Maybe it's different in the US. Anyway, if it is illegal first thing you notice is sarrafis closing shop or refusing to do transfers because the government is cracking down on them.  Edit* misunderstood your response initially."
iran,3c02o0,LongArmedKing,3,Fri Jul 3 17:28:48 2015 UTC,"A sarraf is simply a money changer; the transaction you're talking about is a havaleh, where you give money one place, and receive money someplace else -- a transfer of money not just an exchange. Just the use of such means to transfer money internationally itself is illegal under US law, even if the money is going to someplace other than Iran. You have to be licensed in order to do that. That's the whole purpose of money laundering laws  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/04/crackdown-on-sanction-violations-what-it-means-for-iranian-americans.html Just be aware of the law and the exceptions.

iran,3c02o0,tinlizzey12,0,Fri Jul 3 17:53:13 2015 UTC,"Even if it's illegal or risky, Iranians will have resorted to it with the current restrictions.  When the main street is closed people naturally resort to the alleyways."

iran,3byizn,tinlizzey12,8,Fri Jul 3 12:57:45 2015 UTC,"Iran is an amazing place. My main complaint is the drug abuse. Especially opiates. It is a blight on the people. Very very sad. Perhaps it is just cultural. I know many people who eat opium but they are wise and use it as a medicine - or simply recreational. It is a pure form and is not damaging when used correctly. Just like wine or marijuana.    The UNODC estimates Iran to have 1.2 million opiate users (2% of the population ) and one the highest rates of heroin addiction per capita in the world    I am not sure what this statistic really ""says"" about Iran. I would rather walk the streets of Tehran at night than NYC ( in their worst ) but I am not sure demonizing opiates - all in all - is a accurate way to diagnose preblems and look for solutions."
iran,3byizn,tinlizzey12,4,Fri Jul 3 15:58:50 2015 UTC,"Oh no, opiates are not just like mj and can never be. Opiate use will kill you, either slowly or quickly. It is an entirely different class of drugs. And and unfortunate consequence of living next  to two failed states that are major drug producers  But the real problem, is now meth and crack"
iran,3byizn,gobrowns1,2,Fri Jul 3 16:03:42 2015 UTC,"Meth and crack are pure poison. The destroy life- period. I hope this is not true what you are saying. Once you get on these speed substances it burns out your pleasure centers in your soul ( brain?) and you are never the same after semi-prolonged addiction ( about 6 to 9 months ). For the most part you are always an addict.   Opium - on the other hand is addictive but the body can tolerate it. And it can make a person creative. They can still me hospitable and creative even spiritual.    Oh no, opiates are not just like mj and can never be. Opiate use will kill you, either slowly or quickly.   I have had some short and long term experience with all of these. Of course alcohol is the most damaging as it is socially acceptable and you loose your rational thought. You stumble here and there. If you are smoking heroin or oxy - you are going to have a probelm with your habit most likely. But some people with large bank can eat opium all the time and have no health issues that mainly occur with forced withdrawal. Other than that - someone who is injecting pure heroin in proper doses can live forever just like someone taking prozac. Trust me - not the data. I have seen it."
iran,3byizn,tinlizzey12,3,Fri Jul 3 16:44:23 2015 UTC,"It is very true. The police chief of Tehran said that he's pushing hard to increase the amount of time it takes for people to access meth in Tehran from 6 minutes to 10 minutes. This is true in many parts of the world, Iran thankfully has humane laws when it comes to treating addicts (though not for smugglers!)  But you eventually have to withdraw from opiates, or die. Permanent constipation is not an option. And that's just one thing. It is killing you, just slowly, as your body shuts down, while needing more and more. No amount of MJ will ever kill you or get you addicted -- just make you happy and hungry and horny."
iran,3byizn,gobrowns1,3,Fri Jul 3 16:49:45 2015 UTC,Hard not to make that improvement with the amount of oil money being made in Iran. These statistics don't tell the whole truth the same way people use statistics from before I.R to show how much Shah did for Iran.  As far as I'm concerned Iran's nuclear negotiation team is a sausage fest. Fucking embarrassing considering how assertive and educated Iranian women are.
iran,3byizn,tinlizzey12,2,Fri Jul 3 20:28:44 2015 UTC,"It is just so hard just to admit that the Islamic Republic did anything good, huh?  Iran actually didn't make much money during that time period but still managed to massively raise living standards.    National wealth, especially for resource-rich countries like Iran, can often mask poor health and education.  In Iran’s case, however, its improvements in health and education far outpace its economic growth, which has been sporadic over the past two decades. “The manner in which countries spend their wealth, not the wealth itself, is decisive,” the new report explains. http://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2010/nov/12/iran-ranked-higher-turkey-brazil-un-development-index   In fact the improvements in living standards were despite Iran's economy sucking, not to mention the war and sanctions and having to provide for the world's largest refugee population from Afghanistan too."
iran,3byizn,gobrowns1,5,Fri Jul 3 20:33:17 2015 UTC,"And what I'm saying is that by those standard s we should also praise the pahlavis because they improved conditions compared what was before. Let's not forget that alot of Iranian women were illiterate and looked like fucking ninjas before Reza Shah came to power. He could have not opened that gate for women like his Saudi counterpart at the time.  I'm not saying I.R didn't make any improvements, just pointing out that these improvements were bound to happen regardless considering the preexisting infrastructure and national status.  Again, the I.R negotiation team is a sausage fest, so is the parliament and the assembly of experts..."
iran,3byizn,tinlizzey12,0,Fri Jul 3 21:00:32 2015 UTC,"we should also praise the pahlavis because they improved conditions compared what was before.    Nope, certainly not at the same rate.

Nothing before compares.    these improvements were bound to happen   Cite?"

Once again, if it were not because of the pahlavis Iranian women would be in no better social condition than their Afghani counterpart.

In short, Iran's HDI improvement took not just a dramatic turn up in comparison to the Shah's time in Iran, but an unprecedented one in comparison to other nations too.  Women in Iran under the Shah were mostly illiterate. They became literate after the revolution. This is just a fact.   Yes, Iran was better off than the Congo under the Shah. That's not setting a high bar, is it?  From 1975 to the revolution in 1980, Iran's HDI was .57 That's comparable to Laos or Cambodia today http://www.photius.com/rankings/human_developement_index_1975-2005.html"

I've heard all these arguments before by bitter ex-Muslim Iranians and the like. There is so little of Zoroastrianism in modern Iranian culture that it's hardly worth considering.  Arguably Zoroastrianism did have an influence over the development of Abrahamic religions, which means that by proxy through Islam there are still traces of Zoroastrian ideology. For example the belief in heaven and hell was supposedly popularized by ancient Zoroastrians.  Hinduism was an important part of what was formerly northern India because there are still millions and millions of active, practicing Hindus in the subcontinent, and South Asian Muslims practice Islam in a way that's more influenced by Hinduism than any influence Zoroastrianism may have exerted on the way Iranians practice Islam.  As for China, millions and millions of Chinese are still Buddhist today.  I would hardly call Zoroastrianism a ""bedrock of the civilization"". First of all, that discredits pre-Zoroastrian Iranian paganism, and secondly most of Iranian culture and civilization was established after Islamization.  What I want you to do is sit down and make a list for me of all the important contemporary elements of Iranian culture that are based on Zoroastrianism."

Do you think that the Mexicans and other indigenous South Americans had no role in shaping the Catholicism that ultimately reigned over them? There's a reason why Latin America is the birthplace of Liberation Theology, an ideology reflected in the current Pope, for goodness' sake.

Furthermore, if you're not aware of the differences in methodology, between European Conquistadors who sought to spread Christianity through missions and purges, with the Islamization of Persia that took nearly two hundred years and was facilitated by inheritance laws, you should research more and/or make more careful analogies. Otherwise, your intentions are unclear.   but felt that the subtext was clear enough   The USA was/is Mexico's neighboring empire, correct. This is not comparable with the littoral states that arose out of Iran's stolen territory by the cooperation between an empire that had previously bordered Iran (the Russian Empire) and an overseas empire.

It is not an imposed, artificial border like the ones that surround Iran.   An ""imposed, artificial border"" is precisely what I imagine Mexicans were calling it back in the day.

Labeling governments as ""ineffective"" without specifying what areas you feel are ineffectual according to your standards, is a value judgment. In addition to all the other claims you are making, this value judgment is coercive and misleading.   I suppose since you cannot attack the statement substantively, you resort to attacking it semantically. I think you know very well what I mean. ""Modern"" history is always a history charged with political implication and that was exactly what I was getting at. Do you honestly think that your intentionally broad and generous definition of ""effective means survival"" in reference to government isn't both coercive and misleading itself? Did the Qajars survive? Did the Pahlavis survive? Did Maximilian survive? Did Diaz survive?

I will not delve into Mexico's affairs, but current reality shows that Iran's governance is effective in meeting the primary needs of nationhood. In terms of economy, Iran has survived the harshest sanctions regime in modern history. In terms of national security, Iran has survived and remained stable in a volatile area where many of its neighbors have perished. There are many more such cases, and this demonstrates effectiveness in areas that would override your claim.  Your assumption that Iran's government is ""at the very least exceptionally backwards and regressive"" is also baseless. Both the system of government, which itself is a modern innovation, and where it's heading contradict this claim. Do you ignore Iran's scientific and technological advancements? Do you think that Iran today is the same Iran as it was 35, 70, or 140 years ago? Compare these answers with Iraq or Syria, which are actual failing states.  Edit: Fixed typo."

iran,3bw5et,LaVidaEsUnaBarca,4,Fri Jul 3 01:07:40 2015 UTC,"There is a big difference, though, which is that Iranians prior to the Arab conquest had thousands of years of history linked with Semites and the Middle East, to the point where their cultures were always in symbiosis. Iranian civilization exerted cultural, linguistic, and religious influence over the Middle East, and the Arab invasion was like temporary feedback.  Once Iranians adopted Islam they went on to further develop it and make it into what it is today. After the Qur'an, the two most important books for Muslims are Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, which were both written by two different Iranians. These books basically define Islam for the majority of Muslims today.  So really, Islam is not foreign to Iranians, and Arabs are hardly foreign. (In fact, some Iranians are Arab.) If Mexico were to be in a similar situation, it would be as if Mexico and Spain shared a border for thousands of years, and during that time Spain was sometimes ruled by Mexico and Mexico was seen as the big brother (or threatening empire), until one day the Spanish became Christian and attacked Mexico, at which point Mexico became Christian too and then then Mexican scholars compiled the Bible.  I think it's fair to say that Iranians influenced Arabs more than Arabs influenced Iranians, and that Iranians are devout Muslims because they were early Muslims and played a fundamental role in Islam's development. Mexican cultures, on the other hand, were utterly obliterated to the point where the only reason why they are devout Christians is because they were so heavily colonized and their culture wiped out, not because they elected to be. It's especially worth noting that Mexicans changed their language to Spanish primarily and that is their main identity, whereas Iranians did not stop speaking their native languages.  Although you are right that both countries got the short end of the stick in recent history."

The announcement reads: ""Persian"" has been used in a variety of publications including cultural, scientific and diplomatic documents for centuries and, therefore, it carries a very significant historical and cultural meaning. Hence, changing ""Persian"" to ""Farsi"" would negate this established important precedent.     Changing the usage from ""Persian"" to ""Farsi"" may give the impression that Farsi is a new language, although this may well be the intention of some users of ""Farsi"".     Changing the usage may also give the impression that Farsi is a dialect used in some parts of Iran rather than the predominant (and official) language of the country.     The word ""Farsi"" has never been used in any research paper or university document in any Western language, and the proposal to begin using it would create doubt and ambiguity about the name of the official language of Iran.

For some of them it was the first time in their life they had seen snow. So we're about to go inside and me and my friend stop and we start tarofing (in English).

He sold it to Irena (Inka) Bokiewicz, a young Polish refugee walking across the Elbruz mountains as she escaped from the Soviet Union. When he became too big she donated him to the Polish Army. As the bear was less than a year old, he initially had problems swallowing and was fed with condensed milk from an emptied vodka bottle. The bear was subsequently fed with fruit, marmalade, honey and syrup, and was often rewarded with beer, which became his favourite drink. He also enjoyed smoking and eating cigarettes.He enjoyed wrestling and was taught to salute when greeted. The bear became quite an attraction for soldiers and civilians alike, and soon became an unofficial mascot of all units stationed nearby. With the company he moved to Iraq and then through Syria, Palestine and Egypt.   mathieson72 in Travel & Events  13,852 views since Sep 2013   bot info"

If the submitters could just find article about these events which merely mention Iran I think that would be enough. For example, something like ""Two Iranians Die in Kuwait Bombing"", or ""Leader Slams Saudi Government For Supporting Kuwait Bomber"". Does the article about a food crisis in Iraq talk about Iran's role? Etc etc.  As for #5... well, maybe the book was done in the Persian style. (What do I know?)  I think if people just chose their submissions a little more carefully there's certainly room on this forum to discuss these things vis-a-vis Iran."
iran,3bske8,Persicum,5,Wed Jul 1 21:35:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the first part, events in the Shia world are at least tangentially relevant to Iran, but finding a source that specifically links it (like Iranian influence/casualties) would improve the quality of discussion in my opinion.  Number 5 has no place on this sub in my opinion, however. The post doesn't seem to be made for its cultural or artistic significance, it only appears to be a circlejerk against (Ottoman) Turks.

iran,3brt7z,IR-TR,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:59:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with you. I'm non-native speaker myself (or what we called ""non-heritage"" in school), and I'm not gonna say that my accent is perfect or anything, but after learning Farsi for a couple years I really began to notice that a lot of my Iranian-American friends had rather noticeable American accents. Of course everyone has an accent, so like other people are saying it's not such a bad thing. HOWEVER, I believe that people who have accents like the ones you see in the video are people who speak Farsi at the absolute bare minimum in their lives. Basically they speak English all day every day with their friends and family, and then occasionally they break into Farsi when either they have to or once in a while when they feel like it. Even when they do speak Farsi with their parents or siblings, it's probably more Finglish than standard Farsi.  When I speak Farsi I consciously change my voice, like intonation and everything. If you watch the video carefully where the reporter lady switches between English and Farsi, you'll notice she speaks both languages in the same voice. I think since learners like me are more conscious about the language being foreign to us, we try harder not to use our own native accents."
iran,3brt7z,marmulak,2,Thu Jul 2 07:49:08 2015 UTC,"Great that you've learned Farsi! Props! Very difficult to learn for non-natives I've heard. (I can't comment on how difficult a language is, except English) And I don't get why a second generation Iranian would NOT speak his native tongue with his parents. Why speak the 'new' language? Integration is fine, as I'm also integrated (no accent in Dutch what so ever). But when I'm home, I automatically speak my native languages, even though my parents speak Dutch as well (dad better than mom)."
iran,3brt7z,IR-TR,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:03:07 2015 UTC,"Well I think it's natural even when you're speaking that language with your parents for words from the environment to creep in. In Tajikistan, for example, people speak Persian at home, but eventually they ended up incorporating a ton of Russian words simply because they always encountered those things outside, just like Iranian Americans tend to use more English words in their speech than others.  But yeah, you gotta do what you can to keep the language alive. My grandparents spoke Polish, but they only spoke to my dad in English because Americans at that time believed that speaking a language other than English was backwards at best or treasonous at worst."
iran,3brt7z,marmulak,2,Thu Jul 2 16:55:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's sad. It's a large part of somebody's heritage and culture. Anyway, can't keep it alive for too long. It just takes too much effort.

In 1982, the North Korean authorities secretly invited an Iraqi delegation to Pyongyang, but the Iraqi government sent only an unofficial representative. The talks ended in fiasco, but the fact that they occurred at all revealed that North Korea was reluctant to support Iran’s ideological crusade against Saddam Hussein to the hilt. The Iranian leaders, on their part, decided to maintain diplomatic relations with both North and South Korea, no matter whether the DPRK liked it or not.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93North_Korea_relations"

By no means do I support a theocratic government but I certainly know that Iran's not a 1984-esque scenario like you're making it out to be. Sure, some of the religious authorities are corrupt and manipulative. So are many, many politicians in the U.S. and other countries. Power is a corruptive force.   Also, following translated news does not make you educated on the subject by any means. If you say you're not a screen-munching minion but trust in translated news sources for opinions, then that's not much of a defense. If you're truly interested in learning more about Iran beyond what the media says, then I'd suggest reading some of the books this subreddit supports rather than spouting off the same old one-liners that grow old when you (gasp!) read and think for yourself."

It failed its objectives and was just branded as a bigger warmongering state, (though it is debatable if that was deserved). Kyarushas were a part of their arsenal, not all of it, granted they were important in 2006, 9 years ago.  As for global firepower. That ranking is just silly, as it does not calculate missile power, which forms a vital core of Iran's armed forces.

Of course you won't because it undermines your initial point about Iran being a backwater. lol.

Iran hasn't invaded another country in over 220 years. Yours can't seem to stop its warmongering. So yeah your government, along with your savage warrior military culture is not only toxic to the civilians in the USA, but also the millions of victims of your armed forces' adventures.   both governments start conflict.

Iran hasn't started a war in 220 years, while the USA can't seem to stop starting them or poking its tentacles everywhere.

I found this to be the key passage:    Iranian officials told me that the theocracy debated countering Iraq with chemical weapons, but opted against it. However, aware that Baghdad had a nuclear-weapons program, Iran decided to resume the nuclear research-and-development program initiated by the Shah. After the war, Tehran decided to keep it. By 2013, when the world’s six major powers launched the current diplomatic initiative, Western intelligence estimated that the Islamic Republic had the capability to build a bomb within months.   This is despite all the horrific casualties Iran endured at the hands of Saddam and all the countries that supported him."

Iran had very few roads linking towns for commerce, it was technologically far behind Europe and India, it had a small population and virtually no economy other than Gilan's silk trade. I guess what defines a backwater is subjective, Safavids certainly was a high point for hundreds of years on either side of them."

So there is indeed a contradiction -- but again, it wasn't so long ago that you didn't mention pro-Israeli lobbying in polite company.  BUt that's over now, and that is a HUGE defeat for the lobby, because now they're exposed as just another special interest group that worse yet is acting to promote the interests of a foreign nation, by worse yet, pushing the US into a confrontation.

In fact HTTPS Everywhere bypasses most of the blocks, except a few where Iran actively does MITM attacks to block access to those websites.  These websites include twitter, facebook, youtube and some other social media sites.  Iran also blocks DNS queries to those websites (DNS is not encrypted by default) so people can't even resolve their addresses (DNSCrypt for example solves this issue)."
iran,3bi36x,2012DOOM,4,Mon Jun 29 17:15:24 2015 UTC,"On a strategic level I don't think blocking Wikipedia articles is authorities' highest priority now. they have an inherent level of hypocrisy with the partyline that they are on the side of ""facts"" and ""science"". and since Wikipedia is written by average people (and not elites that they hate), they couldn't call it an Israeli scheme. These days when you see any of the censorship officials going on the record you know that they will be talking about either Instagram or suggestive stickers on mobile apps. but one thing they most frown upon about Wikipedia is encyclopedias' neutral point of view which doesn't let them to put a term of grandeur at the end of religious figures names (for example all other encyclopedias I have seen does follow every mention of prophet Mohammad's name with a ""May Allah honour him and grant him peace"". )   (1) I remember it was a big deal seven or eight years ago. Back then internet censorship was more of sharp weapon reserved for really active opposition and really popular pornography. I think I even heard some people to claim a bragging right for their Wikipedia page being blocked. After 2009 they evolved(?) it into a banal and common thing that you assume if an article has the potential to mildly make the bosses uncomfortable it has to be blocked. I often encounter the argument held against some reformist figures (Sadegh Zibakalam and Reza Salehi Amiri, among others) that they are regime's spies and fifth columners in the opposition because their blogs and pages have not been blocked.  I wouldn't assume people in general would care if an article gets blocked. but I guess it makes a difference in the quality of the article, since most wikipedians wouldn't like to spend their time editing a blocked article.  (2) everybody can get around the block (Facebook is blocked and almost everybody's on it). The real effect of government censorship is not making a page inaccessible, but making it relatively harder. VPN and proxies reduce the already slow internet connections and most people (I assume) wouldn't see it worthwhile to wait for a minute or two to read something that their self-appointed guardians did not see fitting. also authorities would turn internet into a super slow snail connection when they start an arrest campaign or a riot breaks out and people want to go online and get informed.  but at the end it's a matter of convenience, boldness and motivation. accessing a blocked article on Wikipedia is not the hardest challenge we face (how much I do hope it was) . If someone wants to read a certain Wikipedia article they will do it, remember the most visited articles on Persian Wikipedia are blocked article with sex-related content.  keep up the good work :)"

People probably notice, but remember that most Iranians use Persian, not English Wikipedia. The articles that are blocked in English Wikipedia in Iran might not exist in Persian Wikipedia. And if they are blocked, it is likely that an Iranian who has never left Iran wouldn't know the article existed at all.  (2) Does anybody make an effort to get around this block? Do people try and help others? I'm really hoping to hear from anybody who does.  Yes, I may or may not have at some time in the past or currently circumvented the blocks using software like Tor. I would only do this because I am aware certain articles exist and are blocked. Iranians do help each other use VPNs and other private networks to avoid government censorship."

iran,3bi36x,koodak,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:50:57 2015 UTC,"Annenberg CGCS Study: Iran Censors Wikipedia  Date:  11 Nov 2013 Iran Censors Wikipedia: Targeting Politics, Religion, and Sexuality  New Report Reveals That 963 Wikipedia Pages Are Blocked in Iran   Philadelphia, PA – Iran censors hundreds of Persian Wikipedia pages according to a new report released today by the Iran Media Program at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School for Communication and the Human Rights in Iran Unit at the City University of New York’s Brooklyn College. In the report, “Citation Filtered: Iran’s Censorship of Wikipedia” researchers scanned 800,000 Persian language Wikipedia articles to determine what pages and topics were deemed inappropriate by the Islamic Republic of Iran.  In total, Iranian authorities blocked 963 pages, including articles about the BBC, the minority Bahá'í faith, Harry Potter actress Emma Watson, and state repression of protests following Iran’s 2009 presidential election.  “Censorship of Wikipedia mirrors Iran’s wider attack on Internet freedom,” said Collin Anderson, one of the report’s authors. “  “If you’re Iranian and are searching Wikipedia for info on the BCC, torture, or even your ex president, Mohammad Khatami, you can forget it,” Anderson added.  The top three most censored topics were civil and political, sex and sexuality, and religion. Nearly all of the censored Wikipedia pages contain speech that is protected by international law, which guarantees citizens’ freedom of expression and access to information.  According to the report, 53% of the blocked Wiki-pages are biographies. Of the 511 blocked biography pages, 161 were of individuals who have been allegedly detained by Iranian officials and another 108 account for individuals who are suspected to have been killed by authorities.  “The Iranian government is restricting access to pages about human rights advocates such as Shirin Ebadi. But what was surprising was the pages of Harry Potter star Emma Watson, singer Cheryl Cole and actress Kristen Stewart were also blocked in Iran,” Anderson noted.  Keyword and manual filtering blocked 31 Wikipedia articles on sexual health and bodily functions, all of which were represented in a scientific or public health manner. This form of over censorship has led authorities to seemingly ban content that they likely have no objection to such as articles related to health or anatomy. Similarly, an article on the Bikini Atoll coral reef in the Marshall Islands is blocked because it coincidentally contains filtered character patterns.  The report shows that of the 51 articles blocked related to media and journalists, four entries were about media outlets such as BBC Persia and four were about social media platforms including Facebook. The study notes that in nearly every instance, the actual website of these outlets featured on the filtered Wiki-page was itself also filtered.    Persian Wikipedia is one of the most popular Wikis, ranking 16th in the world.   The complete study, examining the extent of internet censorship in Iran, is available here."
iran,3bi36x,SyntheticValkyrur,3,Mon Jun 29 13:38:45 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, but I'm wondering how people feel about the Wikipedia censorship and whether it has an impact on people's daily lives. Having asked on the Chinese subreddit, it appears that not only is the western news rather behind on what is and isn't available to users, but most ordinary citizens aren't that perturbed by the censorship. It's very interesting to learn!"

iran,3bi36x,irawn,2,Mon Jun 29 21:17:25 2015 UTC,"Well Iranians have been living with censorship for many many years and so they are used to finding ways to get around it.   Before the Internet, they would listen to foreign radios. Now they take advantage of the Internet and also watch news and programs on satellites to figure out what is being censored and to get a complete picture of the truth.   This of course can backfire when certain media channels produce specific content in Persian that serves as propaganda. But I think many Iranians follow the news with a grain of salt and try to verify the accuracy of content by listening to various sources."

Sadeh celebrates 50 days before Nowruz. Sadeh in Persian means ""hundred"" and refers to one hundred days and nights past the end of summer (or the beginning of long-winter known to start at the end of summer in ancient Persia/Iran). Sadeh is a mid winter festival that was celebrated with grandeur and magnificence in ancient Persia.  It was a festivity to honor fire and to defeat the forces of darkness, frost, and cold.

iran,3bdyki,rr2999,12,Sun Jun 28 08:55:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not Iranian but I guess I can explain this in the context of Muslim/Sufi poetry inspired by Farsi that is popular in Pakistan.  When Persian-based or inspired works reference alcohol, its usually to the intoxication. The drunken stupor that leads to a spiritual connection of a higher level with God, or the kind of high achieved when in love, or the low generated by grief.  Mostly they prefer to press upon the various states of the human condition; conditions which alcohol easily replicate."
iran,3bdyki,IzmailPirzada,2,Sun Jun 28 09:32:40 2015 UTC,"Partly true. The idea of escapism is mostly what Iranian youths go for.   Escapism is the idea that ""Drink your problems away"" comes from. Iranian youth are struggling through financial debts from university, a dark tunnel ahead because of the saturation of good jobs in the market such as engineering and medicine, sanctions and limited social freedoms."

iran,3bdyki,Sadeghi85,2,Sun Jun 28 20:39:53 2015 UTC,Persian poetry is full of metaphors(استعاره).
iran,3bdyki,marmulak,4,Mon Jun 29 06:23:05 2015 UTC,"Because drunkenness is being used to refer to an emotional or spiritual state. Sometimes it's a reference to literal drinking, but not in real life--only imaginary. For example, someone who drinks out of depression/misery."
iran,3bdyki,jdw1066,2,Sun Jun 28 19:49:11 2015 UTC,"Within the context of Persian poetry, the poems of medieval Sufis and Hafez are literally all about being drunk and having intimated relations with a (sometimes male) Beloved. In traditional Sufi interpretations, wine represents the elixir of divine love that allows the poet to, through intoxication, get closer to the beloved (God). Although the wine is haraam, it represents something religious for the Sufis. This image I guess continues to be very prevalent in modern Persian song and poetry too."

iran,3bcemm,derintellectual,2,Sun Jun 28 00:03:25 2015 UTC,"I personally think that foreigners that physically resemble Iranians will blend in and therefore not get noticed so strangers will possibly not approach and fuss over them. I don't know what type of Indian you are, but people in northern India may resemble Iranians. Also applies to Turks, Arabs, etc.  I enjoy reading travel blogs (often from bloggers that have visited Iran) and it's not just white tourists that say Iranians are hospitable. Blacks and East Asians (lots of people from Singapore and Hong Kong visit Iran for some reason) say the same thing.  Examples of hospitality from strangers include people approaching tourists on the street and inviting them to have dinner at their house (this seems to be common based on what I've read). They're being approached by strangers because it's obvious they're foreign. I'm not sure if tourists from certain countries (India, Turkey, etc) will stick out in the way tourists from Europe, USA or Singapore do, so they'll possibly receive less attention on the streets."

iran,3b9yav,ShinyShinx,17,Sat Jun 27 04:54:21 2015 UTC,"Alright, so for the majority stance WITHIN Iran. Essentially thanks to state TV propaganda kurds are seen as hard ass gurillea mountain fighters who fought against le middle-sized Satan Saddam Hussein with bravery and valor. That is the image of Iraqi Kurds.   Because Kurds and Persians are essentially brother ethnicities they are viewed very positively here (Persian speakers can nominally understand Kurdish too) , they are essentially seen as an extension of us.   Kurdistan is a tricky word, it's the name of the Kurdish province in Iran, but it also functions as the name of the Kurdish state (who also have different parties vying for power) If your talking about the Kurdistan province within Iran it's viewed very positively. If your talking about the state the KRG (Iraqi Kurds)  Kurdistan it's also viewed positively. If your talking abut the Turkish Kurds it's viewed very negatively. The PKK were a terrorist organization who also attacked Iran through their proxy the PJAK. Even Iranian Kurds hate them. If your talking about the Syrian Kurds, well nobody really knows about them so I can't talk on people's general opinions there.  Their claim of a unified Kurdish state within Turkey, Syria, and Iraq is fine, those Kurds do actually want to seperate. But the moment those three try to bring that to Iran we have a serious problem. Iranian Kurds aren't hot on the idea of seperating (there are a small number who are though). But those three are, they tried it in the 80's and it failed miserably because Iranian Kurds didn't want it and neither did the state. A lot of bloodshed did happen though. Kurds are literally an Iranic ethnicity, their language is so similar to ours, their customs, culture, and religion are the same as ours. Kurdistan province has been apart of Iran for hundereds of years. And it's always been like this. And we don't intend to see it change because some foreigners want muh Kurdish unity, what unity!? Where was this unity when Turkish Kurds were gunning down Iranian Kurds like Daesh(ISIS) did in Kobane just 2 days ago? Where was that unity when Turkish Kurds began killing Kurdish Iranian policemen and conscripts in order to get a violent reaction from the state!?   Iran was and still is the largest backer of the KRG (the largest, best equipped and most realistic govering body of Kurdistan). It sends then plane loads of cash, guns, artillery, munitions, Iranian heavy armor support. And I guess the Iraqi Kurds on the ground are very greatful for that. However the the way the expat community reacts is disgusting. Instead of being happy they moan and bitch about why Israel isn't sending weapons. Who the fuck is Israel even in all of this? They're so busy giving Israel a blowjob on the internet that they start to invent ""Israeli help to the Kurds"" in their minds. During he protests in Mahbad they spun it into a Kurdish v Persian stateissue when the same protests would have happened in any other city.  When Hassan Rohani asked for troops to stand down Twitter expat Kurds began moaning and bitching about tanks rolling into Kurdistan killing 300 million innocent kurds people were pulling news out of their ass to incite more violence left and right, it was disgusting and you should have seen it. To be clear, THIS IS ONLY THE KURDISH EXPAT COMMUNITY.  Actuall Kurds couldn't give less of a shit about a state which hasn't done anything for them. Actuall Kurds in Iraq didn't really give a shit about the protests in Mahbad because it didn't concern to them in any fashion.   Another issue is that Turkish Kurds face a lot of discrimination in Turkey. Discrimination that Iranian Kurds don't face and haven't for decades. They think the IRI treats Kurds like the like the Turks treat them and they go ballistic over it.   I still support the Kurdish cause and many of us do, but we would prefer it a whole lot more if the genuine Kurdish community game forth and showed their gratitude instead of  all these expats hating on Iran and giving internet blowjobs to Israel."

Kurds will never get a country under Iran. It's too nationalistic, and Iranians will never accept them as being special becuase Iran has been fractured from it's original domain many times throughout history and won't allow it again. Also, if Kurds get their own country, then the middle-east, southwest asia, west asia, central asia, and south asia will all get divided as well."

They're given a god-like status in the media as if they can or never have done wrong. This is mostly becuase it works in the favor of western countries to fracture the middle east more, and to make kurds into their pawns. It's pretty sad how stupid they are. The past atrocities kurds have committed aside, they're pretty selfish as well, with the massive land grabs in Iraq and Syria in addition to ethnic cleansing of the cities amid the recent chaos.   Even then, I'd have been willing to turn a blind eye, as Kurds are brotherly to Persians in almost every sense. However, I've been left with a bitter taste in my mouth courtesy of the Kurdish expat community. These dirty animals strongly dislike Iranians and try to incite animosity among Kurdish-Iranian youth and within Iranian cities. Just recently there was a protest in Mahabad regarding a woman who jumped off a hotel balcony. Kurds, and Kurdish media outlets went wild, trying to push a narrative of 'revolution' happening in Iran against the 'oppressors'. Quite laughable.  tl;dr- if kurds ever attempted to develop a state within Iranian territory, I'd fully advocate dropping every missile we have and to carpet bomb whatever pathetic excuse of an autonomous state they have. : )"

(In fact, ""Kurd"" is the general label Arabs had applied to the different Iranian tribes in the area.) So in a sense they're the most Arabized Iranians in existence."

They had as little to do with each other as they did with any of the other iranian tribes in North West Iran. The Kurdish languages developed independently and now they talk about a singular Kurdish language with varying dialects, which is wrong. Now it's considered a singular ethnicity, which is a recent social construction. I'm not against a Kurdish nation formed. But these Kurdish diaspora talking about 40 million kurds split by four countries that should be one are being very disingenuous.

iran,3b9yav,rezsahin,0,Sun Jun 28 11:56:24 2015 UTC,"I support a Kurdish state, but that is just my personal opinion. Kurds are an Iranian people, so I support the emergence of a new Iranian state in the middle east to counterbalance Arab and Turkish influence. The Iranian government does ally itself with the Kurdish cause in Iraq, but, like the US, advises the Kurds there not to seek full independence for fear of further destabilizing the region. However, it's glaringly obvious that the Kurds are important regional allies in spite of their cowardly overtures with Israel. Iranian peoples must stick together and support each other.  I'd have no problem with Iran donating land to an independent Kurdistan if (and only if) Kurdish land were also taken from Turkey. The Kurdish region of Iran is rather small, but a large portion of Turkey is Kurdish, and the Turks don't deserve this land whatsoever. So it would be a good move to destabilize Turkey, although Turkey also is an important future ally for Iran. That's why, as you can see, they're not keen on rocking the boat."
iran,3b9yav,Nmathmaster123,14,Sat Jun 27 14:09:29 2015 UTC,"the emergence of a new Iranian state in the middle east to counterbalance Arab and Turkish influence . . . it's glaringly obvious that the Kurds are important regional allies in spite of their cowardly overtures with Israel.    If only this were the case. However, both history and current reality show that the shift will be in favor of Israel and the West rather than Iran. Consider how R. Azerbaijan and Afghanistan -- two countries with significant Iranian heritage -- act against Iran and Iranian interests, with R. Azerbaijan essentially being an Israeli outpost.   In this respect, maintaining the territorial integrity of Iran's neighbors -- Iraq, Syria, and Turkey (all of which compete against Israel's influence)  -- would benefit Iran more than any romantic ideals of establishing another subservient ""Iranian"" state. Not to mention that similar to R. Azerbaijan, an independent Kurdistan born out of diaspora and foreign meddling would most likely end up denying their Iranian heritage while at the same time claiming Iranian (not Arab or Turkish) elements. This would be a brazen and directed attack on Iranian nationhood and identity, and would destabilize Iran far more than any loss of land or population."
iran,3b9yav,rezsahin,3,Sat Jun 27 15:08:27 2015 UTC,"For that Reason I think its important for Iran to take the initiative and make sure the new kurdish state is an Iranian ally as it should be. for some ridiculous reason azarbaijan got hung up on the fact we were an IR, hopefully the KRG wont care (likely since they're sunni and they're less concerend of disgruntled shias than azarbaijan).   I see what you mean though, but in your opinion is it enough to protect our interests in kurdistan by blocking expat/foreign meddeling or would it be better to preserve the territorial integrity of our neighbors? As it is the people of Iranian Kurdistan (which will always remain Iranian) are fully aware of their history and identity."
iran,3b9yav,marmulak,4,Sat Jun 27 15:25:20 2015 UTC,"for some ridiculous reason Azarbaijan got hung up on the fact we were an IR, hopefully the KRG won't care (likely since they're Sunni and they're less concerend of disgruntled shias than Azerbaijan).    The Republic of Azerbaijan, which itself is overwhelmingly Shia, should not have had any problems with a Shia government offering them an alliance. The main motivation behind their animosity towards Iran comes from their desire to maintain a competitive edge in the hydrocarbon industry by stealing Iran's share of natural gas from the Caspian Sea, more so than any ideological barriers. Instead they turned to Turkey, their primary import partner, and Israel, an important export partner, to maintain their illicit hold on Iranian territory and resources. Allying with Iran in this set up would be like partnering with the shopkeeper while your intentions are to sell the goods you've stolen from him.   The KRG, being an oil exporter as well, would most likely behave the same way. In the end, greed over natural resources and profit would override any Iranian link. Their desire to link Iraqi Kurdistan with Turkish Kurdistan is explained by this pipeline route, and I guarantee it's Iranian Kurdistan's isolation from this network that's keeping it out of the spotlight.   but in your opinion is it enough to protect our interests in Kurdistan by blocking expat/foreign meddling or would it be better to preserve the territorial integrity of our neighbors?   Why not both? If anything, doing one of those things would help the other."

I was under the impression it was becuase azarbaijan was getting angsty thinking Iran would export the revolutution to Azarbaijan. A frigate was recently comissioned to the Caspian sea a few years ago, its one of the IRN's top combat ships, at first I was puzzled by the move but now it seems clear as to why it was done."
iran,3b9yav,marmulak,5,Sat Jun 27 16:15:42 2015 UTC,"Iran would export the revolutution to Azerbaijan   That's just a superficial reason used in political rhetoric. Like all interactions, the underlying motivations carry a dollar sign.    Also how large is the encroachment on Iranian territorial sovereignty with Azerbaijan?    There have been some improvements in Iran's relationship with Azerbaijan since 2014, however the main source of contention and distrust arose from how the Caspian Sea is partioned. During the time of the USSR, the Caspian Sea was essentially divided 50-50, with Iran having access to the Shah Deniz and Turkmenistan's oil/natural gas fields.   With the fall of the USSR and the new, Western-backed littoral states that arose, this agreement was deliberately changed to the disadvantage of Iran: partitioning the Caspian Sea according to coast lines rather than even divides which would give everyone 1/5th of the share. Now, Iran has the smallest share thanks to Azerbaijan."
iran,3b9yav,LewHen,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:39:24 2015 UTC,"The IR bit is probably the single biggest roadblock to regional cooperation and integration of the Iranian states.

It would smooth over a lot of the tensions going on between states like Azerbaijan, Israel, and even future Kurdistan. So long as Iran stays a Shia theocracy, it can have reasonably polite relations with its neighbors, but won't really inspire them to join together as one."
iran,3b9yav,marmulak,6,Sat Jun 27 16:15:40 2015 UTC,"Its not the problem with us, both Azarbaijan and tajikstan are secular dictatorships, Afghanistan is only lukewarm because we havent been able to invest enough.

The main character, Marjan, has a similar experience and worldview as many other Iranians who have left the country following the Revolution. Thus, it's often treated as a story that portrays the ""Iranian experience"" and the associated sentiments more intimately than any political or academic source.  However, Persepolis does contain its own biases and inaccuracies as well, which is why it is at best an entertaining introduction to a highly complex and nuanced topic.

Quite honestly, I'm having a bit of a hard time coming up with questions - I mean, there are a lot I'd like to ask, but I don't really want to touch upon things I think may be sensitive. I'll just ask about a few small things, we'll see where we go from there.   what is that symbol replacing the notifications envelope next to my nick up on the status bar? what does it say next to the total number of subscribers? I noticed the flair for Poland says ""Lahestan"" (or Lechistan, as we would say), which I found funny as it refers to the Golden Age of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth; how is that name received in Iran - humorous? pejorative? normal and what you actually usually use? how are tourists (particularly from Poland) viewed and received? One of my acquaintances (female) who travelled a lot around many places in Asia and a little bit around the Middle East went there a couple of years ago (4? 5?) and she said they visited Iran but they didn't really feel very welcome there and as a result of feeling bad (she didn't go into too many details but she said they were being followed everywhere they went, observed, etc.) they decided to cut their stay short and went back to Turkey for the rest of their trip. how do Iranians view the Arab countries around the ME? Russia? Turkey? Afghanistan? what is something you are proud of in your country that the West doesn't have and you'd like them to know/have?"
iran,3b78xv,rezsahin,8,Fri Jun 26 18:32:24 2015 UTC,"The logo that replaces the envelope is the Homa bird, a creature from Iranian mythology. It's used as the logo for Iran Air, as well. It transliterates to ""Iran dūst"" which means ""Iranophile"" or ""friend of Iran."" Basically anyone who has a certain affinity for or interest in Iran is called an ""Iran dūst."" Indeed, Poland in Persian is ""Lahestan"" referring to the Lechites. The Armenian language also refers to Poland similarly. Tourists in general are usually received well, but it's not uncommon to hear of experiences like that either. Generally, most tourists give positive reports and Eastern-European (including Polish) tourists are not given much trouble. There is a geopolitical rivalry with Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar which contributes to some negative feelings. Oman is regarded fairly positively by Iranians for its continual neutrality. A number of Iranians are neutral towards Russia, or view it as a better alternative than the West, but many others see it as yet another foreign power looking to exploit Iran (as it has many times in the past). Turkey is a popular vacation spot for many Iranians. Some Iranians care about Afghanistan and view them as fellow Iranian people, others look down on them and view them negatively.  Good question. I would say Iran's greatest feature is its language, which has been fairly unchanged for the past 1000 years. Many Iranian poets and writers from centuries ago are still completely intelligible, and in my opinion, this level of cultural continuity is quite valuable.   Edit: Minor fixes."
iran,3b78xv,QueLogico,5,Fri Jun 26 19:06:56 2015 UTC,"I don't really want to touch upon things I think may be sensitive.   Do eet! :-)   what does it say next to the total number of subscribers?   ""Irandust"", that is, ""Iranophiles"".   how are tourists (particularly from Poland) viewed and received?   I don't know about the Polish part, but incredibly well, in my experience.  Almost to a fault.  Iranians are very self-conscious about the reputation their country has abroad and are usually desperate to show foreigners how hospitable they can be.  I'm quite surprised to hear about your friend's experience, since I've never heard of anything like that in Iran before.  Admittedly, I am male, but I travelled in Iran with my mother, my sister and a female friend.  We had no problems at all and were very much welcomed everywhere we went.   how do Iranians view the Arab countries around the ME?   There's nothing Iranians hate more than being compared to Arabs.  Relations with Arabs are mixed.  Better with Iraqis, Syrians and Lebanese, worse with Saudis (to put it mildly).   Russia?   I believe they have a friendship of convenience.  I don't think there's a lot of mutual trust.  There is certainly some, from joint governmental projects etc, but Russia has treated Iran badly before, including invasion, military occupation and annexation of territory.   Turkey?   Iran's closest economic partner with very interconnected histories.  Still not that close though; it's a tough neighbourhood.   Afghanistan?   There are a lot of Afghans in Iran (one of the largest refugee populations in the world, I believe), but they're not always treated well and usually work in construction or other manual labour jobs.  Afghanistan and Iran were the same country for a lot of history, but are somewhat divided by religion these days.

I'm gonna add to what you've said:   ""Lahestan"" is just how Poland is pronounced in Iran.

The -stan suffix is Persian, so the name ""Lechistan"" would have been somehow borrowed by Poles through Persian. I think the native Polish version is ""Lechia"", correct?  In the past Polish nationalists also used to poetically refer to Poland as Sarmatia (Sarmacja). At the Ferdowsi shrine in Iran there is a Polish medallion gifted to Iran from the second world war by Polish soldiers. It's set in a frame that refers to Poland as Sarmatia. I have a photo of it somewhere that I've posted previously on this sub."
iran,3b78xv,AThousandD,8,Fri Jun 26 20:18:06 2015 UTC,"Well, considering our history of wars/truces with the Ottomans and the Tartars, there are many words which have been imported into our language from, among others, your area.  Then, there was the fascination with the East, eastern culture during the Commonwealth - landowner nobles, szlachta, were fascinated with everything that had something to do with the East. Hence, the name Sarmacja - the nobles called themselves ""Sarmaci"" , claiming (to the best of my admittedly limited knowledge) rather fallaciously that Poles originated in those lands. Lehestan, or Lechistan, comes from the legend of Lech, Czech and Rus, the three legendary brothers who've founded the three Slavic peoples. Ottomans would call us ""Lach"" in our language - there's even an idiom ""Strachy na Lachy"", meaning someone is trying to scare you, but there's no reason to be afraid.  This fascination was also evident in the fashions, which were somewhat imported from the Ottomans. These included: żupan (pron. ~""ZHOU-pan""), kontusz (pron. ~""KHON-tush""), the scimitar, or szabla (pron. ~""SHAB-lah""), which became an integral part of a noble's identity.  Another example, during German occupation in WWII, was KeDyw (Kierownictwo Dywersji, Directorate for Subversion), which was meant to sound like Khedive.  When I was in high school all those years ago, I was also taught that the word hetman was supposed to be of Turkish origin as well, but looking at the English and Polish article right now, the etymology section notes German connotations. Is there any similar word in Farsi? Hetman? Getman?  Okay, I think that's everything I can think of at the moment."
iran,3b78xv,rezsahin,3,Fri Jun 26 21:59:16 2015 UTC,"The legend of those three brothers was fascinating and it reminds me of our own story of Salm, Tur, and Iraj, which tells of King Fereydun dividing the world by giving Salm the West, Central Asia to Tur, and Iran to Iraj."

iran,3b78xv,marmulak,2,Sat Jun 27 00:24:24 2015 UTC,"There was definitely contact and cultural cross-pollination between groups of Europeans and Iranians. The Slavs did have contact with Iranians, as did the Celts and stuff. Comparison of their folklore has revealed some similarities that are probably not coincidental.  Also some Poles may actually have Sarmatian ancestry, but from what I read, any Iranians that may have settled in Poland would have assimilated completely. They didn't have a big impact on the genetic composition of Poles."

It's not as widespread as somewhere like France/Netherlands, but it does exist.  It just depends on how liberal the people in question are. In the big cities, most youth have some basic grasp of the language.  In the more rural towns/the elder generations not so much.  Overall, I would say 10-15% It depends on the war.

iran,3b0k8p,AyaletSheked,8,Thu Jun 25 00:18:11 2015 UTC,"I live in Tajikistan and have met lots of Pamiri speakers here. They are really nice people, and they put more effort into educating their children than Tajiks. They are mainly found in the Badakhsahn region in Tajikistan, which is semi-autonomous and whose capital is Khorugh. Pamiris are mostly Nizari Ismailis who follow the Agha Khan. The Agha Khan uses his wealth to invest in Tajikistan and aid in development, especially in Badakhshan, which I think is the poorest region of the country anyway.  There are several Pamiri languages, but the main one was Shughni. One of my English students was helping me to learn Shughni. It's a really cool sounding language, and there is lots of overlap with Tajik. A good portion of Pamiri is simply Persian words/phrases adapted to their own phonology. This is because they've been bilingual in Persian for centuries. They're also among the most Russianized segments of society, so their vocabulary is further corrupted by Russian. Even so, their language is in better shape than Yaghnobi.  I watched the whole video, and the old lady in the beginning speaks the most Pamiri, and the second lady speaks a heavily Persianized register to the point where I could almost understand everything she was saying. The girl they interview third also speaks a lot of Tajik. My Shughni sucks, but here are some key words you can hear in the video:  *xhats = water shito = cold mo nüm = my name kinum = I do (equivalent to ""konam"") kinam = We do (equivalent to ""konim"")  * ""xh"" is a consonant that sounds almost like a combination of ""kh"" and ""sh"". It's like a light ""kh"" that's heavily aspirated, meaning it has a lot of air. When I first started learning Shughni I used to mistake this sound for ""sh"" a lot.  Another word they use several times is ""kasal"", which in Tajik means ""sick"" (kasal shodan = mariz shodan). My wife says this word is known in Iranian Persian as well, but is pronounced ""kesel"" (کسل). Google translate says it means weary/sickish/woozy.  Bonus edit: I believe the recitation in the intermissions is a Pamiri lullaby, although I'm not 100% if it is what I think it is. There is a song by the deceased Pamiri singer, Nargis Bandishoeva that I think matches it, which you can listen to here: Наргис Бандишоева - Lalaik  Here is a song of hers in Persian that received a lot of attention on /r/Tajiksitan since we transcribed the lyrics and also posted about it on /r/iran: Nargisa Bandishoeva - Dar In Shab Mastum"
iran,3b0k8p,marmulak,2,Thu Jun 25 16:47:11 2015 UTC,"Nizari Ismailis tend to place a lot of emphasis on modern education compared to mainstream Muslims. Just curious, what is the socioeconomic level of Pamiris compared to Sunni Tajiks and Uzbeks? Is there any difference?"
iran,3b0k8p,ashbourne10,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:15:28 2015 UTC,"I heard Uzbeks have a pretty strong presence in the Tajik bazaar. They probably do OK in that respect. Ethnic Tajiks probably have an edge when it comes to opportunities since they control the government, although the majority of people in the country live in poverty regardless of ethnicity. Badakhshan is a poor region, but the Ismailis are super organized and working to improve it."
iran,3b0k8p,marmulak,2,Thu Jun 25 21:16:08 2015 UTC,"So the higher rate of education among Pamiris has not yet yielded any results for them or set them above the rest of society? What about the Russian community?  This is a bit of a crude question, but do you think Pamiris are physically more attractive than Tajiks and Uzbeks? I haven't met any but the photos of Pamiris uploaded onto Flickr by western travellers kind of portray them as more handsome than the Tajiks and Uzbeks. Has this been your experience too?"
iran,3b0k8p,ashbourne10,2,Thu Jun 25 21:31:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know if there's a clear distinction among social status locally in Tajikistan. Most of the Pamirs I met in Dushanbe seem to have equal social status to others in the city, although I don't doubt that all the ones who become educated move to Europe or North America, including Russia. They probably intermarry too and just integrate with the society. People who stay in Tajikistan generally struggle for a living. I've seen Pamirs here working in education, banking, and also industries like arts and local handcrafts. They basically force their kids to learn Russian and English.  There doesn't seem to be much of a Russian community here. I rarely see ethnic Russians in Tajikistan, although in Dushanbe they are here as soldiers, and I've also seen Russains working as managers at small hotels in Khujand.  Pamiris are more of pure Aryan blood due to their isolation in the mountainous regions. Therefore they have more Caucasian features as well as a higher occurrence of blond hair and colored eyes. Tajiks are generally Caucasian, but many have Mongoloid features because of genetic infiltration by evil nitwits Uzbekistan with their Chingiz ancestry. All are beautiful, though."
iran,3b0k8p,marmulak,3,Thu Jun 25 21:38:45 2015 UTC,"genetic infiltration by evil nitwits Uzbekistan with their Chingiz ancestry    Uzbekistan was created in 1924 by russian communists. Later they created Tajikistan as well. I don't think soviet Uzbekistan had enough time for ""genetic infiltration"". The local ethnic groups in this region have been mixing with each other and with ethnic groups that invaded the region for thousands of years. Uzbeks and Tajiks are artificial nations, not ethnicities. There are many ethnicities that comprise these nations. Some are mixed more or less, some are distinct in a way. Sometimes you will find similar people by their looks, who will speak a different language (one may speak Uzbek, the other one Tajik, the third will come from Khorazm and speak Turkmen), even have a different culture."

There's a number of Iranian restaurants in Dushanbe, which seem to be run by expats. (I've only been to one, but that was the case.)  It's hard to see how Iranians would like living here more than living in Iran. On one hand, alcohol is legal, but on the other hand, polygamy is outlawed. The economy here is ailing, so there's no glamour, and as we all know Iranians are attracted to wealth and superficiality, which makes Dubai very attractive to them. Here you're basically forced to learn Russian, and you get cut off from much of the cultural comforts that Iran provides.

iran,3b0k8p,LewHen,2,Fri Jun 26 02:03:40 2015 UTC,"Well my evidence is just anecdotal, but because Pamirs are a minority they have some animosity towards Tajiks. During Soviet times, Russian rule helped them thrive better as an oppressed minority. It sounds kind of mean, but I think Pamirs understand that they can get ahead in life by sucking up to Russians and (now) Europeans as much as possible. Like in Tajikistan all the ethnic Pamirs I met knew Russian better than Persian, and all their businesses and organizations are run entirely in Russian or maybe sometimes English. Their complete disregard for Persian is actually rather offensive to me, but it's understandable because of the problems they've had with ethnic Tajiks. There are some Pamir ladies where I work who don't know English, so I can only speak Persian with them. They only speak to everyone in Russian, and with one especially when I tell her something in Persian she has only like a 50% chance of understanding. This year when it was Nowruz, she didn't even know what Nowruz was when I congratulated her. This means she watches Russian TV only. On the other hand, my student (the one who teaches me Pamiri), knows Tajik very well, and subsequently I think his Pamiri is better too."

However, a lot of Tajiks move to Europe or the US once they get educated.

Son of Tolui and the Kerait princess Sorghaghtani Beki, he was a grandson of Genghis Khan and brother of Ariq Böke, Möngke Khan, and Kublai Khan.  Hulagu's army greatly expanded the southwestern portion of the Mongol Empire, founding the Ilkhanate of Persia, a precursor to the eventual Safavid dynasty, and then the modern state of Iran. Under Hulagu's leadership, the Mongols destroyed the greatest center of Islamic power, Baghdad, and also weakened Damascus, causing a shift of Islamic influence to the Mamluks in Cairo. Under Hulagu's dynasty, Iranian historians began writing in Persian rather than Arabic.

iran,3ayxhx,Lord_of_Persia,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:56:09 2015 UTC,"The shahnameh is by far the hardest work to read in Persian if you read the actual script.

And I only mean in the Persian language, I have no idea how difficult or easy the translations are."
iran,3ayxhx,IranRPCV,3,Thu Jun 25 12:56:34 2015 UTC,"I approached these poets as a native English speaker, and was learning the vocabulary in any case.  The stories in the Shahnameh are mostly straight forward story telling.  Rumi is often symbolic and the meaning is understood on multiple levels.  If you don't know the symbolism, which those of us from other cultures don't at first, Rumi can't bee cracked by just looking up the meaning of the individual words."
iran,3ayxhx,Lord_of_Persia,2,Thu Jun 25 16:47:31 2015 UTC,"Ah I see what you mean. In terms of story-telling Rumi's works can be a bit confusing I'd you're not familiar with the cultural symbolism that a lot of Iranian-borns are familiar with. The shahnameh reads a lot like a fantasy epic, like Homer's works, but if you attempt to read it in Persian as a Persian speaker you will have a hell of a time. Nevertheless they are both remarkable works of art in my opinion."
iran,3ayxhx,IranRPCV,2,Fri Jun 26 03:41:07 2015 UTC,"That is it, exactly.  Another thing I have noticed is that people approaching Persian poetry in English will often have a different appreciation for a particular poet due to the quality of the English translation.

I am going to give you examples written in farsi and English so you will understand it better.  1- literally means 'what' but specifically in this way:  Example:  آنچه گفته شد صحیح است  meaning:  ""What was said is correct."" or ""That thing that was said is correct.""  2- Normally used to mean ""the fact that..."" or ""this that""! Confusing, I know.  Example:   اینکه بخواهید او را اجبار کنید، صحیح نیست  meaning:  It is not ok to force him/her.  3- ""Compared to"" or ""in comparison to""   Example:   تابستان نسبت به زمستان گرم تر است  Meaning:  Summer is hotter compared to Winter.  4- yes.  Example:  می خواهم راجع به آب و هوا صحبت کنم  ""I want to talk about the weather."""

It's used when linking independent clauses, the most common example being, ""barâye inke"", which, if I were to attempt to translate literally, would be something like, ""Because of this: that [independent clause]."" Basically ""inke"" sets the stage for a complete sentence to follow, with its own subject and verb. For example, ""Behet kâdu dâdam be xâtere inke emruz tavalodete,"" should be translated: ""I gave you a present because today is your birthday."" /u/saumuribiz's translation ""the fact that"" is a pretty good one.

iran,3arqsd,trickface,4,Wed Jun 24 01:03:34 2015 UTC,"I was happy we only had to wear a chador when we visited a shrine.  I can't imagine negotiating everyday tasks wearing one. In Shiraz we went to the Shah Cheragh Mosque and took chadors from a bin at the door.  A guide quickly rushed over and told us that those were not for us.  She handed us new chadors in plastic bags.  When I opened mine, I laughed because the chador had a hood which tied under the chin. A tourist chador!  I was relieved that I would not have to struggle one-handed to get my shoes on and off.  I also noticed that our chadors were a different color which probably made it easier for our guide to find us in a sea of ""tents."""
iran,3arqsd,JustALittleSexyPush,4,Wed Jun 24 01:20:56 2015 UTC,"Yes. Handling a chador is hard. You can regularly see chadori women holding their chador with their teeth while their both hands are busy. Not sure how to feel about that. Luckily, not wearing a chador is somewhat accepted in Iran."

You haven't stated who 'they' are, or what timeframe you're talking about, but if what you're trying to say is that all peoples living in contemporary Egypt, Jordan, Syrian, and the Maghreb before the Islamic conquest were Semitic peoples, and that they practiced 'rituals' then you don't know what you are talking about.

There was also a hollywood movie produced a while ago called King Arthur very loosely based on the film where again, the enemies were the invading Saxons. Curious, isn't it? This is likely some part of the legacy of the Norman Conquest, because in consequent centuries native English were essentially taught to revile their Saxon and Angle heritage and look towards the continent to the south for inspired civilization.   Education also plays a part; in England, children are not taught to identify with the Angles and Saxons and many don't even get the link between Anglish = English until much later in life."

The documents offer what would be a rare glimpse into the workings of one of the reclusive kingdom’s most outward-facing ministries. Many are from 2011-2013, though some date back to years before that.  Cables purportedly from Saudi intelligence and the Saudi embassy in Tehran, suggest ways that popular discontent with the regime could be harnessed.  The leaked documents couldn’t be independently verified.  “It is possible to use the Internet and social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and others to expose Iranian practices,” the cable said. “Members of Iranian opposition abroad must be embraced and coordinated with and encourage them to organize exhibits to feature images of torture committed by the Iranian regime against its people and other peoples in the region,” it added.  Osama Nugali, a Saudi foreign ministry spokesman, claimed on Saturday that many of the documents “have been clearly fabricated.” He played down the significance of the leak, saying the documents “didn't give any information other than that formerly announced by the ministry” on international or regional issues.  The cables posted on WikiLeaks predate the current conflict in Yemen where Saudi Arabia and Iran are on opposite sides. Saudi Arabia since March has led a coalition of countries carrying out airstrikes across its southern border in Yemen.  The strikes, which the U.S. is supporting, aim to unseat the country’s pro-Iranian Houthi rebels and reinstall exiled president Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.  A group calling itself the Yemen Cyber Army took responsibility last month for a hack of the Saudi foreign ministry and released several thousand documents on file-sharing sites, while alluding to a much larger cache. In a statement accompanying the files, the group pointed to Saudi intervention in Yemen, Syria, Bahrain, Iraq and Lebanon among motives for the attack.  WikiLeaks made reference to the intrusion in its statement on the release, though it wasn't immediately clear how the Yemen Cyber Army attack was linked to the WikiLeaks publication.  WikiLeaks publishes classified information submitted anonymously. Its website is best known for leaks in 2010 of U.S. documents on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, as well as thousands of diplomatic cables.  The documents on WikiLeaks published on Friday show Saudi Arabia seeking in ways big and small to channel its animosity toward Iran.  A 2012 cable by former foreign minister Prince Saud Al Faisal to the royal court of then- King Abdullah said the prince strongly supports a proposal by a Saudi media executive to establish a Persian-language television channel to challenge Iran’s “hostile media policies and fake news.”  A cable from the same year, signed by the assistant foreign minister, urges the ministry’s undersecretary for protocol not to allow members of an Iranian diplomatic mission-including the Iranian ambassador-to use the executive offices in Saudi airports or offer any special facilities for the mission.  The cable also orders “the application of strict inspection customs procedures on members of the Iranian diplomatic mission in the kingdom upon their final departure.”  An Iranian spokesman at the United Nations didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Embassies of the Sunni kingdom were also instructed to monitor Shiite Iran’s activities as well as Shiite minorities in other countries."

Taiwan has more of a right to exist as a sovereign state than Israel does, it has clearly defined borders unlike Israel, and Taiwanese people have deep roots in the land that they claim their state in unlike Israelis.  Having said that, as much as I dislike Israel I don't believe Iran gets anything out of challenging them. I don't believe the Arabs or Palestinians like Iran nor are they our natural allies, so it's not in our interests to be aiding their resistance against Israel. The fact Palestinians widely supported Saddam Hussein speaks for itself and is the clearest argument as to why we should just stay out of that conflict and not aid them."

Do you mean have a general knowledge or does the average Iranian have a good understanding of these issues. Lets ask the same question about America. If you answer that question - then I can make some comparisons that may be meaningful.  In general are Americans knowledgable about world geography? Certainly not. Most Americans don't know that Egypt is in Africa. And most Americans can't recognize the most significant works of Bach - or name 3 paintings by Rembrant. If you ask an American about the colonization of the west coast of Africa regarding dates and countries from Europe they will be clueless. The American public school system is not very good.   But if you give some examples of what you mean it is easier to give some kind of answer."
iran,3ai0yw,j3434,3,Sat Jun 20 15:23:26 2015 UTC,"I mean like if you open up a map, and ask an average Iranian on the street, would he be able to point out or at least roughly identify on the map where, Colombia is for instance without having been there?  Would he be able to go to art galleries and be intrigued by many works of art and discuss it with his peers?   Decent knowledge of the country's history pre-revolution?  Understand different political and economical systems?  Be versed in a lot of literature?   I'm aware that most Americans are clueless in these matters, could the same be true for Iranians?"
iran,3ai0yw,j3434,3,Sat Jun 20 15:41:46 2015 UTC,"Most Americans would be hard pressed to point out all the 50 states in America - let alone countries in South America.   But the key problem in the question is the ""in general"" part or as you say a person off the street. It all depends what part of a diverse culture you mean. I would say that most countries are comparable. They have sub-cultures that are in economic oppression and the education they receive is defective so their knowledge of arts, geography would be primarily limited to arts and geographical facts that concern their daily struggle to stay alive. A drug dealer need to know his territory and may love a certain style of art prevalent in that culture.  What part of the world are you from? In most modern countries you have a very similar phenomena. The education is based on a nationalist bias. Would American know much about the geography or demographics of Greenland? Or Iceland? Can they name 3 cities in Belgium ?   It is all relative to the culture and the sub cultures. How many Americans understand the history of rap music?  I don't mean to dance around the issue but you have to be more specific if you want specific meaningful answers.

iran,3agqu6,7kent,4,Sat Jun 20 09:21:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, actually. This was the source of some curiosity for me, because what I was taught in school was that ق and غ are the same sound. They're actually not, but they can be depending on the situation.  Basically, ق is ""q"" and غ is ""gh"". In some dialects, like Tajik, the two sounds are always distinctly pronounced. In ""standard"" Iranian Persian, namely the Tehrani accent, the two letters got merged into a single function, but you can still hear both sounds. Basically if at the beginning of the word, both letters sound a little similar, but ""q"" is generally distinct, and ""gh"" is stronger. In the middle or end of the word, ""q"" tends to sound exactly like ""gh"".  That's why when people Latinize Persian, it's possible that they just write both sounds one way. For example, ""ghand"" (instead of ""qand""), chaagh (instead of ""chaaq""), and ""gharb"" (originally with ""gh""). I suppose you could say there is a trend to have the two sounds merged and completely lose their distinction, but it's not 100% there yet."

iran,3agqu6,Chocksnopp,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:56:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not so certain about Persian's complete phonological history, but I can simply tell you that Modern Persian has the ""gh"" and ""q"" sounds, but it does not have sounds for ظ ض ذ or ث ص at all, so they are treated as ""z"" and ""s"" in all dialects of Persian. Occasionally something like ذ will be transformed into a ""d"", but then the spelling changes too.  As far as I know Persian never had those sounds, but I never studied Old or Middle Persian, so I don't know for sure."

In 1935, Reza Shah asked foreign delegates to use the term Iran (the historical name of the country, used by its native people, similar to natives of Greece referring to their country by the Greek name for it, Hellas) in formal correspondence. Since then, in the Western World, the use of the word ""Iran"" has become more common. This also changed the usage of the names for the Iranian nationality, and the common adjective for citizens of Iran changed from Persian to Iranian. In 1959, the government of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Reza Shah Pahlavi's son, announced that both ""Persia"" and ""Iran"" could officially be used interchangeably.

This is still the case in rural areas and with traditional families. Modern couples however, choose their own mate but their parents’ consent is still very important and is considered by both sides. Even with modern Iranians, after the couple have decided themselves, it is normally the grooms’ parents or other relatives who take the initiative and formally ask for the bride and her family’s consent.   http://www.iranchamber.com/culture/articles/iranian_marriage_ceremony.php"

Iranian history books also emphasize that although Alexander set out to spread Hellenism and Aristotelian values, he ultimately became a monarch of Eastern flavor as he adopted Iranian customs and cultural elements. Essentially, his empire became another continuation of the Iranian state following his death."

iran,3aexqf,Archonios,5,Fri Jun 19 22:33:22 2015 UTC,I read a year ago how Iran manage to stop its huge population growth (article says by 2012 there were  1.7children per woman) with very simple tactics where other contries (China) had to impose strict laws.  Are many children in families consider a good thing? Is it seen as bad thing for people to have many children? Did religion helped managing childbirth?
iran,3aexqf,rezsahin,8,Fri Jun 19 16:57:39 2015 UTC,"Until the mid-20th century, families would have many children because few would make it past infancy or early childhood. Having more children also meant having more farmhands, which was a good investment. Birth control was also unheard of or simply unavailable.  During the shift to urban living, medicine and healthcare improved, but the old mindset remained. Children had a higher survival rate so it was very common to see large families living under the same roof in small apartments.  These children grew up and all started having children of their own (during the 1980s), which resulted in a population boom. It is a very common sight now to see younger people have 1 or 2 siblings, but 5 or more uncles and aunts.   It's not taboo to have many children now, but typically, urbanites have 0-2, and rural folk have relatively more. In my opinion, this is because the rural folk are more ""settled"" and stable than the urbanites; the urbanites are mostly traveling and have little time for large families. Other factors also play in, of course.  Religion hardly plays a role in encouraging or discouraging people to have children, and birth control is widely available in pharmacies and markets. They're even accessible in remote provinces."

The spread of education and literacy into the rural parts of the country is one of the few accomplishments that the IRI has made. Universities are very competitive, and still many Iranians pursue higher education. Due to our nation's poor reputation coupled with what can sometimes be a heavily propagandized curriculum, our universities do not receive international attention. Many Iranians prefer to pursue higher education outside of the country in Universities with better accreditation.  Iranians put a high value on education, regardless of their background."
iran,3aexqf,CYAXARES_II,6,Sun Jun 21 03:20:50 2015 UTC,"Iranians attend boys-only or girls-only schools until university.  The education system is similar to East Asian countries, in the way that it's very reliant on test scores. There is an huge exam all prospective university students must take with even some subjects not related to their hopeful major that is used for entry into public universities. There is also a large network of private universities where the score in that exam sees less emphasis and entry is much easier.  One big difference to the West is that the emphasis on mathematics is much stronger in Iran than in Western countries.  Overall I think the general opinion is positive of the education system, and it is the job market that most people focus their criticisms on."

In a similar vein alooche paste (edit: aloo is plum, alooche is a smaller green plum-y thing) is also nice, which is a sort of liquidy molasses paste with similar flavours to lavashak. I've had it by itself or with lavashak dipped in it. People also use these kinds of pastes extensively in curries.   Within the sweet/sour fruit realm there are also dried sour cherries which I have yet to find anywhere in the west made in the same way. They don't taste like your Costco style dried fruit at all (those taste artificially sweet). It's something unique to Iranian products as far as my experience goes. Definitely more sour."

iran,3aexqf,mrhuggables,3,Sun Jun 21 03:09:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly man, I don't know how my parents do it either. I can read/write/speak Persian but I have to zoom that shit in all the way to make sense of it.   I think the difference is that the level my parents read at they're no longer reading individual letters whereas I'm still kind of trying to phonetically work through the word. I mean this is needless to say since any language that one masters you end up looking at the word/sentence as opposed to the letters, but I'm still fascinated how they can read that tiny font."

A lot of youths/people in the big cities will know the basics.  English grammar is taught in schools, and advanced language is through classes/tutors."

The first answer was the best. Bread, cheese (feta or cream cheese), walnuts and fresh herbs (mint, chives, basil) with sweetened tea (ceylon, darjeeling. earl grey or orange pekoe are ok if you can't find the other two). This is what 90% of people have for breakfast, with some variations. You should include butter and some form of moraba (fruit jam) as well. Simplicity is the way to go on this. Haleem would be waaay overdoing it."

iran,3af0xj,Lucifer_L,5,Sat Jun 20 22:41:16 2015 UTC,Bread (sangak or barbari  or lavash) with feta cheese and walnuts.  Butter and jam.  Halva and dates.  If you want to go heavy halim  and kalleh pacheh (lamb head).
iran,3af0xj,Lucifer_L,3,Fri Jun 19 17:00:30 2015 UTC,What is halim?
iran,3af0xj,Lucifer_L,5,Fri Jun 19 17:04:14 2015 UTC,"Haleem is made of wheat, barley, meat (usually turkey or beef or mutton, but sometimes chicken or minced meat), lentils and spices, sometimes rice is also used. This dish is slow cooked for seven to eight hours, which results in a paste-like consistency, blending the flavors of spices, meat, barley and wheat. They have it at major Persian stores."

One thing I do know is that I don't like it completely mashed up, and I think I might be the exception for liking a chunkier and more chewable experience? Which is why I think this video is a pretty badass take on the traditional recipe.  I also like to top it with gheimeh (lamb stew served with..french fries). I'd also bet a recipe using things like veal and mutton would probably pair pretty well with a Bavarian ale.  By the way this is a very heavy dish, if you noticed. It's not for no reason this is consumed after a month of fasting."

Food outside is crap in comparison.   Iranians are tea drinkers, though they used to be coffee drinkers until about 1600, and traditional tea houses are still referred to as ""coffee houses"" though they serve no coffee (however there are many Starbucks-type places now in Iran-- one was called ""Star Box"")"

I mean I suppose you could, but half the reason it's done with the family is as ritual to bring them together.

It was a norm to leave class rooms and head to dark ,cold bunkers for hours. Back then my family were located in Urmiyah a city bordering USSR ,Turkey and Iraq.At night all the neighborhood families used to gather and sleep in bunkers, day time we go on about out daily life. At night we could hear the mortar and shell rounds as we rest our head on pillow.  I would never forget the day Kurdish refuges pour across the border,their dusty, tired faces, kids with no clothing. They were door knocking and asking for food and water. They would swap their cane of food ration for onions and rice.

iran,3a9ojx,marmulak,3,Fri Jun 19 01:28:07 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that Indians can't distinguish between English and their own language. In Persian, the word is pronounced ""Ramazaan"". Saying ""d"" is also an acceptable possibility, but rare among native speakers. However, since this thread is in English, the obviously correct English spealling is ""Ramadan"".  Ramadan itself is an Arabic word, so it's impossible to say that pronouncing ""d"" instead of ""z"" is ""Arabization"". Either way it's written رمضان"

Azadi is still a good stadium but my God it is light years behind most stadiums I have been to. You have this one dude sitting behind a table selling moshambah full of tokhmeh. Only recently have they put fucking seats, they use to be solid concrete benches.  How can we call ourselves a football loving nation when we don't even have proper stadiums!  If anyone wants to have a cheap giggle have a look at this stadium. It's been under construction for so long that when they eventually finished it, it had to be renovated again!

iran,3abml0,JustALittleSexyPush,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:19:55 2015 UTC,"To be literally 100% honest, I have never heard a negative thing about Iran in my living experience in India (since I was born - present). Neutral/can't say, yes, but negative, never. And I can confidently say that to be typical. Also, Shia Islam is indeed looked favourably (or neutrally) among non-Muslims here. Reasons can be numerous, from the retarded Arab countries, to anything. Almost everyone here knows that fuckups are caused by Sunnis (not going into the whole background, etc., because it will spiral into oblivion, but you get the point). And Iran is known to the people as one of the ancient civilizations/cultures of the world. Regarding food, I don't think Iranian food is popular here. Have never seen a single food joint serving it.  Overall, in the back of people's mind, no, there's no negative sentiment about Iran. Sunnis may hold that sentiment, but in my experience I have never met one with that sentiment (or to be honest, never asked his/her opinion on Iran). You can also see this by the fact that there have been several Shia-Sunni clashes in Lucknow, the stronghold of Shia Islam in the Subcontinent, during Muharram. After all, India has the second largest population of Shias in the world, after Iran.  You can also see this positive/neutral sentiment in any news channel's/newspaper's Facebook page whenever there is a post/news regarding Iran (mainly India-Iran relations, etc.). You won't find negative comments there. However, when it comes to Arab countries, then you will find fuck loads of curses, etc. in the comments. LOL  Edit: Are you an Iranian?"

I wanted to go with the Sassanid one in truth, but I was worried that if I picked any flag/flair that could be even slightly interpreted as showing a personal political leaning that I would be insta-downvoted (for example, if I had a Sassanid flag and I give my opinions on compulsory Hijab then the Muslims would just take one look at my flair and throw on the downvotes) so I think it's better for me to go with a neutral flair.  That way, I can be judged on the content of my opinions, not on a superficial and minimal representation of which incarnation of Iran I most like."

In general it seems very similar to the slant Europe and US/UK/etc put on Russia.  Everything is a playground, and the USA and Russia are throwing dirt at each other again, causing everyone else to flip out.  Perhaps it's the other way around (Muslim sectarian conflict causing USA and Russia to get involved), but throughout I haven't seen Iran really do anything that deserves the level of scrutiny the western media gives it.

And Iran has advanced in technology greatly in the last 36 years. Think capturing a US drone can be done by anyone? Why do you think Iran hasn't been invaded by the US already? Why isn't Iran another Iraq? Why?   Because Iran is advanced enough that the US fears the casualties in an invasion. United States went into Afghanistan, Panama, Indonesia, the Philippines, Iraq, etc. They have invaded more than 150 countries since WW2. All those countries had (and currently have) very little say in the world stage. Iran used to be like one of those countries under the Shah. Iran was not even permitted to refine its own oil, because the Shah was a vassal to the West. Therefore, he valued the interests of his puppeteers over the interests of his people. Otherwise he would've nationalized Iran's oil (as Mossadegh tried) and made the country independent. Under the Shah, the country would've progressed exponentially slower, as he would've always obeyed the commands of his superior. His superiors would've never allowed the country advance in technology as it has now. After all, why should one create competition for themselves? The fact that the US has not invaded and fears invasion goes on to show that Iran, with the current regime, has strong enough technology and military power (direct result of the tech.) to contest United States' potential invasion and influence.  Simply put, Iran has become a potential competitor for the West, having advanced as far as to to contest their influence in the region. This would've never been possible under the Shah, because the West doesn't want competition."

We are lucky the shah and his father set the foundation for modern Iran. Every modern university, you know, the universities which are churning out this research, were established BY THE SHAH.. Sharif University, Tehran university?? THE SHAH. If you gave the shah time, iran would have grown exponentially much earlier than it did.  Talking about how the US is too afraid to invade us isn't something to brag about, it's actually cringeworthy. And your reasoning why they're too 'afraid' is just rumor and hearsay to make ourselves feel better. The only reason we have a 'say' in todays political stage is because of religion, not because of our superior tech or military. Those people in Iraq and Lebanon respect and are influenced by us because of they're shia. That's it.  I love Iran, I think you do too. But why kid ourselves? We are nowhere near a competitor to the west, maybe in a decade, but not now. The middle east is a sack of shit, and Iran is a flow. Why compare ourselves to shit? We can barely build our own cars, and can't even refine our own oil, tell me how we are competing with the west."

All you know is this regime.   The current regime is VERY fucking corrupt. How are most of the millionaires and billionaires mullahs or have ties with mullahs. Why are all of khamenei's sons billionaires? Hint: it's not because they're entrepreneurs. People here cry about the shah stealing the people's money, but fail to see these mullahs are all leeches sucking more money than the pahlavis ever did.  Iran was definitely shit back then, I won't deny it. Was it shit because of the Shah? No, not at all. The Qajars razed Iran to the ground for hundreds of years before the Pahlavis became king. They ruled for only 54 years. What do you expect? Especially when half the country was basically invaded by the british during ww2, and the soviets were funding kurdish and azari seperatists. We owe a lot to the pahlavis.  In the 54 years the Pahlavis reigned, they may not have fixed every problem, but they set up the blueprints for modern iran. Every positive development, city planning, universities (sharif and tehran university to name a few), were built by the shah. This current regime is just taking credit for what Reza Shah and Mohammad Reza Shah started. They took us back a decade after the revolution before they realized they fucked up, and continued the Shah's plans.  I have been to Iran 3 times. The first time I went, Iran actually wasn't developed at all. My family lives in North Tehran, and even there, there were barely any skyskrapers, or modern buldings. South tehran was about as shitty as the Qajars left it. Only within the last 15 years has Iran really started to grow, and it's because the regime woke the fuck up. They have done nothing but slowed down the progress that would have taken place with or without them.  I like you too boush, but we can respectfully disagree on this."

Westerners and exile dissidents simply take it for granted that Iranians necessarily have the same views on social issues as they do, or should.  And FYI Iran does not hang people ""for being homosexual""  This is what Human Rights Watch had to say about the claim   A few Iranian exile groups saw a new audience in Western gays. They began reporting multiple executions in Iran as gay-related. Ireland was one of many drawn into Iranian exile politics with little feel for its complexities. And he leapt ahead even of his secondhand sources—for instance, suggesting a rape trial in Arak was a trial for consensual homosexual sex even though voices within Iran clearly doubted it. http://gaycitynews.nyc/gcn_530/debatingiran.html   And this what Iranian gay activists themselves had to say about it   Neither Human Rights Watch nor the International Gay And Lesbian Human Rights Commission could find conclusive evidence of the homophobic nature of the executions, or of a marked increase in homophobic policies by Iran’s new administration. The evidence offered was by a handful of gay activists, journalists, and bloggers who, in some cases, cited second or third-hand hidden conversations with anonymous sources inside Iran. It is disturbing to see some of the most respected veterans of LGBT politics be carried away by such reports. http://gaycitynews.nyc/gcn_531/peopletopeople.html   What was really going on?   Last year, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch (HRW), and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC) all noted that the two young men had been tried for the rape, at knifepoint, of a 13-year-old boy. http://gaycitynews.nyc/gcn_530/letterfromtheeditor.html"

""Libertarians"" in the US wants to give big businesses larger power and at the same time weaken the states power or remove the state and replace it with corporate power.  They want to have a world where the strong gets everything and the weak is there just for the benefit for the strong.  They claim to not be rascist yet they are #1 with rascist.  They are also #1 with right-wing militias walking around with assault rifles ""protecting"" the southern border of the United States.

Try finding jobs at your Embassy or any foreign organizations and/or entities.  People are very welcoming so you don't need to worry about that. My girlfriend is Lebanese and when we visited together, she really loved it.  You do need a visa, but it will be issued for you at the airport. You can't enter any country without a visa.

Iranians are mostly welcoming but don't be surprised if you find some who aren't. I apologize in advance on behalf of those who may cause bitter experiences for you in the future.  I would say Tehran is the optimal place if you want to find a job but almost anywhere can be nice if you can find a job in advance.

iran,3a2yyo,Sadeghi85,3,Wed Jun 17 02:11:05 2015 UTC,"mokhales (مخلص) = ""close friend"" (had to look it up, it's not really used in colloquial/everyday speech at least in my experience)  -et (-ت) = second person possessive (ie. your's)  -am (-م) = contraction of the first-person conjugation of the word to be (بودن) (ie. ""I am)  so putting it all together we get mokhalesetam (مخلصتم) = I am your close friend.  and kheili khanoomi = ""you're such a lady"" in the same sense that you would say to a man who is very kind that he ""is such a gentleman""  hope this helps."

Shah Abas practiced scorched earth warfare, so he burned the towns and villages on the boarder of the Ottomans which happened to be Armenian, and forced them to the interior of Persia."
iran,3a1zoy,ajoakim,7,Tue Jun 16 17:04:08 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that the Iranian-Armenians of New Jolfa in Esfehan were settled there because of their displacement in war with The Ottomans and that they were treated well compared to other minorities in Safavid Persia. Can you tell me more about this?
iran,3a1zoy,CYAXARES_II,9,Tue Jun 16 17:29:46 2015 UTC,"/u/marmulak is mostly correct, however, there was definitely some scorched earth tactics used and the motivation, timing, and notice given are still in a gray area. What's agreed is that Shah Abbas saw value in the Armenian population for their ties to the silk trade, so he protected them from the Ottomans and welcomed them cordially to Isfahan and allowed them to establish their new quarter; New Julfa. You can read more about it here:  The Politics of Trade in Safavid Iran: Silk for Silver, 1600-1730"
iran,3a1zoy,rezsahin,8,Tue Jun 16 17:44:22 2015 UTC,"Also adding to that, Armenians were know as masons, most of the famous building in Isfahan were built by Armenian that were resettled in Isfahan."
iran,3a1zoy,ajoakim,3,Tue Jun 16 19:52:09 2015 UTC,"they were the victims of a border conflict and Shah Abbas moved them, but they were given top position in Isfahan because he wanted to encourage trade especially in silk, and the Armenians were key to his plans."
iran,3a1zoy,tinlizzey12,3,Wed Jun 17 02:18:50 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, Armenians were welcomed to Iran after being persecuted by the Ottomans. They created a flourishing and prosperous community. Today they are constitutionally protected by Iran's government and guaranteed parliamentary representation.  All Armenian Iranians I met were very kind and friendly towards Muslims like myself, and they consider themselves just as Iranian as anyone else."
iran,3a1zoy,ajoakim,8,Tue Jun 16 17:21:25 2015 UTC,"I know, I myself am a descendant of those Armenians. my grand parents were from New Julfa. I was born in Tehran. Armenians don't hold any animosity towards Iranians, or Muslims in general. I was simply saying that the video made light of the plight of the Armenians at the time by implying that they had a choice in the matter. When your land is divided up between three Giant Empires (Ottoman, Russian, Persian) and your people are being driven out of their lands your choices are limited. Yes Armenian did much better under Persian rule than lets say Ottoman. We all know what happened there."

This is also endorsed by the fact that lower quality cars made in Iran are also a big catalyst to the casualties of drunk driving in Iran.
iran,3a07tx,flaringflame,4,Thu Jun 18 01:07:21 2015 UTC,Of course when Khayyam wrote this there were no BMW or Mercedes Benz.   In poetry wine can be symbolic for anything one finds intoxicating. As is the Bible Jesus turns water into wine. It is a symbol but not always a literal meaning.  That being said - I agree that drunk driving is horrible.

iran,39v6rw,Aryanenzo,0,Mon Jun 15 23:02:50 2015 UTC,I can understand why you may see things that way. There are a number of factors that impact comments on reddit and on this thread and sub. In general the internet comment system seems to provoke or be accepting of hostile or negative comments. Some people may make negative comments based on who posted the OP. Or some people may agree with the concept of freedom but not like that the lady is putting on a show and collecting photographs. I think the members of this sub are complex. I am not sure what is conservative way of thinking. If someone loves the era of Shah and says everything was better then - is that conservative?

But this aside, I'm positive that if you took a poll of Iranians most of them would not support forced hijab. Marmulak, maybe you should try to visit Iran so you can see what it's is actually like, instead of indulging in your own delusional theories."
iran,39v6rw,Nobody1293,0,Mon Jun 15 21:13:35 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting that how people dress in public is not a private affair. At any rate, big ""lol"" on your statement that law shouldn't affect people personally. What people do in public is certainly within the normal domain of government.  As for your analogies, they are mostly inapplicable. Public behavior is different from what you listen to or read or think. What you eat is more likely to be restricted. For example, if someone eats babies then I believe the law will intervene in most countries.  A slippery slope is, by definition, a logical fallacy. So if your argument is simply that it's a slippery slope, that is not a valid argument! Governments restrict people's freedom all the time. The nicest countries in the world have some of the strictest law enforcement. (How do you think they got to be nice?) In USA you can get caught by the police for things like speeding, littering, and other things that in ""less free"" countries you could probably get away with unnoticed, or just pay a little bribe.  If Iranians do not support forced hijab, then hijab should not be forced in Iran. We must consider the will of the people.  Also, I'm not delusional. I've written many times on reddit that the Iranian public appears not to be in favor of forced hijab, which is why it's not a good policy to uphold.  Edit: Also regarding discourse on personal freedom, you might want to hear what Žižek has to say on the subject: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpPuTaP68Dw"
iran,39v6rw,marmulak,-1,Tue Jun 16 05:29:25 2015 UTC,". Public behavior is different from what you listen to or read or think. What you eat is more likely to be restricted. For example, if someone eats babies then I believe the law will intervene in most countries.   I don't think you understand what personal freedom means. Not all freedoms are personal freedoms. Eating other humans is by definition not a personal freedom, because it affects other people in direct and objective ways. 'Personal freedom' encompasses those activities that do not affect other people in direct, objective and provable ways. The  institution of the state was created from the start to regulate activities of an inter-personal nature.    A slippery slope is, by definition, a logical fallacy.   Why do you say that a slippery slope is a logical fallacy? It is very clear that if you allow the state to, say, take away people's right to listen to the music of their choice, you would have a harder time defending people's right to read books of their choice.    The nicest countries in the world have some of the strictest law enforcement.    What's law enforcement got to do with it? we are talking here about personal freedoms. Most laws don't involve personal freedoms at all.  Theft, murder, or fraud are not personal freedoms because they involve other people in direct, objective and provable ways. By their very definition, these crimes have nothing at all to do with personal freedoms."

Recently, John Kerry said the critics of the deal were guilty of hysteria and I wondered if you could respond to that, and also to the question of whether democracies are at a strategic disadvantage. Is dealing with a threat like Iran something that democracies are not structured well to do?   And an extract from the response:   I do remember the story of President Truman, who was asked, ""how did you feel after deciding to launch the nuclear bombs at Nagasaki and Hiroshima, causing at the end [200,000 fatalities]?"" And he said, ""when I heard from my officers that the alternative is a long war with Japan, with potential fatalities of a couple of million, I saw that it is a moral decision.""

iran,39ujhc,Llort2,2,Mon Jun 15 17:57:56 2015 UTC,"From what I remember the last time I was there (07-08ish), we had a lot of Peugeots (405, 216, Persia), Toyotas, Hyundais (I think pride is a Hyundai), Nissan (Nissan Patrol, also a lot of Nissans cars are branded as infinite in the US just for marketing as a luxary car), Samand (Paykan replacement indigineous built), Daewoo's back in the day (Espero, Ceilo, Matiz, the company no longer exists), and obviously Paykans (based on Hillman Hunter I believe from the 1967).  But in the past like 10 years with the income of a few increasing by a lot, usually bazaris from my understanding or people with very solid government connections, that do not know how to spend money and like showing off (new money, Although I would probably buy an Aventador If I could afford it...) Also I think something happened with the tax/tarrif of bringing cars from the outside that lowered a price a bit. But compared dollar to dollar the price of a new car in Iran is ridiculously high. I would say double or more than the MSRP in the US.  Another interesting fact (which might not be true because I have not read the specific law) is that the max engine capacity for cars in Tehran is at most 3000cc. So a Honda Civic or a compact sedan hovers around 1600-2000cc. That is why sometimes you see new model BMW 730 or 520 in Tehran, in the US the newest models lowest configuration I believe is 535 and 745 (The last two numbers are approximate engine displacement so 535 is ~3500cc although that one's twin turbo...)  The engine capacity limit is definitely enforced on motorcycles though, and this one I am pretty sure is 125cc (unless you are a cop which they have the cool BMW ones, that link has all of the make models of Our police vehicles), which is basically a moped. Beginner bikes in the US are 600ccs, which can still go 0-60 sub 3 seconds.  But if you import super cars those rules do not apply.   Hopefully that answered your questions, but I am sure I've gotten a couple of things wrong that others will correct.  Edit: I completely forgot to answer the actual question...So after the revolution they stopped importing cars from the US. Before that importing cars was a lot cheaper and also the rial was much more valuable compared to the $ so it brought the cost of the American cars down. That is why you can see so many cars from the 70s and 60s (specially that era of American cars were built to last, not their passengers so much...). Also Iranian love their cars, they love the big boat (called them kashti), luxury, powerful, all power everything, you could make a 360 turn with one finger, the steering was so lose haha. Another thing as you can see in the video is that the Shah got gifted a lot of very very rare cars by dignitaries of other countries and after the revolution some of those cars were lost. Now If someone who knows what they are doing could realistically find one of those treasures hidden behind piles of scrap metal somewhere in a junkyard and make 100s of thousands of dollars."

Even though I know this is bad history*, prejudice is not easy to subconsciously overcome.  As for the gay thing, I'm not really the type to shout it from the ramparts, but the idea that I may be punished simply for the existence of certain feelings is absolutely terrifying. I'm not too worried about the details of my philosophy (though poorly explained it can certainly sound ""evil"") but how it manifests itself in my actions. It results in me becoming too curious. I want to know everything so I question everything which frequently (albeit unintentionally) crosses into the taboo. The less familiar I am, the more likely I am to do or say something stupid. I work by this (still imperfect) philosophy of knowledge seeking, and while turning it down may be wise... I cannot do it. Questions are my prayers.  Fesenjan...is that pomegranate in that stew? That's... I don't know. It sounds delicious but... the very idea... such a combination is hard for me to wrap my head around.   *This is unnecessary gibberish but something I've been thinking about which I find interesting. The American perspective of the 1979 revolution is generally restricted to the embassy hostage situation. This is viewed as being a key part of President Carter's loss, the 1980 election. Of all 44 presidents , Carter would probably be the most sympathetic to the revolution, at least the most sympathetic since the founding fathers. He drafted Executive Order 12036 which expounded on Executive Order 11905 which banned political assassinations by the United States like the 1953 coup d'état. EO 12036 was intended as a precursor to stronger intelligence reformation and reduction in overseas meddling. This was more or less undone by Executive Order 12333 which was drafted by Reagan, the victor of the 1980 election. Of course, to say that the election was entirely decided due to the Canadian Caper as it is sometimes referred to would be oversimplifying things, but I find it fascinating."

Training camps are only reserved for close Iranian allies, not a bunch of cavemen jihadists who are in a temporary alliance of circumstances. While maybe getting Iran to reign in the Afghan central government, the taliban would never secure training facilities here. Iran would never stand for that. And just on that I have reason to belive the source information here is incorrect/propoganda.   remember, the taliban closely mirror terrorist organizations on Iran's border which claim to be sunni freedom fighters and Iran knows for sure the taliban would use tactics from Iranian training camps against Iran.

iran,39ma57,marmulak,5,Sat Jun 13 20:38:25 2015 UTC,"Some Muslims actually don't believe that homosexual marriage is a sin in Islam, but it's a bit of a stretch. A lot of things are possible with very liberal interpretations of the Qur'an, but I think it's reasonable to understand that Islam disallows it.  However, some people actually have no regard even for reasonable interpretations of anything. For example, years ago I had a liberal friend telling me about the struggles for a Mormon friend who refused to go on a mission, clearly going against the church. Since in Mormonism the church is the ultimate authority (the church leader is their prophet), I told her that obviously her friend doesn't truly believe in Mormonism, otherwise he would have accepted the mission as a requirement of his faith. I suggested that in order to be happier, her friend should come to terms with the fact that he's not actually Mormon. To my friend this was somehow a shocking and unacceptable response, and that her friend is definitely Mormon simply because he feels like it or wishes to be. To me that's contradictory.  People want to ""have their cake and eat it too"", which is they want the moral credit of being associated with a respected faith, yet they don't want to live up to it at all. This is actually very common with ""cultural"" Muslims (or ""cultural"" anything, for that matter). Just look at the Zionist entity. They want what association with a faith can gain them, but they don't want to sacrifice for the faith."

iran,39ke2a,Noamand,22,Fri Jun 12 18:51:55 2015 UTC,Hello! I'm a linguist with a passion for dialects.   Do you have many dialects in Iran? Are some of these recognized as official languages? Do you have any joke/funny commonplace about particular dialects?
iran,39ke2a,LordElrondd,9,Fri Jun 12 11:44:11 2015 UTC,"Hi Italian friend!   Yes! many different dialects. Sometimes it becomes so severe that two villages within few kilometers of each other would have trouble understanding each other's dialects. Farsi is the country's official language. Something I should clarify though: we have many Farsi dialects spoken by people but we also have different languages that are spoken wildly across certain parts of the country, such as Turkish, Kurdish and Arabic. So definitely a multi-language country.  Yes, yes we do. We like to make fun of pretty much every single dialect, but I'd say the most common one is Turkish dialect! :)"
iran,39ke2a,marmulak,10,Fri Jun 12 13:03:53 2015 UTC,"Do you have many dialects in Iran?   Oh yes. Also, feel free to stop on by at Tajikistan and Afghanistan. I even met Persian speakers in my travels to Uzbekistan. Every part of the world where Persian is spoken, it has its own local dynamics. As far as I can tell, Persian is more or less split between an East-West continuum. I imagine Italian has something similar going on (maybe a North-South continuum?).  Iran is home to many languages that are not mere dialects. For example, a huge percentage of Iranians speak a dialect of Turkish called Azeri as their native tongue. Persian is the national language, whose dialects are only officially known as ""Persian"" except when they are found outside of Iran. For example, in Central Asia (Tajikistan and Uzbekistan), Persian is called ""Tajik"", and people seem to recognize Farsi (Persian) as a separate language even though it is not. In Afghanistan Persian is officially recognized as Dari. Within Iran it's known that people from different cities speak Persian with a different accent/dialect, such as Esfahani, Mashhadi, Tehrani, and so on.  In Iran there are a few languages from the Iranian family that are considered separate from Persian--languages such as Kurdish, Lori, Gilaki, Balochi, and more. Outside of Iran more members of this family include Pashto, the Pamiri language group (which sometimes includes Wakhi), Yaghnobi, and others. If you love Indo-European languages like me, you'll have a field day in this region.  As to what extent Iran recognizes its minority languages politically, I have no idea. It seems like only Persian is supported by the establishment, and it's the thing that unites Iranians nationally.  I have heard that ""Italian"" as we know it today was formed almost artificially out of government policy via a conglomeration of dialects from within Italy. To what extent is this true, and can you elaborate a little on this? I wish I had learned Italian in school rather than Spanish.  Sadly, I don't have a joke specifically about Persian dialects, but I did hear a language joke recently. Here in Tajikistan, Shughni is one of the Iranian languages spoken in the Pamir mountain range. It's not Persian, but is related to it. In Shughni, the word ""shito"" means ""cold"", so there is a joke about when Russians first came to the Pamirs, one Pamir host, who did not know Russian much, offered his guest ""shir chai"" (milk tea). Russians understand ""chai"" (tea) as the word is the same in their language, but not ""shir"", so the Russian man says, ""Shto chai??"" (What tea?). This shocks the Pamir host, who says, ""No no no, the tea is hot!"""
iran,39ke2a,Noamand,8,Fri Jun 12 14:41:07 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, thank you :)   I imagine Italian has something similar going on (maybe a North-South continuum?).   Yes, Italy has PLENTY of dialects as well, mainly divided in nothern, middle, and southern dialects. here you can find a rough map   If you love Indo-European languages   You got me ahaha :)   As to what extent Iran recognizes its minority languages politically, I have no idea. It seems like only Persian is supported by the establishment, and it's the thing that unites Iranians nationally   This, for example, is different in Italy. Here 12 languages (other than Italian) are recognized and uphold by the constitution, even if Italian remains the official language of government, school, administrations, etc.   I have heard that ""Italian"" as we know it today was formed almost artificially out of government policy via a conglomeration of dialects from within Italy. To what extent is this true, and can you elaborate a little on this?   Well, this is VERY hard to explain. The simplest version is: Latin > Vulgar Latin of Italy > Fiorentino (Vulgar Latin spoken in Florence at around 1300 ac) > Italian. By the way, this is an historical misunderstanding, caused by the fact that Dante Alighieri (from Florence) was the first author to publish a literary masterpiece in a Vulgar Latin dialect, his dialect, when Latin was still perceived as the only fair language. So, Divine Comedy (1304) is perceived as the ""birth certificate of Italian language"", but it is only the most famous. The reality is that at some point of the Latin evolution - mainly because of the splitting of the Roman Empire - Vulgar Latin started to be spoken in hundreds of different ways, all different and all similar to each other. When, during the Risorgimento, Italy needed reasons to unify the People and the Country against the foreigner dominators, language was chosen as a 'vehicle' in order to make the people feel as a unique one. Around those times, a sort of ""built up, artificial, mixed, noble Italian"" was chose as national language, and it remained until today.  Thanks for the joke, very funny :)"

iran,39ke2a,marmulak,4,Sat Jun 13 14:55:20 2015 UTC,"There are Arabic speakers native to Iran, but they are an often overlooked minority because they're like not even the second or third (or fourth of fifth?) minority. Most of them are located in the southwest of Iran near the Persian gulf, closest to Arabia. Arabic has a bit wider variation within its many dialects, and Persian has (in my opinion) less variation, although I believe that dialects of Persian are still less standardized than English. They way a person speaks Persian in, say, Kabul, compared to Tehran is going to be a little bit more different than speaking English in the US or the UK, although I suppose it's a fair analogy.  Most Iranians don't have competency in Arabic, although it's compulsory in school. You can think of it how Latin is to English. Some Iranians are actually fully fluent in Arabic, but the majority will never use the language except for prayers. Persian is actually the lingua franca in the region spanning roughly between the Arabian Peninsula and Pakistan/China. Everywhere west and south of Iran Arabic becomes the standard, but more to the north it's Turkish."

The Iranian exile dissidents who promoted this claim, found a willing and credulous audience in gay-rights advocates, right about when ""Pink washing"" became a thing.   This is what the Human Rights Watch monitor has to say about the allegations    For eight months, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has researched a report on abuses based on sexual orientation and gender identity in Iran, interviewing dozens in Iran and the diaspora, trying to separate fact from rhetoric and rumor. As a prominent Iranian dissident said last week, 'We need cases!' documentation, not speculation. When pictures of two young men hanged in the Iranian city of Mashhad circulated in July 2005, revulsion rode with them around the world. Doug Ireland began a campaign in Gay City News to prove that the Mashhad case was one of consensual homosexual sex, and that the Ahmadinejad regime was carrying out a 'massive pogrom,' an 'intensifying crackdown.' His reporting was deeply irresponsible. His claims about Mashhad relied entirely on second-hand sources. Ireland never confirmed those reports. No one has. His main source hasn’t shared information directly, even with the Persian Gay and Lesbian Organization. Ireland proclaimed the rape charges 'refuted.' If we want to challenge Iran’s government, we need facts. There is enough proof of torture and repression that we can do without claims of 'pogroms.' If we want to act, we need a goal.

iran,39ke2a,LordElrondd,15,Fri Jun 12 13:07:31 2015 UTC,"Ciao!   I'm probably not fit to answer this since I'm not a woman. Iran has been opposing ISIS pretty much since day 1. Iran even warned the west numerous times about the rise of extremist groups in Iraq because of the power vacuum created by United States, but as usual, no one listened. Iran has been rumored to be directly involved in the fight against ISIS in the past couple of months, but we're definitely giving financial and military support to the shia militia fighting in Iraq. The operations are lead by General Qasem Soleimani. (All hail based Gen. Soleimani!) Real Iran is very different from the Iran protrayed by the media in the west. All you need to do is listen to the account of any westerner that has traveled to Iran. Forget the news, listen to the first hand accounts of real people! I suggest for you to watch this episode of Anthony Bourdain's show.     edit: words"

iran,39ke2a,tinlizzey12,5,Fri Jun 12 16:23:23 2015 UTC,"WTf is infibulation? If you're referring to female genital mutilation, that's an African tribal practice not an Islamic one, and is practiced in Africa even in Christian-majority states such as Eritrea, and Ethiopia. Apparently it was adopted by some Sunni sects via Egypt, and recently there was a report that a minority within a minority of Sunni Arabs or Kurds in Iran do practice a less aggressive form of FGM but even that discovery was shocking to the researchers, since this is entirely unknown to Iranian culture. So all in all, there are probably more people in the West doing this than in Iran.  Of course the demonization of Iran means this issue is called a ""growing problem"" among Sunnis which the govt is not cracking down on because Iran doesn't want to upset Sunnis -- which is utter nonsense since FGM is hardly commonplace among Sunnis in Iran or anywhere else. You have to watch out for what the media say about Iran -- not long ago the Canadian National Post claimed that Jews in Iran were forced to wear yellow badges, which was totally false"

Thanks!"
iran,39ke2a,marmulak,9,Fri Jun 12 19:04:41 2015 UTC,"The most immoral thing about Italy is Berlusconi. Other than that, you guys are cool.  I always feel like Iran and Italy have something deeply in common because of their location and role in world history. Italy was the Roman Empire, Iran was the Persian Empire. Two huge powers that shaped the world as we know it today, who have thousands of years of history, art, literature, etc which they are proud of. Both are religious centers, have delicious and well developed culinary cultures, and so on. They even were in conflict with each other for a long time, but I think that's all over with. Some of the coolest Europeans I've met with respect to their interest and knowledge of the near East were Italians. Ever played Assassin's Creed?  Also, why are our flags the same color?"
iran,39ke2a,coheir,3,Fri Jun 12 12:24:41 2015 UTC,The conflict can in fact be the source of similarities I think.   In the old days cultures didn't interact this much. And one of the limited ways of interact then was seeing each other in the battlefield.   Just an uninformed theory of mine.
iran,39ke2a,marmulak,3,Fri Jun 12 14:25:35 2015 UTC,I'm sure warfare also stimulates further conflict off the battlefield
iran,39ke2a,Hull-tanker91,7,Fri Jun 12 19:34:43 2015 UTC,"Do you think our cultures are very different   No not really.  When trying to explain to swedes how religious normal Iranians are I usually try to compare religious people in Iran with religious people in Italy or Poland.  People believe in god, but they sin and they dont follow the rules of their religion to 100%.  Iranian society is tradtional and centered around family much like most catholic societies do to.  I also think there is lots of resemblances between Shia Islam and Catholicism since they both have organized clergy and both organized clergies have affected both cultures a lot."

Your typical/ most common holiday destinations?"
iran,39ke2a,Lucifer_L,3,Fri Jun 12 17:40:03 2015 UTC,"what is a typical snack of your country?   You would love fresh white mulberries picked right off the tree, considering you hail from a country that's capable of growing them. You might have to do research though before you decide if it's feasible. Finally, if you can't get it in Italy, you might want to put it on your itinerary if you plan on visiting Iran during the harvest season.  To be honest the Iranian government really needs to set up a tourist circuit where they can take foreigners to the different sights and also allow them to dine on the various foods.."
iran,39ke2a,italianjob17,3,Fri Jun 12 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"white mulberries   WOW, never had those! On the other side I had plenty of black mulberry which are actually white when not ripened.   I ate them fresh, as jam or as puree mixed with grated ice when in Sicily (granita di gelsi) they are delicious!  Is the white version flavour similar to the black one or is it a completely different flavour?"
iran,39ke2a,Lucifer_L,3,Sat Jun 13 10:17:27 2015 UTC,"Hard for me to explain with words.. if I remember correctly it's definitely lighter, sugary sweet with a very distinct fruity sort of tone to it. But it's well worth it - if I know this right, the Iranians brought it over way back when and adopted it from China, to which the species is native.  I don't want to sound like I'm blowing the horn, but I think the white ones are really different in flavor and much finer tasting - though the black ones obviously have their own uses.  Fresh white mulberries as a snack and as an ingredient idea for different recipes? Very different."
iran,39ke2a,QueLogico,2,Sat Jun 13 11:11:45 2015 UTC,"Apart from pistachios, what is a typical snack of your country?   They love all kinds of nuts, and every Iranian household has a fruit bowl like this.  Yes, cucumber is a very popular 'fruit' in Iran; they eat it with salt (this is not a joke).  Edit:  I thought I'd attempt a few of the other questions:   Can you suggest some good recent persian movies? I've seen Persepolis, the Persian Cats and Offside.    I liked Marmulak.  A separation is highly critically acclaimed, but not exactly a barrel of laughs.   Your typical/ most common holiday destinations?   I suppose most Iranians travel within Iran.  You can find whatever you want in Iran, historic cities like Esfahan or Shiraz, beautiful landscapes on the the coast of the Caspian, modern shopping and beach location on Kish, etc. Outside Iran, it's probably Turkey (because Iranians don't need visas to travel there) or Dubai (since it's close, modern and has a large Iranian expat population).

iran,39ke2a,Hull-tanker91,7,Fri Jun 12 13:38:50 2015 UTC,"I have seen the movie and I liked it but there is some things that I think should be cleared.  It is true that during the war young Iranians (12-15 year olds) fought at the front, but in the movie it is depicted like Iran instituted a general draft and forced children to march to the front. Iran was fighting a total war but never needed to draft regular citiziens, the struggle against Iraq was highly nationalistic and a lot of people of all ages joined up to lay their lifes down for the fatherland.  It is sad and morbid that children was allowed to go to war but I cant blame the children, I blame the parents that let them go and I blame the mullahs for letting it happen. The children who went to the front to fight where all heroes, they and all Iranians who fought.   more generally: what do you think of the revolution   I am a republican and I am 100% opposed to monarchy. Not only that the revolution of 1979 wasnt 100% islamic, it was a broad popular revolution that had support from almost all of society.  The revolution was justified, the thing is that I would have liked it more if the National front or Tudeh won the power struggle after the revolution.

A couple of questions now that the most obvious ones I had have run out:   how is the Arab conquest of the Sassanid empire taught in schools? I guess there is some dissonance between the arrival of the new faith and the fact that it came with yet another invasion. On a side not, how is the Greek conquest seen?

I have a few questions, let's start with something simple but very important to me; food. Can you provide some traditional recipe which is cookable with easy to find ingredients and standard kitchen utensils?        But easy subjects apart, since I never made a big effort to understand the Islamic schism, are the tensions between Shia and Sunni Muslims in any way comparable to the situation we had in Europe after the Reformation in the 16th century (and the bloody wars which followed)? Given that said tensions are as tangible as we hear here.     Another question I wanted to ask is the following: What do you think about the big foreign political topic of the moment, the nuclear program. I mean, I, for my part, am sort of reassured by the fact that Italy stopped its own program back in 1990, since I bet we could somehow have managed to make a mess out of it. But I get it that the situation may be different.     How should we interpret the tentatives to loosen the reins appeared on the news in the last period, in which direction is Iran heading in your opinion?      And now it's stereotype time!

iran,39ji2f,talltaleteller,13,Fri Jun 12 04:01:21 2015 UTC,"To understand Iran's unique relationship with Islam, one must look at the historical political context Islam was introduced to Iran in. Islam was introduced to Iran and Rome by force. As the Roman identity in the Middle East has vanished, the ""Roman experience with Islam"" is a moot point. However, the fact that the Persian nation proved to be longer-lasting than the Roman one merits some points of consideration regarding the Islamization of Iran.  Before the Arab conquests, in the early Seventh century, the Persian and Roman empires were waging a devastating thirty year war of attrition against each other. Both sides made extensive use of Arab proxies to defend their southern borders. At the same time as Rome and Persia were bleeding each other white, Muhammad was unifying the disparate tribes of the Arabian peninsula under the rule of a single polity. For centuries, Arabs had fought each other for scarce resources; now united under Islam, the disparate tribal identities began to co-mingle and create a new aggregate ""Arab Muslim"" identity.  After Muhammad's death and subsequent power struggles, the Arab Muslims were left with no internal enemies, so they turned outwards towards the two severely weakened empires to their north.   The Arabs first began with cross-border raids into Persia to steal treasure and slaves. At the time, the Sassanid Empire's defense relied on local Satraps maintaining peasant conscript armies to bolster the standing professional Cataphract forces of the Sassanid nobility. These local peasant conscript armies, exhausted from three decades of warfare, were little to no match for the highly mobile and motivated Arab invaders. The Arabs would attack a town, then disappear into the desert before the army could arrive. The Arab raids increased in severity and boldness, and eventually gained the sanction of the Caliph. The raids eventually reached the gates of the imperial capitol of Ctesiphon, and after an astonishing victory over a Persian defending army that outnumbered them threefold, the Arabs captured Ctesiphon and looted the imperial treasury. With the fall of their capitol, the Iranians lost Mesopotamia and half of their empire.  The Iranians retreated behind the Zagros Mountains and launched raids to regain their territory. For three years, a game of tug-of-war between the Arabs and Iranians ensued, until the Arabs invaded Iran proper to put an end to the raids. The Imperial Army put up one final titanic stand against the Arabs but was utterly destroyed in a final battle against the invaders.   At that point, the Arabs spread across the Iranian plateau and enforced an Arab political structure. The majority of Iranians were discouraged from converting to Islam, encouraged instead to pay a poll tax known as jizya. Only Arabs could hold political office. Iranians who wished to work in the government had to convert to Islam and learn to speak Arabic, and were given second class political status in the new Arab empire. There was a period (دو قرن سکوت) where Arabic was the only permitted written language in Iran, and Persian became the language of the illiterate peasantry. This sad state of affairs continued for two centuries until the Abbasid Revolution removed the second-class citizenship of Iranians and treated non-Arab muslims on equal terms as the Arabs.   The Abbasid Revolutionaries came to power by riding a wave of Iranian resentment at their second-class status. To maintain power, the Abbasids granted virtual autonomy to their Persian generals, who within a few generations began styling themselves ""Shahs."" Because these Persian generals were Muslims, they sought to prove their legitimacy not through the force of arms of a distant Caliph as in pre-Abbasid times, but through local Islamic fervor. It was during this time, between 800 - 1000 A.D., that the Koran was translated into Persian, thus providing Persian with a new writing system. Meanwhile, poets like Ferdowsi were writing ""King's Letters,"" or ""Shahnameh,"" and the one by Ferdowsi is widely considered to have resserrected literate Persian through its eschewment of Arabic loanwords and embrace of Middle Persian vocabulary a full two centuries after the fall of the Sassanid state.   The Mongols in 1200 cut Persians off from Arab Islamic religious authorities, and Iranian Islam developed independently in the countryside away from the great cities such as Baghdad. Jumping ahead, the Safavid's forced all of Iran under their new polity in 1500 and also forced the conversion of Iranians to Shia Islam. Shia Islam serves Iranian nationalist interests surprisingly well: By refusing the legitimacy of the so-called ""Rashidun"" caliphs and praising allegiance to Ali, Iranians were able to simultaneously curse the men who destroyed the Persian Empire while being good Muslims.   In conclusion, the best way to understand Iranian ambivalence towards Islam is to understand that Arab Muslims did indeed make a concerted effort at exterminating Persian high culture, and despite this, Persian culture survived. Everywhere the Arabs conquered now speaks Arabic; Only Iran speaks Iranian languages.  You might say, ""Iran survived Islam by bending itself to Islam, while also bending Islam to itself."""
iran,39ji2f,megamegaberightback,5,Fri Jun 12 04:35:21 2015 UTC,Everywhere the Arabs conquered now speaks Arabic; Only Iran speaks Iranian languages   What about turkic countries of that time which were invaded by the Arabs? I don't think they spoke Arabic afterwards.
iran,39ji2f,7kent,5,Fri Jun 12 08:27:25 2015 UTC,What Turkic countries did the Arabs conquer? The modern-day Turkic states are built on top of land that was originally Iranian.

iran,39ji2f,ashbourne10,6,Fri Jun 12 12:44:39 2015 UTC,"/u/7kent, here is your answer.   Conversion of Turkic peoples to Islam by Arabs was almost always peaceful. Later conversion was obviously forced by the sword in many cases from their formerly Tengriist brethren. The Arabs didn't really conquer any Turkic territory, but instead destroyed Iranic kingdoms and states as they spread across the east which made a huge gap of power that allowed the Turks to enter.   Look at Soghdia, for example. The Arabs destroyed everything which meant the Karluks, the ancestral enemies of the Soghdians, could easily come in and establish pastural grounds. The area was traditionally under nominal Chinese hegemony, so then the Chinese came in all like 'Ey mate who the fuk r u, what have you done with our subjects?'. The Arabs allied themselves to the Karluks and used their superior knowledge of warfare to win the battle.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Talas  And that, my friends, became modern Kyrgyzstan."

Ali in general was opposed to a lot of the un-islamic and aggressive tendencies of the first three caliphs.   I've never come across this in Iran typically because whoever brings it up is dismissed with the fact that Shia Islam already doesn't look too favorably upon the people who actually attacked Islam and is a bit more puritanical in its approach to ""real Islamic values"" divorced from the actions of major political figures.   Abroad however the echochamber allows this idea to spread and gain ground even though its flat out retarded.   Islam taught that there is no compulsion in religion, that no arab is superior to a non-arab, that to convert others through logic/reason instead of ridicule and force. Yet none of these were the hallmarks of Iranian conversion to Islam. I think Islam needs to be divorced from the figures who claimed to propagate it. because quite frankly they've done a shit job of following it.    Is this an Iranian identity issue? If Islam had been spread peacefully to Iran as opposed to by war, like it was to the Turkic steppe peoples, would this issue of identity, nation and religion today be less present, or am I drawing connections where no points of relevance lie? Thank you.   So its more of a expat/orientalist issue than Iranian issue. The fetishization of pre-abrahamic religions in European and Asian expats is quite stupid.

iran,39ji2f,MardyBear,5,Sat Jun 13 00:08:57 2015 UTC,"It is important to understand that Islam was not instated upon Iran in any ways exceptionally more violent than had been done to any other people under any other invading ideology. Official conversions to Islam were not immediate, and largely took place over centuries of time, and most were done in order to gain economic freedoms and social mobility. The reason why Islam is so hard to accept is because it is a challenge to another prevailing identity, which are the notions of an indigenous ""Iranian"" culture. This is not a modern phenomenon, as the conflict between these two identities has existed from the time of Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, and even Hafez (as evidenced by some of what they wrote). To wit, there have been many Iranians throughout history who have been wary of Islam as being an imposition of a foreign culture, but to think that Iran is somehow separable from Islam at this stage of its history would be naive.  To put it in short, most Iranians have a problem with Islamic identity because it has historically been in a struggle for dominance with the indigenous culture. Even the Islamic Republic of today prioritizes the values and traditions of Islam over the indigenous traditions of the country--an aspect of its policies which makes it very unpopular with a lot of Iranians. Naturally these struggles will result in a lot of tension, especially for people today who wish to live a secular life in the face of a heavily politicized strain of Islam.  TL;DR: Islam was not imposed any more violently than any other ideology would have been. Islam's power and influence posed and continues to pose a real threat to indigenous Iranian culture, which made and still makes many Iranians wary of its presence in Iranian society. The real fact of the matter is that Islam has simply become a part of that ""indigenous"" culture, and many Iranians struggle to find a way to reconcile the two identities."
iran,39ji2f,antipropagandist,7,Fri Jun 12 17:37:33 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. The reason why no one cares about Alexander's invasion and the Hellenization of Iran is because the Greeks left no lasting influence on Iranian culture, whereas the same is not true for Islam. Coupled with the facts that Islam reached Iran through invasion - this is where I diverge from you, I think there is ample evidence that Arab rule in Iran was brutal for the first century - and that Islam does invariably carry with it Arab influence, it's not surprising that many Iranians feel uneasy about this subject.

Islam lifted the Arabs out of the misery they were in. Which was one of Islam's (allah's however you look at it) minor goals. Islam is a universal concept not specific to Arabs. Islam compleatly anihalated pre Islamic Arab culture. Yet did not do the same for virtually all other ethnicities. That says something about the religion no? I don't hate Arabs.   The Arab who brought the faith was Mohammad, the Arabs who dragged the faith through the dirt were Muaviyeh, yazid, more Arabs who tarnished the religion than helped it grow; this fosters animosity."

This is common bullshit spouted by hipster Iranians in the West who scramble to distance themselves from modern Iran/Islam, and thus conjure up this fantastical myth about Islam capturing, ""true Persia"".   The truth, is that Islam wasn't, ""forced"" on an unwilling Iran, it was proudly and willingly adopted by the Iranian people over a period of many centuries.   Are there individual instances of forced conversion/oppression by foreign forces (Turks/Arabs)? Sure. However, these were the exceptions, not the rule."

First of all, under Islamic law there are many benefits to converting to Islam. You can get rid of the horrific Jizya tax that bleeds people dry literally just for not being Muslims. If you commit a crime, and you convert to Islam, bam - you're innocent. Zoroastrians were not allowed to testify against Muslims in legal disputes, meaning if they were accused of anything, they would go to jail for it. They could not marry Muslim women, but Muslims could marry multiple Zoroastrian women.   Study the basics of Islamic law just slightly and maybe perhaps you will discover that what seems willing to you is actually based on legal and social coercion."

Yes, there were socio-economic benefits, but why didn't the rest of the Iranian population run off with the Parsi in India? Fact was, Zororastrianism and the Persian Empire was on its last legs, the Arabs got there and pounced on their weakness like any shrewd empire would.

That saying from Muhammad is, at best, apocryphal. You represent the typical Islamic interpretation of the Arab invasion, which is choked with sentimental emotion. It is unfortunate that many Muslims are unable to take a secular view of history; your use of the honorific, ""the prophet"" before Muhammad's name is a red flag as to your lack of objectivity. While there were Persian converts to Islam in Muhammad's bayt such as Salman al-Farisi, the vast majority of Iranians would have likely stayed Zoroastrian or Christian as they had for centuries."

We're talking about things like the 1979 revolution, the influences of America/Europe/Russia, etc. This whole ""Arabs ruined our civilization with Islam"" is just a convenient re-imagining of Iranian history the fits nicely with the conflicts Iran has had against Arab nationalists in the past several decades. Remember Saddam?  Iranians influenced Islam just as much as Islam influenced them, and Islam became a deeply ingrained part of Iranian identity after Arab rule ended in Iran. Iranians are one of the nationalities that actually benefited the most from the spread of Islam. The other groups you mentioned like Turkic Muslims and African Muslims actually retained their original culture less than Iranians did.  Iranians who really hate Islam basically hate Iran itself. Show me one non-Muslim dynasty that ruled Iran in the past 1000 years. That's longer than some European nations have existed. Iran as we know it today was formed by the Safavids, who were religious zealots.  As for the Turks, Islam didn't spread war to them. They spread war to Islam. Islam was one of the many treasures they looted along the way and decided to keep for themselves.  Certainly it is an identity issue. There are only so many things that can define Iranian identity. Right now the big two are Persian language and Shiaism. They use a combination of the two because neither is a 100% perfect fit for the entire country. Not all Iranians are Shia, and not all Iranians speak Persian, but if you can do one of the two you can fit in somewhere. If neither then you probably don't really like Iran very much."

Introduced in August 2010 at Gamescom 2010,  Mir-Mahna officially was released in Tehran, Iran in February 2011.  Mir-Mahna is the first Iranian game about the life of a contemporary Iranian hero and the second game after ""Garshasp Gorz-e-Serit"" to focus on Iranian heroes.  The game story line was based on a series of books entitled, ""On the Red Marine Roads"" by Nader Ebrahimi,  an Iranian writer, screenwriter, photographer, director and actor. By using traditional Iranian music with modern computer motion capture, the game designers sought to introduce Iranian culture and civilization worldwide.   This was part of a larger effort by the Iranian government to use computer games to help convey its culture.

I hope once the sanctions are lifted and the economic climate looks promising with foreign investment from foreigners, Iranians abroad, and Iranians in Iran confident enough to invest in companies instead of property, gold or cars, we'll see the Iranian start-up scene start booming and Iran will become the technology hub of Western Asia.

To my knowledge, if you are a smart/hard-working kid in Iran you have an 80% chance of becoming an engineer and , apart from medicine, other subjects are  either practically non-existent or are regarded as lacking prestige. I don't know why you say there is no such thing as too many engineers. There absolutely is such a thing as too many engineers, too many doctors etc. Even from an engineer's perspective it is much better to have a diverse economy because a  diverse economy would include a strong financial sector, which would allow engineers to easily found their own companies. Because the economy is so interdependent there needs to be some kind of balance between the different sectors for each sector to be able to flourish."

Engineering is just receiving some disproportional attention which is totally fine if the graduates are able to make start-ups and create a good or service and in turn create wealth.

iran,39b7ep,rezsahin,4,Thu Jun 11 05:47:43 2015 UTC,"The sanctions did indeed provide a golden opportunity for Iranian companies, however this was not widely utilized, unfortunately.   It would have been a golden opportunity because the independence from global banking systems and protection from competitive imports due to sanctions would have created a wholly self-sufficient manufacturing sector. Iran would have pumped its own hydrocarbons, used it in its own industries by its own native workforce, and have the largest middle class in the Middle East consume and invest in it.  Nearly 40 years to do so and the fruits of it are basically nonexistent. Why? The sanctions provided more incentive and profit from smuggling imports rather than entrepreneurship. Creative energy that could have been used to innovate new products was instead directed to devise new smuggling schemes and bypass sanctions, feeding only a small, corrupt elite.  Yes, opening Iran up will introduce big companies like Amazon, but it will reduce the incentive for smuggling and sanction bypassing. This incentive will be redirected to innovation, helping small businesses who now have access to a global network, flourish. The overall picture is a net gain."

Actually, the big businesses knock out the small, this is a given. That's why you don't give the large businesses room to operate in the first place, but small businesses, definitely need the room to grow."
iran,39b7ep,rezsahin,2,Thu Jun 11 13:36:05 2015 UTC,"I think big businesses will make it harder for small ones, but there's something else. Due to sanction and everything that has happened during last 40 years, Iran is kind of a black box to foreign businesses. They need insiders' insights and knowledge, and I think this will create new opportunities for local and smaller businesses"
iran,39b7ep,derintellectual,2,Thu Jun 11 18:37:51 2015 UTC,"Well, essentially, the ""room to grow"" that you're talking about refers to providing small businesses with incentives and opportunities to operate against competition they can handle. This doesn't work in a sanctioned environment because the incentives provided by smuggling are greater, so would-be entrepreneurs either leave the country or turn to smuggling."
iran,39b7ep,derintellectual,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:46:48 2015 UTC,"This probably due to mismangement the lack of entrepreneurial spirit in Iran.

iran,39b5nv,Lucifer_L,3,Wed Jun 10 21:24:49 2015 UTC,Iran goes out of its way to please Sunnis. Even the Iraqi militias go out of their way not to antagonize Sunnis. Iran even jails Shia clerics who talk down Sunnism to much. Follow any Iraqi milita twitter and you'll see they continuously post about Sunnis being a part of Iraq . ect. But the Americans are but hurt over losing Iraq and they will continue painting Iran and the Iraqi militias as evil entities. When if its completely false.   Realistically sectarianism is generally a one way occurrence. Usually coming from Sunni countries. Its Saudi school textbooks which teach that Shias are infidels. Of course you wont hear that on NPR

It's like the Zaidis in Yemen are only Ahle Bayt politically, not necessarily theologically, that's why a Zaidi is almost indistinguishable to a mainstream Sunni and these are the original Shias (which means Party of Ali). The Twelvers and Ismailis went a whole other way into making the Imams infallible, excessive Ashura mourning, cursing the first 3 caliphs (particularly Twelvers) and doing these things at the Imamzadehs etc.   In fact, the Zaidis were the first ones to coin the term 'Rafidah' meaning 'rejectors' of the first 3 caliphs for the Twelvers. Historically, the Ithnaashariyah were a minority amongst the Shias themselves even."

iran,397t02,Sepahani,2,Thu Jun 11 00:26:15 2015 UTC,"It will end up leaving Iran with obsolete technology and research facilities in the long term while the rest of the world continues to advance. It would have been better just to shut down the enrichment facilities completely right now in order to immediately trigger the end of sanctions instead of drag out their menace for years. The best way to have ended this crisis and move on would have been to appeal directly to Iranians with the truth about why nuclear activities began in the first place when the Revolutionary Guard decided to clandestinely pursue a bomb in their bid to become the superior military power in the region. Rather than opening up to his own society, he decided to submit to the demands of the P5+1 in order to preserve the regime’s power. For the third time since the 1979 revolution, the regime has prolonged a political crisis to the point of defeat."
iran,397t02,f16falcon95,-1,Tue Jun 9 21:46:53 2015 UTC,I would rather Iran had no nuclear energy because it has a low net energy yield than conventional oil and has catastrophic environmental impacts if it has a meltdown.  Iran should invest in renewable energy.
iran,397t02,CYAXARES_II,3,Wed Jun 10 15:05:42 2015 UTC,"Nuclear energy is the most cost-effective way to produce electricity in Iran on an industrial scale. Hydroelectric, wind and solar don't even compare.  Once the sanctions are over and we go through the phase of confidence building for the next decade I hope Iran can build dozens of more nuclear power plants so that we will never be dependent on oil, gas, or coal for energy ever again.  When our national energy needs are met and we are overproducing we can export energy to our energy hungry neighbors. It is only then can we start investing huge funds in alternative forms of energy to supplement nuclear energy."
iran,397t02,f16falcon95,2,Thu Jun 11 03:35:54 2015 UTC,I don't agree with you.
iran,397t02,CYAXARES_II,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:19:13 2015 UTC,"It's not a matter of agreeing/disagreeing, it's the reality we face today. Renewable energy isn't even economical for high developed nations let alone Iran. Before we can run we first have to learn to walk.  Iran doesn't have the rivers for hydroelectric, nor the funds to rely on solar or wind for its needs. We need a clean, economical way to meet our energy needs and with the current technology the only answer is nuclear power."

Some people may not be aware of this, but Uzbekistan leased a base to the United States after 9/11. At that time Uzbekistan was hoping to see gains from allying itself more strongly with the US, but years later after suppressing an anti-government protest in Ferghana, the dictator Islom Karimov became paranoid that the US was spreading ""democracy""/regime-change into Uzbekistan and simply kicked the US military out of Uzbekistan as well as shutting down all NGO's.  Edit - More information on the Andijan massacre: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andijan_massacre"
iran,3911fo,marmulak,4,Mon Jun 8 15:30:21 2015 UTC,"Uzbekistan looks like a slave to Russia only when it's beneficial to Uzbekistan. The only positive thing about Uzbekistan government is that it plays like a fox in the politics with the imperialist countries like Russia and USA, with only goal to minimize chances of bringing Uzbekistan to its knees by starting civil war like it happened in many third world countries.  The reason Uzbekistan let US have a base on its territory was because they wanted Americans to eliminate Taliban and all other violent groups as much as possible, including some Uzbek extremists who joined Taliban in fighting against Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan governments. Taliban and others are sure to start a war with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan if they succeed in taking over Afghanistan one day, which they almost did in 90s.  Nowadays, US and Uzbekistan relations are warming up again. Western world is trying to ignore Ferghana massacre to gain from cooperating in other fields as usual, and Uzbekistan is welcoming this approach."

The West is very proficient in 'collecting' what many in India now call 'atrocity literature', and when the time comes to actually do their stuff (read: invade, or sanctions, or anything against a country), it just pulls a trigger which releases all this stuff (i.e., 'negative' material about the target country, and this 'negative' material can be false, true, pulled out of their ass, or anything), which becomes the 'reason' to invade it.

iran,392630,KingJamesX,4,Wed Jun 10 07:29:07 2015 UTC,"The best thing is immersion + instruction, in my experience. My first exposures to Farsi were hanging around people who spoke it, and it really made me want to learn it more. Then I started out by asking friends to teach me things, and slowly slowly I built a small vocabulary and repertoire of phrases. It was really slow going until I went to school and took a formal class, which made things like the grammar and verb tenses much more clear. After that it was just practice practice practice... looking words up in the dictionary all the time, reading poems and short stories together with my Persian teacher, and chatting with Iranians online.  When I started taking classes, I basically attended class for 4.5 hours a week, plus more hours in the summer (it was a summer-based program). After about two years of that I was nearly fluent, but did not have enough speaking and listening practice. I can just remember certain times when people would be explaining something to me in Farsi, and I'd be thinking, ""Oh shit, I understand what he's saying!"" However, I was not so comfortable speaking until I moved to Tajikistan and met my wife. Since we only speak to each other in Farsi, the daily practice pretty much sealed the deal. I also learned all the weird local Tajik slang and stuff, and I can actually read Tajik Cyrillic faster than I can read Farsi now, which is a little embarrassing, but it's 100% phonetic so it's just easier.  I recommend other people follow the same route is me, which is get a good teacher if you can find one, and practice with your friends as much as you can. (Also, marry a Persian speaker.) It's not all about instruction or all about practice, but getting a balance of the two where they reinforce each other. There are some books and websites you can check out to help you.  Also, I don't hesitate to suggest that if you can't find enough Farsi resources, try studying Turkish. That might sound funny to some people, but let's face it... Turkish has better availability of quality learning resources, and what Turkish will do for you is introduce you to vital grammatical concepts and vocabulary that are shared with Persian. For example, they both share the same overall sentence structure (Subject-Object-Verb), use possessive suffixes, the same definite/indefinite usage of nouns and plurals, accusative case for definite direct objects, and so on. Their verb tenses tend to be similar, and they have the same number and types of pronouns (ben=man, sen=to, o=u, biz=mâ, siz=şomâ, onlar=ânhâ) and corresponding verb endings, which all lack gender. They even share a similar phonology, to the point where you can write Farsi completely using the Turkish alphabet if you wanted (with the addition of ""x"", which all Turkish keyboards have anyway). In some cases Turkish and Farsi even have the same compound verbs, like ""xoş âmadid"" and ""hoş geldiniz"" are literally the same phrase. As for the shared vocabulary, one need not mention the hundreds (or thousands?) of words that Turkish borrowed from Persian. They both share the same pool of extended/advanced vocabulary that developed among educated people in the Orient.  Turkish is on Duolingo and also there is a great course set for it on Memrise that you can dabble with casually. If you're an absolute beginner in with Farsi, a few weeks with Turkish will prime your brain to learn Farsi more quickly. Also if you knew both languages, which is perfectly doable, you'd have some neat travel opportunities and experiences."

iran,392630,apunebolatumerilaila,3,Tue Jun 9 08:00:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, basically. In Urdu most texts tend to be written in Nasta'liq, which is a highly calligraphic style used in Persian only occasionally because it's simply harder to read and write. However, that should make it easier for people educated in Urdu to switch over to Farsi than vice versa."
iran,392630,marmulak,2,Tue Jun 9 08:29:33 2015 UTC,"In the British Museum I went to the section on Mughal Empire. I started reading a stone plaque ""Shehenshah Akbar...""

Just by looking at the script I couldn't tell it was a different language."
iran,392630,DisgruntledPersian,2,Tue Jun 9 11:37:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks. So if I wanted to learn Farsi, should I begin studying Urdu first? Will that be helpful (since Urdu and Hindi are pretty similar in structure)?"
iran,392630,7kent,2,Tue Jun 9 14:01:44 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be a bad idea. If your Urdu is good, you'll basically have a big head start in Farsi to the point where you'll surpass other students who are absolute beginners quickly."
iran,392630,jnits,3,Tue Jun 9 14:43:52 2015 UTC,"Music would help, listening to Farsi music just to get yourself use to the sound of the language would be very helpful. At least it works for me when I want to learn or get acquainted with a language I don't have any familiarity with."

I hired a tutor who I see once a week - this is very helpful for specific questions and keeping me involved in the process.  A year later, I was still disappointed with my progress and started an Anki deck which helps me study daily.  I can share this with you if you like, but in general the Anki deck has helped me a lot and I am understanding a lot more since I started expanding my vocabulary.

Everyone I knew and everything/place I missed is different. I only have memories left for myself. When (yes, when, because you will have to come back to Iran one day to prove this is real) you come back to Iran some day to revive your memories, you will realize there is nothing left to reconnect with at old home anymore. My mindset/mentality has changed, yours will too and you won't wait another month to leave Iran forever.   The best thing for you is to be in a place to make roots in US, and find friends you can trust. Get a stable job/career rolling. Get in school if needed. It will be difficult, but doable. Don't move from one city/state to another every few years like I did in search of a dream place. If you find at least one person you can relate and socialize from your own diaspora, that will get you going and help you with nostalgic feelings you have now.  So, when you come back to Iran, it will be easier for you to leave it again, because you will already have good memories, job, friends, hobbies, and maybe a family, in US by then.  Good luck!"
iran,38z5vw,7kent,5,Mon Jun 8 10:33:48 2015 UTC,"This is sort of unrelated, but while my wife and I were in Uzbekistan, people kept asking if (or telling us that) there were a lot of Uzbeks in the US. Apparently everyone in Uzbekistan has a friend or family member that went to the US, so when they found out I'm from the US they'd ask me this stuff. ""Are there lots of Uzbeks in USA?"" Me: ""No, not really."" Other person: ""No, there are! My cousin lives there!"" Me: ""Yes, there are some."" lol  The USA is good, and I probably will go back one day, but if living abroad has changed anything for me, it's that I now believe in a globalized world much more than I did before."

I always wonder if the globalization is doing any good to these countries who just want the world to leave them alone. I think the mindset should be the key. Until it changes, these nations will suffer a lot."

So when I (reluctantly!) moved again, I tried to remind myself that I was missing memories, which are not there as /u/IranRPCV said.   Heck, even after college in Iran when most my friends had moved on or emigrated, Tehran was not like it used to be any more. So honestly, in the past 8 years I have not missed Iran as much even though I never even went back for a visit.

Iran doesn't care about the KRG's status as an independent state or semi-autonomous republic.

iran,38ydad,TILopisafag,8,Mon Jun 8 02:21:42 2015 UTC,"I was referring to the Caspian Report channel in general. This video seemed to be fine, but some of his other videos involving Iran, tend to have a slight negative bias.  As for historical accuracy, these were the historical inaccuracies someone found on of the other videos on the channel: Islamic Conquest of Persia   He starts off by incorrectly stating that the Roman Empire was replaced by the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantines were Roman and considered themselves Romans. The ""Byzantine"" identity was an invention by historians of the 18th(?) century, and is considered nonsense by most historians today, other than a word to identify Eastern Rome.  He gets the maps of the conquests of the Rashidun Caliphate wrong. He's coloured Mazandaran green, signalling it was conquered when the Islamic armies broke through the Zagros mountain range. Mazandaran was one of the only districts that wasn't conquered by the Islamic armies. A lot of Sassanid aristocrats fled to Mazandaran, and the Arab armies were unable to break through the mountain barriers surrounding it. For reference, Mazandaran is the only grey area in Iran's boundaries in this map - where it correctly shows it wasn't conquered  When he talks about the Islamification of Persia, he gets a few more things wrong. He incorrectly insists that Zoroastrianism wasn't an organized religion in this period when it absolutely was. It was in the Achaemenid period that Zoroastrianism wasn't an organized religion, but Zoroastrianism was the State religion of the Sassanids, and they marginalized (if not destroyed) the Zoroastrian sects other than their own. Then he uses this bogus ""non-organized religious philosophy"" explanation to say ""Zoroastrianism was for the elites but neglected by the majority of the population"". The popularity of Zoroastrianism was in decline because the institution was becoming increasingly seen as corrupted and alienating from the people. Furthermore, he claims Iranians converted to Islam en masse because w0w Arabs good no killing w0w Islam so similar to Zoroastrianism (even though Iranians didn't even practice Zoroastrianism, apparently). This is all nonsense. Firstly, Islam did not flourish in Iran until the Abbasid era where - Iranians playing an active role in establishing them in Baghdad - where Iranians were incorporated into government, the military, administration and so forth. In fact, the Abbasids were patrons of Persian culture. During the Umayyad era, the majority of Iranians did not become Muslim until the ninth century, one reason being that dhimmis were a source of income for the caliphate. He incorrectly states that they weren't heavily taxed after the Islamic conquests, when they were. The jizya was imposed on the population, which was a hefty tax on non-Muslims. Inheritance Laws were also changed to favour family members who were Muslim. Zoroastrians were given dhimmi status and subjected to persecutions; discrimination and harassment began in the form of violence. Zoroastrians were made to pay an extra tax called Jizya, failing which they were either killed, enslaved or imprisoned. Those paying Jizya were subjected to insults and humiliation by the tax collectors. Zoroastrians who were captured as slaves in wars were given their freedom if they converted to Islam. This, along with the perceived corruption of the Zoroastrian institutions, led to a lot of converts to Islam. A combination of violence and socioeconomic incentives were what really forced Iranians to embrace Islam.  ~MB"

iran,38x2nt,finchfinch,10,Sun Jun 7 16:00:13 2015 UTC,"I learned the Tehrāni accent, and it's basically the standard minus the colloquialisms. What I mean is that things like substituting ""u"" for ""ā"" (like ""nun"" instead of ""nān"") is something you avoid when speaking ""properly"", but generally it's pretty much the same accent.  Esfahānis have a lot of weird things in their accent, although the most famous is that they say ""es"" instead of ""e"", so ""xubes"" instead of ""xube"". Also they use an uncommon verb, something like ""sotudan"" (I think) to mean ""to take"". So they will say ""bestun"" instead of ""begir"". My ostād was esfahāni, but he didn't teach me his regional accent.  My favorite sounding accent is still the Tehrāni accent, but sometimes it's really cute when Tajiks talk. I can tell you a little bit about the Dushanbe accent, which probably deserves a full length article. Off the top of my head:   Most Tajiks say ""ay"" (like English ""aye"") in place of ""ast"", similar to how Tehrānis say ""e"" and Esfahānis say ""es"". ""Ay"" also is frequently a stand-in for ""az"" (of). Instead of saying ""xub"", Tajiks use adjectives that aren't common in standard Iranian Persian, such as ""tenj"" and ""naghz"". If you want to be really vulgar, ""xar"" (donkey) is slang for saying something is cool or awesome, so you can be all like ""moshinam xar ay"" (My car is donkey) Tajiks post-fix ""da"" the same way Turkish does, principally meaning ""dar"", but also having a connotation of ""at"". Also like Turkish, it is used together with other words of location where in standard Persian it's unnecessary: ""Kujodayi"" means ""where are you?"" (lit. ""Where are you at?"") Even when simply using ""dar"", Tajiks will use it in the same sense, for example: ""Dar kujoyi?"" Tajik has a different verb tense for an act that's in progress and already started. In Iran, people use ""dāshtan"" to indicate this, so ""dāram miravam"" means ""I'm going"" or ""I'm in the middle of going"". In Tajik, the present perfect tense is used plus the verb istādan, so ""man rafta istoda am"" means the same thing, often shortened simply to ""man raftistam"". A very commonly heard phrase is ""chi kardisti?"" or ""chi kardistay?"" meaning ""what are you doing"" and ""what is he doing?"" respectively. (Speaking of which, if you want to get into super slang, ""cho kadi?"" means like ""what's up!?"") Tajiks say ""ha"" instead of ""bale"" or ""āre"". There are regional variants like ""owa"" and ""ho"". Similarly, ""nay"" (just like in English) is often used instead of ""na"", or similarly ""neya"". If you hear a particular word and don't understand it, there's a 90% it's either Russian or Uzbek. 10% it's a real Persian word you're just not educated enough to know about. Sometimes ""dāshtan"" is progressive. ""Turo dūst medoram"" is a commonly known phrase, as opposed to ""duset dāram"" in Iran. Various words, especially with Arabic roots, have near equivalents. For example, Tajiks say ""kifoya"" instead of ""kāfi"", or ""aqib"" instead of ""aqab"". There are many more, but they will be easy for you to pick up on your own. Sometimes they goof up big words by using a similar sounding word or a mistaken pronunciation that becomes widespread, like saying ""maslihat"" instead of ""nasihat"", or ""mutoj"" instead of ""mutod"".   If you keep the above points in mind, that may prevent you from being hopelessly confused when you visit Tajikistan."
iran,38x2nt,marmulak,7,Sun Jun 7 17:53:16 2015 UTC,"but sometimes it's really cute when Tajiks talk.   Tajiks talking does sound cute to my Tehrani ears.

I don't have any historical evidence for this yet but it sounds natural to me why they still have ""s"" sound given that Tehrani ""e"" was grammaticalized version of ""ist"". The use of ""istaadan"" as progressive tense is really interesting too. I will have to look into it more.    By the way if things go well I might have a chance to visit Iran this summer. If that happens I will definitely visit Tajakistan, too! What place other than Dushanbe would you recommend?"
iran,38x2nt,marmulak,2,Mon Jun 8 05:16:04 2015 UTC,"There aren't too many places in Tajikistan to visit, so Dushanbe is definitely a good place to go. There's parks and museums and stuff, but it's not a very historical area. I visited Kulob once, which is a much older city whose name was formerly Khatlon. (Khatlon is now the name of the province in which Kulob resides.) Kulob is even less interesting than Dushanbe, but it houses the shrine of Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani. Between Dushanbe and Kulob is Norak, which is a beautiful little place with lakes and red rock. Also near Dushanbe is Varzob, a popular vacation spot for locals.  Khujand is in the nicest part of the country, and unlike the south of Tajikistan was not devastated by war, so it's a fairly decent place. Tourists who are into seeing Tajikistan's mountainous nature all travel to Badakhshan, which is semi-autonomous and requires a special permit to visit. Also I heard there are some ancient sites around Panjakent, but it's only something I've read about.  Between Dushanbe and Khujand is a pretty cool scenic drive. If you take a long detour from that path you can see Iskanderkul, which is the famous lake in Tajikistan."
iran,38x2nt,marmulak,2,Mon Jun 8 08:42:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I appreciate for all these explanations.    Sounds like I might need to learn about their culture to really enjoy traveling in there, especially not touristy areas. But the nature in Tajikistan alone seem worth visiting to me. They are so different from where I grew up and there is something that attracts me.    I'll keep in mind about the lake Iskanderkul. It would make a fabulous picnic there."

Each ""section"" is like the size of a whole western supermarket with like 50 vendors all selling the same thing.  In Panjshanbe I didn't see any signs, but the size and activity shocked me. You walk into the bazaar area, and there's constantly people wheeling cartfuls of stuff past you like they're in a hurry. I remember we walked through a hallway and ended up in a building that felt like it was almost the size of a football field, and almost everyone in it was selling primarily bread. o_o"

For example, Kermāni accent can be a little hard to understand the first few minutes until you get the pattern.  Also there are some languages like Azeri, Gliaki, Kurdi and Lori spoken in different parts of Iran. Though they have a lot in common with Persian, some argue that they are different languages. And when they speak Persian they have a distinguishable ""accent"".  All these accents can be ""cool"" if the person is cool. Where I live(Tehran suburbs) There are a lot of Azeris(or Turks in general) and Shomalis. So there is no exotic factor to make them cool.

Bush referred to Cyrus, declaring that his people had ""the right to worship God in freedom""[42] – a statement made nowhere in the text of the Cylinder.   According to this reference link, the first line of the Cyrus Cylinder refers to Marduk as ""king of the whole of heaven and earth"". The cylinder specifically mentions that Marduk chose Cyrus to rule over Babylon. According to Wikipedia, lines 34 and 35 of the cylinder contain ""a prayer to Marduk on behalf of Cyrus and his son Cambyses""."
iran,38unir,marmulak,3,Sun Jun 7 09:33:45 2015 UTC,So would this still make him a monotheist as OP states?
iran,38unir,myazdani93,2,Sun Jun 7 21:17:15 2015 UTC,"Well it's possible that Cyrus didn't really worship Marduk, but this was his way of showing to the people of Babylon that he was their rightful ruler by borrowing their gods. Back then this was a very common tactic, and the Hittites used it as well. (The Hittites had a pantheon of their own gods that were proto-Greek, and everywhere they conquered they honored the local divinities and added them to their pantheon.)  I don't know if it would be possible to ascertain Cyrus' personal beliefs beyond a doubt, but he may have been Zoroastrian. However, it seems to me that Cyrus' rule predates the adoption of Zoroastrianism by the Persian empire. Wikipedia says about the Achaemenid Empire:   It was during the Achaemenid period that Zoroastrianism reached South-Western Iran, where it came to be accepted by the rulers and through them became a defining element of Persian culture. The religion was not only accompanied by a formalization of the concepts and divinities of the traditional Iranian pantheon but also introduced several novel ideas, including that of free will.[138][139]      Under the patronage of the Achaemenid kings, and by the 5th century BCE as the de facto religion of the state, Zoroastrianism reached all corners of the empire.   About Cyrus the Great:   Though it is generally believed that Zarathushtra's teachings maintained influence on Cyrus's acts and policies, so far no clear evidence has been found to indicate that Cyrus practiced a specific religion. Pierre Briant wrote that given the poor information we have, ""it seems quite reckless to try to reconstruct what the religion of Cyrus might have been.""[96] His liberal and tolerant views towards other religions have made some scholars consider Cyrus a Zoroastrian king.[97] Other scholars[who?] emphasize the fact that Cyrus is known only to have honored non-Zoroastrian gods.   So based on what little information we have, Zoroastrianism became the de facto religion in the Persian empire some time around Cyrus' rule, possibly during or after. Iranians believed in a pantheon of their own gods prior to that, and it's possible that in many cases Zoroastrianism was mixed with Iranian polytheism.  Also there is a question about whether Zoroastrianism is truly monotheistic, but that continues to be debated. The later popularity of monotheism may have influenced Zoroastrianism into becoming more monotheistic as you see it today, although the Greeks noted even during the time of Herodotus that the Persians seemed to dislike idol worship.  From the article Zoroastrianism:   The religious philosophy of Zoroaster divided the early Iranian gods.[5] The most important texts of the religion are those of the Avesta.[6] In Zoroastrianism, the multifacted creator Ahura Mazda, through the Spenta Mainyu (Good Spirit)[7] is an all-good ""father"" of Asha (Truth, “order, justice,"")[8][9] in opposition to Druj (“falsehood, deceit”)[10][11] and no evil originates from it.[12] ""He"" and his works are evident to humanity through the six primary Amesha Spentas[13] and the host of other Yazatas, through whom worship of Mazda is ultimately directed. The forces of Spenta Mainyu adjoined unto ""truth""[14] oppose the Spirit's opposite,[15][16] Angra Mainyu and its forces born of Akəm Manah (“evil thinking”).[17] Zoroastrianism has no major theological divisions, but it is not uniform. Modern-era influences have a significant impact on individual and local beliefs, practices, values and vocabulary, sometimes merging with tradition and in other cases displacing it.[18]"

The second link doesn't sound unlike our traditional music. Here is a tune played on a bouzouki called Pipe on the Hob, Cliffs of Moher.   Your third link is just cool.  What is popular these days in Iran?"
iran,38s9jp,tinlizzey12,5,Sat Jun 6 11:37:37 2015 UTC,"Depends on your age group I guess -- underground metal death rock is ""banned"" so it is popular. Rap is also popular. No accounting for taste...not even in Iran.  Here, take some shrooms and check this out, the music and animation of architecture is cool https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc9t50C7WOU  The Persian Ney is beautifully haunting https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BQPLZhwOLo Probably matches an Irish instrument. They even have bagpipes there https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnZVpaKaw0Y&index=2&list=RD4pmDEWcEetA"
iran,38s9jp,Tech46,3,Sat Jun 6 11:53:55 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the Ney, that sounds pretty different from anything we have here, closest in traditional music is probably the tin whistle or a recorder. You might like The Lonesome Boatman.  Bagpipes are a Scottish invention but we have Uilleann Pipes (ILL-IN) here in Ireland that are very similar."
iran,38s9jp,tinlizzey12,4,Sat Jun 6 12:18:18 2015 UTC,"Bagpipes are a Scottish invention    lol - no. I just showed you a video of the traditional bagpipe from Iran. The Irish also had bagpipes, it wasn't a Scottish thing exclusively  The closest match to the persian Ney is the reed flute which is Celtic. There's a connection between the Celts and Persians too, as both are IndoEuropean tongues"
iran,38s9jp,Tech46,5,Sat Jun 6 12:31:10 2015 UTC,"Figure of speech really, most instruments originally migrated from Africa / middle-east anyhow.   In the west bagpipes would be associated with Scotland, and Ireland get's the ""blame"" for that sometimes as some people's geography wouldn't be so great. You are quite right, bagpipes were invented in your neck of the woods, and we have something similar."

But I'm sure more than one sheep herder around the world who was lonely decided that storing  puffed air in a sack was more convenient than constantly huffing and puffing into a flute lol!

Good weather, still plenty of snow on the mountains for skiing, Nowruz(New Years) celebrations, and just a lot of festivities around this time.    It depends on the city.  Shiraz is a very famous cultural city which has a variety of historical stuff in the city or nearby.    Some examples of Shiraz sights are Eram Garden, Arg-e Karim, and Persepolis(which is 50-60km from the city center)"

But (at least from the outside) your government seems fairly repressive.  What is your view of the Iranian system of government, in comparison to  more liberal systems of government around the world? Would you remove the influence of religious figures if you could?"
iran,38s9jp,Elite-Kuntposter,10,Sat Jun 6 20:33:54 2015 UTC,"Of course. When Iran had a revolution in 1979 to overthrow the king, the majority of the resistance groups were socialists or pro democracy. The revolution was hijacked by ayatolla khomeini because of how he was able to rally the poor and rural folk, nobody expected a theocracy. Such is life I guess."

iran,38s9jp,TILopisafag,16,Sat Jun 6 12:46:25 2015 UTC,"There are two reasons people state they are Persian:   All Persians are Iranian, but not all Iranians are Persian.  Only 60% of the people in Iran are Persian, so it could be to denote ethnicity over nationality.  Kurds, Gilakis, Azeris, etc are all Iranian people. (Most Likely) It sounds a lot better to foreigners.  Iranian/Iran often have a negative connotation in foreign countries, so people use Persian as it is technically correct, yet sounds better."

iran,38s9jp,tinlizzey12,3,Sat Jun 6 16:08:58 2015 UTC,"Some people call themselves Persian because for some reason they want to emphasize their particular ethnicity, some because they just don't want to deal with the negative baggage that comes from calling yourself Iranian.

Some of our Ski resorts are open at least 6 months out of the year, as we get Ski-able snowfall from November to  June in the mountains.   Talking about snow, the worst snowstorm/blizzard in history occured in Iran in 1972. While on nature, we have jungles/rainforests. We had a democracy until the US/UK removed it for not becoming a puppet of the cold war. There are dozens of active synagogues in Tehran.

I'm just going to shoot out a few things I'm confused about:   Would you describe yourselves as Persian, and why the hell not? That seems like such a cool heritage to have! Is it a political issue? The news (I watch Al Jazeera) does not seem flattering of Iran. In fact, Iran almost seems opposed to the Western world. In the r/Ireland thread, u/Elite-Kuntposter said:    We may be a muslim majority country, but we have nothing to do with other muslim countries, be it turkish or arab or paki etc. Our histories are different from theirs, as is our ideologies.   So what's the deal? Are you seperate from the Middle East?   Would you describe yourselves as a conservative, or as a liberal society and why? What kind of problems is your country dealing with right now? What's everyone talking about over there?   I know that these questions are oversimplifying Iran's complex issues. Answer however you can, any insight is appreciated! :-D"
iran,38s9jp,DisgruntledPersian,9,Sat Jun 6 13:54:07 2015 UTC,"See name  Al Jazeera is not a trustworthy news source on Iran since it is run by a Gulf Arab state (Qatar) which has a very anti- Iran bias. It's like Fox. Also what I took from that quote is that it's a statement about how Iranians are an entirely separate ethnicity from Turks or Arabs ect, our customs are vastly different, as is our history.  It's difficult to say. The inner capital and some major cities like Shiraz are quite liberal, but there are also conservative cities like Qom or Mashhad to name a couple  Sanctions. Daesh.

From photographs I have seen of your country it looks very vibrant and beautiful. The mountains beyond Tehran form an amazing image, and I understand you have an incredible variety of scenery within your borders! I would love to visit some day.  The modern state of Ireland is a young nation, founded on some very romantic and poetic ideals that peaked in the past two centuries. Iran has an ancient history, at least to my knowledge - a font of civilisation since ancient times, with groups such as the Achaemenids and Seleucids, Parthians and Sassanids, the great Caliphates and the Turkic empires of the Seljuqs and the Timurids. My question is: how much do you feel your history affects modern society in Iran? Does it contribute to modern politics and culture?"
iran,38s9jp,rezsahin,6,Sat Jun 6 22:28:56 2015 UTC,"Of course, Iran's legacy as one of the world's oldest enduring civilization has undoubtedly shaped its identity and is evident in modern politics and culture.   Unlike other countries in the region, Iran's existence has been shaped and sustained by its own people. Despite many conquests and different dynasties (even of different ethnic stock, such as the Greeks, Arabs, and Turks), Iran has managed to preserve its culture and language by absorbing and subsuming the culture of its invaders. Its borders, still unlike the other countries, were drawn by Iranians and therefore aren't arbitrary foreign creations. It's also important to note that unlike other older civilizations, Iran managed to remain free from being colonized by European powers during the Colonial Era.   It is this nature of robustness and resilience that shapes Iranian policy towards the rest of the world. It also explains the mindset behind the events that took place in the 20th century. In that Iranians view themselves as independent and distinct; unwilling to be subordinate to the East or West. Although the modern state of Iran can trace itself back 500 years to the Safavids, various elements in Iranian culture predate Islam by thousands of years: such as the New Year's celebration (Nowruz), and even Zoroastrian influences in Shi'a rituals."
iran,38s9jp,WyselRillard,2,Sun Jun 7 02:28:25 2015 UTC,even Zoroastrian influences in Shi'a rituals.   Like what?
iran,38s9jp,marmulak,13,Sun Jun 7 22:55:59 2015 UTC,"A little known fact about me is that I am part Irish. In my readings about Iran and Iranians, I discovered that there is some historical link between Celtic and Iranian people. The reason for this is that in ancient times the Celtic domain spanned across all of Europe, and the eastern extent of Europe bordered Iranian territory. At least one Iranian tribe, namely the Alans, journeyed far west into Europe.  I don't know to what extent Celts and Iranians interacted, but I read that Arthurian legend in Britain, though commonly thought of as English, has its roots in Celtic folklore. In other words, the legends are Celtic in origin. Comparison between these legends and Iranian legend revealed some very striking similarities, with some stories having nearly identical content.  Irish Gaelic is the most spoken living Celtic language today, and those who are interested in learning it can check it out on Duolingo.  I encourage the Irish, as fellow Indo-Europeans, to study the Persian language and learn more about their eastern brethren."
iran,38s9jp,QueLogico,6,Sat Jun 6 11:45:14 2015 UTC,"Irish Gaelic is the most spoken living Celtic language today,   Actually, that would be Welsh.  (Although I believe that the Welsh figures are massaged a bit.)"
iran,38s9jp,marmulak,8,Sat Jun 6 16:55:06 2015 UTC,"I just skimmed their Wikipedia articles, and it seems to me that Welsh has more native speakers, but Irish L2 speakers alone outnumber Welsh speakers."
iran,38s9jp,QueLogico,5,Sat Jun 6 17:01:20 2015 UTC,"If the situation in Ireland is similar to Wales, then anyone who can say 'bore da' is considered an L2 speaker.  I'd trust the figures on native speakers a little bit more."

iran,38s9jp,Tech46,2,Sat Jun 6 17:25:37 2015 UTC,"Does that figure include those outside Ireland who speak Irish, because there are whole areas outside Ireland that have better Irish than people actually in Ireland. Newfoundland for example, and some Irish - Americans learn it to get back to their roots, which is a huge number. (Many American universities have classes in the language)  TLDR - In terms of worldwide speakers Irish has a much larger number than Welsh. Not as a native language though."
iran,38s9jp,QueLogico,3,Sat Jun 6 17:27:18 2015 UTC,"I was just talking about native speakers.  I don't know of any Irish-speaking communities outside Ireland, but I'm definitely not an expert [EDIT: I should have looked.  Wikipedia says ""figures released for the period 2006-2008 show that 22,279 Americans spoke Irish at home.""].  I hadn't even heard of Newfoundland Irish, but Wikipedia says ""There is no evidence of any attempt to revive a specifically Newfoundland form of Irish"".  Obviously the Irish diaspora is significantly larger than the Welsh diaspora (although there are still a few thousand Welsh speakers in Patagonia), but I'm not sure how many of them have kept the tongue.  In fact, I believe a lot of them already spoke English when they left Ireland."
iran,38s9jp,Tech46,6,Sat Jun 6 17:34:15 2015 UTC,They definitely speak English as a first language in Newfoundland but a considerable amount do speak Irish. I've been there and was very taken aback.

In Ireland we learn about classical Greek and Roman civilisation (history for everyone and some study the languages), as well as some of our own pre-history (Celts). Is it something that is generally looked upon with pride? Or is there something of a taboo/ignorance about the early empires.   If you do study it, is the language important? Or more a general study of dates and customs, poets etc? How different is ancient Persian Farsi to modern Farsi? Do you consider yourselves Persian or Iranian first?   I read Persian Fire and it is one of my favourite books. Have any of you read it? Could you recommend similar books, in English please!!  Lastly, does Ireland register at all in your country?   edit: just to add there are a lot of Iranians in class in uni, they are one of the most generous and gracious hosts I have ever met.

I met this guy when I was studying in the USA, he was a professor of Marketing at the college I was studying at. For some reason, he seemed to really like the Irish too, so much so he had a Derry GAA (Gaelic sport) flag sitting in his office that he had got from another student who also happened to be from Derry. He even offered me to come around for dinner for Thanksgiving. I've not since come into contact with any other Iranians (apart from his son, who was a great guy too), but he really set the scene for me, you guys seem awesome.

iran,38s9jp,trinitage,10,Sat Jun 6 23:53:13 2015 UTC,"Alcohol has been a staple drink in Iran for millenia, particularly beer and wine. Apparently one custom for Iranians during the Persian empire was that when they making a decision, they would do it both sober and drunk just to make sure. I'll need to find the source for that again.  Tbh, I find it hard not to find alcohol in Iran. The penalties for alcohol consumption are very harsh but there doesn't seem to be a shortage, although imported drinks will be priced a lot higher.   One of the most common drinks is the homemade drink called Arak Saggy(basically the equivalent of moonshine), cause it's cheap and gets you pretty drunk.  Also, you'd be surprised at how many religious Muslims drinks, not only in Iran but around the Middle east :P. For example, iirc the government recently funded a rehab program for alcoholics.  I grew up in Ireland, and what I think is one of the main reasons for Iranians and Irish kids drinking a lot is that in many parts there can be very little to do. Which in Iran has also resulted in lots of sex. In fact, recently in my smallish hometown 6 ppl (3 girls 3 boys) got caught in an orgy lol."

iran,38s9jp,Garlic_and_Onion,8,Sat Jun 6 17:41:01 2015 UTC,"Multiple factors IMO.    As a culture we are very tolerant and its corrolate is hospitality. I mean despite having 6 major ethnicities, and multiple religions the people have never strayed away from peaceful coexistence. Btw, we have the most American/west friendly population in the region according to some polls. Since the revolution Iran has been kinda closed off so people rejoice at the sight of foreigners. In line with above, they are just very curious. And they want to practice their English. Some of them know how terrible an image our country has so they strive to change that through hospitality."

In Iran, there are not a lot of tourists, but I did see a fair few Germans and Spaniards, as well as a handful of others (British, Australian, Chinese, etc).  It was funny when I was in Shiraz for four days because as I travelled around the museums and palaces, I ended up seeing the same 20-30 Westerners everywhere I went.  EDIT:  I forgot to say, the process has changed since I last went and I believe British citizens now have to go through authorised tour agencies.

iran,38s9jp,seantack,3,Sun Jun 7 07:17:52 2015 UTC,"Hi there, maybe someone could shed some light on my question to Iranians? Years ago I heard that there was a connection between Iran and Ireland and specifically numbers. In Gaelic (Irish), numbers 1-10 are:  1.Aon / 2.Dó / 3.Trí / 4.Ceathair / 5.Cúig / 6.Sé / 7. Seacht / 8.Ocht / 9.Naoi /10.Deich  While similarities aren't apparent to all languages, some numbers have are very alike. Number 2 (Dó) in Iran's Middle Persian - dō, Parthian - dō, Kurdish-Kurmanji - dû, Persian - do, Tajik- du, and Balochi - Do.  In particular, Number 4 which in Irish is quite a unique word -Ceathair- is also similar in several Iranian languages.  Avestan - chathwar. Middle Persian - čahār. Parthian - čafār. Sogdian - čatfār. Persian - cahâr. Tajik - çahor. Shughni - cavōr. Zazaki - çehar.  I also see similarities in the numbers 6 - Sé, 9 - Naoi and 10 - Deich.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_numbers_in_various_languages#Iranian_languages  It's always fascinated me but I've never really looked into it in great detail. I imagined Irish missionaries travelled and help develop the language but that's just a guess. It'd be great to hear of any other potential ideas about it. Thanks!"

Q2: This is what I have been told by Iranians who lived in Iran before-during and after the revolution. The thing is that you can't say if the revolution was a good thing in general since you have to approach this question from different point of views.  Conservative muslims: They think that the revolution was a good thing and they often look back to the times before the revolution as if America ruled Iran. Most of them only dislike the western governments, they have no hard feelings towards the citizens of these western countries.   Scholars: Most of them are indifferent, they dislike both the current and the former regime since both of the regimes were really violent. Most ""scholars"" will look back to the Mossadeq era as the last good president since he truly wanted to best for Iran. Mossadeq wanted to nationalise the oil and gas which angered England since the Anglo Persian oil company (later to become BP) worked the oil fields and collected 70-80% of the revenue. This resulted in England (falsely) telling Eisenhower (US P.M.) that Mossadeq was receiving funds from the sovjets. England and America orchestrated a coupé together which resulted in the creation of the Iranian monarchy installing the father of the last sjah as the ruler of Iran.   http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Mossadeq https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuJACEC0f2g  Adolescents: Teenagers in Iran try to live a western lifestyle and thus will probably like think that the Iranian monarchy was better then the current Islamic regime since the Iranian monarchy had close ties with the west and was very ""westernized"".  My opinion: I share the same opinion of the scholars, it all went to ""shit"" when England and America orchestrated a coupé together agains the democratic elected president Mossadeq. Mossadeq was a smart man and wanted the best for the Iranian people. The rule of the first sjah was ok, but the last sjah messed up since he was quite stubborn and was to much of a puppet to the west. Eisenhower messed up by knee-jerking when the british told him that Iran would become communist. Chances of Iran being a trust worthy ally to the west would have been way greater if they wouldn't have intervened when Mossadeq tried to nationalise the oil. Without the coupe there would have been no monarchy -> no revolution -> no islamic regime.

iran,38s9jp,juicewilson,2,Sat Jun 6 17:43:56 2015 UTC,"Iran–Iraq War:       The Iran–Iraq War was an armed conflict between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Iraq lasting from September 1980 to August 1988, making it the 20th century's longest conventional war.   It was initially referred to in English as the Gulf War prior to the Persian Gulf War of the early 1990s.   The Iran–Iraq War began when Iraq invaded Iran via air and land on 22 September 1980. It followed a long history of border disputes, and was motivated by fears that the Iranian Revolution in 1979 would inspire insurgency among Iraq's long-suppressed Shia majority as well as Iraq's desire to replace Iran as the dominant Persian Gulf state. Although Iraq hoped to take advantage of Iran's revolutionary chaos and attacked without formal warning, they made only limited progress into Iran and were quickly repelled; Iran regained virtually all lost territory by June 1982. For the next six years, Iran was on the offensive.  A number of proxy forces participated in the war, most notably the Iranian Mujahedin-e-Khalq siding with Ba'athist Iraq and Iraqi Kurdish militias of Kurdistan Democratic Party and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan siding with Iran—all suffering a major blow by the end of the conflict.  Despite calls for a ceasefire by the United Nations Security Council, hostilities continued until 20 August 1988. The war finally ended with Resolution 598, a U.N.-brokered ceasefire which was accepted by both sides. At the war's conclusion, it took several weeks for Iranian armed forces to evacuate Iraqi territory to honour pre-war international borders set by the 1975 Algiers Agreement.  The last prisoners of war were exchanged in 2003.    The war cost both sides in lives and economic damage: half a million Iraqi and Iranian soldiers, with an equivalent number of civilians, are believed to have died, with many more injured; however, the war brought neither reparations nor changes in borders. The conflict has been compared to World War I  :171 in terms of the tactics used, including large-scale trench warfare with barbed wire stretched across trenches, manned machine-gun posts, bayonet charges, human wave attacks across a no-man's land, and extensive use of chemical weapons such as mustard gas by the Iraqi government against Iranian troops, civilians, and Iraqi Kurds. The United States, alongside regional and international powers, supported Iraq with loans, military equipment and satellite imagery during Iraqi attacks against Iranian targets.   At the time of the conflict, the U.N. Security Council issued statements that ""chemical weapons had been used in the war."" U.N. statements never clarified that only Iraq was using chemical weapons, and according to retrospective authors ""the international community remained silent as Iraq used weapons of mass destruction against Iranian[s] as well as Iraqi Kurds.""

The Russian policy towards Iran is that it wants Iran strong enough to challenge US interests in the M.E., but not strong enough to challenge Russia for influence in Central Asia (which it might someday). The Russians voted in favor of Obama's sanctions a few years ago, and had to be nearly sued by Iran in order to deliver the S-300 systems that were purchased. I personally think Iran would be happy to return the favor and throw Russia under the bus (sell cheap energy to Europe), if the Western countries continue to become less hostile towards Iran.   That is my 2 cents. Now a question for you. What would be the best place for a tourist to visit in Lebanon? What is the attitude towards Iranians or Americans? I am Iranian-American to clarify."

iran,38obx8,marmulak,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:57:07 2015 UTC,"It also depends on how you define ""worship"". Usually the word worship carries connotations of venerating God, but in Islamic religion God is not the only thing that can or should be venerated or respected. For example, in the Qur'an, God commands Satan to bow down to Adam, and Satan fell from grace for refusing to do so. Elsewhere in the Qur'an, it instructs Muslims to ""lower"" themselves in humility toward their parents.  In Islam there is a rule that Muslims are free to do as they will as long as they don't violate God's rule by either a) doing something they were explicitly commanded not to do, or b) not doing something they were explicitly commanded to do. So, in order to prove that Muslims aren't allowed to do things like worship their ancestors, kiss graves, speak to the dead, and such, you have to show instances where the Qur'an or the Prophet forbade such an act. You can't just say it's forbidden because of broad assumptions or how you feel about it."

Many common people might not understand English well and you might have trouble communicating with them. Nevertheless I think most people will be happy to see some foreigners.

We are not monsters. We are also people like those you see in your own country. At least most of us are. :D As long as you are polite and respect our opinions, we tend to kindly return the favor.

They funded and supported Saddam in his savage campaign, paid and funded Pakistan and Turkey in supporting terrorism and creating ethnic tensions. Unfortunately U.S and western power are blinded by the facts that Saudi Arabia is a dangerous nation and is moving on similar path to Iraq, but this time it wont be as easy. Needless to say the Arabs are servant are the western nations. The only solution for Iran is to take positive steps in repairing its path with Europe and west and  compensate by negotiations, it is only then we will cut the hands of these savages."
iran,38lm4o,JustALittleSexyPush,4,Fri Jun 5 02:56:56 2015 UTC,"Uh no. As much as the KSA has exploitated the current shia-sunni divide in Syria and Iraq, they honestly aren't actually sectarian.

That's rather too simplistic. I agree with you that the attacks for instance on Shia in KSA just last week was bound to happen based on the anti-Shia rhetoric of many Saudi so called 'religious authorities', but that's more of a societal issue rather than an issue within the House of Saud. Geopolitics is honestly what moves KSA to support radical groups in Syria for instance, the want to grow their influence in the Middle East with militias (kind of like how Iran has grown their influence in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, with shia-based militias like Hezbollah). It's all about power brother.    If Iran were Sunni, this problem would not exist.   Maybeee.... Depends. If Iran were Sunni and still thought independently from KSA influence unlike basically all the other Sunni majority states in the Middle East and beyond even, then no. KSA would still have an issue with Iran, especially if Iran attempted to copy KSA and tried to become the leader of the Sunni world."

Iranians were nomadic tribes that come out of the steppes of Asia (if I am remembering correctly). They expanded into key areas like the Iranian plateau, which was previously inhabited by Elamites. When Iranians got their hands on the Middle East when they invaded Babylonia, that was a crucial moment in the establishment Iranian civilization.  Fast forward to the 10th century, and Turkic people came out of the East and did the same thing of conquering the locals in the Middle East and then adopting their civilization as well as contributing their own innovations."

Perhaps that refers to their religious background or if they lived in north region or south?  Larestani people. Due to the geographical characteristics of Fars and its proximity to the Persian Gulf it has long been a residing area for various peoples and rulers of Iran. However, the tribes of Fars including, Mamasani Lurs, Khamseh and Kohkiluyeh have kept their native and unique cultures and lifestyles which constitute part of the cultural heritage of Iran"

iran,38kd5z,pandorascube,2,Thu Jun 4 21:30:05 2015 UTC,"Well, most people from Iran, be it Persian, azari, Lori, etc generally identify as Iranian. But if they wanna be specific for the sake of knowing what part of Iran they're from or what other language they speak, they would say they're Azari for example. So yes, azari and kurdi are 'legit' terms to use if you're trying to be specific. The reason Persians dont go around saying they're parsi/Farsi is because everyone in Iran speaks Farsi, so there's not point in really specifying.  The only situation I recall where Ive specifically said or been called Farsi was when I met a group of Iranian Armenians. I was talking to them, and they said something along the lines of 'oh you're not armani, so you're just Farsi?'"
iran,38kd5z,QueLogico,2,Thu Jun 4 20:58:33 2015 UTC,"So there's not a specific term for the Persian ethnicity, then?   Indeed it seems to be very tied up with linguistic/cultural identity of ""Persephones"".   Also, was I right about Azeris and Kurds being specific 'real' terms to describe them?   Yes.  AFAIK the local terms are آذری (Azeri) and کورد (Kord).   P.S. Reddit says there's one more comment here, but I cannot see it. o.O   It's to do with the sub's moderation.

As Farsi became the most common ethnicity in Iran, almost half, they needed more specificity and cities and provinces gave their names. You will see differences in accent, habits and gastronomy, so these specification make sense. But the grammar and vocabulary are mostly identical."

All the ingredients are there, it just needs good management.

iran,38e9f3,derintellectual,0,Fri Jun 5 11:42:29 2015 UTC,"That's not necessarily true, at least not in her new book. I've read it. She actually claims multiple times that the majority of Muslims just wish to go about their lives.   What she is is anti-extremist. I personally doubt that Islam, as a religion, is capable of reform, because that would be considered heresy. So I think she is wrong in assuming that it is possible.  Secondly, I know she has an aggressive stance. But you need to understand her life and what she has been through. She obviously has a lot of pent up anger. Not necessarily an excuse, but the violence, threat and fear is something consistently felt by us ex-Muslims.  I don't support her aggressive attitude, but I agree that Muslims' ideology must change. I.e. not supporting the death penalty in cases of apostasy/blasphemy and adultery. I.e. Not forcing women into marriages (I know Iran is changing for the better, that article done in the financial times was really insightful) etc.   I don't know, I guess I just support a progressive, peaceful society where people aren't murdered for their personal choices."

iran,3881ii,AyaletSheked,5,Tue Jun 2 14:47:35 2015 UTC,Kasi midune chi migan? Faghat loghate 'Iron' mishenasam. That is what they call themselves.
iran,3881ii,rezsahin,5,Tue Jun 2 15:06:40 2015 UTC,"They are saying: If you are an Ossete, you have to speak your mother tongue (Ossetian)! A noble message for all Iranians."
iran,3881ii,QueLogico,5,Tue Jun 2 15:37:33 2015 UTC,"It would be great to have a translation, if there are any Ossetians reading this... :-)  The comments in the other thread mention cognates with Persian.  Has anyone been able to pick any out?  Presumably 'Iron' is one?  They apparently call their land 'Iryston' too."
iran,3881ii,rezsahin,6,Tue Jun 2 17:02:22 2015 UTC,"Not an Ossete, but I have studied their language so I can give you a very rough translaiton.  The title, Кæд дæхи хоныс ирон, уæд дæ мадæлон æвзаг зон, transliterates to Kae'dahi honish Iron, u'dah mādalon avzāg zon which already sounds quite different from Persian. You can still see some similarities though:    The conditional ""when/if"" given by (Kae) Кæ, which is similar to how you would say it in Persian. The most obvious one is Iron (ирон), which is what they call themselves and their language, Iron Avzāg (ирон æвзаг: the Ossete language).  Avzāg is also similar to ""āvāz"" in Persian. Mādalon (мадæлон) is similar to ""mādar"" and mother. Zon (зон) is like ""kon"" in Persian, which means do.   So all together it means, ""if you are an Ossete, you have to speak your mother tongue.""   As for the video, here's what I could make out: The first guy asks ""You're Ossete?"" and then the girl asks ""Do you understand Ossetian?"" I dont know how to translate the second guy, but then the second girl says ""I don't understand :("" which makes the guy with the traditional instrument then ask, ""You don't understand your mother tongue?!""   The rest of the video is them trying to encourage others to keep their culture and history alive by practicing and learning Ossete. Quite difficult to translate all of it but hopefully you get the picture."
iran,3881ii,QueLogico,2,Tue Jun 2 18:47:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks, rezsahin!  I'm curious now though, why have you studied Ossetian?"
iran,3881ii,rezsahin,6,Tue Jun 2 19:40:38 2015 UTC,"I was doing a linguistics project a couple of years ago on finding Iranic words to replace foreign words in everyday Persian speech. That project required both investigating ancient/medieval Persian and other related Iranian languages in order to find appropriate words.   I chose to go to Ossetia last summer to study their language. Other members of my team went to Iraq and Afghanistan. Others went to India to study the Avestas with the Parsi community.  Eventually, that project received more funding for its insight on Middle Persian (and the Avestas) so it shifted its focus and now they only do that. No more trips for me..."

This is a discussion regarding a video of veiled old women following old traditions and speaking about a black chador (literally translated as TENT in Persian) that is worn by conservative Muslims.

I don't think covering your body is oppressive. I think wearing a chador is oppressive.   What are your views on cultures in Africa or the Americas where women dress topless? Violent Abrahamic religions dealt with them quite harshly but many still continue their traditions and I think they are worthy of respect."
iran,384ot0,Nmathmaster123,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:24:49 2015 UTC,"Your reference is a tiny cross-section of modern society that has existed for mere decades. To be fair, it is disproportionately wealthy and influential, exorbitantly so (to the point of virtually enslaving the other 99% of the planet).  To you, Abrahamic social values don't meet your needs since you are a part of this cross section. That still makes it, even by your standards, pretty useful for over 90% of the time since lets say the Prophet's (pbuh) death.  Also, known of us can predict or guarantee what the conditions in the world will be like in the future. Though being a different argument altogether, I see society evolving rapidly in the next century (or the century after the next) in a direction you would consider retrogressive or primitive in some respects, socially. Human behavior in conjunction with environmental changes pretty much points to it like a giant blinking neon colored sign. Then, who knows, it could be perfectly useful again for the next millennium after that.   Not watching If events proceed like in your dreams (on our way to a Western neoliberal utopia), then that's still a problem for Muslims to deal with quite a ways down the road, after a discernible pattern is set that can't be attributed to the changing winds of people's whim.  Islam's values are rooted in our biology and our ""natural"" state, which corresponds to when humanity emerged from the neolithic period more or less, beginning agriculture-based societies and starting large civilizations, but still being grounded in our early AMH lifestyle (lots of fishing, hunting, etc). ""Today's values"", if they refer to Western liberalism, are grounded in an unsustainable and expensive lifestyle (technology and science aren't cheap, plus resources are limited). Once the lowest common denominator isn't ignored and sustainability is demonstrated whereby the approach is grounded in a level of technological development that can't be erased by time and is universally accessible, then it could be time to rethink things. Even then, what's good for humanity isn't necessarily what you would personally prefer.  Your claim about women in tribal cultures. Well, Islam says that messengers and prophets were sent to every nation/people. So this may well have included those tribal societies until for some reason they  deviated from the message or such."

What you fail to see is that for nearly 3,000 years, social norms barely changed on a global scale until the last couple of centuries. With these modern norms what has it brought? Unsustainablity.   As for your last point - it's not true. Islam didn't send prophets to every nation and you shouldn't expect non-Muslims to believe this.    You misunderstood. Not Islam, God did.

Thanks to Putin's leadership Russia got out of its economic disaster orchestrated by the Yeltsin reforms, and he has been strong on trying to prevent the encircling of Russia by NATO, making him very popular in Russia.   His pissing about with Ukraine is nothing to admire.   Blaming Russia solely for the Ukrainian conflict is ridiculous. It was NATO powers who encouraged the protests. It was NATO undercover agents shooting at protesters with snipers and filming themselves do it to blame on Ukrainian police, the same tactic NATO applied in Syria before the breaking out of the civil war."

It was bad on my part to not provide a source for such a claim. Here it is. Evidence shows that those shooting the protesters were also shooting the police officers in an effort to escalate the tension of the protests and create a revolution. The new coalition which is sponsored by NATO countries refused to investigate the case which leads one to believe that a party in the coalition may have been behind the shootings, as Urmas Paet points out.

iran,382t97,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:44:07 2015 UTC,"Alawites:       The Alawites, also known as Alawis (ʿAlawīyyah Arabic: علوية‎), are a religious group, centred in Syria, who follow a branch of the Twelver school of Shia Islam but with syncretistic elements. Alawites revere Ali (Ali ibn Abi Talib), and the name ""Alawi"" means followers of Ali. The sect is believed to have been founded by Ibn Nusayr during the 9th century. For this reason, Alawites are sometimes called ""Nusayris"" (Nuṣayrīyyah Arabic: نصيرية‎), though this term has come to have derogatory connotations in the modern era; another name, ""Ansari"" (al-Anṣāriyyah), is believed to be a mistransliteration of ""Nusayri"". Today, Alawites represent 12 percent of the Syrian population and are a significant minority in Turkey and northern Lebanon. There is also a population living in the village of Ghajar in the occupied Golan Heights. They are often confused with the Alevis of Turkey. Alawites form the dominant religious group on the Syrian coast and towns near the coast which are also inhabited by Sunnis, Christians, and Ismailis.

iran,382t97,Nmathmaster123,0,Tue Jun 2 14:23:28 2015 UTC,"k, sorry lol, I had to go to work but now that I'm back home I'll answer. A lot of their beliefs fall out of the folds of Islam, but some shias still consider them to be Muslims. Hafez al-assad and Bashar both heavily Islamized Alawitism, despite both being nominally pious Alawites themselves, that was the route they took with the religion.  I've heard (although I admit not much) some of their theology and it doesn't sound Islamic at all. On the other hand however they are still a offshoot of Shia Islam as in they broke off from Shia Islam and still revere Ali.    the Government here will insist they are shias, but really this label is a label of convenience. While I agree with protecting the alawite population and thus siding with the syrian state, I don't think however they could be considered muslim.  Really they fall on either side. At this point if they insisted they were muslim I would accept that. If they stated they weren't muslims I would also accept that."

The entire idea of ""human rights"" is just white people imposing their belief systems on other cultures.   Such a load of bs. White people? I forgot to do my imposing today, better get on it! Everyone deserves to be treated fairly and not abused. Yes, even 'brown people' (as you put it). Is the topic of human rights used in a cynical political manner? Yes. Does that mean that people should be denied them? No.   There's a concerted effort by American media, particularly white people, to depict the Iranian people as sub-human vermin   You do know most Americans don't give a shit about Iran, right? And I don't mean that in a bad way. They just don't care one way or another. When Iran's name appears in the news, or they are asked by a polling agency, they may say that Iran has a bad government or that it is hostile, but beyond that Iran is not important to the vast majority of Americans. And in any case Iranians as a people have a far better image than Arabs for example. This isn't necessarily a good thing, but it just is.  Get over yourself and go back through your comment.

Today it seems more tolerant and modern than the Sunni world, although that's not really saying much. However it seems like historically the Sunnis were more tolerant of religious minorities than the Twelvers. The Mughals and Ottomans seemed way more tolerant of their religious minorities, or majority in the Mughal case as they were ruling a Hindu-majority India, which kind of speaks for itself that they allowed India to be majority Hindu. If the Safavid Twelvers got their hands on India they would have probably implemented mass genocide and annihilated every trace of Hinduism from India.   The only branch of Shi'a Islam I like are the Nizari Ismailis. They mix religion very well with modernity and to me seem like they have an ideology that has what it takes to create a successful, modern and tolerant society if they become a majority anywhere."

Ever heard of fighting back, which we actually did? And yes, against the so-called 'tolerant' Mughals that you speak of. Read up on Maratha Empire. Read up on how Aurangzeb (of your so-called 'tolerant' Mughal dynasty) massacred Hindus, destroyed thousands of temples, imposed taxes on non-Muslims (Jizya), INCLUDING Shia Muslims. Read up on how Babur had destroyed one of the most holiest of temple of Hindus, the Ayodhya Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, and built a mosque on top of that. Take that. The only tolerant Mughal king you can say was Jalal ud-din Muhammad Akbar.  Also, FYI, Mughals mostly controlled the northern parts of India, not South India. Under Aurangzeb, they managed to gain some South Indian territories, but only for few years. And then, the epic Maratha Empire happened and Mughals got their anus destroyed."
iran,37xp2n,JustALittleSexyPush,3,Sun May 31 09:09:32 2015 UTC,In history class nobody considered the Mughals tolerant.

Also I'm not sure if fighting back does any good, the natives of the Americas fought back against European Christians, as did Sunni Iranians and Zoroastrians against Safavids, but at the end of the day they were all converted and had their old religions destroyed.  Mughal policy towards Hindus wasn't similar to Safavid policy towards Iran's Sunni majority and other minorities (Zoroastrians, Jews, etc). The parts of India that were under Mughal rule for centuries remained mostly Hindu so there was some degree of acceptance of the majority religion. They probably didn't follow modern western ideas of religious tolerance (as you pointed out) but they weren't genocidal in their goals unlike Safavids."

Either way the Shia world (like the rest of the Muslim world) doesn't produce any science, technology or innovation. That's why I say it's not an intellectual religion.

They haven't hurt anyone and haven't killed anyone. The prophet Muhammad killed people, as have all of the Twelver clerical leadership.  I respect the Nizari Ismailis because they are educated, sophisticated people. Everywhere they go they are financially successful and educated, unlike the Muslim masses that are failures in everything wherever they go. They do a lot of charity, women are equal, they believe in science, support secularism, most social ills prevalent in mainstream Islamic societies like violence, child abuse and lying seem to be uncommon in Nizari Ismaili society."

Considering that Muhammmad was seen as a mercy to the world, of course right now, he'd be seen as unmoralistic. Same example you made with Cyrus. Morals and norms didn't change much at all until these last 2-3 centuries.   I respect the Nizari Ismailis because they are educated, sophisticated people. Everywhere they go they are financially successful and educated, unlike the Muslim masses that are failures in everything wherever they go. They do a lot of charity, women are equal, they believe in science, support secularism,    They also do things contrary to basic Islamic practices. Not that you care but...   most social ills prevalent in mainstream Islamic societies like violence, child abuse and lying seem to be uncommon in Nizari Ismaili society.    That's due to culture more than anything."

Maybe because the stuff you're reading on Muhammad is wrong or from a different perspective. Furthermore, while Jesus is a person who commanded to do good and love this that and the other, Muhammad taught a whole system of life to live. It survived for 1400 years, it got battered and bruise along with way, and it shall long after too until God himself puts an end to it.    Culture is most often enforced by religion so what I see in Islamic societies is most probably a result of religion.   Is FGM mandated in religion as you see in many African societies?

iran,37xp2n,foop_plinger,2,Mon Jun 1 21:38:25 2015 UTC,"Persianate society:       A Persianate society, or Persified society, is a society that is either based on, or strongly influenced by the Persian language, culture, literature, art, and/or identity.   The term ""Persianate"" is a neologism credited to Marshall Hodgson.  In his 1974 book, The Venture of Islam: The expansion of Islam in the Middle Periods, he defined it in these words, ""The rise of Persian had more than purely literary consequences: it served to carry a new overall cultural orientation within Islamdom. ... Most of the more local languages of high culture that later emerged among Muslims ... depended upon Persian wholly or in part for their prime literary inspiration. We may call all these cultural traditions, carried in Persian or reflecting Persian inspiration, 'Persianate' by extension.""   The term, consequently, does not solely designate ethnic Persians, but has been extended to those societies that may not have been ethnically Persian or Iranian, but whose linguistic, material, or artistic cultural activities were influenced by, or based on Persianate culture. Examples of pre-19th-century Persianate societies were the Seljuq,    Timurid,   and Ottoman dynasties,     as well as the Qarmatians who entertained Persianate notions of cyclical time even though they did not invoke the Iranian genealogies in which these precepts had converged. ""Persianate"" is a multiracial cultural category, but it appears at times to be a religious category of a racial origin.

Just a note, despite saving many jews, he was not honored at Yad Vashem (which is a memorial in Israel for the holocaust). There is a section specifically for non-jews who saved jews during WWII called Righteous Among the Nations. Sardari is not honored, Israel claiming there was no risk to him, while most think for political reason and their rhetoric towards Iran would be weakened."
iran,37ujmz,TeslaRocksss,8,Sat May 30 16:30:17 2015 UTC,"Yad Vashem is a museum with policies and a board, it's not like Israel as a state dictates its policy or procedure  In fairness, Yad Vashem's policies require demonstration of personal risk. In 1978, the museum contacted Sardari to inquire about the story, but he declined.   They're also application based, and to my knowledge, nobody has filled out an application for Sardari to be acknowledged since '78. Now that there's more documentation out, perhaps you should fill out an application? http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/how_to_apply.asp  That being said, many diplomats who saved Jews are not eligible because of the 'personal jeopardy' issue. For example, US consular official in France, saved 2,000 Jews (including famed artist Marc Chagall) and is not listed. Pio Perucchi and Candido Porta, two Swiss consular officials posted in Italy aren't recognized because of the same issue and they saved 1,600 Jews. That's not to say that the actions of these people aren't commendable, but I think there's merit to Yad Vashem commemorating the specific category of people who risked their lives."

iran,37tqvb,NuclearWarhead,7,Sat May 30 11:43:39 2015 UTC,"The religious leaders have control on who is eligible to be elected and what laws are passed. They have learned from the sjahs mistake (sjah=farsi for king) who ruled before the revolution. They almost never gave in to the demands of the people which sparked a revolution. What they are doing now is giving in a bit to the demands of the people so that they can stay in power. They have done so by allowing Rouhani to run for election and by allowing him to negotiate with the west...  So Iran will be more free/western in 25 years if the religous leaders and America allow it. Im afraid that the republicans will mess things up since they are influenced to much by Israel/AIPAC.. They have even tried to assasinate an American citizen and blame that on Iran to start a war, I whish I could link you the documentary but I cant find it.

Iran's conventional capabilities are sufficient for the defensive doctrine of deterrence which has worked so far even during the time of G.W. Bush when many countries were under the threat of war.  This video summarizes the public opinion in Iran really well in my opinion.  edit: Building nuclear weapons would create a bigger threat to the country than not building them. Other than the obvious scenario of Israel and/or USA wanting to bomb our whole nuclear program because of it (including university physics research centers) and possibly killing tens of thousands of people if not more, it creates an atmosphere in Western Asia/Middle East that will cause countries like Saudi Arabia and Turkey to want to possess their own. Iran's geopolitical goal is for a WMD-Free Middle East, with the ultimate goal of disarming the only remaining holder of such weapons in the region, Israel, of its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons."

Also since the Iranian communities in countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands are not as big as the Polish/Turkish/Maroccan communities which results in better integration because they will have more contact with the native society."

iran,37tqvb,Purgatoryonlegs,4,Sat May 30 16:23:20 2015 UTC,"I think its because women in Iran see westerners or Europeans in an exotic way since they might not encounter many Westerners in their life.

iran,37tqvb,KOTAK_MIGAI,2,Sat May 30 16:41:50 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting and almost simple question but does not have a simple answer. Here is MY take on this, I might be wrong so others are free to answer as well.   First of all it's true for both men and women, they both prefer western mates. One reason would be simply because Iranian who move overseas are already quite westernized with an idealized image of western culture in their minds so because of that anything western have some sort of attraction to them. There's a more complex reason to that as well. There's a known phenomena among expat Iranians as they kind of repel each other. Quite opposite of Indian or chinese or many other nationalities who tend to attract each other and create communities, Iranians tend to avoid each other and merge into the host society and culture."
iran,37tqvb,ihatemysisterthrowaw,3,Sat May 30 14:07:04 2015 UTC,"I dont recognize myself in avoiding other Iranians, but it's true to say that we (Iranians) tend to have both Iranian and native friends."
iran,37tqvb,QueLogico,3,Sat May 30 14:19:38 2015 UTC,"See, that's what I noticed too among my Iranian friends. I always wondered why they'd mix more with Danish people (not that that's a bad thing at all!) compared to Arabs and Chinese who tend to stick to their own kind. I've asked some and they explained vaguely that they don't like other Iranians which I thought was strange.  Why do you think Iranians don't like to stick together?"
iran,37tqvb,vahidy,2,Sat May 30 15:05:14 2015 UTC,Why do you think Iranians don't like to stick together?   I think it's partly to avoid the tensions which exist within Iranian society in Iran.  Iran's recent history has been quite troubled and has left Iranians a little paranoid as a result.
iran,37tqvb,Nmathmaster123,1 point,Sat May 30 17:20:10 2015 UTC,A few years ago BBC Persian asked this question from the audience and got hundreds of answers. (Haven't been able to find the link yet) There are many cultural and psychological factors involved I think. But one of the top answers was that culturally Iranian don't respect each other's private boundaries meaning they are a bit nosy about each other's private life and at the same time are a bit judgmental towards each other. Mix of these things make them prefer to avoid each other.

iran,37tqvb,Amalian,13,Sat May 30 11:08:06 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say, there has been many changes that have improved the country in some ways and also worsened it in others. Overall though there were certain trends set into place from before the revolution that have carried on post-revolution, like the improvement of literacy, infrastructure, and healthcare.  Many of the human rights problems today existed before the revolution when Iran was a US ally, with people arrested for their beliefs and tortured or executed. The messy (understatement) transition from a ""constitutional"" monarchy to an Islamic Republic set the conditions for Saddam to launch the Iran-Iraq war which further deteriorated the Iranian nation along with killing some one million people. Many Iranians hold grudges against Western states who backed Saddam in this imposed war, especially when he was using chemical weapons (WMDs) on Iranians and the whole world including the Eastern Bloc, turned a blind eye. The only countries that were on Iran's side were Syria and North Korea while Saddam enjoyed support from USA, USSR, UK, France, and so forth.  The main differences are the country being significantly more self-sufficient, religious laws, scientific progress, reorientation from the West to the East, more sovereignty, more industry, less reliance on oil, and last but not least the harshest sanctions regime placed on any people in human history."

You will be treated with hospitality  since Iranians are very kind and will be extra kind towards foreigners since they want to show them what Iranians are really like. People will try to not let you pay for your fare/groceries but it's costumary to refuse these offers atleast 3 times and even then just give them the money. Most people speak basic English, people who were educated before the revolution often speak better English because in that time Iran was very west-orientated. There are also people who attended western Universities abroad and or have lived abroad for a period of time.  There are plans for making it easier for people for foreigners to apply for a travel visum, contact your local Iranian embassy on the current rules."

I was writing with an Iranian the other day, and he appeared to have an extremely negative view of Alexander the Great, claiming that he systematically hunted down all ""scientists"" and burned all books he could get his hands on when he was invading Persia... I of course know about the destruction of Persepolis (and I know that ancient sources disagree on whether or not it was intentionally set on fire, especially since it goes against Alexander's usual style), but I have never heard of systematic killing/burning throughout Persia...  When I said this, he said that I should ""go read"" (which is somewhat ironic, since I study history at the university atm, and read plenty :P )... But when I asked him for sources (like a good historian), he stopped answering...  So I was wondering if anybody could shed some light on this, preferably with reliable sources...

A bunch of fuckwit nadeed-be-deed in northern tehran think the West is such big shit becuase they suffer from cultural inferiority. Where as most Iranians who have spent time abroad realize and understand that these people are delusional. Yeah we wan't normalized relations with the west, but western culture isn't inherently better than Persian and Iranian culture. It has nothing to do with 'old ayatollahs' as someone who goes to Friday prayers every week (permitted my work isn't crushing me) I can assure you these people are well in touch with societies problems.    Iran doesn't need reform in the sense of 'less Islam in society', but rather, more awareness of the importance of Islam in society.   Agreed, but as the country grows more connected to the internet these people's children will start to see what a farce and delusional lifestyle their parents have been living.   I sincerly don't want to get into a religious debate here, but shia clerical hierarchy of having Majrahs has done us a lot of good. Sunnis have been screwed over by too little central authority. Christians were screwed by too much central authority. Shiism has found a decent balance in that. It takes a lot of knowledge and wisdom to become one legitimately, fools do not make it past these requirements. With more central authority more moderate and reasonable ayatollahs have more control over what is permitted. At the same time they do not become dictators (khamenei aside, he isn't really a hot shot religious authority like sistani). The Ummah has been devastated with every little scholar having legitimacy, its been so hard to standardize hadiths and weed out the BS ones from the credible ones. its absolutley devastated this umah. Shias however have been able to remain relatively intact because of this standardization.   You're breath is wasted preaching to us, central asians are in greater need of this than we are.

Many youngsters in Iran practicality don't care about Islam and the ones that don't far outweigh the ones that do.    As I've noticed myself. This is prevalent in all Muslim societies, whether Sunni or Shia or Ibadi. And this is a growing problem in non-Muslim societies outside of the west. It's what many sociologists call 'Western cultural hegemony'. Remember talking about this in one of my classes; young kids from outside of the West are bombarded by Western culture through the importation of consumer society. The West is then glorified in movies, music, television shows, and many other mediums in these kids lives. And this has such an effect of young people that they end up thinking that their own culture is somehow lesser, or less interesting, because its not as glorified. So you see young girls in South Korea for instance get double eye lid surgery to look more white.   What must be done, in all non-Western societies, is for the adults to take charge in what their countries consume. Iran has done this better then many other people I've seen to be honest. For example, the movie industry in Iran was very Western influenced with a lot of sexuality and not a lot of actual good writing, then when the Islamic Revolution came to be, movie makers were then forced to make actual good movies that reflected Persian culture rather than exemplifying the West. This has helped I believe to preserve Islamic values in the country."

iran,37saws,safa1375,1 point,Sat May 30 20:41:26 2015 UTC,"Soma:       Soma (Sanskrit: सोम sóma), or Haoma (Avestan), from Proto-Indo-Iranian *sauma-, was a Vedic ritual drink  of importance among the early Indo-Iranians, and the subsequent greater Indian and greater Persian cultures. It is frequently mentioned in the Rigveda, whose Soma Mandala contains 114 hymns, many praising its energizing qualities. In the Avesta, Haoma has the entire Yašt 20 and Yasna 9-11 dedicated to it.  It is described as being prepared by extracting juice from the stalks of a certain plant. In both Hindu and Zoroastrian tradition, the name of the drink and the plant are the same, and also personified as a divinity, the three forming a religious or mythological unity.  There has been much speculation concerning what is most likely to have been the identity of the original plant. There is no consensus on the question, although some Western experts outside the Vedic and Avestan religious traditions now seem to favour a species of Ephedra, perhaps Ephedra sinica.

The military eventually opened fire, and later estimates claimed that thousands died. Called ""Black Friday"" by the media, that day is said to be a key moment in the Iranian Revolution.

From then on, take a page from Vietnam or China: stay in power and reform reform reform. Keep that up a couple of decades, by then Iran will be very rich and strong, and then transition to democracy. Iran isn't ready today for countless reasons. Those crying for democracy should STFU and go to the West.

iran,37mv97,CYAXARES_II,-3,Fri May 29 03:16:10 2015 UTC,"Dude, I.R was the reason behind the war, because of they were too suborned and wanted to export their brand of Islam across the border. In 35 years not only we haven’t improved but we have moved back in time. As a result Iran is at least 50 years behind. Ask your parent and they will tell you which era was the best! Prior to revolution Iran was on top of nations, recognized and was on the path to improvement, now day’s Iranian passport isn’t worth shit. The currency is so low and devalued that it’s good for absolutely nothing. A 3rd world nation in Africa has higher currency than Iran and politically much better than I.R.

I particularly like the fact that we gained our sovereignty back, but I still have many fundamental problems with the way things are today.

If someone were to describe the Islamic Revolution in Arabic as ""al-inqilab al-islami"" rather than ""ath-thawrat al-islamiya"" -- the latter is what it's called in Arabic -- it would be clear (to me at least) that they were making a deliberate choice to use a different term than the prevailing one, most likely either to make a political statement about their view of the Revolution, or to advance an opinion that the Revolution was an overthrow of the Shah by a small group of elites rather than a popular mass uprising.

It's easier for people like us of course, speaking two different languages at home, one with dad one with mom. It's quite unique actually. Most people in the Nederlands are biligual (Dutch and English), but 'foreigners' like me are mostly trilingual (one other mother tongue). I have two other mother tongues. But in order of fluency, it'd be like: 1. Dutch, 2. English, 3. Turkish/Farsi. The latter two have always been the spoken languages (never had them taught to me).

People are much more easy going and life is slower than most places.  Food is really cheap and realllllly good and day to day life honestly depends on your job and your income. Iranian middle class and American middle class don't really have that many differences in their day to day lives, however Iranians probably go out to eat a lot more :P"
iran,37icl8,NoNickNameJosh,3,Wed May 27 22:05:15 2015 UTC,Thats great. Does Iran have a healthy food and food security system then? I would imagine that the sanctions that were imposed for years may of just allowed Iran to become a healthier nation. You must have seen then a big difference in the size of people from the regions.

iran,37icl8,rezsahin,6,Thu May 28 20:46:11 2015 UTC,"It's not unique to Iran; many ISPs all over the world are providing Internet at far lower bandwidths than they have the potential for in order to maximize profits.   This is especially a topic of debate in the U.S. which has the infrastructure for South Korea level speeds but many companies still won't provide it (for cheap). A system of competition and regulation prevents them from being too slow, but it's still not ideal. This is why people are looking forward to Google Fiber.  In Iran, companies have even less of an incentive to stop their profiteering and give faster speeds. Not only is there no competition, but it's far too easy to justify it (deem the Internet unIslamic and you're golden).   ""And what are people gonna do about it? Stop using it? Ha!"""
iran,37icl8,rezsahin,5,Wed May 27 21:56:38 2015 UTC,"Iran's situation is far more complicated about that. There are a TON of ISPs however these ISPs are literally resellers of the government.   Importing bandwidth is NOT allowed for ANY company other than the ""Zirsaxt"" and laying down cables is NOT allowed for ANY company other than ""Mokhaberat"" so yeah even if ISPs wanted to provide more speed they're literally not able to."

On the contrary, the Pakistani parliament voted last month to not join the Saudi-led coalition.  You are right that Daesh partly serves Saudi interests. It also serves Turkish and Gulf interests. Some analysts will tell you that Daesh indirectly serves Kurdish and even Iranian interests, by, for instance, entrenching Iran's influence in Iraq. For the fun of it, some might even point out how the U.S. benefits from the resulting fragile balance of power between Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran, and Israel (here talking loosely about each sphere of influence). Given that the U.S. appears willing to work with all of these powers in some capacity, and all of these powers are more or less contesting each other, the U.S. presumably could play them off each other to adequately maintain its interests. (No one said statecraft was clean!)  Also, the country is properly called Iran and its peoples are Iranians."

That being said, they've always said: we will protect Saudi LAND if attacked. We'll, they're getting paid, so why not. But that doesn't mean they'll go into foreign wars because the Saudis said so. The Saudis AND the US are using ISIS as a proxy against Iran, to break it's influence in the ME. That has nothing to do with Pakistan though, as they have PLENY of fighting going on within it's borders: taliban etc. Finally, I'd shut the hell up about 'Persians'. Are you living in 500 BC?"
iran,37jltd,IR-TR,2,Thu May 28 07:49:46 2015 UTC,The Pakistanis and Indians respect Iran. The countries share a long history of cultural and trade ties. Let's hope that perseveres into the future as well.

The KSA portrays itself as the guardian of Sunni Islam, when the fact of the matter is most Sunnis freaking hate them. And that's including me.   Iran has stood for itself against hegemony of both the West and the East, it's growing to become the most influential country in the Middle East, and Iranians did that all on their own.   Saudi Arabia is a pit of shit that imposes itself on other ME nations like Yemen through the backing of the US. The Saudis have never proven to anyone, including the Sunni Muslim world they claim to be the leaders of, that they actually have a back bone. They're children, end of story."

The Saudi monarchy is even more important to U.S. regional interests in the Middle East than is Bahrain.

iran,37jltd,directaction,2,Fri May 29 07:51:18 2015 UTC,"True, especially Bahrain, because that country would become very pro-Iran because it's majority Shiite. And indeed neither in Saudi would the US allow a revolt. But aside from that, I mean that not even governmental reforms that reach too far, would be allowed. Like foreign policy for example. I'm not quite sure the average Saudi likes to support the US through thick and thin. If the King/princes started listening to their population's demands, I think a 'palace coup' might be in order behind the scenes etc. Damned if you do, damned if you dont.

If not physically being present in the warzone, then definitely some sort of crucial military help in one way of the other as it has border with Iran, which Saudi can exploit."

The US would never allow it to happen, as Iran would lay waste to a large part of the world's oil supply and Saudi oil infrastructure. So those things are no noes. As for Pakistan's taliban, that was also with the help of the US, against the Soviets. Later on Pakistan has had to deal with it up until this day even. Many think Pakistan is a backward retarded radical country, and in some ways it is, but it's leadership is highly rational, like Iran's. Pakistan wants to develop, and it needs Iranian energy for that. And now look at China investing heavily in Pakistan. In the end, I have a very difficult time seeing Pakistan do anything against Iran, unless attacked or provoked by Iran, which is equally unlikely."

China just wants trade, and to genuinely enhance wealth in Pakistan. Iran could sell Pakistan a lot of natural gas (at friendly prices) and has already built it's part of the pipeline. Pakistan's energy needs would be met, but the US doesn't allow it, and threatens Pakistan with sanctions. :("

It is kind of fascinating to see such a strong security machine function as it did, I thought the questions they asked were rather silly but they did seem to be searching for something or at least testing me to see if I was hiding anything. They had a hard time believing that I actually enjoyed living in Turkey.

Israel would definitely care upon seeing an Iranian visa in a passport, no matter where that passport is from. I don't know what leads /u/boushveg to believe they wouldn't. I do a lot of pro-Palestine activist work and have many Palestinian Arab and Jewish friends who travel to Israel & Palestine frequently. Not one of my Arab friends who has been there has ever had a trip where they weren't pulled aside at the airport and questioned for a number of hours. Several of my Jewish friends have even been refused entry into Israel upon arriving at Ben-Gurion Airport, due to being on ""no-entry"" lists because of their association with pro-Palestine work in the United States, and forced to leave the country. The Israelis are extremely concerned with controlling who does and who doesn't get to enter the country, and this is doubly true for Arabs and Muslims, and for non-Arabs and non-Muslims whose last names the authorities suspect ""sound"" Arab or Muslim."

iran,37gdfb,Persiandoc,6,Thu May 28 10:49:54 2015 UTC,"I mean - maybe they were lucky? I traveled with 3 dudes, one doesn't live in Turkey and didn't have many stamps in his passport. For the two of us that do, they stopped and held us. Hell, they let my one friend in initially, went passed border control, and then pulled him in again for questioning. His was easy though, he got his visa card rather quickly. He was just polite and hung out with us. Now that I write this though, the biggest red flag was that I have a Residency Permit for living in Turkey. You will face questioning, but probably not as intense as we did.  Hmm. Let's see. Why are you here? What is your father's name? Do you know anyone in Syria? Write four references who can confirm where you are now. What is your grandfather's name? (I was told they were searching for Arabic roots). Where are you from? Why do you live in Turkey? Where do you work? Why are you here? Let me see your phone, I want to see your contacts list. How long have you lived in Turkey? Are you going to Gaza/West Bank (I forget how they phrased this though)? Why did you go to Tunisia? Why are you here? Have you been to Iran? Have you been to Syria? Where do you live in Turkey? Where do you work? I mean - there were so many more beyond these, my head was spinning, and they just kept repeating and repeating -- presumably to slip me up. I had to write on paper, my references and various other information. I didn't bring a computer because I was told they would go through it. I was super fucking nervous because I thought he would look at my phone again and I had texts on there about smoking weed and shit, so I deleted them - and then real paranoia crept in and I kept thinking -- fuck they will see that on video now!  I also fucked up here - when they asked me if I had been to Syria, I said no (but in my nervous nature) I said that I DID have a friend from Syria living in Istanbul. That got them very excited, you could feel it, and I knew I fucked up. He immediately demanded that I give his full name, phone number, and address. I was really panicking here, I didn't know any of this. Worst of all? He didn't even live in Istanbul anymore, he was just staying for a bit and at this time he was in back Damascus with his family. I said that all I had was his ex-gf's phone number. This is when he took my phone to see if I had an ""Abed"" in my phone, which I didn't, so he took his ex-gf's number and said - ""go sit back outside, we will call your friend to see if you're telling the truth."" I walked outside in a cold sweat with my head down and told my friends: ""yeah, I am not getting into Israel, I'll tell you why when I get the official nod of gtfo."" Well, the guy that grilled me must have been pulling my leg, because he never called her, if he had, she surely would have said ""well, he doesn't live here anymore, he lives in Syria now"" and the guy would have had no choice but to question everything I had said at that point.   We would be interviewed one by one, sent out, wait an hour, interviewed again, sent out, wait an hour... This went on for about 5-6 hours when we landed. Thankfully we took a late flight so we didn't lose the day going around Israel. I can only imagine how long it would take if there were a lot of people waiting to be questioned. My friend's friend waited over 8 hours trying to get into the country. Same story though, lived in Turkey. Talked to a Palestinian/French fella who was held for something like 10 hours! But you can assume as to why he was held for so long.   Now, this is when I came in - questions were primarily the same when I went out. My friend was strip searched when we were leaving - I was not. Still took us 2-3 hours to get out of the country as well.

The guy is Arab but apparently has a lot of Iranian friends who tell him what to stock. In Berkeley there is an Iranian store that is depressing as fuck but is probably better stocked, be careful though, I bought dried herbs for ghormeh sabzi and they were maggot-infested.

People aren't homogenously one way inside or out. Are there a lot of orthodox Iranians inside the country? Of course. There's 70 million people living there, there's bound to be several. And Sure there's significantly less outside due to western influences, but that doesn't mean all of Iran is conservative Muslim and only the diaspora is secularized. There's plenty of secular minded Iranians inside Iran as well."
iran,377868,littletamale,9,Mon May 25 13:57:43 2015 UTC,"I lived in Europe where the Iranians I knew were more leftist, and while they typically went for well-paid professions (doctor, engineer...) their world was less about money it seemed. Now I live in California and the Iranians here seem more wealthy, more focused on money and more materialistic (this is a generalization of course). But in any case, I think that the ones I knew in Europe were still pretty materialistic and definitely very class-conscious. It does seem that it's something that is present in the culture.   In Europe I also knew more people who were religious (note that none of them corresponded to the stereotypes people have of Muslims). In California I don't expect to meet Iranians who really see themselves as Muslim, though I may be wrong. Of course if they got here recently from Iran it's different, I ran into two women on the elevator recently who were wearing hejab and both seemed to be in their late twenties, going home early after a movie on a Friday night."

It's quite rare to find Iranians in western countries that practice Islam, even among the elderly population. Meanwhile most polls conducted in Iran reveal that the majority of the population believes sharia law should be the law in Iran, and the World Values Survey found 84% of people in Iran say they are ""religious"" and 16% ""not religious"".

It's also apparently the reason behind that 'joke' or stereotype that women from Rasht are very loose and promiscuous - because by Iranian standards women from Rasht were always very liberal, didn't cover up back in the day, would go out at night by themselves, etc.   That is of course not evidence and I have no concrete evidence that Rashtis are not religious though. I know that region or province was heavily influenced by communist thought due to its proximity to Russia and they were of course always the first to hear of European ideas, etc. But then that begs the question of why Iranian Azerbaijan is so conservative and all the women there seem to be in chadors, so I don't know tbh.

They're different from Muslims from other countries that I've met, but still conservative and religious. One of the differences also is that they don't seem to give as much importance to being Muslim in terms of their identity, the Iranian identity is more prominent, whereas often people from other countries seem to define themselves first as Muslims.    I also remember meeting a Iranian Sufi family in Turkey and they invited me to their gathering at the local Sufi center, everyone else was Turkish of course. The genders were segregated for the zikr and the Iranian women were pissed off, they told me that their center in Iran is mixed."

A majority of Iranians (especially outside of Iran) do not pray or even know how to, don't know the Arabic prayers, don't cover their hair, don't keep their women in the house, are very progressive-minded, want freedom, eat pork & enjoy whiskey, love HBO & MTV, cherish the American flag as dearly as they cherish their memories of the greatness of Iran (pre-Revolution). They call themselves Muslim, and that is their right as religion is a personal choice and one's worship of his own religion is very private and personalized.

Quote from Khamenei (2007):   Western countries allow no freedom of expression, which they claim to advocate, with regard to the myth of the massacre of Jews known as the holocaust, and nobody in the West enjoys the freedom of expression to deny it or raise doubts about it. But affronting the sanctities of about 1.5 billion Muslims is permissible in the West.   http://www.leader.ir/langs/en/?p=contentShow&id=3500  I'm glad Khamenei had his stooges like Rouhani and Zarif making some conciliatory remarks that Nazi Germany did indeed kill some Jews during WW2, but the leadership of Iran has never fully committed to admitting that the full extent of the Holocaust actually happened. And Iran would certainly never admit the 6 million death toll of the Jews as an accurate figure.   My concerns could be assuaged if the current leader of Iran took back his Holocaust denial comment that he made in 2007 instead of having his stooges make these pseudo admissions that sort of admit the Holocaust kinda happened."
iran,374580,Lucifer_L,13,Sun May 24 21:32:05 2015 UTC,"First of all, Khamenei is not ""Iran"". A political leader does not speak for an entire country, no matter what legitimacy he claims for himself. Your racist bigotry toward Iranians cannot be rationalized by what Khamenei has said. Netanyahu has said that a racist supremacist, who compared non-Jews to ""donkeys"" whose ""sole purpose .. is to serve Jews"", is one of the country's ""wisest men"". This disgusting evil does not extend to all Israelis.  Second, ""myth"" is translated from a word that means something similar to ""legend"", as in the event has taken on legendary significance in the West. It's not clear at all that he denied it.   but the leadership of Iran has never fully committed to admitting that the full extent of the Holocaust actually happened. And Iran would certainly never admit the 6 million death toll of the Jews as an accurate figure.   And Bush denies that 750,000 Iraqis were killed as a result of the war, putting the figure at 1/10th that, and this is after doctors from all around the world conducted a study in the country to measure the death count.  Making bigoted remarks about Americans because of the Bush administration's comments is no more acceptable than doing so about Iranians because of some Iranian administration's comments about the holocaust, or about Israelis because Netanyahu says a man who considers non-Jews born to be slaves of Jews to be one of the country's ""wisest men""."

The heinous acts of the Nazis during World War II have been linked in the popular mind to creation of contemporary Israel. It has been used repeatedly as part of a political narrative for the past half century. Using myth to refer to the broader narrative in no way implies that actual event did not take place.  Secondly, try raising doubts about the holocaust publicly and see what happens. People doubt the moon landings, evolution, and global warming all the time, yet the worse they get labelled with is crackpot. If freedom of speech is worth a damn, and the West's trumpeting of it anything more than lip service then idiotic opinions need to be allowed. Instead, even criticizing Israeli policy is considered criminal by many.   There is no reason that we should be consider talking about the premeditated aggresive wars responsible for killing millions of Muslims in any better light than the holocaust. If one is permissible then so must be the other."
iran,374580,clutchest_nugget,-5,Mon May 25 00:20:43 2015 UTC,"↑ See, this is exactly the type of people I'm dealing with. People like him are utterly convinced the Holocaust has been some sort major win for the Jewish people because now they're now able to guilt the rest of the world into doing their bidding. And of course the accusation that Western foreign policy is somehow crafted by Jews to suit Israel is nothing more than an anti-semitic canard that fits into the ""Zionist occupied goverment"" conspiracy theory that neo-Nazis and Islamist anti-semites love to use."
iran,374580,boziud,6,Mon May 25 01:12:28 2015 UTC,"Calling the Holocaust a major win would be absurd. That doesn't change the fact that it has been exploited for political gain be some people. Conflating the two requires one to use an assumption common to both Zionism and antisemitism, an assumption which ought to be discarded as bigoted and atavistic.  The Holocaust was certainly not a win for either those who died at the hands of the Nazis or those who survived under them. But there are plenty of people who have never experienced such cruelty or powerlessness who have benefited from using the Holocaust to their own political gain. To describe this is either a net loss or gain for 'the Jewish people' requires one to first accept that there exists such an entity.   Certainly we could talk about people who consider themselves Jewish, but that is a diverse group of people. Only a minority of this group is actively Zionist. Plenty of Orthodox Jews, both in and out of Israel want nothing to do with the settlements. Many Jewish people are simply sick of the fighting and want a peaceful resolution. Many more likely don't care at all until election season.  To say then that 'the Jewish people' benefited from the Holocaust, requires one to claim that all Jewish people are implicitly Zionist. That they can never integrate into the rest of society and need to settle on land that is currently occupied by Palestinians. This is the exact same argument used by every neo-Nazi: that Jewish people are all loyal first and foremost to Jewry and therefore can never be part of a modern state that demands loyalty to the regime above all.  So whereas you only implied it I will be upfront and call you a bigot. It is impossible to hold your view without accepting that racist belief that Jews exist separate from the rest of humanity and cannot ever integrate. Nothing less can justify your assertions.  As an ancillary point I will add that American foreign policy cannot have been 'crafted by Jews' because the United States has never had a coherent foreign policy, especially not with regard to western Asia."

The treaty you're talking about in 1982 did not include the full withdrawal of Iraqi troops from occupied territories, neither did it guarantee that the dog, Saddam, wouldn't regroup and attack later (as he did to Kuwait).   People responded the call to go to Karbala because they understood that's Iranian turf. Why not take it back? Why not revive a greater, more powerful, more prosperous Iran? Why accept a fringe position in a world order established by the West?  Today, with the American invasion of Iraq, and Iran's hard work and risk-taking, Iran has managed to install a government friendly to Iran and at the same time representing the Shi'a majority of Iraq. This could have happened on a much bigger scale in the 80s. That's what Khomeini gambled for and unfortunately lost. He lost because he miscalculated how far the US was willing to go to keep Iran weak. It turned out the US was ready to collaborate with war criminals and even commit war crimes of its own just for that purpose."

Iran didn't install a puppet regime in Iraq, and even if it did, look how the US hit back: Daesh. Daesh isn't meant to take over Iraq entirely, just the Sunni areas. So at best Iran has a friendly Shia-stan. But the fact that Shia Arab Iraqis are friendly to Iran, has a lot more to do with the fight against cannibal Daesh. Otherwise, it all turns back to Arabs vs Iranians bs, and we all know how that went. Arabs have 2 modes: Arab nationalist, and sectarian. We're just witnessing sectarian mode right now. It wont last forever. The best Iran can do is help them carve out a secure and stable Shia Iraq and be friends. That's it. No karbalas or what not."

His reference to ""Mughals"" is that they came to Iran and became Iranianized, the same way that they became Indianized in India. They came under the influence of Iranian culture. Then he says how if anyone wants to defend Iran or ""Iranianness"" then the Islamic era is in better record and thus more factual, making it more believable and how it's tangible: the Holy Book, the architecture, its scientific achievements, and its history are clear.  Note: I started off by just explaining what he's saying and slowly turned into translating his sentences.

It's ironic because Iranian culture had similar effects on Alexander the Great and his troops when they arrived as well."

iran,372kyq,AryanBrothelhood,10,Sun May 24 08:47:32 2015 UTC,"Before his death in 1227, Genghis had reached western Azerbaijan, pillaging and burning cities along the way.  The Mongol invasion was disastrous to the Iranians. Although the Mongol invaders were eventually converted to Islam and accepted the culture of Iran, the Mongol destruction of the Islamic heartland marked a major change of direction for the region. Much of the six centuries of Islamic scholarship, culture, and infrastructure was destroyed as the invaders burned libraries, and replaced mosques with Buddhist temples.  The Mongols killed many civilians. Destruction of qanat irrigation systems destroyed the pattern of relatively continuous settlement, producing numerous isolated oasis cities in a land where they had previously been rare. A large number of people, particularly males, were killed; between 1220 and 1258, the total population of Iran may have dropped from 2,500,000 to 250,000 as a result of mass extermination and famine.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Iran#Destruction_under_the_Mongols"

I would definitely enocurage you to see Hamedan if you can find the time. There are important incrisptions and the Tomb of Esther and Mordecai.   If your driving through Kurdistan on your way to Sanandaj I would caution you to get going early and leave for the next city during the day. Especially if your going to Marivan. The route between Sanandaj and Marivan is incredibly dangerous during the night, especiallly since Smugglers use it and drive without lights.

There were two Iranian tourists with us on that tour.  Towards the end, the weather turned sour and huge waves were rocking the boat pretty heavily. It felt like we were going to capsize so most of us were feeling pretty nervous.  Not the two Iranians though; they started singing some catchy folk songs, in Farsi I assume. Soon, all of us forgot about the waves and were happily clapping along to their singing until the boatsman guided us safely to shore.  I've never had so much respect for tourists before. Here they were, halfway across the world in a foreign land and they're keeping the locals calm in a tense situation when you would expect it to be the other way around.  Thanks so much for your beautiful language and songs! Could you guys share a tune or two, on the off chance they may be one of the songs the two tourists sang?

iran,36ypbx,AizatoSyamilo,4,Sat May 23 11:43:03 2015 UTC,"Iranian people basically don't interfere in other people's religion. They have mostly no problems with any religion. As pointed out by many the government is different in the case of the Bahaiis, they are excluded from higher education if I am not mistaken. Here you find some articles that will show that lots of religious groups live in Iran and practice their religion: http://theotheriran.com/tag/minorities/  Religious diversity has been in the Iranian culture for some time. In the posts you will also read a post about a Sunni woman mayor of an Iranian city. I think a Shia woman mayor would be quite improbable in most countries."

It's pretty straightforward. If you learn 4-5 letters a day, you'll be done in a week. (Retrieval is key in studying anything, test yourself throughout the day until you can write each letter and know what the corresponding sound is)  Taarof: accept something the third time it's offered, the first two were just so the person looks gracious.   Also, it wouldn't hurt to see if your local library has any books about iran (some are in the sidebar, I'm thinking of the Axworthy one.) It wouldn't hurt to skim through to get a general sense of the history.  I second the other guy's comment about watching movies. If your farsi is not that strong, maybe subtitles would help. I know A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night has pretty simple conversational farsi in it, the only potential downside is that it drags on a bit without ever picking up. I'm sure others could suggest better movies, older/famous movies, I'm just not well-watched.    I hope you enjoy your time there. If you're in tehran, soak it all in. The smell of cigarettes and gasoline (diesel?), the mountains purple in the backdrop, the black-and-white crows, the stray cats, but most of all the people. It's been three years now, so I can't remember a single stranger's face except for a man sitting in the lotus position with a smile in a famous park in Tehran (forgot its name). And memory is a fickle thing, every act of remembering adds a little more noise/distortion to the memory. You might end up projecting some things that weren't really there.

I also have many friends still in Iran who are homosexuals.   Unfortunately, whilst the answer is not incorrect, it is very much painting a picture that is far from the reality. We all know what happens to gays in Iran. Yes, many live fun-filled lives of parties, sex, drugs and glamour. But the constant fear of familial punishment as well as legal punishment and social repercussions really fucks with their heads.   If anyone really cares to know about gay life in Iran, they can ask me or one of the gay refugees. There are thousands."
iran,36vwqy,littletamale,3,Sat May 23 03:07:11 2015 UTC,"That's an important point, but I do think there is an important distinction between social/familial repercussions and legal/state repression.

iran,36vwqy,ishgever,1 point,Sun May 24 16:02:18 2015 UTC,"It does maybe mess with your head more in some ways. But the legal repercussions are very much on their minds too - constantly wondering if the person they're talking to online is a policeman trying to lure them, wondering if someone will catch them, wondering if the policemen they bribe to let have their parties will tell on them anyway. It creates an environment of severe paranoia.   One of my Iranian gay refugee friends was walking down the street here in Australia with his non-Iranian boyfriend. Iranian wanted to hold hands in public. Non-Iranian boyfriend wouldn't allow it, and responded with ""sorry, you just don't understand the way that I grew up and how this was perceived in my society"". Iranian responded with ""sorry.

Supporting a fundamental Sunni group could also show that Tehran is not in an all-out-war against Sunni Muslims.   Just because two sides are talking doesn't mean they're on the verge of forming an alliance. These alleged talks don't mean that Iran will be supporting Taliban for any reason, especially to prove others wrong about the ridiculous claim of being ""in an all-out-war against Sunni Muslims""."
iran,36wnx4,CYAXARES_II,2,Fri May 22 19:49:37 2015 UTC,"While those points may sound/look true, I don't think that's the reason. The Taliban, while a bad group, has indeed matured to some degree. They've sent delegations to many countries, and even they are of the opinion that regardless of how they view Iran, it's their neighbor. It's not too far off to see the Taliban become a political party too in some shape or form, and remain a powerful organization militarily. Even they will some day have to keep their 'constituents' happy. Maintaining ties with neighbors, cooperating in security and energy supplies etc are necessary for that. That's my take. In the end, they do hate Shia, so it's no bromance."

iran,36uhxh,letsstaytogether,23,Fri May 22 05:56:51 2015 UTC,"Well, generally speaking Mossadegh is viewed as a nationalist. In most circles a bourgeois nationalist, but a nationalist nonetheless. He is considered as an eloquent, educated man that was wrongfully overthrown by the US/UK.  Reza Shah and his son, are viewed in their historic context. There is no denying that Reza Shah was a very different and perhaps in some ways better ruler than the last Qajar. So in that regard, he holds some positive aspect. But the way the country turned into a puppet-state dictatorship is... beyond reconciliation.  Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (the last shah) is just a joke. The man was a compulsive liar, ruthless anti-democratic dictator and a puppet. In fact, he holds the nickname of ""Suitcase Shah"" because he'd pack his bags and get on a plane every time protesters would take the streets.  In my circles today, and generally speaking, no self-respecting Iranian supports either of these two dictators and their reign. That doesn't mean that they don't exist though, because they surely do. Some of them are part of the old aristocracy or the bourgeois who were well off during the dictatorship and a very very very tiny minority are just politically ignorant.  I would argue that the current rational consensus within Iran and most probable outside, holds an anti-shah sentiment, but is not necessarily a supporter of the current regime.

It was impossible for Reza Shah to pull Iran out of the orbit of foreign powers, especially Britain thanks to the incompetence of the Qajars, but after consolidating his power he worked steadily to limit their influence. He accepted no loans from foreign financiers, banned the sale of property to non-Iranians, revoked a concession that gave the British-owned Imperial Bank of Iran the exclusive right to issue Iranian currency, and even forbade officials of his foreign ministry to attend receptions at foreign embassies. When the British insisted that he hire European engineers to build the rail line that was one of his grandest dreams, he did so on the condition that the engineers and their families agree to stand beneath each bridge they built when a train passed over it for the first time.   Reza Shah took a nation suffering from famine and foreign domination and transformed it into a secular nation towards modernization. The rule of Reza Shah laid the foundation of the present day government structure. Despite an effort for change by the current rulers, the main frame of that apparatus is still intact."

iran,36uhxh,hmiemad,1 point,Fri May 22 09:38:06 2015 UTC,"Except that in 1953, he was on the other side and wanted Mossadegh down. Mossadegh wanted a secular democracy, and was as much against the monarchy as he was against the religious power."

iran,36qs4g,rezsahin,9,Tue May 26 12:26:05 2015 UTC,"It's important not to have strong emotions, neither love nor hate, towards any system of governance. Iran's government is just one among many, with average problems and average achievements. It's better than many other governments, but it's also worse than a lot of governments.  I wrote in an earlier thread that any state ruling over Iran needs to fulfill five obligations in order to preserve nationhood and independence: territorial integrity, political continuity, sovereignty, economic prosperity, and human development. In order to evaluate the IR as a system of governance, you need to judge how effectively it upholds these five obligations.   Territorial integrity: Iran is surrounded by hostile countries that constantly seek to steal its land and resources. Border areas are constantly under threat. A federal or a completely democratic system in a country like this would open venues for power groups to lobby for secession, similar to the Kurdish political parties in Turkey but in a much bigger scale. The answer for the time being is a heavily centralized state (with a fair and consistent judicial system which is currently sorely lacking). Political continuity: The IR has established a political culture and with each generation of leaders, you get more competent and effective statesmen. Although Khamanei holds a lot of power, the system isn't held together by him alone. Finding a replacement or abolishing the position altogether will be a non-issue unlike in 1989. The country as a whole is slowly becoming more familiar with a democratic system. The ""Islamic"" part of the Islamic Republic is used primarily for political mobilization purposes, and is highly effective. Sovereignty: A fact that is often overlooked by many is that in 1979 almost every concession made to any foreign powers was lifted. Mossadegh's dream became true overnight. What still remains an issue, however, is Iran being too tightly gripped by Russia for its own good, and Russia is a known bad player.  Economic prosperity: Most of Iran's economic woes have been caused by sanctions and the long war, but many still have been caused by corruption and mismanagement.  Human development: Iranians on average have a better standard of living than most of their neighbors. Iran has also consistently scored high in HDI and this is a direct result of its domestic policies, which is noteworthy, all things considered.   Many of these areas could certainly be improved, but it's important to view them in context and have realistic expectations."
iran,36qs4g,rezsahin,4,Thu May 21 12:41:53 2015 UTC,"Most of the things you mentioned weren't exclusive to the IR's government. It's the case of Correlation vs Causality. Iran was constantly improving in those areas before the revolution and the IR transitioned in the midst of the changes. Nowhere is it written or guaranteed that the IR continued the change or that the change was guaranteed to happen regardless of the change of government or the war with Iraq.   What we do know however is that the IR managed to pick up what the shah left off, which is an achievement but not that exclusive to the IR. We could have had a completely different form of government which could be as competitive as the IR or the Shah's reign and still be able to pull this off.   I was hoping of some criteria which is exclusively brought by the IR such as standing up to face the west during extreme sanctions, threats and isolation. However this criterion is almost exclusive to the IR ONLY, which is also not what I am looking for. During these harsh times, the Iranian people suffered a lot and the middle class of Iran was nearly tapered into the low and high class.   So what's the golden example; the one that involves the IR government and the people of Iran: It is that the IR brought the people together and the unity caused the people of Iran to become independent more than words; they built their own military and social infrastructure.   Unfortunately, the IR's form of governance has some pet-peeves that people hate to live with. I agree. It is part of the human nature to be opportunistic. Someone wrote it here somewhere. Even living in the most freest country in the world, people are already living under the burden of a lot of things, and having small extras such as restricted internet, music and fashion is really just extra pressure and mostly counterproductive."
iran,36qs4g,rezsahin,-2,Thu May 21 16:48:16 2015 UTC,"Your last two paragraphs essentially explain my original point, in that the IR was able to uphold the five obligations through domestic ideology and popular support (to an extent).  To build off of this, consider what I said about Islam being used as a tool for political mobilization. This is an enduring legacy of the Safavid and has had mostly net positive results in the current age, through innovations by the IR. Hezbollah in Lebanon, for example, was a product of this innovation that now promotes Iran's regional influence. The ""Construction Jihad"" rebuilding things during and after the war is another example of such mobilization. So in a way, this domestic ideology of the IR helps uphold the five obligations I listed above.  The negative byproduct, however, is now you have to enforce Islamic laws to keep the faithful satisfied. This leads to the inconveniences that exist, such as the morality police and the creation of a clerical ruling class. However, for the time being, I think this give-and-take is less destabilizing than secularization."
iran,36qs4g,rezsahin,5,Thu May 21 18:12:46 2015 UTC,"There are 2 types of Iranians in the world:   Ones that don't give a shit for all the political advantage or disadvantage Iran has in the world and want to just live   and   Those that are like you.  Surprise surprise, not a lot of Iranians are like you. My defense: A government should create strength for the people not for the name of the country. e.g. When you say I want to make Iran strong, you don't want to make Iran strong on paper; you want to increase stability and defence for your population. What the IR is doing now, is making Iran look strong on paper while the people are burning financially and economically. This drives people away and you see diaspora coming on facebook saying ""Marg bar IR"" and you wonder what the hell is going on with these people. In your head, you think the IR has made so much for its people (hypothetically), but all they wanted was to live with peace of mind, make dough, buy a BMW, let their kids party, etc. but they were met with obstruction because somebody has to show the world how politically capable we are in the world.  And this argument has a lot to it. You could argue that the reason why we do this is because of a bigger political game started by the West. A counter argument to this would be to let Iranians live the way they want to, but notify the public of the impending political pressure by the west, instead of putting morality police and a clerical ruling class to prevent the public from doing what you don't want them to (because maybe part of the political game by the west is to produce as much diaspora as possible). Etc."
iran,36qs4g,derintellectual,2,Thu May 21 18:36:17 2015 UTC,"I would argue that Iran's real power and real problems (for what it's worth, this is appropriately part of realpolitik) are not shown in paper, and that's why some remain apathetic and/or unaware.   Edit: Wording. And I should add that the IR is providing security and stability, and the ""burning financially and economically"" is only partially the IR's fault."
iran,36qs4g,rezsahin,3,Thu May 21 18:48:24 2015 UTC,"At least, the government should provide a cushion for the fall. Or bring a fire extinguisher.   Standing up to the west doesn't necessarily mean telling your people to deal with it. That's also another factor driving people away.  Actually, standing up to them and providing a cushion for the fall for the people is an achievement and I would root them for that."

The US, the wealthiest and most technologically advanced country, controls its own population through mass media, mass surveillance, and manufacture of consent by propaganda. These are relatively new in Iran and there are ideological barriers to using their full potential.  Providing a ""cushion for the fall"" (I disagree with using the word ""fall"" as this is more the friction caused by moving forward, but whatever) isn't really an easy thing for any government to do. Neither is it right to tell people that they have to suck it up and make sacrifices for a country they didn't even choose to be born in.  The only thing to do then, as individuals, is to not add fuel to the fire or inadvertently lend one's weight to the enemy."

There are people out there (in large numbers) that genuinely left Iran to make their kids have a better education or career opportunities.  Which points to the fact that Humans have a basic instinct to migrate to a place where it suits them very well to live.  Unfortunately, in the midst, there are Iranians willing to burn other Iranians. And it's not exclusive to Iranians only. It points to something I mentioned earlier: Humans are opportunistic.

I couldn't find a complete list of them, but I would think they are: the unification of exchange rates, promoting development in poorer regions, encouraging education, promoting birth control (in previous years), and setting up rehabilitation clinics for addicts."

iran,36p7fh,dubaioilprince,-6,Thu May 21 06:09:45 2015 UTC,"What does a two-state solution have to do with Iran? Palestinians are not Iranians. It's funny though, Iran makes the same mistake, with their meddling in Jordan and the occupied territories.  Israel wants to bomb Iran's nuclear sites. That's it. That crazy guy Avigdor Leiberman said something crazy about using nuked in an unpopulated area, but he's crazy and nobody takes him seriously, it'll never happen. You need to read more primary sources."
iran,36p7fh,flaringflame,14,Thu May 21 06:14:08 2015 UTC,"Why is it that when one of our crazy guys questions a historical event's details (however wrong he may be), all the Israelis are claiming that Iran is run by Holocaust-denying Nazis but when your crazy (barely former) foreign minister talks about nuking our country or bombing our nuclear sites which due to their proximity to population centrers and radioactive nature have the potential to kill thousands of our people, we are told to ignore it?   How would you feel if another country threatened to bomb Israeli nuclear sites, especially considering how your country obtained them through illegal methods, have not declared their quantity, nor allowed international inspectors into your country, ever? Why are the Israeli Likuds suddenly the world's nonproliferation police when they themselves are the biggest nuclear proliferation threat on the world?  This is the equivalent of Daesh running its own humanitarian charity organization condemning human rights violations elsewhere when they are the biggest violators themselves.  Do you see where I'm coming from? So as long as Israel does not declare its nuclear weapons, sign the NPT, and move towards nuclear disarmament, Israel is in no position to threaten to bomb another country's peaceful nuclear program which is under the most comprehensive surveillance regime in history. Your country's officials have already cost the lives of some Iranians and the livelihood of millions of Iranians by pushing these illegal sanctions on our people while your country is the only nation remaining in the 21st century who is illegally occupying foreign lands and denying its natives their inalienable right of self-determination."

Leiberman is an embarrassment but he was only there so Bibi could keep his coalition together. Lieberman had no power and no influence, it's effectively a ceremonial role. It's totally fair for you to be offended and criticize him. If I saw him in person I'd call him a bigoted idiot.  Iran's President and Aylatollah, who have real power, say so many extreme things about Israel and the US it's impossible to name just one."
iran,36p7fh,IR-TR,8,Thu May 21 07:40:34 2015 UTC,"Name me one that is as ""extreme"" as the genocidal threats we actually do hear from Israeli officials.  The worst you hear from Iran is our Leader calling for a referendum for the natives of Israel/Palestine (note: he is saying immigrants can't participate) which will ultimately dissolve the Israeli state and create a new state formed by the natives of the land. A two-state solution would void this plan and from what I believe being peace and prosperity to the region.  The only military threat you hear from Iran is what will happen in retaliation of an Israeli first strike. It is the Israelis who are calling for extremist measures like bombing a whole country's nuclear program and physics research centers, acting like such unprecedented actions come without consequences."
iran,36p7fh,autotldr,-6,Thu May 21 07:54:17 2015 UTC,"Um, how about the regular chants of ""Death to Israel"" and ""Death to America""? Also Ahmadinejad was very clear he wants all the Jews to leave Israel and go to America. If they could do it militarily, they would have a long time ago.   The only reason Israel would strike Iran is over the development of nuclear weapons. The world cannot allow the irrational theocracy of Iran, which is willing to destroy Israel and the US, to possess nuclear weapons, period. If Iran gets attacked, it's because they gave no other choice, by their own actions.   Israel has bombed sites around the Middle East many times over the last decade, and nothing has happened. It would be the same with Iran, Iran would never start an actual war. They would lose so badly it would be sad. Iran is bordered by multiple countries that would attack it, as well as face American and NATO forces. Millions of Iranians would be killed."

The Palestinians need to accept that Israel isn't going anywhere, and Allah will not be returning them to their homes, ever. All the countries that hate Jews around them keep the Palestinians thinking some sort of miracle will occur to wipe out the Jews. This is never going to happen.

And that obviously includes Afghan children. But I don't understand why you're saying they're Iranian. I'm personally fiercely anti-nationalistic and I'm not saying not being Iranian is a bad or good thing, it's just that the fact of the matter is that they're not Iranian; they're Afghan. Nothing bad about that."
iran,36jutd,IR-TR,11,Wed May 20 11:35:05 2015 UTC,"Guess what. They're not going back. And they speak the language. That makes them Iranian in my book. They're here to stay, so they should be prepped to be as productive members of society as possible."

iran,36jutd,rezsahin,7,Wed May 20 12:43:08 2015 UTC,"I think Iranian 'we're better than you' attitude is what makes the Afghans feel themselves not Iranian. Go back where? To a war torn country?

iran,36jutd,pandorascube,10,Wed May 20 04:02:08 2015 UTC,"Every time there's positive news about Iran, some sticklers bring up Baha'is.  First of all, Baha'is CAN go to school. They just can't receive higher education (college). Iran essentially allows everyone basic education.  Secondly, the number of Afghan refugees in Iran far outnumbers the Baha'is. There are only 150,000 Baha'is in Iran compared to near 3 million Afghans. This is an essential fact that is deliberately left out by those seeking to misinform. Let that sink in.

iran,36jutd,IR-TR,1 point,Wed May 20 10:41:25 2015 UTC,"The distinction between a ""free education"" and ""admission for higher education"" is an important one to make. One is a universal human right, the other is based on the laws and legislature of the state.   The Baha'i Faith isn't a constitutionally recognized religion, so its members are not guaranteed constitutional rights. Therefore, Iran is operating fully within its legal bounds when it decides to close off state owned universities regardless of citizen/residential status.  Ideally, the legislature should be revamped and all religions recognized in the constitution. But until then..."
iran,36jutd,IR-TR,1 point,Wed May 20 17:17:28 2015 UTC,Why do you insist on spreading such evil propaganda? A one minute google search can reveal that Bahais are not just denied admission to institutions of higher education they are also denied every other basic human right that exists regardless of an extremist constitution.  Bahais and other minorities suffer because of people like you.

But what about the sectarian killings conducted by Sunni states that actually continues all the way up until today, on Shia communities? That is far worse and has gone on for centuries. Shias literally had to hide their beliefs to avoid being killed. If it wasn't for this, who knew how widespread Shiism would be. With its tradition of debate and academia, I'm sure Shiism would've faired very well.  As further evidence for this, look to this thread on the Shia of Lebanon. They used to be incredibly numerous, being the majority in Tripoli, until they were massacred and driven to the mountains of South Lebanon, the lowest and poorest, having to hide their beliefs. Until Iran's support came in and changed all that in the 80's, at least.   Also, full disclosure I would not have repost it if it weren't for some of the commenters in the other thread, and the specific way members in r/Islam keep bringing it up.

Would be lovely to visit some day.  As to Iran, many say that's the reason there isn't any unrest right now. Iran needs this nuclear deal to happen and immediately  put it's economy in BOOM-mode for at least 5 years (it will be longer). But in 5 years, the people will want to have reforms. First fill your stomach, then ask for reforms. We need smart reforms, that don't allow for foreign subversion, but still give the people a feeling of having more freedoms.

iran,36h90x,Tahmasp,1 point,Wed May 20 00:08:18 2015 UTC,"Tajikistan has decades of secular, anti-religious rule that has had mixed results. Because Tajikistan is so impoverished, secular national ideology risks losing its appeal. The government is hopelessly corrupt, so that's causing the main worries here that the country might slip into instability.  If Tajikistan had all the natural and economic resources in the world, like what /u/IR-TR wishes, then Tajikistan has all the potential to become a highly developed economy with an educated middle class. At that point Islamic fundamentalism would lose most of its appeal. Tajikistan would probably end up resembling a country like Turkey, which somehow balances religion and secular democracy alongside an active economy.  The economic situation here is bleak, though. We have shit for natural resources and a small territory and population, so people have no choice but to go abroad for work. It may end up staying that way forever, although if government corruption magically stopped one day, we could have nifty little ecosystem going on.  Tajikistan should develop its tourism industry more. We can sell water and hydro-power to some extent. People need to focus as much as possible on higher education so we can grow a service-based economy."

If anything, I'd identify it more with Mohammed Shah Qajar since he put it in place.   I use it primarily because I don't recognize the current flag. I'm not Muslim and I resent the occupying Islamic regime that rose to power and put it in place. It doesn't symbolize Iran. It symbolizes occupation, like when the Sasanian empire fell under the Arab invasion. Ever since Iran has stagnated and failed to prosper as it once did.

There has been a concerted effort on the US and ... behalf for the past 40 years to destroy Iran, figuratively. So yes, I prefer the current regime over the alternative. Hopefully they reform and make it into something semi-democratic (very democratic for middle eastern standards). And when even my dad talks about democracy (he knows damn well what'll happen if there was to be another revolution) he means a semi democracy. Guess what, the  people of Iran aren't ready for a full democracy. They're still about 50 years behind the west, and that's the trailblazers. And they know that, witnessing the region burning. So let's hope for some reforms, some more freedoms, and then fill your stomach and shut up. If you want a real democracy, come to western Europe. It AINT gonna happen in Iran and it should not happen in Iran. Maybe in 30 years."

iran,36gn2n,clutchest_nugget,5,Tue May 19 08:28:01 2015 UTC,"Indeed, but I feel it's worthwhile to at least emphasize the point that, while Muslims generally believe in differing roles for women and men specifically with respect to family and reproduction, that these roles contain some flexibility, and likewise are viewed as being of equal worth and honor. The Western prism of feminism holds a much more rigid and extreme concept of traditional gender roles, and furthermore regards the female role as inherently inferior. Muslim society never approached that extreme, although oppression of women does exist in Muslim societies, as it exists in all societies.  But anyhow, saying that Muslims believe Muhammad was ""the first feminist"" is disingenuous. Muslims usually just talk about how women's rights was an important element of Muhammad's mission, which it was, although it didn't reform gender roles to the point that modern western liberals currently desire. Although, who knows how the wind will blow their desires from this generation to the next? Living up to the expectations of western liberals is trying to hit a moving target--as soon as we do what they want, they'll think of some new demands."

iran,36fnci,DoroodDoostam,5,Tue May 19 08:18:25 2015 UTC,"That's a good question that many often have.  Any state that rules over Iran needs to uphold the following geopolitical realities in order to preserve nationhood and independence: territorial integrity, economic prosperity, political continuity, sovereignty, and human development. The Shah did in fact uphold many/all of these, but the subtlety lies in how he managed to do so. Was it by popular support and domestic ideology, or through foreign powers?  The two important dates to remember, for all Iranians, are 1941 and 1953. These mark the Anglo-Soviet Invasion and the CIA coup, respectively; both of which preserved Pahlavi II's power through foreign means, not domestic. The end result of which was Pahlavi II trying to forever consolidate his power and authority through the West, rather than by his own people. An example of this in even his foreign policy is how Azerbaijan was liberated: the Soviets were kicked out because Truman threatened to nuke them. The geopolitical realties mentioned above were upheld by American nukes, not Iranian power.  What I also disagree with /u/Lucifer_L's comment is that Pahlavi II had an inherent disdain for Iranians. He and his father were ultimately embarrassed by who Iranians were, how they dressed, how they acted, etc. One of his biggest mistakes was not drawing material for foundations of a new Iranian order from a clear understanding of old material. Instead, he relied on fabricating and importing cultural elements that were incongruent with the Iranian spirit and the realities of Iranian society.  So for average Iranians, the resulting perception among the masses was the Shah modernizing the nation at gunpoint while kowtowing to the West. The Shah became self-aware of this in 1977, which is why he decided to pursue nuclear power and increase the role of civil society, but by then it was far too late."
iran,36fnci,rezsahin,3,Tue May 19 11:22:52 2015 UTC,"You know in complete retrospect (especially in the current context) I think, regardless of how you feel about the Shah, you are at least a little biased if you think that his rule was particularly worse than that of the IRI. I'm not a monarchist by any stretch but when I try to make a sober appraisal, I feel like he arguably had more compassion for the Iranian people, their culture and their way of life than many of his contemporary counterparts - even while ruling with an iron fist."
iran,36fnci,Lucifer_L,3,Tue May 19 03:40:14 2015 UTC,"If only he didn't imprison and torture people simply for being leftist. To be fair though the Soviet Union was trying their best to cause regime change in Iran during his time, the same way USA has been doing now with the I.R..  It's kind of ironic because by taking part in covert operations in Iran for their own political or economic goals, both USSR and USA not only did not reach their objectives but lost much of the Iranian peoples' respect for them."

The citation in the article about Christianity being the fastest growing religion is linked from a website called ""222ministries.org"". Hmm...  The 222 ministries page doesn't say how fast other religions are going--it gives a single statistic for Christianity. It doesn't say how fast Zoroastrianism is growing in Iran or Baha'ism, which in terms of conversions away from Islam are very strong contenders. The page admits that atheism is growing faster than anything else, but doesn't categorize it as a religion, which makes sense, I guess. According to them, there are about as many Baha'is in Iran as Christians, and that Christians make up less than 0.5% of the population.  References listed on that page:   Johnstone, P. & Mandryk, J.

iran,36dmbr,UmarAlKhattab,1 point,Wed May 20 05:51:05 2015 UTC,"Its easy to call everything ""cherry picking""   I didn't call everything cherry picking I called your statement that said ""one could blame religion for a lot of misdeed...""  Cherry Picking at it's finest.  One time, it was easy because it was a clear as a day.   I would love to see an example where religion was the actual source of something positive   Treating your neighbor nicely, Giving to the poor money, Bringing unity in the community and establishing identity with many people around the world.  That is just few examples, and I never denied religion has brought conflict, discrimination and violent affairs. So there is positive and negatives, but in your original comment you cherry picked the negatives. The same way anyone can cherry pick anything they already hate, I have seen the same style of cherry picking on the web.   Religion has only been a tool for the powerful to rule over the powerless.   The famous  ""Karl Marx card"", I knew you would bring it. The problem with your quote is ""has only"" which is completely false and show your pre-concevied bias. Yes, Gautama Buddha and Jesus introduce their religion so it could be a tool of the powerful to rule over the powerless. Powerful rulers, kings used religion to control their subjects, but it wasn't the only reason religion exited or developed.  Your whole argument is based on cherry picking, you know the act of pointing to individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position, while ignoring a significant portion of related cases or data that may contradict that position."

iran,36cyf8,CYAXARES_II,1 point,Tue May 19 03:50:02 2015 UTC,"Currently Daesh is more than an underground terrorist group; they are ruling over some 6 million people in Iraq and Syria. In their borders they practice slavery, mass rape, genocide, and other anti-humane acts. The first priority is taking control of the cities, towns and villages and relieving the Iraqi and Syrian people of their brutal stranglehold. Once that's accomplished steps can be taken to target the supporting base of Daesh.  By painting the portrait as a Sunni-Shia conflict you are falling into the carefully designed trap designed by both Daesh and Saudi Arabian strategists. This conflict is not a sectarian one. The Daesh support base - just like Al Qaeda and Al Nusra - may be all-Sunni but that doesn't make Sunnis their support base.   The Iraqi Armed Forces, Syrian Arab Army, Popular Mobilization Forces, Hezbollah, Peshmerga, YPG, and other forces are all fighting these terrorists forces not because of sectarian reasons but because they are protecting the unarmed civilians who will be tormented under Daesh control."
