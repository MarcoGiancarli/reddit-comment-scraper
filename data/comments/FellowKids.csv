He came from Chile on his own and we don't ever see him with a woman. He implies that his family exists, but he always is seen alone and this even raised an eyebrow before, though I forget which character mentioned it.  He shows no motive for making money aside from just wanting more money. The only reveals we get about Gus are the DEA digging into his past to find nothing and the flashback with Salamanca. As far as the writing goes, it feels as though he was developed to be purposely ambiguous. And aside from his dealings with Walt, there isn't much implication that he's actually doing anything.  And then he dies with all of the mysteries unsolved. What's his real name? Why is he so greedy? Does he actually have kids?  I'd be happy to see more about Gus in Better Call Saul, but I doubt it will ever happen."

FellowKids,3e2635,bamer78,6,Tue Jul 21 14:16:24 2015 UTC,"The thing I find strange is Disney is supposedly all about breaking stereotypes. You think they'd take the initiative and make a show that shows that girls can play video games and also be pretty and social and what not. Also, throw in a black gamer kid too. This is right up their alley. Instead, they're reinforcing stereotypes. It's one thing when an ""adult"" show like Big Bang does it for cheap laughs. But Disney is supposedly all about teaching kids morals and not judging others and all kinds of wholesome shit. For shame Disney."

It's close to the same aspect ratio of most Hollywood movies, so instead of being letterboxed the movie fills the while screen.   With the width and the subtle curve you get an almost 3d effect that makes movies really great. The downside is that it takes some getting used to and if you immediately sit down and game for 5 hours you might end up feeling sick.   It's also 1440p so you don't have scaling issues.   Another downside is inevitable light bleed in the corners. It's really only noticeable in dark scenes so I don't really mind.   I came from triple 1080p screens and I'll never go back."

FellowKids,3dmlzb,ethancochran,3,Fri Jul 17 17:21:40 2015 UTC,"Just so you know: the active ingredient in K2 is a synthetic cannabinoid, which is known as a designer drug. These are psychoactive chemicals that mimic the molecular structure of drugs that have been banned, but have just enough different so that they can escape regulatory scrutiny. A lot of them are sold as incense, bath salts, etc. When authorities get wise and pass laws to ban them, the suppliers just tweak them again, and the process starts again. Most are made in dirty and illegal Chinese plants, and are never really tested, so they can cause pretty crazy effects. Remember the guy in Florida that bit off someones face? Anyway, just say no, kids."

Ad 1: I saw a donut that was cut in half, so I decided to rock on. A bee then came over threw the donut in the trash, then asked for my ID. In response I rocked on and embodied Kiss as I stuck my tongue out.  Ad 2: A girl and some Facebook friends began drinking lots of booze and rocked on. [IT+MUCH] shocked me and then a girl wanted to high five me.  Ad 3: I was in Italy getting fuel, and gave a thumbs up because [EV] was free. I wanted to wait a moment because [S GET NG], then I did jazz hands and high fives a girl.  Ad 4: I was at court with a bee, Santa, a girl, and Facebook friends, who were all trademarked. I then had sex with the girl [NG] in Italy inside a tractor. [NT] got me mad, and, as people watched, I only partially rocked on.  Ad 5: A girl wanted to high five me but I was sleepy, which caused me to fail a test. I decided to drink lots of beer [NG], rocked on, and then grew massive biceps which I placed into a box.  The translator who thought this was some form of anti-drug campaign tremendously failed. of course, this is a more literal translation of the Emoji hieroglyphics, so there might be a more symbolic meaning to it rooted in the culture of the Emoji people.

Both of those things -- and the Web's former role as a service offered at a domain instead of the domain -- are why www was a thing for a long time.

This is an improper usage of Canis lupus advisious (aka ""Advice Dog"" to you non-STEM majors).   C.I. advisious should be giving the meme-ee (opposite of the meme-er) impractical advice. This would be an instant ""F"" in the eyes of Dr. Danksworth.  A more appropriate meme (and I use the term lightly. Studies have shown that this is more of an image macro) would be the use of my prototype meme - Encouragement Ant. Encouragement Ant is a picture of a common ant who gives the meme-ee his best wishes. I believe Encouragement Ant will change how we perceive both memes and image macros in the future."

FellowKids,3d51rg,LUDSK,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:07:42 2015 UTC,Yet ironically I know more people who aren't geeks who watch Futurama then actual geeks.
FellowKids,3d51rg,bigbadbiggie666,-12,Tue Jul 14 10:42:22 2015 UTC,It has its moments but at the end of the day the humor is very much the same.
FellowKids,3d51rg,elpfen,9,Tue Jul 14 01:28:13 2015 UTC,"Only in the most superficial way. That's like saying differential calculus and long division are the same cuz they're both math. Big Bang Theory may be ""geeky"", but only in a way that's easily digestible by most people. It's the incessant pandering that has made most geeks grow tired of it real quick. BBT isn't interested in actually being clever, merely appearing like it is. Futurama, on the other hand, is a legitimately witty show that knows it's audience. Instead of trying to pander to them, futurama focuses on being funny and high quality first and foremost. The focus isn't on ""oh look at me I'm so geeky look at my nerd glasses xddd"" but rather a compelling show that is fuelled by the geeky context. /rant"
FellowKids,3d51rg,LUDSK,2,Tue Jul 14 01:43:51 2015 UTC,"The style of humor is pretty different, actually. I haven't watched BBT in quite a while but from what I've seen, a common joke template is:   Sheldon: pedantic, picky, or nerdy comment Penny: ""Oh Sheldon, you nerds are so weird; I'm cute and normal and from the Midwest!"" Leonard: ""Well that's Sheldon for you"" big laughs   Or   Raj: is awkward Howard: comments on awkwardness while still being awkward himself big laughs   Whereas Futurama tends to have stuff more along the lines of:   Fry: ""I never want to see another can of slurm again!"" proceeds to get and drink can of slurm   And other stuff along those lines. Its just different styles of humor in general."

They're parodying that. This was made in 2011.  Memes were a bigger thing back then and that was around the time people started to really get sick of them.  It made sense to make this parody then.

The injuries shown on the right are exactly the kind you might have if you were only wearing the gear on the left.   No neck brace means you might injure your neck in a motorcycle accident.  Goggles can't stop everything so you could catch something small on the way down and get a black eye.   NO BANDAGES on the head at all... Seems like he had a helmet on.

One day we were doing some go-karting around a fairly simple and safe track, but all were requested to wear helmets for safety. After we had our laps and fun, I pulled off my helmet and found something rather disconcerting. A chunk of rock had somehow lodged one of its edges in the space between the helmet and the visor, and I at no point felt the impact or saw the rock hurtling towards me. Had it not been for the helmet I almost certainly would have been slammed in the eye with that chunk of rock even though we were not riding that fast and were on a seemingly ""safe"" track."

I only really get to claim half of the decade and it's not like I was participating in it, just passively existing.   So, as a 25 year old, I guess that I'm saying with you is ""I agree"" and ""Get off my lawn."""

FellowKids,3clh3t,CrystalElyse,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:35:17 2015 UTC,"Nope. It was built at a time where it was thought that windows were unnecessary distractions and a detriment to learning. The man who built our school also designed prisons.  Only the front of the school had windows. The first floor were all of the offices and administrative parts. The top floor were usually used as the computer rooms (with the screens facing the windows so the shades were always drawn) and a couple of language classrooms.  The remaining three sides did not have windows, nor did the inner classrooms. The inner classrooms were kind of weird, too. They were really groups of four classrooms divided by sliding walls, so they could all be opened into one large space.   The only pictures I can find are of the front entrance and a hallway with lockers and the gym, so none of them really show what I'm talking about. I don't live in the same state now so I can't go take some. But, suffice it to say, it was weird.  Weird in other ways, too. I graduated in 2008, so I don't know what's changed.... But we had a brand new weight room and physical therapy room for the sports teams, as well as a brand new huge band wing because those two brought in money. Smartboards in every classroom. But the textbooks were all super old and falling apart and the air filters hadn't been cleaned/replaced in years and they found a mushroom growing in one of the classrooms. It made it to 8 inches large before the school newspaper ran an article about it and it got cleaned up. We also had an impetigo outbreak because they didn't clean the locker rooms properly and an E.Coli outbreak from the water fountains. Oh, and a teacher's strike which lasted 3 of my 4 years there so no extra curriculars/clubs/talent shows/etc. They just did NOT understand how to properly allocate funds."

FellowKids,3clh3t,WhiteTrashKlebitch,0,Fri Jul 10 03:18:34 2015 UTC,"There needs to be a happy medium. Nobody under 13 needs a smartphone; you aren't even technically allowed to be on Facebook if you're under 13. I knew many people in high school who used Facebook because it was free with wifi instead of texting, and kids need ways to stay in touch with friends because smartphones are the norm now. It isn't a zero-sum game with the only choices being giving a ten-year-old a smartphone or not letting your kid have one at all until they're 18. When I say my mom is overprotective to the point of being neurotic, I mean that we weren't allowed to go to any parties at all, we weren't allowed to listen to the radio - only CDs our mom approved of, like Avril Lavigne, and she would screen things that were appropriate just because she personally didn't like the music genre - and the first dances we were allowed to go to were our Junior year homecoming dances. She didn't let me learn to drive for the longest time. And the weirdest thing about it is that she isn't particularly religious, which is what would usually cause things like this. She's just always been really overprotective and backward.  I guess deep down naming my handle after a taboo sexual attraction and my identification with a low social class is a type of very minor, safe rebellion :)"

FellowKids,3ci38h,placebo_burritos,-5,Wed Jul 8 23:09:44 2015 UTC,"Okay seriously? I NEVER said they shouldn't advertise their unhealthy products as is, because like you said, if they weren't able to advertise unhealthy products at all, they wouldn't be able to advertise. All that I'm saying is why they'd advertise the unhealthiness aspect AT ALL (which is what the heavy breathing meme does) when it would be smarter to just focus on how good something tastes. Do you see McDonald's and Burger King come out with commercials that say ""Hey, our food will give you adult onset diabetes if you eat too much of it, but it's still fucking delicious""? No. But that's essentially what Pizza Hut is implying here. OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE AWARE AND SO ARE WE THAT THEIR FOOD IS NOT HEALTH FOOD BY ANY STRETCH. I just don't see why you'd emphasize any part of that in their advertising, that is all."
FellowKids,3ci38h,Alphonso_Mango,5,Thu Jul 9 02:55:33 2015 UTC,"I think advertising a pizza that has cheeseburgers in the crust is emphasizing the fact that it is unhealthy and fattening.

FellowKids,3cfadn,drdarkly,9,Wed Jul 8 04:45:55 2015 UTC,Cigarette companies are doing shit a lot more evil than this commercial. Maybe you should spite them instead.
FellowKids,3cfadn,VonSandwich,-2,Wed Jul 8 19:20:32 2015 UTC,"what ""evil"" do you think cigarette companies are doing? providing a tasty and relaxing service to people exercising their freedom of choice?"
FellowKids,3cfadn,summa,9,Wed Jul 8 23:01:48 2015 UTC,"LOL! Please tell me you're joking.  I'm hesitant to even suggest this, because you seem like a tobacco company apologist, but if you even tried Googling anything similar to ""evil things tobacco companies do"" or, I'm sure even any tobacco company's wikipedia page, or watched this,, you will probably find some good evidence of evil.  BTW, I smoked for about 5 years up until this March. I still enjoy the occasional cigarette when I'm drinking, thanks to my freedom of choice. Just because I've enjoyed a product does NOT mean the company that produces them isn't evil."
FellowKids,3cfadn,VonSandwich,-2,Thu Jul 9 04:23:22 2015 UTC,"LOL! Please tell me you're joking.   I'm not! Thanks for saying please ;)   you seem like a tobacco company apologist   I'm not any kind of ""apologist"" because reality doesn't need my confirmation to continue in its current state. People have been smoking for a long time and probably always will - tobacco companies provide a service. At its base level, that's as simple as it is. Maybe in the process of providing said services, they do some things you don't like. So does every other industry that currently exists. The fast food industry harms people too, are they ""evil"" like the tobacco companies?   if you even tried Googling anything similar to ""evil things tobacco companies do"" ...you will probably find some good evidence of evil.   If I googled ""jay z is a member of the illuminati"" i'd get lots of evidence of that, too. Even if it's true, what does it matter to me? I have the option to not smoke, so does everyone else. A better comparison would be, as stated earlier, literally EVERY OTHER industry that currently exists. They're not benevolent helpful entities. They exist to make money. Grown adults shouldn't believe in ""evil"" past a certain age, as they should understand its subjective nature and tendency of the beholder to apply the term rather liberally. As I stated earlier, I'm not joking. You may not agree with me, but I don't think my position is as laughable as you make it out to be."
FellowKids,3cfadn,summa,3,Thu Jul 9 06:53:17 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with you, I believe ""evil"" exists despite subjectivity, and I find your opinions to be at the maturity level of a freshman in college who has only just recently heard a second side to every story, and now ONLY believes that second side."

These companies have managed to pump enough money into congress to be allowed to put several MAOI's into cigarettes, making it even harder to quit, and even more additives to ensure a slow even burn.

You're also aware that ""health"" isn't a tangible thing that can be entirely quantified?   and you think the ones telling you not to smoke are evil?   No, I actually don't believe in ""evil"" because I'm not a child. Oh cigarette companies put harmful chemicals in cigarettes? I know. I haven't convinced myself they're my friends or that they have my best interests in mind. They sell cigarettes, that's what I want from them and nothing more.

FellowKids,3c3j1c,OrangeredValkyrie,34,Sat Jul 4 14:01:25 2015 UTC,"Out of those three things it is by far the hardest thing to fake. A face is way more complicated than either a fingerprint or a 4 number code.  Further, take a step back here. Do you really think you're more expert in matters of security than MasterCard? Don't kid yourself.   Truth is there are lots of ways around any security feature. One of the things companies specialize in doing is closing these gaps. I'm sure this is a very secure method they have devised."
FellowKids,3c3j1c,brilliantretard,23,Sat Jul 4 18:14:45 2015 UTC,"What you're forgetting is margin of error. A fingerprint and a PIN are always the same, but someone's face, or rather, the look of it, is constantly changing. The program needs to account for this by having fairly high margins when determining whether or not the person in the photo is the account owner. People's faces are posted everywhere on the Internet; their PINs and fingerprints aren't. Also, just because the people at MasterCard are security experts, doesn't mean they're the best in the business. While it's hard to say for sure until the program rolls out, I think it's a safe bet that the fingerprint and PIN technology we've relied on for decades will be far more reliable than the facial recognition we're still working on.   This is also ignoring the fact that taking a selfie at the cash register is ridiculous and makes you look like a twat."

FellowKids,3busrv,razorbeamz,99,Thu Jul 2 16:46:00 2015 UTC,"My sister owns this book.  /u/musicaldefiance, come give a review!"
FellowKids,3busrv,MusicalDefiance,77,Thu Jul 2 14:05:02 2015 UTC,"I've had this book since I was about 12 or 13. I still have it today. For me, it was like a book literally written for me when I was in middle school. It isn't quite as bad as you think but there is some nonsense.  Here's a quick recap. Gamer Girl is a book about a girl named Maddy who ends up going to a new school when her newly divorced mom moves her and her sister to her grandma's, and in a classic trope she manages to piss off the biggest asshole in the school, Billy Henderson, by doing some dumb bullshit thing on the first day. This ends up giving her the name ""Freak Girl"". Maddy also enjoys drawing manga, and is actually pretty good at it. Anyways she finds one of the boys, Chad Murray, that's hanging out with her new bully to be really cute, and of course naturally he's not super active in the bullying. Maddy's life soon becomes hell because of her new bullying problem and she can't seem to get a break. Though because of her drawing skills, she slowly manages to attract a group of friends interested in her hobby. Later we meet Maddy's father, who was literally divorced from her mother for too often playing the MMO, Fields of Fantasy. As a gift of sorts, he sets Maddy up an account to play the game because she had always been interested in it, but he was too busy to play it with her. She starts playing with the beautiful sorceress Allora and immediately starts getting her ass kicked because she wasn't paying attention going outside a village. Then another player, Sir Leo, comes to save the day. Maddy and this mystery player begin to blossom a friendship at this point, and later her dad has to give her a talk about internet safety.  No real names given whatsoever. Bummer. Back at school Maddy is slowly but surely making friends and she starts an anime club led by her apparently cool and interesting teacher, Ms. Reily. Maddy also bumps into Chad a bit more and they start becoming more acquainted, blossoming a friendship. She and Sir Leo also become more acquainted throughout the story as well and their relationship blossoms into a romantic one. A manga competition happens to be coming up in their town, led by her anime hero, so Maddy jumps at the chance and starts drawing out the love story between the handsome Sir Leo and the beautiful Allora. One night while playing FoF though, something seems wrong, as Sir Leo seems a bit off and more flirtatious than usual on the game. Maddy had earlier on found out that this player was actually Chad Murray after much suspicions with who he could possibly be, and she had finally after such a long time decided to tell him the truth about her identity. But Sir Leo immediately acted out into a laughing fit upon hearing the information, insulted her, and broke Maddy's heart. The next day at school, the manga pages that Maddy had painstakingly painted were littered all over the school, ruined and mocking Maddy and her feelings for Sir Leo. The culprit was clear and Billy and his cronies were immediately suspended from school. The next few days would be comprised of Maddy's anime club friends helping her to redraw the pages of her manga without her knowledge. Maddy still went to the competition in hopes that she could gain some more time to recreate it with her story, when who else but Chad storms in to give her the newly created manga. He apologizes for his friends being assholes and ruining her manga, and also professes that Billy was the one playing as Sir Leo that night. He tells her that he reported the incident to the principal and got the goons expelled, and also orchestrated the recreating of Maddy's manga. Naturally it ends with the two being delighted with who was behind the screen, and they end up kissing. The story ends with Maddy and all her friends out eating together.  I skipped a lot but I tried to nail the important things. It's not as ""Z0mg I'm a Gamer Gurl!"" as you would think. Silly and generic, totally, but for a girl in middle school obsessed with Runescape and drawing crappy anime characters, it was a treat."

Usually it's ""my parents divorced and now I have to move to a new school where I don't know anybody"" and that's the exposition of the film. Generally, the character is a bit outcast. The climax is usually the main character redeeming his or herself to all the people at school who outcast him/her (I.e. When the shy girl reveals to be Radio Rebel and all her problems so realistically disappear, or when Lemonade Mouth wins the battle of the bands). Just generic tweenage plot material."

I bet the right author could write an awesome story about your life... but not the one from this book. It totally sounds like he/she is too busy trying to be 'hip' and to cash in on a market by really diving into the teen angst."
FellowKids,3busrv,EcoleBuissonniere,7,Thu Jul 2 18:29:23 2015 UTC,"It's surprising how much mileage a great artist can get out of completely ordinary things. Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles and The Seventh Continent, for example, are, except for their climaxes, pretty much nothing but normal people doing uninteresting normal things, and yet are absolute masterpieces."
FellowKids,3busrv,MiklaneTrane,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:05:37 2015 UTC,"Well, remember that young adult fiction is less often about Big Important Things when compared to literary fiction because, to young people, the little things are earth-shattering."

Not Elfin like fucking toy making midgets from the North Pole?  God damn I bet the contents of the book contain emotes and drawings. This reminds me so much of that fucking penguin of doom thing."

It was about how to change everything about yourself to appeal to specific male sterotypes. she thought it would help me talk to boys in highschool. but it had advice like : how to get a surfer guy  use the lingo, ask him to get some Za and hang ten at the beach. where to find him ; At the beach pulling a sweet trick on his board.  how to get a jock  Use the lingo, ask him about the recent scores on the game, find out what team he likes wear their jerseys, learn the popular rivals and make fun of them where to find him : in the locker room or on the feild.  so on and so forth. Thank god i never tried any of these tactics, the early 890's were just about the worst time for a teen to get dating advice from magazines and teenbooks, the advie was terrible.  At one point the book told me that i shouldn't try to get with nerds because while adorable they are social suicide and that I would have to be really smart to talk to them so it would be too much work for very little pay off.  I don't think my mom read the book before buying it. She also gave me a guide on how to become a cheerleader."
