That, combined with them not really ""getting"" how big a deal it can be to people leads to unintentional insensitivity. It's tiring. So tiring. But they honestly don't know any better. If there was some sort of education process about colorblindness, not like an awareness campaign, but actually learning about it in elementary/middle/high school biology or something, I think people would be a lot more understanding on the whole."

Garfield contracts a rare illness called Sakutia, which is lethal to every species except the West African green monkey. To save his life, his father uses an untested serum to change him into a West Africa green monkey for 24 hours, so that the virus could die out. The serum has the unintended effect of turning his skin and hair green, and granting him the ability to metamorph into any animal of his choice. (source)"

I suspect the issue is that EnChroma lenses are not just standard colour filters but rather they are cutting specific wavelengths of light which is hard to reproduce as a photo.

ColorBlind,3dzj5m,Patneshekchangeup,7,Mon Jul 20 20:16:17 2015 UTC,"Not to link to my own comment, but just as an FYI, as I said here and was backed up by /u/EnChroma, you may see a difference between the two videos, but this IS NOT an accurate representation of what you will see when you actually wear EnChromas, if they work for you. Phone sensors work entirely differently than human retinas, so no phone picture or video through the lens will be an accurate representation, or even a film picture. It has to be on your eyes to tell you what it's gonna look like, this kind of video or picture will just severely diminish how it actually works. I own the glasses and have done the picture thing, but nothing compares to putting them on."
ColorBlind,3dzj5m,ihaverocketlegs,3,Mon Jul 20 20:33:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would have been shocked if this worked.  The way that the electronics interpret the image from an imaging sensor is extremely clever.  It is constantly adjusting the image -- white balance, saturation, brightness, contrast, etc.  Perhaps the starkest example of how this works is if you look at pictures taken with flash in a bar or some other dark location.  The difference between what your eyes see and what the camera capture is enormous.  Our eyes are constantly adjusting and interpreting colors and light levels, and cameras are doing the same thing -- just in a different way.   I wish that this worked, because it would make ordering a pair of the glasses much simpler. :/"

They do give a nice ""HDR"" type of vision, so I still like them as sunglasses, but they were definitely a bit of a letdown given all the hype.

My son is about to turn 7 and I tested him using Enchroma's site just now.  It was very interesting to see what he could not see.  His results were:  Moderate Deutan  Moderate deutans (“doo-tans”) have a moderate form of red-green color blindness caused by an anomaly in the M-cone photopigment gene sequence.  The results are counter-intuitive to me because the only numbers he wasn't able to see were pink on gray!  So as you suspect there is more to red-green color blindness than can't distinguish red and green.  He does have a hard time with our home alarm system though determining if the alarm is on.

ColorBlind,3dpwfx,plecko_fish,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:55:27 2015 UTC,Purple (?) on the left and pink on the right.   I also have protan but I'm pretty confident those are the colors. Pink is like purple with a bit more red.

ColorBlind,3dmsa7,BlackSparkz,5,Fri Jul 17 15:19:15 2015 UTC,Go to an eye doctor and get a real test. Computer tests are incredibly unreliable.  Is very unlikely that you're totally colorblind. You likely have one of four variants of red-green color blindness - most likely either Deuteranopia (no M-cones) or Deutranomoly (abnormal M-cones).
ColorBlind,3dmsa7,h2g2Ben,2,Fri Jul 17 15:55:33 2015 UTC,What's the difference between the 2?
ColorBlind,3dmsa7,patermortis,3,Fri Jul 17 16:36:26 2015 UTC,"M-cones are sensitive to medium wavelength aka greens.  L is long aka Red, and S is short aka blue.  Those with deuteranopia have no medium wavelength cones; those with deuteranomaly have mutated or abnormal medium wavelength cones that don't function properly.  Protans suffer from having no or mutated long wave length cones.  Protans and deuterans typically have problems with many of the same colors but interpret the visual input differently.  The vast majority of all colorblind folk in the US are one of the two deuteran types.  The 4 total protan and deuteran types are referred to as ""red-green"" colorblind, which can be very confusing.  If you got one person of each type to tell you what colors things where, there would be a surprising amount of disagreement.  If and when you go to see an eye doctor, ask to take both a plate test (usually an ishihara plate test, though others exist) and a D15 test.  Combined, you should be able to get a decent diagnosis."

ColorBlind,3ditob,Hagork,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:47:36 2015 UTC,"Thats great that you got these for your son. You seem like a great dad.   I can see how these glasses would help someone who has a major problem with their vision where it effects their daily life in a negative way. But as someone who's mildly colorblind, as you describe your son, these are kinda gimmicky. Sure it might be kinda cool to see everything ""pop"" a bit more at time, but it wouldn't be worth it for me to wear them all the time.  I have also found that having to ask what color something is at a store or my colorblindness coming up in a conversation is actually a really nice ice breaker."
ColorBlind,3ditob,SwolberhamLincoln,7,Fri Jul 17 03:15:18 2015 UTC,"While I absolutely agree that they are not necessary to survive, I definitely don't think of them as a gimmick.  Seeing flora as brown, or as my son puts it, 'everything looks dead', and being able to give him the ability to see grass and trees and plants as alive and green is hardly a gimmick IMO.  He's also something of an artist and being able to correctly see color when working with color medium I would think is helpful."
ColorBlind,3dk1q1,aureusFluvialite,5,Thu Jul 16 22:11:52 2015 UTC,"I think it's because white is the result of all of the cones being stimulated, so when a tritanope (only red and green cones) sees yellow, the yellow stimulates both red and green cones, which registers as white because technically all of the cones are stimulated. And tritanomaly is a weaker version of that.  something like that probably, I'm not entirely sure."

ColorBlind,3dhxmq,LongJonSamuel,6,Thu Jul 16 17:34:56 2015 UTC,"My opinion of Enchromas. (moderate/severe deuteranomalous)  To me they seem to have a reddish tint when I out them on. Eg. white surfaces get this tint. After some minutes my eyes adjust and white is white again, then when I take them off white surfaces have a slightly green tint until my eyes adjust.   I did the enchroma color vision test after I got the glasses and I got mild deuteranomaly as a result. Without them I first got severe deuteranomaly/complete deuter first time, then I got moderate after try harding and guessing my best another time.  With enchromas strong colours pop more. I notice color shades that I've never noticed before. Sometimes things will completely change color compared to my normal vision. One building that I was 100% sure looked pink with normal vision to me turned out to be green. After I learned it was green it stayed that way without glasses. Another time a brownish green pole became red, which was a much more distinct color change for my eyes. My normal vision did not change at all this time. I'm still not sure if my vision was correct with or without the glasses on this one.  The filter in the enchromas steal quite a lot of contrast. I need a lot of light to use them effectively, but even with a lot of light you still lose that contrast information. If you are in the sun, it can be difficult to see something in the shadows.   Personally I do like the enchomas, but I don't prefer to use them as sun glasses if I need to see a lot of visual details, like for sports or physical outdoors activities. For this I rather prefer my Oakley polarized glasses. Enchromas are great when you're out doing casual activities. They are especially great for viewing flowers. I also sometimes use them when I drive, although it does take some focus off the road because I'm staring at colored buildings.  All in all I do recommend them as they have added another dimension to my vision and allows me to see things I didn't see before, but I still prefer them as secondary sunglasses."

ColorBlind,3djiw7,ChowMeinBastard,3,Thu Jul 16 19:52:40 2015 UTC,"So I've got this big honking 60' TV in my apartment, and I had just downloaded this game Flower, which if you're not familiar is an indie game in which you control a petal flying through the wind in a series of colorless landscapes, pollenating flowers that make the surroundings burst into color. It was pitch black out, and I didn't have the lights on in my apartment so it was just as pitch black in my living room, and I had just gotten my CX-14s a week or so prior. So I figured I'd try. I went to the TV and turned the brightness up to a high setting, and slapped on the glasses. I did notice a difference, though not as much as you see in real life. It was definitely much prettier though, and the increased TV brightness made up for the glasses tint. But if you're getting the CX-25s, it'll be easier to see in a dark room like mine. I mean, you can always return whatever glasses you want, and I think glasses that make everything prettier would be your best bet."
ColorBlind,3djiw7,ihaverocketlegs,2,Thu Jul 16 22:27:55 2015 UTC,"The colours on TV are not quite all of them that appear in real life.  I would think the new LCD LED's would work better than the LCD florescent tubes (I find the quality of most DLP to be unwatchable.)   Since they are all a little different I would try the glasses or have you tried at a TV showroom and see how things look?  Note they usually turn the brightness up too high, but it might give you a good idea of which works better with the glasses than others."

ColorBlind,3dhknb,punchlaura,2,Thu Jul 16 09:34:32 2015 UTC,"Answers:   Yes there is a chance for the test to be inaccurate.  I have been diagnosed with both deuteran and protan anomalies before.  Ishihara tests (the ones with the colored dots) are decent but not the best tests for diagnosing color blindness.  D15 and D100 tests are better (most optometrists have a D15 test on hand and Ishihara plates), but the cream of the crop for colorblind testing is an anomalascope.  These are typically only found in university research labs and on military bases.  I've been searching for one that I could take a test on for years to get a better diagnosis.  BTW, color vision tests taken on a computer screen are very inaccurate due to the vast differences in display types and lighting when taking the tests in such an environment. I was super skeptical about these glasses (and still am) even before I learned they probably won't work on me as a ""strong protan.""  Shy of actually modifying the cellular structure of the eye, a person who is colorblind will never be able to perceive the same spectrum of color as a person with normal color vision.  BTW, they have done this to various lab animals.  Is it worth trying a pair of these glasses?  Sure, especially if it is relatively convenient for him.  I live in the Southeast and do not have access to these stores like someone in California would.  I'd be the first in line to test them, if a store opened near by.   IIRC Enchroma is working on glasses for people with protan type deficiencies.   How to handle this...?  Well that's kinda hard to say without knowing either of you.  Yes, watching those videos of people being moved so intensely by these glasses and then realizing the glasses probably won't work for you is heart breaking.  However, your friend has been living with the fact he is colorblind for at least 30 years, and the reality is these glasses won't give him the power to see colors his eyes cannot perceive, no matter what kind of colorblindness he possesses.     As I have aged, my desire to see the colors others see has diminished to the point of non existence.  I am, however, very vocal about being colorblind in an effort to spread awareness.  People are always fascinated that I perceive the world in a drastically different way than them.  They ask questions that I try to answer to the best of my ability, and I often hear ""I wish I could see what you see!""  That kinda sounds like envy to me, which I find ironically hilarious.  As they say, ""the grass is always greener on the other side,"" or more orange in my case."
ColorBlind,3di3mj,jefffff,3,Thu Jul 16 13:27:14 2015 UTC,"All i can say is keep at it. i'm moderate/strong deutan. i had no immediate affect at first but hours later, i started to notice extra ""colouryness"". over a week i began to see purple, pink, orange, bright green. Even after a week, new colours are being noticed. i'd recommend other to keep wearing for longer.  it's neuroplasticity at work. and it takes time."
ColorBlind,3di3mj,tisshin,2,Fri Jul 17 09:50:31 2015 UTC,"I got the CX-25 about a month ago and returned them after a week.  Enchroma rates me as a ""Strong Deutan"" with 75% chance of them working for me.  They may have worked but it was hard to tell if the colors were just mildly different because they were sunglasses or because of the color blindness correction.  Nothing wowed me, especially nowhere near the videos you see.  I went looking at flowers and wore them driving everywhere.  I do have to admit that it was mildly disappointing.  Certainly not Enchroma's fault but after seeing all these positive videos you kind of want it to happen to you.  I'm over it now but I do admit I was a little sad about it afterwards."

For them it's comic relief more than anything.  Like the time I was at a potluck dinner, and the person across the table from me switched places between my green tea and my orange juice, challenging me to find the correct one.  (Then she got angry when I didn't fail.)  There was the time my wife half-laughed, half-yelled at me when I dressed my daughter (age one at the time) in a clashing outfit.  I couldn't see that it clashed.  There was my brother-in-law who called me out as a liar because I happened to use the word ""multicolored"" in a Facebook status, believing I had no basis or right to even use that word, let alone understand what it means.  Or the woman who laughed her @$$ off at me when I avoided her question about the color of the new car I'd recently bought (I knew the color, but chose not to set up the ""what color is this"" series, or ""you're not really colorblind"" accusations.  I literally bought the car because I wanted a hybrid, not because I cared a wit about the color.)  Or this one, that for some reason bugs me the most:  a woman I know who has worked in education all of her adult life, and has become one of the strongest anti-bullying advocates I've ever known.  She was pro-LGBT rights before it was cool, before it was legal anywhere.  She's been known to advocate on behalf of disabled people of all kinds (physical, learning and emotional disabilities included).  But she decided to literally make fun of her colorblind father on Facebook because he's never known how to match clothes correctly -- or her colorblind son because he just recently learned the correct color of poop.  And yeah, I'll mention the time I was almost fired from my job for ""insubordination"" because I asked for help deciphering a color-coded work task that I couldn't see.  Yeah.  ""Comic relief"" or ""in the way"".  That's all we are."

ColorBlind,3copzj,LinleyMike,4,Thu Jul 9 15:34:08 2015 UTC,"This doesn't surprise me -- even though you're now seeing the colors differently, you can only compare them to the colors you thought they were before. So now that you're seeing ""true blue,"" it's still what you always thought was purple.  My mother mentions glasses like this every once in a while, and I keep telling her that even though it'd be great for seeing thing like grass and the sky -- things that I know are a specific color -- they won't help me tell what color a shirt is until I relearn what all of the colors are. And even then, I may just be too used to doubting myself... All in all, I'd think having glasses like that would be n awesome experiment, but I'd still take a friend along to help me pick out paint for my house."

I, first off, loved the way purple and pink looked when I put them on. Holy hell, right? But I kept looking at red things and going ""is that....pink?"" or I'd see something and go ""that's orange"" and my girlfriend would go, ""well, no, not really."" It took me a while, but I realized I was actually starting to see shades of colors that were never really clear to me. ""Golden"" yellow is one. ""Turquoise"" and ""seafoam green"" are others. It was days before my brain was actually able to go, ""Wait, that's not just green"". So much of what you see is your mind going off of experience prior to putting on the glasses. So when a full new color comes into play, it just goes, ""Nope. That's a trick"" for a little while. With repeated exposure, it's gonna get more amazing every time you put the glasses on. The world is gonna change for you if you're anything like me."

ColorBlind,3copzj,johnnyfanta,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:24:23 2015 UTC,"This could be depending on your severity of protanomaly. The glasses shift the wavelengths of light coming in, so reds that you were seeing as green will now come out as green, because they're being shifted into a wavelength your deficient red cone can see. So you may think the grass is orange even with the glasses, but that orange could just be green that you've always seen as orange because with a red cone deficiency, oranges can appear as greens. But you may also be on the more severe side of protanomaly, possibly even close to protanopia, so the effects of the wavelength changes of the glasses might not be so strong because there's minimal amounts of wavelengths the red cone can see in the first place. So say you could see about 30% of the colours your red cone should be letting you see, the glasses can bring that up to say 50-70%.  For me though, they don't work. I have Achromatomaly/protanopia. My red cones are next to nonexistent and my green and blue cones have deficiencies. Deficiencies severe enough that the glasses would barely help the two working cones. My eye doctor tells me I probably see very washed out colours, and the glasses would make those slightly less washed out. So while the glasses may not be helping you see some colours, enjoy it :)"
ColorBlind,3copzj,mrturretman,4,Thu Jul 9 21:30:53 2015 UTC,"Thats not really how they work, its not possible to ""shift the wavelengths of light coming in.""

I would not be the judge of whether or not to get them; you should probably just find somewhere close that has them if you can (I know that is rare)."

ColorBlind,3c2tpl,Hagork,2,Sun Jul 5 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"Even a mild-to-moderate deutan like me can only see a maximum of 25% of the shades that a normal person can.  When I said ""That is so different,"" I was not referring only to how red looks--I had always been able to see red--but I was referring to the difference between red and green--a difference that I could see maybe 50% of the time from a distance greater than 20 feet.  That other 50% was really annoying because I know they are complementary colors and should be very different.  My spectral overlap between them was not 100%, obviously, but was large enough to make trips to a rose garden boring.  Before, I would have to be right up close to see the difference between red and green.  Now, I can walk in a rose garden (I did today) and see red among the green from very far away (I touched on that in the video).  And now, geraniums are my favorite flower.  I literally could not ever see them before and now they kinda hurt my eyes to look at, almost.  My eyes are still adjusting to being able to see red against green so clearly.  And pink is almost an entirely new idea to me.  Purple makes more sense now, too.  But green is far more pronounced than it ever has been.  Also, just curious, what exactly was so moving about the video?  Just the ability to relate and empathize?"

ColorBlind,3c2tpl,HegHog,4,Sat Jul 4 10:57:57 2015 UTC,"I scored mild, too.  But that was when I really tried and had a couple guesses.  My guess is that I was pretty mild but leaning moderate.  The thing is that even if you and I are both mild, we still see at most 25% of the shades that people with normal color vision see.  It still was overwhelming.  Really being able to see red and green as completely different and being able to see pink from a far distance (whereas before I cold only see it from very close) is life-changing.  Even as a mild-to-moderate deutan, I still had to crouch down out of shock.  The glasses really do work, and even though they are expensive, they are worth it.  Seriously, skin tone exists.  It is almost as though I can see the blood pumping through people's skin, whereas before, everybody just looked bland.  It is amazing."

ColorBlind,3c2tpl,Shatbird,2,Fri Jul 10 13:11:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for asking my opinion!  I would say that if you're willing to pay slightly more than $400, go for it.  I showed them to my maternal grandfather (from whom I received the colorblindness gene) and his brother, also colorblind, both worse than me.  Grandpa said that he was impressed with them and immediately asked if he could get them with his prescription, to which I answered yes.  But my point is that they will most likely work even for an older person with worse color vision than mine, such as your father.  To get the glasses, visit enchroma.com and from there the ordering process should be easy; I wouldn't know, though since they were a surprise.  And sorry for the delay in response.

You see things differently and it can change your perception of an event that is viewed by normal vision people. I know that for me it's led to some of the best comments I've gotten on art work and wowed people when I tell them what color I see something as. Really I guess I'm just a little upset that some people think of it more as an impairment instead of a learning tool and unique trait about yourself. If nothing else it can be a great conversation piece and with the glasses you can always switch back and forth between seeing and colors more normally and not. That's just my two cents though.

ColorBlind,3bnh85,LazerParroT,3,Tue Jun 30 20:46:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your understanding. Reading things like this as a manager you feel sick to your stomach because the offer came from the right place, we wanted to divert some resources to get Dads their gift by fathers day and managed to do for some people, but we still screw a lot of things up just by the nature of trying to create an exception to something which is overwhelmed to begin with. When you stuff something like that up its worse than not offering it in the first place.   It wont be a month, we are hard at work. If you have a Cx-25 and you want to move over to the Cx-14 it would move it forward quicker. Same with Apollo vs Explorer (just got boxes and boxes of the latter in today). We are able to handle order changes faster than the endless mountain of ""where is my order"" inquiries, which do not do anything to actually get product in peoples hands."

I won't be doing myself any favors here but I actually wanted to move from 14 to 25s since it wasn't me ordering she got the wrong ones. I know it'll delay it longer but I'm patient, I just started getting worried due to previous experiences elsewhere. Should I just send an email with subject as something like 'Order change for order number XXXXXX'? Again, I'm totally willing to wait another month or more.   Also, thanks for at least trying to get them out for Father's Day! It was a really cool gesture at the very least."

ColorBlind,3bolcu,Epic2112,6,Tue Jun 30 21:53:43 2015 UTC,"/u/enchroma said that they were interviewing folks fairly recently.  Some realities:   If you're hiring someone to be customer facing you'd ideally want them to be very good at dealing with customers.  It's hard to find good employees who can keep their cool in light of a lot of customer pressure. You then need to train these people.  You'd also like to be able to offer the long-term employment, so you can get the best candidates.  Staffing isn't some miracle that happens and solves all your problems. Hiring and training is a long process that takes time away from work your team could be doing."
ColorBlind,3bolcu,h2g2Ben,2,Tue Jun 30 22:26:45 2015 UTC,"They even said they hired people and some didn't even show up for work.

I usually don't like quoting him like some sort of philosopher, but I think Louis CK said it best. ""How quickly he thinks the world owes him something he only knew existed 10 seconds ago.""

ColorBlind,3bffn1,Jerfy,2,Sun Jun 28 20:00:15 2015 UTC,"Good review!   I personally believe that the ""persistence effect"" happens because you start paying notice to colors more. I have also used the glasses for hundreds of hours (everytime I go out and the sun is at least partially shining), but the difference between wearing the glasses and my normal vision is always big. Anyway, the glasses just don't make your cones better - the development in differentiating colors must therefore be psychological, unfortunately.  I still love the glasses. Visiting a huge rhododendron park was one of the best moments of this summer. Especially some oranges, that I can't easily tell apart from greens, popped out amazingly. It seems that the glasses make bluish greens like teal (which is see as almost grey) more green, yellowish greens more green, orange becomes redder (interestingly a neon orange color turns to pink), red loses the rest of the yellowness to pure red, pink is much more vivid and less blue and the same is true with purple and violet. Yellow loses some of its power (and I guess some yellow browns too then), but it doesn't actually matter, because normally yellow and blue dominate my vision so totally."

A lot of weird childhood arguments about the colors of things made a ton of sense after that realization though.

My boyfriend (still a regular friend now) at the time, who has excellent fashion taste and color vision, was also a major reason I realized I was colorblind. We ended up doing a test with our friends to see what I could see. It was pretty clear that I'm red weak, it's like all reds are severely diluted, but I think I can still see them a bit.

They were pink. That caused them to crack up because they're children, heh.  That's lucky you found out early. Probably helped to know that you were wrong about a color :P"
ColorBlind,3ajrob,mMelatonin,2,Tue Jun 23 15:59:05 2015 UTC,"Ah nice! I mean, I can totally tell she's a redhead, her hair is a flaming ginger-crimson mane. But I know I'm not seeing it the way other people do is all. Makes me a bit sad, yeah. It's my favorite hair color easily.  I could have sworn my parents told me that my dad and brother were both colorblind too, but lo and behold, when I got EnChromas and told them I'd let them try them out too, they said ""What? We're not colorblind."" So I'm the black sheep (or grey sheep, it's more fitting). Hahaha yeah I get the colorblind quiz all the time. I'm only mild thank goodness, but it's still enough to confuse a lot of stuff very easily.  I definitely think finding out early was good. Saved me a lot of confusion and arguments, knowing when just to back off."
ColorBlind,3ajrob,ihaverocketlegs,3,Tue Jun 23 16:38:09 2015 UTC,"It's mostly mild for me too, sometimes I look down at my own hair across my pale ass freckled ginger arms and the difference is startling. Right now I'm wearing a white jacket and I can tell how my hair is red, although it's not flaming red. Or maybe it is and I can't see how red it is, haha. I have people slow down their cars and say stuff like ""I love gingers!"" sometimes, so it's definitely noticeable to other people. It's usually obnoxious or scary though.  That's really funny about your dad and your brother. I've been wanting to try EnChromas myself, I'd love to see the world how most people see it."
ColorBlind,3ajrob,mMelatonin,2,Tue Jun 23 19:41:04 2015 UTC,"You have very pretty hair! It's definitely easier to tell when you guys are more pale. I have a friend who's whole family is redheads, but her sister can actually tan, and when she's bronze I have such a hard time telling that her hair is red. The same shade looks so different on darker skin tones. I have issues with strawberry blondes in person. That shade of hair was invented to mess with me. I stare at it for like 5 minutes trying to gauge the color. But yeah, catcalling is never cool. My gf gets her fair share of hair based comments too, a good amount from passing cars.   EnChromas are awesome. I know they don't fix EVERYTHING to make your color vision perfect, but man, I swear to god I've seen purple and pink for the first time after I put them on. And everything has a very definite edge, I don't see things blend and mesh together with them on. I wrote a review here if you're interested."
ColorBlind,3ajrob,ihaverocketlegs,2,Tue Jun 23 19:49:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, the contrast helps a lot. I have a difficult time with people who are more tan and have red hair as well. Also thank you! I've been growing it out since I was 20 (I shaved it all off completely for kicks), and it's right at my butt. I'm planning on letting it grow as long as physically possibly then cutting it back off to its current length and donating what I have left to an adult wig making charity. Nothing against kids, it's just that they get more donations and adults don't grow out of their wigs and they can't grow hair back as well. I keep my hair trimmed every few months and use good shampoo and conditioner to keep it healthy. My stylist told me they'll be very happy to receive my hair at the charity.  But yeah, catcalling is no fun :(  Strawberry blonde drives me nuts too, I can't tell what the hell it is. I'll read your review, thanks."

ColorBlind,3a8dmc,Willeth,3,Thu Jun 18 05:01:20 2015 UTC,"Twitter shorthand. A popular way of doing polls on Twitter is to ask people to retweet (RT) or favourite (fav) a tweet to see which is preferred. I think it's likely this image was taken from one of those.  It's always a flawed poll, of course, because one option spreads it to your followers whereas another doesn't, but that doesn't stop people from doing it."

We (I, Tony the CEO) have been dialing back activity in this sub for a little while. The community collectively knows enough about us now so its not necessary.  All of our support people are busy with support. We dont have marketing people. We are all collectively way too busy dealing with the orders we have to try and scrounge more off of Reddit and add to our problems.  But I hear you. The years where we had no customers and a quirky product the sub really kept us going. We just didnt know many color blind people in person so it has been really helpful. Its a big part of why we give the sub discount. This is not the right place for people to post about customer service issues etc. and we discourage that, but we have been struggling to keep up with support requests so it has spilled over here, not really by design. We dont want to mess up r/colorblind, we are just overwhelmed and this is the lone, active color blindness forum around.  I really like seeing the amazing reviews people post. They are all real and not our doing. They are an organic part of the community: people with CVD sharing their experience with the condition after trying a new product for it.

Genetic therapy is the answer for colorblindness and I believe that we will see that in our lifetime.  But sometimes I can ""see"" things that normal people don't notice, like color intensity and contrast.  To me that might be worth having to hold up my ethernet wires together to find the darker one (which is brown) vs the lighter one (which is green).  Thank god they don't put purple in there with the ethernet cables!"

ColorBlind,3a43pz,Rmaurya,3,Wed Jun 17 01:59:26 2015 UTC,Difficult to say how long the effect lasts but I noticed that immediately after having worn the glasses for a few hours colors seem more vibrant. One example was that the next day I noticed on my desktop an orange pop up that comes every time for the last two years but had not noticed that before. I always thought it was a green one. I asked this time because u was sure it was orange. And it turns out it was orange. This is all without the glasses.
ColorBlind,3a43pz,Asmordean,3,Wed Jun 17 04:57:29 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't say that the world looks depressing without the glasses! My suggestion would be to try it and if I understand correctly the wow effect is really for deutans. I was an engineer in past life and still a quant/strat problem solver, the optimization problem as understood from the website and the patent is just a starting point. I believe there is a lot of scope for this technology to evolve. Bottom line is that if you treat them as sunglasses for now and prescription glasses later, once it is far more mature then it is fair to just treat them as sunglasses for now. At least that would be my take."

With the glasses they are absolutely green.    The biggest thing for me was yellow signs.  I can see yellow without them, and they always looked yellow. However with the glasses on they go from a bright yellow to one that says ""I AM YELLOW! LOOK AT ME FOR I AM BRIGHT"""
ColorBlind,3a43pz,BadgerGoneWild,2,Thu Jun 18 01:48:52 2015 UTC,"Can you explain more about on vs. off? How often do you take them off for?

I'm considering getting the glasses, but my concern is that I won't be able to take them off without everything looking depressing, meaning that I'm condemning myself to wear glasses indefinitely (when I don't already have to wear any prescriptions).  What's your take on that?"
ColorBlind,3a43pz,BadgerGoneWild,2,Wed Jun 17 05:01:15 2015 UTC,"I've had mine for a year.  It's more like the days I can wear them are more joyful, and the days I cannot are just normal."

I had the same fear about thinking I'd never want to take them off, well it's not true. Sometimes I just don't feel like it if I'm tired or my eyes are watery, but I think that's because I'm just not used to wearing glasses at all. The effect is subtle for me that it's almost close to what I see normally except for some of the main things others mention (traffic lights, sky, grass, trees, etc) which make it worth it to me. I see new things I've never noticed all the time.   Example: Apparently, a Newport cigarettes box is green! I grew up with my Dad smoking those and I always thought they were grey.

ColorBlind,399qd3,Unuhi,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:33:41 2015 UTC,Neat paintings. I turned off my inverted colors to have a look what they might look in regular view - and I can't tell your colorblindness from the picture.  (I would paint in extremely loud and bold colors; your color schemes look more normal and muted to me)  What are your least favorite colors?
ColorBlind,399qd3,ClumpOfCheese,2,Thu Jun 11 08:58:17 2015 UTC,"I do try to keep my colour choices pretty simple.   I think the muted palette is the biggest 'tell' with my work as far as indicating my colourblindness.   I start with pretty light values against small amounts of extreme contrast (usually small flourishes of true black) so I have a light washed out tones against a small amount of of dark. Then I try to paint in the rest of the colours in layers of intensity till I reach a medium value between the lighters and darkest points in the image.   I seem to err on the side of a bit muted, because I guess I am a bit scared of diving in and making the painting really vivid but with the wrong colours. I am unable to tell if the red values are too extreme so I dial it back across the board.   Another fun fact is, my colourblindness seems to have robbed be of the ability to see colours 'clash'. I hear people saying it all the time, like ""oh, blue and green clash"" I don't actually know what that means. That would be another reason I'm a bit gun shy with colour.   My least favourite colours would be dark greens and browns, because I have no way of telling them apart. I am a little better with blue and purple. But not much."
ColorBlind,399qd3,Spekl,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:55:16 2015 UTC,A lot of color clashes depend on culture and fashions. In Italy: dark blue and black together = a mortal sin. Anywhere else in the world: those colors are ok.

ColorBlind,382piv,bobbertmiller,14,Wed Jul 15 06:14:07 2015 UTC,"I'm actually not in the sub that I expected to be in, so I'll concede that you might have some colour deficiency."

I am pretty sure that you don't need switching primary colours to see the difference between them. I wouldn't call it ""dramatic"", but it is pretty super obvious.

ColorBlind,384nq4,jojon2se,2,Mon Jun 1 20:47:27 2015 UTC,Never seen a laser projector but they look cool. I'm a protan. When it comes to screens and photographs I can usually tell the image is more colorful and when I asked people if the image looks the same in real life they say it is. When I use the EnChroma glasses I cannot see any difference in any colors on any type of screen. They all look the same color and don't even change shades.  Given that displays can only show a limited amount of color I would think I can see all or most of the color range of displays. With that said I have trouble telling the difference between pure green and yellow on monitors. It usually takes me a second or two staring at it to tell the difference. Put yellow and green text next to each other and they look almost the same to me. Same with blue and purple and reds and browns.  There is this electronic billboard in town that looks normal without the EnChroma glasses but when I put them on the billboard turns green. I think the glasses filter out the red/blue wavelengths the sign uses.
ColorBlind,384nq4,jgpip,2,Tue Jun 2 11:43:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, certain electronic billboards, like the ones used in Times Square, turn puke green with ECs. Which is fine, very few places require that much electronic display. Just a thing I've noticed."
ColorBlind,384nq4,ihaverocketlegs,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:16:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks guys.  Sounds like the LEDs in those billboards span some rather unfortunate ranges... I could absolutely see coming television sets, with quantum dot backlights, becoming a serious problem for protans, instead of the other way around, if the designers go too far with spreading out the primaries (maybe even past average peak response), in the race for more vibrant colours...  This actually prompts a follow-up question: Have either of you any experience with Dolby Digital 3D?  ...and here I'm speaking both with the system as a whole, and checking out what the glasses alone do, goggling the real world. Simply left eye mostly blind to red, and a little better for the right, perhaps?  http://static.trustedreviews.com/94/6490ed/8d6d/10043-dolby3dfiltercharacteristicssmall.jpg  Ho hum... Wonder if one could calibrate the frequency response of one's cones ""simply"" by individually in-/deflating them to suitable heights...

ColorBlind,3817zg,LazerParroT,3,Mon Jun 1 09:20:26 2015 UTC,"I purchased the 14s and am glad I did.  The 14s are fine on cloudy days. You could even wear them inside if you really wanted to, they aren't super dark but probably a bit too much.  For me the effect is there with the 14 but it's subtle.  Enough that I am not going to return them but I think I would have just been disappointed with the 25s."

ColorBlind,3817zg,LotusEater888,2,Wed Jun 3 01:18:01 2015 UTC,"IMO - Most days out of the year I'd go with 25s. When you're driving on a super sunny day it's a little darker in your car with tinted windows anyway. Plus where I live there are always some clouds out and I'm hardly ever just standing in the sun and not under an awning or covered porch.   But if he spends a lot of time outdoors directly in the sun, like hiking camping, water sports, then I'd go with the 14s."
ColorBlind,3817zg,stubborn_Analyst,2,Wed Jun 3 16:43:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks. That's good feedback. I talked to him about it last night and he got all defensive. I just want him to experience colors more vibrantly. I want to share that, but somehow he takes that as me highlighting what he thinks that I think is a deficit. It was the craziest conversation/argument. Bizarre really. I won't be surprising him. I think he'd just be mad. I'd love him to be able to enjoy the colors of the flowers on the porch, or see our kids' eye colors.  Or heck, his arrest me red camaro.   If I were to get them, it would likely be the 25s. We live in PA so the days are short in the winter. Seems like a good balance.   Anyway, thanks for your reply."
ColorBlind,3817zg,LotusEater888,3,Thu Jun 4 02:21:57 2015 UTC,"Technically these glasses will not allow him to see colors he can't already see because they block wavelengths in between colors, not add colors. They make it easier to distinguish differences in some colors. It more so makes your mind think you see new colors which is the point. I mean that like, if he sees the same object everyday and doesn't pay it any mind, the glasses could help distinguish that objects color from the background causing it to stand out more, he could then notice it and think ""man I've never noticed that object was that color!""  Yeah, I understand how he could get upset about it. Especially if you said..   I'd love him to be able to enjoy the colors of the flowers on the porch, or see our kids' eye colors. Or heck, his arrest me red camaro.   It does has the best intentions, but you have you to realize that what he sees is what is always has seen, what he finds beautiful is already beautiful, the love for his kids will always be his love.   If you tell him he can't see it the right way or how beautiful it is but he's missing it, then of course he'd be upset. Maybe because he's hearing it as, you can't possibly enjoy life like everyone else or you are unable to have the same level of love I have for our kids/flowers/cars. I bet he loves his red camaro and you're telling him he doesn't even have a clue how red it is. It could be discouraging.  I'm sure he knows he will never see things the way others do, and that will not change. Nothing will ever ""cure"" him so bringing his colorblindness up in the wrong way could be just a reminder that he's less than perfect and you want him to be more.  Of course he could be thinking none of these! It's just my perspective being colorblind. A lot of people don't feel it affects them in any way at all. He might love all of those things already even if it's slightly different then what you see. Its all he's ever known.   Have you thought, what if the glasses don't work for him. They may have no affect if you don't know exactly what type of colorblindness he has (and I don't mean just red/green colorblind, that's too generic). If they don't work then he will have to continue living and seeing everything the same way he already does. There's nothing wrong with that unless you convince him he's missing out on everything, you know what I mean?  Sorry to ramble!!  Regardless of all these things, your intentions are Great! With the right explaining and approach he could love the idea of trying these glasses out. The only advice I'd have on that is you have to just listen and not bring up the things you feel he is missing out on. Maybe they will make driving cool maybe not, but hell its worth trying out. 30 day return too if they suck. Just make it more casual. Best of luck!  ..  Edit: grammar, spelling, etc."
ColorBlind,3817zg,stubborn_Analyst,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:53:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your thoughts. I think my history o curiosity on his vision has highlighted it too much.  I'm going to let it rest for now. Or maybe forever. While he says he isn't interested, he has said things that he would only know had he read up on the glasses. I've considered if they didn't work, an how that could be a disappointment. Or perhaps if the difference as marked enough but the glasses weren't practical enough. That might be disappointing also. Im fascinated with trying to figure out what he sees, always have been. It seems like sometimes the context of the color makes a difference. Honestly, I don't fully understand it.

ColorBlind,37rqzg,Unuhi,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:22:39 2015 UTC,To me just the 1st and 4th look exactly the same (with my screen colors switched to normal to just have a look).
ColorBlind,37rqzg,mrisrael,11,Tue Jun 9 08:30:08 2015 UTC,Is this a joke? They look the same.
ColorBlind,37rqzg,RedL45,8,Sat May 30 02:29:51 2015 UTC,"Well, we're all colorblind, so they are all going to look like the colorblind version."
ColorBlind,37rqzg,lamblikeawolf,5,Sat May 30 06:56:43 2015 UTC,"As someone with normal vision - to those saying ""they look the same""... consider that the one on the left definitely has a lot more green tones to it, forcing a much greater deal of blending between the colors as they shift from yellow to blue. Whereas the one on the right looks a hell of a lot more crisp, with very clear and distinct patches of light vs. non-light in the sky, and on the rooftops/field area.  Also, the long band that stretches across the bottom of the sky is basically entirely made of greens on the left, and exclusively yellow on the right.  Edit: Also, in the sets of four pictures, the top right and bottom left pictures look ALMOST identical. But in the picture with the bird, the one on the bottom left has some bright, whiter/paler spots that are more yellow and less extreme than the shifts in the top right picture. You can't see this in the picture with cell division because none of those colors in the original picture display any kind of blending whatsoever."
ColorBlind,37rqzg,MechanicalYeti,6,Sat May 30 04:57:36 2015 UTC,"This certainly helps with understanding, but the paintings do legitimately look identical. I tried to go back to see what you mentioned and cannot."
ColorBlind,37rqzg,lamblikeawolf,2,Sun May 31 16:09:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe this will help.  In this manipilation, I just used the dropper tool to determine the RGB (red, green, blue) , hex (hexadecimal code), and HSV (hue, saturation, value) of the exact same identical pixel in each version. The one on the left, you can see is clearly lower on all three of the RGB values, presents a very different hex code, and is also in the ""101"" part of the hue range, as opposed to the ""60"" part of the hue range. So, even if those pictures LOOK the same, the one on the left is in the ""green"" range for colors, wheras the one on the right is in the ""yellow"" range for colors.  In this picture all I did was invert the colors. Depending on your type of color blindness, you may be able to more clearly see the purple/pink tones to the one on the left, whereas those are entirely missing from the one on the right. It is entirely blue. This is due to the fact that green is opposite red/pink on the color wheel, whereas blue is opposite yellow. This makes it easier to distinguish.  Finally, this picture of the birds all I have done is circled the parts in question. To me, the top of the birds head, and the patch on the wing look whiter in the bottom left picture, and yellower in the top right picture.  I hope that helps distinguish them some for you!"

ColorBlind,37o76k,whydoyoulook,-1,Fri May 29 14:14:38 2015 UTC,"Stevia:       Stevia (/ˈstiːvɪə/, /ˈstiːvjə/ or /ˈstɛvɪə/)     is a sweetener and sugar substitute extracted from the leaves of the plant species Stevia rebaudiana.  The active compounds of stevia are steviol glycosides (mainly stevioside and rebaudioside), which have up to 150 times the sweetness of sugar,  are heat-stable, pH-stable, and not fermentable.  These steviosides have a negligible effect on blood glucose, which makes stevia attractive to people on carbohydrate-controlled diets. Stevia's taste has a slower onset and longer duration than that of sugar, and some of its extracts may have a bitter or licorice-like aftertaste at high concentrations.  The legal status of stevia extracts as food additives and supplements varies from country to country. In Japan, for example, stevia has been widely used for decades as a sweetener. In some other countries, health concerns and political controversies have led to various restrictions, or outright prohibition. The United States, for example, banned stevia in the early 1990s   and approved some specific glycoside extracts for use as food additives in 2008. The European Union approved stevia additives in 2011.      Image i - Steviol, the basic building block of stevia's sweet glycosides.

I'm no expert though! Although, I do know you can train yourself to be able to distinguish if something is a color you can't see well, which is why you might be doing better on your tests. Think of it like how most people don't see the difference between a lot of ""designer colors"" or minute variations in paintings, but an interior decorator or artist will be able to see the difference because they have trained themselves to look for it. I'm colorblind, but I'm also an artist. My eyes haven't gotten better, but since I started studying art seriously in college I began to be able to tell when something has a color in it I can't see. I don't know what the color is, or a lot of times what the shape of it is (like in the dot tests), but I know something is there."
ColorBlind,37hcp1,TheEmpiresBeer,5,Wed May 27 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"It may not be necessarily a biological improvement, but it could be a mental improvement!  Maybe through practice or life or whatever, your brain has gotten better at figuring colors out.  I feel like the same has happened with me.  I doubt my color vision itself has changed, but I feel a little more confident with things now.  Take bananas for example, as a child I had difficulty telling whether a banana was a young green or a ripe yellow, but now I have literally no issue with them.  It could be my brain adapting, it could be my eyes maturing, or probably a little bit of both."
ColorBlind,37hcp1,GooglesYourShit,3,Thu May 28 01:33:34 2015 UTC,"Same here. I'm betting that OP is experiencing a bit of ""practice makes perfect"", along with some brain rewiring perhaps.  I find that a lot of times I can see things that are red simply because I know they are red. For example, I have a lot of trouble with bougainvillea (a flowering vine thing). This particular plant really only comes in two different varieties, purple and red, and I don't have any trouble with the purple one. So whenever I see bougainvillea and can't figure out what color the flowers are, my brain fills in the blank and I can ""see"" the red simply because logically I know it couldn't be anything else.  It's kind of like one of those optical illusions where you see either a vase or two faces looking at each other. Once you decide which one you think it is, that's what you'll initially recognize it as every time you see it."

The fact is - decolourising don't work if the red and the green are the same luminosity (brightness).    If you could easily see read them in black & white. Then, the original red-green colour must have be made of different tones. So, we would've been able to read the colour version in the first place despite our colourblindness.   Since, we can't read it in colour - then it must have similar tone in b&w - so, we still can't read it de-coloured unless we filter out specific colour, such as red or green."

I think your premise is flawed. Multiple colors reduce to the same grayscale value. And the Ishihara tests rely on a color deficient's inability to distinguish between different colors of the same grayscale value - meaning that they're no contrast between them. If there were a lot of contrast between the relevant colors - either normally or in grayscale, it wouldn't be a test that distinguishes between color normals and color deficients."
ColorBlind,37bc7x,epicphoton,3,Tue May 26 13:26:46 2015 UTC,My guess would be that most black and white or grayscale filers do their magic based on the intensity of the color rather than the color itself so bright colors get shaded into lighter grays and darker colors get shaded into darker grays. (I think this is really a different term like luminosity but I'm not a color expert...)  Because of this red and green get changed to a similar color gray because they are of similar intensity.  If you had a filter that actually changed red and green to different value of gray then it would probably help.
ColorBlind,37bc7x,m_xt,2,Tue May 26 11:41:49 2015 UTC,"You end up giving yourself less information, not more. Ill explain this a couple different ways.   Two main ways of describing a color are RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value). These two systems produce the same results, as they don't change the way the color is displayed by your monitor. (Print studios use CMYK, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black, but we don't need to talk about that today.)  For RGB, those 3 values are coded in a 6 digit hexadecimal (16 value) code. 2 digits per color channel, 3 color channels. The most amount of a color is represented by FF, none is 00, medium is ~C8. This results in 256 options per color. 256*3 = 16,777,216 colors that can be described by 6 digits. Colors end up looking like this: #95FB12, light greenish yellow, #FFFFFF, pure white, #222222, dark grey, #520035, dark purple. Colors where the digits are the same end up being white/grey/black. Let's take an example of what happens when you decolorise. (Disclaimer: This example may not be 100% accurate in color values, but the concept is correct. )  You have an image with 3 colors, #115599, 664455, 00AA55. Greeny-blue, Reddish-grey, bluey-green. 3 different colors, all with about the same ""brightness"". Now to take out the color and turn them all to grey. Average the 3 numbers for each color channel. You end up with #555555, #555555, #555555. The same dark grey from 3 fairly distinct colors. You end up with only 256 different gray options, and ultimately, less information for your eyes.   With HSV, you provide hue, describing which color is mixed into the base ""grey"", saturation, how much color is added to the base, and value, how bright is the base, a grey color ranging from black to white. 3 pairs of 256 values. Same range of colors. To decolorise, remove the hue and saturation values entirely. You'll only produce your 256 greys, no matter what the original color was."

ColorBlind,37b5ny,h2g2Ben,1 point,Tue May 26 13:29:47 2015 UTC,"There is no one big line in the sand between 'strong' vs 'moderate' anomalous trichromacy. Just take from the test result that you are somewhere between 'Moderate' and 'Strong' in your colourblindness.   As was mention in this thread, with Ishihara-type tests (coloured dots tests) result can vary depending on your surrounding setting/environment/lighting, the type of your display/screen settings etc. it's hard to get accurate results unless properly administered by your physician. and then, you want to confirm it with something like a Farnsworth test. So, take any web base test results just as a rough guide only.   The way these Ishihara test tends to work, is that they try to find the 'tipping point' in colour confusion by a series of 'Right or Wrong' answers. There should be one correct answer for each picture in the test. So, the test are not looking for the level of confidence of how well you can see the number in the picture. but they just want to know ""if you see it"" or ""if you don't"".   When you do find that you can just make out the correct answer, may be you've found your ""tipping point"" (mind you, they're trick pictures in ishihara, as in 'it looks like a 3 but its actually 8' or 'looks like a 1 but really a 4' )"

ColorBlind,36xdon,ruifon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:08:02 2015 UTC,Electromagnetic radiation is light. Light comes to our eyes and eyes send a signal to brain. Then brain interprets different wavelengths of light as different colours.
ColorBlind,36xdon,Jyben,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:04:59 2015 UTC,"brain interprets   Yes. That's why colour is not a property of light.  The thing is, light usually has much more than a single wavelength, it has different frequencies with different intensities. Certain patterns stimulate our eye in some ways, that we will perceive as certain colour.  The reason I say colour is not a property of light, is that there are infinite ways; mixtures of frequencies; of light to be perceived as certain colour. And it is totally dependent of the colour cones we have in our eyes.  Saying colour is a property of light is like saying constellations are a property of the galaxy. It isn't. It's just a 2D projection of the position of the stars, and totally dependent of our position in the galaxy."

I definitely think of a colour when someone says Peach or someone say Turquoise, but others will use that word for similar colours.    Peach is sort of a pink/orange blend.  Sometimes, it's more on the pink side, and sometimes it's more on the orange side.  Technique there are other words for those, but people do not commonly use them.  So pink peach - means it definitely more on the pink side.  Where orange peach is still peachy with pink, but more toward the orange side of things.   Same thing with Turquoise.  Sometimes it's more blue, other times it's more green.  Technically the green should be called specific like seafoam, but most people do use that many words to describe a specific hew of those colours.

I would just be very careful to keep an eye on the striped wires when I untwisted them so I didn't lose track of the two.  Also, as long as they're the same on both ends you're usually fine.  So, if you screw up, screw up both ends."

ColorBlind,36nf6t,tross13,1 point,Thu May 21 03:13:20 2015 UTC,"No problem at all. The Oxy-Iso's do work very well, but in a different way. They're not great for extended wear but work very well for quick color checks. Serious fashion failure though."
ColorBlind,36nf6t,tross13,2,Thu May 21 03:26:20 2015 UTC,"I know, right.   But I just saw some more Oxy-Iso on Amazon which seem to be a decent color.  Not sure if new model or fake ?  Loos more like the Enchroma glasses. P.S. The purple ones are also there on Amazon"

ColorBlind,36ki4d,nikooo777,6,Wed May 20 01:29:08 2015 UTC,"I'm strong deutan (sometimes I test as moderate) so I'll do what I can to answer your questions. :)   Would the glasses give me a wow-reaction?   First things first though: Do not expect a ""WOW omg I'm going to cry"" type of result. Yes, some people have had this result but most people I have talked to in our colorblindness range get ""Oh, neat"" results. For me the glasses are somewhat helpful but not life changing.   Would I see new colors even tho I believe I see them all already?   You won't see new colors, just stronger versions of the ones you already know. Your MS Word example is a good one - the red will pop out a bit easier but doesn't look like something you've never seen before.   Should I get the 25 type of lenses or opt for 65/14? (I live in the southern part of Switzerland and we have many colors and it's often sunny, tho I don't usually wear sunglasses, unless I go hiking on the alps.   I would recommend going with the sunglass versions of the EnChromas because they are more generally useful, in my opinion anyway. Even the darkest lenses are not especially dark and are usable in just about any lighting, even indoors to some extent. This one is up to you though. I like that the sunglass EnChromas simply look like normal sunglasses.   My dad is much more colorblind than I am and his birthday is coming up soon as well, so I though that this could be a nice gift for my dad and myself (my bday is coming up as well hahahaha) but since I live in Switzerland and the shipping is 70$ extra, I wouldn't want to waste such money.   I'd say buy them for yourself and see if they help him. If they do, give him yours and get yourself another pair. :)  I hope that helps!"

The glasses make it easier to distinguish between reds and greens, and make colors in general seem stronger.  I haven't tried the indoor/computer glasses yet, but I am hoping to soon."

ColorBlind,36ki4d,EnChroma,3,Fri Jul 17 22:48:31 2015 UTC,"You are in the best grouping (moderate deutan) for experiencing the glasses, often the kind of 'wow' impact you are looking for. You are likely to see orange, which many people in this group do not.  25s or 14s will work well, 14s are available again in a few weeks. (3 or so)"
ColorBlind,36ki4d,EnChroma,1 point,Wed May 20 16:50:08 2015 UTC,"thank you for your kind reply. I'm really intrigued and want to try them. How can you say by the way that i'm ""likely to see orange""? I mean, i personally see orange, or at least, i believe i see it.  In fact, I believe i see all colors already, but I know for sure I'm colorblind (when i joined the army i was denied doing the army driving license because of that).  Anyway I'm looking forward to see more opinions and then I might buy them.  The only let-down is that my parents kind of disagree in me ""throwing away"" $400"
ColorBlind,36ki4d,EnChroma,3,Wed May 20 20:54:27 2015 UTC,"For many deutans orange blends into green and brown so it does not appear as a distinct color, you might not be that severe. You can always return them, though I would hold off ordering until the summer just because demand is so high you will be waiting a while. We are increasing production capacity as fast as we can."
ColorBlind,36ki4d,Aurua,1 point,Thu May 21 18:18:07 2015 UTC,"yes i will probably wait for the summer, as ordering now wouldn't make sense. I guess that after those videos that spread on 9gag you guys got a lot of orders.  Also I really have to be careful as shipping back and forth is 140$ + 35$ of import fees. I will certainly keep a very close eye on the matter as I'm very curious to see through these glasses.  By the way. is there a picture, anywhere, showing the world with and without glasses in front of the camera? I know it wouldn't be anywhere close to the reality, but it'd be interesting to take a look."
ColorBlind,36ki4d,thinsoldier,2,Thu May 21 20:33:42 2015 UTC,"No, the picture wouldnt work at all. If it did we would sure use it, and use the technology such that color blind people could see things on their Computer/TV full color."

ColorBlind,36e92s,lov3cat,4,Mon May 18 18:29:11 2015 UTC,"First off, let me say this - you are awesome.  So the glasses - I think I got really, really lucky, but I ordered CX-25 Explorers (large) in silver on 5/8 and received them on 5/14.  They said they were backordered when I ordered them.  I have a medium to large head and they fit perfectly.  I've had others try them on, and they looked and felt great even on their smaller heads.  The glasses themselves look very good and are high quality.  I may be biased, but I think you are making a solid choice!  When he gets them - you might want to video his reaction.  Even if you choose not to share the video (it's an emotional, personal thing) you'll enjoy having it for posterity.  But do remember, they affect people differently.  For some, the change is immediate, for others it takes a little time.  For me, it was somewhat in-between.  When I put them on, everything looked subtlety different.  Things looked sharper and colors overall looked more saturated.  But over the next 30-60 seconds, things jumped out at me.  The shades of green in the grass and on the trees - suddenly there were thousands of shades of green I'd never noticed.  Then reds started popping and I noticed flowers I hadn't seen before.  My great niece was there, wearing a lot of pink that suddenly actually looked pink!  And purples everywhere!!!!  I looked at my wife's eyes and they are the most beautiful color I've ever seen; at that point, it got pretty emotional.  And then it continued for the next hour - I kept 'noticing' more and more things I'd never seen before.  And now, days later, I still keep seeing new things.  Just remember that the brain is getting a ton of new information and it has to figure out how to process it.  This can take some time, but it's so, so, so worth it!  As for me, (I'm a strong deutan), I think the money spent on these was money very well spent.  They are pretty much my favorite thing right now.  I'm already planning a budget to allow for a pair of the CX65's, followed by a pair of the CX14s.  Good luck to you and your boyfriend, and PLEASE keep us posted on how they work for him!"
ColorBlind,36e92s,BrandonRawks,2,Mon May 18 20:36:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks very very much for your detailed comment- it's super thrilling and I especially loved the part about your reaction to your wife's eyes! Too bad mine are boring brown lol.  I went ahead and ordered the silver matte large Explorers today and am even more pleased I went with those after reading your reply.  Also you seriously lucked out on the shipping and are giving me some hope that I will receive these in time :D  Great tip on recording the reaction- will be sure to do that.  I'm thinking I'll keep mum on the purpose of the glasses until after he tries them on to see if they work or not (so as not to disappoint in case they don't).  But me being ever the optimist, i hope they blow him away  (and that I get an awesome video out of all this)  :)"

ColorBlind,36e92s,ihaverocketlegs,5,Mon May 18 23:34:07 2015 UTC,"Hi awesome Redditors:  Ok so I'm new to Reddit (which is probably obvious by my inability to get the text in the right place), but here I go.   I, like many others, saw the cool viral video about the colorblind dad seeing his kids eyes for the first time and learned about Enchroma glasses that way.  Truthfully when I first found out my boyfriend was colorblind, I thought it was just this cute quirky thing where he was terrible at matching his clothes and always had to ask whether something was red or green.. but secretly I also felt kinda sad that he didn't get to experience the colorful world like I did, especially since he's an artist at heart and loves nature, sunsets etc.  So obviously when I saw that video my immediate reaction was OMG WHERE CAN I GET MY HANDS ON THOSE?!   His birthday is coming up in 3 weeks and I have to haul ass to get him a pair.  I've been Googling incessantly all day but can't seem to find good pictures showing proportions on sizes, colors etc.  I'm leaning towards the Cx Explorers with the Cx-25 lens.  As far as size goes - he's 5'10 and has a medium sized head?  Lol so would the large lens size work best?  Also do guys prefer matte silver or black frames?    So anyone who's ordered these glasses, and especially the Explorers,  I'd love to know your thoughts and any pictures you'd be willing to share.  Thanks so much!"
ColorBlind,36e92s,EnChroma,2,Mon May 18 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"Fashion wise, matte silver looks best. I have the silver Explorers, and they look bomb on me, so good call. I also have a big ol' head, so I got the large frame. Are you comfortable posting or PMing a picture of your boyfriend, with something as a reference near him possibly? I know it sounds funny, but him with a group of people or near something that can give some sort of relative sizing can really help. If you're not comfortable with that, I can say that a lot of my friends have tried them on, not all of them with a head as sizable as mine, and I don't seem to recall any of them saying that they're too big for them or anything.  A couple things to consider: do you know how severe his color deficiency is? Or what kind he may have? The glasses don't work for people with rarer forms of colorblindness, or people for whom it's severe enough. If you can think of a sly way to have him take the test on EnChroma's website without tipping him off to your gift idea, you'd have a lot better a chance of knowing whether or not they'll work for him.  Helpful information: Lately they've been relatively swamped, so if you order them today, with 2 day shipping even, they still may not be there in time. You may have to just settle for telling him on his birthday that his gift will be there soon. Also, most issues you have with the glasses, including sizing or them simply not working, are fixable with their 30 day return policy.   /u/Enchroma may be able to help more with the sizing aspect."
ColorBlind,36e92s,ihaverocketlegs,2,Mon May 18 18:44:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your fast reply!  It's super helpful.   I'm kinda iffy about posting his picture without permission on here, lol... but I think he has a pretty average sized head- not too big or small.  So I'm guessing the large would work okay on him.  Does the actual lens size differ on the two, or is it simply just the width of the frames?  I thought about having him take the test on the EnChroma site but thought it'd be much cooler to have these be a complete surprise.  As far as I can tell he can somewhat make out very vibrant shades of red and green but most of these hues seem to look brownish to him.    Good tips on the ordering times- really crossing my fingers they'll make it on time. /u/Enchroma does it seem possible to get these by June 7?  :/  If not, would ordering the medium sized frames help?  You guys are awesome, thanks very much for your help."
ColorBlind,36e92s,ihaverocketlegs,3,Mon May 18 18:56:44 2015 UTC,"If it says ""in stock"" then it is likely, if it has to be backordered then 50/50.   Picking Cx-25 in Black Explorers, or the Hawk or SunForce is your best bet. On backordered items that is."
ColorBlind,36e92s,ihaverocketlegs,2,Mon May 18 19:39:30 2015 UTC,"No worries!  Don't post a pic if you don't want. Here's an even WEIRDER thing you can do, maybe. Measure his head while he's sleeping. They do have measurements on the site, so try and see how those do. The glasses do bend outwards on the hinges at the sides, so the medium would likely fit everybody, but they might look a little silly if they're too small, and could wear out the hinges after a while. I'm fairly sure it's a little of both, in terms of whether the frames or the lenses are bigger, but again, you'd have to ask EnChroma.  Well if he can see and recognize both red and green, that's a good sign, he probably does have the necessary cones for these to work, but there still may be a risk that these won't work for him. Personally I think it's worth the shot, as I tell everybody. I love mine, even though I'm only mildly colorblind. Plus they look so damned good on me.   Good luck. Your boyfriend's birthday is two days before mine! June dudes rule, good choice.  Edit: You're also a total sweetheart for doing this for him. Really."
ColorBlind,36e92s,248Spacebucks,4,Mon May 18 19:03:54 2015 UTC,"HAHA I love the stealthy measurement idea, will have to try that out today if possible.

ColorBlind,36e92s,248Spacebucks,4,Mon May 18 19:12:01 2015 UTC,"Of course! I just stuck an edit up in my last comment, but I'll echo it here. You're a goddamned sweetheart, this is such a wonderful gift to give somebody. I'm telling you this, if they work for him, he's going to wear them every day, as much as he can. And if they don't work, massive GF points for an unexpected and incredibly thoughtful gift anyway. But I hope very much that they find you two well and work for him.

ColorBlind,36cmwa,gdeest,3,Mon May 18 09:01:17 2015 UTC,"Go on your phone and download a game called Dr. Hue. You might be able to play the game a lot easier than most people. One of the really cool things about colorblindness is that we can distinguish lighter shades of colors from darker ones because our minds aren't busy trying to negotiate hues. You may be able to distinguish the colors of the words on the plates a little better due to that. It also may be a case of what I like to call Daredevil syndrome. When one of your senses is lost or doesn't work, your other senses often become stronger as you rely on them so much more. Since you and I have no problems seeing the color blue, you may be more used to picking blues apart, as long as they don't stray too close to green or purple.  Keep in mind, this is completely my invented pseudo-science and should not be taken as any kind of legit explanation. I'm probably incredibly wide of the mark. Just musing. That's a cool experience for you though, dude."

I wasn't good with either especially when the rocks would get chalk build up. Black became purple or white, red became orange, green and brown we're whatever the hell they wanted to be. Luckily my climbing partner wasn't colorblind so he would yell out if I was off route. It could still get a little frustrating."

In any case, I've been thinking about getting a pair of the colorblind glasses anyway, if they work for me maybe they'll help with this. I'm also going to buy a small laser pointer for my belay."
ColorBlind,3642rw,MeltBanana,1 point,Sat May 16 13:45:11 2015 UTC,I wear prescription glasses but hardly wear them when climbing. Especially top roping they get hit by the rope so often it's annoying. Ideally having a non colorblind partner or identifying the route is the best way. If you're new and have trouble holding on while figuring it out just think of it as an additional challenge that will help you build strength faster. Eventually holding on for an extra ten seconds won't be a big deal. Lead climbing is all about holding on for a few more seconds anyway so itll just help you be stronger for that anyway.
ColorBlind,3642rw,cuddlebadger,2,Sat May 16 15:35:39 2015 UTC,"I had this same problem when my gym stopped taping their boulder problems and just used the color of the holds.

It's one of the reasons I stopped bouldering."

If all you see is all you've ever seen, how could you really know what you're truely missing out on, you know? Its obviously enough to limit a lot of carrier choices.

After you've had them on a while you don't notice as much.  Anyway, sure I'd be happy to take a couple pictures. I had to leave early for the airport this morning and everything was still dark outside, so I took this picture of some red and green spatulas in my kitchen. Here's the scene without Oxy-Iso glasses:  http://i.imgur.com/zyu0OCy.jpg  I don't have too much trouble with these particular shades of red and green, but unless I'm paying attention I wouldn't necessarily notice that they are different colors. Now here's the same scene with the Oxy-Iso glasses held in front of the lens:  http://i.imgur.com/n0d8GJH.jpg  For me the red is now a brilliant orange and the green is a muted black/brown. It's very much a ""brute force"" approach but it really does work. There is absolutely no mistaking red and green with these glasses on.  Browns and oranges tend to have a warm ""glow"" to them, while anything greenish will have a darker, cooler hue to them. The one downside to these glasses is that certain shades of blue and purple that I was previously able to tell apart are now more difficult to distinguish. These scenarios are few and far between though."
ColorBlind,35zcl5,tross13,6,Fri May 15 14:25:49 2015 UTC,"The problem is, they are not the true colors or even close to the true colors. Yes you may distinguish different colors but the Enchroma's are very close to the true colors.  Working to pass a test is one thing. Having your vision corrected for seeing color in a more normal fashion is another."
ColorBlind,35zcl5,rlneub,2,Fri May 15 17:06:15 2015 UTC,"The problem is, they are not the true colors or even close to the true colors. Yes you may distinguish different colors but the Enchroma's are very close to the true colors.   You are exactly right, and that's one of the main problems with the Oxy-Iso glasses. You are not supposed to wear them while you are driving (I wouldn't anyway) because they almost completely block out some types of green light. Stoplights appear very dim when green, and there are some lights on my dashboard that completely disappear with the glasses on.  I can wear the EnChromas while driving, and while they are not as technically effective they are a lot more usable. The Oxy-Isos are better for things where true color doesn't matter, like telling wires apart from each other, decoding confusing charts, reading radar weather maps, etc."

ColorBlind,35ycks,ihaverocketlegs,7,Thu May 14 19:30:03 2015 UTC,"My theory is that colorblind people don't rely on color to identify objects (duh) and subconsciously come up with other methods to identify objects. My guess is shape, texture, and reflectivity. Because camouflage should have environment colors (and be effective) if you're colorblind or not, it has to be some other method to detect camouflage. If I had to guess, shape and reflectivity (i.e., clothing has different reflective properties than leaves) play a huge role in it. So in your case, you detected the box's shape and the reflectivity of the tape instead of relying on color.   Pretty cool, actually. I kind of want to see a scientific study on it."

Some colors do stand out now but its not a $400 WOW there is color now type reaction.  Here is a good example of what I see without the glasses and with. https://www.reddit.com/r/ColorBlind/comments/3579ey/what_i_see_with_enchroma_glasses/  Copy and past from another post...  The green on the road signs is the biggest change I can see. Normally green road signs just look like a dull washed out green. With the glasses they turn almost bright grass green.  My Prius's instrument panel I thought was white LED's for the MPH but with the glasses is a bright washed out green. definitely a green and not white led.  Some stop lights have a color change to them but not much. Green lights look a little greener. Yellow still looks like an orange and some reds really stand out but still look pretty much the same.  LED's have a more distinguished color to them but I still could not tell you the difference between red,amber,yellow,green LED's unless they were all side by side and then I might be able to tell you the colors.  Still cant tell the difference between some greens and browns, blue and purples.  My brother tried them out and his reaction is the same as mine.  Personally I don't think they are worth the $400 for me and us protan's but I think I will keep them. They are a decent sunglasses. For me I feel they would be worth $50 for what they do."

ColorBlind,35yzqa,Unuhi,1 point,Thu May 14 22:55:36 2015 UTC,"I suspect that from a perceptual (as opposed to sensory) standpoint, the question is meaningless.  If a pair of eyes has no way of distinguishing hues, why should we expect the brain attached to them to have a concept of a hue?  Shades of gray, or blue, or red, mean just shades of light.  As an analogy, consider a camera loaded with black and white film, but with a red filter in front of its lens.  All light recorded on the film will be from the red end of the spectrum, but since the film does not distinguish wavelengths at all, the redness of the light in no way creates a hue on the negative.  Similarly, there is such a thing as infrared film, which is designed to be especially sensitive to long wavelengths, but pictures taken on such film, while showing contrast and detail in different scenes than common b/w film would, still contain no color information."
ColorBlind,35ywkl,holymolym,8,Thu May 14 17:52:51 2015 UTC,"For somebody who is a strong deutan, it truly may be that dramatic. Those conversion programs, in my experience, really just change everything to a severe version of whatever colorblindness it's simulating. Some peoples aren't that bad. If you want to see if it really is that dramatic, try converting a colorful picture of yours to the deutan version on a site, and see how much of a difference he can see.   That being said, don't be devastated. That's the trap I fell into as a color deficient dude when I really started thinking about it. Your husband can still see all the majesty that Norway has to offer, just with a little duller colors. It will still be a special trip. My advice would be not to bring it up on the trip, just let him experience it the way he has experienced everything else his whole life without being made sad."
ColorBlind,35ywkl,ihaverocketlegs,3,Thu May 14 18:27:10 2015 UTC,Definitely solid advice. Bringing it up can ruin the moment of a beautiful scene for him when he remembers it's better than he knows.

I don't get ragged on as much as an adult but I'll still once in awhile get the ""what color is this shirt?""question, and it's tedious at best.  I found this subreddit this morning, after someone sent me a link about the enchroma glasses, and I'm really on the fence with it, because, I have always seen the world this way, and while it would be probably amazing to see it a new way, I'm afraid of what will happen when I take them off. Will I be ok with going back to my normal vision, will I be irritated or maybe even depressed. The whole, don't know what you got till its gone dilemma.

With that said, think of it this way. What if I told you there were actually 12 colors in the common rainbow and not just the 7 that you know (ROYGBIV)? Your first reaction might be sadness or depression, but soon you would realize that hey, you still like rainbows the way you see them, right? It's not like sunsets are suddenly any less beautiful or flowers any less vibrant to you. You only know what you know, and you're happy with that. Things only get weird and depressing when someone else says ""It's so sad that you can't see ____.""  Putting yet another spin on things, your husband has the opportunity to see more colors than he is used to seeing. Pretty cool right? So he can choose between ""normal"" and ""Land of Oz Technicolor"". Not a bad deal. :)  So yeah, like /u/ihaverocketlegs said, just let him experience it the way he's used to. It'll be a great trip.

It looked absurd to me, his skin was greenish and the red on his little toy mower looked the same dull color as the grass! I sent it and the original to him side by side and thought for sure he'd see a difference, but nope. They looked the same to him! I couldn't believe it.   I did cry. He just laughed at me. He's comfortable with it since it's all he's known.  It is just absolutely insane to me. I always thought his vision was pretty much like mine except red and green were a little wonky. So many things make sense now. So many. I finally understand.   I can't wait to order him some glasses and see what he thinks. I hope they work for him."

Everything is very distinguishable from everything else. You will register things as a shape and a color as opposed to just a shape. Also, you're going to notice subtle color differences. The other week I was helping my friend hoist his blackhawks flag, and realized that I'd never noticed the blue detail inside the yellow feather in the logo. In fact, I'd never noticed that there were different color details in any of the other feathers either. I could definitely see those colors before, but they never registered as anything more than a shape in my mind. You get a lot of that.

ColorBlind,35rfuq,onceamennonite,2,Wed May 13 11:05:49 2015 UTC,"What are the old Cx glasses?  I got mine in the fall when they were just called ""Cx"" without a number, IIRC."
ColorBlind,35rfuq,fabos,2,Wed May 13 21:05:40 2015 UTC,"The old ones are most similar to the Cx-14, which transmits 14% of visible light."
ColorBlind,35rfuq,EnChroma,3,Wed May 13 21:25:11 2015 UTC,Same here. Ordered on 4/18.
ColorBlind,35rfuq,LinleyMike,3,Tue May 12 23:05:04 2015 UTC,"I've noticed almost all the lens/frame combos are listed as on ""back order (3-4 weeks)"" or just plain ""out of stock"".  Mine were ""in stock"" when I ordered. Since the indoor lenses are relatively new, I suspect they produced a bunch of them ahead of time and shipped them out as ordered, but that's all speculation on my part.  I hope you get your order soon."
ColorBlind,35rfuq,Swordfish08,5,Tue May 12 23:18:01 2015 UTC,So you're telling me that this will help me figure out what is going on when the Flyers play the Predators?
ColorBlind,35rfuq,Witherkay,3,Wed May 13 02:25:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but unfortunately we'll have to until next season."
ColorBlind,35rfuq,GoddamnCommunist,3,Wed May 13 02:38:48 2015 UTC,The real question is - do you think they accurately portray non-colourblind vision?
ColorBlind,35rfuq,Twas_Inevitable,11,Tue May 12 22:39:01 2015 UTC,"I think that's impossible to know for sure. I have no idea what a normal vision person sees. What I do know is that some colors look more like themselves than they ever have, if that makes any sense.  Red, for example, looks more red than I have ever seen in my life. Without the glasses it looks washed out almost, like it was sitting outside and was slightly bleached by the sun, or has a slight orange tint to it or something. With the glasses, it's just so red. I don't know how to describe it in words."
ColorBlind,35rfuq,stubborn_Analyst,2,Tue May 12 22:52:09 2015 UTC,"Would you say that, with the glasses, red still appears to be a very similar color to green (pardon my relative lack of knowledge of deutan if that statement is wrong), but simply more vibrant? Or would you say it is now a completely different color from green? Is it closer to green or further away? Because to me, as a non-deutan, they are strikingly different colors."
ColorBlind,35rfuq,Twas_Inevitable,4,Wed May 13 04:00:58 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to describe. They were always different colors in most situations, if one person was wearing a red shirt and another person was wearing a green shirt, I could easily tell one was red and the other green.  But if there was a red flower on a shrub, I might not even notice it and assume the whole shrub was green. It just kind of blends in.  The glasses do help to separate them more. There's definitely no mistaking red for any other color, it's just so different now. I suppose the true test will be in the fall when the red leaves appear on the green trees. I've only had the glasses for about 36 hours, I suspect I'll notice more differences as situations present themselves."
ColorBlind,35rfuq,stubborn_Analyst,3,Wed May 13 05:55:19 2015 UTC,Mind if I ask what frame you got? Last time I looked they only offered the aviator style and I thought that looked kind of dumb for indoor glasses. Now I'm starting to see a couple other on there and just wondering what works best for you.
ColorBlind,35rfuq,Pantsofthemister,2,Wed May 13 06:06:25 2015 UTC,"I know you didn't ask me, but...  I don't wear glasses (non prescription) so I decided to send in custom frames for the indoor lenses.  It was more convenient to take my time trying on a bunch of different kinds at a local optometrist office. They provided a lot of help understanding what sizes to get and ""fashion"" styles to avoid in the long run, plus I was able to use my HSA to pay for the frames! If I don't count my HSA contributions, which are so minimal every month, I ended up paying less by doing the custom frame option and I'm 100% sure I like the frames.  Also, I'm hoping that I won't have to wait as long since I provided the frames. EnChroma received my frames, passed inspection, and sent to lab on April 29th so I'm right at the 2 week mark, just waiting for an email to say they are done."
ColorBlind,35rfuq,FootieFromAFar,2,Wed May 13 15:33:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you for taking the time to answer. This was exactly the kind of response I was looking for. My biggest concern is spending the time/money on custom frames, sending them in, getting approved, sending the glasses back, just to find out they don't work on me. I see that you are Protanomaly also. When I take their online test I get between 30-50% chance of it working.   I hadn't thought about insurance covering frames since I don't have a prescription. I will definitely look into that now though."
ColorBlind,35rfuq,paulocesar1109,2,Wed May 13 17:30:17 2015 UTC,"I have the exact same concern about the indoor not working for protan. But I have a plan for that!  A little back story.. I have the Cx-14, the full outdoor, on their Elite frame. I didn't experience the huge WOW factor, but it definitely had great impact on street lights, grass, the sky and overall was worth it! The downside is that it is 50/50 cloudy or already getting dark by the time I'm done working so I wish I had went with the Cx-25, but they didn't have it available at the time. They announced the lighter outdoor and the indoor at the same time a few days after my order. Plus I thought I read that they said the Cx-25 is having the best results for outdoors.  This is my plan.. I really want the indoor ones to work! It'd be ideal because I work on a computer all day and I love Netflix and PS4 out of work. I know they say they don't recommend for protan on their site, but they also said some protans say they work great. >_< convenient... SO.. I choose the option to do custom frames on the indoor Cx-65 with a frame that could also work well for the outdoor Cx-25. Ray-Ban 5268 5119. If the indoor ones don't work then I will send them in to exchange for the Cx-25. For the record I REALLY REALLY WANT THEM TO WORK! I certainly don't want to waste any of their time/money if they don't work, but it's the best route to take since I am also investing money (frames & double shipping costs) and a lot of time waiting in anticipation too.  The good news, is their return policy is great and my feedback will help them and others in the long run. Plus if they do work, I will buy another frame and order the Cx-25 for outdoor! :) And I'll give the Cx-14 to my father as he is an active runner and those Elite frames would work the best for him. So regardless they will be getting another sale from me. I'll do a big review of all three lenses and my experiences in the next few months."
ColorBlind,35rfuq,Trent_Boyett,1 point,Wed May 13 18:11:20 2015 UTC,I am really looking forward to your review. I've been super on the fence about buying them since I'm on my computer for the majority of the time. But then indoor glasses! Except it's not for Protanomaly. I might try what you're doing just to see if it'll magically work for me.

ColorBlind,35rfuq,stubborn_Analyst,2,Thu May 14 20:51:38 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for this! I've been trying to find more info on the 65s as they seem the most likely to be used on a daily basis.  How would you rate their effectiveness in outdoor situations and brightly lit rooms? Is there still a good difference compared to when you aren't wearing them / before you had them?
ColorBlind,35rfuq,JewFroMonk,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:11:13 2015 UTC,"They work great outside. Things will just catch your eye and you'll end up staring at them for a while. They don't change every color you see but when you see new colors there's no mistaking them. I recently made a trip to the garden store (a must do when you get them), there are some unbelievable colors of flowers."

ColorBlind,35pm5v,TheTVEditor,3,Tue May 12 13:58:05 2015 UTC,"I'm looking forward to this movie! I've heard some cool things about it, plus they're filming in my state. The trailers I've seen are very powerful to me as they really hit home about career choices. I'm interested what normal color vision people think about it.. too dramatized to be true?  I know a couple people had complained about the name being a bit misleading and focusing on colorblind meaning black and white vision, but as long as they explain the differences in types, clearly squash the stereotypes and explain that we don't all have Monochromacy, it should be fine. If anything, it will draw more attention to get people to watch the film since most view it as a true oddity. Hopefully people will be able to walk away with a better understanding of CVD and that may cause them to correct others if they hear the stereotype. That may be a long shot, but progress is done one step at a time."
ColorBlind,35pm5v,stubborn_Analyst,1 point,Tue May 12 16:41:12 2015 UTC,Iʻm looking forward to the movie too.  - and to have a fully audio described version of it too ;)   (And closed captions and all the other accessibility options)
ColorBlind,35pczk,CaptGarfield,2,Tue May 12 12:33:21 2015 UTC,"Sweet~! Thanks for the pic.  I think it's the only photo of enchroma's indoor version i've seen in the 'wild'. and they seem to have a weird shade of tint in them.  How long did it take to get yours? i've ordered mine (medium sunglasses) last week, it's now a nail bitting wait. plus, i have an rx prescription, i'm guessing that won't make it arrive any faster.."
ColorBlind,35pczk,tisshin,1 point,Sat May 23 13:04:24 2015 UTC,"It took about a week to get mine. They were in stock when I ordered. If anyone asks me in the future, my recommendation will be to get sunglasses unless you already wear prescription glasses. The indoor ones are nice, but if you don't already wear glasses regularly, I think sunglasses will be more useful. I almost exclusively wear them with the clip-ons now. I think I may order the medium sunglasses in the future. Let me know how the work for brightness when you get them. I may even just get medium lenses put into the clip-on frame."
ColorBlind,35pczk,linethmm93,1 point,Sat May 23 13:19:54 2015 UTC,"I am most definitely going to go for the medium. Thank you so much for your review on the product! I actually called Enchroma yesterday and they explained how it is best to use both indoor and outdoor together. Anyways, did you get medium or large for the explorers and what size of glasses do you usually use? I have a really narrow face (53-18-135), and it seems that most glasses don't go below 56 for the first number. I am worried they might be too big."

I think that there is such a huge scale of colorblind intensity and different types of colorblindness that you are going to find many people who all see the same thing differently."
ColorBlind,35iiae,Twas_Inevitable,7,Sun May 10 20:58:58 2015 UTC,"That's how I would describe it. The green light looks white. The yellow light looks like a lighter version of the red light, and the red light looks like a darker version of the yellow light.  I can usually easily distinguish between the ""green"" light and the others(although not distinguish from the lamp post lights along the side of the road) and can usually tell a very slight difference between a single traffic light's red and yellow, but I can't tell the difference between one light's yellow and another light's red.  Whenever approaching a light from far enough away that I can't tell whether the middle or the top light is lit up I just approach ""with caution"", thinking that it's much more likely to be red than yellow, and generally this strategy means that it's not usually easy for cars to tell that I have difficulty with colors.  One problem I do have is flashing red versus flashing yellow. Oh dear GOD do I hate flashing red versus flashing yellow."
ColorBlind,35iiae,theedgeofoblivious,2,Sun May 10 21:42:10 2015 UTC,"To me the yellow light is definitely very different than red, but I'd put it closer to orangish yellow than anything. I've leaned recently that I should call this ""gold"" I think."
ColorBlind,35iiae,ihaverocketlegs,8,Mon May 11 00:49:53 2015 UTC,"It depends on which countries you are in. Some countries change their colors slightly to help the colorblind. If I am not mistaken they add a bit of blue to the green light to make it more noticeable, as most colorblind people can see blue. People who see color barely see the difference but for the colorblind it is a godsend. Also, some countries put lights sideways sometimes, in which case it is not always as easy as ""the top light means stop, the bottom one means go"""

Good job making a fun test /u/Colblindor!   Almost all other tests say I am moderate to strong Protan.

At least results look pretty close to each other. - Personally I think this test could really differentiate between deutan and protan (the results look extremely promising). But has to be validated, of cousre.  I thought about an introtext. Showing up only the first time. Should be short and ""understandable"". Couldn't find one, therefore I just let it be. - If you have a good one, I'll put it up in the next release."

ColorBlind,3579ey,tross13,2,Thu May 14 05:32:56 2015 UTC,"Non-color blind person here. The first sign is ""road sign green"" to put it any other way. It's a darker green that's got a very tiny tinge of blue in it.  The second sign is what I would describe as ""grass green"". It has more yellow in it and is similar to the color of slightly dry grass.  Either way, they're extremely similar, and without being able to compare them, if someone mispainted one color when it was meant to be the other I probably wouldn't notice unless I stared at it a bit."

I'm guessing there's differently optimized glasses for different CVD's but why doesn't it work as well for protan as it does for deutan?
ColorBlind,350ttz,EnChroma,2,Thu May 7 01:51:59 2015 UTC,"Its hard to say without knowing your case, and we do get a lot of strong protans that they work for and really love them.  The truth is that some strong protans can be really, really color blind. Almost to the level of dichromacy. If you look at the discrimination ellipse of the color gamut area for a strong protan it can be very small compared with a strong deutan."

I'm not an expert at drawing, but it's quite possible that your inability to see colors makes your use of shades more intricate. I've googled images of drawn skulls and none play with shades the way you do. So it might be a plus for you there!"

I hope that when they start doing clinical trials for the cure in the next few years, you do what you can to make yourself known as a candidate.

ColorBlind,350rr7,Cike176,3,Wed May 6 18:11:47 2015 UTC,Achromatopsia is the complete lack of colour vision. I only draw in B&W for that reason (unless I actually picked up a pencil crayon).

ColorBlind,34vvgg,kent_eh,2,Wed May 6 15:22:27 2015 UTC,"haha weird. Here orange isn't a main party colour and it's unlikely to be one because it's considered to be linked to the ongoing Protestant / Catholic fight in Ireland and to a lesser extent in Scotland. It's also therefore linked to the continuing issue of Northern Ireland (in that Protestants tend to want NI to remain a part of the UK, as it is at the moment, and the Catholics tend to want it to be part of the rest of the Republic of Ireland. This is weird for the UK since outside of Northern Ireland, religion and politics tend to be a lot less tied than they are in the US.) Bright orange can be a controversial colour to wear here (parts of Scotland - due to inheriting part of the whole disagreement from Ireland due to the number of Irish people living here), as it's strongly linked to The Orange Order.   Here Red is Labour who used to be very left-wing but in 1997 became more ""moderate"" (to use american terms, we'd say centrist) when Tony Blair took leadership and made ""New Labour"". This was possibly the start of what has now lead to our latest General Election (which is tomorrow) looking like a near wipe-out for Labour in Scotland, in favour of the Scottish National party. We're a lot more left-wing here than England, so it makes sense. Sadly our local Labour party haven't been brave enough to tear themselves away from English Labour and the current leader of Scottish Labour (Jim Murphy) is certainly not a Socialist.  Green is primarily the Green party but also a different Green is Plaid Cymru (That's ""the Party of Wales"" in welsh) who only stand in Wales, obviously.  Yellow is the Liberal Democrats (central and at one time were even left of Labour because Labour got so right-wing)  Yellow (again slightly different one) is also Scottish National Party who are, like PC, more left-wing and only stand in their named area.  Blue is Conservative (tory). I am assuming they're pretty much the same as yours.  Purple and gold is the UK Independence Party. Guess what they want to achieve? They are the most right-wing party to hold seats in the UK Parliament. This is also a bad colour choice as Purple is normally the colour for people who want to be political without declaring support for a party.  and that about wraps it up for Britain. Northern Ireland has a completely different political party set-up and so in elections they're treated almost as a separate game entirely. I don't know a lot about the politics there and sadly because its such a small area neither do most people in Britain. I very much see the point of the nationalists there in that it should be a part of the Irish Republic. It's so unlike the rest of Britain.  I have no idea why I wrote all that but I hope you enjoyed reading it."

Tracing its origins back to the Democratic-Republican Party, the modern Democratic Party was founded around 1828, making it the oldest political party in the world that is still in existence.  There have been 15 Democratic presidents, the first being Andrew Jackson, who served from 1829 to 1837; the most recent is the current president, Barack Obama, who has served since 2009.  Since the 1930s the party has promoted a center-left, social-liberal platform,  supporting a mixed economy and social justice.  The party's philosophy of modern American liberalism advocates social and economic equality, along with the welfare state.  It pursues a mixed economy by providing government intervention and regulation in the economy.  These interventions, such as universal health care, labor unions, social programs, equal opportunity, consumer protection, and environmental protection, form the party's economic policy basis.

For me, cooking with colorblindness is something I do where I tend to forget about my CVD. I primarily just cook with science rather than intuition or experience. I am more in tune with timers for things and what temperature foods should be at. Simple tricks to tell if pastries are done. Golden brown is a somewhat universal term, though.   However, I could understand how being an actual chef and colorblind might be difficult."

ColorBlind,34r1d0,EnChroma,1 point,Mon May 4 18:55:24 2015 UTC,"requires honest answers of what you see.   Is it okay to guess?? I feel like I shouldn't guess if I can't see the whole thing, but sometimes I do. If the answer is 7, but I really can only make out the vertical arm part, /, should I hit ""I'm not sure"" or ""7"". It's obviously the only number it could be, even though I can't see the flag part of the 7.  Like most people with CVD, I rely heavily on context and by knowing what other possibilities are available. If the test is only 0-9 or nothing and the numbers are always the same size covering the same area, it's not hard to guess some of them even if I can't see the whole number. I know a straight vertical line of different shaded dots in the middle has to be 1, whether or not I can see the whole thing.  The first test EnChroma had was much easier for me than this new one. (I still failed both tests as mild or moderate Protan most of the time. Sometimes I'd even get mild Deutan, but I question it as I feel like I can guess a lot.) On the old one, if I saw a sharp corner in the dots near the corner of the test then I could guess it's a square since there's really no other choice that would match that size and location.   TLDR: Would the test get even more accurate if it had both a variety of shapes and 0-9 as possible answers? Also, why don't you change the location and actual size of the object? Hell, if you want me to really be sure what I can see and that I don't just guess the only option, throw in a few letters like S, P, R, B, L, F, C, X!"

The test attempting to triangulate your overall discrimination elipse within the Gamut area in as few steps as possible. If a single question is a ""wobbler"" and could go either way / you can only see part you are still defining that outer edge with valuable information. It will lead to a later question to refine it further which you should be able to see better or not at all.  If you just cant see it and you make a random guess and get it right you throw the whole thing off; creating an island where you can make a distinction in an area your other answers say you cannot. If you can see it well enough to work it out it is not this bad.  It is one of those ""you are only cheating yourself"" things to guess. But always saying ""nothing"" just because one little bit of it is not visible to you does not aid the precision of the result either."
ColorBlind,34r1d0,EnChroma,1 point,Wed May 6 18:19:59 2015 UTC,"Good link, thank you for that! And just to clarify when I say guess, I don't mean choose a number at random when I see nothing at all. I mean a more educated guess when I can see unique characteristics that would only fit with 1 possible answer (like the vertical line on a 7 or the downward open slope of a 9).  That makes sense to use a few steps as possible. I have one more question/suggestion that may be useful in the future. (Or not, hell I'm no expert!)  For the program to more accurately determine the result's severity: Would it be helpful if each question had 1 answer plus a secondary option? Let me explain what I mean: If the answer is 7, but I only see the vertical line. I would normally select 7 as the answer, but before it goes to the next question, I should be asked to scale how visible the answer appeared (like an option of ""Very Clear"", ""Partly Clear"", or ""Barely Clear"". This wouldn't apply if I select ""Nothing"" as the answer). Would that then allow the program to more easily conclude the severity of the colorblindness?  Anyway, just a thought! Thanks again!"
ColorBlind,34r1d0,stubborn_Analyst,2,Wed May 6 20:19:23 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are saying, but a secondary option would violate the forced choice experimental design.

The thing is though, if you don't have any problems, they all are immediately distinct characters. The difference between the ones where you can't see it at all and the ones where you can kinda see it just determine how bad your problem is.

If each detector is independent of the others, simple exponentiation gives a total number of colours discernible by an average human as their product, or about 1 million;  nevertheless, other researchers have put the number at upwards of 2.3 million.  Exponentiation suggests that a dichromat (such as a human with red-green color blindness) would be able to distinguish about 10,000 different colours,  but no such calculation has been verified by psychophysical testing.

Commonly, their placement is mandated by international conventions or civil authorities. Contrary to the name, these lights are not used for navigating. They indicate the craft's relative position, and are thus, often called ""Position lights"".  Navigation lighting systems include:   Right-of-way lights — A red light is mounted on the left or port side of the craft and a green on the right or starboard side. In a situation where the paths of two watercraft or aircraft cross, these lights help each crew determine the other craft's direction and who has right-of-way. When two craft have crossing paths, each sees a red or green running light. The one on the port side of the other, which must yield right of way, sees red, while the one on the starboard side of the other, which has right of way, sees green. Strobe lights — On aircraft primarily, strobe lights flash a high-intensity burst of white light, to help other pilots recognize the aircraft's position in low-visibility conditions.

They won't make you see any colors you couldn't see before, though it feels like that. They actually block out wavelengths of light between certain colors. For most CVD people, your brain can't decide what color something is because of too much information so your brain has to guess, these glasses simply help narrow out the confusing information coming in so your brain can make a better decision.  BTW, I agree about the cake too but if it weren't bright distinct colors and more varied hues then I'd have trouble. You should try a color vision test and see what it says."

I can't explain any other reason many road signs and flowers only appear in the corrected color.  Try as I might I can't see lilacs as the light blue they have been for fifty years.

Vintage outfits and styles rule   I used to dress pretty oddly inchigh school. I went to a sighted, art high school. So white jeans, bold-colored long silk shirts, and a white wifebeater over it. Being 17, skinny, and wearing cokebottle glasses kind of helped make it work.  Now instead I don't wear any eye makeup.  The secret is in the details. Get just enough tension in the details, and go with a bold attitude.  Use attention to detail in everything after that.

Always buy black belts and black dress shoes, they always match and go with anything. Take a color normal with you when you shop for pricey business attire.

It seems that it would be a great way to utilize the glasses if you do the custom frame option and have the Cx65 on the main frame with Cx25 on the clip-on. It ends up giving you the effect of the Cx-14, but without having to constantly switch glasses!  Here's the link to that answer from EnChroma"

Do you know how a pair of Cx-65 glasses with a 'regular' (i.e. not enchroma corrective lenses) sunglasses lens clip on would work in bright daylight?

ColorBlind,349pm2,EnChroma,2,Wed Apr 29 16:17:43 2015 UTC,If you try this get a neutral grey lens for the clip on. That will cut the light level without skewing the spectrum. Might cut the effectiveness of the Cx-65 too much to be worthwhile but we have never really experimented with it.  I would just buy the Cx-65 first and see what works for you.

I think that I'll stick to deciding whether I want glasses for outdoors use, or for indoors use, and select my lenses on that basis.    Are the Cx-14's recommended for bright sun conditions because they'll actually work better to help with color distinction than the Cx-25's, or are they recommended because they offer superior protection for your eyes?"
ColorBlind,349pm2,stubborn_Analyst,2,Wed Apr 29 20:06:42 2015 UTC,"They are a darker sunglass so they are more comfortable in bright, bright sun. The thinking right now is that the Cx-25 has a slightly better color enhancement effect."

ColorBlind,341w5q,kenoh,3,Mon Apr 27 17:34:24 2015 UTC,I understand your pain with LEDS. I use to work with servers in the enterprise. I built a small ckt board  with different off the shelf colored LEDS using a 9 volt battery just to test Colorview lenses. Those lenses did not help with LEDS. I have the outdoor Enchroma  lenses but they seem greatly diminish LED brilliance not sure why. You can return Enchroma if you are not satisfied.
ColorBlind,341w5q,colorblindme,3,Mon Apr 27 20:41:32 2015 UTC,they seem greatly diminish LED brilliance not sure why.   Well they are sunglasses.
ColorBlind,341w5q,MechanicalYeti,2,Mon Apr 27 22:12:55 2015 UTC,"Right, I was looking into the new indoor variety. I don't much care about seeing the rainbow. I just want to be able to do my job."
ColorBlind,341w5q,EnChroma,3,Tue Apr 28 11:00:12 2015 UTC,"We have several deutans who use the Cx-65 on the job in server hubs and they report they can see the status lights. It was one of the primary use cases for making the product- the sunglasses were generally too dark for that purpose, even the Cx-25s."
ColorBlind,341w5q,colorblindme,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:10:57 2015 UTC,I realize they are intended for outdoor use as sunglasses however I have worn them indoors with some success. My guess is LEDs give off light in the frequency spectrum that Enchroma is filtering out.

ColorBlind,33yay9,GoddamnCommunist,9,Sun Apr 26 20:12:05 2015 UTC,"I had to give up, the ""How many of each colour box?"" questions were too confusing and time consuming."
ColorBlind,33yay9,chadjj,2,Sun Apr 26 20:24:26 2015 UTC,"I gave up on the same part.  Number 8, to me, looks like two blue boxes, a bright yellow box, and a box that could be canary yellow, tan, or possibly green.  Based on the context of the suggestions, I am guessing that it's green.  I think there is too much suggestion in the test, by way of the multiple choice.  On the first grid, initially I saw just a yellow box with a white grid.  However, after reading the choices, I began to see a faint star behind the grid.  I would have never seen it if I wasn't told it was there."
ColorBlind,33yay9,LinleyMike,2,Mon Apr 27 13:13:34 2015 UTC,"I think that's alright though. Because you are ""seeing"" it still, even if it's suggested. I know that we as colorblind people percieve things a little differently, relying more on past experience and context to determine colors, but I saw ambiguous shapes behind the grid at first, then when I read the choices, I immediately figured out which one it was every time."

ColorBlind,33yay9,greyskael,3,Mon Apr 27 08:59:31 2015 UTC,"Did not think the test was well made, two things i would change   Box questions should be typed in or a list of colours to choose from should be provided and you pick how many of each appear. Grid questions should have more choices. I was unsure on several of them but since the choices was either between W or B (or something else of similar contrast) the choice became obvious and the question becomes irrelevant to the diagnose.   I got around 30% for both protans, telling me nothing i didnt know."
ColorBlind,33yay9,fite_me_fgt,2,Sun Apr 26 21:20:04 2015 UTC,"I wasn't sure myself how to answer.

ColorBlind,33yay9,fite_me_fgt,2,Sun Apr 26 22:14:40 2015 UTC,"Assuming you meant to say site, I like EnChroma's test. It's nothing new though, randomly generated ishiharas with numbers.  Assuming side, whatever your heart desires, man."

ColorBlind,33yay9,ihaverocketlegs,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:12:36 2015 UTC,The box test was definitely stupid.  Some of them had too few boxes to choose from or colors that were too far away from what people would choose even if they had deficiency.

ColorBlind,33yay9,stubborn_Analyst,3,Mon Apr 27 11:47:35 2015 UTC,"I only got two wrong, so this probably isn't a super accurate test."

ColorBlind,33yay9,mild_anarchist,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:10:42 2015 UTC,Those boxes were really confusing at first.   I thought they were trying to have some order and I was trying to count left to right or top to bottom.  Figured it out eventually.

ColorBlind,33q44x,RedL45,5,Fri Apr 24 16:11:51 2015 UTC,My brother has both. He says that the 65 works for outside but not to the same degree as the 14. With the 14 the colors are richer but also darker which I can understand as they are like sunglasses. The 65 helps with red and green on the computer (he  can differentiate between most red and green fonts  whereas before he could not at all) as he went from strong deutron to mild and still cannot pass the ishihara test.  When days are cloudy then the indoor works better than the outdoor as the outdoor is too dark.  After telling a friend about his experience he decided to try the 25s as it seems like a good compromise.
ColorBlind,33q44x,rlneub,4,Mon Apr 27 14:20:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting! Are the 65s light enough that he can wear them around the house a-okay, or is he tethered to the chair? Are the lenses super light, or is the tinting still on the eye-hiding end?  I'm a cashier and barista in a coffee shop, and am seriously considering getting some cx65 Gammas to wear all day, in the fashion of normal glasses. Is this something achievable, or is it a pipe dream? Are the glasses light enough so as to not be rude when worn by a cashier?  Thanks. Hope I made some sense."
ColorBlind,33q44x,SwampGentleman,5,Mon Apr 27 18:20:21 2015 UTC,"He wears them all over the house. The tinting is a very light blue. For what you are looking for this is not a pipe dream.  Also, it took over 2 weeks for the 14s to come and he wore the 65s inside and out and was pleased as he saw more green and reds and purple and pink (yes purple exists and the 65s did show them and pink is now one of his favorite colors). When the 14s came he now uses each for their designed purpose and is pleased with the results.  The 65s do not look bad indoors at all. You can see the eyes clearly through the lens. Outside they work but not to the same degree as the 14s. The 14s are definitely better for bright light and colors seem to pop even more, but he was pleased with the 65s until he got the 14s.  The style of frame will make a bigger statement than the tint on the glasses."

I found it takes several weeks for the brain to process the new signals you are getting from your retinas. It's approaching six months and I'm still seeing colors I hadn't seen before.    The lilacs are blooming. I can report that they aren't light blue as I always thought. They're purple.  Red buds aren't a dark blue-purple, they are a bright pink-purple.  In fact virtually nothing blooming is actually blue. Spring is composed of a wide variety of pinks and purples. That and some profoundly green grass."
ColorBlind,33nvho,NeedMoarGuitars,2,Sat Apr 25 03:10:09 2015 UTC,"I'll try to answer as much as I can.   Certain lighted things become very green to me with these on, but they're very specific things. Namely, only electronic LED billboards change colors to a really weird green. It's gotta be something with the kind of light it puts out, it doesn't happen with TVs or computers. Maybe /u/EnChroma can assist with this one.   It was difficult for me to distinguish colors at first just because I was so not used to seeing the ones I was, but with time you should pick it up. Purples really get me, but some blues looked purple almost for a while that first day. I think your eyes just gotta make sense of it all. It all settles after some regular use, and it's great.   Yellow road signs: some are a ""marigold"" color to me now, which is a golden yellow I'd never really seen well before. I thought they were orange too for a bit. But also, maybe you got crap signs.   Yep. All lights on the traffic stops pop for me now. Never happened before.   This question may be subjective. Nacho Doritos are almost entirely orange to me. Spicy Nacho are more red. Haven't looked at either with the glasses on.   I'm a mild protan. I've been asking my color normal friends for weeks now what color stuff is. It's a good frame of reference, I suggest it."
ColorBlind,33nvho,ihaverocketlegs,2,Fri Apr 24 04:46:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess marigold would be the right color to compare them to when the glasses on. One thing I still cant make out too well is if I see a ""yellow"" car if its really yellow or is it just a bright neon green. I always hated neon colors. Confuses the hell out of me. I actually like yellow cars. Just don't see that many of them.  The doritos are a good bright orange all most in the yellow area to me without the glasses but with them on they turn a really deep orange all most reddish. Thats the only real thing thats made a big pop in color to me so far. I just did not know if they were really that orange or not."
ColorBlind,33nvho,rlneub,1 point,Fri Apr 24 11:35:45 2015 UTC,The dash lights are green and bluegreens. Yellow signs are more of a yellow orange color. Without a picture of your car I cannot tell you about your reds.
ColorBlind,33nvho,rlneub,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:36:35 2015 UTC,Here is a picture of the inside of my car. http://stuff.jaygroh.com/priuschat/wosc2.jpg  This was taken when everything was new. Now the seat covers have faded in spots to a pink color. I really need to get them redyed. Plus my camera does make the red pop a little more. Taken with a Sony F828 camera. I think I used the real color mode or what ever it was called when taking that picture. Even with the glasses on the reds dont look as good as in this picture.  The redish color I see when putting on the glasses looks like putting a red filter over the lens of the camera if that makes sense.
ColorBlind,33nvho,rlneub,1 point,Fri Apr 24 11:26:50 2015 UTC,Your car is very red. I have never had a red car as most are not nice to me but I think I could get used to your car as it pops.
ColorBlind,33nvho,EnChroma,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:46:05 2015 UTC,The filter effect may be because the red is reflecting off of the fabric. Your headliner looks grey but with overtones of red most likely from the seats.  Also some of the black has overtones of red but it is harder to see as black is so dark.
ColorBlind,33ock2,Balfezor,4,Fri Apr 24 04:04:06 2015 UTC,"Hey friend! First off, if you search ""EnChroma"" or ""review"" in the search bar, you'll get a plethora of detailed reviews from people who have bought and used the product. I'm one of the ones who wrote one. They made a stunning difference for me, and if you go to my ""submitted"" in my history you can read the review.   Second. What kind of color deficient are you? They only work for some kinds, and the ones they do work with vary in effect. If you go take the EnChroma test linked on the sidebar, it'll tell you what kind you have. I'm on mobile so I can't see if you're flaired up yet, but lemme know when you take the test.   Third. Their return policy rules. You have thirty day from ship date to return the glasses for a full refund. So if you don't think they're worth the money, you just send em right back.  Exit: I went on my darn computer to see if you were flaired up. You are! Protanomaly, same as me. So if that's what you have, they'll probably make a difference for you. But make sure you've got protanomaly and not protanopia. The latter can't be helped with the glasses."
ColorBlind,33ock2,ihaverocketlegs,1 point,Fri Apr 24 04:34:47 2015 UTC,"Protanomalous here as well.  The Enchromas glasses don't work nearly as well for us.  I  have a pair and they do work, but not with the same dramatic results others report. Probably similar color bump that normal sighted people would experience.    Enchromas seem to work better for deutans."
ColorBlind,33js5g,Fuzzyphilosopher,4,Thu Apr 23 02:12:46 2015 UTC,"As far as making anything more CD-accessible, making sure that people are comfortable in approaching your staff for help, even if they're asking something like 'What color is this?' without fearing ridicule.  Software can be up in the air whether it will work or not on any one of your monitors, as the settings can skew the results.  I've found that the best help I can get in a situation where colors cannot be avoided is, simply put, another person."
ColorBlind,33js5g,reyinpoetic,1 point,Thu Apr 23 07:47:23 2015 UTC,"It's a problem in that there is so little awareness of colorblindness. I was friends with a guy for years growing up, like a decade,  before I learned he was red-green colorblind."

ColorBlind,33js5g,B_adl_y,6,Mon Apr 27 09:09:50 2015 UTC,Not sure if this helps exactly but I like when something that is color coded also includes shapes and or different patters to assist in differentiating between choices. This way color is not the only difference to reference.

If they didn't work, then hell, I could still see a lot of color. I still wasn't born fully blind, I had every reason to be happy and appreciate what my life did have. Of course, I was relieved when mine worked, but I also took solace in the idea that we're just a few years from a cure for this. If they didn't work, my life certainly be any worse, and I wouldn't have to wait too much longer for my next chance. I wish you the best of luck."

I got them last week, ordered the Cx-65 indoor lens, and sadly they didn't work for me. Also had my brother and two coworkers try them out and none of us saw any notable change.

ColorBlind,33hc60,fite_me_fgt,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:51:58 2015 UTC,I can't say. I haven't tried the other types so I don't know if they would work any better. I just got the 65s since I have a design job and spend a good part of my day staring at a computer. The worst thing that can happen is that you're out the money it costs to ship them back if they don't work. To me it was worth the gamble.

I'm a little worried about his teachers giving him a hard time when he wears them in school.  Fortunately they're prescription, so I think we'll be OK.  I know I was anxious that they wouldn't work or that we would be disappointed with them, especially since there wasn't as much optimism towards the indoor lenses and protans from Enchroma, but I'm glad we tried them, and I just might need to get him the outdoor lenses too."

ColorBlind,33gp3q,SiON42X,2,Wed Apr 22 12:09:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it is true that EnChroma is ""generally not covered by insurance,"" it is more nuanced than that. It is all about figuring out what aspect of the eyewear your plan covers and making sure you get that. For prescription orders it will be covered like any other sunglass, so there is a frame and Rx allotment.  In addition to this, the ""good"" insurers have a specialty lens code where if an OD recommends a particular lens for you for a medical condition you get a subsidy. I.e., have macular degeneration and need really strong protective sun lenses? Covered, to some extent, no matter if it is Rx or not. Our lenses are covered the same way if you get an OD to make the recommendation, either your doctor or one of our retailers.  The ""bad"" insurers, and we are only talking one or two of them here, recently terminated that aspect of their plans when they bought their own lens labs- few in number but they are by far the biggest ones in the U.S. so it affects a lot of people. Not OP apparently, so I am interested to see how this turns out for him.  What we really need is a reimbursement code for the lens, and we are agitating for it. This is really something that the community here in /r/colorblind could actually accomplish if we worked at it together- vision insurance is incredibly lucrative and the #2-5 groups are looking for any edge against VSP. CVD affects a small percentage of people, so their out of pocket costs would be negligible amortized over the entire plan and they would have the kind of differentiation they are grasping for. VSP ought to want it for the same reason, lock the rest out and use market dominance to solidify their position.  Hope this helps."

This is a weird one. The first weekend I wore these I was at a rooftop bar, and I saw an Italian flag on the wall, which was odd for an Irish pub. I told my girlfriend that, and she tells me no, that's the Irish flag. Maybe I had never seen orange ""correctly"" before, but this (the third stripe) was a fiery red to me, which after I took a good look at it, appeared to be a red-orange. Certain oranges still do that, but I'm now able to tell that they're orange, those colors I would have previously called red. The same thing happened with certain shades of red turning pinkish, but I'm assuming that's what they truly are, a more pinkish red that I didn't really know existed, because I'm pretty sure I didn't ever see these colors before. They're hard to grasp at first. This is a tough one to answer, because depending on your CVD, you're not gonna know what things around you are truly vibrant until you put these these glasses on. For me, some people's boring, grey shirts become a crazy hot pink, and a lilac type color becomes full on electric purple. That said, I've never been able to distinguish colors from one another better than with these on. I can see gradients in the lawns of houses around me, the different shades of one apple, and different leaves so much more than before. Everything has a very definite limit and edge.  I have the 14's. I don't know what the effect of the 25's are, but while the color popping effect is certainly a little more muted on a cloudy day, it's still noticeable as all get out for me. The first day I put them on was cloudy and gray, and after the adjustment period, it was like the sun was out with them on. You'll still be able to see colors easily, but I wouldn't wear these in, say, a dark rainstorm. Grey days are still colorful to me. Can't help you here. Haven't had them knocked off my face or dropped them yet. Well, I did drop them once, but my cat-like reflexes allowed me to avoid the resilience test and catch them. Maybe invest in croakies or something. I know it's not the world's most fashionable choice, but it's added security.   You should definitely wear them off-duty in a variety of conditions before you start wearing them regularly for the job, as should everybody. Your eyes aren't used to this. They don't know this. You're going to be second guessing things for a while. Take your time with them and get adjusted to the world again, and if possible, have somebody with you to bounce around questions with, ""Is that really red"", ""what color is that"", etc. Just my two cents.

As Jesus said in Matthew 19:22-26:  23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. 24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”  25 When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?”  26 Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with EnChroma all things are possible.”"

When I put my new glasses on after all that time, I went to the grocery store and felt like a child in a candy store. Everything was so bright, so detailed. I could see words and defined shapes.

You really are missing this whole world of sensation and a lot of beauty that people are told to appreciate and cherish. There are things that color normal people pass by every day that could absolutely floor us if we were suddenly able to distinguish them. Clothing people just throw on and might consider for a second that its a nice color would make our jaws drop. Hazel eyes. Logos for common establishments. A brick house. A sunset or sunrise. I mean there are so many things. And then there's just the misunderstandings and tests and such that occur with people when they find out you're colorblind, and it happens so frequently that it's just common to you. Most of us have had to stick to wearing certain colors that they know they're not confusing with others so they don't look silly or monotone.   Like I said, there's nothing ""life changing"" that I've experienced from CVD, but I can tell you with certainty that it's very much influenced my life subliminally and emotionally."
ColorBlind,32h6bx,ihaverocketlegs,7,Mon Apr 13 20:29:39 2015 UTC,"Deuter here. I don't feel like that at all. I never think about my CVD until I have a problem with it, which is not that often. Mainly when reading colored graphs or charts or trying to descre the color of something.  I might not be the right person to say this, but I feel that colors aren't that important to make something beautiful. Many people with normal color vision actively seek out black and white photos and art. Even in colored images, maybe I can't see all the shades, but it's enough for me to be amazed.   Maybe it would be more beautiful if I could see more shades, but I really doubt it would make a difference to how much I enjoy something. Even with CVD my jaw can drop when I see something amazing. I don't think I would have a double jaw drop if I saw all it's colors."

I love colors, but for my own struggles and reasons I have to exaggerate with colors in my life. Colors and patterns and everything, especially what comes to way I dress. So neon colors, or bold thin stripes in very high contrast colors. And eye shades in bold colors. My eyes are what they are, but I can still see something with them (and a lot more with my fingertips).  Oh, I'm picky about the colors I like. I absolutely hate pinks and peachy/fleshy looking tones, and don't like blood red or 99% of browns.   I love learnig more about color deficiencies. Many sighted people take colors way too seriously. Like when there are 10 shades of natural grays and one of them is supposedly pink or lavender. The color or shade argments never end, even after a braille reader tries to offer some input.. Sigh.  I only know two people among my friends that are colorblind (excluding my blind and vision impaired friends); my husband and a guy who's completely red-green.   Yet as it's one in 12 it's insane how huge ""minority"" you are.  It's insane how much better everything could be designed for safety of everyone. Traffic lights! Anything where it's alert colors etc. And that's just the iceberg.   Flashing emergency lights are useless for me. I don't see them until they are at a blinding distance.

However, mine were either lost or stolen just after a week. The world is a lot less colorful now. The glasses are also too expensive to just replace on a whim. I went through the extra work of going to an eye doctor to verify my colorblindness and to get a note saying these would help. I used my HSA to purchase these as a result. 417$ lost. I wish I had them back."
ColorBlind,32folx,mkomaha,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:59:20 2015 UTC,I left a pair of Maui jims on the table of a restaurant and when I called looking for them they had no record of them in the lost and found even though the busboy was basically waiting for us to leave that night so we are pretty sure what happened to them...  I waited about 2 years before splurging on my enchromas and I am very aware of their location at all times now so hopefully I have been scarred into not leaving expensive sunglasses around anymore.   If I lost these I would probably not buy them again though due to the cost
ColorBlind,32folx,shabby47,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:23:04 2015 UTC,yeah the sweet spot for these is $100. I grew up colorblind(as did we all) so I can deal even though I don't want to. $400 is  an asinine price. I'm near 100% these were stolen by one of my roomie's friends. Which just saddens me. If I ever see them wearing them I'll be sure to know they stole them and I'll take them back.

ColorBlind,32ba0w,rlneub,1 point,Mon Apr 13 07:38:18 2015 UTC,"I believe you are incorrect. My brother who could see some shades of green and some shades of red now sees many shades of green and red and fewer shades of brown.  If you read the enchroma website, they have a notch filter which removes some wavelengths of light that can cause the confusion.  Also when my sister in law wears the glasses (she has normal vision) she says that the greens and reds are brighter and less washed out. I do not hear her saying that the colors shift outside of there being a slight bit of blue seen in the whites which makes sens as the lenses are a bluish tint."
ColorBlind,32ba0w,rlneub,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:15:19 2015 UTC,"So it cuts some of the light wavelengths out, so that you can differentiate between the shades that you can already see better?"
ColorBlind,32ba0w,swizzero,2,Mon Apr 13 13:03:16 2015 UTC,"Hard to say. My brother sees more of the green/brown  red/brown without the glasses and with glasses he sees more green and red. So I guess that is less brown. But for him the tradeoff is worth it as he wears them most of the time and does not want to send them back.  He now sees pink instead of mostly white and a tint of red and it blew him away. Purples also are more easily perceived and he talks about them a lot.  Interestingly, he can now differentiate stoplights at a distance when not wearing the glasses. I saw this comment several places and wonder if the brain is retraining itself on what color actually is. I do not understand why suddenly he can make distinctions without the glasses that he could not make in the past."

I usually mix up the green light and yellow light because one may seem slightly less bright and I'll think ""oh, it's just a dirty/dying traffic light."" I have to really focus on the flow of traffic. Sometimes in the day, if the light is JUST right, I'm completely blind as to what color traffic lights are. I won't be able to tell which of them are actually lit up. I usually have to keep my eyes on the stop light the entire time so I notice any subtle change. Good thing is that I always have a passenger and I'll verify of im unsure. That's just my experience. I haven't driven until recently.. And it's extremely scary and stressful to do.

It is also so odd that the deficiency in color vision (however one wants to call it) is so common, yet so not acknowledged at all. Why donʻt the traffic lights have a bettter way to differentiate? Why are the emergency lights always in colors that are supposedly easy to see (but not really)?"

I think there are traffic lights in China or something that actually have an ""X"" on the stop light, the yield light flashes, and green is just solid green. I think that would be a nice thing to have nationwide. People say the sideways lights help but I don't see how? I would be screwed at night if I saw one of those.  I think emergency lights should have different strobe speeds. Police and ambulances should have like a brief strobe, stop, and repeat. Large trucks should have a slow pulse, but not too slow because drivers need to see them in time and understand what it is.. I don't know. Some vehicles might already have that."

ColorBlind,31n1tq,jrad151,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:28:56 2015 UTC,"It's definitely different than what we see, but I don't think that if we woke up tomorrow and were cured, it would be too much different. I think everything would be prettier, but it's not like we can't see yellow at all or anything and we'd be running around seeing everything as totally different. We could be worse off. At least that's what I tell myself when I'm sad."
ColorBlind,31n1tq,ihaverocketlegs,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:59:27 2015 UTC,"Ya it just weird how some people see two colors that clash. Then I see them and think they look great together. I never know if it's my eyes, or I just have bad taste."
ColorBlind,31n1tq,jrad151,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:29:22 2015 UTC,"Probably because they're not as vibrant and different to you. I've personally never seen the issue with some things as well, but hey. I'll just let them tell me what to do so I don't embarrass myself."
ColorBlind,31n1tq,ihaverocketlegs,14,Mon Apr 6 22:52:49 2015 UTC,"Wait, peanut butter isn't green?"
ColorBlind,31n1tq,sels_jake,14,Mon Apr 6 16:40:11 2015 UTC,"Of course not, silly. ""Green"" is a myth made up by normal-vision folks to further confuse and mock us when playing the ""what color is this"" game."
ColorBlind,31n1tq,BreathingEnthusiast,7,Mon Apr 6 17:56:04 2015 UTC,Not green (according to everyone I've talked to).  I found this out last year at 32 years old.
ColorBlind,31n1tq,Advocate777,5,Mon Apr 6 20:58:21 2015 UTC,"I think it was your post on reddit I looked at and discovered  that. I'm here with ya, man"
ColorBlind,31n1tq,Brigante87,2,Mon Apr 6 23:22:33 2015 UTC,"I found out I was at 22 too, I'm 27 now. I found out after watching an American film called Little Miss Sunshine. Hasn't really affected me much, but made me understand a few things like why I spend ages looking for the right crisps in the cupboard, or a light pink t shirt doesn't look pink at all. Still, its interesting."
ColorBlind,31n1tq,sir_mrej,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:19:29 2015 UTC,What part of Little Miss Sunshine got you?
ColorBlind,31n1tq,kansle,6,Mon Apr 6 16:30:33 2015 UTC,Watch the movie and you'll see
ColorBlind,31n1tq,sir_mrej,3,Mon Apr 6 17:08:27 2015 UTC,"It's a 2 hour movie...so while sure, I might notice it, it was helpful that Brigante actually told me the part :p :) instead of just ""watch it"""
ColorBlind,31n1tq,kansle,3,Mon Apr 6 18:54:56 2015 UTC,"Sorry, it's just that was the only part in the movie related to colorblindness :) sry dude."
ColorBlind,31n1tq,sir_mrej,5,Mon Apr 6 19:46:17 2015 UTC,I've had lots of discussions/arguments with my wife over all different parts of movies. That's a red car. No it's a brown car. That's a green cat. No cats aren't green.  Don't underestimate the ability to not see colors in every situation :)
ColorBlind,31n1tq,ihaverocketlegs,2,Mon Apr 6 20:23:40 2015 UTC,"No, no, I think there's been a misunderstanding. There's not a specific very colorful scene or anything. There's a scene in which a main character finds out he's colorblind and can't be an airforce pilot, and he freaks the hell out because it's his lifelong dream. The OP means he probably saw the character failing the test and also couldn't see the number, and then confirmed his suspicions with an exam."
ColorBlind,31n1tq,sir_mrej,3,Thu Apr 9 12:58:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, someone mentioned there was an actual colorblind test. So now I know there was an actual thing. But I was just insisting to kansle that there could really be many parts to movies that colorblind people have trouble with. That's all :)"
ColorBlind,31n1tq,ihaverocketlegs,2,Thu Apr 9 19:19:03 2015 UTC,"Didn't see it, sorry! Just wanted to clarify myself!"
ColorBlind,31n1tq,sir_mrej,2,Thu Apr 9 19:24:47 2015 UTC,No worries at all!
ColorBlind,31n1tq,Brigante87,4,Thu Apr 9 19:27:17 2015 UTC,"The bit where the kid looks at a book and couldn't see the number. I won't spoil it, but I was sat there thinking... what was he supposed to see? So I googled it!"
ColorBlind,31n1tq,sir_mrej,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:15:45 2015 UTC,I don't remember that part! I will have to rewatch :) Thanks

ColorBlind,31n1tq,c010rb1indusa,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:27:26 2015 UTC,How do you go through life not realizing it? Colors have always befuddled me. Also a strong protan.
ColorBlind,31n1tq,stone500,2,Mon Apr 6 21:25:29 2015 UTC,I did expect that something was wrong with me when I was in middle school. But I never really put a lot of thought into it. I always wore neutral clothing. Always did art with graphite pencils. There were times when I was using colored pencils people would look at me funny because I would pick the wrong color. But I just thought that I wasn't paying attention or just dumb :(
ColorBlind,31n1tq,Skayj2,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:15:00 2015 UTC,"You just realized you're colorblind, but that doesn't mean your vision suddenly got worse.  The only difference is that now you're able to justify whenever you get a color wrong."

ColorBlind,31orqf,SleepWouldBeNice,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:47:17 2015 UTC,"Lucky you. My color vision is OK but I wear strong blueblockers, am extremely light (especially blue) sensitive, and my regular vision is ... Interesting. Not exactly correctable.  Night vision makes it really difficult to see/read/estimate ANY distance/flashing lights blind even the rest of my vision, so no no driver's license. And I find blue extremely difficult to focus also against black background. Can I become a pilot? I'm serious. I could label all the buttons and controllers with braille ;) so at least I'll never need any reading glasses..."

ColorBlind,31orqf,PhantasmalCat,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:12:26 2015 UTC,It's not possible to pass your medical with colorblindness
ColorBlind,31orqf,TFiOS,2,Tue Apr 7 01:38:22 2015 UTC,"Depends on your country, and on the severity of your colour blindness. I cant pass the ishihara test, but I can pass a D-15 or FALANT test, and most certainly a light gun test.   Source: my aviation medical is unrestricted."
ColorBlind,31orqf,mild_anarchist,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:35:14 2015 UTC,"Depends. What test do they use? I know for example many police/fire agencies use the Farnsworth D-15, which I can pass despite being colorblind."
ColorBlind,31orqf,mav89,2,Tue Apr 7 03:20:48 2015 UTC,I know how you feel. I had dreams of being a graphics designer but all the work I have to go through to match correct colors just seems like it will waste a lot of time.
ColorBlind,31p1rf,Chords2Moony,6,Tue Apr 7 01:01:02 2015 UTC,What an odd question. No I don't.
ColorBlind,31p1rf,xelanil,3,Tue Apr 7 05:30:32 2015 UTC,Nope.  I've never had that problem.  Are you saying you have that problem?
ColorBlind,31p1rf,LinleyMike,3,Tue Apr 7 13:15:41 2015 UTC,Yeah its weird. Like sometimes if I'm looking at a picture of a colorful painting with a lot of colors mixed together they kinda blend together and swirl around so I can't tell the difference between any of them
ColorBlind,31p1rf,ihaverocketlegs,3,Tue Apr 7 17:55:05 2015 UTC,"I think that if you have this problem, it's likely something more worth seeing a doctor about than you being colorblind."
ColorBlind,31p1rf,Unuhi,2,Tue Apr 7 13:38:19 2015 UTC,"A braille-reader here. I can kind of do that; if I wear polarized glasses (like for fishing), and look at pretty much anything (tinted windows, anything that reflects or is bright, computer or phone screens, digital movie screens etc, I see ""rainbows"" and it can feel rsther odd. Not as weird as bright orange blueblockers make me feel."

ColorBlind,31jqx5,Twas_Inevitable,3,Sun Apr 5 21:19:01 2015 UTC,What actually is teal? Buggered if I know.
ColorBlind,31jqx5,SurelyIDidThisAlread,2,Mon Apr 6 16:13:05 2015 UTC,"It's just gray, right?"
ColorBlind,31jqx5,EliPoo94,6,Tue Apr 14 00:16:23 2015 UTC,"Yep. Anything salmon colored gives me lots of trouble. If it's remotely dim in the room, then there's no hope."
ColorBlind,31jqx5,TwilightShadow1,3,Sun Apr 5 19:43:10 2015 UTC,"Just two nights ago at indoor soccer I commented on how well a girl on the other team was playing to my friend. He asked which, and I said the one in the grey socks. You can guess where this is going."
ColorBlind,31jqx5,ihaverocketlegs,3,Sun Apr 5 19:59:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, light grays can easily be mistaken for light pinks, and vice versa."
ColorBlind,31jqx5,KisslessVirginLoser,3,Sun Apr 5 20:22:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can think of pink as just a lighter shade of red, so if you are red/green colorblind, I think you can have trouble detecting it."

ColorBlind,31jqx5,RedL45,2,Mon Apr 6 03:59:13 2015 UTC,"Far too many times have I failed at this! The problem is when I see a color I'm unsure about but know its either A or B, I think to myself ""This will be the time I get it right! If I'm right no one will notice and life will be good again!"" I go 100% confident with the color I think it isn't and then end up getting corrected and I still fail miserably.  The worst feeling is knowing your gut was actually right for once, but you decided not to trust it.."

ColorBlind,31ktm2,Eighm,3,Mon Apr 6 01:09:01 2015 UTC,"I'm just regularly vison impaired, but so many things for lenses make a difference. - shade: gray (blue) vs yellow (amber) - treatments (glare etc) - polarization (I have more problems with polarized; hard to see the ground... Yep, I need something for plain running, and polarized lenses don't cut it for me. Too dangerous in too many situations) - any color blocking (I use strong blueblockers in yellow or orange. Those that have labels about not using for driving - as if that was an issue..) I have shades in many colors, to fit with and without many prescriptions. Sometimes the combination is a prescription with shade & another shade over that. So if I wear bright greens, yellows, oranges... Those help that day. I know my color perception is off BUT I can usually just use my eys somewhat comfortsbly, without pain.   Because of the shades I wear, sky may look blue, orange, medium gray... Fedex truck may look orange or neon green... I think I get how big a difference different lenses or shades can make.  And I love when anyone talks a out colors. I think everyone just sees their own, and we are taught to always think sky is blue etc."
ColorBlind,31h2cn,mav89,3,Sun Apr 5 00:36:23 2015 UTC,"They are very active on this sub, and there's a post that should just be a few down from here speaking to this sort of thing, IE subreddit specific discounts. They also do various promotions from time to time. In my opinion they are pretty great already."
ColorBlind,31h2cn,ihaverocketlegs,-6,Sun Apr 5 01:28:09 2015 UTC,"They ARE expensive, period. This subreddit has a hard-on for EnChroma because they post here but the glasses are overpriced,. Period. End of story.    It's like Bose, same thing...it's not the quality, but the price that's the issue. They get away with it because they're one of the few players on the block and honestly, if it were me, I'd do the same thing...but let's not pretend it's some incredibly priced product."
ColorBlind,31h2cn,kennyko,4,Mon Apr 6 03:23:20 2015 UTC,"No. Not period, not end of story. Completely incorrect story. Making up a story because you don't like the price, more like it.   This subreddit has a ""hard on"" for EnChroma because they are the first and only product to do what they do as well as they do it. O2Amp distorts EVERYTHING to such an extent that you have far worse color vision with them on, and they're expensive still. ChromaPop is by a fashion company, and it's not nearly as effective for colorblind users, as well as the effect being dramatically worse. EnChroma is a technology that they were asked to pay out the ass for because the lenses are special produced though an expensive process, and they STILL bumped the price down WAY below what they could be selling them for. It IS the best product for this on the market. It IS worth the money for most people who buy them, and they give you every penny back if you're unsatisfied. You're just here to start arguments and scream and stomp your feet because you don't want to pay. You don't have to. One day the price may come down. It may not. But it's not gonna change because of you, and you're not going to get any less incorrect by whining."

I am physically unable of seeing a full spectrum of color, so how are glasses going to help? They are not adding cones, they are not physically changing the make up of my eyes. I really do not understand why people think these glasses would work."
ColorBlind,31h2cn,603g,2,Sun Apr 5 15:36:31 2015 UTC,"You're right, these glasses won't add any cones to your eyes  From what I know:  What these glasses do is shift the spectrum of incoming light, so that certain wavelengths are easier to distinguish. However, this comes at a trade off of diminishing other wavelengths as well that you can see currently, without the glasses"
ColorBlind,31h2cn,gonewilde_beest,2,Sun Apr 5 16:19:16 2015 UTC,"So instead of being able to identify the color I would just be able to distinguish there is a different color there? Like if I took dark blue and purple which I have trouble distinguishing, and I converted it to black and white I would be able to recognize that there are two distinct shades of gray, but I still wouldn't be able to tell you which one was purple and which one was blue?"
ColorBlind,31h2cn,603g,3,Sun Apr 5 16:37:02 2015 UTC,"The glasses seem to work better on deuteranomaly than protanomaly  I can't explain it in terms of the explanation you gave me, but here's some info on how it works: http://enchroma.com/technology/  Basically, the lenses filter out the 550-575nm spectrum, because in this range, both red and green colours overlap and makes it hard to distinguish. The picture on the site really helps.  So from this, it seems that while you won't be able to see the exact shades of purple, you will be able to tell that they are different from blue."

I remember when they still didn't have the Rx lenses; they need money for development so that others can benefit from such developments like that.

In every enchroma first try video people say they suddenly can identify colors on things which I have no trouble identifying.   I can see what color an LED is I can see pink flowers vs white, I can see green foliage vs yellow, orange or red. I feel red as a warm color, and green as a fresh color. Brown feels like a mushy color. Almost like grey but much more saturated.   What I'm not good at are things like picking berries."

But I can identify all colors if you put them up individually, and almost always identify every color in a picture. It's shades I have problems with, specifically the ""berry"" shades, so shades of purple, red, blue, etc."

ColorBlind,314ljw,speedsk8103,3,Wed Apr 1 23:27:01 2015 UTC,"What you're describing is what colorblindness is. It doesn't mean you can't tell the difference between, for example, specifically all reds and all greens (whatever that would include since color is a spectrum). It means the area of the spectrum certain of your cones can pick up is shifted from the normal.  And there are certainly degrees of colorblindness. It depends on the amount of shifting. Additionally some people are missing cones which is a rarer but more severe form.  Hope this helps!"
ColorBlind,314ljw,MechanicalYeti,3,Thu Apr 2 01:26:15 2015 UTC,"We more or less use logic and experience to see color rather than actually seeing color.  Take the test currently on the front page, http://www.reddit.com/r/ColorBlind/comments/30vi0y/gretchen_culp_needs_participants_for_map/, and the initial color sorting exercise will let you know for certain just how well you can or cannot see color.  It doesn't tell you the answer but you will sit there and one circle will be green and then once you put it up on the board and compare it turns purple, so you move it and then in comparison again it is now appearing orange, etc.  It says the test is around 15 minutes, it took me 15 minutes to do this first sorting exercise.  I think for most of us we learn how to compare and we also learn how others see things and thus what we should be seeing. This means that we can assume much about color like grass is green and apples are red, but if we see light colored grass or light colored apples we can assume the grass is getting brown(along with the season of fall) and that the apple is probably a green apple."

ColorBlind,310n73,Beta_leonis,14,Fri Apr 3 01:35:06 2015 UTC,"Aside from all the normal ""what color is this"" questions, I have a few horror stories (I've posted about these before.)   Once at my job, I was assigned a work request that was color-coded in a way that I couldn't see.  When I informed my boss and asked for a different method of coding, he refused, and wrote me up for insubordination.  Then, when I contested the write-up through our local HR, I was told that I could have the mark removed from my record if I took a remedial art class at our local community college -- ""so that you can finally learn your colors."" Another work-related color issue:  when I received an email that had different portions of text highlighted with red and green font colors, I turned over to my coworker in the next cube and asked her help deciphering.  Her answer was, ""if you're colorblind, then how can you read at all?""  She explained her reasoning, that if I was ""failing"" at something so basic as telling colors apart, then obviously there's something fundamentally wrong with my brain that I can't do anything else basic, either.  Lesson learned:  go ask a different coworker about color questions. I was at a committee meeting at my church not long after buying a new car.  The minister asked the obvious curious question:  what color is it?  My defense mechanism kicked in right away:  I don't answer color questions at all, even if I know the intention is good:  either I get it wrong and the person rubs my face in the ""mistake"", or I get it right and I'm accused of lying about my colorblindness.  So I avoided the question. Another person in the room picked up on my avoidance, and displaying a very heroic lack of voice control, she literally shouted, ""This guy doesn't know the color of his own car!  That's so funny!  Can we put that in the minutes?  Let's put that in the minutes!""   Sigh."

As the professor walked around the class I told him I was colorblind and this likely wasn't going to work out well for me, and it didn't. The classes are long at that college and there's a short break in the middle. While we were on break I was outside the building just sitting on a little concrete bench and a random girl from class walked over to me. She bent down in front of me and stared directly in my eyes from like a foot away for an extremely awkward amount of time. I said ""Can I help you with someth-"" she cut me off saying ""I can't even tell."", to which I of course inquired ""tell.... what?"", she responded ""That you is colorblind."""

And for about the last three decades, some people with color vision problems have used red tinted contact lenses.  The problem is that by blocking all the blue and green light, such lenses make it harder to tell blues, greens and violets apart. The lenses also reduce the overall amount of light coming into the eye, so, like sunglasses, they are not recommended for use at night.  ''Over all, they make your color vision worse, but they can help you distinguish certain colors,'' said Dr. Wayne A. Verdon, an assistant professor of clinical optometry at the University of California at Berkeley."

But they make everything else very monochromatic and hard to tell apart. A lot of these glasses will promote themselves by saying that they can  help you pass a colorblind test. That's true, they will, by fundamentally changing every single color you are viewing.

This means that small LEDs on a black or grey panel are simply not sufficiently identifiable to me. They are small, there is little color for me to see and nothing to compare it to.  As well, lighting conditions play a huge role as well. I imagine in the sky around clouds that light conditions change often.

This is an extremely difficult question to answer, because there are so many types of colorblindness.  My first piece of advice for designers is go ahead and use whatever colors work well for most people.  But make sure that any information which is conveyed by a difference in color is also conveyed by some other means, such as particles, a difference in the icon/shape/sprite, or possibly text if it's a GUI.  For example, if your ship takes damage and changes from green to red, then also add spark particles coming off of it.  If a purple demon is much tougher than a blue one, then its horns should be longer as well.  If you do need to ask about specific colors in a place like this, it's much better to come in with screenshots or images showing the proposed icons/sprites.  Different images with different palettes are good, so you can get some A/B feedback as well.  Make sure to include the expected background colors too.  Context is everything with color vision."

ColorBlind,30pl76,Kmoes,4,Sun Mar 29 16:51:44 2015 UTC,"You see this? This is a screenshot from Pokemon Puzzle Challenge. The only block puzzle game where my colorblindness has been a complete non-issue. I play this game and I don't even realize there are similar colors in it. Look closely at how the important information is reinforced.  First, you'll note that the puzzle blocks, whose color-coding is the most important, have bold, unique silhouettes. Stars and squares appear almost the same color for me, but because of the light-on-dark outline hinting, I've never once had to think about their color when matching them under time pressure.  Second, notice that ""special"" objects in the play area have different styles. That ""garbage"" block on top of the stack is missing the individualized outline that the puzzle blocks have, because it's not a block I can directly interact with. The cursor is a bright white and contrasts with everything on screen, and overlaps the outlines of the blocks so that it doesn't blend in.  Finally, notice the way parts of the screen are portioned off. The ""play area"" has a simple repeating texture, and although you can't see it here, it does actually drift diagonally during the game, further solidifying it as the ""background"" texture. The stats and flavor art are stacked in the remaining space, and, although this has nothing to do with colorblindness, it's nice that the damage meter is placed next to the opposing pokemon's portrait, to reinforce that that's where my attacks are going.  So, in summary, I don't care what color combinations you use as long as you have unique silhouettes, and you can use textures, brightness, and overlap to distinguish between back, middle, and foreground. If all else fails, pick colors that work even after you run them through a grayscale filter."

Red/Green Dark Green/Brown Bright Green/Yellow Green/Orange Blue/Purple Light Blue/Pink Grey/Pink   If your looking for games that have excellent colorblind options, check out Battlefield 4. It has colorblind settings for multiple types of colorblindness and shows you a legend of how the colors will change so you can see how it takes effect. It's really well done.  It's also important to differentiate on items other than color if you want to avoid the issue. If there is some sort of visual indicator that accompanies color choices, that could work as well.

I mentioned in another thread how with something like a stop sign (which I didn't have problems with anyway) somebody who now sees it as red with the glasses on might see the other visual cues (shape, size, location etc.) and knowing what color it should be, continue to see the red without the glasses on.

ColorBlind,30fpjd,J4ymoney,5,Fri Mar 27 00:06:42 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the 'shade' of the color. Each color has a vast range of shades, so it'll be easy tell the difference between a dark red vs a bright green. But the dark red may appear red/brown/dark green and the light green may appear green/yellow/orange. It's all context. If someone put a dark red and bright green next to each other and they said ""which one is red and which is green"" you will know because your only two options are red and green.  At least, that's what it's like for me.   But to answer your question, that's still colorblind. Putting things next to eachother and telling they're different colors is just due to shading. Not knowing what color they are on their own is what makes us colorblind."
ColorBlind,30fpjd,Twas_Inevitable,3,Fri Mar 27 02:01:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not color blind myself, but I very much want to understand it.  I've seen several photos that compare 2 of the same images, where one has a red-green colorblind filter. It honestly shocked me because it looks like two completely different worlds. The color blind filter doesn't necessarily look bad, but just extremely unfamiliar to me. Without any red, nearly everything looked different. White skin tones looked more white with a slight greenish-gray tint, blonde hair almost looked like it had no pigment (if I remember right), sky blue was a bit more muted, a majority of thing were olive-toned, etc. Honestly, I found it fascinating. It's both eerie and intriguing to look through a new lens.   Putting things next to eachother and telling they're different colors is just due to shading. Not knowing what color they are on their own is what makes us colorblind.   I'm really glad you said this, because I've been so confused. I often hear color blind people say they can in fact see red, but have a difficult time distinguishing that from some shade of green. I never understood that, because what they do perceive as red, isn't red. And what red is for a color blind person, is actually some type of army green for a normal-vision person, from what I understand. I think you're saying something similar to that, by being able to differentiate colors just by the shading, and not the actual color.  Thank you (: I do understand color blindness a little better now."
ColorBlind,30fpjd,throw_away_x3,4,Fri Mar 27 03:16:22 2015 UTC,"You are most welcome! And we are saying similar things. One way I look at how CB people look at colors is that we use our brains, not our eyes. What I mean is, we use logic to figure out the color, rather than our eyes to tell us what the color is. If you hold up a green piece of paper, depending on the shade, I can not tell you if it's green, brown, red, yellow, or maybe even orange. BUT if you point to the grass and ask what color it is, I know that grass = green so I will say green. It is all about context.  My favorite Color Blind story - To me, I see stop lights as Red/Red/White, but I know they are Red/Yellow/Green. Because I thought crosswalk lights would match the stop lights, I always thought crosswalk lights were Red/Green. I didn't realize they were Red/White until my 20s when I said it outline and my friend corrected me. In that scenario, my eyes were actually correct, but I was using context to label the colors."
ColorBlind,30fpjd,Twas_Inevitable,5,Fri Mar 27 03:38:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Context makes a lot of sense, and I'm really happy to hear color blind people don't actually need to be able to see all colors to get around just fine.  I am confused about something though. You said you see stop lights as red/red/white. But you can't see the color red? Doesn't red to a color blind person look like another shade of dark/olive green? What do you mean when you say you see red/red/white, and why not call it green/green/white if that is what you see (of course, I don't know what you see though).  I'm sorry if I sound so ignorant. I'm so curious and am often afraid to talk about this with color blind people because I think it's rude, so please don't feel obligated to answer."
ColorBlind,30fpjd,throw_away_x3,3,Fri Mar 27 16:14:48 2015 UTC,"Oh not a problem at all! Not a bad question. When I say red/red/white, and you ask why I don't say green/green/white, it's because not all reds = green. Just certain shades. To me, the light is more of an orangey red, not a flat/solid red. Which you might say ""well that's how normal vision people see it too, orangey red"", but let me tell you this next part to give a better understanding of what I mean.   Now, this part might get confusing, so bare with me. you see the light as red. I see the light as  ""red"". If I were to take an ""eye screenshot"" of what I see, you might call it green. But I call it red because (going back to what I mentioned before) context.   So you and I might both be calling the same color the same thing, but see two totally different colors."
ColorBlind,30fpjd,Twas_Inevitable,3,Sat Mar 28 02:05:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about the stop lights (traffic lights). They look Red/Red/White to me!   I was recently told that the crosswalk lights were a Orange light (Hand) and a White light (Man).   Any normal color vision people, are the crosswalk lights Red/White or Orange/White? (Either way the light looks just like the Red and Yellow Traffic lights to me)"

ColorBlind,30fpjd,throw_away_x3,3,Fri Mar 27 16:08:25 2015 UTC,"To go a little deeper though, with me it is not that putting red and green next to each other and asking which is which helps me, it's if you put red and green together and say ""what are these two colors?"" I will be able to say which is red and which is green.   In the case where you put a single confusing color in front of me, like a dark green, I would say it's either red or green, but I'm not 100% sure which.   My colorblindness is more of an -or- situation I feel. It never takes me more than two guesses to get it right. Maybe that is a good way to measure how bad it is. We could devise a test with a number of tricky colors and see the average number of guesses to get the colors correct. Am I on to something here?"
ColorBlind,30fpjd,shabby47,2,Fri Mar 27 11:38:52 2015 UTC,"You say that f someone hands you two colors you could say which one is red and which is green without them saying one is read and one is green, but what if brown is thrown into the mix? I think you're stuck on green/red and not thinking about other colors (since all we have been talking about is green/red). To me, brown and dark green are very similar. As are some oranges and reds.   I get what you mean about getting a color correct within 2 guesses, but really it's more like ""ok, I know the color is within this wheel of colors. I'll name them off until I'm correct"". Sometimes it's 2, sometimes it's 3."
ColorBlind,30fpjd,Twas_Inevitable,1 point,Sat Mar 28 02:16:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about the other colors too. Though he makes a great idea for a colorblind test.   If someone were to show me a color (not on an object) and I had to guess it with one try, without multiple choice, I'd certainly fail. Mainly because I second guess myself so much. Without context I'm lost.. like ""the car must be blue because not many people have a purple car"" or ""that orange light must be red because it's a traffic light and everyone's stopped""."
ColorBlind,30fpjd,stubborn_Analyst,3,Sat Mar 28 04:08:00 2015 UTC,Sounds mostly similar to me. The only good way to know is to go to an eye center and get tested by an optometrist. There are different types of color blindness and within those there are levels (weak-moderate-strong).   I notice that my color guessing ability diminishes alot in lower light. I only play UNO if there adequate lighting!
ColorBlind,30fpjd,stubborn_Analyst,3,Fri Mar 27 00:24:31 2015 UTC,"And if you get a color wrong and someone tells you the correct color, you suddenly see it as correct? Because if so, your color vision is pretty much like me. The thing is, colorblind is a misnomer. Most ""colorblind"" people are in fact color deficient. Meaning you have fewer cones or rods or whatever (I'm no scientist!) in your eyes than a normal vision person. There are people that cannot see red or green completely, but from what I understand, it's much more rare than a general deficiency.    Also I wonder if it has to do with a misconnection between the eyes and the brain... Going back to my initial comment about being able to ""change"" what I see when someone tells me differently has me wondering. Also the fact that I can actually see (or think I'm seeing) red and mixed together whenever I've tried mushrooms."

It's an opportunity to look at things a little differently.

ColorBlind,30bh7a,stubborn_Analyst,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:57:49 2015 UTC,"I was wondering about the 1% claim as well.  So I thought about the rgb palette on computers.  It's not a perfect analogy, but might be instructive.  In this palette each of the red, green, and blue channels are given 8 bits to represent their contribution to a final color.  These 24 total bits allow for 16.8 million colors.  As a red-green colorblind person, it is possible my red and green portions have reduced functionality.  Technically the long and medium wavelength cones have closer peaks.  This might be modeled as a reduction of the normal 16 bits of information to something less.  For example, if I only had 9 bits between them (because they are so close) I would be losing 7 bits of the potential spectrum.  This would result in 24 - 7 = 17 bits which can only represent 217 = 131072 colors.  This is less than 1% of the original.  Now of course our eyes see in a continuous spectrum with more than 8 bits per ""channel"".  But interestingly if we increased this toy model to 16 bits per channel, the fixed loss of a total 7 bits still is a 128x reduction in color spectrum.  I believe my Canon camera has 14 bits per channel, which might be closer to human perception?  Where reality is I don't know, but man, it makes me wonder, how much am I truly missing?"

CVD is a genetic condition which impedes your ability to perceive the world and which is now possible to largely correct for. If you can do a job under the conditions required you should not be excluded for your color blindness when it is possible to make a reasonable accommodation and allow you to get it. That is the basic tenet of the ADA.  It is not an issue of trying to claim the same status as people who are ""really disabled,"" it is being able to use the protections of the act such that you are not unreasonably excluded from a job which you are qualified and can perform the same way anyone else can. If they cannot, then they don't get the job. Seems simple.  edit: if you want EnChroma eyewear to be covered by insurance that would happen by contacting VSP, Eyemed and Davis Vision.

In the snow or the rain I have numerous times nearly been rear-ended slowing for a green or nearly hit running a flashing yellow, it's scary and we could fix it, perhaps not tomorrow, but with effort a decade or two from now."
ColorBlind,3056lr,DBuckFactory,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:58:57 2015 UTC,That's interesting about the changing of the lights. I swear there are two or three different color street lights in my area. It gets frustrating driving at night.   It seems hard to invoke a change like this for only some of the 8% of people with CVD. But bring in the cost savings with LEDs and everyone is seeming to jump on it now. Too bad they chose the wrong color LEDs.
ColorBlind,3056lr,Beta_leonis,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:24:11 2015 UTC,"Street light meaning street lamp on the side of the road. Traffic light for the red/yellow/green lights.  But hey, I don't feel like arguing about situations that you've personally never been in. I don't expect everyone to have experienced the same things. There are many types of color blindness..  To be clear, I'm not stating an opinion when I say the street lights have looked like the green traffic lights, that sir is a fact, from my personal experiences and others with similar CVD. Just because you never been in a situation doesn't make it something that hasn't happened for other people.  Plenty of times I have been on a country road with single flashing yellow/red traffic lights in poorly lite conditions. Almost no street lights (lamps).  Not meaning to come off arogant. I said I didn't want to argue but also I didn't want to leave the facts unstated."
ColorBlind,3056lr,ihaverocketlegs,2,Thu Mar 26 20:17:19 2015 UTC,"Heck, for Traffic lights, I would love it if they made the lights different shapes. Say an octagon for Red (like a stop sign), A triangle for Yellow (Like a yield sign) and just keep Green a Circle."

ColorBlind,303aa7,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:24:08 2015 UTC,"Section 4. Cultivated varieties of article  Eggplant:       Different varieties of the plant produce fruit of different size, shape, and color, though typically purple. The most widely cultivated varieties (cultivars) in Europe and North America today are elongated ovoid, 12–25 cm long (4 1⁄2 to 9 in) and 6–9 cm broad (2 to 4 in) in a dark purple skin.  A much wider range of shapes, sizes and colors is grown in India and elsewhere in Asia. Larger varieties weighing up to a kilogram (2.2 pounds) grow in the region between the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, while smaller varieties are found elsewhere. Colors vary from white to yellow or green, as well as reddish-purple and dark purple. Some cultivars have a color gradient, from white at the stem to bright pink to deep purple or even black. Green or purple cultivars in white striping also exist. Chinese varieties are commonly shaped like a narrower, slightly pendulous cucumber, and are sometimes called Japanese eggplants in North America.  Oval or elongated oval-shaped and black-skinned cultivars include 'Harris Special Hibush', 'Burpee Hybrid', 'Black Magic', 'Classic', 'Dusky', and 'Black Beauty'. Slim cultivars in purple-black skin include 'Little Fingers', 'Ichiban', 'Pingtung Long', and 'Tycoon'; in green skin, 'Louisiana Long Green' and 'Thai (Long) Green'; in white skin, 'Dourga'. Traditional, white-skinned, egg-shaped cultivars include 'Casper' and 'Easter Egg'. Bicolored cultivars with color gradient include 'Rosa Bianca', 'Violetta di Firenze', 'Bianca Smufata di Rosa' (heirloom), and 'Prosperosa' (heirloom). Bicolored cultivars with striping include 'Listada de Gandia' and 'Udumalapet'. In some parts of India, miniature varieties (most commonly called vengan) are popular. A particular variety of green brinjal known as Matti gulla is grown in Matti, a village of the Udupi district in Karnataka state.

We were just tagging along with the paint company's ad, so we were not running the show on what went in.

I feel like I'm missing the world all the time. Like I'm not seeing so much beauty, no matter how hard I try. My girlfriend of 5 years tries to help. But that's the hardest part for me. She's a redhead. Every person I've ever talked to about her has told me she has the most beautiful red hair they've ever seen. And sometimes I just think, ""Fuck."" I'm missing it. I'm missing my love. I know her hair is beautiful to me, but hearing just how much normal vision people rave about it and knowing that I'm red deficient, it kills.   Two days ago, during one of our semi-regular conversations about this, I asked her what the most vibrant colors she'd ever seen were. She said Dover, England without a pause, a trip I took with her two years ago. She said the greens were unlike anything she's ever seen, the yellow flowers on the white cliffs were more beautiful than she could describe, and the colors on the lighthouse we approached made her tear up. I had a duller experience than that. So much duller.   I bought the glasses last night. I held off for months. Maybe it was the video, maybe I finally just nutted up and did it because I got reimbursed big time by work this week. I'm just sick of missing out. I can't get it out of my head that every memory I have is tarnished by the colors I'm missing. I know that's ridiculous, I'm very aware. Doesn't make me cry any less.

That being said, I can say what would be good in my opinion.  What kind of colored paper makes a huge difference. Are you planning on using pastel, neon, or ""normal"" colors? Pastels are generally ok, and easy to read black ink on, but expect some confusion between purple and blue. Neon can be incredibly difficult: literally an eyesore to read from, and greens, yellows, and oranges are near impossible to distinguish. ""Normal"" colored paper is the easiest to distinguish, but any darker colors like blue are hard to read black ink on.    I would honestly use whatever paper you like/fits in budget/etc and just label ""agenda item 3"" so people don't have to rely on the color."

I think sun-to-eye exposure causes the colourblind to be even worse temporarily.   Furthermore, you've got to keep in mind what CVD is all about. Your eyes are picking up colours from what you're looking at but they don't have the tools to accurately define the colour so it sends an incomplete message to your brain, which your brain then fills in the blanks to translate what you see into what it believes is the most correct.   Therefore, you may see green when it's green under certain lighting conditions and it may appear orange the next day."

Our app is being updated at the same time for this screening purpose. If you look at our Facebook page we have a call out for protans to come in for testing this week; we will have a better idea when that is done. If I were a medium to strong protan and ordering them in Rx or overseas I would wait a bit, 2-3 weeks, just to see how this settles itself.

My partner has mild/moderate Protanopia and uses a computer a lot for movies, games etc. I was really excited about the prospect of them being able to see the differences between colours I can pick out quickly but takes them much longer.  Is this to say they'll have no effect, little effect or even a damaging effect?"
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,stubborn_Analyst,2,Tue Mar 24 09:09:29 2015 UTC,"Definately not a damaging effect, and if it is mild/moderate may well work.

ColorBlind,2zhqa5,JewFroMonk,11,Wed Mar 18 18:05:21 2015 UTC,"This is awesome! /u/EnChroma came through with an indoor lens! I can't imagine the level of dedication your team has put forth to make this happen! A flood of questions come to mind, but my top three..    Are these safe to use outside too (All day like normal glasses or do we need to own indoor and outdoor glasses)?  Will you be offering a more indoor appropriate frame style (Like a thin rectangle prescription frame)? What about trade-ins for recent purchases before the announcement?"
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,stubborn_Analyst,8,Wed Mar 18 19:00:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks stubborn_Analyst, yes it has been a lot of hard work.   The Cx-65 is certainly 'safe' for outdoor use, they block all UVA/UVB light. It is just lighter than most people would want a sunglass to be. You would want both pairs to have the effect in eyeglasses for indoor use and sunglasses for outdoor situations where you ought to be wearing a sunglass. The outdoor ones are also more effective in strong direct sunlight. Yes we are working on adding additional styles and you will see them come on the website over the week. Some are more rectangular and indoor focused, I don't know if any are completely rectangular. We also offer 3rd party frame service now, so if you want to send in a new frame you find elsewhere we can now put our lenses in them.  It is really a separate line of products, not a new version which would supersede the old, but if you are in the return period and want the other model contact our customer support."

ColorBlind,2zhqa5,SiON42X,4,Thu Mar 19 14:44:56 2015 UTC,I was so excited to receive my enchroma glasses a few weeks ago. Mine were stolen though. I think someone thought they were just really nice sun glasses. I've been bummed out since. I finally saw things I've been missing out on..then just stolen. ugh. These glasses were awesome. Now I just need the indoor model.
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,SiON42X,4,Thu Mar 19 17:47:03 2015 UTC,"Hey EnChroma! I have a question for you.  I'm sure the idea has been thrown around so I'm not running to the patent office or anything, but I'm curious as to how possible a screen filter might be someday. For example, You see the people in some offices that put privacy sheets of plastic on their computer screen, so it can't be viewed from any angle other than head on where they sit. So that concept, the same plastic/whatever sheet, but it acts like an indoor CX-65 lens, and opens up that color on artificial light and computer screens. Or even possibly phone touchscreens, tablets, televisions, yadda yadda. Is that something that would maybe be possible in the future? Or is it something where you have the capability maybe, but are trying to get around the blue tint of the filter?  I ordered a pair of outdoor glasses last night. The second they arrive, I'm jumping in the car and I'm going to visit my redheaded, blue eyed girlfriend in Washington DC during the cherry blossom blooms, and heading to Georgetown again. I can't wait. Thank you for everything."
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,SiON42X,3,Tue Mar 24 15:14:27 2015 UTC,"you, sir, have awesome priorities.  +1"
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,simnick,2,Sat Mar 28 05:26:06 2015 UTC,"Without going too much into the details, I mean we have been here five years spitballing every idea so we have gone down every avenue and patented a bunch of it, but the issue regarding viewing Tvs etc is that you are working with the light spectrum they produce via LCD etc. The best situation for us is being given the full spectrum from the sun, and electronic devices dont give you anything quite like that. We are getting better at working in places other than the optimum case, as you can see with the Cx-65, but its still hard to execute on these ideas."
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,stubborn_Analyst,2,Wed Mar 25 17:37:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! So cool to be able to talk to you in this kind of forum.  Yeah, I didn't think I was thinking of anything that hasn't been analyzed 3 or 4 years ago. I understand. I mean I still have trouble grasping how a sheet of plastic can just suddenly make your eyes ""see"" things they can't see, but that explanation actually makes a lot of sense. I would love to try the Cx-65, however I live in IL. But once the backorder clears (I hope it's not TOO bad) I can't wait to try my Cx-14s."
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,stubborn_Analyst,3,Wed Mar 25 18:05:58 2015 UTC,This is amazing news! Will the indoor lenses be as effective when looking at a computer screen?  The sunglasses are first on my list; I can't wait to see what fall really looks like.
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,caepuccino,3,Wed Mar 18 22:43:58 2015 UTC,"Fall is amazing you will not be disappointed.   Will the indoor lenses be as effective when looking at a computer screen?   The indoor glasses should be more effective when looking at a computer screen.   The way it works is that there is an optimal lighting condition (bright sunlight) and an optimal lens configuration (mid-strength sunglass), which will promote the best overall experience. But for peoples real-world applications there are tradeoffs. The sunglass can be too strong for low and artificial light conditions, so the Cx-65 is more effective when used that way. A mid-stength sunglass can also be too light for really bright sun conditions, which will hurt your eyes.   It is just about selecting the right lens for your application."
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,stubborn_Analyst,3,Wed Mar 18 22:49:31 2015 UTC,"I don't remember their being two sunglasses options (Cx-14 & Cx-25) before. Can you talk about the differences there as well?  I am excited about the indoors, but debating whether to get indoor or outdoor first to try EnChroma. If I were interested in both, but wanted to get one to try first, what would you suggest?"
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,stubborn_Analyst,3,Wed Mar 18 22:55:11 2015 UTC,"I would say the outdoor models are probably the best to try first, it would depend if for you the outdoors is hiking in bright sunlight (Cx-14) or getting coffee in Manhattan (Cx-25). If what you really want to be able to do is shop for clothes or groceries, or play online MMO games , then the indoor works better at those applications, even if it has a little less impact.  The number after the Cx is the visible light transmission level, so the Cx-14 is the darkest lens with 14% transmission. A standard sunglass is 16%, though ours actually appears brighter than normal because of the way the filters have such sharp cutoffs. It is passing 80% of some areas of reds, which are not harmful."
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,Ron1319,2,Wed Mar 18 23:06:21 2015 UTC,"Interesting...I live in a fairly bright area (Virginia Beach), but it can be fairly overcast or hazy here. There's also enough trees and buildings around to make a decent amount of shadows. It sounds like the Cx25 would be best, as it would work in lower light outdoors but provide a bit less sunlight protection when it is bright and sunny out. Is that right?"
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,oronbz,2,Thu Mar 19 01:44:57 2015 UTC,"Yes that is exactly it, they all, even the Cx-65, provide 100% UVA/UVB protection so it is not a question of accepting damage. It is just about comfort level in bright sunlight vs ability to adapt to shadows and cloudy conditions. It sounds like the Cx-25 would be right for you."
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,pinebarren,2,Thu Mar 19 17:02:15 2015 UTC,"One last question and I'll stop bugging you: I've never been much of a sunglasses guy. If I get the cx-65 and wear it on a really bright day, I might squint a bit but would I have the same level of color correction? Would it be over saturated?"
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,pinebarren,2,Thu Mar 19 19:05:37 2015 UTC,The CVD correction would not be as strong as the Cx-25 under bright sunlight conditions. It should still work.

ColorBlind,2zhqa5,Murph785,2,Thu Mar 19 19:25:25 2015 UTC,"Well, I live in Seattle, so Cx-25 sound like a great start for me. As soon as I can dig up my prescription, I will order at pair of Cx-25, and then, if it works, buy some indoors!"
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,dee84,1 point,Sat Mar 21 02:55:25 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, I didn't notice when I bought mine. I'm looking online at the EnChroma Cx Elite. It doesn't specify an option for Cx-14 or Cx-25. I own these in the Standard Lens (Non-prescription), so which Cx did I get?   I noticed in Additional Information, under Visible Light Transmission it says Category 3 (20%).   That's confusing me, do I have a the Category 3 Cx-14 lens or lenses that allow 20% light transmission?"
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,TurntLemons,2,Thu Mar 19 16:09:47 2015 UTC,"Everything that has shipped is the Cx-14, the new models have just been announced and will ship 3/30."
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,gdeest,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:03:38 2015 UTC,"Ohhh gotcha, I wasn't sure if the categories were a new thing or if I had just missed it. Is it safe to assume the higher the % of light transmission the more color corrective affect the user experiences?   If the Cx-14 has a mild noticeable affect on the colors I see, would the Cx-65 have more, the same, or less of a color correction affect?"
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,amuk,2,Thu Mar 19 20:16:42 2015 UTC,"No, it is really situational. A sunglass does not perform as well indoors as a lens which passes more light. The sunglass is just too dark and it does not have the strength of signal it needs to work correctly. Outdoors in bright sunlight the sunglass has enough signal to do its thing, but the indoor lenses would be uncomfortable because the light is too bright.  I feel the effect of the sunglasses outdoors in bright sunlight, more or less ideal conditions, is stronger than the effect of the Cx-65 indoors when viewing the computer or something like produce/cooking meat under indoor lighting. It is hard to say, the outdoor lenses work well for normals like me and make everything hyperbright, the indoors one is a bit more subtle but people with CVD have given us really good feedback."
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,stubborn_Analyst,2,Fri Mar 20 22:57:15 2015 UTC,when you say the indoor lenses would be uncomfortable outside you mean it would be as uncomfortable as any normal prescription glasses (non-sunglasses without any enchroma lens) or it has other implications? another question: are the Cx-65 lenses fitted for replacing completely my normal prescription glasses?
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,stubborn_Analyst,3,Sat Mar 21 20:22:51 2015 UTC,"Right, uncomfortable as in wearing any indoor lens outdoors is not going to give you the kind of protection a sunglass will. Yes the Cx-65s can replace your normal prescription lenses."
ColorBlind,2zhqa5,stubborn_Analyst,1 point,Sat Mar 21 21:54:14 2015 UTC,"Ok, that makes sense! You mentioned that the Cx-65 works for MMO games/TV.

I typically play games/watch TV movies in the dark, would that effect my experience wearing the Cx-65?  Edit: BTW.. Thanks for always answering all of our questions.

ColorBlind,2zhqa5,Hydr0xygen,3,Sat Mar 21 22:00:33 2015 UTC,"So they pass 65% of the light, so driving at night would be preferable without them?

ColorBlind,2z4r2k,stubborn_Analyst,3,Sun Mar 15 15:53:57 2015 UTC,"I have a strangely vivid memory from my childhood of when I first ""decided"" to have a favorite color. I don't know how old I was, maybe 6, and I was coloring with Crayola markers. The sunlight hit a still-wet blue patch I had colored and I thought it was so amazing I made it my favorite... that sticks with me. Other colors are so muddled that I can rarely classify them confidently.  Fast forward to now. I am 39 and color is not a big part of my life. My SO describes things to me now in terms of shape, class, position or size because she's learned calling something ""the red one"" will just cause confusion and lead to more questions.   I still gravitate to blue things, especially royal or bright blue. If the shade is such that I can't be certain it's not some purple or aqua I like it less. I have a blue phone case, blue pocket knife, etc. I seem to like blue trinkets of this sort but don't typically dress myself in blue.  I like blue when I can be sure it's blue, basically. Often the world looks like a box of crayons with the wrappers removed... I can't be certain of classifying anything sometimes. I'm not comfortable with color, I find it frustrating and I don't think about color if I can help it. But I do understand your bug-to-a-zapper analogy when it comes to certain blues."

Also, human vision evolved to make use of the light from the Sun that made it to the surface of the Earth, not to make use of light from stars outside our solar system.   what's your thoughts on favorite colors?    As someone who is obsessed with color vision, and has normal color vision...I actually don't have much emotional attachment to any color.  I enjoy color vision, not color; yes, I'm a weirdo.  If people ask for my favorite color, I usually respond, ""don't really have one, but let's say eigengrau"".

Here are my observations about using inverted colors:  They are sort of inverted, but e.g. what looks mint green may be brownish red in regular colors. I can look at people on pictures and videos and can recognize that they are people and what gender they look like, but I can't tell if someone's supposedly 'black' or 'white'. Or blond, or brunette, or Asian. Golden/bright yellow hues look like dull or bright blues. All ""social media blues"" - facebook, twitter and whatnot are shades of bright orange to pale, boring bland dirty yellows. Twitter's webpage with cloudy light blue and white sky looks like patterns of coagulated blood.  Those are more exaggerated as my screen is usually very dim, and I wear strong yellow, blueblocking shades (or prescriptions that allow bit more blue light in).  I love other colors for other uses. For running, i have Uvex orange safety goggles that block blue. Those give really wild color vision, and they work for running, but I try to not wear them otherwise as the color contrasts are odd (also don't need a headache).

ColorBlind,2yi9no,talk_to_me_goose,2,Tue Mar 10 00:56:52 2015 UTC,"it is difficult or impossible for a colorblind individual to distinguish between colors along a single confusion line, if we ignore the positive or negative effects of luminance   Yes.  That is exactly what a confusion line is supposed to be.  That's basically the definition.   there are actually an infinite number of confusion lines. that is, you could draw a line from the copunctal point to any point on the edge of the color space to create a confusion line.   Yes.   given two confusion lines and again ignoring luminance, there is an angular value between these two lines at which a colorblind individual could discern between a point on one line and a point on the other line. say, two reds could be discerned if one is trending towards yellow and the other is trending towards purple.   The CIE 1931 color space is not perceptually uniform.  You might want to look into CIELAB or CIELUV, which are supposed to be much more perceptually uniform when it comes to normal human color vision.  However, these spaces are for normal trichromats.  I am not sure what transformations you would have to do to make those spaces perceptually uniform for anomalous trichromats or dichromats, nor am I confident you could craft those transformations on theoretical grounds alone.  Of course, it all matters how much accuracy you want, and what sorts of color vision deficiencies you want to tangle with.  I would also advise caution before preceding with an angle based approach.  Existing color spaces with perceptual uniformity use distances instead of angles.  I think you might be too hung up on the idea of confusion lines as THE way to think about color vision deficiencies."

I should clarify I expect I will need to make some strong assumptions at first. it's clearly a very complex subject. At least this gives me a better idea of what my assumptions are.

It might not be incredibly useful for you, but it basically allowed me to keep my job. For her reaction, I've never gotten a negative response from it.

I have the cruel misfortune as well of being a protanope dating a redhead. Can't even see most of her shades."
ColorBlind,2ya1ed,Dj_Nussdog,2,Sun Mar 22 19:20:03 2015 UTC,"I'm protan deficient as well. It was really cool going through the house looking at stuff while using the app. She was blown away. She also has a better understanding over anyone else I know about how i see the world.  My worries about her being able to really explain what I'm missing were eliminated. It's a bummer, not being able to see the world in the detail of a ""normal"" person, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be.  I wonder how long until a procedure is available to correct colorblindness. Or how about some type of contact to wear?"
ColorBlind,2ya1ed,ihaverocketlegs,2,Mon Mar 23 06:32:53 2015 UTC,"So I downloaded the app. I have to say that I think the most severe colorblindness for each of the types is shown, because even the protanopia filter looks shockingly different to me. Maybe I'm not as deficient as I thought, because I'm just able to see massive differences in what I see on the screen to what is real to my eyes.  I went ahead though and downloaded another. A free one. CVSimulator. You can upload pictures from your photo library as well. It's a bit older and sort of clunky, but it's effective. That's where I see more similarity. It's hard for me to tell certain things are different, but I still see red as a lot different than the app says I should be with this CVD. Still, I had a sad moment when my girlfriend thought she was looking at the deuteranope filter, and she said, ""Oh thank god you don't have this, it's so incredibly sad."" Turns out she was looking at the protanope filter. She didn't mean to do that obviously, she would never ever say something like that on purpose, but still stings.  Tangent. After I spent the day playing around with the apps, I went back online and took the 100 hue test. I dunno if you've done it before, but a score of ""approximately 70 or over"" states that you have some sort of colorblindness. I had my girlfriend take it at the same time, she of course finished in 5 minutes while I took closer to 20. I scored a 64. Definitely up there, but not as poor as I figured I would, actually a whole lot better. I have a feeling that I'm certainly worse off than the test is letting on, but maybe it's not by much.   You're right that it's a bummer not being able to see everything you know you ""should"" (even though normal vision humans still only see a tiny bit of the color spectrum). It's hard for me to be okay with it. But I'm glad you're able to move forward and be secure with yourself.  I'm not sure about the procedure someday, gene therapy is verboten right now, but I went ahead and bought the damned glasses last night. I hope someday a contact lens will be available, but until then, I've at least got something."

Ideally the blocks would have slightly different outlines.  Puyo puyo is the game I have the most colorblind trouble with, and the best solution I've ever seen was a mode where the blocks were modified to be SHAPED like the first letter of the color they were supposed to be. That outline hinting made it so I didn't even have to think consciously about it anymore, which made it way easier to play properly (usually I just throw all the green/yellow blocks in a pile and hope for a lucky combo)."

It's not really a spectrum shift though, we are seeing less colours on a narrower spectrum due to deficient/missing cones.  We are able to pick out certain things that others would have trouble with, but its more a side effect of having a decreased colour-perception. Think of it as being able to pick out the outlines/base better because there is less 'noise' obscuring the source.

ColorBlind,2x09wg,Unuhi,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:18:51 2015 UTC,"trichromat here. Old orange is lighter? As a matter of semantics, I feel that 'brightness' is a combination of greater color saturation AND a lack of black, but I feel the amount of whiteness doesn't matter. In the context of your laundry and worn clothing, the bottom could be a washed-out version of the same garment, and I think that may make it tempting to call the new one brighter. Either that or brightness is strictly color saturation in your definition and then you'd be right (in my eyes)."
ColorBlind,2x09wg,saohesc,2,Thu Feb 26 02:13:02 2015 UTC,The new one looks lighter to me.  But your comment has made me wonder how I judge what lightness is.
ColorBlind,2x09wg,distavo,1 point,Thu Feb 26 02:16:36 2015 UTC,"I had an early exposure to color theory. But that doesn't make me immune to the common bias in our perception created by expecting things I know to be 'in shadow' to appear darker than I'm seeing them. Brain auto-adjusts to make it look lighter and such. Perception extremely unreliable. I think of lightness as stuff that has lots of white mixed in, but I could imagine it being just intuited as whatever ""pops"" the most."
ColorBlind,2x09wg,saohesc,2,Thu Feb 26 04:21:07 2015 UTC,"The top one is more reddish, it seems more vivid/saturated, that's why it looks lighter. We are not good comparing the brightness of different colours. That's why you are able to do it while others don't. To you, they're probably in fact the same colour (hue)."
ColorBlind,2x09wg,ruifon,1 point,Sat Feb 28 14:35:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe normative color perception has a better ability to distinguish light from bright.  I think often, our deficiencies in rods and cones make the vocabulary required for a discussion of this hard to grasp."

So the safe colourset is orange/blue, that's distinguishable by all common types (not full achromatopisa, but you would need to use somethign else in addition to colour to reach them).  Six colours is really pushing the limit of what you can do with one standard colourset, but you can just about get away with it if you use light blue, dark blue, light orange, dark orange, white, and black.  Example below, try running through color oracle for deut/prot/trit, it's not 100% optimal for any of them but it should be usable for them all, if you really can only include one general scheme then something like this would be what to go for:  http://s11.postimg.org/srhxhp5oj/colours.jpg  Anyone else have thoughts on these colours?"

However, if you buy our eyewear through one of our OD retailers, even in plano (no Rx correction), and you purchase them on the doctor's recommendation as a therapeutic device for a medical condition then they ought to be covered.

ColorBlind,2vand4,GooglesYourShit,4,Mon Feb 9 13:29:25 2015 UTC,"Having a set of default colorschemes is a fantastic idea. Oftentimes, however, I can ""get by"" with most of the colors on an existing color palette, but two specific colors will trip me up, like blue and purple. In that event, I, as the user, would only need to change one or two colors out of the eight to something I can differentiate more easily. That wouldn't take much time at all."

ColorBlind,2vand4,My_usrname_of_choice,2,Mon Feb 9 15:31:48 2015 UTC,"On mobile, so I won't be much help, but the key is to find bright and obvious colors, starting with primary colors.  Bright fire truck red, bright yellow and blue.  Don't use ""rose petal red"" or ""offset navy blue indigo"".  Keep it obvious, bright, etc.    You can do it with other colors too, but the key is to make sure they are all very bright in their own spectrum so we can tell them apart.  For me, that means purple is a no go.  I can't tell if it's some sort of weird shade of blue or red.  Also greens and Browns can we close, yellows and oranges, etc.  you've got to keep the colors ridiculously bright and ""obvious"" as to what they are.  Colors like ""red with a touch of orange"" are not going to work, especially with an orange game piece.  Hell, even dark brown and muffled red kind of blend to me.  I want freakin' fire engine hot rod red, and deep in the forest look at the tree trunks brown.  Then I'd be able to tell them apart safely and not get frustrated by it.    Also, don't forget about black, white, and possibly grey, so long as its a grey that is right in the middle between black and white.  If we can tell those apart from each other (light grey and off white can be tough though), then you can add in the primary colors as well, and that gives you 6 colors to go off of."
ColorBlind,2vand4,aywwts4,2,Mon Feb 9 13:08:27 2015 UTC,so this extreme example would be ok?   even dark brown and muffled red kind of blend to me   those are difficult even for me.

People who are fully colorblind won't be able to handle anything that doesn't survive a photo copier, and even red green people may have issues with 8 unique colors.

My thesis is focused on color vision deficiencies and all methods of its management. I know that in reference to the color vision and filters the word ""correction"" is not the best (due to possible misinterpretation of the effect they provide). But in my work I'm also partially covering future possibilities of the actual treatment of the CVDs (gene therapy) and because of that I've chosen this title. About the FDA regulation, yes, I know about it and I’ve already read it. As a matter of fact I've mentioned it in the introduction so no one could be misled into thinking that the congenital color deficiency can be treated at the present time. ;)  In my thesis I’m trying to review products that claim to be an aid or “cure” to CVD. I’m trying to take everything I can find about one so I can sufficiently present it. I want to present well-found information and not only promotional claims so I’m trying to get as many valid data as I can get. Unfortunately the most of the valid scientific evidence is not publicly obtainable. And that’s a reason why I was seeking for more information from various resources."
ColorBlind,2up154,elcardo,7,Tue Feb 3 23:45:32 2015 UTC,"The inability to express what you see the first time you see the world in color is frustrating. Even after almost two years of wearing mine I'm still astounded by the world.  I do believe there is some carrying over. I now recognize certain colors I know would be more vivid with the glasses. I seem to be able to see more things in bushes and tree, i. e., berries, flowers, fruits. And, once, just once, I had a dream where a blanket was the same purple I see when I wear my glasses. I have never been aware of color in my dreams before, and the appearance of it was so astounding, it woke me up. Purple!  I don't think that would have happened without the glasses.   It's also made me a little more militant about being screwed over by being color blind. If we compose 8 percent of the population, why aren't the traffic lights made so we can see them? Why aren't these covered by insurance? This isn't right. Good for the glasses to show me the disparity.  I love mine, and will probably buy another pair when they're cheaper."

After wearing mine for a while I think my mind is tricking me into seeing some things the way they should be now that I know what color they are. Take stop signs for example: now that I know what type of red they are, I see that red when I look at a stop sign since I know that it is a stop sign. If you were to cut a piece of that stop sign off and put it in front of me without the glasses I have a feeling that I would likely not see it the same since I would not associate it with the octogon and big STOP on it.

This one's very wide, encompassing most of the orange and the green's.  They look like various shades of yellow to me.  The very dark green ones look more brownish.    The next band of colors is difficult for me to describe.  It encompasses the turquoise, teal, cyan, aqua, etc.  It's almost just gray to me.  I can't put my finger on any color, really.

I have had mine for a year now and have mixed reviews. They make a huge difference in my driving, the green signs and lights look much different (traffic lights look green instead of white now!). A lot of people claim that they are just a filter, but that is not true since the white lights remain white while green turns green to me now.   Everything else looks much deeper and richer in color too. The Reds really turn red, but I generally saw red decent before, and the blues are a good dark blue. I feel like I notice purple things a lot more now because I still catch myself doing a double take at some flowers or cars which I would never do before. The colors don't all look new to me, but there is something about them that draws my attention to them  that I didn't do before.   They work the best for me in late afternoon on clear days when the sun is behind me and lighting up everything in front of me at a lower angle. At these times the world looks very different to me. Almost like I am in a HDR image if you are familiar with those.   My honest review is that I am glad I got them, but I would likely not replace them if I broke or lost them. Not for their current price at least. You can get a great pair of Maui jims for half the price and those lenses are pretty amazing too for other reasons.   Enchroma does allow a 30 day trial which might be worth it if you are seriously considering buying, but probably not if you aren't. I would hate to lose something like that and be forced to buy."

ColorBlind,2uaeob,KisslessVirginLoser,6,Sat Jan 31 08:07:36 2015 UTC,"You can try the glasses out. If they work, you have protanomaly, if not, protanopia.  The only other ways I know of telling are doing in-person high sensitivity tests, or genetic testing.  En Chroma was very good about getting me a refund when I tried it out and it didn't work for me, after getting a similar result from their test."
ColorBlind,2uaeob,h2g2Ben,2,Sat Jan 31 12:13:26 2015 UTC,How do I know if I have red colorblindness or green colorblindness? They seem to be similar.
ColorBlind,2uaeob,h2g2Ben,4,Sat Jan 31 12:35:11 2015 UTC,"There are two main types of red-green color blindness: protan and deuteran types. Protan types effect the long wavelength cones, and you have one of these types: either protanomaly - a malfunctioning long-wavelength cones, or protanopia - the absence of long-wavelength cones.  All of protanomaly, protanopia, deuteranomaly, and deuteranopia are called forms of red-green colorblindness. They are not referred to as ""red colorblindness"" or ""green colorblindness"".  EDIT: I'll add that if you have a protan-type colorblindness, the issue is with your long-wavelength cones, or L-cones. They are very rarely referred to as ""red cones"" because they have the strongest response to colors in the red part of the spectrum, but L-cones are the better term, because cones overlap in the parts of the spectrum they respond to. Without that overlap, color vision wouldn't work."
ColorBlind,2uaeob,h2g2Ben,2,Sat Jan 31 12:47:15 2015 UTC,Are there different levels of protanomaly? Can someone have it worse than someone else? What about protanopia? Do protanopes all see the same thing?
ColorBlind,2uaeob,Cobrand,2,Sun Feb 1 02:32:24 2015 UTC,"Are there different levels of protanomaly?    Presumably. I think there are multiple mutations that can cause protanomaly, but I don't know to what extent the differences have been quantified.    Can someone have it worse than someone else?    Again, presumably. But I don't know of any detailed research in the area.   What about protanopia? Do protanopes all see the same thing?   For all intents and purposes, yes. All protanopes would see the same thing. Assuming, you know, that we can ever really understand how someone perceives color in relation to another person."
ColorBlind,2uaeob,EnChroma,1 point,Sun Feb 1 05:50:57 2015 UTC,"My parents thought I needed glasses because I kept confusing colors. They took me to the optometrist and they said that I was colorblind. If I recall correctly, they said something about the color red and it being pretty severe. That's all I remember.  Basically, how can I know if my red cone is simply deficient or entirely missing (protanomaly or protanopia)? I confuse red with brown, yellow with green, gray with pink, blue with violet, mauve, pink, etc. (I just call them ""the blues""), some oranges with yellow, some oranges with red, beige with green, etc."
ColorBlind,2uaeob,johncizzle,1 point,Sat Jan 31 08:20:33 2015 UTC,"I have exactly the same thing : confusing red with brown, red with orange, yellow with green, ... all you said, really.  Honestly this sucks on a daily basis : you can't really see every color on the spectrum. But do you really needs glasses ? I mean, I've never tested this kind of things but I don't think it's an absolute necessity unless your job/studies have to do with colours."
ColorBlind,2uafyy,KisslessVirginLoser,3,Sat Jan 31 08:29:53 2015 UTC,"Hm... They really are beautiful. Not sure if like how they draw them, though. Yes, I see all the colours from red to violet, but some ""stripes"" seem wider than the others. Also, there's a continuous gradient between colours. It's not like yellow stops at exactly this point, and then it's green; there are all the shades between yellow and green thrown in between, but what we focus on are red, orange, yellow, etc. so I guess that's why they're drawn that way. Also, the edges are indeed blurry.  tl;dr: it's beautiful, we see different colours, it is blurry."

Red and blue-violet not so much.  I will have to wear my EnChromas next time, especially if the sun and rainbow are both bright."

We don't need apps catered directly to us, we just want the apps we already have to implement friendly colours and options.   If you're making an app, do something else to make it stand out, don't market it directly at the colour blind population."
ColorBlind,2u28rh,My_usrname_of_choice,3,Thu Jan 29 08:05:25 2015 UTC,We are doing it for school and our task was to design a weather app aimed at a specific group of people. We thought that picking a group of people who see differently would be an interesting way to get creative with the design. This is why we are asking for opinions on the design solutions. What would you suggest about friendly colours and options apart from not putting colors that you don't differentiate together? What color combination looks nice from your point of view for example?
ColorBlind,2u28rh,automatton,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:15:19 2015 UTC,"Re: friendly colors -- the most important thing in terms of differentiation is often the value of the colors, ie how much black is in the color. For example a pale green won't be too hard to tell apart from a crimson or scarlet type of red. Aim for contrast in value.

They are for showing non-colorblind blind the difference between what they see and what we see.  Of course we're going to see a difference between the two sides.  It's because there is a difference.  We're just seeing the different side differently that someone who's not CVD.  Make any sense?

That would be good public safety policy and is indeed a matter for the state roads authority and legislature to address.  It's also the responsibility of  each driver to ensure that they are driving safely and following the rules. If you cannot reliably distinguish between a warning light and a stop light, the correct thing to do is to stop. Not doing so is actively putting other road users in danger.  If you make the argument that you shouldn't be held responsible even though you made the choice to drive and acted in a way that causes danger, having the judge chew you out should not be a surprise."
ColorBlind,2tuon5,swenty,14,Tue Jan 27 18:48:33 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. The judge was definitely right. Maybe they handled it poorly but if you can't see traffic lights, you shouldn't be expected to use them at all. You put yours and others' lives at risk and used colourblindness as excuse"
ColorBlind,2tuon5,My_usrname_of_choice,3,Tue Jan 27 18:58:39 2015 UTC,What's your suggestion? All CVD people should be denied drivers licenses?
ColorBlind,2tuon5,colorblindme,0,Wed Jan 28 19:43:43 2015 UTC,"If they can't see traffic lights, yes. If course yes. You can't be a pilot if you can't distinguish between coloured lights"

ColorBlind,2tuon5,nawkuh,5,Tue Jan 27 19:13:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. Being colorblind is MY problem, not the state. People who are nearsighted wear glasses to drive, and colorblinds learn how to be extra cautious  concerning traffic lights."
ColorBlind,2tuon5,J_Cant_Box,-4,Tue Jan 27 22:56:33 2015 UTC,So people who have to use a wheelchair shouldn't ask for the state to provide them with ramps to get into buildings? They should just learn how to use the stairs?
ColorBlind,2tuon5,My_usrname_of_choice,5,Tue Jan 27 23:06:25 2015 UTC,"That's a matter of accessibility. People in wheelchairs don't use their disability as an excuse for speeding, or shoplifting."
ColorBlind,2tuon5,J_Cant_Box,-2,Wed Jan 28 00:41:46 2015 UTC,And I want to be able to access roads safely. I'm not using it as an excuse to break the law when I don't feel like stopping at a red light I'm saying that the state should provide me with the ability to see which light is flashing by having street lights in the intersection much like a person in a wheelchair wants the ability to enter a building by having ramps installed. How is this not a matter of safe accesibility?
ColorBlind,2tuon5,CoachDuder,1 point,Wed Jan 28 03:15:22 2015 UTC,"People use wheelchairs when they are incapable of using their legs. That's why society provides wheelchair ramps for them. People who only have a limp learn to cautiously take the stairs one at a time. People who are incapable of using their eyes do not drive. They use the services society has provided for them as transportation. Colorblinds only have a minor visual difficiency, so they learn to cautiously judge traffic lights."
ColorBlind,2tuon5,colorblindme,-1,Wed Jan 28 05:17:26 2015 UTC,Okay how about this comparison. Again I will be using hyperbole to illustrate a point so bear with me. When a child has a mild hearing disability does that mean that they should be expected to hear everything the teacher says the first time they say it? No. Sometimes they are going to have to have the teacher repeat a few things. By your logic only the students who are completely deaf should have accommodations made for them and the student who has a minor disability should be left in the dark.
ColorBlind,2tuon5,CoachDuder,1 point,Wed Jan 28 08:31:29 2015 UTC,"Are you using hyperbole or just making an asinine comparison between your colorblindness and someone in a wheelchair and accessibility? The ADA considers someone in a wheelchair as disabled; they do not consider colorblindness a disability. I've only been in one scenario where I claimed it as a disability, and that was when I was in school and had to take classes that dealt with color-coded wire. Even a stop light isn't too hard to figure out for most colorblind people. I stop unless I know absolutely for sure what position the light is in. If it's the middle light and I stop, I may piss off the person behind me, but I'd rather err on the side of caution than risk an accident."
ColorBlind,2tuon5,dermballs,-1,Wed Jan 28 06:33:04 2015 UTC,"I am using hyperbole Sherlock, I'm not trying to claim that a mild deficiency such as color blindness is anywhere near as severe a disability as being confined to a wheelchair. That being said, although the ADA fails to consider color blindness a disability the actual definition of disability is ""a physical or mental condition that limits a person's movements, senses, or activities."" Last time I checked sight is a sense and thus would fall under this category. Due to the fact that it IS a disability as defined by the definition of this word I don't feel like it is an unreasonable request to have lights accommodating the 8% of the population that has this deficiency."
ColorBlind,2tuon5,CaptainColeslaw,3,Wed Jan 28 08:19:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. In some countries you cannot get a drivers license if you are CVD.

ColorBlind,2tuon5,CaptainColeslaw,3,Wed Jan 28 15:55:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If he got ticketed for holding up traffic and not proceeding when this happened I might of sided with OP. He was cautious, not presumptuous but he basically told the Judge that due to his colorblindness he is unable to follow the rules of the road and because of this he should be exempt from them. The judge is right in saying he should have his license revoked under those conditions.  Don't get me wrong, I think the lights should be easier to distinguish. In Ireland I can tell the lights by their position and I think they should rethink a design that makes it easier for the colorblind but until that happens it is up to the colorblind to do the right thing, until the state decides to do the right thing."
ColorBlind,2tuon5,anamnesisplease,0,Wed Jan 28 08:10:17 2015 UTC,"I believed that it was yellow and it is not like I just blew through the intersection without looking. I treated it like a flashing yellow, which means slow down and proceed with caution, because that is what I believed it was. In the future I will definitely stop if I have to think about it even a little bit but at the same time I believe that the government should be providing at least proper lighting in intersections or adding symbols into the light for a very common, usually mild, disability."
ColorBlind,2tuon5,TheEmpiresBeer,1 point,Tue Jan 27 22:59:38 2015 UTC,Seems strange that the flashing red wasn't accompanied by a stop sign. What state are you in?

ColorBlind,2tuon5,colorblindme,11,Wed Jan 28 03:27:39 2015 UTC,This is why colorblind people should demand more from the ADA. You could have been killed because Those In Charge are using colored symbols that 8% of the population can't accurately interpret. There's no reason red has to be used other than custom.
ColorBlind,2tuon5,EnChroma,6,Tue Jan 27 17:43:39 2015 UTC,"Is colorblindness even recognized by the ADA? In reading their FAQs it doesn't look like legally it is ""substantially limiting"" enough to fall under the law unfortunately. I mean, a change to the flashing lights would be super nice (maybe at least two flashers right next to each other on red?), but the biggest public issue I see over and over is as simple as public transit maps."

As a fellow strong deutan, every one of the real life examples you gave rang true (""I don't know, a color?"" gave me a particular chuckle).  In regards to color persistence, I'm beginning to think that all colorblind people (and even color normals, to a lesser extent) experience this effect. I've noticed that my mind actively adjusts the colors and contrasts I see based on all information it receives, not just information from the visual cortex. So when I can't see the difference between two colors at first, but then either A: figure out the difference, or B: am told the difference, suddenly the difference between the two becomes sharper and I can see it even at a glance. It's like my brain knows I'm colorblind so it supplements its image of my world based on non-visual data."

You are correct.  This effect affects all humans.  The effect is at its strongest in conditions that are suboptimal for color vision, so your brain relies on inference and memory more heavily."
ColorBlind,2thc51,isionous,3,Mon Jan 26 18:32:19 2015 UTC,"You must be on the west coast if you can drop by their offices.  I wish I could do that as I'd love to discuss the science behind the glasses.  So persistence.  It is exactly like your chair example, except outside.  The glasses I have only work in strong sunlight.  I have heard they are just now selling lens blanks for regular glasses.  Stuff to ask them when you visit.  But, yes, it probably won't help you differentiate between similar colors indoors.  I even tried the Ishihara test near a bright sunny window.  No dice.  Maybe color blindness also means poor differentiation when colors are mushed together?  As for wearing them all the time I found it hard at first.  You don't instantly see better, it's more a learning thing.  The retina is the faulty link in the chain.  It takes some time for the brain to process the new input from retinas that are now delivering new signals.  It can also be a little unsettling when you live in a world of comfortable muted colors and the glasses make everything a carnival.  Color normals are used to these bright colors.  At first it looked like nursery school toy colors.  Indoors is duller for everyone, even the color normals.  As light dims (think twilight) color lessens to the point where everything is essentially black and white.  At this point you are only seeing with rods and they don't see color.  This is my long-winded way of saying the glasses I have don't work indoors.  I do vote for trying the glasses at sunset.  I have to try that. :)  Good luck!"

Colors, without the glasses on, seem much brighter and more distinct than they used to before I got the EnChroma glasses. It is kind of weirding me out.   I saw a new-to-me distinct shade of aqua during my first day with the glasses and now I can see it without the glasses on.   I've read comments on neuroplasticity.

ColorBlind,2tbdgn,rbemrose,3,Thu Jan 22 23:25:23 2015 UTC,"I guess my point is that this probably makes perfect sense to people without CVD based on color alone. As individuals with CVD, whether we can actually distinguish the hues here is immaterial. Because we know we have CVD, we are less likely to register/rely on the color based indicators, which is probably why you consider them to be secondary. The crux of my argument is that by conveying information using multiple indicators, you can circumvent the CVD accessibility issues that plague so many examples of data visualization."
ColorBlind,2tbdgn,Deadeye00,3,Fri Jan 23 01:09:57 2015 UTC,"It does help people read it.  For a lot of people, identifying a color (or more importantly, recalling the concept associated with that color) is a much faster mental operation than decoding a symbol.  Mentally, most people are conditioned to see green and think ""OK"", or see red and think ""caution"".  You may need to read the chart to understand what those concepts mean the first time, but for a subsequent lookup the color is associated with the correct concept - you don't even need to engage the language part of your brain.  The letters are present because they are unambiguous, and because they do engage your language center, which is important for initial understanding (and why a legend with just colors and no labels is much harder to figure out initially).  Finally, whether you think of the color or the symbol as the primary indicator, the presence of the other helps reinforce it, which improves the accuracy of reading.  This is an excellent chart."

As far as playing video games, the only game that gave me problems sometimes is battlefield 3. It was nothing serious. I see colors just fine, I just confuse really light orange, and really light green. They used these colors for you minimap. Green was your squad, light blue was your other team members, and the orangish red was the enemy. I would really notice it unless I was in my zone. Like it would take me a split second longer to distinguish between the green or orange. Other games I've never really had a problem with though.  If a game designer wants to make a game colorblind friendly, they should just put an option scheme in where it changes the colors to something that they'd be able to differentiate.

What it does is it manipulates the wavelength of the colors so that it makes it easier for the person to distinguish. Literally that's all it does; you won't see new colors.   On the note of actually being able to see colors as someone without a cone mutation, then it's plausible that this may occur in his lifetime. There's this researcher who managed to give a primate (that's naturally colorblind, I forgot what species) color vision. Like no shit, the animal was seeing colors like a human would. The researcher programmed a virus to ""attack"" the eye and promote the growth of color cones. It's a pretty neat biological experiment, of course. The problem is colorblindness affects like less than 15% of the world, and most people don't know they're colorblind because it doesn't really matter if they are anymore. Traffic lights are the way they are so that even a monochromat (literally zero color vision) can tell whether he needs to stop or go. So with that being said, fixing color blindness isn't an issue because it's something that doesn't affect everyone. Nonetheless, optimism never hurt anyone. I too would like to see a new world."
ColorBlind,2t9fxz,EnChroma,1 point,Thu Jan 22 08:46:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying! I do appreciate your input, but I'm a woman on a mission. :)  We may not have what I'm looking for available yet, I'm just trying to find the best thing I can get him now. Have you personally tried any of the methods out there to try and see more vivid colors?"
ColorBlind,2t9fxz,PhilHit,-1,Thu Jan 22 09:11:05 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is that there is no way to see vivid colors you already can't differentiate from another color. Color blindness is a either a cone mutation or the lack thereof. If I'm missing my green cone, then all the colors that are between the red and blue wavelengths are going to be blurred to make a really weird brown. This is because they are being received by the two good working cones. The enchroma lenses, as I've said before, only shift the wavelengths of the colors so that you can pick up all the wavelengths with your only two good. That's the reason why it's always some really purplish, bright pink color."
ColorBlind,2t9fxz,DLTCorE,3,Thu Jan 22 19:36:14 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly a little confused. The EnChroma lenses specifically only work in Anomolous Trichromatic individuals. So you have to have 3 cones that at least work a little. My Fiance (hopefully) has all 3 cones, just his green cone is weak. From what I understand, the EnChroma lenses block out a certain wavelength of light in order to make the difference between red and green (and other colors) more pronounced. The glasses should not work at all if you only have 2 cones."
ColorBlind,2t9fxz,SteveWannaBe,-2,Thu Jan 22 20:17:24 2015 UTC,"If he has deuteranomaly then he really shouldn't have color problems besides confusing where the green starts to turn orange. We see ours colors just fine. Enchroma lenses are pretty much worthless besides just being able to cheat on the dot test. You won't see any new colors because you can't. Your cones determine what colors you see. Sure he has a weak green cone however that doesn't mean he can't see green. AFAIK, the only time I ever confused my colors is when I'm getting a vision test. I wouldn't buy a pair of enchroma lenses if I were you guys. It won't cure anything and really isn't an important thing to have."

I can't really comment on the others.   deuteranomalous people have varying degrees of their condition or something?   Yes.

Here is something that you must recognize about red/green color blindness - it doesn't mean you can't tell red and green apart.  For instance, I can easily see that a stop sign is not the same color as most shades of green.  There are just some weird shades of green that can look like other colors to me.  Darker greens look like brown and really bright ones look like yellow.  Also, most purples look like blues.  I don't see the green in traffic lights at all.  They just look white.

ColorBlind,2t69ys,SteveWannaBe,2,Sun Feb 8 09:11:55 2015 UTC,"Anything that ends in -nopia means that that your cones are either severely damaged or missing. Since you can tell the difference between vivid red and vivid green, then that means your cones are intact. I too see the same as you, but now here's the issue. You can still tell vivid colors apart but you may very well ha e a cone issue. If it says you're a protonomaly then you may very well be that. Anyone with an -anomaly suffix are known as anomalous trichromats. TRIchromat meaning we have all three of our color cones in tact. So yeah, I don't doubt you telling vivid colors apart, but if you failed the dot test and enchroma is telling you strong protonomaly, then you probably have a color deficiency. At least you're an anomalous trichromat like myself so that's always a plus."

ColorBlind,2t69ys,vanderZwan,2,Wed Jan 21 19:10:09 2015 UTC,"If you have an anomalous trichromat deficiency, then you should be able to tell, at least, the extreme far right, and extreme far left apart. You can still be an anomalous trichromat but can only tell the two vivid ones apart. If you had protanopia then it'd be extremely hard for you to tell. Remember, colorblindness isn't a truly exact thing. There are varying degrees between the deficiencies themselves. For example, say my friend and I are dueteranomaly (our green cone sucks). I'm mild, and he's severe. I can tell all of those colors in that picture you posted apart, but my friend can only tell them apart when you get near the end of either side. He's still deuteranomaly because he can tell between vivid red and vivid green apart. If he had deuteranopia, all the colors that shift towards green would just appear grey to him. Hopefully his makes sense. -anomaly = 3/3 color cones, one is affected. -anopia = you only have 2/3 color cones, you would see grey for the missing color."

Humans are trichromats. That means they have 3 color cones; red, green, and blue. So if you have deuteranomaly, your green cone is mutated. If you have deuteranopia, then your green cone is missing entirely. If you can tell the difference between vivid red and vivid green, then it's safe to say you have deuteranomaly.

I say this because I assume you can tell the difference between the colors in a rainbow; ROYGBV."
ColorBlind,2swbvy,DLTCorE,6,Mon Jan 19 03:31:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think the ""On a scale of 1 to 5, rate how difficult it is for you to discern the colors and objects in this first picture."" part is very effective. I don't know what colors I'm supposed to be seeing. Perhaps you could try something more like Ishihara plates to show differences."
ColorBlind,2swbvy,xelanil,1 point,Mon Jan 19 05:49:40 2015 UTC,"Wildly different colors is what you're supposed to be seeing. If you see uniform colors, you cannot discern them at all - that's a 5. If you can discern between the colors with ease, that's a 1.  I figured this would be a problem and actually spent more than a few minutes thinking about how to phrase that particular question. I went with the one you just saw because that's what sounded best and was most specific. That said, I specifically picked possibly troublesome images (color-wise) - strong contrast between colors, mixing red and green or blue and yellow.  That said, thanks for the feedback - I'll edit it right away. I appreciate it!"
ColorBlind,2swbvy,crazy_family,3,Mon Jan 19 05:54:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, something needs to be changed. I looked at the picture and thought, yup I can see all the colors I can see. Not sure what else I should be seeing."
ColorBlind,2swbvy,SerLaron,1 point,Mon Jan 19 05:58:39 2015 UTC,"I edited the survey, it should now be more specific. It is, however, hard to do something like that because it's near impossible to explain to you a color you don't see. If you have protanopia (like our friend up there), red, green and yellow are just the same to you - so there's no point in asking which is which.  That said, you should be seeing further instructions: if you see more than one color and the difference between them is clear to you, choose a 1. If everything looks the same color, that's a 5.  If you guys have any further problems/feedback, please do tell! I'm here to help, really. My goal is to make something that works well for you guys, but because I'm not colorblind, I can't do it at all without you. Thanks for the help!"
ColorBlind,2swbvy,MechanicalYeti,2,Mon Jan 19 06:11:37 2015 UTC,"If you guys have any further problems/feedback, please do tell!   Well, since you are asking for it :) Assistive technology can be used permanently(like glasses or hearing aids) or sporadically in certain situations (like magnifying lenses). Personally, I will gladly use the later to identify a color (think once or twice a week), but I can't see myself using something like enchroma glasses until they become much more affordable. Maybe you should specify in your question on the first page if you mean a sporadic or a permanent use.  I'm not sure if forest photos are the optimal choice as test images here, as the filtered images look quite unnatural and jarring to me. It just does not look like a scenario were I can imagine using a kind of color vision aid. How about photos that reflect an actual problem that colorblind people face? I'm thinking about spotting a red object against a green background (maybe berries in a bush) or my personal favorite, amber and green LEDs side by side."
ColorBlind,2swbvy,dejoblue,1 point,Mon Jan 19 08:21:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I kind of meant both. That question in particular is meant to survey how many of you guys would be likely to download and use the application. I know some tools already exist, but from what I understand of it, these either suck or are prohibitively expensive (such as the enchroma glasses).  Now, I picked these pictures because they contrasted between problematic colors - I figured I'd probably need more information, so that's where the follow-up survey question in the last page comes from. It's just so that I have a way to reach you guys easily - I will, however, definitely post the following surveys on reddit as well.  I have taken note of your suggestions and will probably implement them in the second survey. Thanks for answering and taking the time to help!  And, again, if any of you have any further problems, feedback or childhood traumas, please feel free to tell. I might not, however, be able to help with that last one."
ColorBlind,2swbvy,dejoblue,1 point,Mon Jan 19 14:27:02 2015 UTC,You could add text boxes to future tests where participants describe what colors they see in the picture. It would take more time to go through the data but I think you'd have more accurate results.
ColorBlind,2swbvy,Wouter10123,1 point,Mon Jan 19 21:18:54 2015 UTC,"More surveys are definitely on my plans. This is just a bunch of preliminary questions to determine whether I will continue (which I probably will) and, more importantly, how I'll continue. It's mostly a data dump to get me on the right way. I intend to work with at least some of you guys all the way through the design process up to the moment when the application is shipped (and, who knows, maybe after that?)"
ColorBlind,2swbvy,Gudeldar,2,Mon Jan 19 22:22:29 2015 UTC,"We cant really rate how well we see the initial colors and object...we do not know what is intended to be shown.  i also think that others far over complicate how disabling colorblindness is to most of us.  We learn to cope so a lot of what you ask is not easily discernible, IE it skews the data that is gathered, because you are asking obvious questions. ... what color is this apple in the apple tree? well it is either red or green... we can figure it out and do it innately from years of knowing and learning the context.  IE most colorblind tools are completely ignorant of what colorblind people actually see and what assists them.  I find myself not using tools most of the time because I am more able to use the context to discern colors than corrected colors.  However, I commend the attempts and the interest and help that you provide for those that find your tools useful.  Cheers!"
ColorBlind,2swbvy,terrSC,1 point,Mon Jan 19 10:42:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured that'd be a problem. Further instructions are in the observations below the question. I understand it's hard to ask ""how do you see this"", but I intentionally picked pictures that contrasted between red and green or yellow and blue, or a mixture of both.  As stated in the observation, rate how different the colors are to you. If you see only one color, you should pick 5. If you see two or more colors and can clearly outline which each of them is, you're looking at a 1. Now, I'm not asking you to say ""this is X color"". I just need to know how hard is it for you to tell the colors apart.  EDIT: I've done quite a bit of research, and came all the way over here to ask you guys these questions because the user experience is what matters most. If your users don't enjoy using the application, it's a bad product. I understand most colorblind tools are ignorant to what you see and/or need, but I'm here in order not to make the same mistake. I've seen a lot of people making bad design decisions because they didn't think of what the experience of their target user base would be - and that ruins applications. It's just like designing a colorblind accessibility tool whose UI is color-based."
ColorBlind,2swbvy,terrSC,2,Mon Jan 19 14:18:57 2015 UTC,"Like I said, thank you for your work. :)  Here is an example:  I have played the games World of Warcraft and WildStar. Both have colorblind options.  They both have specific protanopia and deuteranopia and tritanopia options.  Now being deuteranomolous I can use that option and can see the difference, as in what the artist's intended me to see.  However I always find myself using the Protanopia options because they replace reds with yellows and I can more easily see them.  That is the distinction.  Do you want us to see the objects or do you want us to see the artists intent?   In a game like World of Warcraft or Wildstar where 100ms latency is unplayable, literal split second decisions that can cause failure are made and being able to see objects is paramount.  There is also a bit of psychology involved in that, at least for me personally as a colorblind person, the beauty of an interface or the artistic aesthetic is always going to be lost on me because I inherently do not even consider colors, only objects.  Show me a painting where color is trying to convey some emotion, and I will never get it, even if it is adjusted for me to see the intent because I simply do not appreciate colors in that way.  It is difficult to create such utilities or with colorblind persons in mind, I can tell. Even with bright obvious colors and high contrast in the game WildStar it was incredibly difficult to see important things. World of Warcraft is more muted and natural.  The difference between the two game's color palettes is something to consider in that we as colorblind persons are used to seeing the world as we see it.  What if I changed the way you see red and green? Would you use it? Would you attempt to readjust to it? To clarify, I am not stating I am ""handicapable"", I am stating that I already have a world view of color.  An anecdote:   My brother cut his eye when he was seven years old and had a cornea transplant. Ten years later he was able to have 20/20 vision with a combination of wearing contacts and glasses. One would think that he would be ecstatic about being able to see, but after having a decade of seeing what he saw the way he saw it, it was an imposition. He doesn't ever wear these corrective appliances.  This may also point out that the sooner corrections are made in one's life, the more likely one is to use the tools, get used to them and expect the world to look that way. Is colorblindness obstructive enough to warrant such assistive devices in schools, to be covered by insurance? I doubt it.  Anyway, enough of my rant/lecture.  I hope I did not discourage you. I sincerely appreciate the efforts of anyone looking to assist colorblind persons or any persons with disabilities of any degree.  We are right there with you. Just as frustrated, just as tenacious. Once your utility is complete some will find it useful and it will be a success. Others of us may find it amazing, but will stop using it and go back to seeing the world the way we know.   Cheers!"
ColorBlind,2swbvy,rbemrose,1 point,Mon Jan 19 21:39:53 2015 UTC,"I want to know whether you can discern between the colors or not at all. I don't care what color you're seeing, I just need to know whether you see them or not. Say there's a striped shirt with red and green stripes. I reckon some of you will have problems with that, and my goal here is to show you that 1. it's not yellow/green, red/green or different shades of the same color, 2. which colors are these and to finally make it easy for you to do that.   The difference between the two game's color palettes is something to consider in that we as colorblind persons are used to seeing the world as we see it. What if I changed the way you see red and green? Would you use it? Would you attempt to readjust to it? To clarify, I am not stating I am ""handicapable"", I am stating that I already have a world view of color.   Yeah, you do have a different ""color palette"" (let's say that), does your inability to discern between certain colors affect your quality of life in any way? I'm guessing it does, and even though you cope with it (as I do with hyperhidrosis), you'd probably choose to not be colorblind if you could (as is my case too). I get that it's part of your identity, and that's fine - thing is, wouldn't you like to have the ability to know what is what, just in case?   This may also point out that the sooner corrections are made in one's life, the more likely one is to use the tools, get used to them and expect the world to look that way. Is colorblindness obstructive enough to warrant such assistive devices in schools, to be covered by insurance? I doubt it.   This is actually why there's an age range question in the survey, and I think what you'll find most interesting is that, even though I don't have enough data to deduce anything (so this probably classifies as bad science), age range actually directly correlates to the likelihood that the person will use assistive technology. That means that, at least from the answers I have here, the older a person is, the more likely they are to use assistive tech. Now, that is obviously not to say there's a causation relationship here - correlation does not equal causation. It is, however, most curious, and, in fact, quite the opposite of what you'd expect.  Nevertheless, there seems to be a correlation between age, self-rated colorblindness severity and likelihood of using assistive technology. While it's definitely unsafe to draw definite conclusions with such a small sample, we could theorize that severity and likelihood of using tech are probably closely related. Age and severity could also share a cause relation - hence the age-tech correlation.  Either way, the ""research"" isn't nearly over and I definitely need more data. Speaking of which, if you guys could share this survey everywhere you can, I'd very much appreciate it. It'll definitely speed up the process and make it way more reliable. Thanks for the help and feedback!"

ColorBlind,2srd03,DWsharky,3,Sat Jan 17 20:07:39 2015 UTC,"Yup, regarding the street lights.  Traffic lights tend to orange-red and blue-green, which helps defeat any issues in distinguishing. Also, they're in standard order in the US (to the best of my knowledge).  Areas where color design is a bigger issue: puzzle games. Many of the more prevalent games have color blind modes. A lot use both color and shape to help distinguish.  Maybe check out Color Oracle and Visolve as apps that simulate one or two forms of color blindness."

However traffic lights are often a pain in the ass for me. I live in Vienna and i try to avoid driving at night because i cant tell normal lights from green traffic lights apart when its dark. Streets tend to look like this and i can never say for sure if a green light is a traffic light or just a regular street lamp. Both are just a white glowing dot to to me when they are not directly in front of me.  This gets incresingly difficult in the city center where there are a lot of complex corssroads with many traffic lights and normal lights which all tend to hang over the middle of the road.

However, if the sun is behind me and I approach a light, I cannot tell which light is illuminated. I rely on other context clues in traffic to help out. These clues include the perpendicular road's light position, the crosswalk signals, and the general behavior or traffic around me.   As mentioned in other comments, traffic signs and signals do a good job at using secondary indicators to convey information. Secondary indication is crucial to colorblind accessible design. Never, ever, rely on color alone to convey important information."

I do sometimes have difficulty with yellow versus red, but this is not a problem because if I cant decide...I stop.  I did recently, just two days ago, run into an issue with green lights. I was at a stop and the turn lane to the left of me was given the green arrow to head left. I flashed my eyes forward to look at the signal to see if I could go and for a split second let off the brakes, but then determined I was not able to go. The reason was that there was a street light just behind the slight signal and it was about the same size and white and I almost thought ti was a green light.   As well most lights are top down and left right, red, yellow, green. This is what I caught with the situation above, the white street light was slightly above the green light which was dark as the red light was still lit.  Street signs are generally easy, stop is red octagon and everything else is a shape variation and colored yellow, orange or white.  I did almost fail, I think, my recent drivers license exam two weeks ago as I was unable to tell the colors of the bottom row of dark colored lights.

If you are asking ""how do you know that red is red and green is green?"", the answer is that we* don't. Both look the same. If you are asking ""How do you get by in life if you can't tell red and green apart?"", well, we need secondary cues, like symbols, text or texture. If you are able to operate your app on a black and white display without missing any important information, you can be assured that it is accessible for all persons with color deficiencies.  *Strictly speaking, some don't, for some only some hues of the colors are indistinguishable. For me, the closer red and green hues are to yellow, the harder they are to tell apart, i. e. I can't differentiate between yellowish-green, yellow and amber example. There are also rarer forms of color blindness, up to seeing ony in grey scale."
ColorBlind,2sr2ml,DLTCorE,1 point,Sun Jan 18 18:41:12 2015 UTC,"I know both look the same. I'm asking is what tools that identify colors are practical and useful and which don't work at all.  That said, secondary cues sometimes don't exist - that's where assistive technology comes in. When I asked for what helps you identify colors, I was asking about the kinds of tools and tricks you use - I wasn't implying you can differentiate between them (which is the whole point here).  I've done quite a bit of research on color blindness (guess that's my job right now :P). Now, as for the application itself: it's not supposed to be usable by colorblind users. We actively target you - it's an accessibility application, meant to assist when other options do not."
ColorBlind,2sr2ml,DLTCorE,2,Sun Jan 18 19:01:32 2015 UTC,"OK, sorry I misunderstood you. In my case, until I discovered the aforementioned app yesterday, I didn't use any tools, apart from asking other people.  Enchroma glasses would be an example of assistive technology, I suppose."
ColorBlind,2sr2ml,stubborn_Analyst,2,Sun Jan 18 19:28:00 2015 UTC,"Definitely, they would! The only problem with these is that the cost is really prohibitive (it's what, 500 bucks just for the lenses? And that's if you don't have any other visual deficiency, such as myopia). Besides, depending on the severity of the deficiency (I'm thinking protanopia, deuteranopia and tritanopia might apply - achromatopsia, however, definitely does), it might not work at all."
ColorBlind,2sl87e,Hogan-Dazs,7,Fri Jan 16 03:02:44 2015 UTC,Really bright lime green and yellow have always been a major problem for me. Since green and yellow are next to each other on the spectrum it makes sense.
ColorBlind,2sl87e,BeDunked,6,Fri Jan 16 06:30:04 2015 UTC,What you see is not direct 'data' from your eyes. The way the brain processes colour is a bit more complicated.

ColorBlind,2sl87e,mkomaha,3,Fri Jan 16 23:44:16 2015 UTC,"From a comment in a previous thread:    Neurologically, the human color space has three axes: {light-dark, yellow-blue, red-green}. Every color sensation can be thought of as a point in this three dimensional color space.  People with deuteranopia and protanopia have no red-green axis at all, meaning that they see blues and yellows of various brightnesses and saturations (which includes black/grays/white).  People with deuteranomaly and protanomaly have a compressed red-green axis. So if two stimuli are very far apart on the normal-human red-green axis (like bright red and bright green), they might still be far enough apart for a protanomalous/deuteranomalous person to distinguish them. If two stimuli are close on the normal red-green axis (like dark desaturated green and brown), then the two stimuli might be too close together for a protanomalous/deuteranomalous person to distingiush.   Green and yellow are next to each other on the red-green axis, so particular instances of green and yellow can be too close together for a protanomalous/deuteranomalous person to distinguish."

Many people treat color as if it wasn't a continuous three dimensional space where labels apply to fuzzy and arbitrarily-bounded regions.  They get taught one way or shown one example of a color early in their life, and they vehemently stick to it.  There is no objective and non-arbitrary dividing line between yellow and green, and yet color-normal people will sincerely argue over if some object is ""really yellow"" or ""really green"".  It's against my religion to argue over color labels, so I've been spared quite a few headaches in my life."

ColorBlind,2s8vsz,Pyrite_Pirate,2,Tue Jan 13 04:18:39 2015 UTC,Your red and green cones are supposed to have a specific amount of spectral separation between them. eg here.   Trichromatic Color vision is based on the absolute value of the electrical signal from the red cone minus green. If your cones are not in the expected place spectrally your brain will have a hard time determining differences between some colors and hues because it does not get the right ratio of signal from the cones and the solution is underdetermined.  Gross simplification:  Stronger anomalous trichromacy involves a greater divergence from this expected ratio.

ColorBlind,2rtiwj,beetlefeet,1 point,Fri Jan 9 08:38:22 2015 UTC,"It's not just about the colours themselves, brightness is also affected. So if you have difficulty seeing red, the colour red will actually appear darker, and harder to distinguish from the black background.  In general the best approach is simply to avoid designing in a way that relies on colour alone to communicate information. That means that with one design you've not only addressed all types of colourblindness (including the rare condition where you see no colour), but also people who have combinations of the different types, and other conditions that affect colour vision in different ways, such as sickle cell anaemia, reduced contrast sensitivity, or even just playing outdoors in sunlight.  So as others have mentioned below, using something else too, such as pattern - one side of the hexagon having dots, another having vertical stripes, etc.  That might work for your game, possibly not as you need to be able to have six distinct patterns that can be recognised very quickly on the surface of the little ball.  If using an additional way of distinguishing them doesn't work, then you're back to pallette tweaking. You're a bit stuck for a pallette of six colours, people who see in a reduced pallette can't distinguish that many separate colours.  One approach would be to remove coloiur from the equation, just have different shades of the same colour.. but again, because you have six colours, there probably wouldn't be enough difference between the shades to be able to distinguish them at speed.  So you could go for something inbetween, three shades each of two colours. Three shades of blue and three shades of orange should allow for enough distinction within each colour, and it's easy enough to pick two colours that work for all of the common types of colourblindness - orange and blue.  So light blue, mid blue, dark blue, light orange, mid orange, and dark orange (i.e. brown).  For duet/prot that would appear to be three shades of olive green and three shades of blue. For tritanopia, it would appear to be three shades of turquoise and three shades of pink. Most people in r/colorblind should be able to distinguish the six shades in this mockup:  http://s9.postimg.org/cvbbprn2n/blueorange.png  The other rarer conditions still won't be able to play, you can't reach them without using something like patterns too, but by using these colours you'll be able to reach more players, so it's still something.  There are great simulator apps that you can use to see what the common types look like, and there's even a basic one built into photoshop, hidden under view/proofing modes.  This is a great one, very accurate algorithms, and a free download too: http://www.colororacle.org  More guidance available here:  http://www.gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/ensure-no-essential-information-is-conveyed-by-a-colour-alone"

Yellows kinda do their own thing, and the rest of the world takes on a purple hue. They do hurt my eyes to wear for more than a minute or so at a time, but I like popping them on and off for art and plants.  They are big. They are difficult to carry around, and they scratch easily.  They are pricey, but I don't really regret the purchase. IUt's not perfect vision, but it is great to have a second option. I'm not so frustrated now about colors. I can see roses on a bush from a distance, which is neat, and if I'm unsure if something is reddish or greenish, I can just see if it amplifies or dulls with the glasses.

The only real negative experience I had was that I found out I couldn't be a pilot when I was young, 31 now, but I think nowadays that's not an issue anymore.

I will say though that I used to wonder every now and then if I was just fucking stupid or something but those colorblind tests you can take enforced it was real.  Edit: Forgot to say that from what I've read about the Enchroma glasses they have a purple tint on them which helps distinguish different colors but they do not show you the correct color. For example two pens look the same color to me but with the glasses on I would be able to see they look different but they both now look different from what color I thought they were and what they are supposed to be.

ColorBlind,2pns2g,johncizzle,6,Thu Dec 18 10:30:41 2014 UTC,"A lot of the time, they're genuinely curious.  I've been in that spot plenty of times where somebody points to (for example) a red shirt and says ""What color do you see when you look at this?""  Yeah, it can be annoying, but also a great learning opportunity.  The way I explain is take them back to grade school.  How did you learn originally which color was which?  A teacher pointed at something red, and told you that it was red.  The same thing happened to me.  I saw a color, and I learned that its name was ""red"".  Then I saw another color and I was told it was called ""green"".  That other color looked just like the first color, and maybe it seemed silly to give two different names to the same thing, but I was a small child, and who was I to question my teacher?  So when someone points at something red and says ""What color do you see?"", I have two answers.  The short answer is ""red"".  The longer answer is that it is impossible for me to describe because the concept doesn't translate into words.  While it's very likely we are seeing different colors, the only word I have for describing the color I see is ""red"".  Of course, while I'm willing to play along for a short while, it definitely gets old pretty quickly.  If they annoy me I just start to give intentionally bad or obtuse answers.  ""What does this green thing look like to you?""  ""Olive with jade polka-dots.""  ""What color is the sky?""  ""Plaid."""
ColorBlind,2pns2g,rbemrose,2,Thu Dec 18 10:54:43 2014 UTC,"My family, colorblindness was expected, so they knew what signs to look out for. When I started calling a neighbor's golden retriever green, they knew I was colorblind.  It's interesting to read your story about growing up and not knowing that you were. Thank you for your insight.  If I may ask. How did you realize that you were colorblind?"
ColorBlind,2pns2g,neotecha,3,Thu Dec 18 21:23:38 2014 UTC,"Looking back, all of the signs were there.  Couldn't match clothing. Mistaking the green traffic lights for white.  My best example was playing ball in our large front yard, and I lost the bright red ball in the grass.  I literally could not see it.  When I asked my brother if he'd seen where it went, he looked at me like I'd grown another head, pointed a little way off, and said ""It's right there, stupid.""  At the time, my parents probably just assumed that I wasn't paying attention.  I didn't think much of it.  I had no explanation, and none of us ever thought too much about it.  I'd heard the words ""color blind"" before, but I guess I just assumed it meant you see in black and white, and that definitely wasn't me.  I wasn't officially diagnosed until my junior year of HS, I failed an Air Force ROTC vision test to determine aptitude to be a pilot.  It came as quite the blow because my test scores were all good and I could think of nothing I wanted more at the time.  My parents took me into a follow-up with the optometrist, who gave my condition a name."
ColorBlind,2pns2g,rbemrose,1 point,Fri Dec 19 05:51:53 2014 UTC,"Not OP, but my family didn't realize I was colorblind when I was growing up. I didn't realize until I was in high school. I think the first weird thing I can really remember is that my best friend at the time used to argue with me about what color her father's car was (I always thought it was green, but apparently it was some kind of champagne/tan color). I can remember her making jokes about it then - you know, ""what are you, color blind?"" kind of stuff - but we didn't take it seriously at the time.  Then a few years later I was taking a biology class, and we had a day where we talked a lot about heredity and had different ""activity stations"" related to genetics. A lot of them were color blindness tests, and I failed almost all of them. Although I don't find that it's much of a problem for me in daily life, it was very clear that something wasn't right when all of my classmates could match the little colored yarns in 30 seconds while it took me a minute and a half to not even match them all correctly."

ColorBlind,2pptrj,h2g2Ben,3,Thu Dec 18 21:59:46 2014 UTC,"I don't think it's rare for parents to not know if their kid wasn't tested for it. Kids are really good at developing coping mechanisms.

ColorBlind,2pptrj,h2g2Ben,2,Thu Dec 18 21:23:25 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but to underline this, it's SUPER rare for this to happen. It's usually the result of brain damage, just enough to knock out color perception, but not other parts of the vision processing system."

The Location information lets us know where our audience expands to or if there are people close to the film's home base. Many of the other questions are asking where you spend your time so we can know exactly what mediums might be good avenues for advertisement or asking for help with the film. Age and ethnicity allows us to see if we are only reaching a specific demographic with our survey request.

If I turn my computer at a sideways angle it looks black/blue (apparently the true color) but for the life of me I can't perceive it that way when I look at the image straight on, even if you remove the background.  I noticed color problems starting around age 12 and got formally diagnosed at 17/18 when I needed to get glasses and failed the color vision dot test. My freshman year of college I participated in a research study on colorblindness. My head was strapped into place and I was viewing a large circle surrounded by black, one half red, one half green, separated along a vertical boundary. I had a knob to turn that would change one side of the circle, and I was instructed to do that until the two sides looked identical to me. It somehow mapped out my deficiency and compared my data points to standard curves for protoanomaly and deuteranomaly. All of my data points fell pretty much exactly on a curve, but about equal numbers on each curve. This apparently means that I'm both protoanomalous and deuteranomalous."

We are working on it, and we are having some good results, but it is not as jaw dropping as the sunglasses so far. Odds are you will not be buying them and ditching your EnChroma Cx sunglasses. They are really different products.  Our existing glasses might still work with what you are looking to do though, in terms of daily driving etc. EnChroma Cx sunglasses have a much higher apparent brightness than normal sunglasses because we pass an unusually high level of light in most areas of the spectrum. If a normal grey lens has a 15% transmission it is pretty much 15% across the board. Our lens passes ~40-50% or so in most places, dropping fairly low in some very targeted spots. You are really only blocking UV + some blues for the protection of your eye. I wear them into stores all the time and don't even notice I have them on.   Some people with very strong CVD, particularly Strong Protans, reported that they found them really dark, so ymmv depending on what the physiology of your eye is like, but my recollection is that they were so either dichromats or anomalous cases so severe that the glasses were not enhancing color for them either."

Use whatever color you like, but also use shapes, icons, or position to give the same information."

Honestly, I think this game could benefit from some patterning in its asthetic even when not in colorblind mode. In addition to colors, why not use shapes?

ColorBlind,2ovvd7,AMeadon,7,Wed Dec 10 18:11:42 2014 UTC,"That is the age I found out. Biggest thing is to make sure you make their preschool/daycare and then eventually elementary teachers aware. I was scolded for not learning colors properly by my pre-k teacher (she later apologized) and if that can be avoided I think that is the biggest thing. Other than that, it is not a super debilitating disability and even the more severe cases (such that I have) is not as impacting on daily life once you grow older. It was a pretty easy adjustment once I stopped doing coloring pages and stuff in school. Considering other disabilities you could encounter, this is pretty mild and I'm sure you and your son will easily get through it.  Also, consider taking them to the eye doctor. They obviously have experience with this stuff and typically have Ishahara tests designed for children. This is where it was confirmed for me as a toddler and it turned out I needed glasses anyways so it worked out."
ColorBlind,2ovvd7,mrfollicle,3,Wed Dec 10 18:34:23 2014 UTC,The biggest source of stress about colour blindness for me was teachers scolding me for not being able to tell purple from blue.  After I learned about colour blindness I would make them feel bad for it.  Kids never bothered me.  It was more of a neat thing to them rather than being something to ridicule.
ColorBlind,2ovvd7,Asmordean,2,Wed Dec 10 23:37:38 2014 UTC,"to add to that. bullying was pretty minimal. It seems like little kids like to bully and tease about more apparent and visually obvious things. Seeing as colorblindness doesn't produce an externally visible difference for kids to target.  Your demonstration of concern shows you're already sensitive to it and your son will likely not understand why he sees things differently at this age. What he sees is after all his reality. Help him memorize the colors of things whether he sees them accurately or not. Explain things like deafness, blindness, paraplegia, etc and maybe after some time he will understand his disability in relation. This will also help him in being sensitive to other people's disabilities and only make him a more empathetic person."
ColorBlind,2ovvd7,mrfollicle,2,Wed Dec 10 18:44:42 2014 UTC,"The only time my colorblindness ever manifested as a ""disability"" was when I got old enough to start selecting my own clothes for school.  My mother, who was a manager for a chain of upscale clothing boutiques, was completely mortified when she brought home all of the coolest styles, only to see her son go to school in hideously clashing colors.  Eventually, she came upon a solution.  While she could no longer control what I selected from the drawer each morning, she could control what was in them.  Henceforth, most of my wardrobe consisted of black, white, grays, and navy blue.  It was only years later that I confided to her that the reason I chose such terrible combinations was only about 50% because I couldn't tell.  Another 30% was because I didn't care, and 20% because I knew it would infuriate her.  I was never an easy child to raise."

ColorBlind,2ovvd7,llewesdarb,2,Thu Dec 11 06:17:24 2014 UTC,"After a long hiatus, I took up art again this year. Mostly I do pencil or black and white ink, and I'm terrible with paint anyway (not just from colorblindness; I wouldn't even know how to hold a brush), but there are a few different options available.   Let him paint colorblind. So much of art is based on the artist's perspective anyway, and his will be a unique one (pending the optometrist's results). Be encouraging, and let him know it's okay to paint what he sees rather than stressing about painting things the way they are. Label everything, and buy labeled art supplies. Not every company will label supplies, but I knew Crayola does--one of their executives was secretly colorblind. I don't know if he's the one that thought to label everything, but I love whoever did. I think maybe RoseArt labels as well? Not sure about that one. You would also be surprised at what can be done with the limited palette of Sharpies, but if he wants to paint, focus on that. Let him try digital. Probably later in life, but I guess that depends on when you think he would be ready. It seems like a lot of money to spend upfront, but individual canvases can be pricey as well. The point with digital is that there are programs that can identify colors. I used to have one that used an eye dropper like the one in Paint, but the tool would give a short layout of different colors the dropper was looking at. Sometimes it would give a list of several possible colors, I guess thinking that the individual pixel I clicked was an anomaly in a larger swath. At any rate, it at least have me the ability to name a color when I needed it.   I promise I didn't mean to write so much! Good luck with the optometrist. I hope his eyes are fine, but be sure to let him know being colorblind is okay if they aren't."

My father and uncle are both also colorblind. My mom, while not colorblind, is an artist, as is my my uncle. She paints in bright vibrant colors I can easily see, and he is a big of pen and ink. I loved coloring when I was little (and at almost 23, I still do) and my disability has never really been an issue with appreciating art. I especially love abstract art like Pollack along with many of the Renaissance Masters.   I remember having difficulties distinguishing some crayons when in the box, but once I learned to read the names and could ""test"" them on paper (somehow a purple crayon and blue crayon could be nigh indistinguishable in the box, but once on paper they were more distinct) I never really had much issue with coloring things. The funny thing is, I have issues with Green and Blue, and they are my favorite colors.   The biggest thing I have to say is I don't know what nuances of color I'm missing. Yeah, I know that I am missing some stuff as my boyfriend with almost perfect color acuity often points out when he and I are shopping for clothes, but I'm happy with the art I make and the colors I choose to use.  It's not like your son sees in black and white, he still has a vibrant world surrounding him. He just sees it a bit differently than other people."

Torrenting and wide availability of basically all albums ever make buying digital pretty lame, especially now that every 12 year old and her mom knows how to torrent   edit: my opening line went nowhere but i dont wanna rewrite"

ColorBlind,2n8npb,isionous,5,Tue Nov 25 00:16:18 2014 UTC,"Neurologically, the human color space has three axes: {light-dark, yellow-blue, red-green}.  Every color sensation can be thought of as a point in this three dimensional color space.  People with deuteranopia and protanopia have no red-green axis at all, meaning that they see blues and yellows of various brightnesses and saturations (which includes black/grays/white).  People with deuteranomaly and protanomaly have a compressed red-green axis.  So if two stimuli are very far apart on the normal-human red-green axis (like bright red and bright green), they might still be far enough apart for a protanomalous/deuteranomalous person to distinguish them.  If two stimuli are close on the normal red-green axis (like dark desaturated green and brown), then the two stimuli might be too close together for a protanomalous/deuteranomalous person to distingiush."

Most of us have trouble distinguishing between colours that look very different to most people - which sounds like what your friend is describing.
ColorBlind,2kl3pe,Fifth5Horseman,2,Tue Oct 28 20:44:06 2014 UTC,"That sounds similar to what I have, which is an anomalous trichromacy, which basically means I can see all colors, but some colors not as well/can't distinguish. I have all 3 colors, but I am not as sensitive to certain ones. For me, if a shade blue is even a little grey, I can't distinguish it from grey, and most shades of orange look bright red, and indigo and purple blend together. I can see purple and blue and orange, but I have a hard time telling which is which when they aren't side by side.  A ""true"" color blindness is a [suffix]-chromacy, whereas a ""partial"" colorblindness is a [suffix]-anomoly.   I think your friend has a protanomaly, which is reduced sensativity to red light."

ColorBlind,2k3h6d,awesomemanftw,0,Fri Oct 24 07:00:42 2014 UTC,"Viewing angle:       In display technology parlance, viewing angle is the maximum angle at which a display can be viewed with acceptable visual performance. In a technical context, this angular range is called viewing cone defined by a multitude of viewing directions.  The image may seem garbled, poorly saturated, of poor contrast, blurry or too faint outside the stated viewing angle range, the exact mode of ""failure"" depends on the display type in question. For example, some projection screens reflect more light perpendicular to the screen and less light to the sides, making the screen appear much darker (and sometimes colors distorted) if the viewer is not in front of the screen. Many manufacturers of projection screens thus define the viewing angle as the angle at which the luminance of the image is exactly half of the maximum. With LCD screens, some manufacturers have opted to measure the contrast ratio, and report the viewing angle as the angle where the contrast ratio exceeds 5:1 or 10:1, giving minimally acceptable viewing conditions.  The viewing angle is measured from one direction to the opposite, giving a maximum of 180° for a flat, one-sided screen. Some display devices exhibit different behaviour in horizontal and vertical axis, requiring users and manufacturers to specify maximum usable viewing angles in both directions. Usually the screens are aligned and used to facilitate greater viewing angle in horizontal level, and smaller angle in the vertical level, should the two of them be different in magnitude.

ColorBlind,2jvvka,DryZebra,4,Tue Oct 21 13:14:34 2014 UTC,"You probably have light deuteranomaly.  Color vision deficiencies (such as deuteranomaly) affect much more than just a few particular colors.  If you think of the human color space as having the three axes {light-dark, blue-yellow, red-green}, then you can think of deuteranomaly as shrinking the red-green axis of your color space."
ColorBlind,2jvvka,isionous,2,Tue Oct 21 13:40:43 2014 UTC,"That makes sense, but doesn't explain why red/green gives me absolutely no issues. I've put several greens next to reds and every single time I know which is which. Why is that?"
ColorBlind,2jvvka,TheEmpiresBeer,3,Tue Oct 21 14:19:28 2014 UTC,"Sounds like a light touch of it.  I have similar problems the non red-green colors you listed (lilac and grey, etc). I can see reds and greens just fine too, unless they are super jumbled together (like red flowers in a bush). Even jumbled together I can see them about half of the time if I'm really looking, but then it puts a major strain on my eyes and the colors look like they are ""competing"" with each other, instead of the reds ""popping"" out like what apparently happens with normal eyesight. Do you ""lose"" red flowers when looking at them on a bush? If I'm not specifically staring at a flower to see its redness, then they just sort of blend in with the green around them. Even though if you were to pick the flower and take it away from the bush so it's just the flower on a stem, I would be able to see the red clear as day. Putting a piece of red paper next to a piece of green paper is easy for me to see because of the large swatches of color and the distinct borders, but tear them up and put one small piece of green into a pile of red pieces, then that will be more difficult, especially if there are different shades of red mixed together."
ColorBlind,2jvvka,isionous,3,Tue Oct 21 17:52:19 2014 UTC,"Red and green are at opposite ends of the red-green axis.  If you have deuteranomaly that only lightly compresses the red-green axis, then bright, saturated reds and greens are still ""far apart"" in your color space.  However, if you take green and yellow, they start out much closer together in a normal human color space.  Once we take into account your red-green axis compression, then they can be close enough to each other to cause problems.  And, as with all types of color vision - dark and desaturated colors are harder to tell apart than bright and saturated colors, so you'll have more problems with dark and desaturated colors."

I'm sure the Enchroma people could say more, but the technology is fairly nascent, and you'd need years of data to prove anything."

For example if you have one reactive that turns blue when it reacts and purple when it doesn't, and your colorblidness prevents you from disinguish, it's a pity but it doesn't mean somebody planned it poorly, it's the nature of the chemical reaction.

Well imagine your colour perception is that, how you identify colours is exactly that. As a person with normal colour vision you would use a shape like a triangle to best, lack of a better term, triangulate the colour you're recognising.

Its design and concept are based on the Canadian CADPAT pattern. The pattern is formed of small rectangular pixels of color. In theory, it is a far more effective camouflage than standard uniform patterns because it mimics the dappled textures and rough boundaries found in natural settings. It is also known as the ""digital pattern"" or ""digi-cammies"" because of its micropattern (pixels) rather than the old macropattern (big blobs).

ColorBlind,2ih8gl,NoSeeGreen,2,Thu Nov 20 16:47:21 2014 UTC,"I'd like to preface this: I wrote this in a personal journal when I was in my early 20s and it's obvious from the introspective viewpoint. If you find it interesting, then so be it. Enjoy your life, fellow Redditor. When you can’t see everything clearly, you really don’t put much emphasis on sight. Even when I was younger and didn’t know I was colorblind, I tended to use shapes and textures to define things. The ball was round not red. I didn’t even suspect I was colorblind until high school. Up until then, I didn’t really have too much of a problem. Since I’ve never seen the way the world is colored, I don’t have anything to compare to. I just don’t know any difference. I used to wonder what things really looked like. I used to wonder how the world really looked, through someone else’s eyes. I think being colorblind has been one of the greatest blessings though. I remember the day that I realized that what I was looking at is different than what others see. It’s the same object, but is perceived by two different parties as two different colors. So what else can be perceived as two different things? How do we know what is real if we all see things differently? How do we know that what we see is actually what is really there. If the brain (ok the eyes) can misinterpret our surroundings, what else are we missing. I started asking these questions a few years ago and this is why colorblindness is a bit of a blessing. If I couldn’t experience it first hand, I probably would have a hard time grasping this concept. I wouldn’t like to see grayscale, but a little color deficiency can teach you to open your mind and don’t accept everything as you see them. So objects around me are a different color than I think. Fine. So do certain sounds get filtered as well? How about tastes? Why limit this open thinking to just vision. What if the entire world as you know it, was completely different than you had perceived it? Sounds, touch, everything. Everything you’ve been taught was wrong. You’ve been lucky so far and not noticed but something just doesn’t add up. If you never knew any better, you’d never know any different. So what does it mean? We all interpret the world a little differently. Don’t count on your views to be the correct ones."

Preferably I like Grassy plains, open space and nothing to complex for me to comprehend. However I am screwed in the Ice & Swamp Maps, ""Oh hey I just drove off a cliff or into 2 very tall trees while shooting at what appears to be my teammate.."". I actually play on the red team because I can't tell the difference between blue and purple (the other 2 team colors).  However it is a newer game with high resolution and more up to date settings for colors adjustments.  One game that sucked was EverQuest 2. Not only is it like 10 years old, the settings are like an amateur adjusting warm and cold color settings on Photoshop for the first time. Also you are required to level up through certain zones. I stopped playing at level 20 because everything was the same color even after spending 45 mins adjusting settings.  Also, in regards to quest-like MMO's Wow is actually not too bad. With the multiple quest lines, you have maybe 3 zones tops at a time to level up from. Or you can be like Cartman in South Park and try leveling up by killing low level creatures to avoid certain zones (not as easy with EQ2). While there are a couple places that are hard to look at, the graphics and settings are nice an up to date to help with minor issues you come across.

ColorBlind,2i2sow,dejoblue,3,Thu Oct 2 18:39:27 2014 UTC,"Most working professionals are on a digital medium and use a Wacom or comparable pad and their ""art"" is completely digital.   As far as actually knowing what color something is, one simply uses the color picker tool, the dropper icon, and selects the color they may not recognize, then its rgb or hex number can be used to show where on the color spectrum it is.  When combined with colorblind correction programs and scripts, standardized RGB and HEX color definitions and a plethora of websites with color compatibility matrices, being colorblind only means you cannot personally see the colors. It may seem like extra work or too time consuming but once you start learning what the hex codes, saturation and lightness do then you can start using numbers instead of colors to express yourself.  These tools were not created for colorblind persons, but as a standardization across all media for printing and distribution methods.  Above all else, learning color theory will help a colorblind person far more than normal vision persons who may disregard what the theory concludes as they can simply look at their work and judge it for themselves.  However, normal vision persons that do not follow theory or do it poorly may have inferior results.   I would proffer that we are all colorblind when it comes to what the majority of our work is seen on or at least created on, digital displays. Every display is unique and its settings are set up for each individual user. This means that normal color vision persons have to learn and use color theory in the digital domain exactly the same way a colorblind person would.  I would also note that most non digital media is created digitally. That billboard, that newspaper, that concert flyer, all made in photoshop or otherwise digitally. Knowing the language of printing is far easier when grasping not just color theory but also rgb and hex definitions and it means that you will have the printers do exactly what you wish.  What you see on your display, even if expensive and properly calibrated, means nothing once it goes out into the wild. This means theory and knowledge of the jargon and specific definitions of printers/publishers and digital media is far more valuable than individual vision judgements.  I would also surmise that a colorblind person would have an advantage, as known and common, we are better able to match shades of colors and a lack of hubris where color is concerned means that our work is more likely to be consistent as it is not based on opinion but on literal numbers and color theory facts that is mandatory for us throughout the entire process from creation to print to physical and digital distribution."

The best I can think of is that it looks just like how the normal chip should look. I just don't know what color that is.  If I say it looks brown, you might think it looks like tree bark. If I say red, you might think fire hydrant. If I say green, you might think grass. But it's none of those, yet all of those.   It's a color that I don't know and can't really compare to any other color other than that chip. That being said, both the regular chip and faulty chip look the same. The faulty chip has a darker splotch on it, but just looks like more flavor. Not a completely different colored chip."

It's a horrible edit, but it'll tell you where the boundaries are. Doesn't help that the image is so low res to begin with, though, that probably doesn't help to distinguish the grey from the pink."

ColorBlind,2hm8kd,icantmakeusernames,3,Sat Sep 27 19:05:41 2014 UTC,Thanks for responding!  That's good to know.
ColorBlind,2hm8kd,Quock,5,Sat Sep 27 19:24:30 2014 UTC,"On the other hand, I think there are a number of people who would find it very useful to tag only certain articles of clothing. Colourblind people like me dress mostly in solid colours to make sure things always go alright together. However, there are certain articles like dress clothes or multicoloured shirts/pants, or even ties which it would be great to have this tool for. I think blind people would find it more useful to tag most, if not all of their clothes, but for what I'm describing it would bring the price down quite a bit, I imagine.  In addition, of course I own a smartphone, and I've got some suggestions too. It would be great if users could save outfits (if people complimented matching articles or someone picked it out once) or save notes for certain combinations, like ""your boxers ride up in these jeans,"" or, ""this shirt is extra warm,"" or whatever. Also, if users tracked what articles they were wearing, perhaps they could attach pictures to certain articles, like matching suggestions (because the visual would be more useful than describing the colour or RFID tag)."
ColorBlind,2hm8kd,Dragovic,5,Sat Sep 27 20:48:33 2014 UTC,"No doubt!  The individual RFID's cost me about $0.50 each, plus a couple of cents worth of fabric and 2-3 minutes of stitching. Of course, you need to factor in the costs of selling, packaging, shipping, taxes and everything else. All told, I think they could reach users for about two dollars each. So the $200 figure I gave above would be enough to tag a significant amount of clothing.   Thanks, by the way, it's great to hear how people imagine potentially using the product!"
ColorBlind,2hm8kd,SWaspMale,1 point,Sat Sep 27 20:59:52 2014 UTC,"As someone who can't match clothes, the product sounds really interesting. I'm not super on board with the price though, like the others here.   Here's an idea - perhaps you can create an app that simply identifies the colour of the specific article of clothing instead of having to worry about the tags? I know nothing about app writing, but I'm sure something could be done where you point the camera at a certain colour  and the phone will identify it.It safes you the cost of an ID tag, but might get complicated when you start thinking about multi-coloured shirts.   The bottom line is that dressing is more of a minor hindrance for those who are colour blind. There will always be someone nearby who can identify what matches with what, or what colour a certain article of clothing is. I always wear jeans anyways, and pretty much anything matches jeans."
ColorBlind,2hm8kd,SWaspMale,2,Mon Sep 29 14:36:43 2014 UTC,"Hey Quock!  Thanks for your awesome suggestions. Before using RFID tags, I played around with a bunch of apps that use the phones camera to identify the color of an item. The problem is, honestly, they suck. A camera will only identify color accurately under perfectly neutral lighting, not something that's really achievable in an average bedroom. In a slightly dark room orange will appear brown, for example, or the flash will be triggered and everything will look a strange washed out yellow.   You are 100% correct, this is not a particularly cheap system. RFID prices have collapsed over the last couple of years so it's likely that they'll cost significantly less soon. But, it will always be a niche interest, I'm certainly not suggesting that this is something every colorblind person wants or needs.   Thanks again, Jake"

ColorBlind,2h5elo,r_quest,3,Mon Sep 22 18:31:02 2014 UTC,"Visible, yes, but I think more blue would help.  Making the heat map transition colors more different from each other is what would help us out the most.  Right now, to me at least, the colors used seem too dull too similar in shade to really pop out on a heat map.  With them brighter, and more contrast between them, someone like me could look at the heat map and be able to tell which areas are which more easily.  Just my 2 cents.    Now, for some reason I suck at identifying colors, but it looks like you are going from orange to yellow to blue.  So having more orange on one end, more yellow in the middle, and more blue on the other end, it'd be easier to differentiate.  By ""more"", I mainly mean brighter and more easily discernible from the other colors."

ColorBlind,2h5elo,majorpains,6,Mon Sep 22 19:22:07 2014 UTC,"For me it's worse than the first. It's going from red to yellow to green (I assume?), but the yellow and green aren't discernible to me.

ColorBlind,2h5elo,kent_eh,3,Mon Sep 22 19:49:08 2014 UTC,"Oooooo...either of those work quite well!  The only areas I'd have trouble with are the two transition areas, from red to yellow and from yellow to blue.

The second picture helps fix that problem, but I'm not going to lie, even as a color deficient person, that picture is ""loud"".  It may be too colorful to look professional on a heat map; but that's your call.    Either one would be at least acceptable, in my book.  Hopefully others will chime in.

ColorBlind,2h5elo,Ape1,2,Mon Sep 22 20:10:23 2014 UTC,"Hi! Thanks for the question. It's always nice to see people paying attention to making colorblind-friendly pics.   For a couple of reads, try this and this, which are mostly rants against the default jet/rainbow colormap that some software has.  So, the basic idea is that people can distinguish brightness better than they can hue anyway, so it's almost always a safe bet to turn your image in grayscale and try to judge it there.   If you have data that diverges in two directions, I would recommend having a neutral control in the center (for example white or black), and having two contrasting colors indicate stronger degrees (of association in your case), for example going from blue, to red, to black, would be my advice."

This includes leash removal and red eye reduction, and background cleanup to make the dogs look good online.  Also, they like to post entertaining and funny stuff on Facebook to lighten the mood, because dog rescue can get pretty depressing sometimes.  So I do image mashups for them.  The one in the example is a combination of my dog's head and a stoat that showed up in r/pics.   They posted this recently, and most people think it's great, but about 20 out of 300 commenters pointed out that the color mismatch is awful.  Now, I can see some problems in the image (the dog fur doesn't perfectly align with the stoat fur, and some of my cuts are lumpier and softer than I consider perfect) but I'm not bothered by that because at least I can work on them and judge them to be ""good enough"" or not.  I am bothered by the color comment because in terms of color it looks perfect to me, even on a great display.   The dog's head was originally orange compared to the stoat, because of the lighting of that image, but I actually thought I had totally fixed the problem with color adjustments.   Do any of you do visual editing work, and have you come up with any techniques to protect yourself against color fuckups?  I'm stumped."
ColorBlind,2gy7au,scotty_beams,3,Sat Sep 20 13:37:17 2014 UTC,I don't know what you mean by a great display - if it's not an IPS panel the colors can be quite off. Here is a color comparison between the top and the bottom: http://i.imgur.com/jtnQzz7.jpg
ColorBlind,2gy7au,scotty_beams,3,Sat Sep 20 13:56:12 2014 UTC,"Thank you.  This seems like it could be an interesting 1st step in a procedure I can use to figure out if I'm missing a color problem.   It looks like I can assume this will look like a mismatch because the grey tones of the head are based in red with a low saturation, while the body is blue with a low saturation.  But, is that necessarily an indication that things are going to look wrong?  If you compare different and immediately adjacent parts of the same pelt in the original stoat body image, you also get contrasts like this.  http://i.imgur.com/zTmmvRy.jpg"
ColorBlind,2gy7au,RetepNamenots,2,Sat Sep 20 14:18:26 2014 UTC,"Basically, I wanted you to show that the color ranges are different. There are some areas with higher saturation but especially the red (pink) fur stands out as unnatural. Yellow blends smoothly into the blue, the contrast isn't as high as between blue and red. Another point is that the yellow is a natural color for dogs whereas a pink/red fur can only be achieved with artificial lighting or dyeing.  Pull up the saturation to maximum and you will see the difference between yellow (direct sunlight) and blue (indirect sunlight/shadow) more easily. The head has its own head."

ColorBlind,2gkjmk,mpeskin,5,Wed Sep 17 14:32:37 2014 UTC,The numbers and letters are called hex codes. The first two stand for Red color value. 00 being none FF being the highest. The second two are the green color value. Then the third is the blue color value.   For example blue is #0000FF because blue has no red or green in it.  Purple would be #FF00FF because it is blue and red combined.   Hex codes are used a lot in programming and graphic design because common codes are easier to remember then numerical rgb values.

Try the enchroma test: http://enchroma.com/test/instructions/  edit:  actually I just took that test and my results look almost the same as yours with a score of 80.  My blue side was higher and green side was lower but they are in the same color range.  So I guess that means you have the normal red/green colorblindness aka deuteranomaly.

Distinguishing blue and purple from each other is near impossible.  The same shades of red and green both look exactly the same in some cases.  We have taken many online tests and they all say Deuteranomaly.    Just curious but do you have troubles with greens at all?  I've always assumed protans were just worse with reds but still had trouble with greens, kind of like the opposite of deutans.  edit:  I guess the reason I call it red/green colorblindess is because that's what all the articles called it when I was younger.  For some reason, in my mind, protan and deutan are sub-categories of red/green colorblindness."

ColorBlind,2et7iq,Wodhann,8,Thu Aug 28 10:33:41 2014 UTC,"You probably have a weak form of deuter- or protanomaly. You have a notion of ""green"" and ""red"" and can tell them apart 95% of the time. Had you not taken this test, you could have gone along all your life without ever realizing it, as many people do (there is a reason color vision deficiency was not discovered until 1798).  In fact, most ""color blind"" people are more or less like this. Anomalous trichromats represent and large majority of people affected by color vision deficiency (CVD). These people have three types of cone on their retina, just like people without CVD, but the sensitivy spectrum of one of them is ""shifted"" towards longer or shorter wavelengths (most often, the ""green"" cone is shifted towards the ""red""). The response of two cones are thus largely overlapping and some hues are very hard to distinguish.  Also, don't get fooled by the fact that you can see red and green. CVD affects much more that the vision of the ""faulty"" color. For example, people with deuteranomalia have a hard time discriminating cyan from light blue, blue and purple, purple and indigo...  So, my diagnostic: you're color blind. But it is not the end of the world."

I am unsure if its got to do with my colorblindness or if its what our eyes naturally do to mix the saturation for normal color seeing. Pretty cool though.  Edit: I could also be wrong though... the red saturation could actually be green but to me yellow and blue are the easiest colors to tell apart.... so I doubt it.

For me it is things like having my wife asking me to grab a matching pillowcase for the blue bedspread and coming back with a purple one.  Drawing a face, having my kids point that the skin color has a greenish tint (it made a really good zombie).

For example, if the orange cup is among a bunch of green cups (in my case, red/green)of a similar tone or a bunch of cups of various colors, process of elimination takes over (that one is blue for sure, this one isn't orange, I know that, this other one is transparent, etc.).  The only major difference I've noticed between colorblind people and everyone else is that everyone else will describe one object among others by its color (the orange cup), whereas a colorblind person might say something like ""the cup with the pumpkin on it.""  May I ask why you're writing about a colorblind character? Most people don't know (or won't acknowledge) that they're colorblind, and no one can really tell someone else is colorblind until there's a dispute over what color something is."

I left dirt and crumbs and stuff everywhere. most of it is brown/red/dark colored and on those dark brick red floors I just couldn't do it.  I was labeled as lazy even after explaining my plight.  other things to note, for me anyway, is if my skin is red, like if I were to get slapped, if I were to get say poison ivy, I do not see the redness of the skin.  I just moved into a new house and recently noticed that I have bright green algae growing on my shaded driveway where the water doesn't evaporate quickly. I have been told that it has been there for months, it just wasn't yellow enough for me to notice it, I thought it was just dirt I needed to hose off.  I first noticed definitively that I was colorblind looking at high school class rings. I couldn't tell the difference between an emerald and a ruby.  If it is very dark out, especially during a rainstorm, it is difficult for me to tell what color the stoplight is because I do not use color as a reference but the position of the light to know when to stop or go.

ColorBlind,2elf5l,h2g2Ben,3,Tue Aug 26 11:05:25 2014 UTC,"The other folks here have pretty much nailed it. I liken it to hobbits in the Lord of the Rings series. You know they're hobbits, but you don't really think about it until that one time every chapter when Tolkein mentions that they're short and have hairy feet. The rest of the time they're just characters.  Same with colorblindness. About once a week (as an adult) something will crop up to remind me that I'm color blind: trying to distinguish between green and orange LEDs, trying to match clothing, or trying to determine if I've got sunburn or a rash.   As a kid, it happened a little more often. I'd be coloring more, for one. When you've got a box of 64 crayola crayons, it's virtually impossible for a red-green color blind person to pick out red or green. I would always pick out forrest green, or burnt sienna - things that were off-red and off-green.   Most annoying part of being color blind: the ""what color is this game."" It's red. I refuse to play that game anymore, and instead use an app (Visolve) to show people what the shirt looks like to me. It usually stops the questions."
ColorBlind,2elf5l,Beta_leonis,3,Tue Aug 26 11:39:21 2014 UTC,"The most annoying question (which happens nearly every time I'm outed as a colorblind person) is the ""what color is this"" game.  Other people have mentioned that on this thread, but it really is insulting.  I can't think of another example where it's socially acceptable to make somebody demonstrate their handicap.  (As in:  ""you're dyslexic?  Here, read this!  No, it's okay, I just want to watch you fail what I can do naturally!"")  Second most common/irritating question:  ""How can you drive""?  Even assuming that traffic lights all look the same color to us (they don't), the idea behind that question is that we also can't tell the difference between ""top, middle and bottom"" on a traffic light, or that we can't read the words on a traffic sign.  In fact I had a coworker once who asked me, ""if you're colorblind, then how can you read?""  A manager at the same job wrote me up once for insubordination, when I asked for help on a color-coded work assignment.  Then, when I went in to HR to complain, I was instructed to go take a remedial art class -- ""so that you can finally learn your colors"".  That's the biggest irritation for me -- not the colorblindness itself (since I have no frame of reference), but the constant undercurrent of people treating me like I'm literally stupid because of it."

I don't quite feel like my colorblindness counts as a disability and i usually understand where people are coming from when they start asking what color things are, because the fact that someone can see something entirely different from yourself is something that intrigues people. I've never had anyone do what you said was done to you at work, but that seems like something you could bring higher up and get someone in trouble for because that's like telling a paralyzed person that they should go to a gym so they can learn to walk (though not nearly on the same scale of offensiveness) the point being that it is literally impossible for you to grasp the colors because they are quite literally not there for you"

ColorBlind,2elf5l,opie2,2,Tue Aug 26 08:14:43 2014 UTC,"If you could see colour for a day do you know what you'd want to see first?   It's a common misconception (understandable due to the name of this ""condition"") that color-blind people cannot see color. This is not true. Total color-blindness is extremely rare. Most of us can see most of the colors in the spectrum; we just tend to confuse one for another or have trouble telling some of them apart, depending on a lot of variables.  I'm a middle school art teacher and it has never been a problem for me. I don't tell my kids, and my colleagues don't know (I just don't want to have to deal with the misconceptions); the only time it's potentially an issue is when we do color wheels, but I've gotten pretty good at this with our brands of paint and I just let the kids figure it out. I have managed to identify a few color-blind students over the years (all boys) using the Ishihara test. One of those kids was really devastated to learn that he was color blind, so I told him in confidence that I was and it proved to be great relief for him."

ColorBlind,2elf5l,hes_dead_tired,2,Tue Aug 26 18:55:19 2014 UTC,"Others have had good answers, I'll kick in a few others.  I got into amateur photography a bit. I avoid doing any kind of color correcting in Lightroom. If anything, I tinker with contrast/brightness, curves, etc. But not really with color. I'm afraid I'll skew things to wild. That realization goes back to HS in a media arts class. I had done a digital illustration of a room with wood floors. I showed it to someone who quickly asked why the floors were red.  There is definitely some safety risks. If i'm in a car, sometimes I have trouble discerning a a single signal blinking red light (stop) vs a blinking yellow light (caution). I try to quickly judge intent - if it's not an intersection than it's probably yellow, like in front of a fire station, so I'll slow down and coast through it. Otherwise, I'll stop. I haven't had other drivers honk but I have had my fiancee yell and ask what I'm stopping for. I often ask her before I get to the light ahead of time if I realize it.  ""Is that yellow or red?""  ""What????""  ""The LIGHT! RED OR YELLOW!?""  Traffic lights at night can be tricky sometimes at a distance but on newer lights, the greens end up looking almost white."
ColorBlind,2elf5l,MinkusTheCat,1 point,Tue Aug 26 20:23:42 2014 UTC,"Well, being colorblind doesn't really make my life really challenging, I just have a lot of minor things that give me a hard time. My biggest thing is that at a stoplight the yield and stop color look the same, so I have to memorize the position, which is pretty easy. Unless it's night and I can't see them well enough. But that terrible blinking left arrow that means you can go if it's clear will be my downfall. I'm never 100% sure that the light actually means I can go or not so I'll either have to ask someone else who I'm riding with, or give a educated guess and just go. For many people it's just random things like what I said that screws with them. For most people, being colorblind isn't a serious disability that makes them immediately stick out.

EDIT #2: One thing that really gets me. My wife asked me to grab her red shoes the other day, there was a pink pair that I assumed was them. She had a go because she knows that I can tell the difference. No, I can't. Yes, I might have got it right once before (maybe, I don't know), but the light in the room was different, so they looked red, and next to the many other shoes I saw they looked very red. When she pointed out the red ones she actually wanted sure, I could see that the ones I picked up looked different and I could work out that the colour looked pinkish. But she knows that I sometimes will get it right because I know that what I think is one colour is actually another, I've learned what it's likely to be. So she insisted that I know that what I see as this I know is called something else. But the lighting, and other items near by make a huge difference to what it looks like and what I assume that must actually be. Like the cat example, I know that they are different, but next to each other they look similar."

Also I wear a lot of black, gray, and white clothes so I don't have to try to match every day.  A big one that most people don't seem to realize is that blue is usually our favorite color since it seems so vibrant because we can actually see blue.  Also I don't really get embarrassed from it.  If I need to know the color of something, I will just ask someone nearby and usually they are curious about it anyways.  I've never had someone think I was 'dumber' for being colorblind.  One more thing to note is you would be surprised how many products in stores don't actually say in words what color they are.  Even things like markers or paint,  let alone fabrics and cloth."
ColorBlind,2elf5l,RegressToTheMean,1 point,Tue Aug 26 17:23:58 2014 UTC,"One of the things that poses a challenge are traffic lights. The normal three light lights aren't too bad. The top [or left for sideways lights] are for stopping, middle are caution, and the bottom/right are go. However, I can never tell what a blinking single light is trying to tell me.  I'm somewhat surprised this isn't more of an issue for colorblind folks. I have to treat even all single blinking traffic lights as blinking reds, because I can't tell the difference between the caution and stop lights. I really wish there was a more friendly way to tell because while stopping at a caution isn't as dangerous as a blinking red light, it still increases the likelihood of an accident.  Powerpoint presentations. Business people love to use red and green. There is a business report known as a Stoplight Report that uses red, green, and yellow as status indicators on certain projects.

ColorBlind,2elf5l,truthcopy,1 point,Tue Aug 26 22:28:50 2014 UTC,"How it plays out, and in some cases how much of a problem it is, could depend on age, somewhat. For a kindergarten kid, it's a huge deal that can come with embarrassment and bullying. ""oh, Johnny doesn't know his colors!""  For high school students, coloring cells in biology class can be a challenge.   Matching clothes can be an adventure, but I think most learn to cope and generally don't own a lot of clothes that would make horrendous combinations.   The thing to remember is that color blindness doesn't mean seeing no color. I always describe it in that colors of certain shades are more muted. So when colors are close or subtle, they're hard to tell apart.   Certainly not trying to write anything for you, but is the color blindness central to the story? ""frank, now take the purple pill. No! No! That's the blue one!"" Or is it just a character trait that will be played for laughs?  Here's a story from my life. A few years ago we moved into a house, and my wife told me to put something in the blue room. Now, as far as I knew, all of the walls in the house were white. The subtle color of the walls (at least to me) was lost.   Our walls are boldly colored now."
ColorBlind,2ejxxr,Kelaos,30,Mon Aug 25 18:50:17 2014 UTC,"Honestly, primary colors are a safe bet.  Red, yellow, and blue, so long as the red is dark enough and the yellow is bright enough.  So long as you are just ""bright, boring, kindergarten level red"", you should be fine.  None of this ""auburn"" or ""burgundy"" shit.  Keep it simple.    The real trick is that when colors become closer to each other, they get harder to tell apart.  Lighter red and darker yellow start getting weird for some folks.    You just want the three colors to be as far apart from each other as possible, and you need to remember that a lot of us are red-green color deficient, so it's probably best to keep those away from each other.    We may not be able to technically spot what the color is, but we will be able to tell it apart from the other colors, and that's what is important.

ColorBlind,2ejxxr,KisslessVirginLoser,4,Wed Oct 29 15:52:03 2014 UTC,"First of all, keep in mind the way the brain normally breaks down colors. First pass separates white into blues and yellows, second pass separates yellow into reds and greens. So red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white are the least ambiguous colors.  If you only need three colors and you want them to be as friendly as possible, that's exactly what the additive primaries do best. Red, blue, and yellow are your friends. And it doesn't hurt to choose colors that are even distinct when run through a grayscale filter. When I was little I learned to muddle through most real world red/green problems by trusting brightness over hue.  Also, for shapes, I'm not sure what specific advice to give, other than to say you should check out the aesthetics from the video game Pokemon Puzzle League and the board game Ticket to Ride.

ColorBlind,2e6c4h,SquireCD,6,Sat Aug 23 22:49:21 2014 UTC,"This is tough to answer, at least for me, because the entire condition brings into question — ""what is grey?""  And I don't know that answer because half the time I say something is grey, I am told by someone else it's a different color.   Bright green traffic lights are a particular pain point for me. They're white to me. Just like street lights on the sidewalk. If they were darker color of green, then I'd say they're grey, but they're practically neon, so they look white.   Purples look like blues a lot of the time. I get purple mistaken for blue, and I get dark blues mistaken for purple. I think this is because I used to think purple was just dark blue.   I have trouble with some yellows — I'll mistake them for medium neon green. And vice versa. Think of shirt colors with this one.   Here's the thing. We don't think it looks grey. We're told what we're seeing is grey, but that's not how we think of it. We just mistake colors for other colors.   If you want to get scientific about it, then I guess I see green, browns, and some reds as grey. But, that's only what I'm told. To me, they usually look like some other color, because the idea of ""grey"" has been skewed for us.   edit   I get that some colors are confusing (peanut butter looking same as green)   Wtf. Peanut butter isn't green? I'm asking my wife about this when I get home."

ColorBlind,2ds5u1,RocketPapaya413,158,Sun Aug 17 07:37:49 2014 UTC,"It would work in much the same way as a color blind test would work.   Let's imagine that instead of colors, people saw the numerical value of the wavelength they corresponded to. Let's also imagine that color is as simple as mapping one color to one number (because for the Ishihara Tests, that's pretty much true). And lastly let's imagine that all the relevant colors were represented by the numbers 1-10 (for simplicity).  A normal color blind test works by creating an image using one color and hiding it in a forest of other colors. So it might look like this:  4444444444444444444444444444444444444444 4444455555555555555555555555555555544444 4444455555555555555555555555555555544444 4444455544444444444444444444444455544444 4444455544444444444444444444444455544444 4444455544444444444444444444444455544444 4444455544444444444444444444444455544444 4444455544444444444444444444444455544444 4444455544444444444444444444444455544444 4444455544444444444444444444444455544444 4444455544444444444444444444444455544444 4444455555555555555555555555555555544444 4444455555555555555555555555555555544444 4444444444444444444444444444444444444444    Anyone that can differentiate between 4 and 5 can see the rectangle. Color blindness means (here, at least) not being able to see all the numbers. But they're not invisible either. In this comparison, being color blind might mean that 5s look like 4s. So above, all this fouranope would see is a block of 4s.   But you might have know that already, if you knew how the Ishihara tests work. So how can it be made to only convey the shape or message or what have you to a color blind person? It involves the part where 5s look like 4s. Let's expand on our definition of a fouranope, because in the real world a color blind person isn't afflicted by seeing only one specific wavelength as another. In the real world color blindness effectively takes a whole range of colors and reduces them into one. Or, in terms of our comparison, a fouranope might have 3s and 5s reduce to 4s. Now let's make another block.  12292191298792287899799826279226826216879 27623444335345433545335453345545545348229 29263341986998212627268726281262715442971 26925438718926278962289287162892783352796 27723351981892628296771928127129685348962 81775542289219262891891897982898925459267 12683358962896271298678926899719773437127 96194439961296129612926292962296825532199 21773547177921721772276822792127963349612 79125433554355454355333445453443554347217 89267892677298912161279672716721912179677    As viewed by a color regular, its just a block of numbers.

When someone pointed out the circle to me, I could kinda trace it, but if I looked at it without you telling me there was a circle then I couldn't see it.    If you can clearly see the circle, you are colorblind. I thought there was something wrong with me but when I read about it it said it's created to manipulate the cones in our eyes (because people who are not colorblind are thrown off by the reds). Since you're not, you are colorblind. You might not be completely colorblind, but you don't see red as clearly as those with color normal vision do."

Let me explain. When you invert the colors what you're seeing (as in, a circle plain as day) is what those with protanopia/protanomaly colorblindness see. What you're doing is seeing an extremely faint circle that was outlined to you.    By that standard, no one would be colorblind as even an Isiahara plate with, say, the number 57 would be impossible for me to see at first glance yet if you gave me the number I'd be able to make a faint outline of where it is (similar to you and the circle)."

And you can't legally deny access anywhere to anyone with a service dog. Thus you can take fido with you all the time. I've taken my dog to Walmart, restaurants, hospitals. When they ask I just tell them it's a service dog and when the ask for what or to see it's ""papers"" I just tell them that is none of their concerns and that I don't have to tell them.

The reason for this is that, staring at the orange image for several seconds and then closing one's eyes causes a green negative image to appear. When viewed in this manner, the cover art appears to depict green grass.   It may be an optical illusion for normal folks but it has always looked quite green to me.

Sometimes that is the case but pretty rare.  Most people, me included, have what you have where it's hard to differentiate colors.  Colors that are very similar like blue and light blue are very hard to see the difference, but sometimes other colors can get mixed like when there are red berries in a green bush.  If I look very hard and squint I may be able to pick out the red color in the berries, but for normal vision people it's very obvious (http://www.mlponies.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Leaves-and-Berries-colorblind-simulation.jpg)  (In that image it's not to hard to see the red berries but it is harder than normal vision peeps).  We can however see the color red and green by itself.  I pretty much tell people their rainbow has a lot more colors than mine.  I did buy enchroma glasses last year and they are pretty cool.  You can see normal and the best way to explain it is that colors are a lot more vibrant.  Our eyes (if you have the same colorblindness) see colors a bit washed out as if the sun has faded the colors a bit.  Go here http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/colour-blindness-experience-it/  If the 2 images look the same then you're colorblind.  Show someone else with normal vision and if it's a girl they'll typically go ""aww you can't see the difference, your view is a lot more dull"".

Isolated communities with a restricted gene pool sometimes produce high proportions of color blindness, including the less usual types. Examples include rural Finland, Hungary, and some of the Scottish islands. In the United States, about 7 percent of the male population—or about 10.5 million men—and 0.4 percent of the female population either cannot distinguish red from green, or see red and green differently from how others do (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 2006). More than 95 percent of all variations in human color vision involve the red and green receptors in male eyes. It is very rare for males or females to be ""blind"" to the blue end of the spectrum.

ColorBlind,2bhbem,teddy5,4,Wed Jul 23 13:30:20 2014 UTC,"Hey, would love to help if I can. Some people will have different views with different kinds of colour blindness and if you have a bit of a look through the sub history there will be more advice (and probably better than mine) about how to approach game design for colour blindness.  With your basic tileset I have a quite a problem distinguishing between the yellow/orange/green blocks (I can't tell what the second one is tbh). The red, pink and blue/purple is also an odd combination in that they are 3 colours that could each blend with each other for me. In the first demonstration with red between the other two it seems a bit clearer, but in the pictures of the levels I have a hard time telling.  There are a lot of strategies to finding the right colours that would work and contrast enough, but none of them will work perfectly for everyone because of different varieties in colour vision. An option that might work better, especially for this type of game where a large focus is on the blocks, is to distinguish each colour with a variation in pattern as well.  I don't have an example on hand but the most obvious method would be to place different shapes on the blocks, often times even just reversing the pattern for similar colours or placing minor variations in the pattern would work."
ColorBlind,2bhbem,MechanicalYeti,3,Wed Jul 23 09:50:24 2014 UTC,"I have examples:  Bejeweled, Peggle, Puzzle and Dragon, Tetris Attack, Bubble Shoot.  I think I'll stop there. Personally, the green, yellow, and red (1, 2, and 4) cause me some troubles. Purple and blue, (3 and 5) do as well. As /u/teddy5 said, distinct patterns on blocks is a pretty common way to ensure everyone can tell them apart. It's quite effective as long as they're clear. An example of unclear shapes is Puzzle Bobble. Tetris Attack, above, does this well and has 5 distinct shapes you could use. Additionally, Puzzle and Dragon's colorblind mode, also above, makes the colors more distinct.  I'd like to take a moment to thank you for putting in the effort, too. We really appreciate when developers keep us in mind!"
ColorBlind,2bhbem,MechanicalYeti,2,Wed Jul 23 12:45:55 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your reply and the examples! As stated in my previous comment I don't think that distinct block shapes would work, because they'd break the equally sized/shaped blocks game mechanic. But it could workd to put different shapes inside the blocks, like in the Tetris Attack example! We'll have a look at it!"
ColorBlind,2bhbem,anorexicPanda,3,Wed Jul 23 13:28:16 2014 UTC,Sounds good! Just remember to make the shapes really clear. That's the difference between Tetris Attack and Puzzle Bobble.  Good luck with your game!
ColorBlind,2bhbem,ShillelaghLaw,1 point,Wed Jul 23 13:41:30 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your answer! It proves my fear that some of the blocks are not/bad readable. As you have noticed right now we have the same shape and the same pattern in each block. I am wondering how to mitigate.. I think we cannot change the block shape of the blocks, because that would break the whole game mechanic of equally shaped blocks. That leaves the pattern or texture to change. I'll talk to our artist if the inside of the blocks could have different geometric shapes. Right now there is a rotated rectangle, but we could go with triangles, rectangles, pentagons and so on."

In short, if your boss is a dick, it can be used as grounds for a for-cause termination. I'm on my phone so I can't easily search for it - but there was a story on here maybe a year ago about a graphics designer. He had above average performance reviews, but his employer decided to implement mandatory colorblind testing. He obviously failed, and was terminated after being there for 6 or 7 years. Because it was a for cause termination, he wasn't even eligible for unemployment. So while I definitely consider it a disability, it's not covered by the ADA and not only are employers not required to accommodate you they can terminate you for it."

ColorBlind,2b8swh,dejoblue,2,Mon Jul 21 08:35:49 2014 UTC,"I tend to use the word ""handicap"" over ""disability"" in our case; ""handicap"" being the lesser of the two.  In my personal dictionary, a handicap becomes a disability once it requires special equipment.  Blind people might use a white cane or guide dog.  Paralyzed people might use a wheelchair.  Profoundly Deaf people might not have any equipment, but they have to learn an entirely different form of language in order to communicate.  For us, even though Enchroma glasses exist, we don't need to use them in order to function successfully in 95% of the situations that the world throws at us.  Take away somebody's wheelchair and they might be pretty much screwed.  Take away somebody's Enchromas, if they even had a pair in the first place, they'd probably shrug their shoulders and move on.  Tangent:  I discussed this same concept once with a friend of mine who (incidentally) is a naturalized American citizen originally from Kenya.  Her initial reaction was that I was using the term ""handicap"" to refer to anything that a person just can't do, including things that we haven't learned yet.  At the time, she was one of those people who believed that colorblindness was not a physical deficiency, but an educational oversight -- that we just haven't learned our colors yet.  I corrected her by pointing out that there are a lot of things I can't do.  I can't speak Swahili, which is her native language.  I can't play the clarinet, like her husband can.  But I don't consider either of these to be a handicap, because I could learn either ability, if I wanted to.  OTOH I cannot learn to see colors the same way that she can.  There is a physical deficiency in my eyes that prevents me from doing that.  And for some reason that's a concept that lots of people have trouble understanding (I think, precisely because of the lack of special equipment or accommodation.  If you see somebody wearing dark glasses and carrying a white cane, it's intuitively easy to suss out what's going on there.  It's harder to understand if at least superficially, somebody seems to be using their eyes in the same way as you.)"
ColorBlind,2b8swh,SixLobedHyperCycle,2,Tue Jul 22 16:15:36 2014 UTC,"If you really wanted and put your mind to being a pilot or graphics designer and faced difficulty because of your colourblindness, I think it's fair to call it a disability.   I can't be a pilot but that was only something I wanted to do when I was a kid, I don't really have any interest in that now or feel deprived as an adult about that. I just have to be a little more careful and ask for more clarification on colours. When I did accounting work the person I worked with had a system of using highlighters to differentiate between accounts for the bank reconciliation, I just had to ask her to use a different colour in place of purple (she had a blue and a purple account).  I notice it a bit with being in marketing this year too. I've done some light graphics design work (basic photoshop stuff with the company logos/trademarks) and it's a little tough for me to match the colours at times. The colours of the company logo which I thought were green for the longest time turned out to be shades of brown, I'm just careful to use the eye dropper tool and ask people with normal colour vision to check on it from time to time.  I guess whether or not it's a disability depends on what you want to do and how it impairs your life. I don't feel that it's a disability because it doesn't impact my day to day life, I don't have trouble telling stop lights apart, completing tasks at work, or doing any daily task because of my colourblindness.  Truly the only times I notice it in my daily life is when I'm playing video games (some games with the red/green colour schemes are awful, and sports games can be very tough), when I buy purple clothes because I think they're blue, and when I'm cooking beef. I have trouble cooking ground beef and usually over cook it because I can't see the red in the beef and I err on the side of caution because I've undercooked it before. Same thing with steak, I like mine rare so it doesn't bother me but I can have trouble telling between medium rare/medium/medium well by colour alone."

How it manifests itself depends on other people. For instance, it doesn't limit me in my work unless a manager decides we have to use a spreadsheet which relies on colour alone to distinguish between different work items; only in that type of situation does my disability become an issue.

ColorBlind,2aywmy,thisguy012,5,Thu Jul 17 17:43:48 2014 UTC,"I used to play COD 4 or mw2 and scream at my buddy, ""is that heli friendly?!"" He would respond, ""just look at the color on your mini map."" I'd have to let him that I know how to use my map in just can't tell the difference. So when I played alone I played like every heli was an enemy heli.  Now I play battlefield and their colorblind mode isn't the greatest. But it's fun when people other than my roommates watch me play and they wonder why I'm shooting the guys with green indicators. Colorblind mode changes enemies to neon green and friendlies to blue/blue green. I always though I was shooting at orange indicators."

ColorBlind,2anjby,xerotuone,3,Mon Jul 14 12:21:54 2014 UTC,"I really wish work towards a colorblindness cure/treatment would proceed faster! I'd love to have the opportunity to work on that myself.  It definitely annoys me that are colors my brain is perfectly capable of processing, and yet I have no idea what they look like. I can only visualize colors I've seen before.  I've studied how my particular form of colorblindness works, and the fact that there are colors I have trouble telling apart (green and yellow, blue and purple, dark red and black, etc.) is not the thing that bothers me most. (In fact, it can be rather fun, as a conversation starter and as something that makes me different from most people. I actually enjoy being quizzed on colors.)  What bothers me most is that I have no idea what Green actually looks like, because my L-cones (""red"" cones) have a sensitivity curve shifted towards green, making greens look like yellow to me. (I've adapted to that by telling apart green and yellow by brightness. In real life, green is usually a darker color and yellow is usually brighter. Bright greens and dark yellows break this for me, fooling my adaptation.)  EDIT: Also, I cannot begin to imagine what it'd be like to be able to tell when someone is blushing just by looking at them. I know the feeling blushing creates in my own face when I blush, but I see absolutely no difference in the appearance of the skin. When I can see redness in skin, it's a darkening, not a brightening.  For every other color, I can pretty much ""fake"" what it would look like to a color-normal. For example, red appears dark to me, so I can fake it by brightening all the reds to make them look to me like they would to a color-normal. And purple, I can fake by mixing blue with extra-bright red. Blue and yellow I already see fine as-is. But green? There's no way. The best I could maybe do is pick a spectrally pure color that is closer to blue than ""standard green"" is, but then the problem becomes that my S-cones (""blue"" cones) will start to be stimulated too much by the color, ruining the objective of faking what a pure green looks like (resulting in more of a cyan, instead).  I also tried an experiment: doing a reverse RGB transform on selected digital photos on my computer monitor. This of course results in values less than 0 or greater than 255, so I squeezed the normal range of color, effectively adding a gray ""haze"" to everything (i.e. reducing contrast greatly). If my calculations were correct this should have shown me what a color-normal would see, looking at the monitor through a thick gray haze. I was hoping my brain would adapt to the haze and subtract it away, but this experiment was fruitless; I gained no insight as to how things look to a color normal. Things just looked really dull and gray.  So, I try to imagine what green would look like if I had normal color vision; something cooler than what green actually looks like to me, but with no blue in it. I expect my imagination of it is way off from how it'd really look.  TL;DR: If I could be given normal color vision, it'd be a revelation. I'd feel like a child again, seeing everything in the world as if for the first time. I'd make a point of going everywhere I've ever been before, to see it again as it ""really"" looks."

But the ""green"" I see and identify as green would, to you (if you saw through my eyes), be dark yellow (olive green). In general, any green I see is replaced by a yellow of the same value.

Since there are apparently many kinds of protanomaly, I wouldn't jump to any conclusions about the red I see having more orange in it... but it's a distinct possibility. The green I see is not just yellowish though, it's virtually indistinguishable from yellow (although I can see the difference if the colors are side by side, identical in value, and I look very carefully)."

ColorBlind,2anjby,CarpetPuncher,1 point,Sat Jul 19 13:10:43 2014 UTC,"Tetrachromacy:       Tetrachromacy is the condition of possessing four independent channels for conveying color information, or possessing four different types of cone cells in the eye. Organisms with tetrachromacy are called tetrachromats.  In tetrachromatic organisms, the sensory color space is four-dimensional, meaning that to match the sensory effect of arbitrarily chosen spectra of light within their visible spectrum requires mixtures of at least four different primary colors.  Tetrachromacy is demonstrated among several species of birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles and insects.   It was also the normal condition of most mammals in past evolutions; a genetic change made the majority of species of this class eventually lose two of their four cones.      Image i - The four pigments in a bird's cones (in this example, estrildid finches) extend the range of color vision into the ultraviolet.

ColorBlind,2abhc2,Ape1,5,Sun Jul 27 15:00:21 2014 UTC,"Pastel Color Blindness!!!! MY FIRST FRIEND!!! One of the rare 1% of types of color blind. My doctor actually told me this, I'm not making it up (often not found in definition beyond medical books because it later got categorized into one of the forms of red-green). Essentially it's harder to tell pastel differences (Shades of colors) Purples and Navy Blues and Blacks are hard as well as oranges reds and some greens. It is often similar to deutaranomal CVD.  In older color blindness tests, cards were designed with 3 numbers. Normal vision, a red green number, and a third number for the other  blindnesses. When a 5 is on the card, R-G people will often see a 3, normal vision will see a 5 but pastel and others see an 8 because they make out parts of the 5 but struggle differentiating other colors.  I find it easiest to describe this way: Normal visioned people can see about 100 hues of colors. Red-Green color blind people can only see approximately 20-30 hues. Pastel is like being able to see 50 hues. It's easy to slide by with 50 and never think something is wrong, but once you realize it, there is still a significant noticeable deficiency in determining hues. I can still 100% differentiate a red and a green, but put 2 greens next to each other and they most likely look the same to me.  EDIT: I found this page http://www.color-blindness.com/deuteranopia-red-green-color-blindness/ that helps explain it. The 2 pictures next toe ash other look the same to me, however when someone pointed out the background was a different shade and the foreground was a different shade (variants of green) I struggled very hard to find a difference and could kind of see it, but if it was just me I wouldn't have noticed it."
ColorBlind,2abhc2,BrozoTheClown,3,Fri Jul 11 04:50:00 2014 UTC,"Hi Zoro.  What's likely happening here is a misunderstanding of colorblindness. This is why many people like to use the technical name, Color Vision Deficiency. Being red-green colorblind does not mean you can't differentiate between all shades of red and green, nor does it mean those are the only colors you have trouble with. It means certain shades look similar to you when they don't look similar to a normal-sighted person. Either you have a reduced amount of long-wave/medium-wave cones, depending on which type of red-green, or you are completely lacking one of the two.  If you're unable to see the numbers on the Ishihara plates then you're probably colorblind. Taking tests like the ones on the sidebar can help you determine if you are a Dichromat or Trichromat (missing a type of cone or simply have a reduced amount of one, probably the latter in your case) and if you are a Protan or Deutan (whether the L-cones or M-cones are affected).  However, I would be remiss to not inform you that while this can give you an idea of what type of colorblindness you have, or even if you have it at all. Only your optometrist can tell you for certain, so go to them if you are unsure about if you have it or what kind. Additionally, factors like an incorrectly calibrated monitor can affect the outcome of online tests. Taking these tests from multiple devices can help mitigate this."
ColorBlind,2abhc2,MechanicalYeti,2,Thu Jul 10 13:14:49 2014 UTC,"Yeah color blindness is a misleading name, I always say color confused and let people know it is not just ""is this red?"" and not knowing but more an ambiguity based on distance, shade, lighting, movement, etc. I use the example of watching cars drive down a highway, I can tell you the dark ones from the light ones but damn if I could pin down the color further than that. I knew one guy who first glance on most colors had no idea what he say, but when pressed he could pin it down to three possible colors and pressed harder could normally figure out the color. Just takes concentration, and this concentration can give you a head ache. I used to work on a farm picking tomatoes and strawberries. I normally could find the good ones, but it was hard and gave me a wicked headache."

As a general rule, if you are only conveying something through colour, you should rethink your design to make it clearer to everyone, not just the colourblind.  With the gauges, you don't seem to be showing good or bad - you always seem to be showing progression of some kind, and you mention scales in another comment, so I knocked up this little example that I think makes this clearer than just using colour: http://i.imgur.com/2JEV5D5.png"

ColorBlind,29qx7s,juletre,2,Thu Jul 3 20:01:56 2014 UTC,"I don't see why jump capable is squeezed in there, assuming it is yes/no. How does it fit on a scale?   As I understand the graphics, this is when considering buying an item. I don't know anything about thrust in your system and if 500K Newton is much or not. It would be very cool if the distribution of thrust over different (encountered or all) engines were shown, and how this particular engine compares.   Example: Say you randomly assign thrust to an engine from a standard distribution with a given mean and standard deviation; you can now show your existing and this new compared to what they can expect to find elsewhere so the players can make a better buying decision.  If you don't have a distribution known beforehand, or don't want to give the information away, plot the thrust of engines the player has encountered so far in their game.   I got a little carried away there...   edit: as to what numbers you want high and want you want low, a tutorial of sorts should make it clear to the player. Personally I'd say 'reload time' given in seconds is something I want minimized. With 'Reload time' on a 1-10 scale with no units I wouldn't know if 1 or 10 was best."
ColorBlind,29qx7s,juletre,1 point,Fri Jul 4 16:25:57 2014 UTC,"It's still very early in development, so Jump Capable is there only temporary. I'll either replace with a checkmark somehow, or move it to the description. I just haven't gotten around to it yet.  The way it works now the scale goes to the extremes of available engines (same for other equipment). 500kN is the maximum that's found in the game so the scale is maxed out. Lowest right now is 75kN, which would end you up in the very bottom of the scale. So for Charge Time 1.5 seconds is pretty close to the lowest you can get (with 10 or so the maximum) so it ends you up in the bottom part. As a player you should be able to discern whether this is towards the maximum number you can get, or the minimum number you can get.  I hadn't thought about showing the new item compared to old items, but I'm not sure how to solve that as the new item can replace any number of old ones with the way the UI currently works (each ship has multiple module slots, so when viewing a new item, you haven't specified which one is being replaced). That might be caused by poor UI though. That said, I could easily do this for ships as you only have one ship and it's obviously the one your replacing with whatever you're viewing.  The problem of course is to convey whether a high number is good or bad. I can easily put in a help screen that explains each value, and whether it's good or not, but most players tend not to read help screens. For the vast majority of stats, higher is better, but everything has at least one or two stats where higher is worse (everything has Mass for instance, which is worse as you get higher).  I've played with the idea of ""flipping"" the axis horizontally so that whatever is ""best"" is always to the right. But if I use the scaled height method, the height no longer corresponds to a higher value but rather ""worseness"" which isn't very intuitive. Here's a quick mockup example: http://imgur.com/p5gcRwj  I'm all open for ideas.  edit: uh, I guess this is actually how the flipped axis would actually be: http://imgur.com/GcIXO5a"

Consider picking up an app like Color Oracle or Visolve to get an idea what your child is seeing.

ColorBlind,297ycs,infinitemultiverse00,2,Fri Jun 27 06:03:48 2014 UTC,"The distinction of trichromat vs dichromat is exactly that. If someone is a dichromat they only have 2 types of colour cones, and can't distinguish any of their deficient colour type in any colour.  On the other hand a trichromat does have all 3 types of colour cones but is deficient in one or two of those colour cones. Even with a deficiency in more than one, if you have cones of those types you will still be a trichromat.  Personally I haven't been properly tested (keep meaning to..) but various online tests have shown me to have strong protanomaly and weak deuteranomaly. So I have barely any red, some green, but would still be considered a trichromat.  To add to that and try to answer you better, if someone was dichromatic red without a green deficiency they would still see green as green. What would happen is a lack of ability to see red in any colours that contain red. Pink and purple would be blue, orange would look yellow, etc. I think red itself would look gray, but I'm not sure on that."
ColorBlind,297ycs,teddy5,2,Fri Jun 27 08:48:02 2014 UTC,"The distinction of trichromat vs dichromat is exactly that   Actually, it's not nearly as cut & dried as you might think. There's an entire class of guys (not sure whether they've ever found any women yet) who appear to paradoxically exhibit ""protanomaly without red-dimming"", but are REALLY deuteranopes with enough foveal rod cells to act like degenerate M-type (""green"") cones. Sequence their genes, and they're unambiguously deuteranopes. Autopsy them when they die, and physically confirm that there are no medium (""green"") cone cells in their retinas. Yet, they have the apparent color vision of a protan anomalous trichromat without the usual drawback. Their existence was documented for decades, but systematically dismissed as ""impossible"" and ""experimental error"" until the 1970s. It wasn't until the 90s when researchers started to actually figure out what was going on, and wasn't until about 5-10 years ago that gene sequencing advanced to the point where the theory could be confirmed.  Source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2596756/  This effect has been documented in people with ""normal"" color vision by formulating two batches of paint using exotic pigments so that the two appear to be identical when viewed straight-on under bright light (when rod cells aren't generally useful), but appear to be distinctly different when viewed in dim light using peripheral vision. There's a narrow window of opportunity at twilight when rod cells become active, but cone cells still have enough light to function. However, most people can only perceive it with their peripheral vision.  This has broader implications that you might realize. For one thing, it lends scientific credibility to reports that marijuana improves some forms of color blindness. It's long been established that cannabinoids alter the response & functioning of rod cells in ways that allow them to work under lighting conditions where they'd normally be overstimulated & shut down, and anecdotally reported for decades that some people who smoke pot experience temporary changes to their color vision... changes that suddenly start to make sense when you correlate them to the experiences of functionally-protanomalous deuteranopes & realize you're seeing the same effect in people with normal color vision when they're under the influence of marijuana.  It also suggests that it might be possible to isolate out the components of cannabinoids that allow rods to function in brighter light than normal & create a profitable non-cannabinoid prescription drug that temporarily gives deuteranopes functionally-protanomalous color vision (by allowing their rod cells to fill the role normally served by medium/green cone cells under lighting conditions when they'd NORMALLY be shut down). That same drug would probably be useful for people with deuteranomalous vision, too (but only if it were fairly cheap & had few meaningful side effects, since the effect would be a lot more subtle)."

Mainly I wanted to keep my answer simple, but yours is a hell of a lot more accurate.  I find this research especially interesting because the description of people with the colour blindness they were looking for matched fairly well to what I see. They were also using this as a starting point for looking for related females who were tetrachromats. Which was the part that really interested me about it, as my sister has long described colours that I've since realised are likely the result of tetrachromacy (such as 8 colours in rainbows, slight halos around electronic devices and seeing UV lights as beams of light).   All in all, we're really only scratching the surface of what is actually going on with colour vision. Even when we do, the animal world shows us our 3 colour cones are woefully insufficient to fully understand the range of light that is actually there."

A person with normal color vision has a certain ratio of signal from the red and green cones, with our glasses most people with CVD pushes back a signal more like that.  If you really only have two cones (protanopia) they would not be able to manage that ratio because the second one is just not there. They are effective for mild and medium protanomaly and deuteranomaly, and often strong cases- our testing application is not able to distinguish between protanopia and strong protanomaly as the computer or mobile device is unable to hit that level of refinement.  As for value; we price them based upon the input costs which have no relation to the price of ordinary sunglasses. The coatings are aerospace precision optical coatings. Nobody we have spoken to who can see color would sell it for $500 or $500,000 but the color blind don't value it like that.

I am a small business owner and we have banned UPS from our premise, and because I take their inconsistency personally, we drop suppliers that ship via UPS.  But, there's a happy alternate.  I have had only superlative delivery service from USPS and CanadaPost.  Seriously, they often match UPS and Fedex for delivery times, their weakness is they won't quantify delivery times less than X-business days, whereas the couriers do.

USPS is bad; we get returns sometimes via them and 1/2 the time we just get a note in our mailbox telling us to send someone to go pick it up from the post office. We have to shut down our customer support for 45 minutes every time that happens.  Maybe we will consider shipping to Canada via USPS because of the handoff to Canada Post.

Sometimes it does come out with odd results, it is just the nature of trying to test your color perception on a device which has an incredibly limited system of replicating color. Taking it a few times and discarding outliers should give you a good idea of what is going on. Sometimes you can sort of guess an answer or you miss it due to monitor issues and it bins you in the wrong category tree and you cannot get back to where you need to be.   There are specialists at some vision science programs who can give you a definitive answer (Wayne Verdon at UC Berkeley runs a notable one, for example), and you could go to your local eye doctor who will probably run the Ishihara test on you, though the tests they provide are mostly just screening for a yes/no answer in terms of CVD rather than type and severity.

ColorBlind,28f7lm,_IAmMike_,3,Wed Jun 18 03:20:38 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's the way light hits stuff.  Suppose the colors of these two towels weren't being reflected off the thousands of individual follicles and were instead just two flat, opaque squares of pink and green that you made in 5 seconds using paint.  The difference between the two colors wouldn't make a difference because there is a lack of subtle changes in how bright the cloth is as opposed to others, some parts aren't closer to the lense than others, the lighting isn't closer to one object than another, and so on.  (Again, I think) the reason I could eventually see a difference was because of these minute differences.  It doesn't get said because people just intuitively know it, but: sight is so much more than color.  The longer you stare at something the more of these differences you'll notice."

I can't separate dark green, dark blue, dark grey and black very well without a LOT of light (tests say I have no colour vision deficiency, but others seem to manage this much more easily than me).

ColorBlind,28g21j,vanderZwan,1 point,Wed Jun 18 08:58:20 2014 UTC,"Not an expert, but I think it makes sense. You know those optical illusions that can be seen two different ways? Like the classic rabbit or duck? At first you see those one way and that's the only way you can see it. After looking at it for a while you realize it can be seen a different way and it clicks. You're looking at the same thing, but now that your brain realizes it can be seen a different way it's able to focus on that.  I think colors work a similar way. At first glance the towels look like the same color or very similar colors. Once your brain realizes they aren't the same color it focuses more on that while before it glazed over it.  Normal sighted people do the same thing. My father had a car that was a dark green but many people thought it was black at first glance. Only once they payed attention did they realize it was green and were able to see it that way."

Sure, I can see distinct colours in the image you posted but my theory is that because colour has been difficult for me all my life I place more importance on shape and look than I do colour.  If something is essential to game play then its distinctness would be best communicated by colour and visual distinctness."

ColorBlind,289kct,nupanick,2,Tue Jun 17 01:36:29 2014 UTC,"17 and 18, 11, are good for me.  In most of the others red and green are too clsoe (16, 14, 8, 5) or green and yellow are too close 12, 16, 6, 7)  All assuming these need to be differentiated quickly. Most are discernible with a squint and a few comparisons to the key."

ColorBlind,289kct,nupanick,2,Mon Jun 16 13:16:08 2014 UTC,"My suggestion would be to rely on symbols and brightness, rather than a complicated system to correct for hues. For instance, when the green is darker and the red is lighter that's easier for me to deal with. Or of the green is a circle and the red is a diamond.   The issue I've found as a colourblind gamer is that my brain is so used to filtering colour data out as useless that, when push comes to shove, my ability to play these games breaks down even when I could normally distinguish the colours. I used to play EVE Online a lot, for instance, and found that even though I could distinguish red warnings from green warnings normally, in the heat of battle I frequently didn't notice them.  For that reason, I think the best solution would just be to make the game playable even if it was in black and white. That is, don't just rely  on different hues to distinguish colours, but also use radical  differences in brightness, shape, and pattern."

I must say though it would be a lot easier to justify a purchase (at least psychologically) if I could use my optical plan to offset the price.  My 'killer app' for these glasses would be for driving.  Perhaps ally with optometrists?  TBH, 2000 orders doesn't seem like a whole lot.  If you pre-sold them until you reached 2000, you might be able to do it.  But I guess that's around 1.6 to 1.8 million in sales, so I can see the challenge re: kickstarter."

ColorBlind,283ie5,EnChroma,3,Fri Jun 20 00:54:58 2014 UTC,"uBruce Drumm of the FDA has a writeup on the matter which describes their view on the ColorMax and ChromaGen tinted lenses circa 2004 http://www.scribd.com/doc/229699864/FDA-Tutorial-Color-Blindness-Drumm . Basically, they gave them 510(k) clearance because they believed their claims based upon Ishihara test results. However, when they actually examined the lenses they found this is an invalid way to evaluate functionality claims and the glasses were defeating the test rather than providing a benefit. They let them modify their marketing and continue because they were not really hurting anyone. Anyone else following in their footsteps is exempt from 510(k) registration as long as their marketing claims do not exceed the existing ones as the incumbents provide such little value. [Thank you Bruce Drumm if you are reading this, you are our hero. Seriously.]  It is not possible to mix together a pot of dyes and come up with a certain color tint which lets color blind people see colors or shades they otherwise could not. If we could make a functional equivalent from dye tints we would replace the EnChroma Cx with that immediately, they would cost us 3c a lens. I know as consumers you do not really care if the glasses are made from dyes or by precision optical coatings but we would not do it the way we do if the cheap way worked, and we tried.  TLDR: we would be doing something else with our lives if any of the other products really worked."
ColorBlind,283ie5,EnChroma,3,Sun Jun 15 01:48:41 2014 UTC,"I appreciate your point, and agree that a color tint is a sub-optimal solution.

ColorBlind,27vlfg,antome,6,Wed Jun 11 14:30:12 2014 UTC,I was just wondering how practical it would be to have a low-latency filter that intervened between the console and the television which simply filters the colours to be more colourblind friendly.
ColorBlind,27vlfg,MechanicalYeti,2,Thu Jun 12 03:36:53 2014 UTC,You mean perform Daltonisation of video signals? Interesting idea...
ColorBlind,27vlfg,antome,1 point,Thu Jun 12 04:37:18 2014 UTC,I'm not exactly sure what you're proposing. Just a filter over top of the video? I'm not sure how effective that would be.
ColorBlind,27vlfg,lx45803,2,Thu Jun 12 05:53:20 2014 UTC,"That's exactly what I am proposing. ""colour blind mode"" in games just involves changing the hues of icons to be easily distinguishable. This would just ""compress"" the hues to avoid the area of the spectrum where a missing cone is. In a sense it would actually be better than colour blind mode, because you can more easily distinguish everything, rather than just specific things."
ColorBlind,27vlfg,antome,1 point,Thu Jun 12 06:16:05 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I don't even think you'd need that. Unless knowing what the actual color is is somehow important to gameplay, there could just be a toggle that forces the colors to colorblind safe values clientside. No need for a filter that eats performance."
ColorBlind,27vlfg,lx45803,2,Thu Jun 12 22:22:18 2014 UTC,"I was meaning a filter that sits outside the console, which would just be a DSP of some sort. That would only add at most 1ms of lag, and considering most televisions have a good 30ms+ of latency, I don't think that would mean much."
ColorBlind,27vlfg,antome,1 point,Fri Jun 13 03:43:30 2014 UTC,"I guess, but that's even more crazy. Why buy/make a physical device when Nintendo can add a few dozen lines of code in an afternoon and completely solve the problem?"

I ran it a third time on the sRGB monitor and it called me a ""mild Protan/Deutan (red/green)"" and recommended the iRo Lens i1.

I know that in Canada, our federal legislation on employment equity states that disabilities (like colourblindness) need to be accommodated up until the point of undue hardship (where the business can't reasonably be expected to go so far), and you're clearly within the realm of accommodation here.  I don't know the details of your situation and what sort of attitude everyone had in the heat of the moment but if you have a Human Resources department, approach them with this concern, explaining that you can't complete the work assigned because of a disability and that you asked to be accommodated. Mention but don't dwell on the fact that your manager refused and ask if they can act on your behalf in this issue.  Once progress has been made in enabling you to do your work, then you can focus on the personnel file because you have precedent from the HR department supporting that you have the right to the proper tools to do your job."

ColorBlind,26qajk,Tomling,1 point,Tue Jul 1 21:13:33 2014 UTC,"Well, I'd actually argue it's pink judging from rgb values, purple has blue values higher than green and much closer to the red value, whereas pink has blue values much lower and closer to green. The cape appears to have higher blue value and so I'd call it purple, whereas the other accents seem to just be a light red with low blue and green values.

ColorBlind,26qajk,skellious,1 point,Tue Jul 1 21:33:30 2014 UTC,"My point was that colour is a linguistic and cultural construct. in german pink and purple are the same colour, much like in italian light and dark blue are entirely different colours, whilst in english they are just shades of the same colour. the ancient greeks called the sky and the sea bronze. colour is a social invention because once we developed language it was advantageous to be able to say ""dont eat the red berries, they'll kill you"". However, the colours we choose to identify are determined by what we find the need to identify. this is presumably why  paint manufacturers have invented 1000's of names for shades most of the rest of us group into one of 8 colours (in english).  edit: not to mention turquoise, which some people call blue and some call green."

Cultivars of the plant produce fruits in different colors, including red, yellow, orange, green, chocolate/brown, vanilla/white, and purple. Bell peppers are sometimes grouped with less pungent pepper varieties as ""sweet peppers"". Peppers are native to Mexico, Central America and northern South America. Pepper seeds were later carried to Spain in 1493 and from there spread to other European, African and Asian countries.

No so easy when your offensive line's jerseys look identical to the defense.

ColorBlind,25qncw,dejoblue,1 point,Fri May 16 20:48:29 2014 UTC,Not sure about that test. My daughter (not colourblind) came out as Mild Deutan.  I'm a protanope and there is no colourblindness in my wife's family.
ColorBlind,25qncw,IDoNotAgreeWithYou,2,Sat May 17 02:13:31 2014 UTC,Are you sure she's not colorblind? Being a mild deutan means she can still see the colors but many of the shades are lost.

Deutan makes no sense.  Not ruling it out, but it is pretty unlikely because she does fine with colours.  If anything she helps me with blue/purple, yellow/pale green and red/brown/green.

ColorBlind,25qncw,Zorander22,1 point,Sat May 17 05:01:33 2014 UTC,"It's possible the test was correct, but knowing nothing about the situation I'd say it's more likely the screen wasn't showing the colors quite right. The way to take the test is on a computer screen with the brightness at a sufficient level.  And no other programs on that affect the screen. I left Flux on accidentally once while trying out a new test and got... confusing results.  Edit 2: You are not the OP, my mistake.  Edit: You mentioned earlier that it's unlikely she's a deutan because you're a protanope. Why are you so confident now when this thread was about thinking you were a deutan? Take the enchroma test under proper conditions, and maybe a few others if you doubt it, to make sure.  Do you have trouble with blue and green? That's protanopia/anomaly. Your problem colors do seem more consistent with deutanopia/anomaly. And if that's the case, it is entirely likely that your wife could be a carrier and your daughter a deutan. I would have her take a test (again, under proper conditions) just in case. If she comes up as a deutan again then it's likely."
ColorBlind,25qncw,ChodeMcJiggleTits,1 point,Sat May 17 06:10:38 2014 UTC,Good points all round but I was tested as protanopic at age 15 (by an optometrist) and have very consistently retested that way   Sure she could be deutan but realistically it is unlikely given family history and her lack of trouble differentiating colours. With my colourblindness my wife and I both understand colourblindness and know what to look for.   Her kids however...

ColorBlind,25p9kc,murfbard,1 point,Fri May 16 14:02:28 2014 UTC,I like the idea with dashed outlines. I'm imagining white dashed outlines which fade away when you match the color. The interface seems easy enough that I'm okay with the quick trial-and-error of getting to the ball park of colors and switching colors until the dashes disappear/appear.

I think that whatever scenarios which a re actually going to use 12 colors or whatever there are, I would bring up the idea of challenging yourself by doing more with less.  Might take care of the color issue. Seems like as a dev, it might be too easy to get caught up in your own gimmick ( which is awesome, btw ). You might be more rewarded by limiting yourself. I think that could make for an interesting aspect.   Can't wait to check it out later."

When you turn the background blue so a red block can fall through a blue block, and both occupy the same space...what happens if you go back to a color that shows both blocks?"

ColorBlind,25p9kc,j4ckalop3,3,Fri May 16 13:53:35 2014 UTC,"Depending on what kind of game this is, you might want to make ""secret areas"" where you get extra points or items or challenges...and these areas are only accessible by combining the right two blocks AND choosing the right background..and that turns the two blocks into a door to the secret area.  Call one with an orange door something like ""orange world"", and players will wonder if there is a purple world, or a mauve world, etc..., and the game gains another level of complexity to go through once the main task is finished.  Players will want to go through a second time and find all the opportunities to make mixed color doors and see what's there."

ColorBlind,25mcl5,AlphaAnt,1 point,Thu May 15 18:43:37 2014 UTC,"No, the simple reason being that if you are colourblind you see in a reduced colour pallette. Less colours. So there are no 'spare' colours to move things to.  There are also different types of colourblindness, depending on which type of receptors are deficient.  What you're looking for is a simple solution, which exists - don't rely on colour alone to convey information. Use it only as a reinforcement for other methods, such as shape, pattern, icon etc."
ColorBlind,25mcl5,murfbard,7,Thu May 15 19:08:38 2014 UTC,"You'll never get the colours setup so that they're accessible to everyone. Types of colourblindness are too varied. See the greyscale comment.  Make them unique based on icons, images, or more pronounced differentiations.   Use the train cards in Ticket to Ride as an example. They are colour based, but they have icons in the corner of each card and on the game board. My wife never really noticed them, but I can't play the game without them."

It also could be a form of traumatic color blindness. When you say you've been color blind for 27 years are you implying that you weren't born color blind? Brain damage can also cause color blindness.   If you're really this curious, there are researchers around the world who study color blindness.

It actually looks a bit better as I can now see the red(?) flowers and none of the yellow(?) ones turned white like in op's pic but they still don't look yellow, or at least what I think yellow looks like. It's still kinda washed out and it still doesn't really help me pick what color something is but it did help separate the colors better. It actually might be a good example for non color blind to see how much needs to be changed for us to see different colors but not necessarily a good example of what we see.   edit: Threw the pics together real quick to compare.

ColorBlind,24n7h0,NerosNeptune,2,Sun May 4 02:01:21 2014 UTC,"This is because the old example image was made with a buggy version and the new version hasn't been uploaded yet. Here's a better representation of how it works for red-green colorblindness:  Here's an image:  http://i.imgur.com/Hpgbz73.jpg  For a lot of people with red-green colorblindness, it would look something like this:  http://i.imgur.com/zrkHksC.jpg  You can't really see the flowers at all in front of the grass.  When the algorithm is applied, the result is:  http://i.imgur.com/NpcfeDj.jpg  Which looks approximately like:  http://i.imgur.com/Jg18Wny.jpg  The grass may be less bright, but you can see the boundaries of the flowers now! The goal is not to be accurate, but instead to provide easier boundary detection for people with colorblindness.  This helps with things like GUIS, icon sets, graphic design, etc. It's meant as a tool to automatically generate colorblind-friendly material.  That's how it all looks in the CURRENT version of the algorithm. That picture is very old and I apologize if it mislead you.

ColorBlind,24n7h0,gdeest,1 point,Sun May 4 05:09:25 2014 UTC,"No. Colorblind people see unified colors, not collapsed ones. Not exacftly. This makes them able to distinguish more boundaries by squeezing the colors inside their visual range."

If you are describing the inability to properly identify what a color is, and you're internally debating whether it is red or green (like in your example) then I can see where you are coming from.  I think it's hard for others to understand that I have to THINK about what a color is, whereas they just instantly know.  Well, that's not true, some people will debate it, but their debate is ""is this seafoam or periwinkle"" not is this green.  Their devil is in the details, ours is in macro."

ColorBlind,24g1bj,BulatMR,10,Thu May 1 10:17:00 2014 UTC,"We can see most colors. The problem is when they are stand-alone. Put up a singular color like purple and I will only see blue, if it is a more red or light shade like say lavender I may assume a shade of gray.  However, put up two shades of purple, next to each other and I can tell them apart instantly. I am also extremely good at color matching. As a child I was tasked with setting the old tube TV colors because I could match the shades perfectly. I think this is simply because we have to practice and compare colors constantly.  A lot of my color vision is an intellectual exercise. I know intellectually that turquoise is blue-green, even though I may not be able to tell myself.  I know you didn't ask and I apologize if I sound pushy as your family and community and this new age being 30 years later may provide him the support and understanding he needs. As far as helping to rear your child here are some tips that will make him a lot less frustrated:  Be explicit about all colors. Turquoise and lavender may look blue or gray to him, explain one has green and the other red.  Be explicit when asking him to make decisions involving color and get confirmation. ""You want the green apple? You know they are not sweet like red apples but are tart? OK then, enjoy!""  Buy crayons that have the name of the color printed on the side.  When he is old enough to dress himself let him know when colors do not match but be nice about it.  Let his teachers know.  I have to change my text editor to use a different color for spell checking, even against a stark white background with black text I miss the red highlighting indicating something was spelled incorrectly. He may need this assistance as well.  If you have him clean, especially on a dark carpet or tiles, be aware that he may not be able to see dirt. I had a job at Pizza Hut where they have red tiles and was constantly reprimanded for being lazy, stupid or whatever because I would miss spots sweeping and mopping that were plain as day to normal vision persons. This was occasionally an issue washing pots and pans as well.  Believe him every time he says he cannot tell what color something is or when he has to make a decision about color and takes forever. I know it may get frustrating for you to hear the same ""excuse"" over and over, but literally everything we see all day every day that is not black or white is potentially a different color to us than what it actually is. Even gray betrays us.  Know that this never goes away and never gets better. He will not say anything. I am 36 and never say anything. It used to be embarrassing and other kids treated me like an idiot, now it is just frustrating and explaining my predicament is always met with a barrage of questions about what color things are, as no one, NO ONE believes you are color blind.  It may not be a disability but it is certainly a handicap and some professions may have limits. Military, nursing and even driving may have restrictions depending on the specific duties and location. you may wish to temper his expectations if he appears to be choosing one such profession.  If all else fails, your Father In-Law can help :)  Cheers!"
ColorBlind,24g1bj,dejoblue,1 point,Thu May 1 11:18:05 2014 UTC,Thank you very much. Do you think it's better to tell him about it now or should we wait until he gets a little older?
ColorBlind,24g1bj,LolaRockabella,7,Thu May 1 11:34:00 2014 UTC,"One more thing I should mention, because it hasn't been brought up yet. He will have no way to tell when he's had too much sun. He won't be able to see his sunburns or tell if he's turning red. Also, he'll try to eat green bananas and probably has food issues because everything in a salad or red sauce blends in and looks like brown lumpy stuff. And he might think peanut butter and poop are green. That's as far as my personal experiences with a colourblind son have taken me so far."
ColorBlind,24g1bj,LolaRockabella,2,Thu May 1 20:23:52 2014 UTC,"Tell him, and tell his teacher. Kindergarten and Grade One have a lot of colour-based assignments. My son thought he was doing it right, but getting lots of red X's on his sheets without any follow-up. I had to remind the teacher a 3rd time that he's colorblind before she started cutting him some slack.   Edit: Also, he kept trying to wear an army green t-shirt with peacock blue cords."
ColorBlind,24g1bj,LolaRockabella,2,Thu May 1 14:48:37 2014 UTC,How did you tell your son about his color vision deficiency? I don't want to traumatize my son.
ColorBlind,24g1bj,epicphoton,3,Thu May 1 20:34:58 2014 UTC,"We didn't really make it a big deal. I told him he sees colours differently than others, but that it wasn't uncommon and in fact 1/5 boys are just like him. He didn't really seem to care, to be honest. Now he kind of laughs about it when he finds out something he always thought was one colour is really another."
ColorBlind,24g1bj,dejoblue,2,Thu May 1 20:46:49 2014 UTC,"Tell him now. If he doesn't know, he might be confused and frustrated when differences in color perception arise.   For most kids, they get taught colors, and they're good to go for the rest of their life. We have to deal with the occasional bout of color ""confusion."" Everyone else in the thread nailed it. It's not that we can't see colors, we just have difficulties differentiating or identifying specific colors sometimes.* The sooner he knows, he can start to identify what he has issues with, and how he can adapt.   Also: Tennis balls are not all yellow, they are also green; the crosswalk walk man is white, not green (still convinced they did this to screw with us); peanut butter is brown, not green; yes he does need to wear sunscreen (he won't be able to tell when he is sunburnt).  *This assumes he is deuteronamalous or protanomalous, where either the red or green cones in his eye work ""differently."" The best way I have seen it explained is that they cover a slightly different range of red or green, though that may be incorrect. These two types are the most common, and the least intrusive. Tritanomaly affects the blue cones of the eye and affects color vision more drastically. In dicromacy, one of the 3 types is missing entirely, which heavily affects color vision, and monochromacy is a lack of ALL cones, meaning true only-see-grey color blindness."
ColorBlind,24g1bj,Periculous22,2,Thu May 1 15:05:49 2014 UTC,"I'd tell him as soon as you think he can comprehend what it means.   Even knowing doesn't mean he will be able to figure out some things. Like my Pizza Hut experience, I didn't figure that out until I was cleaning the carpet of my house in my early 20's and was frustrated that no matter what I did I would walk barefoot and still find things I missed vacuuming, like right in the middle of the floor.  Then things clicked.  When I found out it was not a big deal. I was looking at class rings and mistook an emerald for a ruby and looked at the text and then told my Mom, to which she relied she knew...  It mostly will not effect his life, I know we colorblind can make a huge stink but it is out of frustration. I conjecture that colorblind persons think more logically and are better at abstract concepts because we have a lifetime from birth where we have to logically sort out the abstract concept of color, which may lend itself to our being ""weird"" hehe :)  I have no memories of being teased or bullied, I didn't even know at the time, I do have memories of frustration but that was all personal and no one knew. I did have the usual bullying and teasing that kids go through which is what I remember, along with the good stuff, of course ;)  Anyways just my rambling thoughts."

ColorBlind,24g1bj,DRUSStheLEG3ND,5,Fri May 2 03:07:01 2014 UTC,"There are some great apps, both for your phone and computer, that can simulate color blindness.   Visolve and Color Oracle come to mind.  There aren't major colors that I can't see. But, certain shades of things like red, green, purple, and pink, will look like other colors. Green and red can look the same in certain conditions. Purple will look like dark blue, pink can come off as gray.   Color blindness can be frustrating, but it's rare that it affects you on a day-to-day basis. I don't believe there are any links between people being ""really weird"" and color deficiency."

ColorBlind,24g1bj,paracelsus23,3,Thu May 1 11:12:13 2014 UTC,"I'm red/green deficient and didn't realise until about the age of 13. I didn't really understand at the time because I knew the difference between red and green, so what the optometrist said didn't make sense to me, I could see colour fine in my eyes.  It wasn't until I was older and looked more into it, that I found out its not the base colour that's majorly different, but the blending of the different shades. Say there was a line of colour, the beginning of it Red, and the end, Green. In between the base colours is every single shade variation. A normal person would see all of those as different shades, whereas I would see about a third until the middle ones all just looked the same colour.  I hasn't really affected my life as far as I can tell, (aside from grabbing Ready Salted chips when I really wanted Salt and Vinegar) but I've been told career aspects are limited due to some careers (cops, pilots) requiring 20/20 vision.

I feel the handicap is more social in nature -- when another person finds out about my colorblindness I'm sometimes treated like a circus freak, or at the very least my vision is called out in public for other people's entertainment.

ColorBlind,24g1bj,Hammerosu,3,Thu May 1 16:06:05 2014 UTC,"First understand that there are different types of color deficiency that can cause red / green issues - one set of cones can be missing, or it can be anomalous. I believe I fall into the latter category. Either way not all red green deficiencies are the same and any description you read here may or may not be applicable to your son.   The best ways I've been able to describe it is a ""lack of resolution on the spectrum"". In particular, red is not very vivid for me. The best way I can describe it - I can see red - I know what it looks like - but imagine the brightest, most vivid yellow or blue you've ever seen. That doesn't exist for me with red. It's always dull and boring (I could never understand why fire trucks were red - I mean might as well paint them black?). Consequently, purple and blue are effectively the same color, and pink typically looks gray to me.   It's much easier for me to distinguish colors in natural light than artificial light, and consequently I invest a lot of money on ""high color rendering index"" bulbs to aide my color perception in artificial light. I'm also green deficient, but don't really recognize it as a separate color. It's just a general area between yellow and brown. Grass is yellow - orange or brown depending on how healthy it is, and traffic lights are ""white"", ""yellow"", ""dim red"" (or ""off"" with the older non led ones). The ""white"" I see for green is actually somewhat similar to the sodium halide Street lights that are commonly used, and I'll sometimes have issues at night in a new city noticing a green traffic light in a sea of street lights.   I found out when I was in 5th grade. It didn't bother me at the time, but has more and more as I've gotten older. Now, at 27, I'm quite bitter about the practical restrictions (difficult or impossible to become a pilot, commercial driver in some places, and work in certain manufacturing environment) as well as the whole ""I will never see as much as normal people"" thing. Sunsets are beautiful to me, but hearing people describe the green, pink, etc hues always takes me down a notch. Is it a disability in the way being a paraplegic is? No, not even in the same ballpark. This doesn't affect my day to day life almost at all. But it doesn't mean I've made peace with or accepted it, either.   P.S. - my regular vision is amazing (20/14 during high school, closer to 20/20 now) - which makes this even more frustrating. Also, while it's kinda nice to not worry about wearing glasses - at least bad eyesight CAN be corrected. Even a product like EnChroma won't fully restore color vision - it's not really possible without something like genetic repair."

ColorBlind,24g1bj,YouAreFalse,3,Thu May 1 21:31:33 2014 UTC,"How I found out: I found out I was color blind when I was in kindergarten. The teacher called everybody up to her desk, held a box of crayons, and asked us to identify the colors. Some time later when I started going to the optometrist they would hold up a circle of colors and ask me what number I saw(and for a bunch of them I would only see a circle of colors).  Just imagine taking this Test, and failing to see almost everything you are suppose to see(Your not convincing me there is a boat anywhere in that last one).  My best attempt at explaining what it is like: I wouldn't say that I don't see all of the colors(though how could I really know), its more like I tell the difference between very close colors. Even I can tell the difference between two colors, I cannot necessarily tell you which colors they are.   The best way for me to illustrate is with a Graphthat was popular on Reddit today  I can tell that they are all different colors,though not as distinctly between two of them, but I cannot match those colors with countries (with the exception of France). If i was taking a test in school on the information in the graph, i would need somebody to write the country names on the lines actually in the graph. To me, Denmark could be one of three lines. I am not sure which is Great Britain and which is Italy. If you asked me to name any of those colors, i would say that they are purplish/blueish/red/greenish/and orangish?  Why I thought it was cool instead of a disability: Honestly, I kind of thought the whole thing was cool. It never really sounded like something to be ashamed of. I remember my mom telling me that alot of people are color blind, and then told me that my grandfather is color blind. My grandfather was very respected, so telling me that I was like him in ways other 'normal' people were not really made me feel special or something. I would suggest perhaps seeing if any super heroes/famous people/celebrities that your son likes is color blind if there is no-one in your family that is a role model and is color blind. The only time I was actually disappointing was when somebody told me that I couldn't be a helicopter pilot. I don't know if that is true, and I didn't have any intentions of becoming one anyway, but it kind of stunk.   Later when I was older, people had a fun time trying to get me to take color blind test to see different shapes/numbers/letters. I learned to embrace it as it always was something that entertained people... including cute girls;)  Honestly I would say that being color blind has no way affected my happiness. I have insecurities, and being color blind has never been one of them. Perhaps I just had great people to surround me(sounds like your son does) or perhaps I a really weird like your father-in-law and haven't realized it. Actually I am definitely pretty weird.

All of my color-normal friends are absolutely blown away when they try them on though.  All they really do is block certain parts of the spectrum so that reds, greens, and browns are all separated a little more. It just enhances colors comparatively; so the greens look a lot different then reds do. They don't make you see things you can't, but things like evergreen trees will look a bit greener than before because the glasses block the part of the spectrum that makes them look brownish, so you're only seeing the green from the tree.  Are they worth the $400? Not really. They're pretty decent as far as sunglasses go, and the color enhancement is pretty cool once you get used to it, but they're by no means life-changing.

ColorBlind,23pu3f,DriftwoodBadger,6,Tue Apr 22 22:16:37 2014 UTC,"Avoid cyan, as it may be perceived as off white or light gray.   Also avoid yellow and green in the same color scheme, as they can be difficult to distinguish unless they are side by side.   Your key concern should be saturation and color quantity.   Aim for ""pure"" colors with high saturation of red,  green,  or blue (no middling hues).   Also,  if your interface relies on colors,  be sure to use a lot of color to make it more noticeable and try to have the colors touch each other (like in your imgur) to make the contrast more noticeable.  For example, even text in bright red can look black or brown if it's on a white background.     TLDR; If you are going to use colors as an indication of something, use ""pure"" colors, make them touch each other, and use them in large quantities."
ColorBlind,23pu3f,Drunken_Snail,2,Wed Apr 23 00:35:34 2014 UTC,"The interface with the colors already has a LOT of each color, like 90% is just the color, and having them touch each other is an option already, so it's just the specific colors I'm trying to figure out.  I picked the specific colors I did because running them through the color blindness simulator they all seemed to come out as distinct colors. Not sure how accurate that particular color simulator is though. When you say 'no middling hues' do you mean no hues combining RGB (like yellow/cyan) or do you mean always make sure they're at 255 and not like 128?"

As for middling colors, I mean both color and saturation.   A pure R G or B is going to put out the strangest color signal, so avoid combing them to create other colors unless you need more than 3 colors.   And you will want them set them to max saturation (255) so they won't be missed.   Not a pretty color scheme, bit should be effective."

Even those with normal colour perception will be able to hallucinate imaginary colours.  The brain can only process what has been input, and if you are missing cones, then you will only get detailed inputs of certain hues. What you are seeing is probably not an ""anti-colour-blindness"" effect, but rather you are enhancing existing perception with a layer of ""imaginary"" information. Like a post-process effect of sorts.  Not that this in itself is a bad thing at all, but don't start taking LSD regularly because of this.  In the future it might be possible to supplement the optic nerve with additional colour information, which could prove beneficial to colour blindness, but that's in the realm of 10-15 years away at this point.

ColorBlind,23bxao,antome,2,Fri Apr 18 05:08:51 2014 UTC,"Imaginary color:       Non-physical, unrealizable, or imaginary colors are points in a color space that correspond to combinations of cone cell responses that cannot be produced by any physical (non-negative) light spectrum.  Thus, no object can have an imaginary color, and imaginary colors cannot be seen under normal circumstances. Nevertheless, they are useful as mathematical abstractions for defining color spaces.  The spectral sensitivity curve of medium-wavelength (""M"") cone cells overlaps those of both short-wavelength (""S"") and long-wavelength (""L"") cone cells. Light of any wavelength that interacts with M cones also interacts with S or L cones, or both, to some extent. Therefore, there is no wavelength, and no non-negative spectral power distribution, that excites only M cones without exciting S or L cones at all. The hypothetical excitation of the M cone alone would correspond to an imaginary color greener than any physical green, corresponding to a spectral power distribution with positive power in the green (medium) wavelengths and (non-physical) negative power in the red and blue (long and short) wavelengths.

Anything on the mechanism at work? I agree it would seem similar to OPs self-reported experience on LSD.  Your pre/post distinction was pretty apt and I think it shows the three approaches.    Pure-pre processing: Neitz's retrovirus which re-lays the cones achieving the right signal ratio reporting Mixed pre-post: EnChroma filtering the pre to achieve an known effect in the post. Pure-post: drugs   ""Supplementing the data"" is a mixed pre/post but you are talking 'Jordi's visor' level of sophistication- it would need a bio-electrical interface or something.

ColorBlind,23bxao,EnChroma,1 point,Wed Apr 23 01:28:34 2014 UTC,"It seems I was using the wrong terminology, and actually meant impossible colours. LSD creates this effect by increasing the rate at which the cone cells in the eye degrade (much like how looking at the pavement at disney world makes the surrounding environment appear more vibrant, by degrading L cones). This degrading of the cells will easily result in mixing saturations and hues in physically ""impossible"" ways such as an orange more saturated than pure orange. This was possibly one reason why you saw so many contrasting vibrant patterns on textiles back when LSD was at the height of its use.  An unrelated mechanism by which impossible colours can be viewed is though binocular rivalry, where the left and right eyes see two complementary colours, and the brain ""fills in the gap"". This could become a particularly interesting phenomenon with the uptake of head mounted displays in the coming few years.  As for bio-electric interface, while I don't see commercialization within 15 years, I think it's very reasonable to suggest that there will be laboratory experiments with more refined direct-optic-nerve stimulus."

Other colors never experienced by ordinary viewing, but perceivable under special artificial laboratory conditions, would also be termed impossible colors.

ColorBlind,22gfvx,colorblindboy,2,Tue Apr 8 02:34:55 2014 UTC,"The brain cannot perceive wavelengths of light that are not sensed by the eyes. It has no way of getting information outside of that range. No amount of shrooms will ever allow you to perceive infrared or ultraviolet energy.  A hallucination is just that, an experience not based on reality.  Here's another analogy. A friend took acid and was convinced she could feel the stars pulling her up. Now, acid certainly did not provide her with some super enhanced sense of minute gravitational fluctuations. She was just having a weird trip."
ColorBlind,22gfvx,NonNonHeinous,6,Tue Apr 8 03:04:08 2014 UTC,"So if the colours you perceive are just the interpretations of signals from the eyes that reach the brain, why would hallucinogens not be able to have the brain receive false sensory data equivalent to the signals that would be sent by by the photoreceptors if they were not colourblind?  In other words, to rephrase the question: can hallucinogens make the colourblind experience colours they normally cannot see?"
ColorBlind,22gfvx,vanderZwan,-1,Tue Apr 8 07:55:12 2014 UTC,"Again, think in terms of infrared or UV. Your experience of those wavelengths while on acid is purely imaginary. Whatever is being hallucinated may have nothing to do with those wavelengths."

ColorBlind,22gfvx,isionous,2,Tue Apr 8 13:30:30 2014 UTC,"It's possible that the change is not in the cones, but in the post-receptoral neural channels, such as {light-dark, red-green, yellow-blue}.  In the Handbook of Optics, Third Edition, I've read things that are very surprising if you approach color vision from a photoreceptor-only perspective.  Not all changes in stimulations of our cones are equal; in certain discrimination tasks, cone stimulation differences that lead to chromatic channel differences are much more potent than cone stimulation differences that lead to achromatic channel differences.  So, imagine a deuteranomalous person takes LSD, and somehow their red-green neural channel gets amplified more than usual, and thus their color discrimination improves.  The article also mentions a study asserting that LSD can cause sustained or irreversible impairment of color discrimination, which again, is explainable by changes to visual neural channels."
ColorBlind,22gfvx,NonNonHeinous,1 point,Tue Apr 8 04:22:02 2014 UTC,"But acquired (i.e. brain-based) color vision loss is much rarer than missing or irregularly sensitive cones. And acquired color vision loss usually comes about from trauma or a brain tumor. In these cases, it might be possible for LSD to somehow reconnect areas, but I'm not sure what the mechanism would be.   So, imagine a deuteranomalous person takes LSD, and somehow their red-green neural channel gets amplified more than usual, and thus their color discrimination improves.   Amplifying the channel wouldn't improve discriminability because the noise level would also be amplified."
ColorBlind,22gfvx,isionous,1 point,Tue Apr 8 04:48:34 2014 UTC,But acquired (i.e. brain-based) color vision loss is much rarer than missing or irregularly sensitive cones.   My proposed explanation is not for acquired CVDs.   Amplifying the channel wouldn't improve discriminability because the noise level would also be amplified.   Noise isn't the only factor limiting discrimination ability.  There is a huge amount of compression in early visual processing.

First, some background; my older brother and I are both colourblind (we were informed that we were red-green colourblind, but I assume it's actually Deuteranopia), so I knew growing up that I was colourblind, and I often made mistakes that would be noticed quickly and rectified. Except for Tinky Winky.  Tinky Winky was a character in The Teletubbies, a popular TV series for children in the UK. I, of course, became obsessed with it as a child. My favourite character? You guessed it, Tinky Winky. I also believed that Tinky Winky was blue; which coincided with the fact that blue was my favourite colour. However, no one seemed to notice that I was obsessed with a character which was purple that I believed was blue.   Until last year.  I was eating lunch with friends, and we someone begin discussing our favourite childhood TV shows. I naturally state the The Teletubbies holds a special place in my heart, mainly due to my favourite character, Tinky Winky. I explain that this was mostly because he is blue, and blue is my favourite colour. This is met by confused stares from my friends, followed by an outburst of laughter. I sat there, shocked and confused, not understanding what was funny. They immediately showed my a photo of Tinky Winky, asking me to state what colour he was, which I replied ""Blue"". This was followed by more laughter, and a trip to Wikipedia, which stated he was covered in Purple Terrycloth.   TL:DR My favourite Children's TV Show Character turned out to be purple, after I had believed he was blue for about 15 years"

ColorBlind,2229jv,MaeBeWeird,3,Thu Apr 3 19:43:52 2014 UTC,"This is not at all true. Pink is a lighter, less saturated shade of red. The relationship between red and pink is the same as the relationship between brown and tan.  Most cotton candy is pink. Bubblegum (""bubble gum flavor"") is pink. Canned salmon is pink.   The truth is that for those who see in full color, the color wheel does wrap around. It's crazy that it does so, considering that as you say colors correspond to a linear spectrum. But for those who are not colorblind, purple looks like an even blend between red and blue, and so purple lies exactly between blue and red on the color wheel, in exactly the same way that green is an even blend between yellow and blue, and orange is an even blend between red and yellow."

ColorBlind,21vt5p,sweezey,3,Tue Apr 1 02:50:11 2014 UTC,"Yep thats us, thanks. But thats not how they work- you are thinking of the other kind. We actually expand the amount of color most people with CVD can you can see.  It works is by reflectance (regular tinted sunglasses are mostly absorptive). A person with normal color vision sees a green-brown object and the eyes report a certain ratio of electrical signal between the red and green cones back to the brain. The brain does its 'paint by numbers' thing and fills in a color. Whereas a color blind person doesn't have enough information to do this correctly due to the condition: the difference reported by the red cone is often not substantial enough to make a call as to what color you are seeing. The brain can't color it in properly.  But it is possible to get someone with color blind eyes to produce something approximating the right ratio if you very precisely structure a lens which reflects away exactly those wavelengths of light which draw the ratio out of alignment.  That is how they work and why they are sunglasses."

On the other hand sometimes they are just too color blind for it to have any effect, and sometimes the effect is not remarkable enough in their mind. This is why we have the return period.

Im fairly new to jquery and greasemoneky but thought I would give it a shot so expect a few more niggles but very grateful for the find.  I have update the page with a thank you to you too.  I know right, I thought they were all red but I was sat here with my buddy and he said ""click the one thats green"" and i laughed at him saying they were all red :)"
ColorBlind,21fdja,q00u,2,Thu Mar 27 08:53:54 2014 UTC,"Two more things: I don't think it needs the @require line at all. No jquery calls are made in your script. I took it out on my computer, and everything still worked fine.  Also, your blog is converting your posted code as if it were intended to be regular text. That is, the leading whitespace is removed, and the apostrophes are changed to inverted commas. The leading whitespace isn't much of a big deal, as that's just for readability. The inverted commas however will cause your script to fail. So anyone trying to add your script from your site won't see it working. Try adding your own script from your site directly and you'll see what happens (or, doesn't).  When you post, does your site allow you formatting options? There should be a code option that you could use that would prevent this change.  Speaking of your site, the ""Leave a comment"" link just goes to a ""#respond"" anchor that doesn't exist. I assume there was intended to be one under the posts. Not that it really matters, since all comments have to be Facebook or G+, haha. I would have posted this on your site itself, but I don't use Facebook or G+, so I guess I'm not allowed to comment there."

Brake lights on cars now scream at me ""RED!"". Trees have a seemingly thousand shades of green and brown. The orange cones I put out around my work truck are basically glowing. I'm also able to ""see"" the orange paint on grass lawns now. I did wear them during evening and night time hours while I was being drove around. Which you aren't suppose to do. But it was fantastic being able to look down a street and see the different types/colors of lights and being able to pick the traffic light ""green"" out of everything.   So, it seems you were able to experience new greens, oranges, reds, and browns that were more colorful than ever before. Were there any colors that didn't seem to get any more colorful with the glasses? For instance, did yellow seem the same?"
ColorBlind,21c1cn,isionous,3,Tue Mar 25 17:49:04 2014 UTC,"Yellow doesn't seem to stand out anymore than before, and blues(like the sky) are somewhat the same I think because of the seemingly extra colors and maybe because of the tint everything seems to look a little different. I am only 2 days in tho. Once I take them off, everything seems washed out. I did let my non-color blind try them on. He said the only thing he saw different was the orange(work cones) were a bit more orange.

ColorBlind,21c1cn,isionous,5,Tue Mar 25 17:01:58 2014 UTC,"Pretty sure medically that's not possible. It's not that your eyes or brain isn't processing the color, the cones in your eyes are either missing or broken so technically you never detect the color in the first place. I think the adaption phase while wearing the glasses is the time your brain needs to interpreter the different colors. At best these glasses are a crutch. I would suggest if you get a chance and have the extra cash to pick them up. They are rather amazing."
ColorBlind,21c1cn,FlatPat12,2,Tue Mar 25 17:31:51 2014 UTC,"Ok great! I was gonna say, it would be hard to believe that some glasses could fix the cones in your eyes but you never know what science can do these days! I think I'll order myself a pair soon!"

I think you are remembering the statement that your brain will take time to adapt to having more useful information along certain neural channels.  Your color vision while wearing the glasses will slowly improve over time (I remember ~2 weeks) as your brain adapts.  Most people report an immediate and significant improvement in their color vision upon first wearing the EnChroma glasses.  I'm not sure how much their color vision further improves (while wearing the glasses) over the following weeks.  It probably would be hard to tell since it would be a gradual process."

ColorBlind,21c1cn,cheezbergher,2,Tue Mar 25 21:44:30 2014 UTC,"Our color blind brains have gone through a lot of effort to adapt to our our deficiency, to the point that we often manage to tell colors apart as if we had normal color vision. Similarly, it is said that EnChroma glasses require some adaptation time (days or weeks) to yield their full potential, because the brain needs to adapt to the new kind of information it receives. Do you think that this rewiring could actually be detrimental to your ability to discriminate colors /wihout/ glasses ?"
ColorBlind,21c1cn,Pill_Cosby,2,Wed Mar 26 10:47:46 2014 UTC,I have no idea if that would be possible or not. Off the cuff I would think maybe since I only wear them hrs during the day and outside the time spent not wearing them would counteract anything like that. But I dont know that I think our brains have necessarly adapted to colorblindness to allow us to see more color. Basically out brain doesnt know our eyes are broken and doesnt know it needs to fix/correct for anything. But if there is any research you know of on this I would be interested to read it.

ColorBlind,21c1cn,soveraign,2,Wed Mar 26 10:49:53 2014 UTC,"I had a negative experience buying these.  When I ordered them 2 months ago, it took over 3 weeks just to leave their warehouse. They kept sending me emails saying they were in the middle of moving to a different lab and kept apologizing. I sent an email asking if they could upgrade my shipping for free since it was such a significant delay and never heard back.  When I got the glasses, there were a couple of defects I noticed. First, when I put them on, they sat cooked on my head. I set them down on a table open and saw that the part of the frame that goes over your ears was crooked by a bout a whole centimeter. I was eventually able to fix this by carefully bending the metal hinges until both ends were even.  Also, there's some slight deformities in the plastic over the nose on the front of the glasses. I'll upload a picture later. But it's not something you would expect on a pair of high end $400 sunglasses. I think the price is from the lenses, the frames are thick plastic but they're probably cheap Chinese junk really.  The color correction does work pretty well, but you have to wear them for about 5 minutes to get your eyes adjusted.  All - in - all I wasn't too happy with this purchase. I may be returning them soon, still can't decide if seeing more color is really worth $400."

Perhaps they make the type of wires you're looking for in those or similar jacket colors.  On an unrelated, but equally frustrating note, I have to frequently make or retip Cat5 cables as part of my job, and the green and brown pairs look very similar.  Thankfully, these cables come in twisted pairs and each pair has its own twist-ratio (how tightly twisted it is) so it makes my job a LOT easier.  I believe this has more to do with eliminating crosstalk between wires though, and less to do with helping us colorblind people."
ColorBlind,20z91k,lolcifer,3,Fri Mar 21 08:57:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I've also had to crimp CAT5e cables. I have to stare at the striped ones for a long time to figure out if they are the white/orange or white/green ones. Whenever I have to I try to make a batch and not have to do it for a while. Also recycling old ones already crimped.  Luckily my actual career is programming, so I can set my color-coding for my IDE for me. :P  Although this has given me an idea. What if I just color code wrappings? Like the kind they use for case cable management or maybe just pattern shrink wrap and wrap lengths of wire before setting them in the harness...?"
ColorBlind,20z91k,lolcifer,1 point,Fri Mar 21 09:31:02 2014 UTC,Yeah that wouldn't be a bad idea.. I'm sure you can find small zipties and heat shrink in various colors.  You could make up your own color coding system with one or more wrappings based on which colors are easiest for you to see.
ColorBlind,20z91k,jakebeans,3,Fri Mar 21 10:27:28 2014 UTC,"I would recommend wire labels.  And use actual words on the labels.  I don't understand the fascination with color coding to begin with, but this is a good alternative.  You label the wire on both ends as to what it actually is and that's usually more than enough to figure out what you're trying to do.  If you're going to need to trace it, you can always put more labels on the wire.  It's more work, but I feel it's superior to color coding for you and the end-user as well."
ColorBlind,20z91k,jakebeans,1 point,Fri Mar 21 23:43:57 2014 UTC,"I suppose I could label them at both ends after I cut them to length, but the addition of a label might make them more difficult to route in the panels, given that they would have a higher tendency to grab on things."

Plus, I'm curious if you have color differences between your right and left eye.   X-linked traits can vary across a woman's body due to X-linked inactivation.  So it can happen."
ColorBlind,20ya8e,Drunken_Snail,10,Fri Mar 21 00:50:07 2014 UTC,I do not as far as I can tell. Both of my eyes work equally poorly.
ColorBlind,20ya8e,Deathfire138,2,Fri Mar 21 01:05:52 2014 UTC,"That shouldn't matter for women because it's a recessive trait, therefore it requires that both X chromosomes have the trait. One is not different from the other in that aspect.  Though I'm happy you brought that up. Barr bodies are pretty cool. :P"
ColorBlind,20ya8e,Drunken_Snail,3,Fri Mar 21 07:10:39 2014 UTC,"Only one X chromosome is active at any one time.  So this is a special case.   A man only has one X chromosome and so he only has one copy of the gene responsible for colorblindness.  So if he has the gene,  he will be colorblind.   A woman has two X chromosomes.   One of them needs to be inactivated, otherwise she'd have an entire chromosome of extra genes at work.   This would be bad (for example, see Down's syndrome).    The body evolved x linked inactivation to solve the problem.  All extra X chromosomes except one are 'turned off'.  So one copy of OP's colorblindness gene is silenced.  This is also why there can be people with XXX genomes.   So in your example, where the woman is a carrier,  some cells will have the 'normal' X chromosome inactivated and some will not (it's random).  If those cells go on to develop into an eye, you can have one colorblind eye and one normal. Same idea as people with different color eyes.   For OP,  it's even more interesting, because I would expect her maternal and paternal mutations to be somewhat different, so there could be a slight difference.  But it's all premised on a fluke of embryonic development.  Doesn't seem to have happened here."
ColorBlind,20ya8e,Skithiryx,2,Fri Mar 21 10:43:10 2014 UTC,"I was under the impression that X-Chromosome Chimerism wasn't that predictable - As in, the chance of activation is 50/50 per cell when mitosis occurs, not set when the ancestor cell is born.  If chimerism worked like you say I think we would see many more colourblind or colour deficient women."
ColorBlind,20ya8e,Drunken_Snail,1 point,Fri Mar 21 16:09:23 2014 UTC,"Interesting point.  I've been out of the genetics field for too long to give you an answer without doing some research,  which is not possible as I am at work.   However, I understand that this type of chimerism is responsible for callico cats, with each colour patch deriving from a different ancestral cell during development.   I could be wrong though.   Can you point me to something that says otherwise?"
ColorBlind,20ya8e,Skithiryx,2,Fri Mar 21 16:16:19 2014 UTC,"Did a little more reading. You're right, once an X is inactivated by an ancestor it stays inactivated in all its descendents.  I'm not familiar enough with the eye's development to say why we don't see more colourblind women. If all colour-sensing apparatus were derived from the same lyonized ancestor per eye then we should see 1/4 of all known single-X carriers be colourblind and 1/2 colourblind in one eye but not the other."
ColorBlind,20ya8e,Drunken_Snail,1 point,Fri Mar 21 16:36:47 2014 UTC,"Thanks.   Yes, I think the deep answer to your question as to why colorblindness chimerism is so rare lies in embryonic development.     The issue could be that the ancestral inactivation occurs even earlier than eye development itself (such as at the blastocyst or stage or shortly after gastrulation when the basic tissue layers are defined).   This would increase the likelihood that both eyes would develop from the same tissue layer.  This is just a theory.   I never studied embryonic development in great detail.   As for how the inactivation is inherited in the daughter cells, this would be an example of epigenetics at work (silenced chromosome begets silenced chromosome, until the whole thing is reset after meosis).   Thanks for the conversation.   You've reminded me of the good old days when I used to be a scientist."

I have a whole bunch of unrelated eye problems so medical professionals have been paying close attention to my vision since I was 2. When I was a kid I really liked art and coloring and I drew rainbows a lot because I thought they were pretty. I always had to look at the names on the markers to draw them correctly though and I thought I was kind of slow because I wasn't ""learning my colors"" as fast as the other kids were. We knew that my father definitely was colorblind so my eye doctor suggested that my entire family be tested for it. We went to a specialist who asked us separately to place these different colored blocks in a continuous color spectrum. As expected, my dad and I were completely hopeless. As not expected, my mom and brother were mildly colorblind too (although not anywhere near as me, my dad, and my dog =P)"

ColorBlind,20ya8e,pipertoma,1 point,Fri Mar 21 12:55:21 2014 UTC,"Lol. No genetic tests are done (kind of a waste to test for since it's a minor issue), but they do know how colorblindness is inherited. Colorblindness is a recessive trait which boys get one copy of the gene on the X chromosome and there is no corresponding gene on the Y chromosome. So, we say colorblindness is passed to boys through their mom's (who have them the colorblind recessive gene).   For a woman to be color blind she needs to get two colorblind genes, one on each X chromosome. So, a colorblind father passes his colorblind gene AND a mother who is a carrier (one recessive colorblind gene and one dominant normal gene, which makes mom normal sighted) passes the colorblind gene.  In my case I'm a rare female who has two recessive colorblind genes. So I will always pass a colorblind gene to my offspring. Since I had a boy he didn't receive a second gene so he will be colorblind. Any girls I have will be carriers of colorblindness but not colorblind themselves since my husband had the dominant normal gene."

ColorBlind,20ts50,isionous,10,Wed Mar 19 17:21:36 2014 UTC,"It's great to see you joining us.  I hope you have a pleasant and informative time.  You might want to read this previous comment of mine and some of the resources that it links to.  You might also want to download and tinker with Color Oracle, which will let you easily simulate deuteranopia on your computer screen.  The basic gist of it is that color-normal people have three cone types in their eye.  These cones being stimulated in different amounts leads to the variety of color sensations.  With three cone types, you would have a three-dimensional color space, one dimension for how much each cone type is stimulated.  Your cones do not detect the wavelengths of the photons hitting them.  Your cones have varied sensitivities to the wavelengths.  For instance, pure 580nm light will stimulate your S cone very little, and your M and L cone a fair amount.  A properly balanced combination of 540nm and 650nm light could generate the same cone stimulations, and thus would lead to the same color sensation as the 580nm light did.  Based on early neural processing of cone stimulations, it is useful to think of your color space as having the three axes {light-dark, yellow-blue, red-green}.  Your boyfriend has only two cone types (missing the M cone), and thus his color space only has the two axes {light-dark, yellow-blue}.  All differences in the red-green axis for you don't exist for him.  He basically sees the world as blues and yellows of various saturations and brightnesses.  I can explain more about cones or anything else if you want.  Feel free to ask anything, especially if I need to rephrase something to help with clarity."

ColorBlind,20ts50,F0sh,3,Thu Mar 20 03:12:07 2014 UTC,"They probably differ mainly in the amount of green light reflected by the object. Something you see as blue will have a colour spectrum including some amount of green light - more green and it will appear as a turquoise or cyan colour, but if there is not much then you will still call it blue. A little more or less green and you will see two shades of blue that are lighter or darker, rather than calling one blue and one turquoise.  But that distinction is difficult for your boyfriend to see because of his poorer ability at distinguishing shades of green. All that's going on is that some of the information that goes into the shade of a colour is contained in the amount of green in that colour. If there's not enough difference in all the other components, it can look the same to a colourblind person."
ColorBlind,20ts50,isionous,2,Wed Mar 19 17:36:50 2014 UTC,"Thank you for responding.  So, is it more likely that he would be able to distinguish between colours that say had only a variation in the amount of blue light because his deficiency is mainly green?"

ColorBlind,20ts50,isionous,2,Thu Mar 20 00:06:54 2014 UTC,"But that distinction is difficult for your boyfriend to see because of his poorer ability at distinguishing shades of green. All that's going on is that some of the information that goes into the shade of a colour is contained in the amount of green in that colour.   I think what you're saying stems from a common misconception that mistakenly ties each cone type to a particular ""primary color"" and also over-simplifies the visible light spectrum into three ""primary color"" regions.  Greens are not especially problematic for deuteranopes - it's all hues that depend on the relative excitation of the M and L cones that would exist in a color-normal.  Reds, oranges, yellows, greens, and browns all collapse into the same hue sensation.  Also, various blues and violets collapse into another hue sensation.  Cyans and fuchsias can also lead to a gray sensation."
ColorBlind,20ts50,F0sh,1 point,Thu Mar 20 02:14:56 2014 UTC,"Well, it is a simplification, but deuteranomalous people do have lower sensitivity in the region of the spectrum called 'green'.

ColorBlind,20ts50,isionous,1 point,Thu Mar 20 09:44:45 2014 UTC,"Well, it is a simplification, but deuteranomalous people do have lower sensitivity in the region of the spectrum called 'green'.   There is a difference between spectral sensitivity and hue discrimination ability.  For instance, from a sensitivity perspective (likelihood of a given photon generating a cone response), we are fairly insensitive to low wavelengths (like 450nm), but this turned around by visual processing such that low wavelength light has a disproportionately large impact on color sensation.  A deuteranope's hue confusion is not due to a decrease in sensitivity to a certain wavelength span.  It is due to having a stimulus space with only two dimensions rather than three.   You also haven't given a more detailed, less simplified explanation of the phenomenon asked about, where colours that appear the same hue and different shades to a colour-normal person appear indistinguishable to a colourblind person.

My invitation for you to give an alternative explanation was just that - as it stands you've just given an explanation of deuteranopia, not why such a person might be unable to distinguish shades of the same hue. Maybe there is something complex going on that I don't know about which would give rise to reduced discrimination of shades of the same hue. But since a deuteranope does have reduced sensitivity in the green section of the spectrum, and I don't know of any other explanations, that still seems most likely to me."

First, I have difficulty seeing the difference between yellow and red lights.  I had no difficulty whatsoever with the colors chosen in this survey, so there's that.  I feel like the colors could have been closer, and it would have been helpful if they had a luminosity to them like a light so that they would be harder to see.  Secondly, as much as the whole shape thing would help, I feel like it's going to be the hardest change to implement.  You're talking an overhaul of how the traffic light is made to begin with, which means changing the manufacturing process, as well as installing them across the country, which most cities will outright refuse to do.  In my opinion, the only change that I think is necessary are those reflective borders you see on some traffic lights.  Lets you know if the light is yellow or red because red is on top.  The reason I think this is the way to go is purely based on cost efficiency and the ability to make the change to existing traffic lights.  To clarify, I like the project, and wish her the best of luck, but as a colorblind person who's put a lot of thought into this, those are my best suggestions for making it take off as an idea.  In science fairs, they don't just like good ideas, they like interesting experiments that have real-world applications, and if you can show that you've put thought into how to implement a change for the lowest cost-highest reward, that really goes a long way with the judges."

I don't like yield for yellow because it implies yielding and that's not what the yellow light means.  It means 'stop if safe to do so.'
ColorBlind,20jnjn,autowikibot,2,Sun Mar 16 22:49:26 2014 UTC,"Section 28. Unusual traffic light designs of article  Traffic-light signalling and operation:       The Canadian provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island generally use horizontal traffic lights with red to the left and green to the right. These signals also use specific shapes for each color, which aids color-blind people in distinguishing signal aspects:   green – an ordinary ""ball"" shape, yellow – a diamond shape, and red – a square (somewhat larger than the ball shape).   In Quebec, most horizontal traffic lights have a red signal on both sides of the fixture (left and right). They are also now replacing the shaped traffic lights for color-blind people with regular round signals.  Some signals have two red lights, one on each end.  In some Texas urban areas including Houston and Dallas, the use of a double red light is different. It is typically used on left turn signals. For horizontally mounted signals, typically hung or mounted over the lanes, it is configured with two red balls or arrows, one yellow arrow or ball, and a green arrow (from left to right). For vertically mounted signals, the two red balls or arrows are on the top, then a yellow arrow or ball, and a green arrow. It is usually accompanied by signs saying ""left turn signal"" or ""left on arrow only"". Signals for traffic going straight use standard signals, usually mounted horizontally over the road. The use of two red lights on the left turn signal allows for redundancy in case one of the red lights burns out, while saving money by requiring only one signal for left turns per direction that needs one. It also prevents the yellow trap that would occur at night if a single red signal burned out, and left-turning vehicles obeyed the circular signals instead.  One type of installation in Texas uses a double red light instead of a single red light to make the red light more pronounced and visible from a distance. In this installation, it is the first traffic light on a rural highway for miles, and traffic approaches at highway speed (65 mph). The double red light makes the red phase of the light visible at a greater distance than the yellow and green on the same signal. This installation is also used on rural highways in California, always in a vertical configuration.  The double-red light also makes an appearance in North Carolina in left-hand turn lanes. It serves the same purpose as the vertical Texan configuration, and mainly appears on boulevards with multiple lanes of traffic where a left turn may become catastrophic due to visibility. Double red arrows are used for left turn installations on some county-managed roads in Henrico County, Virginia and Baltimore County, Maryland.  The double-red ball aspect is used in Saskatchewan and Alberta, Canada, to indicate a protected-prohibited left turn signal. A sign with the universal no left turn symbol and a depiction of the double red light is mounted near the signal to indicate that no left turns are permitted on a double-red light. Intersections with this configuration are quite common in Saskatoon, Calgary, and Edmonton.  Tianjin in the People's Republic of China has two very special systems of traffic lights, in use since c. 2000:   One system is where there is a horizontal bar in a specific colour, with the colour changing and the bar shrinking. The shrinking bar indicates the time remaining in that colour. The colour itself is either red (stop), yellow or green (go). A blinking green one-third-full bar means ""reduce speed now"", and a blinking yellow full-bar indicates ""proceed with caution"".   When lights of this system turn from green to red, the diminishing green bar will flash once two-thirds (note: not the full bar) of the green bar is ""eaten up"", with the remaining third intact. A full, uninterrupted yellow bar will appear for a few seconds before, after a short blink, lights turn red. Immediately after the full red bar appears, a tiny (almost unnoticeable) split/division appears to signify the bit that will not be ""eaten up"". This corresponds to the usual position of a red light (leftmost, or rightmost if at the other end of the road and at the other side of the pavement; or the upper third). When two-thirds of the red bit is ""eaten up"", the red light extinguishes, only to be replaced nearly immediately with a full chunk of green (again with the minute division). The process then repeats itself.   Another system, which is also common in the other cities in China, is where there is a set of three lights as traffic lights. Every light is an arrow pointing in a different direction and every arrow has a colour of its own, to show whether traffic flow is permitted or prohibited in that direction.   The major disadvantage of this system of traffic light is that it is unfamiliar to those who are used to seeing specific colours of the traffic lights at the various ends of a normal traffic light itself (e.g. green rightmost, red leftmost, etc.) as well is being problematic for the color blind (although by Chinese traffic laws, people who are color blind are not permitted to drive). It does, however, conserve space. The other disadvantage of it is it does not have indication of when a turn can be made without yielding and when the turn can made only after yielding to the oncoming traffic. Although by Chinese traffic laws, turning is always supposed to be made after yielding to oncoming traffic.  Elsewhere in China, a blinking green light means ""reduce speed now"", attempting to stop cars from passing (if that car can still safely stop in time) and is nearly universal in appearance. Some cities or parts of cities show the number of seconds remaining in a specific traffic light colour (a so-called ""countdown meter"").  Another type of signal that can be found in China is the Unilight signal that displays all three colours in one signal section.

I can't see the difference between green lights and regular street lights, so sometimes at night I don't even know that there's an intersection ahead until it changes. If there's any light that needs a different, non-round shape, it's GREEN."
ColorBlind,20jnjn,truthcopy,1 point,Mon Mar 17 10:25:41 2014 UTC,"This is interesting, although the individual colors were not reflective of the true colors of traffic lights... so that may skew the data somewhat.  I can tell the color of lights by their position, and generally know looking at a light whether it is red, green or yellow. Where I have trouble is with single flashers that can be red or yellow. Often it's hard at a distance for me to tell the difference, because I don't have any reference point.   These kinds of tests would be far more revealing.  The problem with a test like this is there's no way to measure how accurate each user's screen reproduces color.   Either way, I'll still be interested to see the results.

My favorite examples are Super Puzzle Fighter II(bad) and Puzzle Bobble/Bust-a-Move(great).  The yellow and green are indistinguishable for me in SPFII and the blocks have plenty of real estate for some form of shape/pattern. Puzzle Bobble puts different Bubble Bobble enemies in each circle and the later ones even have custom animations per piece.  Puyo Puyo is somewhere in between because there are several colors I can't distinguish.  The pieces have different eyes while they are falling so I can decipher which is which but once the pieces join together their eyes all change to the same style so it renders the difference ineffective.  Thanks for taking the time to make sure that those of us with trouble would be able to enjoy your game.

People with normal color vision have three types of ""cone"" cells in their eyes. Cone cells detect color, rod cells detect light and dark.  We'll call those three types of normal cones red, green, and blue. The blue cone detects a short wavelength light. The red and green cones detect longer wavelengths of light, and substantially overlap.   Like /u/tenkadaiichi said, if you're missing you're green cone, you can still see a range of colors. But, because you've only got one cone cell covering that range, your ability to distinguish between colors in that range is diminished. So, and this is oversimplifying things, you can see the red component of the color, and the blue component, but have a harder time seeing the green component.   It's called red-green color blindness because that's the area of the spectrum you have trouble distinguishing between, not because you cannot see red or green."
ColorBlind,1zgv15,isionous,1 point,Mon Mar 3 22:42:31 2014 UTC,"Perhaps you see things that you equate with being red or green because you have been taught that things that look like this are either red or green, but your ability to differentiate colour between different things is severely impaired. (This is the point of the dot tests. They specifically use hues that we cannot discern the difference of)  My mother bought a blue van several years ago. Imagine my shock when people told me that it was actually green. I still have no explanation for this, as my understanding of my problem is that I have difficulty seeing red within other colours.  However, given the van example, it seems that I would be deuteranomalous because the other, lesser colour in the paint was overshadowing the green for me.  Also, ""red green"" colourblind is a misnomer and does not mean that we cannot see the difference between red and green. There are two subtypes.  1) Deuter- means that you have difficulty seeing green.  2) Prot- means that you have difficulty seeing red."
ColorBlind,1zgv15,isionous,2,Mon Mar 3 22:27:15 2014 UTC,"1) Deuter- means that you have difficulty seeing green.  2) Prot- means that you have difficulty seeing red.   Those terms mean something else.  They refer to which cone is either abnormal or missing from your retina.  The M and L cones have a high amount of overlap in the spectral sensitivity distributions and it is highly flawed to think of them as ""green and red cones"".  The peak sensitivity of the L cone is actually at ~570nm, which in typical conditions leads to a yellowish-green sensation.   Also, ""red green"" colourblind is a misnomer and does not mean that we cannot see the difference between red and green. There are two subtypes   There are three neural channels of {light-dark, yellow-blue, red-green} in some of the earliest visual processing.  Red-green colorblindness means that the red-green channel or at least one of its inputs (such as the M and L cones) is ""deficient"" in a person."

For instance, deuteranomaly means that the person has an abnormal M cone type that has a spectral sensitivity distribution that is abnormally similar to the L cone type.  Hue discrimination uses the difference in cone type excitations.  An anomalous trichromat has a compressed color space because the differences in cone excitations is less than normal."

ColorBlind,1zg9n3,h2g2Ben,10,Mon Mar 3 18:47:05 2014 UTC,"I'd google and read up on color blindness a bit. There are a few things going on right now.   Over time, you've trained yourself to identify certain shades as red or green.  There are a lot of shades, though, that you can't distinguish, and don't realize you can't distinguish.  This is evident in those colored dot tests. People with normal vision can easily identify those numbers and letters hidden in the tests. Buy a box of 64 crayons. Just looking at the tops, try to pull out plain red, or plain green. See how many tries it takes you. Now give the box to someone with normal color vision.   Most of the time you see shades in nature you're seeing off-red and off-green. Shades in the area where you can tell them apart. The times when you can't tell them apart, you probably aren't realizing it yet.  Over time, if you pay attention, you'll start to be able to identify shades that fall in what I call my neutral spot. That area when I know I'm looking at a color, but I can't tell if it's red or green, dark blue or purple, or light gray or pink."

Anomalous trichromats are considered ""red-green colorblind"" but still have a red-green axis in their color space.  edit:  You might also like this comment and the things it links to.  edit2:  Most people have three cones: S, M, L (short, medium, long).  Excitations of these cones lead to color sensations.  One of the axes of the human color space is the red-green axis, which depends on the difference between M and L cone excitations.  For instance, light of a given intensity at 650nm excites L cones much more than M cones.  A person with deuteranomaly has M cones that are abnormally similar to L cones in how sensitive the cone is to light at each wavelength.  So, since the M and L cone are abnormally similar, that means you'd get smaller differences between the M and L cone excitations.  To a color-normal person, I can show them two lights that are slightly different in composition, and they can tell the difference (due to different cone excitations), but for a deuteranomalous person, the difference can be too small for them to reliably distinguish the two light mixtures.  If I make the two light mixtures more different, the deuteranomalous person can start reliably distinguishing them because their cone excitations are now different enough.  And that's why a person who is called ""red-green colorblind"" can do fine in distinguishing a very bright and saturated red from a very bright and saturated green, but they run into trouble when the colors are dark or desaturated."

No. Two kinds of cone cells are in principle sufficient to distinguish between all the different monochromatic (one single frequency of light) hues.  If you look at a chart showing how human color receptors respond to different frequencies of light (for example here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cones_SMJ2_E.svg ), you can see the logic. Any individual frequency you choose on that chart will give you a different combination of cone responses, even if you remove the green cones (which is the most common form of colorblindness). It is true however that colors in the green range will be more difficult to distinguish, because the response of the blue cones is really dropping off in that range. However, definitive tests of red-green colorblindness don't use monochromatic hues. They will typically contrast something with a blue-green color with something else that has a sort of red-brown color. These mixed hues are chosen to yield the same pair of responses from the blue and red cones, so that only someone with functioning green cones will be able to distinguish them.

It is one of the least severe types I think.  I guess I am guilty of making a joke out of it here and there.

ColorBlind,1yknjh,Stitchopoulis,1 point,Sat Feb 22 04:21:55 2014 UTC,"So, colorblindness is a genetic trait, like hair or eye color. The interesting thing about it is that it's what's known as an ""X-linked"" trait. You know how a person's sex is defined by whether they have 2 X chromosomes, or an X and a Y, well it turns out there is more than just sex on those chromosomes. They get their name from their shape, the X chromosome looks like an X, and the Y looks the same, but it's missing one of the arms. That arm that's missing, in addition to ""if there's 2 of these make a vagina and uterus and all those other sex-linked characteristics"" also has the instructions for color vision. If you refer to it as a mutation, make sure your kids are reading X-Men already.  If you get colorblindness on one X chromosome, but normal color vision on the other, 3 things happen: You're a girl (because 2 X chromosomes), you (likely) have normal color vision (thanks to the backup on the other X chromosome) and when you have kids one or the other X chromosome will get passed to your children.  If a woman with colorblindness on both X chromosomes has kids, all of her children will have an X chromosome with colorblindness on it. If any of those children are boys, that one X chromosome they have is colorblind, with no backup.  So women can be carriers for colorblindness, without actually being colorblind. But colorblind women, all their sons are colorblind.  In terms of being offensive, I'd say don't even bring it up. Let the kid know there's nothing wrong with them, they just see things different. Let the kid determine when a joke is appropriate. Also, bring up the fact that camouflage doesn't work the same on colorblind people, we can pick hidden things out pretty quick, like a superpower, which is why colorblind people were photographers in WWII, camouflaged military installations were easy to pick out. You know, throw a rose in with the thorns of colorblindness. I've also found that my low light vision was better than most of my friends, but I'm not sure if that's colorblindness or luck."

For colourblind people colour is often the last differentiating factor they will turn to in any given situation.

As far as I'm concerned, this is 4 times as important as the initial flashing light but, seeing as no color change has been perceived by me, no information has exchanged between the lamps and myself.  Also of note, there was no pedestrian in the crosswalk at any time during this whole event.  Then, the top lights started flashing back and forth.

ColorBlind,1ydbpc,nupanick,2,Wed Feb 19 19:55:42 2014 UTC,"HAWK beacon:       A HAWK beacon (High-Intensity Activated crossWalK beacon) is a traffic signal used to stop road traffic and allow pedestrians to cross safely. It is officially known as a ""pedestrian hybrid beacon"". The purpose of a HAWK beacon is to allow protected pedestrian crossings, stopping road traffic only as needed. Research has shown motorists' compliance with the HAWK beacon at up to 97%, higher than with traditional un-signaled crossings.   The design of the HAWK beacon was imported from Europe, where the configuration has been used at railway level crossings, and was adapted in America for the purpose of pedestrian crossings without consulting any colorblind drivers who could have reminded them of the Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Until December 2009, the HAWK beacon was categorized as an experimental device in the United States. Highway agencies wishing to use a HAWK signal were required to obtain approval from the Federal Highway Administration, as well as collect and submit data on the effectiveness of the device. The first beacon was developed in Tucson, Arizona by Transportation Administrator R. B. Nassi, P.E., Ph.D., and installed in 2000. The bird name HAWK was suggested by his wife to continue the tradition of naming pedestrian crossings (as in the United Kingdom) with bird names. It was included in the 2009 edition of the US Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices as the ""pedestrian hybrid beacon.""

ColorBlind,1y2y6g,EnChroma,1 point,Wed Mar 5 19:23:35 2014 UTC,"I am intrigued by this response...  Any lens (EnChroma included) can only modify the light in 2 ways; transmission or reflection.  They are tinted to limit certain frequencies to be transmitted through the lens and can also have reflective coatings to reflect certain frequencies of light away prior to transmission.  One product might have better optimized tints for particular CVD needs, but surely all lenses that are not neutral grey will be ""trading one color deficiency for another""?"
ColorBlind,1y2y6g,pipertoma,1 point,Sun Mar 30 22:19:13 2014 UTC,"Exactly, you caught the key issue re: maintaining a neutral white point. Our lenses do this while correcting CVD due to their complex construction, which is primarily based upon reflectance. This is the main feature.  We find it fairly difficult to market it this way, particularly to color vision normals: nobody walks into a store looking for glasses which maintain the white point. Yeah you can buy Oakley lenses that do all kinds of things, and they have fantastic marketing about these benefits over a regular grey lens. But they all come at a spectral ""cost."" Your eye is just going to normalize most of the benefits away if you do not maintain the white point; it is what the visual system does throughout the day as lighting conditions change."

It's an interesting view that there's a broader audience one can consider but, personally, I wouldn't compare it to a different language but maybe more a limitation of a language so the efforts would be saying the same things with less words.  I've pretty much exclusively ' got shit ' any time I even hinted that this is something I'm dealing with at work. The people ( to be honest I can only recall one person at the moment ) that opened up to me only did so out of sympathy because I came into these negative situations that they became aware of. Maybe it's just a games thing (although I've noticed a post about Starbound having a colour blind mode, I'm sure there are others ), maybe I was just unlucky, even with the great employers but working in a close nit group with a strong demand to deliver leaves so much room to trip up. I'd be laughed at if I had to ask someone what a certain colour is because I'm mostly asking people for whom it is the most natural thing to see their work ' properly '.  Wouldn't a professional conductor or musician be at a significant disadvantage if they would have a skewed or damaged perception of the sound waves that are dealing with ?  /u/theaggressivenapkin , how much time do you think you ' loose ' by having to compensate ? Do you think it's much of a distraction from the work you'd rather be focusing on ? It's often in the back of my mind.

A daughter receives one X chromosome from her mother, and one from her father. If she (the daughter) is colorblind, both the X chromosomes must have the colorblind mutation. The mutated X chromosome she received from her father is a copy of his only X chromosome, so he does not have a non-mutated version, and is therefore colorblind. But the mother gave her daughter a copy of one of her two X chromosomes. The one she didn't give to her daughter may not have the mutation.  Incidentally: The sons of a carrier mother each have a 50% chance of being colorblind, since they are equally likely to receive a copy of either the mutated or un-mutated X chromosome."

Your sons will only get an X from their mother, so your being colorblind is irrelevant to them: Like their sisters, they will only be colorblind iff their mother gives them an X with a mutation.   If you have children with a colorblind woman: All your children will be colorblind. If you have children with a carrier woman: Each of your children has a 50% of being colorblind.

Unfortunately dividing hues into yurgs, blurgs, and grays can be tricky if you want to accurately categorize hues from a red-green colorblind perspective.  To color-normals, pink is an unsaturated red, thus it'd be tempting to say, ""pink is a desaturated red, and is thus a yurg"".  But for a red-green colorblind person, pinks can easily be lead to a gray or even a slightly blue-ish sensation.  So, you could have a color-normal say that some pink ball is yurg, and a colorblind person say it's gray.  So, not a perfect system unless you explicitly define yurg and blurg as how a red-green colorblind person would.  I would love to see the conversations then:  ""Joe, is this ball yurg?""

Colorblindness seems to vary in degree. I know quite a few colorblind people and we all seem to see things a bit different. A good friend of mine from when I was in the military was technically color blind, but never had any issues with colors, but always failed the ishihara dot test."
ColorBlind,1x8mo8,colorblindme,1 point,Fri Feb 7 15:59:52 2014 UTC,"Like the two colors next to each other I can see there is a different color but it's hard to distinguish which is which and if it's just one color by itself it's me guessing what color it is.   Yes, as someone who is colorblind, you experience a color space that is compressed compared to color-normal people.  This compression means that the differences between colors are much smaller for you.   But the thing is I feel like I can see the difference between red and green.   You probably can when the red and green are bright, saturated, and occupy a large portion of your field of view.  In those conditions, hue discrimination is at its easiest.  If we make the task harder by making the red and green darker, less saturated, and smaller in your field of view, you'd quickly start having a harder time.  Colorblind people often complain that they have problems with browns more than other colors.  The reason is that brown is a dark, desaturated color.   So what does it mean to be strong protan I guess is my question, and is my experience normal or am I extra messed up?    You might enjoy reading...   Free, easy-to-read book covering the basics of colorblindness Bruce MacEvoy's page on colorblindness and his other wonderful pages on color vision in general. Article and interactive demo of color confusion lines, which might help you grasp how red-green colorblindness affects perception of all hues, like purple and blue.   I think reading at least one of first two items will give you a lot of insight into colorblindness.  Best of luck to you."

We merged the different products for protans and deutans into the Cx in November- we adapted the spectrum to work equally well for both.  We are running a pricing experiment to see what kind of demand we would see if we could make and sell them for a lower price. If we can raise enough in investment we will have Rx lenses, Strong Protan lenses, childrens lenses and all kind of goodies starting in May or June at this kind of price.  We are sort of extending it on a day by day basis because it is working pretty well, but we haven't actually dropped our cost of manufacturing yet so not sure how long it will last."

ColorBlind,1wziq3,EnChroma,7,Thu Feb 6 00:34:19 2014 UTC,"Well short answer they actually work- this isnt just a placebo effect or industry marketing job repackaging tints. (tints are 100% of the market) I can see your skepticism but ""I can see a rainbow now, the color of my kid's eyes, and the traffic signal is green not white"" is a bit different than ""It sounds much crisper"" in terms of  controlling for placebo or substituting other goods. We actually feel the opposite effect occurs in CVD explaining why not to buy: ""there is nothing wrong with me, I am just fine and whatever I am 'missing out on' apparently I just don't need."" The reviews you see are people who made that leap.  Our lenses have the first digitally controlled spectrum- we make them in the machines used to coat optics for satellites. Tinted lenses made on eyeglass lens machines can only adjust the spectrum really broadly, ie warmer or cooler. When you can control the spectrum like we do (400-800nm, 0-100% opacity @1nm) you have a direct interface into the human visual processing system, and this effect is crazy strong; enough to do things like fix most peoples color blindness.  So the product is really different than other lenses, we tried the best tints and they were not able to do anything interesting. $200 will barely get you an anti-reflective coated pair of Rx lenses so basically you are saying you perceive no extra value. But yeah, it is totally possible that most people feel like you even with color blindness and we should make something else. This is what we are trying to figure out right now. Hopefully you are just not an early adopter here."

Personally, if the colour isn't trying to imply meaning (like purple vs blue for links visited and unvisited*) then if it looks good to a normal person, it'll look fine to me.  *I have a custom stylesheet that I use which changes visited links to a dark green instead of purple."

Colored socks: what a pain in the butt.  If you're going to buy him colored socks, make sure that there is some other indicator so he can tell them apart.  Too many times in the office, I've heard, ""Did you know you're wearing one navy sock and one black?""  NO. No, I did not.  Because they have the exact same weave, to me, they were the same.  So, maybe the blue socks have a deep ridged weave and the black socks have no ridges and the dark brown socks have a striped toe or something.  And, lastly, some foods look repulsive?

He won't know any difference and it's not like one ""missing color"" is being swapped for something else entirely. His hamburger won't look like a banana. If he won't eat something because he doesn't like the way it looks, it's probably just him being a kid and being picky.  Green coat for him? I wouldn't worry about it. Again, it's not going to look pink to him. It's just going to look a little different to him than it does to you. But he won't know any difference anyway.  As a kid, I thought it was sort of neat because it made me a bit different and not everyone had it. The hereditary and genetic aspects were interesting. Even when I was little to know that I have it because my mom's father had it and my mom was just a carrier. My grandfather wasn't alive when I was born, but I imagine it would have been a neat thing to bond over when I was a little kid.  As a boy, clothes matching is definitely less of an issue. Everything goes with jeans. As an adult, formal wear like slacks are probably black and go with any color shirt. Matching a tie might be tougher so it doesn't hurt to bring mom, girlfriend, or a friend to get a second opinion. He'll be happy for the input, and they probably don't want to see him looking like a goof either.  What other's have said is spot on. Let teachers know. I found out in 1st grade (6 years old) when I went for glasses because I couldn't see the blackboard. It all clicked and made sense at that point as to why my teachers accused my parents of not helping out at home teach colors and lifted some of the guilt they had and slight concern with my intellectual development. Everything else was just fine as I was a smart kid but colors be damned. I can't recall which exactly, but some colored chalk on chalk boards was tough. Whiteboards - no problems.  It's tough to remember for you sometimes that he might have issues as he gets older and maybe helps around the house. At times my parents would get frustrated or annoyed when they would tell me to go get the ""green xyz"" or something.   He'll get annoyed that when he mentions to someone that he has a color deficiency that everyone within earshot will then proceed to ask him what color everything is in the room. He'll find his own way to deal with. It gets old, I explain what it means briefly and then say I won't tell you what color your shirt is because you probably already know that. Or people usually know me to be pretty sarcastic and like to joke already so they laugh when I say, ""why do I have to prove my 'handicap' to you - you don't ask the guy in the wheelchair to standup to prove he can't""  He won't be a pilot, an astronaut, an electrician, or on the bomb squad. Kinda stinks to learn you can't be a fighter pilot when you're 6 but there's plenty of other really cool things you can do when you grow up.  Really, though. It's not a big deal. He'll be just fine. I like to joke about my ""handicap"" but really, I have 4 functioning limbs, and all my other senses so I'm just fine and and grateful that I didn't come out like something else. It hardly impacts me day-to-day."

ColorBlind,1uzw8u,isionous,1 point,Sun Jan 12 07:52:26 2014 UTC,"Sounds like you have anomalous trichromacy, most likely deuteranomaly or protanomaly.  The way human color vision works, you can not have a problem with just one or two colors.  An anomalous trichromat has a compressed color space that is different across all hues from a normal human color space.  You can certainly have a lot more trouble with certain color categories than others.  For instance, a lot of deuteranomalous and protanomalous people say they have the most problem distinguishing colors that others would describe as brown and green.  Their hue discrimination is weaker than normal across all hues, but their hue confusion is most apparent for browns and greens (and often oranges, yellows, and reds, especially if they are dark and/or desaturated).  Note how I used the term ""color categories"" because colors smoothly vary, and we communicate with labels that are fairly arbitrary and can easily fool us into thinking that colors easily fall into distinct and obvious bins.  As it turns out, ""brown"" is just a dark and desaturated yellow or orange, yet we have a special word for it because brown is so common and useful to have a label for it."

ColorBlind,1unr6p,isionous,7,Tue Jan 7 23:21:14 2014 UTC,"\1: When doing simulations of deuteranopia and protanopia, the picture seemed to collapse from a ragged medley of colors to a blue-ish 56 and a gray background.  This leads me to believe that the picture was designed with hue-distraction so that colorblindness helps to see the 56.  \2: With some pictures that are supposed to be tricky for color-normal people but obvious for colorblind people, your monitor can make a huge difference.  There have been people where I showed them a trick picture on their computer, and the hidden figure was actually quite obvious with their monitor.  I feel the same thing is going on here; the color-normal people who see the 56 are possibly being helped by a monitor with slightly-off color balance (which includes even looking at a LCD monitor at an oblique angle).  \3: When I first looked at the image, I thought there was a possible pattern in the fuchsia-color wisps.  I figured that it was a 56 or maybe 58.  The color-normals that see the 56 might just be good at teasing out the pattern that is obscured by use of varying hues."

ColorBlind,1unr6p,Drunken_Snail,2,Tue Jan 7 22:55:50 2014 UTC,"You and your brother share the same X chromosome defect and so your color blindness is exactly the same between the two of you.   I have two colorblind brothers and its the same for me as well in that my brothers and I all see the world in the exact same messed up way.   It's an interesting quirk of genetics caused by the X linked inheritance of the trait,  which you both inherited from your mother.   As for your teacher (and everyone else who is colorblind)  unless they are related to you, chances are that their colorblindness is a little bit different than yourself.   There are many different forms of colorblindness,  each caused by a different mutation (or combination of mutations).    Even if you generalize people in to protanopes and deuteranopes,  there are still minor variations depending on what specific allele you inherited.  Each allele shifts your colour perception one way or another, and it's the fact that it's not ""normal"" that makes you ""blind"" to color.  That being said,  I saw the 56 right away and I'm r/g colorblind.  Looks like magenta on white to me,  and the edges are not very crisp.  But it's easier to see when you tell people what they are looking for (even if you don't say what number it is).   Anyways, the genetics of color blindness are fascinating because it's an example of X-linked inheritance."

ColorBlind,1unr6p,ithinkmynameismoose,2,Wed Jan 8 02:39:42 2014 UTC,"Not everyone who is colorblind knows that they are colorblind.   I only got my diagnosis at age 16.   On top of that, what we call ""normal"" vision is just a statistical average.   There are subtle variations around the average which can subtly change perception.  It's just like any other trait,  such as eye color, hair color,  or height.  For example, although most people have a ""normal"" sense of smell,  some people are more sensitive to particular smells than others.   Genetics is all about variation and averages.   It's what drives evolution!"

ColorBlind,1ug5yb,Jattok,4,Sun Jan 5 07:54:54 2014 UTC,There's already this symbol set for representing colors that has gained some traction.  Unfortunately it is orientation dependent (ex: the red symbol is a 180 degree rotation of the blue symbol).  Your symbol set so far has the advantage that all the symbols are unique under rotation.
ColorBlind,1ug5yb,isionous,3,Sun Jan 5 09:22:23 2014 UTC,"That's what I was hoping to avoid. And besides the circle, I didn't want any simple shapes (even the circle I thought of nixing). I wanted to make sure that they could be read from any orientation, be readily identified between each other (so no curved-edged square and hard-edged square, for example), and be able to be bisected without being confused with another shape.  Thanks for the feedback!"

ColorBlind,1ucjud,SharkBaitDLS,3,Sat Jan 4 01:33:29 2014 UTC,"From the faq:   The EnChroma lens is not designed for use with a computer display, however it does provide good color rendering in combination with most display technologies including LED-backlit, plasma and OLED display technology. Since the EnChroma lens is not polarized, there are no orientation issues related to reading of such displays that incorporate polarization filters.   Of course, a lot of LED's have a higher CRI (color rendering index  which approximates how close the light source is to sunlight) than ccfl's so that may be why they work better.   The Puck Q12W is an RGBW LED that has a CRI 90, but I haven't found monitors that list specifications for their LEDs."
ColorBlind,1ucjud,NerosNeptune,2,Sat Jan 4 02:31:34 2014 UTC,"I have a Dell S2240L LED backlit monitor. I hadn't even tried this out because they say on their website and the info that comes with the glasses that they're only really intended for outdoor use and natural daylight.   I put the glasses on and about 30 minutes later can definitely tell some difference. It isn't perfect though. For one thing, the edges of the glasses seem to be a little different than the center (Maybe Enchroma can chime in on why?). Whenever I turn or tilt my head for any reason I can definitely tell the part of the screen in my perhiphery looks wonky (turning my head to take a bite of my sandwich, or if I need to look down at the keyboard). Not a huge issue but it's noticable.. as long as your head is straight it looks fine. If you have dual monitors this would be a bigger problem I think.  Other than that I do notice some of the same effects I notice when I use them outside. Keep in mind though that the glasses aren't perfect. When I take the enchroma test, I still test as mild deutan (they say this plainly when you start the test, but of course I had to try myself!). I tried watching a league of legends video on youtube since I normally can't tell the teams apart when the game isn't on colorblind mode.. I still couldn't really tell the blue and purple teams apart.   Thankfully, I don't notice anything like what you mention with digital billboards. I've noticed that with certain time/temp displays on buildings, too. I thought maybe I'd been seeing them COMPLETELY wrong, but I had someone confirm that it was actually supposed to be white."
ColorBlind,1ucjud,murfbard,1 point,Tue Jan 7 17:55:24 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I have a dual monitor setup currently, and I notice the periphery looks strange; however, I will see that when driving (like looking in the rearview mirror without turning my head).  I don't expect similar quality to what I experience outside given that reproducing sunlight-like light is hard enough, and it seems that a lot of people just settle for lights that look 'decent.'  You have an IPS panel which gives you better viewing angles so that should also help around the edges more so than the setups I have at work and home.  The digital billboards looked yellowish while paper still looked white. With glasses off, billboards looked white to me, and wife also reports them as white, so definitely feel like it is due to a cheaper display."

EDIT: As far as teachers and sports go, just make sure they understand. Especially in early schooling (Pre-K-2nd) they may have lessons on color, so you'll want his teachers to know he's color blind so they can work with him accordingly. Throughout Middle school and High school, I failed plenty of assignments that involved colors or color coding.   Also, unless you MUST disclose that information, don't go out of your way to inform people. In my experience (this may be different for some people, this is just what I've seen) when you let normal sighted people know you can't see colors, they immediately limit you.   When I first joined the Navy, I told NO ONE I was color blind. I was able to get a medical position (which I do very well in) but during the course of time, it came up I was color blind. Had I let them know upon joining, I would've never gotten the job I do now. My color blindness has never negatively impacted my performance, and I love what I do!  Now for sports, I see no reason why he can't play. I never had any issues with colors in sports, but just be open with him, and make sure he isn't struggling.

ColorBlind,1tpxwg,actuallyatwork,5,Thu Dec 26 18:01:12 2013 UTC,"Hi there,  I am kind of immersed indirectly in child development research AND am red/green color-blind.  Growing up my older brothers and sister, and even my parents pushed me to try to 'learn to overcome it' and would constantly ask me what color things were. Honestly, as a kid it was stressful and made me feel bad because, as we all know, it's about as effective as telling a blind person to look harder or a deaf person to listen harder.  So, don't do that.  Also, don't make it a disability.  Just something special about them.  For example; because colors are more muted in my eyes, I seem to have the ability to spot faces in a crowd quicker than anyone I know.  I think it's because I am just focusing on the 'shape' of the face and not the coloring.  Also, in the woods, I can spot animals quickly while hunting.  Not too much of an advantage for a 3 year old.. but.. maybe you can see if he's got some knack that other kids don't.  Now if he's got the kind that has 'no' colors, then consider that his brain is freed up from having to process all those extra colors.  Seriously.  The neurological impact of not having to process color information and categorize it in pattern recognition is removed.  He will likely have better night vision, better movement detection and eye-hand coordination.  Also, visual memory is likely to be more detailed.  There's not a ton of research on this, but it makes sense if you think about it.. so I suspect there's something to it.  As for day-to-day living, it probably is useful for them to know that colors exist and that some apples are red, some are green.  Red-lights means stop but ALSO that red lights are always on the top or left (For safety). And like someone else said, don't color code things without also using shapes.  But mostly, as a toddler, don't spend a lot of energy on it with them, there's a lot more to do.  It's not really that much of a disability.  Sure, he probably won't be an astronaut but perhaps he can be a designer or engineer and help with the movement from the red/green design default for aerospace (which is dumb anyway! :) )  Have fun! 3 year olds are awesome.

A lot of times color is simply used to denote difference and being able to identify the color itself isn't a big deal.  Example: stoplights - I'm very much red/green colorblind but to me stoplight green is almost white it's so light and the red is deeper and clearly not yellow so it's never been an issue.

In a painting class in high school I had a TA help me mix skin tones because I couldn't do it myself.  In a high school global studies class I had to get assistance from the teacher because the key used by the book used slightly different blues to distinguish something on a map.  That is the extent of it. Just make sure he knows he can tell the teacher that he can't distinguish colors if it becomes an issue. In the first few grades, since coloring is often used, it might be wise for you to let the teachers know about it from the start so they won't think he's dumb when he can't tell that Iran is periwinkle and Pakistan is cyan."

This means that the two biggest contrasts we can see are the blue/yellow contrast and the red/green one, explaining why those four colors crop up so much. But to someone whose red/green balance is off, blue/yellow is much more reliable. So I end up lumping most purples in with blue, and most oranges in with yellow, because that's the stronger distinction in my mind."

It's sort of like Garanimals for Grown-ups.  Say you have a blue shirt with yellow pin-stripes.  It matches a yellow tie, a blue tie, a brown tie, or a black tie.  It also goes with brown or tan pants, and so on.  The shirt would have a label saying something like this: BYRKT  The ties in your wardrobe with any of those letters on it would be safe.  Similarly, the pants with one of those letters would be good to go.  For instance, if you pants said something like YRTB, you would know that the Y matches the Y on the shirt and the Y on the tie and off you go to work.

ColorBlind,1ta3qw,apetz1,2,Fri Dec 20 13:23:11 2013 UTC,"Sorry, bad explanation  From my understanding of colorblindness, Deuteranopia and Protanopia are both forms of colorblindness which leave the person with mainly the colors blue and yellow (and the combinations that are made up of those).   So then with both Protanopia and Deuteranopia you wouldn't expect to see much difference from eye to eye.   Tritanopia on the other hand, allows you to see red and turquoise.   Given that the combination of Tritanopia with either Deuteranopia or Protanopia would theoretically allow a person to pass any colorblindness tests...  Hopefully this is more clear..."
ColorBlind,1ta3qw,Hammerosu,2,Fri Dec 20 16:20:28 2013 UTC,"Ah, yes! I get it now. Someone else might be able to explain better, but I'll try using the internet:  Whereas people affected by protan color blindness are less sensitive to red light, deuteranopia or deuteranomly (the second type of red-green color blindness) is related to sensitiveness on green light.  In practice, I don't really see much of a difference from eye to eye (although now that I know it's there, some shades do change). And it was only until I saw that one particular colored dot slide that I even noticed there was a difference. When I covered one eye, I saw nothing at all. Covered the other eye, and a shape stood out clear as day."
ColorBlind,1ta3qw,mpeskin,1 point,Fri Dec 20 16:37:02 2013 UTC,Guess you have one eye that is very dominant. Here's how to find out which one.  I wonder if this actually means you could train yourself to see contrasts normal people can't spot easily?
ColorBlind,1ta3qw,youssarian,7,Fri Dec 20 21:19:28 2013 UTC,"After posting that, I realize that it may seem like a strange comment, but since both the red and green genes ""live"" on the X, the only way I could legitimately see that happening would be if you had one X as protan, one X as deutan and then normally with X-inactivation (only one X chromosome can only work at a time in a developmental area- think calico cat coat color) in the fovea (where most of the cones exist) you could have expression of each independent from eachother.   I guess there could be other ways, but I don't think I'd be able to wrap my mind as to how it would work.  Edit- to clarify some of my terminology."

Not sure if what I'm seeing is the real color or I'm in the middle of my eyes adjusting.

I don't think it has to do with colors, since they make grayscale stereograms as well (http://faculty.arch.utah.edu/serrato/members.htm). Not sure why some can see them easily and some can't, but I remember once I got one when I was a kid, it was far easier thereafter. The way I've always done it is pretend there's something about a foot or two behind the image, and change my focus to there. Usually something starts to pop out, and I move that focus back and forth until it's obvious."
ColorBlind,1t0qm8,TheClownFromIt,2,Mon Dec 16 18:09:58 2013 UTC,"Magic Eye hidden image pictures have nothing to do with color. They use pattern to hide the image.   Even those who are true (black/white) colorblind should be able to see the image, once one understands how."
ColorBlind,1t0qm8,deanreevesii,1 point,Mon Dec 16 19:32:46 2013 UTC,"It's a common misconception, but the image isn't ""hidden"" in the sense you think. There's no outline to look for-- what you're trying to do is convince your eyes that they're looking at a scene out of focus. When they refocus, parts of the image overlap, and that's where the real hidden picture is."

Do you mean that you have trouble distinguishing purples and blues from each other?  If so, that is part of what they call red-green colorblindness.   Greens take on a darker, kind of wonky hue   Probably because the glasses filter out a lot of those ""middle"" wavelengths that usually contribute to green sensations.   This creates a large contrast between the colors...making it much, much easier to tell them apart...these were absolutely worth the $277   Awesome!

ColorBlind,1sv9uv,Brevoort,1 point,Sat Dec 14 18:04:36 2013 UTC,"It really depends on which country you are in and how severe a vision problem you have.  I have several thousand hours in military and civilian aircraft in Canada and I have a r/g deficiency. I was able to pass what is called a Lantern Test and prove that I can see the difference between red, green, and white lights. I was issued an unrestricted licence and have never been color vision tested since.  In the United States things can be quite complex with the FAA but essentially, if you can pass even one of the many tests that they use, including a physical walk around at an airport pointing out colors, you can qualify for an unrestricted Class 1 license. A Class 1 allows you to train for all of the advanced ratings that you will need for an airline job.  You probably won't get into the military these days but in the past, including mine decades ago, it was possible.   Airlines have higher medical standards and that route could be shut to you but it is a complex world and if you get that Unrestricted Class 1 you could well have a shot.  I have met several r/g deficient airline pilots.  If you are outside of North America I am willing to bet that regulations are somewhat similar to Canada and the United States. I do believe that Australia has very liberal color vision requirements but I could be very wrong about that.  Certainly there is nothing stopping you from getting a Private Pilot's licence although, until you pass one of the tests you may be restricted to daytime VFR.  I recommed that you start researching the medical requirements of your home country's aviation regulator, join AOPA which has done a tonne of work in this area, and start working your way through the on-line aviation forums looking for what has already been discussed about this issue; there is a lot.  Bottom line: the military is probably out but a career in civilian aviation is still possible and if you persevere then even likely.  Rick Calgary"

When my gf didn't know she was colorblind she just assumed red was a type of black, and purple was a type of blue, etc etc. Sometimes colorblindness means you see a different color.

Your friend hasn't 'forgotten' his colors.  He doesn't have all the receptors to be able to isolate the same colors that you can.  Think of it like hanging out with your grandfather when he doesn't notice the telephone ringing or the microwave timer.  ""Don't you hear that?"" is meaningless to him because ""No. He doesn't.""

I know that everyone seems to love chicken tikka Marsala but I have no concept of the taste.  As the menus items loaded line by line I expected to see an unfortunate misspelling or maybe a vague warning about a dish.  Each item loaded and they each seemed fairly mundane.  I don't know what any of them taste like but all but I expected someone from the UK would likely be well informed.  They kept loading and I got to the gap between the bottom of the menu and the beginning of the legend.  I thought surely there is a pay off in this image somewhere.  I can't have just clicked some random picture of a take-out menu.  Then the last line loaded.  Three levels of spicyness.  Well sure that makes sense.

I've created another version that doesn't rely on colour, and it actually turns out to be a more effective visualization of the data (although it's now necessary to hover over rectangles to see the titles). The new version is here. I would appreciate any feedback on this (although unfortunately I'm snowed under with coursework just now so I'll not be able to do any major redesigns in the next couple of weeks)."
ColorBlind,1rin68,jamestrimble,2,Tue Nov 26 21:22:07 2013 UTC,"Looking at the two iterations, I wonder if it would be better still to have the original colours, but put a defined border around every rectangle (like you have in the revised one) to help differentiate? You can already see what subreddits are in each area by mousing over a post, so while it's not super obvious immediately what area they're in, you can find out pretty fast - however, if you can't really tell each separate area apart, this is much less useful.   I think also that one of the main problems here is that the coloured key in the original isn't very helpful to those who might have difficulty matching the colours up (I don't have very strong colour deficiency, but it's still an issue). If you could do away with the need for a key and still retain the original colours I think you'd have it down pretty well.   All that aside, very interesting. Cheers for making it."

In the US, color deficient vision is not covered by the ADA - and even if it were employers are still allowed to not hire someone if their disability prevents them from doing the job. So, ignoring the issue of whether you can actually do a good job as a graphics designer (which would depend on your overall skill level / exactly what type of work you want to do / exactly how color impaired you are), you might find yourself unable to land a job or terminated from a job if your employer finds out.   Here's a somewhat-similar story I found of a guy being denied a manufacturing job because he's colorblind. http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11mho5/to_all_the_colorblind_redditors_out_there_when/c6nrkvv  Does that mean you shouldn't go into graphics design? No, not if it's something you have a passion for and want to do. Unlike being a pilot where you've got to pass a test and get a license there's nothing stopping you as long as you can produce quality work. Just realize that in addition to any practical difficulties of actually doing the job, you might face discrimination for being color blind."

ColorBlind,1r0i8d,riddick3,7,Tue Nov 19 22:54:07 2013 UTC,"\1:  In modern traffic lights, the green light is usually significantly desaturated or fairly blue-ish, which makes it stand out versus the yellow and red lights.  Often, red-green colorblind people will describe the green light as almost white, while the yellow and red appear very colorful.  In Japan, I think it is usual for the 'green light' to be pretty much blue, which is easy for red-green colorblind people to distinguish from yellow and red.  \2: For vertical traffic lights, the standard is red on top and green on bottom.  For horizontal traffic lights, the standard is to have the green on the side of the road that you drive on (so it differs between USA and UK).  Yellow is usually in the middle.  These standards allow position, rather than hue, of the active light to communicate the required information."

Also, color vision is highly contextual (such as the perceived color of an object highly depending on surrounding objects and overall illumination of the scene), so I wouldn't place too much importance on zooming in on a ""typical pixel"", especially when the G value is only 6 more than the R value.  As an example of the contextual nature of color, when I look at {200,206,199} next to {200,200,200}, the {200,206,199} looks slightly yellow-green and the {200,200,200} looks slightly fuchsia.

So I took the photo into photoshop and did an average blur on the t-shirt. And the numbers came out pretty similar to what I proposed in my previous post.   Anyway, I feel like I have somewhat ""adapted"", not my eyes of course, but my brain to settle small nuances in the color range by, some kind of mix of processes, whether it be memory of previous experiences, brightness, texture and/or general lighting. I don't really know what.  I'm a professional landscaper, who draws artistic renderings of gardens for customers, do graphic design, and have studied Art history at uni.

A lot of people (protans and deutans) have had good results with EnChroma glasses.  Unfortunately, you might not be able to take colorblindness tests while wearing sunglasses, and if you are a tritan, I believe it is less likely that the glasses would help.  I have heard of mixed results where a person wears one tinted contact, so that their color vision is slightly different in each eye and binocular rivalry is used to help a bit with color differentiation.  Emphasis on mixed results.   Did any of you beome colorblind as you got older?   Apparently, of (partial) tritanopia cases, it is common for it to be acquired (due to diabetes, glaucoma, etc), rather than congenital.  I'd recommend taking a colorblindness test, and then visit an optometrist for an eye exam where you make your changes in vision well known to the optometrist.  A change in color vision is not a good sign."

If you are red/green colour deficient then you have damaged or fewer of those receptors.  So it's a subtraction thing.  Blue + Red= Purple.  If you subtract red from it, as in protanomaly, you see blue.    In order to see blue as purple you would have to ADD red to it.  This would really only occur if the brain was being stimulated by an external force, like narcotics.  It's not possible to subtract anything from blue to get purple."
ColorBlind,1qtmsv,isionous,3,Sun Nov 17 17:40:35 2013 UTC,"We have red, green, and blue receptors in our eyes. If you are red/green colour deficient then you have damaged or fewer of those receptors. So it's a subtraction thing.   First of all, it is highly misleading to think of the human eye as having red, green, and blue receptors.  Humans typically have S, M, and L cones, having peak sensitivities at {445, 540, 565}nm.  These wavelengths are often associated with the violet, green, and slightly-yellowish green color labels, but remember, these are just the peaks of their spectral sensitivity distribution.  The M and L cones have a huge amount of overlap.  Secondly, the most common cause of ""red-green color deficient"" comes from either your M or L cone having a spectral sensitivity distribution that is abnormally similar to the other.  It is not a subtraction thing, it is a lesser-than-typical-differentiation thing.   In order to see blue as purple you would have to ADD red to it.   I think the OP's issue is that they experience the same sensation when looking at objects other people would describe as purple or blue.  I can link you to some excellent material on color vision and colorblindness from handprint.com, and to some of my previous comments about hue confusion if you want."

More specifically this is the first of the three versions Van Gogh painted. I am unaware of any significance this particular painting has with colorblindness.  But what I believe OP is referring to is the ""recent"" (two years ago) work by one Dr. Kazunori Asada, a Ph.D. of medical science and media design, and specifically, to this incident. Dr. Asada gave a talk at the  Hokkaido Color Universal Design Organization (<----not much use if you don't read Japanese). While there, he enjoyed an exhibit that—among other things—showed a Van Gogh painting next to a copy that had been altered with a filter designed to mimic a color deficiency. The Doc found the altered version better. Leading him to make additional altered versions of Van Gogh paintings and to the idea that maybe Van Gogh was colorblind, as evidenced by the altered versions being better."

Over the years I've learned to guess what a color is from context (What colors are paired with it that I can identify? What's the situation? Is it likely that he'd be wearing pink at a formal event?). But that's only going to come with time.  Art class is going to be annoying, particularly picking out a particular color of pencil from the boxes of 64+. Maybe mention it to his teachers, especially in younger grades. I got scolded a few times for coloring things the wrong color in kindergarten and elementary school.   Each person will eventually develop their own coping mechanisms. I've learned to pick clothes carefully when buying them, and am generally considered well dressed in my office. Though I did wear a pink shirt for a couple of years before anyone told me it was pink.  Traffic lights aren't an issue (the red and green in traffic lights look nothing alike to most color blind people). The only thing that routinely trips me up are bi-color LEDs. Red when charging, green when charged just means that I plug it in for a few hours and hope for the best.  Only tips: pick up an app like Visolve for your phone, it'll let you see what your kid sees. And don't make a thing out of it. It's rare that my colorblindness becomes an issue of any kind (usually a very small issue) more than once a week.  For what it's worth, I had a side job as a photographer for a couple of years. Outside of being a fighter pilot, there's virtually nothing your son won't be able to do."

When people hear ""colorblind"" they generally imagine something entirely unlike actual colorblindness, where CVD sounds a but more like what it is, some colors just don't show up so good. That way teachers and such won't overreact to what is a minor condition that if not specifically tested for, can go unnoticed until adulthood.

This is obviously way down the road as he probably won't be dressing himself at 2.5.  Don't let him shop alone!    Make sure his teachers know.  It can cause some issues when learning more than just colors.  Some teachers use colors that aren't differentiated to colorblind people to denote something of importance and it's completely lost on us.    I had one professor use a dark red to show what things would be on the exams.  His original text color was brown.  So, needless to say, I never saw it.  In kindergarten, one of my teachers lost her patience with me because I couldn't tell blue from purple.  It's not a huge deal, but it does get annoying at times."

He's going to have to develop a decently thick skin and just get used to people quizzing him on colours of shirts and other stuff around him.  It can be annoying and frustrating, but that's life.  My biggest issue is knowing clothes that match.  I still have to ask my wife if things match before trying something new.

Try to look for things not related to colour; in Strawberries, look for healthy leaves attached to the stem that aren't all dried out and wilted.   Grapes - look at the stems to see if they are thick and not dark coloured and dried out   Citrus - pick up two of the same size, then keep the one that you think us heavier. Higher weight per size is good, means more liquid/sugar.   Melons - lightly press the ends of it, if it slightly gives then springs back, then it should be ready to eat today or the next few days. If an end sinks in and doesn't spring back, it's fully ripe and can be eaten today  Watermelons always have discolourations because one side has been laying face down in the dirt all the time. Do the tap test and avoid hollow sounding ones  Discolourations also are a giveaway for fruit approaching it's lifespan - contrasting specks may be good (like in bananas) or bad (wet things like lettuce)   For stone fruits, lightly press them as well, avoid misshaped things. Put them in paper bags so you can control the rate they ripen  Potatoes are tricky, because they can be slightly green and we won't be able to notice it. When you get a bag, smell it - if there's a metallic, damp earthy smell, then it's good to go. If it smells baaaad then there's a rotten one in there. If there's no smell, meh, go for it.  Bananas with spots on then are approaching their maximum nutritive value and sugar content  Onions can be slightly green as well - avoid any bags with moisture anywhere in them, or sprouts forming.  Discolourations/rust marks on the stalks of vegetables is usually an undesirable thing   Pick product from the back of the shelf and check the dates on packaged things.   Try to look for the darkest one of celeries and leafy greens that doesn't have discolourations or spots on it and isn't wilting. You could also cut A thin slice of the bottom of a vegetable and stick it in ice water, this will help it recrisp.   Hope that helps!"

He doesn't like bananas ripened to the point that they have spots.  I didn't realize (and maybe he didn't either) that he can't really tell the difference between ""too green to eat"" and ""nicely yellow and starting to ripen"". I just thought he was less fussy than I was about eating not-ripe bananas. Maybe he thought bananas are just a crapshoot - open it up and hope for the best?  I finally clued in when we were shopping together one day, and he put two big bunches of bright green bananas in the cart. When I went to swap one out for some that we could eat right away (and mentioned why I was doing it) he seemed surprised. I pick out the bananas now.  I don't know why it didn't occur to either of us that this might be an issue. He's known he's colour blind since he was a kid, and he's pretty easy going about asking me for help when needed.

ColorBlind,1q9nwu,crazy_family,2,Sun Nov 10 17:11:29 2013 UTC,"I studied graphic design in college, painted for several years afterward while also working as a freelancer, and just finished a masters degree in design (though more strategy/not graphic) this year. If anything, you should view your colorblindness as an asset.  Someone that can understand solid design principles as well as how such a significant percentage of the population sees (and views/understands information) is a rare and valuable combination. Through my years, I've seen many examples of poorly-presented information because of the misuse of color. In a simple graph, for example, there should be no reason that two colors are so close together that they might be confused, but it happens very often. With your ability, however, you can understand the potential confusion and make the corrections needed to use enough contrast between colors or alternative methods of presenting the information (whatever it may be).  Really, it's a shame that more colorblind persons aren't designers, or that more often students are not taught to be aware of such possible ""afflictions"". Use your unique view to enhance clarity and, whenever possible, boast of your abilities!"

Here it their review: http://community.ablegamers.com/Playstation-3/far-cry-3-ps3.html  The relevant section:   There are quite a few problems that the colour blind could struggle with. Most importantly your map is mostly green and the areas controlled by the enemy are shown in red. The flags and uniforms indicating your own forces are blue and the enemy's are red so distinguishing between them should be ok. Unfortunately (and inexplicably) your reticule turns green when over a friendly and red when over an enemy. Also, some of the plants are coloured red and some green so these may be difficult to distinguish between. Plants do glow slightly, making them visible against the green grass, but it will be a nuisance for the colour blind if they are looking for a particular colour. Green is for medical syringes and, therefore, often the most useful."

So things that trichromats (people with normal color vision) see as really blue will look kind of dark to you.   Fun facts you can use at (lame) parties:    No one has S cones in the center of their eye. So the sharpest part of your vision (at the very center) is just like everyone else's! S cones are the least common type of cone anyway. In normal color vision, the S cone only makes up about 1% of the cones, so your retina is only different by 1%.   Feel free to ask any questions!"

Closed captioning is controlled by a toggle in the Settings app for the entire OS, rather than per-app, so while developers have to make the captions themselves, they don't have to include a toggle.

ColorBlind,1oujk3,NSFLETU,6,Sun Oct 20 18:31:59 2013 UTC,"The cornea, lens, and macular pigment can yellow over time, blocking more and more of the lower wavelengths (like ""blue"" light).  However, it is usually only people far older than you that experience significant yellowing.  Also, I'm not sure that this would explain the problems you are experiencing.  The severity of colorblindness usually does not significantly change over the span of a few years since most colorblindness is genetic and has to do with the cone types in your eye, which means it would be very stable over time.  If you truly are having significant vision changes over the course of a few years, you should visit an optometrist.  For instance, at my last visit to an optometrist, they took a picture of my retina and did other things to assess the overall health of my eyes.  I'm worried that you might have something happening to you more sinister than a mere fluke of memory."

Two areas I commonly encounter this are graphs/data visualization and software/video game interfaces. You could do an experiment to see whether non-color blind users really do achieve faster or clearer understanding with color vesus symbol. For example, show the test subjects a graph such as this one or the same graph that uses triangles, squares, circles, etc. instead of color and see if it effects how quickly they understand the data."

If your monitor is not displaying perfectly (I know the one that i'm looking at right now is slightly skewed), it's possible you could see if when you normally couldn't.  And I see now the post is 5 months old.... Ooops."
ColorBlind,1o7ggv,KneadSomeBread,7,Thu Apr 3 20:47:47 2014 UTC,"I could barely see a 56 or a 5G until I saw whitewateractual's comment. Now I can definitely see that it says NO, but it takes some looking (the right side of the O in particular). I've passed every colorblind test I've found on this subreddit and I'm positive I have normal vision."

ColorBlind,1o7ggv,Npgreader,7,Fri Oct 11 08:41:35 2013 UTC,I would also like to know. I think they are made by hand. You could make some awesome games or other media with this.

ColorBlind,1o7ggv,humpaa,6,Sat Oct 12 10:29:32 2013 UTC,"Be aware that a miscalibrated monitor can make it easier to see the hidden figure.  For instance, if your red pixels are dimmer than they should be, the hidden figure becomes more detectable.  If you can see the hidden figure and are worried that you might be colorblind, you should view the image on some other monitors (and, of course, take some actual colorblindness tests).  Also, it seems like the image is geared towards protans."

If you make a UI that gets it's colours from a schema - not difficult at all - making new schema's is literally a few lines of code. Hopefully someone will find the schema's somewhere and we'll be able to set our own colours :)"

I pointed out that the monsters in the bubbles are all different and match the colour. I match monsters, not colour.  He had been playing the same game for weeks and never noticed this."
ColorBlind,1njylm,Asmordean,3,Wed Oct 2 03:51:57 2013 UTC,"(unless it's that weird colour between red and brown that people call red but that I insist does not make someone a redhead)   Agreed.  Color labels are highly contextual.  I could take a brick that people would say is red, and I rip off the visual texture and put it on an apple, but people would say the apple looks brown.  Also, you can look at a picture of a person and it looks normal, but if you look at a tiny piece of the picture extremely zoomed in on their skin...it doesn't look like you'd expect.  And don't think that skin is a special case.  The same sort of ""weirdness"" happens with all sorts of objects.   One of the things I like about the colorblind subreddit is the people here often recognize the contextual nature of color and color labels."
ColorBlind,1njylm,isionous,6,Wed Oct 2 02:46:15 2013 UTC,"I am not colourblind, yet you have just perfectly described my issue with colour. I have issues deciding when to stop calling something red and start calling it brown. Unless its contextualized such as your example of putting that colour on an apple, I will never be able to truly identify the colour in a way others might recognize.  I'm reminded of this image because the female side is how I think other people relate to colours, but the male side is what I see. This image is very useful because I can see the difference between orange and cantaloupe very clearly side by side, but show me one on a card, then show me the other separately, and I will tell you they are both identical and they are both orange.  I'm sure this is normal and most people make the same mistakes, It just seemed to effect me more, always getting into trouble with my teachers and clients because I used a colour I thought was teal (like they requested) but they say it's cyan. they both look like exact same blue to me unless all three are side by side, I can tell you they are different blues but couldn't label them exactly."
ColorBlind,1njylm,mundabit,2,Wed Oct 2 03:05:52 2013 UTC,"People are prone to treat words as having objective, clear-cut meanings, but that is not the case, especially with color labels.  Words are pointers to fuzzy empirical clusters, and color clusters are very fuzzy.  Any boundary between red and brown is arbitrary (and I dare you to actually define that boundary in an objective and precise fashion).  Unfortunately people often like to pretend that their own personal boundary is obvious and objective.  When you encounter someone insisting that something is turquoise and not teal, if you look hard enough, you can often find someone else who will insist it is teal and not turquoise.  I have seen more than one fruitless but emotional argument over what's ""really"" cyan/teal/turquoise/azure.  Thankfully people are tending to standardize more on color labels now due to computers, but there's still a very long way to go when it comes to conversational English...and computer-related uses of color labels.  There's also the issue that people are hugely misinformed about color (like they think it's an objective property of objects, but it's a subjective sensation), so maybe I'm biased to think that people are full of bullflop when it comes to color."

ColorBlind,1njylm,nupanick,2,Wed Oct 2 15:02:09 2013 UTC,So you're saying maybe the reason a lot of us don't remember things by their color is that we've somehow been taught not to trust colors in context?

ColorBlind,1njvsj,TheBlazingPhoenix,1 point,Wed Oct 2 04:19:04 2013 UTC,You should probably see a optometrist before you go around telling everyone you're colorblind. Though online tests are pretty good I would get a professional to make sure.
ColorBlind,1nkb3b,gadapamagicman,5,Wed Oct 2 04:29:12 2013 UTC,"The difference between xxxanopia and xxxanomaly is in the kind of problems. For instance, the word protanopia comes from the greek words for first and missing, that is, that your first, longest cone, the one sensitive to redder wavelengths is simply not there. Protanomaly, simply means that your long cones, while they do exist, have something wrong with them. They may be shorter than normal, longer than normal, less dense than usual, whatever.  Tests can only tell you so much, and yours seems to indicate that you may have either protanopia or protanomaly. All this particular test has managed to suggest is that something is up with your long cones. At this point, I would take more tests and possibly see an optometrist. They would be able to tell you for certain what you particular case is.   As a side note, it may not be so strange to be able to see bright red, but still be protanopic. Your brain is pretty smart, and it can sometimes deduce the presence of a color from the absence of others. You know a fire truck is red because they're always red, even if this particular one doesn't look red."
ColorBlind,1nkb3b,gobernador,4,Wed Oct 2 05:02:51 2013 UTC,"Awesome answer, that really helps my understanding, thanks.   Interesting about the fire truck example. So my brain is using input from green and blue wavelengths to create a sensation of 'red'? I mean, if I've never experienced it due to missing long cones, and I am experiencing a bright red, my brain is creating that experience somehow. Or am I getting this confused?"
ColorBlind,1nkb3b,gobernador,3,Wed Oct 2 05:19:36 2013 UTC,"It's not that you've never seen red. Take a look at this graph. What this graph tells us is that while you might not have red cones, your green cones can still cover part of that spectrum. Your brain still gets the input that says ""red fire truck"", and it knows that fire trucks are supposed to be red, and so it makes sense even though you might not be getting as much red signal as everyone else.   Unrelated tangent: This graph also suggests the reason that the blue headlights on a car seem brighter than other headlights. Normal headlights are yellower, but the blue light in the dark triggers your rods more easily, and it appears brighter."
ColorBlind,1nkb3b,gobernador,1 point,Wed Oct 2 05:26:14 2013 UTC,"ok i get it, the overlap in wavelengths of the other cones are provding my version of red, which is going to be different than someone with fully funcitoning red cones.  That brings me back the wiki statement about protanopics having a 'severe' experience. Is it possible that my brain is doing a much better job than others? How can it be called 'severe' when there is a pretty good overlap with other cones?"
ColorBlind,1nkb3b,isionous,4,Wed Oct 2 06:27:16 2013 UTC,"The functional overlap between types of cones is not great, as I understand it. I strongly encourage you to see a professional if you are still curious, but I would put money down that you are protanomalic, and not protanopic. Sometimes the word ""protanopia"" is used (improperly) to describe strong deficiencies and not the simple absence of red cones. Good luck though, I'm glad you learned something here!"
ColorBlind,1nkb3b,isionous,7,Wed Oct 2 15:15:00 2013 UTC,"I agree. ""Protanopia"" means the complete and total absence of red cones. There's no ""mild protanopia"". That would be like saying that you're ""mildly pregnant"". Either you are or you aren't."
ColorBlind,1nkb3b,isionous,1 point,Wed Oct 2 15:56:11 2013 UTC,"I have been reading recently there is such a thing as incomplete tritanopia, where a person has significantly fewer S cones than is typical, which does degrade color vision."
ColorBlind,1nkb3b,neotecha,1 point,Thu Oct 3 01:42:02 2013 UTC,"Words evolve as terms are appropriated for different meanings, but it's annoying when there's a similar but more apt term right there. Oh well, that's the nature of language."
ColorBlind,1nkb3b,isionous,3,Wed Oct 2 15:59:28 2013 UTC,"The overlap of typical M and L cones is quite high.  Here are cone sensitivity distributions with linear and logarithmic scales.  Their peak sensitivities are only ~25nm apart, which is not much considering that the visible spectrum is greater than 300nm wide."
ColorBlind,1nirob,Npgreader,5,Tue Oct 1 16:52:07 2013 UTC,"Most of what I've read about it says it is theoretical.  Unfortunately, I haven't found anything that mentions the alleged mechanism/cause of tetartanopia.  I should explain what I mean by mechanism.  For instance, protanopia is a missing L cone and results in collapsing reds, oranges, yellows, greens, and browns into a common hue sensation.  The missing L cone is the mechanism of protanopia; the hue confusion is the symptom.  So far I have no idea what the supposed mechanism of tetartanopia is such that its symptoms be similar but not identical to tritanopia.  Perhaps a missing S cone combined with abnormal M and/or L cones?  One interesting thing is that the pictured confusion line for tetartan is perpendicular to the deutan confusion line, similar to the perpendicularity of the protan and tritan confusion lines.  I could imagine the temptation when a person sees the perpendicularity of the protan and tritan confusion lines and says, ""gosh, maybe there's a condition that produces a confusion line perpendicular to the deutan confusion line?"".  edit:  After further digging, one book seemed to say that tetartanopia is a theoretical neural defect in the {light-dark, red-green, blue-yellow} opponent processing, particularly the blue-yellow opponent process.  Note that opponent processing is neural processing that happens after the cone stimulation stage.  The book also says that no tetartan has ever been convincingly demonstrated."

ColorBlind,1ngmvy,isionous,7,Thu Oct 3 22:54:18 2013 UTC,"Great post!  Considering that the EnChroma glasses worked for you, you might want to change your flair from protanopia to protanomaly.  The glasses do not work for dichromats.  EnChroma people have also said that almost all self-diagnosed protanopes are actually protanomalous (like 348 out of 350).  The probability you are a protanope is very low at this point.  What colors seemed the same?"

ColorBlind,1ngmvy,justkirk,3,Tue Oct 1 00:34:24 2013 UTC,"Well, again, I recall EnChroma saying that most alleged dichromats are really just strongly anomalous trichromats (I think it applied to both deutans and protans).  Just like the OP, you might think you're a dichromat and the glasses will work because you actually aren't."
ColorBlind,1ngmvy,isionous,6,Tue Oct 1 00:44:49 2013 UTC,"I actually am though.  edit: (Background) I was initially diagnosed when I was 8 years old as simply ""colorblind"" by an optometrist. Around 5 years ago, I started going to school in a visual arts major (computer animation/vfx), and I was worried about certain classes (like color theory, and digital compositing), where color perception is pivotal. I visited a vision specialist specifically to diagnose my color blindness. That specialist's diagnosis is where I get my ""strong deutan"" information from. My colorblindness is officially recognized by the Office of Disability at my University."
ColorBlind,1ngmvy,Shooper101,3,Tue Oct 1 00:50:26 2013 UTC,"That specialist's diagnosis is where I get my ""strong deutan"" information    Did he diagnose you as a deuteranope or strong deutan?  I have seen strong deutan refer to both deuteranopia and severe deuteranomaly."

ColorBlind,1ngmvy,Shooper101,5,Tue Oct 1 02:08:31 2013 UTC,Could you elaborate on the 'your brain will rewire itself after several months of usage?'
ColorBlind,1ngmvy,EnChroma,6,Tue Oct 1 12:14:13 2013 UTC,"Through the marvelous, incredible, wonderful act of neuroplasticity. I'm no brain scientist, but I would guess because your brain is getting visual input it hasn't dealt with before, it builds new pathways and connections to create, store, and recall those colors.  (Side note: I have some fairly significant brain damage, and neuroplasticity is the reason I'm here today, typing away on a keyboard.)"
ColorBlind,1ngmvy,EnChroma,3,Tue Oct 1 15:38:13 2013 UTC,"And, my question is: will my brain eventually recognize the brick red wavelength as brick red, even when I don't have the glasses on? I understand blind people learn to develop stereoscopic vision and color recognition after retinal implants. Enchroma, care to answer?"
ColorBlind,1ngmvy,Dustin-,5,Wed Oct 2 00:07:13 2013 UTC,"Its a hard thing to say. It certainly seems to have some kind of long term effect, I notice this just from wearing the NRGs. This is a really new technology so we have no long term studies. But the idea behind the efficacy of the product is based on neural plasticity and so really expect to see some long term effect, particularly amongst children whose brains will develop while wearing the lenses."
ColorBlind,1ngmvy,isionous,3,Wed Oct 2 00:50:22 2013 UTC,"probably not, EnChroma's work by filtering colors. You will probably need them to ""see"" the other colors, just like I need to wear very huge glasses to ""see"" at normal acuity."
ColorBlind,1ngmvy,Stitchopoulis,2,Thu Oct 3 21:05:14 2013 UTC,"That's really interesting, thanks for the info. So, correct me if I'm wrong, after several months of wearing these, your colour perception will improve despite not wearing glasses? If so, I might invest."
ColorBlind,1ngmvy,Restless-rooster,2,Wed Oct 2 19:15:39 2013 UTC,"I was hoping so, but earlier in this thread it was explained just like regular glasses won't eventually improve your vision without them, these probably won't either. But who can say? It's a new technology and the brain does some wonderful stuff.  I was hoping the Enchroma people would weigh in on all these questions, but I know they're a very small company that suddenly got really busy."

ColorBlind,1ngmvy,EnChroma,4,Thu Oct 3 23:02:03 2013 UTC,"How does Enchroma work   EnChroma has this page giving a brief blurb.  My crude impression is that it attenuates wavelengths that tend to stimulate M and L cones roughly the same amount.  What's left is the wavelengths that stimulate mostly one but not the other cone type (of M and L).  That leads to more saturated (colorful) color sensations and can amplify differences in light distributions hitting your eye.  They probably have done some stuff with respect to the S cone, but I wouldn't know about that.   what would happen if I were to put a pair on?   You'd probably want to try the pair meant for color normal people.  In general, it would lead to more saturated color sensations with bigger color differences between objects that used to seem more similar.  They also attenuate light enough to be considered sunglasses."
ColorBlind,1ngmvy,12GaugeRampage,6,Mon Sep 30 20:52:01 2013 UTC,"According to my normal-sighted friends, the deuteranomaly enchroma lenses basically just look like a warming filter, and the sky looks weird."

ColorBlind,1ngmvy,12GaugeRampage,2,Mon Sep 30 22:12:08 2013 UTC,"I bring my husband with me when I wear the glasses so I can ask what color I'm looking at. A lot of time I'll see something and make a pretty good guess, but it's the first time I've seen that part of the spectrum, so I'm not 100% sure. I guess that's where the shock from the glasses come in, you have an idea of what purple is, but when you see a rich purple for the first time...just wow. You can't help but ask what color you're looking at."
ColorBlind,1ngmvy,bon_bons,3,Wed Oct 16 05:11:00 2013 UTC,"How are these different then just a red contract? Or a red lens? Those simply make the wave lengths of the red green field more distinct. It's not like your seeing the extra colors, just the difference of the two is more apparent."
ColorBlind,1ngmvy,SyanticRaven,3,Sat Oct 19 04:50:51 2013 UTC,"They work very differently than the Xchrome/Chromagen system which uses binocular disparity.  Example: I as a color vision normal look at an orange flower and the cones in my eye push an electrical signal back to my brain. The brain sees a certain ratio of medium cone signal to long cone signal and tells me that is orange.  Anomalous trichromats do not get the right ratio of signal because the cones have a peak sensitivity that is too close together or far apart. I would get a lot of signal from the red cone, a protan would get a lot less because it is not very sensitive in that part. The ratio would be off and it would be hard to tell orange from brown or green.  If you know what the cone response pattern looks like for a Deutan or Protan you can get the signals going back to the brain in the right ratio to one another via throwing away the ones which pull it out of ratio. You wont have the same brightness, but that is why it is a sunglass.  Systems which use binocular disparity take advantage of the fact that red objects look darker through a red lens, so if you have one eye covered with a red lens and one not you can wink back and forth and identify something which is red without actually being able to see red."

ColorBlind,1ngmvy,EnChroma,1 point,Thu Oct 3 22:47:08 2013 UTC,"It sounds like you guys have developed a great product that you are obviously passionate about. Have you considered offering a monocle option? It would dramatically cut your production costs (one lense instead of two, lenses could be flat instead of specially contoured, you could 3D print frames for pennies on the dollar) and would be more helpful in day to day use. You could slide it into a pocket case or wear it around your neck on a chain. Then, when you're in the grocery store trying to buy ripe bananas, in a restaurant checking the pink center of your steak, or at a hotel making sure the socks you packed match, you could pop it in and then put it away without having to carry around a clunky glasses case or worry about leaving your $600 glasses in a booth at the dinner. The glasses would still be a huge asset for the neurological benefits, but for daily tasks, or unexpected needs, a monocle would be perfect."
ColorBlind,1ngmvy,SyanticRaven,2,Thu Nov 7 15:08:17 2013 UTC,"Haha, yes we have thought of that but no it would not work.  When you are dealing with neuroplasticity it needs to see somewhat continuous usage, not just momentary glimpses. The world is a really beautiful place, so much you cant even imagine is out there. People do not miss what they have never known so there is this focus on these menial kind of tasks- as if there is no benefit to color vision outside of the frustrations you experience.  We could have made it that way but we think CVD aids arent actually all that interesting- certainly not something we would start a company and devote our lives to producing. See Key is basically the monocle you speak of."
ColorBlind,1ngmvy,EnChroma,2,Thu Nov 7 18:36:52 2013 UTC,"Do you think they would work in tandem? Forgive my ignorance on the topic, but as I understand it, the glasses are giving your eyes and your brain new stimuli that it's never experienced before. Like a muscle that you've never utilized, it has to be gradually strengthened through repetitive use. I kind of think of your product like a piece of exercise equipment for your brain. The only problem is, because they are tinted for outdoor use, too bulky to conveniently carry, and too expensive to risk losing or damaging them, they have practically no day to day value. Using my previous metaphor, it's like going to the gym and having to leave the muscles you just built behind in your locker at the end of your workout. Getting to see the leaves change on a sunny autumn drive is nice, but there are so many more experiences I want to experience unfiltered. I want to see my newborn nephew's rosy cheeks the first time I get to hold him. I want to see the light catch a stained glass just the right way while I'm in church. I want to stumble across a beautiful painting in one of my textbooks the way the artist intended. Sure there are times I just want to know if my banana is ripe, or if my shirt matches my outfit, but there are also countless unexpected moments when I don't just want an input/output color value, I want an EXPERIENCE. Is there anyway you could take it beyond a sunny day parlor trick, and turn it into a part of my life? I window into a different world?"

As I mentioned earlier, I have brain damage and anything that builds new pathways is a very great thing.  Also, I'm probably older than most Redditors, and how wonderful at my age to get to see the world with new eyes.   Because the glasses are expensive, I don't wear them on a casual basis.

The Malay words used to refer specifically to the ape are maias and mawas, but it is unclear if those words refer to just orangutans, or to all apes in general. The first attestation of the word to name the Asian ape is in Jacobus Bontius' 1631 Historiae naturalis et medicae Indiae orientalis – he described that Malaysians had informed him the ape was able to talk, but preferred not to ""lest he be compelled to labour"".[3] The word appeared in several German-language descriptions of Indonesian zoology in the 17th century. The likely origin of the word comes specifically from the Banjarese variety of Malay.[4]"

ColorBlind,1n1p7c,Epic2112,4,Wed Sep 25 02:09:02 2013 UTC,"Well, I'm sure it's not strictly impossible, but when we say ""colorblind"" what we are generally talking about is a malfunction or omission of a certain type of cone in the eye.  That's something you're born with, you can't exactly lose or break your cones.    The only way that I can think of to acquire color blindness would be through a head injury, or something else, that damages your brain.  I'm not aware of this ever actually happening, but it's probably not impossible that someone could hut just the right part of the brain to screw up how it understands color.  I think maybe I read about a case, in one of Oliver Sacks' books, of an artist that had something happen that caused him to only see in blacks, whites, and grays.  The difference, however, is that to us, colorblindness is a problem with how the eye works.  If our eyes worked correctly, our brains would be 100% capable of understanding color in the ""normal"" way.  I don't think we would call it colorblindness if it was caused by a problem with the brain, even if the end result was the same."

Unfortunately if you make the red too dark, protans will have a hard time distinguishing it from black."

All humans collapse spectral power distributions (which have infinite dimensions) into three or fewer sensory dimensions; all human color vision involves huge amounts of information loss.  I think this is an excellent perspective, and it helps remind people that color is a sensation, not an objective property of objects.  Many color-normal people feel like color is objective and what they see is all there is, which is SO wrong.  One of the things I like about colorblind people is that they are less likely to make that sort of mistake."

My mind tries to combat that and goes, ""no, it's yellow, black, and a little bit pink.""   Why is this, the combatant part, is it just to avoid the headache by reaction, or do you force  yourself to do think that?  I think this would make a great post as Iama or similar thread, I find it very interesting! I think that's mostly because in my own colorblindness I find the blindness itself is under-stimulating, while my normal vision friends find they think it would be somehow stimulating as if there would be some kind of conflict in my head over what color I should be seeing. Which is not the case(Do other CB guys feel the same way?) but in your case the blindness would be stimulating at least partially."
ColorBlind,1lev1q,EveToWither,2,Sat Aug 31 10:26:57 2013 UTC,"So here's my alphabet, (To the best of my ability, partial colorblindness notwithstanding) along with some letters and punctuation. You cant tell just by looking at this image, but some letters (and numbers for that matter) are strong more powerful than others, and when I see or read words, those letters try to make the whole word, or large parts of a word, their color.   For example, A is a really powerful letter, so when I initially think of the word ""Alter"" its almost entirely red--until I think about it longer and see all the letters individually.   In reality, I struggle with all color words, but blue in particular is really bad. In the word ""Blue,"" ""B,"" ""U,"" and ""E"" are all similarly powerful letters, and none are remotely bluish.   I think the reason color words are a headache unlike most words, is because we're trained form the beginning to associate these words with, well, colors, unlike physical objects or abstract meanings."
ColorBlind,1lev1q,whitewateractual,1 point,Sat Aug 31 15:39:45 2013 UTC,"Aha, this makes so much more sense to me now after that.  Thanks for explaining that to me I think I understand now.  So in the case of the blue it's because of the similar power between all of the letter's and word combined which your head wants to split up causing no small amount of disparity in your head.  Couple Quick questions if you don't mind:    Is there any significance to the color surrounding the letter vs. the color being on the inside of the letter? What I mean for instance is like in the difference between the ""Q"" and the ""W"", the Q is colored in while the W is black on the inside?  Does this correlate to the way you see it? Does it comfort you to see all the the letters together on that link since they are all correctly displaying their attributes on that page.   Thanks"
ColorBlind,1lev1q,EveToWither,2,Sat Aug 31 17:17:25 2013 UTC,"1) Many letter are two colors at the same time, but there's usually a dominant color. So ""Q"" is kind of black and grey at the same time. It's hard to explain, but it's dominant color is really grey. Same with ""W,"" but most of the time (And same goes for ""U"" in respect to the pink), because ""W"" is the only blue letter to me, the blueness gets drowned out among other more powerful letters and ""W"" just becomes black.   The reason I have ""E"" and ""Z"" and ""O"" outlined in black is because they are really strong white letters, unlike ""C"" and ""S"" which can sometimes get drowned out.   2) Looking at my alphabet feels normal. Now, my representation isn't perfect--it would be impossible for me to perfectly represent every letter exactly how I perceive them since its complex and, as I mentioned, most letters are more than one color at the same time, and sometimes, like ""A,"" are different shades of the same color at the same time.

ColorBlind,1l8uw7,Marneshi,3,Thu Aug 29 03:22:24 2013 UTC,"Yes, but only partially. Your brain has sections divided up to process information from your eyes, including different colors. With colorblindness, it never gets the signals from those colors you can't see. The brain doesn't like having bits of it that don't do anything, so it repurposes that area of your visual cortex to do other things to help out nearby segments. Perhaps it helps you see other colors, or something. Either way, if you did get new eyes with the correct cones, your brain wouldn't know what to do with that information because that part of the brain hasn't been trained for that. You would see some different colors, but still not the full range of vision as if you'd been born with those eyes.  Unless the transplant happened when you were like 7 or 8. The brain is still forming at that point, so it would not have repurposed that part of the visual cortex yet, so it would learn to see those new colors.

Basically, deuteranopia describes an individual who can not perceive green because they do not have any of those specific receptors in their eyes. Being deuteranomalic (having deuteranomaly) would mean having fewer green receptors than a normal colour vision (NCV) individual and is far more common as far as colour vision deficiencies go.

Being deuteranomalic (having deuteranomaly) would mean having fewer green receptors than a normal colour vision (NCV) individual   No, deuteranomaly is the condition of having M cones with spectral sensitivity distributions that are abnormally similar to the spectral sensitivity distributions of normal L cones.  Briefly put, deuteranomaly is when your M cones are more similar to your L cones than is normal.  People with deuteranomaly have just as many M cones as people with normal color vision.   if green doesn't look grey to you, you're probably deuteranomalic   I've also heard that ""cyan light"" (to speak imprecisely) can appear gray/white to dichromats.

They think it makes them special and unique. So I'm always on the look out for people that seem very obvious in their falseness.   Such as pointing out a color, such as ""red."" in a color blind community, knowing full well what direct other color could be called ""red."" by color blind people.  I'm absolutely not calling you a liar, I'm just pointing out how odd it sounds to try and point out the color of something that you shouldn't be able to see, and specifically calling out the one that it would be if you were ""colorblind.""

ColorBlind,1jlivn,zolco1,2,Fri Aug 2 23:50:40 2013 UTC,"www.enchroma.com/test is what you want. See the sidebar.  Someone with Red/Green color blindness would see blue the same way: the blue cone has its own neural channel so it is not affected by deuteranomaly or protanomaly. However, a protan for example might see something slightly purple to be just like what a normal would see as blue. The red signal is weak so purple - red = blue."
ColorBlind,1jlivn,EnChroma,1 point,Fri Aug 2 23:56:36 2013 UTC,"the blue cone has its own neural channel so it is not affected by deuteranomaly or protanomaly   I thought cone stimulations were converted into the opponent process channels (light-dark, red-green, blue-yellow) fairly early on.  Is this inconsistent with you impression?"
ColorBlind,1jlivn,isionous,1 point,Sat Aug 3 00:21:12 2013 UTC,"That is accurate, though the ""yellow"" is more akin to ""overall luminance"", so it is not like the blue cone opposes another cone like red/green cones do."
ColorBlind,1jlivn,EnChroma,1 point,Sat Aug 3 00:56:56 2013 UTC,I'm aware that the M and L cones contribute much more heavily to the sensation of brightness than the S cone does.  But the S cone does oppose the M and L cones for the blue-yellow opponent process.
ColorBlind,1jlivn,isionous,2,Sat Aug 3 01:37:27 2013 UTC,Yeah you are right of course- I just didn't conceive of it as an opponency in the same way because it is a system rather than a cone against cone pairing.

Hard to say what is the best, but the EnChroma one is pretty good about trying to diagnose which CVD you have.  You might want to give that one a try at least.   is it possible to determine if someone with, say, red-green colorblindess can see 'blue' exactly the same way as everyone else?   You're getting into neuroscience/philosophy.  I would say that neuroscience probably isn't to the point to give a definitive answer to that type of question about subjective experiences.  BUT considering how human visual processing works, it seems plausible that a red-green colorblind person would experience blue similar to how a normal color vision person would.  Early in human visual processing, stimuli are broken into three channels: light-dark, red-green, and blue-yellow.  A red-green colorblind person could have fairly normal activity and processing of the blue-yellow signal, thus might have a blue sensation just like a normal vision person would."

If you are truly concerned that your test may have been incorrect or that you have a different condition, I'd recommend visiting another independent optician for a second opinion, as well as taking the tests recommended in the sidebar.  There are many different forms of colour deficiency as well. I have a similar condition in that when comparing two distinct colours that are similar, I can usually - with a little study - tell them apart. With an Ishihara test, however, it's far more difficult because of the amount of visual information. Either way, I believe the reason that these specific jobs reject people for colourblindness is because often you would be required to act quickly on visual information, which unfortunately, those who are sufficiently colour-deficient can't do well.  There may be other military or law enforcement positions that do not require a test - I would suggest asking them about that."

I've had many different jobs, but at the core of each one of them has been connecting with people on a personal level. I've had jobs in and loved working in retail, customer support, videogame development and currently work in online community management, which share that common thread but operate very differently.

I have normal color vision and I highly doubt there are 18 colors that I could easily distinguish all from each other and recognize which was which when looking at some plot or graphic.  You might want to use things other than color (like shapes or patterns) to help distinguish.  Or you might not want to show all 18 different categories at once versus each other.

ColorBlind,1ig1nz,Axulotl,22,Tue Jul 16 22:32:21 2013 UTC,"Summary: no, ""red-green"" colorblindness (where you have an abnormal M or L cone) perfectly explains your confusion between blues and purples.  You might want to look at this article on color confusion lines.  Since your flair says protanomaly, you probably want to choose protanopia when fiddling with the diagram.  Let me describe the horseshoe-shaped diagram.  ""Reds"" are along the right-most edge, like 700nm to 620nm.  And as you decrease in wavelength and work your way along the outer edge, you go into ""orange"", ""yellow"", ""green"", and on the very left is ""blue"" and ""violet"".  There's a straight lines connecting the 700nm (""red"") point to the 380nm (""blue/violet"") point.  This is called the line of purples.  You should notice that the lines of confusion run along similar hue experiences for you.  So, not only do you confuse reds, oranges, yellows, greens, and browns with each other, you also confuse blues and purples with each other.  It's for the same reason - your M and L cones (sometimes called ""green cone"" and ""red cone"" but I dislike those names) are more similar than is normal.  That means you can really only distinguish if light hitting your eyes is mainly large wavelength light (like ""yellow"" or ""red"") or if it is mainly small wavelength light (like ""blue""), or if it is fairly even between the two (like ""cyan"" or ""white"" or ""red""+""blue"" light).  A purple (from mixture of ""red"" + ""blue"" light) can stimulate your eyes much like white light.  Or, if there's more blue than red, it simply seems like a grayish blue.  Or if it's more red than blue, it simply seems like a grayish red.  ....I have no idea if any of that helped.  It's hard for me to explain why without going into cone sensitivity distributions and a bunch of stuff..."

We can't fully ""see"" red or green so they almost look like a shade of gray in some cases.   Since purple is just blue with red added, it looks like blue with gray added instead, which looks like a darker blue in my experience.  Blue/Purple are the colors I confuse the most as well.

ColorBlind,1huhkc,Magwado,7,Mon Jul 8 05:22:22 2013 UTC,"EnChroma glasses work on an entirely different principle than the red contact lenses, a la X-Chrome etc. They are a totally different product type. Honestly I have no idea how these other companies justify selling tinted bits of glass for more than $50, these guys have it right: http://www.seekey.se/ .  Those products make reds appear darker out of one eye so based on the difference between them (the ""binocular disparity"") you can distinguish reds better. So they do the opposite of what you are saying- they diminish a red so it looks different than other colors to you- ""speckly blackish"" is how it is described to me.  EnChroma glasses work really well for people with Deuteranomaly and you would be out something like $8 in return shipping if you give them a try. They are expensive because they are really really expensive to make.

He scored as a strong protan on the HRR plate test. His performance was greatly improved with the eyewear on the D15 and L15 using our Tricycle test. Andy has made some real improvements to the system and it now seems to give promising tangible results. His speed also  improved dramatically. Funny thing is he is an athlete, and played goalie in hockey.

The only major problem with color blindness that actually gets in the way is having to deal with people constantly asking you what color things are. He may not always match his clothes perfectly, be good at wiring ethernet cords (they just had to pick the toughest colors, didn't they?), or do well playing Frozen Bubble, but other than that it should have little to no impact on his life. It's something that makes him unique, and I've actually found that because I'm somewhat worse at identifying things through color, I've improved other recognition skills so I can identify objects through other means with virtually no loss. In fact, because I automatically look for other cues, I'm sometimes able to pick out objects even better than the people working through colors.  Basically, he'll be just fine. Once he learns how to put up with all the annoying people, it'll become a part of him he either doesn't think about or is proud of."

The biggest problem you can expect is him thinking bananas are ripe when they aren't quite yet.  Colourblindness is not quite what most people expect.

You understand what's going on with him, he will (maybe not now but soon enough) understand what colorblindess means, but the other handful of kids won't. They will see this as a handicap and will tease him.   If people do find out by accident that's no big deal. And if the teacher knows, it increases the chances that he will never be discovered. It really isn't hard to hide the fact that you are mildly colorblind. People don't simply ask you ""what color is this? what color is that?"".  Best advice: Teach him to determine the color of an object not solely based on his eyes, but also his brain. The sky is blue and the grass is green. Always. A boy would probably wear blue clothes rather than purple ones and so on. You should teach him the colors of fruits and vegetables, and common logos like Milka for example. This will potentially save him from many embarrassing situations among strangers who will not take the time to judge him thoughly, and call him retarded. Of course, you don't have to do this right now, but every now and then when the opportunity rises you can simply let him know that Milka is purple for instance. Although this doesn't work with crayons and book covers, it's a very effective method for a large variety of objects.   Don't worry though. May this be his bigest concern ever in life, not being able to tell apart dark green from brown.  Edit: I accidentaly a word."

Anomalous color vision works much the same way, but only for certain ranges of color, and even in bright light. Conversely, there are also ranges of color your son will find easier to distinguish than you do.  In general, his inability to tell certain colors apart isn't going to affect him any more than your ""inability"" to tell certain colors apart affects you -- unless someone points it out to you, you'll never even know. And the only practical difference is that people will point it out to him a lot more often than they do to you. :-)  The most important thing you can do for him is make sure he knows that he isn't ""weird"" and that there isn't anything ""wrong"" with him.

ColorBlind,1hf3yf,go_boy,4,Sun Jul 28 16:51:01 2013 UTC,"How do I explain this to him?   I think it's mostly just about being understanding when explaining colors to him.  Also, make sure that his school teachers know and to notify art teachers.  My kindergarten teacher yelled at me for using a blue crayon instead of a purple one once.  That was stupid on her part, but it sucked and I was confused.  When you notify them, I would use the term ""color vision deficiency"" as ""colorblind"" can be seen as not being able to see any colors but black and white.    How do I understand how he sees the world? (I can't seem to get my head around this.)   Basically, most colorblind people just see a world with a smaller range of colors in it.  For example, a lot of the green and reds look like a different color to me.  Darker greens and reds look the same as brown.  It's not like we see the world as an alien planet with blue grass and yellow skies.  For most colorblind people, the difference isn't staggering.  I didn't even know I was colorblind until I was 20 years old.   Should I make any changes around the house?   When he gets older, it may help to color-coordinate his closet.  I did this to try and better differentiate between some colors.  It helps when a comparison is side-by-side.  Keep the browns, reds, and greens separate!    Should I point him in any directions/away from some activities?   Nope.  Don't let him get his hopes up of being a pilot.  Unless things change in that field, he won't be able to do it due to regulations.     Does he need any visual aids?   No, they probably won't work.   What kind of doctor should I take him to?(We're in Norway)   You can't treat it, so just make sure he's healthy in every other way.  It's not a huge deal, to be honest.  Just let him be a kid."
ColorBlind,1hf3yf,Stitchopoulis,4,Mon Jul 1 13:08:44 2013 UTC,"This guy knows what he's talking about.  The only thing that I would add is that when you explain his condition to him, be honest. Kids don't tend to care a lot about this stuff as much as we parents do. Just explain that his eyes don't see colors the same way that other people's do. Explain that many people have this condition and it is somewhat normal, but that he may have some problems with this. He should simply ask for help if he thinks his colors may be off and he really cares that they not be.  Heck, my girls are NOT colorblind and they still chose goofy colors when coloring, painting, etc.  Like I said, most kids won't care enough to change their behavior."

Most people have no idea that I'm colorblind unless I tell them. It really doesn't effect my life in any serious way day-to-day. I suppose that I've found that my wardrobe generally drifts toward wearing one color item and one neutral (black, grey, white) item so I don't have to worry about matching as much, if that matters. Oh, and reading graphs or playing games (especially on computer screens) that use red/green pieces is a pain in the ass.  *Edit: Oh, and cooking steaks or burgers is impossible.

Finding out early for me wasn't too bad.  Good thing I started tinkering and got into electronics.  All the way till high school till I realized (dragging my feet) that this would not be feasible in the field either.  Your child will be fine.

I got yelled at in kindergarten because I was refusing to follow instructions. I thought I was coloring that stupid dog brown, but apparently it was red.   As for explaining it to him, splain to him a little about the rods and cones and colors of light, and how some of his are slightly messed up. He may not quite get it at the time, but it lets him know that there's a (relatively) simple medical reason he can't see the colors properly, and it's not because he's stupid or doesn't know his colors.   But on the other end of the spectrum, you don't need to make a big deal out of it. To me it's slightly more interesting than being left-handed. It's a conversation point, and for most of us is not a major disability. Just get him colored pencils and crayons with the colors written on there."

Make sure he has fresh crayons/colored pencils, and the communal ones are almost universally missing their labels (Or at the cheap kind that were never labeled at all!). Ideally the teachers would all be understanding, but really it is easier just to buy new crayons than count on everyone in his life to understand why the tree is red.  Also, since you are buying his clothes stick with two color schemes (Perhaps one at this age), Today I like an ""earthtones"" (Khakis and whatnot) set that goes together and a ""Works with bluejeans"" set that goes together. Try to keep things clearly in each set so clashing things that make sense to me aren't a source of teasing (They absolutely were) I'm not saying it is a huge deal, but not being totally fashion challenged in later elementary school/early middle can be important. (And when he starts shopping for himself don't be afraid to tell him that those mustard colored pants look very ugly and don't go with the purple t-shirt...)  Don't worry too much, other than that it affects very little. Driving red/green is an issue, Xmas colors are bland, though there will be some careers like pilot/train conductor/photographer that will be forever out of his reach, but really... jumping the gun to try to discourage that at this point."

Apply sunscreen every 30 minutes when I go outside. If I look fine afterwards without having reapplied every 30 minutes, I will be burned 5-8 hours after leaving the sun. If I look tan (regardless of application), then I will be burned 5-8 hours after leaving the sun. If I look burned (regardless of application), then I will be HOLY MOTHER OF GOD WHEN WAS THIS FABRIC REPLACED WITH SANDPAPER 5-8 hours after leaving the sun.

Furthermore in accordance to the law they only need to provide ""reasonable accomodation,"" however, if your job requires color sensitive and intensive activities (such as huge amounts of wiring using color coded cables/wires - although many cables/wires are now printed with identifiers for this specific reason) they can say you are unfit (it's kinda the same way a person who has no idea how to operate a computer can't be a tech support). Anywho, if it really doesn't affect your job that much you can show them by doing practical examples and you should be fine."

ColorBlind,1gbfp3,deraffe,12,Fri Jun 14 03:55:23 2013 UTC,"Well, colors don't exist outside your head.  In the 'real' world, there are simply a range of electro-magnetic frequencies in varying combinations.  Your eyes are sensitive to some of these and your brain converts that to colours.  As a protanope, I have no problem imagining that others see red as a much brighter colour and that, for them, purple is far more vivid.  I do have trouble imagining an entirely new colour and I'm guessing that is because the brain evolved to see a specific range of colours only."
ColorBlind,1gbfp3,isionous,4,Fri Jun 14 05:12:04 2013 UTC,"everyone also has ""rod""-type cells that respond to a bigger range of frequencies than individual ""cones"". At least that is how I have always been explaining myself why I sometimes can differentiate between colors that would normally look the same to me, given enough light.   Rods only affect color vision in low-light scenarios where scotopic and mesotopic vision occurs.  In high-light scenarios (with photopic vision), rods have minimal effect on color vision.  The ability to discriminate colors is enhanced as lighting becomes brighter (up to a point), but that is due to the behavior of cones, not rods.  Cones need bright conditions to perform well. (edit: Also, it helps for the object to take up a larger portion of your field of view; color discrimination is hard when the visual area is small.)   Why would that [describing the experience of a color to someone who hasn't experienced it] be impossible?   Humans don't seem to be very good at communicating subjective experiences directly.  Usually, we refer to common experiences and build upon that.  For instance, explaining to someone what nausea is usually involves trying to get that person to recall a time where they experienced nausea or something similar.  If humans get better at introspecting their own brains, perhaps they could communicate subjective experiences more directly by saying, ""Hey, John, put neuron group X into configuration Y and nausea will result"".  And perhaps John could even be smart enough to know that configuration Y would be unpleasant even before he puts his neurons into configuration Y."
ColorBlind,1gbfp3,jobigoud,2,Fri Jun 14 12:09:25 2013 UTC,"It should also be noted that colors experienced by dichromats are not the same and cannot be described to a trichromat.   If you're protanope, your green is different than mine (trichromat) because my brain use a mix of M and L cones to construct this color, and I cannot remove the L cones component of the mix.   Your green is an imaginary color to me.  (And that's why I think all the ""color blind simulators"" are only emulating the limits in hue discrimination, rather than really simulating what one would see.)."
ColorBlind,1gbfp3,Pill_Cosby,1 point,Fri Jun 14 19:36:18 2013 UTC,"""The green you see"" as a Protanope is still another color a normal can see. Like with purple, you would see it as a blue. Eliminate the red in purple and you get a blue that I see too elsewhere."

ColorBlind,1g4lwp,RNHdb25,2,Wed Jun 12 06:01:43 2013 UTC,"But would that be considered neurological changes, or merely adaptation? That's kind of the crux of the authors argument, is that because of his ""disability"" his body repurposed cognitive ability.  I would disagree, at least in the case of colorblindness, that we merely adapt. Our ""disability"" has to do with rod and cone deficiencies, not decreased neurological capacity of our eyes which then frees up brain power to perceive things differently from our ""normal"" sighted peers.  Being forced to learn new techniques to perceive things, thus having a greater background to fall back on should tests/color/etc become ineffective or undetectable would be an advantage, but any of your peers could learn those techniques. It's not really an exclusive advantage I guess, and it does take time to learn those techniques when ""color vision normal"" peers can simply measure by color."

Honestly I'm not sure if id want my eyes to be normal after 25 years of being colorblind, or 8 being cognizant of it.
