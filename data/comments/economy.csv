Since 2008 we've essentially been paying off one credit card with another, call me a doomsdayer but sadly I believe there's no way out of this hole, not this one. Either the world defaults and resets or we keep loading up on more debt which will drain the worlds savings until it's gone. I seriously hope I'm wrong believe me, I just don't see anyway out"

That, combined with the 140 trillion unfunded and funded liabilities the US has (with the resultant risk of a economic slump), could lead to a lot of people moving away from dealing in US dollars.   The China International Payment System (a competitor to SWIFT) will also ensure that many businesses and  people transact money in Yuans and not USD.  The world will be less under US control. Recently, the US Treasury fined BNP Paribas 900 million USD for dealing with an entity in Cuba, though the US opened up relations with Cuba after that, and those people are unlikely to forget that sting. More people will deal in Yuans, using CIPS than USD/SWIFT combination. This will have both massive geopolitical and economic fallout. More power to China: the writing is on the wall."

Adding the Yuan only lessens the aversions to holding the Yuan. It will still need to compete against the Pound, the Yen, etc. as a basket currency.  It makes sense to add it given the size of the economy but the Chinese government has a long way to go to really get the trust of investors. Just look at how they handled the market taking a nose dive. Large investors are completly barred from dumping stock at the moment."
economy,3dpuaw,Aleksandr_Kerensky,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:11:31 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the US has dug itself into a deep hole economically. If the Unfunded liabilities are 'Optional"" why would they be mentioned in the books in the first place? They are absolutely valid liabilities like student Loans, medicare which are certainly a legal and binding liability and have to be paid sometime: they can't be made to go away. They can be considered ""optional"" in the sense that the US certainly has the option of defaulting on them, like saying ""I choose not to pay this loan."" to a bank. But then, a sovereign default will of course happen with all the consequences thereof, world economy meltdown and which will hit the US first.  China will be hit too, as they hold most of US treasuries, but have been de-leveraging them.  Yuan is a very strong currency, which have been declared as 'undervalued' by the US treasury. If it is undervalued, it makes sense in holding more of them, as they are certainly going to gain, not lose in value.  I completely agree that Chinese Government have a long way to go before earning the complete trust of investors, but they are a new player and give the international investors an option to the US Dollar. There are very strong inflows of investment in China already, but none are betting their nest egg on China yet.   Bottom line: there is stiff competition to the USD/SWIFT system and many investors are going to gradually shift over to the CIPS/YUAN as that will help non-US businesses make easier transactions, and without the complex regulations and cost of compliance with the current system set up by the US."

We hand Israel money with the condition they spend many times that much on buying stuff from us.  They buy from our defense industry, which then pays lots of money to lots of employees who then pay income tax with that money which basically covers the cost of the aid.  It's pretty much a net-neutral deal for the government, a win for the US defense industry, and a loss for other country's defense industries.  The net effect on the US economy is a slight strengthening of the job market."
economy,3dn76x,Dugen,-1,Sat Jul 18 13:29:20 2015 UTC,"Not really.  If we stopped the aid and Israel took it's arms budget elsewhere, the net effect would be a lot of people in the US out of work, and a lot of the money they spent into the economy would also be lost, which ends up yielding a reduction of income tax coming into the federal government.  You get back 4.8 billion in spending and lose some number of billions in tax revenue.  It's entirely likely that the losses would exceed the gains.

The real explosion of real consumer costs. And flat salaries, or declining incomes (esp for savers).  2) the 0.1%'ers to 1%'ers cannot spend enough to bouy the economy.  3) there is a significant loss of confidence, by both consumers and investors, as everyone on mainstreet knows that excessive financial leverage, lack of real world price discouvery, and artificial government created asset bubbles, are not the way to handle an economy. This loss of confidence leads to lower speding. 4)  low interest also drops ""the savers"" out of consumer economy and off set and gains by over indebted consumers 5) in the main cities, where the jobs are, the high housing prices prevent locals buying at any price,  so lower borrowing rates do ""zip"". However, the lower dollar will encourage off shore cash buyers to drive prices up some more. Higher prices, lower rates, means ""same mortgage"" cost. 6) few people in mainstreet can benefit from these lower rates. Unless you are a bank able to play the carrage-trade profit trick.  The reality is, there is no free-market left, this is government manipulaton for special interst, these lower rates by BOC is solely for the benefit of predominatly the majoity 72% foreign ownership of tar-sands, so as the shareholders of tar-sands, can maintain a 12% ROI, by matching oil price drops with a falling dollar.   That mainstreet is screwed-over, with the resulting inflation and asset bubbles, and loss of income for the savers, is just """"friendly"" collateral fire""; but easily covered by fool articles on how this outcome is really good for us, and that there is ""no choice"" - which just means for mainstreet - eat shit and love it."

This makes the situation completely different from Greece, which has some of the most expensive workers in the EU.  But this isn't because of some decision made by either Slovenia or Greece, it's a carryover from the historical state of the economy at accession to the currency union. It is much, much easier for Slovenia, because of its historically low wages, to follow the ""preferred"" German model of exporting your way to success (forgetting for the moment that there has to be someone to buy your exports). Low wages = cheaper exports.  This is the same problem that people who trot out the amazing success story of Lithuania and its immunity to a Greek style crisis, where everyone seems to be collectively ignorant of the character and wage competitiveness of the economies in question, and how they came to be that way.

It would certainly help local trades that's currently being killed by the daily withdrawal limits (I heard the fish market that only accepts cash is being hit particularly hard.)  The main problem is that Greece imports a lot of inelastic goods from overseas: Food, medicine, energy, things that they can't just start producing themselves, and things that they can't just say 'oh well, it was good while it lasted' and quit once they're cut off from international trade.  They're not going to be able to buy these things using their own toy money.  Leaving Eurozone would allow creditors to seriously consider debt relief, everybody knows there's no way Greece will be able to manage the current debt burden, creditors cannot do the economically sensible thing and just let it go because it would create disastrous moral hazard; kind of like badly managed insurance service tend to create a lot of arsonists.    If they suffer the disastrous consequence of exiting the single currency, then there are fewer moral hazards to give them a debt haircut, and once they recovered enough, they can contemplate rejoining the Eurozone.

economy,3ddsn4,ConfirmedCynic,12,Wed Jul 15 16:17:23 2015 UTC,"In the restaurant business, the cost of the food and drink served is, unsurprisingly, a substantial portion of weekly costs.

economy,3ddsn4,gishnon,12,Wed Jul 15 16:27:47 2015 UTC,"Sure,  it is the majority cost, but not by much, and that isn't even the point.  In this example, the food/beverage cost for the current week is $4,950 while the wage cost is $5,342 with a total cost of 10,292.  As /u/ConfirmedCynic pointed out this doesn't include rent and utilities, but let's pretend rent and power are free.  In this example, the hourly employee wages are $2,979.  If that were to increase by %10 we get $3,276.  Let's also assume the benefits cost also increase by 10% from $963 to $1059.  Let's assume the management are already making more than minimum wage, so we just add them back in 1,400 + 3,276 + $1,059= $5,735.  Now add back in food cost + $4,950 = $10,685.  Original cost $10,292 * 100%)/(new cost)$10,685 = 96.3%.  In a world where rent and utilities are free, the total increase would be 3.7%.  Admittedly this is not a great example, considering tipping culture in sit down restaurants (Wait staff paid between $2 and $3/hour) vs fast food (actually paid minimum wage), but the point remains the same:  Wages aren't the only cost involved in running a restaurant, so a 10% minimum wage increase does not equal a 10% cost increase.  A 10% minimum wage increase does not even equal a 10% wage increase since there are undoubtedly employees already making more than the minimum wage."

economy,3ddsn4,baronOfNothing,6,Thu Jul 16 03:12:05 2015 UTC,This is true. Minimum wage is a band-aid on the larger problem of a captive labor market. What you're describing only works if both parties have equal ability to walk away from the deal (exchanging labor for money). This is only possible if poverty is largely eliminated. In other words: /r/BasicIncome
economy,3ddsn4,Moimoi328,0,Thu Jul 16 03:52:47 2015 UTC,"What you're describing only works if both parties have equal ability to walk away from the deal (exchanging labor for money).   Your logic is faulty for two key reasons.  First - there aren't only two parties.  It is the job seeker - and the millions of potential employers for that job seeker.  The job seeker has the ability to walk away at any time.  Second, the fact that the job seeker is highly motivated to enter in to an employment contract is irrelevant.  You might as well say that a consumer has no ability to walk away from their local grocery store because they don't have the ability to not consume food.  Doesn't work that way."
economy,3ddsn4,baronOfNothing,6,Wed Jul 15 16:51:52 2015 UTC,"It is the job seeker - and the millions of potential employers for that job seeker.   Wtf? Couldn't someone flip this around and say it's just one employer and all the potential job seekers? What is even the point of saying this? In any labor contract there are only two parties (unless a union gets involved), employer and employee. The other potential employers and job seekers are what define the market.  Second it is the same as the market for any other essential item, including food. The difference is markets behave fundamentally differently when the item is scarce. Food is not scarce. Jobs (to some degree) are. There are only a limited number of job opportunities in the economy. It's much more difficult to go into your backyard and create a job than it is to create a garden.  At this point you might be thinking: ""wait, isn't starting a garden in your backyard essentially creating a new job for yourself, aka a gardener/farmer?"" Yes. This might seem to defeat the argument but instead it just shifts it to the real scarce resource that the economy is built on: land. Without the land, there is no way to create a job for yourself. If there is a shortage of food, it's easy for the economy to increase food production, because it is incentivised to. When there is a shortage of jobs the same incentivisation is not really there (there is some, due to lowered labor costs, but it's not the same)."
economy,3ddsn4,Moimoi328,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:13:46 2015 UTC,"Wtf? Couldn't someone flip this around and say it's just one employer and all the potential job seekers?   No, because the labor market isn't governed by a single company with labor pricing power.  The employee, not the employer, is the one with the flexibility.  The employee can move to an employer of choice - an employer can't easily pick up an office building, factory, etc to move to the employee.   The difference is markets behave fundamentally differently when the item is scarce. Food is not scarce.    Why?  The slope of the curve may become exponential at the margins, but the laws of supply and demand still work properly.  Consider gasoline shortages after a hurricane.  Secondly - jobs aren't scarce either.  The vast majority of people who want to work ARE working.   Yes. This might seem to defeat the argument but instead it just shifts it to the real scarce resource that the economy is built on: land. Without the land, there is no way to create a job for yourself.   Ok, fair enough, but your point is still moot.  How is it that the Japanese can build such a manufacturing powerhouse of an economy on such a small amount of land?  Their economy is simply structured in a radically different fashion than the land-rich US.  Land is not a limiting factor in this discussion."

If you are doing things that could be automated, then you are only worth up to the implementation cost of the automation.. Nothing more.  Ben and Jerry's already tried to limit CEO wage, they couldn't attract proper talent and the company almost ran itself into the ground. They had to walk that back to find a skilled enough CEO to grow the business.  A CEO is paid what he is worth, and if the CEO can bring in hundreds of millions more in revenue, then he is well worth millions to the shareholders..

Current levels of compensation are not based on the theory of value added labour, but simply on the mechanics of negotiation positioning.   A minimum wage worker has nairy the chance to pick up and move to another state, so he must find work to survive. If the only work available for his level of skill is below a living wage, he will just have to take it so at least something is coming in. There is no calculation of how much he is contributing to the company: the company is simply offering the highest of the lowest value they can attract people with and the minimum wage."

It could also help them because they might be more likely to retain a good employee and not have to train someone new.   But what I think the article was trying to point out is that there are lots of other costs of doing business so there is not a 1:1 ratio between labor costs and price of goods. That's how you get the calculation that a $15/hr wage at McDonald's would only require something like a 0.20 cent increase in the price of a Big Mac to maintain current profit margins.   Business owners also sometimes absorb increases in products because they know consumers are price sensitive and it's not wise to pass every cost on when it could turn customers away.   And we always hear about how prices will need to go up when workers make more but no one ever says that we have to cut CEO pay in order to bring prices down, or reduce stock buybacks, options, or dividends. Making $10million per year each instead of $15million each is actually an option for the Chipotle CEOs."

economy,3ddsn4,kennys_logins,0,Thu Jul 16 05:04:04 2015 UTC,"Well, did you factor in the time for:   Growing, harvesting and processing the produce Delivering that produce to the store Making the fridge that keeps the produce before you eat it Clean the kitchen first (I hope!) Make the brochure/menu/recipe/sign that made you buy in that particular shop Building the furniture/till in the shop Generating gas/electricity for cooking the produce Throwing away the produce that nobody bought that day Waiting for the next customer during quiet hours Starting the company, finding people/location and money to start with Building and maintaining the shop   Basically time is money. If you are lucky your company are doing many of these, but as it is hard to be good at everything, most likely multiple actors/investors have contributed and benefit."

economy,3ddsn4,PoliticalTheater101,-2,Wed Jul 15 22:15:51 2015 UTC,"Because it ends up being a company with less employee turnover, more satisfied employees, and so more productive. This leads to an increase in the value of the business over time, which in the long run is reflected in a higher share price.   A smart board only distributes dividends if they cannot find an investment that is worth a rate of return over their cost of capital plus  50 basis point to account for risk. Otherwise, it's just a pump and dump exercise that only benefits the shareholders in the short-term forgoing the long term."
economy,3ddsn4,Skiffbug,3,Wed Jul 15 21:42:54 2015 UTC,That does not make me want to buy premium stock in a company.  If you want a long term investment buy bonds.

That has been their business strategy for a while now and chances are it will remain that way.

As for Walmart, it is often more expensive to constantly train new workers and deal with their lack of productivity and mistakes until they come up to speed than it is to pay more for workers to stay longer. It isn't a perfect correlation between lower wages and lower costs, far from it."

But not many people are as hands on with checking a company out like he is either.  I could also say windows is not a great operating system and there are better os options out there,  but Bill Gates would probably disagree with me too.  Now think about what you just said about how walmart loses productivity in training.  ""Ok you take this box off of the skid and then you put it on the shelf with the other boxes that are like it.""  ""Ok you take the box and you run it over the laser check out system and then you put it in the bag.""  This is the simplest menial labor out there.  Its not like if Ford has a weilder quit or anything like that.  BTW wonder how much of that production they have made up for by installing 8 self check outs manned by one employee?

No.  But it is when you utilize a low cost low quality strategy like walmart uses, you tend to have to pay low wages.  There is no jack of all trades in business model strategy."

So I'm eating pretty cheap considering I only cooked once and buy at a Fresh Market.    Putting in that kind of work does suck.

They don't carry them, people get used to not having them, and there's no demand.  it's a horrible fucked up cycle.  Especially when fresh produce is more economical for the average family especially if they grow them for themselves.  Thats where organizations like Growing Power come in.  they help educate inner city communities, set up community gardens and provide access to fresh produce as well.  It's funny, because the places in the inner city that do offer fresh produce -now- are seeing a major rise in consumption, because of the education that groups like Growing Power do.  As poor inner city families can't afford to be split between homes, you're also seeing a rise in multi-generational homes, and people of older generations (55+ and older) are more apt to use fresh produce and cook from scratch because thats how they learned to cook and provide meals for the family.  Scratch cooking was a skill slowly being eroded away in the inner city.  One of the ""good"" side effects of the big recession was a return to more traditional (non-box/instant/frozen) meals."

If you don't work, you starve to death, you default on mortgages, you fail to pay your doctor.   False dichotomy, bro. It's not ""this job or nothing"". It's ""this job, or a different job, or something else entirely"".   Stop pretending that a worker has exactly one job that they either accept, or they die.    They capture profits without giving any share of it back to employees.    False, absolutely, ridiculously, ludicrously false. The ""share"" the employee gets is the wages or salary they have voluntarily agreed to accept from the company in exchange for their labor.   You need to understand that the company retains profits and subsidizes the losses! The employee exchanges the full value of their labor for the consistency of payment and the avoidance of loss.   If the employee got exactly the value of their labor nobody on earth would hire them because there would be no incentive to do so!   So please stop that nonsense about employees not getting their fair share - it is fair, by definition since the employee agreed to the deal voluntarily, in the face of alternatives. In fact, it's not just fair, it's more than fair, since if the employee is logical, they have chosen to accept the best possible deal they could obtain anywhere. Thus the job they agree to take is actually the best possible one they could locate.

Including, sports participation and a sporting economy for the masses.   Popularity of hockey, allows for the construction of hockey arenas, skate factories, ice dancing classes, etc...       I think this is a much more complex issue than to just ask for opinion from economists without doing the proper leg work.   I think pro sports is too profitable to ask for these subsidees... but to imply that there are little to no economic benefits from having these franchises as center stage in your city, is a little shoddy.  A lot of contributing factors were omitted in the discussion and the only things that were talked about were fans buying tickets... not much was said about the economic benefit of programs  that are non pro who gain direct benefit through popularity of the pro programs.  Zaboni's are expensive as are hockey and football pads.  Someone has to make them, and the pro market represents a very small share of the consumption of the product.   However, it is the center stage for the popularity of these industries.   Just like dog shows may not bring economic prosperity to the pet market, yet they are powerful drivers in product sales and breeder endorsements.   Kind of like Formula1, the investment to make these cars go faster is ridiculously expensive, but it seems to trickle down to consumer technology.

So basically Iran was told that it could not buy the fuel and could not make it either, and those 800,000 cancer patients who relied on isotopes from this reactor for their treatment, could go die.  Yay, good job there. lol  Even ElBaradei, the IAEA head, concluded this:   I have seen the Iranians ready to accept putting a cap on their enrichment [program] in terms of tens of centrifuges, and then in terms of hundreds of centrifuges. But nobody even tried to engage them on these offers. Now Iran has 5,000 centrifuges.   http://www.newsweek.com/elbaradei-iranians-are-not-fanatics-80021  And,   “They weren’t interested in a compromise with the government in Tehran, but regime change – by any means necessary,” http://news.antiwar.com/2011/04/20/elbaradei-us-europe-werent-interested-in-compromise-with-iran/"

Greece is broke, it has debt up to its eyeballs and is literally about to go bankrupt. If something drastic is not done NO ONE will have any money. Forget pensions, nobody will get any money. If you had money in the bank, it'll disappear. If you had a pension, you will no longer get it. If you go to the grocery store, they will have nothing to sell.  Reducing a pension from the ridiculous sum of 96% to something more reasonable like 70% will save the government a ton of money and wont put anyone out on the street and starving, as you suggest.  Making people work until a more reasonable age of 60-65 will also revitalize the economy and take a lot of people off the government's tit.  These basic suggestions will reduce the government's deficit considerably without great harm.   with the country's national heritage being looted   If Greece wants to avoid this (they should) they need to stop spending money they don't have. This is simply reality.   The fat-ass Shylocks should forgive some of the debt   Useless if nothing in Greece changes and they keep running up massive deficits; they'll be right back where we are today in a year. Change MUST happen, this is not an option, it's a requirement, one way or another. If Greece does not change its ways, it will go bankrupt, be kicked out of the euro and will have massive inflation in their worthless currency on par with Argentina decades ago.   do their due diligence with more caution next time   What are you suggesting? That they should not have bailed out Greece years ago and let them ""starve"" as you put it?

Greece would have good reasons to leave the euro-zone on an economical level.  But Greece is more important than Iceland (sorry Icelanders, no offence), Greece's debt is bigger and is the gateway to the east and this is for some people the biggest issue. Russia is the issue, and this economic event leads now to geopolitics.   Then there is the problem of ""if Greece leaves, why shouldn't we leave too?"" many countries would find great interest in leaving the euro, and this can be as simple as a new government declaring they would leave the euro-zone.  This is the direct weakness of the euro, if everyone leaves the euro won't have any legitimacy and won't be used anymore, and that's the death of the eurozone.

economy,3d96d3,iul,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:28:05 2015 UTC,"The short answer is they could switch to Drachma but they would not be able to maintain parity with the Euro. The Drachma would fall like a stone. The value of a currency depends on the wealth of the nation printing it and the Greeks are effectively bankrupt. Therefore, for anyone to accept Drachma in exchange for goods they would want a lot of them. So, imports would become hugely expensive and Greeks would need to live largely off what they produced themselves until they repaired the economy. That would mean a couple of decades of pain.

The money was earned overseas and the feds want an unreasonable cut to bring it back.  35% is a crazy number.  Highest number in the developed world.

economy,3d166n,BIgDandRufus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:12:17 2015 UTC,True but the effective tax rate is much lower than 35% and for most companies of that size it is less than 15%.

That's true of US earnings, but earnings brought back from a foreign country are not going to get any of the tax breaks that US earnings do.  So they will pay 35% on every dime they repatriate to the US.   Incorporate under a different country if you don't like our tax laws.   They have.  Apple has a corporation in China (and various other countries) that's holding all the money.  Same with Microsoft, GE, Ford, and all the other big companies people are bitching about.  The money was earned under a foreign subsidiary and taxed by the foreign governments.  If we want to drive the US economy we should set corporate tax rate of 0%, tax dividends and capital gains as regular income.

I think it's time to have some kind of partially-Internet based system instead of the inept and often corrupt politicians we have today. The average American is smarter then they were 200 years ago.

I don't disagree with the remainder of your post, but it is a misconception that money saved is money removed from the economy. They are not swimming in pools of money or stuffing mattresses with cash. All that money gets invested as capital to create new companies or upgrade old factories. I would argue that society gets more benefit (in the long term) from money saved than money spent."
economy,3d166n,DrWyckoff,5,Mon Jul 13 05:22:57 2015 UTC,"Ask yourself this. If the money was going to be reinvested back into a factory, why would they take it out in the first place and pay tax on it? Why wouldn't they keep it in as retained earnings? Most of the money goes into stocks and bonds which are beneficial to the economy, but not as beneficial as consumption spending. That is why I am in favor of lowering business taxes (so they have more retained earnings to reinvest in inventory or a factory) but raising the marginal tax rate to discourage the rich from taking millions in excess of what they need out of their business. Stocks and bonds and investments are good, but using that money for inventory is a lot more direct and better for the economy as a whole in my opinion."
economy,3d166n,blackhawks93,5,Mon Jul 13 05:28:37 2015 UTC,"Most economists would argue that the ""trickle-down"" phenomenon you describe (supply side economics) does not happen.  From this wiki article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics#Criticisms   A 2012 study by the Tax Justice Network indicates that wealth of the super-rich does not trickle down to improve the economy, but tends to be amassed and sheltered in tax havens with a negative effect on the tax bases of the home economy.[18]  University of Cambridge professor Ha-Joon Chang criticised the policies of trickle down in several publications, citing examples of: ""slowing job growth in the last few decades, rising income inequality in most rich nations, and the inability provision in raising living standards across all income brackets rather than at the top only"".[19]  A 2015 report by the International Monetary Fund argues that there is no trickle-down effect as the rich get richer: ""We find that increasing the income share of the poor and the middle class actually increases growth while a rising income share of the top 20 percent results in lower growth—that is, when the rich get richer, benefits do not trickle down.""[20]"

Money moving over-seas into tax havens certainly hurts the nation in question, there is no doubt about that. But I tend to be anti-nationalist and I care more about the aggregate effect of all nations in the long term.

Choices around living area, neighborhood, family, community all enter into a housing selection.  For people who are prioritizing these things over maximum salary, a home purchase can often be a good way to secure the life they want with the people they love.    To put it as an example, do you want to be the parent who tells their 15 year old child that they need to move to a totally different city for the 5th time in 10 years, and that while you understand that they just now finally have some new friends, that the family's ""financial stability"" is more important than their friendships, and that while life was running smoothly, having more money is more important.

economy,3cp6vp,PostNationalism,5,Thu Jul 9 17:36:14 2015 UTC,"Copied from r/economics  Article Text:   Greece debt crisis: Milton Friedman's 1997 prediction of the eurozone disaster by Milton Friedman  Penned in 1997, the late professor Milton Friedman, argued the drive for the Euro was motivated by politics not economics, aiming to make a future European war impossible. He said that adoption of the Euro would have the opposite effect. Here's what he wrote:  A common currency is an excellent monetary arrangement under some circumstances, a poor monetary arrangement under others. Whether it is good or bad depends primarily on the adjustment mechanisms that are available to absorb the economic shocks and dislocations that impinge on the various entities that are considering a common currency. Flexible exchange rates are a powerful adjustment mechanism for shocks that affect the entities differently. It is worth dispensing with this mechanism to gain the advantage of lower transaction costs and external discipline only if there are adequate alternative adjustment mechanisms.  The United States is an example of a situation that is favorable to a common currency. Though composed of fifty states, its residents overwhelmingly speak the same language, listen to the same television programs, see the same movies, can and do move freely from one part of the country to another; goods and capital move freely from state to state; wages and prices are moderately flexible; and the national government raises in taxes and spends roughly twice as much as state and local governments. Fiscal policies differ from state to state, but the differences are minor compared to the common national policy.  Unexpected shocks may well affect one part of the United States more than others -- as, for example, the Middle East embargo on oil did in the 1970s, creating an increased demand for labour and boom conditions in some states, such as Texas, and unemployment and depressed conditions in others, such as the oil-importing states of the industrial Midwest. The different short-run effects were soon mediated by movements of people and goods, by offsetting financial flows from the national to the state and local governments, and by adjustments in prices and wages.  By contrast, Europe's common market exemplifies a situation that is unfavourable to a common currency. It is composed of separate nations, whose residents speak different languages, have different customs, and have far greater loyalty and attachment to their own country than to the common market or to the idea of ""Europe"". Despite being a free trade area, goods move less freely than in the United States, and so does capital.  The European Commission based in Brussels, indeed, spends a small fraction of the total spent by governments in the member countries. They, not the European Union's bureaucracies, are the important political entities. Moreover, regulation of industrial and employment practices is more extensive than in the United States, and differs far more from country to country than from American state to American state. As a result, wages and prices in Europe are more rigid, and labour less mobile. In those circumstances, flexible exchange rates provide an extremely useful adjustment mechanism.  If one country is affected by negative shocks that call for, say, lower wages relative to other countries, that can be achieved by a change in one price, the exchange rate, rather than by requiring changes in thousands on thousands of separate wage rates, or the emigration of labour. The hardships imposed on France by its ""franc fort"" policy illustrate the cost of a politically inspired determination not to use the exchange rate to adjust to the impact of German unification. Britain's economic growth after it abandoned the European Exchange Rate Mechanism a few years ago to refloat the pound illustrates the effectiveness of the exchange rate as an adjustment mechanism.  Proponents of the ""Euro"" often cite the gold standard era from 1879 to 1914 as demonstrating the benefits of a common currency. But the gold standard also had its costs. The period was characterized by declining prices from 1879 to 1896, rising prices thereafter, and sharp fluctuations within each period, especially severe in the 1890s. The standard was viable only because governments were small (spending in the neighborhood of 10 per cent of the national income rather than 50 or more per cent as now), prices and wages were highly flexible, and the public was willing to tolerate, or had no way to moderate, wide swings in output and employment. Take away the rose-colored glasses and it was hardly a period or a system to emulate.  As of today, a subgroup of the European Union -- perhaps Germany, the Benelux countries, and Austria -- come closer to satisfying the conditions favorable to a common currency than does the EU as a whole. And they currently have the equivalent of a common currency. Austria and the Benelux three have, to all intents and purposes, linked their currencies to the Deutschmark. However, these countries still retain their central banks and hence can break the link at will. Any country that wishes to link to the Deutschmark more firmly can do so on its own, simply by replacing its central bank with a currency board, as some countries (such as Estonia) outside the EU have done.  The drive for the Euro has been motivated by politics not economics. The aim has been to link Germany and France so closely as to make a future European war impossible, and to set the stage for a federal United States of Europe. I believe that adoption of the Euro would have the opposite effect. It would exacerbate political tensions by converting divergent shocks that could have been readily accommodated by exchange rate changes into divisive political issues. Political unity can pave the way for monetary unity. Monetary unity imposed under unfavorable conditions will prove a barrier to the achievement of political unity.

economy,3cnuid,thedomage,3,Thu Jul 9 19:43:31 2015 UTC,"Greece requested a new three-year bailout from its skeptical eurozone creditors and pledged some economic overhauls on Wednesday, but the euphoria some Greeks felt after Sunday’s “no” vote on the last deal was fading fast.  Whether European leaders accept the Greek government’s application for more emergency loans at a crisis summit Sunday still depends on Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras making a drastic turnaround on pension cuts, tax increases and other austerity measures after five months of often-acrimonious negotiations.  “The actual examination can only begin once the full package has been put on the table,” said a spokesman for German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, who has pushed a hard line on Greece and made clear that Germany is prepared for a potential Greek exit from the eurozone.  His comments echo those of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said Tuesday night that a new three-year aid program for Greece would require measures—including changes to labor laws, product markets and the privatization of state assets—that had been dropped from negotiations in recent months.  The unyielding tone left Greeks on both sides of the bailout debate grappling Wednesday with the possibility that Mr. Tsipras pushed things too far, as a second week of capital controls and closed banks start to affect the supply of many goods, including medicine, and the specter looms of being forced out of the eurozone if no deal is struck.  In the face of that prospect, the U.S. and the International Monetary Fund Wednesday issued their most forceful calls yet for Europe to restructure Greece’s debt.  ENLARGE U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said Greece’s debt burdens would overwhelm the country without eurozone lenders, particularly Germany, reducing its overall debt load.  “Greece’s debt is not sustainable,” Mr. Lew said. “The real question is, can [Greece] make the changes that will satisfy Europe to put in place the kind of debt restructuring that needs to be there.”  In the affluent suburb of Nea Erythrea, north of Athens, Iosif Perdikaris, a 72-year-old pensioner suffering from diabetes, was looking for insulin, an import made scarce by the ban on foreign bank transfers. When he was told at the third pharmacy he visited that there wasn’t any in stock, he snapped.  “How am I supposed to manage my diabetes without my insulin?” Mr. Perdikaris screamed at the pharmacist.  Countdown to a Greek Showdown ENLARGE He said he was starting to regret voting against creditors’ terms for a bailout in last Sunday’s referendum.  “I voted ‘no’ and now look at this,” he said. “I can’t get my medications, and next week we may be using drachmas.”  Like many of those who sided with Mr. Tsipras in the referendum, Mr. Perdikaris was convinced the resounding “no” vote would strengthen the young leader’s hand in talks in Brussels.  But that confidence is being shaken by continuing tough negotiations with creditors.  Greek banks will likely run out of cash by the end of the week, two senior Greek bankers said.  “Not all banks will run out of cash at once,” one of the bankers said, “but they’ll all be out within hours of each other.”  Related Video 0:00 / 0:00 Eurozone leaders set Greece a Sunday deadline to come up with new economic measures to avoid a potential euro exit. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras pledged to make “concrete proposals” in the next few days aimed at bridging an impasse with international creditors. Photo: AP Shortages of medications like Mr. Perdikaris’s insulin are beginning to bite, compounding distress especially among older Greeks.  Parents of babies and young children are stocking up on formula and other basic medications, pharmacists say.  “In some cases, we have shortages because people are freaking out panic-buying. We’re trying to advise them against that,” said Mando Nikolopoulou, a pharmacist.  “We’re seeing significant shortages in heart and blood-pressure medications, but I’m less worried about that because there are Greek-made generics that people can turn to when the branded ones run out for good,” she said. “But insulin, that’s critical—diabetics need it to survive, and we’re really low on stocks.”  People who voted in favor of the deal with creditors Sunday are watching the fraught talks with yet more horror. Having never believed Mr. Tsipras’s promises of a more-lenient bailout deal in the first place, many of them are now feeling disturbingly vindicated.  At upmarket mall Golden Hall in Marousi, a long line formed outside an ATM—now a familiar ritual in Greece.  Yiannis Konstantinidis, a 74-year-old grandfather to two little girls, refused to join the queue, even though he could have done with an extra €60 ($66)—the maximum daily withdrawal amount under capital-control rules.  “I brought the kids to have a bit of fun, to buy them ice cream,” he said as 6-year-old Chryssa pulled on his hand. “They may be young but they know something’s wrong. The television is playing at home all day, there are people lining up at the banks, they’re asking me ‘what’s happening, Grandpa?’”  “I just want Tsipras to get a deal, any deal, but it looks like the Europeans are fed up with us now,” Mr. Konstantinidis said, adding he had voted with the minority of Greeks who backed the creditors’ proposals, which he believed would secure the country’s euro membership despite hitting pensioners like himself hard.  Mr. Tsipras’s government said that some overhauls, including measures linked to taxation and pensions that have been at the center of the standoff between Greece and its creditors, would be implemented as early as next week.  But Mr. Tsipras said his government would choose its own measures to ensure that a final deal was “effective and fair.”  “We respect the eurozone rules, but we also have the right to choose where we as a sovereign government will put the tax burden,” he said. “It’s the sovereign right of any government to decide to increase tax on profit-making businesses and not cut back on the lowest pensions.”  Much of the Greek press was turning the pressure on Mr. Tsipras more than ever, even as left-wing media continued to back his handling of the crisis talks.  “Euro or drachma on Sunday,” was Wednesday’s headline on Greece’s leading broadsheet newspaper Kathimerini, which campaigned in favor of a “yes” vote at the referendum. In an editorial it urged Mr. Tsipras to either ignore his party and do his “patriotic duty” by sealing a deal with Greece’s creditors, or to form a national unity government to get a last-minute deal at all costs.  In the Athens district of Pangrati, some “no” voters were still optimistic a deal would be reached at the 11th hour. Faith in Mr. Tsipras is slower to evaporate here than in wealthier areas, and many people are shrugging off the limitations on cash withdrawals.  “I don’t even have enough money in my account to withdraw €60 a day,” said 27-year-old Ioanna Mouzaki, an unemployed IT expert sipping on a coffee as she sat with friends at a popular square. She said she believed Greece’s international creditors were playing a tug of war with Athens, but would eventually blink and keep Greece in the eurozone.  “I don’t believe the Europeans will punish Greece just for having a referendum and telling them that we can’t take any more austerity,” she said.  “Besides, you know what we say in Greece, don’t you? Hope dies last.”"

If the US stock market fell without any safety nets, then the middle class would be very little affected. Now, the reason that the Chinese stock market was so propped up was because the Chinese government was giving money to people who couldn't afford to invest in the stock market and that's why it grew by almost 270% so fast.

The US recovered the money from the banks (this time), but taxpayers in UK and Germany lost billions:   The United Kingdom and Germany, by way of contrast, both enacted bailouts that were less effective in helping taxpayers share in the potential upside of the bailout. As a result, U.K. and German taxpayers were stuck with large book losses on their bailouts: $14 billion for the United Kingdom, and $55 billion for Germany Washington post   In any case, should taxpayers be obligated to bail out too big to fail companies that fail due to risky behaviour?

When you bought that over priced stock, or borrowed money into existence to speculate, that money got spent and somebody on the other side got paid."

economy,3cjz34,spaceghoti,4,Wed Jul 8 14:33:22 2015 UTC,"Great article! TLDR:  The number of investors in the Chinese stock market is going up, and it is largely new middle class individual investors.  They are borrowing money to buy on margin (like pre-1929 US) and it pushed up stock prices (like a bubble, not like actual growth).  So the Chinese regulators tried to rein in such risky behavior, but that made stock prices fall.  But since so many new investors are individuals, a fall like this could wipe out their life savings!  So the government is panicking and trying to prop up stock prices."

economy,3cikcu,TYsir,5,Wed Jul 8 13:09:06 2015 UTC,Unlikely unless your bank has blurred the lines and has a checking and savings branch for individual customers.   This will force banks like BofA to not combine their investment side (Merril Lynch) with their checking and savings side. BofA will have to split from Merrill I believe.  In an extremely simplified way it means investment banks cannot use their customers accounts as part of their financial investments.
economy,3cikcu,Jra805,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:25:31 2015 UTC,makes sense. we are more retail and loan and no investment.  it seems like the goal is really just to not have all the eggs in so few baskets. wouldn't we run into similar problems with too big to fail if an investment bank holding high amounts of pensions and retirement funds? wouldn't the customer accounts give the investment side more stability?

Does anyone else get a weird feeling that the shit is already hitting the fan and we don’t know it yet? Overnight the Chinese stock market crashes by 5% despite every effort of their communist government to stem the tide.  Then every United/Continental plane in the country was grounded because their computer system went down.  The Wall Street Journal website has also been down today.  And now the NYSE has been down for over an hour. Stocks in the United States cannot be traded. It’s funny how this only happens when the stock market is down by 200 points. How come the NYSE never breaks on big time up days? Never.  Did the powers that be “break” the stock market because it was about to plunge by 1,000 points? Are they purposely manipulating the systems to prevent an all out collapse? There is nothing underpinning this market. It is built on hot air and debt. The immense level of margin debt will create a waterfall collapse once certain stock levels are breached.  All is not right. I have an eerie feeling that something bad is about to happen. But, I’ve been wrong before.  So resume your denial and delusion until further notice."

economy,3cmgd4,ThePoliticalHat,2,Thu Jul 9 01:26:38 2015 UTC,"I love those fantasy stories about central bankers being all-powerful and able to levitate stock markets forever. They make me all warm and fuzzy. In case you hadn’t noticed, the Chinese central bankers and communist party politicians have been desperately trying to stop their stock market from crashing. EPIC FAIL!!!  It plunged another 5% overnight. They have halted trading on 40% of their stocks and it keeps falling. They ban short selling and it continues to fall. They ban the press from talking negatively about the stock market and it keeps falling. They instruct their government agencies to buy stocks and it continues to fall. The omnipotence of central bankers is being proven to be a fraud.  Anyone who doesn’t think the US markets could drop 32% in a month is just drinking the central bank kool-aid. Our markets plunged 55% from their 2008 highs in a matter of months. And the majority of the losses occurred on 10 trading days. Think about that for a second.  The Chinese stock market went parabolic in 2006, soaring 500% by 2007. Wall Street shysters were hyping Chinese stocks like there was no tomorrow. Guess what happened next? That’s right – it lost 70% of its value in a year. Fast forward to late 2014. It happened again. Little old Chinese ladies piled into the market on margin and it soared 250% in a matter of months.  If you think the collapse is over, you don’t understand collapses. Once they start, there is no stopping them – like an avalanche coming down a mountain. The Chine stock market collapse has another 30% to go – at least. If you think this won’t impact the world economy – you are a dolt. While everyone is focused on the backwater 3rd world country of Greece – the 2nd largest economy in the world is crashing. Hold on tight. It’s going to be a bumpy ride."

I wonder if the market is one big casino to some of these investors. Yes, a little racist. But go to the Baccarat table in any casino and you'll see why I ask."
