freelance,3e7oy9,Raipuff,2,Wed Jul 22 16:21:39 2015 UTC,"It's hard to choose a rate because of so many variables.  How big are your clients? What is their budget? Where are you located? What is your skill level? Do you have a portfolio or track record of other work (are you established)? etc. (these questions are shared across basically all industries)  $40/hr does not sounds too high, no. Charging per hour is not always the right way to do it, if you can figure out it takes you an hour per banner, maybe charge $75 per banner without telling them your rate or how long it takes you. Still seems reasonable and gives you more money in your pocket."
freelance,3e7oy9,robonubbins,1 point,Wed Jul 22 16:57:22 2015 UTC,"+1 this.  I cannot stress enough the importance of knowing when and when not to use an hourly rate.  If you have a huge amount of work from a single client, an hourly rate is more than fine.  However, if you're only doing a few banners, take the above advice and charge a flat project fee."
freelance,3e7oy9,webdevborninthe90s,1 point,Wed Jul 22 17:04:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed on those conditions to help determine when to use hourly.  Another thing to remember is your quote is generally a starting point. Some people say yes, others will bicker about the price, timeline, etc. So if you bid $100 per banner and they complain about it being expensive, tell them the best you can do is $80. Some people just like to feel they are 'winning' the transaction and will cave for the slightest discount.  But see how in the example above you went from $45 per banner to $80. Still coming out pretty far ahead."

The main reason being that a mediocre developer is still generally a positive for a company. Plus it is easy to hire a few and see how they perform.  With a designer, the client is totally relying on the the designers creative ideas and direction.  So I think developers have a lot less to sell when looking for clients.  Another factor is that a ton of charlatans are out there selling their web design.  This not only drives a lot of the prices down but creates a lot of weariness in the market for people looking to hire good designers.  Developers have a pretty decent starting price that isn't really pressured yet."

I can think of a designer being hired as a freelancer because ""Look at all he has made, that guy is amazingly creative,"" but I can't imagine a developer being hired that way. Maybe the reason is, a lot of the times design is a one-man job, but development is not.  If you don't mind me asking, how do you sell your development skills? And what skills do you have?"

In terms of selling my skills once someone is interested, I'll describe the apps I made for other people and the kind of scope I have tackled.

I know designers who do big-scale design work as freelancers though."
freelance,3e6h29,kylorhall,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:22:59 2015 UTC,"I've done both, but prefer ui design and my typical deliverable is html/css (and the files that compile into them) rather than PSDs.  I've gone back and forth in the past year trying to figure out the best mix of money and what I enjoy.  I live in San Francisco, so my rates to begin with are fairly high for the market.  Online vs. Local (well more like non-Tech Hub vs. Tech Hub) it's two different stories.  Not sure how much this will apply to anyone who doesn't live in a large tech hub city, but the online examples may be helpful.    Online Development: 95% of the work I've been offered or stumbled across has been people looking for work at ~25% my rate or less.  I'll also refuse to refactor someone's work if it's horrendous, so I honestly gave up on non-local development work.  The only real outliers are super niche APIs, rebuilding something I've built a handful of times, or the client severely underestimates the difficulty.  Online Design: People who want cheap designs are easy to weed out, so you're not wasting time in sales cycles (eg. I won't even talk to someone about designing for a CMS/Ecommerce platform - unless it's custom built).  It's so much easier for people to understand quality vs. cost with design.  There doesn't seem to be as much competition in terms of quality, for me, and if you can pull out consistent high quality custom work, you can make your worth.  Local Development: A lot of people want mid ~ senior level developers with experiences in their stack for temporary employee consultants.  If you have that and can pass a technical interview, you can get hired really without much difficulty and the money is great.  Typically takes some sort of a connection though - eg. a friend who works at a startup that's hiring in engineering (which is most Series A+ startups here).  Local Design: There's a lot more competition and the temporary employee consultant applies far less to designers; designers aren't really plug and play like a developer who's familiar in a stack, but the work is still out there.    Locally the money is more in development for me, but online the money is in design.  I do a wide range of things, but my typical freelance job (local or remote) is ui design + implementation + minor frontend development duties and my typical client is a Seed/Bootstrap <> Series A level startup without an in-house web focused designer."

I feel like, it is much easier to be a junior designer, and get gigs to get better. As a developer though, you always need a lot experience to show to get gigs, and you need gigs to get experience.

I started well over a decade - hobby > freelance (1-2 years) > full-time (1-2 years) > startups (3-4 years) > freelance (1 year).  The few niches I have in development I only really learned in the past 1-2 years at my previous startup - it's just all about taking on a project where you need to learn an API or a Framework that's not used much.  When I restarted Freelancing this past year, I spent more time analyzing the job postings and looking at what people have asked me to do in the past few years than actually working in the first month or so.  Look for patterns and adjust accordingly.  I'm not saying you need to learn GoLang if it seems hot for a month, but if it would take you 2 hours to feel comfortable with D3.js and there's a ton of frontend visualization jobs out there, go for it."

I see this a lot in areas that I work (music/audio). People want to be perceived a certain way and that somehow manifests itself in one way or another.  Same way with fashion or a website, some outside observers are able to look at two things and say, ""These are the same thing. In an industry that shoots for individualism and creativity, why do these people latch on to such similar whatever?""

freelance,3e3d9k,Joneseh,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:56:10 2015 UTC,"While my contract isn't fully lawyer drafted, I spoke with a lawyer about that topic.  Payment does not bind a contract, there has to be some clear indicator saying that the client agrees to entering the contract.  Payment really cannot count as a true indicator.  For example, if you use PayPal and the client knows your PayPal email and they send you the payment.  In no way does that give indication that they read an agreement.  You could have just told them the price and your paypal email.  It's always best to have something physically/digitally signed because if it ever comes to civil court, you're in a much safer position.  If you are taken to civil court and there isn't any form of signed agreement, that can nullify your contract and you're left at the mercy of the judge and your only hope is that you have a damn good lawyer."

If no contract is in place then it's a pretty aggressive move especially considering they've had 6 days to pay you. And yes, it would more than likely damage the relationship.  I'm not sure about the terms of your engagement but expecting payment within 6 days is kind of impractical for most businesses.  That's why they have terms like net15 (i.e. getting paid within 15 days) or net30. It sounds like the terms you're expecting are net0 and most companies don't work that way unless you explicitly ask.  I tend to do net0 for projects where the deliverables are clearly defined and there will be little to no back and forth.  I always lean towards the side of communication and doing everything to maintain the relationship. In this situation if the payment terms weren't explicitly defined in the beginning I'd have an honest conversation with them about when I'd expect to get paid."

freelance,3dv9v6,sooooocurious,35,Sun Jul 19 20:30:08 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I have a successful consulting company (in France) with a mixture of both full-time and freelancers. As a general rule, the freelancers charge more (because of the higher risk) and as a result, they cost us more. In fact, they cost us quite a bit more. The advantage is that when a contract is over, I no longer have to pay them.  I prefer full-time employees because it's a much lower cost, but if I have too many full-time employees and work dries up, I'm in trouble.  If you're not charging a considerably higher fee as a freelancer (I would say double your typical hourly rate), you're making a big mistake."
freelance,3dv9v6,OvidPerl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:02:53 2015 UTC,"Hey, really? Did you take into account all of the expenses? Training, paid sick days, paid vacation, office rent, office equipment, cost of finding and actually signing an employee etc... into your full time employees cost?   Btw this is not an attack on you, I'm really curious about this :)"
freelance,3dv9v6,sasatokic,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:34:25 2015 UTC,"Training is effectively the same for full-time and freelancers. We hire remote workers, so rent and office equipment isn't an issue (though we might consider buying laptops for permanent employees in the future, but this is a relatively minor cost). Finding and signing costs roughly the same.  The only significant differences in your list, thus, is found in sick days and vacation. Those expenses are higher for full-time employees than for freelancers. However,  the lower hourly rate of full-time employees offsets this. However, we also have higher accounting costs and taxes for full-time employees.  In the end, freelancers cost us more, but are lower risk.  Also, and this is a point that is amost never discussed: we don't hire full-time unless we are sure we can work easily with you. We've encountered many freelancers who are, shall we say, difficult. I won't begrudge their wanting to work part time (it raises our costs, but I'm sympathetic to work/life balance). However:   they sometimes refuse to get out of bed before noon won't answer email argue incessantly about minor details when we're trying to get projects done complain bitterly about using tools they're not comfortable with sometimes disappear without warning (and if they're freelance, that's hard to say ""no"" to lest you cross the line between legitimate freelance and employees)   While most of our freelancers are dream employees that just tuck in and get work done, sometimes you wind up with those who are really good at what they do, but nonetheless drive management costs through the roof. Sometimes I'd rather have four competent software developers who just tuck in and get work done rather than four rockstar developers who constantly argue about everything."
freelance,3dv9v6,OvidPerl,5,Wed Jul 22 15:47:03 2015 UTC,"Although the company has the potential to save money, you should look at it from your view point instead. Figure out how much you're worth as an employee. You're freelancer rate needs to be higher than this as hours aren't guaranteed. You also need to consider how much losing benefits are to you. Talk to insurance companies about how much dental/healthcare/etc. are going to be. Add that to your rate. An exact calculator is going to be different for every area and country, I'm not sure something could even estimate. Also consider (at least in my area) that they won't be automatically taking taxes off when they pay you. You're going to have to do some accounting and taxes won't be as easy."
freelance,3dv9v6,Airith,5,Sun Jul 19 20:38:03 2015 UTC,"It's not about saving money on the job when someone engages a freelancer. It's about not taking on an employee. It's about ensuring you get no benefits or employment rights. It's about being able to tap into a ""finished product"" without paying for training and development.  You don't save companies money as a line item ""wages"". You save them money by hitting the ground running, executing a project faster than most employees could, and then by being exceedingly easy to get rid of when the project is over.   If your rates make you ""cheaper"" than an employee... as others have said, you're doing it wrong.   We pay our own benefits, vacations, equipment (hardware and software), office rentals, taxes, etc. You have to charge enough to reflect that or even if your rate looks good to start with - there's a chance that you're earning less than you would at McD's when you take that stuff into account. And last time I checked McD's workers get some benefits, free food and a uniform..."
freelance,3dv9v6,TheGrinchOfSR,3,Mon Jul 20 00:47:26 2015 UTC,"In San Francisco between hiring costs (like 3-6 months average timeline) and all of the extra perks, benefits, taxes, etc., an employee can cost tech startups a 150% - 250% their hourly rate over their lifetime.  It's really not uncommon to be making twice as much hourly as a consultant as the person you're sitting next to.  Oh, and I don't work 60 hours a week.  Typically you'd be a bit senior to your colleagues and wouldn't need as much training time in the tech stack, but still.  Perhaps an extreme case.  Please don't come here though."
freelance,3dv9v6,kylorhall,4,Mon Jul 20 02:53:01 2015 UTC,The general idea is that you need from 50% to 100% as much hourly as a freelancer than as a employee.
freelance,3dv9v6,matts2,2,Sun Jul 19 20:31:33 2015 UTC,"I've had two employers who have wanted me to switch from full time to freelance.  And the rule of thumb was x2 of what they were paying you for a full time salary.  Anything less and you will be making considerably less then if you were working as a salaried employee.  You're not really going to find an accurate calculator because it really depends on the work, state, country, etc.  It isn't simply about health care and taxes, there are all sorts of costs to consider.  Office space, equipment, training, parking, human resources, vacation time, workers comp, etc. etc.  You also need to consider the loss of income that you will experience by not having a full time job and them not offering you work for days, weeks, months.  So overall 2x the costs.  Also remember it is illegal in many states (or the entire US?) for companies to hire full time employees as contractors in many industries.  And generally when a company wants you to go contract instead of full time it screws you over and benefits them."
freelance,3dv9v6,urbn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:58:48 2015 UTC,"The main savings is opportunity cost. They are hiring you, an expert, to do important work NOW. That should cost them more money up front, but as a business that should allow them to earn more money in the longer term. It also means you're gone the second it makes sense to get rid of you.   If they want to hire an employee, that takes time, money, and often requires ramping the employee up. That shouldn't be a problem for you.  And if they want to fire an employee, there's a bit more paperwork involved. It's a more permanent agreement."
freelance,3dv9v6,noodlez,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:20:07 2015 UTC,"Lots. Lots and lots. SO much! Even when they appear to be paying a much higher wage to a contractor than they do to an actual employee the hidden (hidden is a bad word.. as no one is trying to obscure it it's just not what most people think about when they consider their compensation for their job) costs of an actual employee are often as high as 115% of their base salary (in other words someone making $50k costs the company $115 though that's a high water mark).   A contractor?  No training.  No Pension/IRA Matching costs.  No Social Security. No Medicare. No Health Care Benefits (this is huge an employee with a spouse and kids is SO expensive). No other benefits (often companies have other benefits like health club memberships or stock purchase programs just to name a few in a varied field). No educational assistance (companies often do some kind of tuition reimbursement or even pay entirely for classes taken while the employee is actively with the company).  To be a contractor one has to acquire his own training and tools to do the job (to avoid being classified as an employee which is a way a lot of companies have screwed themselves by hiring people, calling them contractors but then training them and providing them with the tools they need to do the job) SO... No Training. No Materials costs (or they are built into the contract). No maintenance on assets and tools required to do the job. Often no office space required (for remote jobs) which can save on small costs like access cards, the time it takes to in-process a new employee into the company system and even saves on any travel or parking related costs.   And that's just off the top of my head. I could go on. For example the cheap and simple accounting of a contract employee also saves them money. There are SO many ways they save the company money.   But there also can be a lot of drawbacks which is why contractors are just as often not the way to go.   But man do they save money. Especially if the contractor doesn't know how cheap they are by comparison."
freelance,3dv9v6,remedialrob,2,Mon Jul 20 01:44:50 2015 UTC,"But isn't this not true if the freelancer is experienced and knows they should be charging at least double that of an employee?  The kind of desirable freelancer you'd pay to give you high quality work instead of trying to scrape by on people who are new to it or inexperienced?  Like, big companies pay for those company-wide benefits plans for a reason.  Those benefits, per employee, are probably cheaper for them than paying double salary.  Big companies also already have accountants and having freelancers complicates what would normally be a more straightforward process.  Also, finding good employees is difficult in general, and even experienced companies tend to hire bad contract employees that end up costing them in many ways more than it should have.  Of course you can hire a bad employee, but a bad contractor will cost you more a lot faster than a bad full-timer, and at least in the US, employees are much easier to fire than it is to break a contract.  I do agree on remote work, tools, training, etc., though.  Then again, the big company I used to work for didn't pay for any of that for their employees, either."
freelance,3dv9v6,moxibytes,2,Mon Jul 20 02:02:29 2015 UTC,"Yes to an extent. But think about all the ancillary costs that go with an employee. Not just the benefits and stuff but the little things. Human resources making sure you're at work on time? Nope he sets his own hours and bills the company.   Mandatory sexual harassment training? Not for this guy he doesn't work on site and therefore doesn't interact with any employees except the project manager over phone and e-mail.   I'm not saying that this is always true. I'm sure there are many instances in which contract employees could potentially cost more than regular employees. Especially with the risks associated with using contractors.   But there are so many little ways in which employees cost an employer money than on the whole I can't imagine that being the norm.   An anecdotal example.  A few years ago I got too old and injured to chase the bad guys anymore so I left my career as an Ex-military guy doing security, body-guarding and PI work to try and transition into an office job. For the first time in my life I went to work in an office. I took over as office manager for a nearly 25 year old Immigration Law Firm.  The lawyer who owned it had her staff of two quit on her at the same time and she needed someone with discipline and organizational skills fast.   I hired new staff, trained them, set S.O.P's and generally got the trains running on time. I knew there were issues with the location so I scouted new offices in the area and moved the entire firm into new construct about an eighth of the mile down the road. Much bigger space, much better parking, a third of the rent.   I negotiated the lease. Then I got to work on other contracts. Renegotiated the copier lease (what a nightmare... but once I was done it was all untangled and working to the firm's benefit though I had to threaten the owner of a multi-million dollar a year company with exposure about a price fixing plea deal he had made with Elliot Spitzer's AG office in New York). Renegotiated the shipping contracts (the lawyer was overpaying enough every year to buy a modest new car).   While I was doing all that I also had almost 400 work permit clients of my own. A work permit based immigration case involves the employer claiming that they cannot find an American to take a job opening they have at or above the prevailing wage. And the Department of Labor makes them prove it. They have to take out ads, conduct interviews and so on.  What the system (and oh how broken the immigration system is) doesn't recognize or deal with is that many of these cases aren't something that is resolved in a short time and that in many (most) cases the alien is already employed by the employer, illegally here in the United States.   So I was talking to one of the employers about pay and so on. The guy is a teacher who runs a masonry company on the side. I get the impression he knows masonry but isn't an expert practitioner. It was actually a clever arrangement. He's the face of the company. Makes the sales calls. Does all the paperwork and estimates and then he had this team of six to eight illegal Mexicans with several lifetimes of masonry experience do the actual work.   So one day we're talking. I had to spend a lot of time hand holding the employer/sponsors as many of them loathed the process but almost universally the employees they had here illegally demanded that the employer try and do something about their immigration status or they would go work for someone else. So I'm talking to this guy and he says to me, ""if you can find me a white boy around here who will do the backbreaking labor that these guys (his Mexican employees) do I will hire him right now no questions asked and I will pay him $25 an hour.""  Now lets think about that for a moment. $25 an hour at just forty hours a week is over fifty thousand dollars a year. This was around 2007 and 50k was a decent living. Even in Connecticut. And even now it's not nothing.   But the more we talked about it the more I could see why your average unskilled, legally in the country citizen wouldn't take the job.   So he says, ""$25 an hour. But... no sick days, no healthcare, no vacation time, no overtime, no holiday pay, no tools, no training, no on the job insurance (he had contractors insurance for the company but if the employees wanted insurance for any on the job injuries it was on them), no unemployment, no workers compensation, no social security, no pension, no profit sharing, no medicare, no transportation or uniform allowance, no food per diem, no ""leave"" (like the family leave act that allows people to leave their job for emergencies or a birth and have their job waiting when they get back), no job security, and absolutely zero tolerance for bullshit. If you're difficult to work with, don't show up, do shitty work, you're gone. And your co-workers will have cousins or uncles eager to take your place within hours.""  And so. You think about that. And not only can you understand why most people wouldn't take a  job like that. But also how much there is to the cost of an actual employee. And added to the cost is the sheer hassle of arranging... all those things!  If a contractor is charging double the rate an employee would pay hourly I bet in most cases the company still saves money. But that savings is the compensation for the risk they take in hiring someone on contract. Because they have far less control over that contract employee and their options for recompense if it goes badly are only as good as the contract. And often the costs outweigh the effort of even pursuing it.   It's my life experience coupled with some anecdotes and so on. And my opinion. I've had a lot of jobs and this where I come to on it. Contractors are cheaper but riskier."

It will have a premium and free account, the premium account being able to allow you to have your own sponsors/ads, and a bunch of other cool features.

freelance,3dq2ys,remedialrob,9,Sat Jul 18 12:25:12 2015 UTC,"I wanted to add something here:   but went on to say that other clients aren't as reliable as her, and that it seems like a late fee is the only way to get people to remember that I'm a worker just like them and that the landlord doesn't care what my clients intentions are, only that I have the money to pay them.   This was a bad response.   You are not a worker just like them; you are a business owner. Your rent being late isn't their problem, and it's a terrible idea to even mention that because:   You lose leverage in business situations when you let the other party know you are in any way dependent — even theoretically — on their relationship, because they are NOT dependent on you. There are lots of freelancers out there. You needing their money to pay your rent on time doesn't motivate them to pay on time, it just says you have no power in this relationship. This doesn't motivate people to pay early, it motivates them to procrastinate. in general, clients are uncomfortable with the idea that they might be a huge part of your long-term income. Whether this is true or not, it's better to simply not discuss it openly.  If you are a hard-ass about fees someone in your client's organization — be it accounting, the COO, the art director, the person CC'd on your email —  is going to note that you are difficult to work with as a vendor. Even in a long-term relationship (I have a few), you can be let go on a whim or it can be something as innocent as ""The CFO is out of town again. Let's try that other freelancer because he's super nice and Marinaisgo was difficult to work with last time this happened.""   I've had to deal with this recently myself, and all I can say is that two watchwords: geniality and poise get you paid faster than any late fee in longterm relationships like this. Positively reinforce, don't punish (if you can)."
freelance,3dq2ys,Solleret,0,Sat Jul 18 18:03:33 2015 UTC,So you didn't end up having a late fee? What did you do instead?   How did it work out with the client that owed you for 6 months?
freelance,3dq2ys,Solleret,3,Sun Jul 19 07:37:54 2015 UTC,"No late fees. I revised my contract for early discounts, but nothing about late fees whatsoever. Shitting away a 7 year relationship over $800 is silly.  Things have been great ever since. I found new advocates inside the company because I'm a pleasure to work with even if they make a mistake, and my work is perceived as top-notch and competitive (e.g. I don't need them for a paycheck). That pays a higher dividend than creating adversaries."
freelance,3dq2ys,robonubbins,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:03:10 2015 UTC,"So what are your early pay discount structures? Is it a percentage?  And be honest, you'r not actually discounting for early payment, right, you're just applying late fees with a different syntax. Which is brilliant, but you're not earning less than before if the client pays on time, right?  Edit: clarification."

freelance,3dq2ys,Mobile_penor,5,Sat Jul 18 12:39:41 2015 UTC,You're technically right but if they're a regular client who pays on time and this is a one time thing (and a mistake at that) then yeah let it slide and don't make a big deal of it. Honestly I would not have even threatened them with it if they're a good client. Not that you're wrong for having that policy but I mean it's better to maintain good interpersonal relationships and all that for a good client.
freelance,3dq2ys,thisdesignup,0,Sat Jul 18 17:36:23 2015 UTC,I think you're right. It's just unfair that I'm also a good paying XYZ and I have to pay late fees to the people I owe when I'm late.

freelance,3dq2ys,adamkru,7,Sat Jul 18 17:40:13 2015 UTC,"If it is in your contract you should really stick up for it. If you want to hold everyone to a standard then you should hold everyone to a standard. Although mistakes do happen and it's good to keep clients happy but late fees aren't only for deadbeats.    I shouldn't have to suffer someone else's mistakes.   No one should but sometimes it happens. Maybe you could save up some money so you don't have to rely on money that is just coming in? There is an idea in budgeting, for freelancers, that it is good to budget at least a month ahead if you are able. Then you aren't worried if some money is late.   Just some thoughts based on what all you said."
freelance,3dq2ys,springer70,4,Sat Jul 18 12:09:53 2015 UTC,"We are budgeted a month ahead currently, and that's awesome. But if everybody made the same mistake, I'd be fucked."
freelance,3dq2ys,I_AM_CANADIAN_AMA,2,Sat Jul 18 17:41:49 2015 UTC,"Great, then you shouldn't feel bad for sticking up for your fee, in most cases. Especially since it seems you have the fee to protect yourself and not because you think clients are going to pay you late. It's just a part of how you do work. Clients should understand."
freelance,3dq2ys,springer70,2,Sat Jul 18 23:18:31 2015 UTC,"Right. Based on the clients logic, they shouldn't have any down payment just because some guy screwed you over.  Everyone carries baggage that eventually gets passed onto others. Deal with it."
freelance,3dq2ys,dh42com,2,Sat Jul 18 14:08:07 2015 UTC,"Net 10 and 8% is pretty harsh?  Is that standard for your industry?  We do Net 30 and 2%.  Usually people pay the original amount when I send an updated invoice with a late fee, so I just drop it.  It's not worth 2%, or even 8% - if they don't come back."
freelance,3dq2ys,dh42com,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:16:53 2015 UTC,"I had 3% but people treated it like a fee, and would just pay it. I want it to be a deterrent."
freelance,3dq2ys,dh42com,2,Tue Jul 21 06:23:58 2015 UTC,"I've been on both sides of the coin, in my career.  I'm currently a freelancer, invoicing for my time/effort, and I've worked in large companies hiring freelancers.    I can say -- without hesitation -- late fees are a bluff.  When I worked in a large corporation, we never (never ever) paid a late fee, nor any interest charges on past due invoices.  We even had insolvency issues (chapter 11) and as a matter of policy would not pay an invoice until it was 90 days late, and then never paid a late fee or interest.  If a customer had a problem, they could take us to court (no one ever did).  As a freelancer, I have dealt with clients that have been good payers, and bad/late payers.  I have a written policy of late fees, but I have never charged one, nor would I ever expect to collect one.  The harsh reality of working for yourself, or owning your own business, or freelancing, is that you need to better understand your cash flow requirements.   Someone much smarter than me told me to keep at least 6 months of monthly expenses in cash to buffer these kinds of problems, and I'm glad I did, because this year, I had a major client cut hours, plus an unexpected (huge) vet bill for my dog, plus a tax bill I should have saved up better for.  It was a huge (massive) hit to my pocketbook, but I had the buffer in cash to account for it.  Now, I'm busy saving trying to get that buffer back.  My long-winded point is.... move on.  Don't fuss over small late fees, because you'll just get resentful and angry over something you have a slim/none chance of collecting."

They all trust me on the competitive/NDA aspect as I never talk about my clients.   Most of the trouble would stem from simple and petty bad blood between my client agencies - they are all competing for the same small group of customers.

freelance,3dmy0g,LoganTheHuge00,6,Fri Jul 17 18:34:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, then you popping up on one of their competitor's websites will likely rankle. I mean, you can always hope and pray that they don't Google search you but I'd either be up front with your other clients that you work with other PR firms (even in a casual, passing way - it's always better to be honest anyway) or let the one-man PR show know that you're not able to accommodate this request because you work with others and it'd be a conflict. It's kind of weird that he'd want to put you on his website. Is he just trying to pretend that he's not a one-man PR show?"
freelance,3dmy0g,TheGrinchOfSR,3,Fri Jul 17 20:41:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly? Don't ask, don't tell is not in the remotest bit ethical. If you sign a client that competes with another... you have to talk to the original client and let them make a decision to stay or you have to let them go.   I agree that your clients are going to be pissed if they find you work for their competitors. Because you haven't told them. Logan's advice is good... time to let them know. Until then, keep your face off their websites."

freelance,3dmoui,redkrypt,4,Fri Jul 17 14:52:43 2015 UTC,"I think that getting business is ultimately down to how you present yourself, such as:  1) Do you have a website? A website for a freelancer is an absolute must. Take the opportunity to show off your work with a snazzy portfolio and maybe even blog about your industry.  2) Do you have a portfolio? Even if you don't have a website, your portfolio is absolutely crucial. Sites such as LinkedIn are an inexpensive and easy portfolio platform.  Those are just a couple of things to consider. There are really a lot of freelancers in the video production industry (not as much as others, but enough) so try and focus on making yourself stand out from the crowd. If you have other skills you think they might find useful, list them.   This post by Karen Marsten is genius, and might help you out. It's titled '15 Tip-Offs that You’re New to Freelance Writing.' Despite being centred on writing, all of the points are easily transferred to freelancing in general. A common reason why people aren't hired is because it's blatantly obvious that you're new to the job, so it's worth reading.   The average, which seemed to apply to me too, that most freelancers throw around is that it takes around 3 months to start getting proper work. I got my first job a week into the game, but I got my first proper job about 4 months in.   Good luck!"

For an agency, you agree terms with the freelancer and then pimp them to the client. You get paid and then pay the freelancer. You write a letter on behalf of the agency to promote them and include their details - you also allow direct contact between client and freelancer because they're on the books.  If you're going to be a farmer. You write letters on behalf of the agency only. You unethically mislead the client into believing that someone with skills will do the work. As soon as work is awarded - you put it back out to tender on another platform for as little as you think you can get away with. You then edit the work when it's received before sending it to the client and pretending it's your own."

The two ways I've seen people successfully position themselves around a technology are either through Open Source or Teaching.  If writing code all day is your thing then find an open source project around the technology you want to work with a contribute there. After enough contributions (e.g. answering/closing issues, providing documentation, Pull Requests, etc) you'll have positioned yourself as an expert with that technology stack AND built up a network with the maintainers of that stack. These are the people you want to ask for referrals and potential leads on clients.  If writing and teaching the things you've learned is your thing then start a blog about the technology you want to work with. One of the really good recent examples I've seen this done with is Justin Weiss. In fact he even has an article on Getting into Open Source."

freelance,3djkht,SansaStarkers,2,Thu Jul 16 20:04:13 2015 UTC,In my experience it's been all over the place.  If they're an agency that's just concerned about filling a slot the interview may only be concerned on how reliable you are.  If they're an agency that's concerned with their reputation and their client's happiness the interview could be much more involved.  You also have to be concerned if this agency is the right fit for you. This means you have to come prepared with set of questions that you can use to decide whether they're the best fit for you or not.  The last thing I'll say is if it doesn't work out try not to take it too personally. This happened to me with one agency and I took it hard. Looking back though it just wasn't a good fit.
freelance,3djkht,ryan_castillo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:07:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your experience. I'm preparing to talk about my skills and go through my portfolio, but drawing a bit of a blank on what kind of questions I should ask them...  From what I understand they'll be putting me in their 'book' and setting me up with relevant work/clients when they come in. They've said that the interview will be about 45 minutes long, so I guess that's a good sign?   Thanks again for your reply!"
freelance,3djkht,gzine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:50:14 2015 UTC,My experiences with agencies are that they take you at your word for what you state you can do.  They get feedback from the interviewers that they set you up with.  They get paid to find you work so just be honest about what you are looking for and think you can do.
freelance,3djkht,adamkru,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"That's reassuring. I get super nervous about interviews and I'd much prefer to let my work do the talking, so hopefully I shouldn't have to go too in depth with the ""tell me a time when..."" type of questions.   Thanks for your reply."
freelance,3diybd,manicleek,3,Thu Jul 16 17:24:40 2015 UTC,"That's something you need to talk to the recruitment agency about as whatever we see as normal doesn't mean it'll be right in this case. You should be making it clear to them that you're VAT registered when you're discussing rates.   Personally, I'd expect to add VAT on top of the day rate."
freelance,3diybd,tenpastmidnight,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:15:29 2015 UTC,"You only charge VAT if you are VAT registered. It is illegal to charge VAT if you aren't registered and also if you don't when you are (unless the customer is also VAT registered, but that gets a bit more complicated.  Whether the agency charges their clients VAT is down to whether they're registered."
freelance,3diybd,Cueball61,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:22:28 2015 UTC,"To expand on this: you have to be VAT registered if you turn over more than £80k in a given year (every twelve months, not a financial year), but you can register yourself even if you don't necessarily need to.   OP, you'd probably be best off speaking to your accountant."
freelance,3diybd,joemckie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:44:48 2015 UTC,"And to expand on the expansion, you can be fully VAT registered (pay 20% forward, claim back VAT on expenses, etc) or go on a flat rate scheme where you can't claim VAT back on purchases (except certain £2k+ assets) but you charge VAT to your customers and keep a percentage of the VAT and pay the rest forward to HMRC.  Yay accounting!"
freelance,3diybd,Cueball61,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:48:26 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah my accountant suggested the flat-rate scheme to me. VAT registering is a tricky one, really, as it entirely depends on the kind of customer you're working with. If you're working with startups then an extra 20% on your daily rate could be the difference between getting a project or not."
freelance,3diybd,joemckie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:52:45 2015 UTC,"Whether you go flat rate would also depend on your expenses, if you buy lots of stuff with VAT then flat rate probably isn't for you."

freelance,3di4d2,triplehardvark,2,Thu Jul 16 14:27:57 2015 UTC,"I use Stripe. If the fees are too high, bump your rates by 3%.   The ease of using it (especially the by-default integration with most tools) made it 100% worth the cost for me. Before I was using a traditional payment processor with high fees and shittier all-around experience.  An alternative option is FreshBooks, who recently launched in-app credit card processing. Fees are similar to Stripe, I believe. Added benefit of tracking things for the accountant."
freelance,3di4d2,jlengstorf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:14:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for your reply. I guess I'll end up using Stripe if I don't find an easier solution. It's mind boggling that these things are still a PITA. I might end up coding up something like Danielle and send my clients there. Not a big deal to prefill the amount and currency via URL parameters.   http://domain.com/payme/60000/usd/
freelance,3di4d2,jlengstorf,2,Thu Jul 16 17:25:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's one of those situations where it's worth paying to relieve the hassle. Stripe's API is beautiful, so I doubt there's an easier (free) solution out there.   Personally, I choose to solve these problems with money rather than time. A few bucks a month for something to handle invoicing, reminders, reports, and so on is very much worth the hours it saves each month (week).   If you do roll your own, I'd love to check it out. One geek to another. :)"
freelance,3di4d2,jlengstorf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"I have the same mindset. It has limits though. One of those would be where a company charges you ridiculous 10% to transfer money. This is not a problem my clients or I should pay up for. Other than that, yeah, it's easier to make more money than save a few bucks here and there."
freelance,3di4d2,FriendlyWebGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:47:11 2015 UTC,"Jesus, who's charging 10%?  I run through FreshBooks with Stripe hooked up. Two days to transfer the money in my account, $25/month for FreshBooks (I've since had to upgrade to the more expensive plan, but not until I had a shitload of clients), and Stripe's per-transaction fees.   I think most invoicing apps have similar fees (Harvest et al.). Even if the invoicing doesn't help you, the price may be right just to avoid hassles.   Good luck!"
freelance,3di4d2,FriendlyWebGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:07:13 2015 UTC,Waveapps.com handles all the Stripe details for you. At no extra cost. Plus it includes invoicing and accounting.

freelance,3di4d2,Cueball61,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:42:33 2015 UTC,"Invoicing allows you to use any currency (though there are some caveats). Besides, you don't need to use neither invoicing nor the accounting features if you don't want."

freelance,3dhbib,iamsmat,2,Thu Jul 16 07:22:15 2015 UTC,You can't. What you can do is build your own website(s). You can talk to a local charity or two and upgrade theirs. So that when you leave uni - you have a portfolio to show for it.   Everyone has to get experience before they can get freelance work. It's much easier to get a job with a touch of experience (like the method above) and then after a couple of years of real work... you'll be ready-ish to be a freelancer.
freelance,3dhbib,TheGrinchOfSR,3,Thu Jul 16 10:07:48 2015 UTC,"I second this other comment. Start local. Build your own website and work on building it and adding work you've done as a portfolio. The best way to do this is look online for local shops/non-profits that could use a website upgrade. Plan on working for free for the jobs you seek out. Think of it as finding projects you would like to do. Gifts from your clients, so to speak. They win because they get a new website... You win because you get to show off on your portfolio and most of all, you get exposure every time people visit these sites.   On every site you do, leave a ""site by ______"" with your website. Make sure the clients know that you would love for them to spread the word about you if somebody asks about the site. Word of mouth is infinitely more powerful than any freelance site. Do this in your free time, and put every ounce of talent you can into these.  Do this continually. I have been doing graphic design and videography for over five years and still seek out projects I can do for free. I see something I know I can make better and it's a privilege to work on it and add it to my portfolio... Because in essence you get ""advertising"" for free. Exposure. This exposure and the word of mouth will pay off way more in the long run than a paid site that people have no clue who did it.   For example, I started seeking out work in the area (like I said around five years ago). I did a logo for a local non profit for free. Somebody else asked who did it. We started talking and I offered them a website (www.prayformecampaign.com). That website alone has brought me more people through word of mouth than I ever found on freelance sites.   Lots of free design/video work later, I'm now full time freelance over the summer supporting my wife and myself with a backlog of projects and bookings into the winter. Last week I did a massive project for free, this week I did a small project for $2500. Now, I'm not incredible at design or some big name... Or really anything at all... But people trust other people. And when they hear from a friend that I redid their website or did their logos, they are very likely going to ask me first to do work for them. It's good experience and almost stress free (as opposed to a big paycheck with heavy deadlines and the feeling you have to impress somebody). You want the big projects coming to you... Not you begging them through bids.   The biggest thing to remember as a freelancer is that you want exponential growth of you want to provide for yourself in this work. Websites (like freelancer.com) take away about 90% of that growth. Growth comes mostly from word of mouth."
freelance,3dhbib,Natexgloves,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:38:56 2015 UTC,"This is a great way to go. I started out much the same (built a site for a friend, then a local karate school, then event planners, etc.) and saw great long-term success as a result.   One caveat: try to help companies and/or people that are active in the community. You're doing work for a portfolio, but more importantly you're building a referral network.  If you help someone who's really active in their community, they'll spread the word on your behalf. That's worth its weight in gold.   Good luck!"
freelance,3dhbib,jlengstorf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:23:13 2015 UTC,Exactly. There is a lot of terrible design work out there seen by people on a regular basis on active websites. Getting the opportunity to replace these things with your own work will help you in the long term.

freelance,3d8o9l,imbrizzle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:52:13 2015 UTC,Exactly.
freelance,3d8o9l,TheGrinchOfSR,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:59:40 2015 UTC,They can even take money from your credit card without notifying you.
freelance,3d8o9l,imbrizzle,-3,Tue Jul 14 21:00:50 2015 UTC,You were notified when you agreed to the Terms of Service when you created an account. You're being silly.
freelance,3d8o9l,CrusssDaddy,2,Wed Jul 15 02:19:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed, technically, although it's pretty shitty terms of service that they can take money from you in 3 seconds without identity verification, but also get to hold money indefinitely without you having to jump through massive hoops (specifically OP situation - non-US-based workers).    They rely on the fact that most people don't read TOS carefully (or, necessarily, even have a full comprehension of the legal ramifications of everything that might be presented in a non-native tongue).  They (freelancer) could, perhaps, not allow non-US-based workers to take on projects until payment paperwork and identity is verified, but... then they wouldn't have tens of thousands of workers working for relative peanuts that they can then hold on to indefinitely claiming that they can't verify identity (but they'll gladly take money on their behalf and get them to pay to do work for free).  OP, if I wasn't clear before, stop using freelancer.com.  I hope you've got some good alternatives from this thread."
freelance,3d8o9l,sofuj,2,Wed Jul 15 02:58:49 2015 UTC,"shitty terms of service   Which is why when you read the terms of service you have the option not to continue. OP's English is good enough to bitch on reddit, but not to read ToS? I know on reddit we are anti-corporations, but there's a difference between being exploited and signing up for an account on a money-making website and not expecting them to get their percentage.  EDIT: To make a point, yes, Freelancer requires verification, which may be difficult for people living in certain places, but once that is done, you never have to deal with it again."
freelance,3d8o9l,faxseedoil,2,Wed Jul 15 03:36:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not at all anti-corporation.  I'm anti-crappy practices.    I keep coming back to this - if they understand they need verification, they should do that before allowing someone to do work for them.  Otherwise - especially with non-US folks -  they're knowingly taking money from customers for work that's getting done understanding full well that the person doing the work may have a hard time getting paid.    Right now, freelancer is sitting on $275 collected between both parties, and knew before it started that OP was outside the US, and hadn't had their identity verified to be able to collect final payment.  What if they don't ever feel like accepting the identity paperwork from workers like the OP?  Even just a few hundred cases like these per year ends up being fairly serious money, especially for non-US workers.  Even in the medium term, it's a bad experience for end client who hired OP.  OP will likely not come back, the end client who hired OP won't be able to use OP again via freelancer, and they'll need to go through the 'find a new freelancer' dance.  Blame OP all we want - yay! - but freelancer deserves criticism.  Being able to take money from someone in 5 seconds but not release earned money because of identity verification is a poor experience.    Any other business that did this - engaged a worker of unverified status to do work, collected money from customers based on the work performed, then refused to pay - would be rightly called out.  Most jobs that aren't ""cash under the table"" require identity verification/tax forms to be filled out before work starts.  Yes, this isn't a 'job' in one sense, but they're hiding behind these regulations.  Lastly... ugh - I've engaged non-US workers across the border.  Paid them thousands.  I didn't need identity paperwork on those folks.  I simply recorded them as an expense and indicated in my records who they were.  Should an audit come about, I have the paperwork showing what work they did, how much I paid, etc. which support my deductions (verified with CPA).  Would I make that a full time business operation without stronger record keeping?  Probably not, but it's their responsibility to report income to their government.  Unless freelancer is reporting income to the OP's home country, it's not their responsibility to verify all this (sure, they'd like to have records, but they already have some basis of records and identity good enough to charge OP).  And... US reporting only requires filling out this paperwork for total payments over $600. We don't know if OP hit this threshold, only that he's owed $250.    TLDR - Yes - OP should have read and understood the terms of service more clearly.  FL should also have a process in place to prevent people from doing work before their paperwork requirements are fulfilled."

The time for them to get it, if they needed it, was when they had you fill out a W9.   It's up to them to file, and they're allowed to file using a tax ID instead.   Shady people I worked for wanted my SSN retroactively and I did not trust them with it. I looked this up and found out I did not have to give it to them. They bothered me a lot about it and made up stuff, but they were full of it."

freelance,3da2hj,Cosmonaut86,2,Tue Jul 14 19:42:07 2015 UTC,"They have to do a little digging I think (really a little google searching will reveal what they have to do for you.) The bottom line is that you don't have to provide it.   In the case of my previous employers, there was no way I'd trust them with that."
freelance,3da2hj,iMatthew,3,Tue Jul 14 19:54:07 2015 UTC,"If they haven't filed a 1099-MISC for fees paid for your services in 2013, and they're going to do so now, you might want to take a look at your 2013 state and federal returns just to make sure you reported their payments to you as business income. If you forgot, or ""forgot,"" to do so because you didn't get a 1099-MISC from them by the end of January 2014, you might want to pro-actively file amended returns for 2013 with the additional amounts owed. Might partially save you from penalties for under-reporting once the IRS and your state franchise tax board receive documentation of fees your client paid out to you. Pay no attention to me, I'm not a CPA or tax attorney or anything."

Do not enter the disregarded entity’s EIN. If the LLC is classified as a corporation or partnership, enter the entity’s EIN."" Maybe that helps!"

I also don't like paying the commission rates, so I give as much priority I can to work that comes in through other means. Referrals are my largest source of new work, and I like it that way.  However, this is a direct quote from a recent Elance email blast from July 8:   We’re also happy to announce that when you work on Upwork with clients you already worked with on Elance, we’ll honor the same fee as before.

They then created a fake ripoff report accusing my wife of some terrible things that are 100% lies but the administrator of the site www.ripoffreport.com told me I would have to pay that amount of money you described, in order to dispute the report.  Of course I did not pay it and it's been years since that happened.  It's still there and ranking very high in search engines (mainly Google).  News has spread about this site and I know shady SEO people who use it to attack people who do payup for their requests.    What's really weird though is that lady years later tried to add me on LinkedIn.  She said that she wasn't the woman I dealt with, that she had died and that others use her email (the email that was associated with the freelancer.com account).  I just scratched it off as this lady is a sociopath and I should just severe any communication with her before things got worse.  I've got some really good clients over the years and in very high-ranking positions who have told me that they could distinguish real from fake just by reading the report so that made me feel a little better.  It still doesn't erase the libel, slander and deformation of character from the web.

freelance,3d6w83,lamblackkk,3,Tue Jul 14 00:08:28 2015 UTC,"Depends. If he's using PayPal then you can request for him adding you as user to the business account (business accounts can have multiple logins with limited access on each account). If he's using a 3rd party service to sell them, you can request that they send you a monthly sales report.  For the most part though, unless you have some 3rd party arbitrator you have no way of verifying if he's screwing you or not short of randomly buying a bunch of shirts and seeing if the commission he's paying you is accurate.   Normally I don't do anything but flat-rate projects unless the customer has reputation to lose. If this fella is pretty big name with a bunch of designers doing commissions for him, the rep loss of someone accusing him of cheating designers tends to outweight whatever they'll save from actually ripping you off."

Go look at Elance or UpWork and see Americans and Brits working for the equivalent of $1/hour (which is nothing in my book).

You can charge real money on brokerage platforms as much as you can in the real world. I have clients paying 50 cents plus a word there.  The keys are:   Specialize - develop a niche (whether you are a designer, programmer, writer or whatever) - nobody is going to pay a generalist any real money when they compete with millions of generalists on the same platform Develop a portfolio to reflect that specialization Learn to write bids which show the value you add to the process and the problems that you solve for your clients Learn to ask for a sensible fee, and learn not to haggle over it (wish clients luck finding someone else as awesome as you for tiny amounts when they try to haggle). Write good contracts.    Good luck."

So far, I just send examples of what I've written (I'm a journalist). Is there a better way to do this?  Lastly, I have a price in mind that should work with my expenses and needs.

I've tried going client side and the vast majority of freelancers send proposals along the lines of:  ""Here are some samples. Your project will cost $XXX."" and nothing more.  You want to develop a portfolio that tells a story, show how your work adds value to the bottom line (case studies are good), present your career history (why should you get paid decent money?) and show how you'll approach not just the work but the relationship (contracts, Skype calls, etc.).   When I started I looked at all the advice out there and concluded most of it was junk written by people getting started rather than having succeeded. So I put my marketing hat on and thought about what would help me make decisions when contracting out work... that's the best way to approach it."

Where do you envision this product and your business in one year?   Now these questions may seem boilerplate but they're not. They're very specific to helping me fish out my ideal client.   If your budget doesn't meet the minimum it costs to work with me, you're out. If you expect me to work in your office every day, you're out. If you're project isn't concretely defined and you're not willing to spend a week on R&D to flesh out the details, you're out. If you have no idea on whether you'll still be around in a year, you're out.   This interaction with a lead sounded like a complete waste of time for you and that sucks.

I quoted him about 2 hours worth of work depending on the complexity of the design, revisions and a few other details.

freelance,3d08r7,BTM23,7,Sun Jul 12 23:23:56 2015 UTC,Millennials tend to be the ones who actually value freelancers because they're more familiar with the lifestyle and the career choice.

I've seen a drastic shift in the attitudes and mindsets of people looking for freelance services. And while I gotta deal with some old crankshaft trying to pull the old ""Well I can get it done offshore for about a third of the price"" when I quote a website gig, it's the other stuff in my life (art & music) that I see the aforementioned apathy towards paying someone for their efforts.   I have worked in clubs owned by younger folks (twenties/thirties) and they feel that because they provide a place to play that recompense for the band is purely optional. I've also worked in clubs owned by older folks who want you to ""sell tickets"" (ergo pay to play) and that's not right either.   And that tends to come from the mentality that many, if not most millennials feel that music ""should be free"", as well as photos, movies, code, etc. Why do I know this? Because it was my generation that, as young parents we were completely GAGA over the fact that all the music/movies/software we loved was all of a sudden available for gratis, and we set poor examples for our kids.  Thing is, I can remember back before all this internet shit started and how life was. I was 25 or so when it all started coming into play and how much it changed the landscape of this business.  But not to worry, I'm either too stupid or too hard headed to quit this business of freelance and I'll be here long after many have given up and moved on.

Not even because it will pay the claim, but because they will defend your dumb ass for anything that could possibly fall within the policy limits.  At their own expense.  One of the more important questions to ask your broker (and make sure they are competent - get references): ""Is defense inside or outside the policy limits?""  Inside policy limits means that every dollar of defense costs eats away at the policy limit, leaving less to pay or settle the claim.  Outside means defense costs are unlimited so long as the carrier feels it's worth defending instead of paying.  You want outside if at all possible, though it may be difficult to find in some industries.    E&O is a thing.  You will make an error or omission at some point.  Clients may be annoyed, or they may sue you for that E or O.  That plus general liability plus a small workers comp policy (some clients will want to see it, or their own carrier will want to see it) should run you a couple hundred bucks a year in the beginning, because you're small.  As the business scales, so likely will the premiums, but at that point you can afford it.

She then tried to convince me to do 17 full color illustrations for 500 dollars because it'd be good for my career.   I told her I'd do some sketches with what I am thinking and we'll figure it out from there.   Two days later she's furious that I haven't started on the project and she is going to take her business elsewhere and I have fucked up royally and I might as well not even bother being an illustrator.   Those two days was New Years Eve and New Years day.   I should I have bailed and bailed hard when she wouldn't believe that I do illustrators specifically like she wanted."

I can't draw to save my life and 17 full color illusrations for five bills is ridiculous.  No idea what the going rate is, but that ain't it.  I run a business, I am responsive to clients, and I set autoresponders where appropriate.  Anyone who didn't tell me two two weeks ago that they expect me to work new years or new years eve gets a polite laugh and then ""Sweetheart, I'm a contractor, that's now how this works.  That's not how any of this works.""  speech.  I'll happily work on holidays (July 4? I'm done before the fireworks start and I set off my own anyway), but the contract says triple time for those days if I'm obligated to deal with something.  That tends to dissuade people from interrupting my family time,  Unless you're trading stocks or have and MD/DO, your holiday issue is just not that damned important.  Nothing is truly brokeb, you just can't log in.  System says it's still taking orders.  Database and payment processor both verify that.  All your stuff is working withing the specifications of stuff.  Call me on Monday, when I care.   All that, in a contract.  By the way, your $Clien was a douchebag.  Good job on bailing quickly."

That sounds like it'll be a lifesaver. I get the feeling that if the client thinks they can steam roll you they will.   But yeah, I'm a huge believer of not working yourself ragged.

freelance,3cyrtw,Cueball61,6,Sun Jul 12 00:24:20 2015 UTC,"I'll take a stab at this, although I've been drinking, so be forewarned. Also, I'm a freelance writer, so I'm coming at it from that perspective. I also don't have any experience hiring on freelance job sites like Elance.  I guess some of my own preliminary ideas might include:   Stop allowing any jobs that don't offer Escrow Protection. At least on Elance, there are ""hourly jobs"" that do not offer the same protections as fixed price jobs. Why even bother with hourly work? I suppose that, as a writer, I might be biased. My job is one where it's easy to charge per individual piece of work. However, I suppose it's conceivable that some other jobs, like data entry, bookkeeping, and other lines of freelance work I'm not familiar with, might make more sense hourly. With that said, though, I don't think there should be work on a bidding site that isn't protected by an escrow system.  Require clients to give more information about themselves, their business or company, etc. I got burned by a client on a full-time hourly job, working 12-hour days for three weeks before they disappeared forever. Fake name, fake Skype profile, fake location, fake everything. In my naivete, I never thought to ask who the fuck they were, what company they worked for, and other details I feel like I should have had. I feel like Elance clients can seem awfully ""anonymous."" Personally, I like to know who I'm working for. Are you another individual freelancer or one-man LLC, taking on extra work and subcontracting it? Are you a small digital marketing company? A professional like a doctor or lawyer with your own practice and website? There are great clients on Elance, but there are also some who are shady. I'm a huge advocate of online pseudo-anonymity, but this is business, so honesty and ""real name policies"" might be appropriate here. Some sort of mild penalties for clients who post without hiring. As many of us have probably noticed, a huge percentage of Elance postings never hire anyone. Now, in some cases, this is probably understandable. There are probably clients who simply can't find someone who has the right skills, experience, and qualifications. If you make a post looking for a ghost blogger, and all your proposals are from people with mediocre writing skills and little experience writing about your industry, then of course you shouldn't be forced to hire anyone. At the same time, though, perhaps there's a middle ground. They could put limits on a client account's ability to post new jobs, if they've posted a certain number of jobs without hiring. Either that, or they could implement an option to close and remove a posting if they don't find anyone. I'm not sure if this exists, but if it does, few clients seem to take advantage of it on Elance. Branding considerations. I think a genuinely superior freelancing site would brand itself in a way that emphasizes quality. When it comes to markets like Upwork and Elance, the emphasis seems to be on finding cheap work. This results in the huge numbers of gigs that pay $1 per article, or expect someone to build an entire website for something like $50. The prevalence of shitty gigs on bidding sites can drive away not only the best talent, but also good clients who are looking for that talent. I think a newer, better freelancing site could position itself, in terms of its marketing and branding, as a place to find quality work, not cheap work in bulk quantities. The goal would be to attract the best freelancers, those with real experience and skill; and along with them, the serious clients who want to hire them. Some form of approval system for freelance workers. This hypothetical site could require applicants to submit a few samples for review. While I don't think that they need super-stringent quality standards-- after all, how well-written do most SEO blog articles really need to be?-- but there needs to be something basic in place. This would filter out a lot of the chaff, leaving clients with fewer useless, unqualified proposals to sift through.   At any rate, I do think that we need something better than the usual mainstays like Elance and Upwork. I do understand that many of the most experienced, qualified, and financially successful freelancers get most of their work through the networking and connections they've built up over the years. However, for those of us who are in earlier stages of our careers, this isn't always tenable. There are ""content mills,"" which are suitable for beginners and casual part-timers, but don't pay enough for full-time working professionals with experience. Elance is great in theory, but on both the client side and the worker side, it arguably has some quality issues.  EDIT: Posted before I was finished. You may be reading an incomplete comment here."
freelance,3cyrtw,photonasty,3,Sun Jul 12 05:36:15 2015 UTC,Umm... Elance's hourly rate system does offer protection akin to escrow. I don't like hourly jobs all that much but I do take them occasionally and have never had any problem getting paid under the WorkView Guarantee.

freelance,3cyrtw,TheGrinchOfSR,5,Tue Jul 14 12:02:38 2015 UTC,"It would need a team that professionally vets the freelancers.

freelance,3cyrtw,TheGrinchOfSR,3,Sun Jul 12 02:13:59 2015 UTC,"I think there are quite a few sites claiming to do this but when I examine the rates they pay... I come to the conclusion that they don't.   I don't think it's possible for a site to guarantee quality but there's a lot of room for improvement. Some of those registered as writers, for example, on UpWork, Elance, etc. are simply illiterate - it shouldn't be difficult to weed out people who can't even meet the basic standards for their profession. The rest is rather more challenging though."
freelance,3cyrtw,thisdesignup,2,Sun Jul 12 02:28:54 2015 UTC,Personally my own freelance site would be the best freelance site. Freelance is my business and I don't want a middle man getting in between my clients and I. If anything I would hire someone that works for me instead of going to a site that also works for themself. Sure a freelance site might mean well but in the end a freelance website can only exist because they make money off of someone. Wouldn't you want someone who is profiting from the experience to work solely for you instead of being a 3rd party that sits in the room with you?

Then I multiply this number by three to cover consultation, revisions, and all the miscellaneous admin work that eats away at your time.  This has worked well for establishing flat project fees.

freelance,3cs26a,Nachotime,5,Fri Jul 10 09:10:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed. See what they say. For all you know their expectation is just to hire you again.  But I can understand your concern. Drafting a vague contract (or worse not having one at all) is a mistake just about every freelancer has made.  If they're not willing to hire you again come to a concrete expectation of what ""done"" looks like. If ""done"" is going to take an unreasonable amount of time and they feel like it should have been included in the original contract you've got two options:   Kindly explain to them that you did a poor job drafting that original contract and offer them a refund. Kindly explain to them that you did a poor job drafting that original contract, but tell them you still have their best interests at heart and will do the work. Just figure out the fastest way to get to ""done"".   Depending on the temperament of the client and their likeliness of future referrals I go with either 1 or 2. But I tend to stick with these two because it shows I'm willing to own up to my mistakes. Which also teaches me the lesson of never making them again.  With 2 you're almost guaranteed a future referral because it shows that you're willing to go above and beyond to take care of them.  As for takeaways for the future I'd suggest the following:   In addition to a Contract also define a Statement of Work. That way your deliverables are clearly defined. If something can't clearly be defined (e.g. research) put that under a deliverable as number of working hours and deliver a written report at the end. Don't work on your clients terms. Work on yours. Sure they should have responded on ""Monday"" like they said but you left the door open by assuming the contract was fulfilled. Here's another r/freelance thread on Getting a response from my unresponsive client.   Hope that helps!"

As the title and the author suggested there are a lot of things about being a solopreneur that can hurt your personal life. A big one is not having a clear line between your personal and professional life.  One thing that I hear a lot of freelancers say is that they're surprised that they've dropped one boss for multiple bosses i.e. clients. The reality is that they've dropped one boss for the worst boss they've ever had: themselves.  Your clients aren't making you pick up the phone to check emails when you're out for dinner, you are. Your clients aren't making you work over 40 hours a week. You're making that decision.  And the argument against this is always but if I don't work this way I won't get paid. Sure you might not get paid from the clients that expect you to work this way. But who created these expectations in the first place? Or who chose to work with these clients?  The happiest Uber drivers I've met are the ones who have chosen to work around their life. Notice the distinction. They're working around their life NOT living around their work.  They may be in school or have kids and Uber is perfect for them because it lets them pick and choose when they want to work.  When I started freelancing I was married, had an infant, and a second son on the way. More than anything I never wanted them to feel like they came second. I made that one of my personal rules and built my business around that.  You can do the same."

Sure they're good for getting leads but as you've asked what happens if they merge with someone else? or worst what happens if they shutdown?  The two biggest lessons I learned early on as a freelancer are   It's better to have multiple sources for revenue. This way if one source fails you'll at least have backups. It's up to YOU to decide the clients you want to take on. With a site like Elance you're delegating this responsibility of finding clients so you've already limited your potential clients. And I get it, finding clients can be tough work but at some point you've got to take responsibility for your business and do the work.   Which leads us to the age old question: HOW DO I FIND CLIENTS?  Fortunately r/freelance already has a lot of great answers to this question:   I've tried everything, how do I find clients? How I went from zero work to full-time work as a freelance writer A comment on finding side gigs with an email template How do you promote yourself?   Outside of reddit there are also a lot of great resources. Here are my favorites:   Can’t find any projects? Have you tried these these ideas yet? Deleted my portfolio, made $30k in my first six months… The Complete Guide to Finding and Selling Ecommerce Clients How Freelancers Can Kickstart Their Audience Ask HN: How do I get my first client How to Get New Clients with Facebook Ads How to start a freelancing business that won't fail   Now before you go and consume all these links I've got one final piece of advice for you: play to your strengths.  Since you're coming from Elance maybe cold emailing potential clients isn't something you're completely comfortable with. That's OK. Find a strategy for finding new clients and stick with that for a little bit.  For me I was comfortable with building relationships so I started out with contacting my existing network. Then expanded to making more connections and eventually partnering up with several agencies to subcontract through. Now in addition to all that I've built up a mailing list. But I didn't skip steps. I focused on one thing at a time.  Doing it this way, you'll have multiple backup plans.  Hope that helps!"

freelance,3clgzm,ryan_castillo,5,Fri Jul 10 09:43:29 2015 UTC,"There are lots of ways to get client work outside of these sites. And work that pays way higher with no competition.  My tips would be to specialize in something, and start using your social networks to find people having problems that you can solve with your freelance specialty.  Ex. if you are a web designer, join some Facebook groups about business. You will not have a lack of potential customers as most of these people do not have a clue about setting up websites or most importantly do not want to! Same goes for LinkedIn groups.  Don't be a spammer in these groups, just comment on posts where people are asking for help, and most likely they will message you privately for help.  Once you start getting people results they will refer more work to you too.   Once you have some extra cash on hand I'd suggest running some Facebook ads. You can generate leads for less then $10 a day. Send them to a free report or video about what you do, and ask them to contact you at the end of the report or video to get help with that issue.  I stopped using elance, odesk (upwork) and other sites like that years ago, and make well over six figures doing exactly what I mentioned above.  Just my two cents, hope it helps. :)"

freelance,3clgzm,robonubbins,5,Thu Jul 9 03:47:54 2015 UTC,I pull in $80+ an hour on Elance. I have seen zero jobs in the same league on UpWork and I really do mean zero.   UpWork is clearly designed to be a platform to push cheap developing nation labour as opposed to Elance which was designed to push outsourcing in general.

I paid them less than $1.00/hr and they easily pulled in over $20/hr for me.  I had them scheduled so I had one person working at all times (covered 24/7).  This was back when it was oDesk.  I gave one of them a $10 ""tip"" and she sent me an essay back saying how thankful she was.  I felt terrible after reading how much $10 was going to do for her."

Nothing remotely decent in 7 pages of searching fixed jobs.  It's extremely revolting and saddening. They should've just shut down oDesk and remodelled Elance (if they felt it so necessary).

freelance,3cnfiq,TheGrinchOfSR,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:26:05 2015 UTC,You need to build a list of paying content users that work in the music/guitar world. Then you need to send a query letter to one of the editors pitching the idea (don't send the article) and a bit of background to give the confidence in your competence.  If you've never written a query letter... you can Google for a guide or just buy one from Amazon. Good luck.

freelance,3cjvvf,at_the_crossroads,14,Wed Jul 8 14:07:47 2015 UTC,"I hear you - online work even feels ""toxic"" to me, having been deep within it for 7 or so years.   A few other options besides ""back"" to a 9-5:   Read ""The E-Myth Revisited"" if you haven't already. It's a bad title, but it's all about how people get burnt out - online or off - through misunderstanding what work is.  Your skills should have gone up immeasurably in 5 years. So you should be in an opportunity to pivot into a much more rewarding freelance field. Eg. a store, forum or site based around a passion.  You might benefit from partnering up with someone who likes the parts you no longer like to do.  Working part time can be an option. Sometimes freelancing is so-so in isolation, but great in comparison to taking orders from others.    etc etc"
freelance,3cjvvf,soggyindo,8,Wed Jul 8 15:39:09 2015 UTC,"I feel you. To be honest this crosses my mind at least once a month. My motivation has more to do with social interaction and letting someone else handle all the things involved with running a business rather than stability.  I haven't gone back to a 9-5 BUT I do know people who have gone. And from conversations with them I've seen the following:   They made a ton more than they did before they went out on their own. They did it a transition to the ""next step"". For the people I've talked to they wanted to progress to products from freelancing. In order to do that they've taken a full time job in order to pay down debt or to build a bigger war chest. Happiness is hit or miss because for some it's a huge burden off their chest but for others there's this feeling of not succeeding. Which is purely psychological IMO but it's the way they feel.   Ultimately it'll come down to some self perspective. I'd suggest thinking about why you went freelance in the first place? Has that perspective changed? If not, going back to full time work may make you unhappy."
freelance,3cjvvf,ryan_castillo,2,Wed Jul 8 19:31:32 2015 UTC,"I have given a lot of thought on this the last few months, the market i freelanced in has changed considerably in the last 5 years, the work which is available now vs the work that was available when i started feels very different, much less satisfying projects for me as a developer.  I've also come to realise i'm not the natural business/networking guy. I done it fine for 4 years but i feel like is a face/mask that takes more and more effort to ware, if that makes sense?  Along with a few other bits have made the last 3-4 months some of the most unhappiest of all my time being freelance."
freelance,3cjvvf,ryan_castillo,3,Fri Jul 10 13:04:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah. So if you're unhappy you've got to figure out the root cause. Sounds like it could be several things:   Unhappy with the kind of work Unhappy with running a freelance business. Especially how it feels fake and unnatural Other   If it's the kind of work you're doing then if you decide to go Full Time you've got to be sure you're working a gig that will make you happy. Otherwise the trend of unhappiness is going to continue.  If not being a ""natural business/networking guy"" is the problem then maybe you should consider other ways to position yourself. Getting leads isn't always about meeting face to face and rubbing elbows. I've seen people get leads through the blog posts they write or running a newsletter.  One of the more successful freelancers I know simply stayed in an IRC channel (then later on a Slack channel) and answered people's questions all day. He built up so much credibility that people were DM'ing him for work. With getting leads you just have to play to your strengths and it sounds like business/networking isn't one of yours. Or at least it doesn't make you happy.  Regarding the other causes of unhappiness sometimes life just runs you over. I've been fairly happy with my freelancing career but the last couple months I've also considered the 9-5. In May we lost a child we were expecting. For a good part of June our entire household got sick. It sucked.  For me personally, getting back on track has just about finding and celebrating little wins. Maybe that's all you need as well."
freelance,3cjvvf,buffalo_x,5,Fri Jul 10 13:21:58 2015 UTC,"No crime going back and forth. I did. Freelancing fluctuates for me. Sometimes, I'm in 100%, sometimes its side work, and sometimes I need a break. Plus working for a company can alleviate the other stresses of freelancing."
freelance,3cjvvf,wombatjuggernaut,3,Wed Jul 8 15:37:06 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you've had a 9-5 before, so you should know better than anyone else which you prefer.   Are you always worrying about the next job because you don't have enough money or because it's in your nature to worry about that insecurity? If it's the former, maybe look into your budgeting and possibly raising rates, if the latter, maybe a 9-5 suits you better. Also consider trying to book clients further out, spend more time marketing during your week and see if clients are flexible on deadlines.  That said, more today than ever a 9-5 doesn't necessarily provide job security."
freelance,3cjvvf,melikeyguppy,2,Wed Jul 8 15:20:11 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, despite what i'm going through, I'd still say freelancing has more job security than a 9-5 due to the multiple  independent sources of monies."

But, I am also relaxed and for the first time since I started freelancing, I'm thinking about what I want rather than the clients.

freelance,3ck1zu,Nannooskeeska,2,Wed Jul 8 14:56:41 2015 UTC,"First, congrats on wanting to get some freelance work!  Side note: Wordpress isn't static it is dynamic (database driven).      I've seen people easily pay 5k+ for Wordpress sites. Don't underestimate the value you're providing to your client. The amount you can get for this work largely depends on your sales ability rather than your skill. 100k people have your skill, a much smaller percentage can sell that skill. Be sure you research any 'premium' plugins or subscriptions that may be required and factor those into your pricing versus it coming out of your pocket. You can do something like the GoDaddy reseller program (https://www.godaddy.com/pro/reseller-program) that allows you to use their infrastructure to sell their services and collect a portion of each sale. You could run all this through your own account and charge a premium for the 'handling' service I am sure. Although, if you wanted to learn more, you could setup and run your own VPS (requires more linux knowledge). Either way, make 100% sure they are not under the impression that this includes any site updates. A good thing to add here is to do monthly backups and charge the customer for that service on top of the hosting. They will need it eventually.  Get a contract!"
freelance,3ck1zu,robonubbins,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:32:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  Haha ok, I didn't realize the difference. Shows how much I know, right?   One thing I don't want to do it over-price, because I've known these people for years, ever since I was a kid, and I don't want them to think I'm trying to capitalize on their ignorance of this kind of thing. If they were people I've never met before, I'd be fine with charging $1000 flat for each site. I guess it's hard for me to judge the value to them too. I will definitely be adding the price of anything I end up using to the final bill. That actually looks really cool, but I'm not a huge fan of GoDaddy. Are there other companies that do something similar? I suppose I could do a VPS but how would I handle any monthly fees? I feel like I have the Linux knowledge for something like that so it's a possibility, I'm in the process of thinking about it now! ;) I've been reading through some stuff on this subreddit and decided that I'm going to create one when I get home from work today.   Thanks for your advice!"

I do free work for organizations that I want to help, so I can see offering a discount because you like these people. I am not sure of any other companies doing it, many would at least have referral programs. Call up your vendor of choice and see what they offer.   2.1 If you wanted to do the VPS route, get something like one of these: https://www.linode.com/pricing and get it all setup to host these sites. You'll only pay $10-20/mo to start, and you can charge each of the sites $25-50/mo for it. Again, you can roll in monthly backups etc.  No problem!"

You have work by the sounds of things. So the time spent trying to win freelance work is simply trying to add icing to the cake.  I started in freelance writing 4 years ago. I have no journalism degree. I have no background in writing for trade, press, etc. and yet I'm now clearing 6 figures as a copy writer. The difference between me and most other would-be writers? I gave it a go.   Sure, you can expect plenty of rejection - it's the nature of the beast but... it's much easier to hire a freelancer for an assignment than to hire a full-time writer too. The risks are smaller and in many cases, you don't even have to talk to the person hiring at all - it's a question of a good proposal and then some good delivery.   Good luck.

I have a client right now that paid me 50% upfront, and I finished the site, but have yet to deliver the code and documentation (technically it's running for them, but they don't have the passwords or know how to edit/update).  They called asking for more time to pay the final 50%, plus some key people were taking summer vacations.  So, the final amount to me is delayed by about a month.  They know they can't pay... I know they can't pay.  But we both know they will pay in about a month.  They are totally OK with me sitting on the final deliverables until they pay.  They understand totally.  If they haven't paid you in 4 weeks, and are still asking for features and enhancements, then there's a real problem that I think you need to address.  There's no need to get mad or pissy with them, simply say that the payment schedule is meant to line up with various project milestones, and we simply can't proceed with further development until payments are made."

My own contract has something that says that the cost may go up if the project scope changes and it is not my fault. So if the client asks for something new or more things have to do be done that were not discussed earlier.   Talk to the client about these items that need to be done and are not listed in the scope.

On my quote I include the following verbiage:  ""This price quote is intended to provide an estimated cost of development for the completion of the [Company] applications based on the contents of the ""TODO.txt"" file provided by [Client] via email communication. Actual cost will be billed based on actual time worked, not to exceed the quoted amount. In the event of specification change an ammended estimate will be provided.""

I never took a full-time job and did fine (made about $30K my first year, and it's gone up every year since).   However, I'm also really comfortable telling other people that I'm worth a lot of money and that they should hire me. I go way out of my way to end up at conferences, in meetings, and at dinner/drinks with the people I want to work with. And I'm persistent about following up (by being helpful, not just asking for work).   When I started, I had very little skill. But I'm a quick study, so I never worried about learning the skills; I just focused on getting sales and then learned how to do whatever I sold.   Taking a traditional job is safer, and — if you're lucky — you'll have mentors who can teach you shortcuts and good habits. But you'll also get no practice selling.   So if you take a full-time job, make sure you start selling on the side. Learning to sell is the hardest part of freelancing by far, and it's the easiest to ignore.   Good luck!"

freelance,3cd1rc,jlengstorf,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:36:12 2015 UTC,"Sure thing!  I started by going to local meetups for people in my industry. I'd present in something (I used to do ""intro to jQuery"" back in the early days on jQuery, for example), and then I'd do my best to be helpful and supportive of the other developers in the community.   This did two things for me:  1) I got better at my job because I had to teach. Teaching something is learning it twice. That's really valuable. For me it's also really rewarding.   2) The developer community saw me as a resource and an authority. At first, this meant I was ""that friendly guy who can help with ________."" Later, I started becoming a resource when a job was seen as too big or complex for the other freelancers in the meetup groups. I started to get occasional referrals this way. It put me on the radar with agencies as well, who always need good developer contacts because most design agencies can't afford to keep full-time dev teams.   After I had clients, I looked at where they got together. My first few clients were fitness professionals (gym owners, personal trainers, etc.). So I'd go to conferences where one of my clients was headed and get introduced: ""This is my web guy, Jason."" This landed me more referrals than I can count.  Later, I would show up for my clients' events: book releases, weddings, etc.. Successful people hang out with successful people, as a rule, so I ended up A) getting grouped into the ""successful person"" category and B) meeting and hanging out with a lot of very successful people across lots of verticals. This got me intros and referrals.   Hopefully that helps. Good luck!"
freelance,3cd1rc,thisdesignup,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:39:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much, I really appreciate your response. If you have more time and do not mind I have a few more questions.    1) I got better at my job because I had to teach. Teaching something is learning it twice. That's really valuable.

It put me on the radar with agencies as well, who always need good developer contacts because most design agencies can't afford to keep full-time dev teams.   I really like hearing this because it has solidified my own want to start up a tutorial series for what I do, which is 3D modeling. I realized the help it could provide since there isn't a great, from no knowledge tutorial series but I didn't think about the effect it may have on the work I get.    I'd present in something (I used to do ""intro to jQuery"" back in the early days on jQuery, for example), and then I'd do my best to be helpful and supportive of the other developers in the community.   Sounds like quiet a jump from going to a meeting and then presenting something at said meeting. Did you already have a reputation at this point? How did you become a presenter?   After I had clients, I looked at where they got together. May I ask where you looked? I've done my fair share of internet searches for meetups, for my own industry and not just clients, and the results aren't the greatest. I would also ask the same about the local meetings   So I'd go to conferences where one of my clients was headed and get introduced: ""This is my web guy, Jason.""   Was it hard to get into those conferences as someone not in that field? Also it seems like your clients then knew you were going. Yea?   Correct me if I am wrong but to make sure I understand it sounds a lot like once you got the jobs you let others do the talking for you while you made sure to show up. Almost like an advanced word of mouth with you reminding clients by being their in person. I mean that in a good way, it sounds like a great tactic. I understand a person has to do the talking and/or selling at some point after but that initial meeting is very important."
freelance,3cd1rc,jlengstorf,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:17:34 2015 UTC,"A tutorial would be a great way to give back and help your career. Definitely go for that!  Presenting is actually really easy: just ask. I presented at my third or fourth meetup after asking the presenter if they needed coverage on any topics. They had mostly back-end devs, and he thought some front-end would be helpful to the group — he mentioned jQuery, and I figured o could handle that.   I had no idea what I was doing, but it was a small group and I figured the worst-case scenario was that I'd embarrass myself in front of 15 nerds. Instead, I helped a couple of them solve some nagging front-end challenges.   For conferences, I went once I already had a client or two in attendance. I think going alone would have put me in a weird situation that could have seemed greasy or salesy (""why is a web guy at this personal training conference?""). By going ""with"" a client, I was able to get introduced to other people, which makes it way less awkward to be there.   ""Advanced word of mouth"" is a great term for it, actually. I really dislike cold calls and selling to strangers; it changes the power dynamic in a way that doesn't work well for me.   I had to find a way to get people to see me as helpful to them before we ever spoke. That's why I teach and show up where my clients are: it makes sure I'm in the radar before I ever pitch someone.   I think of it like this: if I'm at a party and someone sidles up and says, ""I have something really cool to show you. Come with me,"" I'm immediately on my guard. Why was I singled out? What does this person hope to gain from me? Can I trust this situation?  But if I'm at a party and my friend says, ""Hey, this is [NAME], who handled a really big problem for me,"" I'm now thinking of this person in context. The ""can I trust this"" and ""what are they after"" questions are answered. Honestly, if I need this person's help, I'll probably start the conversation myself.   (And getting a client to approach you is the best way to make a sale. Now you're starting out knowing there's a problem to be solved, so you're not pitching anymore; you're just helping.)  So, yes: I try to get my clients talking for me, and I make sure I show up in the places where that talking can lead to new relationships and projects."

Fortunately, I had a good gig that let me hone my skills while providing a living income for years. Of course, the only reason I didn't get a job is because I was a new grad at the nadir of the recession. I have a much smaller network than most of my peers.   Moreover, the author is correct that many if not most unsuccessful freelancers obsess over skills rather than business development.

Second, don't deliver the final copies of ANYTHING to the client until they pay in full.    For your current situation, they paid you and you agreed on the amount. You're probably stuck eating this as you already agreed. Tell them that the new reduced price they want did not include the free updates or hosting.  Tell them the hosting was only free for the first month and that they'd need to pay to continue it after that point. Charge a fuck ton because you already know they are going to be a paid. $50 a month and an hourly rate for any needed updates around $100. If they don't like it, they can go be someone else's headache. If they want you to install this site on someone else's hosting account, charge them for that too.  The legal threat is pretty normal for a scammy customer, don't let it bug you too much unless you're really in the wrong. Send them the source, tell them they have until the end of the month for free hosting, and move on.   They've already proven they don't value your time, so make sure you get everything paid 100% up front with signed invoices that explain the scope of each payment.  Good luck!"

Since they did not paid in full, however, it changes things. I'm not sure how your agreement looked like to the smaller amount (you omitted the details here), but generally it could serve as an excuse. From the details which you have provided, though, I suspect that you agreed just to make the invoiced amount lowered, without removing 2  free items off the invoice.  So, being the freelancer myself, the rules I follow is that I invoice for things I deliver, and if I invoice, and get paid, I treat it as obligation for myself to deliver - or issue full refund. There are always some informal agreements (you simply cant put everything into contract), and I try to deliver on those, too. Yet, if the other party is not delivering on their promises, I feel that it might be fair to do the same.   Being where you are now, I guess I would refund them and let them know that you cannot offer the remaining 2 positions (free updates + hosting). Unless you really need that money so badly.

Never discount for them if you do. Always take a deposit of a minimum 75% from a friend. Be prepared to lose the friend when the job is done. (I spent two years fighting a former friend for more than $20,000 owed - I got it in the end but trust me, you don't want to have to do what I did to get paid... much easier to get them to pay up front).

The environment is relaxed, and the buzz of other people feels nice (side note: when I stay at home, I usually use Coffitivity in the background to get a little bit of that). The issues I have is feeling obligated to buy coffee / food every couple of hours I'm there (bad for wallet and my diet most times), sometimes the place is packed and there's not a whole lot of space, and wifi can be spotty.  Library: When I want to have a place to focus, either with a specific task or brainstorming, I go to the library. It's free, I can be there all day with no issues, and no one will bother you around you. The main drawback is that if I need to make calls, I won't be able to do so inside of the library. Also, this might vary, but the libraries near me are a little older, so the chairs and tables are really uncomfortable and power outlets aren't widely available.  Coworking Space: I like coworking spaces when I have a lot of tasks to work on or incoming deadlines. There's something about being in an office environment that makes me be productive. Also there are things like good wifi, free coffee (and sometimes free beer) and interaction with people in both the same and different spaces than you. But the caveat here is that it's not free nor cheap. Depending on where you are, it's can range from decent to super-expensive. As an example, In Osaka, Japan, there are coworking spaces for ~$90 per month or ~$8 per day, where in San Francisco, I haven't seen any place for less than $600 a month or $30 - $40 per day.  My suggestion is to spend a few days in all of these different spots and see what works best for you. For myself, I didn't think I would enjoy working in a coffee shop because I thought it was too distracting, but after spending a week doing it, I found that it was a great place to work from. Everyone has different desires, so you'll have to find what works for you."

Unless you need the input of others - co-working spaces are a bit of a waste of time and the coffee's worse than in a coffee shop...

Every state is different, so read up on your states requirements for DBAs, business licensing, and self-employment. Some states require you to have a business license, some don't. This part seems complicated, but it's really not once you dig in.  As for taxes, hire an accountant. You'll likely need to pay self-employment tax, in addition to income taxes. Your accountant will guide you through everything you need to keep track of and let you know what they'll need from you to file come tax time. I was leary of the expense myself, but my accountant only charges $250/year to handle everything, and that itself is tax-deductible.

freelance,3c7ikd,dh42com,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:52:37 2015 UTC,I have actually read both these articles before. Thanks for posting them it's always a good refresher.   What I'm starting to notice is that nobody has any insight on where to spend money on advertising. Maybe paid marketing does not work on a small scale anymore.
freelance,3c7ikd,Asks-Qs,3,Sun Jul 5 22:17:34 2015 UTC,"The best advertising you can do is organic SEO. It pays off tenfold to any purchased advertising that you do. But at the same time it takes longer to do as well. It is like telling someone that is hungry to go plant some corn and other vegetables. That does nothing for them being hungry right now.   What you need to do is a good mix of both. Advertising is expensive if you use advertising that works. Mailers, they don't work. They might work for delivering coupons for things you are might going to buy, but not other things. If a company is telling you they are selling you a mailing list of leads for web development clients, just think how many other people have already bought that list and sent to them. Maybe the ones that were going to buy have already bought. Maybe they haven't. Maybe none will reach the person making the decision.   This is why you need another advertising method. But first you have to understand the differences in the methods to see the value. Both claim to be targeted, but they are not. The mailing list, email list, reddit ads, cpm ads, they are not targeted. Google adwords is targeted. What does targeting matter? You can buy cpm ads from a forum or other site, but who are you advertising to? Bots? People looking for something totally different? People that are in your industry and are competition? You really have no clue. That is how the mailing lists work too. You might get names of people that had businesses 3 years ago that now work for other companies. They have no plans of opening another business.   Google adwords is different, it lets you target people searching for what you are offering. You pick the keywords, your ad displays only to people that type them in. So you know 100% that is what they are looking for. Plus you are not charged unless they actually click your ad. Sure, you are casting a more narrow targeted net. But you are casting it to people that might actually pull the trigger. It is not cheap though. We pay between $5-$8 a click.  But we invest a lot of time in organic SEO too. Just this weekend I have been going over a knowledge base for our site. We have invested close to 100 man hours in it so far and in the end will invest about 20 a week for the next year at least. That costs a lot. But at the same time the cost should bring in higher rankings and more work.  See it is not clear, our industry is not clear. Do you want work for right now? Or do you want work forever?   As a side note, Facebook ads, reddit ads, and Twitter ads have proved useless for us. We have found that the people we end up targeting are the people in our industry and not the people wanting our services."

Perhaps all the questions are this bad.  Perhaps it's just this one.  But it's indicative of a level of quality with freelancer, and I doubt the hiring side understands this.  If I had a client project like this, I'd be able to continually ask questions to clarify.  If I couldn't ask questions, I'd drop them as a client.

freelance,3br5he,knittedmitten,2,Wed Jul 1 14:06:57 2015 UTC,"Personally? All I had to do was get established on a freelancing site, make an account and keep applying for only good jobs with good potential clients who pay proper money, skip all the silly jobs looking for 1000 hours of work for $20. Make a website with all of your past and present work on it, include your location and contact details. Location gives you a better niche when it comes to SEO later. If you don't have any work done, make up company names/brands and design for them so you've got a nice portfolio. As I mentioned, ensure the SEO on your site is well done and try and focus on something like your particular country/state/city, I found being a generic 'global' freelancer actually found much fewer clients because generally they're searching things like 'graphic designers in X'. I did no marketing at all, it's literally a case of getting one client at a time, keep going and word of mouth and notoriety follows eventually.

It sets up a strong client relationship and to date... I've always been paid.  For established clients I am willing to increase the risk threshold somewhat - for those with a long track record of paying up - that can now run to $X,000. I've still had no problem getting paid.

What I've found that is best is to build a rapport with the customer over lunch to talk about what they want and what is feasible and reasonable. After that maybe explain your credibility and how you can help and the benefits. Then offer the sale in a top down sales format. Give them your cost starting with the highest you think you can charge and when they object, ask why and offer them a special deal. Say hey man I understand and I think you are really cool I can offer you a deal and offer something lower. And so on until you are at a reasonable price. Do not under sell yourself. How much is your time worth? Will your price hurt you in the future for future jobs? Will it hurt the market for everyone else?   If someone says just do this one for free and I'll pay for future jobs fuck em. No one ever really means that. Business is about getting as much out of the other guy as possible.

There is always somebody with less skills who will do it for less. You don't want clients who are looking for the cheapest worker. These clients will treat you bad and their projects are super boring. You want clients who saw your portfolio and choose specifically you, for your skills and quality of work. These clients have a low chance to run off to the next guy, because they simply don't know anybody they'd be satisfied with or would have to sit through another meeting to decide on somebody else. You give them a high quote and they'll tell you ""ah well, our budget is actually xxxx max."" then you tell them ""Ok, actually I'm not having much work in the queue for next month so I guess I can give you a discount and take that offer."" Bonus: They'll think they got lucky getting a better guy than they could afford and will treat you even better."
freelance,3bn7tr,Cooro,3,Tue Jun 30 22:05:42 2015 UTC,"Are we talking about new clients or current clients? Current clients can be tough to up your rates on. In their mind, they're getting the exact same service but paying more for it. That doesn't sound fair. And if you were willing to work at that rate before at that quality, someone else will too.  Best to explain to your clients that due to an increased work load and having developed more skills and experience, you will be increasing your rates on a future project. They either go for it or they don't. But if it's what you feel you should be earning, it might be better to lose the client than feel under valued. Try just one or two clients at a time and see what the reaction is.  For new clients, don't be afraid to go a little higher to test the waters. You can let them know the rate is negotiable and use their reaction to decide how negotiable. If they just say no way, you know they weren't even in the realm of being able to afford you. If they're hesitant but willing to talk, it means you'll probably have to come down a lot. If they're generally pretty accepting of your rate, you're probably already pretty close.  Once you get an idea of whether or not clients will accept that rate for your work, you don't need to continue saying it's negotiable if you'd rather not."

There's no rule that says if you charge $50 to one client you can't charge $70 to another.   The trick is starting out with one client at a low rate, and then raising your rate later on.   Normal increases are to be expected, but a large jump in your rate will probably not be seen favourably.  If you've taken a job at a low rate to outbid someone else, you might just be stuck there, or you run the risk of pissing them off with a large jump.  If you're OK with the risk (and ok with the potential of loosing a client), then raise your rates... just know they're going to be confused and probably surprised by the rate increase."
freelance,3bn7tr,springer70,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:45:25 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd just keep them at their previous rate, but start to up your price and give them an offsetting discount.   I'd also devise a fair referral deal with them to get an even lower price.  I don't agree with raising your prices on someone else's back (ie, not a new client).  Your rate isn't based on feelings.  It's based on what someone will pay you.  it's one thing to establish yourself in the market and seek a raise because the market reflects your compensation.  It's another thing to think you deserve more, and you raise your price on someone who gave you work when others did not."
freelance,3bn7tr,money_tester,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:48:15 2015 UTC,"You're likely going to have trouble raising your rates on your existing clients. What I would do is immediately start trying to find new clients that will work with you at a higher rate. If your new rates are fair, you shouldn't have a ton of trouble doing that. Just be patient and stick to what you believe your time is worth. Ideally, you will get to the position where you no longer need the lower paying clients to survive. Then you can attempt to raise the rates on your existing clients, and if they decide they don't want to pay what you are asking, you will not be royally screwed if you lose their business."
freelance,3bn7tr,arisoncain,2,Tue Jun 30 20:12:46 2015 UTC,"Or, you can just bluff and tell your clients that because of increased demand for your work, you have to up your pricing for projects moving forward.  If they really are happy with your work, they should have no problem tolerating a modest increase in price for your services.  Finding another videographer and establishing the rapport you already have will cost them time and money anyway, so don't feel so bad."

You could complete all of the tutorials in a day, so I'd highly recommend checking them out during the two-week free trial.  If you're referring to picking up enough ""hard skills"" in web development, it's going to depend entirely upon you.  I'd wager that the Treehouse wordpress tutorials could get you far enough to build some simple wordpress sites, but you're not going to get much further unless you push yourself with personal projects."
freelance,3bkfbh,caffeian,2,Mon Jun 29 23:54:15 2015 UTC,"I've used Treehouse for boosting my knowledge in Rails, and have been freelancing for a year. I would say it can get you about 50% of the way there. The other 50% comes from doing side projects (I coded for my own startup for 2 years before starting freelancing so I wasn't a complete beginner), learning stuff from pluralsight and RubyTapas, reading about project management and soft skills. And even then I still made many, many mistakes. Nonetheless, Treehouse is a good place to get started. If you're serious about freelancing I highly recommend reading Soft Skills by John Sonmez while doing that. It helped me a lot along the way."

If what you say is true, then what is preventing me from making changes after the client signs it? I don't think that's how it works.  EDIT: Read some more. Now it seems you are contradicting yourself.   If you change terms in the contract after the client initials and signs it, then their copy without those changes will still exist, and they can prove that you changed the contract after they agreed to it. Similarly, they can't change any details after the contract is signed because you have proof of the contract without modifications.   So if I signed it first, and then my client made changes unbeknownst to me, and signed it, why can't I use my original signed copy to prove that these changes were made?  Honestly this just seems like an unnecessary extra paper scan/print/email."

So the lettering every page thing, is this a for real legal requirement where people who didn't initial every page of a contract won a case? Because not every client I've worked for has required this.  There's lots of hearsay about when it comes to legal documents."
freelance,3b6a9l,mmmpls,3,Fri Jun 26 10:11:22 2015 UTC,"I asked my lawyer about it when I was getting my documents drawn up. It's not a legal requirement, but it makes your lawyer's job far, far easier if it ever comes to court.  Essentially there's the possibility for a client to claim that the contract that you're arguing with isn't the one that they signed, or that they missed a page, etc. This cuts out that entire line of argument because you can prove that they at least saw the page. It is impossible to prove one way or the other that they actually read and comprehended a page, but by initialing it, they have acknowledge its existence, and agreed to its content.  Again, not a legal requirement, but something that will make your contract far stronger.  e: after a little googling, it seems that the practice is quite common in Europe, and not so common in the U.S. - again, not a legal requirement, but a good idea/practice."
freelance,3b6a9l,wombatjuggernaut,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:32:48 2015 UTC,I just make sure that the client signs and returns the entire contract in either one file signed or one physical envelope (the digital proof is easier).

freelance,3b6a9l,wombatjuggernaut,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:08:08 2015 UTC,"Again, a contract is a negotiation. 90% of my clients have been fine with my contract as is, but some have wanted changes (payment terms, scope, etc.)  If I signed it first, either:   The client can't make changes, and won't sign The client changes the document, signs it, and now the changed document has both signatures, but I may not have seen the changes I have to keep changing and signing the contract until the client is happy.   Basically, the workflow looks like this:   Me: Here are the terms of the contract.  Client: I agree to this contract with these changes. client signs.  Me: I assess the changes, and find them acceptable. I also agree to this contract. I sign.   If you sign first, there isn't evidence that you didn't agree to changes the client makes. If there is the possibility that your client may want to change terms, then you sign after they do."
freelance,3b6a9l,triplehardvark,2,Fri Jun 26 13:37:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, your point #4, negates #1.   Someone has to sign a contract first. If any changes need to be made, just draw up a new contract.  Contracts are not a negotiation (for the most part), but the end result of a negotiation.   TLDR; Make 2 copies, both parties sign all pages, don't make changes.

Also I've signed plenty of contracts first. It's not that big of a deal. There's a slight risk that the client will think ""well hey if he agreed to these terms so quick then maybe we should renegotiate"" but you can always refuse their amended terms. Also sometimes conceding minor points makes them feel like they've got a great deal when they really haven't."

freelance,3b5ul2,sqzr,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:29:12 2015 UTC,"There are many ways to determine time but the Cocomo model is a widely used technique for accurately determining time and costs of a project. You should find a online course on how to do it. The time of the project is also going to be determined by what development methodology you use (Agile, Information Engineering, Rational Unified Process, Extreme Programming, Rapid Application Development, etc), changes to the requirements / scope may lead to project running late and depending on your development methodology it may require a substantial amount of additional time.    Most IT projects fail due to a lack of planning, communication and not understanding the requirements and scope. You should state the scope, requirements and deliverables of the project. Before you start to work you should set out a work break down structure or pert chart or some way to determine milestones in your project. With most IT projects component A needs to be done before component B can work and component D can't work until both A&B work, etc. You need to keep this in mind. You should tell the client where you are and any problems or set backs that you have experienced, communication is very important here, if the project runs late you can go back and have something to show for your work. You need to communicate, communicate, communicate!!    Labour and hardware should always be separated, variable and fixed costs should never be combined, there are a few exceptions but this is a general rule. You need to be careful here, some countries have very strict rules regarding tax on this issue. If you include it in your hourly rate, you will have to pay tax as it is income, whereas if you separate it you could pay less tax (many countries for example have tax rebates for fuel). This is why most companies separate hourly costs from transport, accommodation etc. It will also look strange if your hourly cost is constantly changing."
freelance,3b5ul2,jndtv,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:34:07 2015 UTC,"How do you estimate the hours it will take to develop a system. Quite often a client will say 'I need you for X months' but they also say 'I need X created, can you give me a quote and time estimate'. I'm very good at putting together detailed Software Requirements Specifications but its still difficult to estimate how long a requirement will take not to mention a whole system. And I am experienced enough to know that things can go wrong and unexpected things can occur that affect the schedule so I dont want to provide a time and then have to come back and re-negotiate.   Practice, and being conservative. When you bill for a flat rate, the amount you bill is not ""how long I think this will take"", it is ""how long  do I need to guarantee that I can deliver on this?"". The estimate should be closer to your worst-case scenario. And when in doubt, favor higher estimates.     When you invoice a client weekly/fortnightly do you document in detail what you did? Or do you just say '40 Hours of 'Software Development' at X/hr'? Or do you drill down to detail 'X hours spent testing component Y', 'X hours developing interface Y'?   When I bill hourly, My minimal billing unit is 15 minutes. I typically break my work into 3 - 6 line items and include those. I don't provide detailed breakdowns as they aren't relevant, are time consuming to put together,  are rarely read by the client, and add no additional value to the project.    For projects that require specific and expensive infrastructure expenses (such as specialised servers or smart-card testing components) do you charge outright or factor this into your hourly fee?   Charge out right. This is the ""materials"" in ""time & materials"" billing. If you were a construction worker, this is the same as charging for building materials."

For example, someone says ""I want a pizza for dinner."" They put the call out on a system and offer a price for all the ingredients to show up. Other people monitor this and get a portion of the amount for as much of the task as they perform. People or robots close to the necessary materials get notifications to transport them to where the pizza is made. The person or robot at the place with an available pizza oven is tasked with creating the pizza, and then another person or robot is given the task of delivery.  This would require a microtransaction system to cover the fee for the labor, but a lot like Lyft or AirBnB people will be doing services on demand from where they are, rather than working in an office on tasks defined well ahead of time.

They'll likely tell her it's a civil issue. If paypal gets a rep for refunding clients' money, for literally any reason (right or wrong), they're gonna lose a lot of business from freelancers."

freelance,3b4gpt,Monsieur_dArtagnan,2,Thu Jun 25 22:01:43 2015 UTC,"It's worth whatever you can sell to people. I've seen people pay top dollar for mediocre work because of who sold it or how it was sold. People buy value, so if you can create a massive perceived value, you can charge a lot for it. It is difficult to tell you how much to charge because your ability to sell at a particular price point is going to, probably, be more important than your skill level. You seem anxious or hesitant... so it makes me question that you'd be confident in a sales environment, especially if you feel you were charging too much.  Two way to fix this:   Get better so your confidence is higher Do some research on sales techniques and perhaps do some trainings Go try to sell and see what happens. When you're done, interview yourself to figure out what went wrong and how you can improve.   For motivation and inspiration: https://dribbble.com/"
freelance,3b4gpt,robonubbins,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:14:10 2015 UTC,"Great response- yes, as you've perceived, I'm not great in sales, esp. when it's at my expense. I'm in the middle of trying to sell my services to an upstarting company that has no face, so to speak. I'm designing their logo, their storefront sign, their business cards, etc. I don't know if per hour or per job is the better pricing scheme here."
freelance,3b4gpt,robonubbins,3,Thu Jun 25 23:33:13 2015 UTC,"It's best to sell based on the value you'll bring to the company, rather than hours. If you spent 10 hours and did amazing work, they use the logo for 10+ years on all their signs, publications, business cards, shirts, trucks, etc.... how much value did you bring to that customer?  $350 if you did $35 per hour? Or does $1,500 suddenly sound more fair? Selling on value would allow you to mention how you're providing a top level design and a huge package of sizes and formats optimized for print, web, etc (this would take you 20 minutes to export, but suddenly is a massive added value because you send them 10 files instead of 1 and it saves the trouble of converting the files, etc on their end). You then explain ALL the possible uses for their new logo and even mention that YOU can do all of that work for them. Need a business card also? Shirt design? Understood! Let's work with these vendors and ensure that we get the right formats, sizes, etc over to them. Now you're being paid for the design, to be a consultant and help them figure out uses they may not have thought about also helping them interface with vendors (HUGE bonus here), etc. Think about everything you're providing to them versus thinking 'logo' design. Call this a 'branding package' instead of a 'logo design', etc. SELL everything. Anything you send to a client, any pricing / package list you have, should SELL for you. Make that the forefront of your communication and you'll improve in no time.  For specific pricing info, you might even just ping some local designers and pretend you're a business. Get them to divulge pricing if you can. Quick sample: Godaddy charges $499.99 and THIS is the quote about their service:   *Price does not include illustration, hand-drawing, or hand-coloring logo design. Design fees not applicable to receive order level discounts."

Yeah, I initially struck conversation with this man, telling him his current business card was a bit shoddy and offered to make him a better one, from that- it lead to the creation of his new logo, to the design of his storefront sign, to (in the near future) starting and running a website, catalogs and so on.. There's big plans, but he's of course worried about the price. I'm going to call a few local designers and see what their rates are and charge a lower, but fair price.

The line that pisses me off is this one: ""A service in which technically, you should be paying us for.""  Like I said, maybe fashion is different. But if someone said to me, ""Hey, write a couple free articles and I'll throw them on a popular website. If they do well, I'll pay you for future work. And you should be thankful. I should charge you for posting those articles"" then I'd probably lose my cool.  Oh really? I should be thankful you're asking me for free work so that you can make money from it?

Do not deliver ANY actual work to the client, place it on their server, give them login info, etc... until they have paid in full the final invoice.

In the future you might want to include some kind of payment/invoice schedule with penalties for late payments. Try sending a magic email and wait a week and see what happens. Hopefully this will reopen a dialog with them.  If I understand this correctly you wrote an hourly rate on your contract but the contract listed a fixed price for all the work? In that case I would charge them hourly since that should align with fixed price.     Whether or not they contact you, write an invoice for the hours already completed. The invoice should include a payment due date. Do not compromise on your rate. You have no reason to. Do not do anymore work for them until they pay you for the work you have already completed.

I always talk about the contract and deposit as one thing (or both needed to get started), so I really only drop the invoice on them if they ask for it.  They get a paid invoice upon acceptance of payment at my end.  But, I can see how ""sign my contract and pay my invoice"" can seem odd.  I think it's because paying invoices makes us think that are paying for something that's already done...like you do most service invoices.

I'm sympathetic to the situation that now exists as a result of Company B over-estimating how much time would be needed for this project and would be happy to discuss compromise relating to my fees and early termination of the contract. My on going relationship with both Company A and Company B is important to me but as things currently stand I could be out of pocket by $xxxx.    If that's any help ?"
freelance,3awhge,darksurfer,2,Wed Jun 24 13:11:50 2015 UTC,"It is. But I think I am going to refrain from responding further until I receive legal council. I received another email from Company A saying that the contract was terminated at the end of the first day ""as I informed you."" I have a voicemail from him several days after I discussed with him that the job seemed to finish early stating that they had not yet heard anything from Company B, asking me if they had called me in, and stating that I should be patient and wait and see.   I've contacted a couple of law firms to see if they are interested in helping me to settle this."
freelance,3awhge,CargoCulture,2,Wed Jun 24 16:41:15 2015 UTC,refrain from responding further until I receive legal council.   good idea.   what does your contract say about (early) termination ?
freelance,3awhge,sonofaresiii,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:58:55 2015 UTC,"""11. Termination of Agreement. Termination by Company. The Company may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, and without notice, and nothing in this Agreement or any other Company document, employment manual, or recruitment materials shall in any way limit or restrict the right of the Company to terminate this Agreement.""  So they could have terminated me on the first day without notification, but I have a voicemail from the guy 8 days later asking me if I had heard anything from Company B about going back to work. That seems to indicate to me they for at least 5 additional business days Company A considered me non-terminated."
freelance,3awhge,red_white_blue,7,Wed Jun 24 17:44:36 2015 UTC,"Just so you know, without notice does not mean without notification. They still have to tell you you're fired if they fire you. What the without notice part means is they don't have to tell you in advance. They can fire you on the spot, but they can't... do it in secret. That's ridiculous."
freelance,3awhge,red_white_blue,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:48:05 2015 UTC,"That seems to indicate to me they for at least 5 additional business days Company A considered me non-terminated.   yeah, that's pretty much what I think. so, is it worth souring your relationship with Companies A + B and any other company directors they happen to know for the cost of a weeks ""work"" ? (especially when you factor in legal costs and hassle).  Maybe worth speaking to a lawyer but  ..."
freelance,3awhge,inscrutablemike,4,Wed Jun 24 18:04:14 2015 UTC,"I would check your agreement with Company A VERY carefully. It may be that they are within their rights to terminate your agreement with them at any time. While I would push the hell out of this personally, their legal department might find it easier just to let you go.  However, agencies like this make money by placing people with other companies. They make an agreement with Company B to pay you $X/hour, and then Company A gets a percentage on top of that from Company B for their trouble. It's in their financial interest to keep you officially working as long as possible with Company B.   They may be trying to play you so they can still collect from Company B while not paying you anything."
freelance,3awhge,eugooglie,2,Wed Jun 24 13:02:53 2015 UTC,"They can terminate at any time. But so far they have not. There's only about two weeks left on the contract, so even if they let me go now I feel I should be able to collect for time thus far."
freelance,3awhge,clavicon,3,Wed Jun 24 13:28:32 2015 UTC,"While the other posters are correct about reviewing the contract, this push back from them is clearly bullshit. Here are the two possibilities: 1.) they pay you for time spent on call, 2.) they let you go.  It sounds like what the person on the other end of this conversation wants is 3.) you spend time on call but don't bill them unless specifically needed. Fuck. That. Being let go is a much better option."
freelance,3awhge,mwilke,3,Wed Jun 24 13:46:28 2015 UTC,"Don't stress about this. Remember, as a worst case scenario, you can always just walk away. You are under absolutely no obligation to work and not be paid for it (and being on call is work). I don't care what your contract says-- you are under no obligation to work and not be paid for it. Try to remember that threatening legal action is the number one way assholes try to scare people into doing stuff that's not right. Don't feel threatened, you are totally in the right here.  And, if they ever did try to follow through on any legal action, the conversation would go like this:  Them: ""He refused to do what we wanted.""  Judge: ""How come?""  Them: ""Because we said we wouldn't pay him.""  Judge: ""Case dismissed."""
freelance,3awhge,theli0nheart,2,Thu Jun 25 00:46:18 2015 UTC,"Wow man sorry to hear it went badly :/  I'm affraid all I know is that if they had you under the impression that you were 'on call'; ie: to be called upon to perform immediate services if needs be - then that is billable and you are owed money for making yourself available (and as others have said, but turning down other work in order to keep yourself available).  It sounds like they are either a very small and inexperienced (clueless) company - or that they are larger and know full well what they are doing and trying to take you for a ride...  Don't take their hostility as meaning you have done anything wrong."
freelance,3awhge,Matt0864,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:43:19 2015 UTC,Thank you. Your words are encouraging. This was my first freelance job and I've been very excited about it and my future options. Their response to my email quite alarmed me and made me feel like I was wrong. But I've reviewed everything I can understand and am contacting persons with better legal understanding to interpret the things I do not. Hopefully this gets settled. I teach most of the year and was rather counting on this being a lucrative way of working during the summer. Instead my summer has been wasted away waiting.
freelance,3awhge,krapple,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:46:02 2015 UTC,No worries.   Any freelancer starting out will happen across shitty clients sooner than they would expect. Even those who appear very friendly to begin with can turn around once it comes to paying and behave horribly - in turn making you feel bad and as though you've done something wrong.  It gets easier as you go and there'll come a point when you will be able to react to situations in full confidence that you're 'in the right'. Just try not to stoop to their level (however tempting).   I'd recommend reading up on some contractual law as well - it's very important to know your rights and your right to compensation (and interest) if a client is withholding payment. Very often you'll find that a client will quickly pay you once they become aware that you know your rights to additional interest for every week that they continue to withhold payment.
freelance,3awhge,krapple,5,Wed Jun 24 16:49:31 2015 UTC,"If you're contracted for a specific number of hours, why is this billed as if you're on a regular hourly contract? Was the 240 hours an estimate or a guaranteed number of hours to be paid?  Everything depends on exactly what each side promised, but within reason. I really doubt that a contract will be held valid if it either prevents you from being available for other work without compensation or allows you to bill for hours where you did no work without a promise of exclusive availability from you.  Lawyers (I am not one) will definitely have a more informed opinion, particularly if you have to figure out what the contract you signed means."
freelance,3awhge,positivenessness,2,Wed Jun 24 02:49:34 2015 UTC,240 hours was my calculation of 6 weeks at 40 hours per week. 6 weeks at 40 hours per week is the language used in the contract. Payment is $14/hour.
freelance,3awhge,jlebrech,7,Wed Jun 24 03:04:37 2015 UTC,"I'm more interested in what kind of work that you're doing for only $14/hr.

They're made aware that they can roll back (we put them on WP Engine unless they fight us on hosting), and told that if they need us to fix a problem we charge a minimum of an hour.   Our clients solve most of their own problems and feel empowered. It's been huge for us in terms of fewer tickets and better referrals.   Definitely teach 'em to fish."
freelance,3auy9l,jlengstorf,3,Tue Jun 23 23:38:41 2015 UTC,So do you teach your clients some things so that they can do those tasks themselves or do you keep all the work to yourself?   Charge them to teach them whatever they want to know...and charge them to fix it when the break it.

freelance,3auy9l,DoandDesign,3,Wed Jun 24 02:26:46 2015 UTC,"I joke that I am always setting my clients up to replace me, but it's true. My job is to make them as successful as possible and that includes training and setting up processes that make them more efficient. They appreciate this, and appreciate my value as an expert vs just a pair of hands.  In the long run, the clients hire junior people who end up doing the grunt work that I used to do and I take on higher level projects that need more expertise.  And there have been some clients who truly don't use me anymore because they have all my design assets and they don't need me to work on them anymore. That's OK too, because that means the work I did was successful, and that's a good thing."
freelance,3auy9l,oneluckykid22,7,Wed Jun 24 14:43:55 2015 UTC,The flip side of this is when you show a client how to edit some settings and all of a sudden they're a WordPress expert. Then you have to redo all the changes they make because they don't know wth they're doing! Glad everything worked out but be careful. I had opposite experience.
freelance,3auy9l,robonubbins,2,Tue Jun 23 18:47:00 2015 UTC,Wordpress has the history and the ability to roll back changes =) So just make sure you aren't sharing accounts and it's really easy to find who broke it and when.

Mostly because I explain it, show them then explain it again and they still manage to screw it up.  I had one client I would actually sit with, he would write down the process as I explained it, take additional notes as I did it - then he would immediately try to do something similar that same day.  He would still fudge it up.  I have had the rare client who 'got it', but it was few and far between.    That said, I still give my clients the option of learning if they want to learn.

Now that I have a full time design job I am happy to have stability in my work, but they hooked me up with some great clients and continue to send me job opportunities all the time. Coincidentally, a few people at the ad agency I work with now were initially brought on as freelance through CC and ended up getting full time work. It has the potential to lead to good things but I wouldn't ever stop relying on my own resourcefulness in favor of that."

For example, if you say your title is ""Content strategist"" they will throw you into anything that even starts with the letter ""C""   Sure, those places undercut...or rather they take a cut BUT if you are entry/mid level they will help you bring up your hourly and a lot of the times if you make some connections they will really work for you.   think of it like this...if you are not brave enough to knock on the front door and negotiate a high salary (trust me, most people are not aware of their own worth or they are afraid to call out the number they really really want) then you go through an agency.

Back them up with examples and explain why you feel it's the wrong direction. Provide counter recommendations and explain why they're the best course of action.  You said you see this as either you or the Digital Marketer being fired. Don't give them the option. Instead, decide what is more important for you, the income from this client or the quality of work that you do?    If you value the income, put up a fight but accept their choices in the end. Know the client relationship will slowly die from here as you feel devalued and resentment grows over time. Find another client to fill their spot ASAP.  If you value the quality of your work, put up a fight and if they still choose not to listen then you can respectfully end the relationship. This will ensure you're not forced to do work you don't agree with and keep focused on quality work.  In short, take control of the situation.

But also at some level it's not lostPixels.com (your business), it's theirs.  If it were your business you'd definitely do things differently, that much is clear.

I can tell the client values my work, but is frustrated with this middle person. The strategy person has casually brought up how the client is becoming more aware of how many hours they spend doing ""digital strategy"" AKA wasting time with phone calls and coming up with shitty ideas.

Evidently I'll get some sort of email for me to move my account to Upwork? Shrug. I guess odesk people are already on Upwork, so this'll mean the merging of elance clients/freelancers with odesk clients/freelancers?  Quite frankly the only thing I care about is making some money on the side, and hopefully turning it into something sustainable in the long run. From all my research on these companies that could be a big challenge, but from looking at other profiles it does seem to be possible."

freelance,3apnvr,robonubbins,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:07:01 2015 UTC,How did you land your first job? I've been actively submitting proposals for the last 3 days. I'm curious what it took for you to land job #1.
freelance,3apnvr,therealplanetx,3,Mon Jun 22 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"Nothing in particular, I just got a response.  I have a fully fleshed out profile including many examples of my work. I custom-write each proposal to match the job making sure to hit all the keywords they're asking for and I provide links to samples of similar work I've done in the past.  As a side note, there are two things I've been trying to do:   If there are any potential pitfalls in the project, I point it out and draw major attention to it. If it is a Wordpress project, I point out that I'll be making a full backup and doing all development on my own server. I then point out that anyone NOT mentioning this could cause irreversible damage or extended downtime for their main site. I usually mention that even if they are not choosing me, to be wary of anyone not mentioning these critical things because they may not be knowledgeable or careful with your project. I ALWAYS ask a ton of questions if the specs are unclear. It's pretty rare for a job on Elance to be fully specced out and 100% clear from just the original post. Sometimes it is just a few sentences, so there is absolutely no way that anyone could possibly bid a number of this project without making major assumptions or just plain bullshitting. I always make sure to ask these questions to point out how important they are for determining the true scope of work and cost. I've converted a couple jobs to consultant-like positions where they realize they need someone more technical just to help them spec out what they need.   Basically, in order for me to get anywhere near my preferred hourly rate, I need to provide absolute top-notch service and professionalism. So I try to make sure I am bringing things to light that no one else has mentioned and take the time to make my proposals stand out.  Another couple tips are only apply for jobs you've been invited to, are featured, or have very few proposals. If you apply to a job for someone who's never hired anyone on Elance before, is not paying for a featured job, and has 31 current proposals, you're not going to have a good time. Also keep in mind some of these people take weeks to select a freelancer. I have 31 open proposals right now where the people are currently choosing a candidate. Every day a couple more get awarded, some to me and some to others."
freelance,3apnvr,robonubbins,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"That's incredible. I've got my profile fully fleshed out. Testing top 20% or better with every visible skill in my profile. Verified my identity. Added work history samples to my portfolio. I've been writing  individualized proposals from the start, even used video proposals on 4 of the more higher paying ones.  I find 31 open proposals to be interesting. I was wondering how that would play out. Right now I just have 6 proposals open, 1 additional was already awarded to someone else.  I was afraid to have too many open, and then having to turn down jobs and waste my connections, but now I see that burning through my connections to get started is going to be the way to go.  Thanks for your replies!"
freelance,3apnvr,therealplanetx,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:08:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily agree that burning through them is a good idea... I am currently out. I have 3 active jobs right now, but once those are done, I am without connections for the rest of the month unless I buy more. It'd be a really poor spot if I depended on this income.  Sometimes I get responses immediately, other times it goes weeks without response and then gets awarded to someone else.   I also had my first client tell me he was worried to hire me since I had no jobs before... so I had to accept 1/3 my normal rate just to get my first gig. Maybe this could help you too? Apply for some smaller stuff that won't be a huge time sink and use a lower rate to get 1-2 reviews."
freelance,3apnvr,robonubbins,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:15:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I've actually been withholding my rate, because when you sort the proposals by price with lowest first, proposals without a rate will actually show up first. The ""Sponsored Proposals"" don't ""stick"" if you do any sorting, which greatly diminishes the value in my opinion.  I wonder if I would get better responses if I include a low rate, or if I'm better off withholding my rate to get them to ""bite"" on my proposal...then we negotiate a fair rate through messaging?"
freelance,3apnvr,therealplanetx,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:23:51 2015 UTC,"I've done both. If the project is clear, I usually include my price in the initial proposal. If it is not, I ask questions.

Yea, I disagreed. 2 months later he contacts me again willing to pay full price for that work, but only if I add a couple of features.  Reluctantly I agreed. A year later he wanted more changes in the project. Was willing to pay much more this time - as I was the only one who understood my previous work enough to change it. I flatly refused to work with him again. That felt good.    Just to make things clear - I only started working after all the money was in escrow (it was an elance job). But we agreed in advance that he only pays if he's satisfied with the work (that's a selling point I always stipulate on all my jobs).

A little off-topic but here's a story:  A few years ago, I was looking for a new job. It was a pretty weird situation because I got an offer from a company, I accepted, put up my 2 weeks notice, and a week later, the company ""downsized"" and found my position ""no longer needed"". I was pretty SOL but it did give me an insight: my new salary target. I was making a nice amount of cash at the time (full-time + freelance); however, this company offered me a 50% raise. hit, Within a couple of weeks, I was able to score 2 offers and at least 3 more prospects for the salary the original company offered me. Hell, I was willing to settle for a 20-25% raise! It was mind-blowing to me.  Fast-forward, there was a recruiter that talked to me. Talked me up a huge job at some law firm (THE law firm in town). I thought ""Holy shit, I'm gonna score big"". The job involved updating some legacy code, working alongside senior engineers, and building some quality software.   I did a phone interview, things went well, etc. Recruiter gets back to me all excited because they want to extend an offer. Now, mind you, I already found a job that matched my previously offered salary, so I was just waiting for this to work out even better.   She got on the phone and told me that they offered me LESS than what I was already making. In fact, it was my starter salary from years earlier. It was so far below the average and what I was already used to that I couldn't believe it. I flat out refused and told her that it's way below what I was looking for and what someone in that position would be paid.   She sounded offended, flipped out on me and told me that I could only ""dream"" about that kind of pay and that may be in another 10 years I could get close to that."

Actually, the opposite is already happening, to a degree, and right now it's taking the form of tax fraud. My sister worked for an agency a few years back that was secretly paying her as an independent contractor (she was absolutely, 100% an employee - she had to work onsite, she had to be there on time, she had to be there certain hours, etc.), hefting the tax burden onto her. She realized it at tax time when she went over her paystubs, etc. with a CPA. It cost her hundreds of dollars. (She reported it to the IRS, and they years later ruled in her favor. She's just now getting her money back.)  More and more people are freelancing (or otherwise, being hired as independent contractors), but it's not just because employees like the freedoms, etc. that come with it. Companies like it because they can get out of complying with labor laws - that's why the (US) government won't do anything to ban it (companies want as cheap of labor as possible). As more people do this, labor law will have to keep up to protect those workers (spoilers: they probably won't).  What scares the shit out of me is freelancing potentially being used as another excuse to strip workers rights and destroy unions. I hope I'm wrong!"

freelance,3acbum,legendhairymonkey,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:11:07 2015 UTC,"I've always found that the expression ""trust your gut"", is entirely dependent on the individual. Sure, that gut feeling may not be an immediately conscious influence, but it is still driven by our own personal experience and savviness. That gut feeling ameliorates with age, feelings of temptation and greed are the same whether we're 12 years old or 50. Our gut feeling on the other hand ages with us and is there to remind us when temptation or greed is pressing us to take a chance on something. I'm more experienced than some and far less than others but I'm starting to trust my gut more and more as I get older, whether it is professionally or romantically. The call you have to make when you get that nagging feeling and that voice of doubt, is whether that voice stems for fear or whether it stems from experience. If it comes experience I say trust it and hedge your bets. if on the other hand its is fear that is stopping you from taking a chance, ignore it and jump in. You'll either succeed and will have overcome another hurdle, or you'll fail in which case your gut feeling will be stronger the next time you hear that voice of doubt."

I recently answered a similar question with a lot of detail; hopefully that can help you out a bit.   The biggest thing will be discussing a results-based working style instead of time-based. As you're seeing right now, it's tough to measure time. However, if you sit down with him and discuss what results you're both responsible for, you have a simple yes/no question to answer: is thing you agreed would be done done?  This also gives you the paper trail you need to part ways without ruining the friendship. If he has a todo list that you both agree is fair and he continually fails to finish the list, then it's pretty obvious he's not pulling his weight and you should part ways amicably.   The bonus here is that — for you — you'll have further clarity on what you actually want from your friend. Should he be sending an email broadcast a week and two social posts a day? Anything else? Be very clear with yourself so you aren't upset over a vague uneasiness over responsibility.   (This will also prevent you from overstepping and doing things he could do; if you're ambitious and always trying to be proactive, he might feel micromanaged, which would tank his sense of autonomy and motivation.)

In the skill set that was required for the gig, I was a more senior guy and he was hoping that we could work on it together - with me backing him up.  We were both billing hours to the client, and initially everything was OK - however he started billing A LOT of hours, and he wasn't doing any work at all.  Eventually the client called me and said that they wanted to continue working with me, but I had to get rid of my friend.  I knew that they were right, and I knew that he was swindling them.  I was put into the position where I had to fire my friend from the job that HE got me involved in, in the first place.    I did it.  He wasn't being ethical, and it was at the clients request.  Our friendship ended unfortunately, and he bad-mouthed me to a few mutual friends; but  in the end, I didn't want to be friends with someone who wasn't ethical.    The client relationship lasted about 11 years, and I still maintain many friendships from the client staff.  I was also able to get a lot of word of mouth business from it as well.  Sometimes you have to just do what's right for you  Think of it this way .. if he was subcontracting for you, instead of billing directly to the client, would you carry him?"

I ran into a similar situation, but even worst, because I was feeling like she wasn't producing as much as me, and she was feeling the same thing about me.  So, it became pretty dysfunctional pretty quickly.    My best advice, is to not make it 50/50, but rather have a fee for work structure that you both agree on.  So, when a task or effort is done, the person doing that gets paid.    This helps for a number of reasons:   it helps compensate for the difference in effort/passion/skills/results that is just going to happen it helps when on partner needs to take time off (vacation, sickness, other reasons) it helps scale the business, because when you want to bring in new workers to help out, you basically have a rate card for what to pay them."

I think it has more to do with all the resources (35 js references and 19 stylesheets!) and the fact that the full page size is 4mb.

No guarantees, but I'm guessing setting up a good cdn could shave a few seconds off your NA times and a decent chunk off the others. That said, 3-4 seconds is still far from optimal, and I'm going to say again I think your overall site size and the large number of files you're serving are your main problems. Working on those should be top priority (in terms of increasing site speed).  edit: oh, and this is random, but shouldn't your ""dutch version"" link be in the same language as the site it's going to redirect to?

freelance,3a32mq,CoffeeZombieV,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:27:34 2015 UTC,I would also add Joomla to this list. Among other things I develop Joomla templates from scratch and I'm making a killing because it's much harder finding Joomla devs than WordPress devs in my area. Both of them were built in PHP though so if you know php you can actually do either. The most important thing is to keep learning though. Charge clients for weekly/monthly backups and updates if they run a cms and don't bother with hosting unless you can dedicate time to it. Hosting has kept me incredibly busy every time something went wrong and the financial returns were never worth it. Rather get a good hosting company and refer your clients to them through an affiliate link. That way you still get something in return without the hassle of clients avoiding payments while you have to pay for domain renewals and all that

freelance,3a32mq,Thriven,2,Wed Jun 17 01:37:46 2015 UTC,"web dev is a broad field.  freelance can touch on all aspects at times, and can even bleed over into web hosting.  from my experience:  on one end of the spectrum is possible called pure 'front end development.'  those are your typical marketing websites that looks good and are content heavy.  adding any more functionality than a contact form would be outside the norm.  these sites rely heavily on HTML, CSS (or SASS/LESS) and Javascript, and the point of the site is to project a professional look, grab attention and atract leads, and thus the makers of these sites are skilled in executing that and have an eye for design.  these are also at times backed by something liek Wordpress or Drupal, or have a custom CMS associated with them.  the other end of the spectrum is pure 'backend development.' those are your striclty functional web site that maybe is at best bootstrapped with Bootstrap.  these websites are used by employees of a business to perform internal tasks, or are an API or backend that other devs communicate with.  these sites are data-driven.  they are made with a server side language like C#, PHP or other and backed with some sort of database like MySQL, MSSQL, NoSQL, or other.  things like algorithmic complexity or SQL optimization may be required to perform especially difficult tasks but asthetics are less important.  in the case of an API, a user interface may not even exist.  somewhere in the middle are consumer web apps written in a front-end Javascript framework like Angular and they are data-driven consumer sites or apps.  these sites need to look good as well as performa a specific function.  they typically also use a server side language for certain validation.  they can also be written in a purely server side language and use Javascript for some nice affects.    this is not exhaustive and there are plenty of niches, but some examples of skills that are in demand"

It sounds like you did not understand what was required and the client took advantage of that.  Specify how many hours in a day you work, which basically brings you back to per hour billing with a guaranteed number of hours billed. Give them an overtime rate or just decline to work overtime depending on your preference for money or work/life balance."

freelance,3a1wnr,sushiRavioli,6,Thu Jun 18 09:16:57 2015 UTC,"A day rate is what the client will pay for a day's work. If you don't define what that is, or put limits to it, then you can't say that the client's interpretation is wrong. Take that as a learning experience.   Next time, just say that your day rate is for a maximum of X-hours (could be 8 or 10). Anything beyond that is overtime at a specified hourly rate. Or give them another rate for a 12-hour day."

If you're going on a day rate, and you're not union or anything, you need to be clear on what constitutes a day. You can't just go by what you think it should be, and you can't declare it's only ten hours after the fact.  It's a learning experience. I'll always let someone know what my day rate includes. If somehow you don't, and you're being significantly overworked, you can bring it to the attention of the client while working. But you can't charge more for it after the fact.  One time I had a client tell me they'd pay me for the day, and they estimated around ten hours. The production got deep into the weeds and it ended up being around sixteen, maybe eighteen.  I sent them an invoice for the day, and said ""I know we didn't discuss over time, so I'll just bill you the rate we agreed, but to be clear I was really not expecting sixteen hours as we had only estimated ten.""  They apologized and gave me an extra half day."

freelance,3a1wnr,ElleSquare,2,Tue Jun 16 20:12:18 2015 UTC,"Personally, I leave onsite work after 6-10 hours and charge a day for that.  I bill in increments of quarter days, but I'm generally pretty lax about it.  In your position I would be charging 1.5 - 2 days per day.  Technically speaking in my contract or verbal agreement, a ""day"" for me is a unit of 8 hours and a ""week"" is a unit of 5 days.  The gain in day/week units is a cost savings over hourly.  I also will almost never do hourly billing, so there's that.  However, if you didn't specify, you'll probably have to eat it.  Live and learn."

freelance,3a1ap1,apurupie,3,Thu Jun 18 00:44:42 2015 UTC,"You have to adapt to your client's culture. Some sectors are very casual (especially in the creative area) while others are more formal. It's better to over-dress a little bit, but overdoing it is just as bad as under-dressing. You don't want to stand out either way. I'm going to talk about men's clothing, because it's what I know, but it should be simple to translate that into women's clothing if necessary.  In general, you can't go wrong with a ""business casual"" look:   nice pants (dress pants, corduroy, slacks or khakis, no jeans or shorts). Darker is more formal. long-sleeved collared shirt (any color but avoid patterns) tucked-in the pants, with optional tie, or a polo-shirt. Even a turtle-neck could do. comfortable yet elegant shoes (could be dress leather shoes or loafers). Optional casual blazer or sweater on top of that.   Financial, insurance and legal definitely lean more towards formal attire. You won't look out of place if you wear a suit, but it might not be necessary. At least go business casual, but favour a collared shirt over a polo shirt or turtle-neck.  Technological companies tend to be casual. Even executives tend to wear casual attire. The bigger the company, the more likely the executives will wear suits, but it really depends on company culture. Here, your basic business casual look is perfect and you can absolutely do without the tie and blazer. Absolutely avoid t-shirts and shorts.  In manufacturing and retail, things tend to be casual, so follow the same rules as for technological companies. I've visited a lot of small to medium manufacturing companies and I've rarely seen CEOs wear a tie. Things will be different if there is a separate corporate headquarters, so dress up a little bit.  Creative agencies tend to be very casual, but some of them have a very heightened fashion sense (hipster or else). Be sure what you're wearing is clean and in good taste. Even jeans are acceptable here, as long as they're clean, and fit you well."

There's a mile of difference between online freelancing and real-life freelancing.  Online clients tend more to expect you to work for slave wages, because that what they can get by outsourcing overseas.  You'll see a lot, and I mean a LOT of people who expect you to work for nothing, before you come across someone willing to pay you what you're worth.  Don't compromise.

Stay away from Elance et al unless you want to be low-balled and occasionally burned. You might also try shopping your portfolio to ad agencies, they generally pay the best rates.  That being said, you might also try to quote a little lower and see if you can determine a rate where you get more interest. Often the rates listed in professional manuals are more reflective experienced professionals (which you are not yet) based in NYC or LA.   The other things is, if people are talking to you about prospective projects, maybe you are turning them away by quoting a price too soon. Sometimes it's good to give a broad range, and then take more time to find about their specific needs for the project. Think of it as a kind of dance -- if you take more time to dance around the issue of a specific price, you can use that time to sell yourself to them."

With that, my advice comes from working on art with an emphasis on realism.  If you can't find the clients that will pay your rates, it's most likely that your technical skill level might not meet the standards for the price you've set. I had the same problem in the beginning because my mentors recommended to not undercut myself, but that made it very frustrating as a newb artist. On the one hand, I had to think that my art was 'valuable' by keeping my rates firm. On the other, I was reminded that my stuff sucked every time a client turned down my proposed rates.  I think you should ask yourself if your skill-level meets the rates that you've set and be realistic about it. If it's not, can you afford to spend time on developing your skills and then return to job-hunting? I've learned from experience that taking on lower-paying, low-skill jobs didn't help me with my technical abilities. All the crappy pieces I created in those jobs were never posted on my portfolio or helped me get more jobs. On the flip-side of that, the portfolio pieces that landed me my first big clients were personal pieces done between jobs.  Also, after you reach a certain threshold in your technical skills, you'll realize that it gets significantly less difficult to acquire more 'high-paying' clients."

Respect your work, and keep your prices where you feel comfortable.  That said, if there's a particular job or client that you DO want to land, negotiate with them. I've found that the best clients I've had are honest about their budget, and appreciate it when you let them know you're lowering a price because you want to work with them specifically, or you're really interested in the project. This leads to a better work experience, because they know they're getting something great for less money, and it usually leads to more work. (And a great testimonial!) Of course it doesn't always work that way - sometimes people just play broke to get you to lower your price. So don't do it for everyone. Be picky.  In my experience, you're going to pass (or be passed) on most jobs you try for at the beginning of your freelance career. And that's ok. Don't give up, and don't compromise."

freelance,39wxbj,Asks-Qs,3,Wed Jun 17 14:40:59 2015 UTC,"Mind posting your rates? Or examples or what projects and what rate you proposed? I'm not doubting they're reasonable, but sometimes you can come up with different ways of billing rates so they are more palatable.  You're still competing with people like your former-student-self on projects like the ones you used to take, something to keep in mind. Now that you're not a student, you have the time to chase bigger projects that people wouldn't risk giving to students.  I'm not familiar with the freelance illustration market, but you might want to consider branching out from just doing pure illustration.   For example, trying to build relationships people who have more technical web development skills who source the design to you. Your skills are complements and you both can send work to each other."
freelance,39wxbj,CoulterPatton,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:13:25 2015 UTC,"My rates vary depending on the type of job - I try to use the AOI pricing model as a guide (UK prices) as prices vary greatly depending on the license needed, number of illustrations, purpose, size, duration, etc. I also do graphic design (freelance) alongside illustration, it's a little easier to pick up in terms of odd jobs here and there and it gives me pieces to include in a design folio if I ever decide to go for that type of studio job. For GD, it's around £25 p/h (low for UK prices, I don't think that's crazy) and don't have issues with clients agreeing to that. However, when I quote for a full project (such as full branding), people aren't willing to pay that price and have lost a few branding/logo projects to that. I have a modest design portfolio, it's not large but the few things I have done have been recognised."
freelance,39wxbj,twelvis,3,Wed Jun 17 14:45:39 2015 UTC,"Ok, so pricing objections are a good thing, and this is a good example of it. If nobody ever complained about your price, that means you're charging too little. And you still might be.  Many times the prospect is blamed for being cheap or unrealistic, but most of the time it's the freelancer failing to sell themselves.   Pricing is no objection when the value you provide exceeds the cost. The majority of the time, people are put off by the price because you haven't communicated the value of your work. The prospect just doesn't see it and thus can't justify your pricing.   I can't speak for illustrations so you might want to go check with AOI how you can do that."
freelance,39wxbj,emanresu_sdrawkcab,3,Mon Jun 15 15:32:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a freelance motion GFX/film editor, but here's my 2 cents…    I'll be honest, I cringed a little when you said,   should I be patient and wait for the right client to come along?    No. You should never wait. Being passive is one of the biggest mistakes I see freelancers (and a lot of business owners) make.   One of the best things you can do for yourself as a freelancer (imho) is to take an active and targeted approach to your career.  In practical terms, that generally means doing something like the following:    Decide what types of work interest you the most.  Research those markets. Understand who the big buyers are and who does the buying. Research other successful artists and contractors in those markets. Look at their portfolios, study how they market themselves, do they use an agent? If so, what agency do they use? Look at your own portfolio and compare it to other artists. Do you need to focus your portfolio more? Are your technical skills where they need to be? Get your house in order. Make sure your brand looks professional and your portfolio is tight and targeted. Start actively promoting yourself using the research you've gathered. Contact companies you'd like to do work for. In the beginning focus on smaller, more approachable companies. Get your name out there. Put some effort into marketing yourself. Offer people value. Give them something or teach them something. Etc...   Anyhow… the big takeaway here isn't to follow those bullet points step-by-step, the takeaway is to start thinking about your career in an active and strategic way. Being passive means sitting around updating your portfolio with a bunch of random work and waiting for people to discover you. Being active means deciding what you want your career to look like and then problem solving to make it happen.   The more active you can be in seeking the type of clients you want to work with, the less you'll have to deal with bottom-feeders who only want to save a few bucks."
freelance,39wxbj,GSto,2,Mon Jun 15 22:20:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks, you've made a great point. I need to dedicate time to pull my finger out and do some personal projects aimed at the type of clients I want. Done and noted"
freelance,39wxbj,sprkwd,3,Wed Jun 17 14:46:53 2015 UTC,"You're assuming you've lost the sale. It's likely they had no intention of buying (or paying anything that could be considered reasonable). People who lose interest when pricing is brought up are nothing more than tire kickers.   Nevertheless, this isn't an economics problem (obviously some illustrators make buttloads of money); it's a sales problem.  What seems to work for me and many others is not even focusing on cost. Get them to state the reasons for needing illustration. Get them to state what happens if they don't get the best illustration possible. Make them be aware of the value your work will provide. If someone's convinced (i.e., you've convinced them) you'll provide $1000 of value, they won't really care whether you're asking for a few dollars more.   For example, most of clients could hire someone to edit their neuroscience reports for $10/h. However, as their entire career hinges on their ability to publish high-quality work and if I make them realize the true cost of not hiring me, they have no issue paying me a lot.  My newest client pays extremely well, because paying top dollar for me is but a fraction of the revenue I can gain them in the form of secured contracts. For example, they give me a $1, and I try to get them $10 in revenue; it's simply not worth it to insist on paying me $0.80.  Of course, this doesn't work 100% of the time; sometimes, the client just can't afford you or they are just being cheap. Do BMW salesmen slash prices because some schlub can't afford one? Of course not."
freelance,39wxbj,money_tester,4,Tue Jun 16 02:11:53 2015 UTC,"I do web and software development, so this might not be a perfect 1:1 translation to the illustration world, but the context in which you quote your price matters a lot.  My process has three general steps: 1) separate yourself from the competition through identifying the problem thoroughly - do research on whatever they're trying to do, or ask them; but essentially by the end of this phase you should be able to articulate their goals as well as they can (it's more impressive to them if you can find the problem independently of them, but even then you should still ask and have this conversation with them). This is also important in software because the clients often don't know exactly what they want, just what they need as an end result, so this may not apply to illustrating. But either way you need to seem more attuned to their problem than at least the low-rate competition (which is a pretty easy goal to achieve). This step is also important in figuring out if you're even a good fit to solve their problem - sometimes I find that they actually wanted some sort of software that I am inexperienced in or otherwise unsuited for, at which point I try to find someone in my network who can do it for them instead (possibly with a little bit of a kickback for finding the client) Then 2) frame the solution to their problem in context to the problem's costs or the solution's benefits - whichever number is bigger. Read this article. As stupid as it sounds, it works. Basically you need to find a big number that is relevant enough that the client doesn't say ""wait a minute, why are you telling me this?"" Normally for me that's how much they'll make or save using the site or software I provide. This part may take some market research. Finally 3) drop your (comparatively smaller compared to what you showed in step 2) rates on them.   This method still sometimes gets refusals (no method is a silver bullet), but usually it's not so much outright claiming that my rates aren't worth it (sometimes they say my rates are too expensive, but not the sort of ""I could get the same thing for <fraction> of your rate"" that I often got before - basically the difference between overpriced junk and quality beyond that which you can afford - a shoddily build McMansion vs. a real quality estate).  It's important to note that I only do freelance on the side, and have only been using this method for about 2 years out of the 3 I've been doing freelance (3 projects out of the 5 I've done on a freelance basis; I didn't count how many proposals I sent but this method seems to get a higher hit-rate), so my experience using it could be attributed to just dumb luck rather than it actually being better."

freelance,39x9vj,RollX,4,Thu Jun 18 03:07:11 2015 UTC,"I've worked for 2 years in two different ""creative"" agencies as agraphic designer. During this time:   If client rejected a project I would get all the shit, all those ""we need improvements from you"" talks etc.. If client accepted project & was extremely happy with it suddenly my boss took whole responsibility for the project. With few exception I've found people working there to be lazy, not interested in self development and generally interested just in completing tasks with minimum effort. After few months I've started feeling similar. It did not matter whether I was giving my best or doing minimal effort. There were no rises, rewards or encouragement from anyone. I've just needed to keep projects from failing which sometimes was unavoidable with ""creative, absolutely necessary"" corrections from my boss. Some simple projects, that should be done & closed within few hours, were dragged on for days because of number of people that had to be involved due to agency structure. It was small few people agency but  a project still had to be: 1. Briefed to me by account manager. 2. Briefed to me by boss. 3. Discussed on separate meeting (first two points were separate briefings). 4. Account & my boss (me excluded) had to decide how to charge the client. 5. Project review by boss & account. 6. Etc.Etc. A task that as a freelancer I do in 3-4 hours took days in those places. I've made calculations how much my company charged the client, and how much time I've actually spent on working it by myself. In both places, clients weren't given priority categories. A project for big client with great history of payment was given the same priority as the some unknown firm that obviously was just fishing for project ideas.   I could go on, but I'll just say I quit the second place, when after finishing a big project account manager & copywriter got each bottle of expensive champagne for it. Account manager just sent 5 emails & copywriter wrote two sentences. Guess who did the rest. To be fair I was given a ""motivational"" email that ""encouraged"" me to keep the good work. I've started freelancing the next day.  Sorry for long post, It reminded me of the time when I worked there & I needed to vent.

freelance,39tqsb,Aholahi,9,Sun Jun 14 18:12:56 2015 UTC,"Story time:  Once a long time ago I worked for a company.  They loved my work but didn't really like me personally.  I liked the paycheck but didn't really care for them either (didn't like the management, etc).    So they send me out of town for a week - routine business trip.  While I am gone I find out they are interviewing candidates to be my my replacement.  Of course I am pissed so when I get back I confront them about it and their response was: We're not looking to replace you, but it is our prerogative to ""see what's out there"" and ""we do it all the time - it's nothing personal"".  They made a big apology and tried to reassure me that ""everything is fine"" - but that was just to keep me from walking out the door immediately.  I said ""OK"" and left it at that.    I immediately went into full scale job-search mode and had a new job within a month and turned in my resignation.  They acted like I had somehow offended them by quitting when I had said ""everything was OK"".    The reality is that they would have fired me on the spot if they had been able to find a qualified replacement.    The moral of this story is: they are lying to you - they are looking to replace you.  As far as suing - if you ""need more cash"" then it doesn't sound like you're in a position to sue anybody.  I always laugh at people who automatically say ""sue them if they're in breach of contract!"".  I have been on both ends of multiple lawsuits - the only winners are the lawyers because they make you pay up front (they're not stupid).    Contracts are merely up front agreements between two parties that can be used in a lawsuit if one or the other party feels the other has violated the terms.  If you don't have the financial means to carry a lawsuit through to completion then you're better off wiping your ass with that contract because that's all it's worth.    One final thought - I worked at another organization that was lawsuit happy - they would sue anyone at the drop of a hat.  They had secured multiple judgments against various defendants over a period of several years.  Winning right!?!?!? Wrong - none of the judgments were ever collected because the losers didn't have any money.  A lawsuit should always be the last possible option."

It's not unreasonable for them to look into other contractors, you're just someone they brought on to perform a task and it's really up to them how close they want to keep you. 10 years is a long time but you don't really work there so it's not like they owe you anything.

The only clause you mentioned was 30 days notice (no minimum number of hours or anything else?). They haven't voided the 30 days so I'm not sure what your losses are. Suing them would be a guaranteed way of getting the 30 day notice as well.   I'm not sure what you would say to the client but I would advise against that in general. You could end up facing a suit from your current company (even if it's found in your favor, it could hurt your image).   The non-compete may not hold up but going to work directly for the client wouldn't help your case. Your current company could easily prove damages.   It sucks, but the best bet may be to put in notice, work the 30 days, find another gig, and move on.

If you are making $300 a week, someone who makes 500k a year could wipe his ass with your weekly salary and not feel regret when he tosses that shit stained money away.  If you got a job and you made $100 commission for the week one trying to encourage you might say ,""man, that's ass wipe money. I made $23k in commission last month."" Letting you know there is bigger money out there and not to be complacent.   You are really underpaid. My mother in law makes $150k a year as in inside sales (just moved to outside sales) rep at her company. No college education, been at the company 10 years but she has been making $100k+ for the last 6 years. Her base starting was 50k back in 2005.  You have what sounds like great experience and this small company and they're totally jerking you around. Demos, presentations and technical experience is hard to find in sales people as sales is usually filled with very driven technology incompetent individuals.   What is holding you back from leaving?"

Job hunting can be soul sucking but then again, this toxic relationship at work seems worse. I literally think about it all the time and it sucks."
freelance,39tqsb,springer70,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:39:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I almost took a different approach in my last email asking ,""Are you addicted to video games, or drugs, or a have an obsessive compulsive in some other manner holding you back?""  I worked freelance webdev/server administration for 3.5 years but I was simultaneously addicted to an MMO for 3 years - 16 years ago. I was making around 18-19k a year but I was only working 10-20 hours a week totally giving me time for my addiction. One day when thinking to myself as I past a receptionist who I knew her compensation because I integrated Quickbooks with an online payroll service I realized ,""This person who answers a phone and basically fedex's packages all day is making nearly double what I'm making, I have way more skills than she does"".   Job hunting can be soul sucking but then again, this toxic relationship at work seems worse.   No, no, no. You must make it fun. You seem to have a lot of confidence. Think of your skills as a precious commodity that the public is dying for. Harp on your strengths and build pride in them.  Turn looking for a job as something you regularly do, even if you find a job you are happy with. When you get a new job, every few months update your resume with something new so the time you do say ,""I've exhausted this employer and my compensation isn't on par with what I'm doing"" you have trained your mind set that you are a precious commodity and you CAN go elsewhere. This will give you confidence to approach your employer and tell them ,""I need you do raise my commission..."" You don't have to actively apply for jobs but you should regularly see whats out on the jobbing sites.  I wrote a post on /r/jobs a while back  One of the key points I make is  1) Invest in a good looking resume and ignore the recruiters and HR people who don't know dick about Microsoft Word. Hiring managers love my resume and it has gotten me numerous jobs and those are the only people who matter in my book.  2) Make a text resume. A text resume is a non-rich text file (.txt) that has start/end dates; why you left last job; what you did at your last job. As you are applying for jobs and they ask these questions, update your text resume so you'll have the answer for next time. This will speed up your applications immensely. Instead of dreading an application and skipping a job because it looks like the requirements are too high, you know that you can fly through the application because you have everything pre-answered. At that point its copy/paste."

I've always been most interested in full-time employment and for that they have been kind of lack-luster. Not because I feel they aren't trying but because I feel there is a lack of communication between themselves and potential employers sometimes.  Aside from the creative group however, many many many recruiting agencies who have reached out to me were just a complete waste of my time. The only other exception was Creative Niche. But literally every other recruiter has been a giant waste of my time who didn't even remotely understand the technologies they were talking about and the jobs they were trying to place."
freelance,39sau7,diggv4blows,2,Sun Jun 14 14:14:29 2015 UTC,"I would treat them like any other client. Attempt to negotiate a raise with them. If you haven't been with them long enough, don't otherwise feel comfortable asking for a raise, or they say no, then make a priority of replacing the hours you spend on them with better-paying hours. That means you'll have to start turning down their projects, and if they ask why, tell them the truth. At that point, if they quit on you, it's no skin off your nose: you already have better paying work lined up."
freelance,39sau7,codeforthought,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:26:00 2015 UTC,If this is straight contracting gig - you work for the agency and they bill you out to the client - then the client rate is set.  Say the agency bills the client 100.00 an hour.  The recruiter then negotiates with the talent (you) for as low a rate as possible and they get a commission based off the spread between the bid -vs- ask.    I've done this is the past - if the client likes you - you can play hardball with the recruiter because they're betting that one guy in the door will mean 10 down the road.    You can also negotiate on percentages of anybody else you bring onto the project.  I've known guys who were making more off their referral commission than they were making on their hourly.

The first place we went to the landlord didn't want to know, he absolutely did not want anyone who wasn't in a secure, long term, well paid job. You know what you call those kinds of people? Buyers. Surprised he ever found anyone really. Apparently he also declined someone with a 6 year old CCJ on the credit report despite the couple being very well paid and in secure employment.  We lost our second application as we were the second choice. Third house we got it on, but it wasn't the easiest process in the world.  Mortgages you will have trouble with, but providing you're earning a fairly decent amount you should be fine. You probably shouldn't be buying a house if you're not settled into freelance for a fairly good amount of time and earning consistently throughout the year so you can pay the repayments."

freelance,39s012,G-Solutions,2,Sun Jun 14 05:33:38 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend & I are both self employed. We've only applied for and rented one place since becoming self employed. The landlord had a lot of questions about what we do, but I'm not sure he ever really understood what either of us did. After asking several questions about our jobs he asked for six months of payment proof (which was fairly easy for us compared to most freelancers because we only have two income sources - paypal and stripe). Most renters only require 3 months so we just needed to prove that we had been making 3x the rent amount for twice as long as a 'normal' renter would have had to prove. No extra deposit. We live in a somewhat rural area so there isn't tons of competition for rental properties, though so that probably helped. The place we got into had been empty for five or six months before we applied."

He'll probably leave, and it'll probably be a good thing, but to me it'd be better than just telling him he's fired.  Also - a week is pretty reasonable for invoices, unless hes agreed on faster terms and is failing to meet them (most businesses I've worked on would consider a week close enough to ""due on receipt"")."

I sort of have a feeling that my pricing was too high for this client and that's the reason, but I'm a crazy person that hates not knowing. What do you guys think?   Don't worry about it why you didn't please the client. If the client is as you say, then this is the type of client that can't be made happy.   You'll be better off if you can examine what you can do in the future to avoid these types of clients. You saw a few bad signs. It's always a huge red flag to me when a prospective client complains about the previous people they hired that didn't work out."

Ultimately, I just stopped taking this guy's jobs. I think I made about $52 in those two months because he would only have ""quick jobs"" that ""should only take 15 minutes.""  Now that I'm a ""real"" freelancer, this guy was making me work way too hard and being a little emotionally abusive when I couldn't drop whatever I was doing to proofread a flyer.  I'm sure it sucks being dropped. It's hard not to take that kind of stuff personally, especially if you work hard to be professional.   It seems pretty clear why the client is no longer interested: cost. The client doesn't value your services for what they are, and he thinks he'll get the same quality and speed at a cheaper rate. He's living in a fantasy world.   Raising my prices (by about 400%) was the best thing I ever did for my freelance career because my clients got way better."

freelance,39hcmw,codeforthought,2,Thu Jun 11 20:01:22 2015 UTC,"I'm a freelance web developer in the US, and here's some stuff I've learned in my 5 years of freelancing.   You're not actually competing with cheap developers in India, Pakistan, etc, because you don't want the type of clients that will hire them. Use a pricing calculator to determine a good hourly rate to start at. That means it should be a wage you can live on and pay your bills with. Tell people in your network that you're taking on some freelance clients and ask them to mention you if they hear of anyone that's looking for a contractor. Referrals make the best gigs. Once you have a full roster of clients, every other new client (or so) you onboard should be paying a higher rate than the previous client, even if only slightly. This means your rates will naturally progress upwards, and it'll give you the confidence later to ask your older clients for rate increases (or part ways with clients that fight your rate increases). You will lose leads because some people won't want to pay your rate, whether your rate is low or high. But if you already have a full or almost full roster of clients, then you'll never be in a desperate enough situation to settle for less money. That's a great position to be in, because you have the power, not the lead. Try to have a phone conversation with every client before the contracts are signed (you are having clients sign contracts right?), to check for red flags. You might be surprised what you can learn about someone during a 15-minute phone call. Follow your gut. If you get a weird feeling about someone or their project, say no thank you.   Good luck!"

An internal website does not need to support legacy browsers. Etc.   This post feels like it's written by somebody a little out of touch with the end goal of product.

And in the post I was refering to the developer even defaced the website and put a defamatory statement on it. That's a big no no and this is what my post is about. Not about the obvious that you should be payed for your work and the client doesn't own the code until he pays you.

This is good.  Does it also explicitly state a consequence for not providing timely feedback?  1) The next e-mail you send needs to be a gentle reminder that the project is now running 5 days late and that all milestones and delivery dates are being pushed outward accordingly.  2) If that doesn't light a fire under the client ( give them, say 48 hours to respond), pick up the phone.

It's partly to stop tax cheats and partly to stop companies from abusing their workers.  If your worried just pick up some small additional jobs every so often.

freelance,399u5q,kickingpplisfun,2,Wed Jun 10 13:27:35 2015 UTC,The government wants to avoid that companies dodge taxes by hiring people as 'freelancers' for a few years instead as full time employees (in that way they avoid a lot of taxes since independent people have other obligations). They want to avoid fake freelancers (Scheinselbständigkeit).

The reclassification can result in the imposition of fines, penalties, and back-taxes for which the employer is generally liable. These amounts could cost a business large sums of money.

That price may be ridiculous, and I may want half, most or all of it up front depending on the client, but there's still a price I'd be willing to accept.  One time, when I was just starting out, I agreed to shoot this movie for this producing team. My rate was way, way low. It would've been one of my first big jobs. They agreed to take me on. Awesome!  Then the project got pushed back a few weeks. Okay, no biggie. Then another couple weeks. ...fine.  Then, of course, a few months. Then indefinitely.  I stayed with them this whole time, doing pre-production meetings, etc. Nothing major, but I was certainly willing to follow them on this ride. Eventually I told them ""Okay, well, let me know when you're ready to shoot!""  Keep in mind, after a year had passed, I was no longer as young in my career, had advanced quite a bit and upped my rates a lot. But hey, I agreed to the project at a certain rate, so I was willing to go through with it.  About six months later, they call me up, tell me the production was ready to go (awesome!)-- with someone else instead of me. Okay. So why are they telling me this? Out of professional respect?  Nah. Their someone else couldn't make the first week and they wanted to know if I'd do them the favor of shooting that week (for free, since of course their entire budget was already going to the other guy at a flat rate).  No. Hell no. I got silently fired after sticking with the project, at my same rate, for a year, then asked to come work for free? No way. ""Sorry, I can't afford to do this project without compensation.""  And that was that.  Until six weeks later, when their ""other guy"" dropped out (wonder why), and they asked me to come back.  This time, when they asked if I'd be interested, I said sure-- and quoted them double what my current rate was, which was something like 10x the rate we had originally, way back when, agreed to.  Never heard from them again.  Point being, even after all that, I was still willing to work with them, provided they meet my outrageous quote. Almost every time, the person is going to say hell no and move on.  And in the rare event they say yes, you may have a shitty job but you are making bank.  Just figure out, honestly, what your number is for putting up with these people, quote it to them, and they'll take it or leave it. Either way you get what you want."

freelance,397ahp,sonofaresiii,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:30:50 2015 UTC,Sounds like that's the most common way of doing it - what if they mention the ridiculous rate to others and deter many potential clients?
freelance,397ahp,sonofaresiii,2,Wed Jun 10 08:00:56 2015 UTC,"Eh. I guess that could be some concern if you rely heavily on non-clients referring others to you, but remember that the price is meant to not just be so absurd it gets them to leave-- it's supposed to be a real number that you would accept to work with this client. That means don't just say $100k/day-- you might as well just say fuck off. But maybe 1.5x or 2x your regular rate, or 3x if you really hate the client.  In other words, it scales with how bad the client is. If it's a slightly bad client, the rates will only be slightly higher.  But in my example, they were terrible clients so it was a much higher quote. Personally, I wouldn't want anyone who would ask these people for a recommendation to bother contacting me for much less.  And most importantly of all-- I've never had a potential client actually give hard numbers about my rates to other potential clients. (I'm basing this off the fact that any time I've gotten a recommendation from a client, the new party doesn't know what my rate is)  The other thing I didn't mention is, I'm assuming this is for bad clients. If instead it's just for a specific project you don't want to work on, I'd just say I don't feel I'm the best fit for the project but I hope we can work together in the future."

You can run a regional facebook ad campaing for relatively cheap, ~$600 on the low end.   Also what is the end goal in mind? Do they want an increase in sales? Do they want end users to sign up for their email blasts? What is the goal of all this social media marketing? Blogs require a lot of content/maintenance to be engaging and useful.

Another thing to consider trying is to let the client know that you will be billing them at a 1/3rd rate (so about $8.33/hr) for every hour that you have to sit around waiting for them to respond.

freelance,391lja,Chriswrighto,5,Tue Jun 9 04:27:32 2015 UTC,I know you already said word of mouth but I just want to clarify this to mean past projects as either a freelancer or a full time employee. Leads from when I used to be a full time employee have probably accounted for about 25% of my freelancing revenue.  Aside from that I also get a lot of leads from other freelancers. Some of which were former coworkers and others whom I met on new freelance projects. Good freelancers to keep in your network are the ones who are on the cusp of switching to products full time. Those are good contacts since they'll be wanting to offload their current clients and future leads.  Another source of leads is other freelancing firms. You may have to subcontract for them at first but as they start to work focus on their own niche (or if a project is too small for them) they'll look to past subs as people to pass on work to. I know the hesitation with firms/agencies is the non compete agreement. This hasn't been an issue in my case as I've found that the agencies who value their client's success are always willing to waive a non compete. Especially if it's in their client's best interest (i.e. they just couldn't afford the agency's rates). This has happened to me a handful of times.  The final source of leads for me has been attending meet ups and conferences. Usually they're just a great way to expand your network but you never know what will turn into a lead. I've found great success when volunteering to give a presentation or to teach a seminar for both meet ups and conferences.  Hope that helps!

NOTE: in order to meet with the rules in this subreddit none of these are affiliate links.   Harvest - When I used to bill hourly this is what I used to use for time tracking. It has a timer on the web app and iOS app for tracking hours. I also use it for billing weekly, for annual service contracts, project invoices, as well as tracking client expenses when I travel. Free 30-day trial, then $12/month afterwards Dropbox - I use this to track files across multiple machines. I also use it as a passive backup system since Dropbox saves a history of all deleted and earlier versions of files for 30 days. Plus if the client needs a file quickly from me that is too big to send via email I'll just throw it up on dropbox and send them a download link. Free. If you need more storage space you can get some via getting your friends to sign up or to pay $15/month for the business level. Draft - This is what I use for collaborative writing. My workflow usually involves finishing an article and then sending it to a couple people for a review. This web app makes the merging of those reviews super simple. Free Dwolla - If a client wants to send me money electronically instead of buy mail then this is my default. They used to only take $0.25 per sale which is a lot cheaper than a service like Paypal (2.9% + $0.30 per sale). The biggest problem is they have a transfer period that is sort of like escrow which can be a pain. Honestly it's been a while since I used them so their payment terms might have changed.   The following are nice to haves but are in no way necessary for writing or running your business. A lot of these are things I got after my first 3 months of freelancing.   Google Apps - Honestly the only benefit of this is having an email with a custom domain. (i.e. anzianocp@mybusinessname.com). If that isn't necessary then you could easily get away with a free gmail account.  $5/user per month DNSimple - Speaking of custom domains, this honestly makes buying and managing domains crazy simple. So simple in fact that you'll find yourself with more domains than you need. $5/month plus the costs to buy and renew domains. WP Engine - this is the most expensive thing in my toolset. It's what I use for hosting my sites (business and personal). There are a ton of cheaper options available but I just don't have time to manage WordPress updates and the rest of the overhead involved with running a Wordpress site. $29/month CloudFlare - Use this in conjunction with WP Engine purely for the ability to provide my sites with SSL. Slack - A lot of times I work with a team so we use slack to communicate and often give the option to join the slack if they don't mind looking behind the curtain. Free Gumroad - Since you're a writer this is a great tool for self publishing. If you have content you'd like to sell simply generate a PDF and you can start selling it through gumroad. They take a 5% + $0.25 processing fee of every sale you make.   Oops. Looks like my kids woke up from their nap so the following are the rest of the tools I use in no particular order:  Buffer, ConvertKit (used to use MailChimp), ReceiptBank, Cloak, Amazon Web Services, Uber, VirtualPostMail, Spotify, The Noun Project, Github, AdobeSystems (Photoshop), VMWare, ZenPayroll, Xero, Trello."

You're making your job harder.   Think to yourself, ""Is this really necessary?""  Why use a web app like Draft to send text back and forth, for example? You already have e-mail.  Why use dropbox if you are a web developer? Just make a new page on your portfolio site and give them the link.  Why put a middleman web app in the way, surrounded by other's advertising and call-to-actions? Throw away opportunities, or your clients and collaborators get a custom page within seconds?  ""Wow!"", right?   I know!  Most people will give you good-natured advice. This will rarely overlap with good advice.  You want good advice?

I know for certain that the amount of bloat and mindfulness I would need to spend energy on reminding myself to check when I am going out to lunch or trying to remember when I went out to lunch would be a lot harder than toggl automatically noting when I went idle and asking me how it should handle that idle time (add it to the previous entry, make a new entry, or just get rid of it).  How many times have you retroactively annotated your hours?  I don't want to have to think about that ever.  toggl runs as a standalone app.  It reminds me to start tracking if I'm not.  There is not benefit to using manual notes that I that think of.  Manual notes might be faster for you but I am very happy alt tabbing to toggle, and clicking on a previous project/client session to start a new session for that project/client.

This is a sales problem   I keep sending out proposals   Do you like getting unsolicited proposals telling you how to run your shit? Didn't think so. Creating a proposal comes way later.   going through UpWork (oDesk)   That's not working...how surprising...   emailing companies and organisations I'd love to work with.    Correct! But...   I've had some responses, but most of these were exchanges of a couple of messages and after me telling them my hourly rate or quoting a project I receive no further responses.   Ok, let's troubleshoot. If you're getting the wrong answers, you're probably asking the wrong questions.   I'm in the area of web design and development.   You and a million others. What can you do that helps the client's business? In other words, what value do you provide? When you're pitching, do you say something like, ""hey, your site sucks and makes your business look bad; give me a large sack of cash, and I'll make it pretty? Look at my portfolio."" Or, do you say something like, ""is your site an expense or a source of revenue? Is it making as much as you want it to?"" Do you have an answer if they say they're perfectly happy?  Forgive me if you're already doing this, but in short, are you focusing on the client's issues? As soon as you say, ""my rate is $X,"" even if the client asks early on, you've made it all about you. When a person does this too early, I'm immediately put off. I can't help but think they don't really care about my business and that all they see is dollar signs."

I've always had it in my mind that I have to know a lot of cool fancy tech and this is what potential clients want. I believe I unwillingly picked this ""strategy"" up at university. I also think this is what a lot of other web developers struggle with, the realisation that the tools they work with don't matter as long as the end result provides value.  Given the points that you've made, what would you say would be the ideal service advertisement that I could put up? What would be worth mentioning that would appeal to the masses? My educated guess here would be to try and explain what is it that I do and why would it be important to them, eg. providing UX tweaks, speeding up their application, how these things save/produce money and such?"
freelance,38ymdq,jaf656s,2,Mon Jun 8 12:05:14 2015 UTC,"What would be worth mentioning that would appeal to the masses?   Why are you targeting ""the masses""? You don't need that many clients to run a successful business, so you can get very, very specific in what you offer to do and who you offer to help.  It would help to focus on the client first:    Which clients can you provide the most value for? Why do they need the value you provide? How would you determine if a client is a good candidate for your help?   Using these 3 points, you should be able to figure out who to contact and how to approach them for your services."

The odds of someone finding your message let alone responding to it are very small.   You mentioned appealing to the masses? What masses? You're not Johnson and Johnson who has $10 million to advertise a new soap! Sorry, but you can't just assume clients need the same thing, specifically in your field. Your field is literally all about customization!   On your site, you can try to anticipate your client's needs. This helps if you specialize in solving a specific set of problems. If you are trying to drive traffic, I'm sure you already know the value of landing pages.   However, IMHO, a personal site is merely a point of reference for prospects unless you're actually selling a product or standardized service. That is, someone visits it through a referral or business card, or because you've already made contact with a prospect. However, I'm sure people have differing opinions, and I'm not an expert on this.   Thus, you really need to hammer down what you can do. This can only really be done by actually talking to people and listening to their problems. Again, people are obsessed with cost, so don't let them worry about that until THEY have established your value."
freelance,38ymdq,Chriswrighto,6,Mon Jun 8 17:47:57 2015 UTC,"Here's the simple mind-set change ALL freelancers need to make... Switch from ""How can I get new clients?"" to ""How can I bring HUGE value to new (and existing) clients?""    It's that simple.    Once you realize that every business receives a ton of sales-talk every day, its easy to stand out.  Just be that one guy who wants to HELP and not sell them.  I'll give you an example...    The way I pick up new clients is by giving them IDEAS.  Ideas that can be potentially worth millions -- and at the bare minimum, my ideas are worth tens of thousands of dollars.  (And that's not me ""hyping"" anything up.  I'm a direct-response copywriter.  A good idea in this industry really can be worth that much.  In fact, one of the most successful promotions (written by Martin Conroy) for the Wall Street Journal pulled an estimated $2 billion in revenue.)  Let's say you're a web-designer and you come across a website which requires the customer to take 3 steps before they make the purchase.  Could you make this a 2-step process instead?  If so, that could be worth a HUGE amount to the client.  And mega-companies like Amazon know it -- they've got a patent for their 'one-click' purchase option.   So tell me, what can you do for the clients?   And a relevant picture:  https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/8a/20/d1/8a20d197043abdde1903686b105d2002.jpg"

freelance,38ymdq,tiptoeingtrees,3,Mon Jun 8 11:29:05 2015 UTC,"Try to get on a call before offering rates. Make the client feel like you truly understand what they need. For many people, web design and development is a very foreign, very expensive area and they're terrified they're about to be ripped off — imagine yourself trying to negotiate with a clothing manufacturer in China, or an olive oil producer in Italy — so you have to make it very, very clear that you not only understand their needs, but that you're honest, trustworthy, and dependable.   All of this is easier on the phone. Just ask questions and repeat back what they've asked for, along with ideas for solving the problem.   Show understanding and a path to a solution. Don't push toward talking money. Explain how the solution will pay for itself. Pretend you're selling to a very close friend and give the client the same kind of honesty and candor.   If you've done this properly, the price is a secondary consideration and more of a formality than a deciding factor.   Good luck!"

freelance,38y5vp,The-Respawner,13,Sun Jun 7 21:06:54 2015 UTC,"My general best tips? Top 7, coming in hot.  tl;dr - you're not ready to start a firm.   Take yourself seriously. If you don't, no one else will. Drop the ironic detachment and stop calling yourself a ""firm"". Act like professional designers and take ownership of the work you do. 'It's better than nothing' is gonna leave you with almost nothing. Never say those words again. How much should you charge? Wrong question. If you don't have a firm grasp of the minimum you'll need to stay afloat, and you have no idea what your services are worth in the market you're selling to, you don't have a business. Simple as that. You're providing a service that companies buy. Your clients will have projects with budgets. Target your efforts towards companies that allocate money for the things you provide. The best way to get customers is to sell to people who aren't customers. That's literally the only way to get new customers. It seems like you think ""sell"" a dirty word since your approach is to ask if prospective customers ""need help"" with a new logo. If you're a consultative professional who's good at what he does, your clients will thank you for helping them make a smart business decision. This venture is a bad idea; two friends, zero business savvy. Freelance independently and collaborate on projects whenever you want, but both of you need to get jobs with established firms and learn how your industry operates.  That last line made me want to punch you in the face - slå deg i ansiktet, I had Google help me out because I wanted to make sure you understood. Your face. I want to punch it.

freelance,38y5vp,somethingwonderfuls,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:26:21 2015 UTC,"I'll answer your seven tips, in order:    I do take myself seriosuly. I wrote ""firm"" because I am not completely sure what I should call it in english, as we are not a big firm, just two guys wanting to do graphic design together.  That's true, but freelancing would not be my full-time job, it would be something I did outside of my full-time job. And my point was that I don't except to make a ton of money, as this would be a sidejob. Not only to make money, but also to practice my design-skills for a bigger design-job eventually.  Again, I DO have a grasp minimum idea of what I need to stay afloat, but I am not planning to have this freelance job as a full time job. I want to know what is a good price that won't scare customers off, as I obviously is not working in a well established firm that is well known for their good products and design.  So I should basically ask them what their budget is for ads, logos etc is?  Again my lackluster english gave you the wrong impression of what I was trying to say. So what you are saying is that basically I should ask people if they want a new logo, not if they want any ""help"" with a new logo? Because that is what I have been doing, I'm just scared if it may seem unprofessional.  We both have jobs withing established firms, just not withing graphics design. Both of us are working right now to save up money to go to a graphic design school, which may help us get a ""real"", not freelance, graphic design job in the future.  Just curious, how is excusing my bad english disrespecting the people who read my post?"
freelance,38y5vp,crispadvisor,2,Mon Jun 8 16:12:17 2015 UTC,"I think there are a lot of good points being made by others here - from your original post I would have assumed you were trained graphic designers, possibly already working in that field and deciding to strike out on your own. However if you were, you would know how much to charge and how the industry works.  I would say that whilst you shouldn't give up, you should be aware of your limitations - one of them is that you are going to be competing against experienced and qualified designers. You really need to know what you are doing from the outset.  If you do a graphic design job for someone and do a bad job, it is your reputations on the line.  I would advise trying to learn a lot more, work for companies or apprentice or shadow someone with a lot of experience, do free online courses, get as much knowledge and advice and experience as you can first. Your reputations are valuable so don't squander them by trying to guess how to run a graphic design business.  The fact is that if you're not good enough to get a job doing it for someone else, you're not good enough to strike out on your own. You need to do some learning first. That said, there is a lot of good news too! I hire graphic designers all the time so I can tell you that good graphic designers are always in demand and always get work, they can earn really good money. I always go back to the same designers, once I find a good one. If they are all busy I'm really stuck because I've worked with a lot of others who were terrible and found that good designers are like gold dust.  It doesn't take a long time to learn, but it takes hard work and dedication, and a good eye. You have to be thick skinned and good at taking feedback. If you invest a few years of really trying, working, learning, finding out what you are good at within graphic design (if you are a small company you really have to specialise in something, whether it's designing print for restaurants or social media skins, or book covers, or typographic design style, or illustration) you will make more money and progress than if you begin 'on the back foot'.  If you put the work in and learn, you will soon understand why you need to learn more before you set up your own business.   It's like being a hairdresser, if you just go with no experience and cut someone's hair badly, they will be really upset and it will be very hard to get someone to hire you again.  If you're not feeling sure enough to make your own logo, you're not ready to do a good job for someone else.  But you can learn quickly and earn money as you go.  When you get to the point of setting up on your own, a good solo graphic designer might earn £20 an hour, but they need to be really fast and good at interpreting briefs and understanding what people want. A good graphic designer might make £100-200 per day or get a 6 month contract/project for £3000, but having a full slate of projects requires you to have a good reputation.  You will be relying on a small number of clients hiring you over and over again so that is why your reputation is so important. If you are spending a lot of time trying to find new clients all the time, your business won't work. Anyway, give this some thought. Go to graphic design school and until you can get there, spend a few hours every night doing online courses in Adobe packages - that is a great investment in your future."

Thats one of the reasons we will try to get semi-big customers, nothing really huge, as they probably do not have a high enough budget to ""buy"" (not sure of the correct english term) the really well known, but really expensive graphic designers. Thats why we want to be known as good graphic designers for a cheap price. Not great graphics designers, we will not design webpages or stuff for huge companies, but good, more than good enough for most customers. My point is, we are not going to try competing against the biggest graphic design firms there is in our area.    It doesn't take a long time to learn, but it takes hard work and dedication, and a good eye. You have to be thick skinned and good at taking feedback. If you invest a few years of really trying, working, learning, finding out what you are good at within graphic design (if you are a small company you really have to specialise in something, whether it's designing print for restaurants or social media skins, or book covers, or typographic design style, or illustration) you will make more money and progress than if you begin 'on the back foot'.   Yeah specializing is probably a good idea.    If you're not feeling sure enough to make your own logo, you're not ready to do a good job for someone else.   Oh I am for sure comfortable making my own logo, don't misunderstand. But you know, when you are doing graphic design, you want your own logo to be absolutely perfect. It should be like the icing on the cake, showing how good you are. Thats what makes it hard. I literally have like 50 different version of the logo we may want to use, and I am never able to decide which one I want.   This is the current one, it's not finished though (I can already see what I want to improve): http://prntscr.com/7emkaw  We are going to call ourself 8 Layers. 8 as in the infinity symbol, but it really isn't THAT important that customers get that link, that would just be a bonus. The biggest problem would make the logo somehow have 8 layers, without looking messy."

A contract is a contract, as I understand the term.  The web version has been delivered since January. Android version published in March. Has the client paid for the work that has been delivered so far?  So now, client is suggesting that they shouldn't pay for the remaining development cost which is still about 40-50% of the whole dev cost.  Are they suggesting that you do the remaining work for free?  Because if so, that's obviously something you should reject outright.   If you delivered a working app and they paid you up-to-date, then you're even.  If not, your position gets a bit fuzzier.  Either way, you can't force a client to continue a project.  If you have no contract, you have no leverage.  Even with a contract, unless there are kill fees written into the deal, you have no leverage.  Your time with this client is done.  If they owe you money, collect it.  Do not deliver any source code until they pay for it, and only deliver what they pay for.  Start looking for your next project, this one is over."

I've learned to state in my contracts that I can't be held responsible if deadlines are missed due to the client being late on something - whether it's supplying materials or signing off on a version or anything like that.

Thought it would cause riots; so far no complaints.)  There's a company line that they can call in an emergency, but very few people feel enough urgency to actually call.   Be very clear with expectations and then enforce them.   (Side note: if you handle emails late, like I sometimes do, use something like Boomerang to schedule them to go out during business hours. You can violate your own time all you want, but don't give your client the impression that you're available at 2am by sending an email at 2am.)"

freelance,38o4ia,Mixitwiththerelish,30,Fri Jun 5 13:58:50 2015 UTC,"From my perspective - in any creative venture, you're only as good as the person hiring you plus a small percentage. Meaning, people can only perceive quality to a certain level. Past that point, they're dependent on others, or on your ability to sell yourself. Take art. I can look at two good pictures and not see much difference. My husband (artist) will see all sorts of things I don't and pinpoint which artist is good and which artist is fantastic. On the other hand, once writing surpasses a certain quality point, he can no longer perceive the differences the way I can.  I think the majority of people doing the hiring are not necessarily expert level. But they also aren't idiots generally speaking. So I think talent/skill is important in that there is a certain threshold you have to cross, but I think that bar is lower than a lot of people realize, and once you're past that point it's all about the marketing and the business sense."

Doubtlessly a Philistine masquerading as a patrician! Grape juice would better quench his thirst than the finest Cabernet.   However, based on your expertise garnered through the trials and tribulations of a myriad of wines, you know the perfect wine for him. You say, ""here good sir; I believe you will find this particular wine to your satisfaction.""   The gentleman purchases the $1000 wine. He returns the subsequent day to report he and his distinguished dinner guests thoroughly enjoyed the wine and wish to procure and entire case. Who the hell are you to tell him and his pals they have shit taste in wine?   Like wine, the price of creative work ranges immensely; in the end, it's the same product per se. There's lots of other examples: watches, cars, homes, furniture, etc. Sometimes the $1000 item is better than $100 one, sometimes not. However, it's ultimately all about the value the client gets.

You need to understand their business and personal goals and frame your work around improving those.

freelance,38o4ia,_cott0n,2,Tue Jun 9 17:09:52 2015 UTC,"I'd say this really depends on the field you're in. And also what you mean by talent.  In some fields, you only need so much talent or ability to perform the work. With writing, if people are hiring you to do it, chances are more people will. The thing is that I believe that some people have exceptional talent for something - but that is really just a deep understanding for the thing, a passion that drives them, and a commitment to be really amazing at it. All those things can be learned and developed with a positive mindset. I know that sounds all new-agey but it's just true.  To look at your question from a slightly different angle - is there anything to be gained financially from developing your talent? I think there always is. A deep understanding will earn you great respect and you will be in demand, a passion for what you do will be infectious and inspire more people to pay you more money, and a desire to be the best at what you do, in your particular niche, will shine through in your work and push you to be better.  Ultimately you do need to market yourself well and manage your business well, but I think those are just the basics of working for yourself. The distinguishing factor for real growth and success is continuing to actively seek ways to grow, learn, improve and become better at what you do.  I feel like that all sounded really cheesy but what it comes down to is someone with no innate talent could quickly overtake someone with 7 years experience if they choose to keep on learning and growing whilst the more experienced person stays on the same level."

The thing is, if you are actually good ad toing the job, but bad at marketing?  you really can only take customers who know 'good' when they see it, and you need to work in a medium where you can carry that portfolio (or other evidence of you being 'good' )  There are customers (and we are all this kind of customer in one area or another)  who don't know enough to tell if the work you do is good or not.    In that case, actually being good is much less of an advantage;  you need to be able to convince those people you are good through marketing, contacts, etc...   then you need to perform the work to minimum standards.     No matter what, you are going to need some minimal level of actual skill at the job, and some minimal level of marketing and business acumen.

freelance,38nygm,Chriswrighto,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:27:12 2015 UTC,"I agree -- it's SO important you get out there and find clients.  But so many freelancers don't. Why?  They're scared of being rejected.  And it's KILLING their business. But one thing I will say... the people at the TOP of the industry, hardly need to work for leads.  They've positioned themselves, through years of talent and work, as the ""go to"" people.  They've written blogs, books, established themselves as the experts.  And it's now paying dividends for them.  Just a thought."

I am a freelance game programmer, so I can't start emailing random local businesses like some web devs are doing, which is the usual advice.  My dream client so far, whom I work for a lot, is one that told me he felt I was charging too little for all the work I am doing and wanted me to charge more to make sure I am happy and have enough money. He works for a media agency that basically finds clients and does artwork, while outsourcing some of the programming. I have made educational games and branded advertising games so far.  I found him by replying to a job on a site similar to Elance. I have no idea where I would go about looking for clients like that."

Are there other companies like that one? Can target those guys.  Biggest thing to understand is what ""problem"" are you solving for him? If they have too many projects to do themselves (and he's outsourcing the grunt work to someone like you) then you just need to find other dev companies that have too much work to handle.  Obviously that requires you to have your ear to the ground but given that you work in the industry I'm sure you are both interested and able to keep tabs on which companies might need extra help.  If you give more information here I'll be able to give you more advice as right now it's a bit limited."

You just mentioned best ways to get clients and dismissed them. Referrals are by far the best way to earn clients, partnerships second, organic traffic third. Getting clients to come to you is the holy grail.   If you're contacting clients directly, you're essentially asking them to adjust their business priorities for you, which is a much more difficult sell than earning clients who have already a) had internal meetings and decided they have a need for the service you provide and b) have already allocated a budget for the current period.   Most freelancers and agencies actually do the opposite of what you're suggesting. They begin by contacting clients directly and then graduate to getting clients to come to them.    As for the agency, what are they doing now? Competing for jobs on Elance.....and we all know how that ends.   What professional agency is competing for jobs on Elance?"

My point is this - relying on these things is dangerous. You want to have as many client getting mechanisms in place as possible to avoid relying on one too much.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't be going for referrals or other things - you should. But you must use every tool at your disposal.  And directly contacting prospects is one of them.  No-one said it was easy to get clients this way but it works. It requires a strategy and sales skills that I'll probably put a post up about when I have a bit more time.

What is MY target salary? What are MY expenses? How many hours do I want to work in the year?  And as some of the other commenters suggested this is really good advice for starting out. But the freelancers who are able to charge much higher rates shift to a ""you"" (as in the client) mentality.  What are YOUR pains? How are YOU wasting money? How can we get YOU to success as quickly as possible? What is YOUR budget?  And once they make this transition it makes for a more compelling sale of your services because the discussion becomes ""how can I help you?"" rather than ""how much you can pay me?"""
freelance,38k25i,ryan_castillo,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:24:40 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting tool, but I think the idea that you should figure out what to charge based on this information is looking at things from the wrong direction. Your hourly rate is driven by the market and your competition. It can be a challenge determining what the number should be, but the important considerations include: - What is the rate of consultants / employees in my local market doing what I do (or close to what I do)? - What competitive advantage do I offer? (What disatvantage?) - What is the overall demand for this work? How easy or difficult is it to pick up other customers?  Approaching this from the perspective of ""I want to make X dollars"" is a limiting way of looking at the picture. Instead it is better to try to maximize the value of your work and provide a unique and valuable service which will allow for higher rates. We all have a minimum threshold, but hopefully if you do it right you are going to be way above that number by adopting the right strategy.  For me I tend to like to think of the overall pay as a pleasant surprise and reward for doing all the other things right and having the right strategy to maximize opportunities and income."

Seems like a bad client, but I think your best bet is to make sure you have a down payment for start of work (not a ""deposit"") going forward.   Just keep in mind that if you continue working with them, they're probably going to burn you again. This isn't a ""mistake"" they made, it's a clear look into how they value your services and do business."

freelance,38jvd4,wombatjuggernaut,6,Thu Jun 4 19:28:13 2015 UTC,"A down payment is the first payment they are making for the hours you are going to start putting on the project.  A deposit is an amount of money to secure your time to work and for them to show their interest in starting the project.   Generally, a deposit is seen as something the buyer can get refunded if they decide against the project at a later date (even after you've started work), whereas a down payment is them pre-paying you for the work that you're starting.  IANAL but I'm under the impression that a deposit will be easier for them to get refunded if they decide they don't want to pay you for the work you've done."

Every contract that I can recall though explicitly calls it a non-refundable deposit (working in web).  I'd say go with either one, just make sure you call it non refundable and your contract outlines that you get paid no matter what (unless you don't deliver, and not in a way that the client caused such as refusing to provide assets)."

If you're smaller you can definitely pull this off with cheaper legal on less hours, but don't try to do this yourself unless you're dealing with small amounts (in which case you're just putting it in there for psychological reasons, don't expect it to get far if it ever needs to be enforced), I'm just sharing what I'm used to seeing from both our contract, other creative agencies and big companies that have pre-written contracts (that are typically edited case by case) for service providers.

For a single person who doesn't have that budget and is less financially secure in case of losing a single projects cost, it makes more sense to have a more resistant down payment.

freelance,38jvd4,Matt0864,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:26:14 2015 UTC,It applies both ways though. As long as there is a deposit in your account the legal costs on their side to get it back (if there is some hole in the contract) also outweighs the amount of the actual deposit.

Since you don't trust them, you shouldn't worry about upsetting this client anyway unless you absolutely need their business. They burned YOU.  First thing you can do is send copies of your invoice to other people at the company you may have worked with, such as HR, accounting, etc. Sometimes those people will urge bosses to deal with issues like this, warn them of the risks so that company can put it behind them.   You can also call daily first thing in the morning for a status update on your past due invoice. Not just your contact, but others as well. It's not harassment if they owe you money and you are polite.  You can also contact a lawyer, pay them a few bucks to write a letter threatening legal action if the invoice is not paid. Even if you don't intend to go to court, making them believe you will be a headache until the invoice is paid can help you here.  I would have done this all before offering a cut rate 40% kill fee like you did, so you can show up in person if possible and try to appeal to them and your relationship with a reasonable offer like that.

Their lawyer will (ideally) tell them they are idiots and should pay you as soon as he gets the demand letter with a copy of the contract and/or email correspondence saying ""Yep, make this happen.""  If that's not the case, you should find work elsewhere because they're idiots who don't know how to do business.  Their revenue is how many multiples of your annual revenue from them?  It's just not worth spending the money to go to court over $1,600 and they or their lawyer likely know that.  It will cost you $200 max to have a lawyer write the letter from hell.  It's not even the content, it's the lawyer letterhead that sends a message ""I will sue you for money you agreed to pay me, and that suit will cost you far more than just paying me in the first place."""
freelance,38jvd4,marketinginbound,6,Fri Jun 5 03:56:19 2015 UTC,"Well, threaten court first, even if you really have no intention of following though. I don't know what your income is but $1600 is definitely worth pursuing if you're ok cutting ties imo. I would, they're just going to do it again especially if you've demonstrated any contract they sign is merely theatrics. But maybe the steady income is worth it.  If they're large enough to have departments or other employees (such as HR or accounting), go straight to them and indicate you would like to be paid, providing documentation. Don't act like you're tattling or making a stink, a serious and gentle demeanour will show that you really should have been paid the first time and there must have been an error or miscommunication.

If you need a carbon copy, isolated instance of their current environment and data it's justifiable, but if it's just a sandbox for general development work  which you'd be expected to have (I had a vBulletin board tucked away for this at one point) you can't really charge them for the instance."

But the good news is that discipline is something you can GROW. :) Here's what you need to do...   1. Take apart your current project.  Break it down into the separate parts you need to work on.   2. Pull out a calendar and set days for when you're going to work on them. Side note:  Put the most creative and mind-intensive in the time slots where you KNOW you work best.   3. Start to set a time where you wake up, every day WITHOUT exceptions.  For me its 6AM, I rarely snooze, and I'm working by 6.15.   4. Start freaking rewarding yourself... YOU DON'T NEED TO WORK 9-5. We're freelancers dammit! If you can wake up early, get your work done for the day and be done by lunch, TAKE THE REST OF THE DAY OFF!  Or better yet, continue working on your business to pull in new work.   6. Keep working at this list.  You won't hear a 'click' and suddenly be super-freelancer.  It takes time -- not too long though -- before you can change your old habits.   7. Everything Ticman said, that's gold.      Enjoy, hollyhooooooooo.    Edit: formatting."

freelance,38g723,Tabian,2,Thu Jun 11 20:53:39 2015 UTC,"A guest I interviewed used a combination of Pomodoro Technique, and creating quotas for how long he is allowed to work on something.   Pomodoro is that whole system where you work for 25 minutes, take a 5 minute break. But what makes it so effective is he sets a quota on how many Pomodoros he needs to do in a day, and he sets a quota on how many Pomodoros a task is allowed to take (to avoid dragging tasks on to fill an infinite stretch of time).  I'm experimenting with this right now and while I want to wait a couple months to see if it sticks, it's surprisingly effective.   Notice how all of this is completely divorced from any concept of sitting in a chair working 9-5. If you decide to do 8 pomodoros in a day (which is a lot, this is focused work not screwing around in a cubicle), then once you hit that quota, you are done. That can be at 1pm or 8pm, it's up to you."

I decided to go with $10 and have the ads spread out over the course of a single day (using Google's daily budgeting). If I can get a 1% CTR I'll be happy from this experiment.

Online advertising is one of the cheapest forms of paid advertising on the planet--and has the biggest reach. If you are going to advertise, what are your alternatives? TV? Radio? Print? How many thousands of dollars does it cost to run those ads? And can you track impressions? How do you measure feedback?  PPC advertising is about:  -Understanding keywords -Understanding search volumes -Understanding ad copy -Understanding landing pages -Having a big enough budget that allows for some trial and error -Having a big enough budget that allows for a big enough pool of clicks  If you don't understand the above mentioned aspects of your campaign then of course it's going to be a miss. If you don't have enough money to send your campaign to a big pool then of course it's going to be a miss.  Too many inexperienced wanna-be ""advertisers"" take to PPC thinking they're going to strike gold whilst not having any idea WTF they're doing. On top of that they think it's going to be relatively ""free"" in comparison to other advertising methods.   Hands down--in comparison to placing a print ad in a magazine--you will most likely get a lot better results from PPC.  I've done all of them. I know people who decided to spend $16,000 to advertise their business in magazines and got NO response with good advertisements. Do you know how many clicks you could get for $16,000 regardless of the industry? I mean F!   Haha... sorry... I am starting to rant. My point is... think about the possibilities.

In another instance, he may mean no harm, but working with this money difference could accidentally screw you up with taxes and any possible legal complications. If sponsor reports they paid you $5000 and the check went through, but you only report being paid $850, it may cause unforeseen issues in the future.  I'd stick firm with ripping the check.

freelance,38c3i7,twelvis,11,Wed Jun 3 06:52:23 2015 UTC,"I've spent a good part of a year focusing on automation and streamlining of my business. Let me share...   Email -- TURN IT OFF!  Give yourself one or two 30 minute slots to check your email every day.  But don't leave it on all day long... it's a distraction.  Especially if you're in the 'zone' of producing.  And yes, your clients CAN wait.  (In fact, not replying instantly increases their perception of your value... but that's for another day.) Find your productive time.  Most of us have a time in the day when we're super productive.  Mine is between 6 AM and 12 PM.  So I fit my most important, creativity focused work in there. Client calls, emails, research can all come later in the hours where I'm not so ""on"".  And the hours of 12-2 are a NO-GO for me.  I can't focus on anything.  So what do I do?  I go to the gym and do tasks like food shopping and washing.  Pomodoro technique... basically work for 33 minutes on, 10 minutes off.  This strategy helps me on days I really can't focus.  I just switch on a timer and put in 33 minutes of work, before taking 10 minutes off to walk around, get coffee, whatever else. Know your sleep cycle.  This might sound loony, but it's helped me so much.  You know those days your head just feels heavy and you can't focus as well as you'd like?  You likely had a really DEEP sleep.  We sleep in cycles, light, REM and deep.  Too much deep and my head feels heavy, and focusing is harder.  Too light and it's game over.  Get some REM in there... and it's a good day.  I used an app called ""Sleep for Android"" to monitor my cycles.  I recommend it. Setting a to-do list of only the MOST important stuff.  You've got to think to yourself... ""What's the most important 1-3 things I could do today, that are going to move my business forward?""  It might be working on your client project, looking for new leads, or following-up with a client.  It's almost never checking your email and writing invoices -- they can wait.  Eating right.  SO IMPORTANT.  Stop eating rubbish.  Eat REAL food.  And find what works for you.  I personally 'work' better when I eat more fats and proteins and less carbohydrates. And now a ""technical"" one... Docusign.  It gives you a way to manage your contracts online, and it's pretty cheap to.  Last I checked it was around $20/month.   That's all for now folks. :)"

This means I'm not checking my email all day long (no email notifications for me, otherwise).   2) I use tons of macros in Excel to get what I need, fast.  3) I use Outlook templates and Gmail canned responses for common inquiries that come in.  4) I use Workflowy and Todoist for checklists and reminders. (Occasionally I use Trello too.)  5) In general, I complete tasks ""assembly line"" style, i.e., if I have a bunch of small tasks to complete, I knock them out by category... I pre-plan so I can do similar tasks one after another so I'm not switching gears too much (in my mind, or physically/spacially).  6) I clock myself in and out using a simple Google spreadsheet when working for clients. This keeps me on task because my time is designated.  7) I compile all the info I need into one window on my screen, even if I have to organize it a tiny bit first. Often this just means data dumping or pasting values into a Notepad document so that I'm not clicking around my screen to minimize/maximize different windows, emails, documents, whatever it may be. I did this in college when writing research papers too. Just typed everything up in one place -- all the info I could ever need -- so that I wasn't looking up things in this book, then that book.

freelance,387xpe,seerven,22,Tue Jun 2 14:20:48 2015 UTC,"A couple tips, regardless of the client or project.   Never blame the client's lack of brief. You need to ask the right questions to make sure you understand what the project requires. If you're not doing this, you're not doing your job. Have some sort of contract. It doesn't have to be 20 pages, but at the very least, send them a quote/initial invoice that outlines what they're paying for. Either up to x amount of hours, or exactly how many screens, concepts, revisions, final deliverables, etc. Anything outside of this is to be quoted on/charged per hour/charged at a flat rate. Get a deposit, every single time. No excuses! If they can't pay 25%-50% upfront, that's a huge red flag. Obviously if the project is huge, break it up into milestones. 25% to start, 25% at a specific point, another 25% at this point, and the final 25% before delivering the files. This way, if they still bail, you've been compensated fairly to a certain point."
freelance,387xpe,brettlair,5,Tue Jun 2 15:56:12 2015 UTC,This is great advice.  Ultimately any failure or frustration with a client is your own fault.

freelance,387xpe,codevil,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:59:23 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add:  Regarding the contract, some clients would like to draft out their own contracts for you to sign. Read it very carefully and make sure it keeps you protected as well. If you're not happy, let them know what clauses you want added."
freelance,387xpe,Ginfly,12,Fri Jun 5 04:36:35 2015 UTC,"If you're confident in your abilities, charge more. Bigger price = better clients on average. If you don't have great examples, take some time to create mockups.  Not to be mean at all, but make sure your grammar and spelling are perfect. Take your time crafting emails, put together a questionnaire form on typeform.com for clients to fill out so there is no information missing (have some required fields).  Better clients expect better communication.  Bill a flat cost unless you have a large, trustworthy client or a monthly retainer. Require half down before starting work, and agree in writing to everything that's included, with prices for additional work."

freelance,387xpe,chance--,7,Tue Jun 2 19:16:29 2015 UTC,"I have more 'bad client' experiences than I'll ever share. It wasn't until I heard my favorite quote from any TV show that I realized it was on me: ""If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole."" - Justified, Raylan Givens  It seems that your problem is similar to what I was encountering. You're probably expecting too much from them. They are going to try and take as much as they can get for the lowest price possible. While it's changing, a lot of people still see what we do as voodoo and have no idea what to expect. On the flipside, some believe that it's as easy as pushing a few buttons and dragging some things around on a screen. They can not feel or touch what we create so there's no affirmation of a tangible return on their investment.  You need to lock down your on-boarding process. If you're going to do fixed bids, which at your current price points seems fair, then you need to explicitly define what is included. The price should be supported with the number of revisions, artifacts, and responsibilities that you're committing to. An equally explicit declaration of what constitutes as billable work above and beyond that scope should also be part of your agreement.  Don't just hand them a contract with this in it though because they'll either forgo reading it or just assume that things like ""make the logo bigger,"" ""move this over there,"" and ""now that I've seen it finished, I don't like it"" are all small, insignificant changes and thus should be free. Instead, talk to them about it. Make sure it is part of the conversation you have before you both sign."
freelance,387xpe,chuckquizmo,3,Tue Jun 2 19:40:34 2015 UTC,"Can we see some of your work for reference? Not to be harsh, but if you've had two clients in a row refuse to pay because the work was sub par, maybe it was. Should they have paid you? Yes, absolutely, they hired you and owe you what you earned. It seems like that ship has already sailed though, so make these clients two expensive lessons. Going forward, the best way to avoid this is to manage client expectations. I'd say the easiest way to do this is to lower your price, or take a break from freelancing to hone your skills as a designer. Maybe your designs weren't bad at all, but just not worth what you charged your clients, so either take your prices down to lower expectations of future clients, or take some Lynda courses for a few months and get your product to a $20/hr level. Good luck."

He is right in saying that these should be lessons, but not in improvement or client expectations, but in real world business. You need to focus on formalising contracts and briefs.

freelance,387xpe,b2bsalesguy,4,Tue Jun 2 19:19:29 2015 UTC,"We've all worked for people like that, and while you need the money it's much easier to look closely at the person who's paying you. I noticed that both of your clients that whined about ""taking so long"" were full of it from the get-go. What I started to do was  charge higher rates to clients that didn't have their shit together.  Believe me, you can tell when you start to ask questions getting to know what they really need.  Either they pay a deposit or you set milestones where you do a certain percentage of work and they pay you for the amount done.  Then I tell them in a brief of what I'm going to do and provide weekly progress reports so there's no surprises. Clients love this since it leaves a trail and proves that you're not a flake. If they have to disappear to a ""higher-up"" that wasn't involved in the consultation process for days on end, that's a huge red flag and I end up letting them know. If it's not ironed out within the business day, I fire them and move on to finding better clients.  Once you stop acting like you're expendable, you have more time to sharpen your skills and find better people to work for."

Really you should be pricing for the clients you want. If you don't want the cheaper jobs, refer your friends and bump your rates for the people that will pay. If you want cheap clients, have cheap rates.  The problem with being really good at something is that you can't change your skill to match the rate. So unless you can crank out something of good quality much faster the lower rates aren't worth it if you have other jobs that pay, and even then you should be charging more for doing it so fast haha"

They know you produce top-tier work.  And now it's time your price (and positioning) reflects that.    I don't know your field well enough to say ""double it"" but your price needs to be moving up.

freelance,37zxb3,petersid7,-19,Wed Jun 3 07:03:48 2015 UTC,"So I tried to hire a rails guy about 2 years ago.  I was building an MVP and I tried to hire him because I knew it was something he was interested in.  Basically, I found him by searching for Triathlons and Rails developer and he was one of the few people who came up.  So you could imagine how I felt when he said he would do it for $150 and hour.   I told him it was coming out of my pocket and he wasn't interested in lowering his rates... thats fine its how it goes.  But put yourself in my shoes.  Why should you make $300,000 a year.  The answer is probably that you shouldn't.  Its just that you are in a small pool and the rest of the world hasn't saturated the market to drive your rates down. Your salary is because you are really in demand.  I'm a freelancer too, so I'm not mad at you getting paid, but you need to relate to common man money... which $300k a year certainly isn't... not even in SF.   My advice.  Keep stripping bags of cash off any corporate sponsors who'd like to pay you.  Particularly if its a bank, govt, mega corp type job.  When the little guys come around again, give them a special rate... because you know, sometimes $75 an hour is still a ton of money to a guy paying out of his pocket.  Also, to get back to your original question... every new client you get, keep upping it $10 an hour.  Some will back away, some won't.  Eventually they will all back away...  drop your rate slightly from there, and bobs your uncle."

freelance,37zxb3,petersid7,-8,Mon Jun 1 02:41:54 2015 UTC,"So much hate... Did you read my whole post? I suggested how I get the most money as a freelancer... But I also read between the lines in that it didn't seem like OP thought their rate was justified.  If I read wrong, then my bad.  The point is, make lots of money, but don't make your freelancing about making money.  More money basically never makes people more happy.    If OP didn't have an issue they probably wouldn't have said ""What's been bothering me is that it's so easy to get work"". and then ""When smaller companies contact me, my rates are too high""."
freelance,37zxb3,sonofaresiii,6,Mon Jun 1 04:30:23 2015 UTC,"Charging higher rates doesn't necessarily mean making more money. It might mean having more free time, to do things like vacation or spend time with family.  And that often does make people more happy.  And by the way   they probably wouldn't have said ""What's been bothering me is that it's so easy to get work"". and then ""When smaller companies contact me, my rates are too high"".   That's actually not what he said. Here's the part you left out:   one manager I've gotten to know well finally confessed to me that my rates are too low.   and   When larger (national sized) companies contact me, my rates are too low.   So he's not having an issue that people can't afford him. He's having an issue that he doesn't know where to place his rates. There is as much or more evidence that he feels his rate is too low than that it's too high. I suspect you're projecting, since you mention so many times how ""someone like you"" should be able to afford him.  Because no. If you can't afford him, you shouldn't be able to afford him just because you can't afford him. (which, as tautological as it is, is what your argument basically boils down to)  You inferred a lot from him. His question, the only question he asked, was   What do I do to get a better idea of the actual rates people like me are charging?   To which you spent four paragraphs telling him how he should lower his rates when people can't afford him, and how he's probably making more than he should. Which was not an answer to his question."

freelance,37uhsf,cpncjwhitebeard,3,Sun May 31 06:23:56 2015 UTC,"You most likely need a good therapist to help you work on those bad habits and develop some good habits.  Also this book can help you: http://www.amazon.com/The-Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/1455892823  Cut out all distractions. Movies, video games, tv shows, what the celebrities are doing, comic books, books, etc cut them all out so you got more free time to work on your freelance stuff.   I really don't care what celebrities are doing, they are always doing bad stuff for attention to get more contracts and stuff. I don't follow the latest music and tv shows and movies. I wait for stuff to get on DVD and then I rent it when I got free time. No Netflix etc. I can save the money and time.   When you cut out most of the distractions you got free time to work on your freelancing stuff. This is what I learned from Stephen King and how he writes so many books a year by cutting out distractions. He basically unplugs his TV set so he can write books."

And because I'm only good at starting things up, wasn't able to finish the book. But I'll give it another try. The first habit part was already an eye opener, I maybe just need to stay away from distractions.  Never have cared about celebrities either. I'm read more on current news and all business stuff. Movies and TV series though, those take away a lot of my time when I'm working.  Thanks! I will shut all distractions away, except for my wife and kid of course."

I somehow remember an article on how to deal with laziness, that was I think about last year. With laziness, there are always friction that keeps us from doing what needs to be done. That is because we think too much. If only we can practice doing things right away before frictions settles in your head. So I guess that's one practice I should start doing."

Discipline is the key. The discipline to sit down and work, even when you don't want to, even when you're not motivated.  There's not always going to be people there to motivate you. You can't rely on others to give you encouragement when you need to finish a project. It might happen sometimes, and give you a little burst of energy... but you need to find the discipline to do it even when the encouragement isn't there."

Spent every other day blogging etc. Was building a brand. I started in RI, went down the east coast, then to New Orleans, NM, Arizona, up to Colorado, Wyoming then west to Northern California and down the coast.   Just worked in cafes, every other day like I said. Good times. Was with a now ex girlfriend.   Marriott rewards is a good credit card to have, at least it was 50,000 free points for a weeks stay in different locations when you want to treat yourself.   Slept in home depot, walmart and other random parking lots. Did some camping on actual camp sites but they're stupidly expensive.   Adding extra curricular activities like hiking down the grand canyon can be rewarding and amazing but keep in mind it's extremely exhausting if you're crashing in your car after. Same with the weather and driving long distances, both take their toll.   Sure I've missed a lot but this is off the top of my head at the moment.

They have a poorly designed website. You offer to design them a new one. Then, you go to other sandwich shops and other restaurants and offer to build a website for them. You tell them you can help them because you understand the restaurant business and what customers want to see.   That is one example of a target market and service (a niche, some would call it).

As others have said, find their message boards, subs, twitter hashtags, conferences, industry websites and try to get involved in a genuine way (not being pushy or spammy). A great way can be to blog (in english, or whichever language your customers might speak). If you blog about designing a great [what your ideal client needs] for [your ideal client's industry/service/whatever], you might grow your brand that way. Freelancing requires you to treat yourself as a brand. Find who you are and sell it where you're needed. Your ideal client can change as industries change and you grow. Just get out there and make yourself known."

My hope here, is to clearly communicate dates of deliverable for both me, and the client.  The yellow rows are items where they need to provide feedback, and give sign-off in order for us to move forward.  I'm also very clear that dates are estimates, and dependant on everyone doing what's needed on the dates needed.  In a separate email, I clearly describe our process which, for simple project, consists of four phases:  Define, Design, Develop, & Deploy.   Define is for wireframes and planning Design is pretty obvious Develop is when we build the site Deploy is for Q/A, User Acceptance testing, and deployment to production.   I will go to this effort when I'm about 90% sure I will close the business, but most of the time, I go to this effort after we have agreement to do the work.

""Yeah, i am 90% self taught, the other 10% is from Lynda.com""   Nobody bats an eye. They only care about results.   I would suggest if you are trying to get the attention of a client/employer, you first find their email. Then send them a PERSONALIZED video demo.   Here is exactly how i would do it. I would set up a simple website. Create your demo 90% of this can be reusable. Just put their info in there and then at the end a video of you talking directly to them. From there put that video on a page SPECIFICALLY for them. Meaning, if their name is Jack Daniels. Have the link be yourdomain.com/jack-daniels  Pure vanity alone will cause them to visit the site. You can track thru google analytics if they visited it or not. Then, you have them hooked. All the credibility you need is done. 90% of the sale is taken care of (if you do it right) and all you have to do is real them in!   I use this often on new prospects. About 80% of the people will go directly to the page. From there it is about 95% will contact me."

I could go on forever, but it's best to experience it yourself so that you can personally relate to potential clients.  Every client starts off on freelance sites by hiring the cheapest labor they can find.  Most get frustrated very quickly, and learn the real value of market-rate talent.    Sell the sizzle, not the steak.  When writing your profile, or proposals, make sure you are really describing a vivid picture in the clients mind of how awesome it is to work with you.

While the majority of the oDesk / Upwork market is for cheaper labor, there are still clients who are looking away from that. You just have to be a bit selective and patient.  A lot of my current freelance clients are from oDesk / Upwork. I wrote a blog post talking about my experiences there: http://dennmart.me/getting-software-development-work-on-odesk-while-still-being-able-to-pay-rent/ (yeah, it's a bit self-promotion but I think you'll find some useful info there)."

freelance,37gwq7,FecklessFool,7,Wed May 27 18:53:09 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. There are different parts of the equation that come into play.  For example, it sounds like you haven't completed any work on oDesk / Upwork yet. If this is the case, I would suggest finding 1 or 2 short jobs for less money than you would prefer so you can get good reviews in. Some of my subsequent clients on oDesk told me that having good reviews was a factor in them interviewing and eventually hiring me.  Also, paying attention to all work that comes up for your skills is a bad idea, in my experience. Most of what comes up is noise, and jobs that aren't worth your time. Just find work that you're willing to do. For example, when I look for work on oDesk / Upwork now (software development), I skip all fixed bid jobs since they're usually super-low in price. I also skip any postings where the client is looking for Entry and Intermediate level freelancers, as well as any job posting that is vague. This leaves me with a very short list of prospective work, but that's the pool I will have the most success with.  A lot of it is trial and error. Just don't get frustrated with people offering $5 for something you wouldn't do for less than $50. Focus on you and getting what you want."

Your other two options are: start a local clientele through cheap high quality work and as you build your name and resume things will be far better of for you in a few weeks than forever on Odesk. I did it. It takes more effort but even starting out you can make so much more and gain more local street cred/word of mouth business.   The second option and a last resort (as you shouldn't find yourself in situations like this) is to use Odesk to do the heavy lifting on projects you don't need to see through completely. Get hired by somebody, go ""oh shit I don't have the time/knowabouts for this project,"" hire somebody to do the main work, tweak the final product to your liking/quality standards.   Either way, it's near impossible to make any kind of a living/build credibility through Odesk.

freelance,37gw8n,zxxzx,5,Wed May 27 15:24:44 2015 UTC,"Congrats on getting your first gig!  I'm a freelance videographer/editor (~1 year) and have been charging clients an hourly rate for editing and a daily rate for filming. It has worked so far to supplement my FT income but now that I want to go full time freelance, I find it is not sustainable in the long run.  Right now I charge $50/hour editing and projects that ONLY require editing have tipped off between $300-$600. That's not much considering what some of these videos will be used for, including clients who are global corporations.  I read an article on this sub about the value of the product you're creating for your client and using that to determine your fee. I recently made an animation for a corp to promote a campaign externally on the web. When all work is done, it will cost them ~$600. But the value of the video is worth much more than that, considering the reach it will have.  But then how do you determine the effectiveness of a project that hasn't been completed yet? All you can do is base off your own experience that you will build over time. Don't forget to consider the hours it will take you to complete.  I plan to roll out new project fees soon to big clients first and then roll out to smaller clients if they're successful. Hourly charges get difficult to keep track of as the projects pile up and, even worse, projects take longer to close because the client can just add more videos to the mix.  Someone also mentioned scope creep. While that's possible in our industry, it's more difficult than web design or programming. You can clearly state in a proposal how many shoot dates are required, how many drafts one can receive, etc.  I say do the $50-per-video charge and see how long each one takes you, and then move from there as you build a portfolio. Then you can determine which route is more beneficial for you."

freelance,37gw8n,HeMightBeRacist,3,Wed May 27 18:42:25 2015 UTC,"From what i've read online, charging by the project rather then by the hour is a better way to go about it.   Not necessarily. It works well for some projects, but not so well for others.  In my experience, you need to be much more rigid about the scope of the project when you charge flat out. It's really easy for little things to pop up - little changes here and there that will add up. So, your contract needs to be very specific about what the scope of the project is, and what is expected of you. There needs to be provisions about what to do if you encounter scope creep.  On the flip side, charging hourly makes the project more flexible. It's okay to add small things here and there, as you're getting paid for it.  Personally, I'm willing to work both ways and it often depends on the project I'm working on. Some people like to stress one method over the other, which is fine too. Think about it, and discuss with your client if you need to so that you're both happy."

The toughest part about being paid for piece work instead of hourly is when you hit a snag in the road and all of the sudden the quote you agreed upon with your client now has you making less per project than you should be.   Also, factor in every detail that goes into your production. Yes, creating the videos may take you ~20mins, but what about time spent communicating, making edits once your client sees the final product, pulling down the necessary files in the beginning and uploading post-export. If these are already included in your ~20min quote, awesome. If not, you may want to readjust.  You do not owe the client anything- make sure you cover all of your costs (and think about opportunity costs) before you tie yourself to a dollar amount."

freelance,37dz2p,MrOaiki,5,Wed May 27 13:24:57 2015 UTC,"That is indeed a good conclusion. I agree with you on that. You shouldn't do work you hate nor do it for people you don't enjoy working for (or with).  My definition of working with someone or working for someone, is strictly economical. If you're getting paid, you're working for the one who pays you. If you're working with someone, we're talking a joint venture. Then you're both risking money, hence you should both have a say."

Of course, when the tasks aren't complicated or creative, then it is likely better to have a rank and file type of organization, but I would never take such a task in the first place."

Worse case scenario, they blame you for everything. However, if you are honest and up front, giving suggestions and your reservations, this will not happen.   Let's say it goes belly up. I seriously doubt they are investing their entire life savings on this one business. It sounds like they want to become a player. This means serious coin in your pocket too. Then when it goes bad, you will get the nod for the next huge project.  If it goes great, you are the point man for the whole project.   Never turn down money being handed to you. Unless it is unethical or you really can not put your heart into it. If they are paying you to put your heart into it, get into it!   Deliver 10x on their investment.

One time, when I disagreed with the spending and strategy, I continued to work with them, quietly thinking to myself ""sure, I'll help you implement your shitty strategy"" ... I was actually wrong.  I went along for the ride, and I've been working with them for over 3 years now, and by most measures it's a pretty good success for them.

Well, there you go.  The client has made a choice.  I'm answering under the assumption that you are just building a site/app for them, and that you are not responsible for marketing.  In that case, your job is to build things for them. So, build things for them.  I have had more than one client who contracted my firm to build an app or site that they then found themselves unable to profitably market.  In some cases, they scapegoated the app and pointed the finger at me - ""it didn't have the right features! You didn't build a good app!"" - despite the fact that the client determined the feature-set and executed the marketing strategy.  This is uncomfortable, but ultimately it is not something within our control as freelancers.  If the client insists on marketing their own stuff, and they do a bad job, nothing we build will make any difference.  You have done your agreed-upon job, and the client has paid you for it - you're even! There is no moral or ethical issue here.  Now, outside of the matter of morals and ethics, if you simply don't want to be associated with losing projects, by all means, transition this client off of your services and go find a client who has a more promising product.  Other than that, just take the money & do your best."

I didn't find out until later on that this is not a new program and others have been doing it since the 1990s. There is also different rules for each of the 50 states, etc.  I wrote some C# code to read a PDF7 barcode because they own programmers couldn't manage it. I found out the example code from the OEM who wrote the library was buggy and so I rewrote one from scratch rather than debug their sloppy code. It was only $50 for that part, and it basically paid my eBay fees for selling stuff on eBay.  I found out that anything their programmers can't do they assign it to me, they tried to web scrape a competitor page but it was dynamically generated and had JavaScript that messed things up and had anti-scraping technology. The only way to mine that data is to save it to HTML files and then read the HTML files off a hard drive and there are hundreds of HTML files. If I had done this scraping part the company that owns the data might have sued me or the company for trying to steal their customer list. I assume they wanted it to contact scrap yards to sell their software to them.   Ever since that I haven't heard from them. The scrap yard software is very competitive and there are giants who dominate it already. Had I known that at the start, I would have rejected the client, because there is almost no way to compete with companies already in that market."

Since I knew there weren't screenshots attached to that one, I'm glad you went back to look at another one with screenshots.  Edit to add: Baltimore isn't as bad as the news makes us out to be. There is a 5 square block area where everything on the news happens. We have 3 rival gangs occupying the same area pushing their drugs, and that is where 90% of our violence stems from. Judging by your username, you are in St. Louis, there was quite a bit of bad press coming out of your area last fall with respect to Ferguson, doesn't mean all of the St. Louis area is a craphole.

freelance,37eota,asillince,2,Wed May 27 15:11:08 2015 UTC,"I will give you feedback more from a copy and content perspective because that's my field.    Upon landing on the homepage, I'm not exactly sure what you offer - is it design? Dev? UX? You say how you'll offer your service but not exactly what it is. You should add a short sentence or a sub-header explicitly saying so. You then jump in with a 'get a quote' link, but I still know nothing about you - there should be two links here... one to view your work/case studies and the other to get in touch.  On the services page you can really use copy to optimise your site for SEO - the three tabs could be so much more descriptive about why you're brilliant at websites, mobile and desktop (although doesn't desktop come under websites anyway?) I'd almost reconsider how you structure your proposition, starting with an intro to the fact that you create websites - responsive I would actually assume? In which case, responsive should be the key highlight because that's what everyone wants these days. Then, go into why you're an expert in both design & dev for desktop and mobile.  Couple of typos on this page - Steamlined to bring you. Right to your users desktop. On the portfolio page the intro copy sounds like you can't be bothered to tell the reader what you've done, instead saying you've pretty much done it all. No one is going to find out what it 'all' is without you telling them straight. Plus, you're missing out again on the opportunity to use that text to optimise the page. Trying saying something like 'amongst many other varied projects, I've worked on everything from XXX, to XXX, to XXX' - specifying what your market is most likely looking for. Then say that they can discover more in the links below. On the contact page rather than saying you'll reply as quickly as possible, just say you always aim to respond within 24hrs including weekends and ditch that second paragraph. You'll sound way more helpful and keen to hear from people.    Really hope that's of some help!"
freelance,37eota,Kerodohi,1 point,Wed May 27 13:38:17 2015 UTC,"The main thing that stands out to me is that your work is not front and center. A viewer will hit your homepage and see a header image and a blurb. There's really nothing there to catch one's interest.   The ideal reaction you want is 'Look at this interesting project, this might be a designer I want to work with!' I'm of the opinion that one doesn't need a 'home' page and a 'portfolio' page - your portfolio should be the first thing they see. The blurb on the homepage can be placed into an 'about' page, or ideally on a 'resume' page - there's really no reason to have it front and center.   Along those same lines, try to minimize necessary interaction with the site UI. Currently a new visitor has to click 2-4 times to reach your work examples. A lot of users will lose interest and navigate away in that time. Again, basically bludgeon them over the head with work - make that the main focus :) Also, important content should be placed 'above the fold' - show the user as much of the important stuff as you can without making them scroll.  A minor design nitpick - your header image isn't 100% width and it's bugging me.

I work as a graphic designer full time plus freelance, but the projects at my main full time employer are boring and I get piled wth additional duties I'd rather not do (managing logistics, administrative duties, etc). Long story short I want to go back to freelancing (I freelanced full time for 1 year prior to taking the full time job 1.5 yrs ago) but I'm not crazy about inconsistent income and chasing clients. I already approached my employer about working from home and was denied that, so I'm thinking that when I quit I will tell them I'm willing to continue for $X/hour remote only. I am looking at other full time work but bc where I live makes commuting a challenge I don't care for, I'm thinking very seriously about freelancing as an alternative.  The only way to really know for sure if it's a good idea is to think about what you would do if the answer was no - and work from there. It's a risk that depends on your boss/employer, and your situation, TBH.

I think when offering a retainer you have to take into consideration a few things, for me I look at how much I have ended up charging them on a monthly basis, I look at how much they will potentially pay me.  I also look at the fact that maybe I should take a small hit on a retainer because I can secure them into that contract for 6 months.  I could earn £1000-£1500 from one client not on retainer month to month, but I have no security, they could look at that amount and hire someone, or go somewhere else. Or, I could say hey, look you spend on average X, let's help each other out. Charge them £1100 with 6 month contract.  That way I don't have to worry about eating for the next 6 months.  My mission isn't to be the richest, I want to work smart, I want to create a balance where I'm financially secure not just this month or because of savings, but because I have contracts and redundancies in place to keep the business going."

freelance,37baml,Ginfly,3,Tue May 26 14:45:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly no, obviously any business that has a higher spend will be more open to a fixed cost each month, but go too high and it will make more sense for them to just hire in-house.  That being said, having a retainer with a freelancer is useful for an employer, as they don't have to worry about employee rights etc., they won't have to worry about pensions, H&S, dismissal (although you need to have a notice period in your contract for both of your protection)."

I respect your opinions but the only thing that matters in business is performing the service you were hired by a client to perform (and getting paid for it). I have never built a website where the client said, ""YOU BETTER NOT BE USING A THEME!"" The majority of people have no idea what that even means, nor do they care. They want something that looks good and works. Period.  If my theme built website can generate a 6-figure income then why should I do anything different?"

At my agency I bid projects that are the exact same scope of work for $8,000+ and the other day sent out a $34,000 bid. I've built multiple sites in the $15,000+ range that were pretty simple WordPress sites. At the end of the day the only thing the client cares about is that the website looks good, functions properly, and can be ""found on Google"".   There are projects that REQUIRE from-the-ground-up custom code. I don't touch them. I don't have a reason to. I make a lot of money sitting in my underwear building out WordPress themes. Why not?"

No networking... No PPC... Just SEO.  Freelancing:  Most of my freelance work comes from networking. I don't even have a portfolio on my website. My personal website is very basic and even says on the home page that I'm too busy to keep up with it. One day I might do things differently, but for now it works... I'm honestly so busy that I have a hard time keeping up.  I would focus on networking and if you find a good niche go for SEO. I also do some direct outreach some times depending on the project I'm working on. One of my websites is ranked #1 nationally for custom home builder leads and other custom home builder terms. If I am looking for that type of work I will reach out to businesses but that's a rarity."

freelance,378wn3,jameswesleyhunt,2,Tue May 26 14:19:48 2015 UTC,"Because this is all some people do. They aren't developers, they just download a theme, do practically nothing, and charge their client a shit ton of money doing it.   I can look at his site and tell you it's a theme right away. That is another reason not to use one, if you want to really stand out. The average person isn't going to notice it's a theme, but if that is the type of attitude that you have for your work, you probably don't have much passion for your job.  It all depends on needs. If a client needs a simple, editable website, and you're able to work your design into the theme, than that is fine. But if all you can do is setup themes, you are no developer, and you will certainly run into a lot of problems in your career. There are a lot of cases that require different workflows and such"
freelance,378wn3,apiosiscool,2,Fri May 29 14:14:28 2015 UTC,"Here's my opinion...  While I completely understand what you're saying, I didn't go to college to learn what I do. I taught myself. Just like I didn't go to college when I started my construction company, beef jerky company, or when I sold organic coffee out of my dorm room... although I was in college during that time period.  My point is addressing your ""problems in your career"" comment. For myself, and possibly the OP, this isn't a career. I didn't want to build websites and do marketing when I was a little kid... I've been around businesses my entire life and saw an opportunity. So I taught myself and ran with it.   In 10 years I hope that I'm not doing this any more. In 10 years I don't want to have to work, period. But for now I build websites based around themes for roughly 100k/year. From home. In my undies.   So while yes, being a one trick pony will surely cause problems for a lot of people--I'm not a one trick pony. I teach myself new things and go with the upward flow."

This is a tiny thing, but also on your FAQ page, the image for telephone support is someone reading a book. Feels a bit stock-photo-y (technical term) and off.

freelance,378wn3,raisedbysheep,1 point,Tue May 26 09:17:45 2015 UTC,"Some additional feedback (I only looked at the site on mobile):  I'd recommend reducing testimonial size in the home page for mobile. It's hard to read (just a few words per line).  That slider at the top is super unintuitive; I didn't realize it was a slider until it moved. Also, sliders kill conversion (research backs this up — Google it and you'll see dozens of articles about why).  The portfolio images on the home page scrolled for days. I wasn't sure what I was looking at.  The call to action is buried. Put it front and center — people should know as soon as they show up that the primary action on this site is to get in touch for a quote.  Alternating images on the services page are super weird. I'd try setting that page up with identical markup, then use CSS to float instead of popping the image alternatively at the top or bottom.  You have a lot of services, and to a client, they all sound like part of the same larger task: ""build a website"" — I'd recommend paring down the services to just the things you actually sell.   For example, I build custom web applications and custom websites. Those are my two packages. (Well, were — I'm not currently taking new clients.)  I do branding, copywriting, marketing strategy, etc. — but my clients don't know to ask for that, or that they're shopping for it. I tell them during the sales call that X, Y, and Z are important, and build estimates around that. They're always free to opt out of the extras (but they rarely do if I've explained it properly).  I think the biggest key with a portfolio site is to pare it down to the very essentials: someone heard you build websites, so they're looking to see if A) you're any good (your site, portfolio), B) you seem legit (testimonials, ""I've worked with""), and C) how to get started (contact form). The rest is fluff and ego, generally, so make sure you lead with the most important bits.  Good luck!"

Freelancer is where people looking for cheap work go and Freelancer/odesk/Upwork knows it, so they ensure that its always in the client's corner.   Freelance locally, then you set the terms, define the scope, and can enforce your own contract."
freelance,376y5x,Talman,3,Mon May 25 17:41:25 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree. You can't play by other people's rules and expect to win.
freelance,376y5x,f00gers,6,Mon May 25 18:30:00 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, it sounds like you're going to lose money on this one. Maybe your client will get back to you and extend the deadline and offer extra compensation for your work outside the original scope of the project. More than likely though, you'll bust your ass to finish the project in a way that you think best suits the client and you'll eat the cost to do so. There is no guarantee that this will be good enough.  I'd suggest including a couple things in your contracts to prevent theses issues in the future. First, a clear definition of the project's scope is a must! This includes timeline, deliverables and what you'll need from your client to make it all happen.   You also need to spell out how the project will be effected by changes to the scope. Will deadlines need to be extended? Will you switch from a flat fee to hourly for additional revisions? If completion is contingent on client approval, what happens if you receive insufficient feedback?  It is rare that a client's only concern is the work we are doing for them. A well written contract takes the guessing out of the equation for both parties and allows you both to focus on what's important without the need to second guess yourselves."

freelance,376y5x,Talman,2,Mon May 25 17:36:39 2015 UTC,"so, back in the day, I did some work off e-lance.  (is e-lance still a thing?)  anyhow, my tips:   never take flat-rate jobs off e-lance.   Hourly only.   Flat rate jobs are normally fine, but you want customers who aren't cheap for flat-rate jobs, and so except to the extent that you are practicing your negotiation (when a flat-rate job is done is always a negotiation)   don't do flat rate on e-lance.    Personally, I'd take your current jobs, where the user is trying to negotiate, as negotiation practice.  They asked for more free work.   It's perfectly reasonable for you to turn around and ask for more money.     Doing this without offending the customer is a skill you need to learn.  It's not a super easy skill to learn, but it's not impossibly hard.   It is a valuable skill to have.     advertise an hourly rate and a location.    There are people who are willing to pay extra to get someone local. Set your hourly rate to a rate you are actually willing to accept.   Don't expect to make a lot of money off these sites, but for me at the time, it was paying work. don't be afraid to jack up your rates as you get more work.    Remember you have a limited number of hours to sell, so you can't make it up on volume.   If you have more work than you need, jack up your rates.      (you can also experiment with jobbing work out... but that's really another business entirely, and comes with a whole host of new challenges.)"

I'm currently doing small assignment for one customer who actually sold a software development service to his client. The project is fixed price but pricing was time and material based (so not value based). And to make things even worse, my customer told his customer they're doing scrum. Now they're wondering why the project is on the brink of going red, and they have to jettison customer relationship and satisfaction just to break even (there are 4 developers and a Pm, it's not a small project - yet it could sink the company)."

What that means is you need to understand your own deliverables.  If you don't understand it and have a basis from which you offer your services, how can you expect your potential clients to be trained on what to expect?  You need to set the tone.  So, learn from this one, either chuck it up as a lesson for yourself and move forward, or do what you think you NEED to do in order to make this right?  Making it right is the hard part because I still don't think you know for certain whether or not if you deliver, if he's going to be happy with your work.  Flat out ask....what do you need in order to complete this task?  And state how many revisions you're willing to make and give them the chance to back out if they aren't cool with those terms.

If there's any backend to it at all, it should likely only account for a contact form. And that's all a piece of cake to code. Just pick a PaaS to host your site that leverages most of the backend for you. Like, you shouldn't waste time doing sysadmin work for your online portfolio. Some people do that, and it's silly.  Just make your website easy to use for everyone, including you. It should have very few buttons or anything that gets between your audience and you. While creating your site, emphasize user experience platitudes and you'll be fine: people tend to read from left to right; know how people tend to associate colors; adhere to accessibility standards in case your recruiter is blind, etc. Smashing Magazine is a good resource on stuff like this.  I cannot stress enough that you should spend some time in the design/theory phase before you develop any app. Take some time to sketch out what you want to build on paper.

Their SEO business is an outreach mnistry to them, and they're very, very bad at both outreach and SEO.

For scheduling, I tend to do a combo time-and-task approach and group tasks by context so I'm at my most effective. I wrote up a whole post if you're interested: Scheduling for Maximum Productivity  Regarding your guilt around not finishing fast enough or finishing too fast, that's something you have to give yourself some slack on. I think it's easy, as freelancers, to wrap up our entire identities — and, consequently, a huge amount of our self-worth — in our jobs. Instead of being what we do, it becomes who we are.  We love our jobs, so we feel guilty if we don't give our everything to the work.  I also have a whole post on that, too: The Cult of Work You Never Meant to Join  It all comes down to establishing what, to you, internally, is ""good work"".

freelance,372ewc,jlengstorf,1 point,Sun May 24 22:40:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the links, need to poke around your blag more. Just read the Cult of Work and it's pretty close to the one etreme I am feeling. Except I am my own boss so it's all the harder to justify getting out of it.  I completely agree that over-working leads to lowered productivity in the long run and have been limit myself from OTing for a while; if anything been falling into the under-working category lately. I already established a good work to leisure balance but still feel crappy about it, oscillation between getting motivation and feeling guilt or unaccomplished. Especially on personal projects which by definition I get much more involved in emotionally. And when I detach myself, I slowly lose the joy of working on them :/"
freelance,372ewc,jlengstorf,2,Mon May 25 00:20:21 2015 UTC,"That's tough, and I definitely understand the oscillation. It sounds familiar.   I wish I knew a sure-fire way to sort out those internal conflicts, but I think it's different for everyone.   For me, it eased up once I had a hard conversation with myself about what was really important to me, and then made the difficult choice to stop doing things that were only a little important to me.   I used to play in a band, and I always liked making music. I used to tell myself I should practice guitar more; write more songs; record some rough demos. But I never put in as much time as I thought I should, and it made me feel guilty. Worse, I'd feel guilty when I did play guitar — ""I should be doing something more productive than this,"" I'd think.   I had similar feelings about my writing.   So I had a hard conversation with myself. Guitar, to me, was the remnant of a previous identity. Something I cared about out of tradition, but not current passion.   Writing, though, I very much still care about.   So I sold my guitar and rekindled my blog. I let one go to free up space for the other. (I did this in many other areas of my life as well, trimming the excess off my list of things that I told myself I needed to do in order to be ""good at life"".)  Losing the weight of what I guess you could call a vestigial interest took some of the guilt away and left me with more energy for things that are really important to me. Most of my guilt came from a sense of obligation to things that — when I was brutally honest with myself — I just didn't give a shit about.  Not sure if you're in the same boat, but leaning out your inner todo list may be a good place to start.   Good luck!"

freelance,371l1c,spring_chicken,2,Sun May 24 00:48:17 2015 UTC,"I've done bookkeeping freelance for the past 7 years and transitioned into providing a payroll service and doing tax prep.  When I started, 90% of the clients I picked up had me work from their office. Nowadays it's still ~25%. A lot of the time, there are receipts, inventory receivers, and other paperwork to go through, and it makes trying to work remotely difficult if not impossible. I slowly dropped the trouble clients and most of the others that took me away from my office, but it's not realistic to think you won't need to at least stop in to each client regularly.  Quickbooks is definitely the way to go. A lot of people around here swear by freshbooks and other new applications, but the people that are going to want your help will almost always be using Quickbooks. Do the Online Pro Advisor certification through the website. It's free and will give you a free subscription to the service so you can get in there and mess around. I don't like it as much as the desktop version (too many limitations and missing features), but it's getting better. Regular Pro Advisor is $500 per year. Not worth it in my opinion. It includes a download copy of the software, but you should be able to find QB Accountant on sale for ~$300. Then use the software as much as you can until you're comfortable with it. Even then, you'll run into things you just don't know how to do, but there is a ton of information out there.  If you have any specific questions, ask away."

I definitely prefer that over the 8-5 grind.   The more I research, the more I think becoming QB certified is a good idea so I'm glad that thought has been validated!   Ok, questions: Do you think I should take a basic accounting class in addition to the QB certification?  Can I export/import Excel spreadsheets into QB?  How did you find your first ""long term"" clients?  Did you keep a full time job and use the bookkeeping as a supplement?

freelance,371l1c,UngratefulPeon,1 point,Sun May 24 05:04:45 2015 UTC,"Do you think I should take a basic accounting class in addition to the QB certification?   You mentioned you have experience in AP and billing, so you're a step ahead of most others that want to start bookkeeping. A basic accounting class will likely focus on ledger accounting - which is unnecessary since QB will handle 99% of these entries for you. Basically with ledger accounting, every transaction has a double entry in bookkeeping. When you pay a bill, you credit Accounts Payable and debit Cash, when you purchase an item for resale, you debit Cash and credit Inventory or Cost of Goods Sold, etc. You won't be doing any of that (except for General Journal Entries, but you can always do the JE then check your P&L to make sure it was done correctly).   My point is, don't take the accounting class. You'll learn more by downloading the tax return forms for a Sole Prop (1040 Schedule C) and for a Corp (you'll have to look up your state form). You'll get a better idea of what classifications to use to record expenses.   Can I export/import Excel spreadsheets into QB?   You can export information from QB to Excel easily. Going the other way is going to be significantly more difficult.   How did you find your first ""long term"" clients?   Chamber of Commerce (I'm in a smaller town so can go to events free), other business networking events (meetup.com), TEAM Network (paid group that met 1x per week that I didn't find worth it), craigslist, and then eventually referrals. It was always hit and miss. It took a very long time to build a good client base.   Did you keep a full time job and use the bookkeeping as a supplement?   I did not. We moved to a smaller town right at the beginning of 2009 and the job market was terrible (office mgr positions were listed at $12/hr...), which is what pushed me to freelance. My husband works full time and has been supportive of the decision, but it was a very slow build plus the hassle of billing and collecting. If the job market was better, I would have worked full time instead.   what are your thoughts on rates and any add on fees (traveling, etc)?   I can't pick your rates for you. Look at what other bookkeepers in your area are charging, but keep in mind, you're still learning, so you can't charge top dollar right off the bat. When I started, I charged a relatively low rate (half what the very experienced bookkeepers were charging) and as I got more comfortable, I slowly raised my rates. You can structure how you bill however you like. I don't charge for travel, but I have a minimum number of hours based on how far I need to go. 1 hours min always unless it's remote work. If I need to go 20-29 miles away, 2 hours, 30-39, 3 hours, etc. Find something that works for you.  Good luck."

You're competing with a global market, and even if you do win a job it will be at such low rates as to be worthless.  Making it as a freelance video guy is all about networking. If you're in a small market, know everyone that does video - TV stations, smaller production companies, wedding videographers. Get to know the people personally and find out what their needs are. Show them your stuff and your passion. Work your personal networks the same way you already have, but go deeper. Those Karate school owners? they've got a lot of clients themselves. If they were happy with your work, ask them to throw your name out there, or expand that relationship by asking to videotape competitions or make a school highlights reel.

freelance,371mei,BlueVerse,1 point,Sun May 24 17:44:44 2015 UTC,"Coming out of a high school production program, I sort of had a leg-up on local contacts at TV stations and smaller production houses, since we often worked with them as 'interns' on projects. Without something like that to 'introduce' you, you've got it a little harder and have to introduce yourself.   Find out some names. The head of production at the local TV station. Owners of smaller wedding and commercial production houses. Names at ad agencies. Don't email, that will just get deleted, and rolling through the front door unannounced isn't professional. Once you figure out a name, give them a call. At this point you're not looking for a job, you're just a kid out of high school looking for advice.   Offer to grab a coffee with them sometime, say you're interested in getting into production as a career and are looking for some personal advice from already successful professionals. Show them your reel, lay it on the line, communicate to them that you're excited and passionate about this. Ask what you should do, ask them how they got where they are now. If there's one thing people in this business like to see, it's that kind of excitement and eagerness to learn. Most people had a mentor themselves at some point, and are very willing to reach out and help the next generation if you are interested.  Maybe one of those meetings leads to a 'why don't you come along on this shoot we have next week...', or even a part-time job doing PA type stuff. Doesn't matter what it is - just get in the door, start learning and start making more contacts. Try everything. It's a big business, and there's lots of little niches you can land in either by accident or because you discover you really like it... but you don't know till you try!   Just don't forget, it takes 10 years to be an overnight success. Your first year is just laying the foundation. The next 5 are just figuring out the lay of the land. After that, you step back and suddenly discover you know a hundred people in this business, and those are the people that will help take you to real 'next level'. There is no real 'competition' in this industry, we all work for each other and rely on teams to make it work. Establish yourself as a key member of everyone's team. Always be early. Always be positive. Always be hard working and on occasion bring some donuts. It's not easy, but it sure as hell beats working a 9-5 office job... trust me!"

""Self-Employed"", on the other hand, sounds sort of like ""self-reliant"" -- you take care of yourself.  There's an implied sense of responsiblity.  Having documentation always helps.  It gets easier after the first year, since you can pull out last year's tax return.  Having a bunch of cash on hand helps.  If there landlord is asking for first+last+security, offer three months+security.  If you make a decent living as a freelancer, you're arguably a safer tenant.  A guy making say $100k/year at a salary job might get fired and be unemployed for months.  A freelancer with multiple clients might get fired by one, but still has income to pay rent."

freelance,36yqll,jimbob1979,2,Sat May 23 08:48:10 2015 UTC,"In the US, you don't need to be incorporated to be considered self-employed.  The distinction is pretty much how your taxes are handled.    As an employee, your employer will withhold a portion of your pay for income and payroll taxes, and remit it to the government.  As a self-employed person, your clients just pay you what it says on the invoice, and you have to handle the taxes yourself.   The actual mechanic of paying tax as a self-employed (but non-incorporated) person is generally the Schedule C (PDF-warning) form, which regular workers don't need to fill out."

Would you want to rent your place to an unemployed guy with enough cash to pay the deposit and first month, or the guy who has the cash and  a job?  The last place I rented in NYC was from a private landlord (no management company or broker).  They asked for extra docs, and I provided them lickety-split, along with some extras.  To top it off, I included a personal letter to let them know a bit about me and my wife, and why we loved the place.  I was told at the lease signing that the letter was what put us over the top."

freelance,36yqll,jameswesleyhunt,2,Sat May 23 18:35:39 2015 UTC,"It's really not insane in a competitive market.  You have to put yourself in the landlord's shoes.  Their priority is to get a tenant who will consistently pay the rent on time, maintain the property, and hopefully stay for at least several years.    Like any business, a landlord wants to: 1) charge what the market will bear, 2) minimize risk, and 3) control costs.   Using NYC as an example again, it's very hard to evict a tenant in that market.  If you have to evict, you're looking at very substantial costs.  If you have multiple people interested in renting a property, as a landlord, you want as much information as possible to differentiate between the potential tenants so that you can select for the lowest-risk.  In contrast to the NYC story, I recently rented an apartment from a large corporate property developer/manager (owns probably thousands of units across multiple buildings) in Seattle.  The difference was stunning.  A simple application, credit check, and a tiny deposit and were signing the lease within an hour.  The difference is that this property has an on-site leasing office, and probably has lawyers on staff to deal with evictions.  Those leasing office employees and lawyers are overhead, so the marginal cost of turning an apartment over is minimal -- they're already paying those salaries.    That's a very different story from a private-party type landlord who owns maybe 2-3 properties.  Every time they have to think about their property, it's basically costing them money.  At the end of the day, I prefer to rent from small-time landlords.  You get a lot more flexibility, and if you invest the time in building up some good-will, a smaller landlord is more likely to work with you if something goes wrong."
freelance,36yqll,Cueball61,2,Sat May 23 19:58:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer, certainly makes sense. Have rented from both. The last person I rented from owned three units, and ended up being someone I got along with quite well.

They wanted a lower rate than I charge to everyone else, which I did give them and they wanted different payment terms as well. I relented and did it. At about 4:30 on a friday, they called back and wanted me to further reduce my rate, they hit the ""we have been a long time client card"". I did it, I agreed to it. When I got off the phone I thought about it and I said no, this is not how I do business. So I penned this email and fired them, http://screencast.com/t/vDDBrJDVVm  I do feel better daily as I don't get weird requests coming in and things of that nature. I hated to part ways with them, but in the end, like I said in the email; I value my time.  We all live and we learn. We take this hits on the chin sometimes and in the end it makes us better in business."

After all, it is business. I actually write letters like this and don't send them, but instead revise them to be more objective. Instead of saying things like, ""you're being unfair,"" I said things like ""I can no longer afford to do this.""  Here's my final letter:   Thank you for your response. I understand [company]'s limitations regarding rates. However, as of next week, I will no longer complete any unpaid work (with the exception being client questions). I will do revisions only if they are paid. I have already given several weeks' and thousands of dollars worth of unpaid work to [company] this year alone.  I hope you understand my perspective of the situation and hope we can continue working together. I reiterate that I can still do regular assignments.   I tried to put the ball in their court: they can either compromise or leave. I've made it perfectly clear we can continue work if they meet my terms, which were actually just the way things used to be. If your client did a 180 and acquiesced to your demands and maybe even apologized, would you keep them?    We all live and we learn. We take this hits on the chin sometimes and in the end it makes us better in business.    Yeah. Hopefully in a few years, one of my employees will suggest something, and I'll shoot them down, explaining why we won't do that."

I don't have so much of a rigid business, I have several clients I never charge and I am the type of person that forgets to bill people sometimes as well."
freelance,36xc5h,oneluckykid22,3,Fri May 22 22:06:20 2015 UTC,"I've been meaning to do some research on this myself. I have subcontractors I use for a new and growing web consulting business I run. For now, I am not overly concerned about one of them getting in touch with a client directly, but it's still something I keep an eye on. I will definitely be putting an agreement in place with them once I start doing larger scale/higher dollar work. But for now, most of the stuff I send to them is small-dollar (less than $200) work.   Anyway.. LegalZoom offers an ""Independent Contractor Agreement"" (link) for $15 that may work. For $7.99/month (billed monthly with the option to cancel any time.) you can subscribe to their document service. Gives you access to this plus several other forms/contracts. I had a subscription to this for a couple of months but canceled it because I felt I had downloaded all of the forms I needed, and the website development contract was written in a way that was from the ""perspective"" of a company looking to hire a freelancer. More importantly, it was heavily biased to that effect as well.  If you do decide to download this form, I'd really appreciate a shout letting me know if it was what you're looking for, so I can snag it too when it becomes absolutely necessary for me."

I would not put a clause like that in a contract either though, in respect to the contacting the client. Mainly because I would not sign a contract that had one in there. I would consider making them only use an email system that you have access to, like setting up a help desk or something of that nature. Treat them more like employees than one off contractors."
freelance,36xc5h,dh42com,2,Fri May 22 23:45:51 2015 UTC,In all honesty I probably wouldn't pursue it if they violated terms because it would be expensive but I want it as a deterrent. Why wouldn't you sign a contract that states that? Helpdesk seems like much more work than I want to do. You have a background in freelance/contract/subcontractors?
freelance,36xc5h,john0980,1 point,Sat May 23 02:05:05 2015 UTC,"Some (many?) businesses choose not to pursue legal action against someone who violates stuff like this. Non-compete clauses too. Business can successfully take legal action against violators but I believe it's quite hard, even though the subcontractor or employee signed something.  By the same token just the overhanging ""threat"" of it being a possibility is enough to deter most people from violating these clauses."
freelance,36xc5h,dh42com,1 point,Sat May 23 02:14:56 2015 UTC,"The help desk takes the load off of you. If you are hiring a couple sub contractors you will quickly find that a good portion of your time is eaten up reading emails from them, writing emails to your client, reading the emails from your client, and conveying that to your sub contractor. It becomes a time overhead pain in the ass where you find yourself ground to a halt just responding to emails.   But yes, I have been in the situation before. There are really two ways to go in it. Hire sub contractors or hire employees. I chose to hire employees and become and agency. We run a help desk, I assign work to the employees and let them run with the help desk tickets regarding it. I do monitor them and how things are coming along, but for the most part I have good employees that can communicate with end clients and know what to do.   The reason I wouldn't sign a contract like that is simple. I normally poach the end client. In the US there are only 8 or so agencies that specialize in what we do, so it makes it easy. But that is directly because of our market and would more than likely not translate over to a lot of other digital industries.    Ninja Edit   I wanted to make myself clear on poaching the client and why I do it. There really are two reasons why someone hires another company to do things. Either they do not have the resources to do the job, or they do not know how to do it. People hire us because they do not know how to do it. In the end it normally translates to a bad experience  for both the end client and us if we do not poach the client. We have someone promising things that they do not know the dev time or our schedule to, and then the end client ends up unhappy. Some things on face value look like they would be super hard to do and take a long time, but we might have a drop in library for it we created months ago. Other things seem simple, but in reality are momentous tasks. People that do not actually know what we work in do not know the difference. I do, I specialize in it. I can shoot a price off the hip after a 10 minute consult because I know every issue that will come up. It is a lot less administrative overhead for me and more work. I actually like coding, so if I am answering emails, I am charging, but not liking what I am doing."

The main thing I learned over the years is to specialize. Have one thing that you do fantastically and showcase that work. It's tough getting started and I have certainly had my fair share of ""I'll shoot anything that pays!"" moments.  Your portraiture is nice, children and pet photography can go hand in hand, and headshots are not a long shot from them either. While events can seem like an easy buck, that is a slippery slope and it's real easy to become ""The event guy"" so unless that's something you want to pursue you may want to consider ditching that.  Be on top of your social media - ALL of it. Twitter, facebook, instagram - you should be posting something on all of them daily. If you don't have a mailchimp account, get one.

Some of the portraits are good, but some of the animal shots are not as good. Only show your best work. If something isn't quite as good as the rest, don't put it up.

freelance,36wue9,MtSnowden,18,Fri May 22 19:50:36 2015 UTC,"Great topic! My advice is to change your question to ""which kind of local businesses are most dependent on the web for making money?"" ...and which of those have the most money to spend on marketing?  You say ""I figure the businesses making the most money will be more likely to be interested in having a new website built."" It's not that straightforward. Business owners want to grow their businesses of course. This means increasing profit. Profit = Revenue - Cost. So a business owner wants to either increase revenue or decrease cost. The way either of those goals are handled is dependent on many factors including the businesses brand. (Wal-Mart will cut costs largely without regard to quality; Ferrari will not).  The amount of money a business has sitting around to spend is often called ""retained earnings.""  Depending on how quickly a business wants to grow, they may or may not be trying to spend their retained earnings. Some businesses have no retained earnings. Others have a ton. The amount of money they have to spend has very little to do with their likelihood to spend money on a new website.   What is much more likely to influence the decision is whether you can demonstrate a new website will either increase revenue or decrease costs, thus increasing profit. Is the deal a net positive for the business owner? They are not going to spend money just because it's lying around. This goes for the business with an extra $10k and the business with an extra $10 billion.   You are correct about lawyers and accountants... why is this?  Because those businesses are largely referral based. Especially accountants (and financial advisors). And especially the well-established ones. Potential clients of these services who need major legal, tax, or financial planning assistance will probably ask friends before Google. There's a lot of risk and money at stake when seeking those sorts of services.  Doctors are similar as well. Dentists less so. Mortgage loan officers are largely referral based, real estate agents too.  Another dynamic at play is the depth of the book of business (how many clients they have). All of these are service businesses. As a service business grows, the referral base grows and the need for marketing diminishes assuming the practitioner wants to keep practicing their craft and not begin to manage other practitioners for business growth. To wit, they can only take on so many clients at a time.   Now of course there are exceptions. If you want to get into those types of services, you just need to find an angle.  Younger service practitioners don't have a referral-generated business. And they are hungry thus more receptive to creative marketing ideas. Also, most business owners are receptive to ideas IF you can lay out a plan where you can either cut costs or increase revenue. Of course, they aren't going to take your word for it. They want quantifiable data, references etc...  With all that said, it's likely easier and more profitable to go after businesses that are dependent on the web for making money.    Examples: Could you increase profits by setting up online ordering for a restaurant that does tons of take-out? Does the city have a new project going on that they would like to quickly get a lot of community support behind? Is there a hungry real estate agent with a strong Facebook presence that could benefit from driving people to a custom site? Is there a new apartment community or neighborhood that's going to try to move several hundred units in the next year?  In each of those examples there's a major impact from casting the wide net to capture leads and then convert those into sales. The web is a great place to order food, share info about a new project, show videos and pics of a new home, or inform and show people a new community. Website's are high ROI for these people.  The internet isn't such a great place for convincing somebody that you can win a court case, find all of the deductions they qualify for, or invest money as a responsible fiduciary. Websites are low ROI for these people."

You should not look for places where you can charge X rate because they make more money.  Instead you should consider figuring out how to position your skills based on value.  That way it doesn't matter what type of business you target (unless that's key to your plan).  If you can make the pitch ""hey rebuilding your website will result in a 10% increase in organic inbound leads"", a business can quantify that in real dollars.  They can look at it and say ""well that will probably earn us an extra $12k/year"" and say ""that would make sense to pay $5k for"" even if you normally charge $1k."

I always ask our brand agencies for a key art package - several poses of the different characters, commissioned by my anticipated market strategy. Once I have those, I can use them where I need: social media, App Store, t-shirts, ads, etc.  We pay a lot for them to specifically create those assets. They're valuable, and you should definitely consider pricing them separately -- assuming you provide them in very high quality.   This is most definitely NOT the same service as you're offering, but for 3-5 bespoke images of 5-8 characters, we easily spend $10k. Your value is with animations themselves, but given that context you can see it wouldn't be outrageous to charge a few hundred dollars for high quality, character-only stills."

Not that I don't want to charge that much, I think I'm just having trouble justifying it to myself, though I know it's probably right.

The service they're asking for is, in this case, a reformat of a piece of work you've already completed.  I threw out couple hundred because: 1. I pay a lot for key art images 2. They're valuable to me and my work and worth paying for  You're going to want to consider a lot of your personal circumstance: what's your relationship with the client? How much are you charging them for the work you've done? Do you have a sense of what it might be used for? How long is it going to take you to get them what they're after?   If it doesn't take you very long, you might consider letting them have it this time.

It's not about the actual time spent dumping out a PNG/EPS/JPG whatever, it's about your work being used in a way that is beyond what was negotiated.  You agreed to make animations, not animations and promotional print assets.  Besides, unless you already agreed to surrender all working assets, what's to prevent them from requesting all of this, then sending it all to a different animator for future work?  Maybe they decide to put this character on a billboard, or on T-Shirts, or on the side of their vehicles.  You deserve compensation for all of that. For that reason, I wouldn't send any vector files.  I would find out the exact intended usage and send raster files that fit that need.

If that is the case I would be careful. This could get back to your employer and would probably be the end of your tenure with them, especially if you signed any sort of non-compete or similar document.  If that's not the case and you're just looking for ideas on how to drum up clients for freelance work:  I too hate doing cold-calls and sales pitches, but the following strategies or ""workarounds"" have helped me successfully launch my LLC without making a single sales call:  Reach out to family, friends and former colleagues letting them know you've launched a design (or whatever) business. Say something to the effect of ""the business is still young and we/I are very selective when choosing potential clients."" Also include something like ""if you do not have a need for ______ services at this time, I hope you will keep me in mind should this change, and pass my name along to friends or colleagues who express a need/desire for _________ services.""  It would also help tremendously to get 1-2 projects under your belt, then, with any luck, word of mouth takes over. Do your first few (2-3) gigs at a very low rate (but not so low that people think you aren't serious/do not offer quality service/product), then gradually raise rates from there. You can sell this to prospective clients by explaining that you're a new company/freelancer looking to kick up your first few independent gigs. I did my first web dev project for about 1/8th of market value. It not only helped me build my portfolio but it helped me work through some ""kinks"" and be better prepared for the future. I realized several things that I did not think of (or charge for), many things I should have been asking for the client to send me at the beginning of the project rather than requesting it as it came to mind while building their website.  My first client was my former boss, second was a referral from my brother-in law, third was a family member. This quickly lead to multiple clients and projects within the next month or two thanks to word of mouth.  You could also consider purchasing a ""corporate"" sponsorship of an organization or non-profit that advances a cause you believe in. For example, I intend to sponsor a local animal rescue group if (when, because it will happen to all of us from time-to-time) I hit a lull in projects coming in. I donate to these groups anyway so purchasing a corporate sponsorship with money that technically belongs to my LLC allows me to support a cause I otherwise would anyway and advertise at the same time.

Nope - BUT Been there, done that. I went after their client (who they dropped) after I quit 'full-time' at both agencies. I never signed anything with those old agencies so I was a free man, but the client on the other-hand didn't have any money and I threw away a couple of weeks work on a project that went nowhere after the company closed. Not on my future-agenda, that's for sure!   It would also help tremendously to get 1-2 projects under your belt   My reel is strong, so I won't have any problem with business in that regard. I think what best gets my question across could be - ""How can I push my freelance path toward the methods of drawing up business that an agency would?""  I have an agent that finds work for me - REALLY helps out when you live in a city, keeps you busy... but I want to pull-in remote work for myself under the alias of a 'studio' to some degree, although it'll be mainly me doing the work.  My rates are at the good-spot thankfully lately so I have been working (in my immediate area) on an average - above average payrate.  What I want to do now, is get the clients who can pay budget from afar, rather than sinking my hopes and dreams into a city (city that I want to move away from in a year) - so I want to get my own clients, to work specifically remotely at this point.   I realized several things that I did not think of (or charge for), many things I should have been asking for the client to send me at the beginning of the project rather than requesting it as it came to mind while building their website.   I see what you mean here, I've been learning the ropes of what specifically works to bill-in for. Earlier, I would lose a lot of money because I just generally didn't charge enough to bypass commute (which is also a reason I struggled at those agencies - they never compensated me for anything) So, I learned that even within my hourly rate sometimes that 4hrs a day on a train doesn't pay enough; time to adjust rates to a small incline and per-project, gain more to influence what I'm traveling so-far for. It also helps to be stern about your prices before ever getting involved in the project (lesson learned)  I tried working through family and friends - just never worked-out, so I was in a spot that I needed to branch-out more, (which is where I am again; trying to branch to newer bigger clients, not agencies or studios - companies themselves)  Haha, I do the same regarding sponsorship with an NGO; a couple of free projects per-year and they really support me through the web. Just hope the support will be seen more in the future.

Depending on the amount, you can either file in small claims court or take it to an attorney and sue for what you're owed. There is no softball here.  Fuck him for ignoring you, fuck him even more for telling you that he's not going to pay (though, at least he made his intentions clear) and fuck him all the way for threatening to sue you, just for asking for your money.  Don't contact him again and immediately begin the process of filing suit."
freelance,36scoa,redlotusaustin,3,Thu May 21 19:28:04 2015 UTC,"The thing is I don't even know if it is worth all the legal hassle. Literally the guy only owes me $150 but all that courthouse trouble over a small amount? I mean I could understand if it were something big like $1,000. It's only 150 because he paid me all the rest of the other money up front and this 150 was just a remaining balance due. Yes I can go to court and show our written agreement but not sure what would hold up in a court of law I have never had to sue anyone in a situation like this before this is my first time."
freelance,36scoa,GreyWalker,69,Thu May 21 19:31:42 2015 UTC,"I sued someone in small claims court for $100.  It costed me $150 to file and court fees, but it was the principle of the matter.  Within 10 minutes of starting the discussion with the magistrate, it was found in my favor and the guy had to pay me my $100 plus he had to pay my court costs, so he now owed me $250.    This is all public record.  If he does not pay, it goes on his credit report as a public notice.  After 10 days of non-payment, I can go to the sheriff and fill out a form and they will take his possessions and auction them off until they have my amount owed.    Edit: Also, they automatically add interest for every day the guy doesn't pay me."
freelance,36scoa,redlotusaustin,15,Thu May 21 19:45:51 2015 UTC,Interesting. Good to hear from someone who has been in a similar situation before at least now I have an idea of what I can expect if I take him to court. This should be interesting. But either way he still seems very angry so I may just end up taking this to court and starting the process.
freelance,36scoa,GreyWalker,11,Thu May 21 19:53:36 2015 UTC,"As /u/greywalker said, depending on where you are, he may also be liable for your court costs if it's found in your favor. It sounds like he's also acknowledged the debt and explicitly stated that he's not going to pay, which won't go well for him in court. If you happen to be friendly with an attorney, you might ask them to write a letter of demand, or do it yourself, and state that if payment is not made by X date, you will be filing for the full amount and all additional court costs, attorney fees, etc."
freelance,36scoa,theli0nheart,8,Thu May 21 20:07:07 2015 UTC,"When I sued the guy mentioned above, I sent him a letter by certified mail stating that I wanted a $100 cashiers check or money order by xx date or I would sue...I never heard a word from him so I sued.  So, I don't even think you need an attorney.  Just write a nice letter saying you want your money or your next step will be small claims court."

I don't know anyone else so I'll just have to keep searching until I find the right lawyer or attorney to represent me and from what I can tell this won't be pretty or cheap.
freelance,36scoa,TeepPeep,10,Thu May 21 20:13:12 2015 UTC,Why even involve a lawyer? In small claims court you represent yourself. I think most lawyers will laugh you out of their office for an amount this small.
freelance,36scoa,zoeypantalones,-11,Thu May 21 21:31:55 2015 UTC,Then why even go to a courthouse at all? Who goes to a courthouse and has no lawyer? I mean unless the intent here is to lose the case then I could never go by myself I am not a legal professional I know absolutely nothing about the law and he is trying to falsify evidence against me and even my threat about taking him to court didn't work he said he has evidence on things I never even said even though he claims he has the emails to prove them so he said go ahead take me to court because you know you won't win.
freelance,36scoa,MrsLumpia,16,Thu May 21 22:37:57 2015 UTC,That's the whole point of small claims court - for people to represent themselves without a lawyer. You don't need knowledge of the law.

It was a small claims issue and he sent his attorney to represent him instead of him showing up himself. Of course we resolved the issue in a court mediation so we didn't have to go before a judge but I never forget. Maybe the lawyer thing depends on what state you live in? But then again I wouldn't know. But if you say I don't need one I suppose I could fight this one alone should I need to.

Now he says he has an email from me specifically stating I am a professional graphic and web designer when I never not once said this to him. I told him since day one I am just a college student who is trying to finish his graphic design degree and that I am learning about web design in the process and that I am by no means a professional.   So he claims that if I take him to court he can counter sue and say that I am not the professional designer that I mislead him to think this entire time. He said he has emails from me to him stating I am a professional and that I have been doing this for ages when I specifically told him I am just a student trying to build my portfolio and I made it clear to him that he is my first client ever. He just does not seem to budge on this and I would hate going to court over this especially since I have no clue what can or will say against me and for all I know he could falsify evidence against me that he made up.

freelance,36scoa,kickingpplisfun,0,Fri May 22 15:28:24 2015 UTC,"If you have a solid contract, it doesn't matter whether he's happy with the final product. This is why contracts and deposits should always be dealt with before starting any work. Even if the client refuses to pay (because of quality of work), the deposit generally covers your base time.  Judge Judy had a case like this and found in favor of the designer because of the solid contract and the fact that the designer fulfilled everything agreed upon in the contract (final deliverables). She made a point that the client's refusal to pay was based on taste not whether the designer's obligation had been fulfilled. The designer completed her end of the deal (including multiple revisions). It's worth noting, the designer's work was hideously awful. I would've tried to get out of it too or at least tried to talk it down to 50%."

He emailed me just over an hour ago with some bullshit law codes that he is shoving in my face saying he can use them against me. Yet here I have been desperately trying to find the exact law code that states he has to pay me once the work is done even if he does not like the work and somehow I cannot find the exact law that states this. I know you're right I just know it I just have no way to prove it because I don't know the exact law code so I can email him back and shove it in his face.
freelance,36scoa,jzachmanjr,-2,Fri May 22 00:12:29 2015 UTC,I need a law that says he is obligated to pay me by law once the contract was completed per his request. Now he says that not once did he ever state the website was to his liking. When I go over the emails I can see that yes that one little error was my mistake we have so many emails back and forth over the months that it's easy to mis something. Nowhere did he say that he liked the work I did. However he did say the site was completed and that no more changes needed to be made by me as we were done with the site and I even have the email from him confirming that the remaining balance would be mailed in a check within 24 hours a check which I never got.   That 24 hour check email was sent to me the very same night that he sent me the email confirming no changes to the site needed to be made and that we were done. I also have additional emails from him stating (about 2 weeks later) that he would verify why that was that I never received the money only for me not to get the money at all and for him to never follow up with me. I don't have any specific law codes I was just hoping someone knew the exact law that says he has to pay me by law so I could shove it in his face for all those laws he quoted me which I just looked up and are real laws.
freelance,36scoa,Duckarmada,-3,Fri May 22 00:45:18 2015 UTC,But what about federal laws? Are there no codes for those laws? I was just thinking there could be federal laws that perhaps are the same for each state in the country? Or do federal laws have no weight in a case like mines?
freelance,36scoa,MrsLumpia,2,Fri May 22 01:03:19 2015 UTC,"If there is a law, it would involve breach of contract. To use those laws, your contract would have to be solid. From what I've read in this thread, you don't have a signed contract with specifics defining completed work, how many revisions, timelines, payment schedules, copyright transfer, etc. This is likely why he is challenging you; he knows you don't have a contract to stand on. You may have emails communicating some of those details and his acknowledgements which gives you some weight, but nothing quite as strong as formal as a  detailed, signed, and dated contract.  If I were you, I'd drop it and take it as a learning opportunity. Build a strong contract or find one via AIGA. There are countless free contact examples on the web, but make sure they are what you're looking for and seem legit before using for live projects.  $100 is not worth the trouble IMO. Technically, you can argue you're losing money trying to fight this by spending billable hours dealing with it. By the time you get through the case, you'll have lost more money than it's worth. It would feel good to win, but at what cost? The court might agree with you and require payment of what's due plus court costs, but it's highly unlikely they'd award you lost time (unless you can concretely prove loss of wages due to the shitty client)."

Get your money, plus court fees, plus pay for time suing him. Add in some high interest rate. Figure out what the max dollar amount for small claims, sue for almost that. Make him think twice before he does this again, and he will do it again. The reason you got screwed is because most people dont fight back. Document and or record every interaction with him.

I already talked to my mother today who told me to shut my mouth and not say another word to him until we can get this figured out and taken care of so this way I don't keep giving him things to use against me in a court of law should he not be bluffing and serious about the whole going to court thing.

That if I dare take him to court I will lose the case because he has emails of things I said to him and promises I made about the project that I never kept. Emails that I never wrote and emails of things that I know I never said to him.  He said that I mislead him into thinking that I was a real professional graphic and web designer when I told him on day one back in January when we started that not only was I not a professional but that I am just a college student trying to finish my degree in graphic design and that the reason why I am doing this project for him is because I want to build my portfolio.

Regardless of if this qualifies me to be a professional or not I made him a website and he confirmed it done just like that I even have the email to prove it. So regardless of if I am or am not a professional he is still legally liable for paying me my money once we were done with the site per our terms and agreements.  So if he hated the website or he thought I was not being professional in my work he is responsible for telling me directly something which he failed to do and I have no doubt that any judge who hears this ""he led me on to think he was a professional designer"" excuse will toss that one out the window in 5 seconds after I explain that he never alerted me that he was unhappy with the work just that we we were done and that I met his expectations on the project. So if I was being unprofessional as he claims about it he is responsible for telling me this. Not sitting there and saying the project is done when he hated it and thought it was unprofessional.  The fact that I met his expectations per the email is enough to prove that he agrees the website is done and per his request and I'd like to think in a court of law he would lose any defense he has just like that. But I agree he is full of shit. I still feel like the money he owes me is not worth going to court over but if he ever emails me again or threatens any more legal action I will take this to court and deal with it."

Generally in my business no one would want the stigma of being a bad client so everyone plays nice.    But I certainly wouldn't take a beating on this.  If you can't make it work in court there are other- legal I say- ways of wasting people's time that can give you some satisfaction and maybe break up some boredom or procrastination.

I'm tempted to ask you this guy's name because I was in an almost identical situation five years ago. It really shook me up and I'll never forget it. I eventually told him I would take legal action if he didn't pay me. He blew up and verbally accosted me, threatening to tell everyone he knew that I was taking advantage of him so that I could never get any business again. I just stayed super calm (even though I was shaking) and said over and over, ""This is what our contract says. This is what you signed."" He eventually agreed to pay me.   I later found out my guy was a narcissist, had major problems with EVERYONE in his life. You are not the biggest issue in this guy's life. He's just being a brat and isn't used to anyone standing up to him. He's the reason people quit freelance. Look back and try to find the warning signs and be wary of them next time. Good luck!"

The guy can pretty much find anything and I didn't want my email or name tied to this account so I wouldn't be able to give you his name just in case he decided to get smart on me and search google for stuff again. But I will say he lives in California out in LA He tells me that I am the first web/graphic designer he has worked with ever here so I have no clue if he has worked with other people in the past or if I am really the first person to work with him.   But chances are if he has worked with other people than like you said he may have done this to others as well. I don't even care that the man called my work trash it's just that he never told me anything and the fact that anyone who knows me can tell you I am a peaceful guy who loves to avoid conflict and resolve issues peacefully I don't want any trouble but he brings on the trouble himself and I think because I can be so soft spoken at times with people he takes advantage of that and thinks I'm too weak to defend myself here. But I see your points and completely agree hope this matter can be resolved and put behind me soon.

freelance,36qbdu,fantomsource,5,Thu May 21 07:29:41 2015 UTC,"I use Elance for the majority of my work, and I recently paid them the $10 to upgrade my account. I was getting work prior to this, but I feel like it was worth the money since I use it so often. It increases the number of connects, and you can see the high, mean average, and low bids on a job. Because I've found that one hears back from maybe 25%, at most, of jobs that one applies for, the extra connects are helpful. I also like seeing what other people are generally bidding.  I can't say whether upgrading your account will help you get work if you haven't had any hits yet. I suspect that it might not. As I mentioned, the extra connects are quite helpful because you can apply to more jobs. However, if you're having zero luck with Elance, you might want to hold off on upgrading. In my experience, upgrading your account doesn't seem to make a difference in how clients view you, or whether they'll consider you for the job.  Also, you mentioned those gigs where the job selection goes on for weeks. I know exactly what you're talking about; I actually made a post recently discussing that. Believe me, it's incredibly common for clients to neither select a candidate, nor delist the job. It could be for any of a number of reasons. Sometimes they just don't find anyone who's either skilled enough, or who has the right qualifications for the job. It could also be an issue of finding someone good enough who's also in their price range, or even of trying to ""test the waters"" to get an idea of what they can expect to pay.   How many jobs are you generally applying for? When I'm not maxed out on work, I apply for several per day. You can also try checking the client's profile and seeing whether they've hired before.  Here are some general tips for getting the most out of your Elance proposals:   When you're working with limited connects, look for clients who hire frequently and have spent a reasonable amount of money in the past. Try to avoid clients who appear to be new to the site, since they may be less likely to hire anyone (note: this is anecdotal).  Only apply for jobs that were listed within the past 24 hours. You can always make an exception if you find that perfect gig that you're incredibly qualified for, but I've found that this method works well for increasing the responses to my proposals. Apply for jobs with relatively low proposal counts. ""Relatively low"" is kind of vague, but personally, I only apply for jobs with fewer than 10-15 proposals. The more proposals, the less likely yours is to be seen. Don't bother spending extra connects to put your proposal at the top of the list. This is anecdotal, but personally, I've never found this to make any difference whatsoever. Unless there are like 30+ proposals already, they're going to see your proposal anyway. When there are a huge number of proposals, you may want to reconsider applying unless you know, for a fact, that you're supremely qualified for the job.   I hope this was somewhat helpful. TL;DR: Upgrading your account can be helpful if you're already getting jobs regularly on Elance, due to extra connects. However, the upgrade alone doesn't make a difference in your ability to get jobs in the first place. Instead, there are some general ProTips you can employ to help maximize your chances of getting jobs."
freelance,36qbdu,photonasty,3,Thu May 21 20:30:04 2015 UTC,"All you're getting with the membership is extra connects, the ability to view what your competitors are charging, and the ability to include samples of your work with your proposal. If you don't need any of those, then it's not worth it. I personally never needed it, and I'm 100% positive it's not the reason why you're not getting jobs.  To be very blunt, I think it's in your best interest to look into writing more effective proposals. Getting the first job is the hardest part of freelance websites and it'll take a lot of convincing for someone to choose you over someone with positive reviews already."

freelance,36qbdu,ChickenWangChung,3,Thu May 21 09:58:43 2015 UTC,"Have you noticed that most jobs you write proposals are never awarded to others? Only about 10% of the jobs I've sent proposals to seem to be ""awarded to another""."

freelance,36qbdu,photonasty,1 point,Thu May 21 16:52:19 2015 UTC,"I asked about that on Elance recently. Having heard opinions from both clients and freelancers, my initial suspicions seem pretty much correct. There are several reasons why someone might not hire anyone:   No one was skilled or qualified enough. Some jobs are looking for someone with expertise in a particular niche. From what I've heard from people who have hired on Elance, it's quite common to get a surprising number of proposals from people who are entirely unqualified. I'm a writer, so I don't know about other professions, but there are a lot of terrible writers out there. Some are genuinely bad, like ESL speakers who know the language conversationally, but not well enough to write good content. Others are just mediocre-- correct grammar and spelling, but just lackluster, cliched, or dull. No one in their price range was skilled or qualified enough. There are a lot of clients on Elance who seem to want to pay bottom dollar. When you're hiring a skilled professional like a writer or a web designer, you get what you pay for. If you're offering bottom-barrel prices, you won't attract the people with real talent. They found someone elsewhere. It's common for clients to post on several platforms, putting the same listing on Elance, Odesk, Craigslist, and other sites to cast a wider net.  They're just ""testing the waters,"" and they have no intention of hiring. I suspect many clients, who probably don't understand the Connects system, are just looking around to see what's out there and what they can expect to pay. They're basically window shopping."

When I started out - I used to submit proposals to everyone even for very low paying jobs - and often I'd do the work (for small jobs. For larger jobs - just an initial stage) before they even contact me back and then in my proposal link them a demo of the product - basically saying ""here's what I did.

freelance,36oom4,Instantlancer,2,Wed May 20 23:18:41 2015 UTC,"I'm a freelance writer, so my profession and experience are different from yours. I find that with writing jobs on Elance, there's good work out there. As a relative beginner (a couple of years of experience, and a solid portfolio), there's work within my general $20-50 per article pricing range. I just ignore the people looking for bulk content at less than $5 per article.  Yeah, the low pricing is insulting, isn't it? I feel like many of those clients don't understand the value that our work brings. Whether it's creating high quality content or copy that actually attracts their target audience, or designing an expansive, aesthetically pleasing, highly functional website, we are providing long-term value and benefits to their company. Freelancers are skilled professionals who are good at what they do. Like any white-collar worker, they expect to be paid reasonable living wages.  I think the most that talented freelancers can do, is to avoid wasting their skills and expertise on insultingly low-paying jobs. The cheapskate clients can get what they pay for. With content writing, for example, $5 for 500 words is not going to attract highly skilled, seasoned writers. At worst, they'll get a bunch of people from overseas who speak English as a second language. (I'm sorry if this sounds ethnocentric or elitist, but even if you speak a second language proficiently, it doesn't mean you can genuinely write well in that language. I'm a writer, so my experience differs from other professions where language isn't as much of an issue).  At best, they'll get inexperienced beginners who need the low-paying work to build a portfolio. These people can certainly do good work, but it's arguably inferior to what you'd get from an experienced professional. Plus, once they have their experience and can land higher-paying jobs, they're not going to stick around."
freelance,36ofov,Shibest,25,Wed May 20 21:36:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, first things first. At some point, you're going to have to get used to the idea that you're going to have to talk on the phone. E-mail is just not practical for everything. But that aside, some clients just prefer talking on the phone, and you're going to lose out on jobs or irritate them if you refuse to. I learned this the hard way.  To alleviate some of your concerns:   Ask your roommates to tone it down a bit while you take a business call (if they're not dicks, they should be able to handle this). Or you can go into your room, or even just the bathroom, and close the door. This probably won't be an hour long conversation, just ten or fifteen minutes to go over some things. If absolutely necessary, go for a walk in the park or something. Doesn't have to be. You can just let them say what they want to say. Don't commit to anything over the phone if you're not comfortable-- I know I'm not. I'll promise something and then realize that was way too hasty of a thing to say. Say lots of things like ""I'll check on that and get back to you."" Mostly, just let them do the talking and say whatever they want, and tell them you'll follow up. Absolutely smart idea. So what you do is send an e-mail discussing everything you talked about. If you must, take notes during the meeting (though I've never found this necessary). Just a quick e-mail saying ""Hey, so just to follow up, I wanted to make sure to clarify everything we spoke about"" then just give a rundown of the meeting. Make sure you request some kind of acknowledgment and ask if there were any other important points you may have missed. I don't consider anything real until it's in e-mail form, and acknowledged by both parties. Yeah man, you'll just have to get comfortable with it. The more you do it the easier it'll be.   So, at some point you're going to have to start taking those calls.  But okay. I'll take this ride with you and assume that point isn't right now.  I'm all for honesty being the best policy... except in this case, if it were me, I would tell them I'm pretty busy and unable to chat over the phone, however e-mail is preferable and I'm able to check it any time. This especially works if what you need to talk about is time-sensitive, you can say something like ""I know this is important and time is a factor, since I'm unable to talk over the phone I think we can discuss all the details quickly and easily through e-mail.""  I've never really had anyone question that line.   It also bugs the shit out of me when clients want lots of unbilled phone meetings when I'm off the clock (I work off a day rate, and it doesn't fly to bill someone my day rate for a ten minute phone call. I usually just have to eat that time). if you're not paying me, my time is MY time, and I don't really care if you want to talk simply to reiterate everything we've already decided on, or to tell me over the phone things that could easily be said in person. Bugs the shit out of me, so I often just demand e-mails.  You can be nice and professional about it.  It seems like I should have a better way to wrap up this post but I don't.  Best of luck."
freelance,36ofov,sonofaresiii,2,Wed May 20 22:25:24 2015 UTC,"This reply is good. I'd add that you want to be ""in control"" of the conversation. That doesn't mean that you have to do the most or the loudest talking - only that you make sure it stays on-topic and you are ready to jump in to politely cut off unproductive areas of discussion. There are ways to do this that sound professional and make clients feel like they're heard without letting them ramble at you too long. Asking questions is a good way to steer the discussion while still letting the customer feel like they're in charge.   ""I'll check on that and get back to you.""   Developing a toolbox of phrases like this will be super-helpful to OP. Some others might include:   ""What is the need that we're trying to meet here?"" (This is for when customers are getting too into their ideas and it's not clear WHY they're talking about what they're talking about)  ""I think we might be getting into a rabbit hole here (or down in the weeds). Let's come back to ______"" (This is when the discussion is getting too detailed or hypothetical and/or you need more info to make decisions) ""OK, I think I understand the situation - let's hash out the details over email"" (When customers want to discuss details and you need some time to wrap your head around the subject) ""Is there anything else we needed to go over today?"" (This is when you want to end the call)   Remember what The Telephone Doctor says:"" you can hear a smile"" and ""a fake smile is better than a genuine frown"".  I'm also someone who doesn't much care for phone calls. They get easier once you do a few of them and you have your toolbox of phrases for controlling the conversation."

They will call a much hungrier person that they can actually talk to. These people are busy if they say ""call me"" is for a good reason. They dont have time to deal with prima donnas, people who are afraid to talk over the phone,  are too busy or think that the world revolves around  them.  IF you are in the creative field then you better relate to anybody or you are in the wrong type of field.    To run a successful biz it takes more than talent and you must be able to deal with clients directly via phone/email/face to face. They are the ones hiring you and paying for your talent. They are also projects which are quite privy and can't be discuss over emails without first knowing who you are hiring. The last thing you want is to send an email to a anybody, or a very young person without much biz smartness and who you know from Adam and then you never hear back.   One a relationship is establish then emails will follow.   Then that email with the great concept ends up across town with a different art director whom the photographer/designer went to college. And  BANG! before the idea has been created the other company is running the press with that great idea."

I've found that if a client wants to talk, it's because they don't want to put something in writing. Could be a warning sign, could be they're getting in the car at the end of the day. Is this someone you've worked with before?  Try this: ""I'm sorry, the nature of my business requires I have written record of all requests. This is for the benefit of the client. Thank you for understanding."""

Then I email a response to whatever their voicemail said. This usually brings the conversation to an email thread and I'm good to go.   When someone specifically asks me to call them, I reply with something like, ""Sure, how about Tuesday at 10am?"" This immediately gives the call importance as a scheduled meeting and eliminates random time wasting calls.  On the other hand, when there is a critical situation, I'm proactive in calling the client to get things resolved quickly. This reinforces that I value there business."

The potential client is saying ""call me""  and when you are young and hoping to get new clients that is what you do via the phone, facer to face or Skype. Once you cement a working relationship then email works fine.  For those first step most clients want to know who they are dealing with. After the phone call is always smart to request an email from the client to recapp the important points of the job description, style, place/time, deadline, payments, licensing rights etc. Later on if something is missing or is not what client was hoping for then the photographer/designer can always go to that email and step by step clarify any confusion... everybody is been protected."

If you happen to have small children running about, that's fine too.  I've been on many calls with kids in the background, and people totally understand. verbal communication isn't your strong suit?  Get better at it!  Really.  Work on this, as it will help you ten-fold in the future.  You will always need to talk to people in person, and on the phone.  Don't avoid this skill If you want a record, have the phone call, take notes, and share your notes and expectations and results by email after the call. This is an exceedingly professional thing to do. If you're not that comfortable, then get comfortable doing it.   There's really no excuse to avoid a phone call (or skype) with a client.  I know I might sound harsh, but you'll get more done by talking to people compared with email.  It's faster and far more efficient.

I will travel more than an hour to visit a client face to face because going over things for an hour meeting will dispel all kinds of misconceptions, and get a much (much) clearer joint vision of requirements.  Even for the simple sites, it's far far better to meet in person or via voice to clear up issues.   Don't get me wrong, I text-chat and email all the time for quick follow-ups or quick messages, and because it's an asynchronous conversation it can be handled with some freedom.   But I will often voice chat via skype with designers and developers because a 20 minute chat can be handled with much more clarity with a 5 minute voice call.  I'm an introvert.  I totally understand where you're coming from.  My first choice is to avoid calls too.  When my phone rings, if I don't recognize the caller, I almost always avoid it.  But when it comes time to getting work done with colleagues, collaborators, and clients, voice and face to face is just a must.  Not for everything, but it really isn't something you should avoid.

I recently had a good, steady, reliable client have some serious cash-flow issues, and couldn't pay me for about three months.  They went from paying my invoices within 30 days, to no payment for about 90 days.  It hurt!  It was noticeable.  It was also at tax-time, so I needed to make that payment, and my dog got sick, and cost me a small fortune.  It was a triple whammy, all at the worst possible time.  It killed my savings.  Thankfully, because I saved, I was able to weather the storm, but had I not saved, I would have been royally screwed (and I don't want to think about the possible fate of my dog).

Another thing to consider: does it need to be better? No matter how much experience I gain as a dev, I always find myself halfway through a project and thinking I should start over because there's a better (read: different) way to solve the problem.   There's a huge difference between ""this other way is 20% more efficient and less costly in the long run"" and ""I like the way this new idea is laid out, so I hold do that.""  In many cases, my urge to refactor is due to some hurdle I'm facing that I convince myself wouldn't exist if I started over.

They probably have given you the code expecting you to know what should be done to achieve their goals.

After all if your not healthy then you will not be able to help the client as much and they probably wouldn't want that.   Not everything can have a time frame but to compensate maybe you can keep the client updated. Let them know where you are at and how figuring out the system and implementing the changes is going.

No other programmer is going to be able to grok it faster- they are paying the Single-Developer Tax. State this to the client, and expect no pushback. As has been said already in this thread, if they have other expectations, they need a reality check."
freelance,36jkin,dx4100,1 point,Wed May 20 05:43:19 2015 UTC,"This is a good opportunity to set expectations with the client, as others have said. What you need to do is tell them what you are able to do and how long things should take.   If you can't estimate how long it will take, come up with a plan to assess their codebase and figure it out. Let them know what you need to do, why you need to do it, and what problems you might see along the way. Let them know approximately how long it will take, how much it will cost, and what benefits they will get after you are finished.  The thing you need to remember is the client is not an expert on software development. They have no idea if what they are asking is feasible or not. It's your job to tell them what you can and can't do, so they have a good idea of how they can proceed.  If you continue to work on the project, my best advice is communicate openly with them.  If you find yourself in an area of bad code and things will take longer than expected, let them know right away.   They will appreciate that much more than telling them at the last minute you won't hit the deadline. At that point it will just sound like an excuse."

We used to log on and make bids at similar times. I gave him tips on how to write good bids and proposals so they may be similar in phrasing. And we are of course separate entities, each doing our own thing, in accordance with the terms of service.  How would you propose a website like Elance or Freelancer distinguish between what you're describing and what I'm describing?

I just want to know how would Elance differentiate between what's legitimate (like yours) and what's a violating (what I am saying). I understand that you and your BF could really be independent providers working separately on Elance under different categories. But what if your BF or you start handling both the accounts and provide similar service (under different categories), would that be allowed or would that be a breach of their TOS? You both are legitimate persons, you both have verified profiles, but now you work in a separate job while your BF keeps bidding and working in Elance under both the profiles. What about that?"

freelance,36jvnz,leepowers,9,Thu May 21 17:17:04 2015 UTC,"It's a creative idea, I'll give you that. My main (and hopefully constructive) criticism is that you shouldn't charge based on what a client can afford to pay. Your rate should be based on the value you bring and what you're worth. And should also depend on your goals.   Do you want to make $100/hr? Then start charging $100/hr. What would you rather do? Work 10 hours and earn $1000? Or work ~30 hours for the same thing? The 20 hours left over can be spent developing more $100/hr leads. But the 30 hours only leaves 10 hours left in the work week, 10 hours to spend chasing more $35/hr leads. Charging too little traps you at a certain level of freelancing. Charging more enables you to pursue higher quality clients. And better customers mean better business and ultimately more profit.   If you want to catch smaller clients looking for a more affordable solution that's still doable with a higher rate. Just scale back the deliverables. Instead of 10 pages, do 5. Instead of creating a custom design, use a WordPress template. But your value and your goals for your business should be non-negotiable."

And should also depend on your goals.   I would argue that you are providing more value to larger clients based on their size alone. Isn't incresing sales by 10% for a company with $100k/month revenue 10x as value as increasing sales by 10% for a company with $10k/month revenue?"
freelance,36jvnz,leepowers,2,Wed May 20 13:56:55 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. It definitely is worth more on a strict dollars basis. If a consultant can measure the impact of their work it would be ideal to move away from an hourly rate to fixed fee. If he can deliver an income increase of $100k/month, he should charge some fraction or multiple of that gain as a consultation fee.   But in most gigs the profit value of each feature isn't clear or measurable (or even considered). The value proposition isn't ""please add feature X, so we can generate Y in sales"". It's ""We want feature X, tells us the Y dollars cost"". In that case ""Y"" should be what the freelancer wants to earn, and what the freelancer thinks the client is willing to pay."
freelance,36jvnz,GSto,1 point,Wed May 20 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"True. Value isn't always so clear cut, but that doesn't mean it isn't present. If you are adding value, in most cases the larger the company, the larger the value provided. It isn't because they can afford it (even though they can), it's because it's worth more to them. In your example, ""Y"" shouldn't be a number, but a follow up question as to why the client is requesting the feature and what outcome they are hoping for."
freelance,36jvnz,gravitycore,1 point,Thu May 21 00:12:59 2015 UTC,"I agree! I've been burned by fixing pricing so much lately.

I would never have ""tiers"" like this for different clients: I do the same quality of work for everyone, and my time is no less valuable depending on who hires me. I do like offering an incentive for clients to hire me for longer term projects though, because that makes my scheduling life easier and they think they are getting a good deal. Food for thought."

freelance,36jvnz,dh42com,2,Tue May 19 23:28:28 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you that some clients are dream projects but small budgets. In this scenario, I give them a discount. I let them know my normal charge and also show them how much I'm ""helping"" them with a discount.  Not only does this make the client feel special and recognize you are dedicated to their cause or their concept, it instills good will. If they come back to you in the future (hopefully more successful), they understand your existing rates and won't necessarily expect your discounted rate.  Never drop your rates. It's ok to discount if you're into the project or the client. That being said, raising your rates based on problem clients or, uninteresting or even portfolio damaging work, is a better practice because it actually leads to more hours. So, the way I think about it is this... For a custom WordPress design, my rate my range $2500-5000 (depending on functionality). If the client is a larger or problematic client (meaning more decision makers, hassles, revisions, etc), their rate goes up (because the hours spent will go up). Hope that makes sense....  It's better to be a $100/hr freelancer that gave a 50% discount (which by the way looks awesome to the client) than a $35/hr freelancer. Starting your new clients at that rate will only generate new $35/hr clients and devalues your overall work.  *Note: you may actually be a $35/hr designer. We don't know your skill set or experience. So, my $100/hr may be extreme based on your experience. But, if you're skilled enough to charge a company $125-300/hr, you're certainly capable of upping your base price to $50-75."

freelance,36bo89,jacevishus,12,Mon May 18 02:05:15 2015 UTC,"I will assume you are in the USA.   I know that I have to charge the client a certain amount of tax based on location on top of the fee for the website   Typically no.  Services like design and programming are not generally subject to sales tax in the US.  As a solo freelancer, you'll probably be a sole-proprietor (you could choose to incorporate as an LLC or S-Corp, but let's assume you're keeping it simple to start.   As a sole-prop freelancer, your personal taxes are fairly simple.  You'll file a 1040 income tax return, just like everyone else.  Since you're self-employed, things are little more complicated, but not much.  Instead of wages, your income will be your business profit, which means when you file your taxes, you will file a Schedule C form (""Profit & Loss from a Business"").  You're correct that you should talk to a CPA.  It's not expensive.  You can probably get a free consultation now, and then go back and pay them to prepare your tax return next year (which will cost less than $500.  If that seems like a lot of money for a once-a-year expense, you should reconsider working for yourself).  If you don't want to bother the CPA right now, and want to play it safe, do the following:   Open a separate bank account for the business.  It doesn't need to be anything special, just a checking account in your name (but I'll refer to it as the ""business"" account). Invoice you clients, and deposit funds into the business account.  Keep track of invoices and when they were paid. Pay yourself 65% of that amount, deposited into your personal account, leaving 35% in the biz account. Keep records of things you buy that might possibly be related to the business, and save receipts.  Also keep track of how much you pay for personal health insurance, and any medical bills you pay.  Keep the records in a spreadsheet, include a note about the purchase, the date, and amount.   One the new year rolls around, you should start receiving 1099s from people you've done work for.  Compare them to your invoices/deposits and make sure the amount they reported paying you is correct.  Once you have all the 1099s, you can go see your CPA, and they'll ask you questions.  You'll have answers for them, since you did such a good job keeping records.  They'll be able to tell you which expenses are deductible, etc.  Your CPA will prepare your returns, and probably even submit them for you electronically. They'll give you an invoice, and you'll pay them (and make an entry in your spreadsheet, since that's a business expense which you'll deduct next year!).  Then you'll write checks (from the business account) to pay the tax due.  There should be more than enough funds in the business account to pay the tax due.  Any money left over (that was deposited in the previous year) you can pay to yourself -- it's functionally the same as the refund you get back from the IRS as a wage-earned whose employer withholds tax from your paycheck.  Don't be scared, it's actually quite straight-forward.  After the first year, you'll have a lot more confidence about it.  Your CPA will probably tell you that you should start paying estimated taxes quarterly.  You're technically obligated to do that, but in practice I've never heard of anyone getting in trouble for failing to do so.    EDIT for some random thoughts   If you're not sure if something is a business expense, assume it is.  Make a note in your records to ask your CPA about it. If you're working from home, set up an office area and use it ""exclusively"" for business purposes.  Quotes around ""exclusively"" because you can get away with playing a video game or two at your desk without screwing yourself.  But you can't write off your kitchen because you sometimes work from the kitchen table.  You will be allowed to deduct a percentage of your rent.  Take a photo of the space looking appropriately business-y, just in case you need to prove it. Consider telecom/internet stuff business expenses until your CPA tells you otherwise. If you have decent credit, consider getting a credit card to dedicate to business purposes.  It can just be a regular personal credit card, or it could be a business-oriented product (say, the Chase Ink product).  Use it for every business-related purchase.  That way, you can use your statements to verify your records. You can pay business expenses out of the business account (or use the business account to pay off the business credit card) if you want to.  But for the first year, I'd advise you to keep the full 35% there until after you pay your taxes. The wiki for this sub has some good stuff, including a link to this, which is chock-full of good info."

The 'trouble' will very likely be a small fine later on down the road, if ever, but unless you're well in to the six figures, the fines aren't likely going to be anything substantial anyway.  I don't advocate people not do it, but... I made erratic payments (due to erratic income) for a few years - haven't had any issues yet.  I'm making more regular payments now due to a quarterly payroll process in place."
freelance,36bo89,mgkimsal,3,Mon May 18 03:30:39 2015 UTC,"Good advice here, but I would suggest talking to an accountant or a SCORE counselor and not skipping that step. A consultation with an accountant isn't expensive and they can get you set up on how to pay estimates.  Depending on where you live (Assuming somewhere in the USA), your state may require charging sales tax on services. Ohio tried this thing either last year or the year before. Luckily, it was shut down before it became law. Your state may have some obscure laws regarding work in your state or across state lines.  I would also suggest saving back damn near 50% of what you bring in.  One more point I would like to make is to write off everything (legitimately) possible. You need a computer and internet access for your job so it's an expense. You need phone service to call clients, expense. Need an iPad to review sites to make sure they are mobile compliant, you betcha, it's an expense. Your accountant will tell you if you're pushing any boundaries.  Good luck (to the OP)"

So, what you say is that filling a lawsuit against my client, in case he do not fulfill some term in the contract if something goes wrong with the project (like not paying the kill fee) is more expensive since it is at a international level?  Then, why would I have a contract with a client if I cannot enforce it when things go wrong?"
freelance,36bz8x,dh42com,3,Mon May 18 05:05:55 2015 UTC,"Then, why would I have a contract with a client if I cannot enforce it when things go wrong?   Exactly my point.   Let us dissect this situation. I am just going to make up the locations, yours could be totally different. We will say you are in the US and your client is in the UK.  So you get the job and you want your client to sign your contract, no problem. They do, but then the end comes and they don't pay, how do you work that out?  There are a couple of ways the situation can go, but all of them are going to be expensive. In your contract you can claim that your jurisdiction's courts are the arbitrators, most people do this. But what happens if you have a client with no US assets that never plans on coming to the US? They most likely will not show, you will get a default judgement. That is great, but how are you going to collect? The court that issued the judgement is not recognized in the country they live in.   The best possible way to handle it is to go to their country and sue them. That is going to be a pain in the ass and expensive. It could end up costing $10k or more. What if you get there all ready for the trial and they continue it until next month? Do you know if you are required to have a lawyer?  What if it gets continued multiple times? But the big kicker is since your contract was drawn up by a lawyer in the US, what if you make it to trial and their is something in it that is void in that countries legal system and it nullifies your whole contract? You might be out the money they owe you, your travel and legal expenses, and your clients legal expenses too. But lets say you win. That can go one of three ways. The client can pay you right there for everything. Or they cannot have the money and not be able to pay. Or they can have the money and not pay, forcing you to handle everything through a debt collector. He will more than likely take about 30% of anything he recovers.   So it really often comes down to asking yourself with all of those things in play is it even worth suing your client? I would say that you do need a contract, even if to just limit your liability, but don't think that is is a magical piece of paper that will make scummy people give you money. You will be disappointed if you think that."

Say I am your client and I pay you, then I want a refund and you say no. I can either go to Paypal who is generally more fair to you, since most times digital goods are not covered under buyer protection. Or I can call my credit card company directly. Some credit cards advertise that they have no hassle charge backs, or a very low bar like Amex's is if you are dissatisfied for any reason. So ultimately what happens is the person files a dispute with the card, not paypal. The card reverses the charge, and paypal charges you. I think it is silly people expect paypal to eat all of the charge backs, they would never make a penny that way. They have to pass them on. But basically they are put in a position where they have no choice to defend the charge back, so it happens outside of their control. The most they can do is cancel the buyers account, which they do."

freelance,368wp9,dh42com,3,Sun May 17 17:35:37 2015 UTC,"No it's too unstable.   I used to deal a lot in BTC and one day I would do some work for 5BTC, which was around $3000, next week the 5 BTC can be $2000.   It's also too easy to scam people, and I don't think buyers will ever trust BTC online. It's completely irreversible currency, meaning if I pay for something, and I don't get it, there's nothing at all I can do to track them down or get my money back, like with PP or similar."
freelance,368wp9,adaamr,1 point,Sun May 17 09:54:53 2015 UTC,"He's a seller so it's actually good for him. The issues around scamming people are easily solved by using escrow services. Obviously it's not perfect, no payment method is.  With regards to price stability, it's been pretty stable as of late and it's a personal decision whether you want to hold the funds in Bitcoin or just convert them over to FIAT as soon as you get it, thereby eliminating any real currency fluctuations."
freelance,368wp9,powdermike,2,Sun May 17 10:35:18 2015 UTC,"The issue is buyers trusting. I offered BTC for a while, along side PP and on site CC processing, and not a single person used BTC. If you are trying to rely on it solely, you're going to lose a lot of customers. OFC it depends on the market, but it's pretty pointless to implement for most.  The price fluctuations can be avoided somewhat, but it's still not worth implementing right now. If somebody can pay in BTC, they can also pay with a debit/credit card. Likely that's how they acquired their BTC in the 1st place."
freelance,368wp9,adaamr,0,Sun May 17 10:48:09 2015 UTC,"If you are buying something from the internet and do not trust the seller, you can get scammed. This is true. Use escrow services for these situations, which is essentially what PP and CC companies are doing for you.  Bitcoin is basically cash for the internet. There is no one to give your money back if you give it to someone trying to scam you, unless you take precautions up front."
freelance,368wp9,dmp1ce,1 point,Sun May 17 11:52:56 2015 UTC,"OK But from a business point of view, you want to integrate something that requires potential clients to find Escrow or MM service, and your competition will use PP or accept a CC or wire?  BTC is fine to offer as an alternative, but my own experiments of using it in an existing company, failed pretty miserably. This was in a company selling computers. Like I said before, nobody wanted to use it, so we stopped functionality pretty quickly.   I did freelance work in the past using BTC. I did website development along with server pentesting, and often accepted BTC. I've played around with multiple crypto currencies and rented out servers a long time ago, mining BTC and LTC. The hash rates are too high for it to be profitable now, though. I'm saying this so hopefully you understand, I'm not speaking from ignorance here, rather from experience with it.  Fact is though, BTC is not cash, it's not currency. It's more similar to owning a stock. It's great for investing, as it fluctuates so much, but it's certainly not reliable, or something I personally would incorporate into a business again, unless of course, some drastic changes were to take place."
freelance,368wp9,adaamr,1 point,Sun May 17 12:13:40 2015 UTC,"If I was going to build an mainstream online store then I would also only consider bitcoin as an alternative option. Unless you are sure your customers want to pay with bitcoin, I wouldn't have that as my only option.  You are mostly looking at the exchange rate from BTC to USD it sounds like. That is a valid concern. But others might be more interested in the privacy bitcoin can offer. In that way bitcoin is much more like cash than a stock. A stock isn't very private and is not easily tradeable. Bitcoin can be very private and is easily tradeable.  Also, in many situations, bitcoin might be the only or cheapest option. For instance, anyone who does not have access to a bank account may only be able to use bitcoin or a prepaid cash card. If you are doing business to business deals internationally, then bitcoin is also an attractive choice because it cuts down on fees and is much faster to process.  I think it is worth it for everyone interested in doing business online to at least familiarize themselves with bitcoin. It will likely only become more popular into the future."
freelance,368wp9,dmp1ce,1 point,Sun May 17 14:30:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, an alternative there's not much reason not too, apart from the hassle of it all, and the fact there's no point. I don't know any legal market where all customers would prefer BTC either, or even majority.   I'm not from the US, I'm from the UK, but the point still stands.   If you don't have access to a bank account, why should anyone want to do business with you.  BTC is not attractive for international, because you have to buy BTC in order to do that, and buying $300 in BTC, will cost around $320 in my experience. You can make international transfers with many companies for next to nothing. https://transferwise.com/ is 1 of those.  It won't become more popular, it passed that point a long time ago in my opinion, as is reflected in the value.  I meant it's more like stock in the fact it's not a currency.

Sometime payment processors have the option of bitcoin like Shopify. Enabling that shouldn't be too much of a hassle.   I don't know any legal market where all customers would prefer BTC either, or even majority.   Excluding illegal markets is excluding a large chuck of the market. Even so, some legal markets still prefer bitcoin. Amagi metals was doing a lot of sales in bitcoin in 2013. Some gambling sites accept bitcoin exclusively. Gambling isn't illegal in many places. VPN providers often accept bitcoin although I don't know how much of the sales comes from bitcoin. VPNs are not illegal.   If you don't have access to a bank account, why should anyone want to do business with you.   Maybe you are too young to get a bank account. Maybe you don't want to keep your money in a bank. Why would you want to exclude customers just because they don't have a bank account?

I've never heard of that before. You can buy bitcoins at ""next to nothing"" markup if you buy from Coinbase. I'm in the US. Here, every wire transfer I have heard of costs between $10 to $50. The delay can be up to 3 days too.  It is true that bitcoins are often marked up when buying, but you can also sometimes get some of the value back when selling into your local currency. Here we have locals who offer 105% for each bitcoin.   It won't become more popular, it passed that point a long time ago in my opinion, as is reflected in the value.   Why won't bitcoin become more popular over time? The trend has been for it to be used more and more every year. Here is an example. http://blog.bitpay.com/2014/12/09/bitcoin-black-friday-2014-recap.html Are you saying that this year the trend is going to stop?   I meant it's more like stock in the fact it's not a currency. It doesn't have a fixed value.   Nothing has a fixed value when compared to anything else. If you are saying bitcoin is volatile, then that is usually true. But very few things stay stable forever. Gold has probably had the most stable value for anything I can think of. Time will tell if bitcoin's volatility is more like a stock or like gold."

Putting a note on the money request is a good start. Other ideas: Provide the customer with a unique link to download their purchase. With web site logs that check when the download link is hit.    When a chargeback is requested you can dispute it. And during this process what you can prove is of utmost importance.   Of course, if the items are small ticket, you might just want to consider chargebacks the cost of doing business."

I instantly sent PP a copy of the email chain saying ""Here is the project,"" and the response ""Thanks for your work on ____"".

(Can't call it a business expense if it's labeled as ""gift for family or friends"").  Charge backs are the clients only protection against sketchy freelancers. If you're afraid of chargebacks, document your conversations, what you sent them, and better yet send them unique links that verify if they have been downloaded. If you feel PayPal isn't helping you, chances are that you're bad at business and didn't properly document your transactions.

freelance,368ea2,markangelbrandt,1 point,Sun May 17 17:40:17 2015 UTC,"I think planning ahead depends entirely on your personality.  If you got into freelancing, chances are there's at least a slight part of you that enjoys the flexibility it affords. You keep your own hours, you take on the workload you can manage and, hopefully, you enjoy the work you're doing. Some people enjoy having all the minutiae planned out in absolute detail, so they know exactly how much money needs to/is coming in so they can live the life that they want. Others are more laid back, they take the flexibility and run with it. Some months they work hard and have less of a social life, other months they do less work, and can relax because they know they've got it covered from the previous or later months they can make it up.  Where I personally stand is somewhere between the two. I love the fact that, assuming my workload is comfortable enough, I can relax every so often without having to negotiate with a boss for time off. But at the same time, it's helpful being aware of your situation and requirements, rather than hoping to wing it month by month. So I'd say keep a system, absolutely, but sticking to it regimentally month in month out may detract from the joy of freelancing. Just my thoughts."
freelance,368ea2,mcavaliere,1 point,Sun May 17 22:13:10 2015 UTC,"The way you work is a bit different (in an awesome way) from others who freelance for hire. In typical freelance, we get a contract (often of a specific length...1 month, 2 months, etc). So based on that, it's a little easier to plan since you know roughly when you're starting and finishing a contract.   In your case, you're creating and selling your own products, which much be rewarding in an altogether different way. But it means you can't predict the type of work you'll be doing in the future in the same way.   I'd start by looking at the books you're creating. Which topics (1) do you enjoy writing the most which also (2) are most successful? Find the pattern and it'll tell you where your focus is.   I think that focus can be leveraged to tell you what you might be working on a month or two from now. If you keep banging out 1-2 books per week, and you see a formula that works, I bet you can take that info and create a plan for a larger 1-2 month project that will be successful.   Reading some Nathan Barry and Chris Guillebeau might give you good insights on this too, those guys talk a lot about content products and their structure for creating them."

Taxes are going to be outrageous. That $6k a month is going to to be more like $3.8k a month after paying taxes. Going to have to pay for health insurance. Open some sort of retirement plan and put, at minimum, 6% each month into it. You must pay for and maintain your own equipment.

You mention that you have prior experience in doing freelance work already; I guess the question is whether the career switch to full-time freelancing is going to be fulfilling for you in the areas that you aren't happy with right now.  I can tell it you that it can be exceedingly difficult at times (where that financial safety net comes into place).  If the situation of being a full-time freelancer fulfills the areas of your career where you don't feel challenged or are bored, then go with it. You sound like you have the actionable skills and experience to make it happen."

If you want to further minimize the risks, you can work with a trusted consultancy company on your first project. They have contracts to protect you and make sure you get paid in time.

How good are you at marketing/getting clients. This part is as important as your technical skills.  Secondly its not either/or. Keep your current job and start freelancing at the side.

freelance,362icy,faxseedoil,9,Fri May 15 15:29:41 2015 UTC,Kinda a little bit of both. I'm a video production freelancer so I may have more wiggle room than others. For any job I sent out an estimate with the crew and gear I would like to bring on to a shoot. Often they say that's too high so I whittle down the crew and gear to what I actually need. If the prospective client asks for something even cheaper I usually will just opt out.   Often I'll send a high - medium - low budgets to proposals and examples of what you can get with each. Most often the client chooses the medium.
freelance,362icy,robmneilson,8,Fri May 15 16:35:39 2015 UTC,"Price it for what you're worth, and talk about budget at the end of the first phone call.   My typical sales call flow:  1) ""Tell me about your business.""  Get an idea of who they are and what they're about. If you don't get a good feeling from this response (e.g. they can't describe what they do, won't share anything without an NDA), immediately implement a 4x multiplier on any subsequent prices.   4x. For real. You'll need all those extra hours if your client can't even tell you what their business is.   2) ""How do you see this project contributing to your business?""  This is where you figure out what you're actually doing. Guide them toward concrete answers: ""We want to get more people contacting us for more info.""  That answer tells us it's a lead generation website. Now you can follow up and figure out more about what you'll be doing to make that happen.  3) Tell them how to solve their problems.  All the details. Tell 'em exactly how you'd do it. Just keep the explanation in Average Human Words.  This is how you show that you're exactly the right person for the job. You see the problems and the solutions. They'll understand what you said, but be unsure how to get it done. Now they know they need you.   (And the small percentage of people who can implement your recommendations on their own will remember that you were helpful and smart; referrals are worth more than landing a client sometimes.)  4) Figure out how much success is worth.  Are they capturing leads? How much is a lead worth? Is each new client worth $300, and they convert 1 in 4 leads? Then each lead is worth about $75.   How many leads per month do they get now? What does their traffic look like?  You're figuring this out so you can work up the break-even cost after you give prices. If I know they're getting 8 leads a month off a shitty website with a 1,000 hits, I feel confident we can at least quadruple that number.   That's an extra $2,400/month if they keep converting leads to customers at the rate they claimed earlier.  Now the client is doing mental math and seeing piles of cash in their future.   5) Ballpark the cost.  I always say something like, ""I'll have to write up a full estimate to be sure, but my gut says this'll cost about...""  I know how much a week of my time costs, and I know about how long each thing I'll be building will take. Freelancer Math (guessed hours x rate x 1.5) gives me an approximation, and I'll typically give a range of about 20% on either side (e.g. if I end up at $10,000, I ballpark $8–12K).  Since you already set up how the return on investment will work, you can then tell them that this project will pay for itself with new leads in about 4–5 months. Faster if they implement the extra marketing ideas you'll be giving them.  Make the price a secondary consideration.  If you set up a good understanding of the problem and show a clear path to a solution — plus the benefits of that solution — the client will be thinking far less about price than about how great this project will be for her business.   If you're selling on price as a freelancer, you're already fucked. Sell on value; that's what makes us different from DIY software and race-to-the-bottom commodity providers."

I calculate their value.   I always start by asking a client what their budget is - if it's $400, I don't want to price myself too low by saying $200. If it's a $50 budget, then I know that I probably don't want to take the job."
freelance,362icy,budgetchick,3,Fri May 15 21:59:38 2015 UTC,"I look at the requirements and through a round about number out before anything. This qualifies people and wastes less time.

freelance,362icy,manys,2,Fri May 15 17:27:26 2015 UTC,"Right. I have been doing this long enough that I can hip shoot a price to someone saying it will be above x amount, let me know if that is in your budget."
freelance,362icy,dh42com,2,Fri May 15 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"What are you worth? Make your stand and stick to it. If the budget is too far below your standard then you could say ""Bob, I know you've put some thought and time into coming up with this budget, I'm concerned because our typical budget for a project like this is normally X. I'm ok if that doesn't work for you, should we keep talking or is that a deal breaker? You'll want to qualify them and get a hard ""no"" out of the way. If it isn't a show stopper then you have a clear opportunity to talk about ""VALUE"" rather than the price. Value is where you help them understand you depth of knowledge and experience and all the problems that come with a cheaper solution. But it's all centered on pain.  If you haven't yet, I highly recommend taking sales training. I've been selling creative technical services for over 15 years and I can tell you, most of the freelancers I meet are chum in the water to sharks. They all say the same thing. ""I hate sales"" or ""I'm not a sales guy"". Let me tell you, the minute you decide to get trained and keep training in business development is the minute you become a true professional. Once you do, questions like these will become excellent opportunities to take business away from the also-rans who won't. Just my 2¢."

I mean, if I know the clients planned budget, I'll try to work within it, and deliver what is fair.  If they are unreasonable (or just over eager), and wanting more functionality or features than they're will to pay for, it's tricky.  So, generally, yes... if the client has reasonable expectations, I'll work towards the planned budget.  If they want the world, I'll say screw-it, and propose what is fair and reasonable, even it it's above their budget."

freelance,362ibe,opalgreen,2,Fri May 15 15:29:17 2015 UTC,"I would definitely accept Project A, since there's always the possibility of B and/or C being pushed further down the road or even scrapped entirely. It's happened plenty of times to me.  If Project B and C do happen, I would assess my situation then. If I'm still slammed with work from Project A and find it difficult to dedicate enough time to the others, I would talk with the clients for B and C and explain the situation, telling them you can work on their projects in a few days / weeks. In my experience, most clients are understanding and will agree to that. But there's the possibility that they either need the project to be worked on now or simply don't like being told to wait and the project is taken away from you. I think this is a risk you must be willing to take.  In short - take the projects that you can work on now, don't rely on future work since life happens and things can change quickly.  Edit: This is assuming you want to work on all three projects. If you think Project A is not good for you (since you do mention dropping 'a bad project' in your last scenario), you should seriously think of not taking it at all. Again, that's another risk you need to think about."
freelance,362ibe,degeneratepr,1 point,Fri May 15 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you need project A right away. Take it, build up some money in the bank.   My thinking is that whenever you're low on cash, building up some is your priority. Once the cash runs out, it's game over.   As far as how to handle B or C if they come about, cross that bridge when you come to it - but come up with a plan and be ready.   If and when that time coems, I recommend against Dropping project A. If you're worried about it preventing you from taking on other projects, see if you can negotiate a shorter term conract with the client right now. (I tend to go for 1-2 month projects in general - be upfront and flexible, and they're often receptive.) If they're not open to that, ask if they're comfortable having you pull on help for the project (either right now, or in a month or two). Let them know it's in your best interest (since it ensures coverage in case anyone gets sick; in case the timeline changes; and since having a second pair of eyes is a good thing in general for work quality)  So that said, when project B or C come along, you have a few options to deal with them since you've set expectations with the client as best as possible. But at the end of the day I'd take project A.   Lastly: I strongly recommend this: build up enough in the bank (enough to last a few months without work), and you can be more picky about projects. I always do this, so that if I have a dry spell for a bit, I'm not desparate. This gives me the ability to work on more of the things I enjoy, and less of the things I don't."
freelance,362ibe,mcavaliere,1 point,Thu May 21 19:43:10 2015 UTC,"I have found that 1 month turns into 7 months very often. I accept A and see how you feel when B or C come to fruition. Never count a project into your schedule until the signed contract is in hand.  When I first started, I had about a dozen projects come in one month. I thought that I would land them all immediately but that did not happen. They staggered throughout the year. Almost drove me to the bankruptcy court."
freelance,35zcax,freelancerrant,23,Thu May 14 19:56:03 2015 UTC,"What does it say in your contract or on your invoice? If payments are due upon receipt, it should be printed on the invoice for you to refer to.  I agree that it's bullshit that the're pulling this and that they think they're being generous but, it kind of comes down to whether or not you want to continue working with them in the future. If you do, then you wait it out and continue waiting it out each time. If you don't, then push back and point out that they said they paid monthly and that you send all invoices to collections after the 45th day, which is just ""standard"". Feel free to point out that they don't get to pay 60-90 days after they go to the grocery store, get their hair cut, rent is due, etc.  You might also consider adding a schedule for late fees in your contract, getting people to initial/sign that they have read and understand the payment terms and then enforcing the late fees. Even though my invoices say due upon receipt, I have a few occasional clients that like to wait as long as they can and I've found that sending out an automated email, warning them that fees are about to start accumulating, gets most of them to pay pretty quickly."

I'm just annoyed with their lack of transparency and the attitude that essentially says that I should be grateful to receive payment at all.   I like the idea of playing hardball and enforcing my invoice terms (which I marked as ""due upon receipt"" after being told they pay monthly with no mention of delay) but in reality, I am just  small cog in a very large wheel, and there are a thousand writers who would be glad to replace me.

Large companies typically pay all invoices on a net 30 basis and even then you sometimes dont get paid until 45 days later. Very large companies (somewhat unehtically) can keep you waiting for 90 days or more.    Either a) dont work for this company or b) understand this is how the world works and plan for it.   if you really feel they are not transparent or have been a little unethical here, then go for option a (after all we live in a capitalist society). But most likely you will need to go for option b like the rest of us who contract to large companies. Afte 30 days be proactive in chasing payment down.

I know they're good for it.  From my experience as a former developer at a large corporation and as a freelancer working with a few large corporations, they can be pretty slow to turn around payments for invoices. Generally the person receiving it has to sign off, then their manager, and sometimes that person's manager (at this point a VP or whatever). It then will go to an accounting department for review where it can be sent back for clarification or may need further approval (depending on cost or policies). Then, they send the funds are cut as a check and mailed or directly deposited. That's just the nature of the beast.  That being said, if you have a good working relationship and need access to the funds, sometimes you can coerce them into using their corporate card.

freelance,35zcax,springer70,3,Fri May 15 00:45:38 2015 UTC,"Standard freelance payment is 60-90, so we are very generous in this respect.   No it isn't. Standard is 15-30 days. Anything past 30 and I'm hammering the phones asking why I've not been paid. I've no idea why companies think they're justified in hanging on to my money for 3 months.  Get a contract stipulating net 30 payment terms. Anything more, charge them late fees. Don't put up with that bullshit."
freelance,35zcax,sonofaresiii,2,Fri May 15 15:53:27 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of replies talking about contracts, and while I sort of agree, it's also toothless.  The harsh reality is that you are not paid like an employee.  You are paid by Accounts Payable, and many many many companies have internal policies that they don't pay invoices until they are 30, 40 or even 90 days old (it depends on their own cash flow management -- in fact, generally, the longer they take to pay, the more severe their cash flow problems might be).    I don't mean to sound unsympathetic, far from it. I'm very aware, and have been in your very situation (or worse), but your contract won't help you in this case.  It's simply a matter of knowing how quickly your various clients pay, and living with it.    The really harshness I've experienced is a client that went from paying quickly, to having cash flow problems, and then not paying quickly at all.  I went from being paid within 30 days, to having invoices sit for almost 90 days unpaid.  It also happened at tax time, where I was owing, and I also had some medical bills (10k) add up.  It was the worst possible timing.   But I'm thankful I'm a saver, and had been given advice early in my freelance career to have at least 5 to 6 months of living expenses saved up in cash for cushion and contingency.   I agree, the language in their reply (that you should be thankful for their 'generous' policy of paying within 30-40 days), is condescending and arrogant to say the least.  But, now you know what to expect.  I should also say that these 'rules' can be broken.  When I was working in the corporate world paying for freelancers, I would always ensure the freelancer invoices would get paid on the next cheque run (in other words, paid as fast as possible), but I needed to make a special request to Accounts Payable to make that happen, and it doesn't surprise me that many people don't know this is an option.   It sucks.  I know... but it just might be one of those things that you need to live with."
freelance,35zcax,springer70,3,Thu May 14 23:23:32 2015 UTC,"The point of a contract isn't to force the company to follow it. The point of a contract is to make sure your terms are acceptable to them, and to point out your agreement after the fact.  Most companies aren't going to sign a contract and then say ""TOO BAD, SUE ME SUCKA!""  In all likelihood if OP were to show them a contract, right now, signed by whomever hired him that says he would be paid within 30 days, they'd say ""Oh, okay"" and send the payment. They'd probably then tell the guy who hired OP to stop signing contracts that go against their policy.  More likely, they'd have just never signed that contract in the first place because it's against their policy, which is exactly what contracts are meant to do."
freelance,35zcax,sonofaresiii,1 point,Fri May 15 14:15:49 2015 UTC,"While I agree, in theory... in practice, this is not quite what happens in a lot of companies (not speaking for the OP's company, only from personal experience).   In my experience, company managers (who typically hire freelancers), may or may not know what the Accounts Payable policies are, and happily (and ignorantly) sign all sorts of contracts.  A/P policies also change (frequently), with respect to when payments are made, and they simply don't care what historical contracts have in them.    So, the reality is that because companies often change payable policies, they quite often DO end up saying ""too bad, sucka"".  Not because they're evil or nasty, it's just that payable terms in hundreds of individual freelancer contracts are really quite inconsequential, and simply too difficult to track.  The only thing an A/P team will really care about are the ""terms"" on the actual invoice, and even then, they often disregard them.  It's very common for an A/P department to get an invoice with ""Terms: Please Pay Immediately"", and even still, wait to pay it when they please (and never pay a late fee, either -- those are a waste of time).  Again ... this all depends on the company you're working with.  Some are far more respectful than others."
freelance,35zcax,bacontreatz,3,Fri May 15 14:38:05 2015 UTC,"To be clear, I'm not at all talking about the terms on an invoice. I'm talking about an agreement made before the project started. Terms on an invoice are meaningless.  And I want to preface this next part with: If those are your experiences, those are your experiences and I'm not at all discounting them.   But to share my experiences, what usually happens is if you show them an agreement made between a rep of the company (the person who hired you) and the freelancer, they'll usually abide by that as closely as they can. Meaning, if your contract says 14 days upon receipt, maybe it'll be sixteen days until they get the check out. Or something. But typically, if they see an agreement is already in place, I've found they won't just disregard it.  However, like I said, in the unlikely event that happens they'll probably then go tell the guy to stop signing contracts he shouldn't. But what I've found is more likely is the rep hiring you won't agree to terms that are against policy or that deal with policy he's not aware of.  Usually for the work I do where these kinds of things happen, it's a smaller operation, just a couple guys. So it's easier for one guy to confidently sign a contract, because he's usually the boss of whoever's paying out. This means it's also usually pretty easy to resolve the situation, when the hiring guy (boss) just says ""Hey go pay this guy.""  In the case of bigger companies, I've found the guy hiring me doesn't even have anything to do with the actual contract-- it's sent by someone else in the company who is totally aware of any policies (and policy changes), which is why this situation doesn't usually occur. You tell the person signing the contract ""But I always do net 30"" and they'll say ""Well our contract is net 60, sign it or move along.""  Again, those are my experiences, and if yours are different, fair enough."
freelance,35zcax,thisdesignup,2,Fri May 15 14:48:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're being treated unfairly here. ""Due on Receipt"" is very ambiguous and IMHO a poor choice for payment terms. It's basically saying ""pay me as soon as you possibly can"", which in practice means your invoice will be at the mercy of whatever the standard payment schedule the client maintains. With a bigger company that can easily be NET 60 or NET 90, and you've given yourself precious little to stand on (if your payment is due ""ASAP"", how many days is it overdue?)  For example at my agency when we receive a ""due on receipt"" invoice we automatically treat it as NET 30 and I think it's reasonable for your client to do the same. That's a pretty standard timeframe to pay an invoice.  My agency invoices NET 15 because it seems to get us paid faster on average and let's remind clients about overdue invoices sooner.   If you are expecting to get paid on a certain date, you're going to have to pre-arrange that with the client, and likely invoice them in advance for it go through accounts payable. Another option is to skip A/P and charge their corporate card. That can work well when it's a monthly recurring fee for a certain set $ amount."
freelance,35zcax,thisdesignup,2,Fri May 15 12:54:41 2015 UTC,"Are you a freelancer or an employee. If you are a freelancer then you should be the one who decides when you get paid. Was there an agreement/contract before hand that stated how and when you would get paid? If not I would remain silent because you could easily hurt your business relationship. If you had a contract, or had not sent the work, then you would have some ground to get paid. Otherwise it sounds like you let them have the control and so they get to make the decision.      Now I'm a little irked that they didn't bother to be fully transparent and TELL me that they don't pay right away   P.S. if you are a freelancer it is your responsibility to figure out how and when you are getting paid. Why would you leave that up to the client? After all it's your business that could use the money. Just for future reference make sure you know everything on your own merit. I wouldn't wait for clients to tell you. Ask them or come up with your own guidelines for things like payment."
freelance,35zcax,dh42com,3,Thu May 14 20:49:57 2015 UTC,"as stated in the OP, I did inquire about the payment terms when I landed the gig and was told that they pay monthly. I am  freelancer, not an employee. In my experience, when a company already has many freelancers getting paid on the same schedule, they aren't willing to bend for the preferences of just 1 one person. And I'm actually fine with it, to a degree, I just didn't appreciate the attitude."
freelance,35zcax,ihugyou,0,Thu May 14 20:54:45 2015 UTC,"Ah I read the post but did miss that you had already inquired about payment. Yea that attitude would make me a bit upset too but others have probably gone along with their practices and so they feel justified in it. You could say something but if you already agreed to waiting at the beginning then it could come off in a bad way.    In my experience, when a company already has many freelancers getting paid on the same schedule, they aren't willing to bend for the preferences of just 1 one person.   Just curious, then that means you bend your preferences?"

freelance,35z6ag,dh42com,1 point,Thu May 14 21:12:25 2015 UTC,"This is how my retainer clients generally work. We agree on an amount of hours, like say 40 a month. I figure what rate I want to put them at for that block of time.  I usually discount it off the normal rate, but I don't have a professional formula. It involves things like how hard the work is, if I like them, ect. I ask them up front if they are wanting m-f normal working hours or what kind of agreement they are looking for. The rate structure I use is 1x for normal business, 2x for after hours, 2.5x for weekends. But you are billing against their hours, not against money. But it is important to nail down the SLA that they want and charge them based on that. I haven't had one yet, but if I get a client that wants a 24/7 SLA with 1 hour response, I would go about 3 times normal rate for the block and bill the same as above against it. The reason being is that you are literally tied to your computer. Tickets to a concert you bought months ago, we are having issues that need to be fixed now... Things like that. You are selling blocks of time that you have no scheduling ability over."

It was strange to have gone through the extensive interview process only to be left without much clue as to how to get a job. I ultimately asked them to remove me from their system, which they did.  My impression was that TopTal is primarily for non-US developers, who are talented programmers (but maybe not as good at business). I'm assuming that my rate ($100/hr at the time) might have been too high to be competitive with other TopTal developers, and I was neglected for that reason.

They create a job, find they made some mistake (in price / description) and just create a new job with the correct info instead of editing the old one."
freelance,35vmfh,carnut88,3,Thu May 14 00:37:03 2015 UTC,They may just want to see how much their project should cost then find a local dev who can come somewhat close to oversea companies. In my experience anyways
freelance,35vmfh,Cythammer,2,Thu May 14 05:58:23 2015 UTC,"It kind of sounds like the problem is as much with Elance's system as with the clients. If, after a certain amount of time Elance would refund credits spent on jobs that never went anywhere, the whole system would be better. But that would cost Elance money, so I don't suppose they have much motivation to change."
freelance,35vmfh,Oax_Mike,2,Thu May 14 21:49:47 2015 UTC,"I think in great part what happens is that clients go on with unrealistic expectations of the quality they can get for $5-10/hour...they hear through the grapevine about elance and want to get in on the overseas outsourcing game but when they actually get the proposals they find out that the low-end guys are actually shit and that the quality freelancers expect to be paid like a professional.  Perhaps they hold on to wait for a diamond in the rough? A qualified person who is just getting started with the freelance game?  But #2 is also a big one...when I first started using elance I always tried to connect offline whenever possible...it is easy to do, you just ask to see their website or give them yours and subtly suggest (not using obvious keywords that could be flagged such as email, telephone, etc) that perhaps it would be mutually beneficial to work direct. Something like ""If you want to limit your commission expense I am sure you can figure it out.""  I definitely earned clients by billing the same rate but saving them the 8.75% but I screwed myself because then it wasn't building my portfolio...as soon as I started to build my elance profile I was literally 5 times more likely to hear back on proposals."
freelance,35vmfh,BrianSeaman,2,Sat May 16 19:06:30 2015 UTC,"I was wondering why so many jobs I'd applied for wind up in the limbo land of ""selecting candidate"" too. I suspect there is no one reason but any of the possible reasons that the original poster of the question identified. I've been on elance for about a year now and to date have only been awarded two small jobs that took me, in total, about four hours of time and for which I was paid in total, $300. On the plus side, both clients were very happy with the work I did for them and gave me great reviews. So my experience here has been this is not a site to rely on with regard to getting steady freelance work, but rather regard it as a small bonus if and when you do get awarded something. A poster alluded to the fact that if you are willing to work for $5/hour, you'll probably get a ton of invites. Whether that was a sarcastic comment or simply a statement borne out of experience, it is, sadly, true."
freelance,35vmfh,cbCode,3,Tue Jun 2 23:16:59 2015 UTC,"I've wondered the same thing as you, and considered the 4 reasons you listed. But I also considered that the job board may also seed their database to make it looks more appealing to freelancers and encourage them to sign up.  They do show the hiring percentage for each job poster however, and I notice tons of new signups all the time.   And alot of these postings appear to be a cookie cutter posting in that they have the same qualifications like ""Good reputation, complete profile..."" I mean it's the exact same wording on alot of these jobs, and the posters are putting up their first job as if they felt required to copy and paste these things.   Other than that, I don't really have an answer."
freelance,35vmfh,cbCode,3,Wed May 13 23:01:53 2015 UTC,"I never thought about the fact that Elance might seed fake job postings. At this point, the site seems popular enough that it wouldn't seem necessary to do so, but who knows.  I didn't realize they showed hiring percentage. I do always check client pages when I apply for jobs on Elance now, though. I learned to do so the hard way.  Recently, I try to avoid those ""cookie cutter"" kind of postings that you mention. I've noticed that, as far as web copy and article writing, there are two kinds of clients for writing jobs. The first are basically content mills. They pay bottom dollar ($2-5 per article) to basically subcontract their own clients' content to freelancers. They tend to have a lot of that boilerplate ""Good reputation, complete profile"" stuff that you mentioned, and they often advertise as great for newbies or beginners. They assign a bunch of random SEO content across a wide variety of industries, with an obvious emphasis on quality over quantity. I avoid the hell out of those, as they're absolutely not worth my time or energy. They're often rather rude to their freelancers, as well. Maybe that's just my experience, but they don't seem to value us very much. In fact, I feel like these guys are a detriment to the entire industry. The usual thinking is that the sub-minimum-wage clients' work goes to foreign nations with a low cost of living, but I've noticed that most of the time, they specify that they're looking for ""native speakers."" So at the end of the day, it's probably a lot of college students and stay-at-home moms who are doing this work. These kinds of workers are probably new to freelancing, and don't realize what their work is worth. I'm a huge advocate of making sure that people who are interesting in getting into freelance writing know what kind of rates are reasonable to charge. The very idea of less than minimum wage for writing, which is a skilled profession, is very concerning to me.  The second type of client tend to be either small businesses that need content, or reputable digital marketing companies who are subcontracting (often with the intent of finding someone for regular longer-term work). They tend to pay reasonably, and to understand that good content has value. I go after clients like these, generally in the healthcare, healthy lifestyle, and digital marketing niches."
freelance,35vmfh,shvelo,4,Thu May 14 00:12:40 2015 UTC,"I've found that raising rates substantially increases the quality of the client. Getting started on those sites is rough, I worked tirelessly for some real assholes. They paid dirt cheap, but they gave me what I wanted - A nice review. Did that til I got around 4 reviews, hiked up my rates and just got job invitations from some quality people.  Then I just got referrals from the quality people.  Be careful though, your profile score is a rolling total of points over a year. If you don't keep pushing work through the site you'll end up back at square one. Although the reviews stay, they aren't tallied in your score."
freelance,35vmfh,simple_peacock,1 point,Thu May 14 01:10:54 2015 UTC,I think this kind of behavior should be punished by Elance
freelance,35vmfh,TheKevinSTL,3,Thu May 14 08:49:52 2015 UTC,Yea but also Elance and similar sites are highly biased towards the clients rather than freelancers. Frankly most of the stuff that goes on there is very disrespectful to freelancers. Then you wonder why there aren't that many quality freelancers on there. Most of the time the number 1 reason clients go on these sites is because they want something cheap. It's basically where you go to get cheap labour.  Not saying you can't do well on these sites as a freelancer (a few really do well) but with the time and effort to get there you may as well build an asset such as your own audience/ website / subscriber list off Elance.
freelance,35w150,ccricers,3,Wed May 13 23:55:13 2015 UTC,"Read through this sub about those websites. You'll see lots of advice about not trying to compete with cheap guys. This is sound advice. Stick with your rate, you'll look realistic to people who know what they're looking for. People who know what they're looking for though are rare on those sites.  Anyway, keep a normal rate. You really do not want to work for people who would hire someone for that low.  Source: I am a backend dev, just finishing up a contract on oDesk, went in with a rate 30% less than I would normally charge, found work fast because of it, but I have never worked with such a clueless client before. Not even sure how her business is still running."

freelance,35w150,JohnLeePettimore,2,Thu May 14 02:24:17 2015 UTC,"A agree with /u/monowolf about sticking to your rate. I took a few jobs on Elance when I just started out just to get a feel for the site and make a few extra bucks. The clients that don't want to pay on those sites are not worth the time and effort. Stick to your rate or at least close to it and bid on jobs you would bid on if they were out in the wild.  If a client is looking for cheap devs and willing to hire from overseas, they are going to do it. Don't waste any effort on jobs like that. Find the ones that are specifically looking for people in the US or Canada (if you're from there...) and you will likely be dealing with clients that are specifically avoiding that kind of cheap labor. There are some good gigs on Elance, but you unfortunately have to sort through a lot of garbage to find them. I have honestly found my best client ever on there, but I have also found my share of stinkers.  As for earning your ""cred,"" I think it exists only in that some clients want reviews or ratings before you can bid. I can't fault people for wanting that as it weeds out the spammy, mass accounts, but it does suck when you are just starting to get your voice heard. If you see any really short term jobs you could bang out real quick in order to get a review or rating, this is the case where I would be willing to lower your rate a tiny bit. Sometimes you just have to get the door open."
freelance,35w150,mnsota,1 point,Thu May 14 04:44:47 2015 UTC,Are you in the US? I ask because it's hard to believe a dev can't find work in this climate.  I've worked full time for the last year on Elance with zero reviews. Pick high value projects and work your ass off and you'll do great.

Revisit old leads, old clients and ask them for 'updates', send friendly messages and be nice about recommending things - even give a few free tips, leaving them wanting more (which translates into hiring the shit out of you).  Don't blog. Don't twitter. Don't social network. Those are secondary thoughts, but not the integral art of finding repeat clients."

YOUR duty is to find out WHY they would want that (you need to come up with a 'benefit list' that translates into a ridiculously compelling amount of benefits) for the client and pitch that to them.  You need to also be asking questions like:  The 5W1H formula:  ""Who are you advertising to? What does your product do for them? Why is it superior to alternative products? How can you prove your case? Where should you advertise to reach prime prospects? When is the best time to reach them?""  You need to be doing this, or you are not going to be getting any business.. if you don't even know your client.

YOU have to find out what works. Test out different methods. The worst thing that can happen is they say no, and you're just back to where you started. Don't be afraid to jump out there.  Introduce yourself. Be straight forward. Tell them what you do and why you're contacting them. Let them know that you're a frequent customer.   As a web designer, or online marketer, it's your job to understand the value that comes with a great website. Convey that value.

If you are dedicated, 3 months is doable.   Most people will want a CMS so that they can update the content themselves, Wordpress is a very popular example but couchCMS is a lot easier, but it requires more development. If you are using a CMS you will need to know a server side language, usually php and will want to understand how the databases work, Wordpress uses MySQL databases."

freelance,35v171,jameswesleyhunt,3,Thu May 14 06:38:27 2015 UTC,As a beginner you should be charging low.

It's better to undercharge and over deliver than the opposite.   I started building websites for $300. That number has increased steadily over the last several years.

When I was a lot younger I went the opposite route (2002ish) and honestly I just got lost because I didn't have anything visual to start with and understand what I was doing. Maybe HTML for Dummies wasn't the best approach? Either way, I highly recommend a CMS and templates to better understand code and how it works.  I also disagree that by using a CMS you don't have to worry about HTML and CSS. That doesn't even make sense to me... I don't think I ever run into a situation where I don't have to change HTML/CSS/PHP with a theme.

Politely let client #1 know that as they've been dragging on for a number of weeks without a clear start/end date to this task you're already booked. Ask for 2 weeks instead of 1 and use it as a chance to transition to a conversation about clearly setting timelines/expectations well in advance for future tasks. Politely let Client #2 know that you have another task on the go and while 3 weeks is ""doable"" you'd prefer 4 weeks if at all possible.   From there, work your ass off:   Split your time between both projects, half day on one, half day on another until the project for client #1 is finished. This will help you balance both responsibilities and ensure both clients see progress while you work your way out of the problem. Once client #1 is finished, haul ass and finish the project for client #2 as quickly as possible. Try to delivery both projects within the initial timelines and only use the extra time you've (hopefully) been given as an emergency overflow.   Lastly, this is a ""good problem to have"" as it means you're doing well and your work is in high demand. To avoid headaches and overloading in the future you may want to start looking for a partner, employee or freelancer to help share overflow work. You might not make as much per project with someone else working with you, but ideally you can still make a margin off of the work they do and expand your business in time.  Hope this helps.

Give them a realistic time when you can get to their project, and make sure to keep in contact with them the entire time up until then.   Worst comes to worst, they get someone else to do this ONE project. You still have the better relationship with them and haven't burned bridges, and not having a stall in employment is a situation anyone can understand. Best case scenario, they realize they were taking advantage of your time and do more to make sure you don't go looking elsewhere for gigs in the future.   To me, this is all better than attempting double hours just so you don't have to communicate. That'll end with two mediocre projects anyways. Nobody wants that.

Work both, then go back to normal hours for the longer project.  It's not a good way of life, certainly not long term viable, but it's part of the territory once in a while.  When you start turning down projects and pushing out deadlines, it becomes part of your reputation.  I'm overcommitted as fuck right now, well beyond the point of fixing it with a week of no sleep, and that's after I've subbed out the obnoxious, tedious bits of everything.    Be careful with these situations, but if there's only a week of overlap you can pull it off.  Just don't make a habit of double booking, you will soon live to regret it.  I wish I had more pleasant advice, but sometimes the rep boost from nailing both projects concurrently is worthwhile, or at least it's worthwhile not getting the rep hit from pushing one off.  The downside of working on referrals is that all my clients know each other in some capacity, and several are good friends.  If I screw one, I've screwed myself entirely.

If you do go this route (or one similar to it) make sure that you're upfront with why you're doing this."

However, funnily enough, he's not for it - he sees his clients as his clients, and any effort to merge our businesses is me trying to take a grab at those or something. You are entirely right though.  There's also the fact that i'm in a salaried position earning 2/3x times what his is earning, and his efforts bring him maybe the equivalent of minimum wage due to the constant race-to-the-bottom / low as possible pricing."

He's not great at math so I do his math homework for him so he can get A's, but he never reads his math book and so will never learn enough to keep getting A's without me, should I keep ""helping"" him?   Or,   My son is 22 and moved back home after college and he hasn't gotten a job in 6 months. I don't charge him anything and buy all his food. He wants to start a business one day and make lots of money but he's just spending all his time in his underwear playing video games. Should I keep ""helping"" him so he has a better foundation to learn about building a business?   You're not helping your brother is my point. I have brothers so I get the desire to help and the frustration when they keep going down the wrong path. Your brother has to chose his own path, he needs to come to terms with where he's at as a professional, and has to decide what's he's passionate about working on. You artificially keeping him as a professional afloat by masking his efforts with yours confuses his understanding of his market value and makes improving his situation less urgent.  Your job as his brother is to emotionally support him unconditionally while he chooses his other path in life. You should only help him professionally through advise when he solicits it and you should cut out the free labor until he's mature enough to offer to pay you for your time."

Even if he is charging low prices, his work should still meet modern standards.   I know it's hard, but you should let him walk on his own two feet for awhile. Perhaps provide him some tools for success (books, tutorials, etc...), but then leave him to fend for himself. He'll soon realize what he knows and does not know. If he truly wants to continue in this line of work he'll learn. Plus, I think you'd be more inclined to help him if you thought he was helping himself."

When I started out I was editing whatever I could find on Craigslist for a few hundred dollars here and there.  Then I moved to Chicago and got a job at a big post-production company and saw a VASTLY different game being played. I was essentially doing the same thing, but instead of editing two hour weddings for $300 I was editing 30-60 second national broadcast spots for $100,000 dollars a pop. Same work, different market.

Furthermore, their entire market is a tiny fraction the global demand for freelancers. To me, the whole, ""I bid on odesk and am all out of ideas"" screams of laziness. You really expect (good) business to just present itself to you? If you choose to be a freelancer, that means you're your own sales department. Could you imagine if your salesperson said, ""look, I spent a few hours bidding on projects, but couldn't compete on low prices?"" You'd probably fire them.

No payments up front? No pictures and extra information about additional freelancers? Can't see other quotes? Can't know more about the client? What the hell! They combined two decent sites (elance, odesk) into one client oriented site because the oligarchy controlling it is trying to stronghold every freelancer out there. Clients have the power.

freelance,35q6qx,mason07,13,Wed May 13 13:59:47 2015 UTC,"Well without knowing where you are in the world it's hard to give you a fair assessment as to what constitutes industry average in your neck of the woods, but as far as web design goes $15/hr is bottom barrel prices; so $8-9/hr is near robbery. You're offering a specialized service that takes years to get right. If they're paying $9 hr they should expect to get $9hr quality, which means a designer that may take longer or may not be as proficient in design. Additionally web design and graphic design are not synonymous positions, though we may treat them as such this is not the case and even more credence to being undervalued.   Furthermore you should never work for free, even when doing revisions. Your time is valuable, (or at least that's my opinion as a freelancer) and if they're asking you to do anything they should fully know that's going to cost them. If YOU decide not to charge them because you're a nice person, then great, but your client should never expect to get services for free. They don't sound ideal, and sound more sub-par at best. If his brother feels like he could do the same job in less than 12 hours then he could probably make the revisions too. A 12 hour site by any standard is a site created by a professional, if you expect professional quality, expect to pay professional rates ($400-700 per day). If you pay unprofessional rates, you can't expect professional timeline, or quality, let alone both; this is what they're doing to you.   It's in these situations when I want to cut my client but still be a professional I say, ""well ""client"" I understand your frustrations, and I appreciate your input. Unfortunately I have to respectfully disagree about the time and effort you believe goes into projects like this; for me to finish this part of the project it's going to to take ""x"" dollars and ""y"" hours. Unfortunately that's the best I can currently offer as I have additional projects and clients to satisfy, if you need it done quicker I may be able to accommodate with an additional fee, otherwise I would encourage you to tap in to some of your other resources, because ultimately I'm here to help you achieve the best results!""

Your use of a framework and a starter template was a good use of your client's money (and your time).   I'm assuming that the website is already live and you're left holding the bag waiting for payment. If not, kudos, don't deploy until he pays. Otherwise ask him to have his brother do it.

Continuing to engage with this guy is only going to waste more of your time. There's no upside here. Walk away.    now he wants me to do more to the website without being charged.   Never work for free. Politely tell him to fuck off. If he isn't paying you he isn't really a customer, is he? Are you running business or a charity? This guy is obviously exploiting you. Earning his goodwill isn't going to advance your business.     Since I needed the money I kept the job. I am now making 9 an hour..    I can't speak to your personal situation, but, barring all else, never do this. Borrow money first. Put your expenses on credit cards. Get a loan with a horrible interest rate. But never sell yourself short.  You've now spent 50 hours on sub-par work. $9/hr is beyond reasonable - you're essentially giving your time away. You're better off going into debt than wasting your time like this.  Consider if you were to triple your rate, rounding up to a still extremely reasonable $30/hr. You've currently ""earned"" $450 (50 hours @ $9/hr). At the better rate you would have earned $450 in 15 hours. And, instead of having wasted 50 hours on a job that probably won't pay out, you would have had an additional 35 hours to find and line up the $30/hr work in the first place.   The opportunity costs that come with such a low rate are enormous. And if you're starting out freelancing you should expect to spend most of your time on non-billable hours, like developing leads and finding jobs. Which is why you need to charge a reasonable rate from the start, to ensure that the billable hours can pay for non-billable ones."

It took me a while to have the courage to raise my rates, but I can honestly say that raising rates has been directly proportional to the quality of clients I have. Nobody wins with $9/hr websites.  Stand your ground on this and don't do a thing to the site until you have this worked out to your satisfaction. If getting your full invoice is enough to make you walk away comfortably, fight for it and make him pay. If he won't agree to your terms, walk away. If you have a contract, stick to it. If you don't, at the very least create one for the remainder of the work including any outstanding balances, what more you will do and what he will pay for it. Don't turn your monitor or touch your mouse until it is agreed to and signed. Someone this stingy about money certainly does not want to start over with someone new and pay more.  Lastly, do not give him anything that resembles the final keys until you have your payment in hand. If you give him the final code or do more work from here on out, I can almost guarantee he will not be willing to pay. If you have been developing on his live domain, there isn't much you can do to stop him from keeping your work. In the future, you will want to develop locally until approval and a payment milestone or at least on your own development server. When you have payment and design/development approval, then you push things to his live site. Just future FYI.  Bottom line: Fight for your money as you run like hell. In the long run, your time will be better spent looking for new clients and continuing to learn new skills than it will be chasing money from this guy. Bad clients don't magically become good ones. Get away as soon as you can.  I'm not a lawyer or anything more than another freelancer/small business. Be willing to eat your losses on this to fight for what is right.

That being said I have phased out doing SEO, but I made it clear with them that I would do nothing more than an onsite audit for their SEO and only provide onsite recommendations. If any of my clients questioned that (like one client thinking I gave another client some advantage) I would be quick to send them the audit I did for the other site. I made it a point to not be linked to their GWT or Analytics accounts for that reason. I didn't want to have any more information than I could glean by using Moz, Raven tools, or Ahrefs. SO it is a sticky area, I would personally try to stay away from if possible. Like I mentioned before, I have virtually phased doing SEO out so it is becoming less of an issue.

Especially if company #2 asked you based mostly on the fact that you're SEOing company #1.  I'd suggest finding an SEO company to recommend them to who will pay you for the lead (might not be a ton, but better than 0, PLUS you avoid any unpleasantness).  :)"

When you build a relationship with a client remember that that is how they will perceive you going forward, and how that version of word of mouth will spread.   I have a client from 2 years ago I pandered to because it was a large job during a drought, but now whenever they call and I can't drop what I'm doing and offer same day turn around they get upset - and then gripe about me to other mutual clients I have that we both know.   I have a different client from last year who I took extra good care of and no matter what happens, even if I drop the ball (and I have a couple times) he always remembers and recommends me as a top performer.

This might piss off a few people, but you've already done that by speaking the truth, so whatever:  NO one cares about what you do and what you make. What clients care about (and pay for) are what those things can do for them.  This means no one cares about how awesome you are at what you do, how much experience you have, how ""right"" your websites are, or whatever. If they're going to part with their money, they generally want a ROI. And /u/ironicart is selling them an ROI and not ""a Wordpress website"", which is why he can charge $30k-60k for a combination of code, design, and copy that boggles the minds of many here. I get similar pushback when I sell $20k+/week engagements to clients — but the pushback is from peers (""who would pay THAT?!"") and NOT from actual clients :-)"
freelance,35lpsc,brennandunn,7,Wed May 13 11:50:24 2015 UTC,"Great post! I've been doing value over deliverables as well. You picked a good example saying even though you deliver a website, what the client is really getting is an online marketing strategy.  One question I have though—how do you come up with a % of increased business performance to tell the client when you're selling results? Like you mentioned, ""Here's where you could increase sales 20%, by just having a landing page where you capture leads!"" How do you come up with that 20%? I'm sure a lot of it is previous experience, but I'm wondering if there's also somewhere that has all of these statistics of common website improvements and their results.  Thanks again!"
freelance,35lpsc,VitaliyG,1 point,Mon May 11 18:45:02 2015 UTC,"It's really important that you don't exaggerate results. You'll find that clear expectations lead to happier long term relationships with clients (just like dating i suppose haha)...  I track my other clients with google analtyics and tools like infusionsoft (or improvly) i usually have a really good gut when it comes to what a new lead can expect, but I generally will just show them what I did for another client and the results they experienced.  I make a proposal usually that breaks down what CAN work and what might not work in their specific business. I'm not terribly vague, but you can't say YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE 50K IN THE NEXT 6 WEEKS! You have to express that - if you see similar results to my past clients, implementing these systems you could see growth of XX sales over the next six months if we hit these key metrics... Saying basically the same thing without getting non FTC compliant (with income claims).  Bottom line - show case studies of past clients, compare to what your new lead could do   Edit: VERY IMPORTANT - do your best to get as much data about your lead as possible, current sales - project sales, how many leads it takes to get a sale on avg, how much a lead is worth - stuff like that... IF YOU DON'T THINK YOU CAN GROW THEIR BUSINESS DONT WORK WITH THEM - that was a huge lesson i learned early on"

If I find a company that I think qualifies I don't always jump right in and send that info, usually I'll add the owner on Facebook - 9/10 I'll get added, I use my Facebook almost entirely for business.  I like to post content that helps business owners grow their business online, lots of times the owners of these businesses (potential clients) will interact with that content... and here's where magic can happen  1 - i'll message them and let them know I added them because I too am a local business owner and always love to connect with people locally who are doing awesome in business  2 - i always talk about their business in that convo, i might mention mine, but I don't play the ""i ask you something so i can talk for an hour about my business' card, I just keep asking questions about them  3- if you message people on FB, Facebook priorities you in THEIR newsfeed, so they will see MORE of your posts.  4- if it's someone i REALLY want as a client i'll set them as a 'close friend' so i can get notifications when they post, and when its appropriate (i.e. not like super personal) I'll leave a chill comment or just drop a like  people associate Facebook with friends, if you become their friend they're going to be wiling to have a business conversation with you.

freelance,35lpsc,sn76477,6,Tue May 12 18:14:37 2015 UTC,"Really great writeup in OP as well as comments!   Do you sell yourself as a marketing agency? I guess one of your points is that you aren't selling tech, you're selling results. To clarify: When you first got started, you had no results to sell - so you partnered with an SEO/PPC company and basically sold theirs? What kind of tools do you like to use for tracking conversions, split testing, etc? Have you rolled your own WP plugins for this kind of thing?   This really struck a chord with me, I'm the same age you were when you started this business, currently freelancing - mostly WP work. I've been working with a marketing agency and I feel like I need to be chasing some bigger fish.  edit: additional questions:   You mentioned you do a lot of business on Facebook. Do you use a separate business account that you regularly update with internet marketing bits and pieces for credibility, or do you just use yourself as a point of contact?"
freelance,35lpsc,Combatcoda,5,Wed May 13 12:59:32 2015 UTC,"great questions!  I don't particularly label myself as an agency, or anything really - i USUALLY end up on a first name basis before I even start selling (through the Facebook technique i mentioned).. If they don't ask I don't tell them, it's funny how few questions people have when you just talk results... If someone asks what I do I say ""i guess you could call me a digital marketing consulting, but basically I just work with business to grow leads and sales online"" get's the benefit of what I do across.  When I first got started I actually did a TON of free work, which I don't regret, BUT if I were to do it again, I would totally partner with SEO/PPC because they measure their results extremely well - I would negotiate with them that I would sell their service along with mine if I could use their results as the foundation for my sales pitch. Doubt a company is going to say no to free sales.  I use visual website optimizer for testing, mainly I just test headlines (and i track bounce rates and conversions sales/leads - goal is always to increase time on page... the longer someone digests your content the more likely they are to become a lead/sales.) I also use google analytics (goals) a lot, they're easy to set up and i can set it up to send clients automated reports which is nice  For my B2B clients I use my personal Facebook - I have close to 4k friends (about 1500 friend requests) so theres a lot of social proof, i post a lot of fun random crap along with business stuff, but I keep it business casual (not posting drunk pictures and stuff, instagram for that hah)..

I expect the same professional courtesy from my clients, and not one has been pissed off or mad at me because I told them I respect their idea but ""here's why they're wrong in my experience"". I usually end that kind of conversation with 'we can try it, but I'm going to test it because I'm invested in you seeing results from this site', clients love it when you test their ideas...  It actually pisses me off when I read 'clientsfromhell.net' because yes - clients can be stupid - but we let them be stupid, there IS a fine line between confident and cocky, but you're doing a disservice to a client if you don't do what you know is right. It's also why I charge up front - I don't feel like I HAVE to bend to their will to get paid, my incentive is to get an amazing case study of a site that rocks and a client that is super profitable so that I can share it with my next lead.  edit: specific example - a client wanted to change a headline on their site (one that I knew generated leads at around 45%)... they basically demanded i change it to include that 'they had been in business for 25 years' (which i had further down the page) sounds like a good thing to add, but it cut conversions by 20% - because yes, its important information, basically a trust element, BUT it was about the business not about the benefit to the customers... and customers only care about themselves (marketing 101)  i shared the stats with him, he laughed and said ""I guess i should have trusted you!"" and he never quested my judgement again.  how do i know what works?

freelance,35lpsc,toto88x,11,Mon May 11 16:26:41 2015 UTC,That's the best advice I've seen. Stop being a designer at the table.
freelance,35lpsc,charleswinin,6,Mon May 11 16:30:47 2015 UTC,"I think your entire process is great.  Unlike other web developers, you've done what every entrepreneur should do (this could go in /r/entrepreneur just as well) and found a profitable niche.  You are not deferring judgement to the client like many of us web developers do, because your niche is in something they don't know much about.  You aren't doing business process automation necessarily, in which case the client would have the most knowledge.  You are doing SEO and marketing.  It just happens to be on a web platform.  That is very profitable and can turn a small to medium-sized business into a household name, at least within a specific industry.  I think that's excellent.  Exactly the type of thing people should be doing.  Don't focus on the tech.  Focus on the economics of it all.  Tech is a means to an end, that's all.  One thing I would say is there are definitely cases where I would consider charging a referral fee for a smaller business that wasn't ready to pay that much upfront.  Find just the right business that has the potential to utilize web marketing, and lots of potential for growth, and just the right size to be willing to cough up referral fees.  I wouldn't do it for every client, and for the clients I did it for, it would be considered an investment due to the inherent risk of not getting paid.  However, there are some this just might work for."

freelance,35lpsc,dirtymonkey,3,Mon May 11 18:14:57 2015 UTC,"No its a small 3 3/4 inch metal trash can. The point is that people will throw away mail. But open a package, and they won't like seeing their money thrown in the trash."
freelance,35lpsc,dirtymonkey,2,Tue May 12 10:44:19 2015 UTC,It's a common strategy often referred to as 'lumpy mail' it works not because of the letter content or novelty but because unusual shaped mail gets put on the top of the pile & opened first. You could send the same letter without the toy trashcan and it would lower conversions.

BUT the clients were ALL demanding, because they were afraid -- and they were afraid because I didn't explain the benefits of my services, I assumed they knew.  That's why ANY client might be a jerk or mean or seem stupid, its because they're afraid... pretty basic human reaction to uncertainty. The more certain I can make my client the happier we both are.  What if I don't deliver on my promise? Well - I'll be honest I've fully refunded 2 projects, that hurt - BUT we both walked away with a hand shake and still remain in contact.  They didn't work because I didn't understand their business well enough and assumed my marketing strategies would work, and they just didn't.

freelance,35lpsc,jwcobb13,2,Wed May 13 14:38:41 2015 UTC,"Awesome post, thanks a lot! As someone who is considering becoming freelance/consultant right now, this is really inspiring!  Just 3 questions if you don't mind:   Do you just build the websites and walk away? Or do you do customer acquisition to generate leads for the company? Because having a great landing page without traffic won't generate any sales for the companies you work for. The websites you showed are basically sales page with a big ""BUY NOW"" call to action. Yet in your comments here you talk a lot about collecting leads. What are the ""leads"" you are talking about? Just visitors, or maybe email addresses? You mentioned making $500k in 3 years. So that's about 15 websites at $30k. Why making only 15 websites in 3 years? What's the limiting factor: time to find clients, time to build the website, or something else? It seems to me you could be making a lot more money.   Thanks! :-)"

freelance,35lpsc,farfaraway,21,Wed May 13 22:26:31 2015 UTC,"edit - heck even gonna upvote you myself - these are constructive criticisms and I hope my response does a decent job explaining my perspective - main point i'd want to get across is that you can use these elements ethically with your clients, and your clients customers to get great results. Just never cut corners on customer support, and just don't work with clients you don't trust. (i don't work in the biz op, mlm, healthcare, personal development, or dating niches for this reason.. I honestly can say most of them do have questionable practices. I'm happy to say ALL of my products and my clients products are all business tools and training, and I prefer those - because people can either choose to use them to grow their business or not, it's not as much an 'emotional manipulation' sale as it is a ""can this help me grown my business"" sale... and I believe in my clients products)  replying to a few of your comments below and kroboz -    I'm a full-stack web developer that actually helps my clients build a legitimate online presence and charges them a reasonable rate for it. These funnel websites are great for things like short-term discounts, but they are awful for long-term brand building.   Yea - I don't claim to be a web developer, go do your thing man, I don't hate on anyone else business model. Yes most of my clients are in the marketing space, yes most of my sites are not beautiful, yes most of them are direct marketing copy... but you know what? I'm tired of people complaining about marketing..  I tell someone the benefit of using my software, my course, or my plugin - they buy my product. They use my or my clients product, they either a) find it useful and implement it into their business or b) are not satisfied and hit the refund button in the customer support area.  The old days of wild west 'direct marketing' - suck the money and run - does not hold up.  A bit on the nose? Sure - less artistic than your sites? Sure. Would I put my earnings per visitor up against anyone in r/freelance? Absolutely.  It's pretty cut and dry, and I'm not apologetic for the results  Example 1 - converts ate 83% lead capture rate to ad traffic, the funnel converts at 13%.. customer support is the number one priority after the purchase and none of the products in the funnel are get rich quick or MLM level content, their tools and training on how to implement retargeting in any business.  Example 2 - 4.5 million per year brand with 20k+ customers, sure it's not as beautiful or corporate as GoToWebinar - but they have a staff of 4 and customers who love the product.  If you hate short term discounts stay out of malls, - funny thing is I did build all of these in a week or less... But the funnel is where the sales happen, and I bet I could double the sales on any of the websites you produced. I literally could go to any of your clients (who you probably bitch and moan about) and go in and - not exaggerating - double their sales.  Should customers are about brand? Yes. But should they care about it more than sales? 80% of businesses fail in the first year, and I'm guessing a big part of it is paying someone $50 an hour to make a 10 page website that generates a net zero result for their business -- it's just 'artistic' as you say.  you know what's really funny I just realized? Everyone who I've made a website for in the last 3 years is a millionaire and loves what they do, they love their business - and believe it or not, they all care about their customers. I actually do take pride in my 'ugly sites', though I wouldn't really call most of them ugly  http://fbinfluence.com - http://linkedinfluence.com - http://increase.academy - http://sean.co - http://webinarja.com (http://ww2.webinarjam.com/live/ was a special promo) - http://retargetmasterclass.com/question ) - http://videotrafficacademy.com - http://marketinggenesis.com  yup - all simple sites... simple works, and most people try to complicate it so they can show off their pretty websites with no results to back it up"
freelance,35lpsc,douglife,13,Wed May 13 22:31:52 2015 UTC,"None of those websites meet the requirements I set other than arguably http://sean.co/ which I'm guessing is your personal blog, so I stand by what I said.   I bet I could double the sales on any of the websites you produced. I literally could go to any of your clients (who you probably bitch and moan about) and go in and - not exaggerating - double their sales.   I'm glad you're confident. The truth is, I use funnels for short-term marketing too. That's what they are good for. But I do it for a reasonable hourly rate that goes along with the normal services I provide. We call them ""mini-sites"". So no, your whole ""double their sales"" thing might work for some companies, but not for mine.  I don't bitch or moan about clients any more than any other business owner. For the most part, I love my clients and they love me, but I'm a professional. So even if I thought they were the dirtiest low-down scoundrel this side of Dodge they'd still get my best.  Regardless, thanks for posting some more sites.

freelance,35lpsc,TheAdventMaster,7,Mon May 11 23:59:04 2015 UTC,"there's quite a few tiers of ""online marketing"" - which in my opinion is possibly the dumbest niche in the world... desperate people buying desperate tools with gimmicky results.  HOWEVER - the principles they use to sell, which they just borrow from Lexis commercials and Macy Saturday sales, work.  I dive into my thoughts on this on another comment in here, I totally agree the design elements aren't 10/10 artistic.. and I am actually working on upping the quality of the design without sacrificing the conversions.  But i hate to admit it - ugly converts, gets leads and sales, for my customers. You can have a 'brand' website with pretty logos and images, which I still build out for credibility, but if you want results sometimes you have to give people what they want then hopefully deliver what they need.  Biz Opp / MLM is nasty, but they are good at explaining the benefits of their systems. Small business can do the same, but deliver a SOLID product instead of a crappy pyramid scheme. Thats where ethics come in, I've turned down a lot of what I would consider crappy product customers (I actually had Empower Network come to me to build out their system, yes I have proof of that - and I turned them down, even though they've done something north of 40 million in sales)  so just to summarize, I can't argue with the 'cheesy' part... but put your mind in your customer's customer and you'll find most of them need assurances before they purchase - and for the love of god just be 100% transparent on the refund / cancelation policy (required). DONT hold peoples money who purchased based on emotion and regret it later  edit: I don't work in health or fitness or dating or personal development - I want to sell (and help my clients sell) products that help businesses grow."

Also as far as constructive criticism I don't know that I need to or really want to provide any.   I've worked in digital since the very early 2000s.   Some of this stuff you just have to see for yourself.   I'm not even saying you can't make money from it, but your very old squeeze page strategy isn't going to work for a lot of the clients freelance webdesigner and marketers are going for.  Your long squeeze page isn't going to work any better for a lawyer.   If I have an ecommerce site with 10,000 products your page with everything on it isn't going to work.  And again where do you find the webinarjam's and the linkedinfluence / fbinfluence's in the yellowpages?     And I honestly don't care if you come off as harsh to me.   You had a few pieces of interesting information in your original post, but the your work isn't really reflective of the type of client your prospecting method seems to reflect.    I don't doubt that there is money to be made either.   I spent two years working for a company specifically running their affiliate offers, building websites and buying media.   Hell, I could have probably gotten you a full time job making these crummy sites.

That's why I'd overcharge, so that I could put 10% (or maybe more, if I wasn't greedy) of the charge into buying stuff through the page to push up my numbers.  what does that even mean?  (replied to your other concerns above)"
freelance,35lpsc,kro4k,1 point,Tue May 12 02:13:48 2015 UTC,"Well first off, I'm not calling you a scammer, per se. I'm just agree with the previous poster that scammers love sites with this particular design scheme.  For statistics purposes, you can funnel in bot-driven traffic from all over to show lots of impressions. You can rent out hours on a botnet. There are lots of white-hat things you can do to drive traffic to, don't get me wrong, it's just that if you want to do black-hat things, one-page websites are ideal.  It's also ideal for showing sales increases.  Let's say that you are a scammer (and again, I'm not saying you are). You spend $2,000 in fees to subcontractors to actually build the site and that you need $3,000 for your time on the site overseeing their work. Then you spend $5,000 on white-hat marketing. And finally, let's say you want another $5,000 in spending money just for kicks. That's $15,000. You could then use the other 50% ($15,000) of your fee of 30k to increase sales temporarily for the client.  If you think your client is savvy enough or they are doing their own tracking, you'd need to spread out the traffic to different areas by ghosting IP addresses and you'd need a way to hide that all the money is coming from one place, but that's all relatively child's play at this point with prepaid debit cards and the systems available to people in the know.  If you, are on the other hand, controlling not only how the site is built but also how the traffic statistics are viewed, then you don't have to work as hard."

Yes - all of that is like salt on a steak, you can add too much. Better to keep the convo focused on their business, sprinkle in how you helped another client accomplish part of the goal you're discussing with the lead. ""ah I hear ya, getting more leads in that demographic can be tough - I actually worked with a client once and did XYZ strategy and it helped a lot!"" kind of stuff  [[ if you want to focus on coding and design, hire a sales person and have them use these sales techniques - that can be very effective, however I tend to find sales people will sell anything to anyone, I want to sell to qualified leads - makes the project much more enjoyable and profitable ]]  hope that helps!"

If you can go land tons of work then it's my opinion, at least in the software world, that you should hire a few people fulltime to fulfill the work. Or generate leads and sell them to any bidder (nobody has exclusive rights to them) but I'm not sure what those leads would look like.  I was offering 50% of any amount over my standard rate of $120/hr. So If he brought me work at $150/hr he'd get $15/hr so to speak.

Which is fine, but then you have two options:  Just embrace the fact that you don't know what you're doing. Stop trying to make it seem like you're some huge business with important contracts. Just send them an e-mail with your terms, or use one of the simple contract templates out there.  OR  Go get a lawyer and have him write a real contract.  This is laughable. As in, if I saw this, I would send it to my friends so we could laugh at it. I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be a dick, but you're just reaching way beyond your grasp here and it's obvious you're trying to appear more than you are. Almost all of this is either unnecessary, irrelevant, doesn't make sense or wouldn't hold up under actual legal scrutiny anyway.  It really sounds like all you need is an e-mail saying ""Hey, excited about the project, here's some guidelines if we decide to move forward:  Blah blah payment due after whenever, I'm going to need 50% up front, blah blah, I'll do X revisions whatever whatever whatever cool, sound good?""  Then they say yeah and you have a contract. Don't do this ""Client retains the right to refuse future services in form of a blacklist."" No shit you're allowed to refuse future services. But do you really need to point out to clients that you might blacklist them? Do you think clients like seeing that?   ""$100 rush fee may be applied but quality is not guaranteed."" Are they asking you to rush it? No? Then why would this even be relevant? And why are you telling clients who have nothing to do with rush jobs that sometimes you're okay with giving low quality work to clients? If they are asking you to rush it, then you've already told them there's a $100 fee.  I strongly suggest you scrap this entire thing and either tone it waaaayyy down or you hire a lawyer.  Hope I don't sound too harsh.  Best of luck."

freelance,35mm9j,sonofaresiii,4,Mon May 11 19:51:50 2015 UTC,"I totally understand that, and I hope you take this as advice and not me being a jerk, but you're not qualified to write a contract like this. If you want a boilerplate contract that covers everyone in every situation, including malicious clients, you need to pay a professional to write it. Half of this stuff wouldn't even hold up if someone challenged, it honestly. For instance, you can't keep someone's deposit for services not rendered. So everytime you use the word ""deposit,"" that section is completely meaningless. It also shows clients you don't know what you're doing. To keep someone's money, you have to render services, which means you need specific language to indicate any money kept is due to some action you took, usually noted as a scheduling fee. Scheduling the time to work on someone's project is a specific action, so you can keep money for that.  But what sounds like the better option is to just lay out some terms on a case-by-case basis for each client. That would be my recommendation."

Do you have other articles or is this one long article?  You don't want to be standing in front of a judge trying to explain the legal structure of a ""contract"" you wrote despite not knowing how to.  Get an actual, very simple legal contract that outlines the basics of copyright, etc., and then have an addendum that is a statement of work where you write out what you'll be doing for what price.

Nor would I ever pay (or expect my clients to pay) 50% upfront. Even building contractors would only charge 1/3 up front and that is usually to buy the physical materials to do your project to save them from being on the hook for it. You're dealing in digital bits that aren't tangible. Charging 50% upfront makes me think you're going to take the money and I won't ever hear from you again.  Charging additional fees for fast work, but not guaranteeing the quality?  Cancellation fee of 100%? Revision fees?  Copyright ownership is off base as it's work for hire.

After hearing what he wanted and how he imagined it to be (he's not a tech), it was looking to be a huge project spanning a few months with financial transactions, connecting to health fund APIs, processing CC payments, etc.  I'll be honest, this is the type of job that closes off the rest of the year for me by working a few months.  Once he told me his end result though, I found an easier, cheaper and quick to market alternative that we can do in 2 weeks.  He gets charged my hourly rate for the meeting so he spent a few hundred dollars to save $x0,000s.  Sure it means I don't get a few months of work today, but he'll keep coming back in the future.

freelance,35ib8s,ironicart,3,Mon May 11 14:54:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not /u/ironicart, but let me go at this.  I'm currently the lead and generally only developer for an intranet ""website"" contracted to us by a single department within a Fortune 500 company.  I have been full-time on the project for 2 1/2 years at $65 - $85 / hr.  At the bare minimum they pay us $130k / yr.  Our company has maybe 10 developers total, if that.  It is not a very large site, but it tracks metrics and other important internal information via a secure web portal.  This is business process automation and is very valuable to them.  The ROI of our products has been in the millions of dollars worth of engineers' time, and the additional analysis we are able to automate for them brings them up to a modern pace.  So we are effectively making them more money than they pay us.  Eliminating work with us would not be a cost-saving measure, for example, as IT departments are sometimes seen.  Personally, I think we're worth even more than that, because by saving engineers time, they are able to focus on other things and that assists with them maintaining a competitive status quo.  We don't have access to higher up executives, though, so I'm not sure we could ever sell our value any further...  Thankfully, our clients love us and are doing their best to do that for us :)  Hoping to get a million dollar contract from them.  Maybe one day.    Let me go further and say I don't think we accept projects worth less than $24k to the client.  Understand this isn't necessarily a price point we set.  It's what the client thinks their project is worth.  Let me also say that we are constantly growing.  Two years ago, my boss was a contractor and I (unauthorized) did sub-contracted work for him on another project.  This is incredibly common and since we're paid so well, it's a fairly easy thing to do once you've established yourself with a client.  And let me say finally our client absolutely does not care what technology we use.  But you will have to prove the benefit to them at times.  We have gotten projects because the client initially coded it in VB.NET or something because that's what they could self-teach, but beyond that, they don't actually care."

freelance,35ib8s,ironicart,4,Mon May 11 14:51:33 2015 UTC,"Here's what a lot of freelancers do:   Figure out what your worth per hour, figure out how many hours the project will take you, multiply, present quote. This way, if you structure your contract properly, you will have a rate established, and if the client asks for extraneous features that weren't in their original proposal, you can continue to work on the project without having to renegotiate.  Wordpress sites have a huge cost range. What country/region are you from? Do they have a web industry?"
freelance,35ib8s,blkbeard,2,Sun May 10 17:46:40 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize this was the standard way of doing it, but I've been using it, and it works like a charm.  I have an established rate for most services now and can label them and present them to a client with individual prices, and total cost for the project.  It has also helped me believe in myself and my prices a bit more, and I deliver the quote with conviction, which really helps when trying to close a deal."
freelance,35ib8s,daanishh,3,Sun May 10 23:08:58 2015 UTC,"OP - you dont give much info about your experience or location and both affect your rates you charge to customers.  If you have 5+ years of experience and work in SF or LA, you probably will charge more per hour than someone with a year of experience or fresh out of school living in Arkansas.   Re the other answers, they are correct. You want to break the project down into steps or tasks, estimate how long each task will take, add time for testing, documentation, training, installing and some slack. This will give you a total number of hours you will charge times your hourly rate.    As for how much a website costs (and based on my 20+ years of programming experience and 13 years of running my own software business), here are some answers:   a top notch agency will charge a medium size firm (say approx 100 employees) anywhere from $15 to $50k for a site.    a smaller firm using an agency may pay anywhere from $5000 to $15000 for a site.    a US based consultant from Craigslist will often charge in the range of $100 per hour for a site with sites costing anywhere from $3000 to $10000 depending on complexity    a student on Craigslist will probably charge anywhere from $300 to $2000 for a site    your nephew/family member whos good with computers will build you a site for a few hundred dollars    on odesk or elance (now called upwork.com) a foreign worker will charge anywhere from $5 to $15 per hour to build you a site      So the pricing range is hge and so is the quality of what you get. Very often a person who opts for the cheapest options will end up re-doing their site using a more expensive option very soon after as they did not get what they wanted and a high quality of work the first time.    Effectively companies get what they pay for. You have to decide where you are on the chart and what a fair hourly rate is for your skills, then create estimates based on that. I previously posted a suggestion re your hourly rate based on your experience. If you are a newbie you will be cheap, if you have lots of experience you will be more expensive but the quality of your work will be better and you will take less time."

All you have to do is market yourself as a web developer, rather than a web designer, and make sure your server-side / integrations skills are up there.  I'm not saying it's easy as 1-2-3, but the money's there.  If you're in web design, it's there also, but the projects themselves will likely be shorter and you'll be charging more for maintenance.

If you're changing to being a self employed contractor, then you're taking more risk (you don't usually get employee perks, paid holiday, and little / no notice period) so are justified in charging more, but if you're still an employee doing the same work from a different location I see no reason why you should be paid any differently."

freelance,35iixi,BlueVerse,1 point,Mon May 11 12:08:57 2015 UTC,"You should ask for more as now you have to pay for your own benefits. They may counter that you will able to work from home and save commuting money and live in a lower cost of living area and blah blah blah. Or they may see its a reasonable request.    Now how much to ask for.  Probably $40 or $45 per hour is reasonable to ask for (and possible to achieve), but they will probably negotiate you down to $35. Just get as high as you can to start with - you can renegotiate 6 months or 12 months down the road once they have confidence in you as a remote worker.   In an ideal world you would get closer to double (so $45 to $54 per hour) but its unlikely they will go for that. The reason is as a contractor your are taking on various risks (no job security) and may have to pay for certain costs (your own equipment, your office, maybe some staff). Also you may not work for all 12 months of the year (benched between contracts) so need a higher hourly to reflect all these risks and costs."

It almost feels like they're business-level negging you.   Furthermore, I just don't think that a freelancer should be tolerating so much unpaid work. If you were making up the difference some other way/on some different pricing plan, that'd be one thing. But kinda the whole point of freelancing is escaping the employee umbrella, right?

They probably don't care about your skill level either. The parents of the students want to make sure you're a good teacher and a good fit for their child.   I teach lessons in my students homes. I charge $75 for an hour lesson. $50 for 30 minutes. Most of what I teach is basic chords and tablature (rarely actual notation).... Because that's what my students want to learn.  A lot of Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran.   I also use AdWords to drive traffic to my website. No luck with flyers for me."

I think there is a demand for classical guitar lessons in my area. Especially with younger students. I mean I can teach tabs but that would get old really really fast for me. I guess if the money's that good though I could make a good bit with not too much effort.  So if education and skill doesn't count for much what can I do to convince people I'm a good teacher?
freelance,35gufb,jakischmias,2,Thu May 14 01:55:54 2015 UTC,"A few things:   If your goal is to make a little side money over the summer... It doesn't matter if tabs are going to be boring for you.... it's about keeping your client/student engaged.  If they get bored of YOU or your material, they will quit.  I market myself as a teacher who focuses on student-centric objectives/goals.  If they want to learn Taylor Swift... cool.  If they want to learn classical style/technique.... also cool.   I also position myself as making sure we have FUN in our lessons.  I don't publish my prices (usually).  I prefer to have students/parents contact me first to actually start the discussion and develop initial rapport (even if just through e-mail).  Any marketing (flyers, craigslist, etc) needs to be about the client/student/customer... and the benefit you can provide to THEM... for example:  I do lessons in their home (so I make sure my marketing materials talk about saving them time, headaches from traffic, providing a safe/comfortable teaching/learning environment).  Since I charge a higher rate, I generally get more committed students.   In-home lessons can fetch a higher rate simply due to the convenience factor... I'm definitely the most expensive teacher in my area... but my target audience can afford to pay a premium price for this type of service.  If they want cheaper lessons, that's cool, but they'll have to travel for them.  A lot of my students started at music stores, but didn't like the teachers/teaching philosophy so they switched to me/my teachers.  Marketing is trial and error.  If you're just doing this for a few months, I wouldn't bother making a website for yourself.  I'd suggest Craigslist ads, flyers (EVERYWHER), maybe those little signs you post in the ground at intersections, and using a service like thumbtack.com.  Also, reach out to EVERYONE you know and tell them that you're teaching and ask them if they know anybody who wants lessons.    TL;DR: Go get Rob Hampton's awesome book about teaching guitar. Just google: ""heartwood guitar teaching handbook"".  Buy it (it's like $30).  It's what got me started (FYI - he charges $100 for lessons AT HIS OWN STUDIO... love it!).   There's some great Linkdin guitar teacher groups as well."

Low rates, clients who don't pay etc. If you're in a a city with a decent tech employment scene (or are willing to move to one), go contracting. Do as many relatively short term contracts as you can (a few weeks), do great work and keep those clients happy and get a name for yourself on as many agency supplier rosters as you can as someone reliable who's reasonably priced, competent and trustworthy to work with remotely.  That's how I've built my client list and I now remote work almost all of the time on decent day rates. Sometimes I have little or no work on, sometimes I'm snowed (and share out my overflow work amongst other contractors I've met and trust), and am usually either working from home, or somewhere in Europe (recently Morocco though the Internet there is pretty bad!).

Right now 2/3 of my income is from people I found on my own and 1/3 is from elance (and a bit of guru), but when I started out it was 100% elance/guru.  clients you find on your own can usually be longer, more profitable projects. Websites are usually for people looking for small jobs done - a few hours upto a week of work. I personally prefer smaller projects. And once you get good reputation on these sites, work finds you - which is great.  tl;dr open an elance and maybe a guru account, but also look on your own.

Plus honestly, if I were still a high school student, in my field if I was getting paid by my principle I'd give them a discount simply because they're the principle. You know, it's all about the bonus points. And like everyone else has said, build your portfolio first and refine your skills.

Most of my clients are in technology and offer a trial so I get involved in the on boarding process quite often.  One thing to do would be to use data to back up your point. On my marketing reports I show how many visits turn to leads, and how many leads end up going into a trial and how many of those turn into customers. And compare it month to month and week to week. This means I can point out that I'm delivering more at the top and show where people are leaving the funnel.     In my experience, MDs and CEOs love having visibility of this, they care about how much money is being spent, and they talk in data. If you can show them that if they can fine tune their sales process, they'll get more sales without having to spend more on marketing they'll be very appreciative.   You don't even have to be explicit and say 'your sales process is shit' just show them the data and they'll pick it up for themselves.

Well you don't have a contract so neither of you agreed on anything. Does your original invoice have a payment due on it? If it does then its pretty clear that the money is owed to you by that date. Unless you are strapped for cash I would write a new invoice for all the work completed so far and give him 15 days to pay as a ""compromise"". Make sure there is a due date on the invoice and ask him for reply confirming that he has received the invoice (this is in case of legal trouble). Going forward with this individual I would write a contract stating ""payment is due upon 30 days of invoice"" as well as some kind of penalty for late payment. (make sure all invoices includes the due date and current date.)  As an aside..... So this person decides not to pay you and asks for more work and you agree? This is something you have to learn the hard way I guess. Clients will always ""forget"" to pay on time or will say something along the lines of ""just one more thing"" and then I will pay you. Here's the deal. You write contract for work (with an 20% upfront payment to show they are serious). You do work. You get paid for said work. If client does not pay then you don't work. Learn to say no. And if one more person comes to r/freelance and says ""I don't have a contract. What should I do?"" my brain will explode.

If they ask you to do additional editing, work, anything, tell them they need to pay you first (in a polite professional manner of course).  The fact that the person is waiting until the last possible moment to pay you is a bad sign.  The fact they are using 15 minutes of additional work to push having to pay you another 30 days is a very bad sign."

I mean, we know you're without a contact (and that's a minor problem), but you sent him an invoice, which assumes the completion of work.  Did you put terms on the contract (""due: 30 days"", for example)? Because your invoice to him becomes what should be actionable in terms of making payments. Your second invoice now has 30 days to pay, but the first is now overdue."

They want hard workers that are friendly and aren't morons. You need to meet people to get your foot in the door. Start with emailing. Maybe they'll respond, maybe they won't. A lot of agencies that try to be cool usually say something like ""Pop on by our offices located at 123 Main St.""  -  So do that. Just go in and introduce yourself! Bring some cookies and a resume/reel/whatever you need to demonstrate the things you do. Another way to introduce yourself to these people is to read their blog. Tons of companies have a blog on their site. Maybe it's not updated often, but that doesn't matter. Read whatever it is they wrote and email them about it. Just start a conversation.   They also hire people that know people. Referrals are the best thing ever. I edit for an advertising agency, and they were looking for a writer. I recommended a friend of mine. The owner met her at a Starbucks one night, she freelanced for a few weeks then they decided to hire her on full time. You need to network and maintain those connections."

I currently do work for 3 agencies and am looking to add a couple more to round everything out.  If it's a local agency, pop in and say hello. Some agencies around here have locked doors, so in that case either make an appointment, or find someone within the agency who has some pull and shoot them an email.  Another thing to do is network.

If you don't hear from someone after doing a job, most likely they went with a lower bidder. If you did the job as described and gave them what they want and they claim it isn't what they wanted, they lie in order to get the work for free.  I get the same stuff from eBay, sell them the item as described and they will claim it is not as described and eBay has to resolve the issue or I can refund their money, but if I refund their money I am out of money and still have to pay the eBay listing fees.   You basically want to look at their ratings before accepting work.   On eBay I am wary of new users or accounts only a few months old. They will almost always do an item not as described scam.   You have to do the same on oDesk (Upwork) be wary of new accounts and check the ratings from other freelancers before accepting the work.  When you get a bad client you are wasting your time and cheating yourself out of money."
freelance,356t6q,Ultraberg,4,Thu May 7 22:06:37 2015 UTC,"You won't make good rates if you don't own the means of competition.

freelance,356t6q,automaticyes,4,Fri May 8 10:06:05 2015 UTC,"Online freelance job markets like Elance are horrible places to be because they're hypercompetitive. For the client, it's like shooting fish in a barrel - they get a huge pool of talent competing against each other to get their money. They can choose anyone, and will favor those with a lot of experience and high reputation so getting started is a huge grind (and waste of your time).  Getting off these platforms significantly improves your chances of landing work - it'll take more time (you need to find the clients yourself) but you'll get paid a far better rate for your services.   So:   Instead of spending 5 hours working on a $20 job as the OP did, /u/Ultraberg suggests you use that time to network, cold call and get your name out to potential clients that could use your services. Show potential clients how you can deliver value to improve their business. Work your ass off and deliver well beyond their expectations. They'll spread the word about how good you are to their colleagues, friends, etc. helping you build a sustainable group of clients paying you what you're worth for your services. Go to the beach."

Talked to their technical staff - and they said they had a glitch that affected many people making their account expired and are working to fix it.  You might want to wait a bit to see it fixed if your account isn't very active, but for me I had to get it working immediately so they said I can just ""create a freelancer account"" after I login (not opening a new account, just registering the account as a freelancer again).  Meant I had to pay the $10 monthly fee again, but for me it's worth it. Their customer support (they have a chat option) is pretty good, might want to try and see what they have to say"

freelance,353o0m,Rabensky,3,Thu May 7 02:59:52 2015 UTC,"First of all - I always take out any money immediately, in case something happens to my account :)  But the most important thing to me is the ""reputation"" - as in the ratings and such. That's what gets me jobs. Opening a new account doesn't help me.  For me - and apparently a lot of other people - I was able to login, but it said my freelancer status has ""expired"" and I couldn't bid on jobs or do any of the freelancer stuff. I still had my profile and everything but clients couldn't see it.  So I registered again as a freelancer using the same account. I thought that's what you had too (as they told me it's an issue affecting a lot of people) but apparently you had some other thing :)  Good to know about the VPN though - I use VPNs a lot so I'll know to be careful."

People, don't fucking do this. Deposits are for material goods. Ensuring you pay for damage to your apartment, or replacing the keg you never returned. That kind of thing.   You can (and probably will) lose it if a client ever decides to point that out. Money never needs to be paid for services that have not yet been rendered. If you accept a deposit, and the job gets canceled, they have every right to ask for it back, regardless of what's in your contract.  What you want is a scheduling fee equal to 50% of the project (or whatever your ""deposit"" would have been). You can absolutely charge for the service of scheduling a project into your time. Even if the project is canceled, you've still rendered the service of scheduling the time and are entitled to your pay.  Also, duh, get everything in writing, but that doesn't stop a client from canceling a project. The example given in the article doesn't match the conclusions it forms."

In fact, I've tried working off the platform since the latest token changes - the sugar-coated promises didn't fit with my views on how a freelancing platform should operate (and its attitude towards the freelancers who inhabit it). There have been some improvements, but as a whole, oDesk lacks the focus and consistency it had before. For each step ahead there have been two steps back, basically aimed at the hand that feeds, a.k.a. us freelancers.  Unfortunately my local freelancing scene is horrendous and many US/UK/AU based clients tend to underestimate me just because I haven't been born on (native) English speaking soil. So I really hope this step is an advancement of sorts and will really lead to some benefits for us freelancers.  Let's see what hides behind the big talk when they roll out the site. Have to say that their logo looks pretty bad, though.

That way, you can get the ball rolling as far as an LLC/corporation, etc. If you come up with a great name later, you can always start using that as a DBA.  I did this myself—my business name (3e8) is honestly not that great, but picking something quickly allowed me to start getting everything set up, rather than stall trying to think of a name. The most important thing is to start talking to potential customers, trying to get business. They probably won't really care what your business name is."

If you answered yes, you need business insurance for your gear.

I ran a small video production company (light commercial work, and web series) for a few years.  We only ever worked for clients, and never joined a larger video production or shoot.  We just had insurance.  Insurance to cover $2-million liability (a necessary evil if you want to film on city owned property), and coverage for the gear against theft or damage.  It was less expensive than you might think.  And, we used it too... I was on a shoot, where a second camera operator dropped the camera, so it was helpful to have an insurance policy.  Film sets are crazy places, and damage happens all the time.  Get insurance.  Raise your rates if you must, but get insurance."

I don't run a video production company, I'm essentially working for a video production company. I'd be like the second camera operator who dropped the camera, except the production company wants me to have my own insurance for it.  I know it gets a little trickier because I own my gear, and your production company probably owned their gear, but this company hired me, they've stipulated I'm not allowed to use any of the work I shoot for them without directly crediting them, they've billed themselves as a video company with me just being their representative...  I think I'm gonna pass on signing the contract. I might get the insurance anyway, but it sounds like this company ought to be covering my insurance, and them not wanting to throws up a red flag.

If you are a properly licensed business, advertised as an agency, and charge agency rates - there is no reason to not act like an agency, and have other people do the work.    If you are doing business under your name, and clients are under the impression you are personally doing the work - you should be more transparent about what's going on (and start to rethink how you market yourself / what direction you're heading in.)  Selling Jr. quality work for Sr. level prices isn't exactly a great model.  If I hired someone for $100/hr because I like them and their reputation, and they hand me back code that was clearly done by a $10/hr oDesk'r, I will be absolutely ripshit.    When I was in your current situation, it took me 6+ months to find a subcontractor who could actually do what they claimed, cared about deadlines, and was reasonably available for my projects.  I burned my reputation bad because of these guys just dissappearing / quitting / blackmailing / turning in shit quality work / etc.    What works better for me, is when a client lowballs on a quote, I offer to use Jr. devs at a slightly lower rate for the easier portions of the project.  There is still a profit margin on those rates to cover any admin time I spend managing the subcontractors.  If something goes terribly wrong with a subcontractor, the clients are substantially more forgiving.   I also do the same when part of the project is outside of the scope of my skillset.  I am a developer, but a project could call for graphic designers, copywriters, data entry folk, and more.  I'm not a jack-of-all-trades, and I don't advertise myself as such.

If you bill yourself out as a freelancer (one man band), I could see there being a need to disclose that information. As far as not charging your normal rate; I don't really see how that would be a factor or consideration.  Their site is still getting done, you've got to make some money off of it, and your contractor needs to make some money off of it. I'd charge my normal rate and not worry about it.  Every business needs expansion at some point or another, in one area or another. This could be a bit dense, but I wouldn't feel obligated to tell my clients a lot of the details about how I manage my own business and workflow, unless I saw it as something they could perceive value from.  If this guy is going to be picking up some slack, it could be a point of interest to mention that it's not just you doing the work, if only to say that you're big enough / busy enough to need the help.

Or maybe include a moodboard with each sketch so they get a more complete picture, without you putting too much work into that early stage.

I would suggest either stick with Facebook for images (aim to upload 2-3 times per week, at least. You don't want to flood followers, but you don't want to look dormant), or upgrade your site with a gallery (same rules - maybe even cross-post to Facebook).  Adwords with the right keywords will get views on your site. I probably wouldn't bother with Facebook advertising (you can if you want, but keep an eye on yout ROI).  If you really want to start working the social media angle, then occasionally doing something based on current events or popular culture would probably work (I.e. ""winter is coming"" before the GoT finale, or ""Donate to Nepal"" - something relevant that has half a chance of being shared around).  Ultimately, it's up to your father as to how much he puts in.

Do you want a paid media strategy or do you want grass roots cold call / email blast type of prospecting?     So really you need to figure out who your clients are and go from there.   I'd definitely start on building out a network on Linkedin.   Find groups for the industries you are hoping to target, find which people or companies you want to target and build a strategy from there."

freelance,34rmmm,dh42com,1 point,Sun May 3 23:59:43 2015 UTC,"Damn. Thanks for the response. That's really disappointing though. The pay is already lower than I'd hoped, and with the fees from PayPal, I lost literally an hour's worth of pay in one transaction. Ugh."
freelance,34rmmm,dh42com,2,Mon May 4 00:10:24 2015 UTC,Paypal can actually lower your fee if you are taking in more than 5k every month with it. They will lower it again when you are averaging 10k a month too.
freelance,34rmmm,dh42com,1 point,Mon May 4 00:14:09 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I won't be making that much :/ the pay isn't quite what I hoped it would be.
freelance,34rmmm,dh42com,2,Mon May 4 00:32:42 2015 UTC,I hate to say it but it might end up being one of those business lesson things. You could always opt to add GBP to your paypal account currencies and then cash out with that via check and take it to your bank if the exchange rate is better. You will still lose the 2.9% transaction fee though.
freelance,34rmmm,erikwithaknotac,1 point,Mon May 4 00:34:59 2015 UTC,"Ugh. I think there's an additional fee for getting checks from PayPal, too. I also don't have a bank account around where I am right now, I moved recently and will be moving again soon, so that isn't really an option for me at this point. Damn. It definitely is a business lesson, but it's a shitty one, since I really like this job and it's supposed to be long term. This is going to end up being a huge amount of money lost over time."
freelance,34rmmm,dh42com,2,Mon May 4 00:57:45 2015 UTC,"They could mail you a check and you would not lose anything, you are basically losing because of the convenience. That is one way too look at it too. I lose a few hundred a month to them, but I like the service so it works out."

freelance,34rmmm,sprkwd,2,Tue May 5 09:35:34 2015 UTC,"The cheapest option would be Bitcoin. We've accepted them for our 2 person company. If both parties are set up, it can be practically instant and abut 2 cents a transaction. In the US, you can use a Bitpay to convert to USD and deposit it. That can take a few days.  They also have to be willing to purchase and transfer as well. Best advatages to you: low fees, no chargebacks. Biggest disadvantages: learning curve and converting to fiat."
freelance,34rmmm,springer70,2,Mon May 4 00:03:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not willing to use Bitcoin for basically a part-time job. It fluctuates too much for my comfort, and it's just much more of a hassle than I'm willing to deal with when it comes to actually turning it into usable money in my bank account. I appreciate the suggestion, though."

freelance,34s59k,raddevon,5,Mon May 4 02:27:18 2015 UTC,"TLDR: Hourly.  I'm surprised no one's answered here yet, so I'll through in my two cents.  I would try to keep things as honest as possible. Let him know you're happy to help but you haven't done this part of development enough to have built a systemized service around it. Maybe an hourly consulting rate would keep everything fair and easy. Which is pretty killer cause you're basically getting paid to sell him on your development services.  Also, this way you're not inadvertently deeming yourself an expert and raising expectations too high. There is a big difference between studying startups and actually working on the front lines while the world falls apart around you every day. If you make everything seem too easy he may end up feeling disappointed and you may lose the trust of a great client.   What's the deliverable? What's my timeline? What do I charge?   I used to stop thinking when I got to the questions. When really knowing the questions is half the battle. Have you tried answering those questions yourself? What have you come up with? You may already have the answer tucked inside that big beautiful brain of yours. Let me know where you're at so far and I'll see if I have anything valuable to add.  Anyways, free advice is worth all you paid for it so take mine with a grain of salt :)"
freelance,34s59k,honestlytrying,1 point,Mon May 4 09:15:12 2015 UTC,Billing hourly sounds like a perfect solution. Thank you for the advice!
freelance,34s59k,honestlytrying,1 point,Mon May 4 11:46:09 2015 UTC,No worries. Good luck!
freelance,34s59k,kyleslattery,1 point,Tue May 5 01:08:22 2015 UTC,"You might even consider billing daily: I've recently switched to this, and it's been great. For this type of knowledge work, where you're really spending a lot of time just thinking, rather than outright building, it's nice to be able to just block out full days to focus on the project, without having to keep an exact time log of what you worked on. At least for me, I am constantly thinking about the projects I'm working on, whether I'm sitting at my desk or not, so billing daily works really well for making sure I'm compensated for the value I'm providing."
freelance,34s59k,honestlytrying,1 point,Thu May 7 17:46:11 2015 UTC,I don't know why I've never done this. In the film world the concept of a day rate is pretty prevalent. I may give this a try sometime.
freelance,34n1ki,Sufcluke7,6,Sat May 2 17:29:07 2015 UTC,Nope.
freelance,34n1ki,MtSnowden,8,Sat May 2 18:42:22 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately no. You have to request them to release the funds by clicking the green button under Billing & Invoices in your workroom.  Only work with new prospects who are verified and have completed more than 1 job, if they are it means that the Elance has the funds in their hands (escrow) and not the customer. Best of luck!"
freelance,34n1ki,IamZepia,5,Sat May 2 19:06:18 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks. So if I click ""job complete"" then I am saying that I have completed the task I was given? But after I have done that, can I then still request payment?"
freelance,34n1ki,IamZepia,4,Sat May 2 20:30:44 2015 UTC,"Correct. If you and your client have agreed that the job is complete (through messages and make sure he/she is completely satisfied) then click job complete then immediately request to release payment.  Some people create milestones and you should too (pay me half now then the other half when the job is delivered) this will make sure there's a mutual trust between you too.  You already busted your ass and now it's time to get paid, but always makes sure your client is 100% satisfied before clicking on the ""job completed""  Another thing you should try is to hire someone to do a job for you and see how the process works in the other end, Post a quick and easy job for $25 and you get to see other successful proposals from top notch elancers or maybe help someone who has just started their freelance career.  Let me know if you have any other questions."
freelance,34n1ki,letscee,2,Sat May 2 21:06:34 2015 UTC,"There is also the concept of escrow. The clients funds the escrow, and only then you start work. I remember doing that too."
freelance,34n1ki,thewriteways,2,Sun May 3 01:30:22 2015 UTC,"Clicking ""Job Complete"" doesn't make it seem as if you have been paid fully. I'd send them a message saying ""I believe I have completed/ fulfilled all of the work that we had agreed upon, so I have marked this job as complete. If everything looks good to you, please release the funds from escrow.""   I know you didn't ask for all this info, but you said you're trying to be extra careful, so here's a few tips I've learned and stuck with to make sure I get paid (AFTER I got screwed over just starting out):  1.) Only do fixed price jobs, and only work when the client fills escrow. (Hourly jobs have NO protection, fixed price has escrow as protection.) 2.) Set up more than one milestone, and request payment after completing each milestone. 3.) Only take on clients that have paid money for work before (They need to have at least TWO dots next to their name, one only means they added a payment method to their account.) Also, people who have left good feedback/ get good feedback from freelancers get brownie points to me, haha. Contrariwise, I avoid people that start their job post out really spammy like ""LOW QUALITY WORK WILL BE REJECTED + BAD FEEDBACK  + WE'LL KILL YOUR DOG"" Not really those exact words, but you get the idea."
freelance,34n1ki,Cythammer,1 point,Mon May 4 23:07:46 2015 UTC,"Wait, for point 1., I though the point of Work View was so that hourly jobs would have payment protection? Or is that wrong?"
freelance,34n1ki,thewriteways,2,Mon May 4 23:13:33 2015 UTC,"I believe Elance's intentions for work view is to make the client feel better, by knowing how the freelancer is spending their time, and making the freelancer feel better, by being able to log ALL the work they did.  But it doesn't guarantee payment. The client can agree with all the hours you put in work view and still disappear when the project is done. It happened to me.   With escrow, the client actually gives the money to Elance, and once you finish the work, if the client decides to bail, you can just contact Elance and they can release escrow instead. That's also happened to me, haha. IMO its the only way to be essentially 100% sure you'll get payment."

freelance,34lqan,freelance_writer,2,Sat May 2 10:22:33 2015 UTC,I did my first ever writing gig on Fiverr and then elance....I mostly use elance now.
freelance,34lqan,Oax_Mike,1 point,Sun May 3 03:45:33 2015 UTC,"How's that work for you? There's a lot of hate towards Elance because the international market makes it tough for workers in certain countries to make a living wage ($2/hour will not work in the US). On the other hand, I've heard some good stories, too. Curious what your experience has been like."
freelance,34lqan,pokeyoupine,3,Tue May 5 04:34:38 2015 UTC,"You have to be patient and it takes time to sift through all the shit jobs but I now make between $30-35/hr on the jobs I get through elance. It took about a year to work up to this wage but I'd say I was making $20/hr within 2-3 months of joining.  There are basically 4 types of clients on elance with regards to writing work:   Companies looking for SEO garbage...they really don't care if the content is readable or ""good"" since they don't plan on anyone ever reading it...these people are fine paying $2-5/article since they aren't actually showing the articles to end users. Companies that are cheap and actually think they can get quality writing for $5-10/hour (or less)....this is the most common group and it's pointless to try and deal with them. Some will figure it out over time and raise rates and some won't.  Companies that understand the ability to write grammar free and coherently is not the same as being a good writer. They actually want to send this content to clients/prospective clients in newsletters and share it via social media. They want content that their readers actually want to read and are willing to pay $30-50/article to get it. This is who the average freelancer needs to target and who I target. Of course I'd say this group makes up less than 5% of all jobs posted on elance...but they're out there.  Companies looking for a highly-specialized writer to write truly journalistic level articles or case studies. Also in this group are companies looking for top level copywriters. These companies are willing to pay $100-200/article but this isn't stuff anyone can just research and writer about. You do actually need to be in the field and know what you're talking about.   Anyhow....so the key is getting a solid base of clients and not bidding on new jobs all the time. It takes time to skim the jobs, apply to 10 and only get 1. So what you have to do is find clients who are looking for long-term help. If you write one $35 article and that is all they ever want it is not really worth your time by the time you did all the crap to get that job...but if you write one $35/week for a year then it is.  So it's about building a base of former clients....so that when your workload gets slow you can email everyone up and say ""Hey, I've got some free time, do you need anything?"" Or you can even email a list of 10 article ideas and say ""Any of these sound good?"" Often clients get busy and neglect their blog but if you offer up ideas they will buy all of them. I just contacted an old client last week with 10 ideas and they want all of them at $30 a pop and they added in another $540 project on the side....I will be able to finish all of this in under 30 hours so this makes for a pretty good week.  I don't freelance full time as my top priority is growing my wife and I's boutique beach resort but when I do have free time I can certainly make decent money doing the writing on the side...like I said, about $30-35/hr as most articles take me one hour to write.  Here's the kicker, though....you have to actually be a good writer to earn this wage.  Most people on elance aren't good writers. They think they are, but they are not. Again, writing grammar free and coherent is not enough, you need to be able to write compelling content people actually want to read....and you have to be able to write very fast for this to be profitable."
freelance,34lqan,Oax_Mike,1 point,Tue May 5 13:07:46 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you for the comprehensive response. (This kind of stuff is the reason I love reddit).   I think you make great points about the breakdown of clients. It seems like a lot of your energy needs to go into weeding through the crap that's up there. For example, I put together a handful of proposals yesterday and have had two responses. One was a 3,000 word ebook that had no proposed budget. Based on the topic and complexity, I bid $750. The person came back to me and said, ""Would you be interested in doing it for $30?"" There's definitely crap out there...  Sounds like you've done a good job making Elance work for you. I'm giving it a shot even with the negativity around the web and we'll see how it works!"
freelance,34lqan,pokeyoupine,1 point,Tue May 5 17:58:01 2015 UTC,"From my personal experience about $40/500 words seems to be the max you're going to get without actually being an industry expert in the field you are writing for....when I had enough work I tried to bid $50-60/500 words for a couple months just to try and land a few high paying clients but nobody ever bit.  For sales copy you can get these rates...I am just talking about articles.  So $250 is probably more reasonable for a 3,000 word ebook, even if you're a good writer.  The thing is...to make decent money at this you need to be pretty fast as well...about 500 words per hour or 1.5 hours max.  But yeah, most of elance is utter crap...but you can find decent clients in there over time."

Then say you have a Plan B (the ""unparenting everything and animating manually"") which will take Amount $B.  And then say that before you embark on Plan B you would like to spend a few hours, for Amount $C1, to work on potential Plan C (""figure out a quicker way"") which will potentially cost Amount $C2."

I've worked with others on projects before and have been on both ends, asking  for materials / clarification / help and being asked.  Never thought much of it, always assumed is normal part of collaboration when a company hires multiple firms/freelancers to work on something.   Also good learning lesson for future - never provide our age to a quote before you can really get your hands on the materials and evaluate them.  Since the company seemz pretty friendly in your case,  I'd advise an honest approach telling them you found this hurdle that will take longer and asking if they have a better suggestion to save time."

They just want a great looking website.   -Not really... Some clients might have different needs so as the developer you have to make that call. Once again, as the professional that's generally why they are hiring you.  -Kind of the same question.  I am the Director of an agency and also freelance full-time. It is our stance, as a company, to guide the client. We are the marketing professionals. In my experience this is the best approach to a client relationship because as soon as the tables turn a lot of clients will start demanding/holding their account hostage. I don't mean just do what ever you want... The client plays a HUGE role in the direction of the website. With that being said, administrative decisions like choosing the CMS is our job because it's what we do."
freelance,34it1b,jameswesleyhunt,2,Fri May 1 15:21:48 2015 UTC,"Most clients think they want a CMS until they go into the admin, get confused and then ask you to update it. Or they update it 2-3x a year and don't realize it would have cost less to have you update it and not have jimmied their design into a CMS at all.   I'm starting to learn heavily toward static sites.   Otherwise, like /u/jameswesleyhunt said, depends on the client and their needs. Guide them."
freelance,34it1b,rylanb,3,Fri May 1 16:31:10 2015 UTC,I generally try to nab clients onto a retainer that would include updates and minor changes. I just package it into a year-long hosting contract. We also offer free CMS trainings after every website launch just to get the client oriented with their new site. Overall it's always worked out well.

From logging in to making basic site changes.  It generally takes about an hour. Most clients are grateful that I take the time to do the training but afterward the majority of my clients sign on for retainer and I make changes for them."

I just launched my company two months ago, have four clients on 12-month contracts but their pricing for these things is all over the map just because of how quickly everything came together for me. One thing I haven't had time to do yet is go back and determine permanent pricing for these types of things."

My hosting package doesn't include anything outside of hosting, creating backups, restoring if necessary, and small changes like adding a link to Facebook or changing some wording. It doesn't include adding pages or restructuring the site. I make that pretty clear from the beginning.   I charge $20/month to host their site but require the entire year up front.  My retainer packages are primarily SEO, social media, or PPC related. Those range from around $1,200-$2,500 right now. They pay at the beginning of every month and the retainers are 3-6 months.  Most of my retainer clients are also clients that I built the website, so that's another $4,000-$8,000... With that kind of money involved (for me anyways) I don't mind making changes to their site every once in a while. It only seems fair. Hope that helps."

I am not too far off in my pricing after my recent adjustment to prices I made after signing my fifth client. I am only charging slightly less than you but like I said, my company is only a couple of months old.  Just to clarify, you don't put stipulations/limitations on how many changes can be requested by the clients who purchase your retainer packages, correct? I currently offer a hosting and maintenance package that includes hosting, ""necessary"" CMS software (eg Wordpress) and plugin updates, as well as content updates (eg photos or text copy) that the client specifically ask for. I put a one-hour cap on the later part of that package, though (reason being.. most of my clients are small and wouldn't need any more than that + it is a fair cap, imo, for the price point I'm charging)..."

With that being said, we don't generally bid projects at an hourly rate. To be honest I just make up a number that sounds good based on the scope of work and the duration of the project.   I'm always pretty direct when it comes to the client's budget. I literally just ask, ""What is your budget for the project."" If the client tries to skirt around the question I just tell them that it's extremely important that I know how much money they have to devote so that I can develop a strategy that best fits their needs. That's the truth... but it also lets me know how much money they're willing to spend.  I try to come in a little under their budget and then allocate the rest of the budget towards something else.

Before project start, the client said I don't have to do all the the characters, backgrounds and other assets. But after I accept the job, they only gave me two characters and one background. I have to do all the rest.    They've changed the spec of the project and will have to pay you more money and more time. If they don't, just drop the gig. I'm confused as to why you're saying ""the client is not wiling to cancel the project"". Last time I checked, it's up to you as to whether or not you accept it."

freelance,34e1uw,wtf_are_my_initials,12,Thu Apr 30 11:50:50 2015 UTC,I am a freelance web dev in NY and my agreement clearly states that all time spent on communication and travel is billable. I have that in place because I consider consultation as a part of the service I provide. I also have seen many colleagues make the mistake of not charging for phone calls etc and then spending more hours on the phone than actual work. The only time I would not bill a client for a meeting is if I will gain new business as a result of it. I think in your case it depends on what your contract states and what you agreed to with the client.
freelance,34e1uw,planktonking,7,Thu Apr 30 12:59:28 2015 UTC,Care to share your wording for that clause in your contract?
freelance,34e1uw,rmblr,5,Thu Apr 30 13:17:52 2015 UTC,"Of course, this is what I use and I stole it from docracy    Office Hours & Communication. Office hours are Monday through Friday 8:00 am to 5:00pm (PST). Email is to be the primary form of communication between Client and Service Provider. Service Provider is available for phone calls during office hours only. Occasional calls of only a few minutes in duration are not typically billed to Client. However, the time of both parties must be respected, and calls lasting over 10 minutes will be billed to Client. Telephone meetings must be prescheduled. Cancellation requires a minimum of 24 hours advance notice. Missed meetings or cancellations without sufficient notice will be billed to Client. Expenses. Expenses incurred on behalf of Client are not included in any fees and will be billed to Client. Reimbursable expenses may include, but are not limited to, office supplies (e.g., file folders, envelopes, CDs, labels, etc.), mileage, long-distance telephone charges, payments made to vendors, and shipping and handling costs. Long-distance telephone calls will be billed at a rate of $0.25 per minute. There is a one-hour minimum for office calls. On-site visits will be billed for meeting time, roundtrip travel and mileage. Payment is due upon receipt.    EDIT: Added an additional clause that is relevant, both clauses are from the docracy sample"

freelance,34e1uw,RollX,3,Thu Apr 30 12:48:27 2015 UTC,"You should definitely charge for time spent in meetings.   When you are in meetings, you are providing direct value to your client and they should pay for that. If they couldn't meet with you, then they wouldn't get what they needed. If they can get what they need without meeting with you, why are they inviting you to the meeting?  Also, time spent in meetings is time not spent on other billable work. Why should one client get to monopolize your valuable time for free?  What if they try to say meeting time is less valuable than dev time? Meeting time should be more valuable than dev time. If not, you need to reevaluate which meetings you agree to attend.  It's an even easier decision if you are onsite for the meeting. In that case you'd be crazy if you didn't charge.  As an added bonus, if the client knows they will be paying for your time in meetings, they are less likely to invite you if it is just going to waste your time.  Here are some other tasks you should charge for, that most don't."
freelance,34e1uw,jaf656s,2,Thu Apr 30 19:58:24 2015 UTC,"It depends. My work and billing is project-based or off a day rate, so it will likely be different if you bill hourly. Sometimes I'll negotiate a day rate for prep, if there's going to be significant meetings before hand needed. But usually if it's just something like Let's grab some coffee or a beer, go over some things, when are you free? I don't charge for it.  The general rule I use is if they're asking for exclusive access of my time, I bill for it. If they're flexible and can let me choose when we meet, I don't. But again, I don't bill hourly, so if they want a meeting for prep at a specific time, I let them know that I'll be billing them a day for prep (most times they decide it's not really that important)"

Everyone rips everyone off and if you're so concerned make your code samples tutorials on your site that are OK to use. Or make some stupid crap and open source it so people know you can code.

The only way to assure that this market stays healthy is if people are delivering prices and quotes across all ranges of the board.  As the market continues to evolve, customers will learn what their money gets them and make their choices accordingly.    If all freelancers raise their prices in an attempt to not undersell, people will just stop using freelancers and move to agencies.  Hourly rates and contracts should be priced taking many factors into consideration, and some of those factors will often result in rates that will blow competition out of the water.  Those two people who underbid your photo shoot by $7500 may have been just as capable and skilled as you, but maybe they just needed the money more, or the hit to them with this project was worth landing a multi-million dollar corporate client for repeat business.

freelance,346o9v,blu3soup,5,Tue Apr 28 18:56:05 2015 UTC,"Hi bud,  I am a freelance web designer. I started building websites professionally at the beginning of 2012. I had previous experience building sites for personal use prior to that.   My first web job was through a referral by a friend. I charged $300, I believe. My second job was a gym that some people I knew were opening. I asked them if they had a website, and if not, could I build one for them. They said yes. That job was $400.  After that I spent a bit of time building sites for myself and researching, learning, etc. My next big job was the apartment complex that I lived in. I wasn't making a lot of money at my other job and didn't want to pay rent so I asked the apartment manager if I could build a website for that month's rent. She said yes... The owner of the building had 2 other apartment complexes so I built 3 websites instead of just 1. They paid me in 3 months rent.  Fast forward and I built websites for friends, got some more referrals, and then took a job with an agency. My portfolio increased and so did my abilities.  Now I pick and choose work. Most of my work comes to me through referrals or SEO. I won't touch a job for less than $4,000 on a project that's short turnaround. If it's a lengthier project then I charge upwards of $7,500.   Yes, I travel. I'm actually leaving Saturday for Vancouver. I will be staying in a pent house for a couple days then going to the island and staying in a cabin. I will bring my computer and work from there.  I actually moved to a different country while freelancing. I'm up in Canada for the year and will be moving somewhere else next year. That's what working from home allows you to do.  I don't know that I would have done anything differently. I've wasted a lot of money trying new things. I don't regret that. You never know unless you try. Maybe I would have been more direct and confident in myself early on. I got the walk around multiple times... People wouldn't pay on time... I was stressed. But that's all part of the gig. You live and learn. Things are good now. That's the journey.  Best of luck."

You could probably get away with it if it was all cash under the table, but once companies start paying you more than $600 for projects, they have to file 1099s, which means you have to send a W9.... which will be difficult because you don't have a SSN.   You have to find a company willing to sponsor you for a work visa, which is very expensive on the company's part. It will be hard to  move from that first company to a different company because not a lot of companies are willing to hire foreigners because Visas are expensive, and so whatever company that does hire you will probably overwork you because they know you have little choice in finding a better job. I've seen that happen a lot here.   The tech/design market is good in Texas, but if you're a foreigner you will have a harder time finding a job, and you'll run into a lot of legal problems freelancing. An entry level job as a designer in Houston will probably get you between 30k to 35k, depending on your portfolio and experience."

freelance,3471jh,pfromad,2,Wed Apr 29 04:20:04 2015 UTC,"I had an awesome gig working at a small press comic book publisher before I started going to college full time.  I was a print production assistant  and had many chances to learn about comic book life.  First, the truth is there isn't a lot of money in comics and there really isn't a lot of money in indy comics. But there are still artists who are successful and can live off the income from their artistic endeavors.  Being an artist means not only putting in the work to make the comics, but also the work of promotion, marketing, branding and all the other minutiae of running any small business. Be prepared to spend time art conventions promoting your self and your work.  Pick your publisher wisely, most comic work is contract work. Learn about negotiating contracts, understand who retains ownership of your published work, who gets the royalties, what residual income means.  Know how to ask for help or find a collaborator. Writer/artist teams are pretty common even in indy circles.  Diversify your media. Don't just stick to making comics. Make limited edition art prints, make t-shirts, make vinyl toys. Explore how music, film, and other non visual media can enhance your fan's experience.  Last, not making your whole living doing comics does not mean your only employment option is office hell. There are so many administrative and support roles in the creative industry which can sustain you and let you be close to your passion.  Successes is possible if you want it bad enough."

If you know who you are, what your style is and what you're capable of and how people should remember you as there are plenty of other freelancers out there all fighting for attention.   One advantage of using your personal name is that it's more personable and people will remember your name when they see your work.   And the advantage of using a business/""studio "" name is that you can get friends to help out with freelance if you can't make the deadline and not feel bad about it as the clients didn't hire a single person. They hired a business. Even though that business usually consists of just one person.   But it's just my opinion though.   I do a mix of both. My brand name has my name in it. But I'm still trying to figure out a strong identity."

freelance,3445lr,__shittyprogrammer__,2,Thu Apr 30 17:07:06 2015 UTC,"I use both...  I have a personal website and YouTube channel. One of my bigger freelance clients was a referral client that only knows me by name and has really seemed to enjoy working with me as an individual. Actually when I was first told about the possibility of working with this business, the person that referred me said they were specifically looking for an individual and not a business entity to do the work.  I also just launched a new entity under an agency name. It will be geared towards a much larger audience and scale. I don't think I could break into the market as an individual the same way I am trying to as an agency in this case.  I think both have advantages and disadvantages. There are a lot of businesses who won't work with freelancers because a ""business"" generally adds credibility. At the same time I enjoy just being myself and not having to come across as anything more."
freelance,3445lr,jameswesleyhunt,2,Tue Apr 28 18:11:36 2015 UTC,In terms of branding I do both.  However all contracts with clients are under my business entity because it makes taxes and all other formal stuff so much easier.
freelance,344cfw,aatila,4,Tue Apr 28 04:56:28 2015 UTC,"I've had very good luck on both. I signed up like 5-6 years ago, but didn't do really anything on either because of the amount of competition and lowball offers from foreign companies.   However, I decided to give it another go about a month ago when I  decided I wanted to get back into doing freelance web dev work. Here are a few tips that worked for me:   When you are new, you are competing with established accounts, with reputation. Make yourself stand out. Don't just copy/paste your applications to all jobs (as tempting as it may be when you're applying a lot). This brings me to my next tip: When applying, make it known that you're not copy/pasting. Call/Point something out that shows that you actually read their project brief. It's clear when the response is a copy/paste. To go along with the previous tip: Apply A LOT!! I burned through my connects in my first month and bought more. To start with, I was maybe getting 1 job for every 10 I applied for. Don't get discouraged. Stay competitive with your pricing, but don't sell yourself short. Make sure it's worth your time. The client doesn't always (more often than not even) hire the cheapest proposal. People understand that you get what you pay for. I've already had a number of jobs where I had to fix someone else's work, because they went with the cheap option. Communicate with your clients...A LOT! Especially early on. Keep them informed the whole way. Deliver on-time or early...ALWAYS! Unless it's absolutely out of your control. I had a client recently that couldn't get the original artwork from their designer so I had to extract it from screen grabs. I made sure to point out to the client this will delay the delivery - see previous tip. This and the previous tip are very import early on since you want good (perfect) reviews from your first few jobs. Well, you always want that, but you definitely want it early on as you start to develop your profile/feedback/rating.   I'm sure I could think of more, but this is what I've relied on for the past month, and done fairly well. Hope this helps. Best of luck to you"

Tried everything from short & simple, to in depth & complex, expensive and lowballing,  I even did a couple of video proposals to no avail.  I check it periodically but now I only waste time applying for something that looks very reasonable and fair for both me and the client, otherwise I save my time"

Decide on who you want to target too.  Do you want it to be a site where people go FIND their freelancer? Or do you want it a place where freelancers go to get hired?  Either way just cater for that target market so like if you want it for people looking for a freelancer then have a basic search box, some basic criteria and let them search based on location their nearest freelancers.

In this case, as in most cases, honesty is the best policy. Tell them you were a bit hasty in your estimate and that the time required to complete the project at the quality they want us longer than you estimated. 9/10 they'll say no problem. The 1/10, they either want someone cheaper, in which case you bail, or they legit need it sooner, in which case you bail.   Regardless of your contract you have zero obligation to perform services for money not yet rendered. That means if they haven't paid in full, you don't owe them. That's only relevant if they try to throw breach of contract suits in your face. In which case, you should laugh at them heartily. I recommend Skype for the full effect.   Seriously though, don't ask for more money, but just tell them you erred in your estimation and ask for a longer deadline. They'll either okay it or cancel. You're ahead of it here, so there's not much to worry about. If you were on the eleventh hour it would be a different story."

freelance,34016m,toomanylayers,12,Mon Apr 27 05:35:58 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not an expert here - but stop-motion strikes me as such an overwhelmingly small niche that clients are likely to be few and far between, regardless of your price.  In your shoes I'd acknowledge this fact, charge the upper limit of what I think my work is worth/what the market can bear, and trust that clients who are legitimately interested in my  niche services are likely willing to pay a premium.  EDIT: I didn't address your portfolio. Again, especially with such a niche medium, I wouldn't wait for clients to develop my portfolio - nor would I undercharge. If there's no work coming in, I'd start working on additional projects to add to my portfolio of my own volition.  In the long run, the value of under-charging a few clients in order to add to your portfolio is likely to be neutralized by the additional money you could've earned from those cheaper jobs, and by setting a precedent with that client and their network that you'll work for bargain-basement prices."

Re: stop motion - would recommend networking with studios that do a lot of stop motion work. It's such a niche, I think finding clients directly would be tough. Studios/production companies take care of that part for you.

I have two friends at my studio working on stop motion projects for music videos but they pitched those concepts. Their clients didn't come to them with that intention.   If you're outside of a major city (I'm in NYC) your pool of clients and their ability to pay you properly drops significantly.   Stop motion is so time intensive that you'll be hard pressed to generate sustainable income off of it unless you're working within a larger entity.   Two questions for you:   Is stop motion your passion? Or is animation, generally? Would you be happy doing a broad range of animation work for clients while keeping your stop motion for personal projects? As a stop motion animator, what skills and traits have you developed that can separate you from others out there? Are there fundamental stop motion skills you can merge into other animation projects that would set you apart? An obvious one that comes to mind is an incredible attention to detail.    Synthesizing skills and mental models from multiple disciplines can give you a huge advantage of others in your field. Just because stop motion is a niche, it doesn't stop you from applying it's principles/values/skills to new areas."
freelance,34016m,automaticyes,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:23:10 2015 UTC,"Take a look at Patrick Boivin's stuff: https://www.youtube.com/user/PatrickBoivin  He regularly feeds his Youtube channel with new animations. Rather than making custom puppets, he uses readily available toys of popular characters (rigged for animation). I think he's getting some of the toys donated from toy manufacturers. He shoots characters on green screen and composites them into backgrounds afterwards, in order to keep it simple. It's just not worth building actual miniature sets for these short videos. Check out his making-of:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1WsgasZBg0  Most of his stuff is really short and often mashes up characters from different franchises. For instance, Darth Vader vs. Indiana Jones here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZGX2qtW2Kc  Many of his videos gathered millions of views and this led to a number of contracts for big companies (Samsung, Disney, Lego and so on). And that's without taking into account the Youtube ad revenue.  It's probably not possible to replicate his success, but there are interesting leads there. The key is not to build your portfolio with complete projects (for example, a 12 minute short-film which will take you a year to do) but rather with very short tidbits that show different facets of your animation skills. Your market will be short web-commercials, so your portfolio should emphasize this type of content."

Then either your costs are too high or you're not finding high-price clients.   Is it normal to undercharge when you're starting out   It's not only normal, it's mandatory.   even if you consider your personal/school work worth more?   They're not. Trust me on this.   Its worth pointing out that stop motion tends to be more expensive then other mediums and clients are constantly surprised by the price.   It's a niche. You're severely limiting yourself if you're just looking to do stop-motion. What else can you do?"

freelance,33wkcp,mayonuki,3,Mon Apr 27 04:59:18 2015 UTC,Never really been an issue.  I make sure they know my availability and I let them know if I can't make a meeting.   To be frank I'm hired for decently high level positions so I have a lot of leverage - I'm not building wordpress sites. It's not easy for my clients to find quality candidates and I have way more offers than I can possible handle so most companies are willing to bend over backwards to accommodate for what I ask for.   I only really have 3 years experience but it's all about positioning yourself as premium and not cheap.  I made it clear in my interviews I'm someone you bring on as employee #1 to design complex systems from scratch and help the company grow the engineering team.

So if you are a ruby developer who is a perfect fit for that job or gig, you may have to wait months for something like that.   So you have to know where to find clients.

freelance,33wkcp,letscee,3,Sun Apr 26 14:43:42 2015 UTC,"Given you're a student just starting out, you'll be caught in the whole ""lack of experience"" nonsense.   I would suggest getting some projects off the ground by yourself (AKA make an app or a website). The design/development/deployment will be worth it's weight in gold. These projects will come to serve as your qualifications for private jobs and gathering clients.  You could also find an established freelancer with some projects of their own. Finding and contacting these guys, you could potentially try to work your way into interning with these people, or you could ask to job shadow them.  You can definitely do all of your freelancing online exclusively, I do and I know many others as well. In fact, this is the primary source of freelancing work from what I've seen in my career.  Also, hackathons look great on a resume. Even if you don't win, keep the projects you come up with and publish them to github. Not only are they cool experiences to talk about, but employers love hearing about them. One aspect I've found that works well with clients is making them feel that you are their very own ""hacker"" (never refer to yourself as one though, professionals will look at you as a joke). Explaining the various hackathons you've partaken in (or won even) is a good way to bring that perception of yourself without making any self proclamations.  Also, for ideas on some projects you could do to get yourself started, check out some of the business ideas here: https://www.cofounderslab.com/  Nice thing about CFL is that the ideas are already there, the people who had them are not programmers and are willing to split the pot with you if you code it. They'll also usually handle all marketing and non-code related business for you after you develop the product/service. Usually these guys will settle for new graduates as well, since they know you're looking to start a portfolio ;)  Hopefully this helps! :) Feel free to ask questions"
freelance,33wkcp,kamronkennedy,5,Sun Apr 26 17:20:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, freelancing fully online is still a viable option; not only is it viable, but it is growing.  A recent study published based on a partnership by Elance-oDesk revealed that approximately 42% of the estimated 53 million Americans have done online work in some capacity.  Exactly how many of these 42% freelance online 100% is uncertain, but I've met a lot of people who can't network offline to save their lives yet who have solid online freelancing careers. I've also made 100% of my income as a freelance writer online, and I'm not exactly talking chump change here.  That said, irrespective of what kind of freelancing you decide to do, I'll recommend two things:   Focus: I doubt it will be easy doing both freelance programming and writing at the same time; this kind of division in approach will most likely be more harmful than helpful.   I'll say you should focus, not just on one type of freelancing but on a particular, smaller niche within the option you eventually go for.   Preparation: I can't overstate this; don't just jump into it.   There's a lot of factors to learn as a freelancer; what is a fair rate? Who are real clients and where can they be found? Etc.  These are things you should learn so as to be prepared, and a simple Google search would reveal a lot of resources; there's a lot of helpful information within this and similar subreddits, too. Avail yourself of those.  That said, don't ""prepare"" such that you won't take action; a day or two of study/preparation, at most, before starting seems okay to me. You gain the remaining experience through practice; no shortcut to this.  I'm a freelance writer, and if you decide to go that route, here are resources that have been helpful for me:  http://writersincharge.com/110-websites-that-pay-writers/ (a listing of 110 websites that pay writers; 70 is publicly available, you need to subscribe to get the rest) http://thewritelife.com (possibly the biggest blog for writers, and they have a great deal of information about freelance writing) http://google.com (the most helpful resource I've come across; you'd be surprised that pretty much everything you need is a search away) the /r/freelanceWriters subreddit (you just need to ask if something confuses you)"

Most of my clients are international, so we communicate almost entirely online, usually via email. It's never been a problem. In my husband's case he interacts with clients mostly over the phone.   Just make sure you have a way to keep in contact with people -- email, phone, Skype, messengers, or whatever works for you. I can't imagine you'd run into a problem simply because you're not available to meet face-to-face. The easiest solution to that problem is to target non-local clients. It's rare that clients who find me online even ask me where I'm located beyond my country (to make sure they can pay me). I wouldn't worry about your location too much."

freelance,33wkcp,jennifermattern,3,Tue Apr 28 14:16:51 2015 UTC,"You target the right markets and don't worry about people who aren't really your competition. Your target market no only wants what you have to offer, but they can afford you. In my case where I'm dealing with writing, it's easier because most foreign writers (with a few exceptions) don't come across as native English speakers. And my clients can't afford to work with cheaper writers who can't communicate effectively and relate to their audiences.   When it comes to development, design, etc. where you don't have the language barrier working in your favor, it can get a bit trickier. But if you stick to the basic principle of targeting clients who can afford you, you'll be fine. Your business hours alone could make you more attractive than a freelancer overseas. So could the fact that you can be reached via phone more easily (not all clients are willing to use online services like Skype). Figure out why working with someone in your location might make the client more comfortable, and then roll those factors into your USP (where you tell prospects what sets you apart and what you can do for them)."

Here is how I am handling this (so far):  I collected six month of hosting fees for all as part of their initial deposit (all four hired me to perform other web consulting services for them too; websites, social media setup/management, etc.). I plan to bill for the final six months at the six month mark. I realize I'm eventually going to run into a potential client who wants to pay month-to-month, in which case, I would certainly have it automatically deduct if you have the capability to do that with whatever payment service you use.   Do you have contracts in place? My contracts include language stating that if payment isn't received, I have the option, at my discretion, to block access to their site altogether by suspending hosting services. I certainly wouldn't pull someone's site right away because they are one, two or even several days late, but it's a good safety net if someone is perpetually excessively late, or just flat out doesn't pay."

But I would send out a general email to the clients and let them know you are moving over to a more automated billing system. Then when they don't pay, whmcs will suspend their accounts. If they want them un-suspended  they will have to pay. It really makes billing like that easy without having to be the person that suspends the account by pushing a button."

freelance,33ubgq,im_gorideyourbike,2,Sun Apr 26 20:32:13 2015 UTC,So hopefully OP can pay $100-$200 an hour to an unknown lawyer in their town where OP makes a fraction of someone in San Francisco and maybe OP gets his/her money back....or maybe he spends a few hundred to a few thousand bucks to learn that it wasn't worth his/her time in the first place.

If your only take away is ""have a high priced lawyer"" then yes, it's not going to be very useful. My takeaway was, ""have a contract that details when you get paid and what happens when the customer does not pay you with in a certain amount of time"". Considering that OP is having trouble getting paid, I find it very useful.  You're providing a false dilemma here. Surely you accept that there are other options between having a $500/hr lawyer write you and contract and having nothing at all (not to mention that Gabe Levine also lives in San Francisco and I'm guessing OP does not). I would venture to guess that OP could find a local lawyer who would charge significantly less than $500 an hour (and maybe even be willing to trade services with OP). Even RocketLawyer only charges $60 to help you create a contract.  I also completely disagree with your statement ""there's no point in having a contract if you don't have the money to enforce it"". Enforcement doesn't have to be taking the client to court. Since OP is doing web hosting, enforcement could be as simple as including a clause in the contract that says ""if you are more than X number of days past due I reserve the right to shut your site down until you pay me X% of what is owed""."

I wouldnt think any of my clients would hire some random developer to do aomething for any where near that price.
freelance,33qroa,danohart,8,Fri Apr 24 19:08:11 2015 UTC,"Why are you doing business in such a way that you're scared to invoice? Surely you discuss pricing up front (and throughout the process if you're working on an hourly basis) so they are aware of how much time is being spent? Do you use contracts that specify pricing? (and if not, why not?)"
freelance,33qroa,falkencreative,2,Fri Apr 24 19:28:43 2015 UTC,I don't deal with contracts. I get 50% up front before starting initial work and that's worked very well. And the communication of price is there throughout the project and the clients are happy. I guess just that potential of it going south can get to me.   Thanks for your thoughts.

My heart used to race and I'd almost break into a sweat if I had to call up someone to follow up on a late payment for money I was owed for a job well done. Ridiculous, right?  I also bet that while it's uncomfortable dealing with your own invoicing/payments situation, you could do it very easily for someone else. Maybe that's imposter syndrome coming in?   It definitely does get better with experience, so don't fret - and make sure you have contracts in place with your clients so you can avoid as many unpleasant situations as possible."
freelance,33qroa,cannonpult,5,Fri Apr 24 19:29:52 2015 UTC,"I'm a blogger who does sponsored blog posts for brands. Early on, I would discuss my rate, they'd agree so I'd write the post and publish it and then they wouldn't pay. I quickly learned to require payment before I start writing to avoid wasting my time.  Since that change that I made years ago, it's rare that I have any trouble with payment now. Even if a client doesn't pay, it's not really a big deal for me because I haven't spent any time working on their blog post yet. Still, I kind of emotionally hold my breath until they pay because I'm worried that they'll back out. I know that my rates are reasonable but I guess I just worry that they won't follow through and i'll be bummed that I don't get the job. I've been doing this for 5 years and it hasn't went away."
freelance,33qroa,dh42com,3,Fri Apr 24 20:02:36 2015 UTC,"Here's just my two cents. First off, I saw you don't use contracts. Use them! It might feel like it will limit your potential clients or that it might scare some folks off, but do you really want to take on clients who are scared at the idea of being obligated to pay for your services?  Regarding the negative feeling regarding the invoice, I had the same feeling when I was first getting going with freelance web development. When you really need the money, and each invoice is very important (for basic necessities like paying bills on time), then it's a very odd feeling asking for money. I've found, though, that once I was making more money, it gets a whole lot easier to ask for it. Keep improving, keep at it, and over time once you're making more the asking part gets a whole lot easier.  Hopefully this helps!"

freelance,33qroa,jgOnReddit,3,Sat Apr 25 04:38:18 2015 UTC,"Yep.  On the one hand, you just get used to it. You do a job, you send an invoice, you get paid. It'll help when people start requesting invoices from you and it's like ""yeah, duh. Of course I'm gonna send you an invoice.""  It also gets way easier when you start valuing yourself and your work. It can be weird at first, ""Oh man people are PAYING me to do stuff? This is amazing! I hope I don't fuck it up!""  But then later you'll recognize that you're providing value and you earned that compensation. It's yours.  Also.... what happens the 10% of the time you have an issue? Maybe you need to re-evaluate your invoicing system/process."
freelance,33qroa,Jatacid,3,Fri Apr 24 22:29:43 2015 UTC,"From an ex-freelancer turned client perspective, if a freelancer is afraid of charging me for their work/time I'm instantly suspicious of the quality of work they put out. If I hire a pro, I expect them to act like a pro.  I'll give you a tip, people don't hire freelancers because of their next level skills (most of the time). People hire freelancers, because the scope of the job is not enough to justify the time investment of getting an actual employee for it. The vast majority of clients will always pay you. Even if you submit something that's crap, and they won't actually use, because the time it's going to take to negotiate not paying you, or try to widdle you down, is simply not worth it."
freelance,33qroa,Jammylegs,3,Sat Apr 25 01:47:11 2015 UTC,"I have the unique background of working in financial planning (dealing with financial behavior) and freelance web design. Your sentiment is common amongst a lot of freelancers and new business owners.   There are a lot of great points in this thread. I'd like to offer another perspective. It deals with financial behavior and perception. Fear usually comes from the unknown.   The two most common causes of the symptoms you've described are a negative connotation with money and not feeling that you are actually worth what you charge.  Negative Connotation with Money Many people believe that the desire for more money is inherently bad.  Typically this feeling comes from a lack of financial education (/r/personalfinance) rather than some altruistic part of their character shining through. When we don't have a solid concept of what it costs to support ourselves over the course of a lifetime, it's easy to lump financial emotions together and just mentally write off the concept of money.  You can change this perception though and be a better person because of it.   Learn some personal finance and basic economics. It helps a lot to grasp the macro picture of money in our world. How much wealth is in the world, America, Europe, other places? How does wealth move around? What good is being done with money? Where does money come from? What alternatives are there to money? What is fiat money?   Additionally it helps to understand what you would need to provide for your family and to live a middle class life-style after retirement. What is the cost of raising a child, 20-year term life insurance, college costs 20 years from now, property insurance, a catastrophic accident, becoming the parent of a special needs child? How much do you need to have saved at age 65 to have $50,000 a year until you are 85 or 95?  When you know the answers to these questions, you'll have less hesitation when asking for that next invoice. You'll see how it fits into a much larger lifetime financial picture and is anything but greedy and selfish.   Remember, money is a means to an end.   Feeling that you are not actually worth what you charge  This feeling is often a symptom of not taking the time to figure out why you are worth what you charge. Many freelancers will periodically increase their rates a little bit at a time. This makes ""guilty invoicing"" increasingly difficult when you don't really know why you are charging your rate.  Beyond the actually deliverable (website, copy, logo, film etc.), you must clearly define why the client benefits from working with you over others.   Do you believe there are other freelancers offering pretty much the same thing you offer? Do you think the client could get a similar service for less money fairly easily? Do you feel like your rates might be a bit high? Would it be crazy to immediately double or triple your rate? Do you worry about losing business because of your rate?  If you're saying yes or maybe to any of those statements, then you need to take some time and figure out how you can start delivering VALUE to client and not just the requested deliverable.  Dealing in the commodity deliverable business (aka being a task monkey) is an infinite ride on the hamster wheel.  Finding a specialty and creating unique value is a foundation for building a business.  When you can fully stand behind the VALUE of what you deliver, you can stand up in front of a group of people and concisely explain with confidence and conviction why your rates are worth it.  Read this book.  Hopefully this info helps. With confidence in your services and a healthy view of money, you'll look forward to invoicing. For many, it's one of the best parts of the job!"

freelance,33q2t5,illusion_of_choice,2,Sat Apr 25 03:32:38 2015 UTC,"From a different industry perspective.. let's say you know how to build houses.  Now a client comes along and asks you to build a structure whose requirements explicitly are not up to code.  You would not be in trouble for building what you are asked.  But your client would be in trouble for selling that as a house.  And do you even know they are going to sell it as a house?  Maybe it's for a film set and it's going to be blown up or something temporary like that.  IANAL but you aren't the one that would be sued.  There are so many chess/checkers/findmycar/compass apps and they are bound to be 95% the same.  So I would say warn them that they might be asked to take the app down, but that you'll still build it (and be paid for it) if they want to proceed."
freelance,33q2t5,pm_me_your_dial_tone,5,Fri Apr 24 19:21:16 2015 UTC,"First of all, no builder in their right mind would intentionally build a house not up to code without knowing why. A builder can definitely be sued for negligence.  Regarding OP's situation, the client is not simply asking to make another app just like all the other apps in a crowded market. OP is being asked to blatantly copy a specific competing product. Saying that OP isn't the one who would get sued is reckless advice. Honestly, I think it's more likely that the app would just get yanked from the app store than spawn a lawsuit, but if there were a legal battle, OP could definitely get dragged into it. Under U.S. Copyright law, anyone involved in unauthorized use of a copyrighted work, from the initial copying through publication and distribution, is liable for infringement.

In general #1 thing I see is this: too many words, too much copy. Too much fluff, too few concrete results.   My services is what makes me unique. Anyone can master a tool, but not everyone can offer a unique vision of your project.   How do I know this? Give me an example.   It 's one of the most amazing tasks a guru can dream of. The final result will be bug free and good looking. You have my word.   I don't pay people on their word. I pay them on results.  Cut it down. Use bullet points. Guide me through step by step.   What problem does your potential client have. How do you uniquely solve this problem. Give specific examples. Numbers don't lie (e.g. increased user base by XX%. Achieved XX downloads. Use your own metrics.) What does the world look like for the client when the problem is solved.   Even if I know what REST, Objective C, and Swift is, I don't care, those are minimum requirements of anyone I am going to hire. And if I am hiring a developer for freelance, I might not even know know what these are.   What do I want? A kick-ass iOS app. How that happens is your job. What I want to see is previous results.  This photo is actually one of the best photos for thinking about marketing. You are trying to sell me on how great the fire flower is. I want to know how awesome I'll be as Fire Mario."
freelance,33ndnr,cannonpult,3,Fri Apr 24 06:18:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed with everyone else about moving away from online freelancer pits.  One problem with jobs like the one you applied to is that they are likely reselling your work to an end client. So you aren't even talking to the client. You're talking to a ""project manager."" This means you're losing money right off the bat, won't be able to capitalize on the client's other needs, and 100 other negatives that come with this sort of work. In short, you're a task monkey working for the person who is actually benefiting from the client relationship. This is a poor business model.  As far as the proposal itself, here's a challenge. Get rid of the word ""I"" and start using ""you.""  Stop talking about the technology, and start talking about the benefits. This is 100x easier to do when you are talking to the actual client and not somebody who is white-labeling your work.  EVERY freelancer is ""the best at x.""  The statement is unfortunately meaningless when everybody else can say it. What is it about YOU that will make hiring you a better decision than hiring somebody else?  Talking about skills/tech like RESTful API, iOS, iOS 8+, well-documented, highly flexible, object-oriented code does not touch emotionally with clients. Those things need to be discussed but you will have more success by assuming that the client doesn't know what they actually need, therefore this needs to be discussed.  Almost all clients suffer from Shiny Object Syndrome. They decide they have some time to work on online marketing, identify a ""problem"" (""I need a blog""), and then Google a solution (""How to build a blog"").  That's when they come to you and say ""hey I need to build a WordPress site using a theme I found."" They're already 5 steps in the wrong direction. It's not their fault though - online marketing is hard, confusing, and changes fast.   At this point most devs/designers say ""sure thing, I'm the best task monkey around and can press the buttons on the keyboard better than the other 5 millions people doing the same thing.""  Then the client says ""oh, well how cheap will you do it for?""  Then you say ""well, for some crazy reason nobody has been hiring me so I'll throw out an offer of desperation further cementing myself at the bottom of the pool - how's about $150?""  The client bites (sometimes) and you keep spinning the hamster wheel.  Now what if you had assumed that this client who decided they needed a WordPress site might actually be saying something deeper?   Why do you need a WordPress site? ""A blog.""  Why do you need a blog? ""Because I don't have one.""  Why do you think you need one? ""Because my buddy Bill has one""  Why does that matter to you? ""Well Bill says he's getting traffic from it"" Why do you think you need web traffic? ""Because I own a mouse trap company and want to increase my online presence in my town.""  OK, do you have a budget for online marketing? ""I wouldn't tell you because you'll just say the site costs whatever I tell you."" Knowing your budget helps me determine the best solution. If it's $100,000 I don't want to suggest a $5,000 solution, because that would be ridiculous. Vice versa is also ridiculous. Furthermore, I can come up with solutions a, b, c that will be budget max, somewhere mid-way and then the cheap route. Each will have it's own benefits and you can choose. ""OK, well the company has a $15,000 online marketing budget."" OK, I'd like to spend some time with you researching your company to see if a blog will accomplish getting more traffic. We may likely find a solution that gives an even better return on investment than a blog. This will save you money, increase traffic, maximize the effect of each dollar budgeted, and likely minimize the amount of work you need to do.  At this point you'll know whether the client is going to be great (a good fit) or if you should suggest they are a better fit elsewhere. It's a win/win. You either get a great client or continue prospecting for great clients. And you should only be doing one of those two things.  See the difference?  Most of the time, the client is already 5 steps in the wrong direction by the time they reach out to you. You've got to learn this is the case and that you must dismantle this thinking to start over on the right path."

How long would it take you to build this barebones website?   The answers:    Cheap folks who will consume massive amounts of your time and energy. No, it won't. People usually have a business problem that the site needs to solve. My bet is this won't solve that. Time for you to actually do the work, not long. Time spent dealing with a super demanding customer who is trying to get as much as possible from a $99 website, way more then it's worth.    You don't need to use these kinds of tricks to get customers. I can promise you 99% of the customers that you would attract by doing this will not be the kinds of customers you will want to deal with.

An alternative solution that's worked and brings in clients is ordering a small but complimentary service to get your foot in the door.  For example, I do web design and photography for small businesses, and I started offering Google plus business page set ups for $75. This allowed me to get a number of clients that I could up sell my design services to.  About 10% of the people that hired me for the business page set up had me redesign their current website.

freelance,33ktxn,yaazz,6,Thu Apr 23 17:56:37 2015 UTC,"You're actually asking two separate questions so I'll address the second first.   Now imagine that this project is very important for you - either because you are new in business, or you are going through a slack period. So, how do you come up with a reasonable figure, in that situation?   Being new to business and going through a slack period are actually moot points. They only affect YOU emotionally and the reality is if the client was a malicious person they could use these points to drive your rate down. So why even include it in the discussion?  Projects should only be important to you if you've decided they are in the niche you want to work in. Trust me, an android app with a web-version is not a small enough niche. Now if you told me you were taking an existing android app and creating a web-version for that app that would be a smaller and more interesting niche. And I could see justifying a discount on your rate if you wanted to get into that space.   Now how are you supposed to come up with that quote? Are there any guidelines in calculating these figures. Or, can we get some supply/demand stats for each category like Android, so we can establish some support/resistance levels?   These are more productive questions. You've got a budget in mind so how do you come up with a quote?  One school of thought is to take a comparable salary for the job (android and web developer) and reverse engineer an hourly rate from that salary. Once you come up with that hourly rate you multiply it by 3x to account for benefits/overhead and slack periods.  But then you have to ask yourself how many hours this project is actually going to take which is a much more difficult question especially if you have no experience with these technologies.  Another way to approach this problem is to brake things down into more achievable goals. ""Android app with a web-version"" is super general and as some other comments alluded to not something that could be done with a 1000$ budget even if you were charging $1/hr. I would go back to the client and ask them what they are trying to achieve? How will this product make them money? And continue asking questions until it's very apparent what they value. Once you have that information you can use your expertise to come up with more realistic goals.  If you're not at that comfort level as a freelancer yet I'd say to pass on this project as it seems likely that you'll give them your hourly rate, burn through the hours you quoted and then this client will eventually complain that you've used up their budget and have nothing to show for it."
freelance,33ktxn,ryan_castillo,3,Thu Apr 23 13:00:18 2015 UTC,If you're not just a little bit uncomfortable with what you are charging then you are charging too little.  I think this applies to most people in Freelance. Know your value!

There are a lot of businesses out there and there's A LOT of money floating around. How do you expect to be ""financially successful"" low balling on your work? I used to have the mentality that I would just have to build X more number of websites a month to hit a number. Now I take the opposite approach.

freelance,33ktxn,jaf656s,2,Thu Apr 23 11:38:17 2015 UTC,"You are thinking of development like a commodity. The definition of a commodity is that you can take any 2 and they are interchangeable. In other words, I could hire you to do the work or I could hire a completely random other developer and expect the same outcome. If that were true, then I'd be stupid not to hire the person with the lowest price.  But that isn't how it works. Even at the most basic level, developers have different speeds they get work done, different amounts of bugs, different levels of quality, different styles. One developer may be able to do work others can't at all.   Go a level higher and they have different personalities, different work hours, different communication preferences, different library preferences, different framework/platform preferences, different schools of thought about how software should work.  Go another level up and they have different experience to know what's important for the success of the project and what isn't.  They'll have different management requirements. One developer might need to be told exactly what to do and will only do what the client tells them specifically to do. Another developer might understand the end goal of the project and make most of the decisions to get the best results.  All of these differences influence the value the client can get out of your work.   How the client values these things matters, too. The worst clients only care about price. They will pick the person who delivers the cheapest proposal. The best clients care about success and ROI. They will pick the person who delivers the best results, even if it may cost more.  If you can deliver what the client values (and they believe you), they will hire you.  So, clearly there's no way to have a default price for projects, because the project is different to every developer who would bid on it.  The best thing you can do for yourself is seek out clients who value the same things you do.   Choose the kind of value you want to provide then work and learn until you can deliver it."

freelance,33gvpu,MtSnowden,5,Wed Apr 22 12:45:57 2015 UTC,As a starting point it can be the same. As you get more experienced and can determine what you can actually deliver in a day AND understand the value it provides to your customers then it can become a lot more. In this process you can start to charging based on deliverables instead of time spent.  Remember the problem of charging hourly is you get penalized for doing a good job (i.e. performing it faster while maintaining the quality). Day rates are better but if you're basing them on time rather than what you're delivering you're just masking the fundamental problem.
freelance,33gvpu,ryan_castillo,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:04:50 2015 UTC,"This is exactly right.  Another hazard is breaking the day rate into an hourly computation for the client or using that computation to justify the day rate.   Then you are just going to be haggling about how many hours you worked and if you worked a full day, which gives you none of the benefits of a day rate.  That's why it is important to focus on the value of the deliverables vs the work performed."
freelance,33gvpu,jaf656s,2,Wed Apr 22 20:26:25 2015 UTC,"I'm a freelance corporate AV Tech and in my world most simply put, it's your typical hourly rate x10 for a 10 hour day. Anything over 10 hours is OT (time and a half/hour for every hour over 10 hours). It can get more complicated depending on the position you're hired for and the company you work for. Or if it's a union facility. But the beginning of this post is the basic principle of a ""day-rate"". I live in Dallas as well which I've learned is a basic example of a non-union town."

freelance,33cxlk,ryan_castillo,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:48:23 2015 UTC,I'm currently in it and have found it to be worth the money. The first 10 lessons start out slow with generic and abstract advice. Then it picks up with more actionable items. I just finished the lecture 22 - FAQ: Building a name as a new Freelancer. While his advice of going to a homeless shelter to offer free services doesn't directly apply to me it got me thinking about who I should be approaching for case studies.
freelance,33cxlk,ryan_castillo,2,Wed Apr 22 18:05:48 2015 UTC,"I've only made it through the first three modules but I can say without a doubt it's worth the money. $25 pays for a nice dinner for two, why not spend it on something that can double your earning potential?  I agree the first set of lessons start out vague but I feel that's on purpose. A lot of freelancing or taking control of your career is about getting out of your own way:   I don't feel like I can switch to freelancing. I don't feel like I can ask this person to pay me. I feel like an impostor. There is no way I can justify higher rates to myself. The worst case scenario is that I go broke.   These are all things I've heard people complain about freelancing but when you take a step back you realize they are unrealistic. As someone who helps other freelancers a lot of training involves helping them overcome their emotional constraints. This is what Seth is doing with his first set of lessons.  The lessons and his blog are brief because he puts a ton of research into them. He chooses to inspire with 200 words or 2 minutes rather than wasting his readers time. It's a super difficult task to accomplish!  I'll be working through the rest of the content today so I'll try to answer everyone's questions as they come in.  I've also created a gist with all the questions and my answers as I put them in.

There isn't really any significant guidance or any examples to make sure you're on the right track.  But maybe that's just me, judge for yourself.

freelance,33dyee,FerCrerker,9,Tue Apr 21 19:16:51 2015 UTC,"Have you checked who's done their current website? If there's a family link, watch your wording. Actually you should always be professional and not slag off at the other site. Hopefully your design isn't just 'pretty' and you have sound reasons for your design decisions that directly relate to the user experience (UX).  A business person wants to hear how this will help them, their business. Think about what you want in return, if anything.  Write them an email and briefly (time is money!) say that you're a regular customer and love their food, but as a designer you feel their website could be working harder for them / giving their customers a better experience by XXX (solid reason/explanation). Ask to meet with them over a coffee for a no-obligation meeting, where you'd like to show them how their site could be better.  Here's a current Reddit conversation with some good advice."
freelance,33dyee,Isle-of-View,2,Tue Apr 21 21:14:24 2015 UTC,This is good advice. You don't need to be overly formal or professional and meeting them in person is a much better way to sell them on the idea than over email or over the phone.

The whole website is built using Blogger, it is static with no mobile version or scalability, and honestly, it looks like it was made almost a decade ago. This restaurant is no hole in the wall either. It is a very well known, high end place with entrees starting at $25, and wine bottles as expensive as $900.  I have put as much thought into layout and user experience as I have design, because both are very important. I have appropriate call to actions, the phone number is immediately visible at the top right of the page, and the address is partially above the fold on the home page just to give you a few quick examples. The user could always go to the contact page to get the address and phone number, but I feel that contact details is one of the first things a user should see when they load a restaurant website.  Thanks for the advice and the reddit discussion! I found some great advice in there that I have taken note of.  My girlfriend actually just started working their and she mentioned what I was doing to the managers and they showed interest.

freelance,33dyee,astronoob,4,Wed Apr 22 11:47:34 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be totally honest with you: this is literally one of the worst ways to sell your services.   If a business cares enough to have a nice web-site and if they have enough money to do so, they'll do the leg work to find a web developer who they know will give it to them. They won't just sit around with a shitty ass web-site waiting for someone to come along and help them. They believe that what they have is acceptable enough that they won't value what you're trying to sell them. They're not going to come anywhere close to paying you what you should be paid for your work.   Presenting a design that you did on spec is almost universally a bad idea for a few reasons. For one thing, you created it without any input from the business owners which immediately communicates the idea that you think you know their business better than they do. Secondly, it devalues the process of collecting information from the client and refining the design based on feedback. This is the most important and time-consuming part of any design project. By devaluing it before you even walk in the door, you guarantee your client is not going to offer you the money that you deserve.   Seeing a common theme here? Working for spec, even for yourself, is a bad idea. BUT you can just approach them and suggest you could bring more value to their business by redesigning their site. They're most likely going to say no or offer you way below what you should be making. But that shouldn't matter because all you should've invested at this point is a brief email and maybe a 15-20 minute face-to-face conversation."
freelance,33dyee,astronoob,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:24:25 2015 UTC,"I cant say I completely agree with you about this being the worst way to sell my services, but from the points you have brought to light, I can understand why this is not always a good tactic. Something I would like to mention is I have very little freelance experience, so I do not have a lot of work to show for myself and I definitely do not have a clientele. So I figured a good way to start getting customers would be to take this approach, then once people start coming to me from referrals and word of mouth, I could stop using this tactic. Do you think I have the wrong mindset given my current position?   If a business cares enough to have a nice web-site and if they have enough money to do so, they'll do the leg work to find a web developer who they know will give it to them.   This is a really good point, at the same time maybe the business owners don't realize their website could be driving potential customers away due to the lack of design and UX.   you created it without any input from the business owners which immediately communicates the idea that you think you know their business better than they do.   This is true, however, all of my inspiration and everything on my style guide is based off of their color scheme, textures in their building, the menu and a little from the existing website. I did not make their website something completely different from the rest of their branding.  Another thing I might say to this is, the designs I would present would give the business owner an idea of how I would imagine their website and show off my creative ability within the scope of their existing design elements and requirements. This is something I would make apparent to said business owner, and inform them this are simple concepts than can be altered to their pleasing.  Thank you for the reply, I appreciate your time and advice. You have given me some very important things to consider."
freelance,33dyee,automaticyes,4,Wed Apr 22 03:53:56 2015 UTC,"Do you think I have the wrong mindset given my current position?   Absolutely 100% yes. I tried the same exact approach when I got started even though I had multiple experienced designers and developers telling me not to do it like this. You'd be better off spending your energy trying to secure clients in a different way.  If you don't have previous clients for referrals or much of a portfolio, I would recommend you approach digital media agencies (graphic design firms, ad agencies, branding agencies, etc.) and see if they're looking to bring on contractors. Successful agencies typically have more work than they know what to do with and if you hit it off with one, they'll just keep feeding you more and more work. The key to successful freelancing is figuring out how to keep the coffers filled. You're not going to get there by targeting mom-and-pops with shitty web-sites.    maybe the business owners don't realize their website could be driving potential customers away due to the lack of design and UX.   Maybe the business owners are happy with their current sales. Maybe they don't care. Maybe their favorite niece designed their site. Maybe they don't have the money to pay you. Maybe their previous designer got pissed off trying to work with them. Maybe, maybe, maybe. ""Maybe"" is almost never worth the effort.  The biggest thing that separates successful freelancers from those that struggle is their ability to sell. A successful salesperson knows that one of the biggest keys to closing sales is in getting through lead qualification with as little work as possible. What do you actually know about this sales lead? From what you've described so far, you are literally at the first step in lead qualification and you've already done work on speculation.   Do you know someone that works there? Well, you said that you frequent this business. Presumably, you know someone who works there. So the answer is: Yes. Do you actually know the appropriate person at the business to talk to about their web-site? Do you have their name, phone number, and email address? I don't know, so the answer is: Maybe. Do you know that they're even interested in what you're trying to sell? Have they expressed a need to you? No. Have they expressed their requirements for the web-site? Have they said what kinds of features they want or what kind of look and feel they're interested in? No. Have they provided you with a budget and a timeframe? No.   So going back to what you said about how ""maybe"" the business owners would see the value of improved UX: why commit to doing any amount of work before figuring out what their needs are? Try to get those questions answered first. If you get down to step 5 and they start stepping on the brakes because you don't have enough experience or you don't have a solid portfolio, then that's the perfect time to say, ""Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. Personally, I know I'm the right man for the job. Would it assuage your concerns if I just took an hour or so to put together a quick mock-up of what I think your web-site could be?"" That's the only time something like that is ok to do. But right now, you're so early in the process of getting a sale, that it's crazy to pour your time into spec work.   This is true, however, all of my inspiration and everything on my style guide is based off of their color scheme, textures in their building, the menu and a little from the existing website. I did not make their website something completely different from the rest of their branding.   That's not really the point. What if the previous designer didn't take the owners' input into consideration either and that's why it sucks? I'm not saying it's off-brand. I'm saying you made decisions based upon what you assumed was the desire of the owners.   Another thing I might say to this is, the designs I would present would give the business owner an idea of how I would imagine their website and show off my creative ability within the scope of their existing design elements and requirements. This is something I would make apparent to said business owner, and inform them this are simple concepts than can be altered to their pleasing.   Again: I've been there and I've done that. It was an atrocious waste of time. Qualify your leads. Collect information before making decisions. Doing spec work before you've qualified your lead is like betting before the cards have even been dealt."

A contract can be a single page, or even a single paragraph. In some jurisdictions it can also just be the content of an email - though you should still seek to have something (like a PDF) signed by the other party.  Communicate with the client on:   The Scope. What are you going to do for them? (be very specific). The Fee. What they will pay you in return? Your payment terms (I suggest 50% upfront, 50% on final delivery). Any provisions - e.g.    4.1 - If you're charging on a project basis and there's additional work beyond the agreed scope, is it charged at an hourly rate?  4.2 - Do you own the code? Or do they?  Keep it simple and remember that it should provide a guide for the flow of the job and your relationship with the client as much or more than being just a set of legal protections for you.

freelance,33br3w,owenr88,1 point,Tue Apr 21 07:46:26 2015 UTC,"In the US a contract serves to assist a judge and attorneys in figuring out what the intentions were between involved parties who signed the contract in the event a disagreement goes to court.   Contract Killer was not written by an attorney and it's recommendation (no offense /u/owenr88, you and many others have great intentions; this is important for the community to understand) needs to disappear from the freelancing world.  The Contract Killer author states ""I learned that asking my customers to sign a contract matters to both sides, but what also matters to me is that these contracts should be more meaningful, understandable and less complicated than any of those that I have ever autographed.""  Making a contract ""meaningful, understandable and less complicated"" should not even be on the to-do list when writing a contract. This is exactly why you need an attorney. Part of their job is interpreting the complicated language (NECESSARY to save your ass in court) and relaying it to you in a way that is ""meaningful, understandable and less complicated."" That way you know what you're reading and signing. The attorney does this interpreting. The contract absolutely should not.  The contract author discussing their prior experience with contracts states ""These documents had not been written to be understood on first reading but to spin me around enough times so as to give the other player the upper-hand."" If you honestly feel the document was written that way, then run. You shouldn't be talking to that person in the first place. This belief demonstrates trust issues with the other player. Contracts do not exist to alleviate trust issues or to enforce compliance from the other party (See Mike Monteiro in the sidebar for more...) If a trust issue exists, the other player should not become your client in the first place.   The author writes ""Somehow in the past I felt that insisting on a contract went against the friendly, trusting relationship that I like to build with my customers."" If you've spent enough time on this forum then you know this is the mark of an amateur salesperson. The other big culprit is discussing money. Professionals do not feel that money and contracts go against a trusting, friendly relationship... quite the opposite, they further cement the relationship by establishing mutual respect.   The contract uses ""fluffy"" language to try and diminish it's seriousness. It was written in a way that shows the contract writer must think that contracts scare off clients. Nothing could be further from the truth. Contracts are part of the daily walk in any professional business. Contracts (written by attorneys) scare off bad clients and show you are PROFESSIONAL to great clients. Few tools in your business other than your rate and contract can immediately draw a line in the sand between bad clients and great ones. Again, great clients running great businesses are accustomed to using professional, ""complicated"" contracts. This fear is only shared amongst those inexperienced in business.  In the original post by the ""Contract Killer"" author, he or she states ""If you’re writing a contract between you and your customers it doesn't have to conform to the seemingly standard format of jargon and complicated legalese. You can be creative."" No, you can't. This statement should serve as the lone red flag needed to never use this contract. Contracts are not full of ""seemingly standard format of jargon and complicated legalese"" because attorney's and judges enjoy being pedantic just for fun. The language is designed to be airtight, leaving zero room for interpretation. It is completely intentional and served a useful purpose. A contract is the one place where a standard format of jargon and legalese should absolutely be used. Again, watch Mike Monteiro in the sidebar.  The author of Contract Killer also states ""As I’m only an amateur detective, you should have it examined thoroughly by your own, trusted legal people if you use it.""  That statement should not be taken lightly, yet most people use Contract Killer because... it's free. To wit, the user doesn't want to pay for an attorney to begin with. Anybody paying for an attorney would have the attorney draft a contract, not review a contract written by a layman.  Furthermore, I've actually shared Contract Killer with more than one attorney in the US. They have all said that the contract would not hold up well in court, specifically because the language does not ""conform to the seemingly standard format of jargon and complicated legalese."" Therefore, it's full of holes and open to interpretation. An attorney simply needs to take a statement from the contract and then use the language that should have been used to demonstrate that the contract was not clear in it's intention.  I don't believe the author is nefarious, however the concerns that are addressed in the copy meant to ""sell"" readers on Contract Killer are all concerns shared by less experienced freelancers: worrying about scaring off the client, being uncomfortable with handling things like contracts, not being able to afford a contract, and worse not seeing the value in paying for an attorney to draft one. Every freelancer should recognize that it could only take one bad lawsuit to completely derail your business. It's worth paying for great insurance."

freelance,335ai8,TimeMuffinPhD,7,Sun Apr 19 18:08:31 2015 UTC,"This is just my opinion since you asked for help/critique, so take what I say with a grain of salt.  First thing I can think of is you need to get away from DeviantArt for showcasing your work. It's free, yes, but there are other ways just as free that showcase your work in a more professional manner. When it comes to new clients, showcasing your stuff in the best way possible helps turn someone just looking at your page and clicking away, into a project bite.  Another thing is you'll want to diversify your stuff, but only show off what you really feel will blow your intended audiences minds. It's better to have fewer things that really stand out, than to cram everything you have done that may not be to par with your other work.   And lastly, I give this advice to every 'help me find work' or 'how do you get more clients' thread, get out and do things in your local area. Meet up with hobby groups and diversify your network. You never know who you're going to meet who will bring in a good project and possibly more through referrals. Try not to pigeon hole yourself into only 1 website, or just internet clients, unless you're literally in the bumfuck nowhere and you have to rely on that.  Anyway, I wish you luck. Keep the price of your work what you need to sustain yourself.

freelance,334ti4,CerebralFX,2,Sun Apr 19 15:39:08 2015 UTC,"One of the things I have done when it's a non-profit whose budget is tight is to estimate at my normal rate, and then offer a discount. So if, for example, the rate you generally charge is €60/hr, but you think they'll only go for €30/hr, show €600 with a 50% discount to €300. And put in the notes that you are cutting your rates because of their non-profit status because you really want to work with them.  That helps maintain or establish your value, and avoids positioning yourself as the ""cheap provider"", while still giving them what they need in terms of their budget. I've had non-profits that are super thankful for the discount, gratitude I wouldn't necessarily have gotten for a straight invoice at a lower rate."

Then upscale a little so you have some negotiation room.  Otherwise, just go with your standard hourly rate * estimated hours. Then multiply by 1.25x-1.5x depending on complexity. Always give a range for padding room.   Consider lower if you think it's gonna be dead easy. However, myself, I nowadays charge the same hourly for all work I do since, in the end, time is time.

If as the call goes on you're iffy about the client leave some questions out and follow up after the call via email with what you need. This will be another chance for them to drop off if they're going to.  If they've lasted this far, there probably is a good chance they'll move forward and if you're losing more than 1/3rd - 2/3rds of your projects that make it this far (depending on how qualified your leads are) you should look into how others quote similar sized projects and try to figure out what's breaking down in your sales process.  Also, although I say 1/3rd to 2/3rds there can be quite a bit of deviation here (this is over the year, there are times of year when more budget is available, etc). These are ranges I see over 50 - 100 new client projects quoted per year.

A scope - I can share it with others but in the end they're going to rewrite their own based on their understanding on the project to make sure they've captured it correctly (at least with every quality freelancer / agency I've worked with).

I started getting people who were really adamant about wanting to know, as in, to the day, when things would be done on a project we'd literally spent < 1 hour talking about.  I indicated that a detailed proposal with that level of precision would be more likely if we scheduled a few days for the whole team to get together and review the project (3-5 people for 2 days up front, then writing detailed project plan) for $3k.  ""You want me to pay you $3k to tell me how much the project will cost?  You're nuts!""  ""Well, if you want to look at it that way, that's fine, but you're demanding answers for questions that are difficult at the best of times.  If you prefer to move forward with less precision, and we learn about the specific needs as we develop, we can do that.  The discovery of all the project needs will happen, and the $3k will be spent on discovery and planning.  We can choose to do it up front, or have it happen throughout the life of the project.  Your call"".  Never heard back.  I was in a position where I wasn't crazy about working on the project anyway, so it wasn't a big deal, but the thinking behind it solidified when I was doing that.

I started doing this way back when I was a general contractor before I reinvented myself as a developer.  Time is money.  I found that I was wasting a lot of time giving people estimates.  Driving to their home or business, looking up material quotes, getting quotes from subs, etc.    As it turns out, there a lot of people who don't mind wasting your time.  Particularly bored housewives.  There were multiple individuals to whom I gave multiple estimates for many different projects.  But they were never serious about moving forward in the first place; they were just bored and ""wondering"" how much it would cost.  Once I started charging $50 to show up and speak to them, things started becoming a lot more calmer and consistent.  This happens in the development industry as well.  I have found that by charging $75, I am able to weed out the people who aren't serious about moving forward. A lot of people have come to expect free estimates, but I value my time far too much.  I myself would never ask someone to work for free, so I don't oblige when people expect it of me.  Some people have become visibly offended and upset when I explained that I charge a consultation fee, but those are the type of people I don't wish to associate with in the first place."

freelance,332j51,Skink_in_trees_shade,15,Sat Apr 18 22:18:33 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're too concerned about the idea of programming. Programming is just a method to create. When it comes to freelancing, you have to get the job done. Which means taking advantage of the right tools for the right job.  No matter what kind of job/project you take on, there's always going to be something 'below your pay grade'. There's always some repetitive or menial task that has to get done.  I don't know if you're slow, but I know you can't waste time over engineering the solution. Build what's right for the client - not what will require the most of your skillset. Leave expanding and growing your skillset to the side projects, or limit it when working on client work. Ex. Don't build a CMS from scratch, instead try a new API and modularize a custom component of your project."

As of late I've been most involved with learning the intimacies of my language, but from my experience as a developer you need to be just as apt with all of the tools you use. The CMS's and API's are just as important as the language you use.   Find what tools you can most efficiently(fastest with high quality) produce with and keep redoing it until you're not only better/faster than the next guy but also can do it in your sleep. Because as it has already been stated your most complicated tasks will be strange features that companies WILL eventually ask for.   The first thing I learned from my team leader was that if you are unsure how long it will take and you guess it could take x days/hours then double it and tell them that. And I always either finished on time or early. Never late. If they can't deal with the time restraints them tell them then tell them that it was a pleasure speaking with them and thank them for their time."

What makes it challenging is that the design will call for something a lot more complex than that. Here's a few examples from my last few weeks at work:   Automatically show a map location from an address string Make payments in bitcoin Show a random number by spinning a slot machine Scrape a set of data from a google spreadsheet Automatically make a REST api by adding  meta information to ORM objects Make a simple online pixel editor   All those little extras are where the challenge is.

When you are working for a client you provide a service and your goal is to solve a particular problem. Usually if you work on custom applications you'll have custom problems to solve so you wont have a patter to go back to but you don't need one, all you need is to use the right tools and knowledge to solve some weird looking problem. All of the developers consult documentation, StackOverflow etc in their daily tasks, it's perfectly normal.   As far as ""building"" from scratch goes you can help yourself there too. For example I do most of my work in PHP, but it's really slow to build everything yourself if your task is to build some custom application. That's why there are frameworks, personally I use Laravel a lot. A framework wont solve all of your problems but it'll make you faster developing some common tasks. For example, in Laravel developing login/register/resetPassword takes a couple of minutes (completed with full authentication, session handling etc.) but if you would to develop this from scratch it would take you a lot more time. Some CMS systems also can help you being faster but it depends on what kind of projects you want to work on...

freelance,331sf1,dh42com,3,Sat Apr 18 19:03:35 2015 UTC,"So I learned a bunch of tips and tricks back when I was working with web devs, web designers and sales guys so here is hopefully something that can help you out to.  Do a web competitive analysis - basically look at the website, and take it apart. Completely. Find words being consistently used - those indicate importance and culture. Find a specific person to message, hopefully a decision maker that can approve of this. If not, you can still find something, a secretary, a company address etc. from which you can ask ""Hi, I have this project proposal, who can I talk to about this?"". Then compare to nearest competitors in the region and the market and see how they fare up.  Sell them on the fact that base website and the culture and the brand that they are selling (again, if you know their culture, and know them inside and out, like a lover, you will be able to reach through to them - clients love freelancers that understand them, their brand and their creed) is powerful, but can use a bit of a retouch to help reach even bigger markets.   If you can do a rough back of envelope estimate on the difference and value you can provide, that's pretty great.  All of this, btw, is a lot of work, but has to be condensed and teased in a few short paragraphs (no one likes reading an essay).  Now for the sales part.  Email is something you can start with, but the best way to reach someone and reach the decision maker is to pick up the phone and call. All of your efforts should focus on getting a phone meeting, and even better, a face to face meeting (invite them out to lunch and prepare to pitch).   So email. Send them a nice short email, emphasize that you understand their core business, culture and brand, and sell them your value (your value proposition). Wait for a response.  If you don't get a response within three days, send that EXACT EMAIL again. No change, don't forward or anything. Exact same email. You want it so that if the guy/gal who sees that email goes ""Didn't I see this email before?""  Now, if they still don't respond (this happens usually) in a week, then send THAT email again. No forward just like last time.  THIS time you have a new top on it.   ""Hi Mr. XXXX, I'm not sure I have an accurate email address for you (you're calling them out here, but doing so in a nice polite way). As I stated before I would love to have a chance to talk, I'm excited about your company because of X and would love to share my ideas.  (THIS IS THE KEY SENTENCE) I would be truly grateful if you have even a moment to respond""  That sentence right there has a response factor of around 5x. Everyone has even a small 'moment' to respond to your email, and you need to go for it. A moment is not quantifiable, and everyone can agree that they have even a small sliver of time to respond. If you say 5 minutes, or 15 etc. they immediately clamp up and think about the actual time lost. If you say a moment, I guarantee people think long and hard about that time.   And if they still don't reply back, give them a call ""Hey Mr. XXXX, I'm sorry that I couldn't catch you in your office. I'm not sure I have an accurate email address for you. I would love to share my thoughts and ideas. I am waiting for you to reply back to the emails I sent.   I would be truly grateful if you had even a moment to respond. Standing by, X""  FYI, all this is not even remotely aggressive in the slightest, but far outside of majority of folks comfort zone because most folks are too shy to do this, but THIS is how you get results and get the job done.  FYI, this also works for job proposals and finding a job. That's how I incorporate this method into freelance work back in the day.

It's easier to sell a good looking house than one that hasn't been touched since 2003.  Think of your website as your home on the internet.  Say something like ""If your company website hasn't been redesigned in the last several years, ask yourself why.  Ask yourself if you would ever let your home just continue looking exactly the same for years and years and years, never doing any updates or maintenance to it.""

Here are some reasons they will care about:   Sites that aren't optimized for mobile devices don't rank as highly in Google search results. Sites that feature a ton of semantically meaningless code (e.g. tables for layout) effectively prohibit certain users from navigating the site. Search engine ranking aside, the experience a user has when they actually reach the site is paramount.

freelance,332f5v,twelvis,3,Sat Apr 18 21:40:56 2015 UTC,"Let me elaborate on my thoughts, my other post was pretty short.   Do you have $50k to spend on this project? If you don't, I wouldn't touch it. From what I gathered you are using an outside contractor who is going to charge $50k for a $50k job. Leaving no room for any kind of error without costing you money. I don't think it would be a good use of capital, or time to be honest. If something goes wrong, and things do go wrong, you will end up on the hook. You don't need to take those risks if you cannot write the check to clear them up.   This is how we do things. If a client comes to us and wants a module that takes 100 hours to develop, I always look at it two ways. What is the commercial value of the module. Not the value to the client, that it totally irrelevant. If they want a module that I think has a high commercial value, I will actually lower our rate to just above cost to do the module. I have myself and two other developers that work for me, so the rate does vary. But I will lower the rate to secure the development being paid for by someone else. I also make it known that because we are lowering our rate, we are retaining the rights to the module, they are getting a license. The reason is simply I am taking a bet that we can make more off of the module through selling it than we can make on a one off job. If they decline and want the rights, we just charge them full price and go on with it.   But one key about what we do that makes it work is that one monkey does not stop the show. If my employees quit on me, I can still get the job done, we do things that I know how to do. We don't accept jobs that I personally would not be able to do or figure out. That does not mean I am the best at what I do, it just means that I choose to play cautious and not get in over my head.   Also, one thing that I feel like you might be setting up for if you don't have the money is being a bad contractor. What happens if a milestone is met and the client suddenly bails? Can you pay the contractor and move along like normal? I cannot stress this enough, I see it everyday and it bothers the hell out of me. Do not make someone else's pay depend on you getting paid. If one of my clients does not pay me, I don't go to my employees and say ""Sorry guys, we didn't get paid for this one"". I pay them and handle the client myself. It is not their problem, unless they messed something up so bad that the client refuses to pay. Then I fix it and have a discussion with the employee.   Also to sum up, I wouldn't ever charge based on value added. Its a poor metric to charge on and does not translate into much. Charge based on your hours or your flat fee. Value added charging is generally trying to rip someone off. Plus the value is never as high as you might think it is."

You don't need to take those risks if you cannot write the check to clear them up.    I could spend $50k if I absolutely had to. I will obviously pin down actual figures before starting. Would adding ~20% to the contractor's estimate when creating a budget be wise in this case? That way, I'd have 20% safety room + my funds.  Also, this is just the first serious contractor I've talked with; I'm obviously not going to jump on board until I hear other opinions. There may be much much cheaper options.   But I will lower the rate to secure the development being paid for by someone else.

Also to sum up, I wouldn't ever charge based on value added. Its a poor metric to charge on and does not translate into much. Charge based on your hours or your flat fee. Value added charging is generally trying to rip someone off. Plus the value is never as high as you might think it is.    I'm not sure how else to price it though. If I want to increase the client's output let's say 10% through this solution, I can quantify the value of that. Plugging in some numbers, if my costs are indeed going to be $50k, and I make $2k/mo in other revenue over the long term (I already have a 3-year history with this client) and I can resell the solution, what would you you charge? In the future, how do I price the solution that's mostly complete if I don't sell on value?"
freelance,332f5v,dh42com,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:31:33 2015 UTC,"I would add some wiggly room for sure. What you are doing is handicapping future income. If you make the solution for net 0 dollars, but are going to make money off of it in the future, the future money will be used as a payback on the previous development. Like for instance, if it takes you 100 hours of your time dealing with the client and contractor to develop this and you normally charge $50 an hour, you are $5k in the hole to start out with. Then you are figuring on a monthly revenue, I am guessing that is based on an hourly rate. The actual rate will have to have been cut to make up for the lose during development. The longer you make the residual, the more the hourly rate creeps up to what it was supposed to be. I guess think of it this way. Say you charge $50 an hour, there are 100 hours in development, and you are charging $2k a month for time. At the end of the year you will make $24k for the monthly, but you will have lost $5k worth of time. So your $50 an hour will be more like $40 an hour.   I have no clue on what you are doing, but let me tell you one thing we do quite often that might give some insight. We white label modules for companies for platforms. Like say a payment processor wants a module for PrestaShop. I generally look at things and evaluate my options like I mentioned before. But for some of our whitelabels, we put skin in the game. I will give them two prices generally, one price that is high at full rate, which for a payment module is around 10k starting. If it is a payment processor that I can push to clients, I will give them a lower price if they treat all users of the module as my affiliates. That way I might create the module for $5k, make $300 the first month, $600 the second, $2000 the third, ect. There generally is a time cap on the affiliate link in the module, but the active affiliates go on in perpetuity.   What a lot of our business is, is white label solutions. We are currently working out deals with 3 major companies on bringing their services to PrestaShop. One thing that we do to is double dip. Like say a client comes to us and wants a module for something service. We will develop it, keeps the rights, then try to resell it to the service. Usually we resell it to the service with a support and update term and that is when we negotiate the affiliate part as well. So in reality we are triple dipping. But it works."

So I would make money from developing the actual strategy. The strategy is based on a CMS, which is where a the bulk of the costs will be; I'm an expert in their niche, not in CMS or information architecture. Actually executing the strategy will entail billable stuff like writing, revision, content management, repurposing publishing, etc.  So I can develop the strategy but need to hire someone to actually create it and give me some credibility.

That said, sue him, go after him for damages he caused via libel, etc.. I've never had this happen with a client, but in any other area of business where this type of behaviour has come up I've always taken the approach of sue and cause the most damage to possible to the other party. Chances of getting paid are pretty low, you should instead focus on causing enough of a headache for the other party to have this act as a deterrent for them (and possibly others they know too). Assuming we're getting the full story, I can almost guarantee his behaviour isn't exclusive to you and him being given a court order to pay (even if you can never collect on it) will more than likely set him in line.  Of course, if the legal costs or lost revenue from the clients actions significantly affect your bottom line you have to look at it with finances more in mind.  Perhaps its an option to present proof to ripoffreport.com showing that the statements are false, and going after them if they continue to host the statements. You can probably get an answer about this from a lawyer during a free consult and an idea of costs.

Yes there are some aspects that you have to do that you'd prefer not to (having to call a client 12 times to get an invoice paid is not how I like to spend my time) but there are some small tweaks you can make to improve your financial situation.   When dealing with digital assets many of my friends ask for 50% upfront and 50% on delivery. They will wait for the money to be paid until they deliver the final assets. If the client requires previews you can always send through low res images for sign off.   To protect themselves, they will send through a project brief to the client before beginning which includes a single page contract listing these stipulations.   Build a buffer. How much money do you spend a week? A month? Do you have an awareness over your personal finances? If so, determine what kind of buffer you need in your bank account to help weather against late payments.    As a designer you should be able to take on multiple clients at once to mitigate the risk of non-payment/late payment by one or two of them.  If your current rates don't allow you to net a profit to create such a buffer, up your rates. The only people that undervalue freelancers more than clients is freelancers themselves. You're worth more than you realize.  NB: How you price your services is a whole separate process and depends on where you / your clients are located, the rates in the marketplace, the rates your clients think is reasonable, your expenses, etc. etc. etc.  Oh and to answer your question on why they take ages to pay their invoices?

I don't view it as a behavior of malice so much that they're doing their thing and they just forgot about it.  If you really think they're going to go no-pay, it doesn't hurt to message them. A simple request for payment is harmless enough and most people (in my experiences) will get right on it, since it's a tad embarrassing to be reminded of a bill.

Is there any way to estimate the value he gets out of the investment of hiring you to draw the boards?   Is there a measurable outcome of you drawing the signs vs. someone else drawing them?  Of course don't geek out too much on that for a job like this (as this is more high level consulting strategies).

If you aren't willing to put forth the same effort, think you will resent the person for the work they are having you do, or feel like you are being undervalued, then charge them for it instead.  Personally, I never do free work for anybody. I will invoice my family and my friends just like anybody else. Will I, occasionally, give them a discount (maybe a steep discount)? Yes. But I will put the original price and the discount on the invoice I give them.  Once you give one person some free work, you will quickly find hands reaching toward you wanting the same. After that it becomes hard to justify your prices to anyone, since you are willing to do it for nothing."
freelance,32smym,wraith313,2,Thu Apr 16 13:44:32 2015 UTC,I use to do free work for friends and family...but they will want 100+ revisions since it costs them nothing.

freelance,32sk7v,nyx2007,4,Thu Apr 16 11:10:54 2015 UTC,"Here's the cold, hard truth... it's your fault.  This is the case with all freelancers, myself included when these situations occur. It is 100% our decision whether to take on a client and allow an abusive situation to continue. We make poor decisions due to inexperience, lack of processes, and lack of direction.  Here's the most important piece of advice regarding these relationships:    When you accept clients crossing your boundaries, you are creating a brand and value statement that says ""I work with any client that comes along no matter how abusive because I'm an amateur that doesn't believe I truly have anything of value to offer. Please sign up!""  You might as well just write that as the call-to-action on your website and stick a sign-up button right under it.  And this isn't just some subconscious, nebulous, negative mojo occurring in it's own microcosm in your business that ultimately won't matter. It is your business.  It's up on a big ass billboard with neon arrows that every prospect can see within a 1,000 mile radius screaming ""I'M LOW VALUE! I'M CHEAP! I'M JUST LIKE THE REST!""  This is unacceptable. If you plan to have any success in freelancing, you stop this behavior now. You are doing one of two things as a freelancer who will be successful:  1) working for awesome clients you KNOW will become advocates for you OR 2) working to find those awesome clients.  Every minute you spend working for bad clients is further cementing your position as a commodity who's going to run on the hamster wheel for your next meal. You're telling all the other bad clients that this is who you are and that they can abuse you too. Your business will become a damp, dirty nasty kitchen... and the roaches will love it. Even worse, you're telling the good clients the same thing. They take one glance, completely dismiss you and sprint in the other direction.  Shut this job down in the next 10 minutes.   Then start working on a plan for how you're going to add true value to a client's business. We're here to help."

I find a lot of problems evolve from a freelancer not investing in:   Process Client education   Process is essential to create the framework for how you run your business. It covers everything - how you communicate to clients, your marketing, your invoicing and accounts receivable workflow (do you ask for a retainer? or an upfront deposit on a job? etc)  I've found that 90% of clients need to be educated to help their expectations align with reality. Generally speaking they almost always underestimate the price of your services and undervalue what you're doing for them.   If you had told the client ""This is how I work with my clients - take it or leave it"" and outlined your framework for completing the job then you'd be in a much stronger position.  Freelancers significantly underestimate the costs of working with little or no structure and working with lousy clients. It's costing you a lot more than money."

freelance,32jpoj,sonofaresiii,8,Tue Apr 14 12:33:08 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest red flags for me is the thrifty client, the one focused on paying as little as possible in every transaction. They try to squeeze you for everything. They always want something changed, always have something they just thought of, always try to expand the bounds of the project beyond what you originally agreed to, and never pay you on time or offer additional pay regardless of how much extra they ask for. These are the clients I've learned to say no to.   It's the clients that are more focused on the long term, big picture, and who want to make the best product possible that I love working with. These are the projects that are fun, challenging, and rewarding. These clients agree to pricing once, are eager to collaborate, and are open to new directions. If they want additional work, they know they have to pay for it and are happy to do so. These are the clients I don't hesitate to work with."

freelance,32jpoj,NotMikeLitoris,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:12:59 2015 UTC,"So I'm not a lawyer, but it sounds like the clause in their contract is just to cover anything that goes wrong on your end. Particularly with your added language, I would interpret that to mean that anything that goes wrong with your work within the first 3 months, you're on the hook for fixing within 48 hours.  I don't think the clause by itself is so terrible (if you're concerned about the ""without limit,"" I believe that just means you can't go ""But I already fixed two bugs, that's my limit, you guys are on your own)  That said, with all the other issues you listed I think you probably did the right thing bailing on this client."
freelance,32jpoj,manys,4,Tue Apr 14 18:51:23 2015 UTC,"The original indemnification clause (shown in OP) basically translates to ""if anything goes wrong with this project, you (the contractor) must foot the cost"".  So if someone sued because the site happened to be similar to theirs then I would have to foot all costs (defence, lawyers fees etc.)  It's something pretty standard (lawyers love slipping that in) but is absolutely not something you want to agree to. The fact that they we're reluctant to change this at all and other red flags is why I bailed.  Ultimately you're right, on it's own it might not be a thing but combined with everything else it fails the smell test."
freelance,32jpoj,sonofaresiii,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:55:46 2015 UTC,"You're considered the supplier though, right? It specifically says only issues relating to the supplier.  Even if they did try to swing it that you're responsible for everything, there's no way a judge would buy that.  Again, I'm not a lawyer, but I think you're overblowing the clause. I think it just means you're responsible for anything you fuck up.  So less ""If anything goes wrong, you must foot the cost"" and more ""If anything goes wrong because you fucked it up, you must foot the cost.""  Which, granted, is still a bit scary, but I don't think it's out of line. If you screw something up, you're responsible for it."

Do the logos really make that much of a difference?  Also, logos are not photos, they're images. If you worded it that way to the client, I can see why they'd think they didn't count."
freelance,32ld8a,OmegaVesko,10,Tue Apr 14 20:50:40 2015 UTC,"Really, how much more work is involved? I would do it, partly because I am flexible with my clients and partly because you have a client that can not pay you and has a better chance of winning in court."

I've had many repeat customers with this attitude! If it is a lot of work, just explain in a friendly tone that the agreement is for 8 images which includes logos, which 8 would they prefer? Or if all 13 are required, it would be an additional fee of XX."
freelance,32ld8a,jessejayjones,3,Tue Apr 14 19:01:44 2015 UTC,"Totally how I see it. When you are strict with people over small things, they usually end up being a one off job. When you are helpful and over deliver you usually have a client for life. Those are the people that end up saving your ass. Work runs out and you start to worry, then the next day one calls you about needing a redesign or something. We try to make life long business connections, not just as much money as we can, they actually go hand in hand."

freelance,32ld8a,ryangillam,3,Tue Apr 14 21:26:23 2015 UTC,"I give away little ""extras"" all the time.  Just today a client called and wanted a re-design of the site's header to accommodate a new section (menu item) they wanted to add, and it wouldn't naturally fit.  This is a client where the work is done, and all paid for... 100% complete.  They asked.  They asked nicely.  Even wanting to know how much the fee would be (dream client, right?).  The wordpress theme we're using supports different header layouts, and one was easy enough to swap in to suit their needs.  All in, it took me about an hour (including the conversations, and email follow up, etc).  I didn't charge, even though they'd be perfectly willing and wanting to pay.  I just feel that these little extras help leave a positive memory in clients minds and help with referrals and more business in the long run.     You'll notice I mentioned how they asked nicely, and didn't expect free work.  I've also had the exact opposite client, that did expect free work and sent annoying requests all the time, expecting them to be done quickly.  I would not offer the free extras for that client.    I might be petty, but I'll work to keep good clients, and not the bad ones.   So, this is my long-winded way of saying you might want to choose how you respond to the extra work of doing the logo, and it might be a different response if it's a different client."

freelance,32j24a,im_gorideyourbike,3,Tue Apr 14 04:39:45 2015 UTC,"Congrats!  I'd recommend working the cost of travel (and the booking of that travel) into your contract. Your client books the tickets on their own card and just sends you a ticket. (If you use a credit card that gets extra miles or whatever, though, it can be a great way to get free rewards to book your own tickets and get reimbursed.)  Other expenses, though, unless they're explicitly worked out with the client, are yours. You can write off equipment and travel and food, but it's all at different rates — talk to an accountant about this.  The short version is that all the money you spend operating your business is tax deductible, but there are lots of subtleties that come into play on exactly how that deduction works for each type of expense."
freelance,32j24a,jlengstorf,2,Tue Apr 14 06:49:42 2015 UTC,"I'm Canadian, so tax laws might differ, but here's what I do (and I'm also incorporated).   1 - I've had a client pay for the expenses (flight/hotel). In this case, I never see the expense, nor do I need to claim or worry about it.  I also don't need to pay upfront, so it's easy on my pocketbook.  2 - If my contract with the client covered expenses (as a billable item), then I'd need to normally get them to approve the expense before hand (to ensure it's within their budget), and then I pay for the flight/hotel, and would then submit the receipts with my next invoice, and they'd pay for it. (Make sure you have an daily allowance for for food)  3 - You could also just surcharge your rate (either your fixed price rate, or your hourly or per diem rate) knowing you're going to incur travel expenses.  In this case, you don't ever bother them with paying back expenses, nor do you have to get approval for anything.    In both example 2 & 3 you would claim your expenses in your accounting.  What I do is keep a google spreadsheet log of each and every receipt (I take a photo of the receipt, so I can keep a 'scanned' copy in my google drive, for record keeping).  In Canada, your expenses offset your revenue for the taxable amount.  So, if you charge $1000 to your client, and have $100 in expenses, your taxable amount is $900 (that's overly simplistic).  Careful with thinking about expenses as ""writing them off"". You're really not.  You're still paying for them, and they cut into your revenue.  It's still money you're paying out. Expenses just help in reducing the amount of tax you pay (at least in Canada).  In Canada, corporations also do not pay our federal sales tax (the HST), so any expense that the company pays for will get 15% back (another reason why I love for the business to incur expenses).   So, with both 2 & 3 you are personally paying for the expenses ahead of time out of your own pocket, the only difference in those two is how you get paid pack, but the initial expense is unavoidable.  Personally, I love option 3.  But I've also done 1 & 2.  Bottom line, when you're incorporated, these expenses matter, and should be logged and receipts kept (and yes, a photo on your phone saved to dropbox or google drive is good enough)."
freelance,32j24a,springer70,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:42:38 2015 UTC,"1) I usually bill for transportation costs. In fact, I bill separately for any and all costs (unless we decide I don't, as part of negotiation). The idea is that my rate is my rate-- it might be higher or lower depending on the project, but it's for my work. They still pay for travel, but it's not as part of my rate.  Also, you won't pay for taxes if you bill them separately for travel. If you just include it in your rate, it counts as part of your income (though you can keep your receipts if you pay for it yourself and deduct them later, but that's more work)  That said, some people do just bill higher rates and not do separate items for expenses. So it's really up to you.  2) Oh. I guess I just answered that."

freelance,32idjt,James_GAF,3,Tue Apr 14 13:24:27 2015 UTC,"I learn everything from doing a 1040 and following all the form instructions. I've built a spreadsheet from that to calculate my taxes as money comes in. You can learn other ways, but downloading all the forms and instructions from irs.gov is what I've always done.  If your parents claimed you for 2014, you need to get them all your info and they'll need to file an amended return paying the taxes on your earned income(self employment and income tax, plus likely a penalty).  For this year, you should be paying estimated taxes by tomorrow and each quarter by the dates the IRS provides(not exactly every 3 months). If you're getting withholding on your internship, that will cover some of your taxes but not all. You'll need to crunch the numbers or pay someone to do it for you. Otherwise, you can forgo the estimated payments and pay a penalty end of year. Either way you need to do the math and have the cash to pay.   This is just for federal stuff and before you get into any state taxes, which you'll need to look up for the state you're in now. You're on pace for about $55k, which federal taxes should be somewhere around 20-25% depending on how much of the income is with no withholding. On $8k thus far this year you're looking at around $1,600 you need to pay now."

freelance,32idjt,Emmylu91,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:19:14 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but you don't have that money to spend already. The taxes at the very least need to be set aside regardless, otherwise you may end up with a near $7k or larger tax bill to pay end of year and no way to pay it. From there it's a downward spiral of penalties, fees and collections. The penalty on that kind of money isn't exactly chump change either, a few hundred dollars likely. Fail to handle this properly and you're sinking yourself into long term debt."

Maybe it varies by state but I've filed self employment taxes based on being a freelancer for 3 years now with my income ranging from 2k to 15k and have always had to pay something in, even the one year when my profit was basically reduced to 0 because of write offs."

I believe the $200 was because self employment taxes are based off of net income instead of taxable income."

If there isn't anything else you're leaving out, you'll owe $423.89.   The IRS receives a copy of the 1099 that you received, so the last thing you want to do is to do nothing. File a Form 4868 extension to file today, and mail it with a check for as much of the $423.89 that you can.

freelance,32g5cg,Cyndikate,16,Mon Apr 13 15:05:11 2015 UTC,"Worry about being fair, yes. In a sense I have had clients that have sales in the 10's of thousands a day and come to me with an issue like their paypal checkout is not working. When it takes an hour or two to fix I charge them my hourly rate. I don't rip them off because they are in an emergency.   Worry about other peoples rates, no not really. I usually tell people to go to them then. We charge what we charge because of our ability and experience. You can always get things cheaper from somewhere else, but that does not mean it has value or the value is comparable to the more expensive product."
freelance,32g5cg,dh42com,7,Mon Apr 13 15:26:34 2015 UTC,"If a client says they can get a cheaper website elsewhere, it doesn't mean your rates aren't ""fair."" It means that prospect isn't really in your target market. Let them work with the cheaper designer and figure out why you're attracting the wrong kinds of prospects.   As for competitors, they shouldn't determine your rates. But it's a good idea to know where you stand among them. That's because your position in the market (affordable vs a premium option for example) factors into your USP. But be careful. Make sure the other designers you're looking at are really your competitors. Not all other web designers are. You should only care about ones target the exact same target market as you, or a very similar one (company size, budget, industry, etc.), and competitors with similar credentials."
freelance,32g5cg,jennifermattern,9,Mon Apr 13 15:41:02 2015 UTC,"Charge based on the value you create.  For instance, our ecom websites are top notch.  Each customer we've worked with has gotten to $1m in revenue pretty quickly and has a super pro site that supports that level of business.  So charging $250/hr to build that site seems pretty reasonable."
freelance,32g5cg,WahWahWeWah,6,Mon Apr 13 15:49:09 2015 UTC,"Okay, a couple things.  First, I guess it's up to you personally how you feel about it. But my general advice is:  Forget your costs of living. They're irrelevant. Charge what you're worth, always. If that's your cost of living, cool. If it's above your cost of living, awesome! If it's below your cost of living, you got a problem.  Yes, always be fair to your clients. Don't charge more than you're worth just because you can get away with it. This is unethical, it's bad for business and it's going to hurt your reputation if you don't deliver quality consistent with your rate.  Finally... if you're charging what you're worth, your competitor's prices won't matter. Or rather, charging what you're worth has already taken your competitor's prices into account. But if someone out there is charging less than you, it should be for lower quality work. Professionally, you need to let these people charge less, and if clients want lower quality work, let them go higher those people.  And personally, maintain your self-respect man. If you're worth a certain amount, charge that amount. Don't downgrade yourself just to keep up with lower-quality competitors.  Anytime I hear someone say ""Well you know so-and-so is offering to do it for cheaper,"" my thinking is ""Well, go get it for cheaper then. But if/when you decide you want it done well, give me a call. And you'll probably be paying me a premium for a rush job.""  (in practice, I just stay silent because that's not really a good line to handle a client. They usually know exactly what paying someone less means-- lower quality. And me telling them that isn't going to change their mind)"
freelance,32g5cg,sonofaresiii,8,Mon Apr 13 19:28:27 2015 UTC,"Customers who go by price alone aren't a good demographic.

Okay, how big do you think your web business will be?  If you understand the customers rational for making the investment you can then estimate a fair price to help them.

Now, I'm not saying hold firm on prices forever, blindly, and stubbornly.  I mean, I was doing e-comm websites in 1999, and charging at minimum $25,000.   People are getting better solutions from Shopify for a tiny fraction of that today.  Sadly, to keep charging top dollar, we all need to stay competitive and ahead of the curve.  But, resist the urge to discount simply 'because'.  It's a balancing act, I agree.   My biggest fear is the 'race to the bottom'.  If all we ever do is charge less and charge less, and compete on price, it's a no-win game.  My advice, is to hold firm on your prices, but constantly ensure you're delivering value.  And more value than you did last year."
freelance,32g5cg,Panedrop,2,Mon Apr 13 18:36:43 2015 UTC,"Your rate is your rate.  It doesn't matter what your competitors charge.  You will always have competition.  There will always be people cheaper or more expensive. It is the most common negotiation tactic in the world for someone to tell you ""I can get it done at Steve's WebDesign company for $50"".  They might be lying.  Or Steve could give a worse product.  Or Steve might be all booked up.  Or Steve might take forever to produce.  Etc..  Just saying ""Steve is $50"" doesn't produce a full picture.  If someone tells you that, you tell them ""okay, go with Steve"", or ""why are you talking to me right now and not Steve?"" If someone is strongly price sensitive, you won't win them over, no matter what.  And it doesn't matter.  That is why sites like Elance exist.  If someone has $100 to build the next Facebook, you don't want on that train no matter where its going. Having said all of that, do be mindful of the market.  If you're having a problem finding work, it could be your rate.  Or it could be your rate as compared to your skill/quality and where that sits in the market.  Adjusting your rate downwards should be your last resort."
freelance,32g5cg,jameswesleyhunt,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:25:32 2015 UTC,A $50 website going to be any good and even a brochure-ware site done at $500 is probably underselling yourself. With my skills I can charge 25-30USD/hr meaning that even a fairly basic site runs $2000-3000. Anyone wanting to pay you less than what you're charging probably isn't someone you want to work with/for.
freelance,32h4cw,Comedian02,5,Mon Apr 13 19:27:45 2015 UTC,"This is not something you need to worry about. Instead, focus your energy on how you will reach new clients.   Many people only work with remote clients. You can use email, phone calls, skype, google hangouts, join.me, etc.  There's no requirement that you have to be face-to-face. Some clients will require it, but you just won't work with those clients."

freelance,32iizs,trafc,3,Tue Apr 14 01:48:54 2015 UTC,"Momentum is critical to project success.  I don't have a magic formula for keeping things rolling, but I do have a few tricks that I've picked up from my experience that help greatly.  TL;DR: Get the client on the phone whenever there's a review needed, communicate often (daily), keep the client engaged with small and easily-achievable tasks, break projects into daily deliverables to show more progress, and constantly remind the client how much has been done and how little is left to do.    1) Use calls to keep the client engaged and kickstart their tasks.  When you have a milestone, you're giving the client a chore: review this and give feedback. People tend to procrastinate when they have things to do. You can beat the procrastination issue by holding their hand through the initial presentation.  Set up a call, and do not show them anything before the call. This creates a bit of anticipation (think product launches a la Apple) and avoids someone getting the wrong impression of what they're supposed to review before the call.  Once you're on the call, walk them through what you did and your reasoning for doing it that way. This was far and away the most beneficial thing I did for shortening project timelines. The client hears your reasoning and is far less likely to nitpick — they'll be more on the lookout for big picture issues rather than little things.  2) Keep in touch way more often than you feel is necessary.  Because we're working on these projects, we don't think about what it feels like for the client. Our instinct is to only reach out when we have something done, but if that takes 48+ hours, the client can feel like we've disappeared. This can result in the client wondering where the project is and/or the client losing focus and starting other projects. (If you've ever worked with a contractor or hired a third-party company, think about the anxiety you felt when it took two days to hear back from them after they took your money.)  I think a daily check-in is ideal on many projects. If it's a short-term project, this is especially important.  3) Keep the client engaged with small, easily-achievable tasks.  One way to make constant contact with the client less awkward than a ""hi I'm still alive"" email is to break up the things you need the client to give you into smaller phases. Our clients start by sending us just inspiration (sites they like, anything they can think of that looks cool to them, their preference in cars/clothing/spirit animals). Later, once we have that, we ask them to assemble critical content for another phase of the project, such as their primary objective for the home page (e.g. sign up for a free trial, get on the newsletter list, etc.).  Each of these is a one-day task, so we can keep the client engaged with small, achievable goals that gives a measurable indication of progress day-to-day. When they think about what's been done, they'll have a list of all the things they've done just this week — that's excellent for keeping the momentum up.  4) Break the project into small tasks that can be delivered often.  If it looks like you're mowing through the project, it's good for everyone. The client will love to see the todo list growing shorter, and you'll have the sense of momentum that helps you stay focused.  If your todos are too big, it can create a sense that nothing's happening, even when you're actually working hard. The gap between now and ""final review for the launch-ready website"" might be weeks — that's way too long for a client to wait for some kind of measurable progress.  Instead, use your scope doc to create small deliverables that you can hopefully tackle in a day or less. That way you can give the client something new every day, which keeps your project top-of-mind. (I've written about how to plan if you want some ideas for breaking your tasks up.)  5) Always include a recap of what's been done and what's left to do in communications.  Showing that the ""things we've done"" list is growing and the ""things to do"" list is shrinking has a great motivational impact.  I always send my clients bulleted lists so they're easy to parse.  Before you give up on freelance, give this a try. I think you'll be surprised, and I'd love to hear how it goes for you."
freelance,32iizs,jlengstorf,2,Tue Apr 14 06:29:28 2015 UTC,"WOW! thank you for taking the time to reply in such detail.   You are right. All the points you give are things I didn't place much attention on. Especially planning. Your blog post is very insightful, and I will be rereading it again.   Thanks!"
freelance,32iizs,thisdesignup,2,Sat Apr 18 01:32:36 2015 UTC,"As great as the advice /u/jlengstorf gave I think you have a bigger issue to worry about than momentum.   • They ask ""can we add this"", ""can we add that""... many parts of the scope were grey when we signed the contract, so if it isn't too hard, I add it into the to-do list. I didn't account for the amount of time for research/planning it takes to determine whether those things are simple or difficult, which can add up to many hours of Googling or writing out my thoughts.  • I bend over backwards to accommodate her boss' requests, and spend time doing summarized updates and video updates (wasn't planned for) so everyone knows what's going on.  • Repeat the above several times, the project is now 4 times as long as I had initially planned for, and it is a fixed-fee project.   You seem to already know this, to an extent, but I think you should really focus on learning how to set boundaries. Even with grey areas you should be setting boundaries on what could be done.   The best way to keep a project running on time is to be the one in control. After all clients come to you not for you to be an employee but a freelancer, your own boss, who is in charge of the project that they have given you. That means you should be more in charge and worry less about fulfilling every want that the client has, especially if it goes beyond what is reasonably within the scope of the original project.   Even grey areas still have an approximate scope, even so grey areas can be risky. Projects should be outlined as detailed as possible, without limiting what can be done, and then allowing for a certain amount of changes that still keep the project in scope. If those changes force the project to go out of scope then you should either be paid more or tell the client that what they want is not within budget.   I'd say finish these projects to the best of your ability. Keep moving forward. Everybody has to learn and gain experience so I wouldn't say your not cut out for being a freelancer. Just keep at it and try to be the boss a bit more.   Making clients happy is good but at the same time your job is to make sure the project gets done as well as possible.  A client asking for too many changes that enlarge the project scope and keep the project end from being reached in a reasonable time is not necessarily good.   Also, keep in mind, if you bend over backwards once or twice for a client the client may start to expect it from you unless you tell them otherwise. It's up to you to let the client know how these things work."

This works for me with software development but may not be appropriate for all forms of freelancing.  The key points are to minimize the amount of unpaid work you do, and to not allow a client rights to use a piece of work that hasn't been paid for.  Most of my work comes by reference from friend/associates (few flakers but nothing major) and reddit listings. On reddit, you can view a person's comment history and that's generally going to be the best kind of background check you can have.

I believe if you make any money, you have to report it, and it's taken out of what you're paid (Probably oversimplified, but something to consider).  If I were in your position, I'd try to learn as much as you can about freelancing, and gain skills while looking for a new job. Once you have that job, try freelancing on the side and see how you like it. Maybe you make the switch once you're ready experience and financially if you want to. If not, you're making some extra income and learning new stuff.  Obviously just one option, but I've been in a similar situation, and have done some of this."
freelance,328qpu,whentweetlebeetles,1 point,Sat Apr 11 17:42:13 2015 UTC,"The benefits of freelancing are almost never ""more money.""  So if you're looking at it as a way to give you income, you're in for a bad time. From a purely financial standpoint, especially in the short term, you're much better off putting that time and energy into finding another full time job.  Freelancing at a point where you can live off your work usually takes a long time-- building a portfolio, experience in the field, habits and conditions for freelancing, and most importantly connections. That's why people recommend you start when you already have a job.  Now, if you legitimately are putting in as much effort into finding a job as you can, and still have some time left over, it might be worthwhile to go ahead and try to pick up some extra work.  And if your wife makes almost but not quite enough for you guys to live on, and you really want to start freelancing, you might be able to make enough to swing it (I don't know much about your field).  But chances are, if you're not a freelancer at heart and openly making the decision to go that route yourself, you're going to be much better off trying to get a steady job lined up.  Best of luck."

It does mean that I need to keep up with my own bookkeeping and pay my quarterly taxes to fed, state, and local, but that has not been so bad. I also have to keep up with mailing my sales tax each quarter, but most quarters I report a big fat zero since most of my business is to non-profits, agencies that pass on my invoice to a final client, and out of state clients (but you still have to file even if it's 0, which is something some people forget and could make the state unhappy with you).   I think the only reason to have someone's help all year round would be to have them do your bookkeeping and I can't imagine what that would cost. Right now I pay my guy a bit over $500 to do my Schedule C, my joint return with my wife (she's a salaried worker), and to be available to answer questions through out the year.

Best way to recover from this is to finish the contract and just charge more for the next one.

You need to call your client and have an honest discussion with him. Explain that you made a mistake, and tell him what is going on. Try to come up with a solution that would work for the both of you.  Don't forget that estimates are just that: estimates.

Personally, I think the keyword is 'estimate' not 'bid' so you can run over budget, but since you were so far off you do have some explaining to do and customer relations are critical.  I'd admit to them the estimate was wrong, it happens, but then I admit it's a tough call. What's more valuable, money or your reputation?

To me, what to do depends on a few things:    if you're going to have future work with this client, it might be best to suck it up and do the work without increasing the budget.  if you're not going to get future work from this client, it might be best to ask for more. if you're paying other people to help you do the project, and you might actually incur an actual financial loss, you should consider going back to the project sponsor and discussing the increase in costs.  if you're not paying other people, and it's just you doing the work, this means you're original hourly rate of $xx is now probably half that amount.  Well, this is the tough one.  I mean your effective hourly rate is much less than planned, but you're still getting paid, and unless you need to disclose hours to the client, they will never know the hourly rate, and future work from them won't be affected.    You're right... this is a tough one.  Especially if you want to build a long term relationship with the client.   That being said, I also agree with thibaultj"

If you've signed an agreement, I'd say you have to suck it up - well I would if it was me.  It's not the clients fault for your incorrect estimate, so they shouldn't have to pay particularly if everyone has signed off on the project."
freelance,32330b,ticman,3,Fri Apr 10 07:52:44 2015 UTC,"Do you have a contract yet?  If not, submit the corrected estimate and apologize for causing the trouble.  Just be honest.  If they walk away, the walk away.  Offering a small discount is not unreasonable.  If they walk away, they walk away.  Better than you eating the cost.  Chances are, if they go to someone else, they will see that the corrected estimate plus whatever discount you might offer is better than what someone else would offer and come back to you.  Good luck."
freelance,32330b,yodelspoogenshortz,2,Fri Apr 10 11:11:20 2015 UTC,"We'll, you're going to have to talk to the client anyway because it's going to take longer than you originally told them.  Usually when I give an estimate I always give a caveat that it is subject to change as the project moves on, forward whatever.   Usually I give an initial basic estimate, and if I'm given the project I spend time on planning to get a much more detailed time breakdown, which may be longer or shorter than the original estimate.  I would say at the least talk to the client and explain that in light of more information that is available your estimate has changed and what would they like to do?  At that point you can present them options, one of which should be to not continue with you, whether you want to offer them a discount if they do is up to you."
freelance,32330b,dublinclontarf,3,Sun Apr 12 15:48:28 2015 UTC,"I'm amazed at the responses here saying you should just eat it. You definitely need to at least try #1. If they call you out on it, you may end up having to honor the original estimate .... but then that's also not a client worth keeping."
freelance,32330b,zeptoon,6,Fri Apr 10 08:06:42 2015 UTC,"I came here being able to see both sides of the argument. I didn't lean strongly one way or another, but i think it's patently absurd to suggest he drop a client who expects the agreed upon work to be done for the agreed upon price. That expectation is called good business.  Do you know why nobody trusts mechanics? Because most people don't really know how a car works, and think they're getting ripped off when the price changes. What would you think of a mechanic who drops people who don't pay whatever additional fees they tack on once they've already started tearing your car apart?"
freelance,32330b,ThePedanticCynic,2,Fri Apr 10 08:21:04 2015 UTC,"In my book if someone understands you made an error and would therefore need to work for free -- and they're fine with you doing essentially unpaid work, that makes someone a client not worth keeping. You're obviously welcome to run your own business however you'd like. But you might want to read up on for example some of Tim Ferriss' thoughts on the 80/20 principle as it relates to clients.   I'm not going to get into the car mechanic argument."
freelance,32330b,zeptoon,0,Fri Apr 10 08:50:38 2015 UTC,"Yes. I bet suckers do make the best clients.  If you charge me 20 bucks to rotate my tires, you can't decide you want 40 once you've taken the tires off. That's a shitty business. I would demand you put my tires back on, not pay you a dime, then find someone else; all the while telling everyone what a terrible ripoff you are.  A good business is one that doesn't dramatically change their prices once they've already started the project if it wasn't the client's mistake that put you in a bad position. If your internet is about to be shut off due to lack of payment and you can't keep working, that's not the client's responsibility either."
freelance,32330b,ThePedanticCynic,2,Fri Apr 10 14:07:06 2015 UTC,fixing a car is a relatively known quantity compared to developing software. there's no comparison whatsoever.
freelance,32330b,darksurfer,0,Fri Apr 10 09:15:33 2015 UTC,"The analogy is obviously from the customer's point of view. All they see is the doubling of the price, completely destroying any confidence they have in your abilities anyway, and whatever trust they might have had. If they understood the intricacies involved they wouldn't be hiring you to do the work.  I get the impression we're not talking about going from 1 hour to 2, but more like 40 to 80."
freelance,32330b,ThePedanticCynic,3,Fri Apr 10 09:21:54 2015 UTC,"I partly agree with you but if you're doing freelance software development you should be managing the clients expectations about what an estimate means right from the very start.   they generally won't like assuming the risks because they're generally very naive about every aspect of software development, but the alternative is to assume the risks yourself (generally without being compensated for it). That's a recipe for lots of unpaid work."

I'm their copywriter :)  My first real business trip ever! So happy it was successful."
freelance,320tx8,GreeMou3,13,Thu Apr 9 17:50:52 2015 UTC,"Actually I try to be up front about my pricing because I don't want my clients to have unrealistic expectations about how expensive good design is, and I want to weed out the people looking for free/low cost work that I'm not interested in completing. Often these kinds of people will ask me very early on ""So, what's your rate like anyway?"" And here's what I say... ""Well, I typically work at $60/hr, but when I work out the scope of the project/but for my friend/but for a first time client I offer a discount for.."" and then I insert a rate that is lower but high enough to be negotiated down a little bit without killing my profit.   This way I am already seeming to be more flexible/likable.   Another technique is called price anchoring. In your hiring process you have to figure out the client's budget, what they are currently making (and losing) and how your services can boost their business. Then when you make your proposal, you indicate that you estimate by hiring you, you can gain them X more clients/more business/more traffic in X time (1 month, 6 months, 1 year) and you anchor your cost against the gain of clients/business/traffic. My last client said her goal was to add 1 additional permanent client to her business, and her clients generate $320/month, and she would like to have 12 regular clients total. If I estimate that 20 hours of design work will get her 1 new client every month, I (and she) can justify the cost of hiring me, because she will have made back her money in a couple of months or so.   The price anchoring technique you have to do at the end of the discussion, because you have to actually get them to talk about their own money situation first. It is a challenge but not impossible."
freelance,320tx8,JenWarr,2,Thu Apr 9 18:17:02 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought about offering ""first-time client"" discounted rates. That's an interesting idea. Are people really OK w/ paying higher rates as return customers though?  Typically I see this work the opposite way - discounts for frequent customers."
freelance,320tx8,casimps1,4,Thu Apr 9 18:52:38 2015 UTC,"In my experience-- and this certainly doesn't hold true for everyone-- it's a terrible idea. It sets a terrible precedent. No one ever wants to pay more for the same work, even if you tell them that's what's going to happen. It's always ""Oh the budget's a little lighter for this one"" or ""Oh the work on this next one won't be quite as much work"" and they try to get you to come down, not go up.  But for some people, I can definitely see how getting your foot in the door to prove you know what you're doing and will produce quality work will be a good idea, then once you're a known entity you charge higher rates."
freelance,320tx8,sonofaresiii,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:58:44 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I haven't been working in freelance all that long, so I can't tell you which is better. If someone is on the fence and the scope seems small/one time gig, it would be an offer to get them off the fence. On the other hand, you are right, offering a discount (even of 5%) for long term/loyal clients would also build trust and make them feel appreciated.   Edit: I can say for sure that because you have already proven your value to your clients they understand why your regular price is higher. Unless they are penny-pinching uncompromising people, my work can speak for itself and has real value."
freelance,320tx8,JenWarr,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:29:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with sonafaresiii that this is not a so good idea to offer discount for first time customer. Ask for what you think you are worth, and stick to it. It can be harder when the rent is coming and we still haven't found a new gig,  but I believe it pays in the end. Some clients will understand your values, and the longer you are in the business, the easier it will becomes."

My real rate isn't even $60, its even lower, but this is only my first year of freelance. Every project I bump up my rate with new clients... Which is valid. I have accrued more experience and I am more efficient at designing than I was a year or 3 ago.   Also, you have to charge based on your needs. If you're covering an office space, utilities, home mortgage... You have to cover your costs, and provide yourself with some kind of pay. Its convoluted... Gives me a headache trying to figure it all out."
freelance,320tx8,JenWarr,5,Thu Apr 9 21:12:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like to mention rates up-front rather than wasting lots of time. But I think that might be because I have lots of clients that expect my services for a fraction of what I charge.  So, I think it might depend on your typical client. If you have lots of clients where you spend time in discussion and then they bolt when you finally talk numbers, then I think it's worth it to talk rates up-front. Every hour you spend with them is an hour you could've spent doing actual paying work or finding a paying client."

My rates are high, so my clients need to understand that they're not getting the same solution from me that they'd get from a lower-priced competitor.  Imagine you're hungry, and you call different restaurants to ask about pricing for a meal. Both respond with just prices: $5 and $20.   With only pricing information, it seems silly to spend 4x for the second restaurant.   But what if, instead, you talked to the restaurants about how they'd solve your problem?  The first says, ""Well, we take frozen meat from a truck, fry the Christ out of it in low-quality oil, slap it on some stale bread, and throw it in a bag with deep fried frozen potato substitute before tossing it at you across the counter with some sugar water.""  The second says, ""We take fresh beef from a farm outside of town, cook it to temperature over a charcoal grill, add vegetables that are grown here in town, and serve it to you with a nice microbrew that's chosen specifically to complement the flavors of your meal.""  Once you know what you're getting for the money, suddenly paying 4x extra doesn't sound so bad.   If we focus on price, we're competing on price. If we focus on value, price is no longer the primary factor driving decisions."

That way, the client feels you are not going to rip him/her off -since they didn't tell you their exact number- but you already set give a ballpark on how much working with you costs."
freelance,320tx8,solgarcia,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:28:15 2015 UTC,"It depends. In some situations it's best to do it upfront so no one's wasting anyone's time. In some situations it's best to wait until the end so you have all the information. In some situations it's best to wait until they tell you their budget, then you can tell them what services you can offer.  It all depends on the project and how you work. I don't have standard rates, so I'm going to need to know all about the project first before I can tell you how much I feel like charging.

If you charge project based then it goes without saying that you need to head a lot of details about the project before talking about the price (even if you just calculate the hours * yourRate in your head)...  In cases when I've charged hourly I would negotiate the rates after the client briefly introduces the project, usually you don't have to wait long and really good clients will be upfront and ask about your rates anyway. If you noticed that the clients wants you to read a lot of documentation, sign various NDAs etc... ie. taking a lot of your time in general you should really stop that immediately and negotiate.

freelance,320tx8,jameswesleyhunt,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:38:33 2015 UTC,"When and how to mention your rate is still something I struggle with. But I would say the latter the better. The advantage of waiting for the end of a discussion is that you have time to explain what you do, and what kind of professional you are.   A potential client could skip your name pretty quick if you throw him an amount higher than his budget in the first email.  But talking to him over the phone,  and explaining him how you work, and what kind of services he can expect to get from you, that can give him enough reasons to at least consider your offer.   But again, that's a though issue, and some clients will want to know as soon as possible. In my opinion, the valuable clients will listen to what you have to offer even if your rate are higher than what he is expecting to pay."

(Check with an accountant — I'm repeating half-remembered things my accountant told me.)  I'd also recommend setting up an LLC or S-corp if you plan to keep freelancing.

If you earn above certain amount (I think $600 but not sure) you MUST report it on taxes as self-employed. Also check with your city as some cities (like LA) require you to obtain a business license and pay business tax (on top of Federal and State taxes).   If you are planning on going this route, I highly recommend you get a good accountant to do your taxes the first year at least. It's pricey, BUT  1) you wont mess up or miss some obscure law/tax  2) If you do mess up (or your client does, which happened to me) your accountant will handle it for you  3) good accountant will give you lots of feedback on how to save money  4) it will give you a solid template you can then re-use to do your own taxes in the future"

If so then these should just be part of the hours you're working from them. A natural part of the software development lifecycle is bug fixing.  Now if you delivered the software to them as part of a fixed price project then it depends on what was in your contract. If your contract stated that you would deliver pro bono bug fixes then you don't charge for bug fixes.

Worse, they're on the other side of the world, so when I get their requests in the morning, they're already asleep, so I can't really say no. I feel like I'm on call now.

freelance,320kze,NotSoShyAlbatross,3,Thu Apr 9 21:19:22 2015 UTC,"Instead of a complaint thread, I'd love to see everyone sharing their wins for the week. There's research showing that negativity makes us more likely to get rejected, and complaining about clients creates an ""Us vs. Them"" mindset that's really counterproductive — our clients are the reason we have the freedom to work for ourselves; they are not an obstacle between us and happiness.   When we focus on the bad things, we tend to shift our thinking to seek out more bad things. That's a really unfortunate way to live.   By focusing on the positive instead, we tend to seek out the positive — this makes our outlook brighter and increases our overall happiness.   I'm speaking from experience on this. When I was younger, I complained my fucking ass off. I was also pretty bitter, and convinced that other people were standing in the way of my goals and happiness.   After getting called on it by a good friend, I forced myself to stop complaining and — no bullshit — my life changed.   No, I didn't suddenly get rich or receive a ruby amulet that guarantees I'll never be sad again, but I did find that I was harder to upset, much more likely to have great conversations with friends and strangers, and my clients certainly seemed to like me more.   I believe freelancing is one of the best things that can happen to us, career-wise. The independence it gives us is an amazing gift, and it's our clients who let us stay out of a 9-to-5.

I would not use the word ""tied."" There are better ways of saying it. Also, try to phrase it in a way which highlights the benefits that your clients get from such an arrangement. Try to avoid ""my preference, I like, it's best for me"".  Perhaps something along the lines of:  ""I am unable to solely commit to working with your company. I am working with multiple clients which rely on my services. I do not wish to sever those relationships as they rely on me to run their business.""  Keep it short and don't go into too many details. If the client brings up objections, politely decline using variations on the above. If he continues to insist, fall back on a more generic, but definitive, ""I am sorry, but that will not be possible""."
freelance,31z6s0,ryan_castillo,3,Fri Apr 10 09:22:05 2015 UTC,"First of all, congrats! Them wanting to hire you full time is an indicator that you've done a good job pitching your value and your services.  For these type of offers I usually say something like:  ""I'm very flattered by your offer but I'm trying to see how this freelance thing works out""   And how would you transition to the topic of them hiring you as a freelancer instead?   The answer to this question is ""it depends"".  You have to figure out their motivation to hire you full time.  In some cases they may be trying to hire you full time because they cannot afford your rate and would rather offer you equity (i.e. startups). Personally I decline all of these cases because there is no way I can go all in with my freelance business and a startup at the same time.  If they strictly see you as an asset they want to keep around full time then you can pitch your services for a lower cost than that of a full time employee. That you can offer the same value they sought for you in the first place but at a fraction of the cost and the time."

For me, the worst projects were business failures that I saw coming, but didn't have the guts/know-how to stand up and make changes to. One of them was for a friend, to boot.  We'll all fail. Sometimes, someone else will pay for our failure.   It happens in full-time employment - think of how many employees have horribly unproductive days, on the clock.  It happens when you buy products - how many times have you bought something that turned out to be cheap. Or a lemon. Or just a crappy product. You probably thought ""well, I'll never buy from them again"". But you moved on, right?  It happens in freelancing - someone paid for your time, and you didn't deliver. They took the risk of paying for you, and their risk didn't pay off.  To be clear: I'm speaking about honest efforts that fell short. You don't have to pay those back.  If you just didn't try, you're committing fraud and you need to pay back any money you took."

Then family-stuff happened, and consumed the time I'd allocated to this project.  If I can't find the time to get this project to 80% in the next week, then I'll cut a check, pen a letter, and move on.  Sometimes these things happen.  An apology letter and refund are a perfectly reasonable, and totally professional way to handle it.  In general, it's better if you're the one who sees it coming and acts proactively.

Since I began freelancing since December, I haven't really gotten a sense of how much I'll have to pay in quarterly taxes. Is 40% really the range of tax money one has to pay?  Regardless of the amount, saving money for taxes as soon as you earn it is sound advice.

I, too, have only been self employed for about 6 months and I've found it's better to save more when I can.

freelance,31wz2z,graphicdesigncult,2,Wed Apr 8 23:24:33 2015 UTC,"As others have suggested somewhere between 30% and 40% seems reasonable and conservative.   It might depend on if you incorporate or not as well.  My situation is different, because I'm a corporation and also in Canada, but I need to save just a bit less than 30%.   Another good tip is about cash flow.  Try to keep 3 to 6 months of your own personal cash requirements saved in the bank at all times.  And, it's hard to do!  I try to keep 6 months (because I'm conservative), and now that it's tax time and I've also had some unexpected (very expensive) vet bills, I'm running short of money.  I'm just glad I had cash on had and I didn't -- literally -- need to put my sick dog down.  My conservative savings have --- again, literally -- saved my dogs life.  While not everybody will encounter hefty vet bills, there might come a time where you don't get as many contracts as you need, and having that savings and cushion will make life more sane."
