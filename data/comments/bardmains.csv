bardmains,3e60f5,LOLZlata,2,Wed Jul 22 05:44:07 2015 UTC,Did not get the chance to test it out on the PBE but i will try it out tomorrow when it hits live servers. I think that it is going to be a strong item on Bard and other supports as well. The passive is just plain strong and it is something you might build if your team is behind as it can help with comebacks with the AP damage boost and crit boost.  I will be updating my guide a few days after the patch hits live and will add something about Zekes Harbinger after i get some play tests in.
bardmains,3e60f5,spazman1997,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:10:46 2015 UTC,I've always been a fan of iceborn on bard for the bullying and snowball potential but this will probably replace that as it's cheaper and benefits the adc too

bardmains,3e2egp,Slayer12rt,7,Tue Jul 21 12:54:17 2015 UTC,"that's not how it's designed to be used   That's the problem, you don't get a choice as to when it gets used. A heal is something you want on demand and fast so that you can turn a fight with it. If it's lying on the ground then it won't turn anything because the enemy can see it - they won't commit knowing you'll just heal it back and kill them.   As for addressing the other part - what you've correctly drawn attention to is that other similar heals offer much more than Bards and instantly at the cost of a slight bit of HP. Kayle's is the best comparison as it offers MS and HP like Bard's but even it offers more health and instantly! Nami's heal does a max heal of 185HP + 157HP to a second target as well as the 212 magic damage to the enemy. Nidalee gets a scaling AS buff as well.  Lets look at bard's main competition though, other supports:   Soraka has a 2s 240hp heal. That means it takes her 8s to heal more than your best case scenario where someone is able to abuse 3 heals + cast all at once. In the 12s that your heal is down she has matched your heal and healed for 480hp more.  Janna shield is 240hp on a 10s cd (so more hp, lower CD) and it gives 50 ad at the same time.  Lulu shield is also 240hp on a 10s cd, and gives pix for bonus damage and the ability to launch a ranged Q.  My favourite! Thresh lantern shields for 220hp for 2 people (so 440 total) on a 16s cd that gives huuuge utility at the same time.    Note: Sona can heal up to 165 with her heal and it also comes with a 115hp shield. 280hp in best case scenario on a 10s cd for 2 people."
bardmains,3e2egp,duffercoat,2,Tue Jul 21 13:35:58 2015 UTC,"Nidalee's swipe scales with her ult level, not her heal level."
bardmains,3e2egp,AnEpicHope,2,Tue Jul 21 19:46:54 2015 UTC,"My bad, completely forgot thats how it worked always thought of her like elise. Edited it in."
bardmains,3e2egp,duffercoat,2,Wed Jul 22 01:24:58 2015 UTC,"And also because of Nami's passive, she also grants movement speed on her heal."
bardmains,3e2egp,akiller122,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:49:47 2015 UTC,"A heal is something you want on demand and fast so that you can turn a fight with it   I feel like that description better suits shields and even then is far too rigid a statement to use about anything. I 100% agree that it is stronger  when it can be used without delay but this is why it is given the ability to be placed and have up to 3. you could make the same argument that Stuns should be on demand and fast but that isn't how braum/ekko/Vigar/Viktor (just off the top of my head) work.   Riot puts delays and gaits on actions and spells to weaken then so they can strengthen them elsewhere.Bard's heal sucks with no charge and has a large mana cost early. But you can have 3 of them down and you can leave them around the map in strategic locations so people can use them when necessary without you needing to be around  Everyones spells have different utility on top of the heals, i merely wanted to show that as a base heal value Bard's heals are similar to other heals and that if used properly can be very powerful. to often people make it sounds like the heal you get from a shrine is next to nothing, but if that's the case, no one really has any good heals in this game  As far as your comparison I left out shields because they have different use cases and concept than heals. They are intended to be larger most of the time or have smaller cooldowns as they do not replenish health and have to be used against incoming damage to be helpful. Comparing the two is like apples and oranges, yes they have some similarities but they are intended for two different things  Soraka was intended to be the healer of league, if someone could match or best her in a healing contest Riot did something wrong. What my point was is that the best healer in all of league cant match the instant health you can get from bard and would cost her 20% of her HP and 8 seconds to get up to that value. Yes, she will by all means win out in heals in the long run, but 3 shines is more than her ult+heal together for at least one person"
bardmains,3e2egp,duffercoat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:55:55 2015 UTC,"I brought in shields because I wanted to show what other supports bring. I know they're not the same and aren't as good utility wise, but for the large part they will play the same role - particularly in laning. But I feel you're still getting way caught up in the best case scenario here and not looking at the most common case.    base heal value Bard's heals are similar to other heals and that if used properly can be very powerful.    Well only if you make the comparisons you have. If you want to compare Bard's best case you have to look at other supports best case. Taric wil heal 220 for 2 people for a total of 440hp, Nami will heal 2 people for a total of 342hp, Sona will heal 2 people for a total of roughly 320hp, Alistar will heal 180 for himself +90 for each ally for a total of 540hp in the best case scenario. So tell me how does waiting 10 seconds for 230hp compare? - And yes im only considering a single cast because these champs could use their heal multiple times in the same time that bard can set up his relics.      Now look at the more common case, where your ally can't get to the shrine, or someone that doesn't need it as much takes it OR the enemy just steps on it. Well you've got 150hp on demand, and a 50%ms buff every 12 seconds. Suddenly it now seems like you might be better off using that speed to get out of harms way, instead of waiting for 80 more hp.   If heals were invisible I could understand your reasoning, but the fact is they're very predictable and outplayable from an opposition point of view. If alistar headbutt/pulv engages he can then just walk forward and trample your 3 shrines, same goes for thresh or leona if they land their engage. The simple fact is theres no rational reason for wanting to level heal unless you're in a poke lane of Cait/Soraka or sona.   Note: Theres a reason theres very few instant stuns for the reason you mention - instant abilities are MUCH more powerful than ones that take time. Its part of the reason lulu and janna ult are so strong."
bardmains,3e2egp,letor,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:48:02 2015 UTC,"i do see that bard's heal gets a lot of flack, but honestly it isn't undeserved. yes, they are useful in the laning phase when you can stack 3 behind/under your turret, and replace them as soon as they are taken, but even for the mana investment they still feel very lackluster. they aren't entirely useless, but they definitely feel very piddly. if you are stacking them in such a manner (which usually requires two blue pots) this cuts into your mana for the Q spam in lane, which arguably brings much more utility.  not to mention 90% of the time in soloq i have to danger ping them when people pick them up as they are still charging, and tell them to let them charge, ridiculous given how long bard has been out."
bardmains,3e2egp,duffercoat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:36:29 2015 UTC,"ya, i do agree that it takes a lot of coordination with your ADC and it infuriating when they take them early or not at all. one thing i would recommend try is putting them in lane bushes if you are pushing up, it can really help if you get ganked or if they try and engage on you. people never expect your ADC to come out the other side of the bush with more health than they started the fight with"
bardmains,3e2egp,2ndAccountHere,2,Wed Jul 22 00:00:32 2015 UTC,Heals are visible inside bushes even to the enemy IIRC.
bardmains,3e2egp,niqquhplz,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:23:07 2015 UTC,"You didn't mention mana costs though, and IMO that's where Bard's heal really falls flat, especially early game."

bardmains,3e2egp,Jibbakilla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:42:54 2015 UTC,edited the post to add in numbers for mana cost. It only is really large cost early (comparatively)
bardmains,3e2egp,LordHanker,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:03:41 2015 UTC,"You do have a point - W isnt as pointless as people say it is. BUT FIRST your number comparisons are a bit wonky:     Sona heals 2 people for that amount, herself as well as the lowest nearby person AND the shield aura - for 80/85/90/95/100 mana. Nami's heal when used properly (prioritizing healing) also heals 2 nearby people, with the extra damage - for 70 / 85 / 100 / 115 / 130 mana. Kayle's heal is comparible, since its single target as well as having MS boost, and heals for a similar amount to the max heal on bard (however instantly with no 10 second charge time) , but only costs 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 mana. (compared to 100 / 105 / 110 / 115 / 120 mana on Bard) Nida's heal has the AS bonus, so isn't completely comparible, but her heal is a bit meh.   These costs aren't so crippling on Bard assuming you use mana efficiently (never stay on full mana - always place a heal before getting chimes etc.) but the fact that you pay 100 mana for 30 health a 50% decaying speed buff for 1.5 secs to try and save an ally is almost pointless. Like that's the cost of most ultimate abilities. What.  The reason Bard's heal costs so much is due to the shrine interaction - you can indeed place them where a fight is likely going to occur and leave them in preparation for free health when running away etc. But the number of times this has been useful is so limited - I can't even think of one right now. Unless you are on voice comms you can't even rely on people to notice the fucking things in solo Q, as well as the possibility of getting stomped :'("

bardmains,3d846a,w3doe,6,Tue Jul 14 06:35:33 2015 UTC,"One of the easiest ways to use the ulti is to engage with it. Catch people off guard and out of position. 1-2 carries being caught out of position might as well be a death sentence. Teamfights are much more difficult to land good ultis. You could always just save them for reengage or disengage after the fight as well. My little flicker moment for bard was when I realized ""bard is not most other champs. I do not need to use every skill in a teamfight and that includes my ulti."""
bardmains,3d846a,BigOmega,6,Tue Jul 14 08:14:30 2015 UTC,"In lane i usually use my ult for:   catching the two enemy laners, while they're in stasis your jungler can get off an easy gank.  catch the two enemy laners so your adc can get in a better position, so you can get a double stun off or to wait for cooldowns. catch one of them, so that you can 2v1 the other laner with ease to escape, use your ult to prevent a gank or to disengage the fight ult enemy tower to dive   Roaming / Dragon fight time!  this is the time where you can roam up to mid or get in a few skirmishes, this is what i use my ult for:   to roam and catch the enemy mid laner, wait in the bush and fire your ult at him. If it hits, this lets you land the stun and net the kill ulting enemies doing dragon, so your team can close in on them or sometimes ult the dragon itself (it will reset).  if the opportunity arises you can can even get the rare 3-4 man ult off (on the enemy of course). Doing this allows your team to focus the important targets and land all thier cc, which can singlehandedly win the fight. divide enemies to force a numbers advantage. Ult one or two targets so your team can easily kill the priority targets.  catch off the fleeing enemies, enemies that have flashed or dashed away escaping! not only to escape yourself (portal + stun + ult combo = 4 seconds of cc), but also for your allies. If you see one of your allies getting chased by 2 or 3 people, just throw an ult that way. If some of the enemies get caught, your teammate can run away, if not he dies anyway.   Teamfights:   I think other people have already covered this section well so im not going to go into it, use for dividing enemy team, to catch off enemies etc etc   I usually DO NOT, use it on my own team. This usually leads to issues and with the long cast time it is hard to predict what will happen in those 1 - 2 seconds, especially in soloq. In team fights it is also important not to ult your allies, unless when you are sure it will save them, or to extend thier zhonas time. IMO Bards ult is used 80% of the time to help RUN AWAY or to ENGAGE. Also, give me more suggestions! I'm not sure i have covered them all yet, there are just so many situations! Tempered fate is a very versatile ability and one that is hard to master."
bardmains,3d846a,ihsyvad,3,Tue Jul 14 14:41:08 2015 UTC,"When my ADC backs, I don't (unless mid isn't in lane).  Go mid, ult mid enemy champ when he is near a wall.  This gives you and your mid time to position.  Use Q to stun against wall and watch them die.    If this doesn't result in a kill or assist it will at least mean that their mid needs to back.   That's when I'd back or return bot.     That's my early game use for it, that and to tower dive bottom Mid game it's for delaying dragon for the team to catch up, stopping escapes, allowing escapes.   Always follow up the ult with a Q if possible.  Especially if teammates are coming. Late game I'll use it to stop them from getting to turrets from spawn.   Use a vision orb to see them coming after spawn timer hits 0.  Great way to give you the extra few seconds to take down turrets.     In team fights?  Nope.  Not unless people are very spread out.  Don't even waste it on a team fight, use it for escaping if you are losing or for catching them running away."

bardmains,3d846a,No6655321,2,Fri Jul 17 21:16:52 2015 UTC,"I like to use it if i can hit more of the enemy team than my own in a teamfight. That way i can force a numbers advantage for my team. So not necessarily a frontline-backline thing. Just fuck with their numbers, that's what i say! Even if your team are dummies who flash the backline they can't screw up a 5v3 ;) It's also good for stalling fleeing enemies for a gank or stalling the enemy team while you flee. Hope this helps! :)"
bardmains,3d846a,Crimson_76,2,Tue Jul 14 08:04:00 2015 UTC,Most success I've found is picking off a carry before the fight starts - i.e the carry is in mid lane waiting for team to group up - you can pick him off before the fight starts almost guaranteeing you a free dragon/tower (may need to fight more to risk baron depending at what time in the match it is)
bardmains,3d846a,bardface,2,Tue Jul 14 10:02:00 2015 UTC,"I think a good way to ult is midfight, if you are able to catch either frontline or backline. Those seconds in which you only have to deal with 2-3 members of the opposite team can completely make a teamfight. By disabling the tanks, you're able to just run straight at the carries and if you catch the carries, you wont have any notable dps to worry about and can just kill the tanks faster."
bardmains,3d846a,Skydrak,2,Tue Jul 14 13:41:24 2015 UTC,"Use it as an excellent engage and disengage above all. When you have good engage and disengage already, use it during a fight to take one or several of their damage-dealers out of the fight for a few seconds. That's about all there is to it."
bardmains,3d846a,LewsTherinTelamon,2,Tue Jul 14 15:42:06 2015 UTC,"another niche use of bard ult is to use it on your midlaner who used zhonyas inside of the enemy team and is going to die afterwards  if timed correctly, the enemy team gets hit by your ult before your mid's zhonyas runs out, allowing your mid to just walk away  also works with vlad in your team if he pools"
bardmains,3d846a,Malflol,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:03:12 2015 UTC,"Picks, Engage, disengage, re-engage. If you see an ally being pursued by the enemy team you can ult across a choke point and almost guarantee their safety.  I think re-engaging is probably the most underused one. Using your ult combined with flash will often set you up for double stuns on low health targets, making clean up exceptionally easy. It's also a hilariously strong counter to Zed. He dives your adc? Wait a second, then ult them both. His ult becomes useless and it gives you a chance to kill or wound him before he has to shadow back."

There are times I hate my self because I didnt throw the last auto thinking my ADC or whoever got it and they get away with <20 hp or if theres a chance my adc can die in a close fight, your autos meeps and spells would mean the difference in you carry living and the enemy getting a kill. If you take it on accident say sorry move on if they bitch mute them a fed support can carry bot lane and create zone control for your carry to farm up."
bardmains,3cxedb,Xellece,2,Sat Jul 11 20:44:53 2015 UTC,I find that Bard's high base damage with Meeps and Q are enough to land me quite a few more kills than on any other support.

bardmains,3cxedb,TrafalgarXLaw,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:56:58 2015 UTC,"I love that item. So much utility and really good defensive stats. You can effectively stop a pushing lane by placing the portal in a smart way. It can also be used as a baiting tool to set up an ambush and it can even backdoor exposed turrets. I often place it down when their tier 2 turret is exposed, inside their jungle. What would be really risky for other champs become a cakewalk for Bard due to his E and movement speed buffs.  Most of the time I buy it after SS, mobility boots and fully upgraded ap support item."

bardmains,3cwcid,N1ghtwalk3r,2,Sat Jul 11 14:52:49 2015 UTC,I found this matchup very easy. He doesn't really have any engage. Any time he tries to go aggressive you can slow or stun him and walk away. Tahms tongue lash is the only ability that he could even attempt to land.
bardmains,3cwcid,ThatGuyYouKnow999,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:56:49 2015 UTC,First i don't think playing against Tahm is that hard. Secondly his E regens 20% of the grey health and its not that good. Just don't let him eat you or don't get ganked by Tahm ult. Overall just play like you usually do.
bardmains,3cwcid,thering1443,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:00:09 2015 UTC,"It's pretty standard.  Just a skill matchup, there is no obviously superior champion as far as I can tell.  I've won every bot lane matchup vs tahm so far, but if you ever try to solo lane him it's harder because he has more poke than you.  Tahm has similar amount of cc, more damage potential, and way more sustain.  Just a lot less mobility, and if you're a good bard, you'll already know how to abuse your mobility.  And when he pops shield, disengage.  He sacrifices that regen for a gain in the engage, but if he does it too early and you can still walk away, then do it, and you will usually come out on top.  Just keep forcing his shield and he will be too low to do anything in lane."

bardmains,3cw2n7,EntityZero,2,Sat Jul 11 06:48:41 2015 UTC,"After taking a look at some of your builds(dont have time to watch replays :( sorry) i have noticed a complete lack for boots, boots are SUPER important and for a character like bard who travels around the map a lot anyway you should be buying them right after sightstone(before upgrading your support item).  I also see that you like to build Zz'Rot Portal, while i do agree it is a good item it is not so good on bard, or many supports for that matter. If you are looking for a good way to push a lane Banner of Command would be a better option for you, and if you are wanting the point runner passive is also on Ohmwrecker,it is a great nich item that gives the passive and has an amazing active if your team likes to tower dive.  So just buy boots before upgrading your coin, and after sightstone. Stop building Zz'Rot portal and try to look at other utility items that give resistances(health being a better stat on bard in my opinion). Also try to buy more pink wards, having vision control as bard is very important to make catches and knowing where the enemy is in general while not giving away where you are."

bardmains,3cw2n7,duffercoat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:25:13 2015 UTC,"Consider taking ignite more often - and make full use of it in lane phase. Remember forcing someone back or forcing their summoners can be just as impactful on cs (and hence gold in the lane) as actually getting a kill.  Finish talisman before you get anything else other than boots/sightstone or potentially aegis if its really needed. Don't get zzrot portal so often/early. Its a very selfish item (personal speed, personal armors) and you dont want selfish items as support. Like your second last game in match history I see you're building a BV? Get aegis instead. If you like lane control get banner - or locket if you like teamfights.   Make sure you've got enough Hp for whatever armors you have. From your build it looks like often you would benefit a lot from some extra hp (unless you're running a lot in masteries/runes? didnt check that)."

bardmains,3ch3vd,bardapest,2,Tue Jul 7 21:35:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can guarantee that it works with visible Shaco boxes, no clue about invisible. I don't THINK it works with Jarvan's ult but I'd need to test it. Might have just been me seeing things wrong."

Even a even trade with their ad is good, then you take w lvl 2 and pick up chimes when you need mana. It allows you to get tons of lane presence and keeps your sustain up."

bardmains,3ch2d7,madmattw,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:07:05 2015 UTC,"The only time I would ever consider getting W first and Q second is if I know we are going to be outranged and outdamaged early and we need to play safe. In this situation, I won't take the W for the lane, but will use it to leave 3 shrines for the jungler so their clear will go by quicker and safer, and therefore will be able to have much more reliable early ganks. By the time the jungler takes the shrines, I can have enough time to place them behind us for the speed boost to get away, in case we do try to engage level 2 and lose the trade.  Tl;dr - if you absolutely MUST play safe instead of going aggro level 1, give your jungler the shrines so they may have the advantage early to make up for it."
bardmains,3ch2d7,BaconyLeviathan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:36:01 2015 UTC,I say don't gather chimes.  I wait at first bush in lane to spawn chimes behind my tower (all 3 before minion farming starts).   This way I can use them to replenish mana and buy an extra health pot instead of mana pot.

bardmains,3ch2d7,BardOnlyNA,0,Fri Jul 10 19:02:10 2015 UTC,I usually start with my heal because not many opportunities arise for your q early game. I go to top lane and place a heal. Then collect chimes on my way to mid where I also give them a heal and then i leave one for the jungler after theur 1st camp. The chimes give me mana back so i am only missing a max of about 80
bardmains,3ch2d7,Thaiphoon23,9,Wed Jul 8 02:05:22 2015 UTC,As a true Bard Main this hurst my eyes to read.  You have one of the strongest lvl 1's in the entire game with your potential 2 man stun and empowered AA.  If u waste your first skill point on heal you'll never get the presence you need in the very early game to survive Bards very weak lvl 3-6 in which most others supps can bully him.  There is no reason to ever go Heal lvl 1. ever.
bardmains,3ch2d7,Daishou23,4,Wed Jul 8 03:03:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of your points here, but I think there is a better way to present them. We are all here for our love of bard, we should all be friendly to each other and not imply anyone else is an inferior bard main."
bardmains,3ch2d7,BornLastWeek,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:59:44 2015 UTC,"In my opinion giving your teammates a thirdish of a potion isn't worth not being able to chunk the enemy laners for 90-100 damage at level 1 with just your Q.  You should have tons of opportunities to make plays with Q in the early game. Meep auto + Q is really hard to trade back.  If you're not finding opportunities to fire it off then you're likely playing way too passive.  Get up in your enemies grill, get your spelltheifs stacks off, dare them to stand their ground and then wreck them with the stun if they do. If that doesn't really suit you then Soraka/Nami are better equipped for this heal-bot play style."

I always spam the assitance ping when I know they have a flash down or if they are pushed and usually get a kill out of it. (tunnel ganks from tri brush OP)."
bardmains,3ci866,LucasLee9,2,Wed Jul 8 14:57:15 2015 UTC,"How do you climb playing support?   I main support, and I find it tough in lower elo."
bardmains,3cgqdz,Anivia_is_not_kfc,5,Tue Jul 7 19:54:51 2015 UTC,"They have great pick potential, and you are squishy early.  You really cannot get hooked, because you'll die.  But if you play passive, you lose the lane.  It's a balance between knowing where you can stand to safely harass, and always be able to dodge an incoming hook (dont be in the middle of an animation when they decide to hook you!).  You bring more damage to the lane, so play the long game and safely harass as much as possible."
bardmains,3cgqdz,Etchesketch,-1,Tue Jul 7 20:33:14 2015 UTC,My tip is to play very safe and auto from behind your minions for harassment. If they miss their hook you have 10-20s of safety to make plays in. I also recommend a coin start instead of spellthiefs because you can't harass as much in lane and you can heal back up if you survive a hook.
bardmains,3cgqdz,Beyak224,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:36:29 2015 UTC,"You always want to start spellthiefs, and you can definitely harass them both in lane. It's a skill matchup, but the empowered autos with the damage from spellthiefs is too good to pass up."
bardmains,3cg1hv,The_johnarch,6,Tue Jul 7 17:03:43 2015 UTC,I would advise against starting W since it pretty much gives you zero lane presence lvl 1 which might get punished.
bardmains,3cg1hv,aWilkens,5,Tue Jul 7 17:18:17 2015 UTC,"I recommend you start Q first. Starting W means you have no lane pressure for the first minute or so which can heavily punish you, especially in cases where the enemy might get Lvl 2 before you and use the advantage to all-in.  If you still prefer W first, I recommend you just place all 3 shrines for the Jungler. Solo-laners always forget the shrines are there and almost never use it."
bardmains,3cg1hv,bardapest,2,Tue Jul 7 17:43:06 2015 UTC,"When I first started playing Bard I used to do that, since then I've stopped.  Most laners will forget they're there, or you'll just need them bot lane before they use them.  If you put one down anywhere I would put it next to the first jungle buff they'll be doing.  The jungler will then be your best friend for the rest of the game.  I actually prefer starting q now if I can, otherwise I just don't have enough protection for my adc if things get wonky level 1."
bardmains,3cg1hv,Nostrapapas,2,Tue Jul 7 17:19:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's only best to start W if your jungler has poor early sustain, or really strong early gank power. That being said, I also place 2 shrines for my jungler (one by 2nd buff and one before first buff) and the third for my ADC. This way, your carry isn't totally helpless with your uselessness at level 1, and you've created a great early gank opportunity for the jungler. Leaving one in top lane only leaves your top laner with one more small decision to make, especially if they're ranged or have decent sustain"
bardmains,3cg1hv,Polortide66,2,Tue Jul 7 20:22:13 2015 UTC,the only time i put one in lane is when im going from my red to my blue and drop one for my mid laner  this is as jungle bard

bardmains,3cegi1,aWilkens,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:30:56 2015 UTC,I feel like I do most damage if I only try to harrass with meep attacks and they do especially later in game a lot of magic damage. AD seems good too but I'd prefer the hybrid pen or if you plan to build something like BoC or other items with 40+ AP even Magic Pen.   Tank Bard is also a possible build but I can't imagine Bard as a tank. I'm not used to standing in the front line with him. He's a lot better when poking and stunning so the adc has fun with the enemies.
bardmains,3cegi1,Apocolocyntosiss,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:16:33 2015 UTC,"On supports in general, ad gives a lot of early harassment, a lot more then hybrid pen. as soon as u get some points in ur damaging abilites (in bards case only his q and passive) hybrid pen should give u more damage in general. so if u are planning on harassing in the early earlygame take ad, no problem. and of course u need to auto attack to make use of ur ad, which may get u range of counterattacks, while abilities should have a little bit more range."

bardmains,3cegi1,mocranks,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:29:19 2015 UTC,"I like using them because with your passive, your autos are magic and physical. Plus, I'm usually only autoing for harass when I have a Meep up anyway."

bardmains,3c8vw5,ErikThe,5,Mon Jul 6 00:10:05 2015 UTC,"Bard isn't really a match up heavy champ. He does a lot for every body but I wouldn't go out of my way to pick him supporting a Twitch or anything that needs heavy baby sitting. Bard can certainly do that but you give up so much map pressure having to hold off ganks.  That being said have a lot of fun playing with Vayne in lane. Chain her wall stun in to a Q stun and something is almost always dead. Any CC from your ADC (Jinx chompers/slow, Ashe ult/slow, Kalista ult/slow, etc.) is usually a solid bet for a good time in lane if you're good with your Q."
bardmains,3c8vw5,stothemizzle,3,Mon Jul 6 02:19:57 2015 UTC,Invisible twitch through a magical journey into another lane can actually be pretty devastating.
bardmains,3c8vw5,BaconyLeviathan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:37:48 2015 UTC,"Oooh, I haven't played with a Twitch yet.  My duo partner plays a lot of Cait and Tristana and we win a lot of lanes. I do agree with /u/stothemizzle and Bard is well rounded support that fits well with a lot of people."
bardmains,3c8vw5,travcurtis,3,Mon Jul 6 19:56:42 2015 UTC,"Bard's really versatile in that he can be paired with someone like Caitlyn and poke your enemy out of lane with ease, or he can play with a Graves or Corki and have them follow up with huge burst when you land your stuns (plus your level 6 is insane). Pretty much any ADC can work without any problems.   That being said, Bard/Vayne is one of my favorite lanes of all time. You can chain your CC easily and can easily get a few kills in lane depending on your matchup. He also does a good job of peeling for her in teamfights."
bardmains,3c8vw5,kuhwad,4,Mon Jul 6 02:59:08 2015 UTC,Another cool thing about laning with a Cait is that she can place a trap under an enemy while they're zhonyased by the Bard ult and then instantly be snared when they get out
bardmains,3c8vw5,2ndAccountHere,3,Tue Jul 7 00:16:03 2015 UTC,Never thought of that. That's pretty cool.
bardmains,3c8vw5,kuhwad,2,Tue Jul 7 01:23:04 2015 UTC,It could also work with a high level bard q if the cait is fast with her trap
bardmains,3c8vw5,Apocolocyntosiss,3,Tue Jul 7 18:28:19 2015 UTC,I really like playing Bard with Sivir. If  you manage to land a nice ult you can pretty much just run over the enemy team. Ashe is also very nice with their combined pick potential lvl 6.
bardmains,3c8vw5,aWilkens,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:07:33 2015 UTC,The pick potential with bard is insane. I love playing bard with sivir
bardmains,3c8vw5,lvl69blackmage,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:30:26 2015 UTC,"Bard isnt really a lane focused champion. He really shines when you use tunnels to roam mid, or sneak a jungler into bot lane. Kalista is one of the few adcs Bard can crush lane with. Most of the time you should just try to survive until you can get picks with ults and tunnels to start unfair fights."
bardmains,3c8vw5,liltonyabc,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:02:37 2015 UTC,"My favorite adc to lane with is Ashe. She has great follow-up harrass with her W-AA if you land a stun. She can stun, which you can chain into a stun, which usually leads to a free kill. Plus, the more time the enemy is dead the more you get to roam."
bardmains,3c8vw5,ShaquiquiBronson,2,Mon Jul 6 05:44:38 2015 UTC,"A good Ashe is definitely one of the better adcs to pair with bard, although they can all work very well with him."
bardmains,3c8vw5,BaconyLeviathan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:28:35 2015 UTC,In my opinion Bard does best with Kalista. With her W passive and Bard's passive they deal a lot of damage. They can trade really well against most bot lane champions. I LOVE ignite on bard. It's always good because if you manage to stun someone with Q and an ignite and if there is someone to deal damage its almost always a kill. Keep in mind this is just my opinion.
bardmains,3c8vw5,thering1443,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:42:38 2015 UTC,"Laning with Kalista is actually what inspired this post.

bardmains,3c8vw5,Anivia_is_not_kfc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:24:02 2015 UTC,"I like laning with Caitlyn, because you synergise really well with each other. If Bard lands a stun/ult on a target, Caitlyn can trap underneath them to land an insta stun. On top of that, she can time it so that her Q will hit them straight after they come out of bard ult or stun and immediately follow up with an ult, which combined with Bard's passive + Q + ignite is usually an easy kill."
bardmains,3c8vw5,ClickMyDink,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:52:03 2015 UTC,"I think cait and Kalisa are the best laners with him. Cait because when you hit the enemy laners with your meep she can usually hit a pretty easy q on them and when you ult she can place a trap under them. Kali because of your slow passive and your ults synergize pretty well. I really haven't had an ad that i though had horrible synergy with bard, but ashe and jinx can both whiff their ults if you ult slightly before them and never played with a twitch in over 110k mastery points on bard but he sounds pretty bad with him."
bardmains,3c8vw5,Gagaters,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:18:58 2015 UTC,I haven't laned with a Twitch either. But I get the oddest feeling that you don't work well at babysitting a twitch until he's fed.

bardmains,3c6mpm,stothemizzle,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:29:26 2015 UTC,"Could you give me tips on that? Every time a lane is free I rather pick up chimes or set up ganks than farm. At what times is it better to farm? This is the first I actively play support, so I still need lots to learn there."
bardmains,3c6mpm,stothemizzle,2,Mon Jul 6 07:50:34 2015 UTC,"If the ADC backs without you or dies, there's a chance to last hit the minions ( don't push the wave 90% of the time). Your ADC won't always been in a position to get every CS while he's in lane too, if you can't harass anyone and he's not going to get it, it's better you get the CS than it dying to minions.   Mid game there's usually a chance to pick up some CS mid at various points. Usually you'll find those situations when a large portion of people recall after a team fight and you're still healthy enough to move wards forward and grab a wave or two while you wait for them.  You don't need a lot of CS but there's a pretty big statistical difference for supports who can find the right spots to grab CS at the right times and the ones who can't. Getting enough to finish something like Aegis or the Legion or RG a few minutes earlier can be game changing."

bardmains,3c40oe,HolyCowly,3,Sat Jul 4 15:44:06 2015 UTC,"62% winrate bard in D4 solo q. Take spellthief and leave it at lvl 1 the whole game. Get your mobis and sightstone (swap to sweeper when u get stone and do neglect pink wards), then rush a frozen heart (get glacial shroud first). Get locket or banner (you will be at 30 mr until you get to this point in the build) then build according to the enemy team.  Take Q lvl 1 and E lvl 2. Level W at 4. Max R -> Q -> E -> W. Learn the ways bard tunnel can be used create kills for your team. There are lots of places where you can use it alongside a wall and it will act like a simple dash but with really good speed and distance. Try to only ult enemies that have no dashes on their basic abilities so you can get flashes or ults in return. Otherwise you will be much more likely to miss.

bardmains,3c40oe,DEATHinaBLUEtux,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:53:45 2015 UTC,You can use E along the bot lane walls to engage or to escape ganks. If you are in a losing lane and are sitting at turret you can level W for sustain but its only a small heal in combat. (Costs 100 mana and heals 30 to 70 hp) To actually win lane with bard you can only really place 2-3 shrines before the first back as the mana effect ratio is so low.

bardmains,3c40oe,TrafalgarXLaw,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:05:11 2015 UTC,Why do you think Talisman is bad on bard? I think using it in combination with Journey gives you and your team engage and disengage.

bardmains,3c40oe,TrafalgarXLaw,2,Mon Jul 6 13:08:45 2015 UTC,"Hey great to have another bard main, welcome! First off don't be put off by your winrate - he's an incredibly difficult champion and takes A LOT of games to master. I had a 28% win rate with him on the first patch he came out but stuck with him and can now hard carry with him regularly.   Ignite is almost always better. This is because of Bards strengths and weaknesses - namely he isn't very useful/strong until you hit level 9 and have some CDR. Once you are throwing out Q's every 5 seconds though you have a huge amount of power to change the course of the game. The point of ignite is to get you to give you some threat until you reach that point - it also gives you incredibly strong power at level 1 with Q-Meep-Ignite if the enemy disrespects you. There are times when you will want exhaust (against instant assassins such as Rengar/Kha Zix who will kill a carry before your Q will have a chance to stun) but generally stick to ignite.   The speed of max E should not be underestimated. It allows you to gank incredibly effectively because of how little time an enemy has to respond - make sure you know all the best routes to use this ability as it is your signature move. I understand there are still some that like to max W but you have to realise that this skill will never be a very effective heal when you need it - a 150hp heal in a teamfight on a 12 second cd is not much (for reference kayle's similar heal/speed boost gives 240 hp at level 5).  The Utility versus Tank is still an active debate even now. I don't think there is a clear best option here - different players prefer different things. There are a couple of things I will say though - if you see Frozen Heart as a necessary item for that game, get Mobies. Lucidity will get you closer to your point of impact earlier (where you have that super low CD Q) but at the cost of mobility.This is highly rewarding if you have good positioning, but if you're in an elo where fights are constant mobies may be the better option. Talisman is superior to righteous and should be your goal every game - frost queens is no good on bard and you're better off selling your spellthiefs as soon as the lane ends and you base with 700g for nomads medallion.   From there its really situational/personal choice. Banner of command/locket, mikaels, warmogs/randuins/bv/righteous glory are all fine items on bard (avoid damage items as a support, its a waste) but you just need to play around what you buy. For example if you get mikaels you have to play as a backline support - let your carry eat the sejuani ult if you have to because you can instantly cleanse it for them."
bardmains,3c40oe,duffercoat,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:15:41 2015 UTC,"Gold 1 scrub here (26 games playd with Bard on rankeds with 62% win ratio) to share my opinion, i m playing Bard aggresive on lane with lots of poke and sustain with control of river and start roaming after bot turet is down (with only exception that my curry doing some random recall and i have time and space to visit mid).     1. personaly prefere ignite to better trades on lane and making my lane partner ahead (even it isnt kill forcing enemy curry out of lane is good). Exhasut seems nice on paper but i cant make it as effective as ignite which is defintily easier to use (fed rengo can kill my curry before i can even cklick on exh for example).    2. IMHO depend on how fast you leave lane phase. Dont find maxing W useful when bot lane turet fall early since i end up using W mostly for speed (except some baron/dragon takes when i have time to make W grow bigger)    3.I always start with Spellthief's Edge for harras but never upgrade it and change it to coin->talisman right after my lane phase is over. Using mobi boots since i dont find lucidity as useful on Bard as for example on Thresh on which i running them. Other items depends on emey team. Against team with heavy AD i m going for randuin/FH (depends on what my toplaner/jungler is building) against ap heavy teams is solari clear choice. If i not need to be tanky (there is already someone in my team who is and doing his job right) i going for Glory after talisman to provide as much mobility for team as i can. Using 0/9/21 but never tried 9/0/21 so cant be helpful with this.     Mayby something from this will help? (lots of typos and bad englando included sorry :/)"
bardmains,3c40oe,Smetak106,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:41:23 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - There is a lot that can be said for all of the points you mention. Valid arguments on both sides usually, too. In a nutshell: Ignite OR Exhaust (both viable for different reasons in different scenarios), Max E second instead of W 99.999999999% of the time, items/builds are pretty subjective but the stats you think are a waste of gold are absolutely not a waste and items are worth far more to Bard than just their actives, 0-9-21 for masteries is what I use and have had the best luck with.  Bard is hands down my favorite champ so I could talk about stuff like this all day. I'm going to try and keep this as concise as possible.  Ignite v. Exhaust: I've played Bard with both and both are totally viable on him. Which one you take depends on a few things like your play style, lane matchup, etc. In a nutshell - ignite is most useful for laning phase and especially against ones that have a support with good sustain. Igniting the enemy adc can be the difference in winning that early duel and possibly securing FB. At the same time, exhausting the enemy adc can also be the difference in winning that early duel, but ignite sometimes is better to negate any type of healing/sustain that the enemy support may provide. Plain and simple though ignite will be almost useless after laning and exhaust will still have both offensive and defensive potential throughout most of the game.  W v. E as second ability: 99.999999999% of the time you want to max E (magical journey) second. From level 1 I usually go Q>W>Q>E because the level 1 W works great for early sustain but the heal falls off VERY quickly even at max rank and outside of laning is much more useful for the speed boost (which you get from putting only 1 point into W anyways). You won't be building AP really and the heal scales off AP - so maxing it second makes almost no sense. Maxing E second not only lowers the CD on the ability, but it increases the speed at which you and your allies move through the magical journey which is WAY more useful both offensively and defensively. Any good Bard player will tell you to start thinking of the heal as mostly only a speed boost after about level 5/6. IMHO, maxing E second is still better even when playing defensively in lane because the heal really just isn't enough to be worth it unless you are building a lot of AP. Side note: When playing Bard in ARAM I usually take the opportunity to build as much AP as I can and in that instance I max W second because then it's a noticeable heal even when casted directly on someone and not even given time to charge (and when given time to charge is even better obviously).  This last question about items/builds is very subjective. I used to build Righteous Glory on Bard and it seemed ok, but I have had much better success with other builds. I go sight stone first item EVERY TIME. Let me say that again. Get sight stone first. EVERY. TIME. One of your major advantages as Bard is being able to get in and out safely to get good, deep wards. How you gonna do that without wards? Exactly. Then I use to go mobi boots every time until I started reading about people getting Lucidity boots on Bard. CDR is your best friend as Bard and he already has lots of speed boosts built into his kit. The more Q's you can get off in a shorter period of time, the more useful you can be in instances like team fights. The shorter your CD is on magical journey, the easier you can do things like escape. Which boots I get sort of depends on what build I am going for, and what build I am going for depends on each individual game.  In a general sense I usually go for a more tank-like build with one or two item actives depending on what will be useful. An example might be something like starting spell thief's then going sight stone>lucidity boots>locket>randuins>sell spell thief and build Talisman as quick as possible (might feel weird to sell but it is absolutely worth it as spell thief's is good for laning, but talisman is way better for you than frost queen's claim come mid/late game. 6th item is almost entirely dependent on each individual game and it's current state (are you ahead or behind? Enemy lots of AP or AD? Would Thornmail be a good choice? You get the idea...). Another example build could be Sight stone>Mobi boots>Frozen Heart>Locket/Mikaels (which ever active seems more useful for that game)>sell spell thief's for Talisman>6th item. Despite what you might feel, Bard actually does benefit from far more than just the actives of certain items. HP, CDR, armor, MR, defensive passives (like Randuins) are all SUPER good on Bard. If you can be right in the thick of the team fight, spamming Q's for stuns and be tanky enough to soak some damage and survive then your team will love you. Squishy Bard with no CDR is going to throw one Q, do negligible damage and then die with Q still on CD.  Can't say I have ever tried 9-0-21 masteries on Bard. I pretty much always go 0-9-21 because he just benefits so much from the utility masteries. 0-21-9 might be viable (again, don't know cause I never tried) if you are going real tanky, but again I just think he benefits more from the utility masteries."
bardmains,3c40oe,SlowerEastSide,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:27:53 2015 UTC,"Man the main thing I can say is if you aren't roaming as bard to get kills/flashes mid (and even top on very rare occasions) you are doing something wrong.  If your support backs but you don't need to? Roam mid.  If you need to back soon, roam mid.   In lower brackets (gold and lower, even here in plat sometimes) you have to let your laner know that you will roam and to play safe.   Edit: Frostfang for the early level harass is great, righteous is a waste of a slot for myself. You can buy the CDR/mana portion of Talisman without giving up frostfang until you leave lane (need 1500g to go from Idol to Talisman in one sweep)."

bardmains,3bn2l2,ogre_bard,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:43:20 2015 UTC,I believe percentage of your team's gold matters too. All my S+ Bard games I had more gold than at least one or two other members of my team.
bardmains,3bn2l2,duffercoat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:38:31 2015 UTC,"Not true. I believe its to do with wards placed, %damage dealt of teams total damage and trinket upgrade/usage that plays a bigger role in determining S+'s. I've got quite a few S+'s and its generally the games where I'm on top of things with wards everywhere and doing more damage than my jungle/top. Had at least 1 S+ where I didn't get any kills cause I remember being surprised about it being S+."

bardmains,3bkhxj,arborcide,2,Tue Jun 30 12:03:03 2015 UTC,"Max Q, then you can choose to max E or W. I prefer E, since slightly stronger shrines just don't impact the game that much. Lower CD tunnels (and faster movement through them) can often save your life and let you get away with crazy shit.  I leave lane for the first time around lv 2 or 3, when my mana is low from dropping shrines. If i time it right, my jungler will be waiting for a tunnel when I return and we can get a great gank off.  Start with Spellthief's Edge—it adds damage to your auto attacks, which is your main form of harass as Bard. Sell Spellthief's Edge and start building Talisman of Ascension sometime later in the game (your main role as Bard is initiator, which Talisman of Ascension and Righteous Glory both help with). I generally go Mobility Boots (yes, with my first 800g!) ---> Sightstone ---> Righteous Glory, and then decide if I can build Talisman of Ascension or if I need armor/MR (in the form of Randuin's/Frozen Heart or Aegis/Banshee's). Also worth considering is Banner of Command.   I smart cast E. If you hold down E but don't release it, the indicator appears and the spell won't be cast until you release it. I adjust my tunnels this way.  I don't like Sunfire on Bard, since he's ranged and is rarely in melee range, and isn't naturally tanky. I don't like Frozen Heart before you have any HP items, since it doesn't give any HP itself (again, you're not naturally tanky). You should also consider Banshee's if the other team has a fed assassin, since Bard is easily caught out while he deep wards/roams."

The guide that most people seem to be sticking with is the guide by Ninetales in the Other section of the sidebar.   I want to have a discussion about build orders for jungle bard though. Not so sure AD on hit is the best in general. For another option try the guide by Bardapest which goes more tanky.   I always have E on normal cast. It is impossible to aim consistently on smart cast for those tricky extra long routes. And from base.  I'm with arborcide about maxing E second. The extra speed through magical journeys is so nice.   Leaving lane to collect chimes is something I'm trying to figure out too. I usually do it when I foresee a lull in activity and we're not trying to push and when I'm low on mana, or when I want to roam up to help mid."

But then, I realized: Who gives a fuck? If they're butthurt about it, then fuck em, they're being toxic. While not ideal for me to have it, you still killed the enemy. I take my newfound gold, buy some mobis and roam around the map getting chimes and trying to make plays.  If they're going to be a baby about it, then that's their problem."

Strategy-wise, I typically spam his health packs a bit more than ususal due to the increased mana regen you get on the map (which is apparently 0.75% of your max mana, at least according to the wiki). I place them in the mid bushes, along the mid wall opposite of that, and between my towers.  One really important strategy is the mid bush magical journey. No one really seems to know about it, so you can get a easy flank for most fights, especially at the beginning of the game."
bardmains,3bgxos,TCV2,3,Mon Jun 29 03:45:44 2015 UTC,"Your healing to allies is significantly reduced in ARAMs.  My ARAM strat would be to focus on utility or brawling. For utility, pick up Aegis and Frozen Heart depending on enemy damage balance.  For brawler (best vs tanks): go trifoce, botrk, hurricane frozen mallet, last whisper. Yeah, it's weird, but it chews through tanks. Or, if you have lots of AD on your team, swap trifoce for Black cleaver to shred for your team."
bardmains,3bgxos,FoxyMayhem,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:21:52 2015 UTC,"The only major change from my SR build path is that I grab sorc shoes instead of lucidity.  I also am quicker to pick up a mana item (morellos if my team needs one or chalice if I want the crucible eventually).    Ideal final build would be sorc shoes, talisman, righteous glory, frozen heart, banner of command, mikael's crucible.  Swap the frozen heart for a hextech sweeper in case they have invisibility, mikael's for a morellos if necessary or athene's if you don't need the active.  Zeke's is also a really good choice if you end up with a lot of ADs on your team (assuming one of them is a bruiser with good engage you could swap out talisman or glory)."

After sightstone and mobis, I rush frozen heart and together with 4-6-20 masteries, I already have 30% cdr, which is not really that bad. pre-20mins into the game. I get the remaining 10% from one of the aegis upgrades or the support item upgrades."
bardmains,3arffp,imlivingonmars,5,Tue Jun 23 17:08:24 2015 UTC,"Bard isn't a great tank, to be honest. Nor is building him AP a good idea. He is well and truely a ""utility"" champ.  I'd suggest watching aphromoo's stream, the guy plays a ton of bard and is very fun. Aphro also tends to build him with banner of command.  You're like janna, you usually want mobi boots, since you can always escape. It also helps you roam a lot more efficiently. Lucidity is another good option, since lowering the cd on your Q is AMAZINGly helpful.  Don't bulid frozen fist. Your meeps already slow, you need a different kind of utility. Either frozen heart, randuins, or aegis.  Don't leave weak laners. Caitlyn and ez can take care of themselves, but ashe and jinx are risky. Varus you'll absolutely screw if you leave him. Make sure your laner is ok with the roam, bard is a good roamer anyway.  Finally, unless you're sieging, max your E second. The bonus move speed results in higher winrates, according to champion.gg  Unless you guys plan on skrimishing, start W, and drop 2 shrines for jungler. Back for mana. Place 1 in lane. Keep placing shrines during laning phase (max 3 at a time) until you reach 1/3ish mana, then save mana.  HAVE FUN! (How can you not, it's bard)"

bardmains,3amrpt,ImNotGonnaDoIt,6,Tue Jul 7 20:21:31 2015 UTC,I really enjoy using Ohmwrecker mainly because no one expects it. I make sure I tell my team I have it and that they can go deep if they're with me. I can also combo it with my ult on a tower if we need the extra time.
bardmains,3amrpt,FourtE2,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:56:33 2015 UTC,"Not yet convinced by ohmwrecker or zz'rot portal, but raptor cloak is surprisingly strong. The speed around turrets makes mid lane a highway. Also helps with incombat speed when using mobi boots."

bardmains,3amrpt,SuperDanceParty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:49:46 2015 UTC,"I've kinda hit a rut as bard, win rate was probably below 50 for the last month. I play bard a little bit differently than others for reasons the sound pretty solid to me. I'll go over where I differ from most bards, and my reasoning for it and maybe I'm not seeing the real reason for the standard bard builds. I've italicized direct questions for those bardmains who are just skimming. ;)    I dislike buying Spell Theifs Edge (STE), and favour Ancient Coin. I find many times trying to proc STE I take more damage than I deal, leaving myself to low to poke at 3 stacks, and therefore wasting gold. Also I find the health regen from AC very useful, allowing my ADC to take more shrines as my health will be higher from not taking damage in the first place and the HP gained from the passive. Furthermore I find I get more gold from AC in almost every matchup. *   Am I giving up too much early damage taking AC over STE?   I don't like taking offensive red runes. Hybrid pen. and AD marks both don't seem to add much damage. I usually take armour marks. While we're dealing with the rune page, I normally take move speed quints, maybe 1 armour and 2 move speed. My reasoning being that the armour red and yellows make up for the lack of armour quints, and that move speed allows me to take less damage in trades if I can outrun the enemy adc. *Is the 9-13 armour too much to sacrifice for 3% move speed, am I over valuing move speed? * I normally take W on level 1 and put at least 2 shrines in the jungle before chimes spawn, and 1 in mid or bot lane. I find 140-210 (70/shrine, I don't take any AP) really helps the jungler and have noticeably less executions than when I take Q level 1. I don't know if I'm against the grain on this one, but I almost exclusively take ignite over exhaust. By taking ignite I am trying to compensate for my lack of early damage by taking W first and the lack of STE proc. I think it's the right move unless you're against a very exhaust-friendly enemy team, maybe with an assassin or two.  I don't like taking mobility boots! For someone wondering if he overvalues move speed, hating mobies might be surprising but the drop in speed while in combat is really annoying. I prefer taking CDR boots or merc treads, or boots of swiftness even - anything to not get stuck with boots1 as soon as I get into combat. I also don't like righteous glory, mostly because I get talismon every game and ToA lets let engage and run away, useful in bronze when everyone might not be on the same page. Allowing the team to bail out or run away after over-staying is flexibility that righteous glory can't offer. Is this something that will go away in silver when teams commit better? Is righteous glory really good for a particular reason?   My normal build is coin, ward and 2 HP pots. I try to upgrade my coin and maybe get boots before buying sight stone, mostly because few ADCs can handle me wandering before levels 7-9. After getting Nomad's medallion, SS, and boots2 (usually CDR or merc treads) I usually try buying Banner of Command, unless a major AOE damage threat where I'll get Locket. Should I almost always go for locket?  Is level 2 shrines a waste? I skill level 2 W instead of E on level 4, because I don't mind taking it on level 5 and probably won't be roaming too much before level 5. How crucial is level 3 Q, can it wait until level 7? Usual skill order: W, Q, Q, W, E, R, Q, Q, Q, E, R E, E, E, W, R, W, W.   Too busy roaming, did not read:  The big problem I'm having is the enemy will ignore me completely and beeline to my ADC. The ADC gets dunked a couple times and the team never recovers. Should I go for more early damage to be unignorable? By not taking exhaust, am I allowing my ADC to get dunked on?"
bardmains,3alk2j,Gagaters,3,Sun Jun 21 11:58:05 2015 UTC,That's awesome! Really well played highlights! Love your understanding of the champ and in particular choosing at times to hold q and use meeps instead - when reksai followed your tunnel you use an auto for the slow knowing she'll die and then save q for the 2 members that are flanking you.

bardmains,3aln2m,duffercoat,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:46:00 2015 UTC,"I would say build it every game.  Righteous = Engage And also peel with the slowing it lets out  Talisman = Disengaging or engaging or just moving around the map to places faster  Mobies = Being at locations when you need to, selling them late game for like maybe CDR boots or merc/ninja is also good, but for the most part, Mobies for mid-late game"
bardmains,3aln2m,Gagaters,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:30:32 2015 UTC,"I heavily recommend against this, as you are basically reducing the efficiency of your items by having them overlap. For example if you have talisman then you can use it for disengage and engage (minimising the benefit of RG - especially considering talisman has a 32* seconds cd now). Mobies compounds this even further - you will be wanting to get as much CDR as possible in your build but if you opt for talisman/RG/mobies you will have itemised for speed x3 but only 10% cdr.   Compare this instead to talisman/locket - you trade out 200hp, the mana and slow of RG for 10% more cdr, a 20 MR aura and a shield of 60-230hp along with another personal 20 MR. Unless they are running a super mobile team where you need the slow/another speed boost locket will almost always be the better option (if they don't have a magic damage threat then replace locket with frozen heart).   Note: I'm not saying righteous is bad by any means, just don't double up on it and talisman ideally (especially not with mobies - get lucidity to cover the CDR you're forgoing for more speed)."

bardmains,3almq6,pull_me_aside,3,Sun Jun 21 14:17:08 2015 UTC,I almost always take exhaust so that we at least have a chance of stopping the one person who invariably gets fed from instakilling the team.
bardmains,3almq6,duffercoat,4,Sun Jun 21 14:04:09 2015 UTC,"ignite always. it is crucial for the level 2 or 3 all in. and like an additional user said, it directly counters the heal meta on adc. there's a reason no pro takes exhaust on any support anymore"
bardmains,3almq6,dancing_bagel,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:47:44 2015 UTC,"Depends what elo you're at honestly. Lower elo where people are more likely to dive you because they're fed already, take exhaust most of the time (except with high sustain champs). For higher elo (plat +) I think ignite is better because it gives you much more pressure in lane that exhaust can't provide (except against multiple assassins). I does however depends on personal preference a bit too, if you are going to play passively anyway in lane then Ignite won't offer all that much."
bardmains,3almq6,TheRiverSaint,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:55:53 2015 UTC,"I always take exhaust vs Kalista, Draven and Jinx as they are all very autoattack reliant and it cripples their damage more than most."

bardmains,3alkfc,duffercoat,2,Sun Jun 21 15:06:34 2015 UTC,"I love going Ice gauntlet when the enemy team has a lot of melee champions, it gives you some CDR (which is the best part about it, but at times I feel like I over cap on CDR so I feel like I waste this stat), the armor and mana is ALSO great (more mana from passive) but the best part about it is the slow that you get after using an ability, Its Amazing how much peel it allows you to have once your meeps are recharging again! Its amazing :) A bonus is that if you do have a hard time landing your Q, Throw an auto out and while the auto is in the air, selfcast W for the speed burst AND for the Ice gauntlet proc, meaning you can catch up faster and properly position (if need be) for your Q"

bardmains,3alkfc,Gagaters,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:22:34 2015 UTC,"Well, since the attack particle itself is kinda slow, by the time it lands on the enemy, you have casted W and that procs the Gauntlet so that when the particle lands, it'll proc it :P Its a little nifty trick."

I see Thresh and Bard as the only two supports on the highest tier of support champions right now. They are both on another level in terms of versatility, playmaking ability and utility.  Thresh also has a few similar play patterns in that his skills can be used for engage or disengage, like landing a Bard Q, both can hold their own very well, both can babysit their laner if need be but also roam incredibly effectively."
bardmains,3akb77,Dismistri,4,Sun Jun 21 01:08:19 2015 UTC,"There are two simple ways to use bard ult. First, you can use it on single enemies or a pair of enemies that are out of position and you team is near by to kill the trapped enemies. Second you can use it in teamfights by putting either the tanks or the squishies in stasis and killing the other group in the stasis window. There are obviously more ways to use his ult but starting with these two cases can help you to see its potential and understand it better as you play him."
bardmains,3akb77,liltonyabc,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:21:17 2015 UTC,", Lustboy talked about this a little bit. If you Stasis the enemy backline then you can just melt their tanks with no back up and if you ult the enemy tankline then you can blow up the carries with no protection."

bardmains,3akb77,CalamackW,5,Mon Jul 20 17:59:38 2015 UTC,"I like using Bard ult in the following ways:  1) Catching enemies off. If it's laning phase and your jungler or team is coming for a gank, you could use your ult to give your team time to position for the gank  2) Diving -- using your ult to stop a tower during a dive is so powerful. The turret is off for a full 2 seconds, turning a risky play into a free escape away.  3) Dividing the enemy team -- In a big team fight, if you can separate the back-line and leave the front-line by themselves in the middle of your team, you allow your carries to pick off the tanks and go straight for the carries after everyone else is dead  I almost never use my ult to save people except when a champ is zhonya'd or reving through GAand the enemy team is waiting around to pounce on them. Ult them before the effect wears off so that your teammate can walk away.  Another great one is when you're laning and you use your ult to disengage from the enemy team (ult them not you)  Never try to ult your own teammates directly, unless it's a unique situation (have yet to face it myself) -- it almost always turns bad."

bardmains,3ahqq5,Serpenthum,2,Sat Jun 20 07:56:50 2015 UTC,"why do you max w over e second, the health you give is little to none and the speed boost is flat from lvl 1, while if you max e second you and you allies go through the tunnel faster and the enemies go through slower which can make getting away much easier.  also with the build i tend to see frozen heart better than Randuins due to the cooldown it gives also if you have a jungler who will be building the  aegis  do you still build one or do you build a banner, I feel that a banner on bard gives you the cooldown, some nice ap and the active can help with obj plays if they have only one soruce of ad wave clear"
bardmains,3ahqq5,bitebo,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:10:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with frozen heart and build it often aswell, i also get aegis almost every game just because the stats and active are simply fantastic on that item. As for skills, i personally like maxxing w second since i dont really see a game changing difference in maxxing e (while w may not heal for a lot, maxxing it second can make a big difference in extended fights). Keep in mind this is just my opinion and im sure maxxing e second can work too."

bardmains,3ahmrd,solthas,3,Sat Jun 20 17:26:38 2015 UTC,Ulting your self alone in this situation allows the tower to continue doing damage to the greedy players and you remain safe. You are right that it also creates enough time for shen to arrive and clean up.

Since MJ is still faster tho, this portal will get you to lane sooner.  Admitedly it's hard to get it done fast, but with practice it becomes a second nature :)  ** edit : hmm I can't remember if either it's faster or if since you lose time with hg buffs it's more beneficial to use the 2nd portal because you have no ""downtime"" of ms boost, anyway it still holds true ^^"

bardmains,3aa39d,Bardtacular,8,Thu Jun 18 15:50:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't use it for healing much: mostly the speed boost.  What I will do for healing is plant a flower near where the back line or path of retreat will be so others can recover from their ""7 hp and still burning.""  In lane, if we're pushed up, I'll plant them in a line spaced out from where we are back to our tower so when I peel, the ADC gets some healing and speedups back to safety of our tower."
bardmains,3aa39d,ParinoidPanda,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:27:29 2015 UTC,This is what I try to do (since with 3 planted you can still directly target).  The problem I run into is when an ADC doesn't realize to use these when running away and instead thinks of them as only health packs... Durr!  I also try and put one in the water bush sometimes for ganking initiations.  (The jungler almost never takes advantage of it but what can do you).

bardmains,3a3c8j,Simonlamms,6,Tue Jun 16 22:15:03 2015 UTC,"Rule number 1: Have fun man! If you get support just play who you want. Ranked, I'd just talk to you're team about who they're all going and plan accordingly.   I personally like to bring Bard into team comps that the tanks may have a hard time sticking to their targets (Nasus, Cho'gath, Volibear, Rek'sai, ect)   I don't really like bringing him in when there are already 2+ assassins on my team because if you slip up you can easily ruin what they're trying to do. HOWEVER I absolutely love taking bard against assassins. Its a real challenge in itself but if you wait for them to blow their dodge/jump/engage you can easily get your team a kill with your ult.  The best way to approach telling your teammates who you're playing is to give them an option of 2-3 options so that way they feel as if they had a say and it won't really be on you anymore.   Anyways hope you keep the king alive in whatever you play! GLHF"

Being that you are typically out of lane, they will probably need a bit more mobility in order to survive.  I love going with Ezreal since he is practically a solo laner, but I like going with Trist, Lucian, or Caitlyn."
bardmains,3a3c8j,Chalqk,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:46:50 2015 UTC,"Very true a lot of the non mobile ADCs have a hard time cooperating with bard (save Ashe), but you definitely do need to be careful about when you roam with Bard..

bardmains,3a3c8j,MtnyCptn,2,Wed Jun 17 08:28:10 2015 UTC,"Being a good support is based on how you support both your ADC and your team. Playing Bard you want to be focusing more on supporting your team, not your ADC, but when playing f.ex. Nami you are playing more for your ADC. This being said of course you shouldn't leave your ADC to die constantly just because you have chimes stacked up and you can now make a roam to mid lane. In this post I'll go through some basics how to play Bard more effectively for the benefit of your team and your adc.  Laning  When in lane your best friend is Passive+AA+Q+AA. This deals substancial amount of damage with either hybrid penetration or magic penetration runes. Use this combo every time your passive and Q are off cooldown. In order to do this you might want to have some mana regeneration in your runes. It doesn't even matter if you aren't able to land stuns with your Q as long as you land the damage.  Your second best friend? Of course your tasty little heal shrines. Depending on the status of the lane, use these to make a path for your adc from the middle of the lane back to your turret or a cluster under your turret if you are being pushed under your turret. These heals will help your adc even if you aren't around.  Using Magical Journey is really situational when thinking about being 2v2. Best thing you can do with this is either cut from under your turret behind the enemies if they are low/behind and pushing or use it to escape from the middle of the lane. Remember to try to position yourself near the river instead of the bottom bushes. This allows you to use Magical Journey without having to take time to relocate yourself next to the wall you want to use.  Tempered Fate, you son of a *****. This spell has many uses during laning but mostly it is used to: * Give you time to disengage * Catch enemies * CC the player you are NOT focusing, giving you time to blow up that nasty Leona before her adc has time to follow up on her combo.  Whenever your lane gives you a moment to breath try to see if there is any chimes near your lane and go grab them. You want to get as many chimes as possible in early game but always see that your ADC wont be left in trouble while you're getting them. Collecting chimes is different from roaming, as roaming takes a minute or two but collecting nearby chimes only takes ~10 seconds.  Roaming  Roaming with Bard is fast, effective and most of all fun. But my ADC keeps dying every time I roam... Their Vayne is now 5/0 and there is no stopping her. Wat do? ;-;  Even though Bard's kit is very good for roaming it doesn't mean that you should do it constantly.  Learn WHEN to roam. This is by far the easiest way to secure both your ADC's life and successful roaming. You shouldn't be roaming only when you are confident that your ADC is in a position where he/she can survive for a minute or two alone. This is always extremely situational and thus I wont list any certain situations. Your ADC will whine at you if you spend too much time on a roam, so make the roaming decision and contribute to it. If you see that it will probably not pay off (mid gets pushed under enemy turret or something while you are on your way) turn back to lane.   Before leaving your lane always make sure you have two or three healing shrines up for your ADC. This leaves your ADC with at least something to help if things get heated in bottom lane while you are gone.  Please add to the list things that I missed and discuss the points I raised as I just threw this up quickly on my break. There might be some mistakes."

bardmains,3a1wkq,arborcide,4,Tue Jun 16 18:23:46 2015 UTC,"Bard's base skin lends itself to wonderfully to his lore.  He's a mysterious, crazy looking being from legends and tales, and belongs to other dimensions, that isn't a man or a woman, an animal or a human, or whatever you want to label 'him' as.  He's just a big bumbly looking being with no defining characteristics that have a purpose or reason to be the way they are.  Which works because he's not evil or good, happy or sad, dangerous or safe, so he shouldn't resemble those things.  His simple design works perfectly with his simple lore/definition.  By making him a theme, like a woodland caretaker, it (to me) lessens his amazing lore."

bardmains,3a1i78,Polymorphz,3,Tue Jun 16 16:26:56 2015 UTC,I don't start w because I lose my lane by starting it instead of easily winning.

It allows the jungler to gank before backing %99 of the time. Usually ganking bot as a thanks for the health relics haha, its a win win."
bardmains,3a1i78,Polymorphz,2,Wed Jun 17 14:08:49 2015 UTC,"It might help the jungler, but stunning his starting monsters also helps the jungler. Not only does Q stun the monsters, it helps him kill them faster, causing him to take less damage already.  Aside from that, W start removes all lane pressure and allows you to be easily bullied, while Q lets you bully the enemy bot and take control of the lane."

bardmains,3a1i78,gobber178,4,Sat Jun 20 18:37:55 2015 UTC,"Little tip for starting, (I'm low rank so this may be wrong/not apply at your rank)   I take w first. Go to top lane, place a shrine.   Wait til 50s for my 2 chimes. Then go ward top buff (assuming jungler isn't starting there)   Shrine in mid. Then back to my adc and jungler.   Shrine between gromp/krugs and the buff for the jungler. Then go to lane picking up your third chime on the way, which normally spawns between where you are and your tower.   This can put you behind a bit in lane (some people like to take q first). But it means that every lane had another half a health pot. And the jungler is more likely to be able to gank before backing.   That means that the other lanes are more likely to succeed. And I generally worry less about them feeding, and I'm generally confident enough in my own abilities to win bot.   (Please note, you will get yelled at by your team as you walk top lane. Don't reply. Just watch all the rage turn to love as they realise what you're doing :) )"

I build bard as utility/tank.  I start with spell thiefs then sell that for talisman later  my main build atm is boots of lucidity of the cool down as the main prob with mobis is that once you cast your ult you are in combat so there is that downside.   Sight stone is obv one for any support.  I currently like to build banner of command over locket atm due to most jungles build one and the ap really helps with the binding's and the active is really helpful in setting up a split push or making chaos in bot or top while you go for barron or drake.  Frozen heart is amazing on bard for the cooldown and the passive.  mikaels if they have alot of stuns or cc's   and a zz portal is a nice thing, has great stats armor, regen, mr and a move speed passive, and dont forget the active.  p.s this is a great place to pick up tips and learn stuff because unlike the main lol subreddit this is just for bard so everyone here is super helpful."

I've been finding that near the end of the game it can actually make your damage relevant due to the burn, shredding tanks with your autos and your binding but also because of the insane base damage your meeps scale to end game. With a little pen, it lets you almost solo carries   But i follow ~the same build path,  spell thief's -> sightstone ->CDR boots ->an agis item (locket if they have good AD wave clear like Siver, banner if they are all AP wave clear)  -> randuins -> sell spell thefs for coin and upgrade it -> liandry's torment"

bardmains,39ur8o,littleronan,2,Tue Jun 16 13:04:15 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. Depending on the enemy teams damage, I'll go either locket or banner. I ALWAYS build aegis of the legion first though, after sight stone.  I like twin shadows, no one seems to use this any more and it sure seems to help with catching people out.  Raptor cloak seems to be a must, then into zz'rot portal for the extra lane pressure. You can zzrot one lane, and banner another. It makes it harder for enemies to pressure dragon/baron.  Frozen heart for armor and cdr if I need it, if not then randuins for the extra slow.   Mobi's with the green enchant and I'm hitting speeds near 700 while collecting charms."

(once you got the 3rd tier item of your choice, you get 40% cdr already. And that would be roughly 20-22mins into the game)  If I really don't need the 40% early, I build Righteous Glory, and keep the spellthief.  For resistances, I go *a.) Warmog's and Zz'rot Portal (because.) *b.) omen, banshee. If you do not disrespect them. *c.) Zhonya's, Banshee.  or just friggin go Liandry's, Voidstaff if you want to BM their tanks. Bard Magic"
bardmains,39ur8o,Longpole_Ranger,2,Tue Jun 16 15:52:46 2015 UTC,"I like building bard with a lot of mobility, tank and pushing potential. For example, i start with coin (allows reliable gold even in a losing lane and ap doesnt do that much for him anyways) , followed up with mobility boots for extra roam potential. I then take Iceborn Gauntlet which is easily proc'd thanks to your spammable q, making pushing and slowing targets even easier when you dont have meeps. For extra pushing power, i take Banner Of Command, 1) To allow an off lane to push harder, faster and 2) to allow my team to have more mr and 3) i can sometimes splitpush and still be viable thanks to my e and mobility from talisman and mobi. I then go full tank, usually Righteous Glory and Randuins, or sometimes Banshee's. Its up to you really, Bard is one of the few champions where diversity is his power, as you can build pretty much whatever you want on him. You need tank? Get taanky items. You need utility, get utilty (remember that his w does NOT proc the Ardent passive). Ap bard is ok, but it isnt the best. Only do this when you already have a tank and too much ad."

bardmains,39sfqs,Novokuv,9,Sun Jun 14 08:46:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely Spellthief's.  Your Meeps count as a basic attack, so you can proc Spellthief's twice in one hit.  Ancient Coin forces you to stay in lane to collect the passive gold, and since Bard is a roaming support, the item becomes counter-productive."
bardmains,39sfqs,FoxyMayhem,4,Sun Jun 14 09:23:23 2015 UTC,"Meeps count as a spell, don't they? I thought they consumed spellsheilds.  In any case, spells proc Spellthief.  What's your item path for bard jung?"
bardmains,39sfqs,duffercoat,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:27:32 2015 UTC,They most certainly do proc spellshields. If you're playing against a sivir lane I recommend using q just before you auto the enemy sivir as they will proc their spellshield only to have your auto hit first (much faster travel time) and pop it before the Q lands.
bardmains,39sfqs,SuperNintendo420,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:10:12 2015 UTC,"Also the Bandit mastery is an amazing synergy...I think.

If you need to stay in lane because it's a hard lane matchup, then Coin.  It's all personal preference, Spelltheif's is what Rito recommend though."

You can still roam and come out with a decent amount of gold as long as you know WHEN to roam.  I'm in an elo where playing aggressive gets you killed because your team will not move a finger to help you out. Playing passive and waiting until team fights seems to win games where I'm at. Not saying I die a lot on bard. But there are times where I see a perfect opportunity to engage and will watch my adc focus on last hitting 1-2 minions instead of getting a kill..."

bardmains,39qn14,Jiggidypuff,5,Sat Jun 13 20:24:42 2015 UTC,"copy and pasting a reply I gave to someone bout a week ago:  Initially I maxed W 2nd but now I prefer E max since it just feels better for my play style.   But what I find myself doing most often is is putting an extra point or two in W before maxing E actually.   Concerning ult usage (especially in solo-q where I'm not able to communicate my exact thought process to teammates in the flurry of battle) I usually use it in a few ways:   to pick someone off or try to force a favorable fight.  use the fight to freeze members of the enemy team to reduce their threat or dps.    so like if I see their top laner/jungle off to the side attempting to flank during a fight I'll ult him to make it a temporary 5v4 or if 2 or 3 of the enemy are diving our back-line heavy I'll ult their back-line in hopes we can successfully peel/kill them before stasis wears off.   Looking to ult on top your teammates+enemies require a lot of situation awareness and knowledge of ability cooldowns on both sides.   Maybe your ezreal e'd backwards but the enemy flashed and is on top of him he lands a q or 2 after kiting back for a few seconds but is in danger. An ult here on top of them will buy time for Ezreal to Arcane shift away.   However if I ult him right away after the arcane shift I don't allow him to kite and essentially kill him there.   This also depends on the divers and their cool-downs, ulting your carry and Irelia is more risky than ulting your carry and say a Malphite who has already used his ult.   That's what I enjoy about Bard so much every game feels like it has something new to offer and allows/forces me to make decisions based off that game."

bardmains,39qn14,EatherII,4,Sat Jun 13 20:27:51 2015 UTC,"The thing is that the movement speed boost is the strongest factor of your heal, unless you play full AP Bard (which you shouldn't imo), your shrines won't be healing for a lot. Level your shrines doesn't give more movement speed. --> Magical Journey is better to max second for the pick potential, escape potential en lower cooldown so more roaming, ganking, strolling, ..."
bardmains,39qn14,duffercoat,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:17:21 2015 UTC,Yep this here. The W appears to be better than it is because of how much it can heal if fully charged. However you will rarely get to use that heal when you actually need it. When you're in a fight the most you will get out of W is the speedboost - which doesnt change with leveling. On the other hand E lets you make picks/escape/bait much more easily and is incredibly powerful at max rank.
bardmains,39qn14,Ashangu,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:36:27 2015 UTC,This is good to know. I'll make sure to try this out in my next game!
bardmains,39qn14,Phailadork,2,Tue Jun 16 14:20:39 2015 UTC,"This is correct. W's MS boost doesn't scale with levels and stays at a Flat amount so the only increase you get from leveling it up is the strength of the heal (note the CD doesn't even go down either) and by the time you're working on your 2nd skill to start maxing it's already into the mid game where lane phase is over and getting charged W's is a rarity. You're mainly using it for the speed boost.   The utility and play making that E provides is far too good to not max second, especially after Riot buffed it and lowered the CD. Considering most Bard builds are CDR heavy, you'll have it up extremely often and be able to move around the map and make plays all over. Having allies move through it faster is also very noticeable and can set up some really nice baits.   Q gets maxed first, obviously. It's how you harass in lane and don't get destroyed, increases the stun duration and reduces the CD. You get the most bang for your buck going Q first."
bardmains,39qn14,euw_Unfortunate,2,Sun Jun 14 07:42:46 2015 UTC,"Both are fine, level whatever works for you second."
bardmains,39qn14,LSRoby,2,Sat Jun 13 20:36:18 2015 UTC,IMO Maxing W is useless. I say max E for the faster speed + enemies travel slower so you can escape/bait very easily and move through the map faster than a rammus hooked on speed.
bardmains,39qn14,Jayswing,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:29:40 2015 UTC,"I will sometimes put a 2nd point in W, but E is best to max second in most situations."

bardmains,39q8ei,Quido050,7,Sat Jun 13 18:17:01 2015 UTC,"My knowledge is pretty low level here but I have found Vayne to be a good thing all around for Bard. As a lane partner, your both looking to hit the wall related stun...Like if one of you hits it, the other can follow up for double CC. And then as a lane opponent, Vayne can be easy to bully early."
bardmains,39q8ei,SuperNintendo420,2,Sat Jun 13 18:52:39 2015 UTC,Your speed up also makes it easier to hit her 3rd hit procs :)
bardmains,39q8ei,AnimNations,3,Tue Jun 16 13:20:21 2015 UTC,"I personally enjoy playing with almost every ADC in the game, I would have to say that it depends on how they are playing as Bard can almost set up for any adc in the game."
bardmains,39q8ei,spazman1997,3,Sat Jun 13 20:15:46 2015 UTC,Take a look at this page: http://champion.gg/champion/Bard The interesting statistic is towards the bottom.
bardmains,39q8ei,Bismuthinite,2,Sat Jun 13 22:27:13 2015 UTC,Kallista/Bard would have to be my favorite. I go AD Quints and hybrid pen runes so my chime with her W passive does some massive damage. My least favorite is probably Ashe. I don't know why but I hate how immobile she is...
bardmains,39q8ei,MajorEnsign,2,Sat Jun 13 18:36:56 2015 UTC,Agreed. Kalista passive on W does so much damage with the meep-empowered autos

bardmains,39q8ei,LordHanker,2,Mon Jun 15 20:14:04 2015 UTC,Vayne and Jinx are my favorite. Vayne because chained stuns and Jinx because Bard Ult + Jinx positioning chompers on them for a guarenteed chomp while bard gets in position to stun with his Q is silly broken in 2 v 2s bot lane.
bardmains,39q8ei,ENGROT,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:46:21 2015 UTC,I used to hate playing with ezreals especially since their wave clear was lack luster and i couldnt make my skill shot plays. then bard came and Having a cluster of minions makes landing Q easy :) also they can escape if you for whatever reason opt not to be in lane. I have to check who i've had issue with but will post up once i figure it out.
bardmains,39q8ei,Xellece,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:53:53 2015 UTC,"Do you mean just in lane? Lane synergy and map synergy is very different and I would consider some adcs good lane partners but bad map synergy. What you want with bard in lane is someone that can capitalise on your stuns and make the trade heavily in your favour/set up kills (like Varus's Q/E/R). Outside of lane you want someone that makes the most of your peel (since you wont be diving) to output a lot of damage so self peel champs like Ez don't suit this.     Good lane partners: Kalista (w trades are strong), Draven, Lucian, Graves, Caitlyn  Good outside of lane partners: Vayne, Ashe, Twitch Good Overall synergy (both): Varus, Sivir, Jinx  Bad overall partners: Ezreal, Corki, Kog'Maw   Note: I've ignored MF, Urgot, Quinn and Trist because I don't have much experience with them and they're hard to judge from their kits."
bardmains,39q8ei,duffercoat,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:17:42 2015 UTC,"Lucian, corki ezreal for how independent they can be, so now you don't have to babysit but collaborate with him to win."
bardmains,39q8ei,chozenj,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:45:30 2015 UTC,"I'd say Draven is also a nice one to have. Draven is a strong lane bully, so pairing it up with a bard who can deal quite a bit of damage with meeps and your q's plus the added sustain with your shrines is nice. Plus he can stand his own fairly well when you're off roaming. I recently played a game where I ulted the enemy bot lane and the Draven's ""Stand Aside"" knocked them into the ulti XD But this can be used backwards as well (also I guess after stunning with your q). I'd say most ADC's that can provide CC work well with bard because of how everything can chain together with your kit. But honestly, I haven't had much problems with any ADC, all seem to work well with Bard, I guess it really depends on what support you're verusing and how easily they can engage onto your ADC while you might be roaming."
bardmains,39l3jy,CleaverBeaver,9,Fri Jun 12 14:10:08 2015 UTC,"So part of it is that its just a very strong item in some situations. It's an item that basically occupies the aegis spot for supports that are ap focused in some comps (ie only consider it on supports like janna/bard/nami not naut/leona/blitz).   The comps that you will look to use it with are poke/seige comps and splitpush comps (some exceptions apply). If you have a teamfight comp (typically indicated by aoe abilities and cc) locket will be the better option, same applies for having all your teams gold on one carry or you are running a protect the __ comp.   Once you have your banner you will then need to know when to use it. Don't just use banner of command whenever its up, there are important times that you will want to make use of it. These are when you are pushing for a tower - use the banner on a seige minion which will prevent the magic damage waveclearers on the enemy team from killing it. Note that if the enemy has primarily physical waveclear (zed, lucian, sivir) then this is one of the exceptions where you wouldnt want banner regardless of your team comp. The other case you want to use it is to buff a minion on the opposite side of the map that you're pressuring. This can be with a splitpusher (have them push top and you banner bot) or when say baron is coming up (banner bot side minion) and then dance around baron - even if they fight, your bot lane will push in and draw someone out/take a tower.   Think I've covered anything, if you have any questions though let me know."
bardmains,39l3jy,duffercoat,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:52:25 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this, couple of small things I'd like to add.  Getting banner purely for the active is under certain circumstances good even on champions like leona/blitz/naut.   If your jungler is getting locket, you should almost always get banner."
bardmains,39l3jy,euw_Unfortunate,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:17:23 2015 UTC,"Great point, forgot about cases where the jungler will have an aegis too. In those instances you can also get yours later than usual and focus on other items such as mikaels and then get your banner after them"
bardmains,39l3jy,duffercoat,2,Sat Jun 13 08:41:35 2015 UTC,"I prefer Banner of Command to Locket of the Iron Solari on Bard and all AP champions. You choose to build one of those two if you want the MR aura. I prefer Banner over Locket because of the stats. It's +60 AP vs +200 health; the AP seems more useful to me. It's also more gold efficient; 108% vs 88% according to the wiki.  That's all ignoring the active effect. Locket gives the 230 point shield. That's probably better, but only if you can use it effectively. I find Banner's minion buff works better in chaotic solo queue games. I can use it at my leisure and add some pushing power to a lane. At low Elo everyone ignores top and bottom lane towards the end; a few Bannered minions in one of those lanes can end up really moving the map. Plus it's hilarious watching LeBlanc or Kassadin try to kill a buffed minion."
bardmains,39l3jy,NelsonMinar,2,Sat Jun 13 17:31:50 2015 UTC,"By nature of his skills Bard is a great champion for split up matches where he can help his team to pick kills on isolated enemies. In a straight up 5v5 Bard is risky, but if the enemy team is split up he is amazing.  Banner of Command is a natural pick up for this skill set because it will help with splitting the enemy up to allow your team aggressive picking moves on the other side of the map."
bardmains,39knbl,duffercoat,4,Fri Jun 12 11:44:16 2015 UTC,"Minute 45, preparing for our second dragon trying to deny their fifth, i set up vision and i see their vayne staying near their outer mid tower i throw a tempered fate and catch her and then my team completely destroys that poor vayne, then we push for the inhib and ace the enemy team. GG and a fantastic S+, the first with bard. It was pretty amazing because they doubled us in kills and they take and inhib and almost win but, well,  BARD happens."

I was able to keep a 100% kill participation for around 15 minutes by helping gank mid. Nothing special but likely one of my best games ever.
bardmains,39knbl,Xellece,3,Fri Jun 12 19:27:57 2015 UTC,Occured in gold 1 mmr: We lost vision around baron. We decided to check. Our riven face checks into all 5 of them at the pixel bush immediately dashes away with the enemy shyv ulting on top of her and cc'd from enemy ashe ult. the enemy team still hanging around the pixel brush and riven currently stunned low on health I cast my ult leading 4 man stunning their back line allowing my self and rest of my team to catch up to the area and focus the shyvanna.

bardmains,3941qk,kuhwad,5,Tue Jun 9 02:44:45 2015 UTC,"I always get the cd reduction boots, because I feel that cd reduction is by far the best stat for bard and thus want to max it asap. Considering that at level 8 you should have rank 5 Cosmic binding, at least 30% cd reduction (Utility mastery 5%, Lucidity boots 15%, Kindlegem 10%). That's 1.8s stun every 4.2 seconds. As landing Qs to stun enemies is pretty much the main thing I do with bard besides catching people with Tempered Fate, this is at least for me an obvious way to build him.  Building Mobility boots sure give you a faster roam times, but for myself I feel that saving a few seconds on a roam is far less beneficial than being able to spam stuns faster in teamfights."
bardmains,3941qk,kalsuu,4,Tue Jun 9 05:40:34 2015 UTC,"Just a few corrections here, Level 9 is when you get rank 5 Q, 30% CDR gives it a 4.9s cd and you will rarely ever have kindlegem by level 9 assuming you are starting sightstone, lucidity boots and a gold item (and even then theres no guarantee you will have all 3 of these).  Otherwise I agree CDR is the most important stat and you want to max it first. There are definitely times where you want to go full tank and forego the cdr (against low damage comps, where they have say sion top, lulu mid etc) but generally cdr is the best thing you can get to maximise your usefulness"
bardmains,3941qk,duffercoat,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:52:14 2015 UTC,I find that even if you want to roam a lot boots of Lucidity may be better because of E spam (my fav ability).
bardmains,3941qk,Politeod,3,Sat Jun 13 19:07:16 2015 UTC,"Bard has such great disengage that, like janna, you can almost guarantee that you'll get he space necessary for your mobas to kick in.   Bard also has great roam, and roam is most impactful in the earlier laning phases when it's not expected (levels 4-7, after first back). I usually back with 935ish gold, buy mobi and a pink, and deepward. The mobi let me do it safely, and let me spend more time fucking with other lanes.  That said, usually want to leave lane if you have an ezreal or caitlyn, but if it's someone you have to babysit, maybe lucidity is better for laning."
bardmains,3941qk,FoxyMayhem,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:11:47 2015 UTC,"I think that my biggest problem with Mobi's is that I rarely ever roam mid with the intention of ganking. The only reason I leave lane is to collect chimes (which is probably something I need to work on) and I guess I don't notice the lack of movement speed with CDR boots because of the short MS increase the chimes give.  I've also heard that Bard's ultimate counts as being in combat and cancels the Mobi's MS. Do you find this a hindrance when you ult from a long-ish distance and try to join the fight?  The only reason I'm questioning myself is because one could make the same argument (besides the ultimate issue) for Janna, yet I still highly prefer Mobi's over Lucidity on her. Maybe I just need to get used to them."
bardmains,3941qk,FoxyMayhem,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:17:30 2015 UTC,"I usually ult for picking fools off, or helping our carries avoid damage. In the first, I have to be close enough to follow up with my q, so the speed difference of mobi being off doesn't effect me much. There's a small distance where it lucidity would let you close but mobi wouldn't, but it's pretty negligible imo.   Another note on lucidity, if you need max cdr fast because they have a ton on persistent engage, lucidity is a better pick I think."
bardmains,3941qk,NelsonMinar,2,Tue Jun 9 15:32:15 2015 UTC,"Arguably Bard has less need for movement speed than most supports since the kit provides so much mobility. (Pro tip from Krepo; don't pick up single chimes early; leave them in the jungle to give you fast paths later.)  OTOH I tend to build Banner, Frozen Heart, and Spellthief's on Bard and that's 40% CDR right there, albeit slowly. The Lucidity is tempting but then what, sell them? I guess that's only 300g wasted."
bardmains,3941qk,TrainwreckOG,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:22:06 2015 UTC,"i find mobility to be the best, it helps you pick up those chimes faster and helps get you around the map fast. Lucidity is fine but I find it easy to get cdr capped sense your core items all have cdr."
bardmains,3941qk,Salmonhands9,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:32:08 2015 UTC,"I buy mobi boots on most supports because they allow better roaming.  However, I personally find the reduced CD on magical journey to be more effective at early roaming than mobi boots so I usually pick up lucidity on Bard.  Whatever boots are going to help you do your job better are probably what you want to buy."
bardmains,3941qk,binwinbronzebottom,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:23:19 2015 UTC,"I find lucidity boots more reliable in many situations because early cdr is important on Bard, but it really comes down to team comps. If you need to rush a Frozen Heart for your team, mobis are probably a really good option since you're gonna have a lot of cdr in your build already. Just keep in mind, mobis are deactivated by your ult even if used at long range, and cdr boots can help your roaming since they reduce the cd of Magical Journey."
bardmains,3941qk,UBeenTold,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:21:52 2015 UTC,I used to always go mobility boots until I heard one of Krepo's points for cdr boots. Your ultimate puts you into combat. This breaks your mobos making it harder to follow up. This is the main reason I now do 100% cdr boots on bard.
bardmains,3941qk,bardface,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:42:19 2015 UTC,"i build what krepo does: Sightstone > Lucidity > locket > randuins/BV > finish frost queens/talisman (if i haven't yet)  I really like capping cdr, since it brings your stun to such a low cooldown enabling you to kite for your adc so well, and it also gives you a little bit of survivability + more utility during teamfights.  Lucidity boots allows you to hit the cap a lot more easily + quickly, and gives you a good chunk of cdr prior to mid game teamfights  Although - if you are planning on roaming a LOT - obv go for mobi's"
bardmains,3941qk,spazman1997,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:33:26 2015 UTC,Personal opinion.  Lucidity Boots if you prefer AP Bard.  Mobility Boots if you prefer Tank Bard.
bardmains,3941qk,Senthe,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:01:04 2015 UTC,Why is that? Just because AP items don't give much CDR?
bardmains,3941qk,Scumbl3,0,Tue Jun 9 03:09:53 2015 UTC,"Because if you're building AP (thus increasing your damage and healing), you'd want to be able to use your abilities as often as you can. So CDR Boots is best.  Tank Bard is more about straight utility. You'll want to be in the middle of the fight to absorb all the enemy damage and peel for your carries. So you get Mobility Boots to ensure you're always at the front line."
bardmains,3941qk,Scumbl3,2,Tue Jun 9 03:39:40 2015 UTC,"When playing Bard i dont really find my self needing the extra CDR, Most of the support AP items you are going to buy will get you 40% cdr late game, and mobis are cheap and nice to have on supports and Bard specifically. I could possibly see CDR boots for early mid to mid game if you are looking for that early 40% rush.  Something to note, if you are trying to stay in the front line, Mobis are not going to help you much once you get in combat, swiftness/merc would be better for staying at the front line."
bardmains,3941qk,ShaperSavant,2,Tue Jun 9 04:03:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think many AP items provide CDR. The only popular items with those two stats are: Morello, Athenes and Frost Queen's."

bardmains,38i8bw,AlphaWolfSniper,3,Thu Jun 4 12:19:58 2015 UTC,"I use double pen marks, hp seals, ap glyphs, movespeed quints. I almost always go locket/banner of command into frozen heart. Items after that depend on the game, but are usually crucible / warmogs / banshees / qss / thornmail."
bardmains,38i8bw,iamnotsurewhattoname,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:35:15 2015 UTC,"Did banner get buffed recently? I see people starting to pick it up in LCS as well. Or did people finally realize the importance of minion control?  I like to rush righteous glory, since i feel like bard thrives on chase fights after initiating with ult."
bardmains,38i8bw,NelsonMinar,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:29:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah Banner is basically exactly like Locket now in stats, except it's +60 AP instead of another +200 HP, which is more gold efficient and IMHO better on Bard. Of course the actives are different; I like Banner as a way to boost a lane in solo queue games without much interaction."
bardmains,38i8bw,TwigCreator,0,Tue Jun 9 12:16:03 2015 UTC,"They changed it so that Aegis builds into both Locket and Banner of Command, so its much less out of the way of the normal build path."

bardmains,38i8bw,digidevil4,3,Thu Jun 4 21:35:07 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the player/playstyle, I play a very calculated play style, never taking unnecessary risks, and thus average ~3 deaths on all of my support champions."

bardmains,38i8bw,Seizing_sponge,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:30:03 2015 UTC,"I really like triforce over gaunt. The move speed and damage give you so much chase.  I usually go tri, frozen heart, then BotrK if they are mostly tanky. Otherwise I build more tank, like Banner. That gives me almost full CDR."
bardmains,38i8bw,Seizing_sponge,2,Fri Jun 5 14:49:32 2015 UTC,"Next to the person to most likely to carry the fight, 90% of the time that's either the adc or midlaner. Not during teamfights, unless the fight is won already, mostly use E to get picks / provide an out for you carries. Both and more, depending on the situation. See link to my guide I posted somewhere below. Depends a lot on matchups, I try to use my aa proc whenever it's up, but only when it's safe to do so. I use Q mostly to get poke down / zone (if say a Thresh walks up, throw Q in such a way where he'd get stunned if he actually tried to engage)."
bardmains,38i8bw,solthas,2,Tue Jun 9 05:17:02 2015 UTC,"Would you be willing to make a guide or something? Also, do you start q or w first, most online guides say w but I have found q a much more useful start at lvl 1."

bardmains,38ia2t,GLOTI,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:08:34 2015 UTC,I don't understand what happened?
bardmains,38gd0g,flipsidewish,6,Thu Jun 4 00:57:36 2015 UTC,"According to Champion.gg, for some reason the players with the highest win rates max E second."
bardmains,38gd0g,solthas,7,Thu Jun 4 07:34:42 2015 UTC,"Most certainly. The heal on your W is quite simply not worth it, it has a high mana cost, poor heal on demand and its strongest utility (the speedboost) doesn't change on level up.   In contrast the utility of your E gains with every level in that it allows for much faster plays. Suddenly picking off that split pushing jax is easy to stop because your tunnel allows you to can get to him before he can escape. Maybe you've had a long laning phase and are roaming mid, now the enemy midlaner gets much less time to escape you than a level 1 E. It also means you have much more time to set up if others are following through your tunnels -as enemies dont go faster."
bardmains,38gd0g,duffercoat,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:29:21 2015 UTC,"My preferred approach is starting Q in most cases, 2 points in W, and then a point in E. You don't need the E too early, and if you're getting harassed, it can be worth it to have that extra heal. It only increases the mana cost by 5 and the uncharged heal is 60, which is ten short of a charged lvl 1 shrine. After that, you should have enough use out of W and can max E second."
bardmains,38gd0g,Nublare,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:29:25 2015 UTC,I go Q-W-Q-E. Bard has strong early game so getting some damage on Q is nice. That atleast what Krepo does.
bardmains,38gd0g,Likeadize,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:09:42 2015 UTC,If you want to be a cool guy you can start W and place some health packs for your jungler and maybe one for your mid laner. I like to place one under mid lane tower for mid laner and 2 for my jungler and then go back to base to get full mana.
bardmains,38gd0g,Paperiolento,2,Sat Jun 13 21:39:15 2015 UTC,"You just have to practice! Practice using those ults and roaming to get the chimes when your adc backs, when you are walking back to lane, or when you are walking to roam. Go collect chimes in the enemy jung only when you want to also deep ward (otherwise they probably aren't worth getting)."
bardmains,38gd0g,LordHanker,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:31:31 2015 UTC,For collecting chimes I can give you some things to remember. Only collect chimes if they are close enough that the enemy lane wont have chance to kill your adc (no more than 2 seconds out of lane) Or if your adc is farming safely under tower or enemy lane is at base. Even then try to get some other usage of your chiming trip. Try to plan out the path you will take so you will ahve your bonus movement speed at all teh time and so you can maybe roam to mid lane or place some river wards. Never collect chimes from enemy jungle early game if you don't know where the enemy jungler is! If you see them top lane you can go collect chimes from their jungle still remembering my chiming rules. When doing that you should remember to place a deep ward while you are there. it will help alot.
bardmains,38gd0g,Paperiolento,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:37:15 2015 UTC,Kind of a late response but how i get my chimes i say i'm out warding. I do ward of course but i make it a secondary objective to get chimes or drop off a care takers shrine into mid lane and around a jungle camp or two. I usually do this when the enemy laners have based or there is one in the lane or my adc is competent enough to not die 1v2 ie playing behind the minions while freezing or slow pushing. If my adc is in trouble drop the ultimate on the enemy laners to give my adc some breathin room. Always make sure you let your laner know what you plan on doing and to tell them to take care
bardmains,38gd0g,Antiquitus,2,Sun Jun 14 03:34:38 2015 UTC,Thanks appreciate it! The only reason why I thought of maxing e second is the reduced cd to increase mobility drastically
bardmains,38gd0g,hakspeare,9,Thu Jun 4 01:28:22 2015 UTC,"Initially I maxed W 2nd but now I prefer E max since it just feels better for my play style.   But what I find myself doing most often is is putting an extra point or two in W before maxing E actually.   Concerning ult usage (especially in solo-q where I'm not able to communicate my exact thought process to teammates in the flurry of battle) I usually use it in a few ways:   to pick someone off or try to force a favorable fight.  use the fight to freeze members of the enemy team to reduce their threat or dps.    so like if I see their top laner/jungle off to the side attempting to flank during a fight I'll ult him to make it a temporary 5v4 or if 2 or 3 of the enemy are diving our back-line heavy I'll ult their back-line in hopes we can successfully peel/kill them before stasis wears off.   Looking to ult on top your teammates+enemies require a lot of situation awareness and knowledge of ability cooldowns on both sides.   Maybe your ezreal e'd backwards but the enemy flashed and is on top of him he lands a q or 2 after kiting back for a few seconds but is in danger. An ult here on top of them will buy time for Ezreal to Arcane shift away.   However if I ult him right away after the arcane shift I don't allow him to kite and essentially kill him there.   This also depends on the divers and their cool-downs, ulting your carry and Irelia is more risky than ulting your carry and say a Malphite who has already used his ult.   That's what I enjoy about Bard so much every game feels like it has something new to offer and allows/forces me to make decisions based off that game."
bardmains,38cciu,nibbors,2,Wed Jun 3 08:31:27 2015 UTC,"I think it very much depends on what elo you play at as to how potent Bard is. In higher elo's (im dia 4 on Oce, so its not like im at the apex) players are much better at dodging his q and ult when there is no pressure on them. The main aspect of this I find is that his lane is incredibly weak and exploitable if you don't push up on the enemy laners.   What I'm getting at is that I think starting W is not a wise choice against enemies that will know how to punish you appropriately. You will be out-traded and out-pushed level 1 (even though you have heals to sustain back the hp it slows your push) and will have to back up while they have level 2 advantage. This denies you access to any chimes that may spawn in lane - which give you a significant advantage at both trading (you want to hit 5 chimes asap) and sustaining your mana to trade more often. On top of this, he simply doesn't carry the damage of other supports making it a lot harder to capitalise on the opposing lane pushing up. In some particularly safe lanes (e.g. cait nami) you will find yourself and your adc falling incredibly far behind simply because your adc will have to farm under tower and can't trade with you even if you land a stun.   The best counter to this I have found is to always start spellthief's, and Q and abuse Bard's level 1 strength. With meep auto's and spellthief's I will always outdamage the adc even if q is missed/dodged (but it's important to have q or else they can all in on you) and autoing them will ensure that I draw minion agro for a moment which causes our side of the lane to push faster -> earlier level 2. Two things can happen at this point: my adc can join me trading with the enemy adc/support or they can push the lane. The result is either they hit level 2 first at much lower than us, or we will hit level 2 first and allow us to shove up. Both relieve all the pressure that would occur during Bard's power lapse between levels 3-5 unless the jungler comes.   Note that some lanes will still win regardless of how well you play the level 1 (annie and naut will often have a lot more pressure on your adc for example).  TL;DR: It's important to start Q on bard in any elo where bot lanes are skilled at punishing weak laning."
bardmains,38cciu,duffercoat,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:03:01 2015 UTC,"Though I agree with the reasoning, and I've only played with him in normals (so far), I've seen everything up to high diamond. It's mostly lvl 2's where people go all in except for the occasional lvl 1 teamfights. I think starting with either Q or W does not make much of a difference since the Meeps give you that extra punch either way.  Other than that, I agree with what you're saying and I play him similarly."
bardmains,38cciu,duffercoat,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:21:56 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that they will necessarily go ham, more that they can. Lots of people don't know bard well enough to play against him appropriately (ie punishing a w start) and because his first hit is so strong they will respect him more than necessary in early lane. However if you come against someone that recognises this, they can start to zone you because you will have no response to their level 1 whether it be a nami heal, thresh hook/flay, naut riptide etc.   I did forget to mention however that because you hit level 2 one minion early (assuming you picked up 2 of the 3 chimes that spawn prelane at 50s and 140s) you can coordinate with a duo if you wish to start w and then rush down the first 5 minions, preventing such a lopsided level 1 (because you get 2 before they do and hence get your disengage if they all in when they hit 2) and still having the early heals."

bardmains,386lps,DEATHinaBLUEtux,4,Tue Jun 2 05:39:56 2015 UTC,"Spellthiefs in my opinion as it gives you that extra trading power allowing you to outdamage the adc early as well as get easy gold from it (2 procs for 1 meep auto is super easy). I recommend changing to nomads when you've got the gold for it after sightstone (around 700g) as talisman is just so much better than frost queens in the long run. You don't need to finish it but I think the movespeed on nomads and the extra gold gen makes it very important to get earlyish if you can.   Note that there are other core items that you need to get though too, and its fine to get them first (boots, aegis against some teams etc)."
bardmains,386lps,duffercoat,2,Tue Jun 2 09:27:34 2015 UTC,"If you're not confident you can dodge skillshots you can start coin I suppose. I personally always go spellthiefs. Even against lanes like leona/blitz, you can still get the poke in while their engage is on cd."

bardmains,37zfcs,Rumhand,3,Sun May 31 18:26:09 2015 UTC,"From my experience.  Bard has good synergy with:   Vayne: you both have a stun that interacts with the environment, makes for some good cc-chaining Sivir: both your ults work as engage/disengage tools, and you double up as insane utility for the rest of your team. Ashe: both your auto-attacks slow enemies, you have standard abilities that apply cc, and you both have ults that stun, pretty much the perma-cc lane. Graves: your ult allows graves to queue up his Q+R for that easy high-burst damage.   Bard has bad synergy with:   Lucian: if you sync your ult with lucian's (which i've done too many times), he's just going to be culling through invulnerable targets. not a good idea. Miss Fortune: same thing with lucian, two of her abilities have long durations which kinda makes it hard for you to land a good ult in between, since MF is all about the DoT damage. Kalista: unless you're building tank, kalista probably shouldn't throw you in the middle of the enemy team.   Bard counters:   Morgana: Same thing with how you counter Zed. If she's ulting your ally, you can ult her (or your ally) to prevent the 2nd damage + stun proc'ing on your ally. Morgana also has very low mobility so it's easy to catch her in your Q. Thresh: your aa-range is longer so you can poke him easily when he's picking up souls. if he hits his hook then pulls himself to you/your adc, he usually puts himself in a position where you can Q-stun him against a wall or your minions. your ult is also good counter to his box. Caitlyn: ""I see you're casting your ult on my ally, would be a shame if I made them invulnerable to it."" Lucian: ""I see you're casting your ult on my ally, would be a shame if I interrupted it.""   Bard is countered by:   Draven: His Spinning Axes are way too strong for you to risk poking him, because he will easily chunk away your HP. You also don't have any shields or reliable healing in your kit, so even if you do manage to catch him out, he'll most likely just kill you before your adc can kill him. Kalista: Like you said, her Martial Pose makes it hard for you to land a Q, plus it's almost impossible to out-run her when she's got you Rended. Don't bother trying to ult her support for the stun, because she'll most likely use her ult to save them. Sona: She out-sustains you thanks to her W and out-pokes you thanks to her Q. Very annoying to deal with during lane phase. Leona: If she's locked you down, you're probably already dead."
bardmains,37zfcs,bardface,2,Sun May 31 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with you with most of these, but disagree on others  Kalista - I've found it really good to be in lane with Kalista, since you are on the same page, you both want to have short trades (at least in early levels) and the auto attack procs do so much damage. I haven't had too much issue with her ult, since I have essentially being building tank - sightstone > lucidity > locket > randuins/FH > etc.  Cait - Really struggle to lane against due to being so far away, hitting Q's is damn hard"
bardmains,37zfcs,DEATHinaBLUEtux,2,Sun May 31 23:28:28 2015 UTC,"With Cait  Try to get early brush control. Your lvl 1 can out dmg alot of supports and if you force an early ward in there brush you know in 1 minute you can control it again/leaves room for jungle pressure later. The brush eases the pain of having lack of range. If you're against a high kill preasure lane (leo, blitz, annie) though just play safe, scale off chimes and team fights.  Beyond that, generally play passive, and make her play aggressive to poke so you can stun, any stun = 3 autos from you and adc. No stun, No trade.  Lastly try to maximize your q with hitting on the aboslute edges of minions. I did around 10 co-op vs ai games to get used to minon hit boxes with my Q hit box, which is suprisingly wide."

bardmains,37zfcs,Isredel,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:42:30 2015 UTC,"Excellent writeup, thanks!   I was aware of a few of these just through practice (Bard/Graves is a lot of fun), but hadn't thought of or played against a lot of these. Bookmarking the hell out of this.  I will say, however, that I disagree on the Kallista synergy.   Like /u/bardface has noted, they really have a lot in common in lane. He gives her sustain, and between meeps and her W passive you can trade really effectively. Since I think the default build now is ""tank-ish support"" (locket, RG,Randuins/FH, etc), I haven't had a huge issue with her ult. Gets you in prime position to land a stun, and just be super annoying (speed boost kallista, meeps).   Suppose it depends on build, though. If you build more AP (Ludens/IBG Bard is fun) or squishier items (crucible, etc), I could see diving into the enemy team being a terrible idea.  EDIT: I've had some luck against Leona by just going hard in the paint and poking her down. That's probably more of a bronze thing, and it depends a LOT on who her adc is. Leona+Graves/Draven is bad news."
bardmains,37zfcs,duffercoat,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:01:21 2015 UTC,"The Leona thing you mentioned is pretty spot-on.  Her lv 1 (and arguably lv 2) are pretty frickin' weak.  Even if you're playing Sona (who she counters), it's all about poking her down before she hits 3.  If you dealt enough damage to her before 3, keep poking her so she's dissuaded from engaging on you (or will die for trying)."
bardmains,37zfcs,digidevil4,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:50:05 2015 UTC,I would add Nami to champs Bard is countered by. Nami has similar level 1 trading (Bard's first strength) denying you any advantage from level 1 and also has superior sustain. It's probably close to a skill match up just because it comes down to how the cc spells are used (her q versus your q) but in lane nami is a counter.   Caitlyn is also definitely a lane counter to bard. A good cait won't let you get anywhere near her without being poked down which prevents from stuns unless you get them through minions perfectly.  I also disagree on no synergy with lucian - lucian bard works incredibly well in early laning through the power of their trading. If you can get a stun then lucian has a lot of damage he can follow up with - similar to graves. Just because the ult doesn't work together doesnt make them not synergise - it would be like saying graves and bard don't go together because you cant collateral damage an ulted target - you just have to play around it.

bardmains,37zqza,DEATHinaBLUEtux,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:35:37 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to work on my Bard jungle. Very slow start with difficult early ganks and a weakness to invades. Clear speed ramps up quickly, and his pick / flank potential is almost unmatched. The utility he provides late game with maneuvering, excess slows, and his ult is crazy of course, but he also has great damage output if you can position well and not get jumped on. Always remains squishy.  I've been trying to build him AD on hit, though I would like to try an AP spell effect build at some point."
bardmains,37zqza,solthas,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:58:11 2015 UTC,"He benefits from attack speed more then any other champions I have seen. Build him with Runaans, Bork, Black Cleaver, Nash tooth."
bardmains,37zqza,Balazi,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:16:59 2015 UTC,"I play AP bard often, so I can vouch for that.  AP Bard is underrated, and I believe it requires more skill than your typical tank Bard. You are a whole lot more squishier than everyone in the game, but if you land a snare on their mid or adc, there is a good chance you can kill them. Also, when it comes to lane phase, the damage spike Bard has during trades can mean the difference between getting a double kill or getting doubled. The heal shrines can also help, but that's more of a late game scaling which makes it fall off anyways.  Personally, I dislike tank bard due to my style of play. I just don't see the value as being a tank when most of the time you should be peeling for your adc. I find more benefit in dealing good damage to the tank who dived my carry to get a faster kill than just ""tanking"" it. I also find it easier to land stuns in a less cluttered environment, which typically tends to be where my adc is.   I think unconventional builds really depend on the persons playstyle, as I am more aggressive with most of my champs, and I prefer carrying by killing rather than being the tank that sits there while my carry does the killing for me.   As for other Bard builds, adc could work if you are REALLY good at last hitting and can hit your stuns most of the time. As for jungle, I would assume a tanky build would be necessary to be viable, since Bard is quite squishy early with no real damage other than his q, but I have yet to try and/or see it for myself  A bit or a long post, but I'm sure it would be of help"
bardmains,37zqza,SeishinKitsune,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:12:39 2015 UTC,"As an ADC, he would lose all 1v1s and has no wave-clear to shove to tower or deal with a Sivir or Corki"
bardmains,37zqza,DayZFusion,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:23:36 2015 UTC,"Bards tend to go tanky because tank items just flat out have more useful stats, passives,  and actives for Bard than most AP items.  While AP is nice, the ADC's sustained damage is just more reliable at killing the tank if you peel well enough (which tank items make pretty easy).  Also your peel has subpar range.  You can't peel if you're dead.  Another problem is that Bard, like all supports, really needs CDR, which either a lot AP items lack, or are paired with mana regen, which is an absolute garbage stat on Bard.  AP items also tend to be rather expensive."
bardmains,37zqza,Isredel,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:22:55 2015 UTC,"Yup, I never said tank bard was bad, i just don't do it because of how i play. In my experience, teammates will either lack the attention to peel for the adc, or my carry lacks knowledge of positioning (sometimes, we get stomped in lane and she is made useless until 40 minutes). With these kinds of scenarios, I personally have a hard time carrying as a tank, since my team can be unreliable at times and I like having direct control of the game through killing power. I feel like AP bard is a good choice if you are skilled enough to consistently hit your q, as well as being ahead in lane overall. If you are behind however, then tank bard is the only option since you wont be able to ""scale"" with ap fast enough, though at that point its normally not just my lane that lost, its all the others."

bardmains,37vhw5,SUGOI_SLAM_JAM,2,Sat May 30 19:11:58 2015 UTC,"All the time when I'm in my own jungle. You can use your ult onto enemy carries in the middle of the fight to prevent them from doing damage / force them to walk out of the fight. Try using your W to help your carries re-position with the speed buff or help your initiators close distance. This really depends on a game by game basis, depending on teamcomps and powerspikes, the only semi decent advice I can give you here is ward and try to make safe catches."
bardmains,37vhw5,euw_Unfortunate,2,Sat May 30 22:54:16 2015 UTC,As a support all you can do when your team is losing is keep vision up and look for picks or good counter engages. Try to keep flash timers and focus on drags and towers.
bardmains,37vhw5,Zao_SC,1 point,Sun May 31 02:08:39 2015 UTC,"It's generally not that easy, it heavily depends on whether you outscale the enemy comp, and you should probably not contest dragons but try to trade other objectives for it."

To be honest I would rather have Thresh than Bard if I was on the backfoot"
bardmains,37vhw5,thijsbruin,1 point,Sun May 31 14:16:29 2015 UTC,"I always find myself using magical journey early to mid game. It costs 30 mana im pretty sure and what this effectively does is speeds you up through the jungle while your adc is farming. If you are not using it leaving lane is much harder as you can only leave your adc for aslong as its a 1v1 or when he can win the lane by himself and he will not be in lane 1v1 for a long time so you need to make the time count. For teamfights its not just a situational ult and stun. I run max cd so your cooldown is looking to be around 4.2 seconds while it lasts for 1.8 seconds. If you practice positioning and when to toss out your stun, its like having a 4.2 second lux q. With your ult you want to make sure you are using it correctly because you can very easily lose yourself the fight. A good time to use it for a nee bard player is at the beginning and end of a teamfight. At the beginning if one of your teammates gets caught out you can ult him + the enemy and use journey to get your team there. Or you see over by wolves amumu wants to grab it to get the extra vision but you being a good support warded their jungle so now you caught out their mumu to make it a 5v4. Keep practicing, i think i have over 120 games and i can safely say i do not know everything yet, so keep at it!"

bardmains,37tejm,bluesharpies,2,Sat May 30 23:02:00 2015 UTC,"You're right. I tried to explain this in the first picture, where the second projectile will calculate if there is any terrain that it can interact with, and if it can, then it will place the mark on the wall. Since the game can't guarantee that another enemy will interrupt the path, it displays the mark even if the Q binds two enemies instead."

bardmains,37tejm,thijsbruin,2,Sun May 31 14:23:47 2015 UTC,"It seems that this projectile isn't a line as many may think but actually more cone shaped from the target, with the cone centered on the line the original Q made. I'm unsure of the total angle of projection of the cone, or of its length. The travel time of the cone seems to be at the same speed as the original. This would explain the 'bending' you are asking about."
bardmains,37tejm,Dynoglory,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:16:41 2015 UTC,"It just travels in a straight line, and if there was already terrain there then it will stun against the wall. It doesn't deviate from the straight path in any way, and if an enemy comes in contact with it, it will just bind the two enemies instead. There is no priority in what it chooses. As for the range, size and travel time, I'll have to get back to you on that."
bardmains,37tejm,crdotx,3,Sun May 31 14:29:21 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I dont know about the straight line though, it really feels like it slightly bends towards terrain, its either that or it just looks like that because I hit a target first, it moves a slight distance, and I hit something along the same path, and the visuals make it look like it bends (which is most likely the case)"

bardmains,37lny9,AlphaWolfSniper,3,Thu May 28 15:30:12 2015 UTC,I'd probably only buy it if I plan to go passive in lane (e.g. when poking with Meeps is going to be too dangerous).

bardmains,37lny9,DragonHeretic,2,Thu May 28 15:35:25 2015 UTC,"Bard's meeps already give phenomenal harass as long as you're willing to get in aa range, so I don't buy spell-thief anyway. Besides which, Building Talisman gives better sustain and movement speed, which Bard likes very much. The way I see it, the longer Bard can stay out there, the more often he can use his utilities. The gold gain from the Talisman is better too, in my opinion."

So why not make him even better at it, while also getting superior gold generation? He has a lot of indirect power via the rest of his kit, but his harass game is surprisingly effective. It's also very good income (better than coin, but not as good as perfectly procced relic shield, iirc) for doing what Bard should honestly already be doing. Establishing lane dominance makes chime hunting much easier, which provides good (if unreliable) mana sustain.  With the buffs, I would maybe consider coin in a more passive lane, or swapping lategame for allll the movespeed with righteous glory.  End of the day it's personal preference, of course."
bardmains,37lny9,Scorpia088,2,Fri May 29 04:28:02 2015 UTC,"i'd say that u should get coin against lanes where u can't poke at all, for example vs a caitlyn"

bardmains,37j043,Malflol,1 point,Thu May 28 01:28:31 2015 UTC,"See, for me, as Bard I prefer utility over solid damage. Bard doesn't really ""do"" damage, and I have a philosophy of pushing hard in a single direction, to be the ""best"" in that direction. So, Bard, for example, I go for really high movement speed, and tons of health. His utility works well for just that - utility. I don't ever try to one versus one unless I'm in a very silly mood. That's really not Bard's scene. Even with Challenging Smite, I feel like he'd still die more often than win, just because his dps and burst are both so pitiful. Chilling Smite on the other hand reduces enemy mobility, making them easier to catch - or run away from, if you have to."

bardmains,37futi,Silestrio,6,Wed May 27 09:27:08 2015 UTC,"His kit offers so much outplay potential it's crazy.  Q - Landing the stun on two champion is just so satisfying. People still don't seem to understand that if you hit the first target at max range, it will have more range for the second target/wall stun which is great for people standing close to their minions.   W - The most boring part of his kit. Using W gives small speed boost which is often good enough paired with a Q slow to get away from a chase.   E - The most magical of journeys is part of what makes Bard so great. Paired with his passive of picking up chimes, it offers so much mobility to roam to other lanes. It is also super easy to run away by landing an easy Q stun when the one even two enemies champions decide to go on a magical journey with you. As soon as they are about to come out, throw out your Q and it's an automatic stun. Open a portal from the river to your turret, and anyone dumb enough to follow you gets stunned to the wall and most likely dies; Great times.  R - Initiate, initiate, initiate!! This is where all the failed videos you see are from, the gawd damn ult. The thing allows you to stop time for a few seconds, get your team positioned and engage. If you don't want to be the one to initiate, hold on to it to escape/chase, don't use it mid fight unless you are completely sure what you are doing.  As a Thresh main-ish, I cannot recommend Bard enough! Give him a try."

bardmains,37dchn,LordHanker,2,Wed May 27 07:22:03 2015 UTC,Champions like Leona or blitz can be hell if you let them engage - the key to winning is to aggress hard from level 1 and don't give them a moments rest. if you can keep them around half health they'll be hesitant to engage and you can whittle them down - they are melee and lack sustain after all.  I personally hate Sona and nami for their annoying sustain and poke - I have to waste mana on shrines instead of Qs  also Janna caitlyn lane because it's the most boring lane in existence
bardmains,37dchn,LOLZlata,2,Tue May 26 20:19:53 2015 UTC,"ive actually had some decent success against leona, if she all ins your adc, it's pretty easy to stun her; most of the time she is out of minion range and/or near wall"
bardmains,37dchn,AlphaWolfSniper,3,Tue May 26 20:27:37 2015 UTC,I've been able to deal with her but there's always a risk if you roam that your adc is dead meat so it limits your roam potential as there are fewer safe chances to leave your adc
bardmains,37dchn,LOLZlata,1 point,Tue May 26 20:28:53 2015 UTC,Agreed. Lanes like that are so painful that i rather run up mid and try to get a kill on the enemy mid if the jungler wont/cant come bot

Though your teamfighting is better if you can isolate the enemy team with your ultimate  before morg's stun goes off. Still a   My favourite match-ups are:  Thresh, because it's purely skill match-up  Janna, because baiting her shield by cancelling your passive autoattack is way too fun. The autoattack makes a sound even if you cancel it and pretty much all Jannas instinctively use shield on their adc. Then you just back off for a few seconds and wait until the shield is just about to go off (so adc still thinks they have it for a while) and then yo just go ham with Autoattack+passive, Q, auto and back off after. Wins every trade.  Crank is fun to play against too, because once he misses his hook you can just go ham on the adc or blitz. His kit is pretty poop without the hook."

So when trying to land your Q for harass you want to hit them with you auto first and then land the Q which will allow you to get in a few more hits, if they don't heal follow up with another set after getting your meeps back, also make sure to go while they are hitting a creep so they cannot retaliate. then follow up with ignite for a kill or assist to the ADC."

I usually place three heals at bot, poke them around 50% or lower and start to roam mid if I have low kill potential. Hitting Kalista with Q is pretty hard and hitting it into a stun is even harder, so I have a lot of trouble in that matchup. Vladimir is basicly the same like Kalista, it's pretty hard to Q/R him because of his pool and so I'm unable to roam mid."
bardmains,37dchn,Chime_Collector,1 point,Tue May 26 21:24:35 2015 UTC,"Blitzcrank and Thresh both give me trouble, because of their hooks/stuns - but it's not usually because they give ME trouble. Bard has a very strong ability to escape, even early in the game, thanks to his numerous means of slowing his enemies, and speeding himself up. The problem is if your ADC stands there and takes it like a chump. I think that any champ with a hard engage can be trouble for a bot lane with Bard, because of the fact that he cannot peel for his carry."

bardmains,36tjv1,Flotus4,5,Fri May 22 00:24:01 2015 UTC,"What I love about it is it's probably the most versatile ult in the game but also one of the hardest to execute properly. here's some ideas that come to mind (sorry I'm typing this on my phone)   Early on you can use it to hold the enemy in place to set up easy ganks allowing you to land an easier Q. If enemy is trying for dragon or baron you can ult it to pause them giving your team time to get into a favourable position You can initiate a teamfight by ulting the primary target(s) for your team to execute them effectively. Also works well as a disengage tool. In the middle of a teamfight you can ult half the enemy team, thus making a 5v5 a 3v5 so you can focus down the enemy more easily If the enemy has ultimates with a predictable windup time I.e Vladimir, Fizz, Karthus, Zed and so on, your ult can save the target(s) life. Be cautious using your ult for this purpose as often they will die after coming out of stasis anyway and you don't want to have wasted your ultimate Execute tower dives more safely by freezing the turret  Protect your own turret from a siege   And that's just off the top of my head. The amazing bard players (and I wish I was one of them, I try..) can decide in a split second which is the best use of their ult in any given situation and execute it effectively :)  Looking forward to reading other peoples ideas!"
bardmains,36tjv1,LOLZlata,3,Fri May 22 00:57:50 2015 UTC,"In SoloQ - How do you decide when to ult when there are bursty people like LeB, or even tank initiates like Malph/Shyv on YOUR team? I've fucked up a few team fights because just as I ult to keep the enemy in place MY TEAM MATES GO IN. and it's like noooo ;_;   Is the safest bet (in SoloQ) to just wait for your teammates to do their thing first and use it like how you suggested in #4?"
bardmains,36tjv1,pokeylopey,2,Fri May 22 11:11:22 2015 UTC,"If you're unsure then hold it, dont panic and use it because that's where the most mistakes are made (which I've done plenty of times) If I had a Malphite or Amumu or Orianna etc I would communicate with the team - tell them to let you initiate by ulting as many of the enemy team as possible - thus setting up for an easier wombo combo"

I've found I sit on his ult way more than other supports, because impulsive ults mess everything up.   If I see someone to pick, or need disengage, or need to stall an enemy drag attempt, or to split the enemy team (ult the frontline, kill the back and vice versa) or to ult towers when diving, on the other hand..."
bardmains,36tjv1,Rumhand,2,Fri May 22 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"When you aren't in voice comms with your teammates, really try to communicate your intention through pings.  I've found his ult is best at starting fights and catching/delaying people after fights and is very difficult to use in the middle of a fight without causing as much harm as good.  Most people will realize with 3 omw pings from bard before/after a fight that an ult could be coming in and react accordingly. (If you do happen to be in comms though, try some crazy shit just for fun: my favorite is ulting their front line while our Sion uses his ult straight through them onto the back line)  And if you don't get a good look for an ultimate, don't use it. If you lose a fight without using your ultimate, you can use it after re-spawning to protect an objective.  If you win a fight without using your ultimate, you can zone the team out so you can take more objectives.  No reason to force an ultimate when you can't be sure it will be beneficial.  If you are trying to ult a teammate to save them, look for an opportunity put the ult right beside them.  This gives them the option to move into it if they want, but doesn't force anything on them."
bardmains,36tjv1,Salmonhands9,1 point,Fri May 22 14:19:07 2015 UTC,"This is what WizardCrab said about Bard's ulting (he's a Riot staff & D1 player):   ""It's good against wombos and delayed burst moves like yasuo and morg ults. But there's a lot of risk in solo queue of messing up a teammate's plans, or pissing them off because they die anyway and can now blame you for the inevitable death they already had. I find if you're using it defensively it's almost always better to ult the enemy anyway and let your teammate walk away."""

bardmains,36rcpk,crdotx,1 point,Tue May 26 19:58:58 2015 UTC,Please tell me they finally upped his heal or lowered mana cost?
bardmains,36rcpk,Nikolaschr,1 point,Tue May 26 20:36:10 2015 UTC,They buffed the ancient coin line and gave more mana on support masteries so it really helps out bard with his W mana issues.
bardmains,36rcpk,crdotx,1 point,Wed May 27 00:40:51 2015 UTC,The issue is with his W not with mana tho.
bardmains,36rcpk,Nikolaschr,1 point,Wed May 27 13:25:55 2015 UTC,But in lane the increased mana helps for having three heals down and still having mana for other abilities. Early game heal has mana issues (for me at least) so the changes seemed to help
bardmains,36rcpk,crdotx,2,Wed May 27 18:52:31 2015 UTC,"Ok 2 things: 1. Chimes in lane as well as good positioning from you and your ADC will keep these packs down to a 'normal' amount of use and will not drain mana overly fast 2. Its been mentioned before but Bard's heal is CLEARLY either in need of being fixed as it heals the least for the most mana as related to other supports, or that Bard is simply not meant to be a healer. I find next to no mana problems with him in lane, esp if I start heal and back after placing 3 before the first wave, also allowing me time to pick up another health pot, which means the HP packs can be reserved for my ADC and allows me an advantage on the other support in lane."
bardmains,36rcpk,Nikolaschr,1 point,Wed May 27 18:59:36 2015 UTC,But his level one lame presence is too good with q for me to want to give up. I will have to try starting w before I turn it down though.
bardmains,36rcpk,crdotx,2,Wed May 27 19:21:21 2015 UTC,Its fun and if you got your 2 chimes at the start then u should have a quicker lvl 2 by a bit

bardmains,36njr3,euw_Unfortunate,9,Wed May 20 19:57:26 2015 UTC,I hate meta picks He's so unique People underestimate you I love his kit
bardmains,36njr3,LOLZlata,5,Wed May 20 19:31:19 2015 UTC,I play bard to prove that bard is not a troll pick and that he has a lot to offer if played correctly.
bardmains,36njr3,Jaeshuwa,6,Wed May 20 19:01:08 2015 UTC,I play him for the exact same reason. Every time my friends start ragging on a champ like Bard I pick them up and proceed to make an impact. They don't question Bard anymore
bardmains,36njr3,HowThisKilledMe,6,Wed May 20 19:45:07 2015 UTC,"Mostly things like this:   You have low hp.  Enemy champions are chasing you. You use q to stun them. They are still chasing you.

bardmains,36njr3,Salmonhands9,3,Thu May 21 12:03:27 2015 UTC,"I was a smite support main prior to coming back to LOL, in smite the meta requires supports to roam more freely and help other lanes. Bards playstyle lets me do this quite well. He has an in-built advantage in that as a very infrequently played character people dont know how to deal with him. I enjoy changing peoples perceptions of meta. Every good game i change someones mind about bard support. Most impactful ult in the game IMO."

Does a little bit of everything, poke, cc, peel, pick, and has one of the most satisfying ults in the game to use properly.   His shenanigans potential is through the roof. Helping teammates escape through the jungle, Magical Journey bait, zoning/stopping pursuers, etc."

bardmains,36m5uh,FyB4rd,2,Wed May 20 12:08:18 2015 UTC,"While I've always shared the same thoughts as WizardCrab with Bard's ulting and chime-collecting, I was surprised to see he was very opposed to the idea of grabbing W at Level 1.  I've always assumed the early heal/ms would be far more useful than a linear-skillshot cc that's rather easy to miss. I've always picked W at Lvl 1 so I can leave a shrine or two in an ally's lane/jungle before the match starts. Meeps have always felt sufficient enough for me at Lvl 1 to deal some early-poke/damage."
bardmains,36m5uh,Rumhand,1 point,Wed May 20 12:18:02 2015 UTC,"It depends really, I've stopped going for the shrines for the allies (unless one request it specifically in a hard matchup) but if my jungler is something like wukong that lose a lot of health early AND/OR if the ennemy is likely to invade him I'll drop the 3 shrines for him.   Otherwise I just take Q for the lvl 1, because W is a very weak spell in skirmishes/trades (it s basically half a health pot, 70 hp vs 150, 10 sec delay instead of 15) and your lvl 2 will be weaker than almost any lane if you get ""all-in""ed."
bardmains,36m5uh,LOLZlata,1 point,Wed May 20 15:44:19 2015 UTC,"His early harass potential is surprisingly strong, unless you're against like, Cait/Nami. If you land a Q stun and your adc is awake, you're going to put some hurt on. It's also your peel, which is useful versus more aggressive lanes.   Could just be a play style/preference thing. I like the aggressive harass game, and I'm used to having only one non-ult form of peel (I used to play a lot of Zyra)."

To be fair, when you advertise a champion as a strong roamer people's first reaction is unlikely to be ""I bet he'll have a great level 1."" He is definitely different enough that most people are going to misplay him at first."
bardmains,36m5uh,digidevil4,1 point,Wed May 20 12:23:38 2015 UTC,"This is basically how i have been playing Bard since his release, only leaving lane if it does not hinder my ADC and almost always grabbing Q level 1."

bardmains,36id7i,AlphaWolfSniper,1 point,Wed May 20 00:26:03 2015 UTC,"Could be great.  But I think it just needs some sort of buff at all.  Bard is my favorite champ, but even though they add a buff here and there, he's just way too hard to make plays with or be a valuable member of the team.  When a champion is named the 'worst' or 'a 4 v 6' champion, you know he needs some work."
bardmains,36id7i,I_RARELY_RAPE_PEOPLE,6,Wed May 20 03:53:57 2015 UTC,"I highly disagree with this statement. The only reason people say these things about Bard are because A: They are ignorant. or B: They have only ever seen bad Bard players who picked him up on release and never played him again.  Bard is one amazing character once you take the time to learn him. It took me about 6 games to truly get the hang of him, but after that it was all smooth sailing. Now Bard is one of my higher success champions. It also helps that people do not see him often and therefore they do things they obviously should not do. (Like follow a Bard into his E, only to get wall stunned on the way out.)  I think Bard is perfectly balanced as is, not to mention that because he pseudo-infinitely scales, he is arguably the best late game support in the game."

bardmains,36erzt,DayZFusion,2,Tue May 19 06:37:34 2015 UTC,"More Mana at level 1, more out of combat move speed(the mastery at the end of the tree), lower cooldowns on active items, and +20 more exp while near a higher leveled ally(2 points in this mastery)  better mana more using active items and more exp(don't know if i will start taking Inspiration because of this change, will have to see on the PBE)"

bardmains,36dz3y,digidevil4,3,Mon May 18 17:09:31 2015 UTC,Maybe not everyone uses champselect but personally I use it constantly when picking my support or vice versa.
bardmains,36dz3y,AlphaWolfSniper,2,Mon May 18 17:10:18 2015 UTC,"Not a bad idea, I'll talk to my adc duo partner /u/LordHanker and ask who he thinks bard goes well with and give my two cents"
bardmains,36dz3y,LordHanker,3,Mon May 18 20:14:09 2015 UTC,"Hmmm good question! I really like the bard vayne combo as I think they really synergizes well. When /u/alphawolfsniper is my sup partner I know that he loves to go roam and grab those chimer dawgs, so I know that as vayne I can solo farm pretty well and stay safe under tower. Also, someone like kog is great because i can long range poke and we can use the poke from bard and kog and just eventually use bard ult offensively and all in. In the end, honestly, every adc can work, but communication is the key. Make sure as bard you let the adc know you are just poking or you are trying to go in. Ping that you are going to get chimes and let the adc know when you are going to use ult and such. I promise that will lead to a much more successful lane."
bardmains,36dz3y,Gravy007,2,Mon May 18 20:18:56 2015 UTC,Personally I would say bard goes even with Leona because you can usually get a stun off if she engages through minions. He has strong synergy with vayne for obvious reasons and also any adc who can hold their own 2vs1.  Pretty strong against any adc without a dash.
bardmains,36dz3y,kalsuu,1 point,Mon May 18 21:27:38 2015 UTC,"Bard has insanely good synergy with Nunu.  They can both give each other increased MS, and they can chain their slows/stuns.  Their ults can make for perfect plays. If Bard can ult 4 or 5 on the enemy team, the stun duration can give Nunu enough time to stand in between them and channel his full ult for a clean quadra/penta-kill."

bardmains,36bi9r,LOLZlata,1 point,Mon May 18 01:20:46 2015 UTC,"I have learned that playing with a kalista is great due to the kiting potential. In lane I level QWQE and max Q then E. Mid-late game place your heals just for movespeed. Any time you land a stun on the adc, you can poke them to low hp or get a kill. I have had success with both ignite and exhaust so you can do whatever you prefer. Also learn how to bait and make outplays with your E, if you get 'caught' then have a journey to nearby allies it works almost every time. Good luck and hope you find success in climbing with bard!"
bardmains,36bi9r,__pm_me_your_puns__,2,Mon May 18 01:46:24 2015 UTC,82% Win Rate?! That's impressive!

bardmains,36a4vy,Stepjamm,2,Sun May 17 17:53:53 2015 UTC,"I do something like this, but I don't place a shrine at Top. Top-laners usually have a Flask or enough Pots to sustain themselves, and they're the least likely to be trading their opponent so frequently. Top-laners also seem to forget they even have a Health Shrine (probably because the lane's so long, and they're lost in their own worlds).  I place 1 in Mid and the other 2 in the Jungle, next to my Jungler's first camp, before recalling back to get Mana. It's better to give more Health Shrines to your Jungler as it'll make their first route much easier, and they might even have enough health to do additional ganks before their first back."
bardmains,36a4vy,LOLZlata,2,Sun May 17 19:37:19 2015 UTC,"If I take health first I'll assess who needs it, for example a fiddle jungle isn't going to need sustain help but a jax who is going up against riven? ill probably drop him 2 packs."

bardmains,36a4vy,euw_Unfortunate,2,Mon May 18 04:59:34 2015 UTC,Merely supplementing your already good point my bard-bro
bardmains,36a4vy,LOLZlata,3,Mon May 18 05:19:19 2015 UTC,Taking heal level one isn't worth losing the lane presence you get from taking Q
bardmains,36a4vy,Zao_SC,1 point,Sun May 17 20:25:37 2015 UTC,I think the Q vs W argument level 1 depends on how much sustain help your laners will need and how vital it is that you have Q for your own lane just in case - if you've collected your three meeps prior to lane starting then you should be hitting 2 first anyways so you are ready with Q for any fights that break out - plus you have your passive for harass at level 1 so you aren't completely useless.
bardmains,369p79,arsixx,2,Sun May 17 15:30:49 2015 UTC,"1 - I usually collect chimes from my own jungle when I'm returning back to lane. Other than that, I will only leave my ADC in lane to collect chimes if a) the lane is pushed up, and b) I've got bot-lane covered in wards. After laning phase, I'll occasionally give myself a minute to go chime-collecting when nothing important is happening.  2 - I tend to use my ult offensively as a gap-closer. If the enemies are running away and are gaining distance from my allies, that's when I'll stun them. I also use it to split up the enemy in team-fights, I'll ult right over them and it'll stun 2-3, leaving the other 2-3 to fight 5 of us. The only time I ult defensively is if I'm ulting myself, because ulting defensively on allies usually puts them off and they'll probably rage at you, lol.   3 - Walk a little further to the edge of the map, then place your range indicator at a slight angle. Just like this"
bardmains,369p79,DayZFusion,2,Sun May 17 16:34:35 2015 UTC,"3 - The fountain is shaped like a bowl. You spawn in the middle of it, so you want to walk to the outer edge of it and then point your portal at an angle towards the lane."
bardmains,369p79,Isredel,1 point,Sun May 17 18:02:10 2015 UTC,"I purposely don't pick up chimes until I need them or I'm backing anyway/returning to lane.  They're the reason why Bard doesn't need mana regen.  When I go oom, if it's safe, I tell my adc to hold on for ten seconds, grab the closet chime or two in the jungle and come back.  I only really do full chime clears if we're insanely winning lane or it hit mid game."
bardmains,368pdx,ClickMyDink,3,Sun May 17 06:33:43 2015 UTC,"get spellthief for lane, and dont upgrade it, and then get tailisman after lane to speed ppl up when you make a pick with your ult."
bardmains,368pdx,Stepjamm,2,Sun May 17 17:27:45 2015 UTC,"i never have mana issues with bard, his chimes and a bit of mana from frozen heart and i'm good all game. the ancient coin is debateable cause the little ap boost is pretty nice for him and roaming through lanes means you get no bonus gold from lane minions"
bardmains,368pdx,Isredel,1 point,Sun May 17 18:01:47 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Mana regen is not a useful stat on bard due to chimes.  Get a Frozen Heart and you're good for the rest of the game.  While Talisman's active is nice, it just doesn't give bard any useful stats.  I would prefer to build a righteous glory for almost the same effect but more useful stats.  (Can't really use it for disengage, but Bard had plenty of that in his kit)."

I've always felt that the Active on Talisman would make it the most useful of Support items for Bard's currently mobile kit, but the Gold Gen on Ancient Coin was never as good as Spellthief's Edge for me to consider it as a build path.  However, with the PBE buffs on the Ancient Coin line (Gold Gen, Mana Regen and Active Cooldowns), I think Bard will finally be viable to use this build path over Spellthief's. What do you think?"

bardmains,367gzh,Malflol,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:59:38 2015 UTC,welcome to the club :) i made it through plat 5 - dia 5 by playing bard 90% of the time:  http://imgur.com/c924sGw  WellTemperedFate (EUW) :)
bardmains,368e3z,LOLZlata,4,Sun May 17 04:05:26 2015 UTC,Spellthief's edge is almost always better as a support. You don't kill any minions so you don't get the passive hp and mana back. And you get 2 procs of spellthief everytime you auto attack (+passive meep attack) so that's 23 gold or so with Bandit mastery - more than 1 cs. You don't need HP from the ring because you should have armor runes and use your healing shrines. Remember that more armor and MR runes means that your pots and shrines are more effective because it is harder for the opponent to whittle down that 70 HP you get from each shrine.
bardmains,368e3z,DayZFusion,2,Sun May 17 05:52:32 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'd like to advise you Doran's shield start if you want some early tankyness. Doran's Ring stats are kinda wasted on bard : in general i really dislike AP on bard, the mana regen is overkill with your passive, you won't kill any minions...   Whereas Doran's shield is a great ""one item wonder"", makes you way more resilient to all-ins botlane, gives good sustain too... With it you can outtrade the ennemy adc even when only trading aa. Ruby crystal for a SS rush is possible too if you don't want to start with a GP5.  If we compare Spellthief and Doran's Ring, Spellthief is the better item almost 100% of the time : the 10 ap less are more than made up by the gp5 and the proc, which gives 5 bonus dmg ( ~exactly the same amount a ring would give to his spells, minus the gold). And you gain 2 extra pots to make up for the 60 HP.  Also, welcome on the subreddit ! I hope Bard will give you as much fun as it does to me :D"
