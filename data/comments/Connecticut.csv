Connecticut,3e3zta,smackrock,3,Tue Jul 21 22:43:05 2015 UTC,50 feet? You're kidding right?
Connecticut,3e3zta,Guitarknowitall,-2,Tue Jul 21 22:49:53 2015 UTC,"It was an arbitrary number, as I clarified. But do you have an answer as to why theres no regulations over these? Probably not is my guess."
Connecticut,3e3zta,smackrock,3,Tue Jul 21 22:54:53 2015 UTC,"There actually are regulations setup by the FAA. I'm on my phone but generally they have off limit locations, like a 15 mile radius around DC and you cant fly near stadiums. I think the current attitude restriction is 1000ft but it's impossible to enforce effectively though most drones cannot go anywhere close to that height anyways. There was a proposal to limit that to 500ft which is still reasonable but I don't know the status of that. 50 ft is not reasonable, and would be even harder to enforce."

Connecticut,3e3zta,Spooky2000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:45:24 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what altitude is technically qualified as government/commercial airspace but I imagine there should be some kind of restriction designed to keep drones well below that to avoid trouble with low flying aircraft/wind patterns. Problem is if you live in a suburb filled with angry helicopter moms (no pun intended) wielding iPhones with their local police department on speed dial then you're causing trouble with them if you're flying low enough for them to notice.
Connecticut,3e3zta,Guitarknowitall,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:54:09 2015 UTC,https://www.faa.gov/uas/  Keep ignoring it...  All airspace is FAA regulated.

Connecticut,3e3pzz,Yum_Kaax,4,Tue Jul 21 19:33:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not defending the deal, but that's a very short-sighted idea.  This way, the state (in theory) pays $20 million for 200 (presumably) high-paying jobs, which lead to both direct (income tax) and indirect (hypothetical economic boosts leading to other tax revenue) sources of long-term income for the state. It's a one-time investment, and it's on GE to continue to pay the costs (income, benefits, etc.) of maintaining those 200 jobs. If the state were to hire them, that would be 200 jobs worth of income to pay annually, plus healthcare, pensions, and other benefits.   In reality, who knows how this will play out and whether the state will actually see any long-term revenue gains from this. But in general these deals are about the long term.  (Of course, it's just as much about short-term political gains as it is about anything else. But politicians do everything for political gain, so that should be a given in these discussions.)"

I know of multiple people who drive into the city instead of take the train because they feel that the cost (and hassle) is less than taking the train.    Expanding the number of lanes on the Merritt, at least IMHO, is basically a pipe-dream.  There has been enormous local opposition to it for 70 years, and even if there was the political will, there isn't the money, either from the state or the feds.  Fixing the i-84/rt 8 interchange in Waterbury and the ""aetna viaduct"" in Hartford alone will cost several billion that the state doesn't have a funding source for yet.  The state has already been investing money to make the shoulders wider and easier to pull of in case of accident or break-down.  Expanding I-95 might be possible, but it will cost a fortune.

The fares for Metro-North are pretty steep, relative to the ""free"" trip on 95 or 15.   Adding a ""congestion pricing"" toll, (ie: just during rush hours) would help give a push to those who are able to either drive at a different time of day, or use public transit, and would speed the commute for those who continued to use the highway."
Connecticut,3e0ti3,mas90guru,3,Tue Jul 21 02:12:42 2015 UTC,"WalletHub conducted a study to answer that question across the county.   It used four factors to come up with a ranking of all 50 states:  Return on Taxes Paid to the Federal Government Federal Funding as a Percentage of State Revenue Number of Federal Employees per 1,000 Residents Number of Civilian Non-Defense Federal Employees per 1,000 Residents  Connecticut came in at No. 7, with No. 1 being the least dependent and No. 50 being the most. Massachusetts was right behind Connecticut at No. 8. New York was No. 20."
Connecticut,3e0ti3,76before84,4,Tue Jul 21 02:13:47 2015 UTC,I never understood these statistics.  So it's based on the number of federal employees working / living in the state.  How does that make a state dependent and how does that take into consideration the feds needs.

For all the bitching people do about our public sector, that's a testament to their success at securing federal funding for our state. Compared to our neighbors (NY 0.58, MA 0.74, RI 0.75, NJ 0.48) we're doing quite well in that category.  That's not to imply that our state government couldn't benefit from improvement. This Taxpayer ROI Study by WalletHub ranks us at 33 overall, and if you reach into the methodology, infrastructure is the primary cause.  I expected to see a correlation between state dependence on federal dollars and overall taxpayer ROI, but instead it appears that state governments extremely dependent on federal funds (such as SC, which gobbles $5.38 for every dollar it coughs up) aren't necessarily any better off for it."

What I mean is this view / mentality about what does the federal government provide in terms of money and revenue is a crappy way to see things.  They are trying to point out that for every dollar we get tax then it gets back to the state through legitimate reasons and pork barrel spending.  With this view how do you ween out the bullshit expenses?  Not all states are also equal in terms of expenditure by the federal government all the times.   What I am trying to say is we are too focused on getting something back from the government than what is the government doing and is it best for what we need.

You make a valid point, but I don't think investigating BOP necessarily inhibits that further investigation. On the contrary, I think it can be a good jumping off point. To me, investigating BOP is helpful in the same way that investigating a company's simplified balance sheet is helpful. Both provide a broad synopsis that is useful in discovering trends, which can then be further investigated to find the answers to the questions you're asking."

Schools, laws schools in particular, place a disproportionate emphasis on an applicant's GPA/Entrance exam. An increase of even a point or two on the LSAT has humongous implications for your admissions chances and the sort of scholarship package they'll offer you.   An investment of $1-2k could easily translate into a generous scholarship or be the difference between whether or not you make it into a reach."

Most companies either give a fixed set of sick days or they are flexible as long as you don't abuse it.  CT is an at-will work state, meaning employers can pretty much fire you for any reason, but that might not prevent you from filing a lawsuit anyway.  My advice is to be straight with your employer and hash it out now."

I looked at homes in Hartford, and I would have had to live in some iffy neighborhoods to have afforded anything even ""livable"". I have some friends who went that route with a three-family...and they're regretting the decision.   2) The busway. For all the hate people give it, it's pretty awesome, and it's literally funneling money into downtown New Britain, a place that could desperately use a surge of interest and capital.  3) New Britain is a working-class city for people who'd rather roll up their sleeves and fix their own problems. It reminds me a LOT of Detroit, in both the good and the bad ways. It's broke, there's plenty of gov't dysfunction and urban blight, but there's a whole group of us young people who can see what New Britain can be.  West Hartford? Hartford? Those places are already established, there's big money and corporate interests at play there. But New Britain is a blank slate in a lot of ways. You can open a business here for a lot less money than downtown Hartford or WeHa, you can take chances, you don't have to be rich or well-connected.  I dunno. I fucking love New Britain. It's not perfect, I have plenty of complaints too...but my wife and I literally drove across the country looking for places to live, and at the end of the day, New Britain called to us like nowhere else."
Connecticut,3duio9,harshcougar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:28:55 2015 UTC,"All great points! In general, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a millennial/Gen X'er who would choose NB over WH. Sounds like it's a great place to be an entrepreneur though!"
Connecticut,3duio9,FLOCKA,2,Mon Jul 20 14:06:50 2015 UTC,"Young people want to live in Downtown Hartford?  I would much rather live in New Britain, and I'm sure it will be much more affordable than West Hartford.  Young people (especially CCSU grads) who work in Hartford might find this really appealing.  I know I would have.  Especially walking distance to the bus!"

Connecticut,3dvw5t,ale9,5,Sun Jul 19 23:39:43 2015 UTC,"Near CCSU isnt bad, some drunk college kids might tip your bins though come september"
Connecticut,3dvw5t,Cheebi,3,Sun Jul 19 23:49:27 2015 UTC,The areas RIGHT off campus are where bins get tipped. Lived right next to campus for 2 years. Our bins were tipped every Thursday night. There's usually a drove of college kids that all walk around together at some point (20-30 people in one group) and there's always these two douchebag kids that tip them over. Same two kids every time.
Connecticut,3dvw5t,dave_takes_phots,0,Mon Jul 20 00:49:18 2015 UTC,Francis street across from CCSU is really nice. That's the street my girlfriend grew up on. Commonwealth is nice too.
Connecticut,3dvw5t,Fastnacht,5,Mon Jul 20 02:27:23 2015 UTC,"I live in the area between the West Farms Mall and CCSU/Belvedere neighborhood. It is a great, safe, affordable area with easy access to parks, shopping, and the UCONN Health Center.   I can literally throw rocks into Farmington, and my house cost 1/3 the price an equivalent place would have cost across the border. We paid just over $100k for a fixer-upper (really just needed a good scrubbing, appliances, and a bathroom reno), though even a move-in ready home in this area is only going for between 130k and 150k.   Most of the ""bad"" parts of New Britain are just outside of downtown, but the further towards the border areas you get, the better it is. That said, give downtown New Britain another decade, and I think it's gonna be a much, much better place.   The only thing we need are more young people. My wife and I are the youngest homeowners on our street by at least a couple of decades...my ""back"" neighbor is literally almost 90."

Connecticut,3ds11r,dakatabri,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:25:48 2015 UTC,"In this particular case it was ICE dropping the ball, but CT has the same policies in place that resulted in Stenle's murder.  BTW they found some body parts by the train tracks in New Haven a few days ago which look to be MS-13 related. This violent and racist Central American gang does have a presence in CT, but authorities are content keeping the public unaware of their presence within their community, since it aims to offer these people ""sanctuary"" after all."

Connecticut,3ds11r,Guy_Buttersnaps,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:48:57 2015 UTC,Because deciding who to give a license to and deciding who gets kicked out of the county are two separate things decided by two separate government bodies.

Connecticut,3domys,who-you,2,Sat Jul 18 17:15:08 2015 UTC,"Dude, it was never a competitive school to get into. Various schools and programs, particularly PT and OT and of course the law school were a bit tougher than some, but it wasn't exactly rocket science to get in. They haven't lowered anything, actually things have become a bit tougher over the years with escalating standards with the increased applicant pool -- at least until recently. Now I think the applicant pools will be shrinking due to demographics (lower birth rate = less students to apply starting this year) and overextension of student loans and people realizing that a $48K a year QU education isn't going to give them the leg up they need to pay it back, so maybe it will get easier again, who knows?!?!

I live on a really quiet suburb on the edge of town near Bethel & Redding, people would be pissed if that happened in my area.  I would be pissed and I'm 24, simply because when I was in college and in a fraternity that threw parties regularly we would take measures to prevent disrupting our neighbors, such as give them warning, make sure the party didn't get crazy as hell,  put up sound dampeners on our windows and keep the noise down, make sure that people didn't go outside, etc.   Don't pretend that these people should get away with this shit because they're ""college"" students and the homeowners around them should know better. There's a way to throw parties without being a shithead to your neighbors. Most college students don't give a fuck and that's really the issue here. I understand the leniency that goes with living in a college town and I know that our neighbors sometimes didn't enjoy living next to us, and we tried to make it up to them the best we could (free labor) but this party is pretty much over the line"

Those kids are shitty and just because they're college kids doesn't mean that people should tolerate their bullshit because they live in a college town.  I mean seriously I've seen sophomores in my kitchen betting on licking an electric fly zapper at one point.

Because of this college traffic is horrible, great neighborhoods are going to crap and whole bunch of other shit.  There are not enough cops working in this town to keep up with this bull shit. On a Friday and Saturday night there are on 6 or 7 cops working from 11pm to 7am. So you have the north end of town going to shit because of this college and the south end of town has New Haven creeping in. The north end use to be a great end of town but is going to shit because of these college kids."
Connecticut,3domys,who-you,4,Sat Jul 18 06:12:30 2015 UTC,The only person I'll have sympathy for is someone who's been in the same house for 50 years. Otherwise it doesn't matter
Connecticut,3domys,slapknuts,2,Sat Jul 18 16:15:47 2015 UTC,"Two sides to this.  College kids party, yes.  You can have 20-30 people over and not make too much noise.  You shouldn't have 200 people over in a neighborhood of regular adults.  If you want to have these huge parties live in an area that is strictly college students, it's not hard.  I'd be pissed if some college kids moved in on my street and started throwing parties on a Wednesday, lighting off fireworks and things."

I think you'll find a desk/chair along that way.  Honestly, there are probably close to a dozen furniture stores along a 2 mile stretch along Boston Post Road (counting places like Big Lots). A few are going out of business, and MIGHT be able to cut you a bigger deal. Modern Furniture is definitely going out of business.

I've often seen large groups of visitors--general public, adults, kids, etc. There's something weird about your anecdote. Just about every staff member there is pretty easygoing and genuinely nice as long as the visitor(s) aren't just being a nuisance. I'm skeptical that you got kicked out of the YUAG because you pointed at a painting from five feet away.  It doesn't happen at the Met/MoMA/Louvre and it isn't about to happen at the YUAG."

Your anecdote is a bizarre one in any context, forget about a university museum (which is typically more relaxed than many other prominent institutions). This is the internet. Of course I'm going to be skeptical. Your last sentence is a completely bizarre, irrelevant attack on an entire subset of the Yale community. I don't even know--and honestly don't care to--what might motivate such sentiments. I'm just tired of New Haven townies acting this way and then having the audacity to criticize Yalies for giving them the cold shoulder."

You have me pegged in your little world of in/out. And I don't fit into your little pegged world, and you can't figure out where else I may possibly fit. So instead of taking me at my word that I was kicked out of the museum for pointing at a painting from 5 feet away by a docent who didn't know what she was doing, you attack me. You attack the very idea that I may be telling the truth. And you don't even know me. So I'm done now. Go live in your little binary world of in/out. Forget there may be something outside of that. I'm done."
