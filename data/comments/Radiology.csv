I was called up to a GI room to take over for another tech running a C-Arm for a colon stent placement this one time.  Normally I grab whatever lead shielding is available but that day I decided to find my own which took a few minutes.  As I got up there, I saw people bursting out of the GI suite and then the smell hit me like a freight train.  I tried double masking but it barely helped.  Peeking inside, I saw a large puddle of melted chocolate and beef stew.  The stent had released everything that collected behind the blockage and emptied all over the exam stretcher and the floor.    If I came any earlier, it would have been me.  Luckily, the other tech was not caught in the crossfire and our C-Arm only suffered a feces covered foot switch.    Edit: finger smashed submit too early."

He came in for an AAS and the peg tube kept popping in and out, leaking bile/other fluids. While doing the exam I kept having to move his hand out of the field, he'd keep trying to play with it and pull it out. It was a complete mess. The fluid itself and the peg tube doesn't bother me but the fact that he was just yanking on it and messing with it so roughly was really getting to me."

Radiology,3e4jv1,antjp012,2,Tue Jul 21 23:02:04 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about vomit you better over come it quickly. It doesn't happen with every patient or even the majority of patients, but it will happen. I have yet to have a patient actually throw up on me because I'm quick and learn to watch for signs. I also work in a cancer hospital where most of the patients are throwing up because of chemo.   You are going to come into contact with blood, vomit, urine, feces, spit, snot, puss, Maybe not everyday but expect it. You are working with sick patients that's why they are in the hospital."
Radiology,3e4jv1,vaporking23,2,Tue Jul 21 23:06:58 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I used to feel somewhat the same way about vomit. I had a pretty strong sympathetic gag, and it provided a minor amount of concern going into medicine.   But with most things, you get over it eventually. For the most part...  All that said, I'd be willing to bet they cover vomiting because it is an accreditation mandate that it has to be emphasized. Because although in most patients they'll be fine, vomiting does instantly create an airway concern.  Anecdotally, in paramedic school we had a massive amount of emphasis on anaphylaxis for much the same reasons. And which such emphasis you almost expect to get out there and have it happening multiple times daily, which isn't the case at all.  Most of the time for my ER, the patient has been medicated, including anti-emetics, and is at least reasonably stable when going to radiology. I've never had a single one of my patients vomit during general diagnostic imaging. And the patients that vomit in CT have all been extremely critical head injuries. And when that acuity of patient is in CT there is a full compliment of staff with them, and all CT staff do is their magic behind the desk."

You are taking care of sick people and some of them will be vomiting, bleeding, have oozing wounds, have urine and/or feces on them, just smell bad in general, or have body parts pointing the wrong direction.   Not saying this will be every patient you have, or that you will hardly see this stuff, but it will probably be in the mix depending on where you work. If you work in an outpatient facility you may not see anyone vomit, but if you work in a hospital you can bet your ass you will.  Don't worry too much, if you want to get over it, you will be able to. You might not like it still, but after a while you will get used to it.

Did you finish art school and this is a second go? Or are you switching focus mid-stream?  As for vomit, it'll happen. Always, always make sure that you have the enemies bags stocked and handy, preferably in the patient's hand if they're there for nausea. I used to be much more affected by vomit, but you get used to it."

Radiology,3duc7a,Dr_Schiff,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:34:36 2015 UTC,"Alright. Just some constructive criticism.   First, the formatting needs tweaking. Resumes are an overview of your work and experiences. Hiring managers will want resumes to be concise as they will be analyzing them on a daily basis.   Secondly, the information needs to be more relevant. It's good to put equipment down that you worked with but as for shift times and facility room capacity... it's a little much. Don't put reference information in your resume. Put something like ""references and recommendations available upon request"" at the very bottom. Also make sure to have your certifications and degrees (CPR, AAS, Etc).  It's hard finding a good example online but sort of stick to this: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/80/d8/69/80d8698cfef80d7b2ee9a808baa98857.jpg Just keep it categorized and not as in-depth."
Radiology,3duc7a,INGWR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:50:46 2015 UTC,"/r/resumes can handle all your formatting needs, of which there are plenty. You don't bullet points to list that you're ""ARRT registered"". If it can fit on one line, why wouldn't you want it to know?  The purpose of your resume is to provide the hiring manager with new, relevant information in a concise format that's easy to read. The objective paragraph can die, because that's assumed anyway. We know you're committed to taking the best X-rays, so don't give me fluff. Don't put subjective things on your resume that you know they'd expect of you anyway.  Either give achievements, or numbers.   For those same reasons, the bullet points talking about your hospital experiences should also be revised. ""Infant, adolescent, and pediatric"" are all pediatric. It reads like you're trying to stretch this resume out to fill more paper. But if it's short, then so be it. It's assumed it's going to be short if you're just coming out of school.   Get rid of all the bullet points that don't list some quantitative value. Numbers speak volumes, so anecdotes. Wow, you clean the room in between patients? Congratulations on doing the expected minimum. For numbers: how many hours did you spend at your clinical rotations? In each department? Did you work weekends or evenings (hello trauma experience)? How many surgeries per day? Any trauma bay cases?"
Radiology,3dscnr,ChantelleReid,2,Sun Jul 19 00:06:28 2015 UTC,"I just graduated from Ultrasound school, but I went a different route.  I got a Bachelor's degree solely in sonography where they taught us the four major modalities: Vascular, OB/GYN, Abdomen, and Echocardiography.    I would suggest learning every modality possible if you are planning on just being a sonographer.  As a newly grad, I beat out a 15 year veteran for a job at a Cardiology office because I was Vascular and Echo registered, whereas the veteran sonographer only know Echo.  Knowing all modalities of Sonography is a humongous advantage over most sonographers.  However if you are planning on being a sonographer/radiographer, I'm guessing most places trying to hire you for that kind of double duty is a hospital that wants you to work in a general lab third shift so that you can also do x-rays, CTs, whatever, as well as ultrasound studies.  Basically, someone who can handle everything that comes through the ER.  I mean, that's not always the case, but the only places I saw hiring people doing double duty like that were tiny rural hospitals or medium/small hospitals looking for a well-rounded third shifter for their lower volume nights/weekends in the ER.  Besides that, if you already have your RTR, then you know what you need to do IN school to get through.  If they only offer one or two modalities for you to learn, it's hard to decide which to pick.  You may pick abdomen and vascular since most general labs are going to involve those.  I don't see many Echo techs being intimately tied to the radiology department, so if you get an Echo degree, it may be hard to utilize both talents.  Either way, good luck!"

In Canada you can do generalist, vascular and cardiac. We will be doing vascular but not in depth.  Just basic I believe. All of our techs are cross trained in something. When I am done we will have 2 Xray/CT  techs and 2 Xray/US techs."

Most likely even when you graduate you still will not feel comfortable with many exams. The only way to get over the fear of doing something is to get comfortable doing it.  Also I suggest getting into the group ""sonographers do it in the dark"" on facebook. A large community of sonographers and you will usually learn something new quite a bit.   Good luck!"
Radiology,3drswl,omgitzjason,2,Sat Jul 18 21:01:49 2015 UTC,"Typical day depends on where you work. When I was in ortho, it was come in, start up the room, get organized and then start shooting with little down time. Now I work in a clinic, so there's a lot of waiting around between patients, so I help around the office with other things. Problems I have to deal with: work place drama, in ortho it was trying to get kids into position and have them hold it. Decisions: helping out my docs get the best views, trying to figure out how to get the best view if a patient cannot move well. Ways to obtain necessary experience could be anything. Try and shadow, but that's a little difficult these days, a lot of places won't allow it due to privacy laws. If you're still waiting to get in and have a bit of time left, try and get a job in the medical field. Try reception in a radiology office/department. Any patient experience is a plus. If that's not possible, customer experience is a plus too. Research the field and what you need to be doing. It's not all happy patients and button pushing. It is hard on your body, you have to make people do things they don't want to do, and put them in pain to get the positions/images you need. Look into barium enemas, they may be going away, but they still exist. Honestly, end of high school in the ""what are you going to be when you grow up"" time, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I couldn't afford a 4 year university, and I didn't want to do nursing. My guidance counselor gave me a pamphlet on the RT program at the local community college, and I thought, why not, looks cool. I was fortunate that I ended up loving it and have a huge passion for this job.   Foothill College in the Bay Area? I've met good and bad techs from that program. They get to go to some of the better clinical sites though. More trauma centers, more variety. No one has ever asked me what my grades were, GPA was, or score on the national exam was. All that matters is personality and capabilities. That was after school. In school, you need to pass your classes with a minimum of 75% otherwise you're out. You also need a relatively clean background check, and yearly drug testing. Advancement can go in a variety of directions. You can cross train into other modalities, or you can attend extra schooling after for some of those. If you get your BS, you can go into management and higher up positions within a radiology department. Flexibility/vacations depends. When you're per diem, it's very flexible because you just say you're not available, but you won't get paid for the time off. Otherwise, it's like everywhere else, you have to request the time off, and if it works with the schedule, you get it. Remember, you are going to start at the bottom, so you're going to get shitty shifts, work holidays, nocs, etc. Very rarely will you get the Monday-Friday 8-5 thing, unless you end up in a clinic/outpatient center, but even those places have evening and weekend schedules. In school, you will not get vacation or time off. School and clinic is your main focus. Any vacations will be very very short. I took 2 ""vacations"" while in school. They were both only 2 days. Employment outlook depends on where you are. If you are in the Bay Area like I suspect, you'll be per diem for awhile before full time or even part time. A lot of people in the area work at least 2 jobs. The area is flooded so competition is stiff. The job is growing, but more into advanced modalities like CT, MR, and PET. Future job openings again depend on the area. Paid/unpaid experiences are like I mentioned above. Clinical experience through schooling is most important because it is likely you'll end up working at one of those clinical sites. Any experiences with patient population/customer service is a plus because it will teach you how to deal with people."

I work in a smaller rural hospital I have appointments everyday as well as emergencies and inpatients. A 7 hour shift for me is typically comprised of 20 to 30 patients. We do after hours call back.       • problems you have to deal with?   Common problems are patients who are in pain, patients who may not speak your language, patients with mental or physical deficits. All things you have to accommodate for and still maintain your patients dignity and respect.      • decisions you have to make?  Decisions made could range from how to best position given patient presentation ie. if they are a trauma patient to should you do the extra view to better visualize something.   What are some ways i could obtain necessary experience for this field. Contact local hospitals see if they allow job shadowing. Do an accredited medical Radiography program and write a certification exam. CAMRT or AART What interested you in the radiology technology   I enjoy working with people, being a part of their health care and knowing that I make a difference in people's lives. I also am interested In physics etc.   How well does the program at foothill prepare you for the job?   I attended a college in Newfoundland Canada   Are grades/GPA important for this field?   Grades are important as you are expected to be a proficient in anatomy as well as technique and image processing etc. Bottom line is that in this field you are working with ionizing radiation and Knowing your stuff and practicing safely are key.   What are the advancement opportunities?   Based on where you work out of, a general rad tech may go on to study an array of topics, such as, MRI, CT, Ultrasound, Mammography, Bone Density, Angiography etc.   Are there flexibility to work schedule and vacation schedule?   Totally dependant on where you work. My job is a Monday to Friday with weekend and evening call back.   What is the employment outlook for this job?   Where I am from jobs are scarce there are a lot of casuals in the big city, capital of the province.   How rapidly is this job growing?   As with any technology based career it's a fast moving train. Hop on. Radiography is constantly evolving and the technology is consistently advancing.   Can you estimate future job openings?

Radiology,3drswl,reijn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:32:12 2015 UTC,"> What is a typical day like?  It depends where you are and what shift you work in. Different locations will have different standard xrays. Orthopedic clinics will be all joints; hospitals will have a variety but mostly chests and abdomens, portables in the ED, post op portables. Urgent cares can be dreadfully slow or ridiculously busy - either of those extremes make the day suck. There's pain management clinics where you do only c-arm but very repetitive and kinda boring procedures. If you work overnight it'll be all ED and morning portables. It really just depends.   Sometimes you'll be jam-packed with work and be exhausted, sometimes you'll be sitting around on Facebook or reading something (don't let anyone catch you).   >problems you have to deal with?  Stressed/upset coworkers are very common. I'm a firm believer that no one intends to be rude, no one is inherently mean, but as healthcare workers we're all stressed all the time for various reasons. People can get snippy. There will always be that one person who does have it out for everyone - just learn who that person is and bite your tongue and deal with it.  And while you are a student it's almost guaranteed that people will treat you like shit and you will have many bad days. Keep your chin up!  People who don't speak English or whatever your primary language is. You'll have to get an interpreter and speak in very simple words because sometimes the interpreters don't really know either. I'm not sure if they're even trained in medical vocabulary - depending on where you work they may have people who have been trained like that, maybe not. I ran into one who didn't know how to say ""remove your bra"" in Spanish. Learn how to pantomime things. For that lady I just pinched my own bra-strap and made a ""pull it off"" movement.   Sexual harassment from patients. Happens whether you're male or female. Some of it you will have to just learn to ignore. But some of it will cross the line and you will have to call security or call in a different person to deal with that patient. Same with combative patients.   >decisions you have to make?  It depends on what kind of authority you have, I guess. Sometimes a generic order will come in and you will have to change it to specific for billing (ie: changing ""ankle xray"" to ""3 view ankle""), as per protocol. You will have to be pretty good at changing things up on the fly, that comes with experience, because every patient and situation is different.   >What are some ways i could obtain necessary experience for this field.  You're gonna have to go to school for this. They'll give you all the experience. Don't forget to use your school experience on your resume as relevant work experience - YOU ARE WORKING! Just for free (in fact you're paying to work).  >What interested you in the radiology technology  I didn't know what I wanted to do in school. I wanted to do something medical related, but I have a needle phobia (turns out if I go into CT I'll have to start IVs!) so no nursing. I went to a fair at school where each program hosted a table with information, and went to all of the medical tables asking them questions. I talked to physical therapists, nurses (I can't remember which one - CNA/LPN/RN, all those confuse me), multiskilled technicians, medical assisting... I liked best how the xray table presented their job. So that's what I chose. I'd never thought about it before and just did it. Some days I regretted my decision. Some days I didn't. I love my job now.   >How well does the program at foothill prepare you for the job?  I'm not sure what this means? My program fully prepared me. In fact since working with students at my job I've decided my program from a different location overprepared us. They kicked our asses, fully, and for good reason. We all have good jobs and all the hardships we endured have made us better people.   >Are grades/GPA important for this field?  Yesssssssssssssss. Yes. Yes. There are so many people applying for a position in any RT program you attend. You will need to be a shining star. Sell yourself. You will also have to pass all classes in the program, so they want people who are capable - who won't take up a spot and then fail out when it gets hard.   >What are the advancement opportunities?  Eh. You may be able to be cross trained on the job, you might have to continue education. You could be promoted to lead tech later, or work in management but for management you will need a bachelors degree probably (a lot of RT programs are associates)  >Are there flexibility to work schedule and vacation schedule?  Mmm. Yes and no. When you're fresh out of school you will likely get a contingent/PRN ""as needed"" job. It will likely be part time. You will be covering days off and vacations. You may be on call. You will probably start out full time for your training period, but return to only a few hours a day later. If you say you need weekends off, they will laugh at you. I've seen it happen. The plus side about being part time/contingent/PRN is because you have no set schedule, it will be easy for you to request time off. Just not if they're holidays - that's what you're there for, to fill in holiday leave.   >What is the employment outlook for this job?  It depends. In my city they're on a massive hiring spree and you're almost guaranteed a job if you don't completely suck. Some places are dead. You will probably have to relocate. I got lucky in that I was planning on relocating here anyway.    >How rapidly is this job growing?  There will always be sick people, and as population grows, so does sick people. But there will be a lag in healthcare behind because they need new facilities, more rooms. If you only have 1 xray room how many techs do you need? Not a lot. Even if you have a thousand patients waiting in line, you still only have 1 xray room so you might as well not hire more than a few techs (just an example, not a real representation of techs and patients).   But there are a LOT of RT programs out there. The graduation rate is not always 100% - most programs lose 1/4 to 1/2 of their students. But still. Some places, like Florida, are churning out way too many RTs.   >Can you estimate future job openings?  I have no clue. Just wait for all the old RTs to retire and GTFO! :)  >What are some paid/unpaid experiences some one can do for this job?  Uh well you will not be getting paid for your time in school as a student RT. :) Get an ancillary job (custodial, food service, transport, whatever) in the hospital you will be doing your clinic time at, or at the hospital you want to work at when you graduate, so your foot is already in the door. Be good at your job, be friendly, and you will probably get the job once you graduate."

Radiology,3drswl,Aggietoker,2,Sun Jul 19 04:42:15 2015 UTC,"Pay and workload varies greatly all across the country, site to site, and also by shift. Do your research before you decide to invest your time and money into RT. It's a great field with options buy may not be for everyone. Be weary of places that are continuously hiring, this is a good sign of high turnover which is never a good thing. I know just as many happy techs as I know miserable. The above response is fantastic first hand experience."

Radiology,3drswl,polite_dick,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:24:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not a radiologic technologist yet, but I am a radiologic technologist student with hospital experience. I also have connections with a lot of other radiologic technologists.   What is a typical day like? A typical day as a Radiologic Technologist is to bring patient after patient into the x-ray room, x-ray the patient and then send the radiographs through a system called PACS, which radiologist have access to. If one works in a hospital, one would have to push stretchers, move patient from stretcher to table, push and operate C-arms and portable machines, etc.   problems you have to deal with? Getting a child to stay still for an x-ray. Easing their fear. Patients who don't listen to simple commands and questions (please stand, lie down, what's your full name, etc.) Some patient's minds are just somewhere else. This job sometimes requires a lot of patience.   decisions you have to make? Sometimes a patient is unable to stay in a certain position, so that's when I have to be creative and try to get the view in some other way. This happens a lot with trauma patients.  What are some ways i could obtain necessary experience for this field. You can ask a hospital if you can observe the radiology department. Also, if you become a student radiographer you will gain a lot of experience necessary for the job.  What interested you in the radiology technology? I like being hands on, love being creative and wanted to do something in the medical field without having to clean after someone's poop and deal with chemistry (chemistry and I don't get along). I was able to observe radiographers at my local hospital, and was amazed at how one can be really creative but at the same time help others. I think radiologic technology is the only medical field out there that combines both health field and creativity.   How well does the program at foothill prepare you for the job? I go to school in New York so I wouldn't be able to say.  Are grades/GPA important for this field? YES. Getting into radiologic technology programs is quite competitive nowadays. They expect you to get good grades in your pre requisite courses. Definitely aim as high as you can when it your pre requisites. As for the classes one takes after getting accepted into the program, employers really don't care how bad or well you did in school, as long as you pass the registry (license exam) after graduating.  What are the advancement opportunities? If you have years of experience as a radiologic technologist, you can advance to become a supervisor. Besides that, you can become licensed in other modalities (CT, MRI, mammography, interventional, radiologist assistant, and more). Radiologic technology can branch off into so many things. Getting your license in other modalities makes you more valuable to employers and also raises your salary.  Are there flexibility to work schedule and vacation schedule? You would have to request time off like most jobs. As a student, you will most likely be in the hospital in both the winter and the summer. You will get time off, but not much.  What is the employment outlook for this job? It depends on the state. As of my school, 75% of the graduates found jobs.   How rapidly is this job growing? Growing well compared to other jobs.   Can you estimate future job openings? Depends where you live.   What are some paid/unpaid experiences some one can do for this job? The clinical experience a student gets in the hospital is unpaid. It's almost like slave work because I find that a lot of the students can do nearly all the work that a radiologic technologist is able to do."

Because of my otherwise good health (at the time of this xray I was actively training for a marathon and still running 10-15 miles per day), I think they were reluctant to believe me that something was wrong. My PCP kept thinking I had a sinus infection because of the congestion (brought on by the pleural effusion) and I went through a ton of different antibiotics before I finally just asked for an xray."

QM always stood out to me as the only other certification I would consider.   What motivated you to pursue QM certification?  How does that certification play into your every day activities, and what duties spawn from having that cert.? Did your QM or CRA credentials result in a pay increase or promotion? Basic stuff: Age, work setting (hosp, clinic, outpatient), and yrs as a tech?"
Radiology,3do1rg,shadowa4,2,Fri Jul 17 21:12:02 2015 UTC,"My physicist actually motivated me to pursue my QM.  In our facility we worked very closely in CT with our medical physicists and he would always take the time to explain the quality control process. My QM has definitely made me much more aware of what it takes to ensure the equipment performs at a certain level.  Quality Control is much more in depth than I realized working as a tech.  Even in the good ol' days of film processing I didn't realize how detailed it really was.  I now work with a local physics company to perform quality control on rad equipment and CTs around town. My QM or CRA did not result in a pay increase or promotion with my  facility, but I did end up leaving and taking a Director position at another hospital.  I know that I most likely would not have been considered for the position if it was not for my QM & more importantly my CRA. I'm 33 and now work in a <100 bed hospital as the multi-modality imaging director.  I've been a rad tech for almost 14 years in many many different imaging settings: Lv 1 & Lv2 trauma centers, 2 surgical hospitals, cancer center, private clinics, freestanding ERs, ortho clinics, morgue, and 1 outpatient imaging center."
Radiology,3dnjg0,djpeanutnose,3,Fri Jul 17 18:43:32 2015 UTC,Well Readi-cat sounds like a very thick smoothie like contrast prep? It will have no active ingredients what so ever. But I suppose if it's very thick it could be acting a bit like Pepto-bismol in terms of coating the stomach (but without any of it's other actions). It's just an idea; but I can't see that it'd do much else to be honest.
Radiology,3dnjg0,OrangutansLibrary,4,Fri Jul 17 19:25:51 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it's probably a barium contrast prep that may coat his stomach and act as almost a buffer to contact with the stomach for the food.
Radiology,3dnjg0,Glonn,4,Fri Jul 17 20:31:06 2015 UTC,"It is. Readi-cat is a barium based PO prep. However, unlike barium for fluoroscopy readi-cat is less concentrated to avoid streaking high density artifact in CT."
Radiology,3dnjg0,shadowa4,2,Fri Jul 17 20:52:56 2015 UTC,What kind of barium is used in fluoro? I know that Readicat is only ~2% BaSO4 on a w/w basis.
Radiology,3dnjg0,y_x_n,2,Sat Jul 18 01:56:02 2015 UTC,"I believe it is the same (barium sulfate). At least in my experience, barium for fluoroscopy is mixed by the techs before the procedure, but I can also see it being purchased ready for use. It's considerably ""thicker"" than readi-cat given the higher concentration.  TL;DR: If readi-cat is a smoothie, barium for fluoroscopy is a thick concrete sort of like melted ice cream."
Radiology,3dnjg0,shadowa4,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:46:14 2015 UTC,Is it the EZ-Paque stuff? Or is that not clinically used anymore?
Radiology,3dnjg0,y_x_n,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:54:34 2015 UTC,"Bingo! I had just forgotten the name. That's what I remember mixing before the fluoro exams. Like I said, they probably have these pre mixed now, but my comment still stands that fluoro barium is more concentrated than CT."
Radiology,3dnjg0,shadowa4,3,Sat Jul 18 13:26:30 2015 UTC,"I do research with CT and we work with ReadiCat A LOT. It tends to stay in your system for a few hours after your scan so like others have said, it's probably still coating the inside of your GI tract. Make sure you drink a lot of water as well."
Radiology,3dj8wh,Iatros,2,Thu Jul 16 18:40:18 2015 UTC,"The patient presented with acute blood loss without an obvious GI source. They underwent traditional portal venous phase CE CT scan which showed a large hematoma along the lesser curvature of the stomach, with probable bleeding from the right gastric artery.    We took the patient to angio and had to do quite a few DSA runs to actually find the bleeding vessel. We finally got into a second order branch off of the right gastric and found the site of pseudoaneurysm. It was in an arterial branch which communicated with the left gastric, but we were able to get past the pseudoaneurysm and coil both sides all from our access via the right gastric.     Unfortunately our post-coiling run didn't get saved in PACS, but the patient did very well clinically and was discharged home after about 2 more days in house."
Radiology,3dj8wh,abcbrakka,2,Thu Jul 16 18:46:42 2015 UTC,Nice case. I've never seen a spontaneous one like this before. What was his age and any comorbidities?
Radiology,3dj8wh,piandro,3,Thu Jul 16 20:01:20 2015 UTC,"The patient was mid 60s in age, I forget specifically how old. There were the good old fashioned DM2, HTN, and HLD and a significant but remote trauma history which resulted in loss of much of the lower extremity musculature and a right AKA.   No prior history of spontaneous bleeds, coagulation abnormalities (congenital or iatrogenic), or vasculitis.   I'm interested to see what the CT looks like after the hematoma resolves. I'm concerned there may be some sort of underlying mass that's currently obscured by all the blood products."

Radiology,3dhije,shadowa4,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:02:56 2015 UTC,"Interventional and Special Procedures are the same. However, cath lab is a form of interventional focused on cardiac cases (blockage, stents, etc). They are also performed by a cardiologist, rather than a rad."
Radiology,3dhije,afmag,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:53:20 2015 UTC,"I don't remember what all the procedures were. I know they put in ports, treated cancer by destroying tumors, did stints and our IR department even treated varicose veins. They have a very similar setup to one you'd find in a cardiac cath lab. They even used CT a lot to zero in on tumors."

I got my job in IR after working OR and doing the majority of the vascular surgery cases. When I got an interview with a different hospital for IR, I had a small knowledge base to use for the interview, which helped.  I know a couple of techs that got hired right away into IR, but that would be pretty rare.   The pay here is about $5 more per hour for entry level IR.   Most stressful part of the job would be taking call probably. I have been stuck at work for 24 hours once (emergent call case started right at the end of the day and lasted all night).

Radiology,3dfqx1,herdofcorgis,4,Thu Jul 16 01:42:58 2015 UTC,"At the clinic I worked at, if something was seriously wrong I asked you to wait for a CD.  While I was burning that CD, I called the radiologist for a stat reading, then I called your doctor to relay the preliminary findings.  Many times, I would keep your doctor on the phone to relay instructions to you (which they had already given me).  As you were leaving, I'd make sure you had somebody to drive you, and knew which emergency department to go to.  I maybe had 4 of these cases in the 9 months I did MRI at an outpatient clinic."
Radiology,3dfqx1,herdofcorgis,2,Thu Jul 16 01:59:33 2015 UTC,"Well none of that happened, thankfully. It is such a relieve to know that there is more than likely nothing super critical, that could kill me any second, happening inside me. :)"
Radiology,3dfqx1,herdofcorgis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:11:38 2015 UTC,"CT would refer patients to the ER more than I would where I worked (because of the caseload they could do vs. what I could do - MRIs are slow compared to CT, and most critical patients are sent to CT...plus things like pacemakers, AICDs, and many other implants would prohibit me from scanning you at my clinic, so my MRI patients were generally healthy).    I saw my share of acute strokes (if the ordering physician didn't tell me to send the patient to the ER, I documented the crap out of it on my side), a few large cystic lesions, metastatic cancer (undiagnosed), avascular necrosis, a post-coital aneurysm, and a slew of fractures missed by x-ray."
Radiology,3dfqx1,notevenapro,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:26:39 2015 UTC,"It is crazy how fast CTs are, it never fails to impress me.  So say if you took scans and saw that the patient had cancer, but wasn't in need of emergent care, would you let them leave and have the radiologist or their doctor call them when the results are done?"
Radiology,3dfqx1,herdofcorgis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:39:18 2015 UTC,"I would call the radiologist, and possibly pre-cert if the exam wasn't going to be covered if I needed to administer contrast (many insurance companies will only approve scans without contrast).  Calling the radiologist would get me the order to administer contrast, plus give them the ability to ask for additional scans outside of the protocol for what the patient presented for (generally they would want more detailed scans of the region of interest).  In that situation, I would defer to the radiologist.  Cancer isn't an acute situation, and my clinic didn't have the resources to fully work up a new diagnosis (yes, they could do CTs, but not bone scans since there was no nuc med available to us)."

Radiology,3dfqx1,herdofcorgis,2,Thu Jul 16 05:00:24 2015 UTC,I think this is the best answer.
Radiology,3dfqx1,burstabcess,2,Thu Jul 16 15:56:15 2015 UTC,"Even now, working at a hospital, I've called radiologists before releasing patients with obvious fractures on their MRIs (this last case was from a metastatic lesion, so it wasn't anything acute, and was actually on the patient's previous CT).  While yes, as a tech we're not trained to interpret images, we can spot some of the more obvious abnormalities.    My biggest concern at the clinic I started at was having my patients called back for additional studies.  It's a good habit to not only check your images for clarity, but learn what you're looking at (reading the radiologist's report is a good way to learn)."
Radiology,3dfqx1,burstabcess,5,Thu Jul 16 18:03:59 2015 UTC,If they saw something critical they would tell the radiologist and make some excuse for you to wait in the waiting room for a few minutes. I work as a receptionist in radiology and have been told numerous time by the tech or radiologist to not let the patient leave until we get a hold of the referring physician.   And a week to get the results? That seems like a long time. We tell people 24 hours.
Radiology,3dfj0v,radioquest,4,Wed Jul 15 21:36:18 2015 UTC,"We wear tld's or thermoluminescent detectors. They reside on our torsos where a dose to the internal organs can be recorded.  Working for 5 years mine is still sitting at 0msv. So if you're behind the glass there should be none.   My organs should be sitting at zero, limbs probably have some but without the important goods the radiation should be relatively harmless."
Radiology,3dfj0v,StevetheDog,3,Wed Jul 15 21:56:59 2015 UTC,"It's basically close to 0 to the vast majority of staff; a well run department really should be essentially risk free with no or extremely low exposure. A good illustration is to look at the upper extreme allowed: for example the UK used to keep an annual index of the doses received by Classified Health Workers - those are the Radiographers and Doctors who are allowed to get the highest possible dose of 20mSv because of their job - these are the highest risk possible jobs. The last published mean average radiation doses in this highest risk group was 1.3mSv to medical Radiographers and 2.3mSv to Doctors. But there were only 35 Radiographers and 14 Doctors in the whole country in this category (compared to the 1000s of Radiologists and Radiographers who work in the NHS). Everyone else is in the low risk group, in theory allowing no more than 5mSv a year but for the vast majority that is going to be close to 0mSv from work. For comparison it's estimated we recieve between 2 and 2.5mSv a year just from normal life (including travel). Modern Radiology really is safe for staff."
Radiology,3dfj0v,OrangutansLibrary,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:10:24 2015 UTC,"50mSv is the maximum allowable dose by law. That being said, <5mSv is likely, and the only people approaching that are doing interventional (maybe nucs?). Doing radiographs, CTs, etc. will be next to nil because you're far away (inverse square law) and behind lead."

Radiology,3dfj0v,bretticusmaximus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:16:06 2015 UTC,It still shouldn't matter if they designed the room correctly. They have to account for radiation that might penetrate walls.

Radiology,3dfj0v,sohk2191,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:54:56 2015 UTC,"6 Feet is a pretty appropriate distance from the source, unless of course it's directly in the path of the beam.  If there were a potential for exposure the medical physicist would more than likely have addressed it during the site survey."
Radiology,3dfj0v,SheenaMalfoy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:13:36 2015 UTC,"If you're doing your job right your dose should be basically zero. If you're in a regular exam room, stand in the control panel. If you can't stay in the control panel, put your lead on. If you're doing an exam portably, stand a safe distance back or wear lead. If you're in the OR, you'd better be wearing lead. All of these things reduce the whole body radiation dose tremendously. Sure, your hands might be getting some scatter, but in three years as a student my TLD still reads zero."
Radiology,3dfj0v,SheenaMalfoy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:10:12 2015 UTC,"the control panel i saw was only couple feet behind the x-ray.. so while at 40 inch its a decent distance away from the leadwall(control panel) at 70 inch its only a couple feet away..  this was during looking at different offices, so it was a smaller office, thats why im wondering"
Radiology,3dfj0v,SheenaMalfoy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:18:19 2015 UTC,"Control panels should be lead lined, so no problem there. But you're making it sound as if the tube is pointing toward the control panel? Rooms shouldn't be set up that way..."
Radiology,3dfj0v,eugenemah,2,Thu Jul 16 00:22:28 2015 UTC,"Well from what I saw it looked like that, the grid on one end of the wall and the control panel on the opposite end.. thats why I was wondering, if there is more radiation possible even with the tube inline with the panel.. or would the 1.5mm lead barrier be sufficient"
Radiology,3dfj0v,AsianCha,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:48:58 2015 UTC,"Now I'm not a radiation physicist or anything, so I don't know the specifics of room layouts, but in general it's better to be safe than sorry. Distance is such a huge factor in reducing dose it's better to have the patient on the other end of the room. That, plus any forward scatter (like you'll get with high kV exams such as the neverending list of chests) would be directed toward you if the tube was facing you, which we don't want. Even if we have the shielding, it's better to not take the chance."
Radiology,3dfj0v,JimmyRust,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:44:16 2015 UTC,"I've found out the minimum amounts of radiation a person wants per year. But I haven't found out how much radiation an x-ray tech receives even if he/she stands behind the 1.5mm lead barrier while taking x-rays.   In general, radiography techs should be seeing a lot of Ms (below minimum detectable...M != 0) on their badge reports. Those working in high exposure areas such as interventional or cardiac cath labs will probably see higher readings on their badges, but still significantly less than what the physicians performing procedures would receive.   Im thinking of being an x-ray tech, but just wondering how much radiation I would get if i'm only behind a 1.5 mm lead barrier only several feet away from the machine??   Not very much, and if the room design and shielding design was done properly, less than the maximum allowed occupational exposure. Most of the exposure will be scatter from the patient, and at scattered x-ray energies for diagnostic imaging, 1.5mm lead equivalent barriers provide plenty of attenuation. X-ray tubes also enclosed in a considerable amount of lead so leakage radiation (anything getting out that isn't the primary beam) reaching you in the control booth is tiny."
Radiology,3ddxfb,fornikait,9,Wed Jul 15 14:50:11 2015 UTC,An old ASRT magazine described doing the scapula Y by palpating the anterior part of the acromion and the superior angle of the scapula and shooting straight down the line they form. That helped me never miss a scapula y when I first graduated and I felt was more definitive then just angle the patient so many degrees because not everyones anatomy is average.
Radiology,3ddxfb,Soniver,2,Wed Jul 15 16:47:23 2015 UTC,I think my clinical instructor gave this to me 6 years ago when I was in clinicals. She gives it out to all of her students and I have kept it and shared it with everyone I know. It is the easiest way to get a Y view and I hardly ever miss.
Radiology,3ddxfb,vaporking23,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:08:42 2015 UTC,I do all of my PA Y-views this way - It seems to work quite well for me. I always found the AP far more fiddly to get right.

If your professor/clinical instructor/tech doesn't have a problem with AP, then I would rotate the patient about 45 degrees, with their arm grabbing the unaffected shoulder. (if the patient doesn't have a suspected dislocation)"
Radiology,3ddxfb,Presia,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:56:11 2015 UTC,I second this. I kept screwing it up trying to do what the text said. Finally someone showed me AP & I now get it just fine :)
Radiology,3ddxfb,ErinJung,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:29:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with the AP over PA.  I started with PA but everyone at every site I was at did AP over PA.  You bring the affected arm across the chest so that it forms a 90 degree angle, rotate the body 45-60 degrees."
Radiology,3ddxfb,Glonn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:22:00 2015 UTC,"I worked in a trauma setting for a long time. I found the easiest approach was to shoot AP with the patient supine, affected arm reaching across the body if possible.  If they are unable to reach across, I would oblique them up about 30 degrees on the affected side."
Radiology,3ddxfb,Weenie,2,Thu Jul 16 02:57:54 2015 UTC,It takes time and practice.  The method that works for me is to gently place my hand on the scapula as a reference and guide the body into position.  Being able to feel can help you get it into position.
Radiology,3ddxfb,BariumEnema,3,Wed Jul 15 15:19:28 2015 UTC,Pretty much this. Place your hand on the body of the scapula and rotate your patient until your fingers are pointing towards the bucky.
Radiology,3ddxfb,sigsour,2,Wed Jul 15 15:38:30 2015 UTC,Line up the spine of the scapular with the ac joint. Works every time.
Radiology,3ddxfb,burstabcess,2,Wed Jul 15 18:25:59 2015 UTC,"I always find the AC joint and line it up with the medial border. Works perfect. But at my current facility we do an axillary instead of a Y, no matter what, as part of a shoulder series. Our ortho docs say a scap Y is a useless projection and shouldn't exist. Lol"
Radiology,3ddxfb,xrayphoton,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:02:59 2015 UTC,"Oh my, I wish our ortho docs felt that way! Haha. We do a scap y for all routine images as well as trauma but we've been less busy these last few months so I haven't had that great of practice unfortunately"
Radiology,3ddxfb,herdofcorgis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:01:34 2015 UTC,"I have them place their hand on the opposite shoulder, rotate until the beam will be shooting through the humeral head of the affected side, and have a good technique for my patient's body habitus (my x-ray job is plain film).  The surgeon I work with has never complained (and I received compliments on them while I was in school).  I think as far as where this position comes from, it's a lateral scapula position technique according to Bontragers."
Radiology,3ddxfb,gmpowers,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:36:21 2015 UTC,When I was at a hospital clinic a rad tech showed me a way and I never miss it. If put your hands out like you're hugging someone your arms form a 45* angle. When you turn either way towards the Bucky and your arm touches the board that is 45*.  From AP aim the CR at the middle of the head of the humerus and be sure to have an inch of light above the shoulder. I use this method and have little difficulty getting the y view. Hope it helps.
Radiology,3ddxfb,aznpie45,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:32:12 2015 UTC,"Firstly, know that you can get this view almost spot on 95% of the time after you get it down, it's not a shot in the dark as some techs would lead you to believe. The thing that makes the Y view particularly tricky is that its a much more 3-dimensional structure than most other projections. Personally, I use the scapular spine as my landmark. The scapular spine is off from the lateral body of the scapular by about 5 degrees. So basically if you are having trouble with rotation on a PA, try to have the scapular spine off from the CR angle by about 5 degrees. On the other axis, if you see a the body of your scapula being projected between the top of your Y structure, this is almost always cause for repeat. As much as the Y is for shoulder dislocations, almost of doctors also want to check for supra-spinaious impingement. This is especially true for non-trauma patients! Remember that on a PA-Y view, techs tend to try to get the shoulder right up against the wall unit. If the arm is placed across the belly, the patient will always lean forward causing a distorted projection!  Please ask if this explanation was confusing!"
Radiology,3ddxfb,emanile,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:54:32 2015 UTC,"A good way that one of the rad techs during placement told me was to put the affected shoulder in the middle of the erect bucky. At this point they should be standing completely perpendicular/lateral to the bucky. Get them to put their hand (the hand of the affected side) on their stomach and to bring their elbow back as far as they can, so that the humeral head doesn't superimpose over the scapula. Then, turn on the tube light. Using the shoulder they're resting on as a pivot point (be careful if they're in pain), oblique the patient until the vertical line of the light meets the medial border of their scapula. From there, its just centring up and down along the patient's scapula. Have their other arm just resting on the top of the bucky, so that it's not in the way of the beam. This method get's me a perfect Y-view every time."
Radiology,3ddxfb,peedzllab,0,Fri Jul 17 12:13:25 2015 UTC,"It may not be ""Merrils"" but I center the the CR just medial to the medial border of the scapula. The positioning just takes time. I never see it in clinic but I do see it a lot at work so it does get easier. Also there's no shame in having your merrils on hand just incase. I reference that book often while working.   Edit: I got alotted by the alot bot."

Then you have to secure a residency in radiology. Again, people tend to consider that to be somewhat difficult."
Radiology,3dbig3,lieutenantdantoni,2,Wed Jul 15 01:16:18 2015 UTC,"Hi Federica, always good to see people interested in Radiology.  There are a few routes into Radiology - it's a complex area with lots of different professionals working together to help patients and is a key department in most hospitals.    Radiology as a Specialty for Doctors: These are the Doctors who mostly ""read"" the X-rays, CTs, MRIs, and also do Ultrasound, Image guided procedures and other diagnostic tests, and will offer expert opinions to other Professionals. To do this you have to go to Medical School, then complete post-graduate medical education as a Radiologist (a Residency in the USA & Canada, or a Training Scheme in the UK, and similar set ups but different names in most other countries). It's a very competitive route as it's a popular speciality for Doctors within Medicine but it's an extremely interesting and rewarding area to work. It takes a total of at least 12 years from the start of medical school in the UK to become a fully qualified Radiologist (last 5 years of which are pure Radiology training, and last 7 years are paid training and working) Radiographer (UK) or Radiology Technologists (USA) - These are professionals who acquire the images; they're experts in using the scanners such as CT, MRI, or various static and live X-ray machines and are vital to the work of any Radiology department or unit. There are also increasingly opportunities to become Reading Radiographers - that is, becoming trained to read things like X-ray or certain CTs usually within a department under the support of a Radiologist Doctor. Radiography is usually a direct entry into a training programme - in the UK for example that's usually a 3 year degree or also a 2-year accelerated degree for people who have a degree in something else. Sonographers - These are professionals who are trained to perform Ultrasounds either entirely independently or (more frequently) with the availability of support from Radiologists in a department or unit. There are various different types of Sonography - it may be general Sonography in a Radiology Department but also Sonography in Cardiac Departments (doing Echocardiograms) is a huge area. Sonographers are also increasingly gaining opportunities to do some procedures too (for example I know of a couple who are now increasingly involved in Breast work and have started doing biopsies). In the UK there is no direct route into Sonography; generally people do Radiography (or other clinical science jobs in Cardiology for example) and then train to become a Sonographer later. I don't know how this works in the USA or other countries.   All of the routes will have a significant Science content at university level as well as ""on-the-job"" apprenticeship type training both at University and after. There are also even more routes into working in Radiology or allied areas - we have Nurses who train to work in Interventional Radiology, there are Therapeutic Radiographers who work in Oncology departments working with Radiotherapy or in Nuclear Medicine departments working with Nuclear Medicine Physicians.  The UK's NHS has some overviews on it's website of the different careers (other countries will differ but the general roles will be broadly the same):   NHS Careers: Clinical Radiology (Dr) NHS Careers: Diagnostic and Therapeutic Radiographers"
Radiology,3dbig3,OrangutansLibrary,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:12:45 2015 UTC,"Student radiographer here.  It's challenging, and some schools have different standards than others. If you are science minded then the physics, imaging, and biology classes aren't too difficult.  It's the working for free at a hospital/clinic/imaging center, finding time to study for those classes, staying above water financially, and not losing touch with your loved ones that is the hardest.    You've gotta be able to talk to people, be able to empathize or pretend to empathize, and not be afraid of hospital environments.  I love this field, and I'm glad I'm in it."

If it's the latter, yes the classes are challenging. It's challenging because a lot of information is thrown at me at once. Good time management is one of the key things to success in Radiologic Technology. I had to sacrifice a lot of my free time to study for seven classes during my first semester. Every week I would get 3-6 exams and be in class from 8am to 4pm (most radiologic technology programs have this time schedule). I barely had any sleep and time for myself. The first semester was when the school was trying to weed out the ones who weren't exactly dedicated. I believed it was a test to see how dedicated I was to my studies.   You would most likely succeed in radiologic technology if you are open to constructive criticism, good in memorizing anatomy, can handle stressful situations, can think outside the box, and be able to do basic algebra."

Radiology,3d744w,mexicanmike1,3,Tue Jul 14 08:04:22 2015 UTC,"Neat, thanks. I guess they plated it because it's comminuted. I've seen ones that bad that they leave alone, but hey I'm just a tech. Is the nerve pain gone?"
Radiology,3d744w,dead_ahead,3,Tue Jul 14 14:35:18 2015 UTC,"A relative indication to fix a clavicle that otherwise wouldn't be fixed is because that arm is required fro ambulation (in this case, crutches)."

Radiology,3d744w,ArmyOrtho,3,Thu Jul 16 11:16:54 2015 UTC,How's the rehab going? How's the knee feeling? That distal femur is something else!!
Radiology,3d744w,adifferentjk,5,Tue Jul 14 05:07:25 2015 UTC,"Rehab is going well. I'm on visit 14 tomorrow and am now walking with the aide of crutches. I still use a chair mostly around the house for convenience but try to scoot more with my legs than my arms. I can walk without crutches in the alter g treadmill set to 50% of my body weight. I was granted WBAT status on 7/7 and am eager to get back to walking without assistance.  The knee still feel very strange to me, it is tight to bend and still quite swollen.  Also a lot of sensation  loss adds to the odd feeling. Current flex is up to 123* vs the 35* I started therapy with , doc was hoping for 90*."
Radiology,3d744w,ArmyOrtho,2,Tue Jul 14 06:57:39 2015 UTC,Holy moly... Looking at that knee I was thinking 'no way this person is ever going to walk without a walking aid' but so glad to read that it could be possible for you. Does it get cold in winter with all the hardware inside?   I know it's obvious but just gotta say it..  That looks awfully painful =(
Radiology,3d744w,JimmyRust,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:14:35 2015 UTC,Well luckily there is not much winter to worry about here in Phoenix!  This will surely be one of those injuries that constantly reminds me its there. :/

Radiology,3d744w,dontbenodrag,6,Tue Jul 14 01:52:43 2015 UTC,All of it is permanent.
Radiology,3d744w,ArmyOrtho,2,Tue Jul 14 02:16:19 2015 UTC,I'd love to hear /u/armyortho's take on this.  Would you mind x-posting to /r/medicine?
Radiology,3d744w,dontbenodrag,2,Wed Jul 15 22:50:31 2015 UTC,"I, unfortunately, do a lot of these.  This is well done.  The only sticky point I would have is that it doesn't appear as if the metaphyseal distal femur is pulled out to the correct length.  Some times this is intentional, to allow for bony opposition and a shortened femur to encourage the bone to heal, but in my experience, not usually necessary in the metaphyseal portion of the bone.    Based on the images, it looks like this was done with a minimally invasive technique, hence the long screws at the mid shaft (they are not too long).    The clavicle is also well done, but I'm not sure why it's double plated.  Seems overkill.  This is one that could have been treated nonoperatively, but given the need to use crutches to walk with the leg for an extended period of time, I would have opted to fix it as well.  The tibia is reduced nicely and the patellar tendon is anatomically reattached.  If the metaphyseal bone heals but goes to post-traumatic arthritis (probably a 100% chance of this happening), you won't need a distal femoral replacement, simply a total knee arthroplasty will suffice.   Talented surgeon.  I'm sure you'll do well."
Radiology,3d744w,dontbenodrag,3,Wed Jul 15 23:10:39 2015 UTC,"Well, that was certainly quick!  Thanks, Doc!"

Radiology,3d744w,dontbenodrag,2,Wed Jul 15 23:49:22 2015 UTC,Fair play to them not just amputating it. It looks pretty smashed up even after the fix. Imagine seeing it come through the trauma bay! The amount of screws is mental.
Radiology,3d744w,dontbenodrag,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:39:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm grateful that there was no amputation! ""Smashed up"" is a good term, my doc used the term ""dust""...he assured me it was very very bad but did his best to mend me. Once I saw an image with all those screws..man, I figured my knee would never bend again!"

It's usually a patient who has the procedure regularly enough that there are little tattoo marks where the needles go through the surgical marker ink. But for billing purposes he didn't do more. I have seen it under fluoro and in CT.  I watched a really good rad do heaps and asked him to do mine, instant pain relief! But radiation... so I haven't done it again."
Radiology,3d60nj,burstabcess,2,Mon Jul 13 23:58:32 2015 UTC,I got bilateral but he only did one side at a time. Didn't get the second picture as the nurse was flipping thru my chart. I also got SI a few weeks ago. That took some of the pain away. But this will hopefully do the trick for a few days so I can get an ablation.

Radiology,3d60nj,Yellowbenzene,2,Tue Jul 14 04:41:33 2015 UTC,What is this?
Radiology,3d60nj,dishwasherlove,2,Mon Jul 13 21:36:47 2015 UTC,"A Dalek. Don't they teach that in the UK anymore?  But seriously, it's a lumbar facet joint pain injection, more commonly performed under CT guidance these days."
Radiology,3d60nj,Yellowbenzene,2,Mon Jul 13 22:19:53 2015 UTC,"OK,  I've actually done these,  but never under conventional fluoro - CT fluoroscopy is what we use instead.  My boss gave me the option so I just learned using that because it's what I use for other practical procedures.   Not familiar with the multi needle at once technique though.  I actually thought it was some kind of mad private osteopathy acupuncture thing that you sometimes hear about happening in the USA, where the regulation regarding x-ray use isn't as stringent as it is here."
Radiology,3d60nj,shadowa4,2,Mon Jul 13 22:30:03 2015 UTC,"The VA clinic where I work does these routinely under fluoro for pain mgmt. However, it's a PM specialist guiding the needles. We do caudal epis, facets, SI's, and even cervicals."
Radiology,3d60nj,John-1973,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:35:00 2015 UTC,"What would be the benefit of using a ct-scanner for these procedures? We use conventional fluoroscopy combined with electro stimulation to ascertain the correct position. This hardly ever fails to produce the wanted results, using (an educated guess, correct me if I'm wrong) much less ionising radiaton."
Radiology,3d60nj,Yellowbenzene,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:37:35 2015 UTC,We have some brand new scanners which have low doses.  Never used electronic stimulation.  We are only usually doing single level injections and even these are quite rare though.
Radiology,3d60nj,John-1973,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:42:48 2015 UTC,"Ok that explains it somewhat. Although we also have a state-of-the -art Siemens 128 slice CT-scanner, we just couldn't afford it to use it for this purpose. We have only one and this in full time use for normal work-flow. We always use electronic stimulation. And for more permanent solutions we use the same equipment to desensitise nerves by heating them up to about 80 to 90 degrees Celsius for about 3 minutes."
Radiology,3d60nj,Yellowbenzene,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:52:34 2015 UTC,"Ours are new 256 slice ones, and we have two 128s that could also be used.  Most of the time they are doing run of the mill stuff.  Sounds like your MSK practice is much more developed than what we do.  In the UK, back pain treatment is unlikely to get as far as this on the NHS.  I'm learning in case there's a private caseload."
Radiology,3d60nj,John-1973,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:57:43 2015 UTC,"Chronic back related diagnosis and therapy are a considerable part of our work load at our Radiology department. We have 3 half day sessions a week for our out-patient pain relief department and about 1/3 (sometimes more) of our MRI's are spinal examinations, mostly for disc herniations and to a lesser amount for MS. Most (if not all) of these procedures are covered by the compulsory basic health insurance in the Netherlands."
Radiology,3d60nj,Yellowbenzene,2,Mon Jul 13 23:11:29 2015 UTC,"We do plenty of MRI for degenerative backs, but even with a lot of discs etc picked up we don't do many injections. Interesting to hear the difference."
Radiology,3d60nj,dishwasherlove,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:19:03 2015 UTC,It's not ideal to do multiple levels simultaneously because the pain might actually be coming from only one of them and you never isolate it. Meaning each time the patient presents they have to pay for levels when they might not need them.
Radiology,3d60nj,peedzllab,2,Tue Jul 14 03:44:31 2015 UTC,Ive only ever seen/done these under C-Arm Fluoro. Pretty cool to be using CT for it.

Had no issue passing at all, and if I recall I was just barely passing practice exams (Mosby's online ones).   Keep in mind I took my Radiography boards only 10 months prior, and I'm sure having that info fresh in my mind helped.  I was lucky enough that my radiography program included a CT class taught by the lead CT tech at the hospital.  We went over all the basics, equipment, and cross sectional anatomy.  Beyond that, I just studied the Mosby's book and, of course, did my clinical sign-offs."

Other than that, try and figure out which you would enjoy more.  Obviously being a rad tech AND a Sonographer could make you more marketable, but many hospitals hire strictly for one modality or another.  You may end up doing more X-ray than sonography in some jobs, or vice versa.  Also weigh the cost of additional schooling versus additional income from doing both."

It will go up if the cost of living is high which, is essentially, whether or not you live in a city or small town. It will go up if the patient volume is higher. As for facility name, most likely you'll see average, if not, better than average pay if the hospital is branched or mainstream.

Even if you don't put the marker on the lateral aspect for extremities, they will make you repeat it.  A student saw a tech repeat an odontoid SIX times on a patient.

I used to work for the company before I was a rad tech, but I was in a satellite office, and we operated very differently from the rest of the company. I was never told of this policy at my office, but, I was in physical therapy so that was never even an issue.  The techs are also not allowed to touch their patients, beyond what is necessary. A student got chewed out for feeling for a patient's ISIS with the flat of her hand; she was told she needed to keep her hand stiff and use the karate chop motion.

Radiology,3czmm0,Minerva89,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:19:26 2015 UTC,"I've had this one.  First year student ,  my CI and classmate were doing an lspine on an older woman from the ER who was brought over with her daughter and seemed fine, conversing with us.   Five minutes later I hear ""where the fuck am I, get off me""  as she grabs at a tech and scratches my classmate on her face.   She wandered into the control room where all  4 rooms were linked and was screaming that we were holding her captive. Her daughter opened the door and got her, bringing her back to the ER.   It gets scary fast"
Radiology,3czmm0,Glonn,6,Tue Jul 14 19:02:29 2015 UTC,"One night in the ER, a woman is brought over for a chest xray. She was in her mid 40s and seemed a little... off.   She comes in the room and I start looking at her req and I notice for pregnancy status it says yes. Obviously this was concerning and at that hospital informed consent is required. So I began to inquire about her pregnancy to which she replied, ""Oh I'm not pregnant.""   Red flag goes off so I call the nurses station and ask about it. The nurse then told me that they didn't want to tell her yet because of all of the drugs in her system. I told them that we couldn't do an xray under those circumstances and that they needed to tell her what's going on.   I bring her back to her room and not even 5 minutes later she is back in my department and is happy as a clam. I asked her if they told her about her pregnancy status to which she again replied that she wasn't. I finally just laid it out there that they did a blood test and that yes, she was pregnant.   At this point she broke down and stated crying that she couldn't have a baby, that she had been smoking 'illegal substances'. She then proceed to jump on to my xray table and started screaming for me to abort it.   I was pretty mad about the whole situation, so I gave the nurse and ordering doctor a call. Their collective response was essentially 'she has done so many drugs, who cares at this point?' regarding radiation exposure.   Maybe they were right, but in my mind not doing the consent was unethical. I next went to the rad about it which brought up the next ethical dilemma; how do you informed consent someone about their pregnancy when they are high?   We ended up doing the xray because the potential risks didn't outweigh the gain, but it was an awful situation to be in either way."

In my UK based scheme/residency I would not put any ""free choice"" time into Ultrasound if I'd had that option. US is definitely an extremely useful skill BUT we were given ample and intensive US during our ""residency"" Year 1 and once trained we then did bucket loads of it under minimal supervision. I'd ask Residents on the scheme whether US is something well taught or whether you need to take the opportunity to be doing extra. If it's well taught you might just be doubling up something you're going to be taught better later and missing a golden opportunity.  If US is well taught then honestly do something that isn't well taught or something that really interests you but which you might not get to see much off during the early years of Residency - e.g. if it were my scheme I'd have used the time to do MRI (we got pretty narrow MRI exposure until later in training; plus I just like MRI a lot) or something like Nuclear Medicine or Interventional Radiology. You're potentially going to be doing Radiology for the rest of your Career and will have loads of training if it's a decent Residency so if I were you I'd make the most of a golden opportunity like a ""Free choice"" time.  If you particularly want to do US; best advice I can give: Do LOADs of it; books are great for learning pathology but the hand-eye skills take loads of practice. And start off learning from a Sonographer if possible; they'll teach you how to US by the book and extremely well which will make it much easier later when you're exposed to Radiologists who tend to jump around much more and treat it more like a Bed-side clinical exam that they're used to from their own ward days (i.e. focusing mainly on the symptoms, looking at the rest quickly at the end) - it can make it much harder and very confusing trying to follow different Radiologist's varied approaches when starting out if you haven't got the standard protocol in your head first."

I doubt you will find a ""short list"" because many elements have the potential to contain Patient Identifiable Information (for example, the notoriously abused comments tags!), and also there are many ""private creator"" Attributes made by different vendors (e.g. For images coming from specific scanners and machines).

Breaking of the catheter due to thoracic outlet doesn't happen when IR places it in the IJ. Your case looks like the entire catheter came off of the port so somebody probably didn't attach it properly. On the frontal it seems to be a straight shot at the free end, but it's actually quite anterior in the right atrium. I probably would have tried to hook it from below with a pigtail or reverse curve catheter, pull it down, and snare a free end from above. Fishing around the ventricles makes me nervous. Nice job getting it out!"
Radiology,3cicvf,Not_for_consumption,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:22:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's exactly what my attending tried, actually. We couldn't get the catheter around it. We tried to get a glidewire around the tubing and then snare the glide to mobilize it, too. We probably spent 30 min trying that approach.   He was about to say screw it and call the whole case and try again today, but then he tried to snare it directly from the distal end, and we got it the first time."

Radiology,3cj7ll,abefroman20,4,Wed Jul 8 09:38:27 2015 UTC,Timing is more important. It may be a bit brighter but if the bolus timing is off or the patient is moving then it doesn't matter. Get that technique right every time and no one will care about 300 vs 350
Radiology,3cj7ll,kungfoojesus,2,Wed Jul 8 14:24:21 2015 UTC,"We use 350 for some CTA's like runoffs, heads, and coronary studies vs only 300 for routine chest/abd/pel  stuff.  With more iodine per milli liter it should turn up brighter but honestly I don't see to much of a difference. I bet a rad would say otherwise."
Radiology,3cj7ll,Trigger2188,2,Wed Jul 8 12:35:01 2015 UTC,Traveling CT tech here.  Used both 300 and 350 for angio head and chest.  I found using either 300 or 350 worked on a case by case basis.  If you have a more slender individual 300 is fine.  For larger individuals I would use 350.  Ive found that using a dual injector with 50 ml of a saline chaser reduced streaking artifacts and kept the bolus solid (less washout).  For higher heart rates I try to go with a flow rate of at least 4.5 but my co workers don't think that's necessary but it works :P

Radiology,3cj7ll,vinny1eye,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:04:47 2015 UTC,"Been told to use 300 on CTPA studies. At first to me they looked washed out but apparently the lower density is useful in distinguishing smaller clots. Visipaque is about 3 times the price of omnipaque, so only use it for patients with borderline renal function if you have a budget to consider. Will try checking the Hounsfield units to see if there is a noticeable difference."

Recently, there was a young patient who complained of vertigo and was referred for MRI of her Brain wo contrast. We couldn't change the MD's order, but saw abnormal signal on T2 FLAIR sequence upper left parietal area. We ran single voxel MRS and it showed normal peaks and the Hunter's angle when compared to normal tissue. This helped her decision in stating that it was an early glioma and recommend follow up scan in 2 months. When the patient returned for another MRS, there was elevated choline peaks compared to normal tissue and last exam.  It's useful in most cases, but very time consuming.

If they see something suspicious they will schedule you for followup diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. They will do special views on the mammogram. If the finding persists on the special views they will probably do an ultrasound. If it looks suspicious they will recommend a biopsy.   They usually don't schedule biopsies the same day as ultrasounds because of logistical reasons.

Radiology,3chq3l,XRayVisionRT,3,Sat Jul 11 14:28:59 2015 UTC,"Mammographer here!   Firstly there are four categories of breast tissue, from extremely dense to almost entirely fatty replaced. Since this was your first mammogram, I will assume that you're in your 40's or so. Younger women tend to have denser breast tissue which is more difficult to penetrate through using x-rays in mammography. Someone women have dense breast tissue throughout their entire life. Long story short, this was you baseline exam - like you said, there are no prior mammograms to compare. Mammography heavily relies on prior mammos for comparison from year to year to track any obvious changes. It is very common for women with less than three prior exams to be called back for additional images. Lymph nodes can be found in most mammos, but can only be truly evaluated by a focal ultrasound. Spot compression images in mammography help spread out overlapping breast tissue that is difficult to identify if there is something there or not. Doing both the additional images in Mammo and the US is important. Needle biopsy (either done under US or sterotactically with mammo) takes special equipment and trained radiologists and techs. Don't let the lack of those services at your office discourage you! Hopefully you won't even need a procedure, or at least you should need it done often. And the radiologist will determine if you need a biopsy done, not your PCP. It seems like a long work around, but YOU'RE WORTH IT! You don't want to go through a biopsy if it's something that can be ruled out with some additional imaging. If you have questions, ask the Mammo tech!  Hope that helps answer some questions. Best of luck!"

After that the patient goes home. The radiologist reads it and the report is sent to the ordering doctor for them to decide how to proceed (biopsy vs follow up imaging).   The biopsy is never done the same day, the patient is scheduled for a different day to do the biopsy (usually within a week if indicated).    I would stay with the same imaging place to get the follow up ultrasound and Mammo and then go to the separate practice to get the biopsy.   But I'm just a sonographer what do I know   ¯_(ツ)_/¯"

Are the mediae and distal phalanges on the 5th joined, or is this an illusion because of how the toe is aligned?"
Radiology,3cchxn,jesssmith4,2,Tue Jul 7 21:52:24 2015 UTC,Red circles are fractures. What metatarsal head are you referring to?

Radiology,3c8t4f,desmopressin,11,Sun Jul 5 23:44:56 2015 UTC,"Frustrations with other physicians is by no means a problem reserved for radiologists.    Medicine inpatient gets dumped on by everybody. They admit manage HTN for orthopedic surgeons and discharge patients for them. Trauma surgery babysits trauma patients while the respective sub-specialists operate on their respective parts. The subspecialists get shitty consults all day. For example, ENT for nosebleeds, colorectal for hemorrhoids that turned out to be condyloma accuminata (this happened to me) Anesthesia... the surgeons don't even know anesthesiologists' names. They get pressured by admin for faster OR turnaround times. Their cases, which they spend a great deal of time setting up the OR for, get canceled sometimes on a whim. The CRNAs take all the easy cases, so that means less Sudoku time for them. Ophthalmologists complain that no one looks into the eye or does an eye exam for a consult (and it's true!).    I'm glad that for the most part my conversations are with other clinicians who are generally pretty good - although I can't say this for all institutions. I don't miss having conversations with insurance company MDs to justify an extra ICU day or to justify why we need a particular imaging study. I don't miss babysitting a patient for days (or over the weekend) waiting for a spot to open up at rehab or a SNF.   I'm at a busier residency program but my life is still better than 90% of my my non-radiology friends.   I take like 30 seconds to glance thru/describe incidentalomas. Quick glance, look at the prior, see they said about it. Is it changed? no? boom: ""Left adrenal adenoma is unchanged.""   Don't feel like a ""clinician""? I would try to ditch the clinician/nonclinician nomenclature. I'm trying to fight the slow dwindle of my clinical skills. They're still important. Many of the people ordering the studies don't know what the next step is in management for the findings we provide. ""What does mesenteric panniculitis mean?"" ""What do I do with this small pneumothorax?"" When you give a well thought-out opinion on what they should do, they are generally very appreciative.  You sound like you need a vacation.

Radiology,3c8t4f,weasler7,4,Mon Jul 6 00:38:54 2015 UTC,"What stage are you in your training?  I'm not an Attending, but I did feel similar to you a couple of years ago but that was very early on during my training - years 1 and 2 (I'm now in year 4 of 5). I was running around like a blue-arsed fly all the time and I felt all I was doing all day, every day was shitty and boring tasks. Most of my days were running around sorting out clinician request messes, stuck doing Ultrasound lists or really tedious barium lists, and getting squeezed out of the interesting work all the time. For example in my acute CT sessions I was always dumped with the cancer follow up scans. Also I didn't get backed up and supported when things went wrong (usually pointless dick waving competitions with clinicians). In retrospect much of it was to do with being junior - shit really does flow down hill and when you're on the bottom in terms of seniority all the crap gets dumped on you. Adding to that you're not trusted to do anything really interesting and are left the boring jobs. I too missed being a physician (for me it was because I'd at least felt like I was doing something useful on the wards!) and I too dreaded coming in to work, and god did I hate my exams; I really wanted to quit and in fact I started serious plans to leave. I thought ""this is it, this is what Radiology is all about, f**k radiology"".   But for me things rapidly got much much better when I moved up to year 3 and became more senior. Instead of dealing with all the crap, it all suddenly became a much smaller part of the job. I now have much more time to do interesting bits of Radiology and my training time is now much more protected and at a higher and more stimulating level. I literally love what I get to do now - it's been like night and day; I never imagined I would actually enjoy Radiology as much as I do now. As I'm a senior trainee I get trusted to do the interesting and complex work, I get to report interesting and unusual MRIs and CTs, I now get to help train and supervise the more junior trainees, I get to lead MDT meetings and actually offer my opinion and am listened to, and I get time to develop skills in areas I'm interested in (rather than always doing grunt work). There are still shit days but every job has a portion of routine, boring or just crap work, but for me the really crap stuff is now a tiny proportion of my week, and most my time is now spent doing stuff I truly love (and it still surprises me how much I actually love my job now).   I don't know where you are in your training; maybe none of this applies to you and you're a year out from becoming an attending. But to be honest either way the best advice I can suggest is talk to someone on your scheme about how you're feeling - a more senior Resident or an Attending you really respect. It can be so easy to get stuck in a cycle of doom and gloom (been there, done that!), and think this is the way it's always going to be - maybe some perspective from other people you trust and know might help. And there is also always the possibility that Radiology just isn't for you - and that's fine if that's the case, but again speaking to other people might help you work that out so you can do something about it. But whatever you do, don't suffer in silence and slowly be broken down by it - I know how hard that is and how it can really impact on every part of your life like a cancer. Better to deal with it head on: can it get better or is it time to move on?"

Sorry to be pernickity but I think it's important to be precise here to avoid confusion: my understanding of the evidence is that statement is not true. Modern Low and Iso Osmolar contrast agents are associated with much lower risk of Contrast Induced Nephropathy, not no risk. So Creatinine will remain an important risk stratification tool (alongside the myriad of other risk factors) - even if fewer people will be affected overall, there is still a risk and still an onus on us to reduce the risk where possible by not using contrast if it's not really needed. So yes I agree there may well be some relaxation/a lower general threshold for accepting contrast use in such patients (I'm already seeing that in my hospital), but there is still a problem there that we must remain aware of."
Radiology,3bxd01,drag99,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:40:33 2015 UTC,"Which evidence are you talking about that demonstrates clinically significant kidney damage from modern contrast agents? Most of the literature I've seen, even for the older agents is very low quality, and very few could even demonstrate clinically significant outcomes. I think it was the April 2013 edition of Radiology that had two articles from the same group out of Mayo. One was a meta-analysis demonstrating that there was no evidence for contrast induced nephropathy. The other was a huge retrospective cohort study demonstrating no significant difference in outcomes or creatinine levels for those that received contrast, even when they broke it down to specific ""high-risk"" subgroups. They even utilized patients receiving multiple studies during the study's time period as their own controls and they too demonstrated no significant difference. I won't be so bold as to say contrast induced nephropathy isn't a real entity, but I don't think it's wrong to say you probably aren't going to blow up anyone's kidneys, and at worst you are probably causing a mild AKI."
Radiology,3bxd01,OrangutansLibrary,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:33:25 2015 UTC,"In the April issue both studies were retrospective cohort studies, both were large studies, and they contra-dict one another.   Firstly the conclusion of the study ""Contrast Material–induced Nephrotoxicity and Intravenous Low-Osmolality Iodinated Contrast Material"" paper (Davenport et al) is as follows (from the abstract):   Intravenous low-osmolality iodinated contrast material is a nephrotoxic risk factor, but not in patients with a stable SCr level less than 1.5 mg/dL.   The second paper ""Intravenous Contrast Material–induced Nephropathy: Causal or Coincident Phenomenon?"" states (in the full conclusion)   ""In conclusion, our findings directly question the causal relationship between intravenous contrast material administration and AKI. While our data cannot directly refute the existence of intravenous CIN, they indicate that accepted SCr-based definitions of CIN cannot identify this phenomenon as a distinct clinical entity.""   Importantly they go on to suggest further Randomised control study to investigate further. It's a suggestive & interesting paper, but it is not sufficient on it's own to change clinical practice, particularly when there is plenty of other evidence in the opposite direction to muddy the water further.  If a meta-analysis has been published on this topic I'd be very interested to see it but I'm not aware of one myself? At present I remain unaware of any conclusive evidence that would lead me to change my practice nor to entirely dismiss the risk of damaging someone's kidneys with newer contrast agents. Even if unconvinced by the current evidence or practice I think the precautionary principal has to apply here; we can't change practice in this area without knowing for certain that it's safe to do so because the potential consequences if we're wrong are very serious."
Radiology,3bxd01,drag99,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:48:12 2015 UTC,"http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.12121460  The meta-analysis from the Mayo group. Also, I don't think there has ever been enough evidence to definitively prove the presence of the entity CIN to begin with unless you include intra-arterial contrast studies with no control groups, as the so-called ""plenty of evidence""."
Radiology,3bxd01,OrangutansLibrary,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:49:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing, I've not seen that study before. Again it's a study that points in the direction of CIN being generally safe for the vast majority of patients but in the conclusions I note some crucially important limitations in their findings. Most crucial is the heterogeneity of the definition of renal insufficiency between the studies - it's impossible to separate out any difference in risk for patients with low renal insufficiency and high that may actually exist within the data sets. Some studies defined baseline renal insufficiency as >1.5mg/dl while others used tighter CKD criteria and categorised the patients. This is a crucially important point - we're already dealing with the risk of an uncommon event and the current orthodoxy (and even the findings of some of the studies used in the meta analysis) is that it's the patients with the severest underlying renal insufficiency that are at greatest risk of CIN following CT contrast. This study does not and cannot answer this crucial question.  The largest renal impairment study used in the Meta-analysis, (Bruce et al 2010, DOI:10.2214/AJR.08.1413), did address this question and did find a statistically significant increase in CIN in CKD stage 4-5 patients who received Iohexal (Omnipaque) although none in the use of Iodixanol (Visipaque).   And that is the salient point - yes newer agents have been shown to be essentially safe in patients with low and moderate renal  impairment (and the meta-analysis findings point in this direction) but it's the patients with severe renal impairment patients where the level of risk remains uncertain. It's a notoriously difficult area to study because there are no Randomised Control Trials (due to ethical considerations). But Bruce et al sum up the current position very well in their conclusion:   We therefore conclude that in routine clinical practice,  iodixanol  (and  likely  several  other current-generation  agents)  can  be  administered to patients with mild to moderate kidney disease with minimal additional risk of  acute kidney injury over the baseline risk of kidney  injury,  as  in  our  cohort  who  did  not receive  contrast  material.  The  risk  of  contrast-induced  nephrotoxicity  is  not  trivial, and we certainly do not endorse cavalier use  of  contrast-enhanced  CT.  However,  patients who  would  be  excluded  from  a  contrast-enhanced  CT  examination  because  they  have moderate kidney disease may safely undergo contrast-enhanced CT with iodixanol or one of the other newer low-risk agents.   So to be clear, coming back to the start of this:   but you aren't going to destroy anyones kidneys with modern day contrast...   The evidence as far as I understand it (including everything posted) is that in mild to moderate renal impairment the use of modern contrast is established as safe but that no study has said there is beyond any doubt no risk in patients with severe renal impairment. And while it certainly remains controversial (as it has been for years), the precautionary principal has to apply until we are certain it is safe. We know these are still nephrotoxic drugs (Meta-analysis comparison of LOCM agents in Radiology 2009 illustrates this nicely), and it's well established they carry quantifiable risks at high does in arterial administration but what we still don't know is whether they're completely safe in low dose venous CT levels in severely renal impairment patients. The hippocratic oath says first do no harm; patients with CKD 4 and 5 have the most to lose here because if we damage their kidneys they're also the ones with the potential to have the worst outcomes - Dialysis or even death. Until we know it's safe we have to continue mitigating against that risk by exercising caution and the onus is on research to clearly show it's safe before we change practice."

Radiology,3bxd01,shadowa4,5,Fri Jul 3 03:38:14 2015 UTC,"At my hospital job, I work X-Ray and occasionally pick up shifts in CT whenever they need help so I get to see all the excessive ordering that goes on with both modalities. Our hospital got the bright idea to start using NPs and PAs at the triage area instead of having physicians assess the patient first. Half the time they're fresh out of NP/PA school so you're constantly having to call and verify orders or even go over their heads and run things through the radiologist first, which they then will call the PA/NP and give them a stern talking. Abdominal pain with suspected appendicitis? Let's order a CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis with and without contrast. Possible stroke? CTA Brain/Chest. Suspected AAA? CT Abd/Pelvis with no contrast. These are just a few examples, I really miss when they had the doctors doing the intake on all triage patients."
Radiology,3bxd01,ZonaMedic,4,Fri Jul 3 00:46:16 2015 UTC,Our NPs like to order MRIs post CTs with 3D reconstruction to evaluate fractures.  I don't understand this...I thought CTs provided better bony resolution than MRIs.  What's the point of additional imaging if you already know it's broken?
Radiology,3bxd01,ZonaMedic,3,Fri Jul 3 02:16:51 2015 UTC,Many still believe that MR > CT in all scenarios. The reality is that they are entirely different imaging methods with their own strengths and weaknesses.
Radiology,3bxd01,epsilion11,0,Fri Jul 3 05:57:39 2015 UTC,"Triage is primarily a nursing role. And it's what we're good at. It's evidence based. Physicians, for the most part, spend way too much time assessing to work up an H&P rather than hitting the key points and narrowing down a focused physical exam. They're also more expensive, and honestly have other things to do (like disposing patients and entering orders) when nursing performs this role and does it damn well. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0099176707006836  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574626712000894  Anyone in triage should have a reasonable amount of experience in EM (2-3 years) before going through ESI training and a preceptor ship to work up in triage. We DO have a physician in triage, who is always an attending. He/she is responsible for dropping inital orders on patients so that we can get the ball rolling on their POC as soon as possible. This improves both patient satisfaction and outcomes... But, it takes a TEAM of people who are experienced and trust each other. But don't hate on a job title and pine for the MDs. I know plenty of idiots in white coats... With all kinds of different letters after their names.   I'm sorry that you're had a negative experience with your co-workers. But, don't generalize and say that NPs don't know what they're doing. It seems like your issue is moreso with inexperienced people being put out in the Frontline. If we had a new grad nurse/MD/NP/PA doing anything out in triage, I'm sure it wouldn't be pretty. But we don't do that, because it isn't best practice.   Being called a mid-level and insinuating that generally inferior after 8-10 years of training is also something the profession is getting away from. It's a different role, and shouldn't be looked at that way. Do some research on the profession before you bag it.   We all get along really well in my emergency department. We fill our roles and complement one another."

Be kind to your colleagues. Horizontal violence in medicine has gone on long enough.   Time for everyone to get their heads out of their asses and be decent human beings and co-workers. If you can't be pleasant, then just don't be an ass. Discuss the orders with them.  Opening up a dialogue does wonders and creates a more cohesive work environment.   EDIT: a word"

Radiology,3bwnnt,MastadonInfantry,3,Thu Jul 2 19:34:36 2015 UTC,"One of those authors works at my institution. We get interesting lectures about the different types of contrast agents. It all makes a ton of sense when you see the structure of them.   Prohance is pretty much the safest agent there is, at least as far as we can tell. If you look at the structure of prohance, you'll notice that the gad atom is held inside of an organic ""cage"" (for lack of a better word) - all those bonds greatly stabilize the gad atom within the molecule and substantially decrease the chance of significant dissociation of gadolinium. This is generally a good thing because free gad is what's suspected to cause NSF. There has never been a single case report of Prohance causing NSF.  Contrast this agent with something like Omniscan - the gadolinium atom is hanging off the end of the molecule. The result of this design is that you're much more likely to have a free gad atom dissociate and flutter off into the nether to do generally Bad ThingsTM like cause NSF."

Radiology,3bwnnt,chem_deth,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:58:46 2015 UTC,"Haha! Cute but that's not quite the answer. I'm not an inorganic chemist, but here's more detail from my friends Greenwood and Earnshaw:   The coordination chemistry of the large, electropositive LnIII ions is complicated, especially in solution, by ill-defined stereochemistries and uncertain coordination numbers.   They go on to mention that typically, complexes with N-donor ligands (as well as O- donors) are usually more stable to hydrolysis. The most important thing you missed though is the fact that the Wikipedia article on Gadodiamide represents the complex in two dimensions, which is just shorthand. In reality, the structure is three dimensional. The Gd3+ atom is not hanging off the edge of the molecule. And by the way, LnIII means any lanthanide in the III oxidation state (3+ charge).  The presence of other ligands in the blood, the blood's pH, the solution the contrast agent is kept in, etc. are all factors that affect its stability. If you want any more detail you should head over to /r/chemistry , which I suggest you do!"
Radiology,3bwnnt,Iatros,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:52:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. I'll be sure to tell the guy at my institution that his lectures are incorrect and don’t convey the precise technically accurate explanation (which is, by the way, clearly simpler to understand and explain to people who are not experts in the field). It’s just like when I’m consenting a patient – I'm sure to use all the technical words and medical jargon so they totally understand me.  I think it’s not very obvious to anyone with a background in the biological sciences that the entire basis of the interactions of molecules is based on their three-dimensional shape. We certainly never learned that the structure of a molecule is important in terms of its functioning. Thanks for pointing out that the 2-D structures on Wikipedia are just schematic representations. I was laboring under the falsehood that they weren’t. We certainly never covered anything like that in immunology class."

Then you get offended and hostile?  The ""hanging off the end of the molecule"" part is not right in any sense. You can't dumb it down that way. What you could say is that the behaviour of these complexes in solution is not straightforward and a biological environment makes things even more complicated. That's a safe, true, non technical statement.  Why the hostility?"

You see unlike plates, rods, or hemi replacement, reverse total shoulders don't rely on Tuberosity healing for restoration of motion. The patient will still be able to elevate their arm. If you look below the stem there is also a cement restrictor, and you can see cement. Primary reverse total shoulders are press fit (at least in the U.S., cement is still popular in Europe). And once again their is no proximal bone left, indicating it was removed, if it was cut out with a saw it would be along the anatomical neck. Either way that is total dislocated."

I used to think I couldn't move things around or look under drapes, but you can. Be more assertive. If you're doing a gamma nail and the opposite foot is in your way, most of the time it can be moved.  Ask anesthesia and the nurse to help you.  If the bovie or a step or something is keeping you from coming in, move that shit.  If you don't know how much room you have under the table and there are no surgeons in the way, peep up under that drape!

This projectile is quite long and only shows minimal blooming at the deformed end. A round nose projectile wouldn't be nearly as cylindrical.

In seven years imaging trauma patients, and many, many gun shot wounds, I've never seen anyone shot with a wadcutter. In my (anecdotal) experience, .22 is most common, then various centerfire round nose bullets, then proper defensive hollow points.  So basically, it's a bullet, but not a terribly common one. And given the innumerable variety of foreign bodies one sees inside of people when working in radiology, this is not a shape I would jump right to the conclusion that it is a bullet.  This would be a much more common and obvious appearance or perhaps something like this for a hollow point.  Again, this is all anecdotal."

Radiology,3b7zmj,OrangutansLibrary,3,Sat Jun 27 12:54:32 2015 UTC,"Ah, now I see the dilemma for this year's fourth year students. Honestly, this is probably going to suck for you guys. First, you're going to have to make sure you apply to programs that currently have IR fellowships, and preferably more than one spot. These programs shouldn't have a problem starting up the IR/DR residency. You'll want to talk to someone from IR to confirm this (ideally whoever's going to be the PD), confirm they've applied for accreditation, and discuss all the things you'd discuss when interviewing for fellowship now. That would include things like number and variety of procedures, whether they have a consult service, do you get PAD experience, CT/US procedures, neuro, etc.?  The problem with this is that by doing so, you're automatically telling the PD that you're going to transfer after your PGY-4 year. I don't think most DR PDs are going to be thrilled about matching someone like this, as it's taking someone from the call pool (even if there's not much call R4), someone who can cover essential rotations, etc. You've also got the problem of more than one of your classmates wanting to transfer and there not being enough spots. I'm not sure how to handle that other than to hedge your bets and say you're ""thinking"" about IR but aren't sure and want all your options open.  At the minimum, I'd recommend going somewhere that is doing ESIR so you don't have to do an extra year. Two IR years would probably be preferable, but all current fellows are only doing one, so I don't think you'd really be at a disadvantage. ESIR is also theoretically more structured than DR residency is now (e.g. have to have 500 procedures), so it's still probably better in the long run than the current system. I know some people going into fellowship from my class (R4 next week) that will only have done 4-5 IR rotations (half the recommended amount).  The transition sounds like it has the potential to be a huge clusterf*ck. At some point there's probably going to be a junior IR resident and a ""senior"" fellow under the old system. How are they going to make sure the senior gets an adequate number of procedures and the junior is not just used for scut? How are current IR programs with only one fellow position going to handle it? I'm glad I'm not going to be a part of it."
Radiology,3b87ce,shipwreck_misery,2,Fri Jun 26 19:24:38 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit confused... A Lauenstein is essentially a frog's leg view (so the pelvis is AP and the hip abducted etc) while a False Profile is a view of the profile of the head and neck of the femur (and not the acetabulum hence in false profile; the pelvis should be oblique). The images shouldn't look identical? Also a standing Lauenstein?  Anyway Lauenstein is to look at the relationship between the femur and the acetabulum, the False Profile is to get an optimal look at the femoral head and neck; it shows their surfaces particularly well which can be good if you suspect an impingement scenario for example.  EDIT: Here we go: this brazilian article on femoroacetabular impingement syndromes summarises the conventional radiographs well.

Radiology,3b1km8,bonedoc59,11,Thu Jun 25 19:16:16 2015 UTC,Scapholunate advanced collapse Scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse  Both result in a disruption of the normal mechanics of the proximal carpal row.  Essentially the scaphoid assumes a flexed position.  The lunate assumes an extended position.  This is known as a DISI deformity.  Both result in arthritic conditions of the wrist.  Typically these progress from the radial styloid ulnarly.   The above procedure results in the capitate articulating with the lunate facet of the radius.  Source: I do this procedure

For syncope and dizziness, the head CT is often kinda worthless. True syncope is a cardiac workup first with EKG and echo, then a neurological workup if the cardiac stuff is negative.  In trauma head CT is obviously a very good idea.   Headache is hit or miss - it depends on what they're thinking about. Sudden onset of worst headache of life = SAH until proven otherwise. Tension headache with no neuro symptoms = waste of a CT."

I can still do brains & cervical spines in 20 minutes with no first level (the major difference I notice is the diffusion is almost a 2 minute scan, 1st level it would be around 1 minute.  Axial Flair is slightly longer too).  I don't make the protocols.  They are so concerned about RF burns nothing is rarely scanned on first level unless it's on our GE scanners.

Radiology,3ayoz3,abcbrakka,2,Wed Jun 24 16:56:16 2015 UTC,Why a CT scan? Ultrasound is the superior choice in this case. Ultrasound is more specific in lymph node diagnostic and you can do a guided core biopsy (english is not my native language but i mean a biopsy with a thick needle so you can get histologic specimen and not cytologic).

Radiology,3ayoz3,abcbrakka,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"Also pathology is the only way to tell if it is malign or not! Unless you wholebody ct and find multiple nodes.

If it grows in 6 weeks come back early."

Radiology,3ayoz3,abcbrakka,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:50:44 2015 UTC,Ultrasound is much more able to discern between potentially malign characteristics. With CT you can only see how big it is (>1cm is potentially evil) if its necrotic (more evil) or hypervascular (not specific). Ultrasound can find much more.  I would image it with ultrasound. If it has malign characteristics I would biopsy it. It pathology of the biopsy is malign I would probably do a CT.  But if you and your doc want a ct as first choice I would do it with intravenous contrast as it is superior to not using it in visualizing neck anatomy.

I'm just saying that in this age of more radiologists being tasked to do their own proofreading after working with imperfect voice-to-text technology, errors like this are likely to become more common.  I only worry about them if they truly change the meaning of a report."

This recipe is for 2-3 breads.  Google translate from this page http://paindemartin.blogspot.se/2008/01/den-godaste-sndagsfrukosten.html  All temperatures are in Celsius.  Sorry about the bad formatting, i am not skilled.  Day 1, evening 100 g sourdough starter 100g rye flour 200 g water Mix in a jar or bowl and let stand at room temperature overnight. This sourdough start becoming somewhat looser than I usually do, but to get the right amount of water in the dough should start doing this, then with two parts water and one part flour.  Day 2, Morning / Morning 500 g of lukewarm water 20 g salt 400 g of walnuts 400 g sourdough rye (mixture from yesterday) 400 g of rye flour 500g plain flour (I used special) Mix everything except the walnuts for about 8 minutes on medium speed. The dough is quite weak / loose, quite in order. Pour the nuts and mix a further 4 minutes on low speed, you do not want to be nuts to go down too much. Wrap and let rise in the bowl for about 4 hours. My left to stand in the cupboard above the fridge where it usually is 21-22 °.  Day 2, afternoon / evening 1. Pour the dough out onto a floured surface and divide in two. The dough is of course a bit special with all the nuts, but I tried to tear my round to round balls as best we could. Sprinkle a little flour (I took a bit plain rye flour). Place on a towel and let rise for about 2 hours. After about 1 hour, turn on the oven to 275 °.    Sear the loaves few times, and then slid into the oven! Throw in a little water (or a few ice cubes) on a plate in the bottom of the oven. Turn down the heat to 230 ° for about 10 minutes, open the door and let out the steam from the oven. I think it's fine when the bread gets lots of color, but add some aluminum foil if you think they are getting a little too dark on the surface. After 35 minutes had my bread has reached an internal temperature of 98 °, then I took them out (that which can of course vary from oven to oven, and you have a meat thermometer is handy, I think)."

The PET/CT led to her getting a pelvic lymph node dissection in addition. The lymph nodes were actually hot on pet because she recently had tattoos of her bilateral lower extremities. Also, the lymph node dissection found micrometastases.   Doesn't sound that bad... As for the call made on PET... It sounds reasonable. Unless you want rads to hedge with some ridiculous statement every time.   Probably a more accurate title is ""lymphatic reaction caused by tattoo ink leads to increased radio tracer uptake by lymph nodes""."

Unless you get lucky, you'll still need to choose between location and job description (i. e.  what you will be reading on a day to day basis) because finding the perfect job in your dream location is probably not going to happen in today's environment.

Radiology,3aqjn3,weasler7,2,Mon Jun 22 20:07:31 2015 UTC,"The short answers to your questions: 1.  I'm a recent graduate.  Fellowship completed and starting my career in a few weeks. 2.  It isn't necessary to do a fellowship to get a job. * 3.  Finding a job wasn't difficult.     to more specifically address your second question: It depends on what you want.  Are there jobs out there without fellowship training?  Yes, but as has already been stated you might have to go to a rural/underserved location. That's not necessarily bad, though, cause you can make a lot of money out there if that's your thing.   I came from a smaller program. Three years ago, three out of four of our graduates went straight into private practice.  One did a neuro fellowship and is now also in private practice.  Two years ago, two went to private practice and two did fellowships (one now in academic practice, the other in private).  Last year, all four did fellowships.  This year, one is going to private practice while the other three are doing fellowships.  Everyone has found a job, and good ones at that.  Do what you want to do professionally.  No one can answer this question for you. Don't do a fellowship you hate ""just because"" or you could end up hating your job.  The job market is about to blow up for radiologists, in my opinion. The recession is wrapping up, and all those baby boomers that had to polish their nest eggs a few extra years are about to start retiring.    Check out the ACR career center.  Network.  Don't be an asshole.  Keep in contact with your staff.  You'll find something.  Learn EVERYTHING during residency. There's a lot of variability in how radiology is practiced from group to group.  You don't want to be the guy they've recently hired or are looking to hire but you can't, for instance... Read mammo, put in a port, do a fluoroscopic LP, read high risk OB ultrasound, read a cardiac MRI, etc...  There are some residencies out there where due to the nature of how they practice, you might never/rarely see things that could be your potential bread and butter later, so be a sponge in residency.   If I had to do it all again (but thank god I don't!) I'd still choose radiology.  I'm getting into it during a lean time, but the future of radiology is looking great."

(As in if you think you have it yet you're able to casually post on Reddit without being in the er, you probably don't have it)  edit not sure why I'm being downvoted. Everything I said is factual, i had intussusception which was diagnosed and treated with a barium enema.

But thank you for thinking that just because it is uncommon in adults, and that because I was posting on reddit, that I of course could not have it. That's the same attitude of the doctor who allowed me to go home with a bowel obstruction in the making...."
Radiology,3akk7x,Moofishmoo,9,Sun Jun 21 11:16:27 2015 UTC,"So I work as a resident in a large inner city Emergency Department.  I get that right now you feel your care was mismanaged or perhaps your medical team misunderstood you or were some how callous, because ""allowed [you] to go home with a bowel obstruction in the making.""  Unfortunately medicine is a very imperfect science.  I can't comment on how these particular people spoke to you or their attitude.  But it's entirely reasonable that if you, are a young person, normal vitals, benign exam, and normal j-tube xray, to discharge with (and here is the super important part) APPROPRIATE RETURN PRECAUTIONS.  They should talk to you before discharge and explain that right now you have normal vitals, a benign exam, and normal j-tube xray.  Right now we don't see any evidence of a life threatening cause of your pain, however we also don't know exactly what's causing your pain. So it's important that if anything gets worse, or you develop a fever, can't tolerate liquids, can't pass a bowel movement, notice blood in your stool or vomit, you have to come right back to the ER and we will reevaluate you.    Sounds like your pain did get worse and your ""stomach became swollen"", so you did the right thing, and got reevaluated.  With those new findings, you got admitted to the hospital.  Also sounds like you had a very unusual diagnosis and the way you described you symptoms it sounds like numerous teams of doctors thought small bowel obstruction was low on the list of potential diagnoses, because it sounds like from your comments they choose to do an EGD to evaluate placement and/or correct the placement of the j-tube before a CT scan.  If based on your history and exam/labs they thought SBO (the term for the obstruction caused by the intussecption) was likely, they would have ordered the CT scan.  Also, more to your question - abdominal xrays can sometimes show indirect evidence of an SBO or intussception, but they are not sensitive.  Meaning if you don't see those signs on the xray , it does not rule out those diagnoses.  CT scan is the study of choice for SBO/intussception.  Seems like, the team was more concerned for dislodgment of the j-tube, however so instead of ordering a very high radiation exam on a young person they went for low radiation studies they thought would identify and treat the most likely reason for your pain (tube dislodgment)."

Radiology,3ainsx,Minia15,12,Sat Jun 20 15:42:58 2015 UTC,"The thing they put on your chest is a Bismuth shield.  It's to help protect breast tissue from some of the radiation from the scan (in theory... their value/contribution is still debated).  As for why they didn't put it on before the first picture... the first two images they take (Scouts) are to plan the scan. You don't want to scan/radiate too much (more than the doctor needs to see), and you don't want to scan too little (and miss something).  Those first two images are used by the CT Scanner's computer to calculate how much dose is needed. Are you skinny? It can use a bit less dose. Are you a little heavier? It may need a bit more dose to take a good scan. Too little radiation may make for a poor/blurry image, and then the radiologist can't make a good diagnosis. So the scanner will calculate (and maybe with some tweaks of the settings by the techs); how to keep the dose as low as possible, but with just enough to get good readable images.  So if they had put the breast/bismuth shield on before the first setup picture (Scout), it will block some of the radiation, and the scanner will think you're a lot heavier than you really are, and then unnecessarily increase the dose of the actual scan. Let me put it another way... the techs know there is a person in the scanner, but to the scanner, it's simply an object of various densities (rib bones are denser than lungs, for example). The scanner will generate enough radiation to pass through those densities to get the images. If they put the breast shield on first (where it is going to calculate how much dose is needed); the scanner thinks the thing inside it is a lot denser, and therefore will give more radiation to compensate.  The techs who took your scan used the breast shield correctly! Good job to them. As for it being louder after they put the shield on, that is the actual scan; the scanner mechanism is rotating around inside that big plastic/fiberglass shell you're laying in. It sort of sounds like like a jet engine whine (but not as loud)."

Trust me, it's a million times more likely that they were just putting together notes for the radiologist and wanted to get your medical history straight before you left. I try very hard in my own work to ask every possible question before I start an exam, because anything you ask a patient afterward can be interpreted as a problem. Unfortunately, sometimes we get busy and forget something, and as scary as it is to get a question like that right after the test, it's better than getting a phone call an hour later. The only diagnosis is the one you get from the radiologist. Don't worry about anything the techs said."

Radiology,3ainsx,huderons,14,Sat Jun 20 22:07:49 2015 UTC,"After about two scans they came over and put something on my chest and the machine seemed to be ""on more"" and louder and spinning more.    That all sounds like a normal CT. Some positioning scans then the actual CT which involves many more pictures.   As I got up the one lady said to the other ""its been 8 months? and the other said yea.   They may have just been chatting to themselves. Perhaps about the guy one's been dating. Remember you can't hear everything they say in the little control room.   And then the one lady asked me as I was leaving ""You havent been coughing up blood have you?""    Perhaps she was just getting some more information for the report or clarifying what was on the request.   Which of course lead me to believe they saw a tumor and has me confused. I just want to know what they might have seen, cause they wouldn't ask that if it was completely clear.    A tumour is very very unlikely at your age so keep that in mind.  A pulmonary embolism (blood clot in your lung) or an infection would be more likely if there is anything. Both are treatable.  Also remember that while the CT radiographers are good at taking CTs they are not qualified to read them and report them.  Your doctor should be in touch soon and no news is good news."

Radiology,3ainsx,etrtr,2,Sat Jun 20 20:44:59 2015 UTC,The way they do a ct scan is they take two preliminary images to do get an overview of chest to plan the scan. Then they run the scan for the third time to get the actual ct images  that would be louder on the third time for sure. Not certain about what they put on your chest. What did it look like?

Radiology,3afp30,vaporking23,9,Sat Jun 20 00:06:00 2015 UTC,"Won't make a difference. Scatter radiation comes from within the body. There is no way to block that. Also, the primary X-ray beam will only expose 2 cm outside of where is directed towards so unless is pointed straight at their head shielding will do nothing. ACR actually recommends shielding only if the primary beam is directed right at the gonads."
Radiology,3afp30,burstabcess,10,Sat Jun 20 01:13:56 2015 UTC,"Sweetie, I'm sorry about your brain mass.

I hope this reassures you, you have other things to worry about. Not radiation.x"
Radiology,3afp30,tobbel85,6,Sat Jun 20 04:19:59 2015 UTC,"Everyday exposure won't have any effect on you. As long as you don't get radiotherapy, the radiation levels are simply too low. Even multiple CTs won't have any impact. Any brain mass you have will not be affected by any levels of radiation that you encounter in everyday life.   Edit: if you ever get radiotherapy then it will aim to kill the cells in the brain mass, and that radiation will do more good than harm, and should therefore not be avoided."
Radiology,3afp30,tuckmyjunksofast,5,Sat Jun 20 01:42:11 2015 UTC,"OP, cellphones put out too little radiation to cause brain masses, the outer layer of skin absorbs the microwaves.  Common everyday radiation sources are too weak or of the wrong variety to cause health issues.  You will have to be more specific about the exact radiation that you want to deflect from your head in order for that question to be answered.  Tinfoil works for high frequencies such as cellphones and satellite signals. However the radiation can reflect off of metallic surfaces and come up from underneath you and still get to the outer layer of skin on your face and head. Lower frequencies require Faraday cages to block, such a cage would have to surround your entire body and not just your head."
Radiology,3afp30,CTallPaul,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:01:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your informative response.

I'm in a LDR and would always talk on the phone with them, so that study is why I was thinking that may have caused it in me."
Radiology,3afp30,Iatros,6,Sat Jun 20 02:49:39 2015 UTC,"Correlation does not mean causation. Even the article says it's a ""possible"" correlation. Statistics can be insightful, but there's a lot that can influence the outcome of a statistical study (ie selection bias). In a follow up statement by the first author, he says using another researchers data removes the correlation of cellphones and meningiomas.  ""Furthermore, when using cases only as in Inskip et al’s6 study, we found a significant association between the side of phone use and the side of the tumour for glioma (OR=2.40, 95% CI 1.002 to 5.73) but not for meningiomas (OR=0.77, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.22).""  Not to mention, I would be a lot more confident about their findings if multiple studies were finding the same thing. Or if it was published in a more reputable journal, but that's just me.  I currently work as a nuclear medicine researcher. During a PET and SPECT scan, a patient receives a dose of radiation and they are radioactive for a few days. This means the whole time at the hospital, my colleagues and myself are getting showered in radiation. The good news is that radiation isn't that bad. Most radioactive particles can't penetrate a piece of paper, so they don't get that far in your skin (cellphone radiation included).  You don't need to worry about any additional radiation exposure. As someone said, invest your energy in being positive and healing. Sorry about your tumor, but I'd say it's like you won the lottery once, what's the chances of winning again?   But to answer your question. The atmosphere does a great job at stopping solar radiation. So don't leave the atmosphere (ie space or air travel) and wear sunscreen. Maybe don't eat bananas (which are more radiative than post-Fukushima fish). A faraday's cage will stop lower frequency radiation like microwaves/wifi/cellphones (that's what that mesh in your microwave window is). But all those sources of radiation exposure are very weak and if they did do anything would only warm tissue up, not cause DNA damage.  In my opinion, cancer is more nurture than nature. Meaning your genes have more to do with your risk for cancer than your exposure to nature, but that's just my opinion. It's easy to get overly concerned about different sources of electromagnetic radiation. But look at some of the extreme cases where people are fine. My coworkers in the ""hot"" lab that mix doses for patients all day long for years are fine.  Edit: it's late and my response got very long, sorry if I made any mistakes"
Radiology,3afp30,pylori,5,Sat Jun 20 08:45:27 2015 UTC,"I would be a lot more confident about their findings if multiple studies were finding the same thing.

Radiology,3afp30,vagrantheather,4,Sat Jun 20 15:42:15 2015 UTC,"Mobile phones emit low frequency non-ionising radiation. That is, they are fundamentally different from x-rays or gamma-rays using in medical imaging (which are ionising and are directly harmful). It's almost impossible to block out that sort of radiation because it's pervasive, just think about over-the-air TV, radio, and WiFi signals that are also much lower frequency than ionising radiation.  The suggestions by which mobile phone emitted radiation is thought to affect areas of the body is an increase in the local temperature from the radio waves (rather than it being directly harmful to the cells). Much like having a laptop on your lap can reduce the sperm count in men through the action of heat, and that can be avoided by not placing the laptop on your lap, if you just want to be extra safe, simply do not put the phone to your head. That is, if you're talking for extended periods of time, put in a wireless/wired headset and talk to your partner through that. I find that if I'm talking to my girlfriend for hours that doing so is much more comfortable regardless of whether or not I think the radiation is problematic.  To address your question about the study, whilst these studies can and do show associations between certain factors and outcomes, they are not enough to show causation. That is they are not, in and of themselves, proof that the mobile phones cause cancer. Moreover, the study only found an increase in the highest of mobile phone users (896hrs cumulative talk time, vs 115hrs being the median) so unless you are an intense (or particularly occupational) user, the odds ratio (the chances that you'd get a brain tumour, given that you had used your phone to that extent) was not statistically different. This is one study, and the results of any single study should be taken carefully before being generalised to different people or situations. So far studies analysing the connection between mobile phones and cancer incidence have shown varying levels of correlation and so it remains to be seen whether or not they pose a risk to humans.  At the end of the day, this single study shouldn't worry you, but if you want to play it safe, use a headset and you will directly avoid the potential issue at hand. No need for any fancy head-gear or protection."

Radiology,3a8ldh,TPKK,9,Thu Jun 18 02:13:47 2015 UTC,"I'm 99.9% sure the things on your chest were receive-only array coils and do not have any transmit capability. They would have used the body transmit coil (which is not a local transmit coil and is located inside the walls of the MRI tube).  Edit: the manual you posted mentions that nerve stimulation is a known effect. Nerve stimulation is cased by fluctuating magnetic fields inducing electrical currents. This means you can feel pain when there is actually no actual cause for the pain except the otherwise harmless magnetic field fluctuations of the scan itself (if that makes sense--for example during the scan you could feel a phantom pain like your arm is burning, but your arm is not actually burning).  One thing about cardiac MRI is that it puts your head near the end on the tube where the magnetic field fluctuations are greatest.  So if the device/wires are at the ends of the tube it's much more likely to cause nerve stimulation than if it were at the middle of the scanner where magnetic field fluctuations are minimal. Anyway, I don't know a lot about your implant to know how common that sort of effect is when used in cardiac scans."

One of the best things to do would be to gain experience by having a day to a week of shadowing radiographers in a radiography department. This way, you can fully understand the role of the job and how it actually aids in the process of recovery for a patient. There may be a few cases which stand out to you on your experience week and you may want to talk about these and about aspects which you thought were interesting and talk about knowledge you gained from the experience. This could be anatomy knowledge, professional practice or anything about using radiation.You will probably be given a few hours in different modalities such as MRI, CT, ultrasound and nuclear medicine as well as general x-ray. Ask as many questions as you ca and write down the answers to reflect on and do a bit of research around each of these areas. This way, you will feel a lot more confident with questions which may be asked. As well as the generic questions about why you want to join the course and experience you have, they may ask questions about possible situations within the department, and how you would help patients and address these situations. Examples could be if a pregnant lady was worrying about the radiation given in an exposure for a hand x-ray, what would you do or explain to her? Also, questions about your knowledge of confidentiality may be asked, and the reasons you think this is implemented.  If you decide to gain some experience in a radiography department, you can ask the radiographers for a point in the right direction of what to research and areas to look into to prepare for the interviews. I hope I've helped you."

The interview for me focused a lot on patient care, and discussing potential scenarios with challenging patients."
Radiology,39sh1f,FayeBear,2,Sun Jun 14 13:47:08 2015 UTC,"Radiographers should be willing to allow work experience students in any department, and they usually welcome them with a schedule of where to go. Plus, there is usually a senior radiographer or clinical radiographer who will usually organise these types of work experiences. As lledrith said, emailing or calling the hospitals and knowing who to contact by researching online for names of staff will help you.  I had to go through interviews at each university I applied to; 5 in total. It is quite competitive and you'll find that each university has their own way of processing which students to allow onto the course. Some have written assessments which take place on the interview, others have a set list of questions to answer orally, and the ones that I found the best were ones which were like a conversation."

Radiology,39ps0m,jaldarith,2,Sat Jun 13 18:00:30 2015 UTC,"Good afternoon,  Graduated in May 2013, found a PRN (part time, as needed) job working in a hospital before the end of May.  The downsides to being a PRN is that hours are not guaranteed, and you don't accrue vacation time, sick time, or personal time--and you aren't eligible for insurance.  You do generally get an increased differential wage for being a PRN, but the amount differs based on where you are employed. Unfortunately due to the PRN differential, I have been having bad luck finding any full-time work, and when I do, I generally can't take the job because I can't afford it.  The job market may be saturated where you live, but if you are willing to move around, you can find a job anywhere.   Aside from perfecting the positioning methods taught in school and perfecting my own personal tweaks, I've learned how to use the C-arm in neurological procedures, orthopedic procedures, and general surgery.  I'm also proficient in barium studies such as barium enemas, and upper GI/small bowel studies.  I have not learned how to do special/interventional procedures yet due to my time constraints, but the opportunity is always there.  The facility you will work at may require additional skills, or even offer on-the-job training.  I have 3 PRN jobs at the moment, and my second job is at an urgent care facility.  I've learned to draw blood, give shots, administer medicines and tests, apply splints, and a whole slew of other things.  My third job is in mobile radiography and it's VERY challenging (but also the highest paying for plain films)."

Radiology,39ps0m,lapizzafeliz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:46:43 2015 UTC,"I love them both, but I like neuro more. however, there are pros and cons to each. neuro is more finesse to me: microwires, micro catheters, etc. the equipment on your field is much smaller in general. also, the cerebral arteries lose their elastic layer once they enter the cranium, so extra caution is necessary when working in the brain because the vessels are more susceptible to dissection, perforation, rupture, and trauma in general. however, neuro cases tend to be longer and our patients are under general anesthesia. I like the DSA portion of neuro and I like filming as well. I also like neuro cases because I work in an OR that has hybrid suites for these cases, and its not rare to have a ruptured aneurysm come in that turns into an emergency craniotomy. I see a lot of cool cases here in general.  I love cardiac cath because whereas in neuro we can do about 4-5 interventions in a 10 hour day. in cardiac cath, you can have 20 something cases on the board. cardiac cath is quick and makes you feel accomplished with the workload. also patients in cardiac cath are, for the most part, under local sedation. when someone has a STEMI and you open their coronaries, you can see the relief on their face - very gratifying. cons of cardiac - a lot more callbacks!  if you have anymore questions, I would be happy to answer them!"

Radiology,39kvix,Akitador,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:13:31 2015 UTC,PA is relatively easy. For lateral I find that if the patient can fully extend their arms straight above their head it is easier to adjust them. I also like to stand behind them and grab both hips and adjust from there. Small adjustments at the shoulders and hips seem to work well.

All these posts and no one mentioned that if you put the patient perpendicular to the image receptor the diverging xray beam will mean they won't appear lateral (unless you don't judge laterally by perfect superimposition of left and right posterior ribs). Depending on how wide the patient is I rotate the side furtherest from the detector slightly anteriorly so the diverging beam perfectly superimposes the posterior ribs of both sides. Somewhere between 1-5 degrees,  the wider the patient the more diverging beam so the more I rotate to compensate. Also patient arms always on the top bar if they can manage, pet peeve is humerus and arm fat over the top of the chest."
Radiology,39kvix,etrtr,3,Sat Jun 13 05:51:57 2015 UTC,"My trick for laterals is (as long as they aren't too overweight and the arm fat will be in the way) is for the patient to hold the bar with their palms facing them, it seems to make it easier to stabilize them in my opinion"

Radiology,39kvix,jsnhrl,2,Tue Jun 16 01:50:21 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it's a bit different for everyone.  Here's my habit:  PA: Have them face the bucky, adjust it to their height.  Tell them to press their chest flat as possible against the bucky, then have them put their hand on their hips.  Instruct them to roll their shoulders forward, aiming to touch the bucky.  Breath in, blow out, breath in deeply, hold, shoot.  Lat:  I usually lower the bucky an inch or so to include the costophrenics.  Rotate them 90 degress and have them reach up and grab their elbows overhead.  Now have them sidestep to reach the bucky with their left shoulder (best to actually step as people are inclined to lean over).  Place your hand on their back and adjust their rotation as needed to line them up perpendicular to the bucky.  Breath in deeply, hold, shoot."
Radiology,39kvix,Weenie,2,Fri Jun 12 15:58:16 2015 UTC,"How come you do not have them wrap their arms around? Also, I'm impressed at taking it on second inspiration like they taught us."
Radiology,39kvix,Minerva89,4,Fri Jun 12 23:07:02 2015 UTC,Wrapping the arms around doesn't usually get the scapulas off the lung fields. Rolling the shoulders forward is a reliable way of doing that.
Radiology,39kvix,adifferentjk,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:20:43 2015 UTC,"Yep. Also the lateral, it's better to have their arms above their heads holding their elbows rather than just having them holding the bar to keep the arms out of the apices. As I recall anyways."
Radiology,39kvix,Minerva89,2,Tue Jun 16 01:54:38 2015 UTC,"PA chests are pretty easy as long as your patient is cooperative. For lateral positioning, my favorite tip is to have the patient take an underhand grip on the bar (like a chin-up grip vs. a pull-up grip). You can also have them bring their elbows down in front of them at shoulder width apart. That tends to bring everything square to the bucky. If left to their own, patients tend to stick their elbows out and rest the left side on the bucky, which then pushes their body into an oblique position."
Radiology,39kvix,jaldarith,2,Fri Jun 12 16:45:23 2015 UTC,"Experience.  Other than that, the light trick where the light just peaks over the midline of their back for the lateral works.  Stretcher chest laterals - always check their shoulders. You'll likely need to rotate away from the bucky."
Radiology,39kvix,farleybear,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:33:37 2015 UTC,"Another helpful tip for stretcher laterals is after raising the head of the bed as far as is comfortable for the pt, to pump the bed up several inches and then lower just the feet.  Perfectly upright without pain to the patient."
Radiology,39kvix,Baial,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:30:32 2015 UTC,"... yea with most of our patients they might just slide off. We have sponges to keep them perfectly upright, then it's a matter of moving the stretcher and/or their shoulders."
Radiology,39kvix,Baial,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:33:10 2015 UTC,"for the PA, I have them place their chest up against the board before raising their arms or shoulders, and put about a half inch of a shoulder shadow at the top of the IR. once I have that measurement, I have them wrap their arms around the board like they're giving it a big hug, and then do the breathing.  For the lateral: I turn them 90 degrees, and if they're able to, I have them interlock their fingers behind their head, and then I have them place their elbows close together so that their arms don't add any OID. next, I line the central ray up in the hilar region, about a half inch behind their armpit. I then place both my hands on each side of their ribs with my thumbs extended toward their spine, and I  create an imaginary plane in between my thumbs, and think of a straight line when rotating them for the lateral.  I'd say I haven't had to repeat a chest xray in the last 25 attempts. It's usually the asthenic people with the super long emphysematous lungs that I have to repeat.  Please to be forgiving bad grammar. I used voice to text to write this. I hate using a phone keyboard for long posts."
Radiology,39kvix,intervenroentgen,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:25:39 2015 UTC,I second the centering up and down prior to moving the shoulders. A lot of students will have the patients roll their shoulders forward then bring the bucky so there is light above the shoulders - which may mean there is too much light above the shoulders now. Especially when it's a larger male patient or someone with big shoulders.

Radiology,39i831,anaerobyte,14,Thu Jun 11 22:04:31 2015 UTC,"I look at radiology monitors all day.  They are all calibrated to a certain luminance.  You don't actually set a brightness.  You set cd/m2 or something like that.  They also have little sensors on them that increase or decrease the backlight to keep the brightness the same.  The also have sensors on them that detect ambient light and change the brightness accordingly too.  They also come with display calibration software that checks the calibration periodically and reports it back to a server and alerts someone when it is out of whack.  I think they also spend a lot of time making sure the brightness is uniform across the whole screen.  No hot spots!  They really stand out when you're looking at it in a dark room.  I don't know that much about the science behind it to be honest though.  You actually CAN read MRI, CT and ultrasound off a regular dell monitor if it is calibrated properly.  Most of those images are 512x512 or 1024x1024.  The thing is though, it is easier to buy a monitor that is labeled as a medical monitor that has a definied calibration protocol and just stick with it.  When you start looking at the money involved in radiology ($1.7 million for an MRI scanner) is a $12k monitor really that expensive?  This is probably the most popular monitor right now.  it is 3280 x 2048, 30 inches.  the pixel pitch is 0.1995 mm which is like 127 ppi.  you can read the specs yourself.    it is a really nice monitor, and probably looks better than any other one i've seen except the retina imacs (218 ppi).  http://www.barco.com/en/Products-Solutions/Displays-monitors-workstations/Medical-displays/Diagnostic-displays/6MP-diagnostic-color-display-system.aspx#!"

Radiology,39i831,eugenemah,5,Fri Jun 12 13:30:12 2015 UTC,"A few additional factors to whats been mentioned by others:   There is an international ""dead pixels"" standard; Military and Hospital grade LCDs are Class 0 (NO dead pixels allowed). In the past this was an issue when consumer grade products had a tolerance for dead pixels but now most premium products are also Class 0. The contrast ratio needs to be above 600:1; again in the past this was an issue but now most consumer monitors match if not exceed this requirement. The Gray-scale range is now 10-bit depth (that's 1024 shades of grey, rather than the old 8-bit 256 shades of Gray). Crucially that gray-scale has to be calibrated to DICOM's Grayscale Standard Display Function. This is to ensure that a DICOM images gray scale will look identical on any calibrated monitor.   This is all important for Gray scale high resolution images like Plain Film. A typical Chest X-ray image is around 2k x 2.5k pixels in size (5 million pixels total or 5MP); a mammogram is even larger, often between 4k x 4k and 4k x 6k pixels (16 - 24 MP). But in reality we view such images on lower resolution displays - 3MP for standard x-rays and 5MP for mammography. Why? Cost basically - 5MP displays are still expensive and so are mainly used in mammo and we don't have displays that can display a Mammogram 1:1 full screen. Also the human eye can only even see a certain resolution - a 5MP display looks very crisp even though the mammogram is being massively scaled down. The solution is to ""zoom in"" to areas of interest in an image and view that area at native resolution."

Radiologists who read mammography can also read other modalities, but radiologists who don't meet the qualifications or have training in reading mammography images can't read mammography."
Radiology,39i831,eugenemah,2,Fri Jun 12 15:24:05 2015 UTC,"In the UK it's now a specialisation within Radiology or by trained Reporting Radiogprahers/Techs - you must do a minimum 5,000 screening cases a year OR 500 if they're symptomatic cases to be able to practice (most do way more). Mammos are complex to read because they're very big images, the findings can be very subtle (and many normal ones to sift though in screening) and it has tight margins of error between normal and abnormal (particularly in screening). I think it's similar in the USA although I think the FDA requirements are only 960 screening cases a year or in 2 years? (may have changed).  P.S. Most UK breast radiologists seem to do 50% of their time on breast and 50% on something else. And in the Breast sessions that also includes Breast Ultrasound, MRI and cancer staging CTs, although most do 1 or usually 2 sessions of just Mammography out of 5 breast sessions, and may do more Mammos during clinic sessions.

Radiology,39i8m3,neurad1,2,Thu Jun 11 22:32:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, especially on gradient echo T1 weighted images (e.g. SPGR, THRIVE, VIBE, etc).   On (slice-selective excitation) spin echo images, slowly flowing blood enhances as it behaves more like ""stationary tissue"". Rapidly flowing (e.g. arterial) blood does not normally enhance. Instead, a ""flow void"" results because the intraluminal blood has passed through the slice too rapidly to be completely excited/refocussed by the MRI sequence. One of the ways that successfully treated (gamma knife) AVMs behave over time is that more and more of their components enhance on follow up (as the blood flow decreases due to effect of the radiation therapy).   With gradient echo imaging the phenomenon is kind of the opposite....Here, inflowing blood is brighter than the (saturated) stationary tissue. This saturation of stationary spins has to do with a different sort of MRI sequence that decreases signal from stationary tissue by pulsing the tissue repeatedly and not allowing time for the protons to recover back into the main magnetic field before gradient refocussing and listening for the echo. This latter phenomenon is the basis for time of flight MR angiography. Sorry...I'm not an MRI physicist and this is not a very elegant discussion."

I mean, my opinion is biased because one of the doctors I work for is an orthopedic spine surgeon, but I would recommend ortho any day. But then again, its based on your individual need and case, really."
Radiology,39g3iv,Todesengal,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:53:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think I'd let that guy operate on me either!  Here I'd go to ortho, simply because we have a couple of guys who do a very nice minimally invasive technique. They can do a multilevel fusion through a 2 cm hole, and to a lot less to the spinal muscles. I don't know any of our neurosurgery guys who do that technique."
Radiology,39g3iv,Hypno-phile,2,Thu Jun 11 20:45:34 2015 UTC,I had minimally invasive L4-S1 fusion by a neurosurgeon and it worked out amazing.
Radiology,39g3iv,Mightisr1ght,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:44:11 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this statement. I went to an ortho because my disk had effected my leg nerves for years and getting worse. The neurosurgeon didn't really seemed as concerned and wanted surgery as a last option even though I told him I have gotten numbness in the nether regions. I'm a week into recovery now and happy I'm getting this over this now. I was on a lot of pain medication and tired of it doing nothing anymore. Also, my doctor did the L5-S1 as a note to himself. He assured me that he knew what he meant and it would help him, it doesn't exactly tell just about anyone where the exact point is"
Radiology,39g3iv,in_the_making_,3,Sun Jun 14 04:08:01 2015 UTC,"And if the radiologist has any skills, they can read axial pictures through any disc at any angle    Thanks! That seems to be the consensus opinion.  It seems I shouldn't have doubted them.   BTW, if you are thinking of having spinal surgery, I would recommend going to a neurosurgeon vs. an ortho guy. Just my 2cents...   It seems there's more orthos that do microdiscectomies than there are neurosurgeons.  And, the neurosurgeons I've looked at do all sorts of exotic brain/spine surgery.  From what I've read, I should try to find someone that spends most of their time doing microdiscectomies.  But, at this point, I'm still trying to avoid surgery."
Radiology,39g3iv,OrangutansLibrary,9,Thu Jun 11 22:09:11 2015 UTC,"With all due respect to both your Orthopod's PA and the Chiropractor, the only opinion that really matters is the reading Radiologist's. If s/he was given a clear history in the request form about your problems, and s/he has issued a report without suggesting further imaging then you can take it as read that they believed the images to be diagnostic quality. If you're not happy that they have mentioned the L5/S1 area in the report (I'd be very surprised if they haven't) or you still have doubts, I'd personally start by getting whoever requested the scan in the first place (Orthopod or Chiropracter) to ask the Radiologist to review the images and offer a clarification/opinion first - only if they can't would I even contemplate a repeat. I'd be wary of getting a repeat scan on the advice of someone who is not trained to read images.  Looking at the single image you've given; while the axials are not well aligned for L5/S1 that doesn't mean it can't be assessed. Radiologists can still read suboptimal oblique images, but also an MRI is done in 2 or 3 planes so there will be other images of that area to look at too. But as I say, the key is what the reading Radiologist thought as they had the full set of images to review."
Radiology,39g3iv,thebigslide,-5,Thu Jun 11 14:54:12 2015 UTC,"With all due respect to both your Orthopod's PA and the Chiropractor, the only opinion that really matters is the reading Radiologist's.    I'd trust an independent radiologist but not the radiologist employed by the for-profit imaging facility.   Because, I am certain they do as much as they can to keep scan times as short as possible in order to maximize profit.   Now, that may or may not include taking shortcuts that compromise the quality of the imaging, but that is  what I was trying to find out.  From what you and Presia have said, it sounds like they did not.   So, thanks!"
Radiology,39g3iv,Presia,10,Thu Jun 11 16:51:09 2015 UTC,"Because, I am certain they do as much as they can to keep scan times as short as possible in order to maximize profit   That's incorrect.  Being sloppy is a great way to get sued.  High volumes of imaging is a way to get really good.  This isn't a difficult scan, and the actual scan takes WAY longer than reading it, do your radiologist wasn't rushing at all.  Are the reference lines in your image crooked at the bottom?  Yes.  Does it matter?  No."
Radiology,39g3iv,neurad1,2,Thu Jun 11 17:54:26 2015 UTC,"Are the reference lines in your image crooked at the bottom? Yes. Does it matter? No.   OK.  That's what I wanted to know, and that seems to be the overwhelming opinion here. Thanks!"
Radiology,39g3iv,OrangutansLibrary,4,Thu Jun 11 21:46:45 2015 UTC,"If I were to scrutinize a radiologist, I would do it based on their specialty, not because of profit vs. non-profit facility.  The hospital I work for has a radiologist group that reads for 1.) hospital that is not-for-profit, 2.) their own for-profit outpatient imaging center, 3.) other outpatient imaging centers.  They read the same, regardless of which facility they are reading for.  Now if I DID have to scrutinize a radiologist, it would be for what kind of specialty they have.  In smaller towns/hospitals, there are radiologists that read and do everything.  In bigger hospitals/cities, they tend to have specialized radiologists - some are MSK guys (muscular skeletal - think sport medicine and joints), body guys (chest/abdomen/etc), and neuro guys (brain/spine).  A neuroradiologist is ideally who you would want to read your lumbar spine MRI."

Radiology,39g3iv,neurad1,5,Fri Jun 12 14:07:40 2015 UTC,"As someone mentioned, lumbar technique varies place to place depending on the rad. Some do individual disc blocks that are all aligned to each particular disc, others want continuous slices that only are split into different blocks when the angle of the spine changes; which is how yours is. If they did continous slices like shown with individual angles, you'd get a fair amount of cross talk amongst the slices.   Again as someone else mentioned, a good radiologist shouldn't have a problem with these. PAs, chiros, and general doctors aren't as knowledgeable about MRI as you'd think, or that they think, they are."

Radiology,39g3iv,neurad1,9,Thu Jun 11 22:09:48 2015 UTC,"Those lines are so they can generate true axials. It's hard to evaluate the central canal and neuroforamen if the imaging plane is obliqued with respect to the spine. Ortho can read MRs pretty decently for the most part. [edit: ohhh, you said ortho PA. Yeah, don't listen to any mid-level provider about imaging studies, they don't know much about imaging]. That said, avoid surgery like the plague. Most people do okay, even with herniated discs, with conservative therapy. To a hammer everything looks like a nail (surgeons want to operate on everything). Fuck that. Conservative management. Chiropractors are frauds. Don't waste your money. Or if you want to waste your money, do it on something more fun."

My guy had his own failed microdiscectomy, so he's really focused on giving advice.  Yes, he did try traction and a few adjustments, but after it didn't help the first time, he stopped doing it.  Other than that, he's really helped me learn about all this stuff.  Yeah, he may have led me a bit astray with this MRI criticism, but he's been really good about coaching me on what to ask the surgeon.  He's not completely against surgery; he just thinks my case isn't an ideal candidate.  Problems include: the protrustion is too small (4-5mm); it's in L4-L5 rather than L5-S1; the problem disc is still near full height; the ESI did absolutely nothing (possibly means the pain is coming from somewhere else), and I've had this for well over a year."

Because there aren't many companies that send out travel technologists, there are times when she goes out of state to practice mammography. Most of the time she stays in the state though. She tends to go to places where the patients cannot leave where they are staying, such as nursing homes, mental hospitals and prisons. Occasionally, she would go to private companies who would provide health benefits to their employees. She also went to health fairs, community houses and churches.

Radiology,396tra,notevenapro,3,Wed Jun 10 01:57:57 2015 UTC,"Hullo Got my RT through the the Army, CNMT at a university afterwards. my 2 cents, TBH, I think enjoyment-wise there was more to do as an RT. Of course, I had daily lackluster CXRs or hours of pointless standing in the OR, but I also remember frequently having to be clever and thinking out ways with my portable, getting all fancy angling the tubehead in different ways to x-ray patients, (I had a MinXray for most of my RT career, and my pt population then generally didn't like to move around). There was a lot more DOING..  As a CNMT, it's a little more dull, as far as DOING is concerned (,though I hear this is high dependent on where you work). If you are a real sucker for science and pathophysiology, you may have a little more enjoyment in the whole scanning process, seeing how a RP flows, absorbs, and clears in patients with some kind of pathology. Yet sadly, where I'm at, its just Cardiac studies and Bone scans. Procedures and protocols and processing are (pretty much) the same each time. Patient positioning is (pretty much) the same. Myocardial ischemia and infarcts, arthritis, are too common to be interesting anymore. I guess I haven't been working long enough to come across an interesting study yet.   Am I happy with the transition? Generally, yes. There is more time for a breather here and there while the patient is being scanned, or while the RP is circulating in a pt. The pay is higher, too.  Do I recommend NMT, though? no, not now; not until the job market somehow expands..   Would be interesting to hear from NMTs working in other places, like cancer centers or other advanced institutions..  (Apologies for any errors in grammar, spelling, etc; I'm not 100% atm)"

Radiology,396tra,carolinablue199,2,Tue Jun 9 21:06:54 2015 UTC,"I'd also second VIR. If I were a technologist, this is what I would do. You get to be part imager, part intra-procedure assistant, and part scrub tech. You run the table, keep all the catheters and wires organized, and you have to know what the hell is going on during the case because the physician is going to expect you to hand him or her the right device.  The physicians will respect you a lot more than someone with ""just"" an RT job. I've been scrubbed in there, as a resident on my IR months, and on numerous times have watched the tech and the doc just talk to each other about what they should do in a given situation. They're a team. I've seen the tech provide a suggestion that was used by the physician. I've seen techs performing (supervised) angioplasty because the trust level with that doc was high enough.  RT without other sub-specialty training is where careers go to die (unless you want to be a lead tech or something). I hate to be so blunt, but it's true.   edit: Cath lab is gonna suck compared to IR, by the way. Cardiac caths are super boring - it's the same procedure over and over. VIR labs are where the real interesting and varied cases go on (TIPS, TACE, Y-90, UFE, various lines, ports, percutanous nephrostomy, percutaneous biliary tubes, PEGs, G/J tubes, clot lysis, angiography, venography, lymphatic duct embolizations, and so on)."

I really trust some of my techs and turn to them when I'm struggling to complete something... we frequently use bits and pieces of different equipment sets to 'MacGuyver' something (too old a reference?)... In patients who are known to be bleeding (GI bleeds, trauma), I always have the techs looking at the angiographic images we take to help pinpoint suspected abnormal areas to investigate more closely with superselective angiography... more than two hands are often required to keep the access (e.g. vascular sheath and angiographic catheter) stable while simultaneously performing some type of maneuver at a distant site inside the body, so my techs will perform catheter exchanges, contrast injection, angioplasty, forceps biopsy, stent deployment, arterial closure, hold pressure after cases, etc..."

They opened the job up to students and I landed the position.    Now I'm running the place.  Keep your head down and you'll land something.  Even if your stuck in DI for a little while it's not a bad thing.

Radiology,38z5su,XZhaha,3,Mon Jun 8 01:58:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly? The shortage, if there is one, is going to effect people differently based upon which supplier they use. Take the drug Kinevac. I know some techs that are out of it while I have over 100 vials in my clinic.   Your best bet is to get in touch with a local radio-pharmacy.   http://www.triadisotopes.com/  http://www.cardinal.com/us/en/nuclearpharmacyservices  http://www.mallinckrodt.com/"

Radiology,38z5su,DaedMann,2,Tue Jun 9 06:37:44 2015 UTC,"Speaking as an Aussie NMT we only have shortages when the moly generators fail QC. It's something that I've seen happen about 3 times in the past 5 years. Nothing you can do about that apart from move patients to a new appointment booking, do a reduced list with mainly cardiac studies (most money and probably more important than a stress fracture) and keep a little aside for those V/Q scans that invariably turn up in the afternoon (I had two today)."
Radiology,38z5su,Blasterion,2,Tue Jun 9 11:51:32 2015 UTC,"Call the CO, tell him they ain't got any Tc left, and then take leave and go on vacation.  Actual answer: it all depends on your supplier, in theory if you can't get generators just order unit doses from the radpharms. Usually the shortage doesn't last long, also there are certain alternatives to Tc. such as Tl201 for Cardiacs and Ga67 for bone scans."
Radiology,38yw30,RaymondLuxury-Yacht,2,Mon Jun 8 00:36:28 2015 UTC,Do you know which bone you're looking at? Looks like there's a little fragment on the lateral side of your scaphoid.
Radiology,38yw30,nvrendr,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:57:26 2015 UTC,I see. Is the fragment the fracture then?
Radiology,38yw30,nvrendr,2,Mon Jun 8 01:06:06 2015 UTC,"I'd say so. I'm no radiologist though. You can see it slightly better on the oblique, second X-ray on that image you linked."
Radiology,38yw30,Hypno-phile,2,Mon Jun 8 01:10:46 2015 UTC,If you enlarge the image a bit you can see a dark line passing through the mid-part of the scaphoid. The line is right by that little fragment. That's the fracture.   Wasn't there a dedicated scaphoid view?
Radiology,38yw30,seesyourbones,0,Mon Jun 8 01:31:16 2015 UTC,No. I only went to an urgent care to determine if it was a break or sprain. I'm sure the ortho will order a dedicated scaphoid view.
Radiology,38yw30,Hypno-phile,2,Mon Jun 8 01:39:31 2015 UTC,"I work at an urgent care, if the patient has a FOOSH injury, we do scaphoid views."
Radiology,38yw30,austinap,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:23:16 2015 UTC,"At my urgent care we'd poke you over the scaphoid bone area and if tender you get a scaphoid view with your wrist film (actually I suspect the ortho tech who sometimes gets to patients before I do would just order the scaphoid view with every wrist film). For this fracture you'd get a cast, a follow up appointment and never go near a surgeon. :)"
Radiology,38yw30,Hypno-phile,3,Mon Jun 8 01:58:37 2015 UTC,"Why would they never go near a surgeon?  I feel like even minimally displaced scaphoid fractures should be evaluated by a hand surgeon, even if it's at clinic as an outpatient."
Radiology,38yw30,austinap,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:01:02 2015 UTC,"We only refer the ones which need surgery. This includes the questionable ones. Stable undisplaced scaphoids (probably 90% of the scaphoid fractures I see) are just going to be treated in a cast. We can do that. We get a lot of these fractures here (young active city with a lot of outdoor activities plus we have bars with mechanical bull rides), and my clinic is I think quite comfortable following them along."
Radiology,38yw30,Not_for_consumption,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:22:14 2015 UTC,"There's actually not much pain over the scaphoid, oddly. It's tender over the lunate far more, but most of the pain is in wrist movement outside a certain range. Moving my digits, including my thumb, doesn't really hurt.  I'm kind of concerned there's damage to the ligaments(which obviously wouldn't show up here) because the motion was a FOOSH ending with hyperextension of the wrist as momentum carried me."
Radiology,38yw30,Not_for_consumption,3,Mon Jun 8 02:06:01 2015 UTC,Looks like a minimally displaced scaphoid waist fracture.  Do you have snuffbox tenderness?  Kinda like this but with less displacement.
Radiology,38yw30,jdlather,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:58:06 2015 UTC,"Not really, it isn't tender compared to the rest of the hand. I see what you're talking about, though. I can feel some pain, but not much, there if I try to move my thumb out away from my hand."

Radiology,38uwtv,K8lynnPey10,3,Sun Jun 7 01:08:08 2015 UTC,"MRT is learning x-ray only, and much more in depth.   CLXT is learning basic xrays principles (and positioning) but also teaches you other responsibilities.  MRT is more specialzed and probably better if you want to work in a big centre. CLXT is more for small communities with less staff."
Radiology,38uwtv,Rusty_Bumper,2,Sun Jun 7 06:22:28 2015 UTC,"Around here, the combined program is basically laboratory assistants (ppl who draw blood and spin samples to be sent away to be analysed) and who also happen to do very rudimentary x-rays.  They are only seen in really isolated small communities where there is just not enough demand for a separate x-ray technologist (ie, outpost health centers). Any patient who has issues beyond the tech's limited radiologic scope of practice is transported to a fully staffed hospital."
Radiology,38uwtv,now_she_is_dead,3,Sun Jun 7 07:49:09 2015 UTC,"I'd be willing to bet the CLXT gives you only a certificate (possibly two - Lab Tech and Xray), and you'd be limited licensed tech. The MRT sounds like an actual 2 year degree program where you'd be able to sit for your ARRT boards. Whatever you find out, be sure you can get your ARRT license after graduation. AVOID being a limited tech at all costs."
Radiology,38uwtv,InnominateMasticator,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:50:41 2015 UTC,"Looks like MRT = X-ray only & CLXT = X-ray and other various responsibilities. Like IV starts & EKG's, etc. Not entirely sure though."

Radiology,38uwtv,AsianCha,-2,Sun Jun 7 04:04:20 2015 UTC,I would have to see the college but if MRT is a radiation therapist then it is a more specialized degree. A radiation therapist does the radiation therapy for cancer patients which is different than diagnostic X-rays which a general radiographer does. The therapist delivers high doses of radiation to a specific site like to a tumor.
Radiology,38tbwn,INGWR,5,Sat Jun 6 17:15:56 2015 UTC,please someone in interventional answer these. I want to do this so bad. Great questions!
Radiology,38tbwn,EIkCloner,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:39:00 2015 UTC,see my post above!
Radiology,38tbwn,lapizzafeliz,2,Sat Jun 13 20:19:26 2015 UTC,"I'll bite since there haven't been any responses yet. I don't work in interventional radiology myself but three of my work buddies do and their specials suite is adjacent to ours so we see and hear a lot of what goes on in there. As far as the pay is concerned, the two guys that are full time in specials easily clear over $100k/year on account of how much on call pay and overtime they're getting. You'll typically take call 15-20 days out of the month depending on how many techs you have to rotate on the call schedule and chances are you'll get called for a large majority of them. It's really hard to make commitments on your days off seeing as how you can get called in at any given moment when you're on call, this can be difficult if you have kids. My hospital gives you a year to get your VI cert, it takes about 6 months to get all your competencies out of the way and after that it's all about studying for the boards. From what I was told, they had a hard time studying for the boards due to the lack of study material out there but they passed on their first try. Your job mainly entails assisting the radiologist with interventional procedures, you'll either be scrubbed in and actively involved with the procedure at hand or you'll be at the console saving images, manipulating the tube, etc. If you're at an outpatient center, the procedures can certainly become monotonous but at my hospital they see something different all the time and genuinely love what they do for a living. I can't answer your question about recommending the job since I personally have never worked IR but, for me, I could see myself getting burned out on the job. I enjoy having my days off and not having to worry about being called into work, I could probably handle doing the job about 2-3 years and after that I'd more than likely start looking into a position where I wouldn't have to take as much call. You really have to keep in mind that you'll be working A LOT, this is how the guys there are able to clear six figures every year. If you don't mind a job where you'll be called in at 3am for a procedure that takes an hour and then have to be back at 7am for your regular shift, you'll have no problem with IR. Technically, my hospital requires at least 2-3 years experience as an RT(R) before being considered for cross training in Specials but I've seen them make exceptions. Where I work, it honestly boils down to department politics and favoritism, those two factors heavily dictate who they choose to hire and train. If they feel that you aren't going to be a good fit for their group, they simply won't give you the opportunity to cross train and will look at the next candidate. They want to hire someone that they know is going to be responsible and is going to be well liked by the radiologists, they don't want someone on their team that isn't willing to take the call necessary for the job. I hope this answered the majority of your questions, feel free to ask anything else and I'll try my best to give you a good response."
Radiology,38tbwn,derwreck,2,Sat Jun 6 19:49:45 2015 UTC,"I was a student in cath lab for a year, but I can answer a few of these as I am working in IR now in the same hospital and have found some similarities...  first of all, cardiac cath is awesome. the cases are interesting and you will see immediate results in your patients as their coronaries open. I currently work in an OR doing IR, but for neuro a lot of our patients are intubated (one thing I miss about cath).   pay: most techs in cath and IR that I have met work 4 10 hour shifts, so 4 days a week. however, this isn't always true! two techs that I work with now are full time at 36 hour per week, so they work 3 12s. I know other techs in another IR department and in cath that prefer to do 5 8 hour shifts, or they will work 4 10's that start later in the day instead of the usual 7-5:30. it really depends, but I would say that 4 10's is pretty standard.   call: every department that I have seen in IR or cath requires on call. usually this is 8-10 days a month. a night or so every week, and one full weekend (friday, saturday, sunday). my department works a little differently and our neuro cases require two techs, so I end up pulling call usually 10-12 days a month. some of the people I work with want more money, so they take more call. I would say 8-10 is standard, including your call weekend. call pay depends on hospital's policy.  certs: when I was hired in May of last year, I was given 2 years to take my VI registry. I had met the requirements for CI from being a student in cath lab, so I am sitting for that one in August. however...once you register for one of these exams (CI or VI), ARRT locks your comps in. this worked out great for me as my cath lab comps begin to expire this september, but since I applied and scheduled my first attempt at the CI exam, I have 3 attempts in 3 years to pass this exam WITHOUT worrying about my comps expiring. keep this in mind if you do an advanced practice in school. generally in the hospital I work in, techs are granted a two year period to sit for the test required by their modality. I reached all of my VI comps within one year of being in IR and still have another year to sit for the exam.  job responsibilities: cardiac cath techs usually scrub cath cases, at least in my hospital, especially for on call cases. we are the rad techs and are usually the ones operating fluoro, running the table, responsible for wires and catheters, etc. rad techs also monitor cases - something I was not allowed to do as a student. this responsibility depends on hospital protocol. I have heard of some hospital's where techs never scrub and only monitor and the fellows do all of the cath work. at my hospital, we share responsibilities as far as scrubbing, circulating, and monitoring. the only duty we don't share with nurses are drug administration.........in my current IR position, techs scrub and circulate. there is no monitoring done by techs because I work in the OR in hybrid suites, so per OR policy nurses chart and such. I have gained some new responsibilities in my new position, such as pulling sheaths and following up on patients as a part of radiation safety. I also order supplies for the rooms. your responsibilities will vary depending on where you are, but I hope this helps a little.  monotony of procedures: I would say overall I don't get bored with my cases. my favorite cases by far are neuro cases and any emergency cases (strokes, ruptured aneurysms, ruptured or dissected aortas, STEMIs). least favorite cases would be peripheral vascular cases like running legs all day. some people like repetitive cases. I try to stay in cardiac and neuro because I find them more interesting.  would I recommend cath lab and IR: yes! if you don't mind wearing lead all day (you begin to not notice it at all) and being scrubbed in for god knows how long (the time flies), then try it. I chose cath lab and IR because I'm a hands on person. I wanted to be very involved in interventional cases and I wanted something rewarding. everyday we help to save lives and that is an incredible thing.  prerequisites for jobs: my hospital prefers and will soon require a Bachelor's degree in this field. personally, I think it's smart to have a Bachelor's in general in case you want to advance up, you don't have to go back to school for it later. my hospital will hire new grads that chose the modality they are applying for as their advanced practice over someone who has not stepped foot in an IR or cath lab. however, it's not unheard of to hire someone who has zero experience. I got my job in IR when I only had cath lab experience, but sometimes the experience in IR and cath crosses over.  ACLS: not required for my IR position. required for cardiac cath. I will be taking ACLS for my IR position because it's a good thing to have. always improve your knowledge and skill set as much as you can: taking your registries, taking EKG courses, etc. your hospital doesn't require CI/VI registry? take it anyways! it's good to have behind your name, makes you more marketable, will enhance your knowledge, and it's good for job security and future opportunities."
Radiology,38tbwn,lapizzafeliz,2,Sat Jun 13 20:18:12 2015 UTC,"So when you say you were ""a student in cath lab for a year"", was this referring to when you originally went to X-ray school before you were an RT(R)? Or were you hired as an RT(R) and then considered a 'student' in cath lab because you were training?"
Radiology,38tbwn,lapizzafeliz,2,Sat Jun 13 22:19:30 2015 UTC,referring to when I was originally in x-ray school. my program was a bachelor's program with two years concentrated in diagnostic radiography and our third year was focused on an advanced practice - I chose cardiac cath
Radiology,38tbwn,carolinaelite12,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:38:26 2015 UTC,"I'm still a student as well, but I did a months rotation in Interventional, so I will try to answer what I can based on my limited experience and talking with the techs. For a little background, I did my rotation at a relatively busy hospital with 4 full time techs and 4 full time nurses for each one. There were 3 radiologist, 2 IR suites, and 1 CT room.  The pay seems to be a little more than a regular tech, although they never specified how much. If i had to guess I'd say maybe 3-4 more dollars per hour. Salary.com has the low end being $25/hr and the average at $32.  They were working 5 8s, and each team (1 tech/ 1 nurse) would come in roughly 30 minutes after the one before. The last team to come in was considered the ""on call team"" for the day, and would usually have to stay from 9 till 9 doing fluids (paracentesis and thoracentesis) and what not. They would rotate throughout the week on which team would be on call for that day. If there were no orders to do then the on call team would just go home after 8 hours like everyone else that day. After the week was up, they would have a call team for the weekend, and the way they made it seem, you could pretty much count on coming in for the weekend and getting another 8-10 hours or so.   The job responsibility of the techs were as follows: 1. Set up the room and trays for the procedure 2. After nurses brought the patient, techs would help get the patient on the table and start setting them up for the procedure. 3. Techs would prep the patient, and depending on the procedure they would scrub in. 4. The radiologist would then come in the room, and from that point on the tech is basically the physicians assistant. They guide the wires, hand the doc anything they needed, and pretty much take care of everything. They're in control of the C-Arm as well. 5. Discarding trays, and cleaning up the room afterwords, and preparing for the next exam.  This is really all I feel like I can answer. If you have any other questions, then I will try to answer them. I know I'm not exactly what you were looking for, but I figured I'd try since no one else has answered your question yet. I too would like to hear more from some IR techs on here."

Radiology,38razc,nfreni,6,Sat Jun 6 03:38:30 2015 UTC,"Have you tried the superiorinferior projection, that has the patient seated leaning over the cassete with their arm pit closest to the IR? You might be able to get the IR centered better doing that.  Otherwise, I don't think you have to have the IR behind the patients head to benefit from the sod, just enough for the patient to move their head and neck out of the way. I'm guessing like 4-5"", if you're still concerned about alara which seems reasonable, shield the head. Always better to be safe.  This what I would try."
Radiology,38razc,Baial,6,Sat Jun 6 04:26:04 2015 UTC,"That's how we do it. You lean them over as much as they can, tilt the head away from the IR, and if necessary throw a little distal angle on your central ray. Not a lot or the distortion gets to be too much."
Radiology,38razc,thanks_for_the_fish,2,Sat Jun 6 08:28:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, I shoot for max 5 degree angle towards elbow but have had to use 15, but that is not ideal.

Radiology,38razc,Weenie,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:55:24 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain! I am currently in a rotation at an ortho site that has a very similar situation in the DR room because of the size of the detector. You have to get them as close to that detector as you possibly can to get everything, it doesn't look particularly pleasant. Sometimes I will lower the detector down so that they can bend more at the waist too."
Radiology,38razc,INGWR,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:00:53 2015 UTC,"That's a DR wall bucky?  Angle your bucky maybe 20 degrees below horizontal. Get your patient to sit with their affected side digging into the wall bucky. Bend their elbow 90 degrees, tell them to follow the centering line on the bucky with their elbow and get them to reach as far as they can. Duck their head forward. Position tube over/above their head/neck, angled approx the same as bucky, centered on glenoid.  Inferosuperior projection if you have a table often works a lot better, but you have no CR. If your DR detector pulls out and has an upright stand you can use, it could be an option. Lay them down, abduct arm, detector above shoulder and digging into the neck a little, angled 20 degrees away from patient. Line up tube."
Radiology,38razc,Pmfont,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:55:46 2015 UTC,"It's not exactly by the book, but you can extend your SOD to give you more room for the tube to direct the beam at a more acute angle to the body. That will generally give you more glenoid in your image.  I worked xray in an ED for quite a few years where we were required to perform axillary views with all shoulders. I got in the habit of placing the tube almost next to the patient's feet. Of course, you have to compensate with your exposure factors.  Also, don't forget to have the patient turn their head away from the affrcted side to give you more room for your cassette. No need to place the detector behind the patient's head. And don't be shy about asking larger breasted women to hold the breast tissue out of the way with the unaffected side hand, it makes a world of difference in image quality as well as saves them breast dosage.  I would also echo others' recommendations to attempt a superioinferior projection when possible. My facility actually prohibited that method, but the few times I got exceptions, I really liked it except for the magnification you get with it."

I've spent time in the ER as a scribe and I've got to say that there were definitely times when I really didn't enjoy it because nurses/doctors were all so stressed out and tended to take it out on other people. By the end, I couldn't wait to get away.  That said, there were times when I found people that were warm and it was fun to spend time working with them. Also, I spent a little time in non-ER and outpatient settings and it was a ton better. I think more relaxed atmospheres tend to bring out the better side in people. So I would say to try out different places and see if one is a good fit for you. Try to stay away from working in the ER's of busy, under-staffed hospitals as much as you can and keep a lookout for what the workplace culture is like. Good luck."

Radiology,38kjpq,Dr_Schiff,3,Fri Jun 5 03:35:54 2015 UTC,"It will depend almost entirely on the facility you go to. Some departments are really friendly while others constantly talk behind each other's back. Either way they will most likely leave students out of the equation if they value keeping their jobs. If you want the honest truth, patients are hardly ever bad... the real people to be prepared for are surgeons.   All in all it's a great profession and there's far more positives than negatives. I had social anxiety going into this program, my professor even  told me to quit. But I ended  up being very outgoing and making major positive impacts at the places I worked as a student. It'll  be scary at first but if you find the right facility  (I'd suggest mayo) you'll find that it's a very rewarding work environment."

I worked with surgeons on a daily basis for a year (was an OR assistant, basically glorified janitor in the operating room) and hardly any of them were assholes.

Radiology,38kjpq,Terminutter,2,Sat Jun 13 05:54:23 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm a medical radiation technologist student in Canada right now and I just finished my first practicum. What I can tell you is that the time and the rapport that you build with each patient will be entirely up to you. Most patients that I have come in contact with were very respectful and friendly because they were there to seek your help, they trust you as a professional, or that you're a student to become a professional. During busy times some patients will voice there opinions about how long they had to wait, but that's something that will happen, you just need to realise your time with the patient is short and you don't need to know them on a level like nurses have to.   As far as working with radiologists and other techs, yes there will be some people who are mean but then there are some who are nice, this is simply life. Any job you take will have people you like and people you don't like and that goes for everyone, it will be up to you to decide what is important for you, whether the time spent with a mean lead tech will benefit you more than time spent with another lead tech but may not have the same expertise or insight.   I'm not working as a tech yet, but the one advice that I have for you, if you are afraid of people behaving mean, is to explain that you are a student. This helps set expectations with everyone you will be working with. You also have to remind yourself that you're a student sometimes to take the pressure off too. Introduce yourself to everybody that you will work with and make sure they know you're a student. Communicate clearly with them on how much help you expect from them, and don't be afraid to ask questions.   I bet you'll be fine as a tech, your skin will get thicker  with more experience. I'm typing this on my phone so sorry if I haven't answered any of your questions."

Radiology,38koxt,poopagore,6,Thu Jun 4 21:03:49 2015 UTC,"Basically the report says that there are some degenerative changes in your spine. At one level L3/L4 (we number the vertebrae and call the space between them a ""level."" L3/L4 = between lumbar vertebrae #3 and #4, where the disc is) the disc bulges out with some resulting narrowing of the spinal canal i.e. the space in the vertebral column where the nerves run. Below this, at L4/L5, your disc is degenerated but isn't causing any real significant narrowing. The radiologist did not see anywhere where a specific nerve root was getting squished.   Ultimately what will probably happen is neurosurgery will talk to you and examine you, review the MRI images and interpretation, and decide whether this is anything that could benefit from surgery.  If you pop the CD into your computer, it should autorun a program to view the images. You may have to explore the contents and find an .exe though"

Radiology,38iepa,thebigslide,3,Thu Jun 4 15:17:19 2015 UTC,I was thinking the battlefield itself is probably one of the worst places for a large magnet.  A way better question is why?  What need is being met here?
Radiology,38iepa,qxrt,2,Fri Jun 5 11:58:29 2015 UTC,Yep...battlefield MRI sounds like a huge waste of resources at this time. But I guess the research into more compact or portable MRI will provide other advantages down the line. Just not necessarily what it's currently being developed for.
Radiology,38iepa,soylentdream,10,Thu Jun 4 22:45:48 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you about battlefield MRI....  Several years ago, I guess someone put a bug in the heads of the services that traumatic brain injury (TBI) was a thing that we should be doing something about. TBI has been called the ""signature injury"" of the Afghan and Iraq conflicts. Our guys are wearing body armor and driving effective armored vehicles, but getting their bell rung by a roadside IED is still a bit problem. Seeing this from the civilian side of things (radiology resident, neuroradiology fellow), the academic interest in studying TBI -- especially minimal TBI (or mTBI) -- was huge, and formed a large part of why I decided to go into neuroradiology. Lot of current war vets are surviving the injuries to their bodies, and then suffering from and succumbing to the injuries to their minds.  The thing about mTBI is that the tissue disruption is super subtle. Stretch injuries to the axons, and such. The CT scan is normal. The initial MRI is normal. Over time (many months -> years), there can be brain volume loss that you can see with volumetric analysis. There's been some work looking for changes in metabolites using MR spectroscopy. But, largely, imaging doesn't play a role in diagnosing someone with mTBI.  But, at that point in time, the service heads and the people in their sphere of influence, wanted to do something. It can't be too expensive or make them change what they do in any fundamental way. It has to fit within the rules of how the military does things.  But it has to be something. Some. Thing. From what I heard, the people in charge (who, bless their souls, didn't know anything about neuroradiology, neurology, or the biology of TBI) were under the impression that putting MRI machines in the theatre of war would somehow improve care for the kids who just got exploded.  Or, perhaps, you'd do an MRI and that would tell you that you could turn the kid around and put him back on stomping-on-IED duty. Some. Thing.  So, I guess someone at NIH got together a research proposal and got 4 1.5T trailer MRIs installed in the larger medical sites in Afghanistan in late 2011. One at Bastion, one at Kandahar, one at Bagram (where I was over 2012), and one somewhere else. But then the research program got the kybosh put on it for some reason. And, if someone asked me, I would have said DTI fiber tracking would be the thing to do to image mTBI (even though, perhaps, we aren't really sure what the exact clinical significance of a fractional anisotropy lesion is, or the significance of one or a few microscopic hemosiderin deposit on the SWI). And for DTI you really need a 3.0 T magnet. Also, whoever specc'd the magnets didn't buy the (rudimentary) fiber tracking software package that the manufacturer offered. The original plan I guess was to do DTI at 1.5 T and then send the dataset back to a state-side university to analyze for the research project, but...since the research project was nix'd, we couldn't even play around with the DTI data sets.  And the TBI neurologist at Bagram with me didn't figure he had a use for MRI to diagnose and treat mTBI.  For my time over there we did maybe 5-7 studies per week. Mainly lumbar spines of overweight national guardsmen who now had to go IED-stomping wearing heavy body armor, and developed a sore back. Or someone who twisted their ankle playing volleyball. Who knows how much it cost to acquire the magnets and their service contracts. I knew the civilian techs were hired for six-figure salaries, and got awesome vacation packages including airline tickets anywhere in the world, I think maybe three or four times a year. I also know that the MRIs had to be powered by a cleaner power source than the base had, so there was a large power generator, just for the MRI, that burned 300 gallons of jet fuel every day.  Several months after I returned stateside, the Navy pulled the plug on the contract and all the MRIs went away. We'd done some thing. Scores of people got to put the getting-MRIs-in-the-battlefield project on their OPRs. Mission accomplished.  So, long story. Not really relevant. Sorry. I feel like I need a drink but it isn't noon yet here, and I'm trying to keep some semblance of discipline.  CT is the mainstay of trauma imaging. Even when you have a good MRI available. We'd zip the whole body and have reformats available in <5 min. In 5 min maybe you'd have the pre-MRI screening questionnaire filled out. So, MRI takes much longer. You need specialized personnel to make it work. What kind of images are you going to be getting off this low-field MRI? You're not going to be doing DTI. I bet the images look a lot like a CT scan, but with different shades of gray here and there. Say, apart from battlefield applications, maybe you can get a decent DWI sequence from it, maybe you could use it to diagnose acute stroke, but on the Vrenn diagram of places that don't have a real MRI and places that can give TPA, how many sites are in the overlap?  The one thing that we did right at Bagram was the medevac mission. The wounded service people were in the ICU for maybe a day, maybe two, and then flown to Landstuhl in Germany.  For battlefield applications, CT and quick medevac are going to rule the world. For non-battlefield applications, you need to conceive of a place that 1) can't have a real MRI scanner for some reason, 2) can logistically support this machine, 3) can make use of the data to change patient outcomes (why do a MR scan if you don't have the wherewithal to treat), and 4) has the ability to pay for it.  But, you know, market it to the DoD. If you've paid off your congresscritters, maybe the Army will buy a thousand of them so that they can abandon them in a warehouse, unused, when we pull the troops out after Iraq III."

Radiology,38fbcd,chaddax,3,Wed Jun 3 21:44:02 2015 UTC,"Assuming a similarish structure to our UK programme then I'd start refreshing anatomy, but do it using cross-sectional imaging atlases and plain film atlases. The learning curve in the first year is both refreshing your anatomy and pathology but in a completely new context of imaging. We have an Anatomy anx Physics exam as part of our 1st year Royal College exams, and most schemes have their own Emergency exam before going on-call at the end of the year so our approach may be different but some really good books that I got started on are:   Imaging Atlas of Human Anatomy (Weir et al) (We ALL bought this book on my scheme; its not very portable but its good for exam prep) Theime Pocket Atlases (personally love them all, but if you only get one then I'd get the Plain Film one - ""Radiographic Anatomy""; not everyone likes them though so look before you buy. Useful to have to hand when you're practicing Plain Film reporting) Accident And Emergency Radiology (Raby et al) - Yes its British, but it really is a superb book for getting to grips with how to safely read emergency Radiographs (doesn't cover CT, MRI or US) We have a copy in the department for On calls but everyone has their own copy too.   P.s. get used to be useless! Its the hardest part of first year; you come fresh from a ward probably running the place and suddenly find you're not trusted to do anything. It can be really tough if you like being independent but in reality its a great position to be in as (hopefully) everyone takes the time to teach you. But don't let it go to your head; it can easy to start relaxing because you're often superflous to requirements (like being a med student again) but use the time well because in 2nd year a hell of alot more is expected of you."

Radiology,38fbcd,Iatros,3,Wed Jun 3 23:41:12 2015 UTC,"Brant and Helms is absolute shit reading for a first year. It assumes a baseline knowledge of radiology (which you don't have at that point) and goes right into differential diagnoses and it's not geared towards a first year. Rather, stick to a book called Core Radiology by Mandell. It just came out in 2013, and it's pretty much like a First Aid for radiology. Save Brant and Helms for when you already have the fundamentals of each subspecialty down.  There are also great subspecialty-focused books for specific rotations, like Prerequisites for ultrasound or CT Body by Webb for... CT body."
Radiology,38fbcd,OrangutansLibrary,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:22:43 2015 UTC,"Core Radiology by Mandell   Agreed with all of the above, and just giving another shout-out for this book. It puts a lot of the concepts into a graphical ""tree"" of sorts so you can get a framework in your head of whatever subject it is that you're dealing with. I'm definitely a visual learner (weird right?) and I found that book to be far more helpful than Brant and Helms.  Case review series is pretty great for the 2nd rotation. RadPrimer is good for a question bank."
Radiology,38g3hp,RobotWilfordBrimley,2,Wed Jun 3 23:58:27 2015 UTC,"RDMS/RDCS sonographer here! I'll try to answer your questions as best I can but let me know if I miss anything!   1) I would definitely recommend gaining certifications in multiple areas (general, cardiac, vascular) it's going to help increase your job prospects and your pay. Cardiac/vascular is the most in demand right now, but having general or OB is always good.   2) Most schools are pretty open to various courses. It sounds like you have a variety and cover most requirements so I wouldn't worry about that too much.   3) I would make every effort to attend a CAAHEP accredited program that you can. I've seen some programs that are general/vascular accredited but not cardiac and even those would be fine.   4) Shadowing can be very difficult and it depends on the hospital. Most hospitals are strictly volunteer experiences but you can find ways to get shadowing experience. The way I was able to get an in was a family friend who was a nurse. She knew a sonographer in the radiology department and they were able to let me shadow for a bit. It really helped expose me to the field and give me an edge up on other applicants.   I think I explained everything you asked, but if I missed anything or you have additional questions let me know! It's a great field that is constantly challenging but ultimately rewarding. Best of luck!"
Radiology,38g3hp,smtmiz,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:03:43 2015 UTC,Oh also you should know the difference between accreditation and credentialing. CAAHEP is the central accreditation body that evaluates schools and their curriculum to ensure it is of quality standards. AART and ARDMS are credentialing bodies.

Radiology,38g3hp,smtmiz,2,Thu Jun 4 03:11:45 2015 UTC,"Not a sonographer, but I would just recommend going to your nearest hospital and finding your  way to radiology and asking if you can job shadow or if not politely ask if any sonographers are free and willing to talk to you briefly and you can ask them what schools they went to or recommend"

I was actually referring to the potential to do harm - we give an opinion on a single image, the patient believes us but we turn out to be wrong because we haven't got the full image set but the patient goes off oblivious and happy thinking they've got an expert opinion. Or we give an opinion that contradicts their radiologist and the patient goes off assuming their Doctor was wrong and doesn't trust their judgement in future. Or we give an opinion that feeds a patient's neurotic obsession with their health (I'm sure we've all come across such patients in the past)  If a patient walked into a department with a single grainy image from an MRI would any Radiologist or Reporting Radiographer here really offer an opinion, even if they never got sued for it? I don't see why people treat reddit any differently to the real world.

Radiology,3890hc,kc2244,8,Tue Jun 2 18:59:01 2015 UTC,"I had heard a few times, that maybe... It will all depend on your area.   And even with the listed jobs, where they full time? Part time? Per diem? When were they listed and are they still open? A boat ton of per diem listings that have already been filled by a mountain of applicants might look like plenty of jobs but in actuality be... Nothing.   I'm in New England, and it totally sucks here. What few jobs there are offer sub basement wages knowing it's a buyers market."
Radiology,3890hc,silflay,4,Tue Jun 2 20:21:47 2015 UTC,"Alright apparently it depends on your area, huh?  True, it does.  Also depends on a few other things, such as your chosen modality.  Sonography is in higher demand around here, but having any kind of certification beyond your (R) will help.    If you will love it, do it.  Take school seriously, do your best to stand out, make connections.  Get a part time job now at a hospital (be a transporter, ER tech, whatever).  Things will happen.  This is how I was able to quickly knock out my CT clinicals and take the boards, 9 months after graduating and passing the Radiography boards.  Since then, I've suddenly been getting call backs and have landed a job in CT.  (again, key word is making friends and connections.  it really is who you know.)    One of the hospitals straight up mentioned they never got my resume until one of their techs recommended me.  Then they went and got it themselves.  When you're fighting against Human Resources and whatever cute little algorithms they use to filter out applicants, this sort of thing is HUGE.  Granted, I've been working per diem in both modalities for the better part of the last year and once you hit that 1 year of experience mark, things get better as well.  Don't expect immediate results.  But if you're patient and play your cards right, it will pay off."
Radiology,3890hc,1radgirl,4,Tue Jun 2 21:52:44 2015 UTC,"Here's how every facility (clinics are different, but this is referencing hospital jobs) I've ever worked at has handled the hiring situation, for what it's worth. ""New"" hires, people they don't know and have never worked with before, are only ever hired into per diem positions. That's where you pay for your dues and prove yourself. All part and full time jobs are then filled internally from the ""pool"" of per diem employees. So yes, there are jobs, but expect to put in your time as a per diem first before getting upgraded to something with any kind of guaranteed hours or benefits. Clinics may hire a full or part time employee off the street (so to speak) but I've never seen a hospital do it. Not saying that's how every place does it, but that's my experience.   Also, how good the job market is depends on how willing you are to relocate. I still have classmates sitting in the city we went to school in waiting for a job to open up, years later. I was willing and able to move anywhere I could get a job. I was lucky and got hired at my clinical site, which was two states away from my school, but being flexible makes a huge difference!"

Radiology,3890hc,Arandy05,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:53:14 2015 UTC,"It just depends. The way we do it here is there is two ways of getting shifts. Writing down next to someone name who asked off in this planner we off, or getting called/texted and asking to work. Sometimes you can be asked to work a shift a week in advance, sometimes as short as an hour. But here's the thing, you can say no. So if you already have a shift at one place, just say you cant work that day at your other job. Just be sure they haven't already plugged you in to work somewhere, which is what our weekend team lead does, before you agree to a shift"

That diagnosis is extremely rare that if it were biopsy proven, it'd be reportable.  But, to answer your question, goto a university hospital and see their neuroradiologist."
Radiology,38761l,subintimal,6,Tue Jun 2 11:22:54 2015 UTC,"There are only a couple of case reports in the literature of endometriosis in the brain -- for how common endometriosis is, brain involvement is exceedingly rare.

Radiology,38761l,tigecycline,5,Tue Jun 2 12:26:15 2015 UTC,"If the lesions were symptomatic, the resulting blood products should be quite easy to detect on MRI. I would not think it likely that the findings would be particularly subtle. That being said, the brain would be an exceedingly rare location for endometriosis, and the chances of a positive study would be extremely low. But I don't think it would require a particularly erudite radiologist, especially if the appropriate clinical history is provided. Otherwise, the findings may be confused with cavernous malformations, hemorrhagic mets, AVMs, any sort of chronically hemorrhagic lesions that are all much much more common."

I have had so many brain issues the last 4 years it (to me and primary doc) it is a possibility.   I decided 10 years ago not to do anything for it since my only option left was hormonal therapy, which makes me suicidal. If this is the case, I need to revisit this option regardless of suicidal tendencies it may bring. I just want to make sure when tests are run, I have a radiologist trained in seeing it (no one can see anything in my abdomen as I am now, unless they open me up.

Radiology,381ctq,clukker,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:45:58 2015 UTC,Only a few of the images have loaded but I think I've seen something similar in a recent CT. The patient had an anterior resection and the colon was anastomosed to the remaining rectum via a side-to-end anastomoses rather than the 'usual' end to end anastomoses. This is why there is a redundant loop of blind ending bowel seen centrally.  The enema was presumably to check for anastomosis leak?  If the patient has not had surgery then I'm talking rubbish and this is some sort of fistula.   Also looks like he has a left sided hernia containing a loop of colon.

Plus another 15 secs figuring out exostosis v osteochondroma v hyperostosis v normal lesser trochanter. The other two fxs I don't think I could catch prospectively, even when trying to find the complement to the ring fracture. I'm not sure whether it's good medicine to call those other two fxs prospectively given the propensity for confounders in the region (OA/inflam - pubic symphysis, bowel gas - sacrum), though I'm sure others will argue against me.

Pediatric radiology is a smaller field than most but is still very much in need and there are a lot of practices that would love a dedicated pediatric radiologist. Pediatricians, for the most part, have no interest in taking it over since there is a LOT of subtlety in pediatric radiology. MRI is also continuing to grow as a major component and that's more difficult for clinicians to pick up.

Radiology,37p6v3,thegreatestajax,4,Fri May 29 11:54:11 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a UK doctor (radiology trainee in a big general hospital in London) - paediatric radiology is a large, busy and expanding radiology subspecialty. Its too broad to be taken over by paediatricians who are already very busy and increasingly subspecialising themselves. Although not an unpopular radiology subspec, there is a recruitment problem here in the UK (in general hospitals) because there is a greater risk of litigation with mistakes, non-accidental injury responsibilities (medicolegal), and a perception that it is complex compared to other subspecialities. But obviously working for the NHS you get paid the same regardless of speciality (I don't know much about the private paediatric radiology set up in the uk - its small).  In my experience most Paediatric Radiologists seem to do it alongside a systems based subspec or do Paeds and General radiology in general hospitals. But there are also purely Paediatric radiologists in big teaching hospitals and of course the Children's Hospitals, and some paediatric radiologists seem to be sub specialising even further. I've done placements at Great Ormond Street in London and they have a large department with Paediatric generalists, paediatric interventionalists, paediatric nuclear med radiologists, and even paediatric generalists with sub-subspecialties like paediatric Neuroradiology. But there are few Childrens hospitals as big and well resourced as Great Ormond Street. Most work in the large general acute hospitals, with the complex (and most interesting?) stuff syphoned off to the Children's hospitals."

Copies for everyone!) And do nothing else, it'll print each image separately. If you click on the images themselves, you can then choose to lay them out 2 or 4 on a sheet.   Close out of there, look at the bottom of your screen and click the redistribute button.   For example, CXR, I'd just click the button to make it say 1 copy, close out, hit the redistribute button.   4 view knee, I'd click on my AP/lat and click 2 on one, then both obliques and click 2 on one. Then I'd click the button to make 1 copy, close out, then redistribute."

That'll help you during the interview process too. There is so much more to ultrasound than most people know. Knowledge is power, so I think job shadowing would be good for you.

Radiology,37k2il,sutherbb36,1 point,Thu May 28 18:06:51 2015 UTC,Your internship should provide all the relevant experience needed for your first job.  I worked as a CNA through college but it wasn't in a hospital setting. You could volunteer at a hospital to get some resume fluff but really...what is important is your ability to scan well.
Radiology,37ifmh,Dr_Schiff,5,Wed May 27 21:33:05 2015 UTC,"If you want to go to medical school, you can major in whatever you want - so long as you also pick up all the pre-reqs. Biology was mildly helpful in the genetics class, but unless you specifically took embryology, histology, and perhaps a comparative anatomy class, none if it is particularly helpful in med school. They teach you what you need to know. You could still do the pre-reqs for medical school at the same time.  To answer your question, I'd get the B.S. in healthcare administration if I were you. If you end up staying at the RT level, the BS allows you to become a lead tech or department manager. Plus there are multiple avenues for advancement on the technologist front - CT, MR, IR, etc.   If you still want to pursue the MD/DO route, if you get your medical school prereqs done and you are a good candidate, you can major in art history for all they care (""good candidate,"" by the way, means probably at least a 3.6 science GPA with a higher overall GPA more like 3.8, good MCAT score, at least a 30, and something to set yourself apart from the other cookie cutter premeds). Honestly, it would make you stick out more as a good applicant if you weren't just another cookie cutter bio/premed major.    Aside: I'm not sure that medical school and residency are ""worth it,"" especially if you're behind the power curve. I started medical school at the age of 25 and it's going to be a full decade before I see any income at the level of an attending physician. If you want to do rads, it's 4 years of medical school (with 3 different USMLE exams), 1 year of internship, 4 years of radiology residency, then 1-2 years of fellowship. I have enormous personal debt because of it and I just watch the interest grow and then capitalize into principle, all while I live ever so slightly better than paycheck to paycheck.   Plus as a physician in the US these days, you're dealing with ever increasing regulations, workload, and stupid, pointless paperwork that has nothing to do with being a doctor. I would never sign up for this again knowing what I know now. I'd go to dental school and be an orthodontist and work Monday through Friday morning and take no call and never work nights or weekends.   If you want to go the medical school route (especially if you want to do rads), I'd really make sure you know what you're getting yourself into.    edit: As far as alternative routes go, you should check and see if you're in a state where you can become a registered radiologist assistant. It's like a mid-level provider for rads. We have one at my program who helps with the fluoro and teaches residents to fluoro. She's better than most of the attendings at fluoro. This document is an application for the program but if you scroll down to page 14, they list the types of procedures that RAs can do. It's not a bad gig - lots of procedures, an attending overseeing your work and taking on the liability for you, and you still have defined work hours like a tech or nurse."
Radiology,37ifmh,Iatros,3,Wed May 27 23:03:11 2015 UTC,"Currently in the internship aspect mentioned above...meaning I haven't even started my formal radiology training yet. I completely agree with your opinion - if I was smart, I would have been an orthodontist. Instead, I worked my ass off throughout college to get to medical school. From there, spent too much of my 'better years' studying for medical exams with information that is not even close to relevant (e.g. Krebs cycle). This year I'm working my ass off for attending physicians, just so I can FORMALLY begin my radiology training. The road is long and hard.  TLDR: Went to medical school. Now intern.

Radiology,37bnyk,OrangutansLibrary,1 point,Tue May 26 14:48:15 2015 UTC,"Ok so you're right this sounds like a PICA type pattern. Now ask yourself - do 28 year olds get strokes? This is important for deciding what you do.  So if we're suspecting a stroke, the first thing to get is urgent imaging. In most hospitals that would be a Non contrast CT head - its quick and easy to do, and can be rapidly reported. Most patients are older and we would rightly assume this is most likely to be due to atherosclerosis unless clinical history pointed us elsewhere. An MRI with Diffusion Weighted Imaged (DWI) could also be done but is not usually easily available in most centres 24 hours a day.  In this case the guy is young so we have to seriously think about another possibility - Vertebral Artery dissection. So in his case we would do a non-contrast CT head AND a contrast CT Angiogram of the Head/Neck. A CT is much faster than doing a MRI plus an MR Arteriogram, but MR is still a good alternative if its available.  If he has no dissection then he'd be a candidate for urgent thrombolysis if the stroke is not too big, there is no haemorrhage and he is within 4 hours of onset. If there is dissection then he'd still likely need thrombolysis but also longer term anticoagulation and importantly would need urgent discussion with a neurosurgeon/interventional radiologist (by the treating team) for further management - would he benefit from Angioplasty and Stenting? (difficult in the vertebral arteries but it can be done). The radiology registrars role would be to report the images and contact the team urgently by phone or in person to tell them the findings and give general advice about management.  A few sources to help get you started are below. Don't worry, I doubt you need to give a massive presentation on the topic, but these articles might help with understanding what you'd expect to see on the images so you can talk sensibly. In theory he should definitely have signs of acute stroke (in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory) but he may not necessairly have a dissection (remember there are other causes of stroke in young people too - pro-thrombotic conditions, endocarditis, cocaine abuse but to name a few).   BMJ article on PICA Radiographics (Radiology education journal) on CT aopearances of stroke Radiopaedia article on Vertebral Dissection Radiopaedia article on Ischaemic Stroke Radiopaedia article on Haemorrhagic Stroke (Need to know what a bleed looks like because we need to exclude that before we can give thrombolysis!)"

Radiology,36tllr,bone577,15,Fri May 22 00:39:07 2015 UTC,This report shows nothing but ignorance about radiation exposure and it's linking to Fukushima residents at the end of the article is extraordinarily misleading as the fallout was contained enough that residents didn't get much additional dose.

Radiology,36tllr,shadowa4,10,Fri May 22 12:28:34 2015 UTC,"I think this is a very American article; I don't mean that as a slur but just that it has a very ""consumer"" focus (as the whole website name suggests it should) and reflects the state of American healthcare more than other systems.  For example I work in the UK NHS and the approach is based more on ""can the study be justified, if not we will refuse to do it"". I've never come across an incidental lung blob leading to another CT in a child, and a child skipping US to go to CT would be a radiation incident unless there were exceptional circumstances.  We still have a great pressure to scan and I have no doubt we overscan - defensive medicine is booming here too - but I think this article is about the specific pressures in a specific system.  I agree with /u/nfreni - the bit on the Fukishima nuclear accident is just ignorant scare mongering! But the rest of article is a bit more considered although with a negative slant."

Radiology,36tllr,Yellowbenzene,5,Fri May 22 19:32:28 2015 UTC,"Overall it's a decent topic, marred hugely by a sensationalist edge, apparently due to the need for all internet media to be click-bait. Titling something 'The surprising dangers of CT scans and X-Rays' gives the wrong impression from the start and creates a bias in the readers mind. I would also caution any readers outside the US, as much of this article seems to apply more so to the US than other countries.  I think this article cherry picks and uses emotive anecdotal evidence to portray radiation exposure in a worse light than necessary. Particularly when it makes decent points in various other areas that could easily have been continued to be factual and helpful. There are some useful and quite fair points that the article makes. But when it compares to Fukishima it is being emotive and when it states ""But recent research shows that about one-third of those scans serve little if any medical purpose."" and doesn't link to the research... well that's just irresponsible writing.  However if the article was written properly and factually it would definitely be an area worthy of discussion. Over scanning is something most of us see, particularly with regard to CT (hell I see a bit with CBCT in dental). I can't speak for the US, but in Australia it's a problem partly due to the fact that some CTs are bulk billed and hence there is no cost to the patient, which makes them less likely to ask questions. Many do not understand why they are having the scan, and almost all have not discussed it or the risks with their doctor. Couple that with the issue of GPs having a generally poor understanding of radiation effects and their dose variation in imaging procedures, and this opens the door for unnecessary scans. Part of Australia's problem is also financial; government funding has been drastically reduced in real terms over the past 15 years or so due to removal of indexation, and hence we are seeing clinics churning through more and more scans just to make the same revenue, which encourages a lack of questioning and rejection by radiologists.  My practice now has a consent form for every exam, as well as exam information and a dose chart available to patients. While we mostly do dental imaging that's super low dose patients are generally appreciative to learn a bit about doses and how radiation works. I regularly answer questions about radiation generally, microwaves, mobile phones, radioactivity, shielding, cancer risks, and comparisons to other medical imaging, and I think that time is well spent to inform people a little more. I'd encourage practitioners to help take some time to explain things to their patients and answer questions; it is rewarding and overall people will understand our work better and get some perspective :)"
Radiology,36tllr,garion046,1 point,Fri May 22 12:30:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with comments here. I find it incredible that there are no federal regulations when it comes to training of the medical staff operating xray equipment in the US. If the fact that 'anyone' can do it is true, it itself poses a risk. I am Norwegian, here we need a three-year bachelor degree and be certified by a board of medical professionals to work in our field. In addition there is extensive training intradepartment and two full time positions held by lead techs to ensure optimal quality of protocols and the dose they give.  As with other countries, overexposure happens here too. Norway is high up on the list of Scandinavian countries when it comes to the use of xray-based medical imaging. Fortunately, pediatric exams are rare and when we do image children we have protocols based on age, weight and anatomical area and employ all possible dose-saving measures. In my department we are fortunate to have new scanners, this might not be the case elsewhere. The mentioned dose-reduction measures are also used on adult patients.   I am a CT-tech with eight years experience."
Radiology,36tllr,lodravah,2,Sat May 23 13:54:58 2015 UTC,"In the U.S. We have the ARRT which required us to take a  two year course which was accredited by them and when we finish that we have to take a exam to get certified. Nobody will hire you without that certification. If you want to advance into CT or MRI there are a few options, you can find classes or learn on the job as I did for CT then you can take the boards for CT. It is getting harder to get a job without CT certification. My employer gives you a year to take your CT boards if you take a position and are not registered."

Radiology,36mp6f,carol9a,2,Wed May 20 22:38:58 2015 UTC,A few years ago my dog needed some imaging. I was stunned by the costs of the proposed tests - all cost +++more than I got paid for reading the same imaging studies on people. I pointed that out to the vet and he said it was because animals were so much harder to image than people. I pointed out that it was probably  easier to x ray my elderly and quiet dog compared to a screaming 2 year old or an adult who was morbidly obese or was aggressive or was in ICU or any of the other things that can make even a simple chest X-ray challenging. The vet lowered his price on all the imaging.
Radiology,36pv9g,stw2011,6,Thu May 21 04:13:19 2015 UTC,"You can see lines/tubes on xrays, but  what they probably will do is push barium through your feeding tube, then xray for better visualization. Doing a SBFT would obscure the tube unless theyve done it a different way for you in the past."
Radiology,36pv9g,reijn,3,Thu May 21 04:22:22 2015 UTC,"Small Bowel Follow through would be unnecessary - that is basically live xrays to look at the bowel itself which is more than needs to be looked at and requires more radiation.  With a possible blocked tube all they need to do is put a little bit of contrast down the tube and take a single xray. If the contrast is in the bowel, the tube is not blocked. They may do 2 xrays - one before to see where the tube as is and one after contrast to see if its blocked.   There is a huge difference in dose. A follow through can be 3.0 mSv of radition while a single abdominal xray is about 0.53 mSv. Even two AXRs is much less dose than a standard barium follow through exam. So try not to worry your doctors know all these things and about your case so they will be able to pick the best test for you. Speak to them if you're worried, they will answer your questions! :)"
Radiology,36pv9g,OrangutansLibrary,2,Thu May 21 07:10:31 2015 UTC,"They did a normal abdominal xray with no contrast but it didn't give them the desired results, so they now ordered a Small Bowel Series....talk about extra radiation, huh? Thank you for the help"
Radiology,36pv9g,OrangutansLibrary,1 point,Thu May 21 15:27:13 2015 UTC,Don't worry the radiologist doing the procedure will keep the dose to a minimum and it shouldn't be a full follow-through if the history is correct; they can be very focused and keep the dose down.
Radiology,36pv9g,noodlyjames,1 point,Fri May 22 03:32:35 2015 UTC,If they are looking for an obstruction of the tube then they don't even need to image at all. If they are  looking for the level of the narrowing in the tube then they should inject and image once. A small bowel follow through is to show abnormalities of the small bowel  and would be massive overkill if all you are looking for is tubal patency.
Radiology,36mv21,navy2x,4,Wed May 20 15:26:40 2015 UTC,There was a technician cleaning a Fujitsu CR machine today at my department. I was looking at some of the parts inside the machine and thought this was particularly interesting.  Here is my layman attempt of an explanation for those interested: A laser oscillates back and forth along the imaging plate which contains photostimulable storage phosphor elements. These phosphor elements then create light based on the amount of xrays absorbed at the time it was taken. This light then travels up the acrylic sheet shown in the image into the photomultiplier tube. The small amount of light is then multiplied by as much as 100 million times and converted to electrical energy to create a digital radiograph.
Radiology,36o2uz,etrtr,3,Wed May 20 20:09:13 2015 UTC,"It all depends on patient volume and number of beds. I did the overnight shift (XRay & CT) for over 5 years in a ~200 bed/20 room ER. I was the only tech from 11pm to 7am and it got a little hectic every now and then. On the weekends, my shift would be covered by two techs because we anticipated more ER activity. The surrounding areas here all run 8 hr shift (7a-3p, 3p-11p, and 11p-7a), which I always found interesting because most of the hospital staff do 12 hr shifts. However, it seems to work and allows some flexibility for employees calling in sick, or scheduling vacation time."
Radiology,36o2uz,shadowa4,2,Thu May 21 01:58:58 2015 UTC,"So at my hospital, (264 beds) we have two techs on overnights, a 2300-0700 and a 2330-0730. If one of those techs happens to be on our core CT team, they do injections if necessary. Otherwise, we have an on-call CT tech to come in for C+ exams. We're usually fairly busy, between ER and portables. We rarely have an OR running on overnights, but sometimes it happens."
Radiology,36o2uz,jeenyus148,2,Thu May 21 17:37:42 2015 UTC,"I've been doing overnight shifts for about six years now at my 450+ bed trauma center hospital. The handling of overnight has changed a fair bit over the past few years. Originally it was handled by two full-time midnight-8AM techs, plus an on-call CT tech. Then the emerg physicians started getting upset because on-call CT wasn't reliable enough for a trauma center, so the hospital trained one of the x-rays techs to handle overnight CT. So it became three techs, all midnight to 8am with one tech being CT trained (and they would divide their time between Xray and CT as needed).  We've shifted the hours around a little bit since then. The CT tech is still full-time, midnight to 8AM, but the x-rays are handled by two sets of rotating 0.7 part-time workers with staggered shifts of 11pm-7am and midnight-8am. The x-ray techs would basically work seven nights in a row, then have the next seven off (or topped up with extra shifts as desired).  Also, at least one of those 0.7 xray techs (used to be three, but two of them left) are also trained in CT. I wind up splitting the CT responsibilities with them so that I can reliably get vacations and sick days."

I used to work at a 200ish inpatient bed and 30ish er room hospital and the day shift had 3-4 ct techs and only 1 at night from 7 to 7 but one of the day techs would work until 10pm.

CT and MRI use these images to start with so the tech knows where  to tell the machine to scan for the diagnostic images to follow.

The thread was left hanging from the lateral side near the incision though so how does that help fixate the mortise?   Thanks for your answer also!
Radiology,35vcuj,Roentgenator,3,Wed May 13 22:01:14 2015 UTC,"Rigid screw fixation can cause loss of proper joint motion while healing.  The idea with the rope is to allow some flexibility of the joint, but still maintain compression to allow healing.  The washer like devices on the medial and lateral holes are pulled taught by the rope.  You saw some stuff hanging from one end, but you must have missed seeing it being cinched up, since that's key to the procedure."

It just so happened that I was the one who did the original presentation xrays in emergency, so I knew their history. Our patient caught their foot and had a twisting motion which resulted in a mid shaft fibular fracture and posterior distal tibial fracture. The surgeon was concerned that the interossesous ligament between the tib/fib being torn as there was widening of the ankle mortise.   The fixture they used looked like two ""buttons"" because they were round with 4 holes in them, with strings attaching them together.  They drilled a hole through the distal tib/fib, pushed an oval pill shaped ""button"" through the hole, pulled on some strings to flip it flat on the medial side, then tightened the other ""button"" against the lateral side. The whole surgery only took about 20 minutes.  As to why they used this method over the traditional screw, i'm not sure."

Radiology,35t686,throwebwehhh,3,Wed May 13 08:22:40 2015 UTC,"Hi. I'm also from Aus and I did that degree a few years ago. I'm not aware of much in the way of 6 month courses you could possibly do that will add much to it. Courses pre degree are really aimed at fixing your base knowledge to enable you to get into a degree. If you were smart enough to get in then you should be fine to just learn as you go. Post graduate courses can definitely improve your career prospects but that's a different discussion.   It's pretty much the same for any self directed study you want to do. You don't mention if you have any background in health care but it probably doesn't matter. The course is set up to teach you from scratch so you may as well sit back and enjoy the ride. Yes you could probably teach yourself some anatomy from a textbook but it will be far less efficient than learning from a lecture and a lab.   The one caveat I'll add is that from memory, my uni (QUT) recommended that you have year 12 physics and maths b, but I'm not sure it even enforced them.  There were a lot of people in my year who sucked at maths. Even grade 10 level maths seemed difficult. Of course they all got through and you really need barely any maths on the actual job, but if your math skills are up to scratch it will be one less thing for you to worry about. The thing I recall causing the most drama was rearranging equations involving exponentials for things like radioactive decay and inverse square law. If you can do that sort of thing, you shouldn't have too hard a time.   My advice would be to find a job for 6 months, possibly in a health care field and save some cash so you can afford to not work during exams etc. The department I work in employs radiography students as helpers which seems pretty useful as far as study goes.   Oh and if you don't know how to type, you've got 6 months to learn. But that's a tip for any degree anywhere. Or anyone in fact.   Good luck. If you have any questions specifically relating to radiography in Aus especially QLD let me know."

Radiology,35r884,eugenemah,2,Wed May 13 22:30:12 2015 UTC,Look for openings in a Level 1 trauma center or teaching hospital if that is an option in your area. Night shift CT can feel very routine sometimes in the sense that it is often ab/pel after ab/pel and non-contrast head after head. Maybe Cardiac CT or uncommon exams could be your thing but you'd have to get to a facility or shift that would give you that opportunity. I second the commenter that suggested ACLS because it would also help you if you pursue cardiacs. Another thought- are you interested in interventional procedures? Specials and cath lab techs get to do a lot of hands-on work so that could also be something to look into.
Radiology,35r884,lodravah,1 point,Wed May 13 04:55:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply  Currently I'm not looking to switch hospitals because I don't want to move away from home, there isn't a level 1 nearby.

Teaching is something I'd like to explore, but I need more years experience before I would be able to handle a position like this.   I like the night shift. I do feel like it is routine sometimes but you never know what will come through the ER. I'm able to do a little bit of cardiac stuff too. Mainly heart scores and cta coronary studies.   This ACLS seems like what I was asking for and I'm gonna look into it more.   I've always been on the fence about cath lab and specials. I'm not sure that is the path for me.

But how to actually take a good x-ray - not really. I learnt the theory of where you would centre and position for my exams but having never had to do much of it that information is gone.   A radiologist coukd probably, in a dire emergency, rustle something approaching a useful image compared to non-radiology staff but certainly not anywhere near as good as a radiographer/rt and likely at horrendously high dosage.

Radiology,35pg73,MalcontentUK,7,Tue May 12 13:43:49 2015 UTC,Not sure when you trained but in my training (within last 5 years) we had no positioning teaching at all.  I'd just volume CT everything lol.
Radiology,35pg73,Yellowbenzene,2,Tue May 12 17:37:32 2015 UTC,We had no formal teaching - self study as part of our part 1 exams and could come up in part 2a. I think its been dropped. They even dropped Anatomy from part 1 for a while too (not even that long ago) but fortunately brought it back. I think technically the odd positioning question should still be part of 2a modules alongside the odd anatomy and physics questions? Maybe not anymore? Its of dubious benefit to be honest!  (p.s.

Radiology,35pg73,MalcontentUK,2,Wed May 13 02:49:53 2015 UTC,I'd be willing to assume with how many images you've probably read that if a rad took their own images then they would have near proper centering and positioning for most basic studies with minimal cr angulation.   With image quality youd be able to figure it out  with basically s number knowledge and just repeating until you got an image you'd be satisfied with reading.   Trauma may be a bit difficult though :p
Radiology,35pg73,Glonn,15,Wed May 13 03:49:12 2015 UTC,"As a non-radiologist,  in these days of aec and techniques automatically coming up when selecting the procedure, I can't imagine a radiologist would have any issue doing a simple exam like an ankle or wrist. I'd imagine studies with trickier centering points like an abdomen or chest would be difficult without practice. Also id put money against a rad being able to get an odontoid within 5 tries."
Radiology,35pg73,nfreni,7,Tue May 12 15:03:07 2015 UTC,I still can't get an odontoid in 5 tries..  Yay Fuchs!
Radiology,35pg73,stevil30,6,Tue May 12 18:48:48 2015 UTC,"This worked well for me when I was shooting xrays.  For an upright AP open mouth, stand directly in front of the patient between them and the tube. Center them to the wall Bucky and Rotate and tilt their head until you have them perfectly straight (easy to judge when facing them directly). Then move yourself so you are facing their profile.  Have them open their mouth wide and palpate the base of the skull, tilt their head back until the bottom edge of their front teeth are in line with your finger that is touching the base of their skull (line parallel to floor).  Center the Bucky to the base of the skull and adjust the tube so that the center laser line skims the tip of the front teeth.  Shoot.  Now, you have a by the book image (not that it guarantees a good shot) but more importantly you have reproducible conditions.  Meaning if the image comes back and the teeth are just barely obscuring the odontoid, line them up exactly like you had them and tilt head back a hair.  Readjust the Bucky and tube as described before so that you can make adjustments again if your next image is still off.    Most importantly, don't get discouraged.  Odontoids are a high variance shot.  Nobody can hit them first time every time.  Some patients' habitus does not allow a textbook shot.  Knowing what is and isn't possible comes with time.  Don't be ashamed to move to the Fuchs if the first shot is perfect except for obscured tip.  The same info in 2 guaranteed shots vs possible 3+ shots is typically preferable."
Radiology,35pg73,BariumEnema,2,Tue May 12 19:26:32 2015 UTC,"OID is your friend for dens - projects the teeth farther apart, so you get a wide-open mouth. Especially helpful for trauma c-sp when the collar restricts jaw movement."

Radiology,35pg73,MalcontentUK,1 point,Wed May 13 02:55:53 2015 UTC,"Im pretty young in the field, but I hardly ever use the preprogrammed techniques, or aec. I only photo time 2 view chests. I find AEC images suboptimal to fixed techniques and the preprogrammed techniques maybe close, but have poor density and contrast. Positioning of the basic exams would be easy for them, but any technique or portable exams they would fail miserably, and that's ok it's not their job :)"
Radiology,35pg73,Dobsie2,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:02:05 2015 UTC,"For cxr and abdomen films I prefer aec, but just about everything else I set my own for. My point was more that I feel a radiologist could figure it out not necessarily requiring an advanced knowledge of techniques as you would in the days of film. And since most systems pull the correct kvp when you select the part and aec from there I think a rad would be okay in most scenarios. Albeit lesser quality for sure"
Radiology,35pg73,nfreni,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:07:29 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree at all. Just my personal preferences. I think most Radiologists worth anything could be decent, but I don't think they would be anywhere close to the standards they hold our images too. Now an RA would be different as they come from an X-ray background they should have zero problems."
Radiology,35pg73,Dobsie2,7,Wed Jun 24 00:45:04 2015 UTC,"My brother is a Radiologist and when I was going to school to become a tech I asked him if he could give me any pointers on positioning.

Radiology,35pg73,starbuxed,5,Tue May 12 14:59:26 2015 UTC,"Really?? In what country do you live?  Most of the very best rads I've worked with can manage the fluoro and maybe some Ultrasound, but that's really it...aside from IR Rads.  I knew one Army Colonel, who was a rad who could do reformats on the CT scanner... not sure if he could actually do a scan, but that was impressive to me."
Radiology,35pg73,angelwild327,2,Tue May 12 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"I can perform reformats on our newer CT scanner, I even showed a few of our Rads how to do it and pretended I was suprised they didnt find it really easy and obvious hehe. But, confession time, the only reason I could was because the new scanner reformatting software was basically just the same software we'd been using for years on our reporting stations. It impressed the hell out of some of the newer/younger rads at the time, and I teased them about it until I finally showed them the truth. The more experienced Rads could smell the bullshit a mile off though. Your Army Colonel may have been up to the same tricks... :D"
Radiology,35pg73,MalcontentUK,2,Tue May 12 19:34:53 2015 UTC,"He may have, but he wasn't showing off, he was just getting some images that he specifically wanted, without bothering us.  Sadly the Doc's workstations have no capabilities for reformatting, so they are completely clueless as to the button-ology of the scanners."
Radiology,35pg73,angelwild327,3,Wed May 13 03:37:25 2015 UTC,He is a better man than me then :) I must admit whenever I'm in CT I'm always really tempted to press the big red scan button - but apart from that childish impulse thats about as far as my practical understanding of using the CT scanner goes.
Radiology,35pg73,MalcontentUK,3,Wed May 13 17:02:20 2015 UTC,"HA!! Don't press the RED button, that is almost always the shut down button..and you do NOT want to go there!  USUALLY the buttons light up green, when scanning.  Red=Stop for most purposes.  Stick to your dark caves and no one gets hurt.  By the way, you rads who post here, seem pretty cool... I hope you have a good rapport with some of your techs.  I LOVE working with fun easy going rads, who don't feel like I'm beneath them; makes the work environment much better."
Radiology,35pg73,angelwild327,1 point,Thu May 14 02:03:38 2015 UTC,"I imagine of all radiologists, the Interventional Rads might well make the best attempt at producing a standard projection because they're so familiar with fluro equipment but crucially communicating what they want with their Radiographer teams using standard centreing and projection terms as they're scrubbed and can't position.  By contrast when I'm doing most diagnostic fluoro I usually position the machine myself so I kind of just ""do it"" rather than always actively thinking and communicating in terms of what angle I need or what the projection is called. So if faced with taking a standard xray the Interventionalist might start better by saying ""I want to centre here with this angle"" while I'd be stood going ""I want this projection, this seems about right... I wish I could just use a quick flash of fluoro to confirm I'm in the right position..."""
Radiology,35pg73,MalcontentUK,2,Thu May 14 03:06:11 2015 UTC,"We have all wished that, but that would be cheating, I suppose.  I'm always blown away by the minutiae of anatomy and pathology you guys have to know and recall on a daily basis... so just let us handle taking the nice pictures... you have enough going on :)"
Radiology,35pg73,angelwild327,3,Wed May 13 03:18:46 2015 UTC,It works both ways - I have immense respect for the skills required in image aquisition and the expertise of my radiographer colleagues. Radiology is a team exercise with lots of important cogs in a complex machine that only together can make a difference to peoples lives. We'd be at a total loss without you guys and gals!
Radiology,35pg73,MalcontentUK,3,Wed May 13 17:09:35 2015 UTC,"That is why it's important to let your staff know that you are approachable.   As a CT tech, I know how important not only getting good images, but also good information about the patient is... and I do my best to provide that.  I really like to be able to easily call or text my docs and ask them questions, when I'm unsure of anything..  I've been fortunate enough to work with several very cool docs; and it made me a better tech, because I was never apprehensive to ask any question, no matter how silly it might have seemed.  Thank you all, for being kind and considerate to your staff of techs, it means a lot!"
Radiology,35pg73,angelwild327,1 point,Thu May 14 01:57:08 2015 UTC,I had a radiologist ask what the heck a Pigg-o-stat was when they walked by and saw one. I'm curious to know what they learn as well.
Radiology,35pg73,CartoonPhysics,0,Thu May 14 03:10:28 2015 UTC,Since everyone seemed to think the first answer was snarky.  Here is the answer you were looking for: No. We don't get much teaching about exposure techniques for radiographs. Most of our technical training relates to CT and Mri.
Radiology,35pg73,ChibiCHIYO,4,Wed May 13 05:28:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think it necessarily ""matters"" but was more of a curiosity question."
Radiology,35pg73,CapnKnight,7,Tue May 12 16:03:57 2015 UTC,Indeed it was. A snarky response wasn't necessary.
Radiology,35pg73,ChibiCHIYO,-3,Tue May 12 15:03:15 2015 UTC,It wasn't so much as sparky response but the question also could have ended with the first part.  No need to ask specifically about a grashey response.  You were curious and I answered and explained the difference in roles. You have one radiologist response and now one Radiology resident response.  Why be upset and antagonistic when the response was an actual answer not hearsay
Radiology,35pg73,smackinbryan,6,Tue May 12 15:14:34 2015 UTC,"The example of a Grashey was exactly that: an example. Since many Rads will walk by techs without as much as acknowledging our existence, we often don't interact with them - let alone know what they know about our jobs."
Radiology,35pg73,yotiemboporto,5,Tue May 12 15:18:48 2015 UTC,I'm just leaving a small community hospital (last shift is tonight) to go to a much larger hospital. The close relationships we have with our Rads is what I will miss most.

I've never seen someone quite as bright red from embarrassment and apologizing so much   I hope I can have a goofball relationship with my rads right now one of my two current IR rads and I bonded over us both having jewfros while younger and he's a pleasant man."

Radiology,35gexw,MalcontentUK,2,Sun May 10 03:33:32 2015 UTC,TOF would solve a lot of problems for patients who have CKD. In my experience a lot of clinicians are not aware of the existence of TOF MRA.
Radiology,35gexw,MalcontentUK,1 point,Mon May 11 02:45:27 2015 UTC,"Its interesting that you say that. Our clinicians tend to just request MRA and we then decide on the protocol (often we have agreed protocols for specific requirements beforehand). I've not had many senior clinicians specifically requesting MRA with Gad inappropriately but lots of juniors understandably do, but those that do we tend to change to TOF if we deem it appropriate. All in-patient cases are discussed face to face (usually with a junior) so its easy to sort, while the outpatient requests usually only come from senior clinicians or clinics following request protocols. Is there a difference with the Canadian system of requesting - particularly in terms of the radiologist determining the protocols?   Crudely put we will go for the cheaper and safer option for any case where the potential added benefits of contrast MRA are unlikely to be needed, and its our decision (not the clinicians) although we are always open to discussion and have a low threshold for switching to contrast if the clinicians particularly wants it.  Totally agree with you regarding CKD, TOF is very useful in such cases - and as many elderly patients may have CKD of varying severity using TOF as the standard is reasonable, as long as contrast MRA is available when needed."
Radiology,35c9ld,jzero93,6,Fri May 8 22:42:58 2015 UTC,"The lead shield should be between the tube and the patient, in the primary beam, wherever that happens to be. You're gonna have way more radiation coming from the direct beam than you're gonna get from any scatter (unless you're maybe 400 lbs or something, that scatter is something nasty)."
Radiology,35c9ld,SheenaMalfoy,3,Sat May 9 00:28:05 2015 UTC,"To add to this, it will work sort of like filtration too. It will absorb softer radiation that would get absorbed into the skin"
Radiology,35c9ld,Glonn,5,Sat May 9 01:31:51 2015 UTC,"Just finished school. We were taught to use gonadal shielding over the gonads (in the primary beam). If using tube under fluoroscopy, then we were taught to put the shield under the patient. Otherwise always over. Hope that helps."
Radiology,35c9ld,6995,3,Fri May 8 23:58:54 2015 UTC,"In diagnostic radiography, the beam comes from above (the tube) and in fluoroscopy the tube is actually under the fluoro table. The image intensifier is the part of the fluoro table that the radiologist manipulated above the patient. Patients should be shielded in the direction of the primary beam. On top for normal X-rays, under the patient or closest to the table for fluoroscopy. Lead can be placed behind a detector to prevent back scatter artifacts in patients of a large habitus, but it does nothing to aid in gonadal shielding. Everyone from newborns to patients at the end of child bearing ages should be shielded during any radiologic exam unless the shielding will obscure pertinent anatomy.  Hope that answers your question.  Edit: spelling typo"
Radiology,35c9ld,XRayVisionRT,2,Sat May 9 03:11:45 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. Always place the shielding between the source of the beam and the patient if the gonads are in the beam.   Scatter is pretty hard (read: essentially impossible) to get rid of because the vast majority of additional radiation (outside of the direct field of view, obviously) is due to internal compton scatter, and shielding won't block any of that."

Radiology,35c9ld,XRayVisionRT,5,Sat May 9 03:27:43 2015 UTC,And just another tidbit... For ct you should wrap them in a shield... The beam goes all the way around. This obviously will not be used for pelvis cts.

Radiology,35c9ld,QuaverRest,2,Sat May 9 21:47:10 2015 UTC,"I actually did a presentation on this during an ASRT gathering. There's really no point in shielding the gonads if they're not close to the primary beam since there's legal obligation for it to be accurate to the indicated field. If the gonads are not near the primary beam, all you're protecting from is scatter. There's some scatter from the bucky apparatus and etc, no scatter coming from the front though."

Radiology,359nq7,etrtr,4,Fri May 8 13:27:24 2015 UTC,Originally the ER doc ordered shoulder so that what I started with. An AP and Y. Unfortunately I couldn't take him to our room to do it and it 'had' to be done trauma style. After the Patients head CT the doc asked for a humerus in the CT bay. Mentioning the images would be much more clear in our DR room and I would be able to obtain a clear transthoracic the response I got was 'don't question me. I asked for an AP humerus and that's what I want. I can't see ALMOST everything on the Y view'. Following orders that's what I did :/
Radiology,359nq7,etrtr,6,Fri May 8 14:54:57 2015 UTC,"You did the right thing then, I didnt mean to criticize you. Thats on the doctor. Ive had situations like that, all you can do is document that the doctor requested one view so the rad doesnt think you half-assed it or something.

Radiology,359nq7,etrtr,1 point,Fri May 8 21:27:29 2015 UTC,Would this count as two views? I'm just waking up but they don't seem much different... like /u/etrtr said a trans-thoracic would do so much better
Radiology,359nq7,Glonn,2,Fri May 8 14:27:29 2015 UTC,"They aren't identical views, the centering is slightly different and there's a small amount of rotation between the two, but my Rad's would read this as two of the same view. Obviously this patient was in a lot of pain too. But yeah I would have tried the transthoracic. Even if it's suboptimal positioning, it would be worth trying."
Radiology,359nq7,thanks_for_the_fish,3,Fri May 8 14:33:57 2015 UTC,"I agree. My rads would put ""suboptimal image"".  What would the next step be? MRI/CT?"

Radiology,35aw6o,Granthree,4,Fri May 8 15:59:04 2015 UTC,"Because of the way noise propagates in an x-ray imaging system, the limiting factor or ""stage"" is the one with the lowest detection efficiency (QDE, ""Quantum Detection Efficiency""). X-rays incident on a detector can be thought of as a poisson random variable, which means the signal to noise ratio is roughly 1/sqrt(N), N being the number of photons, roughly proportional to the dose. (leaving lots of details out there, but it's accurate to first order).  Now, in most indirect X-Ray detector systems, there are multiple gain and amplification stages. And yes, increasing the gain of the second to last step, which is the photodiode (roughly the equivalent of a digital camera CCD) would improve the noise, but not beyond the limiting stage, which is usually the scintillator. I've provided a couple of image quality model references below.  Long story short, the limit on the inherent signal to noise ratio transfer properties of digital x-ray systems is not in the ""camera"" step, but the conversion of x-rays to visible photons step. There are also tradeoffs with spatial resolution to consider (greater detection means thicker scintillator which means lower spatial resolution).  Hope this helps!  Citations:  Cunningham, I. A., M.

Radiology,35aw6o,jennifex,6,Fri May 8 20:47:53 2015 UTC,"Digital detectors used in radiography are for the most part thin film transistor (TFT) arrays, which are different from CCDs. You will find very few CCD based detectors these days (some of the early digital mammography units used CCD arrays) outside of II based fluoroscopy systems. TFTs can be made much larger than CCDs which means you can produce thinner imaging panels.   TFTs are already pretty sensitive to begin with, and much more sensitive than detectors used in cameras. With cameras, the number of photons you're detecting to produce an image is already orders of magnitude higher than what's used to produce a radiographic image.  Higher sensitivity (which means detecting smaller amounts of charge) also means more thermal and electrical noise in your detected signal. You can try to get around that by cooling the detector, but in a clinical environment, it may not be all that practical. It's often hard enough to maintain the detectors at a consistent temperature to begin with.  There is tons of literature out there evaluating various types of digital image receptors.

Radiology,35aw6o,lithuaniac,3,Mon May 11 06:14:20 2015 UTC,"I don't really know anything about how digital photography works.  You're assuming x-ray is the same principle but I'm not entirely sure.  There are two main types of digital radiographic systems: indirect capture and direct capture.  Indirect capture uses what we call a scintillator to convert x-ray photons into light.  This light then exposes a photodetector which converts the amount of light received by each ""pixel"" into an analog electrical signal, which is then digitized.  A direct capture system uses amorphous selenium and an electrical charge to convert incoming x-ray photons directly into an electrical signal.  If digital photography sounds something like this, then you might be on to something.  However I wanted to add one caveat:  as digital image processing has gotten more complex, it has allowed computers to compensate for technologists' mistakes.  If we use too little x-ray photons or not enough power behind them (what we call technique) then the computer can't fix the image: it will be grainy and less diagnostic.  However, if we use too much technique, the computer is able to scale back the image and make it appear more usable.  This has led to ""exposure creep,"" meaning that technologists are more likely to overexpose a patient, trusting the computer to make the adjustments to the image necessary to make it diagnostic, than to underexpose the patient and risk repeating the image."

I graduated before the educational requirements changed (having to have at least an associates to sit for your boards) but I'd already gotten a BA before I started.   In my program, I spent 9 hours a week in class, and 31 in clinic. We were expected to learn most of the material on our own, and the focus was more on practice, which in this field, I think, is ultimately more important. However, any program you do, there is a minimum number of clinical hours you're required to complete before you can take your boards.   As for US versus being RT, once you've passed your boards, usually do a sono program in about a year, as opposed to the 2 years (I think) it normally takes if you just start out in sono. They're separate programs with separate licensing boards. I'm not sure how it might work in reverse.  I get the impression right now that sono isn't as over saturated as XR, but its still a growing field. There will ALWAYS be a need for medical imaging. How are they going to know what's going on in the body otherwise? :) and once you get in, you can always pay for cross training classes, or learn in the job."

Radiology,354grn,names-r-hard,6,Thu May 7 00:56:46 2015 UTC,"Since no one else has responded, I can give some general facts though it's worth noting my 2 and 4 year degrees are not in radiology/imaging, and I obviously don't personally work in these fields. Though my degrees are in a similar vein of healthcare 'technician' level degrees, and I do interface with people in the radiology field.  1.)    did any of you or your colleagues have a Bachelor's already? Or is that kind of an uncommon way to go about things?   Since around '08-09 and extending into current day there have been plenty of people with 'miscellaneous' bachelor's degrees going back to school for 2-year healthcare degrees because of the job outlooks for the healthcare field. It isn't uncommon at all, and you won't make waves in the program having a degree already.   Friends that I have had whom went through radiology/nursing/ems have had up to 50% of their class be people switching careers/going back to school. Nursing is probably the most common for that.  2.)    If you have/know anyone who has already received a Bachelor's degree, what did things look like for you when it came time to get a job?   Makes getting past HR robots slightly easier if they're programmed to look for that stuff. Might look nice to actual HR people/unit staff responsible for interviews, but that's hard to predict.  For my field I was interviewed and hired the first hospital I applied which was also my #1 choice. Though, of course my 4 year degree is in my field. But it's worth noting I don't get any pay increase for having a 4 year degree over a 2 year degree, even though it's in my field. Though, I do get a pay increase over certificate only people.   Would it mean a higher pay? More likely to be hired? More likely to be considered for promotions in a department?   Most likely not. Unless your goal is administration which usually has some arbitrary bachelors degree requirement. But if your goal is administration/management might as well just pursue healthcare administration.  3.)    What sorts of higher education are available in these fields? My plan was to go through the program, work in the field for a bit, then pursue a Master's degree. However, I'm not really sure what sorts of related Master's degrees there are.   In terms of master degrees there are Radiologist Assistants which are somewhat akin to Physician Assistants in idea, but it is a newer credential and the scope is a little bit restricted and they don't make phenomenal money for a masters degree but I would call it decent. Also, there are a relatively small number of schools that offer it, and job opportunities for RRA's depend on if your local hospitals are utilizing them or not.  I would expect in the next 10ish years Radiologist Assistants will be allowed to write the official interpretation for diagnostic imaging for the every day fractures/rule out fracture/other lower level essentially 'urgent care' level acuity imaging. And either have the radiologist glance at it and give it ye olde stamp of approval, or under applied 'oversight' in a similar vein to how some PA/NP systems work with a couple random audits etc.  And I would expect Radiology Assistants to become as ubiquitous as Physician Assistants in busier/larger hospital ER's for managing the low acuity side patient imaging responsibilities, just as the PA's are managing those patients.  And there will probably be some Radiology Assistant specializations for fluoro/gi/cath lab/ etc.  There are also just general radiographic/radiology education/administration/imaging/radiation physics (for research)/radiation engineering/masters of science with radiology focus etc type degrees all over whatever tickles for your fancy. Same for bachelors.  Or if radiology really interests you, you could just make the medical school shot with your BA in psych and try to get matched into a diagnostic radiology/IR etc residency."

The Radiologist Assistant does seem appealing, but it's a little nerve-wracking that there aren't a lot of schools that even offer it.   Pursuing the med school isn't something I've ruled out entirely, but like grad school, it'd have to wait. What if I were to pursue a Radiology Tech program, then a few years down the line med school (since I already have the bachelor's under my belt)? Is something like that unheard of? I mean, I guess it's kind of the ""scenic route"", so to speak, but would I be hindered in any way by doing that, in your opinion?"

Radiology,354grn,herdofcorgis,2,Sat May 9 09:57:27 2015 UTC,"Was waiting to get on a computer to type out my response.    I have a BA in Humanities, and like you, I grew tired of the cubicle farms I worked in.  Management where I worked was all about who you knew, and whose butts you kissed...and I wouldn't play that card.  Working in the business side of a hospital had it's perks though, because when I started my associates degree was when they were offering sign on bonuses to x-ray techs (and nurses, respiratory therapists, and lab techs).     It's not uncommon to return to school for more of a ""skilled trade"".  For my Associates program, there were students of all ages, some who worked full time around the program, others who worked part time, all with various background experience & education.   A Bachelors in a non-radiography field is unlikely to get you anything more than what your Radiography degree would get you.  Unless you somehow market the Psychology degree into your interview (My humanities degree is in a foreign language, I'd make more as an interpreter, however I did not learn enough of the language to do a great job interpreting for medical purposes).   If you have a Bachelors Degree, you can go back for your RA (Radiologist Assistant) degree.  It's a Masters program, and will allow you to operate x-ray in fluoroscopic situations (and possibly be trained to perform guided biopsies).  While looking at job postings this past summer, I saw my first RA position posting, and the pay was no better than what a technologist with two ore more advanced modalities would make.     You could also go to PA school (which doesn't require a Nursing background) and work alongside surgeons either in the operating room, or somewhat as a Nurse Practitioner does in a clinic setting.    I would recommend checking local hospital job postings near you.  As far a salary goes (in my area) sonography pays better than a standard rad tech, however, there are even less jobs within those fields.  With the rise of several healthcare oriented ""colleges"" offering associates degrees, the market is still pretty saturated here.  I graduated with my Associates in 2011, only finding call work in x-ray.  I returned to school in 2013, and graduated with my second Bachelors in 2014 (MRI specialization).  Halfway through my second Bachelors, I was working in the area I was studying (since I was a licensed technologist at the time, they could hire me for an advanced imaging area)."

As for what you're saying about my BA, as I suspected, I'd really have to market it to employers. Radiologist Assistant isn't even something I'd heard of before. Do you think that field might grow in the coming years?   I'm assuming PA is Physician's Assistant? This is also something I've considered. As for the path I'd be taking if I were to pursue that....it would be Received Psych BA--->Rad Tech or Sonographer--->Pursue the PA Masters...Is that just craziness, or would this be a reasonable course of action given my circumstances??   As you can tell, I'm feeling a bit lost in all of this, haha."

Radiology,354grn,What_the_shit_Archer,2,Fri May 8 01:09:04 2015 UTC,"I have a BA in Studio Art. I also have an AAS in Radiologic Sciences, and work as a CT and X-Ray Technologist. I absolutely love my job.  I got the BA in 2000, and worked as an artist for five years until I met my husband and moved across the country. I took a series of unfulfilling customer service jobs, and then went back to school for RadTech.   My first degree was in no way, shape, form a waste. Education is never a waste. I spent four years drawing nude models in figure drawing courses, and that still helps me to this day with radiologic positioning. (If you can't visualize the model's skeletal structure and position you're going to have one fucked up drawing).  The customer service jobs also helped me in a big way, since healthcare is essentially very personal customer service. Patients have a choice in which facility they choose to get their care, and customer service skills among healthcare staff help keep them loyal to our facility.  Tl;dr: Don't worry about an unrelated degree, and don't shy away from jobs that are ""beneath"" you (hint:no job is beneath you). All those experiences will only help you in the long run."

And that is a terrifying thought."

A BA degree is RARELY ""job training"".   Please do not convince yourself that your education has been wasted.

Chronic limb ischaemia gives Ischaemic Rest Pain which is the next step beyond claudication symptoms in most classifications of Peripheral Artery Disease (e.g. Rutherford); that pain can get some relief by walking - perhaps thats what you're referring to?"

It's not specifically an adjective but it's descriptive of what you describe. I'm sure a google will return a more readable answer than mine but I'll give it a shot.   When standing, gravity aids with blood flow (past the partial obstruction) to the extremities of the lower limb and muscles etc. However, on lying flat this gravitational assist is removed and the blood has to force it's way past the atheroma or whatever other ""thing"" is impeding blood flow. Without the help of gravity, it's nowhere near as effective and there is ischaemia. Buerger's test is where you raise a patients limb and note when the foot goes pale. I'm not sure you'd get pain as such because it's at rest, and there is less oxygen demand than in a working muscle.  Radiological link- doppler used when raising leg, can tell Buerger's angle from loss of doppler signal   Again, may be an idea, might be completely miles off, I'll drop a couple of links if I find any decent ones, otherwise, all I got is wiki stuff:  Buerger's Test  Critical Limb Ischaemia"

Radiology,352u9p,BrewerGeo,5,Wed May 6 18:22:14 2015 UTC,So glad to be in ultrasound. The thyroid shield manufacturers love him.
Radiology,352u9p,dubdad,1 point,Wed May 6 19:11:01 2015 UTC,"I'm a Rad Tech and Mammographer and I have been berated by crazed Dr. Oz fans because I refuse to use a thyroid shield on a patient during a mammogram or study involving the head neck or chest.  A) Firstly, I outright REFUSE to be forced to repeat mammos due to the shielding being in the way. Anyone who has ever worn a thyroid collar knows it's a bit bulky. And anyone who's ever done or had a Mammo knows you have to get your patient in as far as possible to get all of the breast tissue. It's not worth the extra exposure to your breast tissue, trust me.  B) A parent yelled at me after I said that I can't give his child a thyroid collar in addition to his gonadal shielding during a barium swallow study. I let out a laugh in shock. Obviously we're looking at your child's throat. A thyroid shield would be in the way. Duh.  Oy vey."
Radiology,352u9p,XRayVisionRT,7,Sat May 9 03:25:48 2015 UTC,"I believe that according to ACR that unless the primary beam is pointed directly at the gonads they don't actually recommend shielding anymore, or that it really doesn't serve much purpose. That's not to say you shouldn't be shielding. I believe that the primary beam only travels approx 6cm in the tissue outside of the collimated field. Dr Oz has freaked enough people out that they all want thyroid shielding but these people are basking in the sun like it's going to disappear tomorrow.    Try explaining radiation physics to a patient and see how well it goes. The beam travels a straight line the beam is not pointed at your neck. The only thing you've gotta worry about is scatter radiation. And unless I can shield you from the inside you're going to get exposed. I'd rather just give them a shield to get them to stop talking then try to explain all of that."
Radiology,352u9p,vaporking23,2,Wed May 6 18:02:17 2015 UTC,"I would, too, but the outpatient orthopedic center she works for doesn't have a thyroid shield; only a lap or a full apron.  She was doing erect knees for arthritis, the patient was short so the apron was out of the question, and the lap shield was covering her eggs (in her 60s).     the primary beam only travels approx 6cm in the tissue outside of the collimated field.   Would you happen to have a source for that?"
Radiology,352u9p,etrtr,5,Wed May 6 18:21:56 2015 UTC,I've had crazy mothers who wanted the kids entire head shielded for a hand x-ray. They will demand ridiculous shielding for extremity x-rays but happily consent to a CT when their kid has a tummy ache for an hour.
Radiology,352u9p,Baial,3,Wed May 6 22:22:17 2015 UTC,I always like to compare chest x-ray radiation to a flight from New York to LA and tell them isn't it weird how flight attendants aren't wearing dosimeters? If a patient isn't reassured by that anecdote and still wants a shield and it won't block anatomy I'll shield them.
Radiology,352u9p,etrtr,5,Wed May 6 21:32:26 2015 UTC,"I used to do the same, but a couple years ago I found this radiation comparison chart for background radiation which compares it to the average background radiation we receive every day.

Radiology,34zde2,jsmithofesco,1 point,Tue May 5 21:38:56 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would look for  ""on the job training"" ie cross training opportunities first and foremost. As it stands right now with the ARRT you only need 16 hours of formal education within the 2 years you plan to take your certification test for your second modality, along with your competencies. Get paid to learn instead of paying to learn :) So no, you don't HAVE to go through another 2 years of schooling, but if it's a goal of yours to do sonography you should go for any opportunity you are able to get, even if you have to work as a rad tech for a year or two while you go to a sonography program."

Radiology,34v78z,coozgoblin,3,Mon May 4 20:55:27 2015 UTC,Current CT tech in NorCal here.  A bachelors isn't necessary.  A California specific X-ray  license is required.  It's been a while but I think you just apply for it and if you've got ARRT cert you're good. You will need to pass a fluoroscopy exam to get that license.  The Fluoro test is not that bad just study the very early/basic level stuff like the actual concepts and old school tech along with the core exams performed and that should be good.  Disclaimer: I took the Fluoro test 8 years ago but I can't see it having changed very much.
Radiology,34v78z,NateNizzle,2,Tue May 5 05:47:36 2015 UTC,"Your ARRT cert will carry over to California you will just need to apply for a CRT license which will require you pay a fee. You will need to take a separate examination for your fluoro cert, a test I have heard is harder than the ARRT for some (I'm currently a student so can't speak first hand on that yet). There are quite a few CA specific laws when it comes to fluoro so definitely prepare yourself for that. It's not impossible to get a job without a fluoro cert but it helps a lot. A bachelors degree is not required... I can't help with the MRI information."

The cause will help too -- in this situation it's obviously going to be portal venous because of the pneumatosis intestinalis and history. The patient is basically at death's door. Isolated finding, you will want to look for more history. Did they have a recent ERCP/sphincterotomy? Other biliary instrumentation? What's the gallbladder and common bile duct look like? Other causes of PV gas would include diverticulitis, IBD, basically bowel pathology.  More info:  http://radiopaedia.org/articles/portal-venous-gas  http://radiopaedia.org/articles/pneumobilia"

Radiology,342mph,bubbachuck,9,Mon Apr 27 20:41:44 2015 UTC,"Lytic means bone lysis/destruction - it is describing the appearance of a specific pathological process.  Lucent is a purely descriptive term to say the bone appears less dense (is more clear/translucent - the OTHER meaning of the word Lucent, rather than the ""bright"" or ""light"" meaning) - it is technically not referring to the underlying pathological process, just how it looks on the x-ray image.  The terms have been used imprecisely, and many people use lucent to imply benign pathology - technically this is incorrect but is in common enough usage that it's become acceptable.  Technically: A lytic lesion is always going to be lucent, but a lucent lesion doesn't have to be lytic; it can be cystic for example."
Radiology,342mph,MalcontentUK,3,Tue Apr 28 02:16:24 2015 UTC,"Often used interchangeably.  Lytic I would use for a more destructive or ill defined process, lucent I would use in a more benign appearing process.  Both would be marrow/bone replacing lesions.  Lucent in terms of xrays means it lets the light through, is how I think of it.  It could be a left over term when films were not inverted where black =dense not dense = white.

Radiology,342mph,rykh7,2,Mon Apr 27 21:04:46 2015 UTC,"I'll preface this by saying that I'm not a radiologist, but when you are talking about lucency in the sense of radiologic films it means that that the x-rays are able to pass through that area more readily. I.e., they will appear ""dark"" because the xrays can penetrate that area better than others and ""expose"" the ""film"" more than if they were passing through denser tissue.   In terms a ""lytic lesion,"" that refers to a destructive process in the bone. Those areas are also more lucent because with less bone, more xrays can pass through the lesion and increase the exposure."

Radiology,341y3m,Aggietoker,2,Mon Apr 27 18:35:23 2015 UTC,Both are acceptable in my experience. It is up up to the radiologist to establish a protocol preference.

If these piercings are alloys containing any ferrous metals, you will feel a pull from the magnet. If you want to be preventive, replace your piercings with some made with non-ferrous metals. If you are unsure of your current piercings, test them out with a small magnet. I've met some MR techs that have small magnets laying around the control room for this very purpose.  Fun fact: just because a metal isn't ferromagnetic, doesn't mean it's allowed in the MR suite. They will still cause a metal artifact, and will potentially heat up and cause skin damage due to vibration."

Generally more expensive than ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals are used because of desirable properties such as low weight (e.g., aluminium), higher conductivity (e.g., copper),  non-magnetic property or resistance to corrosion (e.g., zinc).  Some non-ferrous materials are also used in the iron and steel industries.

Radiology,33z1le,Daguvry,4,Sun Apr 26 23:54:31 2015 UTC,First of all you would need to specify what you mean by your area as pay differs across the U.S.  But to answer your questioned based on my area I live in the Bay Area California. Per diem here means you are an employee of the place in question however you may or may not be guaranteed any specific amount of hours. They may have a couple shifts a week or they may just call you when they need you. The biggest difference at least here is that per diems are not entitled to benefits such as paid vacation or sick time. Also they do not get medical insurance for free or at a discount rate like a full time employee would. The per diem does however get a increase in pay to off set that. So specifically starting full time employee at my hospital as a rad tech would get 35$ an hour with benefits. A per diem gets 15% more but no benefits. Hope that helps

This varies from one hospital to the next, some per diems may only be used once or twice a month while other hospitals (such as mine) pretty much use per diems almost as if they were full time employees. Being per diem means that you get no benefits, PTO and very limited 401k options. Due to the lack of benefits, the per diem pay rate is typically a lot higher than that of a full time staffed tech. Just as an example, the per diem rate at my hospital for general x-ray is about $36/hr, when you transition to full time you lose about $7-$8/hr in pay because of all the benefits that come along with being a full time employee."

Radiology,33xojx,What_the_shit_Archer,4,Mon Apr 27 03:14:23 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't be crazy. Despite the market saturation, there will always be a need for medical imaging. I went to school after getting my BA in religion. Full time positions are scarce, but having multiple part time jobs can pay as much or more. Plus, you'd theoretically have a better chance as getting a FT spot if one opens up where you are. You could also consider being a travel tech, which pays well.  I worked part time while in school, about 16 hrs a week. My program was at a hospital, so I was there 7-330 five days a week, and I worked 430-10ish four days. But, I was lucky. I already worked in the file room of a radiology office. They paid for my school (about 3k total) and since they had late hours, I worked there while in school. They initially gave me PT hours when I graduated, and eventually a FT spot.  The hardest part for me was always being tired, but I had to work to pay my bills. I did move in with my grandmother to cut down on costs.  Its hard, but you can do it.  My typical day: I work (in a private office, not a hospital) M-F from 845-530. There are usually 3 of us in xr. (I only do xr and dexa) We basically take turns doing patients and fluoro. An average day for us is about 4 fluoro cases and 40-50 xr studies. It really varies on busy-ness, and it was the same when I was in school, some days are dead, some days I'm on my feet for all 8 hours. Its a bit busier during school months though.  I am happy with the money. My favorite things are getting to talk with patients and feeling like I'm actually making a difference in their life. Its also just super cool. Least favorite is my micromanaging boss, shitty patients who are mean to me, and doing BE's.  I thought most of the work wasn't too difficult. To me, a majority of it was memorization, espcially with positioning. The hardest part for me was physics because I just found it boring. And everyone will tell you that you memorize stuff for your boards, and forget it all when you start working. So much of it, IMHO, is being able to adapt to difficult situations and patients. Rarely is a patient as ""perfect"" as in your positioning book. You need to develop the skills to get the images you need and adjust as you go. I think of what I learned in school as a baseline or the average, but to do my job well, I had to learn how to be adjust that as necessary."
Radiology,33xojx,cherryfristado,2,Sun Apr 26 21:43:47 2015 UTC,If you do decide to go to school for radiography....I would highly recommend going to a school in the area where you want to work. 90% of our recent hires are students who did some of their clinical rotation with us. This should also be a deciding factor in which school to attend...some schools have maybe 15 clinical sites where others you might only get 3 or 4. You will most likely get your first job at one of your clinical sites.
Radiology,33xojx,InnominateMasticator,2,Sun Apr 26 20:32:33 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you on this. I was hired per diem at one of my clinical sites.

The one where rose is in the hospital for heart surgery and they're all contemplating mortality when this exchange happens:  Sophia: We've all gotten a second chance. I realized I wasn't living up to my potential. I'm gonna find out what I'm good at. Take an aptitude test. Maybe even go to law school. Dorothy: Oh, come on, Ma, you'll be 96 when you get out. Sophia: I'll be 96, anyway!  Lightbulb! I was like, fuck yea! Do I wanna regret that I didn't follow through with my 20 seconds of bravery? I'll be 34 when I'm done regardless. At least I'd have a more secure and better paying job than retail. Or do I wanna ensure that I'll still be in retail at 34? And even if it's not all it's cracked up to be, I'm hoping to at least earn enough to enjoy life.  I'm still in school, plus for something slightly different, so I can't really speak about post graduation but I just wanted to give a vote of solidarity and let you know you're not the only one and that you can make it work and will figure it out. Good luck!"

I could go to summer school and just realize..yeah, no.  Haha.  I don't work in retail, thank God, and haven't since college, but I do know what it's like to feel stuck.  I've kind of been looking around for another job, and admittedly, there's a part of me that just hopes my career will just start to click on it's own.  Assuming I got into a radiography program in 2016, I too would be 34 or pretty close to it by the time I finished.  And it makes me think about all the things I want to do and having to put them off....but then, it would be easier to do those things (traveling, trying life in another city/state, among other things) if I had a skill I could count on for income I suppose.  Hell, an acquaintance of my mom's went back to school to become an RN at 64 years old, and she's loving it!   I guess we'll see what happens.  I'm usually someone who realizes very heavily on intuition and gut feelings, but this time out, even my gut has no damn clue what I should do."

No it's not crazy, it'll be difficult but not crazy. I dropped my full time job to focus on a better long term career and I'm taking a&p I and a&p II this summer. The market is up and down so it's hard to say what it'll be when you graduate but if it comes down to it, you can use your previous experience and ba in communication to find a job after you graduate until you get your foot in the medical field. Also I'll be looking for a part time job to pay bills in the mean time."
Radiology,33xojx,Duc620Dark,3,Mon Apr 27 01:08:42 2015 UTC,"My situation closely mirrored yours. My Rad Tech degree was my 30th bday present to myself. I spent a year or so doing as many related courses at a junior college as I could to be certain this was ""the career"" for me. School was a blast, but I had the luxury of not having to work at the same time, and very minimal debt until student loans came due. It did take me almost a year after graduation to find a job (2011 graduation). I worked per diem for a small clinic for several months, then another part time with a mobile company. I currently work full time for a mobile company, and it gives me many options. My work though is radically different from a hospital or clinical setting. I'll try and answer in order here: 1. Crazy? No. Great Idea? maybe. I would say it ultimately depends on your willingness to increase debt, put life on hold, and gamble on a quick job. 2. Long term potential certainly, and there is a huge variety of work that you can get yourself into in the entire imaging field. 3. Market is tough, will likely be for quite some time. 4. Flexibility is key, to get full time I moved from San Diego to Vegas. Being willing to relocate greatly increases your marketability. 5. No work for me, all school. 6. I know the busyness varies dramatically based upon location. Clinically I had days where I would get 40ish patients depending on exams done, and the next day I would do 3. Currently when I'm not traveling to cover, I tend to see between 7-15 people a day, I do travel to all my patients at this point, be it private home, assisted living, rehab, etc. 7. I typically 4 10 hour days, with one night of backup call, and back up call on sunday. When I travel I'm the clock 40+ hours a week, and on call constantly. 8. Financially I'm pretty happy, I'd of course like more, but I'm in better shape then I ever was before, and see the future getting better slowly. 9. Favorite things: variety, transferability, science, people. Least favorite: people, lazy coworkers, getting called at 3am, broken equipment. 10. I had a strong science, and language background going into the program, for the most part it was a breeze. I am also one of those people who doesn't have to study (sorry). Hardest part I found was keeping certain positions and projections straight when presented with numerous similar choices. Also language for the California Fluoro test is so outdated and convoluted that it had me questioning whether or not I spoke English.  I would highly recommend taking a medical terminology course, and the highest level anatomy class you can get yourself into. The anatomy lab I took prior to program was much harder then anything I did in program, and gave me a handy lead up. Also, shadow several techs if you, really get into the job before you do it. And be sure to observe a BE being performed. My more then $0.02 for you And good luck with whatever you end up doing."

You're age is fine, your situation is fairly common in this field. You can work full-time and it will be challenging but people do it. I recommend part-time work personally.  It has it's pros and it's cons. Burn out is a thing depending on where you end up working and how lucky/unlucky you get. Many go on to make it a life long career in one fashion or another. But, some people end up leaving healthcare for something else because they don't end up liking it our burn out, I know many people going back to school for whatever reason to get out of this field. Some people bounce back and forth between healthcare and whatever else they have background in. I know a few who work as rad techs PRN and their full time job is an entirely different career.   Hope this helps."
Radiology,33xzyw,Grumpypiglet,7,Sun Apr 26 18:44:13 2015 UTC,"Which country are you in?  For the UK, the Health Protection Agency offers this document (PDF Copy from RCR website linked here), which includes the underlying science and which complies with the IR(ME)R 2000 and 2006 regulations.  Basically for a low dose examination (such as a CXR) the risks of any long term or serious effects on a foetus that is accidentally irradiated is relatively low - in the order of < 1 in 1,000,000 for a CXR alone for example. In such cases if the women confirms she is certain she is not pregnant and the LMP is within 28 days, it is regarded as safe to go ahead. (Obviously if the LMP is greater than 28 days or she is in doubt, then there is a chance of pregnancy, so testing is required or should be considered at the very least in terms of whether the test is definitely needed)  For a high dose examination (CTs for example), they have a much greater risk of serious detrimental effects to the foetus - in the order of 1/10,000 to 1/1000 or MORE. If the woman is within 10 days of her LMP then the likelihood of being pregnant is extremely low, so you can go ahead if the woman is sure about her LMP and certain she could not be pregnant. If it the LMP is more than 10 days ago AND/OR the woman is unsure whether she could be pregnant then pregnancy testing is recommended because if there is foetus present the risk it will be harmed is high.  The HPA document explains all the science (including the basics about Stochastic and Deterministic radiation) and reasoning in more detail and is well worth a read (it's 15 pages long but you can skip through all the bits you probably already know from your training). Obviously the HPA guidence is only advice, and some places may have even stricter criteria but the basic reasoning should be the same."

Radiology,33jbpg,PleaseorinoHelp,11,Wed Apr 22 23:50:46 2015 UTC,"Why do you say this stuff is ""dangerous in itself""?  CT/CTA's and MRI's are not dangerous at all, very low risk.   Just to clear things up, regarding question 2, this is all normal stuff. He was just really wordy about it. Petrous apices are typically aerated. Mastoids are clear.   Regarding Question 1 and 3. It sounds like you have a left cerebellopontine mass. The radiologist didn't spell it out, but is hinting that it could be a meningioma, other option is a vestibular schwannoma (aka acoustic neuroma). It's a CT so the level of detail isn't there, which is why you are getting an MRI to further evaluation/characterize (take a better look at) this mass. The mass pushes on the brainstem a bit, which these masses often do.   Edit: I read the addendum part rather than just your question where it sounded like he was confident it was extra-axial. But I guess that's not the case. He included hemangioblastoma which would be located IN the cerebellum. Dunno, I'd have to look at the images. And CT is lower resolution and you can't tell very much the difference in tissues.... which is why you are getting an MRI with contrast, which will be much more telling.   BTW - is your ringing/pulse in your ears on the left or right (clinical info given to the radiologist said 'right' but the ording people mess up all the time)?"
Radiology,33jbpg,Musicman425,2,Thu Apr 23 00:35:32 2015 UTC,"The pulse is in the right ear. It's been going on for about 8 months and has been getting gradually quieter (audio level of a low whisper now), and only occurs when I have my neck strained while lying down.   Please feel free to visit this page which has my experience more detailed. I know medical advice is against the rules but... it really helps to speak to someone. I am not experiencing severe symptoms that I know of aside from just the tinnitus but I wrote a long list there just in case.   I'm scared of the MRI in specific because I think this will be done with contrast, which has that gallinidium metal that studies have supposedly proven to be linked to cancer and brain abnormalities. But then again, if I do have a tumor my brain already is abnormal. Ugh D:   edit: Thank you."
Radiology,33jbpg,diffusion_restricted,11,Thu Apr 23 00:48:42 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about the MRI. No link exists that I am aware of between gadolinium contrast and cancer or ""brain abnormalities,"" so unless you've seen some paper to suggest this, don't worry. The only known risks would be allergic reaction and NSF (systemic fibrosis) which is exceedingly rare, so much so that it's not even really worth considering."
Radiology,33jbpg,Musicman425,4,Thu Apr 23 01:03:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I'm getting the MRI for sure now =)"
Radiology,33jbpg,latinilv,9,Thu Apr 23 03:02:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, MRI with contrast is super safe. The trace amount of metal (gadolinium) is bound to an agent and your body clears it. We do MRI's all day everyday, and they are VERY safe, so relax about that.   If it's 2.5 cm, it's pretty likely there is something there. I can't tell you what it is, haven't looked at images and you really do need the MRI. I can only tell you most likely things based on the description, your age (you're probably younger since your vessels all look good), and likelihood of tumors based on occurrences and where it's located.   Based on urgency, that's a discussion between you and your doctors. Meningioma or Vestibular Schwannoma are not urgent, and there are things such as gamma knife which are options. Hemangioblastoma or a partially thrombosed posterior circulation aneurysm (where this thing is would be next to vertebral or basilar artery) then there would be more urgency for some type of treatment. Good luck, best to pick these things up early."
Radiology,33jbpg,MalcontentUK,5,Thu Apr 23 01:03:03 2015 UTC,"I'm no radiologist, but a ENT resident, I'll give my shot in clarifying you.   Yes, that's the measured size of the mass. It's roundish, so it has 2.1x2.2cm in the largest cross-section. Calcification maybe of significance in the diferencial diagnosis of the tumor (Vestibular schwannoma tends not to have calcifications, meningiomas have) Nope, it's just saying that your middle ear is fine. The tumor has a volume significant enough to displace displace brainstem from it's place, and may exert compression in it. MRI is the gold standard study in ponto-cerebelar angle tumors. Altough no procedure is risk free, and MRI takes more time, it's a fairly safe procedure, in which you won't receive radiation, and the contrast injection very rarely leads to alergic reactions."

Radiology,33jbpg,cherryfristado,19,Thu Apr 23 00:55:16 2015 UTC,"This post illustrates exactly why medical advice should not be sought on Reddit. I've actually seen people throwing around alternative diagnoses in this very thread; although I'm sure this is well intentioned please ignore this. Nobody in this thread has seen the images and your Radiologist has given a couple of different possibilities based on what he has seen.  I can see you're understandably very anxious about what's going on, and I have much sympathy for you. It's obviously come as a surprise and a shock, and the uncertainty at this stage would be very stressful for anyone. But please stop reading up about this stuff on the internet - it's just a bad idea: there is a lot of frightening stuff on the internet, much of it is actually total garbage. Even the correct stuff can be very frightening if you haven't got the medical training or experience to put it in context - and that context is you. No matter how inquisitive or intelligent you are, please please don't torture yourself by reading scary things on the internet, the vast majority of which will very likely not apply to you.   The only person who can help you put all this into context and explain things to you is your doctor. He/She has access to the report, any other test results and crucially is able to see the images and discuss them with the Radiologist. I imagine when you were told the findings of the CT scan it was all a bit of a blur? I'd suggest the best idea is to make an appointment to see your doctor, and take a list of questions you'd like to know the answer to. They may be able to answer some for you straight away, and others may need to await more tests - but at least you will know where you're at and you can save yourself the distress of reading things on the internet and wondering if that applies to you.   If it turns out I do have a tumor there, how crucial is it that I get it removed as soon as possible? I've been reading about what the surgery can do to people (facial paralysis, deafness, other brain problems... death...) and it's, um, making me feel bad. Maybe it's better to let myself die. Sorry to say.    One final thing I wanted to say; from reading your posts (such as this above) I think you may have  made a common mistake which may be a source of some of your anxiety: Tumour does NOT automatically mean Cancer. Yes, it is a possibility, but from reading that report I'd say it is clear they don't know exactly what they're dealing with yet. That is why you're having more tests. I think this is something you specifically need to talk to your doctor about - hopefully they can help put your mind more at ease on this topic."

It can take three or four drafts before you have a worthy one, and even then, a resume is never perfect - and never complete.  Some notes: * Put your name in bold at the top of the page. You want your name to stand out when they're flipping through a stack of 100 resumes that all just look like monotonous paragraphs of text   Order your work experience from most recent to most dated I prefer the sections in this order: Name and personal information, Education, Clinical Experience, Work Experience, and then Certifications & Organizations If you didn't keep track of how many clinical hours you've spent at every site, go ahead and figure that out In line with my previous bullet, resumes look stellar when they're numbers focused. Anyone can write that they're ""good at patient care"". Wow, great. You're a shining star for thinking your good at a generic skill. Instead, can you list how many patients you did a day on average? What was your repeat rate? Did you get any customer service feedback compliments? To summarize a post from /r/resumes: ""Your only bullet points should be accomplishments, not job descriptions. Everything else is fluff."" If you can list the specific GE equipment you used, it looks much better. The same numbers way of thinking goes for all your previous work experience. ""Managing money"" doesn't mean anything to me. How much money? How much sales per week? Were you the sole key-holder? How much stock? You need to go line-by-line through your bullet points and say to yourself - ""Is this something that someone would already expect me to be doing? If so, then how can I rewrite so that it doesn't just sound like filler?""  I don't particularly like objective statements, but that's everyone's opinion. They seem redundant, like a cover letter within a resume to go along with your other cover letter. /r/resumes doesn't like them either. You need to not take up so much space. If your resume can't fit on one page, then it needs to be taken under the chopping block. Formatting helps quite a bit: do understand that in Microsoft word, you can shrink not only the line spacing, but you should minimize space between sections. It's blank space. Extend your margins to the maximum allowable print size. If a line item can fit on one line, why isn't it? Center your headers and bold them. Put all the work experience dates on the right side, on the same line as your titles. The ""Goals"" section needs to die. The ""Skills"" section can also die. If a recruiter sees that you've only been in X-ray school for two years, then they'll already know how your skills are. You're not X-ray Jesus. To say anything is ""Intermediate"" is subjective.

Stuff like this is much too general. Try to research the aims of different hospitals and make yourself appear to be a viable candidate that can contribute to their goals. For example, you say that you provide ""optimal patient care"". How did you do this? Did you individualize the care that you gave to patients? Were you sensitive to cultural differences that may be important to them? Were you empathetic to their needs? And what kinds of outcomes did this produce? Did you receive positive feedback? And from whom, and how often? Managers read tons of resumes all the time. Try to make yours stand out and really convince people that  you will be an asset to their team. What really helped me with writing was coming up with a list of tasks/notable things I did during my clinical placement and asking myself, ""how did this help the department/hospital, and in what way?"".  Edit- alternatively you can ask, ""how is this task/thing I did special, and why does it matter?"""

The interviews were easier when the person I was interviewing would disclose certain things about themselves.  The one that stands out was a guy who immediately blurted out ""I stutter really bad when I'm nervous and sometimes get facial tics"".  Just that one statement helped me tremendously, I might have otherwise thought he was under the influence of some weird substance.  He worked with our company for 3 years."

Doesn't even need any signatures...I just put the date on it so they know when 48-72 hours is. If there's a chance they'll be admitted or are already admitted, I slip that paper into their chart so the nurses know.

Radiology,334hy6,stevomtrini,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:09:17 2015 UTC,"Here's an app review I wrote for e-Anatomy. It'll be published in the Journal of Digital Imaging soon.

Image quality and responsiveness are excellent. Content is quite comprehensive and multiple modalities are included (illustrations, XR, MR, CT, 3D).  Cons:  User interface slightly unintuitive. Home screen customization is difficult.   At A Glance: Users of the website will feel right at home with this mobile adaptation of the e-Anatomy online reference. With multiple modalities (radiography, MR, CT, diagrams, and others), the service is a well-labeled and accurate reference covering the entire body. At the moment, this app should represent the standard for mobile anatomy references.  Full Review  Intro: e-Anatomy represents one of the oldest and most developed web-based anatomy resources available for radiologists and health-care professionals. Many radiology residencies and academic centers hold institutional licenses. In my practice, when seeking anatomic information I will often use a hard-book reference like Frank Netter’s Atlas of Human Anatomy (1) or a Google Image search. However, for users preferring to use a mobile device, those who are on-the-go or without a connection, or anyone who may require a comprehensive anatomic reference in his pocket, the e-Anatomy app should represent the standard in mobile anatomy references.  Users of the website will feel right at home with this mobile adaptation of the e-Anatomy reference. With multiple modalities (radiography, MR, CT, diagrams, and others), the service is a well-labeled, comprehensive and accurate resource.  Purpose / Features / Content: The e-Anatomy website and app divide the body into 43 categories, such as “Brain: Atlas of human anatomy with MRI”, “Radiological anatomy of the lower limb”, and “Heart: illustrated anatomy”. Within each selection are further sub-categories which can be viewed individually or as a group in sequence. For instance, the “Brain” MR category can be viewed showing 132 axial, 157 coronal, 64 sagittal, and 26 3D images in sequence. A given image will typically have numerous labeled anatomical structures. The types of anatomical structures labeled can be selected easily via a drop down menu, e.g. on a brain MR slice, arterial labels can be shown or hidden. This allows the user to specify the anatomical structures of interest labeled without being visually overwhelmed. Structures can also be selected for in-depth description and other images of that structure.  Usability: The recently overhauled user interface is now excellent. Although initially somewhat unintuitive, the UI works very well once the user has learned it: a single finger swiping up and down controls the place within the series of images while two-finger gestures allow zooming and panning. A simple drop-down menu to choose structures for labeling can be cumbersome, but the app authors have done well with the difficult balance of usability versus depth of information. Some small quirks remain – including difficulty rearranging the home screen – but overall the usability represents an excellent adaptation to the mobile environment.  Good: Excellent UI. Comprehensive and accurate. High image quality. Search function works well.  Room for Improvement: Categories are confusing, redundant (“Brain: Atlas of human anatomy” versus “Cross-sectional anatomy of the brain”?). Navigation scheme works better for cross-sectional imaging than illustrations or radiographs  Screenshots (minimum of two)  Fig. 1: The home screen Fig. 2: Axial MR brain slice in portrait mode with venous sinuses, white matter, and basal ganglia labels enabled.

Radiology,32wobo,mattel-inc,21,Fri Apr 17 09:48:37 2015 UTC,"(I'm not a radiologist)  Firstly, the MRI's don't use radiation. They use a magnetic field which has no known side effects for short term exposure.  Secondly, the Pelvic CT was about twice the radiation you get in a year, and the X-ray's combined were probably near what you get in a year. So total you have the radiation exposure of a 28 year old.  However, the consideration is if this particular CT scan is ~5x radiation of a normal pelvic CT, (due to them repeating it 5 times with your leg in different positions) it would be like having an additional ~10 years of normal background radiation exposure just to your lady bits all at once. It's not so much the total amount of radiation here, it's the period of time you would be receiving it. Also, the fact that yearly background radiation is calculated by your whole body, and this would be focused right on your reproductive organ zone.  It wouldn't make you sterile, though. I don't believe there have ever been studies done on the lower threshold needed to cause fertility problems in women. However, for acute sterility to occur the general consensus is you need between 3-30Gy of radiation. Even just 3Gy of radiation works out to be ~3000mSv.[1] The CT you are describing would at very most be 30mSv. So 1/100th to 1/1,000th of the dose to cause acute sterility.  However, as the radiologist probably suspects the CT may not be completely necessary for the surgery. And further, while 30mSv of radiation isn't immediately fry your ovaries and give you cancer amounts of radiation, it isn't necessarily benign.  TL;DR: The radiation you've received so far has probably had a negligible effect on your reproductive organs. And if you get the CT it would probably have a negligible effect as well.  As I said, I'm not a radiologist. ([1]: Portions of this have been simplified for convenience) and some assumptions made. I also want to reiterate as far as I know, no detailed studies have been done on the exact effects of a single 15-30mSv dose of radiation to female reproductive organs. This is more like a case of 'better-safe-than-sorry' and as other people have mentioned, there are probably alternatives."

Radiology,32wobo,cavvz,2,Fri Apr 17 14:40:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you SO much for your response and for making this simple for me to understand. You've put my mind at ease. I recall them saying that ""we don't want to do this whilst you're in your child-bearing years"" so I assumed that it did something in terms of fertility.

Radiology,32wobo,latinilv,2,Fri Apr 17 23:38:19 2015 UTC,hhahahah I definitely wouldn't TL;DR a text about radiantion in my reproductive organs..
Radiology,32wobo,MalcontentUK,10,Fri Apr 17 16:13:24 2015 UTC,"Firstly, no you have not messed up your reproductive organs. The reluctance to scan you is because of the increased risk to your reproductive organs by exposing them to x-rays because they are more sensitive to them. It does not mean you will have problems but we do know that the more times anyone has x-ray exposure to their ovaries it very slightly increases the chances of problems in the future. It is only a very tiny increase in risk of problems for any woman but the key idea is that if the exposure isn't really necessary then it should be avoided.   To give you some idea of what we're talking about - everybody alive has a roughly 1 in 5 lifetime chance of dying from cancer (scary statistic I know). For an average person the additional lifetime risk of a serious cancer from radiation from a CT of the whole Abdomen and Pelvis is in the region of 1 in 10,000 - a very tiny increase. However certain organs are much more sensitive to radiation than others, and the Ovaries are one of those organs. So the risk for a young woman to get radiation exposure covering her Ovaries is higher but still small - more like 1 in 1,000. But that is for each scan - so even though the risks are small, the best thing to do in practice is always avoid doing x-rays and CT scans covering the ovaries unless absolutely necessary.  Now I can't speak about the specifics of your case but I can say that in general (especially if you've already had a CT of the pelvis before) any Radiographer/Rad Tech and any Radiologist would be duty bound to query whether you really need another scan. If there is any doubt then the safest thing to do is cancel the scan until we can be certain you really do need it - we want to be certain that the benefits of the scan outweigh the very small risks associated with the scan itself. Often other non-radiation techniques, such as MRI, can answer the same questions as the CT but occasionally only the CT will do. Often that will involve a discussion between a Radiologist and your Surgeon to see if it is necessary as is happening in your case. But be reassured that the key concern is doing what is best for you, not just now but weighing that up against what could happen in the distant future."
Radiology,32wobo,emptygroove,2,Fri Apr 17 12:40:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your informative response. I really appreciate it.  I am going ahead with the scan next Tuesday with the top Radiologist in the department. I think this is because it's a complex kind of scan and they want to get it right the first time; rather than do it wrong and have to call me back to do it again.  As mentioned in a previous post, I have a labral tear that was diagnosed in 2014. I have lived with bad back and hip pain for 3 years following a Motor Vehicle Accident.  I just looked over the past CT scan in 2012 which said that I had a ""bone island present in the left supra-acetabular ilium"" - ""No abnormalities are detected. No cause for the patients symptoms is identified""  I think the bone island was the cause all along and all these scans could have been avoided :("
Radiology,32wobo,ba_d,4,Sat Apr 18 00:25:34 2015 UTC,"Most of the time, exams are denied because there is another option that would be safer for the patient.   Theoretically, every time a physician orders any kind of test, they do a mental ""risk-benefit analysis"" to see if the possible side effects are worth the risk of getting the results of the test."

Radiology,32tgbq,cataphractoid,8,Thu Apr 16 22:51:52 2015 UTC,"In a research capacity I have just had a run of dealing with a number of sub-par PACS administrators who got the job on virtue of their radiographic experience rather than their IT experience. The job overlap is actually quite small, and in some cases could be done better by an IT person with some training in PACS, RIS and the DICOM format than by radiographers without an IT bent.  I don't know the full job description, but from my limited experience with them: if you can't answer (or quickly find out) the following, then maybe it is not for you:   How would I retrieve and deidentify the last 400 CT thorax studies and export the Structured Dose DICOM files to disk? Is dcm4chee the best tool for this? How can I add my computer as a new node on your PACS? The web client the people on the ward use cannot see the 3D reformats made by the radiologist or the summary series, yet the radiologists can. What are the possible reasons for this? Is it likely to be a simple fix? How long until it works? Will it require PACS downtime? The previous PACS administrator had what he called the 'ghost PACS' running on his own computer he said was analagous to a RAID 1 setup. What are the benefits? What are the risks? Will I cope with the fact that I will only be recognized when things break and fail, and if all is running well I will be invisible?"
Radiology,32tgbq,gnoxy,5,Thu Apr 16 23:46:52 2015 UTC,On #5 I have found that if I sit down with my physicians about twice a year and go through their hanging protocols with them you are no longer the invisible person who is only around when things fail.  But the helpful person who cares about them and can help when things work and when they are broken :)

I am a pacs admin with a background in radiology and my pacs counterpart has an IT background. While he had a head start on me when it came to networking aspects, my understanding of radiology exams, workflows, etc. has made me a more proficient pacs admin.   We both look at the job in completely different ways. Im not saying an IT background always makes for a worse pacs admin but I think once the employee with a radiology background becomes competent in IT, they make for a better fit."

Radiology,32owz1,yomaster19,2,Wed Apr 15 18:36:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, we use the term interchangeably but dead truly means the pixel is out then it is black.  Hot or Stuck pixels mean the colors of the sub-pixels remains on at all times creating a bright white artifact. I know this is r/radiology but these hot pixels are even more relevant in mammography readings.  I believe the FDA has regulations specific to this topic."
Radiology,32owz1,extcm1,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:01:16 2015 UTC,It were dead pixels wouldn't they then be in the spot on every image? B/c these are intermittent.
Radiology,32owz1,extcm1,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:11:27 2015 UTC,"I believe that you can see intermittent pixel issues caused by the underlying transistors of the sub pixels.

Radiology,32owz1,INGWR,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:26:44 2015 UTC,"I've always seen them as white, and we were taught that they were white because the detector isn't receiving any dose at that particular detector element, so it can't turn black from irradiation. Hence, white pixels."

Radiology,32nh0d,hiccupanon,7,Wed Apr 15 04:51:51 2015 UTC,"USA tech here. LOVE IT! I've always had one to use. It gives you the easiest upright chest and/or abdomen images. All chests should be done upright if possible. And once you're in place, your exam goes really fast. It takes two variables (motion and positioning) out of the equation.  I've never had any problem with parents. I just explain that ""It won't hurt but that it makes them angry. Then they cry and take in a deep breath!"" I apron the parent and let them hold the child's hands for some belief of comfort. And that baby in the picture is in the Pigg wrong--both arms should be straight up by the head (the left arm is going to wiggle out.). It does take some practice getting them into it correctly. The biggest issue for me is the child kicking their legs and twisting their hips. But it's very stable. And a brand new one is kind of ""tight"" and the parts are ""sticky"" if  you get my meaning, so it needs to be used to break it in. Yes they're expensive (about $5000 new in US), but worth every penny to me."
Radiology,32nh0d,mamacat49,5,Wed Apr 15 12:40:00 2015 UTC,"I work in the US and have always had a Pigg-o-stat to use. It was mildly traumatic learning to use them, but I am a big fan now.  The benefits I have experienced:   My exams with the Pigg-o-stat are quicker. You can set up everything very thoroughly before anyone even comes in the room. I have a much lower repeat rate.  My coning is better and the parents can come behind the shield with me to save on excess radiation (a big concern in my departments).  Most kids hate being in the Pigg-o-stat, but that is good for getting proper inspiration/expiration! Within a minute of getting out, nearly all my patients are as happy as they were before going in. A couple kids have been hard to calm afterwards, but much more often I have the trouble of children who don't mind being strapped in AT ALL, and it's hard to get proper breathing.   The difficulties I have met with them:   Sizing is annoying. We have 2 different sized... tubes. The small one I have never had a child small enough to use properly. The large one is a catch-all for 6 month olds to 2 year olds and, as you can guess, isn't entirely satisfactory for all those. It can freak out parents a bit, but I've really not had much trouble with that. In the last two years I've had maybe 2 or 3 sets of parents react badly to it. Much MUCH more common, I have parents come in with a 3-4 year old and when I ask them to help hold their child for a non-Pigg exam, they say ""Why not just use that thing?"" It strikes me as cold. Also, they kid doesn't fit, so shut up and help your child out, please. The wheel locks on ours aren't very good. Any child over 1 year old can make the device rock if they kick enough.  Waiting for the images to process is awkward. You can either take the child out ASAP and risk having to put them back in for a repeat or you can leave them trapped longer, possibly prolonging a stressful situation (for child, parents, and anyone listening) longer.  It can be a little difficult to operate alone, especially for larger/stronger children. Loading a child into the Pigg-o-stat is something that parents aren't always good at helping with (not to mention language barriers). It can require that very specific kind of ""gentle force"" to get the child's arms in the right position.   While I wrote a bit more on the difficulties, they mostly boil down to the specific equipment my clinics bought and the social aspect of the exam. The benefits (quicker exams, less exposure, less repeats) completely outweigh the troubles in my experience."
Radiology,32nh0d,TastyClown,3,Wed Apr 15 13:36:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your insight! Having used pigg-o-stats during my training in Canada, I absolutely agree with all your points! The hard part for me now is trying to convince my department to implement them, most radiographers at work look at pictures of pigg-o-stats and just think ""why is that necessary?"" and ""that looks unsafe"", so it'll take a bit of convincing to get to them! It's a foreign concept for them and that's totally understandable."
Radiology,32nh0d,Aggietoker,2,Wed Apr 15 16:44:44 2015 UTC,"There are two facilities I work at that don't use these because parents complained and said they would not bring their kids back to us if we continued to use this ""torture device"". So now parents gets radiated and our re-shoot rate on kids under 2 for chests and abdomens has increased significantly (many parents are useless when it comes to holding their kids still, go figure). But hey the customer is always right..."
Radiology,32nh0d,ErinJung,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:49:00 2015 UTC,"Ya, where I work we do them supine AP with parents holding down the kid, and I definitely have more repeats because of malrotation doing this method because parents are simply not reliable at immobilizing their own kids. A lot of radiographers here also open up the cones a bit more side to side and up and down for squirmy kids, in order to make sure they don't clip off any anatomy and to prevent repeating. It's like ""great, you didn't have to repeat it, but you have half the mandible, half the abdomen and the parent's hands in the image now, so how much dose did you really save there?"""
Radiology,32nh0d,MK12Mod0SuperSoaker,3,Wed Apr 15 21:48:35 2015 UTC,"One of my clinical sites in school had what I can only describe as a modified high chair.  http://www.highrivertimes.com/2011/02/07/chair-makes-x-rays-less-traumatic-for-children Kinda like the one in the article except we didn't have straps for the arms. We just dad the parents hold their arms which could either work in your favor or not depending on how well the parents followed directions.  At my current job (in peds) we have Pigg-o-stat. I was nervous to use it in the beginning but have since grown to love it.   I usually ask the parents if any of their kids have ever had an x-Ray before b/c sometimes the parents are already familiar with the pigg-o-stat. If they aren't I explain that this kids ""this age"" are very hard to X-ray no matter how well behaved they are. By using the pigg-o-stat we will get the best picture without risking repeated images. I also explain that it will not hurt them but will most likely make them mad. I then let them know that it may sound horrible but that them being mad actually makes for a better image. When they are mad and crying it makes it possible to get the picture when their lungs are more full of air.  I usually get everything in the room set up before going to get the patient. Once the parents know what we are going to do I take the kid from the parents are start wrestling the kid into it. I usually have to ask the parent to help pull their arms up straight so I can get it snug enough.  Like one other person said, ours has 2 sizes but I'm usually using the larger size. Most kids small enough for the small aren't old enough to hold their beards up yet. With the large size I've had anywhere from a chunky 9 month old literally busting out of it to skinny 3 year olds in it. Depending on height, I've had kids up 30lbs. In our pigg-o-stat I've learned that taller stronger kids can & will try to push back from the Bucky so I ask the parents of the kid to hang onto their hands to they can't tip it over.

So what you are suggesting is doing around 4 years training to become a rad tech and then going back to the beginning and doing prerequisites before going through med school (5 years), internship (1-2 years) and then radiology training (4-5 years). That's a long slog!"
Radiology,32j0r3,Doboy64,5,Tue Apr 14 07:58:46 2015 UTC,"Literally doing this right now.   My past schooling is as follows:  -Undergrad Biology degree 4 years -Radiological tech degree 2.5 years -Worked at hospital as Rad Tech 4 years   My current/future outlook is as follows: -Currently in Medical School (4 years) -Residency for Radiology (5 years) -Work at hospital as Radiologist (rest of life)   So you can see my past is basically your plan.   The good parts, it gave me money and time in my 20's (working as a rad tech) to have fun, travel the world and buy things.   The bad parts, it went to school for 2.5 years more than I needed to. I will be in my mid 30's before I make 'real' income.   So to sum it up, it depends on what you want in life. I wanted to travel and have fun in what I think is my younger years, but I guess you can do that while in med school as well.   Its a long road (13+ years) to become a radiologist. Whereas its entirely possible to be a rad tech in 2.5 years.   Sorry for the mess of text."
Radiology,32j0r3,fake_n00b,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:19:45 2015 UTC,Have you taken step 1 and what med school do you go to? I wouldnt give the op false hopes unless you have a good chance or getting in.

I haven't taken the USMLE step one yet, but hopefully will do well enough to get into a good residency program.   Again, its just a rough outline so OP knows their choices."
Radiology,32j0r3,diffusion_restricted,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:04:43 2015 UTC,radiology residency is currently not very competitive...
Radiology,32j0r3,MalcontentUK,2,Fri Apr 17 03:50:35 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it would be a long slog but also remember there would be no guarantees that you'd get into Radiology after all that work to 1st become a doctor. Entry to Radiology training is highly competitive within medicine (Whether in the UK, USA, Canada etc), so bear that in mind - would you be happy if you did all this work for 10+ years and then couldn't even get in to Radiology?  My advice - as someone who has been through the direct route - is that if you really know you want to be Radiologist then the best way would be to get on and do it - it's an expensive, hard and long enough path even without deviations. But if you're at all unsure then you must go back a step - do you want to be a Doctor ? Because that on its own is already an extremely hard route to go down: very competitive, very expensive, high responsibility and stress and it will define and shape your life in ways that are hard to comprehend at 17 or 18. And Rad Tech vs Doctor are very different career paths - they require different skill-sets, different training, derive job satisfaction from different elements, and offer different lifestyles (not just money but more importantly in the ways the jobs impact the rest of your life) - it's a huge but ultimately personal decision."
Radiology,32j0r3,fake_n00b,2,Tue Apr 14 14:34:27 2015 UTC,"Everyone talks about the length of training, but that is not the main issue.  Getting into Med school and then radiology is incredibly incredibly competitive.  I cannot stress this enough.  Did I mention it is incredibly competitive?"

Radiology,32j0r3,sagarsash,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:03:22 2015 UTC,Why is this?
Radiology,32j0r3,Iatros,1 point,Sun Apr 19 09:36:06 2015 UTC,"Hopefully you're still curious about this. I happened upon this thread rather late. Anyway, rads is less competitive now for a variety of reasons.   First, and probably foremost, people are realizing that rads isn't the ""lifestyle"" field it once was. Volume is up, reimbursement is down, and hospitals are starting to expect reads within an hour or so 24/7/365.  This trend will only get worse as things like length of stay and turn-around times on reads become even more accepted as measures of ""quality"" (a dubious claim at best, and laughable at worst).  Secondly, the job market for new attendings was REALLY bad only a few years ago. People don't want to invest a decade of their lives (and 200-500k of [non-dischargeable even in bankruptcy] student loan debt) into something that they can't get a job with afterwards. The job market sucks because when the stock market collapsed in 2008, everyone's retirement funds went into the shitter, so they all kept working. Rads isn't what you'd call a physically demanding specialty. I have attendings well into their 60s still reading cases daily.  Third, the piece of shit that is the ABR allows foreign medical graduates a loophole/backdoor into radiology. You can come to the US, do 4 fellowships at the same institution, and then sit for the rads boards. Granted, they still have visa issues and have to pass all the step exams, but no other speciality that I'm aware of lets you not do a residency and still practice in that field. You may ask why this is: well, in non-accredited fellowships (basically, everything but neuro and IR), fellows can staff cases and have no duty hour restrictions of any kind. So academic departments actually want those fellows to be there as a source of cheap attending-level labor. Don't want to cover a holiday? Stick the fellow on call! Etc.  Fourth, rads used to make shittons of money in the fee-for-service model; all of our cases were billed as ""procedures."" Well, payors are wising up to this and we now read a bunch of cases for which we assume 100% of the liability, but get paid 0 dollars for our knowledge and expertise. Some payors have asinine rules that say you can't get paid for more than one study per day, for instance. Well, what happens when granny has metastatic breast CA and needs a chest, abdomen, and pelvis for staging purposes? Now you just eat the cost and work for free.   There are probably other things, too, but I think that gives you some idea of why rads is no longer competitive."

Radiology,32j0r3,Ridditmyreddit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:01:22 2015 UTC,"When weighing your options many have covered here the path to Radiologist and the time it will require. Remember 2 things: 1. The only path to becoming a Radiologist (physician) leads through both 4 years of medical school and internship/residency (4-5), no way around it.  2. The path to medical school is not as clean as it appears after you have completed pre-requisites, many (myself included) work for a year or more in multiple application cycles to find and get accepted to a medical school. When I was in your shoes I thought that I would attend a university, complete my bachelors in 4 years, graduate, and begin medical school that next fall. It was a year and a half of soul searching, application polishing, and reapplication between completing my bachelors and beginning medical school. It is a very long road to becoming a physician, it like anything has its pro's and cons it is good you are taking the time now to weigh your options and see if this is a path you wish to begin walking."

This is most often found on HSG or contrast HyCoSy, and MR is the gold standard for clarification.  A septate uterus is not massively rare, we see this semi-regularly (but I specialise in uro/gynae so maybe I'm biased?). Septate uterus can lead to a degree of subfertility but does not make a person infertile, just more difficult to get pregnant as an egg ovulated from one side may not be fertilised by sperm that travel up the opposite side. It can also lead to an increased risk of premature delivery typically in the first and second trimesters due to placental failure by implantation on the septum, and also failure to progress in labour as the septation is not muscular enough to make forceful contractions. Treatment options include a septoplasty via hysteroscopy.  This would make a great case for some board exams, given the combined finding of a septate uterus and horseshoe kidney, which are part of the spectrum of Mullerian Duct anomolies.

Radiology,32bk07,MalcontentUK,2,Mon Apr 13 12:43:13 2015 UTC,"Google ACR Contrast Guide. It's got a breakdown of all that.   As far as premed protocols, when followed they can mitigate, not prevent, allergic reactions. This is only really viable in patients with very mild reactions. If someone had throat swelling or respiratory involvement, they wouldn't be considered a candidate for premedication.   To my knowledge, if a patient isn't renally compromised, Creat shouldn't be effected much at all.   As an aside, think of it like this. Contrast goes everywhere blood goes. If you think there is a problem that would have either more blood or less blood in an organ, contrast would probably be useful. There are some caveats, especially in the brain, but that's a good rule of thumb. Try to remember that some organs have very little blood supply, like bones, and maybe wouldn't benefit from contrast."

Radiology,327lv6,mjbat7,13,Sat Apr 11 11:01:24 2015 UTC,"I chased down the consultant and explained that a scrotal x-ray wasn't really a thing, but he was adamant he wanted to show air in the scrotum. It was a public holiday so I just took a pelvis x-ray. His scrotum couldn't be contained in a diaper. It looked like he had a football hiding under the blanket as I wheeled the bed in. As someone else pointed out, percussion or even palpate on would surely diagnose it. A scrotum nearly 15cm across but light as air. The poor guy had such bad subcutaneous emphysema that it was visibly tracking down his left arm while we watched. Within 20 mins his arm looked like the Michelin man. It was also going up his neck and down his abdomen obviously into his scrotum."

Who cares if there is air in the scrotum, is the leaky pleura that is the issue. Maybe they wanted a picture for a laugh."

Radiology,329ee2,the_jaxxster,1 point,Sat Apr 11 19:47:02 2015 UTC,"I hope I will be of some help, I went to muhlenburg for radiography. The reason they only have day classes, from what I understand, is clinical can only be done during the day bc they have to have a teacher at the school at the same time. Since it's a much smaller program than lets say nursing they don't have the staff to accommodate. Also you will be with the same students for all classes from start to graduation much like grade school.  The difference in accreditation works like this you're getting your associates diploma from ucc which is now being required it used to just be a certificate in your field which is what you'll receive from muhlenburg. Overall I had a great experience there.  Sonography is a great field to get into if you can make the classes work for you... If I remember correctly it's only a year and a half!"

She passed, if she'd failed, it would have let her pay. This tried and proved trick has been around for nursing exams for several years.

Radiology,31zaqa,maegan0apple,2,Thu Apr 9 09:25:10 2015 UTC,Do you mean that you put a right marker on it when it's really a left? Because the marker is on the correct side of the anatomy. I think your wording was just a little weird on that comment.
Radiology,31zaqa,maegan0apple,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:21:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, I just realised it is actually on the lateral side. Its just the rest of my group had the markers on the other side, leading me to believe I was the one who got it wrong. The thing is, our instructor stopped the last guy from putting it where it is on mine, and moved it to the other side, the medial side.   However, when I look closely at elbow anatomy and the x-ray, I can see the coronoid process(is that right to say) all the way across the bone, leading me to believe this is a left elbow, not a right.   I cant tell if I'm looking at the capitulum + trochlea or the olecranon.   (We were told it was a right elbow. and we were also given a right marker. it was not up to us to pick that)   So now I'm pretty confused. We have to write a prac report up for this and if its a left elbow and not a right, I'm not sure if I should be acknowledging that fact."
Radiology,31zaqa,Loki89-,2,Fri Apr 10 20:02:37 2015 UTC,"Well that's kinda confusing that the teacher moved the marker... It's supposed to go on the lateral side for extremities so your placement on this image is correct. Now idk if the teacher was trying to take a left arm and pretend it's a right, or if they were trying to trick you or what. But a right arm x-ray can look like a left if it's flipped vertically (or like a mirror of itself). I've taken images with a c arm that were flipped the wrong way but had the correct marker on it, and the file room called me all confused, asking if I marked it wrong. So there's no way to tell that I'm aware of."

You can see the outline of the olecranon on this image on this website.  Also, the radial head is a dead giveaway if you can see it, which you should be able to if the rotation of the arm is correct on your AP. You can't really see it on the medial oblique but then you can see the olecranon really well.  Look over this website, it's pretty helpful.

You will find bad apples in patients, docs, techs, nurses, desk staff, etc.  It is just part of the deal.  Just do your job and move on.  Try not to let them get to you too much.  Seeing that you are mobile, you are usually the easiest target.  I am sure if you warm up to them, they will (well most) warm up to you...eventually."

Then I feel like they view me as the enemy because they think I'm the one creating work for them. I'm right there with you buddy, sometimes I just wanna be nasty back at them.

Radiology,31wt2i,addictinsane,10,Thu Apr 9 02:02:16 2015 UTC,Probably because it's such a heavily used dept so having it on the main floor is easier for ER and outpatients to find.
Radiology,31wt2i,MalcontentUK,3,Wed Apr 8 20:10:23 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree this is probably a big factor.
Radiology,31wt2i,J_F_Kevorkian,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:37:36 2015 UTC,All serious cases go through radiology. It needs to be centrally located.
Radiology,31wt2i,DennisEMorrow,8,Fri Apr 10 03:02:36 2015 UTC,"It's cheaper being on the first floor. CT and Xray rooms need all primary walls to be lead lined. If the room is not on the ground floor, that means you need to line the floor to protect the room below from radiation. Also, as someone said, it's crucial that certain diagnostic rooms are on the same floor as the ER"
Radiology,31wt2i,Yellowbenzene,3,Thu Apr 9 00:58:41 2015 UTC,"Usually next to the ""front door"" ie. A&E.  Also near to theatres.  Also, it's very hard to put an MRI scanner on the fourth floor."
Radiology,31wt2i,SheenaMalfoy,3,Wed Apr 8 20:40:34 2015 UTC,"I think it has more to do with being on the same floor as ER. One hospital I work at has both DI and ER on the third floor (the place is on a hill, so both departments and the main entrance are the third floor, no the people weren't crazy and forcing ambulance patients into an elevator to get to emergency). In another they're both on the first floor, and actually right next to each other on the floor itself, so I think it has more to do with their proximity to each other than to their actual locations."
Radiology,31wt2i,AdamJaz,3,Thu Apr 9 00:58:47 2015 UTC,"One point that's missing from the comments so far: Hospital Outpatient Departments. Radiology departments at hospitals generally see a lot of outpatients and bring in a lot of revenue for an organization. Keeping the department on the first floor helps with convenience, which in turn encourages folks to return."
Radiology,31wt2i,TastyClown,2,Thu Apr 9 03:22:41 2015 UTC,"It's a lot cheaper, easier, and quicker to build radiology on the ground floor or below due to all the heavy equipment, wiring, safety precautions, structural requirements and more involved. If you NEED to have it somewhere else, you can (I've worked on the 3rd and 4th floors before), but if all is equal, might as well shave off some bucks."

Radiology,31wt2i,SchuylerL,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:22:49 2015 UTC,"You're very observant! Excellent question! Here is my theory. The emergency department is on the first floor. The ED needs fast access to the CT machine to determine if a stoke victim is suffering from a block or a bleed. You wouldn't split up the NICU into two locations, so why would you split up the imaging department? That being said, sometimes the MRI machine or LINACs are in the back or in the basement because distance is a form of shielding."
Radiology,31wt2i,SheenaMalfoy,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:50:02 2015 UTC,"MRI has no radiation, thus they need no shielding."
Radiology,31wt2i,SchuylerL,5,Thu Apr 9 00:55:59 2015 UTC,"If you read carefully I didn't say MRI uses radiation. There is still MRI safety to be considered.

Radiology,31wt2i,Baial,1 point,Thu Apr 9 05:00:31 2015 UTC,"I think it was that you don't want cars driving by a non shielded window 10 ft away from the MRI, I think 40 ft is the accetable limits, but I'm not positive. As for the mobile units, I'm sure they have di2different requirements of shielding and different magnet strengths."

Radiology,31tyjy,FootlessCthulu,6,Wed Apr 8 03:18:42 2015 UTC,"In my experience, a BS is highly desirable if you aim to enter management.  The BS may include training in a second modality such as CT or MRI.  I can't think of a time when getting a BS is a bad idea.  If you want to work diagnostic xray and you want to start ASAP and as cheaply as possible, an associate degree is great.  Some of the best techs I've ever worked with came through associate or certificate programs.  Programs vary considerably from one to the next though, so don't take my word for it.  Your best bet is to find the programs near you and question the faculty directly about the benefits of each."
Radiology,31tyjy,Weenie,4,Wed Apr 8 03:46:47 2015 UTC,"Where are you located? Typically an AS will allow you to work, and the benefits of the BS are not that much greater- but the BS is a good way of continuing education. The BS would be preferable I assume, but wouldnt really offer you any better job prospects. Again, depending on location. Not sure what you mean by specialize. If you mean advancing into modalities such as MRI, CT, Interventional Procedures, ect. You can pursue modilities as we call them with either an AS or  BS. Modalitles require experience (signatures) doing the exams and passing a secondary certification exam. Not sure if I have been helpful at all. Good Luck!"
Radiology,31tyjy,pascal46,2,Wed Apr 8 03:42:38 2015 UTC,"I am located in WV. That was very helpful! And yes that is what I meant by specializing. I was looking into an associates program and a program that offered a BS, but its tuition was more than double that of the associates."
Radiology,31tyjy,pascal46,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:50:43 2015 UTC,Well I can say that you do not have to have  BS to move on to modalities. A BS is valuable but those with an AS and those with a BS will end up working right beside each other with much the same employment oppourtunities in my experience.

Apparently x-ray was the simplest way to have legal proof of cause of death so that's why they needed us.

And what experience/ credentials helped you the most? What do you like/ dislike about your job? What is your day like? Are you payed well? Do you get raises? Are you union? Why/ why not? Will/ do you get continuing education?  Do you plan to go back to school or switch to a different job? What is the job market like where you are?

Pt. transporting apparently is a good job to get into the program with because you have your foot in the door (helps occasionally) and you move patients so you know how to get them onto the table.   3.I love the great patients, doing an exam without repeats, and having someone compliment me. I hate being rushed when it gets busy, but you gotta move fast. I also hate the patients who don't cooperate.   Come in, check for patients. Usually no patients at 8 am immediately so I wipe everything down, check linen, check stock, then sit on my butt reading or studying until patients come in. Clean room after every patient, make sure stock and linen is okay, check random films to see if I can identify pathology.   5.N/A   Yes, CT + MRI and bachelors/masters possibly   7.If RA opens up in NJ, yes.

And what experience/ credentials helped you the most? contingent x-ray @ clinic: being honest.  Interviewed with the surgeon, he kept me on staff when my schedule changed (changing clinic hours to accommodate my availability) MRI: hired while in clinicals   What do you like/ dislike about your job? Something new to see every day, always changing.  Sometime the docs are difficult to work with, but everybody has their day.   What is your day like? Play with big magnet, repeat.   Are you payed well? Do you get raises? Are you union? Why/ why not? Yes, yes, no.  Union is only available for nurses at certain hospitals.   Will/ do you get continuing education? I did for MR specifically.  I have seen postings for RA that start less than what I make in MRI, so I might have finally reached an end to my formal education.  That's not to say there isn't courses within the field on special procedures/equipment/etc.   Do you plan to go back to school or switch to a different job? Already did, I worked in insurance billing prior to radiography.    What is the job market like where you are? Hit or miss   What level of patient interaction do you usually have? Lots, MRI is stressful, and many patients are anxious both about the test and the results.  Plus, a mistake could cost you your life (or mine), so I have to be certain patients are safe to enter the scan room.    Do you have any advice? Anything you wished you knew when you were in my position? Treat your observation & clinical hours as a job interview.  Be punctual, eager to learn, and help.

Radiology,30xwwy,mamacat49,2,Wed Apr 1 01:44:27 2015 UTC,"what sort of education do you have?  2 year community college - any less and its probably a BS for profit school.  How did you get your job? And what experience/ credentials helped you the most?  During your radiology program you will more than likely do clinical rotations at hospitals, its rather important to make a good impression - I got mine being a baller x-ray tech student  What do you like/ dislike about your job? I like the pay and the job security.  nothing I dislike about my job can be attributed to my job.  stupid people work in ALL professions.   What is your day like? I do CT scans at a large trauma hospital.  I work a split shift (start in the afternoon, work late into the night) and start off doing out patient scans until I move to the ER after we finish out patients.  I sit on reddit whenever I'm not working.  Are you payed well? Do you get raises? Are you union? Why/ why not? Paid well (~85k), I get raises every year, not in a union but pretty much everyone else is.  I've never heard of a union doing anything more than collecting dues.  Will/ do you get continuing education? you have to do CEUs every other year to maintain professional licensing.  Most hospitals have some form of reimbursement, but i'm not aware of anyone who thinks CEUs are useful/worthwhile.    Do you plan to go back to school or switch to a different job? I would if I had the energy or was smarter when I finished HS.  The pay difference to be a nurse or PA isn't worth the school for me personally.   What is the job market like where you are? It's okay.  It was amazing 15 years ago, but then 3-4 new schools opened up and started churning out x-ray techs like whoa.  What level of patient interaction do you usually have? Direct patient contact. We do everything from starting IVs, rectal contrast, cleaning up someone who just shit themselves etc etc  Do you have any advice? Anything you wished you knew when you were in my position?   x-ray is a great profession.  Once you're certified by the governing body (ARRT) you can move anywhere in the US and work.  I think some states may require an additional test, but i've never heard talk of any state being hard to work in.   You can choose to work in a clinic M-F no holidays/weekends/call or go work in a hospital an deal with odd hours/call/etc but get paid more for doing so.  My recommendation : x-ray is a great profession, if you can stomach some of the ""nasty shit"" people do.  by that I mean, if icky feet, blood, poop, etc bother you... you might not want to get into healthcare.  the good news -> you get used to all that stuff really quick.  As others have said, treat everything in your schooling as a job interview."
Radiology,30vg46,coralto,6,Tue Mar 31 00:53:23 2015 UTC,"Six years, working both X-ray and CT   What is the job market like?   Lukewarm at best. It depends where you plan to work as some areas are better than others. Big cities have lots of hospitals and clinics, but obviously the fiercest competition. If you plan on a major city, expect to be a casual for a few years, maybe even working multiple locations to make full-time equivalent hours. Sometimes you get lucky, like I did, and somebody vacates an undesirable full-time position but don't count on it. Usually your best bet is whichever facility you do your clinical year in, but obviously expect competition to be high from your classmates. Fortunately, you have a skill set that can take you anywhere in the country if you want.   What is the workplace like?   Again, it varies. A hospital will typically give you a diverse working environment with plenty of opportunities to grow and develop, as well as good equipment, benefits, and pay - part of the reason why such positions are highly coveted. Smaller clinics can vary widely since they'll be privately operated. I've had co-workers tell me of clinics with antiquated equipment, crap hours, and crap pay. I work in a major trauma center so there's lot of orthopedics, neurology, and angiography experience available.   Some sites say the wage is 20-30$ per hour to start. Is this true?   I think I was about $28 an hour when I started. I think we're in low-30's now for new hires. With shift premiums I'm up to about $39 an hour now. Here's an analysis of salaries for our profession nation-wide, giving you general ideas of the averages you can expect from province to province.   I see that getting certified in CT is one way to move up once I've been working for a while. Is this a good plan? What other options are available?   CT certification is definitely helpful for your resume, though you'll find most hospitals that have CT departments still tend to provide on-the-job training if they take you into such positions. CT certification only really helps if you're trying to get hired as an outsider into a CT position. Hospitals tend to hire inside before turning to outside sources so its not as necessary as you might think. Still, the CT certification program is a good way to handle your ongoing education hours for a few years and it does help with the job. Nonetheless, where I work, I'd say maybe less than a quarter of our CT techs have the actual certification but their experience more than makes up for it.  There are other options, of course - MRI for example but that requires at least two more years of study and training. From what I've heard from co-workers, the MRI course is a lot harder than general X-ray.  Hope that helps...feel free to ask any further questions."
Radiology,30vg46,CommissarAJ,1 point,Tue Mar 31 02:19:03 2015 UTC,"I have a PhD in medical physics, where my thesis work was on MRI. Unfortunately, it turns out that the academic job market is highly competitive and poorly paid. As a result, I was actually thinking of becoming an MRI tech.  So a few questions... Would people view the PhD as an asset or a liability? Overqualification can sometimes hurt, after all. Moreover, do you think it would be possible to get any technologist credits for my doctoral studies? For what it's worth, I understand MRI physics very well (in fact, I've even taught it to radiology interns); do you think I'd be able to challenge any of the courses?"
Radiology,30vg46,MRI_PhD,3,Tue Mar 31 11:09:57 2015 UTC,"Would people view the PhD as an asset or a liability?   Probably neither. You wouldn't be the first MRT I've seen with high levels of post-secondary education, though you'd probably be the first that was willingly forgoing that previous education (usually its immigrants whose credentials aren't accepted). You definitely wouldn't have any trouble getting accepted into the training programs, though I believe most MRI training programs in Canada require you have already completed the X-Ray Technology course first (as in, become an MRT (R) first).  Whether your past education could be used as credits would depend on the school. My program, for example, didn't have separate courses with credits - we bounced back and forth through the academic portion from various topics. It was more elementary school with just one classroom and the teachers switching between the various units (positioning, anatomy, critique, etc) as the class progressed. Even if you didn't, you'd probably be able to blow through the courses easily - I doubt anything in these college-level programs would be as difficult as PhD level stuff."

Quick back (no pun intended) story.  I have been active duty for 14 years.  The initial injury I believe to be sometime during a 2009 deployment.  Jumping out of big trucks with heavy gear apparently isn't good on your back.  I was diagnosed Sep 2010 with grade 1 spondylolisthesis of the L5 with a pars defect, and a fractured spinal process. This can all be seen in the before images.   Now me being military I was in and out of ""PT"" for 4 years before I was seen by a Dr. that wanted to at least do something to fix it.  Mar 2014 I was MRI'd and it was shown to be a high grade 2 with (IMO- severe) neuropathy in my right leg.  I couldn't walk or sit for more than  few minutes.  Laying down was in the fetal position and sleep was irregular due to the radiating pain. I had the steroid injections only because it is a ""prerequisite"" to be referred to a neurosurgeon.  March 2014 I was referred to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio and saw the surgeon and it was decided that surgery was the best option to realign the vertebrae and move the nerve bundle and stabilize the area.    7 months later and I am now in the process of being medically separated from the Army.....   hooray...=/"

Since I have almost 90 days of leave accrued right now I will be able to pick the furthest date and sign out on terminal.  My Dr. and I have been planning this since I returned from surgery.  To start the MEB 6-7 months afterwards to allow for me to heal on Army time.  Then MEB for 4-8 months still healing so that I'm relatively g2g for a civ. job.  I will (should) be receiving my disability pay as soon as my terminal leave ends.

From what I have been told and Dallas tends to pay better than Austin but I find the cost of living is about the same. I've also been told San Antonio tends to pay less though I have not researched that.   Most places won't consider you if your from outside the area and a lot of the time have online filters that will automatically reject you for not being from the area.

The Haller index is what most insurance companies use to determine the severity for cosmetic purposes, which is the ratio of internal width to internal depth (inner rib to inner rib: anterior spine to nearest sternum). If symptoms can be attributed to this, then the Haller index is not as important.

However I won't be doing anything unless I absolutely have to.

Take, for example, a simple medical test like a H&H (hemoglobin and hematocrit), which measures how much hemoglobin and red blood cells (and, incidentally, the oxygen carrying capacity) are in your blood. You get a number back from the test. The ""normal values"" were calculated by measuring a large population of healthy people: using statistical analysis, we calculate the ""normal values"" as a range such that about 95% of the healthy population will fall into the normal range. This also means that about 5% of the population (who are ostensibly healthy and ""normal"") will have abnormal lab values. In most cases, it would not be appropriate to treat those patients as they do not have a disease.  Now, in my example of a simple blood test, you get back a definite number. When a radiologist looks at an x-ray or a CT scan, the required analysis is a lot more complex. There's anatomic variations from person to person that could look like disease, but isn't. This is especially true when you're talking about the early stages of some diseases. If the radiologist says there's early findings of disease when no disease is present, this is known as ""over-calling"". If the radiologist disregards ambiguous findings of disease when disease is actually present, this is known as ""under-calling"". The cost of ""over-calling"" disease is that sometimes inappropriate (and expensive) treatments are given. The cost of ""under-calling"" disease is that the early stages of disease are often the times when treatment is most effective (and cheaper than treating when it has progressed to later, more severe stages).  Sometimes radiologists may be led into over-calling disease based on the clinical information they get from the clinical physicians. Sometimes they  may be led into over-calling disease based on the idea that doing so protects them from being sued.  And sometimes, clinicians (even highly trained, subspecialty physicians like rheumatologists) can be over confident in their ability to interpret medical imaging studies. However, if the rheumatologist has examined you and says he/she has no clinical suspicion that you have sacroiliitis...that would seem to be a good sign."
Radiology,2zsyt1,soylentdream,1 point,Sat Mar 21 16:01:57 2015 UTC,"It's just I've been having lots of lower back pain, bum pain and leg pain. When I got back the CT I was actually happy that he/she found something. And the more I researched it, the more I felt like I had some SI joint issues.  So when the rheumatologist said it doesn't look like it... I was pretty down about it and confused. Especially since I get such awful pain, something has to show up right?  That's interesting to hear, and I actually am grateful that radiologists do that.   Thanks for this"
Radiology,2zsyt1,thebigslide,8,Sun Mar 22 04:21:03 2015 UTC,Of course we can get it wrong  But in your case the rheumatologist could be wrong and the radiologist correct. You just dont know. After all the rheumatologist has not been trained to look at CT scans.
Radiology,2zsyt1,AnotherRadiologist,1 point,Sat Mar 21 21:23:53 2015 UTC,"It's more than likely the radiologist was hedging.  Especially if the rheumatologist actually had a reasonable PE and Hx to work with.  ""Early bilateral sacroiliitis"" could well be sub-clinical and the pt's primary had no clue, so just referred."
Radiology,2zsyt1,ondavid,5,Sun Mar 22 04:07:34 2015 UTC,I disagree. I don't think it's 'more than likely' the radiologist was hedging. I think it's about equally as likely as a rheumatologist trying to be a radiologist.
Radiology,2zsyt1,doknowharm,3,Sun Mar 22 08:10:06 2015 UTC,"The correct answer is...  All the time.   It is humanly impossible to read every study with perfect accuracy. Impossible. Any radiologist that claims they do is delusional and lying to themselves and their patients.   There are many reasons. There are no medical imaging studies that I can think of that are 100% sensitive or 100% specific. You add inter-observer variability to that.  Add radiologist training/sub specialty expertise. Add how tired the radiologist is or how many cases of sacroiliitis they've seen lately, of varying degrees of severity.   It's just impossible.   While you may have imaging findings suggestive of a diagnosis, clinicians (the doctors and providers that know you personally, have laid hands on you, taken your history, and order the tests) know that you may not be clinically demonstrating any symptoms of that diagnosis. And vice versa. (That's really just another way of saying no test is 100% sensitive/specific.)  If I described every single minuscule abnormality on every single study, I'd be spending hours on an exam that in reality I only have no more than 15-30 minutes to read (I mostly read PET/CTs).   And ultimately we do sometimes just outright get it wrong.  Read the whole report and ask to speak with the radiologist if you have questions about why a certain diagnosis was made. If that's not possible, go over the report and pictures with your rheumatologist. Hopefully it's a report with a good findings section where the radiologist gives something to describe and rationalize why he/she is diagnosing something."
Radiology,2zsyt1,AnotherRadiologist,7,Sat Mar 21 16:13:21 2015 UTC,"but, in a team setting, i have found that working with the two radiologist i work with has added a ton of sensitivity and specificity to each others diagnosis. the better i am as a clinician and the more info i give to them, the better they are back to me which in turn increases my accuracy. synergy.  giving an ambiguous diagnosis or clinical question and asking someone to find a needle in a haystack is bullshit. they may also find a nail and some rings and coins etc."

Most important thing is that you do well in the interview and you fit in the budget.    X-ray is GS5-GS9.  With 3+ years of experience you can come in at GS7.  So if you put on the application that is the lowest grade you will accept you may not get an interview at all.    Don't sell yourself short on your skills, but don't shoot yourself in the foot trying to come in at a high GS level either.  If you are willing to move OP just apply everywhere you can.

Better to pay a little more for the proper shipping than get dinged with a dangerous goods fee.  Next, go to your local crafty supply shop and get chocolate or candy moulds and plastic polymer. Very thin layer of polymer + lead letter(s) + second layer of polymer = lead marker.

You could probably use some metal Rs and Ls from a craft store as a starting point? Then you could probably buy some molds and fill them with a hard plastic with the letters in the middle.
Radiology,2yzyqy,Its_apparent,2,Sat Mar 14 16:05:55 2015 UTC,I was thinking about using radiopaque metal too! I might try using these as a starting point since it'll be easier to acquire than lead letters.

Radiology,2z0d3o,GbyeGirl,3,Sat Mar 14 11:13:19 2015 UTC,"I attended there a few years ago. Only have good things to say about the program. Went for the Mri program, finished in about 3 months, passed my boards and have been employed as an Mri tech ever since. They prepare you very well for the boards and definitely know their stuff. Even after I finished my clinicals and was still a little shaky, they let me come back whenever I wanted to continue my clinicals to get a little more competent."
Radiology,2z0d3o,Matron820,3,Sat Mar 14 23:53:25 2015 UTC,"I went through their CT program and I live in Las Vegas so I had fly out there for the clinical portion of their program but they took care of lodging for me while I was there. It's not a scam by any means, the reason you get your comps quickly is due to the fact that they're a high volume outpatient center. The only drawback to their program is that they in no way, shape, or form prepare you to work in a  hospital setting. The protocols and procedures in a hospital are damn near a complete 180 from those that you do in an outpatient setting. The virtual classroom instruction you get from them will be enough for you to pass your boards when the time comes but you're really going to have to find a hospital that's willing to further train you if they hire you, seeing as how you'll only have two weeks of clinical experience. The techs that you work with at the place you'll be doing you're clinicals are all very knowledgable and all have 2-3 modalities under their belt so they really know their shit. Make sure you brush up on your Spanish before going over there lol, 90% of the patients that come through there are Spanish speaking only."

Radiology,2ypqcx,has-13,3,Wed Mar 11 20:03:00 2015 UTC,"Anatomy, for sure.  It'll make it a lot easier when you are in ST1 doing your part 1 FRCR exam.  If your dissertation can be radiology related than even better.  Much of anatomy teaching to medical students these days is based on imaging so if you can find an angle there it would be pretty useful for your application.  I have a BSc hons in public health!  Not much use to me these days.  General advice - do audits, present them, and definitely do a taster week.  If you can attend local and national conferences then do that also."
Radiology,2ypqcx,Yellowbenzene,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:29:02 2015 UTC,"That's fantastic thanks!  Are the public healthy ones at all applicable to radiology? I'm currently at Birmingham, and they don't do anatomy and I'd rather not go to London. That really leaves Leeds, Keele, Bristol, and manchester I think in England and I'm not sure which would be the most useful course. Ideally I would stay in brum, but I guess if anatomy is much more useful if go for that.   Thanks for the reply!  Edit: also I was wondering what the physics is like? I didn't do a level physics, and is it all very hardcore and conceptually difficult stuff?"
Radiology,2ypqcx,Yellowbenzene,3,Wed Mar 11 22:55:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say not really - the general skills are applicable to future work in radiology research, but the subject matter wasn't.  It will still look good on your application, whatever you do.    What else is on offer?  Other subjects might be useful in a more general sense, for example history of medicine.  Being a well-rounded applicant can also stand you in good stead remember.  Anatomy is the one I wished I did though - my mate did it and did a research project on lower limb vessels, perfect for a possible career in IR.  He's now a GP though.  FRCR physics is quite hard, but manageable.  The book they recommend (Farr) is not the most accessible piece of writing.  I have an A in A level physics and this was much harder.  There are no calculations to do though, it is more conceptual stuff."
Radiology,2ypqcx,Yellowbenzene,1 point,Thu Mar 12 08:01:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks again for the reply.   At Birmingham there're subjects like public health, international health, some clinical science ones, and there is actually a history of medicine one too.   Going off what you've said and what makes sense I imagine anatomy is going to be probably the most useful if I'm definitely going into radiology - which I intend to do.   Would you say an extensive understanding of physics is needed for day-to-day radiologist work?"
Radiology,2ypqcx,Nheea,3,Thu Mar 12 08:15:47 2015 UTC,You definitely need to understand the physics.  Every modality has problems and limitations and you will need to be able to identity and explain them to properly read the images in the event of artefacts and equipment problems.  Particularly in intervention where you'd be using the equipment yourself.
Radiology,2ypqcx,Yellowbenzene,1 point,Thu Mar 12 08:28:07 2015 UTC,"If your dissertation can be radiology related than even better.   Does that help?

Radiology,2ypqcx,dopamean,3,Wed Mar 18 07:42:49 2015 UTC,"I would say that Intercalation doesn't make as much of a practical difference as you might imagine. Personally I would look at Intercalating as a way of honing your CV towards Radiology rather than being useful in future Radiology practice. Remember it will be at least 4-5 years after your intercalation year before you would actually start Radiology so how much of that experience will be practically useful or recallable will very much depend on you and may not be as much as you'd think.   But in terms of the CV applying to Radiology (which is competitive) there may be a slight advantage if you do something Radiology related - particularly Radiology intercalation itself -  it will help show an enduring interest in the subject if you build on it with taster weeks and radiology themed projects (e.g. Audits, maybe even a small research project). Anatomy will also look good but is less specific for Radiology (unless it's an Imaging Anatomy intercalation). To be clear, no intercalation will count against you, just that doing Radiology might give a very small boost in Radiology applications.  But I don't want to overstate the benefits of Intercalation; it's undoubtedly good in itself but it's not really a necessity for most specialities and actually what you do after university is much more important. In the end the reasons to Intercalate are because you want to do it, will enjoy the subject matter and don't mind spending an extra year at university."
Radiology,2ypqcx,dopamean,2,Fri Mar 13 02:36:13 2015 UTC,"Seconding anatomy. I was originally planning to go into radiology whilst in medical school however chose to go into core medical training instead at the start of my FY2 year.  I intercalated in medical physics and biomechanical engineering at UCL in my 3rd year. We had students from other medical schools and not just UCL. http://www.ucl.ac.uk/medphys  Modules that were covered were things like theory behind CT / MRI / Ultrasound, radiotherapy, lasers in medicine, physiological monitoring etc.   From what I have seen of the first Royal College of Radiologists examination, it is split into a physics section and anatomy section. Having done the intercalated BSc, you are set for anything physics related that may come up in the exam."

I don't know if this is particular to the area I'm in (Texas), but it makes sense to me especially fresh out of school. CT has a lot more in common with conventional radiography, and can therefore be learned much quicker. In contrast, MR may involve sectional anatomy but involves entirely different physics and acquisition methods."

Radiology,2ymesy,silflay,2,Wed Mar 11 01:22:23 2015 UTC,"Yup, I was just having this conversation with a co-worker yesterday.

The occasional head or A/P, sure, but not full time.  Anyway, I was lucky enough to be in a program that included 2 semesters of our department's lead CT tech teaching us the modality.  So those that are into it, like me, get a nice head start.  And yes, it has been very easy to learn fresh out of school.  I graduated last June and will be taking the CT boards within a few weeks.   I'd definitely recommend CT first if you want both."

Look at your job market and go where the work is.  All the registries in the world won't do you any good if you're not working.  I would say probably 25% of the CT techs I work with are also registered in either MR or Nucs but can't find jobs in those fields."
Radiology,2ymesy,herdofcorgis,1 point,Wed Mar 11 12:21:35 2015 UTC,I think I'd pick MR because it would probably be easier to cross train into CT later.  In my experience it's very hard to find a place to cross train you in MR.

I didn't mean to seem attacking, I've been on both sides from what I remember from my time as a peds patient (one week inpatient on the thoracic surgery floor), it was scary and I was drugged up and even as a 13 year old I just wanted people to leave me alone.  Now as an adult who was in the hospital for a few days because of seizures last summer, I had the same scared out of my mind feelings. Yeah, I was post-ictal and whatnot. The patient side of things can be really scary. I try to remember that when dealing with patients. Even highly educated patients (like me) won't be able to understand what is happening in some circumstances.  In a rad related note- when I got out of the CT scanner I told the tech I thought I was about to have another seizure but managed to ask if they saw any masses or lesions (the medical stide of me was still worrying about cancer ((the scan was clean))."

So it's much less traumatic if you get your x-rays done first."

Radiology,2y1qlh,Pigsty_,2,Thu Mar 5 18:37:29 2015 UTC,"I'm about to graduate from a rad tech program. I honestly wish I had just gone the route of a PA or at least RN.  The pay isn't as good as everyone tells you.  19/20 starting an hour (at least in Texas).  There's not much room for growth beyond working in cath lab or admin. Also , I'm not even sure I'll find a job when I graduate.  I'm doing clinicals right now  hoping the hospital likes me enough to hire me.    I don't fully regret going into RT.  I've learned a lot, enough to realize I want to work in health care.  But yea, still wish I knew about PA school 3 years ago"
Radiology,2y1qlh,anyonebutjulian,2,Fri Mar 6 00:16:54 2015 UTC,Holy hell 140 students?!? Is toured like the only school around?  We started with 32 students and that was a lot.
Radiology,2y1qlh,vaporking23,2,Fri Mar 6 00:23:56 2015 UTC,"WOW, A whole lot of negative here.  I am surprised.    TL;DR Then just read number 2 and number 5  1)  If your looking for a job in the same region that there is a Rad Tech program then yeah the market is over saturated.  2) Its worth depends on your living standards now.  If your currently working full time at minimum wage then its worth it.  If your worried about a job after school I recomend trying to find a job at a local hospital, specifically one you will be doing a clinical rotation through, and even more specifically in the Radiology Department.  Having prior work experince in health care looks good.  Having prior work experience in DI even better.  3) If the techs are unhappy then the students will be too.  If the techs love their job then the students will love being there.  MAny techs hate having students tag along therefore whenever there are students around they are miserable.  Ideally this wouldn't be the case but reality is it happens.  I don't know how common it is across the country but everyplace has people like this.  4) People drop the program for all kinds of reasons.  I had 6 people drop out of my class after our first clinical rotation.  They had 0 concept of what hospital life would be like and couldn't handle it  In addition to these 6 we had 2 people drop mid-way through due to poor grades, and another girl who couldn't pass her finals at the end of the course.  As well as one guy who was booted out of the program when it became apparent he wasn't mature enough to be in a patient care setting, and another who was booted for stalking a secretary from his clinical site.  5)  First of all, nobody hiring a fresh grad gives two shits about your school grades.  Do what you got to do to pass but don't kill yourself.  I don't know how they do it elsewhere but my program was set up so that we would spend one day on campus in class then the next in  a clinical.   There wasn't any balancing of those two as they were combined essentially.  As far as work, work 4 hours at night and every weekend is how I did it.  Still got bills and rent to pay.   6) Depends on your options.  I know of many people who go through the rad tech program and work part time as a tech to help pay for higher levels of education.  Many hospitals will pay part or all of higher education costs if it's health care related with the caveat being you would have to work full time to reap those benefits(but not always).  7)  I'm in upstate NY, I have no idea.  I know when I first began looking for work as school was finishing up I know my area is underpaid compared to the average at the time.      Final thought:  Your clinical rotations are auditions with that hospital for when you graduate.  If your work ethic sucks they won't consider you when you apply.  If you can't grab the basic concepts of positioning they won't consider you.  The biggest mistake I see students make is that they treat clinical like a class.  It isn't.  Pretend it is your job and that your the new guy.  Learn the work flow, how to deal with paperwork, learn your way around etc...  show some initiative and for god sake stop practicing positioning on each other and do some god damn x-rays of real patients."

Radiology,2y1qlh,poorpinto,1 point,Thu Mar 5 21:22:37 2015 UTC,"I went to school at a hospital near Atlanta, GA.   The market is saturated everywhere but I think slightly less-so in the Southeast US. My class graduated 18 and 4 students were hired on after graduation. Not sure how quickly the others were able to find jobs. I moved away and it took me 1 and a half years to find a job. If I could do it again, I'd probably look into something else. It took me way too long to find a job, and I don't love the job I have now. I have some money but I'm not exactly happy with the thing I spend 40-50 hours a week doing. All of the students in my program went through cycles of being extremely miserable. Ours was a 2-year, year-round program in which every student had to be clocked in for 40 hours a week. We had to punch in on the hospital time clock system and would be punished for being late. This 40 hours would be divided between classes and clinicals. Students were miserable because the academic side of things was challenging and stressful (anything below an 80% was failing) and the clinical side was hard, thankless work. Some of the techs students worked with during clinicals were very unpleasant. Many students drop the program because it's mentally and physically exhausting. It may leave you no room in your life for normal social activities, in my case leading to depression. The programs also leave you very little room to work outside of school, so it'll be difficult to pay your bills. I worked for the hospital after school for 8 to 24 hours per week. This means that I was at that same hospital for up to 64 hours in a week. It was very taxing. Many of the students in my program received too many ""demerits"" (for clocking in late, unexcused absences, wearing unapproved garments, stuff like that) and were involuntarily dropped from the program. How did I get through my program? Academically, I barely skated by through the semester but then I'd study really hard for the finals. I have a good work ethic, so I tended to be very helpful during clinicals. I also tried to be very friendly and build good rapport with the techs during clinicals. I will say there were many, many times when I was physically exhausting and pushed to the edge emotionally. After the first year of the program, I started taking anti-depressants and seeing a therapist. I don't know anything about the Psychology field to compare. According to one of my upperclassmen who got hired after he graduated, starting pay was $21.00 an hour.   One positive thing about going to school in the Southeast is that many of the programs are relatively inexpensive. My program was about $6k vs. $30,000 in the state I live in now.  Is it possible for you to talk to a student of the program you're thinking of applying to? What city are you trying to go to school in?"

Radiology,2y225m,y_x_n,-1,Thu Mar 5 22:49:05 2015 UTC,"Not a doctor, but I've studied biomedical imaging. I think the bright spots are just the result of ischemic changes in that area, maybe due to something like atherosclerotic plaque or high blood pressure. In any sense, it's more of a physical ""hinderance"" if you will, that's creating the turbulent flow, and thus it'll show up in both TSE and FLAIR images, even though they are completely different and separate pulse sequences."

Radiology,2xyrc5,banana_tree_,3,Thu Mar 5 00:07:30 2015 UTC,I did clinical rotation at the VA. I really liked the techs there but that depends on the site. Its great benefits!!! If you stay there 20 years in retirement you will get 30% of your yearly income on top of SS. I think the pay might be lower. I know in outpt you have to do alot more exams. If I got to pick I would do inpt at a hospital. You do about 5 exams per shift but they are more complicated
Radiology,2xyrc5,ok_then23,2,Thu Mar 5 01:31:24 2015 UTC,"I currently work at an Outpatient VA clinic, and I've worked in a large hospital as well. Honestly it's 6 of one, half dozen of the other. The things that frustrate techs in hospitals are the same things that happen at the VA. If it's a brand new VA it'll have brand spanking new equipment. The big question is how do you get along with the others techs? In my experience this has been the biggest variable in finding a place to work. I've had jobs were the work was awful, but you have fun being around the people you work with. That being said, there is a lot of bureaucracy at the VA. lots of committees and meetings that everything has to go through which is annoying. If the pay/ benefits and the people fit you then go for it."
Radiology,2xyrc5,PureHaloBliss,2,Thu Mar 5 00:40:34 2015 UTC,"I did clinical rotations at a VA medical center. The X-ray equipment was brand new GE Definium systems. From my understanding, being federally funded has its perks in regards to the equipment they can order. The VA techs in the area make some of the highest hourly wages after a 30% pay hike a few years back. If you can get a job there, go for it, but I've also heard being a civilian can be exponentially harder to get a job than if you're already a gov't employee or a veteran. Background checks and whatnot."
Radiology,2xyrc5,INGWR,1 point,Thu Mar 5 12:44:45 2015 UTC,"As mentioned by others, newly opened facilities will tend to have brand new equipment or at least equipment with relatively modern standards. Many speak highly of the VA and even go as far as to describe it as the ideal employer. While I agree with many of those sentiments, you have to also understand that when it comes to actual working environment, techs will be techs.  The following is from my own experience working for the Department of Veterans Affairs in an outpatient clinic setting. Sure, the benefits are nice, working on salary is everything you hope it will be, and as our in house radiologist put it just this past Monday: ""there are no emergencies or stats at an outpatient clinic."" Nothing beats leaving at 4:30pm and knowing you won't be getting a call from work, or will be working evening, nights, or even weekends (in most outpatient VAs). However, as I've spent a number of years in this field, I've gotten to work in both hospital and outpatient settings. Whether or not you will enjoy your job has a lot to do with your colleagues and their work ethic/attitude. I've met techs from both ends of the spectrum: from those who put everything they've got into their work and take pride in their profession, to those who just can't be bothered. This is pretty unavoidable, and something you will deal with sooner or later in your profession. In summary, all the benefits you see on paper are as good as advertised, but you are still subject to the work environment issues you would find anywhere else. I now prefer the outpatient setting, but can honestly say I do miss the trauma some days. Few things are as exciting in radiology as running CT in a trauma center (IMO).  Lastly, the current equipment at my facility:   VA Outpatient Clinic (in operation for 7+ years) CT 16 slice CR Room, but some nearby VA facilities have full DR. 3 Tesla MRI (acquired through an agreement with local state University)."
Radiology,2xyrc5,shadowa4,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:59:53 2015 UTC,"I've worked in the VA system for the last 5+ years doing CT.  We make more than the level 1 University hospital next door.  We also have way better benefits.  We have the same scanners that other hospitals have (128 slice CT, 3T MRI, etc.).  Of course this will vary from place to place.

Radiology,2xyrc5,shadowa4,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:12:43 2015 UTC,"I did x ray clinicals at a VA, got my CT exams while still in school, and then worked for my first four years out of school as a CT tech at one.  It's..... I don't know.  The bureaucracy and the apathy are hard to work with.  The patients are a deserving crowd, I wanted to do good work for them, but they were a hard crowd to work with, too.  It takes a certain type of person to work at a VA long term, either you can or you can't, and don't feel bad if you can't.  Equipment wise, if it's a new build, expect it to have the latest and greatest."

Radiology,2xwt74,cherryfristado,6,Thu Mar 5 01:47:45 2015 UTC,"I work as a general Radiographer, two years exp. in a hospital.  getting $27.00 an hour flat rat for PRN.  Usually get 35-40 hours a week, sometimes with overtime.  I grossed 38k last year, but I was working even less.  I seriously doubt any rad tech willl make above 80k, depending on where you live though... Not many jobs, not many raises."
Radiology,2xwt74,limitless21,3,Thu Mar 5 02:02:18 2015 UTC,"Here in the metro DC area I work full time as an x-ray tech in a private office, started five years ago at $23. I went through a hospital based program that has since closed. To sit for your boards now you have to have some sort of college degree  I was able to cross train in DEXA which gave me a small pay raise (not board certified though) but other than that there is no opportunities to cross train anywhere else unless I do it completely on my own time, off the clock.   However, to be a sono tech, its a different school program from doing x-ray. But, typically you can do an RT program and then another year in school for sono.  As for jobs, most places here that hire are hospitals. They hire he students who have been there in their clinical rotation,  and only part time.   You could also consider being a travel tech, they make more."
Radiology,2xwt74,cherryfristado,2,Thu Mar 5 02:04:39 2015 UTC,"Hospitals and other facilities cannot allow someone to come in a cross-train on their own time unless they are registered with a school or employed by the facility- the liability is too high, so good luck with self-starting."
Radiology,2xwt74,Lodi0831,1 point,Wed Mar 4 18:06:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should've been more clear! I meant where I work has repeatedly told me they won't cross train me on their dime, because they don't feel there's need for it, but if I take classes myself, I can come in before my shift to learn how to do CT. (I've no interest in MRI or mammo) I just don't have the time right now.   My point was that in this area it seems that's the trend, only PRN positions open with not much chance of employer paid on the job cross training."
Radiology,2xwt74,angelwild327,1 point,Wed Mar 4 19:54:39 2015 UTC,I would like to stay close to my family in the NYC area.There are tons of hospitals here.  I hear stories of people in metro areas getting paid significantly more then in rural areas. IN NY you have to have an AART and a NY state cert to practice. I was hoping I could branch out into Sono and Cardio and hopefully work my way to a rad therapy job.
Radiology,2xwt74,angelwild327,4,Wed Mar 4 17:55:50 2015 UTC,"Sono isn't something you branch in to. It takes years of scanning to get to a point where you're comfortable. I know people cross train from rad tech to ultrasound, but those are few and far between. Most places now want someone who went to sono school...not on the job training."
Radiology,2xwt74,angelwild327,2,Wed Mar 4 17:59:58 2015 UTC,"I went to school in NYS, graduated, ugh.. 20 years ago.  Your side of the state definitely pays far better.  ALL Rad techs must certify through the ARRT after graduating, as well as every other state in the country.  So that is your bottom line and yes, I believe every state requires a state license, which isn't hard to get, in most cases.  In NYC, DC area and Cali the pay is above average, compared to the rest of the US.  Ultrasound is it's own special schooling as well as Nuclear Medicine, both of which pay more than any of the Rad modalities.  After Xray school, you can branch off to any of the following, CT, MRI, Mammo, Bone Denistometry and Interventional Radiology.  Each has its own specific Board exam, not every place will require board certification in those modalities, but it's always better to have it, than not.    Very few if any schools have part time or night classes.  So prepare to make a complete change if you go to Imaging school.  My suggestion, if you think it's really what you want, is to take a completely proactive approach.  FIRST and foremost, if you're not already involved in health care, Shadow a technologist or student.  It can be a grisley line of work, and not everyone is able to cope.  Second, try as hard as you can to get any job in a hospital that you can, secretary, transporter, ER Tech, CNA, Sitter, phlebotomist,   WHATEVER you're qualified to do...many jobs will train you on the job, others will require a simple certification.    The reason for this, is, to get your foot in the door at a hospital, so when you finish xray school, you'll have a greater likelihood of being hired.    Everyone has caught on to the fact that health care jobs are stable and necessary, so it's become far more difficult to break into the field than it once was.    Good luck!  By the way, I cross trained my way into CT, about 15 years ago, took the boards, and now live in DC, I make 6 figures, and thankfully, that's just with one job the cost of living is much greater here than in most states.  Most techs I know work 2 jobs, I did that for many years as well."
Radiology,2xwt74,Kaiawa,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:32:52 2015 UTC,Instead of going in for Xray I was thinking of going in for Ultrasound! There are 2 year Ultrasound programs and I think that it would be easier to cross train for CT. My dream would be  Either Sonogram with Cardio certs   CT  Radiation Therapy(only if the hospital that is training me has a position open)  or alternative   PAACS
Radiology,2xwt74,Minerva89,1 point,Thu Mar 5 01:14:22 2015 UTC,"Pardon me, if I'm misunderstood your statement; but Xray and Ultrasound are completely separate modalities and there is no cross training.  You either go to school for Ultrasound OR Xray.  CT falls under the blanket of Xray school, you cross train after you finish.    As far as I know the only other modality of Ultrasound is Echocardiography.  Sono is its own entity, even though it falls under the domain Imaging/radiology department.  Rad Therapy is also it's very own education.  PACS is part of the IT world."
Radiology,2xwt74,Minerva89,1 point,Wed Mar 4 18:09:59 2015 UTC,Yeah but PACS seems to be for people that have at least 2-5 years of imaging experience.   You would most likely be a CT tech and then get some cisco+pacs certs and be good to go!
Radiology,2xwt74,sutherbb36,1 point,Wed Mar 4 21:35:53 2015 UTC,"There are PACS people with ZERO imaging experience at all.  There are IT certifications for PACS professionals, which in no way require any imaging background. You can be a CT tech and have almost no idea how PACS works.  They are completely different fields."
Radiology,2xwt74,Minerva89,2,Wed Mar 4 21:48:59 2015 UTC,"Ditto. We had 20 students train at our hospital. 2 were hired.  Unless you want to travel far from where you trained, these seem to be the odds."
Radiology,2xwt74,Minerva89,3,Thu Mar 5 16:45:53 2015 UTC,"Job market saturation is a huge problem all over North America, it seems. In the States, pay is pretty low except for certain places. I hear Cali and Texas aren't bad.  Up north, pay isn't bad, but there are almost never any positions open at hospitals. I know people who have relocated far away just to get a job. Used to be the plains had jobs, but that boom is slowing down now.  If you have an IT background, have you ever considered working for health care systems IT? Demand is pretty high and pays well."
Radiology,2xwt74,Minerva89,1 point,Thu Mar 5 23:26:06 2015 UTC,"The problem with IT is that there really isnt much room to advance.  For example lets say you want to be a database admin or a systems manager these are positions that generally pay 80k+ here in NY. You would have to get around 4-5 certificates just to QUALIFY for a database admin. Then comes the experience. Its VERY difficult to get DB admin experience since no company will ever trust you with their sensitive information. You could have certificates up the butt but if you dont have any project experience they dont care. Most people in IT are certified but they are stuck because their job will not  let them advance or handle tougher work. They end up making around 60k a year after 5-9 years on the job. Once you get hired you will never get a raise from within the company. You have to hop around from job to job every few years and you could loose it all with one bad ""hop"".  Yet it seems like if your doing rad tech and you get an MRI or Sonogram license your almost guaranteed to those positions at least once in a while. The IT certs are also extremely difficult to get. An entry level Cisco Tech which just says you are qualified to work with computer systems beyond a basic home pc is a 2 part exam. The first part has a 770 page review book.  The only people that thrive in IT are people that get lucky/well connected or those that have an MASSIVE passion for computers. I am talking about guys that sit in front of a PC all day and then go home and troubleshoot simulations and test PCs at home.  High end IT jobs are salaried and stuff goes wrong all the time. You can easily end up working 50 hours a week or going into fix broken systems on weekends.  Thats why I am frustrated with this job. IT is a LOT like Rad Tech in terms of hours worked and the amount of information needed to be a success.  If I am going to work in a field like that might as well get to work on my feet and see other human beings, and know that I am helping out in some way."
Radiology,2xwt74,Lodi0831,3,Fri Mar 6 00:51:37 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, though one of my biggest frustrations is that there is little to no room to advance as a rad tech either, if CT or MR doesn't interest you. Management and sales are the two that people quote as places for you to advance, but the latter isn't an advancement and more so a change in career. The former depends on how much you want to manage.  I could see myself changing policy, but fuck the politics.   Also, I've never met more toxic people in my work history except for a few nurses than some of the techs I've worked with."
Radiology,2xwt74,sutherbb36,1 point,Fri Mar 6 02:08:08 2015 UTC,What about sonogram? Is that doing good?
Radiology,2xwt74,Lodi0831,3,Wed Mar 4 15:56:15 2015 UTC,Check the area you want to work and look at the job market. Ultrasound is growing and there are more and more applications popping up.   If you're in an area where there are 2-3 schools putting out 15-20 students every 2 years then you are most likely in a very saturated area and jobs will be hard to come by.
Radiology,2xwt74,sutherbb36,2,Wed Mar 4 22:34:27 2015 UTC,"I honestly have no clue. They look like they enjoy their time where I work, but I've seen bitter US techs as well. A large part of it depends on the work place and how well it's run/led/managed."
Radiology,2xwt74,Lodi0831,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:09:06 2015 UTC,Since I have an IT degree would it be possible for me to move up more to a managerial role or something as time goes on?  My ultimate goal was to become a Radiation Tech but that job is way overstaffed.
Radiology,2xwt74,Lodi0831,2,Wed Mar 4 16:22:14 2015 UTC,"Management are made of techs that were in the field and then did a few management courses/programs. I'm not sure the IT degree would be relevant per se, but I would argue that it brings an interesting perspective.  I know a charge tech who is also a PACS administrator, that could be where your IT experience comes in handy."
Radiology,2xwt74,Lodi0831,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:28:04 2015 UTC,Wow how does one become a PACS guy? Sounds like you need both IT and imaging certs?
Radiology,2xwt74,Lodi0831,2,Wed Mar 4 17:06:21 2015 UTC,"PACs certification and courses I think. I'm pretty sure a few charge techs I know have gone through those. I think IT experience helps, but likely you'll still have to take the courses unless you've worked specifically on PACS before."
Radiology,2xwt74,so_super,2,Wed Mar 4 23:41:51 2015 UTC,"Sonographer here...it's ok. Depends where you are, but most people have no idea how hard it is on your body. I'm only 3 years in, and have already had surgery. Other girls in my dept have had multiple surgeries. Lots of my clinic instructors too.   The money is ok, but everyone wants an experienced tech. So for your first 5 years, I'd say you'd be lucky to get $25 an hour. I'm also in the south, so that makes a difference. We also have lots of fat people in the south, which makes your scans 5 times harder."
Radiology,2xwt74,so_super,2,Wed Mar 4 17:32:28 2015 UTC,$35 an hour / prn here in the the Midwest for first year graduates  I would never do ultrasound for $25 an hour. But that's just the market difference in different areas.
Radiology,2xwt74,SuzySalamander,2,Wed Mar 4 17:46:23 2015 UTC,PRN normally gets more an hour anyway. But yeah the south is the worst. Pacific Northwest is where the money is at.

Radiology,2xwt74,Radiate_your_balls,2,Wed Mar 4 18:11:49 2015 UTC,I'm looking to move to San Francisco. Wish I could find an opportunity like that where they pay expenses and signing bonuses. The place I work hasn't offered raises in 5 years. It's a hot mess. I make less than 50k per year and have 3 registries and 3 years experience.
Radiology,2xwt74,shadowa4,1 point,Wed Mar 4 21:31:06 2015 UTC,Hey I wanted to ask how the hours were and how hard is to transfer from sono to CT scan?  Since I already have a 4 year degree how long would I be in school?  I saw a program at methodist hospital of NY that is 2 years long. I think its 1 year of science classes and 1 year of clinical and then you sit for the certification and then your good to go. But I was wondering if I could go to CT scan right after I graduate sono school.
Radiology,2xwt74,limitless21,2,Wed Mar 4 23:43:32 2015 UTC,"They're two totally different things. I know absolutely nothing about CT. I can look at a CT and pick out things, but as far as the equipment and all, I wouldn't be able to do it. You can cross train for CT/MRI if you have Xray training, but sono is totally different. I went to sono school for 2 years. It was rigorous. I did two years of clinic while also doing 2 years of book work. No one is going to hire a sono who cross trained. Every job I see says ""graduate from accredited sono school only"" meaning that OTJ training isn't enough. Not sure about the school you're looking at, but it MUST BE accredited or no one is even going to consider you for a job.   If I wanted to do CT, I would have to go to Xray school then cross over to CT. Just because they're in radiology, doesn't mean they're anything alike. Sono is a highly specialized field.  If I were you, I'd just do Xray and then cross over to CT."
Radiology,2xwt74,Lodi0831,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:59:21 2015 UTC,But everybody is telling me there are NO Xray jobs. All the CT programs I see are cross training and are 1 year long. X ray is what I wanted to do but the chance of me getting a job is slim to none.
Radiology,2xwt74,limitless21,2,Thu Mar 5 00:21:58 2015 UTC,"If you're wanting Xray and CT, then you will be disappointed when doing sono. They're not alike at all. Sono is very user dependent and you really have to know anatomy, physiology, and physics. Not to discourage you, I just don't want you having unrealistic expectations.   If I were you, I'd contact a hospital and try to job shadow someone in each field and see which you like. Hell you may end up loving sono and Xray will be an after thought. Or you may hate it and be happy you didn't waste time or money.   I wonder if once you get Xray license, if you can cross train in CT without actually working. On the job training without having the job part? Also, when you're in school, treat it as a very long interview. Impress your instructors. Ask questions. Be proactive. Then they may want to hire you after you graduate and then you can move on to CT."
Radiology,2xwt74,Lodi0831,1 point,Thu Mar 5 00:38:03 2015 UTC,"If you go the sonography route for schooling you would not be able to transfer to CT.  CT comes from a radiography background.  I would pick one or the other in this case.    FWIW I am a CT tech and I do not recommend the (radiography or sonography) program to friends interested in a career change.  As others have told you, there is no room for advancement unless you want to be in management.  Also since you were asking, I make $55k on a weekend program with 10yrs experience.  If I worked full time at my base rate I'd make about $58k.  Not worth the stress."
Radiology,2xwt74,limitless21,1 point,Thu Mar 5 00:40:59 2015 UTC,Are you located in a major metro area?  Salary.com has high rates here but I seem to be finding more full time sono positions then CT positions which seem to be Per Diem or night shift from 12am to 8am
Radiology,2xwt74,Lodi0831,1 point,Thu Mar 5 16:42:44 2015 UTC,"No, I am in a small city on the east coast about 1.5 hours from NYC.  The shift is a very good point.  Jobs for day shift in my experience almost always go to people already in the department currently on another shift.  I cannot tell you the last time I have seen a day shift job advertised, except at outpatient centers that pay less.  In CT once your foot is in the door it is easier to move to full time and eventually day shift if that's what you want."
Radiology,2xwt74,FlirtyDolphin,3,Thu Mar 5 19:26:52 2015 UTC,"I've been a Rad Tech for 2 years now and work in a hospital. I went through a 2 year program and passed the registry and it took 9 months to find a job, which happened to be at one of my clinic sites. I do fluoro exams, surgery, inpatients, outpatients, ER patients, you name it, I radiate it. But there are very few jobs around here because once people get in, they never leave. The pay varies state by state but being certified in other areas will increase your pay. I don't know about everyone else but for me it's a very demanding job with long hours and little respect. But that could just be my attitude after working seven 10 hour days in a row. Haha."

Radiology,2xwt74,MastadonInfantry,2,Thu Mar 5 18:41:20 2015 UTC,"I have a 4 year degree in Radiologic Technology, have been a CT technologist for 3.5 years (which tend to make more than x-ray techs) in a large hospital, and am registered in CT, and I do not make 55k. Obviously how much you make is relative to where you work as well. I know tech in California get paid very well, but you have to factor in cost of living there as well."
Radiology,2xwt74,derwreck,1 point,Thu Mar 5 18:47:18 2015 UTC,Do you make more or less? Also where are you located as the rates vary widely on the location and the amount of certifications you get.
Radiology,2xwt74,MastadonInfantry,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:08:18 2015 UTC,probably less.  I'm an xray tech with 7 years exp. and I make about 47k a year at the VA (clinic).  It's about average.

It's a slap in the face, really. Got one foot out the door already."
Radiology,2xwt74,jeenyus148,2,Wed Mar 4 23:37:16 2015 UTC,"It all depends on where you work and what type of facility you're at. I live in rural PA which is very over saturated with techs but the wages are not bad typically around $45-50k full time starting salary around here, and not impossible to find a job. This is probably different for your area in NYC so you might make more up in the city. Most techs from where I went get jobs through where they did their clinicals and go from there. I say try to talk to some techs around that area if you can or go to one of the rad tech programs around you and talk to them about it, they would have a better idea of what your area is like."
Radiology,2xwt74,digitaldoctor,2,Fri Mar 6 01:07:47 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong, but it seems like the best modalities for getting a job are ultra sound and CT.   You can go straight into ultrasound school but for CT (most places) require you to complete an x ray program.   I always say go for whatever modality you like best (mine is MRI), but if other circumstances such as time and money don't allow it go for US or CT. Not saying the later can't be a first choice.   Generally all modalities make around the same except x ray which makes less. Starting x ray in my hospital is like 26/hour I think. All other modalities start at like 35/hour. My hospital is in vegas for reference.   For mri I went through a x ray cert at a 4 year university and went another 2 years for a B.S. In comprehensive medical imaging. 6 years total... Lucked out at my clinical site and was able to get hired in x ray and the stars aligned now I'm an mri tech."

Radiology,2xwt74,ok_then23,2,Wed Mar 4 18:14:45 2015 UTC,Depends on the school.   What I'm saying is most places you have to complete an X-ray program (either BS or associates) before you can move onto CT/MRI    My particular path was 4 years of prerequisites and x ray program to earn a certificate. And another 2 years of school to earn a BS in comprehensive medical imaging.
Radiology,2xwt74,limitless21,1 point,Thu Mar 5 01:25:39 2015 UTC,"as far as CT or MRI, there is a great deal of favoritism in who is chosen to cross-train. If you are close to 40, you are probably not gonna get picked."
Radiology,2xwt74,ok_then23,2,Thu Mar 5 17:02:51 2015 UTC,"no, most techs have an associates degree. It is a complete waste of time to get a BS in rad. Also, remember, you will not be eligible for any finaid- you are going to pay out of pocket or take out stafford loans. Good luck paying them back- I have been deferred for two years lol- I aint never paying that shit back. Edit: Rich boyfriend- I apply for RT jobs, interview, never get hired. One place wanted me to be per diem it is 160 miles away lol,"
Radiology,2xwt74,ok_then23,2,Thu Mar 5 17:53:08 2015 UTC,"Some places only offer a BS. And ARRT is going to start, if it hasn't already, requiring a degree (associates is ok but not certificate) to be board eligible.   I wouldn't say it's a complete waste of time either because having a BS vs an associates gives you more opportunities if you want to change careers or continue your education (masters, PA school Ect.)"
Radiology,2xwt74,ok_then23,1 point,Fri Mar 6 09:44:42 2015 UTC,"Im pretty bitter, so there's that. I have a bachelor's degree it doesnt seem to do me much good but im older so there's that, too. In regard to OP, she/he indicates having a degree, so all school will be financed by her- no finaid only loans- in light of her question, i think the risk is too high."
Radiology,2xwt74,ok_then23,2,Wed Mar 4 18:27:37 2015 UTC,"It is true the market is saturated for rad techs. There are NO full time jobs available in hospitals around my area (Bay Area). It's all PRN. However, pay is excellent here, and if you're willing to work your ass off you can make it. I worked three x-ray jobs for a year and a half until I got extremely lucky and landed an awesome full time job. I know techs that have way more experience than me, and they are still working PRN and crazy shifts at the hospital. I am ARRT certified, and CA certified, which is what is required to work in CA. No other certs, and I'm not sure if I will because the only CT program is far far away from me.  Sonography is an extra 18 month program here, and all the US techs I know love their jobs. The pay is better too. I was told when I was a student that US techs get a $200 bonus for each patient they scan when they come in on call. Don't know how true that is. What made me nervous about US and drove me away from it (aside from it not interesting me very much) was that you're putting your whole career in your wrist. There are more US jobs around here though.  If you're a female getting your mammo cert makes you more valuable and a chance for extra pay. It's only a one semester class.  Also, factor in the wait time to get into a radiology program. I waited 4 years to get into my program, and the wait is only getting longer. And then it's a two year program, and then about 2 to 3 months to get all your certifications and testing done.  Hope this helps! I love my job, but it is a very difficult field to break into."
Radiology,2xwt74,limitless21,2,Wed Mar 4 21:07:22 2015 UTC,"Newly minted CT tech in Southern CA here. The job market is extremely flooded. During the recession, the government ga e everyone the idea that hospital jobs would grow very fast. Unfortunately, everyone had the same idea and moved into healthcare as they lost their jobs.   Programs in the area have 4-5 yr wait lists with very little chance for a job (our hospital hired 2 out of the 30 students that graduated last year from the nearby school)."

Radiology,2xr3ms,Nheea,4,Tue Mar 3 22:15:59 2015 UTC,"I'm just a first-year med student, but would this x-ray raise the concern of child abuse? Any estimates on the age of the patient?"
Radiology,2xr3ms,zakee00,8,Tue Mar 3 08:32:18 2015 UTC,"The patient was 3 years and a few months old. It's a good thought, particularly for your level of training, but this looks more like a toddler's fracture to me.   The classic fractures people talk about in child abuse (now euphemized in the medical literature as ""non-accidental trauma"") are metaphyseal corner fractures, posterior rib fractures, skull fractures, scapular fractures, and sternal fractures."
Radiology,2xr3ms,boesse,4,Tue Mar 3 08:49:16 2015 UTC,"Question from a paleontologist: I read on there about metaphyseal corner fractures, and that those are likely to arise from shaking (I'm assuming from limb 'flailing"" during shaking). However, I couldn't find anything more specific (cursory look, admittedly) about posterior rib & scapular fractures, and non-parietal skull fractures (sternal fractures seem intuitive enough, since I'm assuming the chest would be the easiest place to hold when shaking a baby). Anyway, any idea why these other fractures are typical of child abuse?"
Radiology,2xr3ms,boesse,8,Tue Mar 3 11:42:02 2015 UTC,"The posterior rib fractures occur then the baby is held about the rib cage and shaken. The fingers of the abuser act as a fulcrum for the ribs to fracture with the repetitive movement. The posterior rib fractures and metaphyseal corner fractures are fairly specific for child abuse, too.  The other fractures aren't as much of a slam dunk. The scapula is pretty tough to fracture, though, and so often a kid just falling down or tripping usually isn't enough to cause a fracture. More likely, it's from a direct blow from an abuser. I'm honestly not sure why they talk specifically about non-parietal skull fractures, but it's just another thing we look at. These types of injuries are less specific, and don't make abuse your immediate top differential, but they're usually enough to warrant a bone survey to look for more injuries.   None of these findings alone are enough to definitively diagnoses abuse; you have to look at the whole presentation and put it together. With the right clinical picture, though, it becomes pretty clearly the result of child abuse.   (As an aside, the ""right clinical picture"" includes things like findings out of proportion to history, a history involving the kid doing things they can't do at that age like falling from walking before we'd expect them to walk, multiple injuries displaced in time in different stages of healing, etc.)  edit: And to be clear, my initial case was not a suspected child abuse case."
Radiology,2xr3ms,zakee00,1 point,Tue Mar 3 11:57:48 2015 UTC,Very cool! Thanks for the info - so the posterior rib fractures are effectively the same reason why the sternum fractures.
Radiology,2xr3ms,jotjen,1 point,Tue Mar 3 12:05:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your reply! It just looked like a nasty fracture for how young the bones appeared (I couldn't have guessed the age, but they looked very young to me.) Couldn't think of a mechanism that would have caused it."
Radiology,2xr3ms,Metamba,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:17:57 2015 UTC,"A toddler's fracture is typically a nondisplaced spiral fracture.  There are other less common toddler's fractures, probably the cuboid being the second most common, but not many people talk about those.  This would be more like a ""boot top"" fracture, though that is typically older kids.  The mechanism may be the same though. Also, skull fractures are usually not considered worrisome for abuse unless multiple or stellate, and even then are less specific. A simple linear skull fracture is super common and not concerning for NAT. I do a lot of NAT..."

From memory the common excuse is that for a standard CXR then a PA film is entirely adequate, and that adding a lateral takes more time and exposes people to more radiation without giving a benefit. They can be requested if it's felt necessary but again, I've not heard of any of my patients getting one over here."

Radiology,2xj69m,ultrasonic76,10,Sun Mar 1 04:32:39 2015 UTC,"Liver abscesses. Look bacterial rather than amoebic as they are irregular, septated and multiple.

Radiology,2xj69m,hypermodernism,2,Sun Mar 1 12:22:33 2015 UTC,Biliary obstruction is not really that common a cause of liver abscess; more likely secondary to some other abdominal infection with portal venous drainage. In a 58yo i would most suspect diverticulitis.

Radiology,2xi9cl,doc_k,5,Sat Feb 28 23:10:53 2015 UTC,"As a PGY4 currently applying for VIR fellowship, let me tell you that there's no way it's going to go away. Yes VIR has lost PAD and aortic cases to vascular in many big centers; however, there are plenty of other procedures that VIR can do. All ablations, chemoembos, trauma embolizations, TIPS/DIPS/BRTO. This is beyond the bread and butter of VIR of paras/thoras, drain placements, lines, ports, PEG tubes and biliary procedures. In major academic centers, body IR does the CT or US guided biopsies but in private practice, VIR can be required to do them as well.  The field of IR is evolving. It is becoming more clinical-based and requires you to get out there and interface with referring providers. A good reason why VIR has lost PAD work is because some IR doctors weren't aggressive or didn't care enough to maintain the territory. If a vascular surgeon says, ""yes I'll try this complex procedure"" while an IR guy says, ""I can't be bothered"" of course, they'll go with the vascular surgeon. That being said, a vascular surgeon has an advantage because if a case goes wrong, they have the know-how to convert to an open case.  Also FYI, VIR is separating itself as a residency from DR so by the time you apply for residency, you may be going straight into a VIR residency i.e. same 6-year timeline with less DR and more IR.  tl;dr: no IR isn't going anywhere. It is evolving and it separating itself from DR may be bad but it's not going away."

I don't have an answer, but I can contribute to the discussion.  I understand that IR is opening up direct pathways in the US this year, meaning that people can become interventionalists without the diagnostic training.  After that (as far as I understand), they will be able to take fellowships in DR oriented programs as well as their IR programs.  Because of that, I feel IR is going to expand, as more people who like OR related medicine can go directly into it without the ""boring"" film reading stuff.  My concern is that all these IR cowboys are going to over saturate the field, take away my IR fellowship spots and well as my DR fellowship spots, and cause problems.  That being said, IR always seems to have a place in the hospital setting.  I have seen surgeons turn down many tricky cases (like paraspinal abscess drainage, etc) because without the precision of CT guided drainage, it would be too risky.  The vascular surgeons I know, although competent, prefer the open cases over threading catheters and other ""boring"" stuff.  In the end, our competitors are people too, and it seems that the things that make radiologists excited are not so sought after by other faculties.

Radiology,2xbbl1,cillacone,2,Fri Feb 27 03:40:24 2015 UTC,So you've already got some great advice but I figure I'll throw in a little tidbit I used when I was a student.   Especially in terms of trauma i used to frog the unaffected leg to see/palpate the crease and use that as a base on the other side. Helped a lot with more difficult patients.
Radiology,2xbbl1,CartoonPhysics,2,Fri Feb 27 14:17:12 2015 UTC,"Cheat tricks for positioning:   palpate the ASIS and move the top of the light field to that level center the longitudinal axis of the cross hairs so it runs through the middle of the thigh (so that the femur is essentially in the middle)   It always helps to have a look at what a standard diagnostic image typically looks like and go from there. Take a look at this image. You can see the top of the image starts around ASIS and the femur is pretty much in the middle of the image. Sometimes ""finding the femoral neck"" won't be the easiest thing, especially on a large patient. I find it's better to strategize positioning in terms of ""well what does a standard diagnostic image look like"" and look for things like where it starts and ends, what's usually around the middle, etc."

Radiology,2xbbl1,Mctasha,1 point,Sat Feb 28 02:29:47 2015 UTC,"After your AP shot you should have a general idea. Have the pt bend up the knee of the affected leg, then drop it down to the side, rotating the hip a little towards it if it helps/is possible. Center the ray right in the mid leg and make sure the upper border of your collimation is high enough to get everything.  There's really not a lot to it.. honestly just keep practicing, that's what being a student in clinicals is for. If your having any kind of trouble with any shots then grab as many of them as possible to get the practice. Tell the tech(s) you're with you are having trouble with this shot and ask them to watch your positioning before you shoot and help correct you if it's off at all. The best question you should be asking throughout your clinicals: What could I have done to get that shot better?  Seriously ask it all the time and take advice from everyone. Every tech has his/her own tricks and ways of doing things and you should ALWAYS be open to seeing how someone else does something and seeing if you can incorporate a new trick into your methods. That should go for when you are a working technologist as well. You'll be fine if you keep practicing and always keep learning and trying to improve.  EDIT: Just throwing in two other huge tips for clinicals and when you are working:    Always visualize the anatomy and  Take your time.   Think about where the bones should lie based on your education and knowledge of the human body. Take your time. Don't rush a shot. Look at it again. Remember your training. Are you centered where the book says you should be.. if not, why? Do you expect this shot will display all of the anatomy you expect to see? Are you sure? Take a couple seconds and look again, line it up, be confident. Talk to your patient and put them at ease with small talk while you are ensuring you get the perfect shot. Putting them at ease will help clear your mind a bit and put you at ease, too :)"

Radiology,2x5t0d,qwerty_face,4,Wed Feb 25 22:00:56 2015 UTC,"Best things:   The satisfaction when you get a difficult patient/anatomy/position to image and you get it perfect first time. Example, getting a perfectly open mortise oblique on a casted ankle, or a nice lateral knee on the table. Meeting patients, you get to talk to a ton of people and even though I was never particularly extroverted, doing this job has made me so and now I really enjoy communicating with patients and meeting new people. Well-paid, recession-proof career which allows you to use your hands and head but doesn't ruin your body. Not much manual work, not that much computer work, lots of interpersonal work, a good balance of everything.   Worst parts:   Gets really repetitive some days (eg. ortho doc has 100 shoulder patients scheduled on one day) Some people will tell you the workplace politics or rude patients are the worst bit, I tend to just zone it out but I can see why it's hard at times. Any workplace can be tough unless you're somewhat thick-skinned. As a student, being placed in an area you aren't really familiar with and with techs who aren't receptive of students is really difficult - you want to take initiative and join in, but you don't know what to do and they're unwilling to teach you. My first two days in CT ever were like this and it was shitty because I just felt like I was getting in the way and the technologists had a real ""it's not my job to teach"" attitude around students (newsflash: If you work in a teaching hospital, it is your job to teach.) After those days I was with different techs who were very receptive and showed me the ropes, which makes everything WAY better. Also as a student you have to pay tuition for the privilege of unpaid work for 40 hours a week at times, haha. Job market apparently sucks in the States, not an issue if you are willing to travel for work or are outside of the US. As with many professions, the workforce is dominated by one sex (females). We hear a lot more about the problems of male-dominated workplaces in the news. Female-dominated workplaces exist and have their pros and cons as well! Just make sure you're easy to get along with and you'll be fine.   I know I listed a lot more cons than pros haha but really I'm enjoying this profession a lot as a student and many of the negatives go away when you get into the workforce. The big downer is the job market if you're in the US."
Radiology,2x5t0d,TardisTechnologist,4,Thu Feb 26 01:19:30 2015 UTC,"Best? You can train for another 6 months- 1 year and get certified in another field which pays much more. I've been doing CT and I make double what I started in xray with.  Worst? Finding your first job, I had to take a shitty urgent care clinic at first - toughed it out for a few years until I got trained in CT. Lifting patients for xrays kinda sucks too, and doing BE's. I don't miss that."
Radiology,2x5t0d,fancy-ketchup,2,Thu Feb 26 02:24:51 2015 UTC,How in the world do you make double in CT?  I got a lateral transfer into MRI with no pay raise and probably $2/hr raise when I get pass registry.
Radiology,2x5t0d,BariumEnema,2,Thu Feb 26 06:32:51 2015 UTC,I guess its based on facility. Are you still working in xray and they just decided to cross train you? Its a shitty situation if so.
Radiology,2x5t0d,peedzllab,1 point,Thu Feb 26 06:48:24 2015 UTC,"I started at an urgent care center, worked there for a while, they only gave me a slight raise after more than a year - so I found another job. Got another job where I asked for more money and worked there and got a few more raises. Then I got into a CT program at a local level 1 trauma hospital and they were so desperate to find CT techs they hired me before I was even certified. Worked there for 2 years without any raises (it was pretty ghetto) I then took another job in a hospital in a nearby town that paid 2$/hr more as a baseline, have gotten 2 $2 raises in the year that I've worked there. Plus I work evenings so I get a 15% shift diff from that too.  TL;DR - worked a few random jobs for a year or two each, built experience and got a few raises so I could ask for more at a new opportunity"
Radiology,2x5t0d,fancy-ketchup,1 point,Thu Feb 26 07:27:11 2015 UTC,"I think this depends on your location and the average prevailing wages for techs.

Radiology,2x5t0d,derwreck,1 point,Thu Feb 26 05:53:23 2015 UTC,"This seems to be more common with X-Ray departments since they employ a lot more techs and you have to deal with several different personalities. I get sick of all the drama and gossip that goes on in the department, and it isn't just the females, males are guilty of this as well. When you work in a department that employs over 15 techs, you quickly learn which techs are lazy and which techs are willing to work their asses off when it's crunch time. We are a union hospital, which is both a good and bad thing, it makes it extremely difficult for management to get rid of people that are slacking but at the same time it helps increase our hourly wages. I've noticed that this drama is almost nonexistent when I'm working in CT, everyone pulls their own weight since there's usually only 2-3 techs on any given shift. I can't wait until I can get myself into a full time CT position so that I can leave X-Ray behind."
Radiology,2x5t0d,SirJadams,2,Thu Feb 26 08:02:40 2015 UTC,"I'm training to be a Therapeutic Radiographer. The best bit is definitely the amount of patient contact, you often see patients once a day for a few weeks, letting you build up a relationship that is hard to build up as a healthcare professional. You get some stories from some patients who are absolutely nuts, and you get to be there to support patients who are finding it hard to deal with their cancer. I find that we also have the means to sort out simple problems that the nurses on the wards don't have time to sort out, which can feel nice. As a Radiographer in the UK you are also quite involved in the management of the patient pathway too. Its quite a jack of all trades profession, in that there's a lot of roles that Therapeutic Radiographers fill.

Radiology,2x5t0d,1radgirl,2,Mon Apr 13 19:35:29 2015 UTC,"Best: I love the science and technology of what I do. I love my coworkers and working as a team in my department to do amazing things and care for people.  Worst: Being on-call and working holidays, weird hours, and weekends. This is not a 9-5, Monday-Friday type job. There's nothing like the feeling of getting called out of bed at 3 am during a blizzard because there's a multiple victim trauma in the ER and they need your help. And then having to turn around and work a 12 hour shift after that. And there's really nothing like being at work on Christmas morning instead of with your family.  But someone has to do it, and for me the good outweighs the bad. In spite of the crazy days when no one in our department gets lunch and we can't remember the last time anyone got a bathroom break, there's also the times when you hold a patient's hand through a tough procedure and can tell you really made a difference for them that day. It makes it all worth it."
Radiology,2x5t0d,cherryfristado,2,Thu Feb 26 00:24:28 2015 UTC,"Best: Chatting with friendly patients, helping to ""read"" images (we have a few docs that I can discuss my images with), feeling I like I've helped make a positive difference in someone's health, and when you get that perfect image even though your patient couldn't move and you practically had to build some contraption to make it work. Plus, 8 years later I'm still fascinated by looking inside the body.  Worst: Docs who don't respect you/talk down to you/treat you like you are their servant, nasty patients (I wasn't the one who told you to get this done or to come here. Don't be shitty to me when I'm doing my job in service to you), and accusatory, micromanaging bosses who lack good leadership skills. That last one is obviously not an across the board kinda thing, but it makes for a frustrating place to work.   For context, I work in an out patient/private imaging office, so I have the 9-5, free weekends/holidays kinda schedule. I refused to look for a hospital job when I graduated school."

Radiology,2x5t0d,derwreck,2,Thu Feb 26 04:55:20 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Nuclear Medicine or Interventional Radiology. You're more involved with the patient in these modalities and have a wider scope of practice as to what you can do. The only problem is that the job market is tough for these two fields, jobs are few and far between."
Radiology,2x5t0d,zzspectrez,1 point,Thu Feb 26 08:12:48 2015 UTC,There are jobs in IR and Cath lab. We just spent two years trying to fill two positions.   My experience has shown there is a lack of well trained ir/Cath techs. Which is not surprising if you think about the fact there is no real formal training that I have seen mostly on the job. Add to that it taking about a year or two before someone is really trained on all aspects. Even then a lot of people are not cut out for it and don't stay after training. Repeat cycle.

Radiology,2x5t0d,zzspectrez,1 point,Thu Feb 26 08:58:18 2015 UTC,My only issue with CT is the machines have got so fast and mostly automated that critical thinking skills you used to need are thing of the past. I guess you could say the same thing about general xray since the move to digital from film.  The speed issue is the killer for me. I have seen a lot of facilities start packing outpatient schedules so tight ( every ten minutes ) that it is a nightmare trying to fit emergency patients and Stat inpatients into the scanner. Seems a constant running way behind until the night shift. Recipe for mistakes to be made.  Now outpatient only CT would be nice. I don't mind busy if you take the emergency/inpatients  out of scenario
Radiology,2x5t0d,robeandslippers,1 point,Thu Feb 26 15:28:47 2015 UTC,"I work in a level one trauma center and you definitely still need critical thinking skills like once or twice a week.  I'm unaware of any modality that requires using your brain on every single scan/image.  At my hospital, we have the exact opposite issue.  The day shift is over staffed and the night shift understaffed - out of the 5 days a week I work, i'd say 1-2 are steady, 2 we're getting slammed, and 1 is dead."
Radiology,2x5t0d,zzspectrez,2,Fri Feb 27 05:09:00 2015 UTC,If I could do it again I would go to nursing school and get a bsrn. More flexibility to move around and up.  Xray has been very good to be. Within five years I moved up to Cath Lab and IR and I am making 4 times what I started making. But I have long hours and lots of call. Nowhere to go but down if I wanted a change.
Radiology,2x5t0d,derwreck,1 point,Thu Feb 26 05:12:40 2015 UTC,"Have you gotten burnt out doing Cath Lab and IR? I have a few friends that managed to score positions like yours and they're easily clearing over $100k/yr but I could just see myself getting sick of having to take call all the time and hardly getting any days off. While the money is good, they never have any time to spend any of it."
Radiology,2x5t0d,zzspectrez,1 point,Thu Feb 26 08:09:38 2015 UTC,The hours can be a drag for sure. This can be very dependent on your facility. We used to be run short staffed and I was honestly not sure how long I was going to stay.  We have been well staffed for the past two years. My problem is I am the lead for the department which really is more stress and hassle then worth it. It was not something I really wanted but no one else either wanted the position or if they did they were not qualified.  One thing different about any good lab is it seems many of the people who are skilled and knowledgeable are often strong personalities and driven. Add to that how small a close you work with each other and that can be a stressful dynamic at times.   Overall I have much more job satisfaction in the lab compared to working in other modalities. But at times the stress level and hours can weigh heavily.

Surgery will reduce your mobility at this point, and a chiropractic ""adjustment"" could be potentially harmful - though most decent chiropracters will understand this and prescribe you a reasonable physio regimine.  Please note that while strengthening your core won't fix the curvature, it will help the symptoms.  Strengthening and toning the muscles that support the spine will relieve pressure.  Additionally, they won't become fatigued as easily."

Radiology,2wxdir,sagarsash,1 point,Mon Feb 23 23:23:23 2015 UTC,"Please note that the ABR does not give you a license to do anything. They are a certifying organization. You can practice medicine without being certified or eligible for certification, though in practice, this is not really possible in any major population center as most hospitals/groups require a certificate. You can certainly work for yourself though. In rural areas, groups may not require it. Not having an ABR certificate and practicing medicine is not illegal in of itself.  The individual US states give you a license to practice medicine. If and IMG gets whatever this ABR certificate is and DOES NOT HAVE a US state license, he/she is practicing medicine illegally.   Most US states have a requirement of having done at least 2 years of a US residency. I think there may be a hold out state where you only need to do 1 year.  so, the statement ""So IMGs can get an unrestricted license to practice medicine (well, specifically radiology) WITHOUT a US residency."" is wrong.  tl;dr You don't have to finish radiology residency to practice medicine/radiology. And you don't have to be ABR certified to practice medicine/radiology."

Radiology,2ww2iu,DoughnutMeDown,5,Mon Feb 23 17:43:05 2015 UTC,"Do you have a CPD manager or anything like that?  Express an interest in CT to them or if you don't have one then your line manager will do.  There are short courses on the society site and some of them will be CT based and won't be too expensive.  Try and get your trust to fund them if you can!  Else if they're cheap enough you could consider funding it yourself I suppose... Synergy News also has a section with study days (unsure if it's the same as the actual Society site as it's usually a bit larger).    Most of the journal articles in Radiography aren't really relevent but every now and again there is something interesting which could be worth doing something CPD related on.  Does your department have a monthly audit meeting that you should be attending but never can?  Could you do an audit on something CT related?  CT Lead could have ideas.  If you are going for a job in CT at your current hospital then simply being in the CT department whenever you can will show your interest and your motivation will/should be noticed.  Our general radiographers do CT Heads out of hours and have to do CT refresher days every month or so.  While some of the radiographers do nothing but the heads they are required to do others really get stuck in and are quite capable at CT doing virtually every examination.  You can probably guess who got the trauma jobs when they came out!  Ask the CT Lead for advice on books as well, if they have them in the department then use them rather than paying through the teeth for your own copy.  If you're going for a job that isn't at your current hospital then you need to go and have a look round that hospital.  I know the management at my trust don't really give out interviews if you haven't had a look round."

Really good shout on asking my trust to fund me, will definitely have a word with my line manager this week! As /u/laissez_meh suggested, I'll probably try to attend a cannulation course if I can. Great if I get funding but £300 isn't a bad price for self-investment.   Unfortunately, the general staff here don't even get to touch CT heads. Guess I'm gonna have a word with the CT Lead about shadowing and book recommendations as well then!"
Radiology,2ww2iu,Philbo1985,2,Mon Feb 23 20:55:28 2015 UTC,"I'm hesitant on the cannulation course.  It's a good idea but while it's something you need for CT if you have it in General you won't have many chances to use it which might lead to you becoming deskilled in it?  Not saying the cannulation course is bad but you could probably go on two cross sectional courses for that money.  That said, the SOR do a cannulation course which is awesome, it's recognised through the majority of the UK for Radiographers but before you sign up check how often you have to be cannulating!  You might do it now and then have to do in-house training anyway!"

Coming from a similar position I can recommend some things.  As well as the brilliant advice from everyone else, if you want to get into CT in the future, make sure you make a good name for yourself.  If you ever find yourself in the CT department, be friendly and helpful towards the radiographers and show willingness to learn and be proactive.  Help with transfers and patient positioning. Learn their names and make sure they know yours.   People talk, and if you ever apply for a post, the CT superintendent will usually have a casual ask around the department to see if anyone knows anything about you. This will greatly help you stand out from the competition if we already know you are a safe pair of hands. If people really like you, they will often go out of their way to put a good word in for you.  Build a good CPD portfolio, brush up on cross sectional anatomy, IRMER, IRR, IV contrast administration and potential complications of this (contrast induced nephropathy, eGFR and Creatinine checks etc.).   If you really want to show off, research some emerging techniques such as GSI, dual source and dual energy CT.   Cannulation is a great skill to have, and very satisfying once you master it. Bear in mind that many trusts will still require you to do the in-house course even if you have a qualification from elsewhere, worth looking into where you are."

Radiology,2wtm0u,wind2do,7,Mon Feb 23 01:26:54 2015 UTC,"It's a long, hard, expensive road. Most people finish training in the US in their early to mid 30's with hundreds of thousands of dollars of student loan debt. You have to get excellent grades in high school and college, do well on the MCAT, and have something that distinguishes you to get accepted into medical school. Then in medical school you generally need to be in the top tier of your class and do well on the USMLE to land a radiology residency. Then you have to do a year of internship in something like general surgery or internal medicine. Then four years of radiology residency followed by a year (sometimes two) of radiology fellowship.  When you finally become a radiologist you will find that it is anything but a ""lazy job."" In the past it was considered a ""lifestyle"" specialty because of the relatively good hours and high pay compared with other specialties. But the arc has bent and will continue to bend the other way as reimbursements for imaging decrease and workloads increase. Radiologists work hard now.  You are young so you have plenty of time keep your options open. Getting excellent grades in high school and college will help you maintain those options (including radiology). Take as many honors/AP classes as you can. Major in something that interests you. Medical schools often value people who have majored in a non-technical field. You'll still have to complete the prerequisites for medical school. So you if major in literature you'll still have to take chemistry, physics, biology, etc. The requirements vary by school a bit.  Overall, just keep an open mind. Radiology is a very interesting field, but it isn't for everyone. Some people deplore sitting in a dark room alone staring at computers for hours on end.

Radiology,2wlvcm,CremasterReflex,0,Sat Feb 21 04:23:25 2015 UTC,"I know there is a lot of dislike for chiro around here, but I sought help as a frustrated patient who had been in constant discomfort for years, and no amount of anti-inflammatories was able to relieve that pain. This was not a decision I made lightly, and there was a lot of time that went into finding a reputable practice. Having had four sessions so far, my only regret is that I didn't do this sooner.   So far the chiropractor has done manual adjustments and used a few other techniques to relax my muscles (which had been permanently tensed up because of things being out of alignment). He uses different stretches, and something called Graston, which is kind of like a massage with a metal rolling pin. After my first session last week, my constant discomfort was gone. I had forgotten what it was like to not have throbbing/stabbing pain. With each session, my hip is a little less stiff, and I have has some pain-free days recently.   There was a noticiable difference in the alignment of my hips (the right one was much higer than the left), and after four sessions with the chiropractor,  there is a visible difference in that my hips are now more evenly aligned. He also identified that there is a difference in length between my legs (left is shorter), and has ordered a heel lift to help correct that. In order to get used to the heel lift, I have a temporary insert that is being gradually built up. This also helps to resolve the alignment problems with my hips.  Chiropractor looked at the x-ray, and has talked to me about issues that may arise in the future because of the anomalies, and has explained that there are some thing that are not fixable with chiropractic care. He has also been helpful in helping me establish fitness goals, and suggesting exercises/equipment to use to help me reach those goals in a way that won't cause a lot of discomfort.  All that being said, I reliaze that chiro is not a permanent fix, and look forward to my surgical consult. Since wait times are extremely long to meet with a specialist,  I'm glad I have my chiropractor to help me cope."

Those adjustments are placebo treatments that work best for people who have ""pain"" for ""unknown"" reasons (e.g. It's all in their head it or it is a self limiting soft tissue injury that would heal in its own in same amount of time anyway). Furthermore, some chiropractic neck adjustments cause stroke ( I have personally seen 10-15 of these in the last 6 years in people less than 40 yo).

Radiology,2wgsed,derwreck,11,Fri Feb 20 05:28:28 2015 UTC,"Not to be the debbie downer with my reply here or anything but honestly, and I mean really...honestly, every single tech I know in my department has taken a radiograph of themselves at one point or another in their career. Whether it be an injury they sustained on an extremity or a child they bring after hours to make sure they didn't break anything while taking a fall on the playground. I know it's frowned upon and I know HR would have a shit fit if they found out but sometimes things like these just boil down to plain old professional courtesy. Obviously, if we see something of concern, we'll go straight through the ER and go through the proper protocols. The majority of the rads in my department are pretty laid back and will even go over the image with you even though they're not getting paid for it, again, it's a professional courtesy. I would never do this with a CT scan or an MRI as the implications for this much are much worse if you were to get caught doing so. I spend a lot of time chatting with our PACS admin and going over PACS related software with her and I can't tell you how many times a radiologist has sent a family member to our affiliated outpatient center that's owned by the hospital to have an MRI done, mind you this is all under the radar so there's zero billing involved on their behalf. The PACS admin is clearly aware that this is happening since all these images go into an unspecified folder after the radiologist has looked over their family members images, so as to avoid any billing that could be incurred. I'm gonna put on my down vote umbrella here since our subreddit white nights will come here and negate what I'm saying but this honestly happens in 99% of the hospitals out there. To say otherwise is just utter and complete BS. Hell, our director came to our department after a minor injury and had us do a few x-rays on an extremity of her so that a rad could do a quick read and rule out any serious pathology. This is honestly no different than the techs on this subreddit that take x-rays of their cell phones, laptops, etc and post them on here for everyone to see. Are these radiographs medically necessary? No. If the hospital found out this was happening you know for certain it'd end up in a meeting with your director and a possible write-up due to using the facilities for non medically related purposes and a potential waste in resources."
Radiology,2wgsed,etrtr,3,Fri Feb 20 12:35:01 2015 UTC,"I hardly consider taking an image of a cell phone the same as an xray of your own hand. And the fact that people just shrug it off is kind of surprising to me. I've seen the sea shell  barium art and whatnot and I get it. Maybe it's just that it was drilled into my head too much in school, but there's a reason not just anybody can do our job. My radiologists would have me fired for something like this. And I'm sorry but if I was called into a meeting for it and said something like ""it's art"" or ""everybody does it at every hospital"" it doesn't make it right."
Radiology,2wgsed,derwreck,3,Fri Feb 20 13:18:51 2015 UTC,"I completely understand where you're coming from and I too had rules like this drilled into my head as a student but you also have to understand that this happens, regardless. I don't condone it, I don't do it but at the same time I'm not going to go off running to my director about it because that's just not the way I am. This definitely varies from one hospital to the next and is heavily dependent on how strict the radiologists are but where I work, the rads aren't going to have you fired for something that they do themselves (depending on the rad of course). Be it that you're taking x-rays of people or objects, the consequences are the same if HR catches wind of it since in their eyes, you're using their equipment and resources for things that don't benefit them on a financial standpoint."
Radiology,2wgsed,etrtr,2,Fri Feb 20 13:28:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that I completely agree. As far as HR making a stink about it absolutely. I would take an image of something if a machine had an exposure error and I wanted to test it for reproducibility. But there's no way I'd ask for another tech to image my or their hand. You can still say it happens all the time and every tech you know does it, that reasoning doesn't hold up in court."
Radiology,2wgsed,derwreck,3,Fri Feb 20 13:35:20 2015 UTC,"Which you're completely correct in that aspect, I'm not going to argue with that. I guess the only point I was trying to make is that within any radiology department, this is going to happen without fail. I personally do not see it as a big deal since it isn't my license on the line but things like these just happen in our field, it's happened since day one. Policies and procedures have obviously changed as the field has evolved in the past few decades but I know a lot of older techs have states that back when they were younger, the threat of being fired for something like that was basically nil. Maybe it has to do with the hospital potentially not making money on something like this or maybe even how strict policies and procedures have become in regards to radiation safety."
Radiology,2wgsed,etrtr,1 point,Fri Feb 20 13:43:46 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm sure that's what it all comes down to. The radiation is negligible, and it would obviously be a much bigger deal if I was shooting lateral Lumbars on all my friends and family.

Radiology,2whqgk,omgitsscrystal,3,Fri Feb 20 00:22:07 2015 UTC,"8-years; eastern PA  1: Like?  Faster,  and can be 1/2-1/4 the dose of film/CR.  Another like... Say you have a digital portable and have to go the the ICU for line placement. A radiologist can look at the image while the plate is still behind the patient's back (in a matter of seconds). If they need to reposition the line, it can be done right away, instead of running a plate to a CR reader, processed, then it's read, then you need another order if it needs to be repositioned, then you have to go back to the unit with the portable and another plate, and move the patient again. We've found a digital portable to be a huge plus. Sometimes it comes in handy when an Orthopod wants to get some pics while he/she's reducing a FX in the ER.  Dislike?  If you're 1/2 an inch off doing a CXR with CR... you can still shoot and get a beautiful exam. With DR... if it's not locked into position -perfectly-, it might not let you expose (they can be overly finicky about alignment, which frustrates a lot of techs), and while you fix the tube, you've lost the ten second window that your drunk patient was willing to be still/non-combative for.  2: no more film here; all CR/DR  3: Patient care?  Image quality is better, patient's don't have to sit waiting for film to process.  You never ""run out of cassettes"" with digital.  Protection?  Dose is down, and down quite a bit.   4: No (that question seems a bit odd).  5: We have this ancient weight bearing foot X-Ray machine (uses CR). It still takes the best pictures of feet (over the digital equipment); but then, that's exactly what, and all it was designed to do.   You collimate to the detector, instead of having to know where the plate is in the bucky. Positioning is easier, and so patient comfort is better.   Easier?  Extremities, definitely.  More difficult? Transition to digital, and you'll only have a few cassettes left in the department (instead of shelves/cabinets stuffed with them). That's awesome... until your digital room(s) goes down, the ER is slamming, and all you have is a half-dozen cassettes.  6: Absolutely (for all of the reasons above). Shortly after getting the digital portable (which the ICU docs love because they can look at the image a second after you shoot) they said when they order portables, never to show up with a cassette again... that we were only to bring the digital machine in the future. The images are sharper, and the dose is 1/2 or better; you can't fault that.  On a table, you're still limited by where the bucky can move to. Sometimes a cassette is handier (depending on the patient); unless you have wireless digital cassettes/plates which works just as well as CR.  7: Sturdier detectors for the portable machines. If you drop a CR plate... no big deal. Drop the portable's digital detector... potentially a $100,000 dollar repair. Our early model has a wire, which gets hung up on everything. If your hospital is considering buying a portable digital; go wireless!!!"
Radiology,2whqgk,kensboro,2,Fri Feb 20 06:24:31 2015 UTC,"We've had techs drop our DR detector twice, both of which resulted in the detector having to be replaced. These detectors have a built in impact sensor that logs the time and patient info at the time that it was dropped so that when they locate the tech, they're gonna have some serious explaining to do. We have two DR portables, one being a konica minolta retrofit on an older GE AMX portable and the other being the latest and greatest DR portable from GE. Both are wireless, so they're awesome in that sense but my biggest gripe is the size of the imaging plate on the GE DR portable, it's HUGE. The konica minolta plate is pretty close in size to a 14x17 standard CR plate while the GE DR is 17x17, has a HUGE handle and is twice the thickness of the konica minolta. This makes doing ICU portables a big pain in the ass, having to shove a cassette that size under a patient is no easy task when you're doing portables by yourself. One more thing I'll add, seeing as how the GE DR is brand speaking new equipment, it doesn't come without it's flaws and bugs. We have to reboot the thing two to three times a day when it gets hung up or fails to sync with the imaging plate. This isn't a problem with most patients but when you've got a critical patient coming in through the ER and you've got two doctors and three nurses looking at you waiting for you to verify ETT and central line placement, it's no fun when you tell them the portable has locked up and is going to have to be rebooted (which takes 5-10 minutes). They look at you like it's your fault and as though you're an idiot that can't work your equipment properly. It adds a delay in patient care, which is very unacceptable."
Radiology,2whqgk,derwreck,1 point,Fri Feb 20 12:47:30 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I am not a tech, but from a Biomed/Support side of things:  Digital has made things soooo much faster and is allowing dose to be less.  Not only can you take images faster, you get them instantly, and they are in the radiologists hands in no time.  It has made our job of supporting hospitals and clinics so much easier because now we don't have to worry about film processors (which are very particular machines) and chemicals.  Remote support has meant that we can address issues better over the phone and can fix so much right then and there with out having to wait for someone to arrive on site.  (this does not work all the time, but is great for simple user errors or minor settings tweaks)."

Radiology,2wht5g,derwreck,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:02:27 2015 UTC,"I work in a hospital and our radiology group doesn't really use PAs or anything like that so I can't comment on your questions but I may be able to give a little off topic insight. There are some states that make use of what's called a ""radiology assistant"" which is essentially a PA in radiology but it's only a bachelor's program. To my understanding, they're allowed to do spot films for fluoro procedures, lumbar punctures, minor interventional procedures and things like shooting fluoro for small bowel follow throughs, and fluoro for barium enemas. Their scope of practice is really limited since they're not allowed to read and dictate images like a radiologist can. A PA, in my opinion, benefits a lot more to a radiology group since they have a broader scope of practice and can do more in terms of patient care. It's just that where I live, PAs aren't utilized yet for any radiology group that I know of. If they were, you'd more than likely be used as a pawn for simple procedures that the radiologist doesn't want to waste their time with. If you're really interested in being hands on as a PA, have you ever considered the surgical route? The surgical PAs at our hospital are awesome, they're a valuable asset to the surgeon and the really good ones even make suggestions to the doctor as to different approaches they could potentially make in order to streamline things with the surgery. Our surgical PAs and surgical ANPs are held in a very high regard at our hospital and are allowed a much wider scope of practice than say an NP or PA working in an ER setting."

Radiology,2wht5g,Rad1134,1 point,Fri Feb 20 13:04:25 2015 UTC,"I am an IR and work with several IR PAs covering multiple hospitals. Our PAs are highly skilled and perform port and tunneled catheter placements, fluoro guided bone marrow biopsies, thyroid FNAs, US guided liver biopsies, G and GJ exchanges, LPs and myelograms, and US guided paracentesis and thoracentesis. They are among the most productive members of the IR team. My group would hire more if we could find some that are qualified.   Regarding the comment from the radiology resident, bear in mind that at academic medical centers there are lots of residents that need to learn basic procedures and thus do these cases, so yes, PAs may do more scut. In private practice however there are PLENTY of procedures to go around, and our PAs really help to get the work done.  FYI, a PA student recently did an IR rotation at one of our hospitals. when she graduated, we hired her."

Radiology,2w8lug,InRustWeTrust,5,Tue Feb 17 21:40:28 2015 UTC,"Seems like an odd thing.  A size 10 foot is normal, unless it is significantly swollen so as not to fit in the extremity coil.  An MR is done with the body in a tube, then usually the body part of interest (e.g. foot, head) in a separate little cage called a coil which is what actually receives the signal.  There are lots of different coils, and maybe the extremity coil they are using would not fit his foot for some reason.  In that case, you would switch to a flex coil or another coil (though the images are usually not as good).  If his body is too big (he weighs too much or is too big around) the MR main tube might not accommodate him.  Fingers and toes can be difficult as the magnetic field tends to be variable in these regions and it is difficult for the machine to correct for that sometimes.  Maybe they tried and weren't getting good enough pictures?  There are ways to try and compensate for that too though..."

Looks like you had some L5/S1 surgery ... otherwise it doesn't look too bad.    I don't think a standing MRI would help much here.  A brief look at the literature says that it can magnify disc bulges or spondylolistheses (""slips"").   You don't have much in terms of discs causing spinal canal stenosis.  If you're experiencing pain down a leg, perhaps.  As for slips, a standing X-ray accomplishes the same thing.  Talk to your doctor of course.

The xray really only depicts fractures and dislocations. The MRI can also depict soft tissue injuries, mostly checking for disruption of important ligaments and tendons. You should make sure to check with your doctor regarding whether it's OK to bear full weight on that ankle, or whether you can/should use a soft brace (like a neoprene wrap from a pharmacy - can be very comforting)."

From what I've been told and from what I've seen, they are both interchabgeable for the most part. Any job listing I have ever seen for Nucs accepts either a cert with the NMTCB or ARRT. When it comes time to take my boards, I'll more than likely take my boards with the ARRT seeing as how I've already taken my CT and X-Ray boards through them."
Radiology,2vuofp,friendtyou,2,Sat Feb 14 08:11:14 2015 UTC,"I like that, it's something I'll keep in mind when deciding who I'll take my boards with. My personal theory is that belonging to two different groups (ARRT and NMTCB) would look better on paper.  My supervisor also said the NMTCB version of the test is a bit harder, but im hoping we can have other people shed some light on this."
Radiology,2vuofp,What_the_shit_Archer,4,Sat Feb 14 08:23:16 2015 UTC,"Which one is more respected? Neither. Employers only care that you have one. Which one is easier to get? As far as clinical requirements go, NMTCB requires less clinical competencies than ARRT. As far as board testing goes, I was always told NMTCB was a way easier test than ARRT, but I got a 78% on my NMTCB exam compared to a 94% on the ARRT one, so who knows. As far as future costs go, getting ARRT makes it cheaper to obtain secondary certs like CT, MR, and the like cause you would already have a primary (unless you already have your RT(R), in which case, that point is useless to you). Moral of the story is go big or go home. Getting a certificate is already going to put you at a disadvantage compared to someone who went for their BS, so having both at least shows some extra commitment. Plus, if you accidentally let one expire, you are still covered by the other and can continue working."

I'm not asking for a nailed down diagnosis, especially when the biopsy has the last word as you said.  Lastly, I am just as disappointed that the pelvis was excluded.

He was very good at his job but there was a significant (anecdotal so I don't know the exact #) of women who declined to have him do their mammo simply because he was male.

Confounding ulnar-sided wrist pain and weakness, physio suspected TFCC injury. Doctor says TFCC intact based on this single-injection arthrogram. It was a forceful arm-twisting injury. Not looking for any disagreement, but for anything else that might have been missed.  My other hypothetical curiosity... What are radiologist opinions on single- versus triple-injection arthrogram for diagnosing ulnar sided wrist pain? I read of differing opinions in journals, but wonder about current practises out in the ""real world"".  Much gratitude for any education anyone can offer."

I usually do the three injections. For the TFCC sometimes you can see partial tears or undersurface tears with the DRUJ contrast that you wouldn't otherwise, but there is a lot of variability in what people do and no clear consensus. The other folks that I work with also do 3 site injections.  In doing this you have to also get high res cine flouro images during your injection to help look for tiny tears otherwise you don't know whether contrast is there from your injection or from a tear."

Radiology,2vetsf,derwreck,3,Tue Feb 10 12:37:19 2015 UTC,2 things come to mind. Either the rad is having a shitty day and just felt like passing it on... Or its a money issue. A good radiologist will tell you not to bother with erect abdomen images anyway. They can diagnose a bowel obstruction  on a supine or see free air on the chest for perf. (Feel free to tell me why this is wrong).
Radiology,2vetsf,burstabcess,2,Tue Feb 10 22:56:08 2015 UTC,"It could very well be about money, this is in the US so there's no big surprise there. Interestingly enough, the ER physician ordered a CT abdomen/pelvis in addition to the acute abdominal series. Seems a bit excessive for a child with N/V/D."
Radiology,2vetsf,shadowa4,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:28:18 2015 UTC,I was thinking the money route as well. In the U.S. we have CPT codes for different radiologic exams. Perhaps they need the images to be separate in order to charge for the exams individually.
Radiology,2vetsf,nfreni,3,Wed Feb 11 00:56:32 2015 UTC,"I doubt this if it were at a hospital, the rads get salary not per read (at least thats what I am led to believe).  If this is in the US I bet it boils down to insurance reimbursement. The order requires a chest, upright abd, and supine abd, so unless all three images are submitted it may not be reimbursed so the hospital looses money.  I have gotten around this for certain exams by sending the upright 'chabdomin' then cropping out just the chest portion and resending that. Bam, 3 images, same quality, no insurance issues.  But perhaps I am missing something entirely, but i'm with OP, I dont see the issue with just exposing twice in this scenario."
Radiology,2vetsf,Glonn,1 point,Tue Feb 10 14:01:03 2015 UTC,"I think the rads at our hospital (in the US) get paid on a per read basis as opposed to salary, this may vary from one radiology group to another though. Funny you mention the cropping of the images, my coworkers and I were trying to think of a way to avoid having to do three separate images and then I remembered that we have the ability to reprocess an image to create a duplicate. From the duplicate, you can crop out the chest and leave the upright abdomen portion. I'm gonna start doing this from now on."
Radiology,2vetsf,Rusty_Bumper,1 point,Tue Feb 10 14:57:15 2015 UTC,"As a student my reasoning would be different technique for both.  The abd. and chest both require different techniques to visualize what you are looking for specifically, and trying to use one or find an event ground leaves a chance for the rad to miss something."
Radiology,2vetsf,Baial,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:43:52 2015 UTC,sounds like a good way to burn out the lungs doing them together no?

Radiology,2ux2jz,AnotherRadiologist,1 point,Thu Feb 5 23:21:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I asked my neurologist. Who is a vet she thought it was a bone cyst as well. Thanks!
Radiology,2ux2jz,OmgMacnCheese,10,Fri Feb 6 00:10:36 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify. A cyst is completely different than a bone island. The area is black on MRI cause there aren't any hydrogen atoms to align with the magnetic field and resonate when hit with the RF pulse. A cyst is usually filled with some type of fluid that could have variable signal intensity based on the fluid contents. A bone island is just bone, and unless it's huge or at a critical location won't cause any issues. A cyst is similar, but inherently more susceptible to a pathologic fracture."
Radiology,2ux2jz,OmgMacnCheese,9,Fri Feb 6 01:38:21 2015 UTC,The signal dropout there is not because there are no H atoms to align with the magnetic field. The reason that there is no signal is because the bone island is cortical bone. Cortical bone has a very short T2 (<1ms) so most sequences cannot get any sort of signal from it.  Source: I design UTE sequences.
Radiology,2ux2jz,AnotherRadiologist,4,Fri Feb 6 04:40:32 2015 UTC,What do you think about the potential for UTE in lung?
Radiology,2ux2jz,Yellowbenzene,5,Fri Feb 6 08:48:48 2015 UTC,"I will qualify this by saying I am not too well versed when it comes to pathologies associated with the lungs.   UTE does show a lot of promise when it comes to being able to image the parenchyma in the lung. I've also looked at some promising papers that show the promise when it comes to fibrosis and non small cell lung cancers.  I think the technology is actually pretty good since we can get fast and high resolution images. However, the implementation will be a little challenging. To begin with, most UTE sequences are 3D radial so you have to go through a (computationally intensive) gridding process. In addition, when you are doing body imaging, 3D radial isn't as good when it comes to gating or navigators currently.  So overall, we are doing quite well and hopefully in the next 5-10 years, we will be seeing product sequences that offer multi-contrast, multi-echo and UTE imaging."

Radiology,2ux2jz,Musicman425,3,Thu Feb 5 22:15:40 2015 UTC,It's probably an enostosis or bone island.  Confirm it with plain radiographs of the knee.

As far as IR goes, I thank God every single day that I had that one mentor who told me that I would get sick of standing in lead all day unclogging arteries and veins.  I see 5-7 patients a day and let me tell you, that is PLENTY of patient contact for me.  CT and US guided biopsies, thoras/paras, and spine injections are enough procedural stuff for me."
Radiology,2uo1n9,yigit3,1 point,Wed Feb 4 04:53:06 2015 UTC,anyone can do body   But not everyone can do it well
Radiology,2uo1n9,Musicman425,2,Wed Feb 4 10:46:37 2015 UTC,"Very true. Especially when it starts to get complicated, like tertiary care centers/academic centers with multiple complex operations/revisions/rumors."

Radiology,2uo1n9,fish_in_a_nest,1 point,Tue Feb 3 23:55:52 2015 UTC,Is that going with just having quality Techs to perform? What's the reason behind your last statement?
Radiology,2uo1n9,Arandy05,5,Wed Feb 4 00:56:23 2015 UTC,I guess he means there are less really fat kids so the US has less to penetrate. A lot of US reports I see in adults have the usual 'patient habitus limits the examination'.
Radiology,2uo1n9,Arandy05,2,Wed Feb 4 01:44:13 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Thanks for clearing that up.
Radiology,2uo1n9,jotjen,3,Wed Feb 4 01:59:36 2015 UTC,In the UK we don't have US techs. Surprisingly radiologists actually do their own scans. We do have sonographers too who can scan and report their own images.

Radiology,2uo1n9,TheLZ,3,Sun Feb 8 23:41:31 2015 UTC,"I'm a pediatric radiologist.  I am grateful every day I come to work, I have what is for me the perfect job.  People are often hesitant to image kids, and kids are often slow to report symptoms, so the combination means you have a much higher pre-test probability of pathology for any given exam. There is not really any wading through mountains of normal studies before finding that interesting gem.  Peds Rads also get to do a little bit of everything - every sub-subspecialty is present and you generally can do them all.  Though I work at a larger peds hospital and we are slowing moving towards further specialization.  As such I do a lot of MSK and chest, though body MR is pretty interesting. Just about the only things I don't do is mammo, which is fine, and IR - we have a dedicated peds IR group for that stuff.  Pediatric medicine is also more rewarding for me, kids rarely bring problems on themselves. Also, they are extremely resilient and can survive and thrive despite the harshest insults.  I feel like adults keel over at the drop of a hat sometimes... Also anyone who has worked in both adult and pediatric settings knows that everyone is friendlier, and coworkers are more motivated and happier when they get to be helping kids.  Downside is that if you want to do pure peds you are almost surely going to have to do academics, which is not for everyone.  The job market is also tight depending on your geographic leanings."
Radiology,2uo1n9,rykh7,2,Sat Feb 7 00:02:36 2015 UTC,"I couldn't pick a well, I was split between IR, body and MSK.  But I wanted to live somewhat rural.   So I ended up doing general and have no regrets.   I like the mix.  The only problem I see is I feel like I am a Jack of all trades,  master of none at times.   But still wouldn't change it."

Radiology,2uo1n9,Musicman425,1 point,Wed Feb 4 02:03:52 2015 UTC,I do not I was planning on getting one but was aggressively recruited by a small center.  They wanted me to start a year earlier and did not need a fellowship trained person.
Radiology,2uo1n9,vasculopath,1 point,Wed Feb 4 02:30:52 2015 UTC,Do you feel like that is the best way to market yourself to a private firm? To be a jack of all trades so that they can get the most bang for their buck?
Radiology,2uo1n9,vasculopath,2,Wed Feb 4 02:09:58 2015 UTC,Yes and no.  For large academic centers I would need/prefer a fellowship.  But if it is a smaller practice or more rural area a group likely will not have many fellowship areas covered.  So a person who can do everything is valuable. So it really depends on the market one is after.
Radiology,2uo1n9,vasculopath,2,Wed Feb 4 02:29:10 2015 UTC,"Well I assume he is a third year and has gone on multiple interviews, since interviews are basically over and the match is coming up for ACGME programs, or spots filled for non-ACGME.   As you'll see, everyone has their biased views. One poster thinks the world of MSK (bone marrow edema and finding contrajoint ligamentous injury is super satisfying... but ""neuro is just the brain and spine, no biggie""), or the generalist who loves what he does, Body imager who enjoys it. He has to go towards what he enjoys. If he doesn't want to talk about MSK a large part of his life, then don;t do that. Goes for any topic. It's what you care about, and can live with talking about the majority of the rest of your life. If it's no specific thing, then maybe general no fellowship may be the way to go."
Radiology,2uo1n9,Thornwalker_,2,Wed Feb 4 13:49:26 2015 UTC,"I also think that it is important to like working with the referers you will see most.  In IR, it is a lot of surgical problems, and in general I like Surgeons.  If you don't like dealing with neurologists and neurosurgeons on the phone all day, Neuro is not for you.  If you generally like to hang out with ortho guys, go MSK.  Pediatric rays is fine if you like dealing with pediatricians, etc."
Radiology,2uo1n9,vasculopath,4,Wed Feb 4 15:08:56 2015 UTC,"IR, as I would rather do 10-15 things in a day and talk to patients and directly help them than do 150 things in a dark room with little feedback.  I still like Dx Rad, but I LOVE IR, and I've been doing it for 15 years.  I've done academics and private practice, but I like private better because you're less removed from your patients.   Fellows and residents often shy away from IR as they are worried about competition from other specialties, but that is very regional.  I love my Job!"
Radiology,2uo1n9,Thornwalker_,3,Tue Feb 3 23:35:32 2015 UTC,"He is leaning towards I IR as well because he likes to work with his hands, and quite frankly crunching out images a thousand miles a minute stuck in a dark room day after day can get very tedious and tiring. But on the other hand, and this is going to sound very superficial, but he didn't get into radiology to live a surgeon's lifestyle. Do you feel that there is a balance where IR allows you to still do things that you enjoy outside of work and not have a very hectic schedule?"
Radiology,2uo1n9,AnotherRadiologist,3,Wed Feb 4 02:08:53 2015 UTC,"IR usually has more out of the hospital but on cell/pager type of call than dx rad, but it's not really surgeon lifestyle.  Very few consults without procedures for example.  It can vary significantly from region to region and hospital to hospital, but for example, I share call with only one other IR, and we cover 28 days a month, leaving 2-3 days uncovered (small hospital, many specialties are not full coverage) so technically, I'm on call nearly 50% of the time, but I only get called to do a procedure once every 10 days or so, and then only for a few hours usually. It takes my team an hour to get in and be ready for a procedure, so I have a 60 mile radius or so to roam while on call.  I have kids in elementary school so it's not like work ties me down more than family life does."
Radiology,2up7cs,chordae,3,Wed Feb 4 00:33:49 2015 UTC,"make sure to do rads & surgery rotations early then, so you can decide sooner. I just left surgery for rads (to do IR). While IR lifestyle is worse than DR, its not as bad as gen surg."
Radiology,2up7cs,sspatel,3,Wed Feb 4 03:28:49 2015 UTC,"Do you think you'd like doing some diagnostic radiology? If not, stay away from IR. While there are some docs who only do IR, most are doing some amount of diagnostic as well. Even with the new primary IR pathway, you're still dual boarded and will be doing a ton of diagnostic rotations in residency and probably in practice. If you don't enjoy it at least somewhat, you're not going to be happy."
Radiology,2up7cs,bretticusmaximus,1 point,Wed Feb 4 05:48:02 2015 UTC,"That's good to know, I guess I have to spend some time with DR to see if I enjoy it. I generally enjoy solving puzzles and like to do some procedures so that's why I became interested in the field. How is the job market?"
Radiology,2up7cs,bretticusmaximus,1 point,Wed Feb 4 06:13:02 2015 UTC,"Job market is not great, but seems to be maybe turning the corner. I thunk most people would say it's better for IR. However for you, you're so far out that the current market is probably irrelevant. No one knows how it will be in 8 years."
Radiology,2up7cs,jabolcnipolz,1 point,Wed Feb 4 13:52:44 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you mean by ""minimally invasive"" (some people consider laparoscopy to be minimally invasive). I realize you're an M2, but have you done any shadowing in either field? That will hopefully give you an idea of the kind of practice each specialty entails.  Re: dual IR/DR certification, SIR expects the first class to match in 2017, I believe, so I think you would be eligible. That being said, even if things weren't ready in time for your graduation, you would still be eligible for an IR fellowship (through 2021, I believe)."

That helped me understand the mechanical parts of imaging better.   2) A lot of times I hated my study. Particularly when studying parts of the human body that you don't find interesting. It's all important but as soon as you enter there clinic and start working with patients you will find yourself liking certain area's more then others. Everybody will do their own part in helping the patient. Everybody is an expert in his/her own area. Respect that and do what you do best. Its all teamwork!  3) hmmm... In our system (which is similar to the belgium system, I study at the university of amsterdam btw) the first years are kinda hard. The matter isn't all that difficult but its simply a lot of information to remember. For me studying math would be hard as I am not good with numbers, medicine however is different kind of hard. Later as you start to understand the bigger picture and the synergy between all the different organs it will become more easy. The more you practice the better you get.  Keep in mind that following a doctor for a day might give you a good view of the day to day work that person does. However, these people tend to be doing this work for a long time so you don't see the proces of them getting where they are. Keep in mind that it takes a lot of years to become a good doctor. (its 6 years of medschool, in the netherlands we require a couple of years working experience after that before you can apply to become a specialist or a gp. Most specialist programs take another 5 years)  3) As I stated before medicine is a different kind of hard in comparison to math or economie. Its a lot but if you are motivated that would not be a problem. What makes it easier is that you are surrounded by people who do the same thing. That makes a bond and you will help each other keep motivated when studying. In my experience if you are able to get a degree in high school (VWO in the netherlands or ASO in belgium) you have the possibility to become a doctor. Whatever you lack in intelligence you will make up in effort. What we say is ""willen is kunnen"" (If you want something you will be able to do so).  Besides that I work everyday in the clinic from 08:00 to +- 18:00/19:00u. I go out every friday and saterday (its important to keep doing fun stuff!). Besides that I sport at least three times a week. I do not study in the evening but I might occasionally read some research in the weekends or on the morning train.  5) I am an intern (coassistent in dutch) in the academical medical centre of Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam. I tried studying in belgium (University of Gent) but I fell in love with Amsterdam. My University is modern and very open minded. This city just loves her students.  Its a lot of informations and could keep on writing. If you're ever wondering about studying here, send me a pm and I'll show you around.  EDIT: I might add that I am working on becoming an Interventional radiologist. You have to do some thing besides studying to get a better chance. I was the chairman of the student council for a year (stopped studying) and I do an honors program besides the regular program. I have an interest in education so I started an echo teaching school. Just to show that you can and should do more than the program they give you. Say yes to whatever you find sounds amazing and you will make a lot of new friends and learn a lot about yourself. All things that I find will make you a better doctor."

Probably not all the physics you're after, but it's a start with simple/functional explanations."
Radiology,2u35e9,trobert4001,2,Fri Jan 30 11:59:31 2015 UTC,There are tons of anatomy videos on YouTube that may help you

Radiology,2u35e9,Alako,2,Thu Jan 29 22:44:07 2015 UTC,To what level?  3D anatomy online is good.  Headneckbrainspine is also great.  But for me there's no substitute to sitting with coffee and my copy of Weir.
Radiology,2u35e9,thecrusha,2,Thu Jan 29 17:48:44 2015 UTC,"Depending on how you like to learn. But I actually just got a anatomy coloring book. and just spent time coloring and doodling in it.  It sounds kinda dumb, but the best thing i did to learn sectional was to get a really good understanding of anatomy in general, it then becomes easier to visualize anatomy within a slice."

Radiology,2u35e9,jayysampps,2,Thu Jan 29 22:01:49 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I don't remember what book it was. I finished the MRI program at the University of Iowa in May and pitched it pretty much immediately. It depends on what your having trouble with, they didn't put much emphasis on learning all the muscular system, so I focused on, and had the most trouble with learning abdominal and thorax anatomy. Sorry I cant be more help."
Radiology,2u1icg,mgrote,5,Thu Jan 29 03:18:35 2015 UTC,"Great, as if kids need another reason to be scared of the CT scanner."
Radiology,2u0sfp,carolinaelite12,3,Wed Jan 28 23:44:24 2015 UTC,"I don't have great advice for you, but I'm looking to do what you are doing... but in reverse. I have my BS in Biology and MA in Healthcare admin. I'm looking to go back to become a rad tech and pursue that for a few years and hopefully move into a management role. Thoughts? Also, in your situation, I would say the best bet is to make yourself as specialized and diverse as you can get. The PA route sounds like the best route, but MAKE SURE you get amazing grades for your BS and also do volunteer or pick up any healthcare experience you can get. I tried to get into PA school right after school, but they are damn hard to get into. Hope my advice somewhat helps! good luck!"
Radiology,2u0sfp,shouldbeworking23,1 point,Thu Jan 29 00:59:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply. I read on one of the program's website that volunteering is important, so with your reaffirmation of that I will definitely start looking to do that more.  As far as a career choice goes, I absolutely love x-ray. I love interacting with patients and getting to know what's wrong with them and why we do the exams. Everyday is different: different patients, different exams, different doctors. If you like a structured worked environment where the variables change everyday, then x-ray is awesome. Each patient presents new techniques and new challenges. And management is definitely a good way to go if you have the desire and drive to want to achieve that. It's a steady job with a lot of job security.   However I would definitely check the job market in your area for radiographers. I see a lot of people on this subreddit who claim that their area is saturated with techs, and there aren't enough jobs. I fortunately don't have that problem, because I live in an area that houses the largest medical district in the world.   Good luck with your decision. If you have any question about the profession from a students stand-point then I will be more than happy to answer them."
Radiology,2u0sfp,TopicsInRadiography,2,Thu Jan 29 02:51:33 2015 UTC,"I received my BS in Radiologic Science in 2007 and am currently in a Management role (I also teach radiography on the side).  I would say it depends on what you'd rather do... if you want to go into management, either of your degree options would be fine - no one really cares what your degree is in (in my personal experience) until you get to a director or executive level, in which case a Master's would be preferred.  Either of those course routes would make you eligible for a Masters of Health Administration, MBA, or Masters of Public Health.  If you're going for PA school, you may be better off going with a major in Biology or pre-med.  Check into the prerequisites of the schools you are considering for PA school, and compare the courses required with the curriculum of any Bachelor's programs you are considering.  If you're concerned about time and/or money, you may end up needing additional course work beyond the two routes you specified to allow you to be eligible for PA school.  But again, it depends on the school you're interested in."
Radiology,2txg2y,trobert4001,24,Wed Jan 28 04:32:07 2015 UTC,"It's upsetting.  Patients are certainly scanned more than they need to be - especially in the US.  CR is a fantastically inappropriate place to see that published.  Since the consumer is effectively flying blind in the medical system, this article does nothing but attack the credibility of the physician's ethics.   All of that exposure poses serious health threats.    One liners like that have no place in a magazine that bills itself as a consumer advocate.  That sounds maybe a little terse, and I think it's good for patients to ask questions and be involved in their care, but at the same time, this article strikes me as mindless fear mongering.  It further strikes me as irresponsible since it may discourage patients from receiving diagnostic imaging that has a positive impact on mortality."
Radiology,2txg2y,thebigslide,3,Wed Jan 28 05:26:29 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, mindless fear mongering is the appropriate term.  It's infuriating to me."
Radiology,2txg2y,YouveGotMeSoakAndWet,1 point,Wed Jan 28 18:21:36 2015 UTC,"Especially in the US there is probably a role for ""consumer"" ie patient education. I still regularly get patients demanding inappropriate investigations for which the easiest approach would be to just do the study. This kind of publication may help my efforts to educate patients."
Radiology,2txg2y,Hypno-phile,1 point,Wed Jan 28 15:32:39 2015 UTC,"If you have a competent technologist doing your exam then all should be well. I agree with the over scan/expose issue. The doctors at my facility seem to order xrays on everyone for anything. Sometimes they order exams on the wrong anatomy. ""Oh your leg hurts? better get an abdomen xray"". More times than not we will call the dr and ask if its a mistake and correct it if so.  I still believe the benefit far outweighs the risk, but that potential benefit depends on who you have doing your exam. Im still a student but I have been more or less scolded for trying to collimate on patients because they just want to get it done.   It has gotten so bad that I recently did a T-spine spot in our fully digital room, which warrants an 8x10 image, and had the collimator opened up to 14x17. I realized after the fact what I did and immediately felt terrible. My overseeing tech said it was a good image and to move on.  Im much more aware now. (sorry for the rambling...)"
Radiology,2txg2y,peedzllab,13,Sat Jan 31 15:38:46 2015 UTC,"In the US, I think a lot of ""excess"" radiation comes from insurance. Like the upright and supine abdomen that has to be negative before we do a CT abdomen/pelvis."
Radiology,2txg2y,Baial,11,Wed Jan 28 04:51:50 2015 UTC,"I had a radiologist give me a lecture once about how the upright/supine abdomen is one of the most-ordered, yet least diagnostic exams that we can do in Xray. He went on for almost an hour total. I loved it! I wish he would give the same lecture to the ER docs. Lol"
Radiology,2txg2y,kjvdp,8,Wed Jan 28 05:05:36 2015 UTC,I hate abdo plain films. Absolutely useless 99.9% of the time.
Radiology,2txg2y,CommissarAJ,7,Wed Jan 28 09:14:00 2015 UTC,"I've had a radiologist give a similar rant when I was student. He remarked at the end, 'half the time, they see what they were hoping for...and then they do a CT scan to better assess it. The other half, they don't see anything conclusive...so they do a CT scan to better view the abdomen.'"
Radiology,2txg2y,Viaon,1 point,Wed Jan 28 09:30:03 2015 UTC,This is a reason I wish that radiologists were more directly involved with patient care. Attendings could refer to the rad to ask what exams may be useful rather than just ordering it..
Radiology,2txg2y,1radgirl,8,Fri Jan 30 04:37:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, and the plain film knee and shoulder X-rays the provider has to order before the insurance will pay for an MRI. The provider will come to me and say, ""I know these films are going to be negative because the patient has a soft tissue injury we aren't going to be able to see on X-ray, and what I really need is an MRI, but the insurance won't pay for it unless I get plain films first. So let's do that so I can get their MRI scheduled."" What a waste of money, effort, and most importantly dose to the patient!"
Radiology,2txg2y,YouveGotMeSoakAndWet,6,Wed Jan 28 06:37:37 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Patients ask me all the time ""Will this show my rotator cuff?""  No.  ""Then why are we doing it.....?""  Because your insurance won't pay for the MRI that will show it if we don't do this.  I wish I had a better answer for them!"
Radiology,2txg2y,YouveGotMeSoakAndWet,14,Wed Jan 28 18:22:44 2015 UTC,"As an msk rad I like having a recent plain film available when I'm reading an MR. The two modalities are complimentary in msk radiology. And I feel the minimal radiation exposure for a two or three view plain film is worth the marginal risk of the extra radiation if it helps me make an accurate diagnosis.   As an example, not infrequently I'll find a fleck calcific tendinitis on a plain film that is invisible on MR."
Radiology,2txg2y,thebigslide,3,Wed Jan 28 19:00:26 2015 UTC,"That's excellent to have input, now I have something new to tell my patients!"
Radiology,2txg2y,Chunderbutt,4,Wed Jan 28 20:52:33 2015 UTC,A further recent example would be the nasal bone posted to this very subreddit.
Radiology,2txg2y,CommissarAJ,2,Wed Jan 28 05:09:23 2015 UTC,Or coccyx
Radiology,2txg2y,kjvdp,5,Wed Jan 28 07:25:44 2015 UTC,"In the UK only radiologists can justify CT imaging, so we don't really have this problem. That said, you do get radiologists closely linked to physicians/surgeons who just scan everything that comes their way - but they are the minority."
Radiology,2txg2y,BoulderEric,3,Wed Jan 28 09:15:35 2015 UTC,"We're supposed to have a similar arrangement up here in Canada...but the amount of scans I do these days make me think otherwise. It varies of radiologist it seems...some are willing to push back and put their foot down when they think something's pointless, others seem willing to rubber stamp whatever comes their way. It's gotten to the point where my motto on overnight shifts is 'It's not a PE'."
Radiology,2txg2y,YouveGotMeSoakAndWet,4,Wed Jan 28 09:40:50 2015 UTC,"I want to share a couple things on this. Firstly, as a Rad Tech, I can easily say that one of the main reasons I perform unnecessary Xrays or CT's is at the request, and sometimes demand, of the uninformed patient. Unfortunately, if a doctor tells a patient that there is no reason for a CT but the patient still demands it, they usually capitulate.   Secondly, improper evaluation. If you come to the ER, do NOT get xrays unless you have been seen by the physician. Yes, the nurse will examine you, but they cannot order xrays. Doesn't mean they won't. A lot of the time, the doctor may not need the Xray, or the nurse might have ordered one exam when the doctor wants a different one.  Third, this article covers the use of ultrasound for appendicitis. Yes, this can be effective. SOMETIMES. Our hospital protocol is US for anyone under 100lbs because after a certain BMI, it is difficult to see the appendix. 9 times out of ten, we don't get a negative ultrasound, but rather an inconclusive one, and end up doing a CT."
Radiology,2txg2y,thellios,3,Wed Jan 28 05:03:41 2015 UTC,"Between US, physical exam, and blood, you can usually diagnose acute appendicitis without irradiating someone's gonads."
Radiology,2txg2y,terrorismofthemind,4,Thu Jan 29 08:24:33 2015 UTC,"Shit like this makes my job so hard.  I had a patient who was so worried about the radiation that she had herself in a state, MISSED the breathing instructions because she was so focused on worrying about radiation, breathed all the way through my scan, which the rad then had me repeat (of course, there was breathing motion!) and then the patient LOST HER DAMN MIND about the repeat exposure.  (Disclaimer, yes I communicated with and prepped the patient fully, told her what to expect with breathing instructions, I thought she was ready to handle it.)  Things like this are just clickbait scare tactics, essentially.  The patient isn't truly at liberty to decide whether they need a scan or not, so this is of little value to them.  They can refuse it, sure.  They can talk to their doctor about the true necessity of it, sure.  But once it's been ordered stuff like this does nothing but make patients worried and then give us techs hell.  It's an infuriating cycle."
Radiology,2txg2y,ITNpublisher,3,Wed Jan 28 18:20:39 2015 UTC,"I really detest the use of an ""24 percent increased cancer risk"" - for uninformed or fast readers this almost reads like they have a one in four chance of developing cancer, just present the figures the way they are and let people make up their own mind. -hold on- I just saw the video; it confirms the tone of the text; this piece is terrible sensationalist scare-tactic journalism. While I do agree I see enough scans with flimsy reasoning, this kind of propaganda scares people into thought patterns like the anti-vaccing movements. I'm all for informing people, but -please- let it be an objective medium informing everyone."
Radiology,2txg2y,TokenGestures,3,Wed Jan 28 17:21:09 2015 UTC,I think Consumer Reports is full of shit on a matter of topics and products.
Radiology,2txg2y,TopicsInRadiography,2,Wed Jan 28 21:55:06 2015 UTC,"The CR piece was, in the very least, irresponsible – igniting yet another media firestorm that will, no doubt, result in unnecessary and unwarranted consumer panic.  see: http://www.itnonline.com/content/where-have-all-cowboys-gone"
Radiology,2txg2y,LordRuby,1 point,Mon Feb 2 17:28:00 2015 UTC,"Sure there are pointless exams that are done but medical radiation is hardly even considered a risk when used only when medically necessary. The only reason there's an associated ""risk"" tied to radiation is because there is always a ""chance"" it could cause major problems just like people have a ""chance"" to win the lottery if they play. So the article has some fair points but the risk is trivial which takes away from its purpose."

All I can say is keep pushing forward with your education and be aggressive about expanding into other modalities if the opportunity arises.

Radiology,2tohy2,TokenGestures,1 point,Tue Jan 27 00:47:01 2015 UTC,"Radiologists are known for ""hedging"", meaning they are willing to suggest a diagnosis but not commit to it without either further testing or ""clinical correlation"", ie determining whether or not the diagnosis based on the imaging matches a diagnosis possible from a physical examination and patient history  (radiologists often see the imaging but don't come in contact with the patient).  The joke here is that the injury is overwhelmingly obvious but the radiologist is still afraid to definitively describe it without clinical correlation."

Radiology,2tdvpk,ultrasonic76,4,Fri Jan 23 08:06:15 2015 UTC,The humeral head is enlocated and there are no acute fractures. There seems to be heavily calcified structures between the clavicle and scapula. Could they be calcified trapezoid and conoid ligaments from an old injury?
Radiology,2tdvpk,ninjase,4,Fri Jan 23 12:33:54 2015 UTC,"Humeral head is normal (other than evidence of mild rotator cuff tendinopathy). But there is post traumatic ossification of coracoclavicular ligament. Similar findings also seen in patients with chronic renal disease, but id calcification rather than ossification."
Radiology,2tdvpk,J_F_Kevorkian,3,Fri Jan 23 13:05:23 2015 UTC,What's the evidence of rotator cuff tendinopathy?
Radiology,2tdvpk,Metamba,3,Fri Jan 23 16:44:04 2015 UTC,Sclerosis and mild irregularity of the greater tuberosity where the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons insert. People with chronic rc tendinopathy get reactive osseous changes where tendons insert.

These are usually ball park ranges. However,  experience will probably work out better when observing your sensitivity number or exposure index after an exam has been completed. Also, one general rule that helped me was that the same techniques are the same such as ; hand=foot, ankle=wrist, elbow=knee, humerus=femur and so on and so on. Hoped this help answer you question. Wish I could be more informative due to the fact that I'm still pretty green to the field. Good luck !"

Radiology,2tcfqd,Nordok,3,Mon Jan 26 19:04:28 2015 UTC,"Do you have a mini notebook or something where you log your cases? I recommend writing the techniques there. Also, at my placement, we were always writing the techniques down on the patient's chart. Perhaps just writing it more will help you."
Radiology,2tcfqd,worthlessfucksunited,2,Fri Jan 23 13:21:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was recommended to me at the beginning of my first semester, but I wasn't dutifully carrying it , as I should have. I'm definitely going to start that again, because it's popular advice."
Radiology,2tcfqd,TokenGestures,2,Fri Jan 23 21:49:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly when I graduated I still wasn't comfortable with techniques. If your AEC works well, look at what it rings up as for your exams, eventually you will see a ballpark. I worked in a room that's AEC did not work well, so after getting mad about having to repeat all the time, you get more and more comfortable setting your own technique.  The more you do it, the better you'll get at it. It's as simple as that.  Good luck with everything. :-)"
Radiology,2tcfqd,vodkaSuperhero,1 point,Fri Jan 23 04:22:06 2015 UTC,"Well that's a little comforting. I think I need to get in a better mindset, and just attack it over and over."
Radiology,2tcfqd,derwreck,2,Fri Jan 23 04:31:13 2015 UTC,"Learn about using longer time and lower kvp techniques. It helps immensely with looking at finer detail. I use 50kvp 60ma and up to 3.2 seconds (breathing) for lat t spines. It is the bomb for trabecular detail. I use a similar technique for coccyx, pa sternums, ap lumbar spines that are obscured by bowel gas. With DR the reps will tell you it is not required, depends on the post processing algorithm the system is programmed with. Good luck!"
Radiology,2tcfqd,vodkaSuperhero,2,Fri Jan 23 06:08:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, man. I know it's important for breathing techniques, but I don't even have a grip on regular mAs measurements. I definitely don't have the skill to be messing with time and mA, independently."
Radiology,2tcfqd,derwreck,2,Fri Jan 23 11:39:19 2015 UTC,What worked for me is to make a chart starting with the lowest kV up to the highest. It helped me picture it better and made the patterns make more sense. Keep in mind around ~70 is where grid techniques are used.
Radiology,2tcfqd,silflay,2,Fri Jan 23 10:05:45 2015 UTC,"That is one thing I can count on... I know from class which ones require grid, so I at least get the feel for kV, but mAs still eludes me. We were given charts, and maybe I just need to print them all out and hit it hard. Might take out a square mile of rainforest, though."
Radiology,2tcfqd,vodkaSuperhero,2,Fri Jan 23 11:37:00 2015 UTC,If you rewrite them yourself it's a good memorization technique. Memorizing mA is less important since it changes a lot and has less bearing on image contrast.
Radiology,2tcora,SineadNZ,9,Fri Jan 23 00:57:14 2015 UTC,"Sometimes they're just too fat to find it.  You learn to guess, but as a tip if you find the greater trochanter you can find the pubic symphysis and go from there.    I dont recommend touching the symphysis tho..."
Radiology,2tcora,Glonn,1 point,Fri Jan 23 02:02:39 2015 UTC,I second this. Finding trochanter on obese patients is easier than ASIS or crest.
Radiology,2tcora,Viaon,5,Sat Jan 24 03:59:13 2015 UTC,"I've asked larger patients to put their hands on their hips, so I at least have a general idea of where to start. I've told them that I wasn't sure how tender their abdomen is, and didn't want to cause them any more pain. It's more polite than telling someone that they have too much padding.  Another thing to remember is that their skeleton is about the same size as yours. Depending on where their weight is situated on their body (like beer gut vs general apple shaped), sometimes it's easier to push from their side, find the iliac crest, and follow the bony landmark down to the ASIS.  Sometimes you just have to take a shot in the dark. Best bet is to ask a bunch of the techs at your facility what their trick is. Hopefully you find something that works for you!"
Radiology,2tcora,Schala00neg,4,Fri Jan 23 01:43:29 2015 UTC,"Looking for ASIS to line up a KUB?  I center at iliac crest, which is way easier to find on a large person than the ASIS."

Radiology,2tcora,silflay,3,Fri Jan 23 06:24:23 2015 UTC,"This may sound like an obvious answer, but... PUSH HARD!  I had trouble finding crest as a student until a tech noticed how gentle I was being.  Even if I thought I had felt it, I doubted myself because it was so slight.  Even in fairly large patients I can find it now.  You will learn to feel out anatomy much better with experience."
Radiology,2tcora,burstabcess,3,Fri Jan 23 03:31:43 2015 UTC,"Tips for palpating anything in general:  always tell the patient first (I just need to feel your bones to get the right position) Use an open palm (imagine someone poking you, just weird) Palpate the non sore side if they are injured, they will be the same both sides Be confident quick and firm Last resort, I get them to point to where the boney bit is between their legs or over their hips, they know where it is."
Radiology,2tcora,doc_k,1 point,Fri Jan 23 06:16:06 2015 UTC,"DO student here. Generally even with fat patients you can just pull down their drawers a little bit and see their ASIS poking out. Might be under their gut a little. The best way though, if you're comfortable with touching the patient and explain what you're doing, just go down their lateral rib cage to their iliac crests and follow them medially/anteriorly to the ASIS.  Don't be afraid to stick your hands in there and find them.  Generally people are cool about touching everywhere except, breasts, genitals, and butthole.  Just explain what you're looking for.  EDIT:  I don't know who told you that the ASIS were at the umbilicus but that's just way wrong.  Almost always inferior, but an especially bad landmark because people's bellybuttons can very in positioning so much."

Radiology,2tcora,TokenGestures,1 point,Sat Jan 24 04:00:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, from what I've learned just tell the patient that you're going to feel for a landmark and that it will be a little rough. I had issues with palpating on bigger patients simply because I didn't want to push hard. Just palpate the side that isn't hurting and they'll be understanding. Also, have a backup landmark to feel for if it's just simply unclear. I like to use three landmarks and meet them all to be accurate."
Radiology,2tcora,SassafrasSprite,1 point,Fri Jan 23 05:12:21 2015 UTC,Thank you for posting this! KUBs are my worst enemy. I already know I palpate too gently. Figured that out recently.

Look for their elbows- place the top of the light field about 2-3 inches inferior to their elbow joint.  That should lead you close to the top of the pelvis, and you should be able to locate ASIS from there.  http://www.anatomystuff.co.uk/repository/product/user/img_img_A10_human_skeleton_anatomical_model.jpg"

Radiology,2tcora,peedzllab,1 point,Sat Jan 31 21:29:45 2015 UTC,"A trick I have been taught is to find the Xiphoid process and stretch my my hand out. I use my thumb to hold they Xiphoid spot and stretch out my pinky, more times than not where ever they pinky lands is about the area of the illiac crest. Also you can palpate the Xiphoid and put the top of you light at the tip of the process. The latter of the two doesnt come out as accurate due to different body habitus(habitus's/habiti?). Ive learned that there is no such thing as a ""Merril's patient""!"

Radiology,2t5iej,n0whereman,2,Wed Jan 21 13:12:29 2015 UTC,This looks like CPPD
Radiology,2t5iej,CremasterReflex,3,Wed Jan 21 21:02:47 2015 UTC,"Google suggests that those cystic lesions in the context of CPPD would be called geodes. There doesn't seem to be an abundance of reactive inflammatory sclerosis of the the bone though. It seems like the presence of multiple lesions in multiple joints would preclude a malignancy, but what kind of workup would be necessary to rule out say osteoclastoma or multiple myeloma? Would that even be necessary?"
Radiology,2t5iej,MalcontentUK,3,Thu Jan 22 04:04:59 2015 UTC,"No I can't see it'd be necessary to be honest. The imaging appearances and location are typical of an erosive arthropathy - all the lesions are peri-articular, reasonably well defined and there is marked soft tissue swelling/fluid in the joints. Osteoclastoma/GCT just don't have this appearance, multiplicity is rare and carpal bone involvement is also rare. Multiple Myeloma is usually not so well defined, and if it were this severe in the wrist I'd expect them to be riddled with disease and very symptomatic. From a radiology point of view I would only go down the malignancy route with this if there are atypical features given from the history - the radiology features just don't push in that direction."

Radiology,2t1jqp,tehgearz,1 point,Wed Jan 21 07:56:38 2015 UTC,What was the injection rate and delay? Or was it triggered off an ROI?
Radiology,2sy9j8,shadowa4,12,Mon Jan 19 17:19:22 2015 UTC,"I can kind of understand this. MRI is probably the better test. But, where I'm from, MRI's often take an act of Congress to get scheduled in a timely manner, while CT scans can typically be done more urgently. That once in a blue moon, though, there's a cancellation or something and the MRI can be worked in.  So he's saying, ""do the MRI if you can, but if not, I'll settle for the CT with contrast."""
Radiology,2sy9j8,count_zero11,9,Mon Jan 19 22:30:08 2015 UTC,"There's a common misconception that there is a hierarchy of what's good in medical imaging that goes something like...  Ultrasound < fluoroscopy < radiography < CT < MRI  It's just not true. Each modality has its strengths and weaknesses, and just because you can't get an MRI doesn't mean a CT is appropriate, particularly for chronic headache."
Radiology,2sy9j8,AnotherRadiologist,8,Tue Jan 20 00:03:50 2015 UTC,"This may be true, but if I suspect a brain mass because the patient has a new cranial nerve deficit (as was helpfully included on the Rx) you can bet I won't let the patient wait a few weeks to get in that MRI slot, I'm going to go for a CT now.  In OP's case, the MRI is the ""better"" modality to use, but CT will show me a large space-occupying lesion just fine.  It looks to me like the doc just wanted to see what was going on in the patient's head, right now.  And if the radiologist can squeeze in the MRI today, great. If not, get the CT scan and if it's negative he can think about getting the MRI in the normal time frame.  Or maybe I'm giving him too much credit :-)"
Radiology,2sy9j8,count_zero11,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:00:44 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with a clinician asking the radiologist to pick the best test. The problem for me is the low quality of this request - it's pretty confusing and unclear. First it says ""Increasing blurriness = occipital"" (implying occipital lobe pathology) and then it says ""retina to optic nerves pathology"" which is a contradiction and gives no reasons for that statement. The 6 month history suggests chronicity but nothing on the form suggests how urgent the case is - today? this week?  Urgency is the key with this case in terms of modality chosen as the clinician has essentially asked for both a cranial nerve AND brain exam - MRI would be more definitive, while a CT might rule out a few specific possibilities but would still really need to be followed by an MRI. If they want it done very urgently or as an emergency then they need to say that and I'd try to do an MRI today but likely end up doing do a CT same day for practical reasons and then do an urgent MRI afterwards. Otherwise I would regard this as an ""urgent out-patient scan"" - that is within the next 2 weeks - and I'd just do an MRI.  So as a Radiologist I will pick the best test if you ask me, but I won't necessarily pick the quickest/most easily available modality - I'd need a good reason to say ""lets do the suboptimal but quicker test"" and that hinges entirely on the information given on the request form. And to me at least, the request doesn't say ""do the MRI if you can, but if not, I'll settle for the CT with contrast."", it says ""I'm not sure what the best test is, please use your judgement and pick for me""."
Radiology,2sy9j8,MalcontentUK,2,Mon Jan 26 17:44:31 2015 UTC,"You're completely right, of course.   I'm not an apologist for how this ""order"" was written, as it's not self evident without a doc-to-doc call with the radiologist (and if he/she had done this, there would be no need for the confusing Rx).  The correct way to handle this was to call the radiologist or send the patient to me, in the ER (where I would probably make this call).   I was only trying to make the point that maybe the doc did know what he wanted. The way in which he ordered the exam was pretty suboptimal, though."
Radiology,2sy9j8,count_zero11,1 point,Tue Jan 27 02:24:35 2015 UTC,Yeah that's fair enough - I see what you mean. But that's exactly why these kinds of request do scare me - they are open to interpretation which is not good. Harm could come to the patient as a result.  Here we don't have any formal training in how to make clear requests (it's usually just learning the good and bad habits of your seniors as you're training) but I think it's a much overlooked and critical communication skill. I don't know what its like in the North America but requesting tests here is also delegated to the most junior doctor on the team which just compounds the problem.
Radiology,2sy9j8,MalcontentUK,10,Tue Jan 27 13:34:18 2015 UTC,"We have an office locally that has pre-printed on their order sheets ""Correlative xrays as needed for bone scans"". Like I can take that as an order for any kind of xray I want. They get so pissed when I call them and ask to send an order for a specific part after showing the bone scan to the rad. It kind of makes my day to hear the irritation in their voice."
Radiology,2sy9j8,dianarchy,11,Mon Jan 19 21:26:05 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with letting rads decide IMHO
Radiology,2sy9j8,SamLangford,10,Mon Jan 19 20:12:56 2015 UTC,"In that sense I agree, but sadly scripts and exams don't work out that way in the U.S. I would love to pick up the phone and just ask the rad to protocol this, but the response will just be to contact the referrer. I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that although our system is locked to scan what is ordered, we have physicians and practitioners with not a single clue of what exam is best for their patient."
Radiology,2sy9j8,SamLangford,3,Mon Jan 19 20:24:25 2015 UTC,"Such an accusatory tone. You can't expect a general practitioner to know everything about radiology, that's why there is a 5 year residency to become a radiologist. Maybe this person trained in a system where the radiologists got the consult and decided the appropriate exam."
Radiology,2sy9j8,vaporking23,6,Tue Jan 20 00:14:16 2015 UTC,"You are correct about the accusatory tone, however, I am directing it towards the system and not the referrers. Yes, radiologists have the training and education to make these decisions, but the U.S. healthcare system makes everyone so afraid of liability that rads don't even want to offer up an opinion."
Radiology,2sy9j8,laundryman2,3,Tue Jan 20 00:24:47 2015 UTC,Ok well thanks for the explanation. I can see your point for sure.
Radiology,2sy9j8,laundryman2,1 point,Tue Jan 20 00:26:43 2015 UTC,If the ordering physician doesn't know if he wasn't an MRI or CT then I don't think he should be a doctor. There's a difference between not know exactly what MRI protocol to order verses not knowing if they want an MRI or CT.   It's like a doctor ordering a 2 view lumbar spine but really protocol should be 5 views. The doctor still knows he wants X-rays.
Radiology,2sy9j8,tasty_beverage,-1,Tue Jan 20 00:31:20 2015 UTC,"As said above a primary care doctor may not know what is best. If this were a neurologist, then I can maybe see your point. Your radiologist should have no problem deciding. This is laziness on the radiologist and tech's part."

Radiology,2sz4e0,TokenGestures,1 point,Tue Jan 20 10:14:07 2015 UTC,"Teaching and patient education are probably the best uses right now.  I feel like patients would respond better to something they can see in front of them.  But there's that inherent cost factor.  There are some amazing ones from the NIH.  A full size human skeleton if you have the patience to break it up and print it a fraction at a time (that is if you don't have a massive half-room $150k SLA printer).  You have to make an account but most if not all of the models are free to download.  They even have cool ones that are models of viruses and smaller molecules like caffeine.  I think you have to make a free account to access it, but its not a hassle.  http://3dprint.nih.gov/discover .  EDIT:  I also feel like there are some cool applications for surgical planning and general round-table discussion if you don't have a desktop at hand with access to the model.  You're right though, and I think this has been said several times in this thread... the applications just seem kind of silly when you can throw up the 3D model on your computer screen to plan from.  HOWEVER!  There is a study out there:  I'm tired and will look it up another time, maybe PM it to you, that says that residents with interactions with BOTH 3D virtual AND printed models actually performed better in their surgical tasks compared to those who only had the virtual computer model."
Radiology,2sz4e0,Yellowbenzene,3,Tue Jan 20 12:23:02 2015 UTC,"I've been doing this for a couple of years. To be honest, interest was high when it was new and lots of people requested models. However interest has dropped as people begin to realise it's mainly clinically useless and just a bit gimicky. The people who find it most useful are orthos using models to explain complex spinal problems to patients.  The problem is that it's not any better than creating a virtual 3D model, which is cheaper and easier to share."

While some fibers of the diaphragm do attach to the xiphoid process, as most of the fibers attach to the ribs and elsewhere, the overall integrity of the diaphragm should be maintained.  Furthermore, weakness of the diaphragm shouldn't affect the lower esophageal sphincter. The diaphragm does not assist the sphincter in functioning properly."
Radiology,2svze7,azulsquall,2,Mon Jan 19 02:55:54 2015 UTC,"Although I generally agree, the functioning of the LES may have just as much to do with the incidence of hiatal hernia as diaphragmatic integrity."
Radiology,2suf0k,Lodi0831,6,Sun Jan 18 17:26:23 2015 UTC,"Power Doppler only looks for presence of flow in a vessel. It's independent of angle and velocity. So no you shouldn't use Power to measure velocity.   Now if you wanted to identify where the vessel was if you're having a hard time seeing it, you could use POWER to identify it, and then turn it off and turn on pulsed wave to actually measure the vessel with the appropriate angle that would be OK."
Radiology,2suf0k,sutherbb36,5,Sun Jan 18 18:35:04 2015 UTC,"Can you not use both at once and get the same result? Or does the presence of power skew the pulsed?   They like us to use color while doing spectral, but if you can't get the color with normal color Doppler, then power is the only other option.   I just thought the two were independent of one another and the presence of one wouldn't effect the other.   Paging Sidney Edelman!"
Radiology,2suf0k,NoSubrannke,4,Sun Jan 18 19:45:35 2015 UTC,"Another ultrasound tech here.  Using power Doppler isn't going to effect your Pulse Wave signal, but it may be more confusing for the reading radiologist to determine which way flow is moving while pulsing.    Technically, you're going to be having your box steered with the direction of the vessel, and if you're using a newer machine your angle should be at 60 degrees, which won't change whether you're using Power or Color Doppler, and you'll just adjust your spectral analysis until it's above baseline, so it really shouldn't make a difference, but the pictures may be more confusing to read, perhaps.  So no, your pulse wave signal wouldn't be ""compromised"" per se, if you're using Power Doppler with it.  Your radiologist may be slightly confused though.  I would stick to taking pictures that are easy for your radiologist to read and interpret, whomever it may be."

As mentioned above, you need to educate them beforehand:  ""Don't breathe in, don't breathe out, just stop where you are.  It'll be less than 10 seconds."""
Radiology,2sm6s7,adifferentjk,3,Fri Jan 16 19:42:35 2015 UTC,"I would only turn off the breathing instructions for completely uncooperative patients. You know the type, will move whenever they want and hold their breath whenever they want. This is to avoid the off chance of them hearing the voice and randomly holding their breath at the wrong time.  In your average patients, pre-exam education is always best. Instruct on how to proceed with the breath hold, and why it's such an important factor in acquiring a good exam. Once you mention that this little detail could potentially degrade the quality of their exam, they usually follow the instructions very closely."
Radiology,2sm6s7,shadowa4,2,Fri Jan 16 14:11:20 2015 UTC,Depends on what the instructions are. Should be breathe in breathe out a few times then stop breathing.   Not take a breath and hold it.   You need to explain that to every patient before you scan them.
Radiology,2sm6s7,anaerobyte,2,Fri Jan 16 20:22:20 2015 UTC,"Not a radiologist but one of them told me this : Looking for an embolism can sometimes mean the patient is already in respiratory distress. If you ask them to breath very gently they will be more comfortable and co operative.

If they can hold their breath they should, but if they cough in the middle of the scan you have to start again."

It basically boils down to the machine and what physicist you can get involved in your project. In our setting we have better imaging from a 1,5T machine and we have done diffusion on two cases with an spinal chord infarct (arteria spinalis anterior) evident on one of those cases.   Have you checked any articles?  the first hit i got might be what you need.

Radiology,2sjae5,hfrrfrr,2,Thu Jan 15 19:02:46 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest question is how much diffusion do you expect in a cadaver? Nearly every scanner in use these days can do DTI. Since you don't have to worry about SAR or motion, you should be able to achieve really great SNR. It might work. Post processing won't be straightforward at all though as all tools assume brain images."
Radiology,2sjae5,meatyanddelicious,1 point,Fri Jan 16 22:12:34 2015 UTC,Can you? Yes  Should you? Probably not worth it. You don't get the same resolution as there is higher signal-to-noise ratio and the images are more subject to distortion.
Radiology,2sjae5,lyelum,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:40:22 2015 UTC,"It's certainly not going to work in a cadaver... Dead nerves don't have much diffusion. But in general, you could do neurography, which basically relies on very heavy T2 weighting and diffusion imaging. But as others remarked, it won't be pretty in the lumbar region. DWI is extremely susceptible to motion."

Radiology,2sa0sd,TooTallToBeAdwarf,2,Tue Jan 13 22:38:11 2015 UTC,"Hi!  I studied/work(ed) in southern Ontario as well. I agree that the market right now is extremely hard at best. I myself have moved to BC for employment (on a contract) and am back in Ontario, only to move back out to BC. I have had 3 jobs at one time in order to 'make ends meet', two casual and one part time. This resulted in some weeks working 60+ hours in the summer and winter time just one or two shifts in a week. Its not an easy life style.  A huge hurdle that I have tried to overcome is unionization. Where ever there is a union, there is nothing more then casual. Its in places that are NOT unionized that you will at least have a chance of securing a part time job.  Australia needs two years of experience before writing their entrance exam. As mentioned by u/saiyanslayerz, out of province would be the fastest way to secure full time employment.  My advice if your staying here? Get your hand in as many pockets as you can. Create a great resume with all the keywords (because a computer will look at your resume first), at the interview tell them your ready to work whatever hours they will throw at you, and most importantly, be upfront and tell them you will be look for other casual work. It makes you look motivated and 'in demand'.   Best of luck finishing clinical! PM me if you like. Sorry about the long post.  TL/DR: lifes hard for southern Ontario MRT(R), be prepared to have multiple jobs or be prepared to move out of province for work experience."

Radiology,2rz4ax,Im_That_Guy21,8,Sat Jan 10 17:05:12 2015 UTC,"A lot of imaging physics is about pushing the envelope just a little bit further than someone else already has. I don't think you should be coming into the field thinking you're going to do something ground breaking right off the bat. It's a slow methodical process of tweaking algorithms, adjusting scan parameters etc.  That said MR and PET I think are the two modalities currently seeing the biggest leaps forward, especially as the focus is on functional imaging. New nuclear tracers are also seeing some increasingly promising results. I have also seen really interesting things with ultrasound, like shear wave elastography and HIFU, which actually may be the most valuable in terms of volume of patients the modality will reach.  As far as I can see, with CT it's just a question of reducing dose and scan time rather than improving an images worth, and I'm not sure it's the most interesting modality in research terms, unless you're interested in developing CAD for diagnosis."
Radiology,2rz4ax,elivs,1 point,Sat Jan 10 17:35:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think you should be coming into the field thinking you're going to do something ground breaking right off the bat.   I definitely agree, and I didn't mean to come off as unrealistic in my research goals. Do you think it is over-optimistic to hope for a single thesis to have clinical impact (even a very small one)?   MR and PET I think are the two modalities currently seeing the biggest leaps forward, especially as the focus is on functional imaging   This is what I was thinking as well. I may have an opportunity to research PET/MR, and I was thinking of looking at staging/monitoring lymphomas (if PET/MR can be shown to have comparable sensitivity/specificity to the conventional CT or PET/CT, I think it would be the preferred modality for lymphomas because of the lower dose, since these cases already have a relatively high rate of relapse).   Most recent publications I have seen comment on a need for more research in the feasibility of PET/MR for lymphomas, which I would be more than happy to partake in! However, it seems that a lot of physics research never sees the light of day in favour of conventional practice, which I am aiming to avoid. Do you think advances in MR, PET, or PET/MR will be valuable and easily integrated into current clinical practice?   I have also seen really interesting things with ultrasound, like shear wave elastography and HIFU, which actually may be the most valuable in terms of volume of patients the modality will reach.   Interesting! At the end of the day the goal should be to help as many people as possible (it's very easy to lose the forest for the trees in a research environment, where I never interact with a patient). I will look into this, are there any specific groups or publications you had in mind?   with CT it's just a question of reducing dose and scan time rather than improving an images worth, and I'm not sure it's the most interesting modality in research terms   It seems with CT most of the future work is in hardware or reconstruction improvements. Successful projects would definitely improve CT imaging in general, but that doesn't address clinical applicability (still a consideration, just not in the context of this post). So is it correct to say you do not recommend CT if clinical use is the goal?  Thanks very much for the answer!"

Radiology,2rptql,hamburger_hero,4,Thu Jan 8 05:56:50 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what you mean. Cr is very forgiving if you over expose, but under exposure can't be fixed.   You need to add 10 kvp to your large body parts at least and 2 steps in ma. If you have AEC bump it up more and turn the chambers on. In the grand scheme of things it is better to expose higher once and get a diagnostic image than to under expose and have to repeat. Keep a log of your s numbers (your system should give you a readout of how appropriate the exposure was). You can use these to adjust your standard exposure."
Radiology,2rptql,burstabcess,3,Thu Jan 8 21:44:41 2015 UTC,"They ought to have a technique chart for the machinery you are working with. As they haven't provided you one, I'd politely request that you could have a technician or the physicist come in to check the equipment and help you establish a baseline chart. Overall your techniques seem OKish but every machine shoots a bit different. There's nothing wrong with making a request like that.. It's possible the machine needs calibration too and a technician should come check it out anyway.   EDIT: Might even be that the IRs you have are old and need replacing"

Radiology,2rptql,2defmouze,2,Thu Jan 8 17:04:58 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean.. each room should have a technique chart posted at or near your workstation with your baseline techniques, though. If it isn't the calibration or the quality of the imaging plates you've got, you still have a right and a responsibility (as does your boss) to have a technician or physicist test the machine to come up and provide you with a technique chart, in addition to the semi-annual testing it should be going under anyway.  Explain that to your boss that you want to provide quality images but you are having difficulty with the machine and need a proper technique chart; additionally I would see if you could contact the prior tech and see if he/she can offer some guidance since he was able to obtain quality images with the same machine/setup.  Until those happen there is only so much you can do.. but experiment with the physics principals. While I think your techniques above seem a bit high on the mAs side from what I am used to, if your images are too light, grainy and lacking detail that pretty much all screams you need more mAs so try cranking it up more than you are used to, maybe between 10-20% even depending on the patient and case, obviously."

Radiology,2rptql,TopicsInRadiography,1 point,Thu Jan 15 19:57:56 2015 UTC,"Mottle/graininess of your images indicates underexposure. Your kVp ranges look good - consider doubling your mAs values.  It seems like you might be using a very old, lower-power generator, so the mAs values required might be higher than machines manufactured in the last 10 years.  If your images are coming out light, but not mottled/grainy, you may be using too much exposure.  Remember, CR processing algorithms will make exposures lighter when overexposed to attempt to display the appropriate brightness at the QC station.  Extreme overexposure will cause the image to be lighter and lighter.  What kind of exposure indicator system are you using?  I can provide some ranges of appropriate exposures for you depending on what you're using (EI, REX, S#, LgM, etc.)."

I tried contacting the old tech but he hasn't responded, and I get the feeling he's not going to.  I also tried asking the doctor if they could get someone to come check the machine and help me make a technique chart, but he told me that the last tech got good images and that I need to just change my technique until I find what works.  Like I said, I've only worked with film professionally, so if upping my mAs and kV isn't getting me a diagnostic Mage, I'm at a loss.  I read that mAs should be absurdly low at times, and that kV affects the brightness on the monitor, but I'm still having trouble."

Radiology,2rdcx4,Roman736,3,Mon Jan 5 22:38:09 2015 UTC,I wanted to update everyone. I have since talked to the Urgent Care doctor who told me I had a mass. She said she personally went over the radiograph with her Radiologist and he too confirmed that the X-ray looked normal. At most an enlarged Pulmonary Artery.   This whole situation has been very stressful. My wife and I were almost in tears at the prospect of me having cancer. Needless to say I do not think I will ever go back to that Urgent Care facility again.   The doctor suggested I get another radiograph done in 3-6 months to make sure that all is the same.   Thank you all for your replies.
Radiology,2rdcx4,Roman736,2,Mon Jan 5 19:41:53 2015 UTC,"Poor girl was worried about you and and unsure so went with the safest possible choice. Sounds like she should have expressed that uncertainty of hers more clearly in an open and honest manner. She was probably thinkin about your case all day and hence spoke to a radiologist to not only provide the answer but hopefully talk to her about it so she doesnt make this mistake again. I feel in similar situations as her a lot lately because I'm working the first job as a hospital doctor and hold somewhat relatively radical cynicism of medical care in the US and value someone's personal choice to not choose the safest rout of care, and take the riskier discharge home if one chooses. It's ez to cover your ass and do everything, my integrity admits to my responsibility and trust their personal judgments. Sometime's I just want to cut to the chase, ""look, do you wanna go upstairs for lots of experiments on you and a 5 digit bill, or do you wanna just take the <5% chance something going on and just get back here if it gets worse?"" Or, ""you passed out... we can get everyone to see you, a specialist who feels the privilege to order MRI's on everyone they see, heart tests, and make sure you didn't have an odd silent heart attack at the age of 42... for $20,000 bill... or you wanna just go home and if it happens again come back and then search for something you probably don't have.""   EDIT: Just one other point I thought was worth mentioning was that the girl was thrown off by a definite 'abnormality' amongst typical Xrays she sees on a daily basis. It's that the image is one so healthy. Please correct me if I'm wrong, radiologists, but to me this somewhat subjectively screams super young and healthy. In sick and older people those side ""wings"" and the ""mass"" are branch points of huge vessels and central lymph nodes, same as you, but more hazy and not well shaped. You, on the other hand, have healthy enough lungs, or maybe the tech took a good pic, that those big heart vessels look unusually well contoured compared to most others and falsely raised the concern that you got a round circular mass close to ur heart. This phenomenon that super young people can have scary looking tests is also seen on ECG heart rhythm strips, which I'm sure you had. Everyone has to experience a moment of worry and uncertainty why so unexpected, but hopefully it's on there own or with a colleague, and doesn't happen again (or a couple times but with more scrutiny when it does). Where she really screwed up was saying any word about a bad disease instead of playing it cool like it's nothing or not mention at all but saying she will call with the definite read once its read by the real pro, and if she were ballsy she would say we'll call you if its abnormal. Though fine ethical lines here. Ignorance is bliss vs openly share your opinion, as well as you can, but risk what happened to you... all this worry. I prefer the ladder (cause I talk kinda like I write, candidly and sincerely) but almost everyone else does the former. Maybe that's why I'm sorry for her embarrassment and insecurities after this only-human blip that spiraled a bit out of control."

I am always very candid with healthcare workers and had already studied up on anything that may have caused the pain in my chest. I am assuming that because I was able talk to her in an intelligent manner she felt it necessary to raise any concern. She was very helpful. Although, in light of the whole situation, I believe it would have been more prudent to wait until she had spoken with a radiologist before informing me of any abnormalities. I still hold no ill will towards the doctor.   Just FYI I am only 27 years old. My only health issues are possible high blood pressure and that may mostly be linked to my smoking habit.

Dunno if that makes any sense.    Isn't that slightly incorrect?  Under the constraint that we don't need more than 1 circle of measurements (actually 180° is enough, we don't need 360°) the mapping of time t to angle w is a bijective function w = f(t) (if we know the time we know the angle), thus if we say that the image-axes are time and angle we basically say it's time (which would be wrong).   The image is a sinogram in the parameter domain (of the radon transform) and the radon transform is (iirc) defined as angle and distance to origin (position)?"
Radiology,2r9ib3,flippant_gibberish,1 point,Thu Jan 8 20:07:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah time and angle are the same, so y can be either time or angle, you can't really tell without units but I guess angle makes more sense.

Going the full 360 can actually give you more information than 180 if you have a fan or cone beam instead of parallel.  http://d32ogoqmya1dw8.cloudfront.net/images/research_education/geochemsheets/techniques/_1172960774.png"

I somehow read it as ""x-axis (from left to right) is the angle"".   It all makes sense now :) Sorry for failing at reading.   Looking at the image I have a question, since I only have a CS degree (and I only know the acquisition of CT data basics). It seems to be taken from a geochemistry site, thus radiation exposure isn't a problem: Is a 360° scan used often?   It also seems to imply a static electron beam source (EBT), which I learned was only being used in research not in (in the field) medical imaging (gantry with moving source/detectors was mentioned there) Am I outdated (quite possible)?"
Radiology,2r9ib3,flippant_gibberish,1 point,Thu Jan 8 21:18:34 2015 UTC,"I am by no means an expert in the field myself so don't worry. I was trying to illustrate the types of beam shape, so you're right that the subject is usually stationary. That's the danger of using Google images for visual aids."
Radiology,2r9ib3,SoObtuse,1 point,Fri Jan 9 00:32:41 2015 UTC,"360 degree scans are used in the sense that the xray tube fully rotates around the patient as it emits radiation. The dose isn't necessarily to the full 360 in helical scans, however (dependent on pitch and slice thickness)"
Radiology,2r9ib3,Riccars,5,Sun Jan 11 19:23:30 2015 UTC,http://xkcd.com/radiation/ I didn't see anything on this chart that's exactly 20 mSv but it should give you some scale.
Radiology,2r9ib3,NateNizzle,3,Sun Jan 4 05:40:06 2015 UTC,"We had a chart, sort of, in our core area from Toshiba with a simplified breakdown of radiation as contrasted with normal background radiation(NBR) everyone receives from living on this planet.  It went something like this:  2 view CXR is 3-4 days NBR, Hand/Foot XR is less than a day, Abdomen-Pelvis CT is approx 4-6 months NBR.  That's all I can remember.  I do know head CTs get quite a bit because of the skull bones and needing the mA to get a nice picture."
Radiology,2r9ib3,garion046,2,Sun Jan 4 04:56:56 2015 UTC,That seems very low for an Abdo-Pelvis CT. 6 months is only a couple of mSv at most. Obviously it's patient and exam (phases etc) dependent but most sources I've seen for Abdo-Pelvis say 10mSv+. Head CTs would be more likely in the range of 6 months NBR I think.
Radiology,2r9ib3,NateNizzle,2,Sun Jan 4 09:55:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, patient size dictates dose.  I was going off memory, it could have been an Abdomen CT not an A/P."
Radiology,2r9ib3,Roentgenator,2,Sun Jan 4 14:34:02 2015 UTC,This is easily understandable information about comparative dose.
Radiology,2r9ib3,Yellowbenzene,1 point,Sun Jan 4 05:46:33 2015 UTC,"A CT head is about 2mSv.  Might be more if they did a post-contrast scan, perfusion scan etc."
Radiology,2r9ib3,Micah1217,1 point,Sun Jan 4 10:12:12 2015 UTC,For a typical head ct at 5mm intervals it's about 30 images in the axial plain per window... of reconstructed images.

Radiology,2r8hhv,bone577,3,Sun Jan 4 14:46:11 2015 UTC,"Thought I'd chime in just in case anyone was curious. The job market in Australia for radiologists is pretty exceptional from my experience. Base salaries start at about $400,000 a year even without full Australian/New Zealand fellowship. A doctor with full fellowship can expect $500,000 with 17% share of gross radiology billings. That's with 6 weeks of holiday leave, 2 weeks of sick leave and 2 weeks of conference leave. It seems like interventional skills are quite in demand as well.  What's the US market like out of interest?"

Radiology,2r4z0b,drsilentg,3,Sat Jan 3 16:12:36 2015 UTC,OK I will put my long answer. Insurance is cutting what they give hospitals so hospitals are cutting staff. Working in Xray in a hospital is not going to be fun anytime in the near future unless you get very lucky at an urgent care or outpatient center. Under staffing is a big issue
Radiology,2r4z0b,meb9000,4,Sat Jan 3 16:36:40 2015 UTC,"The prevailing methods of xray format are Computed Radiography and Direct Digital Radiography. Both use essentially electronic formats, but direct digital can process and ""beam"" images straight to the computer in a matter of seconds.  The xray cassette can be placed directly under the extremity in question in the case of a hand, foot, leg, etc. But for spinal column, knee, and all torso xray projections, a Bucky tray is used that is mounted behind the upright board or underneath the xray table. These Bucky trays are equipped with a lead grid that absorbs excess scatter radiation to clean up the final image. Hope this helps!"

Radiology,2r4z0b,Baial,1 point,Sat Jan 3 06:48:10 2015 UTC,"Correct. We had phantom body parts with artificial bone skeletons inside, and we would take x-rays with proper positioning and x-ray technique. These images would be graded and must meet the appropriate standards."
Radiology,2qzzie,Cadillakakak,5,Thu Jan 1 10:28:30 2015 UTC,"My site has two 16 slice GE Lightspeeds, a toshiba aquilion64 and a Phillips 64 slice and I would prefer to scan on the Toshiba over any of the others. It doesn't have double slice though, so I can't lend any information on that feature. In our really dose conscious system our toshiba tends to want to use way more mA even with dose modulation and good centering than the Phillips, which is the only thing I don't like about it. Apps and our protocol guru are always trying to figure out how to get it to lower the dose automatically without too much reduction in image quality and as a tech I have to check the dose and manually set a lower DM threshold quite a lot. I don't know if that's unique to my scanner or if it's a toshiba thing, though."
Radiology,2qzzie,corellianblue,3,Thu Jan 1 15:05:00 2015 UTC,What is meant by double slice may I ask?
Radiology,2qzzie,TardisTechnologist,6,Fri Jan 2 00:50:42 2015 UTC,"http://www.toshibamedicalsystems.com/tmd/english/products/ct/aquilioncxl_function.html  Doubles the acquired slices per rotation. To be honest, I don't understand how it works without reducing detector size. They also claim they do it without increasing dose."
Radiology,2qzzie,shadowa4,2,Fri Jan 2 01:23:50 2015 UTC,"I can understand your boss' preference for Toshiba. Now, I don't know if that interest comes from financial incentives or actual interest in features. Personally, I've worked with Toshibas and love almost every aspect of them. The tech UI is pretty straight forward, and there are little features here and there to make your job easier.   Regarding double slice, I've read Toshiba's info before and understand it to be a modified/improved method of image generation. In very simple terms, they've modified the way detectors receive data and also changed/added some steps to the raw data to image data conversion process. It seems like a genuinely innovative method of dose reduction and improved image quality. If I understand correctly, it's applicable to any scan type, not just HR exams like IAC/ Sinuses. However, it may not be efficient to employ this method of image construction to every protocol. Added software/recon requirements like double slice can result in delayed image recon time, thus slowing exam completion times if used all the time."
Radiology,2qzzie,ooojerry,2,Fri Jan 2 04:34:55 2015 UTC,"So the scanner acquires, say, .5s. Then in post processing the computer interpolates a fabricated .25 from data from one .5 and an adjacent .5? .5 is already so fine that I dont see added value yet, especially since the .25mm isn't a true acquired image. I dont see how the machine can reconstruct a smaller slice from a single larger slice.   We won't attract new specialty exams with the promise of .25 slices so there would be no added departmental income. There have been no complaints from our Rads about lack of spacial resolution in high res exams.   Im really looking for any tech who has first hand experience or anyone with a protocol that really shines because of Double Slice. I'm really trying to present both sides of the scales to my boss."
Radiology,2qzzie,shadowa4,2,Fri Jan 2 07:23:55 2015 UTC,"Not an RT, but my facility has a Toshiba One Aquillion (320 detector row (up to 640 slices)).  Our interest in the slice interpolation is in using dynamic volume imaging quantitatively (trying to use CT for myocardial perfusion and cerebral perfusion).  The most useful part of this feature is the supposedly more accurate quantification of structure sizes.  ie. A vessel with 0.5mm diameter can occupy anywhere between 1 and 4 voxels.  The interpolation helps to more ""accurately"" place the vessel in the voxel space.  cCTA for example tends to underestimate vessel diameter due to the partial volume effect (why double slices could be useful).  I could possibly share a volume or two with you.  By default we use 320, but I can do a 640 recon.  Only downside is I am out of town until next Monday, when I would have time to access the scanner."
Radiology,2qzzie,anaerobyte,1 point,Mon Jan 5 04:17:22 2015 UTC,It would be nice if you could upload some files to MedXT whenever you get a chance! I've been interested in the Aquillion One ever since it was put on the market a few years ago.
Radiology,2qzzie,cleonm,3,Mon Jan 5 14:23:15 2015 UTC,Not a fan of the images personally. I prefer GE. If it is the only scanner people will get used to it.

Radiology,2qeu86,btmalon,3,Fri Dec 26 03:19:50 2014 UTC,"It is not slowly dying out. PET is rapidly growing with a wide range of new tracers (e.g. PSMA, DOTATATE) becoming widespread.  V/Q scans are in no way as broadly used as they were before, and with the newer dual-energy CT units being able to do lower energy CTPA they will become even less so, but that is only a small part of their work.

Radiology,2qeu86,friendtyou,1 point,Fri Dec 26 04:06:34 2014 UTC,"I do not have a rad tech degree, just a bachelors in nuc med. I have my RT(N) and my CNMT which dual certifies me in nuc med only. When I graduated, it took me 10 months to find a job and I consider myself lucky that I found a job where I did not have to move, cause I applied nearly EVERYWHERE. I love nuc med and don't regret not having an RT(R) because my life situation didn't really allow for the extra schooling. I will say though, that I regularly perform SPECT/CT, PET/CT, and PET/CT/MR so having secondary certifications in CT and/or MR makes you look better, but is not required. Those secondary certs are easier to get as a rad tech than a nuc med tech depending on your state's regulations.   Long story long, you can go straight nuc med, but the market is harder to jump into. To be fair though, even if you were a rad tech trying to get into nuclear, it would still be hard, you would just be getting paid for being a rad tech if you had a job while also paying for the school loans you took out to be a rad tech. To me, being a rad tech does not give you an advantage in nuclear, because they are a ton different from each other and the pay scales are on the opposite sides of the radiology spectrum so I don't see anyone paying you to do both."

It never hurts to broaden my resume and add another cert to my name, I plan on staying within the network of hospitals that I work for as long as I possibly can in my career. Some of the nuc med techs are aging and some are bound to retire soon, which means I'd have the first opportunity for employment if a spot opened up.

Radiology,2q37sa,ondavid,2,Tue Dec 23 01:28:57 2014 UTC,"I'm no ER doctor...but you can even see the bulge in the soft tissue. I'm palpating my talus right now, and there's definitely a lot of squish in between it and my thumb.  There doesn't look to be a lot of room between his skin and the talus."
Radiology,2q37sa,mamacat49,3,Mon Dec 22 23:22:49 2014 UTC,Yes it was very obvious just looking at his foot that there was something more than a sprain.
Radiology,2q37sa,m0rpheuz,3,Tue Dec 23 01:30:30 2014 UTC,That looks REALLY hard to do.  Any background on how the injury happened?
Radiology,2q1cx6,tiddie_sprinkle88,10,Mon Dec 22 04:19:55 2014 UTC,Or it's a flexion view.
Radiology,2q1cx6,yermahm,2,Mon Dec 22 04:50:14 2014 UTC,"I asked her that, they didn't do flexing or extension view"
Radiology,2q1cx6,vnarsenal,4,Mon Dec 22 04:56:00 2014 UTC,Why were xrays taken of her Cx spine? Does she have any pain?
Radiology,2q1cx6,vnarsenal,1 point,Mon Dec 22 05:21:18 2014 UTC,"One of my buddies had severe neck pain and ""clicking"" and ""crunching"" - finally got xrays taken and she had no curve to her neck either. I can't recall much beyond that, haven't talked to her since she had imaging done."
Radiology,2q1cx6,ondavid,1 point,Mon Dec 22 07:25:31 2014 UTC,Loss of the cervical lordosis (or straightening of the cervical spine) can cause pain. Anterior head carriage can play a big part in changes to the curve.
Radiology,2q1cx6,subintimal,4,Mon Dec 22 08:06:19 2014 UTC,"Other way around. Pain can cause loss of lordosis, as people naturally find a more comfortable position to hold. It's not the spine that's the problem, it's the muscles around it."

Radiology,2q1cx6,vanilla44028,-2,Thu Dec 25 03:22:04 2014 UTC,Yea I guess her neck hurts. It's a chiro
Radiology,2q1cx6,hughthewineguy,12,Mon Dec 22 14:50:43 2014 UTC,See it all the time. Probably how she is bending her neck. I wouldn't worry about it.
Radiology,2q1cx6,Kibibitz,3,Mon Dec 22 04:46:53 2014 UTC,"We are specifically taught to not comment on reversal of the cervical lordosis, because it's bullshit, and essentially a normal variant. You can bury it in the findings if you want, but I would never put it in the impression. Almost always due to positioning, technique, etc. If you want to believe a chiropractor, that's on you."
Radiology,2q1cx6,Kibibitz,1 point,Mon Dec 29 12:46:23 2014 UTC,Completely agree. It's impossible for me to determine the cause in a static image. Likely positional.
Radiology,2q1cx6,hughthewineguy,15,Sun Jan 18 01:51:18 2015 UTC,Did a chiropractor tell you that?
Radiology,2q1cx6,uhmatomy,-24,Mon Dec 22 08:16:27 2014 UTC,interesting comment.  do you say that because a radiologist wouldn't have spotted it?
Radiology,2q1cx6,Kibibitz,14,Mon Dec 22 09:16:14 2014 UTC,"I say it because it sounds like bollocks.   Next you'll be saying there's an obvious subluxation!!  Of course radiologists would spot this (we have WAY more experience than chiros!!) but we wouldn't care about it, it's such a common finding and doesn't imply anything other than a) poor x-ray technique, b) poor posture (innate or acquired due to muscular pain). What we care about is REAL pathology like fractures, dislocations, arthritis, congenital anomalies.  EDIT: Would YOU spot a retro pharyngeal abscess on a lateral C-spine? Eagle syndrome? Cleidocranial dysostosis?   If the answer is no, then you have no business pretending to read x-rays."
Radiology,2q1cx6,uhmatomy,1 point,Mon Dec 22 10:52:15 2014 UTC,"What are your opinions on DACBRs? That is who I refer to and he does a good job.

Radiology,2q1cx6,timisdaman,5,Mon Dec 22 21:55:16 2014 UTC,"Oh my apologies.  Here in The States, a DACBR is another title (like MD, DC, DO, etc) that would be best described as a chiropractic radiologist. I believe, at least here, it is another 4 or so years beyond the chiropractic education. The standard chiropractic education is minimum 3 years undergrad (90 hours) followed by the 4 years doctorate program. I am not a DACBR myself, but I don't think you can take the DACBR program concurrently. The DACBR program goes beyond the standard radiology education in DC school.  I also am not sure how chiropractic is regulated in the UK. Are chiropractors able to take X-rays in your country? Is radiology part of their education? Thanks in advance for any information. I am always interested in different health care cultures."
Radiology,2q1cx6,uhmatomy,4,Mon Dec 22 22:00:09 2014 UTC,"Thankfully in the UK these don't exist, and the NHS doesn't recognise chiropractic and doesn't fund it."
Radiology,2q1cx6,timisdaman,-4,Mon Dec 22 22:43:33 2014 UTC,"I say it because it sounds like bollocks.   that's interesting, because it looks like it's pretty plain to see on the fil there.  now, the way i was taught to write reports was to comment on  Alignment  Bones  Cartilage  Soft tissue  pretty basic. but a loss of cervical lordosis and anterior head carriage are definitely things worth putting on there, right?   Of course radiologists would spot this (we have WAY more experience than chiros!!)   yet i read reports every month where no mention is made of postural changes like we see on this film, written by radiologists   What we care about is REAL pathology like fractures, dislocations, arthritis, congenital anomalies.   yeah, cool, what do you think the patient cares about? if there's findings that could relate to their pain complaint (cos let's be real, in the grand scheme of all xrays taken, the vast majority are to rule things out and show very little in terms of ""REAL pathology"") then it's worth making comment; not everyone who reads reports can read film, and your average GP isn't going to explore postural distortions as a factor in chronic pain unless they're on the report they're reading   Would YOU spot a retro pharyngeal abscess on a lateral C-spine? Eagle syndrome? Cleidocranial dysostosis?   well, i'm not in the habit of reading xrays that have not already been read by a radiologist, but i do look at an awful lot of films, and yes i have spotted things that have been missed. mostly that's fractures, and i can't understand how they weren't picked up, but i guess there are advantages to actually putting your hands on the patient, feeling what's going on, and correlating that to xray and other findings.  would i spot a retropharyngeal abcess? certainly. Eagle syndrome, i hadn;t heard of until right now, so probably not, but while looking at the film i would definitely think something was up if i saw a great big styloid process, and send it back to the radiologist to query what's going on if it wasn't on the report. Cleidocranial dysostosis? yeah, i'd pick that up. i look at enough non-pathological films to know when something's not cool.   i freely admit that i might not know the name of it immediately, but i'd know where to look and who to ask.   Next you'll be saying there's an obvious subluxation!!   the whole ""bone out of alignment"" thing isn't really what subluxation is about. it's more about the function of the nervous system than about bony position. that's not something you'll find on xray.  it's quite obvious from this and from other comments, that you're not really open to this discussion, but subluxation isn't something you can see on film, there are other things to consider when it comes to subluxation. it is one part of the picture, there are others, and there are ways of determining it without films too."
Radiology,2q1cx6,uhmatomy,3,Mon Dec 22 18:13:58 2014 UTC,Can you please elaborate on your version/ definition of subluxation vs alignment. I'm interested to understand the Chiro reasoning
Radiology,2q1cx6,timisdaman,-1,Mon Dec 22 22:26:40 2014 UTC,"Alignment be different lines like George's Line, Lumbosacral angle, Cobb, etc. that you can measure. You could possibly include A and R of PARTS in there too, but that would be a bit more of a stretch if you are mainly concerned with radiological findings.  Subluxation would refer to the results of nerve compression (neurologic response, muscle spasm/guarding, inflammation. It is not that the joint is necessarily subluxated like a dislocation, but it is the compression on the nerve fibers--a good example would be carpal tunnel or sciatica. Honestly the term subluxation is kind of a misnomer, but in the chiropractic profession you can say that term and we get what it means. I mainly use the term ""misalignment"" or ""restriction"" and that is a more accurate concept.  Does that help with an explanation?"
Radiology,2q1cx6,uhmatomy,8,Tue Dec 23 05:10:34 2014 UTC,"There is no need to take an x-ray to look for 'postural changes'. You can see a posture change clinically (and feel it with your hands on approach). X-raying everything to look for problems is the worst possible management in cases of non-specific pain.  Your profession is a sham.  You tell patients you can read x-rays, when you have nowhere near the training and expertise of radiologists. I even hear of chiropractors taking x-rays themselves, no trained technician on hand, no formal quality assessment or control. You should be embarrassed. You claim it's all pinched nerves and subluxations, when no such thing has been proven. If a patient really did have a pinched nerve, you wouldn't see it on x-ray (unless there was a clinical dislocation or abscess, in which case a REAL doctor should be looking at the patient).   I've had about enough of you and others coming into this forum and trying to be on par with us as professionals, when you are just mitigators of doubt and quackery, with little to no formal radiological training. What you do with x-rays should be illegal."
Radiology,2q1cx6,timisdaman,4,Mon Dec 22 18:21:44 2014 UTC,"Chiros always say stuff like that... even more commonly, they attribute all pain to the 'alignment' shown in their crappy X-rays.  My favourite to date is a patient of mine who came for a 2nd opinion (I'm a physio) as they were recommended nearly $8k of chiro over 12 months to correct a ""severe"" spinal malalignment.... Turns out that the patient just wasn't standing straight for the X-ray and they needed 2 physio treatments to sort some minor musculoskeletal back pain"
Radiology,2q1cx6,uhmatomy,4,Mon Dec 22 10:49:22 2014 UTC,Plus Chiros do not have to licensed Radiologic Technologists do the xrays... Which in turn gives alot of not so great positioning of the patients! Which can lead to misdiagnosis.

Radiology,2q1cx6,Yellowbenzene,1 point,Mon Dec 22 14:23:49 2014 UTC,"An X-ray is a single, static view. the image needs to be correlated clinically via objective examination to determine if this is what her neck looks like always, or was she just in an unusual posture without realising it, or positioned incorrectly by the tech.  To say that this single view means spasm is broad sweeping and incorrect based on the information at hand. And then you're gonna throw articles from 1994 and 2007 where they had additional information such as clinical exam and multiple imaging views... Really?"

Grob et al: Very low sample size, only a 12 month follow up (incidence of neck pain in 12 months is close to 25% in the general population depending on which literature you read- which means you'd be wanting at least a 2 yr follow up for this kind of study AND a much larger sample size), there was pretty poor blinding, standardisation of patient setup was meh, patients were even grouped into pain and no pain groups  Helliwell et al: 1994... come on, man! Once again, low sample size, no blinding, crappy standardisation, their control group was from films from 1958! In fact, they say ""Our results fail to support the hypothesis that loss of cervical lordosis reflects muscle spasm"" and appear to have had their patients have multiple views of the neck taken (referred by GP or ED for radiography so one can assume a full set of films, plus objective and clinical exam)"

Radiology,2prjzr,Its_apparent,3,Fri Dec 19 16:00:11 2014 UTC,"Did it hurt, initially?  Not the surgery site, but your spine?  I always wonder if your spine gets used to bad posture and that is the new ""home point"" or if it always feels better being aligned.  I know this is more than bad posture, obviously, but it probably has similar properties.  It has to be rough on the psoas muscles, etc."
Radiology,2prjzr,PigletChops,3,Fri Dec 19 16:15:54 2014 UTC,I'd never even considered the muscles myself since everything is always an x-ray with discussion focused on the bones. Does anyone know what happens to the shortened muscles during the operation? Are they still compliant enough that they can just be set at a new longer length? Does it affect alignment or function at their non-vertebral or rib attachment?
Radiology,2prjzr,Kennard,1 point,Fri Dec 19 16:36:21 2014 UTC,"The best way I can put it is, muscles that were not being used at much and suddenly were being used, hurt.

Radiology,2pplby,MisstressFracture,1 point,Fri Jan 9 06:02:57 2015 UTC,"Viewed from the eyes of the U.S. healthcare system: you would first have to determine if this is a routine outpatient visit, or an emergency room visit. A visit to the docs office doesn't always result in diagnostic imaging, although I still get plenty of patients due to treatment/diagnostic exams for chronic disease. In the emergency room scenario, even though this ""pain"" might go away by the following morning, the patient is currently in the E.D. in pain. As a result, the physician feels compelled to determine the cause at that time. Patients don't like being sent home without an explanation to their pain."

I was on prescription medication at the time (xanex) that when the hospital found out about they said violated company policy and I was terminated on the spot.   What a bag of dicks. I'm sorry, I know hospitals/hospital systems are entitled their own policies and HR regulations, but immediate termination for using a prescribed med? This is something I would only mention if employment history and reasons for leaving are brought up. Emphasis being made on how termination was forced due to a specific employer policy.   Should I mention that im involved in fresh start in my letter or save that for an interview?.   It would only matter if this particular program has policies on fresh start students.

She trained a lot of the residents (teaching hospital) in fluoro procedures and was able to do some advanced procedures like fluoro-guided LPs, provided a radiologist signed off on it.  The scope of practice, and therefore their responsibilities, is going to vary based on jurisdiction as well as by the hospital and the department they work in.

Radiology,2ox1iz,SassafrasSprite,2,Wed Dec 10 23:45:18 2014 UTC,"Clinical instuctor here. BSRT(R)(CT). I currently have three students.  You've got to get over it. Students have repeats. Techs have repeats. One repeat a week isn't bad. It is a good sign that you want to master your craft. I wish all my students cared so much. Be more resilient.  Here's exactly what i say to 100% of my hand exam pts.   (As I'm walking back to position the lateral)  ""Alright, Karate chop right on that middle line."" (Demonstrate the ""okay symbol hand"") ""Make the okay symbol"" (Sweeping my pointer finger in an arch towards the posterior of their hand) ""Now pull your pinky BACK""  Usually they rotate into a slight oblique when they oull the pinky back so i just roll their hand slightly back to regain lateral.  If i were your instructor I'd be more worried about the lack of a 1V CXR at 4 months."
Radiology,2ox1iz,Cadillakakak,2,Thu Jan 1 10:40:35 2015 UTC,I just tell them to put there hands on its side make an ok sign and fan the 3-5 digits helping separate them   Learn the lung shapes of different patient  body habitus cone to ac joints on side top of light at vertebral prominens maybe slightly higher and coning to costoprhenic angles just takes time and is hard to know for sure fellow student here good luck!
Radiology,2ox1iz,Twitchy15,1 point,Thu Dec 11 01:43:28 2014 UTC,Thank you. I'm working on imagining lung shape but it's so difficult. I'm terrified of xraying children. I don't want to over irradiate but I also don't want to cut anything off! Is there a general guide as to where lungs end? Bottom of rib cage or higher up?    I need one or two more comps by next week so I'm probably gonna try a portable chest. I learned a lot of stuff about it that we didn't learn in class from online reading but there doesn't seem to be any other helpful articles for other positions. Fingers crossed!
Radiology,2ox1iz,x-ray_girl,2,Thu Dec 11 03:38:28 2014 UTC,"Do not quote me on this and please do not downvote me to hell if I'm wrong.  I just finished my clinical site at a Children's Hospital. I had the same issue with guessing lung fields. Two different tricks taught me two different tips to guess lung size.   Collimate the bottom of your light to about the bend of the elbow. The tech I learned it from said it always works for him, but some other techs have said it didnt work for them so don't use it as a guarentee. More of a guesstimate. Bring the central ray to nipple line, center it to the midline of the body and open the cones so you get light above the shoulders. This is basically how I have done all my chest x-rays at Children's and it's never really failed me. Depending on the kids size and medical condition it may need to be adjusted a little.   I am only a student so if a tech wants to come in and correct me or tell me your tips I would love to know!"
Radiology,2ox1iz,Twitchy15,2,Thu Dec 11 04:24:39 2014 UTC,The lung shape depends on body habitus and your a student you can make mistakes. That's how I was looking at it I was taking some badly coned chest X-rays up and down. So I started coming very tight if you clip your a student it's less bad and I found that really helped me get into a groove of taking chest X-rays still not perfect but just takes time
Radiology,2ox1iz,SheenaMalfoy,1 point,Wed Dec 17 01:53:57 2014 UTC,"I was thinking about this more, especially when you have to collimate for children, and I was wondering, do the costophrenic angles ever fall below the inferior rib margin in expiration? Because if not then that seems to be a fairly simple way to help make sure I have decent collimation."
Radiology,2ox1iz,SheenaMalfoy,2,Fri Dec 19 04:15:47 2014 UTC,"My trick for the fan laterals. Tell them to put your hand this way (demonstrate a straight lateral, hand like a board), then make an ok sign (demonstrating as I do so), then ok I'm just gonna make a few quick adjustments here to get your fingers apart (stick my fingers between theirs like a comb with one hand, forcing the fingers to fan, while holding the wrist still with the other so they don't slip out of lateral). Then move the marker off of the shadows if need be and shoot."
Radiology,2ox1iz,SheenaMalfoy,1 point,Thu Dec 11 02:11:07 2014 UTC,"Maybe my issue is just that I've only done elderly patients so far. Like 70+. I tell them to do exactly what you described but they just can't get/keep the 2nd-5th digits spread.    I really wish they would teach us when an image requires a repeat, when its ""best possible films"" and when patients are actually capable of positioning themselves the way you need them. Because I never actually know and it makes me feel incapable of getting the right images."
Radiology,2ox1iz,SheenaMalfoy,3,Thu Dec 11 02:20:55 2014 UTC,"First time the fan falls out of place: kindly ask them to hold their hand where you've put it.  Second: they probably can't hold it perfectly, so just do the best you can. Remember, if you can pull the middle finger away from the others, the ring finger will likely follow. Then they just need to pull their pinky the other way, if they can. If they're old it likely isn't going to be textbook perfect anyway. Just do what the patient can do.  You're gonna get a few with really nasty RA, whose hands are completely frozen. Not much you can do about that, just try to get the wrist lateral if you can. Also, sometimes an AP will give you less magnification than a PA, depending on what position they are frozen into.  As for repeat images vs. ""good enough,"" it's really a matter of practice and radiologist preferences. Where I'm learning repeats are probably more uncommon than they should be, and a lot of shoddy images get passed. But I know the next city over has a ""perfect image"" standard, where they do way more repeats, to the other extreme where some things could have been passed but were instead repeated. My personal rule is this: what are you trying to see? If you're looking for a foreign body and the lateral isn't perfect, but it's pretty close, then pass it. They've seen what they needed to see. If they're specifically looking for that joint space in the lateral knee to assess arthritis, you had better be able to see the joint space, if it exists. Of course, as a student, all my work is then evaluated by the techs before it can be passed in.  I hope some of this can be of help to you, I know my first semester was a hard one too. It will come with time and practice, trust me."
Radiology,2ox1iz,CartoonPhysics,2,Thu Dec 11 02:51:26 2014 UTC,"Are you in Texas by chance?  I was talking to a lady from there a few weeks ago and she said they have a school there that produces the best techs, because they make them repeat everything until it's perfect.  Meanwhile I'm wondering how many times a patient is being irradiated."
Radiology,2ox1iz,zip-zap,3,Thu Dec 11 07:09:33 2014 UTC,"Nope, New Brunswick, Canada. We've got two schools here, one at each of the hospitals I mentioned. I'm not sure I could tell you which produces better students, but I know we basically sit at opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to repeat rates/exposing patients."
Radiology,2ox1iz,Baial,1 point,Thu Dec 11 13:50:44 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much!! Does it get easier as the program goes on? For some reason I always imagined all degree programs to get progressively harder. But im wondering if maybe first semester is the hardest? Book stuff is a breeze for me. I am really good at retention. As long as the practical stuff gets easier I'll feel so much better. I need to drill to feel confident and we just don't get that opportunity in clinicals.    At my site I feel like we are a ""perfect image"" site. I love it. It's CR, they're really fun awesome people but they also follow all rules strictly. It'll make it much easier at my next site with DR and instructors that allow the students to choose their own positions for finals. Like, what!? My classmates seem to have it so easy. But I'm glad my instructor isn't like that. I feel like I'm learning a lot. I just wish I could see more proof of that."
Radiology,2ox1iz,Baial,2,Thu Dec 11 03:12:26 2014 UTC,"I will get easier, trust me. Yes it's still a hard program, with a buttload of stuff to learn, but the more you do it, the more automatic the beginning things become. Like right now you probably still have troubles remembering kv and mas numbers for most average exams, or knowing whether that image quality is ok to pass in or needs a repeat. Where I'm at, the basic numbers are basically automatic (helps somewhat that we use mostly DR systems), and so my focus is more on how far to modify when I feel a modification is needed.  You'll also develop your own little tricks for different exams, which might be your own invention, but might also be snagged from the people around you. Don't be afraid to learn from them, they have years more experience than you do. If you get conflicting advice, try them both and use the one that works better for you. If you're short, don't be afraid to sit someone down for head/neck work. If you're tall, for the love of god and your own back, please raise the table to a proper height. This also applies to beds, as they are often at their lowest settings on the floors (other than ICUs).  Long story short, it gets easier. Dunno about you guys, but we were thrown into the deep end on our third week. It can only get easier from there."
Radiology,2ox1iz,joshligon,2,Thu Dec 11 13:49:15 2014 UTC,"For the fan lateral: I had a lot of patients who didn't really understand me whenever I asked them to ""make an okay sign"" (even after demonstrating it myself) so what I usually say is:   Put your hand on its side. Put your thumb and index finger together. Now spread the other fingers apart.   All the while I demonstrate each step as I recite it. Sometimes doing things in small easy steps can be less confusing for people, and I've found a lot of success in doing it this way for people with limited English and the elderly. Also, don't be afraid of using sponges, tape, or any other radiolucent material to keep the other fingers apart if you need it.  As for chests: don't beat yourself up. Repeats are far more common than you think, even on a walkie-talkie patient (hell, I've had to do repeats on doctors!). Top of the light around the vertebra prominens usually works for me, but I suggest you read up on different methods, experiment with them and stick to one that you can remember."

Based on the way the PA looks, I suspect this is something outside your thorax.  I say that because it is soft tissue density and is well demarcated. The only way it can be as well demarcated as it is would be to be surrounded or nearly surrounded by lung or air (e.g. outside your body).  Do you have any particularly prominent moles or other skin things going on?  It is large enough that it probably would show up on the PA if it was in your lung...

Radiology,2ohkg7,madasser03,3,Sun Dec 7 02:49:58 2014 UTC,"Manufacturer recommends you give no more than 30ml.  Its hard to use in large vessels, you blow your dose limit in a couple runs.  But it looks good in extremities.  At matching concentrations you really would have a hard time telling iodine from gad on an x-ray.

Radiology,2ohkg7,bretticusmaximus,1 point,Sun Dec 7 03:00:33 2014 UTC,"The problem is, gad also has limited use in renal patients, namely NSF. 30 cc is getting into double dose territory. One thing you can do is use CO2 for angio. You can then use dilute iodinated contrast for selected runs if you truly need it."
Radiology,2ohkg7,madasser03,2,Sun Dec 7 03:59:34 2014 UTC,"We don't do heart caths where I work, but we started using gadolinium during angiograms (mostly lower extremity) in patients with poor renal function.  Its safer for the kidneys but you can only give 30ml per procedure per the manufacturer.  Which brings up its own set of problems.  I don't think its real common to do use gad in an IR setting, but in equal concentrations you would have a hard time telling which angiogram was shot using gad vs. iodine."
Radiology,2ohkg7,IOnlyPlayOneInLife,1 point,Sun Dec 7 03:07:48 2014 UTC,"Actually Gd agents (the contrast agent used in MR) were used in high concentrations (Gd is a lanthide metal) as an alternative to iodinated contrast agents for CT in the early 90s in patients with poor renal function (If my memory is correct it was done at WashU).  Those cases were actually the ones that lead to the discovery of NSF.  It was believed at that time that chelated Gd would not worsen renal function, and while it is true that Gd contrast agents are not nephrotoxic, there are systemic toxicities."
Radiology,2ohkg7,ipseum,4,Sun Dec 7 02:29:11 2014 UTC,med student here...  This breaks my brain because to me it looks just like the aorta is running anterior to what I assume to be the shadow of the heart. Is this something to do with the way they introduce the contrast in this type of study?
Radiology,2ohkg7,idpeeinherbutt,8,Sun Dec 7 01:03:34 2014 UTC,"It's a result of the study. Think of it like a plain film, you're looking at a 3d structure in a 1d format in this image. The aorta runs posterior but because it's full of contrast it enhances more and thus shows through the heart. You interpret it as running anterior because normally when you see an object obscure another it's because it's opaque and blocking it out - here it ""shines through"" because of the degree to which it's enhancing."

Radiology,2oh9po,kappapi708,2,Sun Dec 7 04:08:58 2014 UTC,"Findings/Diagnosis:  Patient (Me), had sciatic pain down right leg for 5 months, relieved with cortisone shots in the L4/L5 and L5/S1 diss. I still have back pain (dull/achy, 7-8 years) and a clicking sound.   I had seen my PCP who ordered x-rays, referred me to a spine specialist who said I had herniated discs. After sharing my results with a chiropractor, he said I had much further problems with that. That resulted in me seeing an orthopedic surgeon and gave the diagnosis.  Right now, I'm a candidate for spinal fusion because that part of my spine isn't stable and given me being young and already having problems, I'm probably facing it in my future. I hear it is an awful procedure but given that spoiler:, I'm not sure if physical therapy, chiropractic care and cortisone shots would cut it forever."

It is an extremely long recovery, and if I were you I would postpone it for as long as you possibly can. Also, personally I would avoid a chiro. I attended one for months and it did nothing but make the pain worse. Granted, a different chiro may help, but I don't have faith in them. Best of luck in the future! Hope it all turns out well."
Radiology,2oh9po,TardisTechnologist,1 point,Thu Dec 18 22:32:45 2014 UTC,"If such a blessing, why postpone it if I may ask? I feel like I'm eager to get it done because I will have more support from family now. I would need the same procedure that you have and of course I'm nervous but I just want the stability in my back that I never really had. My whole life my back pain was written off because I am overweight and if I have stability and higher function I should be able to move easier. Would it be that much worse before I got better?"
Radiology,2oh9po,Glonn,2,Fri Dec 19 17:04:22 2014 UTC,"Simply because of the possibility of a mistake or a failed surgery. We still aren't sure if my fusion was a success, 9 weeks out now and the bone is only just starting to form. Before this surgery, doc told me there is a high possibility I will have it again in the next 10 years to fix levels above the fused ones. I feel very blessed with how mine has turned out. My dad had the same surgery 22 years ago by the same Neuro and ortho, so I knew they'd do well. But I did go through 2 years of PT, 1 year of chiro, 6 months of decompression treatment and 6 months of steroid shots. So I went through quite a bit of conservative treatment before making the choice.   If you truly believe that you are ready for this and that it will make your life better, go for it. But be prepared because it will change your life. The recovery is long and hard, and you absolutely need to obey the doctors orders. Let me know what you decide to do!"

What you may be describing is decorticate posturing - which means the patient is pretty close to death.  Sometimes you can also see that in patients with a previous history of stroke.  Sometimes they may not be able to use a single side - I've seen a lot that have their right or left arms locked in the front of their chest.
Radiology,2ogtc5,Presia,1 point,Sat Dec 6 16:43:58 2014 UTC,"Abnormal posturing:       Abnormal posturing is an involuntary flexion or extension of the arms and legs, indicating severe brain injury. It occurs when one set of muscles becomes incapacitated while the opposing set is not, and an external stimulus such as pain causes the working set of muscles to contract.  The posturing may also occur without a stimulus.  Since posturing is an important indicator of the amount of damage that has occurred to the brain, it is used by medical professionals to measure the severity of a coma with the Glasgow Coma Scale (for adults) and the Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (for infants).

A patient is assessed against the criteria of the scale, and the resulting points give a patient score between 3 (indicating deep unconsciousness) and either 14 (original scale) or 15 (the more widely used modified or revised scale).  GCS was initially used to assess level of consciousness after head injury, and the scale is now used by first aid, EMS, nurses and doctors as being applicable to all acute medical and trauma patients. In hospitals it is also used in monitoring chronic patients in intensive care.  The scale was published in 1974 by Graham Taesdale and Bryan J.

We do however have agency techs which travel around town (but not over large areas of coverage like traveling nurses do) but more often than not those are techs that can't find a steady job anywhere else and are lacking good qualities. A few I have met are great and work agency as a side job however, but they do not make up the majority."
Radiology,2oenq9,NoSubrannke,2,Sun Dec 7 23:51:04 2014 UTC,"Like everyone says, travel techs make more. And usually are compensated for travel costs and housing if necessary. But if you were interested in cross training, it might be harder to do so. Instead of learning where you work, you'd probably have to pay for classes and set up an internship somewhere.   If you don't have a problem with a physically demanding job, then 48 is a great age. :)  I wouldn't worry about the ""name"" of the school. To be eligible to sit for your licensing boards, you have to complete a minimum amount of time in the clinic and in class, as well as pass a certain number of competencies.  IMHO a college program wouldn't be able to continue to exist if it didn't have their students meet those standards. However, at the end of the day, imaging is more about practice than theory. If you know all the book work but can't even shoot a chest x-ray,  it doesn't matter what school you went to.  What will help you get a job is how you act at your clinical sites, and if you know how to get good images, with the book knowledge to back it up.   TL; DR  x-ray is hands on and knowing what to do in a clinical setting, which you will ultimately learn best in a clinical setting, not at school. Go be a travel tech with your bad ass 48 year old self! :)"

I know for a fact that many employers heavily consider what program you graduated from, at least my area. That doesn't mean all x students get jobs and all y students don't, but it does make a significant impact and affects job placement #'s.   That being said, once you have some experience, what school you went to has much lower of an impact, especially out of town so that may have no bearing on a traveling tech employer's decision making or it might!"
Radiology,2oenq9,NoSubrannke,2,Sun Dec 7 23:57:49 2014 UTC,"I'd just put my hat in the ring and mention ultrasound school.  Ultrasound is an expanding field right now, with great wages and continually growing in jobs.    I feel like people sometimes forget that sonography is a part of the radiology department."
Radiology,2oenq9,SassafrasSprite,3,Sat Dec 6 02:10:05 2014 UTC,"I'm just curious cause I've only worked two places and one was my clinical site. How prevalent are male US techs?

Radiology,2oenq9,NoSubrannke,3,Sat Dec 6 03:37:42 2014 UTC,"Being a male tech in Ultrasound is difficult only because of the vaginal exams. Due to the gender discrepancy, a male tech must have another female tech in the room while performing the exam. This can make getting a job a bit more complicated, but only if you work at a small facility. If you seek employment at a large hospital, there is usually more than one tech working at all times so it may be a bit easier to find employment. I know this only because I am an Ultrasound tech myself and have spoken to make techs. Its definitely harder, but possible."
Radiology,2oenq9,FRONTIER07,2,Sat Dec 6 04:36:41 2014 UTC,"While it is true that male sonographers are not extremely prevalent (out of a class of 20 there are usually about 2 in each class at the school I went to), the numbers of male techs are on the rise.  I think the problem is cultural, considering many people believe ultrasound is ""just for babies,"" and that women only would want to work that field.  It's just not true anymore.    There are problems with male techs, such as transvaginal ultrasounds.  Male techs must be chaperoned, but in our region not by another tech, but by another female employee.  I work in a general lab and do about 2 or 3 transvaginal ultrasounds a day.  I work in a somewhat smaller hospital as well (17 bed ER).  I never have a problem with chaperoning though, and have yet to have anyone refuse a test by me.    I know 8 male US techs in the area (which probably has arond 70 or 80 techs total).  So yeah, smaller percentage.  But growing.  There is a male PRN tech that I work with, so two males on a staff of 5."
Radiology,2oenq9,Viaon,1 point,Sat Dec 6 20:20:11 2014 UTC,Interesting. So do female techs need a chaperone when doing a testicular U/S? Would a male tech also need a chaperone when doing a breast U/S?
Radiology,2oenq9,vaporking23,2,Sun Dec 7 00:07:18 2014 UTC,"Where I work, female techs never need a chaperone, and that seems to be the norm most places.  One hospital I did clinicals at did require women to have chaperones during testicular and prostate scans.  Men do need chaperones for breast US as well.  It's a double standard for sure, but it's again a cultural thing."
Radiology,2oenq9,sonogirl25,1 point,Sun Dec 7 13:50:15 2014 UTC,"Per mammo techs I've asked, there are hardly any male mammo techs in the U.S. However, there are some, albeit a low %, of male US techs. That being said I have never seen one and the local programs have had I think 3 in the past decade. Also, females do not need a chaperone while males do, at least in the facilities I am familiar with ( I don't know if this varies by hospital or state or what).   I would not want to be a male US tech, seems like too much of a hassle.  The ethics of tech gender discrimination is a fun topic to discuss."

Radiology,2oenq9,zipadyduda,1 point,Sat Dec 6 18:13:58 2014 UTC,I was always told US is saturated and RT is easier to find a job. And something about some hospitals preferring to hire RTs and train them in US instead of hiring US. Is that totally false?
Radiology,2obrap,Radsburnout,12,Fri Dec 5 02:50:22 2014 UTC,"Some of the complaints you have about your residency closely mirror some of the frustrations I had with my own training program (i.e. too many procedures at the expense of reading cases, inefficient systems, poor quality lectures). And I was, at times, entirely cynical about the program and how it was run. I wasn't the only resident who felt that way either. One of my co-residents constantly tried to voice his complaints and attempt to change things. But it rarely produced results and in the process of battling the leadership he became embittered and won himself a less than sterling reputation in the department. That reputation has followed him to fellowship and will likely impact his employment opportunities.  IMO, what my co-resident failed to realize is that as a resident you have very little power. Yes, you are a doctor, some of your decisions have real consequences, and you know some things. But in the eyes of the attendings, you are essentially cheap labor with no workplace rights that the ACGME hasn't forced down their throats. This is part of the price you pay for the opportunity to become a certified radiologist.   Plus, is it really that bad? So what if you have to do a million LP's. Your needle work will be stellar and that crosses over into every area of radiology. Also, the number of cases you see on call will likely dwarf the number of cases you read during the day. Besides, if you're lucky you will only come across one or two really interesting cases in an entire day shift. Just ask your attendings to show you the good cases they find. In terms of your education, studying on your own is the most important thing anyway. And with the seemingly endless sources of radiology educational materials teaching yourself has become easier than ever. Also, every radiology department has inefficiencies. They can be immensely frustrating. You're not alone on that front. But it's not a reason to condemn your program and it's not something you control. Making changes in medicine is like steering an aircraft carrier... slow. And you are only at your residency for a short period of time. Any change you effect will be small.   It's best to stay focused on learning the things you need to learn and being friendly with those you work with. Fighting battles you can't win only hurts you.  tldr; I feel your frustration brotha, but your program isn't yours to change and it's better to focus your energy on more productive activities."
Radiology,2obrap,alansamigo,3,Fri Dec 5 06:21:46 2014 UTC,"Hey boss -- I'm sorry to hear about your experience thus far. I'm only a med student, so can't speak to what you're going through, other than to send my condolences. I am curious though, if you could think back and try and remember, if there were any ""red flags"" you feel you may have missed. Things that might have cued you to their hesitance to embrace the changes sweeping across the US healthcare system, or otherwise? Thanks for your insight.  Once again, sincerely sorry to hear that this program is less than what you hoped, but wish you the best moving forward."
Radiology,2obrap,kensalmighty,1 point,Fri Dec 5 04:47:14 2014 UTC,"As an English med student, could you tell me about the changes moving through US health at the moment?"
Radiology,2obrap,alansamigo,2,Fri Dec 5 09:21:39 2014 UTC,"Ah man well, you're probably already aware of the Affordable Healthcare Act, which is the US's attempt at distributing healthcare costs. The mandates included in that affect a lot with regard to reimbursement rates. The government now requires that a physician meet certain standards in order to receive max compensation. To meet these new goals requires change, as the OP alluded to. Some places are using more innovative measures to meet these goals, while others may be more focused on cutting costs, as in OP's situation (if I understand it appropriately).  There are also changes occurring in residency availability and potentially the exam required for placement in the US. My knowledge of that however, is lacking, as the merging/reshaping hasn't completely come to fruition.  Hope that helps."
Radiology,2obrap,AnotherRadiologist,1 point,Fri Dec 5 18:28:35 2014 UTC,"Your best course of action is to direct your complaints through the proper channels.  If your program director can't do anything, go to the department chair.  If he/she can't do anything, take it to your Graduate Medical Education Committee, or whatever your institutional equivalent is.  Academic programs?  Go to the dean.  For a private practice program, I don't know.  The next thing is to be honest on your actual program evaluations.  If red flags come up there the program must address them or the program will be at risk of going on probation or worse."

Radiology,2o9gxq,abefroman20,11,Thu Dec 4 14:46:57 2014 UTC,"There are several methods to reach an optimally enhanced pulmonary trunk and arteries. From my experience, they all have their merits and techs that swear by them.   SmartPrep: Most manufacturers now offer some sort of HU tracking software that automatically triggers when a certain HU is reached. Alternatively, the tech can trigger the scan manually once they see optimal enhancement during the smartprep scan. Bolus timing: Old fashioned in a way, but this method involves sort of a test bolus to get the right timing. A small contrast dose is administered (usually around 20ml) and a single slice is taken at intervals through the pulmonary arteries to time how long it takes for the test bolus to reach the arteries and optimally enhance. This method can also be used in combination with the smartprep software. Good old 4ml/sec rate of injection and 20sec scan delay: By definition the least accurate, and yet the one that seems to almost always get the timing right. Injector setting @ 4ml/sec with a bolus of 70-90ml intravenous contrast. You may choose to chase this bolus with some normal saline. Scan delay set to 20-25 secs. Useful tips: Educate your patient in how important breath holds and limiting motion are to exam quality. Specifically, try to explain that they should breathe in normally when instructed, and not necessarily have to take in a huge breath.   IV access for any CTA exam is best with a 20g catheter or larger. Ideally, you want IV access in the cubital fossa or higher. Cephalic vein in the lateral side of the wrist may work well too."
Radiology,2o9gxq,shadowa4,3,Thu Dec 4 16:35:17 2014 UTC,"Thanks, very helpful!"
Radiology,2o9gxq,pascal46,3,Thu Dec 4 18:02:33 2014 UTC,For smart prepping I found that going a little bit below the Carina works well. The trick is to tell pts to breath normally (so the smart prep slice doesn't move too much) and to reselect a prep slice if you cannot clearly see the pulmonary trunk.
Radiology,2o9gxq,Doboy64,2,Thu Dec 4 18:25:11 2014 UTC,"Our department just puts a smart prep slice through the heart (ventricle or atrium, doesn't really matter) because once you see contrast in any chamber of the heart, it'll take about 8-9sec for the machine to move the patient, start scanning, and reach the pulmonary trunk again. My experience, that works about 95% of the time with the 5% being those with extremely slow or extremely rapid heart-rates, which you'll be able to judge during the smart prep scans.  We've also been experimenting with during the CTA during expiration rather than inspiration if the first attempt proves too unsatisfactory. It seems to be getting promising results."
Radiology,2o9gxq,CommissarAJ,1 point,Fri Dec 5 06:23:14 2014 UTC,"Agreed. Our protocol involves doing the chest w/o first, so I can select the proper slice for smartprep every time!"

Radiology,2o9gxq,subintimal,2,Sat Dec 6 04:01:05 2014 UTC,"I could very well be wrong; as I said, that's what I was told.  We used to do CTAs without the non-contrasted phase, then were told that we had to do a without, at least through the pulmonary trunk.  That lasted a couple of years.  We all had the same concern about unnecessary dose, and as of about 3 years ago, we were told that the bolus-tracking slices could probably count as a without phase.  Sounds like bs to me, but at least we're not doubling the dose on every pt anymore."

You're very right that it took forever to reach the requisite HU to trigger the scan, or far to often it didn't reach at all.  Our department has since updated to a 64-slice Siemens scanner and we dropped our threshold to 100 HU. Since the upgrade I haven't had a study come back sub-optimal or non-diagnostic."
Radiology,2o9gxq,brendasaurusrex,2,Sun Dec 7 01:46:05 2014 UTC,"I have worked on GE, Toshiba, and Siemens scanners. For the most part I prefer a Timing Bolus because it gives you a chance to observe your patient's cardiac output before you pump all your contrast through. IV size and location is crucial - 20g or larger in the AC is preferable. I inject between 4.0-6.0 ml/s based on the patient's size. I find that with Smart Prep-ing I don't necessarily miss the contrast in the pulmonary artery but I do get unnecessary contrast in the aorta. Most of this has been said already but I agree that keeping the patient's breath holds consistent is a big part as well. What kind of scanners do you use? Maybe we can offer more specifics but shadowa4's answer pretty well covered it all."

AVN and non union rates are pretty high with these fractures, although yours looks to be more of a distal pole fx.

For getting the most out of your clinical time:   Learn what histories warrant what exams. Primaries, ED docs, Hopsitalists/Intesivists rarely know what they actually need. If you know when a patient would need a 4 phase liver vs and pancreatic protocol, you will be ahead of many of the techs I know.  Anatomy and pathology. Pay attention to what you are seeing. If something looks odd, follow it up! Ask a senior tech, a radiologist, even read the report if you have access and ability. Pay know attention to the drama.

Radiology,2nod14,Xeriel,24,Fri Nov 28 16:24:02 2014 UTC,"fMRI generally is not designed to detect brain activity per se. It detects changes in activity as you perform various tasks (or,  in some experiments, as other areas of the brain change their activity). Tasks are generally alternated with negative control periods. In the literature, this is referred to as a ""contrast"". So unless your claustrophobia is only present while you are performing memory tasks, it won't affect the final results.   That said, there are some periodic events that occur in the scanner (breathing, heartbeat, head movement) but there are many ways to account for them in the analysis."

If the tech school says you'll be a Limited Scope technologist after graduation, just run away screaming.  Limited Scopes can't do jack squat anymore aside from working at small clinics for crap pay.  If they tell you you'll be a fully scoped RT, then it might be legit.   Laws were recently passed that say you have to have a minimum of an Associate's degree in order to practice though.  So make sure they meet those requirements and are certified through the right agencies.

Radiology,2n9oq9,vagrantheather,1 point,Wed Nov 26 23:22:02 2014 UTC,"have you taken any bio based courses? my prerequisites were two math classes and then a lot of bio (basic biology, anatomy and physiology, physics). it took me 2 years to finish the prerequisites, but it can be done in one year.   for prerequisites: anatomy is rough, but I really enjoyed the class and learned a lot from it and it's a class you'll use everyday in radiology.   for courses in the actual program: radiation physics was rough for me (not good at math). I think the procedures courses for actual positioning can be rough at first, but once you get in clinic and start doing these exams on a daily basis it becomes much easier. I think imaging and exposure can be tricky on some topics too.  my bachelor's program took 3 years for the actual radiology courses. I spent a total of 5 years at my university, but you can take the prerequisites at a community college and transfer at most schools.  I ended up working in diagnostic radiology as a student and made a decent amount. I chose cardiac cath lab as my advanced practice (another perk of a bachelor's program is spending a year in an advanced modality). cath lab gave me a great foundation and good experience to my current job, which is interventional radiology in the OR for vascular, cardiac, and neurosurgery."

Radiology,2n9oq9,rwiwy,3,Mon Dec 1 00:31:00 2014 UTC,The most important thing is to make sure your program is JRCERT accredited.   It's a good thing that the programs are competitive. You don't want a school that takes 20-30 students per year - that means they're cranking them out and the local job market is probably pretty terrible.
Radiology,2n9oq9,Mellow_Johnny,3,Thu Nov 27 01:25:44 2014 UTC,Radiology is a vast field and I had no idea when I got into my program almost 3 years ago where I would be today (working in the cath lab at a level 1 trauma center.) The best thing about being a rad tech is knowing you can diversify in a bunch of different directions. Choose wisely though. Shadow and make friends every where.
Radiology,2n9oq9,muriop,1 point,Mon Nov 24 23:45:07 2014 UTC,How do you like cath lab? Whats your typical day like?
Radiology,2n9oq9,TokenGestures,2,Tue Nov 25 00:29:54 2014 UTC,"My first reaction to this was ""if only..."" our days in the lab are rarely actually ""same shit different day"" in terms of cases. I cannot speak to all cath labs but in ours we are constantly getting transfers from other hospitals in the area, some because they don't have interventional doctors, some because the interventional doctors couldn't do anything for the patient. We also have our regular schedule. And add ons from within the hospital. The truly slow day is very rare.  We also have doctors who like to push to do things other doctors won't.   In terms of actual things we do: left and right heart catheterization, percutaneous interventions, valvuloplasty, ASD and PFO closures, and TAVR procedures. We also have an electrophysiology lab where they put in pacers and ICDs. (They probably do other things but I am predominantly cath...) we also have a room specifically for cardioversions and TEEs.   It is a very difficult transition from xray school directly to a cath lab but I'm not sure if I really want to go back now. Though I do get sentimental when they come do stat portable chest xrays for us.  If you have more specific questions, I would be happy to answer."

Radiology,2n1a68,p3na,3,Fri Nov 21 23:47:31 2014 UTC,"Hi there! Canadian MRT here (junior though, only 6yrs experience).  Canada is a great place to work as an MRT...assuming you can find stable work. Big cities currently have a bit of a glut of techs, but thankfully it is a job that can land you work on side of the country to the other. A lot of people head to the big cities - Toronto, Calgary, and Vancouver - to find work, with Calgary being the 'go to' city these days thanks to the economic boom of the oil sands.  Now the process? Well, to work in Canada you will likely need to pass the CAMRT exam. If you're from another Commonwealth nation (ie - Australia, UK, New Zealand), I believe they're willing to take your homelands national certification as an equivalent. If you're from the US, I do think you need to take the exam but don't quote me on that. After you've passed the exam, you only need to register with the provincal regulatory body (for example, the CMRTO for the province of Ontario) as they are the ones who hand out the license to operate in that province. CAMRT membership is not a necessary requirement for most major hospitals, though that is ultimately up to the employer's discretion.  I can help more specifics, though it might help to know which country you're coming from."
Radiology,2n1a68,CommissarAJ,1 point,Sat Nov 22 01:34:50 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the reply. I come from Finland and I've done a 3,5 year education in university of applied sciences. There's a big list of needed documents on the CAMRT website that I need to collect before applying for the test so that's my step one.  How difficult is the test? Should one with 3years worth of working experience pass it easily or will it require lots of studying?"
Radiology,2n1a68,CommissarAJ,1 point,Sat Nov 22 02:38:35 2014 UTC,"While I'm entirely sure as to the level of training and education that are required for Finland, I think its safe to presume you know the basics of anatomy and positioning. I would certainly suggest brushing up on the procedures, since its rather easy to forget details about some of older tests that you may not have done much in your past years of experience.   I'm sure you've already seen them, but there is a prep guide offered, which includes recommended textbooks if you want to brush up. For a fee, there are mock exams available as well.  In all honesty, the exam should not be that difficult for somebody who's been working for 3 years."
Radiology,2n1a68,paulatwork,1 point,Sat Nov 22 02:53:05 2014 UTC,"We're told that the CAMRT exam is difficult.  I know it's supposed to be harder then the US exam.  I've worked with a few foreign techs.  A lot failed on their first try as they thought they'd be ok with just experience, so my suggestion is to brush up on things before you write it."
Radiology,2n1a68,CommissarAJ,1 point,Sat Nov 22 06:17:02 2014 UTC,I know that these probably vary between the hospitals but what are your working hours like? How many vacation days do you have? Do you only work on one modality or do you get to change? (between basic x-rays and CT for example)   And if I've understood correctly I need to choose in which province I want to work before applying to CAMRT. Can you give some pros and cons of different provinces? Living and working vice. Mainly Toronto has been on my mind but my options are still open

For actual rooms we use Konica DR plates(gadolinium?sp). The Mira is pretty powerful, though all the techniques we have don't use grids.  http://digitalradiographysolutions.com/all-charts/ I'm not sure how accurate these charts are because I think my sites LUT tables have been fiddled with, as in most of the techs are still using film techniques when we are on DR and could be saving patients so much dose, but now I just sound like a douche.  Anyways, find out the DR scintilator, mess around a bit with a phantom if you can and also, look at what techniques the previous techs have been using would be my suggestion.  Sorry, this came off a lot more whiney than I had intended/arrogant.

Radiographer, radiology tech, radiologic technologist, and x-ray tech are all interchangeable terms for the same individual.

I know a few I work with are going to school and want to become techs.  Aside from job shadowing, it's a great way to see if this is a career path you want to pursue.    A Radiology Nurse is basically an RN attached to the department.  They have varying duties depending on the hospital or clinic they work for and it obviously requires a nursing degree.

Radiology,2mzsqc,EnglishKiniggit,1 point,Fri Nov 21 23:16:38 2014 UTC,Are you currently a Radiology Technologist? One of the programs nearest to me is a competitive tech school an ad it is only available to 10-15 students.
Radiology,2mzsqc,SassafrasSprite,1 point,Sat Nov 22 03:37:28 2014 UTC,"Yes, I actually just became a full fledged tech this past May.  I went through a community college program though.    Be very wary of the tech schools if that's the route you choose.  I did that first and it was a mistake.  If the tech school says you'll be a Limited Scope technologist after graduation, just run away screaming.  Limited Scopes can't do jack squat anymore aside from working at small clinics for crap pay.  If they tell you you'll be a fully scoped RT, then it might be legit.   Laws were recently passed that say you have to have a minimum of an Associate's degree in order to practice though.  So make sure they meet those requirements and are certified through the right agencies.  If I were you, I'd look into college based or hospital based programs and avoid the tech school route ENTIRELY.   10-15 students sounds about the average.  My class started out around 27 and we lost a few along the way."

Radiology,2mzsqc,EnglishKiniggit,2,Sat Nov 22 04:59:22 2014 UTC,"I'm only in my first semester of the actual program but it's been easy so far. I'm relatively good at memorizing things so I dot need to study much outside class to maintain 90%+. Although I should really be shooting for higher grades.    Most of it is memorization. Anatomy, bone names, locating anatomy in images, learning the shit behind the process of taking pictures [kvp, mas, density, contrast, noise, and how they affect each other], learning what positions certain body parts need to be for each set of X-rays and then what do adjust if your image doesn't look like what it should, aaaand then learning prosecutes like barium swallows, ivp, arthrograms, and you'll probably have to do enemas. Which I totally didn't know till I started the program but whaatevs.    I didn't think I'd be too into it at first. I just basically felt like I needed to finally pick something and actually get a degree. But I really really enjoy it now."
Radiology,2mzsqc,SassafrasSprite,2,Sat Nov 22 23:14:54 2014 UTC,Thanks for the insight. Is the program that you're in a competitive one?
Radiology,2mzsqc,EnglishKiniggit,2,Sat Nov 22 23:39:27 2014 UTC,"Hmm yeah I think? They said they get about 75 apps a year and they choose 15. Basically you need As to get in. I think I had one b but I got accepted to all three in my state. Now jobs after school are waay more competitive from what I've heard. But it depends on location I think?

Radiology,2mzsqc,peedzllab,1 point,Sat Nov 22 23:51:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah, they're only accepting 10-18 but I'm thinking about applying to their requirements. Sadly, there is an online class to medical terminology no offered at my school. And most the programs are required for you to take it"

Granted, I moved to very heavily populated area with a ton of hospitals and clinics.  Your internship is SERIOUSLY a working job interview.  I think the majority of new techs get jobs from places they've interned at as long as they're on point and good workers , not even the best with xrays yet.  I was told by a really cool lead tech that the positioning will come with time and practice but work ethic is what determines if you'll get hired there."
Radiology,2mzsqc,SassafrasSprite,1 point,Sun Nov 23 22:40:52 2014 UTC,"As someone who cant remember shit when I leave my desk I would say its rather difficult. I am only 2 months away from preparing for the registry. Please be aware that this kind of school takes quite a bit of dedication to studies, you currently are a student in school and know how demanding school can be. This was on a whole new level for me, a lot of stuff is self taught, which I am terrible at doing, so its rather challenging(This is just the experience at my school, I am sure there are better ones at there).  With that being said, I absolutely love this field. I really genuinely care about the patients that I work with, and I love the patient care aspect of the job. I guess I am just a people person and can talk to most folks."

That's mostly as far as physics is concerned though.  I am not a math person...at all. lol.  As far as patient care (common sense) and anatomy go, those were the easiest for me.  It's visual memorization...and I think the same would apply to the radiographic positioning classes as well.  That one required a good amount of study and memorization as well as physical practice which you'll get in class and at your internship sites."

Except for very specific questions (anastomotic leak etc.) we never use po contrast anymore for this reason. Volumen and IV contrast seems to work much better for bowel.
Radiology,2mvk6u,TrevorReznik04,1 point,Fri Nov 21 13:57:02 2014 UTC,"Then your radiologists don't know their own literature.  At first it was only in the EM literature, but now even the radiology journals are publishing studies showing that there is essentially no change in either sensitivity or diagnostic accuracy with PO contrast.  The only times that I order PO contrast is if I suspect that there is an issue with the bowel itself or if they have abnormal anatomy such as a history of a gastric bypass to help out the radiologist."
Radiology,2mvk6u,rykh7,2,Fri Nov 21 08:57:52 2014 UTC,ED scribe here. I've noticed that some of the providers have opted to not give PO contrast for things like a r/o appy. The problem is a lot of the rads (particularly the older ones) seem to call after getting the study asking why they didn't get contrast. So now  they have resorted to getting contrast again.
Radiology,2mvk6u,cens337,8,Thu Nov 20 15:32:46 2014 UTC,"Which I get. But you have to look at it from a radiologist's perspective. Yeah, you can see appendicitis without oral or IV contrast. But radiologists don't exclusively look at the appendix. They look at all other anatomy that's presented to them, so why wouldn't we give them as much information as possible, with images with the most possible enhancement? The rads I work with are fantastic, and I would never question their requests. They read the images, not me, not PA's, not ED docs."
Radiology,2mvk6u,cens337,4,Thu Nov 20 15:46:31 2014 UTC,"Agreed. Obviously I'm in no position to judge since I'm not a physician (yet). Just something I've noticed. And obviously Id be pissed if I waited an hour and a half for plain CT and rad reading only to be told I would have to spend another 3 hours drinking contrast, getting another CT and waiting for the another reading."
Radiology,2mvk6u,shadowa4,4,Thu Nov 20 16:23:06 2014 UTC,"yeah exactly, which I think is what my rads are going for. Also, our radiologists only require a physician's signoff for IV contrast if the gfr is below 40, and from what I understand at most places the cutoff is 60. Not sure what the rationale is there, I'm surprised we haven't put more people into renal failure"

Radiology,2mxm08,teambc,7,Fri Nov 21 00:35:20 2014 UTC,What you're referring to is called a dosimeter.  It is your employers responsibility to provide you with one of these AFAIK.  I have never been employed in an area that did not require their use.

I was doing pricing for them last week and they're mighty expensive and get cheaper if you buy them in ""bulk"". It's a yearly expense.

EDIT: Looking at your submission history I see that you are a chiropractor. New question, do you think you have the necessary training to obtain quality x-ray images while also limiting your patient's exposure?"
Radiology,2mxm08,cherryblack,3,Fri Nov 21 19:14:48 2014 UTC,I am curious about this too if OP doesn't know what a dosimeter is..
Radiology,2mxm08,FadedLogic,2,Fri Nov 21 20:18:47 2014 UTC,"Hey Faded, thanks for your concern.  You're right. I am a Chiropractor, I just graduated. I feel I do have the necessary training to obtain diagnostic quality images, while limiting exposure to patients.   We have had extensive training in radiography, radiology interpretation, and laboratory clerkship. As part of our degree, we are licensed to take and interpret radiographs. This privilege is recognized around the world by local colleges and regulatory bodies respectively, and is a privilege associated with our degree.   I do not take patient safety lightly. I measure every patient, input the appropriate exposure factors, and provide the proper shielding all according to the guidelines and procedures of our regulatory body. Only if an x-ray is indicated, of course.   I obviously forgot what the name of the ""safety card"" was, we never had to wear them in our four years at Chiropractic college, so the name escaped me.  The reason I was asking is because i'm just really paranoid about radiation dose, even when I go to the dentist, I don't feel comfortable because every room has an x-ray unit, anyway, I digress.   I hope that answers your question and if you have any more, I would love to address them.   I appreciate your feedback."
Radiology,2mxm08,Trigger2188,6,Fri Nov 21 23:30:39 2014 UTC,But you don't know what a dosimeter is? That's a massive black hole in your training there if you don't know about radiation dose monitoring for employees.

What I'm getting out of this is that either A) Your school didn't monitor it's student's exposure or B) There was a very short time during school when you were working in an x-ray room. The first one would make me question the quality of the program you were in since your exposure levels should have been monitored. This would be a case of the blind leading the blind when it came to your training in radiography.The second option would mean that your training in positioning for radiography was not very extensive and you do not have the experience or training needed to be x-raying patients."

Radiology,2msp20,INGWR,8,Wed Nov 19 19:05:50 2014 UTC,"I don't know about your specific equipment, but for our digital systems, the computer will automatically flip the img if the setting is on PA anything (other than extremeties). So the actual raw img taken is inverted, but the ""flip"" happens along with all the rest of img processing. If you have film, it's the same as taking the processed film and putting it on the viewer backwards."

Radiology,2mlpt8,TardisTechnologist,1 point,Tue Nov 25 03:29:37 2014 UTC,It's common in the states. One time the doctor even flat out said that he ordered them so he had something to say and that he did something productive. Lol.
Radiology,2mlpt8,TokenGestures,1 point,Tue Nov 25 14:59:42 2014 UTC,"There are several studies which report physicians admittedly ordering unnecessary exams just to give the patient some satisfaction that they are receiving care they feel they ""need"". For example, a patient comes in to emerg with a rolled ankle and the triage nurse (correctly) puts them at the bottom of the list, they wait 3 hours to see a physician. At that point, it's hard for the physician to do a 5 minute physical examination, determine there is no # or serious trauma, and tell them to go home and rest it. Patients want to know they are having something done, and if it takes a big machine which goes ""beep"" to give them that satisfaction, sometimes Docs find it easier to send them our way than to rightfully send them home. That's why we have the Ottawa Ankle Rules... not that ankles are the only unnecessary exams ordered! The way x-rays are ordered in the ER will be changing for us in the coming years, which is good.  Anyway, ribs... in my experience rads don't like looking at them and would rather just see a CXR. Similarly I'd rather just do a CXR haha. Unless there is associated pathology from a rib # (pneumo etc.) which would be demonstrated on a CXR then there isn't much that can be done clinically anyway AFAIK. Would be interested for some more rad input on the matter though."

Radiology,2mlpt8,SassafrasSprite,8,Tue Nov 18 00:05:40 2014 UTC,"Once you learn some neat ""tricks"" you'll love shoulders.  My favorite is for the Y. Assuming you do your shoulders AP:    Oblique your patient, have them put their arm across their chest. Run your hand up the medial border of the scapula (becomes more prominent when their arm is across their chest).  Using the collimator light to create shadows, poke your finger straight up from that medial border, then instruct your patient to lower their arm again. From the front using your other hand, poke your finger straight up following the line of the humerus.    You'll now see two finger-shadows on your IR. Your goal is to now oblique/turn your patient until those two finger-shadows overlap on the IR. By doing this you created a path that simulates the scapula outlet, and by overlapping the finger-shadows you lined up your beam to go straight through it."
Radiology,2mlpt8,SassafrasSprite,1 point,Tue Nov 18 02:21:15 2014 UTC,"You are seriously awesome. I haven't even got to practice one yet, but I planned on trying AP when I do. I've seen techs do the arm cross but not anything else. I'm sure they have it down well enough that they don't need to. I kind of can't wait to try this. I'll have to run into the break room to grab my phone otherwise I will forget everything I just read. Thank you!!"
Radiology,2mlpt8,SheenaMalfoy,1 point,Tue Nov 18 02:26:01 2014 UTC,"I seriously had THE HARDEST TIME with Y-views until this trick. I wish everyone else knew it and I wish I could show it to everyone struggling with shoulders.   It also works with lateral scapulas too, except in the lateral scapula you keep their arm across their chest so that the scapula juts out to the side and does not superimpose with the humerus.   And for what it's worth, I've never seen anyone do a shoulder PA. Only in the book. :)"
Radiology,2mlpt8,SheenaMalfoy,2,Tue Nov 18 02:28:38 2014 UTC,"Really? In our hospital most techs to it PA. Lowers the OID that way, which reduces magnification. That's the way I learned it, and unless the patient can't do it, that's the way I'll always do them."
Radiology,2mlpt8,arcticfawx,1 point,Tue Nov 18 15:37:43 2014 UTC,"Really? That kinda seems backward... doing it AP would have your shoulder closer to the IR. Unless you mean just the Y. I have seen techs do them either way, and you can still do the finger trick either way also, but since I already have them in the AP position I just continue it that way."

Radiology,2mlpt8,arcticfawx,2,Tue Nov 18 18:23:57 2014 UTC,That's probably good to do it PA too - reduces thyroid dose.

Radiology,2mlpt8,SassafrasSprite,1 point,Wed Nov 19 20:10:06 2014 UTC,"We'll also do them AP occasionally when the patient can sit up for us, but aren't steady enough to stand.

Radiology,2mlpt8,SheenaMalfoy,1 point,Wed Nov 19 22:25:44 2014 UTC,"I try to get them on a stool if they're stable enough to sit up and not fall over. Then I can spin them however I need. But patient condition doesn't always allow that, and our ER room is super awkward to tilt stretchers in that way because the generator is very close to the wall bucky on one side and on the other side we store our grids and pigg-o-stat and air con. Then I just end up doing it supine."

Don't be afraid to touch people and be firm with them when you want to convey what you need them to do. A little communication and radiographer to patient contact goes a long way.

Radiology,2mg0zw,hughthewineguy,34,Sun Nov 16 05:34:43 2014 UTC,"A 21-year-old dental assistant attempted suicide by injecting 10 ml (135 g) of elemental mercury (quicksilver) intrave- nously. She presented to the emergency room with tachypnea, a dry cough, and bloody sputum. While breathing room air, she had a partial pressure of oxygen of 86 mm Hg. A chest radiograph showed that the mercury was distributed in the lungs in a vascular pattern that was more pronounced at the bases. The patient was discharged after one week, with improvement in her pulmonary symptoms. Oral chelation therapy with dimercaprol was given for nine months, until the patient stopped the treatment; the urinary mercury level did not change during this period. At follow-up at 10 months, she was healthy, with none of the renal, gastrointestinal, or neurologic effects that can result from the oxidation of mer- cury in the blood and consequent exposure of these organ systems. The abnormalities on the chest radiograph were still apparent. Although these abnormalities are striking, the absence of clinical toxicity in this patient illustrates the differences in the acute and chronic effects of exposure to elemental mercury, inorganic mercury (e.g., mercuric chloride), and or- ganic mercury (e.g., dimethylmercury). Inorganic and organic mercury are much more toxic than elemental mercury; for example, a dose of 400 mg of mercury in the form of dimethylmercury is usually lethal"

Radiology,2mg0zw,carolinablue199,6,Sun Nov 16 12:38:46 2014 UTC,"IV injection of mercury metal is surprisingly benign. Chronical inhalation of mercury vapor however isn't. About the worst thing you can with spilled mercury is to vacuum it up. Use a suction bottle to collect the drops, and absorb the rest with sulfur powder and/or iodiated activated charcoal.  The very worst are mercury organyls, e.g. methylmercury. This is what happens to mercury in the oceans due to bacteria metabolism, which then get further enrichened in the food chain, up to toxic levels.   Remarkably toxic stuff, even to trained professionals http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Wetterhahn"

Radiology,2mbo7m,radstudent,11,Fri Nov 14 21:52:40 2014 UTC,"Your CI is a shithead. First, talk to your program director. If they also suck, you can talk to someone at the hospital. They do NOT want anything going on to make patients question their choice of coming there for care. Talking bad about the person doing an exam in front of the patient is assuredly costing them a LOT of business. Of course, going that far could risk your time with the program."
Radiology,2mbo7m,TastyClown,7,Fri Nov 14 22:50:14 2014 UTC,"Your CI is way out of line. I am a clinical instructor for a community college and this type of behavior is unacceptable. Your CI should be critical of you as to make you a better student. However, constant berating is not the way to foster learning. I run my clinical site as laid back as possible because I feel students learn best in an environment that they feel comfortable in."
Radiology,2mbo7m,lolchris123,3,Fri Nov 14 23:16:44 2014 UTC,"Almost sounds like the experience I had at my first clinical site.  I could write a small book about it, but I eventually had to stand up for myself--in tears--to the CI.  She was still rude to me for most of the remaining rotation, but a lot less so.  It wasn't until my rotation was about over that I really impressed her with something she taught me, that isn't taught in the books.  We hugged after I departed for the last time.  Seriously though, you probably ought to talk to your program director about the abuse."

At the end of the semester or program they'll likely give you the chance to evaluate them. This will be your time to truly express your feelings. As someone said before, talk to your program director. Try to use specific examples to explain why you feel in such a way."
Radiology,2mbo7m,Trigger2188,1 point,Sat Nov 15 02:42:38 2014 UTC,I agree with everyone that your CI is horrible but my advice is to do your best to wade through the bullshit.  Couple of points:   What is the best case scenario you can hope to achieve by complaining to the program director? Maybe the CI might lose their CI designation and become just a regular tech again. You still have to work with them so you'll still be dealing with their shit. I doubt they would fire the tech for something like this. If it gets so bad you are seriously thinking about quitting then you should talk to your program director. Maybe try to keep a log of the events that occur.  Maybe the tech just gets frustrated with newer students and you'll find it easier once you progress further.  Try to use this to your advantage. Their are gonna be times during your education and throughout your career where you will have to work with shitty people or you are put into uncomfortable situations. Learning how to deal with it now as a student will benefit you in the future. When you make it through you can look back and say that no matter what was thrown your way you overcame and reached your goal.   Good luck and keep working hard.
Radiology,2mbo7m,epiclylegendary,1 point,Sat Nov 15 21:06:13 2014 UTC,Have the same problem. Be exceptional at each site and your CI will have nothing to pull you down. A lot of CI's seemed pissed because they couldn't do the job. My CI said a lot of shit about me and then when sites were expressing how much of an asset I've been to them... he did a complete 180 with his words. Every time he shows up and asks if I need to talk about anything I just say I'm really busy and that he's good to go whenever.

Radiology,2mbo7m,Blasterion,1 point,Mon Nov 17 16:18:58 2014 UTC,"Are you going to be bouncing around between clinical sites or are you assigned one clinical spot for the entire duration of your program? If the first one applies, just suck it up for now until you're done with your time there and hope that things get better at the next clinical site. If you're stuck there for the entire duration of your program, I would definitely make the director or program instructor at your school aware of the situation at hand. There is nothing worse than having a clinical instructor that has the ability to make your life a living hell, they have it within their power to deny your comps and if they're evil enough, deny you the ability to basically graduate. When I was in school, I was at one clinical spot for the duration of my degree and while I didn't have any problems with my CI, she absolutely DESPISED other females that were in the program. It was almost as if she wanted to assert herself as the alpha female and would go to great lengths to to be a major pain in the ass. She had one student that had come in from the Philippines and just needed to complete his comps so that he could sit for the boards, he had completed everything but she refused to let him pass on a barium enema exam even though he had done three on the last day he was there. If that isn't evil, I don't know what is. Anyway, before I draw this out too long, I highly recommend letting someone know what's going on otherwise she's going to keep doing what she's doing without any repercussions."

Radiology,2m9v2v,hypermodernism,3,Fri Nov 14 19:04:50 2014 UTC,Official Royal College press release: http://rcr.us4.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=9a59d100a640966545d45b685&id=973177c1ac&e=bf41f98475  New model proposal: http://www.rcr.ac.uk/docs/newsroom/pdf/Radiology_networks_position_paper_published_sept2014.pdf
Radiology,2m9v2v,MalcontentUK,2,Fri Nov 14 10:26:22 2014 UTC,"Looks like the new proposals still have the same number of UK radiologists reporting the same number of examinations, just with more specialisation - which takes the radiologist further from the patient and team. Would we be better off with a system whereby clinicians request a radiologist opinion only when they need it? Many clinicians are quite competent to assess imaging relevant to their specialty and decide whether further input is required. Imaging tests could be handled in a similar fashion to an echo or lung function tests where the requesting team can decide whether specialist input is required or not."
Radiology,2m9v2v,Yellowbenzene,8,Fri Nov 14 15:56:49 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure this would work safely or be efficient. Generally clinical teams think they can interpret their imaging but in my experience it is actually very patchy and the vast majority of clinicians do not have the time set aside to be consistently interpreting and reporting images well. Being able to review images and find the most obvious finding is one thing, but is quite different from issuing a formal - and legally important - report and confidently identifying and interpreting all the findings; that takes training and time. Worse, a system where the clinician believing they've got it right decides to not refer it on for specialist Radiology input and then missing something is fundamentally dangerous. If clinician's have any sense they would actually resist taking on any more imaging interpretation beyond the most basic; they'd be opening themselves up to a whole new range of potential legal and ethical difficulties as well as a new source of a never ending workload.  Also reporting time for a clinician is time away from clinics, wards and theatre etc - variety might be nice for the clinician (and their private practice) but it is not necessarily cost effective or efficient for the NHS. A radiologist meanwhile spends all their time looking at images becoming very fast, and are also trained and experienced enough to catch all the incidental findings (that can come back with major ramifications for the patient and for the clinician). For me, the best solution is to train more Radiologists and/or reduce unnecessary imaging (the culture has shifted to ""don't question, just do it"" in many Radiology departments and it's frankly very wasteful)."
Radiology,2m9v2v,stumpovich,2,Fri Nov 14 17:03:09 2014 UTC,Do clinical teams have enough time to look at all the scans they order? Will they miss important findings by only looking at their own interests?
Radiology,2m9v2v,stumpovich,3,Fri Nov 14 16:16:15 2014 UTC,"Do clinical teams have enough time to look at all the scans they order?    I doubt it.  Our giant new hospital which opens next spring is going to be ""see and discharge"" meaning they're going to expect radiologist report on everything immediately 24/7 so they don't need to admit people.  I don't really want to be a part of this sort of model, so I'm going to look elsewhere for consultant posts in the next two years.  The fact is, locally at least,  is that clinicians are becoming more and more dependent on us.  Increasing paucity of clinical information, reducing quality of requests, much more junior people having referral rights, including nurses, and supine management element which allows new ""protocols"" to be created without radiology input meaning less thought goes into referrals, generating more and more work for us.  I know ""credentialing"" is now a thing, but it'll be ages before A&E docs can read their own CT heads for example.    In Scotland, up to 60% of consultant job adverts each year have fewer applicants than posts,  or no applicants at all.  Most departments are understaffed, and people from city hospitals are moving to DGHs to escape the mounting pressure...  Yet, NHS Scotland won't increase radiology reg posts..."
Radiology,2m9v2v,TardisTechnologist,2,Fri Nov 14 17:12:12 2014 UTC,This has been the model in most US radiology departments for a few years now. 24/7 ED coverage with TAT (turn around time) of 30 minutes or less for reports.

Are they simply preliminary reports to replace the need for a ""hotseat"" radiologist?"

Radiology,2m9v2v,Yellowbenzene,2,Fri Nov 14 18:23:54 2014 UTC,"What are UK consultant radiologist salaries like? If feasible, raise them to increase interest. Also, perhaps consider a temporary pathway to allow UK credentialing for US/Canadian/etc grads? I would certainly consider working in the UK if the salaries were competitive enough, considering the poor radiology job market in the US. However, this is unlikely to work if salaries aren't at least somewhat comparable. For example, I'd go to work in Canada in a heartbeat, but probably not western Europe since they pay so much less, and I've got 330k of loans to pay."
Radiology,2m9v2v,Yellowbenzene,1 point,Fri Nov 14 14:48:25 2014 UTC,"Consultant salary basic is between £75,249 - £101,451, depending on region and number of years experience. Add to this a banding of up to 40% for on-call work, plus any private work and you are looking at at least £150K pa (about $240K). I don't know many earning more than £200K. You are correct in saying the salary may not be attractive to US doctors, but take into account living costs are lower in the US than the UK, but we don't have massive student debts to pay off like you do.  Within the NHS it is not feasible to raise wages (we have only had one pay rise in the past 8 years and that was at 1% which was less than inflation). We are stuck for money and trying to save costs at all levels. Meanwhile, we are absolutely inundated with scans from all specialities. Part of the problem is overuse of radiology (especially X-ray and ultrasound - it seems literally everyone has at least one of those each admission), partly lack of trained radiologists, partly lack of subspecialist knowledge to report niche studies.  Some have looked at a pay-per-read model - but this has been proven to reduce accuracy and increase errors as suppliers pressurise radiologists to report more in less time. For instance, I have been offered do 3 hour 'backlog' shifts for £350 in which I'm expected to read 10 CT studies. That's 24 minutes per study, at £35 each. Considering that these can be complex studies (Cancer staging/response in Head/Neck/Chest/Abdo/Pelvis) with multiple comparisons with previous imaging to be made, plus a lack of decent clinical information requiring searching through the information system for clues, it can be hard to reach this target."
Radiology,2m9v2v,Yellowbenzene,3,Fri Nov 14 15:08:30 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I suppose it heavily depends on your case mix. I would say that 24 minutes per study is extremely slow by US standards, but for the complicated onc followups a single study can definitely take upwards of 45 minutes.  We probably average around 4-5 CTs an hour, with surge volume going up to maybe 10-12, which can backlog you for a little bit. On call, I rarely spend more than 5-6 minutes on a study, although most of the cases are single pathology ED type cases. I'm going into ED radiology as my field, so that's approximately the pace that I'll be maintaining for most of my shifts. Our consultant staff actually reads faster. It definitely leads to errors in interpretation, but I would say that most of the time, it's good enough for ER radiology. Those 4mm lung nodules or rib fractures are rarely important. It's just unfortunate because the medicolegal climate in the US is very unforgiving.  Honestly, making 150k GBP a year to read 10 CTs per 3 hours sounds like a GREAT deal. I wouldn't mind a cut in compensation in the US if it meant a correspond cut in workload. Unfortunately I don't really have any financial freedom until my loans are paid off, but once they are, I plan on going part time ASAP."
Radiology,2m9v2v,MalcontentUK,2,Fri Nov 14 15:18:52 2014 UTC,"All my studies are cancer staging or follow-up, so we don't get the simple 5 min ED 'appy' reads! I'm often comparing a whole body CT with a PET or whole body MRI, and trying to figure out what chemo/rad the patient has had, which trial they are on etc. It gets tiring, and often takes longer than 24 minutes.  Those 3 hour sessions are 'out-of-hours' though, so they are done in addition to a normal working day."
Radiology,2m9v2v,rykh7,1 point,Fri Nov 14 15:22:24 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, completely different story then. I'll be happy if I never have to read a PET/CT or a restaging total body CT again."
Radiology,2m9v2v,neurad1,1 point,Fri Nov 14 15:25:32 2014 UTC,"What's the average volume like during the days?  I heard that Canadian radiologists actually work harder than US radiologists, although I don't have much first hand knowledge. They actually make more in most areas though."
Radiology,2m9v2v,neurad1,1 point,Fri Nov 14 15:27:45 2014 UTC,"Average volume? Very variable, depends if you're doing CT, PET or MR. But it's always busy!"
Radiology,2m9v2v,neurad1,1 point,Fri Nov 14 15:37:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah to be honest £150,000 a year is not typical nationally. NHS Consultant's pay scale starts at £75,249 and then increases steadily to £84,667 over 5 years; it then stays unchanged for another 5 years before jumping to £90,263 at the beginning of year 10, and then jumps to £95,860 at the beginning of year 15 and then finally jumps to £101,451 at the beginning of year 20. That's a full time job (in theory 40 hour week but usually more than that + oncall) and any private work is then done in your own time. The amount of private work available is variable depending on where you are in the UK, there is a lot of competition for it and it's a small pie, plus you have to be pretty flexible and schmooze clinicians to get the work in the first place (which can compromise your independence in your NHS job...).  On top of all that, you pay 40% income tax above roughly £42,000 income AND 12% national insurance contributions (another tax) AND another chunk equivalent to 13.5% is now taken in NHS Pension contributions (you can opt out of this but the NHS pension is still good value despite the cost). Private work will attract income tax and possibly national insurance depending how you've set it up. NHS Consultants are still well paid compared to the general population in the UK, but they are not well paid compared to other senior professionals in other fields (Bankers for example...).  And for comparison - according to this RSNA news piece a (median) average diagnostic radiologist in the USA would get $453,216 ""compensation"" (I assume that is a euphemism for income?) - thats a whopping £289,477. A lot of websites refer to this as ""salary"" but I find that hard to believe; I assume it is revenue and business costs have to come out of that? If not... it's crazy money! Although I bet it's crazy hours too."

In all seriousness you've missed the point. 3D recons look great but they are diagnostically useless. You need to see what is going on INSIDE the anatomy. How are you going to see a liver met inside a 3D model of the liver surface? How can you tell it's enhancement pattern? It's diffusion characteristics?  There's much more to radiology than looking at anatomy."

CT is for the subtle fractures and 3D recons suck for that, anyways.  3D makes for pretty pictures of an aneurysm, but for a subtle dissection it's shit, you need to be on the axials and MPRs for that.  It will make more sense with more exposure, but in short, no."

Radiology,2ls0qq,burstabcess,1 point,Sun Nov 9 21:58:56 2014 UTC,"3D recon is sort of in it's Wild West stage of development right now.  Lots of promise and opportunity, but there are many risks associated with relying on the particular processing algorithms as well.  Each vendor provides their own flavor of processing algorithm and they're all slightly different.  For one thing, the end user is provided more than ample opportunity to misconfigure them and never realize it.  They're not entirely useless, but we must tread softly with the technology, IMHO.  I'm working on a project right now working with stereoscopic visualization equipment and there are some significant benefits to performing these recons - though there are some drawbacks.  For one, you can rotate a virtual camera to look backwards, which is not practical with a scope.  You can also reposition the camera without displacing or interfering with tissue.  Furthermore, patient comfort is improved and complications are reduced.  This is somewhat offset by the need to go in with a scope for confirmation anyway, but  I believe recons can reduce procedure time substantially.  We're working on image analysis algorithms that are getting better and better at isolating features inside anatomy.  We're a LONG way from replacing the human eye and brain here though.  Humans are really good pattern recognition machines, but they can also think on their feet and analyze on the fly, where imaging algorithms must be proofed to avoid false positives and ensure they don't ""aggressively interpret"" images.  In the example of a liver met (which we haven't looked at), sufficient processing should be able to perform contrast enhancement and coloration, but the tuning of such an algorithm is where the challenge is in order to minimize false positives.  For many metastatic diseases, PET combined with 3D recon may become the gold standard in a few years.  The advantages of 3D recon are also pretty solid for surgical planning.  We can readily 3D  print the anatomy as well as visualize it stereoscopically."
Radiology,2ls0qq,Iatros,7,Mon Nov 10 14:54:57 2014 UTC,"You learn to differentiate normal from abnormal by repetitive exposure to the same type of imaging and anatomy.

Even advanced computer mapping can only go so far to pick up abnormalities, because every body is different."

It's tough to scan through adipose tissue so with bigger patients you usually have to press harder to get a decent image.  (You can get a sense of what I mean by grabbing your phone, gripping it, and pressing it firmly into your thigh.  Then rotate it 45 degrees back and forth while still pressing firmly.)   Also, with the case of bedside ultrasound, you often have to contort yourself a bit to scan in rooms that aren't really set up for it, which can hurt your back.   Anecdotally, taller techs with bigger hands seem to have an easier time of it - at least the ones I've worked with.  I don't mean to scare anyone away from a great career - but it's always wise to be aware of the pitfalls."

There are lots of opportunities to cross train in other modalities (ct, mri, dms, cardiovascular, interventional, etc) and after the initial schooling for rad, it can be done through self study and cross training.   Also, I found that dms was a little more subjective? Or perhaps harder for me to figure out what I'm looking at. With rad, it's very black and white (ha, see what I did there?). Mind you, since I'm not a radiologist there are lots of subtleties that I miss, but I absolutely know when I have good diagnostic images. :)"

Radiology,2l5d40,Yellowbenzene,5,Mon Nov 3 11:02:26 2014 UTC,"Multiparametric prostate MR incorporates three different elements: anatomy, diffusion and perfusion.  These scans are performed on a 3T MR with an endorectal coil against the prostate gland, with 20mg Buscopan on board to relax the bowel.  Anatomy:   T1W axial - FOV whole pelvis (for assessing post-biopsy haemorrhage, nodal sites and bones - not included in this upload) T2W axial - FOV whole pelvis  T2W axial - FOV prostate - exquisite prostatic anatomical definition. Most tumours arise in the peripheral zone, typically a lighter band around the back of the prostate. Tumour appears low signal in comparison to the higher signal peripheral zone. T2W coronal & sagittal - FOV prostate - optional sequences, can help with locating tumour.   Diffusion:   b-value series axial - FOV prostate - different centers use different b values to assess the diffusion of water across tissue. Some use low b values (0-300), others high (up to 1500). The jury is out on which is most useful, but I prefer 100-1000. Tumour appears high signal on these sequences. ADC map - axial - FOV prostate - the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is calculated using the b values in  monoexponential fit to create a map of the diffusion throughout the FOV. Darker areas are regions where diffusion is lower (i.e restricted) which indicates dense tissue, most likely tumour.   Perfusion:    Contrast enhanced - axial - FOV - short T1 volumes of the whole prostate are taken at 10-15 second intervals over 2-3 minutes after IV injection of Gadolinium. Peak enhancement of the gland occurs at about 1 minute. Dynamic Contrast Enhancement maps are calculated on bespoke viewing machines to create colour maps (not included in the post) indicating enhancement areas, hence tumour which is inherently more vascular due to angiogenesis.   Scan time 34 minutes at our center, plus time for set-up, cannulation, coil insertion."

Radiology,2l5d40,notgoodatcomputer,1 point,Mon Nov 3 16:11:31 2014 UTC,"T staging is based on clinical exam not MRI findings    TNM staging is purely imaging dependent as far as I know. How can you say it's T2a vs T2b on clinical examination? No-one's finger is that sensitive! Plus you can't feel nodes or bone mets with your finger in the rectum.   Do you think its ok to skip the random biopsies off study for first diagnosis   Absolutely. All the evidence shows that multiparametirc MRI is extremely accurate at detecting clinically significant tumours.  Random biopsy not only provides false negatives (by missing tumour) but underestimates tumour size. MRI produces far fewer false results, and tells us tumour size and aggression on the functional sequences. In addition, targeted biopsy produces far fewer side effects and complications.   Pts who are considering AS do need to be counselled and followed by someone that knows how to do so   Yes, certainly this is true. There is nothing stopping the imaging department from having cancer nurse specialists explaining the pathways, risks, treatment options etc. I see no need for a urologist to spend time counselling.   We've had people miss the right bits on MRI informed TRUS bx   I blame urologists for this. If radiologists stood up for themselves and took prostate biopsy back from their hands we would be able to provide a much better service, more accurate, quicker and cheaper. I could biopsy people in-bore during their MR, or fuse the MR with the US straight away. Why send them to a urologist with zero training in ultrasound to do a biopsy based on a report? It's all about billing and procedures, so let's bring the cash flow back to us, the experts who invented the procedure in the first place by doing it better."
Radiology,2l5d40,notgoodatcomputer,2,Mon Nov 3 16:30:41 2014 UTC,"As you know bone mets aren't T category.  historically T2a vs T2b has absolutely been determined based on palpation alone, as it is in every center in the world that doesn't have MRI. Doesn't mean its any good, but it has relevance ie gyne malignancies going by FIGO staging to standardize treatments across the world. Also I know you're just saying T1c to mean no imaging detected lesion but of course if the biospy is negative, they are not T-anything.  Most pts we see with elevated PSA and negative bx have a repeat confirmatory bx within a year. Perhaps this could be avoided if they also had a prebx MR showing no lesion.

Radiology,2ky8sj,Rickettsiarickettsii,10,Sat Nov 1 03:51:49 2014 UTC,"Several reasons:    The IR lifestyle resembles the surgeon's lifestyle more than the diagnostic radiologist's lifestyle. Depending on how many other interventionalists are in your practice group, you'll be on call once every 3-4 weeks, and you will get called in the middle of the night to come in for an emergent pelvic embolization or other case. Many people who go into diagnostic radiology do so in part due to the nice lifestyle, and it makes no sense to them to go into a fellowship with a much worse lifestyle. Occupational hazards. IR involves relatively heavy exposure to radiation, and you also need to wear heavy lead aprons all day. Many people don't like knowing that they're constantly exposing themselves to radiation that will increase their risk for cancer, however miniscule. Plus, wearing lead suits all day can get tiring and end up causing you back pain.  Procedures. Some people go into radiology to avoid patients; other people go into radiology to avoid procedures. These people would obviously avoid IR.    These reasons being said, the IR job market is supposed to be better than most of the other subspecialties, and many radiology residents nowadays seem to choose a diagnostic radiology residency specifically because they are interested in IR. I'm guessing that the pendulum is swinging the other way, and soon IR is also going to become an oversaturated field."
Radiology,2ky8sj,qxrt,4,Sat Nov 1 05:56:31 2014 UTC,Try once every 3-4 days!  IR is incredibly understaffed in my area.
Radiology,2ky8sj,Yellowbenzene,7,Sat Nov 1 10:40:44 2014 UTC,"The place that I'm at, IR docs are on call for one whole week every 3-4 weeks. That's the equivalent of call once every 3-4 days; I didn't mean they were on call only one day every 3-4 weeks. Sorry about the misunderstanding!"
Radiology,2ky8sj,qxrt,16,Sat Nov 1 19:08:25 2014 UTC,"No. IR is not ""gathering steam."" It is different and always has been. It's been very popular and in demand for the last 15 - 17 years or so and for good reason. We take care of a lot of patient and  do the procedures nobody else wants to or can't.  In the world of radiology there has really always been two camps - those who do procedures, and those who don't. For those who do procedures daily or nearly every day, the interventional world is second hand, comfortable, and easy, in so far as each procedure makes sense, is comfortable for the patient, and takes only a few minutes. For those who don't routinely do procedures, putting a simple catheter into someone's peritoneum or pleural space is a big deal. Each procedure creates anxiety and angst not only in the patient but moreover in the doctor. Understand, I'm not talking about a complex angiogram or embolization, I'm simply talking about everyday fluid removal. For those docs who aren't comfortable, they'll do anything to get out from under the pressure. Sticking a needle, or catheter in another human being is hard if you aren't comfortable and confident in your ability. I believe it's a fundamental human tendency or desire to NOT hurt someone else. If you aren't comfortable, you'll tend to avoid it.  I have a friend who is a radiologist specializing in nuclear medicine. He would rather personally undergo colonoscopy without sedation than have to perform even the simplest of procedures on another person. Me, hell, as an Interventionalist I'll try anything once. But ask me to read a mammogram - yeah, no. I don't go there.  Different specialties aren't just that - different. Much like personalities. None is better than another, they are just different and it takes a bunch of them to make for a complete service."
Radiology,2ky8sj,GallodelCielo,3,Sat Nov 1 04:40:06 2014 UTC,"I guess it depends on the set up. IR is certainly regarded as generally riskier here in the UK and many trainees do steer well clear, but it is still a very popular and even over-subscribed sub-speciality - it's certainly not ""less desirable"" as OP asks.  IR has long been a separate sub-speciality but it's workload has become much much greater, particularly with the increase in complex Vascular and Urological Interventional radiology procedures. BUT other interventional procedures - Biopsies, Chest and Peritoneal Drainages, nephrostomy tube removals etc - remain largely a General or other sub-spec radiologist's role in most NHS hospitals. There is just far too much interventional work to leave it exclusively to Interventionalists - they're just too busy with the complex work, and that work load is expanding rapidly as the IR cannibalises the work of Surgical specialities.  Diagnostic radiologists largely have no choice but to know and be competent in doing basic and even certain complex procedures, with only the most complex or risky Biospy, Drain etc going straight to IR. Not all Diagnostic radiologists want to be involved in any intervention, and although some Consultants manage to stay away from the general stuff, most can't get away from it all together as most have a sub-speciality interest which will have some IR attached - Chest Radiologists do the lung biopsies, H&N do the neck biopsies/drainages, GI radiologists will do periteoneal and complex abcess drainages etc. And much of the work that used to be done ""blind"" on the wards has moved to Radiology - it's safer, and frankly our Junior Doctors are no longer trained well enough to do them blind.  In fact the problem in my Department is that our Interventional Radiologists get little time to do much other than be in the IR Suite, Recovery area or Theatres - the irony is that the backlog of IR related diagnostic radiology (e.g. Vascular CTs) is being passed back to the other general radiologists. IR is currently creeping towards being a purely interventional sub-speciality, while Diagnostic radiology has moved back to include more intervention."

Radiology,2ky8sj,syprox,3,Sat Nov 1 10:07:57 2014 UTC,"It's a bit different here in the UK.  To do IR, we have to competitively reapply for an extended training post.  Once you're in it, you finish up as an IR rather than a diagnostic doctor.  I think it means you're stuck doing IR from that point onwards.    There are hardly any IR consultants in my area, meaning working arrangements are horrific.  Colleagues in my department are often up all night and then need to go to work all day the following day.  Our government has also just reduced funding for IR so it won't get any better.  The RCR stipulates that drainage, biopsy etc are core skills for diagnostic radiologists.  I'm getting good at these finally and plan to do lots of them when I finish my training.  I have tried angioplasty,  embolisation etc and its fun, but I don't want to do that stuff for the rest of my life.

Radiology,2klrha,Petrichora,7,Tue Oct 28 23:06:08 2014 UTC,In my area (US) a physician is required to be in the area and available but need not be in the actual same building during contrast administration. The actual definitions about how far away they can be is pretty vague in CMS's regulations as I recall.  If the center was on a hospital campus/medical center they're probably operating within regulations as far as contrast coverage goes.   That said most MR techs are going to be better at doing sticks than radiologists / other docs anyways. The tech gets a lot more practice at it. Though I did work with one rad who had put himself through med school working as a phlebotomist. He could stick anybody.
Radiology,2klrha,Presia,2,Tue Oct 28 23:15:08 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that a physician probably was in house somewhere since you need a doctor available in case of a contrast reaction.

Radiology,2klrha,Aracosse,2,Tue Oct 28 23:13:12 2014 UTC,"An outpatient center sometimes works with doctors offices well and may be cheaper for the patient.

Radiology,2klrha,BethLynn85,8,Wed Oct 29 01:06:10 2014 UTC,"9 times?!?  Really?  As others have mentioned here, there are probably some issues which make you into what healthcare workers call a ""hard stick."" However, what strikes me as unusual is anyone having the courage to continue poking someone over and over up to 9 times. I understand that this sounds like a small clinic and employees/resources are scarce. Even then, I would rather apologize to the patient and reschedule them (or refer back to their physician). In an outpatient setting, 3 times seems to be the generally accepted limit of tries. However, this being an independent imaging center I can also see them being pressured to maintain the referral. I've seen some angry managers in a huff over losing a patient due to bad veins/poor technique."

Radiology,2khtuw,derwreck,3,Tue Oct 28 01:59:01 2014 UTC,The point I was getting at is that you have to roll up your sleeves and get that patient where they need to be. They're not going to help you if you just ask.
Radiology,2khtuw,lithuaniac,2,Tue Oct 28 02:06:00 2014 UTC,"I agree 100% but would take it a step farther. Don't be afraid to strongly encourage the patient to do what they need to so you can get the properly positioned image. At the end of the day pushing their pain tolerance a little to get a peoperly positioned image that actually diagnoses the problem is doing whats best.  This was one of my biggest issues when I started working. I hated hearing them complain about a position because I felt horrible for causing them more pain. But if you don't, then you risk a misdiagnosis or more radiation.   I find, too, that being able to explain why you're doing a certain position really goes a long way to getting a good image. Someone is more likely to push through pain into a true lateral (for instance) when they know that it can show a dislocation/slipped vertebrae/fracture. Plus, it helps show that we really are educated professionals and not just button pushers."
Radiology,2khtuw,cherryfristado,2,Tue Oct 28 00:06:25 2014 UTC,I would add to this that you don't ask a patient if they can move a certain direction. I find that a lot of patients will say they can't move a certain way but usually with a little coaxing they can get into the position that you need them in. Now this is certainly within reason and you need to use your judgement. I wouldn't be twerking a patient around if the AP shows an obvious fracture.
Radiology,2khtuw,vaporking23,20,Tue Oct 28 13:05:50 2014 UTC,"Don't always do what it says on the request card.

Radiology,2khtuw,Aggietoker,1 point,Tue Oct 28 19:13:53 2014 UTC,"If we have any doubt about an order we get in contact with the ordering or call a radiologist for assistance. Some ER physicians ask us to change an order and we will do it because we know/trust them, while others we are not so comfortable with, (lets face it, not all doctors or nurses are good at their job) we make them fix their own orders."
Radiology,2khtuw,TardisTechnologist,1 point,Tue Oct 28 19:22:08 2014 UTC,"It's similar here, but changing. There is currently a push to have technologists in the ER ordering exams, with triage nurses or physicians referring patients with, for example, ""X-ray L Upper extremity"", where they will be sent to x-ray, have a history taken and the appropriate exam and views ordered and performed by the tech.  It should help reduce those reqs saying ""Hx elbow injury. Ordered: Forearm, Elbow, Humerus"", and would also help reduce the number of cases where a thumb is ordered and the patient comes back for wrist scaphoid views which we knew would have to be done anyway."
Radiology,2khtuw,mamacat49,8,Fri Oct 31 09:21:21 2014 UTC,"A tech at our facility was just fired for doing the ""wrong"" side--even though that was the side that hurt, that the patient complained about. My guess is the nurse put the order in wrong. But that can't be proved. So, fire the tech. We have NO autonomy to change anything. Nurses have all of the power because they have the numbers and they can order anything. They might be good at NURSING, but the suck at ordering x-rays."
Radiology,2khtuw,Glonn,3,Wed Nov 5 21:59:24 2014 UTC,"That's why as a student I always ask the patient where the pain is and tell them what I'm going to xray.

Examples. er doctor ordered right knee. I talk to the patient, patient goes ""it's my left side not right"". I get order changed by talking to physician. I go to get patient, patient goes ""it's my left upper leg (femur)  not knee...)"". I tell doctor again and he goes to talk to patient. Exam corrected."

Radiology,2khtuw,BariumEnema,6,Tue Oct 28 01:12:05 2014 UTC,"The only problem is that in an er/hospital setting, treatment isn't always based upon rad reports.  ER docs, orthopedics, and cardiologists interpret film.  So if the orthopedic surgeon wants 4 views of the shoulder even though your protocol is 2, I'd give him 4.  Sometimes the er doc is ready for post redux film before the first set is even dictated. It's a fine balance keeping everyone happy and doing the best thing for the patient.  But in my experience, when there is a disagreement between radiologists and treating physicians, treating physicians ALWAYS win."
Radiology,2khtuw,Glonn,6,Tue Oct 28 01:49:38 2014 UTC,In my experience the rads win.
Radiology,2khtuw,BariumEnema,3,Tue Oct 28 02:36:35 2014 UTC,Mine too. That's also why my hospital has set exams that radiologists made to be ordered in mosr cases. If they want extra exams they ask the radiologist to tell us if they decide it's worth it.
Radiology,2khtuw,Glonn,3,Tue Oct 28 06:49:44 2014 UTC,"Of course rads set protocols, but are you are telling me if an orthopedic surgeon specifies in his order that he wants a grashey, axial, and y view (and your protocol is internal/external) you have to talk to rad and see if it's ok?

Radiology,2khtuw,Aggietoker,2,Tue Oct 28 19:59:55 2014 UTC,"You'll see it.  Outpatient orders often specify views outside of protocol.  Orthopedic surgeons often order out of protocol too.  You'll really see it in an er that has orthopedic residents.  They'll want all sorts of goofy stuff to rule out something they just learned about.  They don't trust themselves, so they want to see more info than you can safely give them.  Just make sure to make them manipulate the pt if they insist on the crazy views.  Often, they don't realize the positioning implications of the images ordered on that shattered humerus."

But yes asking the right questions is important, but I wouldn't start to change the exam from hip to knee even if the patient says the pain mostly is at the knee.  But it's really a judgment call in each patient case and that is a part of what makes the whole profession so fascinating (rad. stud. here).

For lateral humerus projection, if the patient is able to, have them place their hand on their hip like the book teaches you, but instead of rotating their body (creates an OID gap), have them put their hand behind their back.

Seems to work every time.  Also for lumbar spines, if you collimate to the cassette or image receptor first (with all of your distances correct), then just change the width to be wide enough and make sure xiphoid is just inside your beam, you pretty much always get a great AP on a 24x30."

Sit the head of the bed up as far as it'll go, or as far as the patient will allow, then do the following:  Put the patient in trendelenburg if the patient is prone to sliding down in the bed (if pt had a stroke or is ornery).  Reverse trendelenburg for a more upright picture if the patient cannot sit-up 90 degrees (many many instances this is very useful).    If they are a huge person, sometimes you don't need to put a board behind their back for a lateral chest. Their back fat will be enough to separate them from the mattress..  Almost always I put a slight angle caudad on the tube when doing odontoid films on a patient with a c-collar.  If that doesn't work, I'll put an extremely small angle wedge sponge (1 or 2 degrees) under the back of their head."

For example, on a lateral wrist, slightly rotate it back to get the unnatural superimposition they're looking for. Same with lateral chests, use the paravertebral gutter technique (rotating the chest inward) to counter divergent rays and get perfect superimposition of the ribs."

Not so much a positioning hack but a general tip, good communication. Good communication is fundamental in establishing a good rapport with your ordering/er physicians and really anyone and everyone you work with.

Abdomen: Find the crest and go one finger down (for some reason whenever I center right at my finger, on the crest, I'm to high and miss the symphysis)  Mobile Chest: If the patient is able, lean the bed straight up and angle the tube slightly down from horizontal to get those damn clavicles out of the apices. (10-15 degrees usually works for me) If they can't lean all the way up, then it's back to Merrill's.   Oblique L-spine: (For the sake of simplicity, I'll describe the left oblique with the patient's head on your left.) Tell the patient to put their right hand on their left shoulder, and bend their right knee. Then tell them to roll slightly up on their side, without sliding their hips or shoulders to do it. Don't roll them all the way to 45 degrees. 100% of the time it is over-rotated. Only go 25-30 degrees (a trick I like to use to achieve this, is to get a 45 degree sponge and only have them roll half the angle of the sponge, and I let them lay on the sponge). As far as centering, you can go by the book, or you can do what I do. I stand at the head of the table and visualize the spine running down their back, starting at their neck.

Radiology,2khtuw,turanga__leela,1 point,Tue Oct 28 01:19:57 2014 UTC,"With my own system, I use my fingers literally. Over the years I've used landmarks like the ASIS, and compared the distance/shape of  two fingers to center over the desired anatomy. I would practice by reviewing the images and trying out different finger combos for CR placement.As an example: I'll use my hand width to position above the crest on lumbar obliques, with my middle finger on the ASIS,centering where my index finger rests naturally. For AP/PA chests on large patients,I palpate the medial aspect of the clavicle. I make sure there is at least 1"" of film above that spot. It eliminates centering too high due to excess tissue at the shoulders. Long story short, pay attention to anatomy, find correspondences with your fingers and landmarks,and don't be afraid to palpate the patient. You'll be faster and accurate,which employers highly value given the need for greater volume to drive revenues."

The labrum is the socket itself, meaning  your shoulder blade is flat and your humeral head is round. The labrum mates the two together.  A cyst is just a glob of fat that grows on occasion and is general not an issue.   Have your primary care Dr go over the report with you in detail and see what he or she recommends for treatment.

Radiology,2k8mr5,rainbowbrite22,6,Fri Oct 24 22:33:00 2014 UTC,It's a common thing we see in radiology and nothing to worry about.    During gestation the embryonal neural tube normally closes completely and this forms the central nervous system. Sometimes it doesn't fully close and this results in vertebrae (or other things) that are not joined posteriorly. In some patients this can be symptomatic (i.e. big lump coming out of their back at birth).  In other people it is just something we see on an x-ray or CT scan and comment on because we are smart :)  It just means that you have an unfused bone at S1. I tend to not use that term when I dictate because it scares people.  I usually call it a posterior fusion defect. Nothing to worry about!

Personally, I've never encountered another technologist that has worked this way, but I have met nurses that do. The term used in that case is ""agency nursing,"" and basically it means a company has nursing staff ""on demand."" Say a hospital is unexpectedly short staffed and cant fill in the gap with PRNs, they would contact an agency nursing Co to have some staff fill in. As I understand, these employees still work for the agency, but have temp privileges with the facility.

What I hate about the online format of CEs is having to sit through a poorly acted and monotone 50 min video. This site allows you to read articles instead, and take a post-test just like any other CE service.  I also have to attend a seminar every 2 yrs because my state restricts the number of ""self-study"" CEs to 21hrs :("

Membership in the ASRT gives you monthly journals, and if you do the quizzes in them it will take care of your CE requirements. They also keep track of your CEs online and they send them to the ARRT themselves, so you don't have to worry about it.  Passing advanced registry examinations will also take care of your requirements for the biennium. I for instance have taken the CT and MR boards, and that has taken care of two separate biennium's for me."

The thing is currently an ASRT membership wouldnt be enough for you as the journals you get between now and your biennium wouldn't cover enough CEs. The way it works is they give you just enough credits over the 12(bi-monthly) issues to cover your term. While a membership can help in the future and it will help towards this one it won't be enough.

I just want to make it clear that this isn't about either of those things: I'm gonna end up doing whatever my ortho recommends on Monday regardless of what Reddit says, and I'm not in a state of indecision about anything, nor do I think I've received any bad medical advice that needs a 2nd opinion. My only motivation for posting this is that I won't know the ""official"" results until Monday and I'm curious/impatient. I'd also like to learn something through this experience and my ortho won't have the time/desire to point out things and educate me like you all could. I hope that clears things up!

Felt a slight strain in right shoulder when lightly throwing a football (without proper warming up/stretching) in July. Took a few days off to rest it, then aggravated the injury in the gym doing overhead weightlifting work (heavy push jerks, to be exact). Felt stronger pain after workout (but no specific moment of ""tearing"" during) so took a couple weeks off. Tried getting back into light activity (golf, etc), but pain came back and got worse. I have now done no exercise for last 7 weeks but pain remains.  Pain isn't sharp or acute, but rather a dull ache that never goes away. I have normal range of motion and good strength (clinical exam was pretty normal and didn't indicate anything specific) but I feel discomfort when raising my arm above my head, like when I'm reaching up for something. That's definitely the worst: when I have to go overhead. After 7 weeks of rest I thought it would be better but it just simply isn't improving.  Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

There is a world of difference between the two including 10 years or more of training."
Radiology,2juiso,GallodelCielo,1 point,Tue Oct 21 04:01:23 2014 UTC,I definitely want to become a radiologist. I went through the basics already to get a perspective on the technical side. I mainly wanted to know about the personal side to the career.
Radiology,2juiso,GallodelCielo,5,Tue Oct 21 04:15:24 2014 UTC,"Is the schooling worth it - Yes, in my opinion it is. I will say, med school is damn expensive and if you plan to pay for it with loans, you'll be in repayment a very long time.  How rigorous? That's tough to say. What is easy for me might be hard for you. Everybody has different levels of things they consider rigorous. Parts of the training are fun. Hell, they're a blast. Parts are long and onerous. Nights on call when all your friends are out having fun get a little old sometimes. Parts, like preparing for the board exams are a downright bitch and you wonder if you'll survive.  How to start? That's easy - go to college and work your ass off so you can get into med school. Then work your ass off to get into a radiology residency program (they are very competitive.) Pass the boards and profit.  Lifestyle? It's changing. Radiology used to have one of the best lifestyles in medicine. Today it's a 24 / 7 demanding service. In some groups/ practices it is kind of like shift work. In others it's a bit different. It also depends on what type of radiology you practice. If you do only women's imaging, there isn't much call. As an Interventionalist in my practice I half the year on call. In general I get about 12 weeks off per year (but I get my ass kicked the other 40 weeks.)  Background? There is no specific background that's helpful. To be a radiologist you have to be dedicated and smart enough to get through the training. To be a good radiologist you just have to love what it is we do, then the studying and hard work comes easy.  Do I love it? In short, I used to. I love the job and I love the patients. I do procedures all day, so I see lots of patients and have a chance to work with great nurses and techs. More than anything else, I love that I can help people. I very much enjoy working as a consultant to surgeons and gastroenterologists, and nephrologists, and oncologists, and a bunch of other types of physicians. What I hate is what medicine is becoming. It's no longer about the patient. It's about survey results and jumping through federal hoops to get paid. It's political correctness on steroids. It's about  making everyone happy  instead of doing the right thing. That shit gets old. It's about lawyers and insurance companies and hospital administrations, and a ton of other people all trying very hard to take the money you earned or not to pay you.  The real question - Would I do it again? Probably, maybe. I don't know. Some days you couldn't force me into medicine again. On other days all the bullshit is worth it when a family member says thanks for helping their son or daughter or mom or dad."
Radiology,2juiso,weasler7,1 point,Tue Oct 21 04:44:38 2014 UTC,Hmm I have a few questions for you regarding IR. I'm trying to gauge what IR work environments are like in other places.  Are you in private or academic practice?  What is your typical day on call like?  Are you running an IR clinic?
Radiology,2juiso,GallodelCielo,1 point,Wed Oct 22 03:54:44 2014 UTC,"I am in private practice but kind of a pseudo-academic setting in that we also teach residents. We do not run an IR clinic.  Call is hit or miss. Typically, during the week, I don't get called in very often. When I do it's usually for a dialysis catheter or a GI bleed, or something significant. I'd say we usually come in once during the week. On the weekend we are usually here 2 or 3 times and do a variety of cases. I've had weekends where I never got called and others where I got killed. It's always hit or miss and the nature of call."
Radiology,2juiso,ByRequestOnly,2,Wed Oct 22 17:09:41 2014 UTC,"Med student here. Med school is really hard, especially the first two years. You will study, and then study some more. It doesn't get easier after that but you kind of get used to it and after the first two years the testing intervals get a bit better. One puts in a ton of time studying and working during the prime of their life and gives up a large amount of social and personal time to get through training. Once you are through training it is a lot better. It is only worth it if you will be happy working as a doctor. I say this because you have to keep in mind that Radiology is one of the more competitive specialties. To get into med school you are looking at 75% percentile or more on the MCAT + good grades. Once you are in med school to be an average applicant for radiology you need to be in the 80th percentile for your board scores while in med school. Remember that we have already taken the top 25% from the MCAT and then the top 20% from that pool for med school boards. This leaves about 5% of all students that wanted to get into med school an average shot at a radiology match in their future. I say this not to discourage you but to remind you that it is a competitive road and one needs to be prepared to be happy in other fields of medicine that are not as competitive. You may also get surprised by what interests you once you get to med school and end up linking something completely different."
Radiology,2juiso,TheStaggeringGenius,2,Tue Oct 21 05:05:03 2014 UTC,"Keep in mind that even if you do go to med school, you may not get to be a radiologist. The question you should be asking yourself is do you want to go into medicine. Deciding on radiology (or any other specialty) comes much much later."

Radiology,2juiso,GallodelCielo,-4,Tue Oct 21 04:16:44 2014 UTC,"Just an RT Student. Being realistic here... a career as a Radiologist or any high level physician is going to change dramatically with changes in healthcare. Medical facilities, I believe, are going to continually hire more PA's, CNP's, and etc in an attempt to save money when they're just going to push all of the reading to 1-2 radiologists that may or may not be half way across the country.  The last time I saw or even got to speak with a radiologist was at my last clinical site and he decided to go back to school to be a lawyer. He claimed being a Radiologist was not what it used to be. Anyways, it seems like a rewarding field and pays extremely well for 15 YEARS OF COLLEGE! The education will only be tough if you end up having to pay for all of it but if you don't have any external obligations you'll have an easier time learning and being successful. If you're good enough to get into those really prestigious schools there is a good chance they'll have a way to pay most if not all of your total tuition fees as they commonly do for 80% of students.  Not what you're looking for but some things to consider."
Radiology,2juiso,TokenGestures,6,Tue Oct 21 13:32:28 2014 UTC,"Ahhhh, no.   Radiologists will still be n demand in the future. In fact, I might even go so far as to say they will likely be more in demand as imaging becomes more and more a primary part of diagnosis. I also disagree that radiologists will be located half way across the country. In hospitals where this is being tried today, it seems to fail. Local physicians and patients want their radiologists to be local. They want a body close by to do procedures, answer questions, and review studies with.  You do not have to get into a prestigious undergrad to get into medical school (in fact, I think a prestigious undergrad might make it more difficult for the typical student to get in.) And, I can assure you that enrollment in a prestigious medical school has no bearing on the student's ability to pay for tuition. Ethnicity and gender have a much bigger impact on available ""free money"" than anything else. It's a fact of our society today.   As to income, yep, we do okay, BUT, keep in mind we read more studies in a shorter period of time, we work much longer hours, and we've seen about a 25% loss in income over the last 5-8 years. Yes, this is going to get worse."

Radiology,2jpx1p,yomaster19,1 point,Mon Oct 20 14:27:30 2014 UTC,Thanks for posting this! I got my first comp last week. I'm super excited and crazy scared now! Post-comp is so much more pressure than comping actually is!
Radiology,2jpx1p,SassafrasSprite,3,Mon Oct 20 02:19:18 2014 UTC,Just wait until you start recomping! By then you have the experience and confidence though! Are you in your first year?
Radiology,2jpx1p,peedzllab,1 point,Mon Oct 20 03:47:32 2014 UTC,Why is recomping worse?? And yes I am. We just started upper extremities. Are you second year?
Radiology,2jpx1p,SassafrasSprite,1 point,Mon Oct 20 04:18:04 2014 UTC,"Well, during first year in my site they give a bit of lead way for positioning errors, but when you hit second year (yes I am in my second year finally!) they really tighten up on the lead way. Which that is as it should be, we are irradiating people and need to make sure that we get it right the first time! To add to it, upper extremities really gave me a hard time, the elbow in particular. It all just clicked eventually but I struggled hard with the testing material."
Radiology,2jpx1p,peedzllab,1 point,Mon Oct 20 20:12:14 2014 UTC,"Ooh elbow and knee look hard. I'm super scared for spine though. But I'm sure that's miles away.    So do you mean they're less lenient about stuff like rotation and collimation or they'll just be really mean about cutting off anatomy and needing to take another?    My last site is all DR, I believe. So that'll be nice and easy next year. Although CR isn't actually hard at all."
Radiology,2jpx1p,SassafrasSprite,1 point,Mon Oct 20 20:22:24 2014 UTC,"They just want to make sure you do it right. So if we have to repeat it due to rotation then they wont let us comp it. I felt the same about the spine too, dont worry though! It is intimidating and that is all, to me it turned out to be the easiest to learn. The Z-joints were kinda hard, but other than that its not bad. The C-spine is the more difficult to learn."
Radiology,2jpx1p,peedzllab,1 point,Mon Oct 20 20:48:52 2014 UTC,"That's reassuring! I'm hoping recomping won't be bad at all. However, I am worried about the weird things that I won't see until months after we learned them. Then I'll get one one day and have to comp my first one!    One of our techs was telling us about the Scotty dogs in the spine. Is that the Z-joints?"
Radiology,2jpx1p,SassafrasSprite,1 point,Mon Oct 20 20:51:32 2014 UTC,"The scotty dog is what you see on the oblique lumbar spine. That is the transverse processe, pedicle, lamina and so on making the scotty dog. The Zygapophysial joint (Z- joint) is the space between the superior articular process of one vertebrae and the inferior articular process of the vertebrae above it. For that to probably make more sense you should look at a picture in your book, if you're anything like me I have to see it to actually understand it lol."
Radiology,2jjf3a,2defmouze,6,Fri Oct 17 18:32:54 2014 UTC,"MRI in Practice by Catherine Westbrook is, by far, the easiest read to understand MRI.   It is also the best priced book for MRI studies.  http://www.amazon.com/MRI-Practice-Catherine-Westbrook/dp/1444337432/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1413580430&sr=8-1&keywords=MRI+practice  http://www.iacionline.net/ is a great quiz site, but you do have to pay for an account.  A few of us got together and split $ for an account.  You may want to brush up on your sectional anatomy and pathology along with the textbook.  And you may want to check the requirements for the exam - it seems like ARRT may add on more stuff:   Beginning January 1, 2016, candidates must also document completion of 16 hours of structured education. Learn more about ARRT’s education requirements.   https://www.arrt.org/Certification/Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging  I took my registry in August 2013, and I recall that there was a lot of pelvis anatomy (female/male), calculcating phase/matrix/ETL.  The test won't tell you if a particular parameter is T1/T2 weighted, so you'll have to look at the numbers that they give you (figure it out first), then answer the actual questions.  Learn the cranial nerves and make sure you know the TE/TR values for white matter, gray matter, blood, CSF, etc.  (Come back and look at this post when you get closer to taking the MR registry.)    I'm not the best at math/physics, so I believe that patient safety, equipment, anatomy and pathology saved me!"

Yeah I keep abreast of the ARRT requirements and know that come 2016 they are requiring some education.. Not a problem though it gives me plenty of time and I may in fact take a class on Saturdays that will qualify anyway just in case.  Thanks again definitely hanging on to this advice :)  EDIT: I have this book unused for sectional anatomy.. bought it for the xray program which we never needed it for, lol.

Radiology,2jkt70,Dantonn,1 point,Sat Oct 18 18:44:48 2014 UTC,"Yeah, who knew? That's why I was confused when I was told that we probably wouldn't really see any skull or face X-rays. They said CT took that over too. But I never understood why."

Radiology,2jhg46,Leaves16,4,Fri Oct 17 03:21:17 2014 UTC,"Almost everyone I know just has the AS degree.  It is far more important to have certs in modalities and experience in those modalities than to have a a BS or MS degree, especially starting out.  Jobs are still pretty hard to find depending where you live.  I would get the basic RT with an AS degree and go from there.  Get a full time job and work as an RT and take whatever they offer you.  I wouldn't mess with a BS degree unless they offer and extra cert in that program like CT or MRI too besides the RT degree."
Radiology,2jhg46,battlebattlehooah,1 point,Fri Oct 17 07:37:34 2014 UTC,"Is an associate's degree pretty typical, then? The college near me that offers radiology tech does it as an associate's degree and I was wondering if that was standard or not. I'm not sure what I should be looking for in accreditation but JRCERT and ARRT both list it."
Radiology,2jhg46,whitecoatblackhat,2,Fri Oct 17 12:39:53 2014 UTC,"Unofficial answer - my teacher has a 4 year degree but now teaches the 2 year program. She said she feels like our 2 year program is harder because we're more rushed to cover the same general stuff, but also her 4 year program involved a lot of extra classes that had (what she describes as) nothing to do with radiologic technology."
Radiology,2jhg46,bretticusmaximus,0,Fri Oct 17 23:04:03 2014 UTC,"I noticed that. One school near me has a four-year program in one modality (not imaging-specific, I think it was nuclear medicine tech) and it struck me that there was a lot of ""padding""."
Radiology,2jhg46,whitecoatblackhat,4,Sat Oct 18 03:09:04 2014 UTC,"Keep in mind that professions tend to have ""mission creep"" - people constantly want more responsibility, more power, more pay, and they justify it by requiring more credentials (e.g., how physical therapy slowly transitioned over time into a PhD, so that they could call themselves 'doctors' and incrementally get pay-raises over ""just MS"" PTs).  What I'm saying is, today's ""just good enough"" credential may easily be under- or un-employable in 15 years. In NYC, for instance, the BS with multiple certs has become an unofficial standard. You can find work with less, but it's more difficult, and tends to be part-time jobs covering for full-timers.   I'd recommend going for the BS. Just my two cents."

Radiology,2jhg46,Todesengal,1 point,Fri Oct 17 23:04:00 2014 UTC,"Use your second year to explore another modality that you like to do, or at least peaks your interest more than the others, then find out what it takes to get into that.  My school let us do 2 week special rotations in other imaging departments so we could see all of our options in the field.  Do you like working in the hospital?  What is your favorite part? Which hospital type do you like the most? Do you like being busy and seeing different things everyday?  Look into the hiring requirements at a trauma center.  Are you looking for something different?  Do you want less gore in your life?  See what clinics like in the people that they hire.  Being in school means you have access to people who have worked in all of these settings, so you can ask them what they liked and didn't like about their experiences also.    There are mobile companies that take x-rays in people's homes.  Do you like to travel?  There are temp agencies that send you to different hospitals across the country for a few weeks at a time.  Do you want to sit in an office somewhere and not work with people on a regular basis?  There are medical imaging companies that like to hire RTs to help develop equipment and software for use in the field.    Basically decide right now what things you like and dislike about being an RT so that you can find out which path to take to get to (or away from) those things."

Radiology,2jguaw,soylentdream,9,Fri Oct 17 01:25:29 2014 UTC,"ugh.  ""Hemangioma"" is a loaded term. A true hemangioma is a benign capillary neoplasm that usually involutes spontaneously in infancy. Otherwise, ""hemangioma"" is used loosely to refer to a low-flow tangle of venous sinusoidal channels, which is more correctly called a ""venous malformation."" Neverless, the term ""hemangioma"" is widely used to refer to a benign ""venous malformation""-type lesion in the adult population, both in soft tissues and in bones.  In the spine, the typical ""hemangioma"" is hyperintense on T1W sequenes due to fat proliferation. You have not included any T1 weighted sequences. The fat proliferation also makes ""hemangiomas"" bright on fast T2 and dark on STIR. You lesion is bright on T2 and on STIR.  There are lipid poor ""hemangiomas"", which can be dark on T1W sequences and bright on STIR. These are also called atypical hemangiomas. While the typical vertebral ""hemangioma"" is asymptomatic, these ""atypical hemangiomas"" have a higher chance of causing pain, of growing, and of being associated with pathologic fracture.  It would be nice to see the T1 sequences, but I'll guess they're dark.   The appearance of the abnormal signal on the included images are nonspecific. ""Vertebra hemangioma"" is a reasonable guess for this lesion given your age, and the absence of any other pre-existing diagnoses. But ""vertebral hemangioma"" is much more common in the vertebral body, and much less common in the spinous process/lamina or remainder of the neural arch. Limited CT through  L5 could be useful, as there are sometimes characteristic bony changes (trabecular thickening, et al).  In this case, CT might be less useful since it is such a small lesion.  As always, the opinion of a smart physician who can examine you and review your medical history is worth than whatever some bozo on the internet tells you."

How fast were they going and was it a standard ""foosh""? Where is it hurting specifically?  Also what does the exam show.   Snuff box tenderness? I actually wonder about a little cortical disruption though the distal scaphoid on the radial aspect. If this person had pain in snuff box, or over scaphoid pole or with axial loading of the thumb I would call it a clinical scaphoid and place in thumb spica for rexray in 10 days.   I'm not ultra convinced of a scaphoid so it could be a few other things, a true lateral may reveal a triquetral flake, if they have tenderness at the base of the hypothenar eminence then they may have fractured their hamate and a tunnel view is in order. Also if they have tenderness over the scapho-lunate ligament then a clenched fist view may be helpful. There could of course be weird stuff like a lunate dislocation but as far as I can see from the films provided there is nothing like that present.   I'm not a radiologist so I need to see and touch the patient to get almost anything on an X-ray, there may very well be an obvious fracture there.

Radiology,2j5f8i,Yellowbenzene,4,Tue Oct 14 15:42:39 2014 UTC,"Firstly malpractice isn't the same issue here in the UK as it is in the US. Second, if the reporter screws up, it's their fault, unless that film was verified by a radiologist."

Radiology,2j5f8i,TokenGestures,3,Tue Oct 14 00:15:01 2014 UTC,Not at all! The reporting techs actually teach the residents plain film reporting!
Radiology,2j5f8i,BrewerGeo,1 point,Tue Oct 14 05:41:36 2014 UTC,"What do you think the radiologists will be doing by that point?  We have very strong local opposition to expansion of radiographer reporting,  mainly from clinicians."
Radiology,2j5f8i,TokenGestures,3,Tue Oct 14 07:24:09 2014 UTC,"Ultimately clinicians won't care who does a report - from what I gather most don't really like long winded radiological reports anyway - they just want a diagnosis, and a well-trained reporter can provide that.  Radiologists will move towards functional imaging - scans that assess tissue perfusion, angiogenesis, fibrosis or density. Functional MR sequences, PET/CT and PET/MR.  We certainly won't be reporting routine plain film, or specialist things like MR knee for much longer. CT will become part of general medical training (it's how anatomy should be taught in my opinion). The cardiologists will do cardiac CT, the urologists will do prostate MR etc etc. It's a contracting field - as soon as we invent a new way to image something the specialties come in and take it over."
Radiology,2j5f8i,vaporking23,2,Tue Oct 14 08:16:15 2014 UTC,"I mostly agree, although I think clinicians will start to simply train themselves to report their own stuff.  There is a great deal of resistance from chest physicians to radiographer reporting of their chest clinic films, for example, and I can see it taking years before a surgeon will go to theatre on an equivocal case without a radiologist report."
Radiology,2j5f8i,BrewerGeo,4,Tue Oct 14 08:37:43 2014 UTC,"It's dead right now. First, you'd need a Radiologist to preceptor you which isn't common. Secondly, the jobs are basically unheard of and even rare at larger facilities. You get to do more diagnostic work but you're inevitably stuck in fluoroscopy all day so the radiologists don't have to. The field will grow soon enough with more assistants being hired than actual doctors. On top of that you'll have to find one of the few actual accredited programs/colleges in the nation. However, if you get lucky and end up with a job... you'll enjoy it. Also, you're pretty much SOL if you don't get hired by the facility that preceptored you."
Radiology,2j5f8i,INGWR,1 point,Tue Oct 14 14:11:17 2014 UTC,I agree.  I had looked into this program but found that it was difficult to find a radiologist willing to preceptor. In my experience radiologists were not too happy when cardiologists were able to start reading their own studies or when endocrinologists were able to treat thyroid cancer patients with I-131.  They saw it as an intrusion into their specialty and subsequently their potential income.  I see the same thing happening with the perception of RAs.
Radiology,2j5f8i,yigit3,1 point,Sun Oct 19 15:22:58 2014 UTC,"I think that Radiologists would love to have RA's working with them so they can focus on more in-depth exams.

Radiology,2j5b46,TokenGestures,8,Mon Oct 13 20:09:00 2014 UTC,"Knees are one of those things that you cannot guarantee.  Like spots, pegs and shoulders. Everyone has a theory, but I think I have just learned to look at the patient and modify on a gut feeling. Your method is one I have used, but only when I have plenty of time.  If the patient has mobility or obesity issues and I am rushed, I just roll them on the side, pad up their ankle and look at the angle of the tib fib. Also, bending 90 degrees seems to help rotate the joint perpendicular to the table. Good luck! If it is a trauma situation horiz beam should be used to see any effusion."
Radiology,2j5b46,burstabcess,2,Mon Oct 13 20:35:35 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately, you're spot on about no guarantees with knees. I always get one joint and only partial of the other. Even with my extra time I still don't get nice lateral knees. My feedback is usually ""it's not the best but we don't need to repeat it..."" In addition, the ordering physicians want only a max of 30 degree bend... otherwise I'd get stabbed. Thanks for the input though!"
Radiology,2j5b46,burstabcess,3,Mon Oct 13 20:51:38 2014 UTC,"Every department has its own culture. Some places I have to do standing knees 4 or 5 shots of each.  Others it is just ap and lateral. I find if there is an orthopedic surgeon attatched then anything slightly questionable gets a CT. You just do what they want for now, eventually you will develop your own techniques. As long as you can back up what you do and why you do it then you are doing a good job. If you just do it because thats the way you were taught you might want to observe a few different people and ask questions."
Radiology,2j5b46,vinny1eye,3,Mon Oct 13 21:00:07 2014 UTC,Are you noticing they are all under rotated or over rotated? Usually mine are under rotated. Putting a folded up sheet under the heel of the affected side usually fixes it
Radiology,2j5b46,Minerva89,2,Mon Oct 13 20:43:34 2014 UTC,"On bigger patients I'm usually under. Yeah, I suppose I'm burning myself with the increased angle. I do need to start using a flat sponge instead of an angled one for the foot."
Radiology,2j5b46,shadowa4,2,Mon Oct 13 20:58:11 2014 UTC,"I almost always under-rotate knees, especially with bigger patients. I have to urge them multiple times to roll more, more, I know it's awkward I'm sorry! More!   It helped once I started paying attention to how rotated their hips were. I was bringing the leg wayyyyy over but not having them turn more onto their hip.   Now, tibfibs? Pfffft. I can get the lateral knee, and proximal tibfib...  but then the ankle goes to shit and I end up having to take a lateral ankle as well. I'm probably going to get my tibfib comp revoked next one I do because I just can't get it."
Radiology,2j5b46,poorpinto,1 point,Tue Oct 14 00:55:49 2014 UTC,"You can get comps revoked? Make sure you have the foot flexed for the tib/fib and the knee to foot all on the same surface. However, since the tib/fib descends from the lateral knee you'll never get true lateral unless the ankle is slightly raised so that the tibial spine is parallel to the table/IR. Textbook says that you should be able to get some clear joints on the tib/fib but the divergent rays will skew one of the joints."
Radiology,2j5b46,shadowa4,2,Tue Oct 14 14:57:36 2014 UTC,"Yeah, if we continually fuck up something we've comped and they notice they can either 1) force us to maintenance and then fail us on the maintenance which gets our comp revoked, or 2) tell the CI and the CI will revoke the comp and make us do it again (which is more or less like option 1, but with a different middle step).   It kinda sucks because I see some paid techs who continually mess up on things or can't remember how to do them (the tech I comped my scapula with didn't even know how to grade me, she couldn't remember how to do a scapula). But if I do something stupid like collimate too tightly or not enough, boom, I could lose a comp.   I think my problem with lat tibfibs is that I never have the ankle raised so it's not totally parallel, probably - I'll have to try that next time and see if I do better!"
Radiology,2j5b46,Presia,1 point,Tue Oct 14 17:33:05 2014 UTC,"Jeez, that would suck! Comps are about the specific positioning... not nit picky stuff. I would have had my knee comp revoked by now, ha. Only raise it a tiny tiny bit, more often than not a really good flexion of the foot can solve this issue.  Don't quote me on this tip though as I'm accustomed to being in an orthopedic clinic where true lateral means naturally on the side and normal lateral means unnatural superimposition. Therefore a parallel tibial spine may be a normal lateral as opposed to straight on its side as a true lateral."
Radiology,2j5b46,seesyourbones,2,Tue Oct 14 19:02:03 2014 UTC,They can take points off and fail us for anything. :| I just recently failed a pediatric chest because she said I was awkward holding the kid. I've dealt with toddlers before but that was literally the first baby I've ever held in my entire life. Next time I attempt a ped chest I'm gonna make sure the kid is at least 3 first (anything under 6 counts as ped for us).
Radiology,2j5b46,JustTryingToMakeIt,1 point,Tue Oct 14 19:33:56 2014 UTC,"Dang, we have a list of things and each section has points. If we have over 80% of the points than we automatically comp. That would not fly with our professor or me. I ask them to check it off the list then, it would not be there.  Tip for peds. Grab an extra sponge and let them play with it. It stops them from crying while I run cassettes and etc. Most peds cry when being moved by someone other than their parent."
Radiology,2j5b46,hkn27,5,Tue Oct 14 21:21:20 2014 UTC,"Do a visual check in that position before you shoot. Look from the anterior aspect and see if the knee looks too far lateral/medially tilted. Then find the patella with your fingers, take a look from the bottom of the patient up. More often than not, I position, check and check again and find that on the last check, it doesn't look lateral at all. Then I fix it via angling, sponge at the foot, turning them more etc.  Unfortunately, we can't do cross-table laterals unless there's a good reason to where I work. So that rules it out for us."
Radiology,2j5b46,Trigger2188,5,Mon Oct 13 22:23:28 2014 UTC,"This might sound tedious, but I do all my lateral knees x-table. I can have the portable positioned in the same amount of time or less than it takes the patient to grunt and complain that they have to turn on their side."

Radiology,2j58rr,shadowa4,5,Mon Oct 13 19:50:01 2014 UTC,I think your radiologist is doing a terrible job. The referring physician clearly indicated what they were concerned about. The best way to perform that imaging should really be up to the expert involved.
Radiology,2j58rr,Hypno-phile,4,Tue Oct 14 03:09:56 2014 UTC,Firstly I would say it's AP + C (IV) as standard. But that's for adults.   I would question the need for CT in any child and always suggest US as first line.   I think radiologists should not hide behind 'interpretation only' - we are experts in imaging and our advice in choosing imaging in clinical situations should be the final say.  Edit: especially when it's an intern ordering  scan - what do they know about appropriate imaging?
Radiology,2j58rr,GbyeGirl,1 point,Mon Oct 13 20:03:40 2014 UTC,"Completely agree, and just adds to the list of reasons I sometimes contemplate life in the U.K.  I know the rads here in the U.S. know about protocol optimization, but it just seems that the order vs. request culture limits their input. Whenever they complain that an enhanced exam would've been better suited in arterial phase rather than venous I just want to shout: well then why don't you say something about it!  I would love to have that type of input you describe in the U.K, and have that communication improve my skills and decision making as a technologist."
Radiology,2j58rr,CommissarAJ,2,Mon Oct 13 23:37:37 2014 UTC,"Our protocol is IV contrast to r/o apply. Even as a tech, I question each order that is iffy or needs additional clarification.

Thankfully, our rads will often advise the ordering physician if they are ordering something incorrectly, superfluous, etc."

You do see some patients and pediatrics that break your heart but that can be seen really anywhere.

They both can be repetitive but the job,  pay,  and work load are different.  I can't speak to much for xray techs but with therapy there is a lot more patient interaction.  You will see the same patients on a daily bases for around 6 weeks.  This is nice because you  can get to know them and sometimes they bring nice presents lol.  It also can be bad because if you get a lousy patient you have to deal with them for 30 treatments.    Some doctors can be tools but most of the ones I have met are very nice lol,  but with therapy there isn't any ordering of imaging or that sort of stuff.  Mostly it's making sure the patient is set up correctly,  the correct area is being treated and that the approve it before you begin the first treatment.   The pay is also better for therapists.  Depending on where you work,  starting is usually in the mid 50s.   If you are in an xray tech program right now I suggest asking your professors or the radiation therapy professors about shadowing a clinic someday.  Good luck!"

Being a second year RT student I've had good experiences in clinical and I'm absolutely enjoying it so I don't think it's as bad as you're thinking it is. The job market it tough anywhere but if you're willing to put effort and relocate you'll definitely get a job. In your first year they teach you about the most horrendous situations that you ""could"" face to have you prepared just in case. I have only had only had to deal with one really bad patient in my entire year of clinicals.  I shadowed/observed Radiation Therapy for an entire week and it wasn't for me personally. It's depressing being around patients that are battling cancer and what not. Plus, the modality itself is boring and only seen in larger facilities but it's obviously personal opinion on what you're going to like. You'd have an easy time getting a job if you were accepted into a 50/50 x-ray/radiation therapy position.  These may not be the answers you're looking for but I hope it gives you some incite."

PT has history of breast cancer w/bone mets.  This is a subsequent restaging exam.  The FDG will look at the soft tissue while the NaF will look at the bone with a better efficiency that Tc99m-MDP/HDP, not to mention that I just knocked out both in one scan.  Enjoy!"

Radiology,2irr1i,TheIronMoose,4,Thu Oct 9 16:23:33 2014 UTC,"I've written the type of capture software you're looking for and am happy to advise, but first I want to know, is this for medical purposes or is the client selling cosmetic ultrasound videos?"
Radiology,2irr1i,thebigslide,2,Thu Oct 9 23:08:34 2014 UTC,"On the machines without dicom they are the medical files used to determine the actual diagnosis. Usually they go through some conversion software to become dicom then are uploaded to our core connect host. We do sell cosmetic dvds to those patients that desire them but that is secondary to me. I need a reliable way to keep the older more outdated machines functional. The old program was simple and did its job well but the person who developed it left no comments, install, or troubleshooting instructions, so when they go down, if replacing the original doesn't work we are s.o.l.  That being said the image capture software needs to be accurate and simple (our techs have very little computer literacy skill save a few). If the images are out of balance or distorted they become unusable.   We also take very few videos, it's mostly stills unless we are capturing heartbeat or bloodflow.   Also thanks for your response."
Radiology,2irr1i,thebigslide,3,Thu Oct 9 23:19:25 2014 UTC,"What you want is a hardware solution that is software agnostic then.  Run it through something like cam studio where you can strip down the interface to the bare essentials and hook navigation up to simple controls.  The actual video processing is trivial then.  I'm partial to NI gear, but if you're running old machines, it's probably out of your price range.  What do you have for signalling?"
Radiology,2irr1i,thebigslide,2,Thu Oct 9 23:38:12 2014 UTC,"We have some simple kworld usb video cards that work pretty well, the problem with some of the newer cards is that they try to report higher definition and different aspect ratio than what the usm is generating, those are the only ones Ive found so far to handle the signal clean without attempting to format it. All we need is some software that we can install to capture the images, name and number them, and put them in the folder we tell it to, one click per pic after we tell it the name and folder.   What is this NI you speak of? What do you mean by signalling, the thing that handles the video signal?"
Radiology,2irr1i,thebigslide,2,Fri Oct 10 01:24:50 2014 UTC,"NI is a provider of IO hardware.  In asking about signalling, I just meant to ask where you are able to intercept the image signal and what type of signal that may be.    I'll PM you a further reply, since this is getting a little off topic and I'd like to help you, but I need more information about your environment."

Clinicals are basically an unpaid internship and you will be there 4-9 hours a day, multiple days a week, plus school."
Radiology,2ipq2f,derwreck,1 point,Thu Oct 9 00:57:09 2014 UTC,"This. You'll be ok balancing school and a FT job while you're doing the classroom portion of your education but you're going to have a really difficult time doing clinicals while working full time. I grew up in Southern California but moved out to Las Vegas for college a long time ago and didn't make into the radiology program at UNLV the first time around, I barely got in as an alternate the second time around. Funny story, I had actually moved back in with my parent's temporarily and was looking at schools in the LA area. CSUN has a pretty good program as does Charles R Drew University (albeit expensive). I actually got a call from UNLV while I was interviewing with Charles R Drew to tell me that a candidate had dropped and I was the first alternate on the list, so back to Vegas I went. Being that you already have a bachelor's degree, I'd say look into any program that can get you in the quickest. Almost every school that I looked at in the LA area had an extensive wait list for their radiology program. This is something you're going to have to take into consideration. Being an RT opens up a large spectrum of employment opportunities for you once you get your foot in the door. This is going to differ from one person to the next but, in my opinion, X-ray should be used as a stepping stone to venture off into other modalities. I couldn't see myself doing X-ray for the rest of my life so I wen't off and put in the work to get my CT license. From X-ray you can venture off into MRI, CT, Interventional Radiology, Cath Lab or Nuclear Medicine. My ultimate goal was to always do Nuc Med so I'm going back to school next year for another BS.   I got a little off track here, let me get back to the original point I was trying to make. This may be different from one school to the next but there was no way I was going to be able to balance a full time job while doing clinicals. We had to do two full summers (3 months each) of clinical work which consisted of Monday - Friday 7am-3:30pm. Unless you have a job or clinical site which is willing to work with your schedule, you may have to reconsider your current job if you're wanting to complete a radiology program."
Radiology,2ipq2f,missak,1 point,Fri Oct 10 03:47:22 2014 UTC,"Thanks for adding!  For what it's worth, our first year students go to clinicals 2x a week for 4 hours first semester, 6 hours second semester, and school 2x a week for about 4 hours. Fall semester, we get 1 month off for winter, spring semester, and then a shortened summer semester. Then second years go to clinicals 3x a week for 9 hours, class 2x a week for 6 hours - fall, spring, and summer.   Many of our 2nd year students who still HAVE to work 30+ hours a week are struggling, failing many exams, and are borderline failing the program and probably won't make it through this semester."

Radiology,2im5ho,dianarchy,1 point,Wed Oct 8 11:27:53 2014 UTC,"I'm not trying to be rude, but 8 views is not SPECT, and VQs, even with a vent (and you have to do the vent, or else you can't tell whether these are matched defects or not) only take 15-20 minutes tops, so why not set your counts to 400-500k counts and get a quality scan?  Wouldn't you want someone to do that for you if you were the one on the table?"
Radiology,2im5ho,dianarchy,2,Wed Oct 8 12:06:07 2014 UTC,"It's not a SPECT, it's statics using a SPECT protocol configured for 500kcts.

Radiology,2im5ho,friendtyou,2,Wed Oct 8 12:56:52 2014 UTC,"Are you guys using xenon or dtpa? If it's xenon, then just redo it. If the quality of the vent was bad, chances are that it matched the perfusion and it is not indicative of pe and should have been sent to the radiologist anyway.

Radiology,2img6v,Sleepyhead5,2,Wed Oct 8 16:58:03 2014 UTC,"What your thinking of is a photon. The energy of a photon happens to be proportional the frequency of the em-wave part of the photon.  An incoming energetic particle, like a photon, is fundamentally different from an electric field which produces force on distant charged particles."
Radiology,2img6v,TardisTechnologist,2,Wed Oct 8 18:40:03 2014 UTC,"A photon is a wave of electromagnetic radiation. It's like a little packet of waviness. Radiowaves, x-rays and gamma rays can all be described as waves and photons alike. The longest wavelengths are in the radiowave range and the shortest wavelengths are in the gamma range. Cell phone radiation is in the radio/microwave range, far below ionizing radiation.  I think the electric field you are talking about is the potential difference across the tube. The electric field causes electrons to travel across, where they interact with the anode and cause it to give off photons/waves/x-rays/ionizing radiation/the good (bad) stuff! The electric field isn't what generates our x-rays, it's just what pulls the electrons across the tube to make them interact with the anode, which then releases x-rays.  Electromagnetic spectrum  X-ray production  Also, to answer OP's question, the only legitimate concern would be the phone affecting the dosimeter, which is not a concern because dosimeters rely on ionization to accumulate dose measurements and the cell phone wouldn't cause any ionization within the dosimeter (or anywhere).

Radiology,2ik8fk,schnitzg,8,Tue Oct 7 14:22:56 2014 UTC,So I have heard that people can have small pieces of metal stuck in their eye and so they can't get an MRI.  Is this true?  Is there any way to be screened for small bits of metal you may not be aware of before an MRI?
Radiology,2ik8fk,docfrink,6,Tue Oct 7 19:01:29 2014 UTC,"It is true. People get pre-MRI xrays of the orbits all the time to check, as any meaningful amount of metal will show up quite obviously."
Radiology,2ik8fk,Dantonn,2,Tue Oct 7 20:02:58 2014 UTC,"We are talking about small bits and chips, if you have ever crawled under an old car you may  have had bits of rust showering down on you.  Drilling metal is good at spitting out small chips as well which are often crafty enough to make it passed your safety glasses into your eye.   At that point you then begin the awful ritual of making your eyes tear up while you frantically try to blink the foreign object out.  At the end of it you are never sure if the metal came out or just made it's way deeper in where it's just no longer bothering you."
Radiology,2ik8fk,docfrink,1 point,Wed Oct 8 07:12:21 2014 UTC,"The main cause that I'm aware of is welding. Welders get flecks of hot metal on their skin all the time and if they aren't wearing the right protective gear can get it in the eye too. As said, anyone in a profession that may have resulted in any metal in the eye gets pre screened with an x-ray, which will show it up fairly easily without risk of moving it and causing damage."

Radiology,2igfxw,TokenGestures,3,Mon Oct 6 15:48:35 2014 UTC,"I try to stay in range of suggested techniques in Bontrager's positioning book because you will always be able to defend yourself by clearly stating that it is what you were taught and it is in the book (and therefore the registry), and some techs are okay with that and encourage that, but there will always be someone who has to have the ""last say"", from technique to mobile tube positioning to patient positioning. I have to bite my tongue as I watch her move my mobile tube around in a circle back into the position I originally set it at, or she'll palpate my patient to move the table around and end up back in the same spot.   I'm just quiet and let them do their thing. One tech regularly does chests between 60-80kvp and approximately 6 mAs. The images look okay and the exposure value comes out okay, I still don't have a feel for what ""good contrast"" looks like so I won't comment on that, but I've been warned against this because of increased patient dose.   Fortunately I have been told that once we are no longer students, no one will question your techniques anymore and as long as you consistently get good images then all's peachy keen. Even as a student there are only a few occasions where my exposure is out of whack, and it's usually elderly patients or obese patients, but I'll get a better feel for that as time goes on and I'm continually learning and evolving."
Radiology,2igfxw,TardisTechnologist,1 point,Mon Oct 6 23:53:21 2014 UTC,"60-80 kVp at 6 mAs? If that works then the tech must be utilizing that whole 50-200% correction aspect along with a shorter SID (<56) on portables to achieve that technique. Also, doing the math in my head that seems like it would save dose compared to the normal factors, being that 15% kVp and 50% mAs rule. The site I'm at they use 110 kVp @ 5 mAs mainly. Also, we were taught that for bone work you want relatively high contrast and for everything else you want low contrast since it's more information to detect soft tissue issues."
Radiology,2igfxw,Baial,1 point,Tue Oct 7 02:40:11 2014 UTC,"Yep! It's digital so more things that would have been shitty before look better. The computer corrects it all. :/ At lower kVps though there would be more photoelectric though, which as you recall is patient dose. I don't know how it balances out in the end.   AFAIK they did not get an exposure technique suggestion chart when they switched to DR and nobody knows how they're supposed to use it. I thought you were just supposed to use the same thing, but the computer corrects it so well that you can't see when you're grossly out of range anymore."
Radiology,2igfxw,Baial,1 point,Tue Oct 7 11:44:24 2014 UTC,"This is why learning exposure factors is important, as well as learning about exposure index which is increasingly more important than initial image appearence with improved computer software.  With digital detectors having higher DQE (basically, higher sensitvity to radiation), exposure factors should be going down; however, they are generally creeping up because an overexposed image in DR is easily corrected digitally to look fine. On the other hand, with underexposure in DR, it is actually noticeable on the image because a lack of signal cannot be well compensated for with computer software (""made up"" or assumed signal = noise). People would rather overexpose than underexpose, whether intentionally so or subconsciously, so having a grasp of good exposure factor selection and checking Exposure Index is important!  OP - you will get a feel for it after a while, just check the EI range with every exposure and check you are within the right number range/get a green bar/the bar in the middle/etc."

Again I go with part thickness but then chests are at like 8-16 and pelvis and abdomen is at like 30~ so... ugh.   I had a neat experience yesterday though - a representatitve for Konica Minolta was at our site doing training and I asked her about the kVp stuff. She said stay within proper ranges but use upper ranges of kVp and lower ranges of mAs, which is opposite what my techs have been trying to do (lowering kVp, raising mAs).

Radiology,2i2hok,shadowa4,3,Thu Oct 2 06:19:11 2014 UTC,"So full story is I don't know the answer to this question.    I argued for dissection since it makes clinical sense.  She has left renal artery stenosis, is likely a hypertensive patient, and has several ulcerating plaques on the CT.  I even think I see a dissection flap, although it's definitely subtle.  A dissection flap would put thrombosed dissection into the top of the differential, otherwise the other findings could also argue for an intramural hematoma.  For those who don't know the difference:  With aortic dissections, there is a tear in the layer of the aortic wall that is closest to the blood (the intima).  High pressure blood gets caught by this 'intimal flap' and cuts through the wall of the aorta  separating the intima from the deeper muscular layer (media). You end up with a huge pocket filled with blood. Either this pocket re-opens up into the normal aortic lumen or it stops dissecting.  The first results in an aorta with a flappy wall in the middle of it with blood flowing on both sides.  The second results in a pocket with blood that's not moving anymore, and blood that stops is blood that clots (thrombosed dissection).  Intramural hematomas are a different entity.  The aorta and all large vessels are essentially organs, and all organs need their own blood supply.  The aorta has blood vessels that feed the wall called the vasa vasorum (latin for vessels of the vessels).  Sometimes high blood pressure or certain types of inflammatory conditions (vasculititis) can result in these vessels bursting resulting in blood accumulation into the wall of the aorta.  This can dissect along the length of the aortic wall and narrow the lumen (portion where blood flows).    The biggest differentiator between these two entities is where the blood in the wall of the aorta comes from.  In an aortic dissection, the blood comes directly from the aorta while an intramural hematoma blood comes from vessels that feed the wall directly.  The former means that there must be a dissection flap (not always seen) the latter should not have one."

Radiology,2i2hok,forefatherrabbi,5,Fri Oct 3 02:02:42 2014 UTC,"Great pickup!  Yea it looks like there are two renal veins on the left, one drains normally and anteriorly into the IVC, a second braches with one branch going behind the aorta and the second draining into the lumbo-azygous complex.  Definitely strange anatomy, interestingly on the same side as her renal artery stenosis."

One night I got called in at like 2am.  So I arrive bleary-eyed and proceeded to grab the portable and head upstairs to the ICU for a portable cxr.  (Now, this portable machine was ancient, it had to be plugged in to charge and also to shoot images).  So, I entered the elevator and hit the button and up I went, but I started hearing this weird noise.  I couldn't tell what it was but I knew I'd never heard it before in this elevator.  All of the sudden my machine just ""jumped"" backwards like towards the elevator door.  Only thennnnnn did I realize that the noise I was hearing was the outlet cord being stretched down the elevator shaft because IT WAS STILL PLUGGED IN DOWN ON THE FIRST FLOOR!  So of course, it had wound out as far as it could go but the elevator was still moving and it was between the 2nd and 3rd floors, and I was headed to the 3rd floor anyway.  Then came the inevitable SNAP, and I had lots o'splainin to do."

We had this patient who had a carotid CTA, and naturally we needed to do 3D volume render. Now, I am fairly proficient at these types of reconstructions and I enjoy making them. So I'm usually the first one to jump at the opportunity to make a nice volume render. The girl I was working with felt she needed more practice on her carotid 3-Ds, so she takes the initiative and says: ""I'll take care of this one, if I need anything I'll let you know."" I occupy myself with something else, and return to have her tell me she's all done (with a big satisfying grin on her face). I look over her work and she had made a very thorough, very clean, and otherwise perfect, 3D recon of the patients JUGULAR VEINS instead."

In fluoro I usually tell nervous lady patients not to worry, the radiologist is quite a cutie and very kind. I usually get a laugh about the cutie part. I'm just trying to break the ice here, not make any profound statements! So this one lady tells him I said this and that I'm single and have a crush on him. He looks back at me with a horrified expression on his face.  Another fluoro exam, same rad, he hands me a vial of CSF. At my other job when people hand things to me, in order not to drop them, we overlap our hands. This wouldn't be a problem except the rad is sterile and I'm not. He doesn't say anything about it (I'm still glad I didn't get yelled at) but silently stops using that hand and continues the procedure with the other hand; we're almost done anyway. The gears in my brain are turning; I know I did something wrong but I don't know what. It takes me a good few minutes to realize I just fucked up.   That rad doesn't say good morning to me anymore.

The thick barium required some muscle to mix up, in order to get the chunks out. So after I put water in the can and put the lid on I started to shake that thing REALLY HARD.   Mistake 1: Apparently I didn't put the lid on very well, and the force of my mixing and haste caused it to promptly come off and spray the room in barium.   Mistake 2: While shaking the can, I was pointing it in the general direction of the unsuspecting Rad! Who was then doused from head to toe and given a thick barium shower. He was in a shirt and tie for meetings that day (his clothes were spared where his lead covered), but he was seriously dripping in barium.   Thankfully the Rad was a really good sport about it and we had a good laugh. I ran up to the OR and got him some scrubs to wear and he never once gave me a bad time about it.

However, I wasn't happy with the people I worked with, their ethics, and the general way the department and facility were managed. I took a step away from the hospital setting, and instead moved to an outpatient imaging center where it's more of an ""office job"" than a clinical setting. My point here is that you are the only one who can make things happen. If you feel like putting up with all those annoyances as long as you continue doing what you love, then power to you. However, if you need to further your experience, responsibility, or just plainly get away from that shift/place, you need to make that leap. Just start by at least considering the options nearest to you. When I decided I wanted to change my current work situation, I took to the internet and checked every position in a 300 mile radius. Hell, I looked at jobs in Hawaii (not bad by the way). You don't have to commit to the idea of drastic change, but at least allow yourself to weigh the options that are available."

Radiology,2hghtv,Glonn,5,Thu Sep 25 23:13:43 2014 UTC,"Long story short: when I was a first year student I tried to stand the fluoro table up with an elderly patient on it who only had one leg.  The second year student and I didn't remember one had been amputated and the other one wasn't too functional. She was fine, (lucikly the other student caught her as she was sliding down and I didn't get it very far up), just complained of pain in her leg from putting weight on it. As I wheeled her out to wait for the transporters,  she asked me who to talk to about suing.   Oh and there was the time my first week in school that I told a fellow student we didn't need to wear the lead aprons to  do the daily room check where we would fluoro something to make sure it worked."
Radiology,2hghtv,jaldarith,2,Fri Sep 26 05:51:46 2014 UTC,"We should have weekly posts like these, had a good laugh. Now a second year student... looking back I have done a few stupid things.  When I was attempting to comp on a cholangiogram I grabbed the C-Arm handle with the sterile drape on it for positioning and thought to myself ""I done f***ed up!"" So immediately I say ""Stop! I apologize but I broke the sterile field"" I honestly thought the entire surgical crew was going to pick up their equipment and beat me to death. Instead they just had a laugh and said ""that's alright, it happens"" and proceeded to put sterile tape over the drape area while continuing the procedure. The tech that was observing me for the comp told me that he was proud of me for admitting to the mistake and that most students wouldn't have done that. He said it was a good exam and comped me.  During a chest x-ray I positioned the patient and everything, made the exposure (so I assumed), and ran the cassette for nothing to show up on the screen... So I went back to do it again and I still didn't hold the exposure long enough to make the actual exposure which was evident by yet another blank screen. Feeling like an idiot, the tech I was working with told me not to be afraid of the button... ಠ_ಠ. I got it the third time, the positioning was good so I had that going for me.  I was working with a tech and he told me to hang up the patients IV reservoir from the cart to the CT table. I could not find the attachment for connecting it to the pole so I just looped it around the pole a couple times and let it hang. The tech just face-palmed and told me where the clips were..."

Radiology,2hh3vs,fuglyflamingo,3,Thu Sep 25 22:42:43 2014 UTC,"1) Volunteer to do the dirty work during down time.  Ask what needs to be cleaned or stocked.  Show initiative.  Be truly aware that being a tech involves a lot of mundane chores around the department and even though you won't be tested on them in class, you still need to learn them and be willing to do them to be successful.  If there are no chores to be done, use down time to study.  2) Be open-minded.  Take an interest in how individual techs do things and realize that it is okay if it is not exactly as you are taught in class.  Realize that each and every tech has their own routine, and there is something to be learned from everyone.  Never be outwardly critical of a technologist's practices, even if you consider them to be poor.  (If you witness anything egregiously unsafe, report it to your clinical coordinator, otherwise, it's not your job to regulate the departmental operations of your clinical site.)  3) Do not be afraid to ask to be more involved.  The worst a tech can say is no.  Many techs I have worked with are happy to let a student do as much as they want but are not proactive in initiating the students to participation.  If a tech seems disinterested in you, they may just be waiting for you to show initiative.  If you go in to a clinical site as a wallflower waiting for someone to invite you to participate, you may end up waiting a very long time.  There will be a few techs who are reluctant to work with students, but you will be able to identify them relatively quickly.  4) Do not get drawn into social subgroups within the department.  Stay socially neutral.  Be the person who can get along with everyone, even if it means frequently swallowing your pride or biting your tongue."

Radiology,2hffp8,FreakingThomas7,9,Thu Sep 25 13:33:07 2014 UTC,Ask your physician who is responsible for ordering the CT scan.  The biggest risk is contrast allergy which is in most cases well manageable. You could get some affection on the kidneys as they filter out all the contrast but for a healthy kidney that's usually not a problem. CT with contrast is in most cases well tolerated. There is of course radiation with the CT which is comparable to 100-200 chest x-rays or 3 years dosage of background radiation.
Radiology,2hffp8,flerghasdf,5,Thu Sep 25 13:58:44 2014 UTC,"Second ask your physician. In all honesty they should have explained the risks. If they haven't they will before the procedure. They probably asked for allergies or previous conditions before giving you contrast.   If they didn't, they're not doing their job and you should ask before the procedure.   They being the tech doing the study."

Radiology,2hffp8,shadowa4,3,Thu Sep 25 21:01:10 2014 UTC,"Most people aren't allergic to the contrast, but given the very small chance that you are, the radiologist is trained to deal with contrast allergies. If you are getting the procedure done at a hospital, the emergency department doctor/coordinator is also well-trained to deal with these. Even staff at outpatient imaging facilities are very knowledgeable about contrast allergies and how to handle them.  They will ask if you if you are allergic to iodine or shellfish, if you have a history of kidney disease, etc.  The stuff they give you to drink varies by brand, and as long as you don't have kidney issues, is easily filtered out and removed by the body through normal means.  It contains mostly water, some flavoring, and the contrast in question.  The actual radiation dose varies by your body habitus as well as the exam parameters. As /u/flerghasdf points out, it's likely 3 years worth of background radiation.  Background radiation is radiation that you get from non-medical sources; mostly from the Earth itself, as well as artificial sources.  edit: punctuation and made it easier to read."
Radiology,2hffp8,shadowa4,3,Thu Sep 25 21:28:31 2014 UTC,"I think it has transitioned into a very well set default question throughout the profession. I was actually reading up on it a few weeks ago, and found a bunch of information detailing how the presence of a shellfish allergy only increases the chance for a reaction by a small percentage. I believe it even stated that people with dairy or egg allergies had a similar risk of contrast reaction as those with shellfish allergies. I still ask this question as part of my general history for allergies, but I usually start that portion of the questioning by determining if they are allergic to iodine rather than shellfish.  In any case, the only sure way to determine an allergy like that would be to refer back to their PCP for a reaction test.   https://radiology.ucsf.edu/patient-care/patient-safety/contrast/iodine-allergy"
Radiology,2hffp8,Baial,3,Fri Sep 26 01:26:15 2014 UTC,"Others have already pointed out some solid information, but I must emphasize on the importance of asking questions. I do most of my scanning on an outpatient basis, that is, patients who have seen their doctor for a problem and then come to our imaging center for an exam. I cannot tell you how many times they arrive and have NO idea what I'm about to do, why I'm doing that specific exam, or their face when I mention:Oh yeah, this is going to involve a needle.  What I'm trying to say by this is, please ask as many questions as you like while at your doctor's office. For example: what diagnosis are you including with my scan order, what are you going to rule out, or hoping to confirm with this exam, etc. Also, have some solid history for the tech doing the scanning. Every imaging facility and radiology group handles this differently, but I for one like taking as much history as I can."

Radiology,2heyqv,shadowa4,4,Thu Sep 25 13:01:43 2014 UTC,"You basically qualify as a Radiographer or Diagnostic Radiographer (or Therapeutic Radiographer if you did that instead of diagnostic), which are HCPC protected titles. If you then qualify in further things, such as reporting, CT, MRI or ultrasound then you might say you are a reporting radiographer, radiographer trained in CT or whatnot. Ultrasound specialised radiographers tend to be called sonographers. I might be slightly wrong though, there's a fair amount of discrepancy with what people like to be called."

Radiology,2heyqv,dianarchy,1 point,Mon Sep 29 21:22:22 2014 UTC,"Radiographers in the UK are able to undertake postgraduate training that allows for them to interpret plain film radiographs and write clinical reports on them.  Take a look at the Society of Radiographers on it  ""Radiographer reporting is well established in the UK and makes a major contribution to clinical imaging services. Diagnostic image interpretation and clinical reporting are legally and legitimately within the scope of radiographer practice and have been for many years. Radiographers do not require the ‘permission’ of any other professionals to undertake roles in image interpretation and clinical reporting. They are, however, responsible and accountable for their practice and should take every opportunity to maintain and develop their knowledge, skills and competence. Radiographers who undertake reporting, at any level, should engage with robust audit processes to evidence their competence on an on-going basis.""  ""Clinical reporting: describes the activity of radiographers and other professionals who have received accredited postgraduate training that enables them to produce a diagnostic report. The quality of the reporting delivered should meet agreed ‘gold standards’, irrespective of the professional background of the reporting practitioner. Clinical reporting by radiographers constitutes advanced practice.""  Another little similar thing is red dotting for A&E departments. Radiographers in some places are allowed to red dot images if there is noticeable pathology (fracture, pneumothorax and such) to help speed things up."
Radiology,2heyqv,Terminutter,1 point,Mon Sep 29 21:43:44 2014 UTC,"That's really cool! I've read a little bit about Radiologist Assistants here in the states, I wonder if they're analogous. I haven't read a lot about RA's because it's not anything I'm eligible to do (I don't have a radiography background, but a degree in nuclear medicine)."
Radiology,2heyqv,dianarchy,4,Mon Sep 29 22:44:34 2014 UTC,"As already mentioned the difference in the UK is pretty big. A person can only be called a Radiographer if that person is on the HCPC register (and therefore has demonstrated knowledge, experience, and professional manner) whereas anyone can call themselves a Radiologic Technologist, Imaging Technologist and so on. In the UK it is more common to have Technologists in areas of Nuclear Medicine. Though many departments have Nuclear Medicine (Trained) Radiographers.  This brings about quite a few issues, (I am a Nuclear Medicine Radiographer) NM Radiographers have autonomy, and freedom to act as required to suite the imaging(or non imaging - lab tests etc) but Technologist must follow a SOP, partly due to the way we are licensed. Radiographers have indemnity insurance, and the backing of the HCPC and the Society of Radiographers. Technologists have a voluntary organisation.  This brings about an interesting scenario: In Nuclear Medicine we have PET/CT machines that (by nature!) perform CT, this means that people other than a Radiographer could perform CT, I for one am not really comfortable with this. As Hybrid imaging gets more common so this will get worse.  Please don't think I am bitchin' about Techs I really am not; just trying to explain the difference here without writing an essay.  TL:DR in the Radiographer is a recognised level that must be proven, anyone could call themselves a Technologist. NHS Hospitals employ Radiographers (usually) apart from in Nuclear Medicine where there are not enough Radiographers."

A trial of non-op treatment would be perfectly acceptable if she is unfit for surgery, although a fairly significant loss of function secondary to shoulder stiffness would be anticipated. Surgical options would be limited to reverse total shoulder arthroplasty vs hemiarthroplasty, my preference would be for the former.   Next time, be sure to get an axillary view."
Radiology,2hdniz,mogusmike,6,Thu Sep 25 02:30:27 2014 UTC,"Getting a diagnostic axillary view on a patient like this seems to me like it would be near impossible.

Radiology,2hdniz,ondavid,0,Thu Sep 25 07:23:54 2014 UTC,"Absolutely not impossible. You only need 10-15 degrees of arm abduction to shoot an axillary view. If the patient absolutely cannot tolerate that much abduction without sedation, a Velpeau view would also be acceptable, but the image quality is never as good.

Radiology,2hdniz,ondavid,-1,Thu Sep 25 03:43:41 2014 UTC,"Yes. Glenohumeral osteoarthritis is not a contraindication for hemiarthroplasty.   As I previously stated, my preference would be for a reverse."
Radiology,2hdniz,mogusmike,1 point,Thu Sep 25 03:47:02 2014 UTC,i am aware. depending on wear pattern and a host of other factors. have you ever put one in a patient with GH OA? followed them? reliability for pain relief is far less than often quoted in the literature. very unsatisfying and less than ideal
Radiology,2hdniz,ondavid,-1,Thu Sep 25 03:52:30 2014 UTC,"I agree with you, and I will state again, my preference would be for reverse TSA. However, hemiarthroplasty remains a viable option in the management of 4-part proximal humerus fractures, although fewer and fewer shoulder surgeons are doing them for some of the reasons you've alluded to."
Radiology,2hdniz,mogusmike,1 point,Thu Sep 25 04:04:34 2014 UTC,not with GH oa at same time. very poor choice. functional outcome is quite inconsistent. tuberosities melt. it just sucks
Radiology,2hdniz,ondavid,-1,Thu Sep 25 04:35:45 2014 UTC,"You know as well as I do that there is insufficient evidence to absolutely exclude the option of HA in these cases. There are very few comparative studies, all of which are small, and only one of which I know to be prospective (Cuff and Pupello 2013 JBJS).  With that said, the trend in these small studies is toward better functional and pain outcomes with RTSA. Hence, that would be my preferred option for operative intervention based on the data that is available. But to absolutely exclude the option of HA based on the available data is wrong."
Radiology,2he15l,Leaves16,7,Thu Sep 25 01:39:05 2014 UTC,"It gets easier. The first semester is the hardest because everything is just so new. Terminology they take for granted and throw around like nothing is still confusing - I didn't even know what fluoro was for the longest time. It wasn't until I saw it that it clicked - fluoro is live x-rays. Nobody explained it to me like that. I felt really stupid, but it's obvious now.   Everything is like that later. Just hang in there. Sometimes you might feel like you're hanging on by a thread - I always feel like that - but getting past each hurdle is so gratifying.   In the future when you are taking your certification you will be happy that your teacher was so strict!"

Radiology,2he15l,Glonn,9,Thu Sep 25 02:01:01 2014 UTC,"My advice, you're not gonna like it either, sorry!, don't say her method of teaching sucks - roll with the punches, figure out how to deal with it in your own way, and make it through. ;) She's a teacher for a reason, later on you'll learn about JRCERT and the requirements a school has to meet to be accredited, and if other students in the past have graduated and become employed, she's doing her job correctly. Not everyone learns the same way, which is why I implore you to find the methods that work for you.  I didn't study enough in the beginning of the program - I'm a crammer - and it's coming back to haunt me. Don't cram. Study frequently, and even after you pass that specific class, KEEP YOUR MATERIAL and return to study it over winter break, spring break, next summer, next fall. You'll need it!  edit: AND PAY ATTENTION IN MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY CLASS, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, REMEMBER ALL THAT SHIT BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE EVERYTHING LATER A MILLION TIMES EASIER WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE ROOT WORDS AND ETYMOLOGIES OH MY GOD."

Thanks for the heads up though. And any advice is good no matter what it is. You do make a point about the whole past students have graduated, so she must be doing something right. Hopefully it will just all melt together form lab, because its way easier than lecture (mainly because of this one teacher). Blah, thank you again lol   edit: everything"
Radiology,2he15l,vaporking23,3,Thu Sep 25 02:16:42 2014 UTC,"Try to see different ways to think about the things she's teaching you. Work to see the big picture, the reason why things happen (""why does density increase as mAs increases?"", as opposed to ""oh well density increases as mAs increases, because it does""). Don't make it complicated and don't overthink it though.   You'll get used to the swing of things by the end of this semester and know what to expect in further semesters, I promise.   Keep in mind that your certification exam is not going to be worded the same way as your teacher words things, either! See if the upperclass students offer tutoring - that might help, they've been there and seen these things in clinical format already and might help you apply it. Make friends with your classmates - they'll be like family by the end of the program, and studying with them will help a lot. Don't be a lone wolf."
Radiology,2he15l,Glonn,2,Thu Sep 25 02:23:46 2014 UTC,"That last part sucks because I'm used to doing things my self, but ever so slowly I'm talking to more and more people.

Radiology,2he15l,emaf37,3,Thu Sep 25 02:33:40 2014 UTC,"I, too, am an introvert. It's been hard. Very hard. Talking to my peers, talking to 'coworkers' at clinical, talking to patients. I've put my foot in my mouth so many times and I occasionally rue ever speaking up about anything, ever, at all.   It helped that I was vocal about my introvertedness and told my classmates I learn very well just from watching and listening to them. It helps if you just explain that you are shy. But when you go to clinical (if you aren't already) you will have to put on that facade and speak to people and pretend you're comfortable with it even if you really aren't. If you tell the techs you are shy/introverted/do things on your own they will tell you flat out to get over it.   You'll become closer friends with classmates once you're split up into clinical locations (if that's what your school does - mine has multiple locations, I think most do).   If you told me any of this a year ago I would have laughed in your face! But you'll adapt. Most people leave the program due to personal/life reasons, not due to failing out, so keep your head up and you'll be fine!  Good luck! If you ever need anything - need to vent, gloat, need advice, whatever, don't be afraid to send me a message. I was a tutor back when I had free time (free time? what's that?); I'd be glad to help."
Radiology,2he15l,TokenGestures,2,Thu Sep 25 02:41:07 2014 UTC,"Online quizes just suck period, you aren't able to ask your intructor for clarification and you aren't able to write what you meant. Some may say it is preparation for the registry but when you are just learning the material it can fuck you up. One of the first years answered a question that increasing kV can increase the quantity. The student reasoned that because you could be increasing kV from 60 to 70, you would technically get more characteristic x-rays, which I think is true. So, it can be an ambiguous question if parameters aren't implied. In my class 3 people cried from one instructors use of ""Projection"" and ""Position"" I'm pretty sure he was the devil, cause we got a new instructor when he retired. I don't mean to just whine, X-ray is hard, your first semester will slap you up side the head, it gets better and once you start being useful to techs it becomes really satisfactory."

I took the test after taking classes and clinical for my bachelors degree. I also want to state for the record that I passed my rad boards with a 94 and my CT boards with a 89... That being said the MRI registry was the hardest test I've ever taken.  I passed with a 77... And I was shocked when it came out that high.   Part of the problem is I couldn't find any good study materials. The one registry review book on amazon is really sketchy... Lots of wrong answers, some outdated material... And I found it didn't reflect the boards at all. Being away from it so long is going to make it even harder for you.   If you really want to do it though, go all in. Try and find some CE seminars through the ASRT or other organizations, that would probably be your best bet. Or see if the ASRT has those learning modules for MR like they do for CT.

Radiology,2gqp5o,kappapi708,1 point,Thu Sep 18 11:06:44 2014 UTC,"I had a chiropractor that took 13 xrays of my spine, it was extremely odd to me. I'm not sure if that's an unhealthy amount or not, so I didn't question anything. But yeah he acted like it was normal."
Radiology,2gqp5o,memnc,1 point,Thu Sep 18 20:11:12 2014 UTC,"For spine, the maximum projections ever needed would be around 7 unless he did your entire spine from lumber to cervical.. So either your chiro screwed up heaps or just likes to give you extra radiation for the fun of it.   It isn't crazy unhealthy but no matter how small you should not be exposed to unnecessary radiation. That is drilled into us at university."
Radiology,2gqp5o,kappapi708,1 point,Sat Sep 20 10:18:32 2014 UTC,"It was lumbar to cervical, sorry I should have mentioned that. Not sure why he did that though, as all of my pain is lumbar. Thanks for the explanation though!"

I remember doing l-spine x-rays on a guy who told me that his job was taking l-spine x-rays for a chiro. Guy was not an MRT. In his defense, he knew how to take an L-spine x-ray...but that was pretty much it."
Radiology,2gqp5o,Dantonn,3,Fri Sep 19 10:40:27 2014 UTC,"At my program, when we're at the pediatric hospital, we have to reinterpret outside images even if there's a prior report. Anyway, one day on call I got bilateral elbow radiographs from a chiropractor's office. They were awful. First of all, they weren't labeled left or right. They were so overexposed that the soft tissues were blown out even despite heavy windowing on PACS, and the positioning was not correct on any view.   It's fucking criminal that these crackpots are allowed to see patients, much less expose them to ionizing radiation."
Radiology,2gqp5o,CommissarAJ,2,Mon Sep 22 22:31:38 2014 UTC,"There's a few people in that thread claiming that x-ray techs called them the day after with results for whatever reason.

Radiology,2gqp5o,Meelie,6,Thu Sep 18 18:00:06 2014 UTC,"Well if the tech was just repeating what a radiologist reported, its entirely possible. More likely the guy just got confused by the title of whoever was calling. I've seen MRT's be referred to as 'rad-techs' as well, which could very easily get confused with radiologist (sometimes just referred to as 'the rad')."

Radiology,2gq3on,derwreck,1 point,Mon Sep 22 00:40:53 2014 UTC,"I did take a CT anatomy class while I was getting my degree but that was well over three years ago. The physics behind CT is very similar to that of the physics you saw on your radiology boards. I was scoring in the low 70s when I was doing my mock exams, so if you're scoring around that you should be good to go for your boards. I'd recommend doing a few mock exams over on proprofs.com, I used those in combination with the mock exams that were included with the Mosby's book. Honestly, what helped me the most was just grinding through mock exam after mock exam and if there was something I didn't understand, I'd look it up either online or in the book."
Radiology,2gqf51,syd430,1 point,Thu Sep 18 04:42:13 2014 UTC,"My history:  Dull pain / inflammation in thoracic spine for three months duration. History of pain in the sternum due to anatomical variance of sternum, resulting degenerative arthritis in non-fused 1st/2nd sternal segment and degeneration of xphisternal joint. Xiphisternum was removed in August 2014.  Summary of findings:   Trivial posterior convexity of discs in the mid thoracic spine such as at T7/8 on the left. Nonetheless, no significant neural impingement is identified. Minimal disc desiccation at T7/8 and minimal end plate irregularity at several levels including Schmori’s nodes at the inferior end plates of T10 and T9.   Questions:   I am assuming the very dark disc in the upper thoracic region is the desiccated T7/8 mentioned in the report. Is this something that is typically found in a 26 year old male? Just how bad is it looking? The rheumatologist believes that it’s fairly normal and not causing my symptoms at all. Is the end plate irregularities and Schmori’s nodes likely to be the cause of my symptoms? Again my rheumatologist doesn’t seem to think so.  How bad is the issue at the 1st/2nd segment of my sternum looking? Has anyone seen anything like this before? The thoracic surgeon that removed xiphisternum has given me the option to insert plates that will secure the joint, however i’m not really interested at this point despite it being symptomatic. I’m more curious if anyone has seen this kind of thing before."
Radiology,2gqf51,ax0r,3,Thu Sep 18 04:42:58 2014 UTC,"Yes, the dark disc is the dessicated one. It's not common to have dessicated discs at your age, as it's usually a response to long term chronic micro trauma (ie age). Have you had any sort of back injury in the past? (Car accident, fall over onto your back/shoulder, landing on your head, etc). Any of those might have caused damage that would lead to this appearance, without necessarily causing much problem at the time. In isolation, it's unlikely to cause pain. In the future though, this will be the first disc to go, and might end up causing you some arthritis or cord impingement in the future (still not likely in the thoracic spine). There's nothing that looks like oedema in the bones there now (nothing acutely happening).  Schmorl's nodes are common, and almost always asymptomatic. They can cause pain if they're big enough, but it's not likely. I'd agree with your rheumatologist here.  I wouldn't say there's anything ""bad"" about your sternum. The 1st and second segments have failed to fuse, which is a normal developmental variation. Your sternum is a tad more flexible than if it had fused normally. If you ever get into a car accident in the future and have sternal pain, you might stress this joint. It's easy for an ED doctor to misdiagnose a failure of fusion as a fracture on xrays, so be aware of that."

You could maybe get a CT image from a zoo or vet school if you feel like making a lot of friendly phone calls. You can try over at /r/AskVet
Radiology,2ghv58,ibattletherous,2,Mon Sep 15 22:03:14 2014 UTC,Thank for the reply!  Do you think a CT would provide a single sagittal image of the entire neck if I was so inclined to start calling zoos?
Radiology,2ghv58,A_Medical_Physicist,7,Mon Sep 15 22:14:47 2014 UTC,"Sure, if they imaged the whole thing. You'd have to have a pretty jacked up giraffe to be CTing its whole neck. Animals require anesthesia for this sort of imaging, so it's not done nearly as often as in human medicine. Good luck!  Please post if you find anything.  It'd be interesting to see.

Radiology,2gfwq8,radsthrowaway,6,Mon Sep 15 07:55:42 2014 UTC,"Yes, there are turf wars, lots of them. ER doing ultrasound, urology doing kidney and prostate biopsy, cardiologists doing cardiac CT, orthos reading MRI etc.   For a while radiologists owned everything, and things were good! Now others have seen what we do, taught themselves how to do it and are making the money for themselves.... but not everything, and not everywhere.  Radiology is becoming a support service, much like pathology where requests are sent and a report expected without question or much care for the clinical picture. This can be draining on a radiologist who cares about clinical integrity and multi-disciplinary healthcare.  It's not all doom and gloom though. By being proactive, taking part in managerial groups and board meetings you can prove value and expertise far beyond that of the turf-invaders."
Radiology,2gfwq8,Hypno-phile,3,Mon Sep 15 09:16:56 2014 UTC,"I think your fears are pretty groundless. In general, what other specialties are doing is different than and additive to what you do. Nobody should claim that a FAST scan done by an ER physician or surgeon is the equivalent of a formal echocardiogram or abdominal ultrasound study. Any more than a CCU nurse looking for arrhythmias on the cardiac monitor isn't the same as a cardiologist reading a 12 lead EKG. Different, limited, gets the required job done. And using a bedside ultrasound to help gain vascular access doesn't need an interventional radiologist any more than suturing a simple laceration needs a surgeon.  You mention ortho reading MRI studies-I think for the purposes of surgery they probably do a fine job of it. The spine surgeon should certainly be able to tell whether the nerve root compression he's looking for is present. Doesn't mean they'll pick up the incidental iliac artery aneurysm or identify demyelinating nerve disease. Surely you wouldn't argue they shouldn't be reading plain films? Even then I'd argue what you get is different. Consider my interpretation vs the radiologist's for the same fracture:   ""Acute transverse fracture of the distal 5th metacarpal with the distal fragment displaced volar, in keeping with the provided history of trauma. There is improvement on the post reduction views though some displacement persists. Calcification of the radial artery is noted. Incidental note is made out erosive changes at some of the MCP joints-morehere a history of rheumatoid arthritis?""  Versus ""Transverse fracture 5th MCP. I've fixed the clinical rotational deformity I was worried about and the angulation is improved from 70 to 15 degrees-that's more than good enough and there's no need to monkey with the fracture any more.""  Both of these interpretations are correct, each is giving different information. Which is better   For a while radiologists owned everything, and things were good! Now others have seen what we do, taught themselves how to do it and are making the money for themselves.... but not everything, and not everywhere.   Things weren't better for the patients with diagnostic testing being less available... And many of your examples (EDUS, ortho reading MRIs) don't actually make any money.   Radiology is becoming a support service, much like pathology where requests are sent and a report expected without question or much care for the clinical picture. This can be draining on a radiologist who cares about clinical integrity and multi-disciplinary healthcare.   I think the pathologists would object to that characterisation. Though I agree radiology and pathology are often viewed as supportive diagnostic services rather than primary patient care services.   It's not all doom and gloom though. By being proactive, taking part in managerial groups and board meetings you can prove value and expertise far beyond that of the turf-invaders.    Make no mistake, I value my radiology colleagues' knowledge and input! I rely on you guys in the dark all the time."
Radiology,2gfwq8,myRADgirlfriend,3,Mon Sep 15 18:22:07 2014 UTC,"My girlfriend is a radiologist and we have discussed her career prospects and how it would effect us getting married.  She was a surgeon for three years as well, but the size of her hands were making some procedures difficult.  I think that radiology is only going to grow as a field as we discover more and more imaging techniques and different types of IR.  So I wouldn't worry about doctors doing ""their own damn wet read"" like they did in the 1950's.    If you are American and you are not a radiologist, there is no financial incentive to read your own studies.  You want to see patients as fast as possible because every patent adds to your bill.  Why waste time on something that you don't know much about that you may not be able to bill for (I know people outside of the USA are laughing right now at that).  My biggest fear is that radiology is one of those jobs that can be done for years - you aren't spending hours on your feet like in an ER or surgery.  This means that people can do it for long past when they should have retired.    So after Andy and I are married, you may see my cartoons being written from Kentucky instead of Philadelphia because that is the only place she could find a job."

Radiology,2fyzgn,vaporking23,3,Wed Sep 10 02:59:21 2014 UTC,"Our thought was to allow all radiology related content, as long as it's not purposely seeking advice. We understand that interesting cases make the best posts, but not everyone has access to cases aside from their own imaging. For example, we would continue to allow personal exams if they want to share their images, experience,etc., but discourage the obvious advice seekers.  On this last point, what is everyone's opinion on how to handle personal advice issues? If this option has the highest votes, we would change the disclaimers to forbid posts seeking advice rather than just discourage them. However, if an exam is submitted seeking advice in any way, should we:   Warn the user that advice is not allowed, but leave the post. Warn the user that advice is not allowed, and remove the post. Remove the posts with no warning, and direct them to the sidebar."
Radiology,2fyzgn,Yellowbenzene,10,Wed Sep 10 04:25:11 2014 UTC,"I'd go with option B. Where I don't think anyone in their right mind would think that anything anyone says over the internet should be considered as truth or factual. It does get annoying with people who just post images here that have very little intrigue. However, I'm also not the one interpreting them.   On a side note I think we should also allow text posts. Maybe I missed a reason why this isn't allowed here. But I think there are great discussions that can be had and to have to post a picture just to be able to ask a question seems a bit much."
Radiology,2fyzgn,BariumEnema,6,Wed Sep 10 14:34:01 2014 UTC,"Agreed.  ""B"" plus text posts.    Text posts can be useful for reflection and discussion.  ""B"" because non-radiology people might want to come here and share their interesting imaging.    Edit - I think giving imaging advice or even reports here is very dangerous and highly ill-advised.  You have no idea who is commenting, or what their training is.  Furthermore, here in the UK at least, I am prohibited from giving advice in this way by the regulator (GMC).

These include things such as an indication in the rules that by posting the user is agreeing and signing an electronic contract to comply with the rules. In addition, direct medical advice will not be given and if another user risks giving such advice it is solely their responsibility. However, it should be expected that all users within this community are not proven or regarded as professionals with education to give appropriate medical advice. This is not a substitute for medical/professional examinations as this sub-reddit is purely for observant educational and entertainment purposes. These statements seem very obvious but you'd be surprised by how many individuals choose to ignore rules and ultimately end up in a worse situation.  I chose ""C"" because ignorance should not get in the way of education. More traffic will only enhance this sub-reddit and users will find ways to make their posts appear innocent anyways when in reality they're searching for medical advice. If everyone is anonymous and anyone can add a tag to make them appear as a medical professional... there really isn't any weight to our words. Also, lets be honest here, a good portion of interesting posts are personal exams or users that are indirectly looking for medical advice."

But circumstances in my life have led me to talk to a bunch, and I like this sub because I like to get a feel for how the art of interpreting images work.  I say that because undoubtedly the mods and many of the users are professionals, but lots of us who lurk are not.  What we want is more pictures, and more information.  We want interesting comments to google, and images to contextualize them.  So my vote--if it counts--is to permit more images rather than less.  I understand medical liability and licensing better than most of the practitioners, but I don't want to dictate what you should feel comfortable with.  Basically, however, I think you should maximize the participation.  So let me suggest this.  When someone posts something about themselves, make a comment that warns them that most of the readers and commenters are not doctors, that they should not rely on the statements made,  and they should seek further medical care from a doctor who has examined them to confirm or refute any conclusions they make from their posting."

Some big sports players look like they are going to cry when they find out they really have an injury. You don't know how people will react and if they have support.

Radiology,2flvt7,hughthewineguy,1 point,Sat Sep 6 11:31:23 2014 UTC,are there any positive orthos?   No   just pain with active knee flexion   Correct
Radiology,2flvt7,hughthewineguy,2,Sat Sep 6 12:43:56 2014 UTC,"my clinical suspicion is that there is an imbalance between the strength of quads and hamstrings  most probably this is   partly at a neurological level, due to some unusual strain/force in this recent bout of activity which confused the CNS, and as well as this acute CNS challenge which is underlying this current episode of pain and dysfunction, there is also some long-term neural dysfunction. there's also highly likely to be a simple orthopaedically measurable weakness in hamstrings which will probably be observable bilaterally, and probably slightly worse on the right, due to inherent weakness in the muscle itself, (as well as the overlain neural dysfunction and lack of correct innervation which is weakening the hamstring as well.)   which came first, the weak muscle, or the bung neurological input? that's chicken and egg stuff. we will never know, and treatment-wise, it doesn't matter.  assessment  hamstrings should be pulling 70% of what quads can pull.  test the strength bilaterally of quadriceps (pure knee extension, easiest in a gym on a knee extension machine) i would expect that the patient can perform this without any real level of pain on the side of the complaint, as will be described below  test the strength bilaterally of hamstrings (pure knee flexion, easiest in a gym on a hamstring curl machine) this may well prove painful, and particularly weak on the side of complaint.  my guess is that hams are weaker than they should be bilaterally, and particularly weak (and possibly painful on isolated contraction, as in the above testing regime) on the right.  clinical rationale  in dynamic weight-bearing exercise, such as stairwork or squats, the quadriceps group performs active eccentric contraction, as well as concentric contraction. conventional knowledge says that when quads are working, hamstrings are turned off. this is not exactly the case, particularly in eccentric contraction. yes, they are relatively inhibited (and the part which the nervous system plays in this function, is part of the problem in this case) but they still contract, in such a manner as to stabilise the knee:  quads, pulling in active eccentric contraction, act very strongly upon the patella tendon, which in turn acts upon the tibial tuberosity, which in terms of the anatomy of the knee, is pulled/translated strongly anterior. if this is not opposed in the correct fashion by hamstrings, it stresses the ligamentous tissues across the front of the knee, and it feels awful- like the leg's going to give, like there's something wrong in the joint, like something at the front of the knee is really wrong.  it's not. the site of pain is not always the site of dysfunction.  if hams are firing correctly, they oppose this anterior tibial translation by acting on their attachments at the posterior of the tibial condyles, and in doing so, allow quads to act and pull with the correct vector: in the body, it's never one thing or the other thing, it's all about these things being in balance.  treatment  the most important part of this to correct is the altered function of the nervous system, which for whatever reason  -in the absence of obvious tissue damage and positive orthos- is not using the stretch response, crossed flexor/extensor reflex and reciprocal inhibition pathways, and cerebellar and cortical pathways, to allow this individual to do stuff the way they could 4 weeks ago. can't tell you why, but it's not doing its job.  something has gone screwy, with the neurology. one day we'll understand the nervous system and have a thorough explanation, but we don't really currently know nearly enough- i can't tell you what exactly has gone screwy, but i can tell you that is is important to get that addressed. from personal and on-going clinical experience, all the strength training and soft tissue work in the world will not fix this stuff.  1. getting this neuralogical involvement sorted, is something i would do by checking and adjusting the spine. it is possible there is involvement of altered proprioceptive output from the joint capsule in the knee and/or related structures, and ordinarily i would check this too, though in the vast, vast majority of cases, it is the spinal dysfunction which is most important to assess and address, as this is where the junction between the central and peripheral nervous system occurs, and where the spinal reflexes involved in reciprocal inhibition and crossed extensor/flexor reflexes occur.  which came first? the measurable muscular imbalance or the poor function of the nervous system, which it is not possible to directly measure? it's impossible to tell without having been able to assess this patient 4 weeks ago, and it is impossible to treat one part of this without treating the others, for long-term resolution.  get checked, get adjusted. not just the lumbar, the whole spine, and the extremities. this shit typically isn't fixed in one session. pick a practitioner you trust, and follow their suggested course of care.  2. get some good quality soft tissue work done, i am sure that there are improvements in the quads and hams that can be made- release hypertonicity in the quads, check for adhesions in hams and any problems around the musculotendinous junctions, particularly in semimembranosus and tendinosus- deep tissue, MFR, NMT, along with some MET or PNF stretching: re-set what's going on in the tissues themselves, and the peripheral nervous system- golgi tendon bodies, stretch receptors.  obviously, hamstrings and rectus femoris act upon the pelvis as well as the knee. do not neglect the rest of the pelvis, particularly the prime movers in hip flexion and extension (glut max, iliopsoas) as well as the highly important stabilisers (glut medius and minimus, TFL) as there can be deep-seated dysfunction in any and all of these that will hinder the progress with the issue at hand  3. train for balance, train for strength.  the quads are most probably imbalanced between each other, train them bilaterally to no stronger than the strongest can do right now- there is the temptation to keep training them for strength, but that is not productive- what is missing here is balance. strength comes after balance.  while working to even up quads, incrementally train the hams bilaterally to 70% of this initial quad strength value. take time, and take care. hamstrings on the problem side are weak and dysfunctional, and it's not primarily their fault ok, this is a multi-factorial problem. as such, pushing them past what they are comfortable with will not yield quicker progress. start slow, start with what it can do- train to fatigue, not failure. once hams build endurance, increase load/resistance/weight  from there, once things are functioning well from the perspective of neurology, soft tissue health, and balanced strength it is up to the individual if they want to continue to train both legs to greater strength, always keeping in mind to train first for balance between sides bilaterally and between sides in terms of opposing muscle groups and then for strength. if one group of muscles (in this case most probably the right hamstring group) is way weaker, then training other groups as hard as they can go whilst ignoring the need for balance is like a positive feedback loop and can only enhance the dysfunction which is already present.  are there other options? sure, i'm sure someone could stick some cortisone in somewhere, and relieve the pain, but that removes none of the underlying dysfunction aaaaaand the clinical etiology as laid out above, would still be there. cortisone is a (really bad) bandaid, a last-resort treatment which is over-used, that feels like it does something good, (removes pain) but doesn't really change what needs changing.  EDIT: not saying there isn't other stuff going on, as well! good to see someone has gotten back on the MRI. there is obviously long-term dysfunction underlying this, otherwise i would expect pain at both knees. the course of care outlined above would be best undertaken after it has been ascertained that any acute inflammation at/in the tibial tuberosity and adjacent tissues has settled."

Radiology,2fdzu4,InvisibleApe,4,Wed Sep 3 20:19:53 2014 UTC,Hello Techs of/r/Radiology what are some positioning tricks that you’ve learned over the years for positioning?  Here are some of mine:   For LPO and RPO oblique L-spines palpate for the ASIS and place it in the bottom corner of the light field for the perfect CR. Works perfectly! When performing an AP Thoracic spine have the patient place their head at the foot of the table.  This will utilize the Anode Heel Effect and create a more uniform density. For a perfectly angled portable CXR make sure the shoulder and it’s shadow are at equal heights   What are some of yours?

Radiology,2fc0y7,InvisibleApe,2,Wed Sep 3 06:24:13 2014 UTC,"Well, to be honest, KUB isn't a term or really even a specifically described technique we use in veterinary medicine.  Now, my experience is mainly in emergency medicine; so I cannot speak for the radiologic technique of specialties like veterinary urology or gastroenterology; but, when we get a dog on the table specifically to evaluate say, constipation/other GI issues or bladder stones (which are markedly more common in dogs than kidney stones), our process/technique is probably quite simplistic compared to human medicine.  Assuming the dog isn't aggressive or fractious and does not require sedation/anesthesia, we simply position the dog in dorsal recumbancy (which always requires manual restraint), and shoot from there. Contrast mediums like barium are common when looking for FBs or other GI obstructions, but are rarely used in my practice for any urology imaging.  Inn not entirely sure if this answers your question, but let me know if you have any more!"

Radiology,2fc2l1,Dantonn,5,Wed Sep 3 06:38:07 2014 UTC,Exactly. You could also angle the tube up slightly. Did we just do your homework for you?
Radiology,2fc2l1,SchuylerL,2,Wed Sep 3 06:53:35 2014 UTC,A slight caudal angle can compensate for lack of external rotation?
Radiology,2fc2l1,SchuylerL,2,Wed Sep 3 07:06:15 2014 UTC,"Not exactly. To open the joint space between the tibia and femur you'd angle the tube cephelad. The larger condyle is the medial condyle, I know this because it is further from the board and therefore it is more magnified. Knowing that you can picture that the tube needs to be angled to compensate. A tube angle of 3-5 degrees cephelad would open that joint space."
Radiology,2fc2l1,ClementineNakayama,2,Wed Sep 3 07:28:18 2014 UTC,"Another way of looking at it or explaining it is:   Look for the adductor tubercle which you know is on the medial condyle.  Because the condyle with the adductor tubercle is posterior and inferior, you know you'll have to increase the cephalic angle and rotate the patient towards the detector to compensate (assuming its a mediolateral projection).

We usually give them about 10-15 minutes because the vast majority of the time they find it within that time frame. Usually just two of the sponges get blood-soaked and stuck together so they get mistaken as one.  I'm still not entirely sure how that one doctor could think he misplaced an 8-inch pair of forceps.

He was coughing up cups of blood, was emaciated, feverish, and couldn't eat due to nausea. We sent him off with some tylenol, zofran, oral rehydration salts, and money to get a chest X-ray.   He came back 2 days later looking much better with this X-ray in hand. We called it pulmonary active TB and sent him to the nearest WHO-sponsored Direct Observation Therapy center where they handled his care.  It just recently occurred to me that, while I've been showing people this picture as an example of TB, I never actually saw the radiologist report and would like to know what sorts of things you can see in this film and what is diagnostic of TB or whatever else would be in the differential. Thanks!"
Radiology,2f4b69,Yellowbenzene,7,Sun Aug 31 22:45:32 2014 UTC,"The differential is wide in this sort of thing.   I would say something like: There are diffuse bilateral airspace consolidatory processes with patches of confluence. No specific cavitatory areas, and no significant effusion. Given the history, the differential includes atypical and organising pneumonias, tuberculosis and pulmonary haemorrhage (vasculitis/Wegener's granulomatosis). Further imaging is required with CT, and of course relevant blood and sputum work.  It's not very helpful, but honestly I don't think you can hang your hat on anything when the appearances are so complex.  Edit: Also, let us know what the final diagnosis was. It's nice to get feedback."

It wasn't that long since I was at medical school and they were still teaching us to make a big deal out of HIV testing.    Nowadays, HIV can be managed with a single pill per day, and provided CD4 counts are good at diagnosis, life expectancy may be the same as age-matched HIV negative controls.  This, according to the speaker, justifies much lower threshold for testing.  Some of the cases we were shown where there were dozens of missed chances to diagnose HIV were chilling.  One was a 28/F with chronic diarrhoea and HIV wasn't even considered until she was in ICU with a perihilar pneumonia.  At this point it was too late and she died from it."

Should the IR person be able to read studies?  In the article it sort of addresses this, but I'm also unclear on how the IR practice featured is not falling under the purview of Radonc?

Radiology,2euqeh,serendipitybot,1 point,Sat Sep 6 01:08:06 2014 UTC,"The goal is to push IR towards the forefront of medicine as a primary referral point for PCPs.  Currently, and increasingly so in the near future, IR physicians are clinicians who fundamentally understand imaging and can intervene at a minimally invasive level.  It's a powerful triple threat in modern medicine that no other specialty can compete with.  Instead of sending a patient to a surgeon, a PCP will send a patient to an interventionalist who will consolidate the appropriate imaging and workup and consider the patient for lower risk and overall cheaper invasive procedures. If the patient requires more invasive treatment, then the interventionalist will refer to the appropriate surgeon.  IR is sort of following the footsteps of Radonc.  Breaking away from DR and becoming more clinic based.  It's the only right move.  In fact, had this happened 20 years ago, interventionalists would probably still be dropping coronary stents.  And there'd be a whole lot less groin hematomas and femoral pseudoaneurysm complications."
Radiology,2er2c0,schnitzg,7,Wed Aug 27 19:12:14 2014 UTC,"Um, every IR physician knows that filters should come out after they're not needed. This is well established. The problem is conveying that information to patients and their physicians, and getting the patients to actually come back to get it removed. It's unclear from the article, too, if she was being anticoagulated for her PEs at the time. If so, it's reasonable to leave a filter and also anticoagulate, rather than throw a massive PE again.   Additionally, it's a very rare cause of severe clinical pain even in the setting of strut migration so it's not surprising that other specialties aren't aware of this as a cause.   This is a great example of laypeople having no clue as to the complexity of medicine. I was expecting SMA syndrome while I was reading the article, just for the record."

Radiology,2ea2rm,hairheads3,7,Fri Aug 22 17:01:06 2014 UTC,Comparing the liver echogenicity with that of the right renal cortex (sag right liver image) I would probably agree. If you are overweight or drink alcohol then it's quite common.
Radiology,2ea2rm,Yellowbenzene,4,Fri Aug 22 14:27:30 2014 UTC,Nearly every single patient I scan (in Glasgow) has this.  It's rare to not see it.
Radiology,2ea2rm,hairheads3,7,Fri Aug 22 19:51:55 2014 UTC,"When I first started doing ultrasound I thought a fatty looking liver was a normal variant because essentially every single patient I scanned had it. Years later, I was at a conference and the speaker was describing/showing u/s images with incredible detail. I went up to talk with the speaker after and told him I could never get as good images since a huge proportion of my patients were at the least overweight (and many were obese). He said his patients were overweight too and I asked what his definition of overweight was -  ""130lbs"" (for an adult woman) was his answer. Well, what could I say to that?"
Radiology,2ea2rm,Yellowbenzene,4,Sat Aug 23 00:32:05 2014 UTC,"Ha!  ""A limited study due to patient build"" is at the top of a worryingly high number of my reports.

I keep trying to explain that US only has a useful depth of around 15cm, so if their patient has a 10cm roll of blubber I'm not going to be of much help.   But of course they send the patients down anyway and then complain that the report isn't helpful."

I guess they biopsied intercostally from an anterior approach - that's where I would go. Or perhaps just behind the right clavicle under US. Also it might be useful to get cytology from a pleural aspirate.  Listen - you're in the business so there's no pandering here - it sucks, but thankfully lymphoma is one of the most treatable cancers. Looks like this is all one side of the diaphragm (normal spleen size, no coeliac nodes on the lower slices) which is Stage 2 and a better prognosis. If the biopsy comes back low grade Non-Hodgkins (Follicular or MALT) or low grade Hodgkins then you have around a 90% 5 year survival prognosis. In my experience (from the lymphoma board I sit on) 6 cycles of chemo usually melts this stuff away pretty well. It'd be nice to get an oncologist's opinion here too though.  Best of luck. Start getting yourself physically healthy, chemo will knock you over so you want a good starting physiological reserve. Also, talk to someone about fertility sparing options if you haven't had kids yet."
Radiology,2e012a,beamseyeview,3,Tue Aug 19 18:35:23 2014 UTC,"I'm a Rad Onc PGY5 at a big centre for lymphoma. Pintastico has nailed it in terms of many lymphomas like this in younger people being curable with chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy. For some diseases, the studies are working on minimizing the treatments because they are so effective. On the other hand, low grade lymphomas ( I doubt this is one) never completely go away but they can be well controlled for the rest of your life.  That being said, the biopsy really is important because it will guide the next steps. You said you had a needle biopsy, was it a core?   The next steps will be completing the staging with CT of the abdomen and pelvis, likely a bone marrow biopsy and a nuclear medicine scan.  A CT neck doesn't change the stage but could help radiotherapy planning afterwards. Bloodwork will also help guide the oncologist. They may need an excisional biopsy if things are unclear.  You are probably weeks away from having the full picture, but that's ok - it won't affect the progress or prognosis of this disease, and it means everyone will get their ducks in a row and make sure it's the right treatment before starting anything.  You already know to go to the hospital with any signs or symptoms of svco, so you're good to continue doing what you can do, and unfortunately just getting busy waiting..

Radiology,2duoo3,Glonn,3,Tue Aug 19 03:49:42 2014 UTC,"I am a tech working overnights in a hospital, and therefor do mostly ER trauma x-ray.  I would say that in a trauma situation it is usually very difficult to downright impossible sometimes to get a full dorsiflexion.   Centering could certainly be better, but you will often see techs who do that in trauma to purposefully get more tib-fib, not that I agree as divergence can close the joint space.  I don't see any motion blur however, though I am looking on my phone.  Good luck with the rest of school!"
Radiology,2duoo3,meb9000,1 point,Tue Aug 19 13:04:39 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I suppose from my classroom perspective it can be tough to understand that trauma x-rays often won't yield textbook results. I couldn't see any tibiotalar joint space in that lateral ankle at all. Could've been the amount of beam divergence like you said or the fact that the ankle couldn't dorsiflex. I suppose the techs get away with this one since the Pt has a lateral mallelous Fx."

Radiology,2duoo3,TokenGestures,1 point,Wed Aug 20 20:39:22 2014 UTC,"Recent grad here (May of this year). Doing them in a clinical/hospital setting can be VERY different from the classroom.  Basically, you're there to learn how it should look and how to get the right stuff in the picture for the Radiologist.  After you get that down you will, more often than not, have to modify a few things to get a decent image depending on the situation.  Patients will be pissed at you for causing them more pain, be uncooperative, or just flat out unable to do what you need them to do.  Especially in trauma...that's where you learn all of your out-of-the-box stuff.    ALWAYS try your hardest to get the best image you can, but sometimes the best you can get won't be that great.  And usually getting more info (like extra tib/fib) is preferred in trauma because pain in one area might not necessarily be exactly where the injury is (think contrecoup fractures or even arm pain during a heart attack).  Opening the collimator a little wider is sometimes a good idea in these situations."
Radiology,2duoo3,InvisibleApe,1 point,Sat Aug 23 18:02:06 2014 UTC,"I can see why you would see a bit of a problem; however, if I might say; I do not perceive significant motion on the picture there are image compression artifacts reducing the quality of the image (possibly a bit of mottle), but actual sharpness is unaffected. So, it's useful to note that I've actually been reprimanded by Rads for not including enough tib-fib on an ER ankle.  Note: in the ER not ""out-pt"". So if you center your central ray 1cm below med. mall. (ish) and widen your collimation, your CR will remain good.  Don't be a noob and center your CR up the ankle just to get more tib-fib (that will distort and close up your sinus tarsi).  So, the light field will extend below your imaging plate (IP)hitting nothing, yet you get no distorion and ample tib-fib.  Problem/compromise solved.  This person may have done that.   ps.Yeah, dorsiflexion is good even if it hurts, but not every one can"

It's $18,000 to get the bachelor's degree. The main question you should ask yourself is what do you want to do with the degree. The speaker described 2 routes to us. You can go into teaching or into management. The Bachelor of Science in Radiologic Sciences is what you want to go into teaching. The Bachelor of Science in Healthcare Administration is what you need to get into management. But don't expect to jump straight into using your degree once you receive it.

It is a lot more ""lonely"" than taking offline classes, in that you don't really have much contact with other students. If you appreciate the ""support network"" that classrooms generally tend to develop then online might be a bit hard for you.  As for the actual content, it got the job done; you really do have to be very self motivated to thrive. I learned most of what I did from self studying (flashcards for the win! WOO!), not from doing the classroom assignments like essays and whatnot. I like the provided textbooks and used them quite a lot. I still sometimes get them out to look stuff up.  Also, be aware that if there is an externship portion to the program then you will likely have to travel to another city/state to fulfill it. Since they are online, their externship sites are scattered sporadically throughout the US. Living accommodations are all on you.  Overall it was a challenging 14 or so months, but well worth it in the end because their name is pretty well respected. If you go through some personal issues the teachers will work with you to make sure you can succeed. It is very possible to do the program and work full time as long as you can plan ahead and manage your schedule well.  I hope that gives you some insight into the school, even though I just did the associates program."
Radiology,2dmwwr,PolarLeviathan,4,Fri Aug 15 14:31:55 2014 UTC,Brain tissue and vessels appears normal. No apparent pituitary adenoma. Do you have any symptoms or signs besides what you're saying that increase suspicion of a pituitary adenoma? Dizziness and headache aren't terribly helpful for narrowing things down.

The neurologist has suggested possible migraine, although I have no such history for myself or in my family.  Another possibility is stress - I had been working for 10 months at 12+ hour days.

It caused me constant problems up until it re-fractured almost 2 years later. After the ORIF the surgeon confirmed it was a fibrous non-union. From looking at the images from September/August 2012 it looks to me as though you can still see the original fracture line, is this normal or is it a sign of fibrous non union?

Radiology,2df5d9,shadowa4,2,Wed Aug 13 08:44:55 2014 UTC,"What is it that you want to know about your images? Your first xray seems like a typical clavicular fx that matches the mechanism you described. This first image is the easiest to discern the fracture in. You may notice how your clavicle appears to be in two parts, rather than a continuous structure. The following xrays taken through 2012 show what I consider a normal healing process for someone in your age group. You notice how the fracture site begins to lose its ""sharp"" edges and becomes somewhat cloudy/smoother; this is where bone has begun to form a ""bridge"" to close the fracture. Unlike some beliefs, fractures don't just disappear with time. Children experiencing a break are the most likely to end up without any signs of a fracture, while adults tend to retain some radiographic evidence of injury such as bony callous or slightly misaligned anatomy.  As you described, your latest x-ray looks like you re-injured the fracture site. Under what circumstances did you re-injure? Fall? If you are looking for more specific information or descriptions, just let us know. Hope this helped."
Radiology,2df5d9,shadowa4,1 point,Wed Aug 13 13:28:43 2014 UTC,"Thanks for taking your time to reply.  The re fracture occurred after I fell off my bike again, it was only a minor fall onto grass and I sustained no other injuries. I had surgery afterwards to repair the clavicle and the surgeon confirmed that the original fracture had never healed (fibrous non union) which is why it broke so easily and in the same place the second time around.  To me it looks like the images in August/September 2012 still show the original fracture line, is this to be expected 9-10 months after a fracture? Or is this a sign of a fibrous non union?  Thanks"

You can have mycotic aneurysms (infection causes damage to the smaller vessels over the convexity), but that's unusual. Trauma is the most common cause of a cerebral convexity SAH.  Nontraumatic convexity SAH is a rare bird.

The last will be wildly inaccurate unless you do something clever in Photoshop so it is scaled correctly. Still, all three tools are going to give you slightly different measurements.

Radiology,2d2wme,_Zangler_,1 point,Sat Aug 9 20:12:18 2014 UTC,"As far as the ultrasound is concerned the features the sonographer would look for which would be suggestive of cirrhosis include:   Dilated portal vein Antegrade portal vein flow (blood flow into the liver, rather than out - reverse flow is indicative of portal hypertension) Nodulation to the liver capsule Changes in the liver echotexture - giving a markedly coarse, starry sky type appearance Re-canalised umbilical vein Possible Ascities in a number of locations Splenic varicies   You don't display any of these features.  Should these features (or a combination of these features) be confirmed via ultrasound then it would be reasonable to suspect/call it as cirrhosis.   Basically your ultrasound finding is subjective to the operator. Ultrasound whilst a fantastic tool is extremely dependent upon operator skill and experience. Your finding probably has no significance. Seems like your doc was being thorough."
Radiology,2d2wme,Sleepyhead5,6,Sat Aug 9 20:19:58 2014 UTC,"No, they're not.

CSF flow study is only warranted if Chiari is suspected and even then more often than not inconclusive. I don't think a neurosurgeon would operate or choose not operate based on the findings of the CSF flow study.
Radiology,2bwwd8,hfrrfrr,1 point,Mon Aug 11 19:48:52 2014 UTC,"The radiologist classified my case as ""mild"" but I'm wondering if my cerebellum looks like its blocking the flow of cerebral spinal fluid (plan on seeing a neurologist to schedule a CSF MRI). Can mild cases of tonsillar ectopia still cause symptoms?  I don't have the hallmark Chiari headache but do have trouble with word finding/psychiatric problems/bad fine motor skills and experience dizzy spells. Also, is there a reason why the ectopia looks less severe in the third photo? Is it because my brain stem isn't showing in that one (i.e. an issue of perspective)?  Edit: all apologies for the potato quality of photos. The dumb CD the hospital gave me won't let me export photos/toggle them outside of the viewing software. Windows only too and the only non-mac computer I have at home is slow as fuck."

When she was not working she would spend her call nights scanning her baby. Then one day she could not find any fetal heart activity(she was <12 weeks gestational age) . She called me up in tears and asked if I could cover her call as she and her husband were distraught. She then called her OB with her ultrasound findings. The OB said to come into the office in the am if she did not start bleeding sooner. The next day the OB asked her where the u/s was done so she could get the report. My friend admitted she had scanned herself. The OB just gave her a flat hard stare and sent her down to ultrasound for a proper scan - where they promptly found a heart beat. Lesson: scanning yourself is stupid.

I have no idea if I'm having poor copper absorption due to intestinal issues (after antibiotic) or if it really might be Wilson's disease.

Radiology,2bfrfd,ondavid,4,Tue Jul 22 23:47:28 2014 UTC,Why is it ok/safe to play with such an injury?
Radiology,2bfrfd,elgskred,7,Wed Jul 23 00:53:50 2014 UTC,That part of the vertebrae is so far away from the spinal cord that no harm could be done to nerves if the injury is aggravated.
Radiology,2bfrfd,SchuylerL,1 point,Wed Jul 23 00:56:47 2014 UTC,There's no risk to the spinal nerves?
Radiology,2bfrfd,robo23,1 point,Wed Jul 23 02:29:22 2014 UTC,The spinal cord goes down the spinal canal. The injury is not at the spinal canal. The injury is at the transverse process. We are assuming spinal canal is intact. If the injury is not where the spinal cord is we can safely assume the spinal cord is not injured. anatomy
Radiology,2bfrfd,SchuylerL,6,Wed Jul 23 02:45:10 2014 UTC,I understand that. But the spinal nerve roots exit from the intervertebral foramina overlying the pedicles of the vertebrae which are in close proximity to the transverse processes. How are they not at risk from this type of injury?

Radiology,2bfrfd,SchuylerL,3,Wed Jul 23 05:44:19 2014 UTC,"Off the top of my head (not comprehensive!): Displaced pedicle fractures, facet joint fractures, certain vertebral body fractures (including any injury that causes a 'slip' of the column) would all potentially impinge or damage the exiting nerves, roots or ganglia. Also acute disc prolapses and para-spinal or epidural haematomas can compress nerves by mass effect. Basically in the spinal canal and the exit foramina the space is tight, so anything that reduces the space further can cause injury.  Additionally certain mechanisms of injury can cause nerve root avulsion (i.e. ripping the nerve roots off the spinal cord); a common example is a motorcyclist landing on the neck/shoulder."

I was once diagnosed with a couple of similar fractures to two vertebre, however radiology neglected to FUCKING TELL ANYONE for five months until I was in hospital again  and asked out of curiosity. Turns out ""OK so you had the fractures back in July..."" is a pretty good way of inducing catatonia in me.  In the meantime I'd had a dodgy disc diagnosis for the spasmy/sciatic pain and was recovering pretty well.  I still sort of wonder if the fractures influenced that supposed disc pain."

Radiology,2bfrfd,ondavid,2,Wed Jul 23 02:31:53 2014 UTC,"I think ondavid is kidding. It's certainly safe to play in terms of spinal cord and nerve injuries (which are the key concern with a spinal injury) as the fracture is well away from any critical structures. But it would still hurt a lot. The Psoas muscles (amongst others) attach to the transverse processes so they would pull on the injury during play. Also in the acute event it's very likely there would be a very small localised haematoma as bone has a rich blood supply; this would cause more pain and irritation. Playing-on would aggravate the injury, be very uncomfortable and might mildly worsen any bruising/bleeding. You might also prevent complete healing if you aggravate the injury to the point where the bony separation is too great to unify. So not dangerous per see but not a good idea either.  (And obviously, until you assess the injury +/- image it, you don't know what you're dealing with.)"
Radiology,2bfrfd,MalcontentUK,2,Wed Jul 23 18:11:11 2014 UTC,"Are you sure this wouldn't hurt? It's still a fractured bone... There would still be considerable pain would there not? Even beyond that, wouldn't engaging in physical sport increase the risk of displacing the fragment?"
Radiology,2bfrfd,itsnickan,3,Wed Jul 23 03:59:56 2014 UTC,displacement wouldn't matter with a transverse process. people come in and we routinely make them activity as tolerated. we dont even take spine consults for them. there may be pain but majority would be from muscle spasms. those could be managed for a sporting event. easily.

The IMA isn't opacified, so that would sort of fit. There's air in the liver too, at first I thought portal venous gas, but it's more central, implying pneumobilia... Any more history?"

Radiology,2bctfj,Nociceptors,1 point,Tue Jul 22 15:19:25 2014 UTC,"Sorry to have to come back to this, but one of my doctors is now more concerned and wants to put me through further testing.  I've also recently found out that the specialist that ordered this CT erroneously described my pain in completely the wrong place (he wrote upper right on the referral instead of lower left!), and so I can imagine the radiologist that initially looked at the scan was focusing more on the wrong place.   Can you please take a look at the following and tell if this is the correct area discussed above?  http://i.imgur.com/fsT4J2i.png  I'm not sure if I circled the area on the Axial image correctly, but the circle on the coronal view is exactly the area that I have the tenderness, pain and pressure. It's also ""hard"" there, when compared to the other side.  Do you think it might be a swollen lymph node or something? I'm thinking about doing an ultrasound to have another look.  Again, I had a colonoscopy two hours before this CT which was all clear and shouldn't really have any feces in my bowel, so it's hard to imagine it's that."

Radiology,2bc1zj,bretticusmaximus,6,Mon Jul 21 22:22:40 2014 UTC,"In all seriousness, OP you cannot clearly visualize the vertebra with a chest X-ray. Case in point, try to pick out the spaces between the vertebrae behind the heart. It's very difficult. Now trying to visualize a fx is even more difficult. Even still, only one view is pretty much useless. Even if this was a proper AP thoracic spine view, it may not visualize a fx that could easily be there, but only seen on a lateral. Like the commenter above, if your doctor ordered this specifically to rule out a fx, you need a new doctor. All the best to you! Hopefully you don't end up having a fx, but I hope you find relief regardless. :)  EDIT: I was referring to the OP of the X-ray if that wasn't clear. I just added it to this comment chain as it was a logical progression of thought."

I am a first semester RT student. I am receiving conflicting information regarding compensating filters. We have been told that they will result in increased patient dose because the technique needs to increase when using them, but my textbook and everything else I am finding about them says otherwise.  I am looking for solid evidence such as scientific journal articles to help me know what is true about them.  Linked is the only relevant article I could find in my school's library."
Radiology,2b3kfr,cherryfristado,2,Sat Jul 19 01:44:46 2014 UTC,"You shouldn't have to increase your technique to use them. Their purpose is to even out the beam so you ""use"" a beam with the appropriate strength for each body part. I would think the only way it could would be increasing dose is by having it upside down (that is so the thinner part is toward the smaller body part and vice versa). I mainly use them for scolis and leg length, and it turns out fine. But your link requires a log in, so I can't read the article. However, you maybe could make the argument that newer RT's don't collimate as much and/or are less confident about shielding and thus increase dose? And you also have to factor in SID and body type.   The FDA says they reduce dose. http://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/ResourcesforYouRadiationEmittingProducts/ucm252765.htm  I would follow what your books say. At the end of the day, thats what you need to know for your boards."
Radiology,2b3kfr,silflay,1 point,Sat Jul 19 03:43:16 2014 UTC,"Perhaps the FDA is suggesting even more low energy photons are absorbed by the filter (in addition to the inherent filtration) and reducing entrance dose?  Just a thought because I'm having trouble myself seeing how they would increase/decrease dose based solely on technique adjustment.  If using AEC, I imagine it would be quite similar since the chamber is going to require a certain amount of x-rays to reach it anyway before cutting the exposure.  Difference being the compensating filter is preventing overexposure of a thinner area of anatomy.  In fact now that I think of it, it would reduce dose by filtering out unnecessary x-rays and leaving only enough necessary to penetrate the thinner part.  Interesting question, really.  I don't recall talking about it in school."
Radiology,2b3kfr,Dantonn,1 point,Sat Jul 19 04:55:00 2014 UTC,"I mean, the whole point of filters is to penetrate a denser part without burning out the thin one, so you're setting the technique for the dense part and faking the thin one having similar electron density. Even if the filter's behind the thin part, that only gives you as much dose as before, not more, and if the filter's in front of the thin part, it'll be less dose. I suppose you could claim that cases where you need a filter, though you normally wouldn't, require higher techniques and thus result in more dose, but that's a body habitus thing, not a filter thing.  I can't really think of any way a filter would increase dose without weird AEC shenanigans, and that sounds like it's more on the manufacturer than the tech."
Radiology,2b3kfr,ClementineNakayama,1 point,Sat Jul 19 05:49:44 2014 UTC,"This is almost exactly how I am seeing them. If any technique increase would be needed, it would just be to adjust for the thinnest part of the filter so you end up with the same exposure to the thickest anatomy as you would have before using a filter. And then all the thicker filter parts would have absorbed the low-energy photons even more to further reduce exposure to the thinner parts of the anatomy."

I have degenerative disc disease and found out due to a soccer injury twenty years ago (41 now). Last fusion was done in 2006.

Common problem after fusion surgery, especially since your cervical lordosis [curvature] was not maintained in your plated fusion level (C4-5) due to the lack of an interbody graft like you have at C5-6 (what it is supposed to look like). That puts much higher stress loads on the disks on either side. Since C6-7 is a very mobile disk, not surprising it is blowing out. Consistent with your symptoms too, what sounds to be a C7 radiculopathy. May have some overlap with C6 into the thumb but I wouldn't put much stock in the exact divisions of dermatomes over clinical symptoms/you may have some residual irritation from the injury or surgery at C5-6."

Radiology,2ajbps,laxaroundtheworld,3,Sat Jul 12 21:08:20 2014 UTC,"Not a radiologist, but these scans could be mine (not really, but the description is dead on me).  IT SUCKS.  Fall at work 7 years ago and tore the rotator cuff, the labrum, and had a hillsaps legion (sp?  Chipped a hole in the ball of the shoulder).    Multiple surgeries.  Up until the last one it was so guarded that they couldn't get a handle on it with their hands, it wouldn't budge.    I was very active in rehabbing it and got full range of motion after each operation, but without pain management I would have killed myself.  It still hurts all the time and there is so much I can no longer do, but with the medications, flector patches, and about 7 ice packs a day I get by.  Whom ever these scans are of has a long, hard road ahead.  They will learn the meaning of patients."

Radiology,2ajbps,Dantonn,2,Sat Jul 12 23:57:17 2014 UTC,"Thanks, been pronouncing it wrong for 7 years.  It sucks.  On the 4th I was in a hurry and used that arm to reach under a table to unplug something and it caught and I had to relax it and the ICE it for a few hours (I know I shouldn't ice it that long, but at this point I don't care, just make it not hurt) and I've been getting headaches since then.  Hopefully a few more days and I can start back at the beginning with the first PT exercises and start climbing that mountain from the bottom again."
Radiology,2ajbps,thehogdog,1 point,Sun Jul 13 00:12:04 2014 UTC,thats my shoulder... I probably should have made it clear in the title lol. The surgeon thinks that the labrum tear is small and is only part of the problem. He thinks that the joint capsule itself is too big and is the main thing that needs fixing...
Radiology,2ajbps,thehogdog,3,Sun Jul 13 00:02:56 2014 UTC,"PM me if you want to talk about it.  If it is your dominant hand, start learning to be other hand dominant. Mouse, remote control, brushing anything, and most of all, wiping.  It was the last thing I wold have thought about, but is the thing that was the hardest to adapt to.  Just cant reach round back there without PAIN.  The hardest adaption to make."
Radiology,2ajbps,FlyingHaxor,3,Sun Jul 13 00:15:19 2014 UTC,Honestly the labrum doesn't look that bad to me. Loose joint capsule is more of a clinical diagnosis and you really want to exhaust every non-operative type of treatment (physical therapy/strengthing/conditioning) before you want to undergo surgery for what we call multi-directional instability.

He fell on an outstretched hand during the lunch break of an 8hr comprehensive exam but still managed to eat and take the written portion of the exam (then go to a bar with friends before telling me he hurt himself). He had obvious joint effusion, pain over the radial head, inability to pronate or supinate, etc so I took him to the ER. The ER physician was luckily astute and recognized the fx.    I thought about my husband's case while I was reviewing elbow radiographs at http://www.hawaii.edu/medicine/pediatrics/pemxray/v2c18.html  I think the ortho was so used to dramatic fxs that he forgot to look for small signs (I don't have a lateral or oblique view but the anterior fat pad was at full sail and the posterior fat pad was visible)."

Radiology,2a2c60,binkpits,2,Tue Jul 8 07:22:07 2014 UTC,"It looks like they produced this image specifically for this purpose, so it could have been rendered with the noise filtering off.  It's a better comparison for the layman since patient positioning means the difference in fine detail is less aparent due to slight difference in the alignment of the slice.  There's a lot of post-processing that happens in hardware before the DICOM file is produced and I expect that the final image from this machine will be even sharper when zoomed in.  Or, they could have left the noise filtering on for the 7T image to make a more dramatic comparison.  Hard to say since the image hosted by the site has been converted to a PNG and possibly adjusted."

Radiology,2a43pg,Shimshammie,8,Tue Jul 8 20:44:33 2014 UTC,"My advice would be to finish ultrasound school, and then if you still want to pursue X-ray you can do that later on and be dual certified. Being dual certified might make you more marketable to certain employers, and give you an edge in some job markets.   The market is pretty saturated with X-ray. From what I can tell (I'm not an ultrasound tech) the job market seems a little better for for ultrasound, but don't quote me on that. Here in Montana, in the rural hospitals and clinics there is a lot of need for techs who do multiple modalities, hence my comment about being dual certified being a benefit to you! Also with X-ray, the trend seems to be ""paying your dues"" and getting your foot in the door by working PRN or ""as needed"" (on-call only, no guaranteed hours, no benefits) for a while until you get promoted to part time or full time. Again, that could just be MT though.   Good luck with everything!"
Radiology,2a43pg,Alexwo1,3,Tue Jul 8 17:37:08 2014 UTC,"How far are you from completing the ultrasound program? If you're close, you might as well just stay, then go into an xray program. Rock the dual certs, awww yeah!   I've heard a lot of gossip about the future of rad techs - right now it's pretty saturated. You have programs churning out 10+/- students every year and the old techs are slow to retire. I'm not sure how many rad tech programs are in your area, but here where I am in Ohio there are... too many. I feel like the students from the four year programs probably are the pick of the litter, and those of us from 2 year schools are secondary but I guess I cannot confirm or deny this because it's just my speculation. :)   A lot of the older techs are talking about how they'll cut hours and positions after we're all transitioned to the new DR equipment because it'll be faster, so they won't need as many. I can't see this being very true, and if it is maybe just for the 6am-3pm shifts because there are so many techs on that shift that a lot of them end up just sitting around waiting for something to do, but afternoon and overnight seem chronically short-staffed."

Radiology,29woqf,heavyeyes,3,Sun Jul 6 14:36:48 2014 UTC,"There is an oval-shaped mass centred at the inter hemispheric fissure anteriorly within the brain anterior to the corpus callosum in the frontal region. This measures 4.2cm transverse x 1.7cm sagittal x 3.1cm AP. On the non-enhanced T1 weighted sequence, the centre of the mass is slightly hyper intense to CSF. It is isointense to CSF on FLAIR-weighted sequences and slightly hypointense compared to CSF on T2 weighted sequences. The signal characteristics are consistent with a cystic mass which does not represent an arachnoid cyst however. A thin high signal intensity rim is identified on a non-Gadolinium enhanced T1 weighted sequences. These are hyper intense on T1 weighted sequences and are favoured to represent the calcifications identified on CT scan.   Unfortunately due to motion artifact on the non-enhanced T1 weighted sequence, it is difficult to exclude subtle ring enhancement with absolute certainty however, this enhancement is indeed present. It is mild and scattered.  A repeat scan performed with more adequate sedation to refrain motion artifact would be of benefit to exclude enhancement with absolute certainty.   The mass appears extra-axial in location centered at the interhemispheric  fissure/falx. A finger-like projection extends posteriorly from the mass by 8mm along the inter hemispheric fissure further supporting this. There appears to be a cortical gray matter surrounding the mass however, extra-axial location cannot be confirmed with absolute certainty. No edema is identified in the adjacent left or right frontal lobes. The degree of local mass effect is mild. There is no midline shift.  IMPRESSION: The cystic mass located within the inter hemispheric fissure anteriorly is favored to represent an epidermoid cyst. A poorly enhancing cystic meningioma is in the differential diagnosis but is considered less likely. A low-grade cystic tumour such as an atypical meningioma or atypical cystic astrocytoma cannot be excluded with absolute certainty, but are considered much less likely."

Radiology,29woqf,helpful_grey,1 point,Mon Jul 7 21:09:44 2014 UTC,"I've been looking at this for the past couple days and can only think of things that this isn't.  An epidermoid cyst should be hyperintense to CSF on FLAIR. The rare ""white epidermoid"" would be hyperintense on T2WI and hypointense on T2WI.  Agree that the DWI would be nice, but I don't think this matches with an epidermoid.  It is an extra-axial tumor, though.  I think it is kind of funny how the T1 hyperintense rim is incomplete, like a chemical shift artifact (or something).  You know, looking at the little speckles on the T2WI...makes me think of a lipid-poor hemangioma, maybe arising from the falx, but that should be FLAIR hyperintense, too.  Then I start thinking about something like eccordosis physaliphora and I wonder if I've officially punched my ticket on the crazy train...  Sure would be awesome to see pathology.  Thanks for the interesting case, OP."
Radiology,29woqf,heavyeyes,3,Tue Jul 8 04:29:35 2014 UTC,"I think it's likely an epidermoid. They typically have a ""dirty"" appearance on FLAIR. The T1 hyperintensity in this lesion is probably calcification."

Radiology,29ro0o,schnitzg,25,Thu Jul 3 20:03:31 2014 UTC,The comments in the article are interesting.  As a radiologist I can tell you that this is unfortunate but we will continue to see these kinds of verdicts being handed out because there is an unrealistic expectation that every exam has 100% sensitivity/specificity for diagnosis.    A 1.5 cm nodule could be obvious but it could also be very easily overlooked or hidden and hard to pickup depending on the location.  There are probably a 10 different things that could fake you out into thinking there is a nodule or density when there actually isn't.  Couple that with the fact that a typical radiologist may be asked to read anywhere from 75-150 Xrays in a typical 9 hr day on top of countless distractions like answering phones calls.    Often we are given misleading or insufficient histories. Sure we have access to medical records but guess what...it could take anywhere from 5-15 minutes to find the chart and relevent info. So for about 150 patients/exams that's 12.5hrs of just looking up charts per day.  Jurors don't get that and neither does the general public.   Get real.

Everyone, no matter how good a radiologist you are, is going to miss a few 1.5 cm nodules in their career. Whether the ones you miss are cancer is a matter of probability."
Radiology,29ro0o,bretticusmaximus,-7,Fri Jul 4 05:31:30 2014 UTC,"But he didn't get the history. The point isn't ""even with..."", the point is he didn't. If he had, this would be an entirely different discussion.  That's like saying ""some tests have false negatives, so the fact that he didn't do the standard test doesn't matter."" It matters. In the former case, shit happens. In the latter case, he plainly cocked up a fundamental thing."
Radiology,29ro0o,DrArkades,7,Fri Jul 4 00:00:22 2014 UTC,You know what?  How fucking often does a radiologist have complete fucking history for the hundreds of films they read each day?  It is completely unreasonable to expect a complete chart review of every patient for every film read.  Is there no duty for the ordering physician?
Radiology,29ro0o,bonedoc59,3,Fri Jul 4 01:51:00 2014 UTC,"I am not sure I understand your point. Are you saying the radiologist ""cocked up"" because he (1) did not get the history or because he (2) missed a ""fundamental"" thing or are you implying that only ""some tests"" have a false negatives? The fact is radiologists often don't have the history and the only radiologist who has made no mistakes is the one who has read no cases. EVERY single test has a false negative and false positive rate. In fact EVERY doctor has made mistakes - it is just that in radiology our mistakes are on hard copy. Things that are obvious in retrospect are often not so easy to detect prospectively. edited for clarity"
Radiology,29ro0o,hairheads3,0,Fri Jul 4 02:08:22 2014 UTC,"I apologize; I will clarify.  I am saying that he cocked up because he didn't get the history; that not getting the history is missing a fundamental thing in the practice of medicine; all tests have false positives, my point was that the existence of false positives does not excuse one from not performing the test."
Radiology,29ro0o,DrArkades,4,Fri Jul 4 12:13:22 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the clarification. However I still don't understand. What test was the radiologist guilty of not performing? Should he have suggested CT for every chest X-ray that he reads out as negative? If I suggested CT or follow up for every chest X-ray I read as negative even with a history of ""smoker'  then I would be taken to task for over calling (and might be blamed by a jury  for the sequelae of findings that are false positives). As for missing a 1.5cm nodule - that is unfortunate but it is NOT necessarily negligent. Juries see the nodule helpfully labeled with big arrows pointing to it or they see the initial scan after seeing the follow up images (hindsight is always 20/20). In real life it is not so easy sort out the incidental from the pertinent. Many things in radiology are not black and white - there is a great deal of judgement calls. Even the best radiologist will sometimes make a mistake in this choice. This is NOT negligence it is simply human."

Radiology,29ro0o,yeswenarcan,16,Thu Jul 3 21:35:35 2014 UTC,"While this is true, I'm sure the ordering physician wasn't looking for lung cancer either. Without having the full history, a persistent cough in a 40 year old, even with a smoking and family history, is pretty unlikely to be cancer and is much more likely to be pneumonia or bronchitis.  Also, the elephant in the room that nobody seems to be mentioning is that this woman apparently either didn't seek follow-up care or there were other physicians who missed the diagnosis as well. I mean, this woman had symptoms bad enough to go to the ED, doesn't get a diagnosis, and then it takes another 13 months for her to get a diagnosis of cancer?

Radiology,29ro0o,dishwasherlove,0,Thu Jul 10 02:11:41 2014 UTC,"In my experience, Radiologists rely almost exclusively on the technologists to provide a patients history and to note when it is limited. I always attempt to get a good hx on a patient and often times gather information that was not in their chart, this is especially true for ER patients.  We've caught several missed important pieces of information and even patient symptoms that lead to ordering additional studies that result in a positive diagnosis that could have been otherwise delayed or even missed.   That being said the article does not clarify who dropped the ball on gathering or providing this history.  Regardless, I question how much effort the technologist put into gathering a hx from this patient and whether or not this is a standard in their department (it should be)."
Radiology,29ro0o,DrArkades,3,Fri Jul 4 18:02:48 2014 UTC,"Where does the line start and end though? Do techs open themselves to litigation by beginning to provide histories? There is no way you can provide a full medical history in the short contact you have with the patient. Like me you probably don't have formal training in medical history taking, you just include what you think is relevant to fill the blank void of the nondescript notes left by referrer on the form (injury, sob etc.). I add mechanism of injury to a lot of my examinations because the notes are so shit and of course it helps the radiologist (and in turn the patient outcome which is why I do it) but it really is the job of the referrer.   Interesting to consider, glad I don't work in the US I guess."
Radiology,29ro0o,bonedoc59,-8,Sat Jul 5 01:34:41 2014 UTC,"People always leave this out during discussions of court cases, but I want to clarify something:  1) There is a legal requirement that an argument be put forward that is convincing that this result would not have come about but for the actions of the physician. If the jury rules against the physician, but this argument has not been plausibly made, the judge can set aside the ruling. It's actually a fairly high bar, which is why malpractice is pretty much always about settlements and not defense failures in court - because no one loses these, pretty much ever. (Settlement is the ins. co finding settlements more predictable and cheaper than taking shit to court). To be clear: the judge did not set it aside. The judge was more familiar with the arguments than you are from a single vague-ass article.  2) The judge and jury were exposed to all the details and arguments from both sides. You are reading a single vague-ass article. Maybe, if particularly interested, you might read two or three incomplete articles with out of context quotes. The people who made the decisions are more familiar with the case than you are.  Points 1 & 2 should be reiterated at the beginning of every bitch-and-moan session about a court ruling on the internet. But, let's add point 3,  3) If he'd secured a pt hx he probably would've been more cautious reading the chest x-ray. Securing the patient history is not an unreasonable standard to hold a physician to during the diagnostic process. A referring physician failing include it up front is not a legal defense. A judge/jury is not unreasonable in concluding he could've chased the referring doc down and gotten a hx, even if we recognize in practice why we might not have done so.   The hx, more than ""he misinterpreted the opacities "", was probably the reason he lost. You generally have to show a mistake was the single conclusive cause of a negative outcome to meet the bar for malpractice torts - that it could not and would not have come about otherwise. Article didn't discuss cancer type, but assuming ""lung cancer"", pt. was probably going to end up dead regardless, and soon. The only exception to the ""would not have happened but for [the malpractice]"" rule that is common in the states, to my knowledge, is prima facie malpractice: when any reasonable person looks at a physician's action and says ""wow, what a fuckup"" (e.g., that OB in NY about 20 years ago who carved his initials into a woman after delivering her kid). The plaintiff probably sought the prima facie case, under the argument of ""even a med student knows you don't make a dx without a history.""  source: not a fucking lawyer.   addendum: you guys realize she'll never get the 16mil, right? The ins. co. approaches these folks and says ""you can have the 16 mil over 20 years, or we can give you 1.5mil today."" That's how this business works."
Radiology,29ro0o,DrArkades,5,Thu Jul 3 22:35:34 2014 UTC,"You're awful pissed here.  Do you think this was trial was in a court of ""peers?""   Also, regardless of what will actually be paid, 16 mil is a ridiculous settlement.  Most plans have an upper limit.  This means that one simple mistake will likely ruin this physician.  We are all fallible humans.  We all make mistakes.  We do this while trying to help our fellow man.  Things like this are truly disheartening while striving for this goal"

Radiology,29qcdm,Roentgenator,2,Thu Jul 3 19:33:10 2014 UTC,"So I'm a final year RT student and one of my final practicals is a trauma series. I did the above series and failed. I basically failed because my accessor stopped me as I was taking a vertical ray AP of the knee. I was doing this to show the deformity caused by the fracture. She said I needed to take the shots AP with regards to the knee (i.e. the 2 'angled tube' shots).  I was just wondering if anyone thought I had any grounds to appeal the result?  My first post here, I hope it all made sense.  edit: for some reason I uploaded two of every image"
Radiology,29qcdm,2defmouze,3,Thu Jul 3 11:00:05 2014 UTC,"Her reasoning would be something along the lines of you need an AP and lateral film for each examination and the image you were going to create would not of been one of these it would of been an oblique.  You'd then have to do an AP to rule out any fractures within the joint as this wouldn't be clearly demonstrated.  Your image could've provided useful information but it has no landmark of reference, basically the views are standardised so the person reporting has a baseline/control for each film.  No harm in appealing but I don't think you'll get anything from it.  She'd argue that it's just needlessly irradiatating the patient to get information that's not really required..."
Radiology,29qcdm,MK12Mod0SuperSoaker,3,Thu Jul 3 12:32:31 2014 UTC,"I'm of two minds.  Taking true APs is helpful from a standardisation perspective. It allows the surgeon and radiologist to have better understand what is going on, by determining the deviation from the norm.  With the ""true APs"" you can see shards lateral and medial to the femur, which are not as easily demonstrated on the oblique AP. It also allows the viewer to determine the medio-lateral displacement of the femur (the anterior displacement of the shaft is demonstrated on the HBL), which the oblique does not. Further, I think it demonstrates the patella more effectively.  The oblique provides more information which is always useful. If I'm viewing it correctly, the tibia seems to be internally rotating, whereas the femur is externally rotating, which could be an important finding, if my observation is correct.  Personally, in cases like that, I might be tempted to take an x-ray as is, to assess the scope of damage. I would still strongly endeavour to provide as close to text-book as I could.  I think the situation is complicated further as: I work in the UK and I'm not a student. From what I understand our scope of practice and autonomy varies somewhat. I also remember as a student, I had to work to the whims of the person supervising me (which wasn't terribly pleasant). Whereas, when you're qualified and working under your own registration/license, I think there's a bit more leeway - you have to justify your own actions (not, justify them to someone else whom you acting in proxy), usually to your boss. If you can explain why what you had done would be of benefit to the patient and did not cause them detriment; and would considerably impact their future care. If you could put forth a convincing argument detailing that, then you may be able to have the decision considered further."
Radiology,29qcdm,TardisTechnologist,2,Thu Jul 3 12:42:51 2014 UTC,"You're gold here.   I'm certain that you already have experienced, now that you're final year, that instructors (assessors) are self-important cunts.  You know this, and it is the reason you are asking this question here. They (those grading you) attain fairly medium requirements in education, as all technologist based curriculum is. Many in charge of such things cast subjective and weak opinion on this very thing with all the authority they feel entitled to...perhaps even encouraged to do so, by other poorly educated individuals.  You'll not discover anything relevant beyond images 1-3.  That's the exam.  All information needed by the orthopod is present in that set, plus hip joint in image 4. Final assessment of repair would be had when the leg is put in traction during neuromuscular blocking. ""True AP /LAT"" or whatever fucking bullshit is being spouted by the person grading you is bollocks here.  Particularly so, if they don't fully understand how the orthopedic surgeon uses planar radiographs to assess their approach. If they failed you, then clearly they do not. As well, I've not worked with any radiologist who would need more than your total set for the specified examination of femur.  Remember that you will (assumption) be appealing the decision to a tech-expert, and not an actual bona fide expert on the final utility of said images.  We do this to assist the expert practitioners of medical science, not to conform to some jackass opinion of aesthetic irrelevance."

Radiology,29lcly,anaerobyte,3,Wed Jul 2 02:02:14 2014 UTC,"by just reading the abstract, that article is trying to use paraspinal muscle denervation as an indicator of nerve root avulsion, which is usually traumatic.  the acute phase of denervation usually shows edema (t2 bright) and enhancement (bright on post contrast images) within muscles so it makes sense."
Radiology,29lcly,meatyanddelicious,1 point,Wed Jul 2 21:57:19 2014 UTC,"Specifically I am interested in the regions of hyperintensity posterior to C5/C6. The symptoms fit with a radiculopathy on the left > right, but the imaging doesn't seem to fit with cervical spondylosis, disc herniation, or degenerative disease. Wondering if it could be some sort of neoplasm.   On the transverse images, you can also see enhancement of the paraspinal muscles at that level, which I've read can suggest reactive change due to rheumatoid arthritis-related damage. The patient has no tenderness, but describes crepitus to palpation of the muscles overlying the spinous processes and frequently cracking his neck."

Radiology,29gmf3,hairheads3,2,Tue Jul 1 03:02:53 2014 UTC,"I did not down vote. But I can explain why some would down vote. Sometimes clinicians treat radiology like we are some kind of hand maidens or lackeys just there to do their bidding. That kind of attitude tends to get people's back up. It is one thing to say ""do a sky line view because I told you to"" and another thing entirely to say "" this view will let me decide if I need to do a huge revision or a much smaller lateral locking plate"". I think this goes both ways. A radiologist who says ""I refuse to do this view"" is a lot different from one who says ""this view is very painful and we are unlikely to get good positioning - what about if we try this alternative instead""."
Radiology,29gmf3,Jonette2,1 point,Tue Jul 1 14:44:40 2014 UTC,"Ya but do you know we have to bend the knee to get that view. I make the ortho Drs manipulate, when they see what we have to do, most times they change their minds. I'm not torturing patients."

This is so interesting to me...so much so that I'm starting to think about going into radiology instead of endocrinology like I've been planning! I wonder if you could explain to me some additional things I'm wondering about. In several slides, I can see that the contrast in some parts of the small intestine is outlined by a much thicker strip of gray than in some other slides or compared to other parts of my small intestine. In some there is only a little bit of white in the middle. Does this imply thickening of the bowel walls in those areas? In the slide ""36-37/76"", there is an area circled in red at the bottom near the beginning of the tail bone; is this my rectum, and is the thick light gray outline/circle indicative of something?  Also, am I correct in assuming that the contrast never made it into the colon (or only a little)? It's mostly black outlined by gray, some slides showing it filled with gray too but with specks of black, reminds me of a sponge - is that how stool looks on CT? And then, on some slides (like 61-64/86), I see what looks like bowel of which the walls are outlined in a brighter gray than the rest and the inside is black or darker gray. What am I seeing here?   Thanks again, I really appreciate your answers. I expect to get the radiologist report back soon but until then I'm fascinated by what I'm looking at."
Radiology,29dcaq,helpful_grey,3,Sun Jun 29 19:46:37 2014 UTC,"Glad you're interested. It's a very challenging and interesting field :)  I'm not really sure what you're referring to as far as the small bowel goes.  What you have circled on 36-37/76 is your uterus ;)  No, I don't see contrast in your colon, and yes, that's how stool looks.  On 61-64/86, you may again be referring to the uterus, but I'm not sure based on your description."
Radiology,29dcaq,shadowa4,1 point,Sun Jun 29 23:18:33 2014 UTC,"Ah, I see. Ha! I was looking at lots of diagrams and labelled CT scans and I kept going back and forth between thinking it's the rectum and thinking it's the uterus. Now I see it! Thanks very much for the anatomy lesson :)  On 61-64/86 I'm pretty sure it's not my uterus I'm referring to because it does look like loops of bowel. Sorry for the bad description! I see what looks to be intestines that are outlined in a thicker(?), brighter gray compared to the rest of the intestines. I circled in red the area I'm talking about and uploaded the edited picture: http://s1370.photobucket.com/user/Noachka/media/A%20and%20P%20CT%20Scan%20June%202014/61to64-86annotated_zpsba9152e9.jpeg.html  I had thought that a bright gray, thicker outline suggested inflammation/thickening of the bowel wall, which would be relevant since they're looking for signs of Crohn's and which I'm therefore curious about. I was also under the impression that the same is true for loops of bowel white with contrast but with a thicker gray outline than the rest, like on some of the other slides. Since it wasn't obvious what I was describing, though, I guess it's safe to assume it doesn't stick out as anything abnormal and is not indicative of any of that! :-] I know I should just wait to get the report back instead of wondering about it myself but patience is not my strong suit when it comes to my bowels [in more ways than one, if you get my drift]. Lol...!"
Radiology,29dcaq,emu11,2,Mon Jun 30 03:53:01 2014 UTC,"I don't think it looks inflamed / thickened based on the few sections I saw, but regardless, your gold standard for testing for Crohn's is a scope. You wouldn't really be able to rule it out or in based on one CT."
Radiology,29dcaq,shadowa4,1 point,Sat Jul 5 14:46:40 2014 UTC,"Thanks! I was told that the CT didn't show anything so you're right. I had a scope 3 years ago but it didn't show anything. My symptoms were milder and, it being a colonoscopy, it wasn't enough to rule out small bowel involvement. It's almost unbelievable how sure my doctors were that they would find obvious Crohn's (one of my doctors was betting on seeing a volvulus in light of the palpable ""lump""), but so far there is no obvious Dx at all :P Anyway thanks again...can't wait to learn some radiology (I've got a few more years until med school, though)."
Radiology,29dcaq,shadowa4,2,Tue Jul 8 02:31:25 2014 UTC,I'm more concerned with the mA on this scan. 441mA? Damn.
Radiology,29dcaq,tonho91,6,Sun Jun 29 06:01:51 2014 UTC,"The patient looks to be larger than average, and the scanner might not have asir software. Looks about right to me...what type of mA would you see used?"
Radiology,29dcaq,shadowa4,2,Sun Jun 29 11:59:28 2014 UTC,"Patient (me) is 163 cm and ~72 kg. Would that justify the higher exposure? Related question: when I look at other pictures of CT scans online, they all look different from mine in terms of the brightness/darkness. I mean, they seem to have less contrast between the organs seen, as opposed to mine, in which the small intestine is very white, the colon looks black and outlined with gray and some white, and then everything else looks to be the same shades of gray I've been seeing in other pictures online. I would think it's because I had contrast and the other pictures were without, but that doesn't seem to be the case because I was looking at pictures of CT with contrast. I had both IV and oral contrast, but instead of barium for oral I was given gastrografin. It is actually only because the mA was higher than normal?"
Radiology,29dcaq,shadowa4,3,Sun Jun 29 19:04:06 2014 UTC,"The high mA probably has nothing to do with those details you mentioned. It's hard to describe the differences you encountered without seeing the actual images you are comparing them to. However, bowel loops will appear ""white"" with either barium prep or gastrografin. As far as overall contrast and density differences, there are a number of factors that can make your scan ""different"" to others. For example, IV contrast enhancement can be imaged in a number of phases (arterial, venous, renal, etc) each one of these providing different density values for several organ systems. Lastly, the images you are comparing could have different window level/width settings (density/contrast manipulation)."

Radiology,293c2x,Roman736,1 point,Thu Jun 26 14:45:48 2014 UTC,"Yes. I subscribe to this. There is no evidence of bone damage, the swelling isn't really on the articulation, and it goes away with ibuprofen.   Chronic inflammation of damaged soft tissue. May be bursa leaking. May be just inflammation.   I'm puzzled regarding the metal shard. It's strange that you didn't knew about it, when it went in, how, etc. I suspect it was part of the trauma incident.   An MRI is in order, X-ray don't and won't show anything."

Radiology,293c2x,maegan0apple,1 point,Thu Jun 26 05:57:01 2014 UTC,This is what I was thinking. It's also possible that there was some kind of disruption with subsequent scar formation of the tendon sheaths that is now causing some kind of chronic bursitis/tendonitis.
Radiology,293c2x,maegan0apple,4,Thu Jun 26 13:35:26 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure the injury happened while curling about 3 years ago. I fell on the ice with the broom between fingers on my right hand. For a couple months after I would get a sharp pain if I struck something with the injured finger at the right angle.  Today I will still get a sharp pain if I hit the finger on something at some angles. However what is bothering me more is the constant pain I'm in after using the finger for a while. Since I work as a programmer this is nearly every day.  Ibuprofen takes 90% of the pain away. But I don't want to be stuck taking a few every day.  A little piece of metal is visible in the x-ray. I had that removed hoping it would fix the problem. I didn't use the finger much for a week or so after the surgery. Most of the pain was gone for at least 3 or 4 weeks but eventually came back as I used the finger more.
Radiology,293c2x,AnotherRadiologist,3,Wed Jun 25 21:05:53 2014 UTC,Perhaps some foreign body on the PIP 3rd Digit. Do you have all images that are available?

Radiology,28t8ds,watokelwapo,3,Tue Jun 24 23:16:20 2014 UTC,"Hi, I'm a British radiographer and I worked in Namibia for two years.  I went with the NGO Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) which is like the British version of the Peace Corps.  I'd wanted to work in Africa since the days of Band Aid and Live Aid (mid 80s) and VSO was the easiest way to get there.  I worked in a large rural hospital, about 700km from the capital.  We had two xray rooms, one a new screening and tomo unit and one a general floor mounted unit, with films and screens, proper wet developing in big tanks of chemicals and an electric fan to dry the films!  Namibia's a huge country with a very sparse population and, at the time, very poor infrastructure.  I  saw very little trauma, simply because patients didn't survive the trip to hospital; there were no ambulances and distances were huge.  I remember seeing an RTA on my day off - I stopped to help but those victims weren't already dead were being piled into pick-ups for the journey to my hospital.  None of them were alive the next day.  The bulk of our work was chest radiography for TB and HIV related infection, both in adults and children.  TB was endemic and just about every patient had a CXR, regardless of their symptoms.  We did a lot of barium swallows as well; ca oesophagus was pretty common and sadly, patients tended to present very late.  This was partly because of stoicism and partly economic.  The hospital charged a small fee and many patients delayed seeking medical treatment in the hope that they would get better.  Our patients were mostly subsistence farmers and if they had no transport could have to walk for up to two days to reach us; a four day absence from a homestead could lead to crop failure, lost livestock and potential starvation for their family.    This was the most difficult aspect for me, that people were placed in such impossible situations.  They struggled through such a hard life, facing decisions that we in the west would never have to, yet were always so grateful for the care and attention they received from us.  We sometimes had a four hour wait just for xray but I never received a single complaint from a patient - can you imagine that in the UK or US?  I learned the local language (in fact, my Reddit user name is a greeting in that dialect) but most of the staff wanted to practice their English so I was never as fluent as I would have liked.  Instead, my non-verbal communication skills improved a lot, and I thought far more about how I came across to my patients.  I've carried this with me and I think I relate far better to people in general as a result of my time in Africa.   I was there just five years after Namibia gained independence from South Africa (not many people know that Namibia was subject to apartheid in the same way as SA was). Black Namibians weren't allowed to go to university or train as professionals under apartheid and so there were no local radiographers in the whole country.  I worked with 5 local ""radiography assistants"" who had varying degrees of knowledge and training.  Some had been in exile in Germany or Cuba and had received training there; their theoretical knowledge wasn't great but their practical skills were excellent. And some had just drifted into the job and been trained by their colleagues.  One older gentleman didn't understand about radiation safety and dosimetry at all - if he left his film badge at home he wore his lead coat all day - but could produce the most perfect skull series I've ever seen.    I did a lot of hands on training with my five colleagues, as well as more formal workshops for other assistants in the region.  They always wanted to learn as much as they could, even if they'd been up since 4am to tend to their farm.  I'd like to think that I passed on some of my skills and perhaps made a very small difference to some people living very difficult lives.  But, to be honest, I got far more out of my experience than I was able to put in.  I have a broader view of the world and a greater understanding of the problems within it; I'm far more appreciative of my life in the UK and of the NHS, and I can relate to my patients even if there's a language barrier!  Sorry about the huge wall of text, let me know if you need anything else - and good luck with your assignment."

Radiology,28fer4,florinchen,5,Wed Jun 18 23:43:36 2014 UTC,"The acetabular cup is either loose or was put in severely wrong.  Either way, it appears there is abundant h.o.  Likely autofused.  If that's the case, probably doesn't hurt a great deal.  Limb is shortened and likely has no motion at hip.  That is an orthopaedists nightmare right there"
Radiology,28fer4,Questfreaktoo,4,Wed Jun 18 10:46:10 2014 UTC,Ugh that makes my hips hurt just thinking about it!  How on earth was she moving around?
Radiology,28fer4,EllaMinnow,4,Wed Jun 18 04:47:30 2014 UTC,She was walking with one of those walkers with a seat. It's pretty amazing how much mobility she has!
Radiology,28fer4,Catan_mode,3,Wed Jun 18 04:58:15 2014 UTC,does she have diabetes? Just wondering if there's something up with her pain sensation as well ...
Radiology,28fer4,maegan0apple,4,Wed Jun 18 08:38:06 2014 UTC,"Not sure about her having diabetes however in 2013 the clinical history stated she ""could barely walk"". Why she has not relocated her hip is a question I cannot answer. She was more concerned about her shoulders being in pain rather than her hips."
Radiology,28fer4,sexybicuriouslady,2,Wed Jun 18 09:10:42 2014 UTC,Yeah because she took the load off that leg and placed it onto the other and her arms. Surprised she could handle it.
Radiology,28fer4,Elixir86,2,Wed Jun 18 16:14:21 2014 UTC,Dictated report: The colon is loaded with faeces suggesting constipation. There is no evidence of acute bowel obstruction. The dislocated left total hip replacement with significant acetabular protuberance and expansion is again shown.  2013 report: There is marked ballooning of the left acetabular cavity with well defined circumscribed margin. The intervening space has tiny sub millimetre metal fragments which extends along the femoral stem creating periprostetic lucency. The acetabular cup is displaced and is lying anteromedially in this expanded cavity. Periprostetic fracture is observed along the upper lateral part of the femoral shaft. Overall the features are indicative of chronic metallosis in the left hip joint with periprostetic loosening and periprostetic fracture.
Radiology,28fer4,djmammo,3,Wed Jun 18 23:42:31 2014 UTC,"85 y.o female. Previously had a pelvis & both hip x-rays in 2013 where the same dislocation has been noted (yes, this patient neglected to relocate her left hip for over a year!). The hip replacement was performed overseas on 2013 (not sure where overseas).   This AXR was requested by her referring doctor as she had a change in bowel habit."
Radiology,28fti5,minermedic,2,Wed Jun 18 06:11:45 2014 UTC,"Hx in the album description. Apologies at the contrast, I'll see about adding better images if requested."
Radiology,28e0q8,Bantrixx,21,Tue Jun 17 18:21:17 2014 UTC,Before a radiologist reads films he/she usually would have a background and history of the patient and coming here should be no different. What's your story? Trauma? Age? History of injury? Etc.   Not a radiologist but the first thing I notice is a broken collimator. ;)
Radiology,28e0q8,MDAdvice,10,Tue Jun 17 18:55:21 2014 UTC,"Looking up collimator now. :)  Edit: well, silly me."
Radiology,28e0q8,hughthewineguy,3,Tue Jun 17 19:12:56 2014 UTC,"Thank you for responding!  Gave birth jan 26 2014, had 4 botched epidurals, 1 successful and 1 blood patch epidural due to spinal leak. For some reason my Dr didn't order lumbar X-rays. Anaestesiologist suggested I had spurs that caused him to hit nerves.  Since blood patch/epidurals, I've had pain/pressure at the base of my skull that radiates all the way down my spine. Constant sensation of falling backwards, neck pain and back pain, sound is altered in which everyone sounds like they're on helium. Constant heart palpitations. But the neck and back of head pain and vertigo is intense. I was also advised that no neurologist will see me or order an MRI without an x-ray first.   I have been concerned that I may have a spinal leak still but I've read (dr google, hah!), that the likelihood of that is very low, but again, no lumbar X-rays.  Thank you again for taking a look, my Dr is busy and I'm anxious for answers.  Edit: I'm 31 female."
Radiology,28e0q8,MDAdvice,16,Tue Jun 17 19:08:12 2014 UTC,I see absolutely no indication to do plain films with that history. Especially 8 of them. Plain films look for bony abnormalities - and if anyone can give me a spinal bony cause of a change in hearing perception I will quit my job.
Radiology,28e0q8,CremasterReflex,9,Tue Jun 17 23:01:03 2014 UTC,This is an American thing.  Need to get the plain film before they will pay for the MRI.  It's insane.
Radiology,28e0q8,intervenroentgen,1 point,Wed Jun 18 00:38:02 2014 UTC,"i am pretty sure in the US people can get an MRI without plain film, i don't know why that is not the case here."
Radiology,28e0q8,laika84,5,Wed Jun 18 01:20:51 2014 UTC,"Correct.  They can get one.  Their insurance company may just refuse to pay for it.   We have issues with prior authorization (except with Medicare).  If the insurance company has not pre-authorized the exam then it will not get reimbursed.  Pre-authorization is generally not provided in the absence of plain film as it is far cheaper to get the diagnosis on plain film versus doing an MRI for every patient with back pain.  If the film is diagnostic no further imaging may be indicated, thus costing the insurer an order of magnitude less than the MR. If it is negative then the cost to the insurer is relatively small compared to the MRI. Certainly there are exceptions (i.e. emergent cases such as epidural abscess), but for chronic back pain, you would be hard pressed to get the MRI covered as the first diagnostic test."
Radiology,28e0q8,intervenroentgen,4,Wed Jun 18 01:46:04 2014 UTC,Which isn't actually that absurd. MRI of the spine is clinically irrelevant in the majority of cases.
Radiology,28e0q8,CremasterReflex,7,Wed Jun 18 02:18:23 2014 UTC,"Inner ear fracture....? [Jk, please don't quit, we need you...]"

Radiology,28e0q8,Jonette2,3,Wed Jun 18 04:20:32 2014 UTC,Yeah that's totally what I was thinking of. I don't know why I said inner ear. I should probably pull the books back off the shelf and do some refreshing.

In adults, Paget disease, and Engelmann disease can also produce spinal and bony changes with hearing loss. They are systemic conditions though not primarily neurological or vertebral..."
Radiology,28e0q8,DefinitelyNotCraig,2,Wed Jun 18 00:47:54 2014 UTC,"I was advised that the X-rays were needed before a neurologist would see me or before I could get an MRI. I just really hope that they won't send me back for another x-ray of the lumbar because it's just delaying my getting any answers. I wish the lumbar was ordered the first time around to ensure no further delay.  Thank you for your input, sincerely."
Radiology,28e0q8,hughthewineguy,2,Tue Jun 17 23:20:15 2014 UTC,"Back in the day, neurosyphilis would have one upped this dazzling display of  brinkmanship..."

Radiology,28e0q8,hughthewineguy,6,Wed Jun 18 07:50:02 2014 UTC,"This has been going on for 6 months?   This does not sound like a lumbar spine issue, which would typically present with weakness or numbness in the legs or potentially with problems with bladder and bowel control.   Based on the vertigo and changes in your hearing perception as well as the headaches, I might focus more on the brainstem, meninges, and potentially the upper cervical spine. Time to see a neurologist."

Radiology,28e0q8,hughthewineguy,-7,Sat Jun 21 18:01:53 2014 UTC,"i would press your doctor to have lumbar shots taken.  it was an insertion of a needle into the lumbar spine which preceded the onset of your symptoms, and the person that stuck it in there reckons it was something wrong with your spine which caused the issue. yet currently you have no films to prove or disprove their theory. there is some minor osteophyte formation visible on the thoracic views. that doesn't mean there is or is not the same thing occuring in the lumbar spine, but without lumbar films, noone will ever know.  it would be an incredibly, incredibly skeptical viewpoint to suggest that the reason that no lumbars were shot was to cover the asses of the doctors involved, by doing what from the outside may seem like a reasonably thorough investigation, but to leave out anything that proves anything one way or the other.  BUT i can't help thinking it.  chances are, even if you did have them, you will see nothing on the lumbar films. where i am, there's no way to order advanced imaging (eg. MRI, where there may be evidence of something awry) without first taking xrays. so, get the lumbar films taken. and if your doctor does not want them taken then keep asking why, until there is some sort of response that makes sense to you. this is your body, and your health, and your future living with whatever has happened, you need to be your own  biggest advocate.  i really, really am sorry this has happened. there are risks with every medical procedure. doctors are human, and fallible. i have a friend who had to re-learn how to walk after a spinal tap went wrong. it should not happen, but the risks are there, and, sometimes it cannot be helped, even when there is a hugely experienced physician involved. even so, four botched epidurals is pretty shithouse. there was a book i read a few years ago, Medical Error and Medical Narcissism, by John Banja which delves into why doctors are so unable to say ""i am sorry. i fucked up."" to their patients (instead of, for instance, blaming your body and spurs which may or may not be present) and how this reluctance or inability to do so, is actually more problematic than just saying ""i'm sorry.""  in terms of what to do, other than pursuing the necessary medical investigation, have you found anything that helps with the symptoms that you are dealing with?"
Radiology,28e0q8,MDAdvice,5,Tue Jun 17 20:21:55 2014 UTC,"Alright, not that your points about being your own advocate are wrong, but there superficially seems like a very good reason why lumbar films weren't taken yet, and that's because her symptoms don't really sound related to the lumbar spine, like at all, and the likelihood that lumbar spine films would be able to add any useful information is small."
Radiology,28e0q8,hughthewineguy,1 point,Tue Jun 17 21:59:00 2014 UTC,"because her symptoms don't really sound related to the lumbar spine, like at all,   hmm, apart from the fact that the onset of symptoms followed four botched epidurals.  subdural bleed, in the lumbar, seems to me about the one thing that it would be helpful to rule in or out. perhaps you wouldn't see anything on plain film, but where i am plain film is the required first step before ordering advanced imaging. if she could just go get an MRI, then hell yeah, skip the plain film.  but to suggest there's no reason to examine the lumbar spine when the only traumatic event is in the lumbar spine, that boggles my brain!"
Radiology,28e0q8,MDAdvice,5,Tue Jun 17 23:05:48 2014 UTC,"If you have an explanation of the pathophysiological mechanism behind a lumbar subdural bleed that is apparently not large enough to cause symptoms of neurogenic claudication causing what seems to be CNVIII dysfunction, I'd love to hear it."
Radiology,28e0q8,hughthewineguy,-1,Wed Jun 18 00:19:40 2014 UTC,"you seem very sure there is no problem in the lumbar. yet that is the one place where summin's happened. but yeah, let's not look there??  the nervous system is pretty incredible, and one day, maybe, we will understand it. until then, there's a pile of shit that happens in people's nervous systems that don't have some simple pahtophysiological basis."
Radiology,28e0q8,vnarsenal,4,Wed Jun 18 01:26:51 2014 UTC,Her symptoms clearly don't localize to the lumbar spine.
Radiology,28e0q8,vnarsenal,-1,Wed Jun 18 03:03:05 2014 UTC,"no. but if she can't get an MRI without lumbar films, would it not make sense to take them?"
Radiology,28e0q8,vnarsenal,6,Wed Jun 18 03:56:57 2014 UTC,"I think the discrepancy here is that it doesn't make medical sense to take plain films, but for some insurance/documentation reason they need to be done."
Radiology,28e0q8,hughthewineguy,0,Wed Jun 18 10:39:20 2014 UTC,"indeed. dunno what the rules are in the US, or why ppl on here are so dead set against the damn idea, but if some anaesthesiologist is claiming they hit nerves due to spurs, then that needs evidence.  dunno bout you, but someone suggesting the problem with their 4 botched epidurals is posterior osteophyte formation (let alone anything large enough to actually get in the way) in a 31yo female without systemic disease or any other predisposing condition, sounds like a preeetty big stretch!"
Radiology,28e0q8,vnarsenal,1 point,Wed Jun 18 20:01:42 2014 UTC,"This was my assumption as well, but my Doctor seems to think its unrelated to the epidurals for the same reasons stated above. My symptoms do not add up I guess?"

Radiology,284af8,StinkyS,10,Sat Jun 14 08:07:05 2014 UTC,I work at a couple of different hospitals and one of them is like this. There are at least 8 radiologists and I swear that they get paid by the word. If a report isn't at least 3 pages something seriously bad has happened to the doctor.  Another hospital I work at (Level 2 Trauma) there are even more radiologists but if you get a report that's longer than half a page something seriously wrong has happened with the patient.  It's funny comparing the two differing styles. I can tell you that I greatly prefer the latter. If it's a WNL study there is no need for elaborate detail about the pancreas and every other organ being grossly normal.

With a report like that I know that 30% of the people I read films for would cheer, 40% would be indifferent, and 30% would text/call/email me right away asking if this means there WAS disease but it could not be measured or if I actually looked at some structure or other (to which I always want to respond: ""no, I only looked at the liver""). Alternatively if I dictate a lot of detail I get the similar results only this time the nattering 30% call to complain about length of report .

Under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the NRC may enter into an agreement with a State for discontinuance of the NRC's regulatory authority over some materials licensees within the State.   In effect, predominant nuclear industry players in a given state spend a suitcase or two of money to petition the state government to make their own rules  The State must first show that its regulatory program is compatible with the NRC's and adequate to protect public health and safety.  But let's be realistic.  A team of lawyers must convince a judge with next to zero technical competency to approve such a measure.  Further, the federal government effectively washes its hands of liability at that point.  In Utah, for example, it is lawful to refine arbitrary radioactive material without a license as long as decay products (regardless of momentum or kinetic energy) don't leave your property."

Radiology,27zp5t,Xrae300,5,Fri Jun 20 16:37:11 2014 UTC,"Nevada tech here, I also live in one of the few states where a license isn't required to work in radiology, with the exception of nuclear medicine. Technically, you don't need a license to work in CT, MRI, or X-Ray but good luck finding a hospital that's willing to hire you without licensure from the ARRT regardless of how much experience you may have. The only semi-positive thing about this is that we are able to hire student interns that have demonstrated they are competent to the clinical coordinator and can perform all exams with efficiency and without direct supervision. Once they have completed their program, they have six months to get licensed or they lose their job. It's really only a matter of time until there's a bill passed that will make it mandatory for hospitals to only hire licensed technologists. As a side note, we have a guy working in our special procedures department that's easily clearing $100k+ a year who has no formal education at all in radiology and not a single credential. He was a transporter when the hospital first opened and they couldn't find anyone to fill a vacant spot in specials so he volunteered and they were willing to train him. You tend to see him take the day off whenever the joint commission or any direct executives are making hospital visits out of paranoia. He's pretty close to retirement age with all the money he's accumulated since he's been there so he's not too worried about losing his job in the future once licensure becomes mandatory."
Radiology,27zp5t,Joshua21B,8,Fri Jun 13 02:33:15 2014 UTC,"NC tech here -  Yes, there is currently no requirement in the state of North Carolina for the people operating radiologic equipment to be certified, licensed, or otherwise credentialed in any way.  The exception to that is that Joint Commission accredited facilities are required to employ registered technologists in order to maintain accreditation.  This means that in most any large facility, you will find only registered technologists.  In small private offices, urgent care facilities, and chiropractic offices with imaging capabilities, it may very well be the secretary who takes your xrays.  I've heard some horror stories for sure, but never anything as extreme as untrained people working in radiation therapy setting.  The NCSRT is working very hard and very closely with the state legislature to get standardized licensure enacted, but it is harder than many assume.  The legislature must be convinced that this can be done without causing immediate loss of jobs for non-registered technologists and without incurring extra expenditures to the state government, which is already struggling.  Likewise, in order to get all the registered technologists on board, you must convince them that it will not cost them excessive annual fees.  As much as we all care about safety in radiology, very few techs will vote for it in private if they're told it will cost them a couple hundred dollars a year.  The last I heard, however, there is a private firm which estimates it can handle the licensing logistics at a cost of around $40 per license, which should keep everyone happy.  Regarding the potential loss of jobs for all those untrained people currently acting as techs in small offices, and the added cost to those facilities if they had to employ registered technologists - I believe there is some sort of limited licensure clause in the bill that would allow those people to keep their jobs by acquiring some basic radiation safety training.  If anyone has any questions about this issue, I know the technologist cited in the article and can try to get more specific details."
Radiology,27zp5t,Spacecadet79,3,Thu Jun 12 21:23:27 2014 UTC,"Oklahoma tech here. Oklahoma likewise does not require licensure to operate imaging equipment. You can be confident that hospitals employ credentialed technologists. However, it's not just ""hole-in-the-wall"" doctor offices or urgent care clinics who allow untrained people perform imaging exams. I work for a very large healthcare organization which consists of several of the largest hospitals in the state, as well as an entire network of probably hundreds of physicians and care providers. It is my observation that 90% of these physician and care providers' offices are staffed and imaging performed by individuals who do not have the appropriate education as made standard by the ARRT. It's a travesty. The imaging is often horrible and is often repeated due to image quality, resulting in patients being exposed to more radiation than necessary.  So, if you are having a study in Oklahoma, if it's not being done in a hospital, it absolutely could be a medical assistant, a nurse, a secretary, or anyone but a registered technologist performing your study."
Radiology,27zp5t,Weenie,3,Thu Jun 12 22:02:13 2014 UTC,"I'm a radiography student in NC. North Carolina is one of about 5 states that doesn't have any license requirement right now. The way it has been explained to me is that it is not so much an issue in the hospitals (who hire ARRT registered technologist) as it is in the little hole in the wall doctors offices (urgent care) who have doctors who are more interested in saving money than in patient care. These small doctors offices, that do x-rays and save money by hiring someone who is not qualified, have been lobbying against the passing of a licensing standard. I've been told that the bill has been getting closer to getting passed every time it has been introduced so fingers crossed on this one."
Radiology,27zp5t,Aggietoker,3,Thu Jun 12 21:00:04 2014 UTC,"I work in Texas and we currently have a state licensure program. I heard a rumor not to long ago that there was some bill trying to get rid of the licensure program, in order to reduce or lower future wages of incoming technologists. Has anyone else heard anything of the same?"
Radiology,27zp5t,Xray_paid,2,Fri Jun 13 02:36:36 2014 UTC,"I can't address any issues in Texas specifically, but one of the primary issues that comes with licensure is technologist wages.  When doctors' offices are able to assign radiologic responsibilities to nurses, medical assistants, or even front desk clerks, wages go down.  When they are required to hire credentialed specialists, they have to compete with the big hospitals and they have to pay more.  Doctors who have an interest in keeping their overhead down while offering radiologic services in house will lobby against RT licensure.  A bill to eliminate licensure would not surprise me at all, particularly in a red state where a majority might believe that government involvement is a bad thing."

Radiology,27zp5t,hairheads3,2,Fri Jun 13 01:55:07 2014 UTC,"Oklahoma is also a non registered state. Apparently the state was trying for years to require all techs be registered, but the radiation safety board didn't push for it so it didn't happen. I know the Radiologist that is head of the radiation safety board and he says the reason they didn't push for it was because it was going to negatively impact the smaller medical offices where assistants perform maybe a dozen xrays a year. Those offices would be required to either hire an actual tech or never perform xrays in their offices."

Radiology,27wk85,diagnosticimaging,16,Wed Jun 11 20:02:54 2014 UTC,"No. This guy clearly should have just trained as a radiologist if he thinks 'watching moving internal organs' is cool. Guess what? Thats what we do all the time! (Well, here in Europe anyway, I gather the US radiologists don't do their own ultrasounds?)  These devices are NOT approved for diagnostic use, there is no decent Doppler, power flow, or harmonics, and in unskilled and untrained hands there is no guarantee for finding anything, or indeed just making up findings.  What's next? Taking a microscope around so you can 'look at really cool cells at the bedside'?"
Radiology,27wk85,plutocrat,8,Wed Jun 11 22:07:42 2014 UTC,"Sure, but ultrasound performed outside of radiology departments certainly has a role. In the hospital I work at, emergency physicians routinely perform trauma FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma) scans with narrow diagnostic mandates. Their use is backed by good evidence.  Equally, central access is enormously aided in the ICU setting by bedside ultrasound.  For me, the issue is not that front-line clinicians have access to ultrasound, but rather that the use is rationally shaped and limited."
Radiology,27wk85,thebigslide,1 point,Wed Jun 11 23:28:02 2014 UTC,"Indeed, though there's no reason that a proper portable ultrasound machine couldn't be used for those applications and it really has little to do with the value of radiologists.  Moreover, there's simply no good reason for a device in the marketplace that can't produces images of diagnostic value consistently and reliably.  On the matter of ""Will this devalue radiologists?"" I strongly object to the question's framing.  Does the introduction of a pocket sized instrument kit devaule surgeons?  Give me a break.  But a more apt analogy would be to ask if the widespread sale of remote control scale model helicopters devaules actual helicopter pilots."
Radiology,27wk85,Hypno-phile,1 point,Thu Jun 12 18:16:38 2014 UTC,"Well, there's one reason-there is no such machine in my building. Even our local hospital doesn't have ultrasound techs in the building 24/7."
Radiology,27wk85,thebigslide,0,Thu Jun 12 18:38:25 2014 UTC,There's still a lack of a reason.  What clinical value would it have?  Any finding that wasn't emergent would have to be confirmed by an approved device and any use of it in the ER would be putting you in peril of a lawsuit if something is missed.
Radiology,27wk85,Hypno-phile,1 point,Thu Jun 12 19:15:26 2014 UTC,"Well, the most widespread use of point of care focused ultrasound is in the emergency department. Others mentioned its use in trauma and for assistance with procedures. Some are also finding ways to use it in the quick assessment of shock. In not aware of any increased rate of lawsuits, even in the medico-legally risky setting of the ER.  Nobody (sensible) would suggest that these images are equivalent to a formal ultrasound study. They're not intended to be diagnostic studies, other than making the ""diagnosis"" of ""yes, there's fluid in there."" They are their own thing, and their use is evolving as the technology improves and the cost continues to drop we'll probably see more and more clinical uses for them."
Radiology,27wk85,thebigslide,2,Fri Jun 13 03:25:03 2014 UTC,"I tend to disagree for the time being.  Because it's not an approved device, the first time the results are misinterpreted, or someone doesn't know how to use it and a patient is harmed, there's an incredible liability potential.  And just because someone hasn't exploited that yet publicly doesn't mean it's not a significant risk, it may just mean they're not common enough yet.  It may have come up and been settled out of court since it was such a slam dunk - we'd never hear about that."

Radiology,27wk85,thebigslide,1 point,Thu Jun 12 12:03:42 2014 UTC,"I didn't mean that unit in particular, but it's already a viable business.  More disturbing is the author's answer to the question:      “Why doesn’t everyone have one of these things?”  That is kind of a difficult question. “They’re pretty expensive,” I usually say.   Doctor fucking Oz right there.  What's certainly not indicated, IMHO is a flood of difficult to maintain and operate equipment in the hands of people who barely know how to use it.  As someone below points out, ultrasound techs do receive training in the maintainenance and operation of current equipment and a shocking number of facilities fail to maintain those equipment standards nonetheless."
Radiology,27wk85,thebigslide,0,Thu Jun 12 15:43:35 2014 UTC,"I can't really think of a practical use for a handheld unit that doesn't revolve around ""cool factor,"" though.  The product just screams of abuse and malpractise potential.  Get-your-baby's-ultrasound-image-printed-on-a-t-shirt-at-an-outlet-mall sort of potential.    I'm not pointing a finger at techs regarding maintenance, but operators in general.  In fact, a tech using the equipment every day probably has an advantage.  Operators are the number one cause of degraded equipment performance - mostly physical damage to cables and transducers.  Things get dropped, things get knocked, things get scraped and frayed.  I think it goes without saying that if you use a device a lot, it's going to wear.  It's inevitable.  A housecall-sized unit is subject to significantly harder wear and less frequent use, which makes correct operation more challenging.  That assumes units like this were suitable for diagnostic purposes in the first place.  Which they're not."

This is a non contrast CT performed to look for renal stones (although it really should have been performed prone not supine), and there is a small calculus in the left renal pelvis without obstruction.  The liver is diffusely infiltrated with fat. There is an incidental diverticulum of the second part of the duodenum.  The lucency at the right lesser trochanter is well demarcated without cortical disruption and is benign. (Probably a unicameral cyst, although the differential is wide with these things! I would just say that this looks benign in my report). The femoral head lucencies are not well seen on this old study which suggests they are new, and therefore further investigation is warranted, especially if you are getting pain symptoms.

Radiology,27744a,TardisTechnologist,2,Tue Jun 3 20:45:25 2014 UTC,"I cant site the book exactly, but its something like Minor Emergencies, but it says 1 in 2500 findings on L-spine series have unsuspected findings on patients under the age of 50 and that the 5 view series is the equivalent gonadal dose of getting 2 view chest x-rays every day for 6 years.

Generally with kids though we aim to expose them to as little radiation as possible because their tissues are still developing rapidly and are therefore more sensitive to the dangers of x-rays. Not that you should be worried or anything, the dose for extremities is extremely low anyway, but it's worth note when they're (potentially) exposing every patient more than they need to. Like you said though because of developmental differences it may be important to obtain these views depending what the radiologists are looking for."

Radiology,27744a,steveysaurus,3,Tue Jun 3 20:37:35 2014 UTC,"General x-ray examinations are extremely low in dose and really aren't to be of concern in this case. However, any amount of ionizing radiation (be it from the sun, natural radioactivity in the earth, industrial sources, or x-ray examinations) has a small chance to mutate DNA resulting in cancer or birth defects. This chance is increased in children and particularly foetuses or reproductive cells, since the DNA is rapidly replicating itself. Extremity examinations (limbs, fingers, etc.) are generally the lowest in dose, since we don't need to use much radiation to penetrate that tissue. Chest, abdomen, or spine examinations would have a higher dose. The highest dose examination we perform are CT scans, which can be several hundred times the dose of a regular x-ray. We're exposed to radiation from natural sources all the time, but as technologists dealing with equipment that has the potential to cause harm we are always as careful as possible and aim to minimise radiation exposure to patients, particularly sensitive groups (like children or pregnant women).  As we've both said, you've no need to worry. I only mentioned it because it is drilled into our skulls as the operators of radiation equipment to implement the ALARA principle (As Low As Reasonaly Achievable).  Edit: Here's a nice little infographic on radiation exposure compared to background levels."

Radiology,27744a,fakeMD,9,Tue Jun 3 19:02:42 2014 UTC,"Looks negative.  Pediatric elbows are neat because they haven't fully grown so the bone that looks like a floating pebble is just an unfused epiphyseal plate.  The clinical pearl is to look for a ""sail sign"" or ""fat pad sign"" in image 1 which is absent. That is indicative of bleeding resultant from a fracture. Here's an example of a sail sign  There is a small mark on the right of the humerus on image 4 that is not seen on other images and is likely a nutrient vessel.  She okay?    Edit: Forgot to add that you shouldn't listen to me. I'm not a radiologist, but an amateur radiologist enthusiast."
Radiology,27744a,steveysaurus,3,Tue Jun 3 19:04:40 2014 UTC,"Agree, don't see a fat pad on these images, though the resolution could be hiding something, I guess.  Keep in mind that an anterior (in front of the elbow, as seen in the grandparent post) fat pad can be present even in absence of fracture, but a posterior fat pad (opposite side) is more indicative of occult fracture.  Probably not dislocated.  Everything looks aligned on these x-rays.  Her decreased range of motion is probably due to pain and swelling."
Radiology,27744a,count_zero11,2,Tue Jun 3 15:53:53 2014 UTC,"Ya, if that doc saw a fat pad, it's not impressive. Radiologist over-reads usually happens within 24 hours and they generally only call if it is positive (fractured) and the doc said it wasn't. The mechanism is generally concerning so maybe thats why the doctor called it positive?  It's good to follow up with an orthopedist because even if there wasn't a fat pad on the first visit, the 2nd one would definitely show it."

Radiology,274llf,Milesman1971,5,Tue Jun 3 02:54:50 2014 UTC,"A bipartite patella is commonly unilateral, but the synchondrosis (the tissue connecting the two unfused pieces of the patella) can be disrupted due to trauma, resulting in pain and point tenderness that mimics fracture. It's not really an important distinction, because your symptoms should improve with conservative management in either case. I hope you feel better!"

Radiology,274llf,Milesman1971,5,Tue Jun 3 01:42:19 2014 UTC,"Thank you for supplying the AP view. I can see your patella just fine. This is almost certainly a bipartite patella. The radiographic findings (superolateral, curvilinear, well-corticated defect without associated soft tissue swelling), along with the physical exam findings and clinical history, suggest an injury to the synchondrosis. It sounds like you received quality care from the appropriate physician, and I'm sure you'll be good as new with conservative management. As I said, the distinction is really an academic one, as the treatment is the same."
Radiology,274llf,TardisTechnologist,3,Tue Jun 3 02:20:33 2014 UTC,"There actually is swelling/fluid on my knee that the doctor noted, which though I didn't mention it, was another reason he thought it was a fracture.  Also, the injury is 2+ weeks old, which and the swelling has come down a lot from what it was originally.  I just want to say, I'm not trying to disagree just to be confrontational, I just want to make sure you have the facts!"
Radiology,274llf,MinkyBear,3,Tue Jun 3 02:56:33 2014 UTC,"No worries! Radiographically, there's no swelling, and I would interpret this as a bipartite patella. Fluid in your knee (presumably a suprapatellar effusion) is a nonspecific finding and doesn't really support or mitigate against fracture. I think it's an interesting case for radiologists and residents/fellows, because these two entities are so frequently confused. In terms of your clinical situation and management, I think you are in good hands."
Radiology,274llf,ondavid,3,Tue Jun 3 03:15:50 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation!  Assuming it is a bipartite patella, do you think this means I'll be able to get back to running/biking sooner rather than later?

""Trust Me, I’m a Radiologist Blog | May 30, 2014 | Practice Management, Abdominal Imaging, CT, Contrast Agents By Laurence Spitzer, MD  I have to admit it. Sometimes it blows my mind that some of my colleagues in other fields of medicine still believe that radiologists are not “real” doctors. I truly believe that the prehistoric vision of the radiologist sitting in a dark room reading a few chest X-rays, a couple CTs and a smattering of ultrasounds, and out the door and home by 3:30 pm, still stands. In our world, we all know that this is the farthest thing from the truth. The majority of us would agree that we are working harder now, reading more cases and being asked to do more with less, than in previous years. Even though we hear that volumes are down, it doesn’t seem that way to me. Our colleagues in the ED, the intensivists in the ICU, the hospitalists on the floors and the primary care docs and specialists in the outpatient world seem to be ordering more and more studies.  That brings me to the point of my story.  Why don’t people trust us?  Let me preface the following story by saying that this account actually happened, and that there has been no embellishment for the sake of entertainment or to provide humor. I kid you not.  The other day at work, while assigned to the CT rotation, one of the CT techs called to tell me that one of our referring surgeons had sent in a patient of his for a CT of the abdomen and pelvis, with IV contrast. The patient had a complicated history of multiple prior surgeries for bowel obstructions, and reportedly had prior CTs done at outside institutions for such.The doctor’s request stated, “abdominal pain; evaluate for bowel obstruction.” As per protocol, when the technologist queried the patient as part of our department’s routine screening, the patient told the technologist that after a previous CT scan with contrast, she developed hives, chest pain and tongue swelling that required her to be admitted to the hospital.  When the technologist relayed this story to me, it was a no-brainer. Any patient having a previous reaction to IV contrast predisposes that patient to another reaction. We would do the study without contrast, as having IV contrast is not essential to diagnose a bowel obstruction, and certainly, the risks of a serious contrast reaction carries more weight than anything we would not be able to diagnose on the study.  I instructed the technologist to notify the patient and the surgeon of this, and assumed that the issue had been put to rest. Much to my surprise a few minutes later, the technologist called me back to tell me that the surgeon wished to speak to me. Huh? Mind you, I know this doctor fairly well, and he has a decent reputation. I do not have nor have had any conflict with him in the past. He proceeded to tell me that despite the patient’s history of having a legitimate contrast reaction in the past, he wanted the study to be done with contrast, and when I asked him why, his response was, “there is a better chance of seeing a bowel obstruction with contrast.” Hmmm. Had to think about that one for a minute. After about three seconds of thought, I asked him, “Just out of curiosity, where did you come up with that idea?” To which he replied, “It’s a known fact, and it’s what I was taught in my surgical training. I will assume the risk and I discussed this risk in detail with my patient.” Wow. Must have been some surgical residency program. Not going to argue with that logic. Then to cover my behind, I figured I needed to talk to the patient and inform her that despite what her surgeon has told her, it goes against what I am telling her to do as a radiologist, and it also goes against what my training has taught me. I told the patient in clear language that what she was about to do was against my advice, and that I would not assume any responsibility for her actions. She understood all of this, and I made sure to document such (in 10 ft letters!) all over her chart. I relinquished control, and was resigned to do the study, as ordered. Planning ahead, I alerted our dept. nurse of the impending CT and its potential consequences.  No sooner than about three minutes after the scan was performed, I was called into the scanner because the patient developed hives all over her neck and torso, and told me that her tongue was feeling puffy. Her face was flushed, and she became tachycardic. Gee, you think it’s a contrast reaction? While these symptoms were running their course and I was resuscitating her with IV fluids, supplemental O2, IV Benadryl and soothing words of comfort, etc. She had the audacity to ask me, “Why was this happening to me?” Hmmm let me think about that for a minute.  Luckily, the patient’s symptoms subsided after about one hour, and she was back to her baseline. When she was feeling better, I again attempted to advise her that what she had just experienced was clearly a reaction to IV contrast and that she should be aware of this for the future if she is to require subsequent CT exams. The consequences could easily have been worse and even result in death.  What was her response? “Thank you for your help. I should have trusted you, but now all of this has made me late for my next doctor appointment.”"

I'm interested in the 'dent' in the spinal cord area in these 2 pics. http://visualrealtime.net/Stenosis.jpg http://visualrealtime.net/Stenosis2.jpg  Is that a disc pushing on my cord, if not stenosis, why not?  Diagnosis   There is normal thoracic alignment. There is subtle anterior wedging of the mid to lower thoracic vertebral bodies from the T6-T11 with mild associated increased kyphotic angulation and mild irregularity of the endplates suspicious for Schueuermann's disease. The thoracic cord is normal in size and signal. The paraspinous soft tissues are unremarkable. Degenerative disc and facet disease throughout the thoracic spine result in multilevel neuroforaminal stenosis with is most pronounced of mild to moderate degree bilaterally at T8-T9. Scattered small disc protrusions are noted without significant central spinal stenosis.   Findings suspicious for Schueurmann's disease with vertebral body wedging, mild kyphosis and irregularity of the endplates. Multilevel degenerative neural foraminal stenosis which is most pronounced of mild to moderate degree bilaterally at T8-T9.     Thanks for looking. I was told I could have spinal stenosis before my MRI, because of how I can lean on shopping carts, bike or use my walking stick with little to no pain. Otherwise walking is very painful after a mile. Diagnosis says no spinal stenosis, but then I saw that bump...I understand I should trust the initial mri diagnosis, but I'm just curious to what I'm seeing."

One day one of the fellows and one of the residents were reading out the CT cases for the day. They had a question about one case and called over the staff radiologist - who was a very young, very attractive woman  who liked to wear short short skirts and tight low cuts tops. This woman bent down to look at the CT films in such a way that bum and boobs were on full display at the eye level of the fellow and resident. After answering their question she left the room. The resident and fellow then proceeded to spend the next minutes going on and on and on about her glorious body habitus... while the dictation machine was on. Of course the transcriptionists transcribed the entire conversation and then called me over to read it. Of course I posted the transcription everywhere. Neither the fellow or resident lived that down for ages but the staff radiologist did lengthen her skirts and button her shirts higher after."

Basically, the neural plate starts out flat, then folds back and meets in the midline, fusing around the new neural tube.  Bifid spinal processes, as well as spina bifida is caused by a fusion defect--the two halves of the neural fold just didnt come all the way together, so there's a gap.    There's no ""evolutionary advantage"" to this--and you'll find that it is futile to try to ascribe evolutionary fitness to every feature or trait.

Radiology,26o0iq,count_zero11,0,Wed May 28 20:15:43 2014 UTC,and what makes you say that Chiropractic doesn't work? what are you basing this on?

Radiology,26o0iq,vnarsenal,0,Thu May 29 05:12:49 2014 UTC,"low back pain is more complicated, I agree with you that the data is more mixed on this particular topic, however chiropractors adjust way more than the lumbar region, we adjust extremities, the cervical area, thoracic, and so on. This is only looking at low back.   many sports teams have chiropractors on staff, I do not think that the owners of these teams would have chiropractors working on what amounts to millions of dollars of investment into players if chiropractic was either dangerous or ineffective.  if you want to tell me that more MDs are not referring patients do chiropractors that flies in the face of reality. before going to chiropractic school I worked in a large teaching hospital doing research and I saw MDs do this with my own eyes.  I will also send you some articles that backup some of the things I'm telling you. if you want to sit there and tell me that the data for low back surgery has better outcomes and higher patient satisfaction ratings this also flies in the face of reality. and you might make fun of me for saying this but chiropractic is not only effective for humans but for animals too. I have known people whose vet told them that their only option was to put down their dog, horse or other animal, and yet some of these animals made close to full recovery from chiropractic. Again that might be funny to you but for some people like ranchers this is their livelihood. despite a smear campaign from the AMA from about the 1920s to 1970s Chiropractic is still around for a reason, it works. Like anything else it does not work 100 percent of the time, but I know it's helped a lot of people. I was in the process of applying to medical school myself when I injured my back and under the recommendation of an MD I was working for went to see his chiropractor. Long story short I change courses and Here I am. I would not be going into this profession if I had not done my research and did not truly believe that it works. sorry for the random changes in capitalization, my voice to text does that sometimes and forgive me for being too lazy to go back and correct all of them."

The novella has been widely translated, with English versions titled Candide: or, All for the Best (1759); Candide: or, The Optimist (1762); and Candide: or, Optimism (1947).  It begins with a young man, Candide, who is living a sheltered life in an Edenic paradise and being indoctrinated with Leibnizian optimism (or simply Optimism) by his mentor, Pangloss.  The work describes the abrupt cessation of this lifestyle, followed by Candide's slow, painful disillusionment as he witnesses and experiences great hardships in the world. Voltaire concludes with Candide, if not rejecting optimism outright, advocating a deeply practical precept, ""we must cultivate our garden"", in lieu of the Leibnizian mantra of Pangloss, ""all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds"".

Doctor laughed it off and adviced to buy some painkillers. One more month the patient will be back in the patients homecountry to get a second opinion from a real doctor.

A little more information:  January last year is when she had the operation to remove a primary right long lobe solid carinoma.  The biopsy revealed it rated a 4? I believe on the aggressiveness of the tumor.  They biopsied the lymphnodes in the area and it had spread.  She was on Palladia for chemo for about 6 months, but it was adversely affecting her quality of life, so after much deliberation we took her off.  We've made the conscience, if hard, decision just to let her live out the rest of her natural life.  Fast forward a year later she's had maybe two episodes during the night where she's having breathing fits for a couple minutes each.  They gave her up to a year to live after the initial surgery, and she's lived a year and a half without any issues.  She regularly runs 4 miles with me so up to this point she's been in great shape.  So I brought her in for the x-rays.  We really just want to know what to expect for end of life symptoms, and the best way to manage them, pain medication etc.  The Dr thought it might be pushing on her heart, and making her lung heavy.  He said if she was struggling for oxygen then all of her cells would be impacted, and it would be very uncomfortable.  All of her routine tests were normal, so he said it really depends on the individual patient.  She seems fine.  Any advice on the right time to let her go?  She's an amazing dog, and we've had a lot of good times and memories together."

Thank you for taking the time to read our guidelines and providing us with as much info as possible. I would be glad to answer some doubts:  The 5mm area mentioned in both reports can be seen here. This is a key image taken within MedXT that has now been added to the exam for later viewing. It was taken from series #6 in your follow up scan. This abnormality is also visible in your original MRI, however not all sequences show it well.  I will leave the part on what features, enhancement, etc leads to the impression of a demyelinating disease to those with proper training. However, I can elaborate on what is a demyelinating disease. Demyelination refers to the myelin sheath found in neurons, which is usually throughout the axonal portion of the neuron. Think of this sheath as insulation, and a way to optimally transmit electrical impulses through the nervous system. As demyelination occurs, electrical impulses become slower, erratic, and the patient begins to show signs such as deficiency in sensation, movement, cognition, etc."
Radiology,265cqd,meatyanddelicious,2,Wed May 21 21:08:35 2014 UTC,Thank you so much for taking the time to actually circle the area in question. The key image function (and really everything about MedXT) is so cool!  That is a great and concise definition of demyelination.
Radiology,265cqd,bretticusmaximus,5,Thu May 22 00:18:18 2014 UTC,"Where did you find this? The white matter lesion is right temporal, not parietal.. very likely ischemic. Low-grade glioma definitely would not enter my mind looking at these images. Plus there's a hemorrhagic pituitary adenoma, and quite likely an aneurysm at M1-M2 on the left. The acquisitions leave a lot to be desired... A nice coronal FLAIR through the AH complex would be very useful, not to mention a decent native T1, etc. There a number of things that cannot be excluded and the interpretation seems quite questionable."
Radiology,265cqd,meatyanddelicious,5,Wed May 21 21:34:00 2014 UTC,"Look at the thin cut post contrast coronals. I think that aneurysm may be summation on the T2s.  At my institution we also do not routinely call small T2 hyperintensities ischemic in patients less than 50 y/o, though we list it on the differential, as it still could be. Low grade glioma would definitely not be on it though."

We have studies that collect info about the total dose of radiation used, but is scatter radiation studied or even a cause for real concern?  For instance, what are the chances that a lower back x-ray might harm something outside of the capture area (like the thyroid)?  How about normal CT scans? Could a standard 6 mSv chest CT significantly expose areas that aren't captured during the study at all?  How about other scans such as ~1 mSv High Res. CTs of the chest like in this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWmAa9YCYDs. Is the area in between the cuts at significant risk?  edited to add video link for reference"
Radiology,261k21,TardisTechnologist,1 point,Tue May 20 16:52:41 2014 UTC,"You have to think too about the path of the photon. Lower back xrays would have to either traverse the entire body with being absorbed or rescattered OR, hit some other scattering object in the room. It would be interesting to have an ion chamber at every lumbar patients thyroid for a few weeks and record the results, but would it be enough to ever worry about? Unlikely.   Look up radiation hormesis. Says that a little extra radiation might actually end up having beneficial effects. The people in the world that have the highest naturally occurring background radiation are actually some of the world's healthiest. Scandinavian people's, if memory serves."
Radiology,261k21,emptygroove,1 point,Wed May 21 00:26:57 2014 UTC,"The theory of radiation hormesis seems to have little research evidence and really doesn't have any solid theoretical basis either. That said, I agree that the dose is generally minuscule. ALARA will always be important but as long as both risk and benefit are considered when ordering an exam I wouldn't be too concerned.  When talking specifically about scattered radiation affecting areas outside of the collimation... Well, scattered photons are likely to interact multiple times within the patient once they have scattered, (less energy=higher chance of attenuation) so I'd say that considering the area outside of the primary beam IS important when measuring dose, as this little study emphasized."
Radiology,261k21,NateNizzle,1 point,Fri May 30 22:03:42 2014 UTC,"http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=radiation+hormesis&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C22&as_sdtp=  There are a fair few scientists who would disagree that it has no merit.  There have also been studies that show that shielding outside the primary beam in CT could possibly increase patient dose because photons that would have scattered away from the patient would insteract with the shield and scatter back. With CT operating at high KVs, lead is not as effective as in plain film radiography that operate at kVs in the 50-90 range.  My advice to you would be to to pick the brain of a physicist at your practical site if you can. My standpoint after conferring with a fair few is if a patient feels safer with shielding, we offer it but its akin to purchasing a new widescreen TV and offering a 13 cent discount.   from what I am seeing in the linked study they are looking at scatter produced by an AP upright CXR and areas that might have the highest level of scatter. Unsurprisingly, they confirmed what is in most entry level texts. Standing at a 45 degree angle to the scattering object puts you in the safest place and once you are 12 feet away, your exposure is negligible even if it does produce a mottle image on a high speed cassette. (Forgive me, ive been full time CT for quite a few years now. IS anyone routinely using 1200 speed? The standard before was 400 for body, 150 for extremity)  I appreciate the enthusiasm and their method was quite good but they werent breaking any new ground and while they proved that further research is possible, I doubt anyone would fund it as even if what they are saying is taken to the Nth degree, its still that 13 cent savings."
Radiology,261k21,Dantonn,3,Sat May 31 00:35:20 2014 UTC,"In xray school our physics instructor shot a phantom with at around 80kv and 20mAs and placed the measurement device( forget what it's called) about 2-3 feet from the direct beam, it didn't register any real dose, at least one that was strong enough to penetrate skin.   It was a while ago so I may be misremembering things, though."
Radiology,261k21,peedzllab,1 point,Wed May 21 00:45:03 2014 UTC,"Now if I may ask, what does the mAs value represent?  Is it the speed or intensity of the radiation?  If comparing two options of the same type of scan, when would 300mAs be used vs. 100mAs?  Does it have to do with the subject's weight?  Also do you know if higher mAs correlates to higher radiation dosage?"
Radiology,261k21,Dantonn,4,Wed May 21 04:15:06 2014 UTC,"mAs directly represents total number of electrons pushed to the anode to generate the beam, and is therefore related to radiation intensity (more electrons -> more interactions with the anode -> more x-rays produced). A larger body part will require a higher mAs (at a given voltage).  Beam speed, as for all light, is c."
Radiology,261k21,peedzllab,2,Wed May 21 04:43:42 2014 UTC,"My instructors do a terrible job explaining when to adjust Kv and mAs. I understand thickness and such, and a wrist and a chest will have two different techniques. Say you have a larger than average pt with a CxR I always see them bump up the mAs, but never really the Kv. Do you think you could explain some of that to me? When is it necessary to increase Kv? It would be the biggest favor right now!"
Radiology,261k21,Dantonn,1 point,Mon May 26 19:46:32 2014 UTC,"kVp ranges tend to be set to allow you to easily distinguish relevant structures/tissues/etc. in that particular area. If you move it too far out of range,you generally won't be able to make out what you're looking for. That said, there's nothing wrong with changing it slightly depending on your patient (for instance, a shoulder exam on a hockey player versus an elderly lady), but even then you don't want to go too far. Sometimes you need to to get any sort of image at all (oblique ribs on larger patients can be a problem), but large changes in kVp are definitely a later resort.  mAs tends to give you a lot more leeway, especially with digital systems."
Radiology,261k21,TardisTechnologist,1 point,Mon May 26 20:48:32 2014 UTC,"Ahh I see. That sort of makes sense to me. Would you happen to know of a way to try and remember general technique ranges? Maybe I am searching wrong, but I tend to have trouble remembering what to set for a portable. The CI's I work with tell me it comes with time, and I am only in my third quarter of school so I guess I shouldnt be too hard on myself about it yet."
Radiology,261k21,peedzllab,1 point,Tue May 27 00:05:04 2014 UTC,"Honestly, the best way to learn it is to do it (and it will come with time and experience). One thing that I know worked for some people was thinking it through from an extremity going proximally, and keeping in mind that kvp generally goes up with each different body part (hand/wrist needs more kv than a finger, etc.). I think we had a sort of sketch of a person with kV ranges on it on a pocket notebook thing; might help to do a stick figure or something like that of your own, especially if you're more of a visual learner. Pay attention to what your console presets are when you're not doing a portable, as well as what the AEC actually ended up putting out. You pick it up both slower and faster than you'd expect.  Depending on what tech's supervising you, you can always try to throw in a sly ""Hmm... 60 at 4?"" or something. I did that a lot if I hadn't done a particular view in a while."
Radiology,261k21,NJTrash,1 point,Tue May 27 01:05:47 2014 UTC,"It has a lot to do with scatter. At higher kV, compton attenuation is increased, and photoelectric attenuation is decreased. This means that high kV will give you more ""penetrating power"" but a more grey-looking image. When you want to see structures which are low in physical density (lungs) this is desirable, which is why you would do a chest at 120kV.  As an example from clinical, the default technique on our machine for an HRL hip on a large patient was 64mAs at 80kV. Since this patient was particularly large, the tech I was with decided to bump up the kV to 90 or so, which was a mistake. The image came out completely grey and ugly. The tech wanted to go up AGAIN in kV but I suggested keeping the kV at 80 and increasing the mAs and it came out beautiful :)  Generally with CR/DR the processing algorithms can compensate well for incorrect exposure factor selection, but severe underexposure, scatter, etc. cannot really be compensated for."

Hopefully in that process they will also find some information and possibly the answer to their initial inquiry.  Regarding your question, a diagnostic rad tech's first step is usually to branch out into modalities; CT, MRI, Interventional, etc. If that isn't appealing to them or they have already x-trained, they may also choose to go administrative, educational, or even to mid-level provider.   Administrative: progressively earn more responsibility in admin duties of the department. Progressing to lead tech, supervisor, even all the way to director. In my experience, this requires at least a Bachelor's degree in either health services or administration. Educational: return to your academic roots and use your experience and working knowledge of the field to teach those who are interested and want to follow the path of radiologic technology. This usually requires some teaching certification or training by the academic institution. Mid-level provider: the ultimate clinical path for a technologist would be to train as a Radiologist Assistant. These individuals go through yet another program to further specialize in fluoroscopic, interventional, and diagnostic interpretation of images under the supervision of a radiologist.

Radiology,25uzdr,desertyeti29,2,Sun May 18 15:43:15 2014 UTC,hey thanks for the reply!   I guess you're right though. sometimes we don't really consider about how MR is still a rather new discovery and the unknown effect it may be causing. although that's one of the things that draw me to it.
Radiology,25uzdr,Dantonn,3,Sun May 18 22:14:16 2014 UTC,"I would look into the job market in the country you are considering moving to. The number of ct/MRI scanners varies greatly between countries. If you are planning on residing in the US, have you considered Intervetional/Angio?"
Radiology,25uzdr,dianarchy,1 point,Sun May 18 14:42:37 2014 UTC,that is admittedly one of my big concerns as I might have to go to rural areas to find jobs if I'm unable to find jobs in the city and the smaller area most probably do not have as many MR machines judging by the costs. so that would be a disadvantage if I picked MR.   interventional would most likely be out for me as my country largely prefer men over women for it.

Greatly appreciated!  p.s. Although i know of course, your career should be what you're interested in and should not be based on a demand in time for this particular modality at a particular country. My current top choice is either CT/MRI.

Plus, you have a lower work load (long scan times), which is nice."

At 11 pm. in the ER where I work the radiologist is on call, and while emergency CT can be ordered an MRI will always mean second or third day.  A CT in such a case can mean the difference between a high cast around and admittance to the hospital for surgery either during the shift or the following day, so in these cases the radiologist will come in / evaluate the image.  Non acute injuries such as ACL/Meniscus will be assessed at a later point, meaning that if either the fracture type or clinical symptoms point towards these kinds of injuries a later MRI will be performed."

Radiology,25oom4,CommissarAJ,10,Fri May 16 04:21:53 2014 UTC,"This is why I X-Table my lateral knees 95% of the time. At the hospital I work at, more than 75% of the patients that I see are overweight and there's no way in hell they're going to get their knee in a perfect lateral. Our radiologists are actually pretty tolerant regarding some of the images that get sent through, I get shocked at some of the images that are dictated and accepted by some of my coworkers. The majority of our radiologists wouldn't bother to call for a repeat if they saw that lateral sent through. There's maybe 2 or 3 that come to mind that would question the tech regarding the image but it's unlikely that they would ask for a repeat. I take pride in my work so I definitely hate sending images that are suboptimal but sometimes you have no choice when the patient is combative and/or in an altered mental state. You get what you can and then send them back to the ER to await further instructions. A lesson I learned very early on in my career is to ALWAYS DOCUMENT the reason as to why you can't get a good image, be it the patient's condition, equipment failure, etc. I had one incident that came back to bite me in the ass in which the patient was non-compliant and I didn't think to make a note to the rad as to why the study was not 100% diagnostic, it resulted in the only write-up I've ever had since I started working as a tech, something where just a little documentation would have covered me."
Radiology,25oom4,derwreck,3,Fri May 16 08:18:29 2014 UTC,"Completely agree with you on both counts; specifically in the lateral knees. By the time I ask the patient to position their knee and turn their body to help with positioning, I would've already turned their bed sideways and stuck an IP between their knees. Just saves time."

Radiology,25oom4,CommissarAJ,3,Fri May 16 07:12:20 2014 UTC,"Tip for lateral elbows - elbow bent 90° with thumb pointing to ceiling (if possible - usually not), shoulder and elbow at same height (annoying, I know), make a fist with non-affected hand and place it palm down under affected wrist, so affected wrist is about 5cm (2"") away from IR. Hand towards/away from IR controls radial head-coranoid process overlap (radial head follows thumb) and elbow-shoulder in same plane superimposes humeral condyles. I used to hate lateral elbows, but now I can get a beautiful joint space the vast majority of the time by sticking to this positioning or angling my IR/beam to mimic it."
Radiology,25oom4,Zydekko,2,Fri May 16 23:48:08 2014 UTC,"While great advice, my problem with lateral elbows is because I work at a trauma centre, so 90% of my elbow patients can barely move their arm and a solid half of them are stuck in a supine position."

Radiology,25oom4,robertlatka,3,Fri May 16 05:04:37 2014 UTC,"Under - 9 times out of 10, an incorrect lateral knee will be under-rotated. Adductor tubercle on the medial epicondyle and/or the fibula head/tibia are the two easiest ways to assess the direction of the rotation."

I guess maybe this only effects erasure, since there's no geometric distortion during image reading.  You'll notice the lines are parallel to the edge of the casette that opens up, so, on the long axis of an 18x24 and on the short axis of 24x30, etc.  At least that was our problem, I don't know why the lines are prominent at the bottom of your pic and not at the top.

Radiology,259qx1,Taubin,3,Sun May 11 12:19:22 2014 UTC,"I'm just here for the pretty pictures, can someone please explain to me what AP means?"
Radiology,259qx1,Dantonn,10,Mon May 12 05:24:02 2014 UTC,"Imagine a person standing up with their arms by their sides, palms facing forwards. In this baseline position, the 'front' aspect is defined as anterior and the 'back' is posterior. An AP (antero-posterior) image means the beam entered through the anterior aspect of a body part and exited through the posterior, then hit the film/plate/whatever.  Place your arm on a table so that the palm is facing up, and that's pretty much how most AP forearm images are taken (beam coming down from above, plate beneath the forearm). The image in the OP is pretty much a lateral shot (ie from the side). Presumably the AP marker's on there because the tech had no idea what the orientation actually was, or possibly it's a bigger marker block that has both ""AP"" and ""TRAUMA"" or something underneath it (you can see the edge of what looks like more letters cut off at the bottom of the image)."
Radiology,259qx1,Taubin,3,Mon May 12 06:13:37 2014 UTC,"That's a really good explanation, thank you very much!"

Radiology,259qx1,intervenroentgen,9,Sun May 11 19:44:07 2014 UTC,Is it that bad over there?
Radiology,259qx1,Incubus1981,10,Sun May 11 19:58:55 2014 UTC,"I really don't place the blame on the radiologists in the U. S. The ""hedging"" and avoidance to provide definite diagnosis in their reports comes from a health system and patients that lash out against their own providers. Granted, patients should expect a certain level of professional service, but it seems that often that expectation is of pure ""perfection."" Often one complication, divergence in treatment plan, or plain misunderstanding is enough to tarnish a career."
Radiology,259qx1,IAmPigMan,6,Sun May 11 20:40:16 2014 UTC,"Sounds scary! We have no issue giving an opinion, mainly because the culture here is that we are just doing our best and no-ones perfect. If we get it wrong, well, we learn and move on. (Plus the patients aren't paying anything, so there's less of a consumer feeling about medicine)"
Radiology,259qx1,Dantonn,8,Sun May 11 20:43:36 2014 UTC,"Exactly. That's my same view on how the ideal health delivery system should work. However, the U. S. continues to commercialize a large portion of the health sector and its operations. It personally bothers me how much we are focusing on ""satisfaction"" and insuring the patient leaves ""happy;"" sometimes regardless of whether this means properly treated. /rant"
Radiology,259qx1,CommissarAJ,5,Sun May 11 20:51:34 2014 UTC,"Well, our system isn't ideal either. There's a lack of funding, and a huge reliance on good will. Lots of doctors and nurses are leaving simply because the pay isn't commensurate with experience and responsibility. We haven't had a pay rise in 8 years while inflation keeps going up, and our pensions keep getting reduced. Those of us still in here do it because we love it, but there is an undercurrent of dissatisfaction, and it won't be long before the capitalist markets take over.  That said, I do appreciate extra income from private work outside the NHS. Though it is far less clinical - just telereporting."

Radiology,24xukb,AnotherRadiologist,4,Wed May 7 09:43:37 2014 UTC,"You have to remember, ED docs are lazy (source: ED doc).  He probably ordered the ""package"" that was available.  Depending on the institution's protocol for ""ingested FB series"" this could mean any number of different combinations of films that the radiologists developed.  At the last place I worked, we got a ""nose to rectum"" series which was 1-2 AP images, depending on the size of the child.  At my current institution, our ""FB series"" consists of 1 view chest and abdomen (two pictures total).  Any FB series probably needs to include a 1 view chest to rule out esophageal FB, as this is one thing that requires intervention.  If the ED doc didn't know better and just ordered ""acute abdomen series"" (or if a dedicated FB series wasn't available) this might get you these 3 images--1 view chest and supine/upright abdomen.  I'm guessing that's what happened here.  The technologist might call the ED doc to let him know if there was a dedicated FB series which would have involved less radiation.  Rads techs call me all the time to tell me what I've messed up when ordering tests (hooray for electronic ordering), and I am grateful for the back up double check.  On another note, the one time a lateral image is required is if you have an esophageal FB, i.e., to rule out multiple stacked coins or the characteristic profile shape of a button battery, either of which may not be obvious on AP films alone."
Radiology,24xukb,count_zero11,6,Wed May 7 23:44:05 2014 UTC,Were three views entirely necessary?
Radiology,24xukb,intervenroentgen,15,Wed May 7 09:59:34 2014 UTC,"Indication was foreign body ingestion, and it was done as an abdominal series, which includes an upright chest, upright abdomen, and supine abdomen.    They didn't know where it was, only that he'd swallowed something.   I'd say they were necessary."
Radiology,24xukb,intervenroentgen,7,Wed May 7 10:08:43 2014 UTC,"Ok thanks. It's interesting to see how different departments deal with things. I would have stopped after the first image as you can see the object, you know there's no perf and there's no oesophageal obstruction."
Radiology,24xukb,intervenroentgen,5,Wed May 7 10:15:04 2014 UTC,Same thing here. We start with abdomen 1vw then go to chest if necessary.
Radiology,24xukb,qee,9,Wed May 7 10:45:31 2014 UTC,That'd be fine if techs had the autonomy and liability to make decisions like that.   Our volume is too high to triage every exam.
Radiology,24xukb,mamacat49,2,Wed May 7 13:43:26 2014 UTC,We don't. The ED doctors do.  EDIT: in the case the FB is not in the kub we usually call the ped ED MD and ask if they want us to do a chest. If the MD is one we know well and there is a great mutual trust then we'll go ahead and do the chest and he/she will put the order in after.
Radiology,24xukb,intervenroentgen,6,Wed May 7 21:26:53 2014 UTC,"Most of stuff like this comes through our ED where a mid-level provider triages things that go to ""fast track"" by doing a brief intake, ordering labs and whatever imaging they deem appropriate. I often call with critical findings to a staff or resident and get met with the response, ""yeah, but I haven't seen that patient yet.""  Like I said elsewhere. Our healthcare system has plenty of problems."
Radiology,24xukb,intervenroentgen,3,Wed May 7 22:08:24 2014 UTC,Agreed.
Radiology,24xukb,intervenroentgen,-4,Wed May 7 22:13:15 2014 UTC,You need better techs
Radiology,24xukb,qee,12,Wed May 7 18:10:16 2014 UTC,"No, that's not it. The techs need more autonomy. The techs are the ones that want to do the right thing, ie. less radiation. The doctors (or the nurse ordering for the doctor), not so much. We are viewed as ""trying to get out of"" the exam."
Radiology,24xukb,zirdante,7,Wed May 7 18:45:41 2014 UTC,"Nail on head. You aren't ""trying to get off"" doing something, you're trying to do your job the best you can while reducing radiation and providing clinically relevant imaging at the same time. Sometimes that means not doing any imaging."
Radiology,24xukb,Player_B,5,Wed May 7 21:33:06 2014 UTC,The way I've always looked at it is this: we are the experts on imaging. The MD's are the expert on the pt and diagnosing. Sometimes we have to discuss the validity of an exam to stay on the same page.
Radiology,24xukb,Lucasvh,3,Wed May 7 22:26:19 2014 UTC,Totally agree. I'm having a discussion over at /r/medicine with several non-rads who sadly don't see this distinction (even saying we aren't clinicians).

Radiology,24y4h1,Niteslacker,1 point,Wed May 7 21:47:50 2014 UTC,"I cant' say for sure that this is the case, but I used to work for a facility that employed this type of reformat for CTPA protocol. We basically created an oblique reformat that covered each side of the chest in a fan pattern. We would scroll down to the slice containing the pulmonary artery bifurcation, and position two 180 degree fan grids on either side of the chest. The idea was to capture the branches of the RT and LT pulm. arteries in a variety of angles in order to visualize thrombus. However, these were in addition to the usual coronal and sagittal views."
Radiology,24y4h1,shadowa4,2,Wed May 7 23:47:59 2014 UTC,"Yes, all of this.  We do those at all of the facilities I've worked at, in addition to the standard views.  I do them in MIP mode though."

Update though, took her to ENT today who found two golf ball sized masses in neck.  This scan covered from around diaphragm up to the ear per the ordering physician.  Shouldn't they have seen these?  I even felt them, they are hard as well.  The issue with air, now seems likely to be lymphatic fluid.  Would that not show up? She looked like she was going to explode.    Next step is neck CT and blood work.  White count has been around 25k.  Then determine infection without fever or leukemia.  I'm sure there are others in between but those seem to be the most likely causes based off symptoms."

Radiology,24y4h1,mjbat7,1 point,Thu May 8 05:33:56 2014 UTC,"About to go get one now. Did you see anything?  This is  getting really weird.  We now KNOW there is air, the two lumps in neck are gone and the doctor felt them too.  They were perfectly round and hard.  She swears she felt them go down her Esophagus into her abdomen but they think she's crazy.  But they thought she was with the air too.  Which we are about to prove.    She's filling up with air again.  Something is going on with air in abdominal cavity.  But she's getting subcutaneous Emphysema of the neck and face.  We now know where that is coming from.  The Between the clavicle and right shoulder a space swelled up and looked like a hernia.  All of a sudden she felt off and noticed her neck, chest, and shoulders seemed to be drooping.  Hours later she heard a pop when she used her right arm and the air started.  Along with blurry vision, BP drops, heart rate increases, and she feels really weird.   If you press that area that looks herniated it stops.  Obviously she can't press it forever.  We have some sort of band draped across her holding it down for now.  I don't know the terms for those areas but the air from her chest is getting into her skin there.  If we take the pressure off she feels air going into her right arm and the skin visibly swells.  Her neck and face were slim after the initial feeling where everything dropped.  Now it's all swelled up again.  She said the front of her neck feels odd like it's not protected at all and her head is heavy."

Radiology,24y4h1,mjbat7,1 point,Fri May 9 04:11:52 2014 UTC,"Right now there is NOT a diagnosis at all. If you see anything at all that might help patient please share.  CT was considered 100% normal.  Patient does have parent with a genetic deficiency which can cause emphysema (Alpha 1) but has not been tested/diagnosed.   Patient has been seen 3 times in ER recently for symptoms of air/gas in cavities. Upon exam there are multiple signs of pneumothorax but abdominal CT normal.  Patient has pain in diaphragm area (primarily on her left side), chest (from neck to between breasts), and from diaphragm to an inch or so above umbilicus. Same areas visibly distended or swollen including face.  The trachea, larynx, esophagus, thyroid, optic nerves, cranial nerves, facial nerves, heart and lungs all seem to be affected at varying times.

Radiology,24y4h1,mjbat7,3,Wed May 7 12:53:10 2014 UTC,I'm guessing the patient is you? What exactly do you mean by symptoms of air/gas in cavities? That's not a recognised clinical term.  The chest is normal apart from a small right anterior pleural bulla. No pneumothorax.
Radiology,24y4h1,mjbat7,1 point,Wed May 7 13:07:43 2014 UTC,"No, patient is a friend.  She physically looks blown up with air and is in a great deal of pain.  At the time of this scan, the pressure was above the range of the CT.  One nurse mentioned subcutaneous emphysema but,there would have to be a tear somewhere.  Now that you mention the bulla, I have read that they can burst leaving air in the cavity. Something is going on as it's visible.  Maybe it's mainly in the skin. There would still have to be some sort of respiratory ""leak"".  Thanks by the way, they didn't even mention the bulla.  Can you tell me the size? Her right?  ETA-  Sorry, symptoms of gas or air : She said it feels like the pains she had after having her gallbladder removed laparoscopically.  The upper abdomen is distended but seems separated from the lower abdomen or chest.  It feels like three areas.  Pain at diaphragm which she says feels like muscles tearing.  The distention is air or gas and will move between upper body and upper abdomen.  No excessive gas.  The neck and face will balloon up and she feels like she is choking. The trachea has shifted at one point.   When the pressure is intense, nerves are involved.  Facial, optical, cranial, and the nerves in upper chest and shoulder.  The skin feels very odd and thick and sometimes she hears crackling or air bubbles when you press it. Also claims to hear air bubbles or squirting noises constantly.  When the neck swells and the pressure starts, she can feel a vein or artery in her neck start ""beating hard"". Heart rate goes up to 150.  Her face and neck turn beet red and she starts sweating.  Honestly, she looks miserable and you can see or feel most of the symptoms.  Her family is terrified because no one can find anything. They just keep sending her home with Valium to relax."
Radiology,24y4h1,Tintinikongo,2,Wed May 7 13:25:24 2014 UTC,"There is no subcutaneous emphysema and no air leak. The bulla is small and incidental.   Symptoms sound like hypertension. Have they considered cardiovascular work-up, weight loss and a renal angiotensin blood test.  Adrenals are normal on that second study so it is not a pheaochromocytoma.  Imaging is not helpful in malignant hypertension unless renal artery stenosis is considered."

Was calling it hyperinflated potentially due to the practically horizontal ribs, which can be indicative of a hyperinflated lung OR an excellently deep breath in someone who actually COOPERATES with an X-ray tech's instructions. Cooperation is so rare that it looks almost like pathology. Sad world."

Radiology,24vcdo,VIRMD,3,Tue May 6 17:51:48 2014 UTC,It's not uncommon to see the line kinked at the point of entry. There is no need for a lateral CXR; if the line can be flushed then it's fine. There is an opacification in the left hilar area. The right mammary border can't be visualized
Radiology,24vcdo,bonedoc59,2,Tue May 6 19:35:56 2014 UTC,In my opinion subclavian placed ports are more prone to the migration of the catheter.  We use the right internal jugular as the standard for insertion. Also if patients have large breasts the port gets dragged down while standing and pushed up while laying leading to the kinking. She could have possibly had a right mastectomy which would lead to the left insertion.
Radiology,24vcdo,VIRMD,6,Tue May 6 22:10:16 2014 UTC,"This is an easy one... I was able to diagnose it from the text header alone (but confirmed it on the radiograph). The problem is that a surgeon placed this port. Interventional Radiologists (and nephrologists, according to KDOQI) know that the preferred site of venous access for a subcutaneous infusion port (or dialysis catheter) is the internal jugular vein. This port was placed via subclavian vein access and is in the early stages of 'pinch-off syndrome,' where the catheter is repeatedly compressed between the clavicle and the first rib (which is exacerbated by the transmuscular course through the pectoralis muscles). Not only do subclavian vein ports suffer from pinch-off syndrome, but they also result in symptomatic central venous stenoses with much greater incidence than internal jugular vein ports. Furthermore, the catheter of this port terminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins (which is somewhat short of where it originally terminated due to the redundancy in the pectoralis musculature, but looks to have never been long enough to extend to the appropriate termination point within the right atrium); an inordinately short catheter is another hallmark of surgically placed ports. One final reason that ports placed by Interventional Radiologists are preferred is that surgeons seldom factor the type/location of malignancy into selection of port laterality. Mediastinal lymphomas, lung cancers, and breast cancers will often require external beam radiation to the thorax; inadvertently placing a port in the external beam radiation field shields a portion of the tumor from the radiation."

If you were my patient (and I am a board certified hand surgeon) I would get a CT scan to make sure it is healed. Can a healed or partially healed scaphoid fracture still cause pain 18 months later? Yes. Commonly? No. Someone needs to verify that it is healed. Can a scaphoid non-union at 18 months cause only occasional pain with innocuous x-rays? Yes. Commonly? More than you would think. Don't ignore this. If you do go on to develop a SNAC deformity, you're pretty screwed.  ETA: /u/lombardoz has given you good advice that I agree with 100%."
Radiology,24v5st,yermahm,2,Wed May 7 03:07:34 2014 UTC,"I have a CT from more than a year ago when my doc couldn't see if it was healing with the cast on, this won't help much now I assume.  I'll ask for another one on my appointment soon.  I thought I read everything about scaphoid fracture but I never heard about SNAC deformity or wrist fusion before, it's really scary, even more than avascular necrosis. Isn't there a surgery that replaces the scaphoid with a custom platinum scaphoid ?"
Radiology,24v5st,yermahm,2,Wed May 7 06:38:17 2014 UTC,"There is a company that makes a prosthetic scaphoid but not much long term data about outcomes. Given the 3D complexity of such a small bone, I find it hard to believe any prosthetic will fit well and provide much benefit. The acronyms in hand surgery are awful. SNAC is Scaphoid Non-union, Advanced Collapse. Just research scaphoid non-unions and you will be good. You will find a ton about scaphoid non-unions with osteonecrosis (not your case judging by films) and less about scaphoid non-unions with normal blood supply."
Radiology,24v5st,lombardoz,3,Wed May 7 11:16:29 2014 UTC,"Thanks for replying, it's mine actually. Lateral movement is okay, there's slight discomfort and pain right at the scaphoid though when in radial deviation, extension and flexion are still a bit limited compared to my other hand.  It may sound crazy but I think my hand has rotated a few degrees on its axis.    It wasn't fully healed when I took the last xray 6 months ago, do you think it's healed now ?"
Radiology,24v5st,lombardoz,4,Tue May 6 14:59:15 2014 UTC,"The dx said there was just a fracture in the scaphoid.  Here's the xray from the first day: http://imgur.com/a/hnUIK  There's a little pain but not always, when say, I'm trying to do a push up, the pain is not only in the scaphoid but also on the opposite side of the wrist (about where the ulna ends).  Last time I visited the doc 6 months ago he told me not to do any strenuous activities with the hand and not to lift any weight heavier than 1-2 kg, it's killing me not being able to workout for so long."
Radiology,24v5st,KarlTheGreatish,8,Tue May 6 15:29:16 2014 UTC,"Don't listen to other people about ignoring this. It's reddit and not a doctors office. You need to see an orthopedic hand surgeon. Look up SNAC wrist. The last thing you want is advanced collapse of the scaphoid and a subsequent wrist fusion. (Yes, worst case scenario, but still a possibility if you just ""modify your activities"" and deal with it). Best of luck."
Radiology,24v5st,lombardoz,1 point,Tue May 6 15:54:53 2014 UTC,"Wait, not to listen to people ignoring what exactly ?   You mean the collapse of the scaphoid can happen if I put pressure on my hand when it's not fully healed ? I should feel pain long before that happens at this point no ?"
Radiology,24v5st,Lucasvh,3,Tue May 6 16:55:50 2014 UTC,"Depends. I'm not convinced your X-rays demonstrate full healing. Additionally, your symptoms beg further work up. A healed scaphoid should be painless and not limit your activities. If this was my wrist, I'd be looking for further imaging and management options. Honestly, If i was in your shoes, I would expect to be getting a screw with bone grafting.  Take this for what it's worth (being anonymous on reddit), but please discuss this with an orthopedic hand surgeon.  If I'm wrong, then you've covered your bases."
Radiology,24v5st,Lucasvh,1 point,Tue May 6 18:42:32 2014 UTC,Yeah I asked the hand orthopedic about getting a screw or bone graft or even an experimental injection early on but he was totally against all of them. I asked if he thinks a surgery will be needed in the last time I've been there and he said that he thinks I'll most likely won't be needing it and it's better to let my hand heal on it's on to avoid complications from surgery.  I had a cast for two months and had to stop physio very early because it wasn't healing so that's probably the reason I don't have a full range of motion.
Radiology,24v5st,SoBeefy,1 point,Tue May 6 19:33:06 2014 UTC,"It looks to me like it is healing, and avoiding avascular necrosis (yay!) but that it's not fully healed yet.  As a bone with rather poor perfusion and long healing times, it wouldn't concern me terribly.  Now that it's healing, perhaps look into further PT?"
Radiology,24v5st,stillcole,4,Tue May 6 19:58:23 2014 UTC,"Ok. To stir this pot a little more. OP is 1.5 years out from original fxr. By definition, this is a nonunion if he's having pain and radiographs continue to show fracture diastasis (unless pain is from RSD, which I will bet my mortgage this isn't the case).  At the very least, I want to see a CT to confirm bony bridging. I fail to see how PT will help heal this. Basic bone science indicates this needs absolute stability with biologic support and PT will be doing the opposite. PT isn't a catch all treatment that can just ""heal ligaments or bones"" in this situation. Understandably, the risk of surgery may be a concern but continued pain and disability needs to be considered. My impression is OP may be from a non-US location (""physio""), which is a likely factor in the continued non-surgical management.  As I said before, if this was my wrist I would want this fixed instead of watching it not heal for the next 6-12 months. I hope I'm wrong and you do magically heal but extensive orthopedic literature will back me on this one (see JAAOS 2003 article by Trumble on scaphoid nonunions, for example).    edit: Images also do not show healing.  The distal fragment is starting to develop cortical margins at the fracture site.  While long healing times ARE associated with proximal pole fractures, 1.5 years is unacceptably long.  I personally am concerned but it's OP decision to pursue further options."

Radiology,24lj7u,bmel22,-5,Tue May 6 18:52:43 2014 UTC,I am bother by that and the lack of use of lead blockers/shields right above the shoulder. Totally helps with the over exposure of the film/ip plate from scatter.  Same trick to place a lead blocker/shield behind the back on a Lat lspine. Totally cleans up the image.
Radiology,24lj7u,starbuxed,2,Sat May 3 07:11:21 2014 UTC,I have never heard of this for shoulders
Radiology,24lj7u,drsilentg,1 point,Sat May 3 20:29:25 2014 UTC,Me neither. Plus we do not have las shields that would stay in place on the upright Bucky. The amount of time involved setting that up plus the risk of the shield blocking relevant anatomy because it slid down doesn't really make the slight improvement to the image worth it (of course we use nice Phillips DR systems. I could see how using film on a larger or meatier person this could be helpful.)
Radiology,24lj7u,intervenroentgen,2,Sat May 3 20:34:56 2014 UTC,Works great on film and seems to work pretty well on digital. Then again digital is supposed to get a great image with algorithms.  So you have never heard of using  lead blockers to help reduce scatter? Especially with lateral lspine.?
Radiology,24lj7u,starbuxed,2,Sun May 4 03:38:02 2014 UTC,With the LAT L-spine certainly. But I personally don't see much of a benefit with shoulders since the bone density between a LAT L-spine  and shoulder is quite drastic; Both ala + lumbar vertebra + sacrum is a lot more bone than some ribs and the shoulder girdle.
Radiology,24lj7u,intervenroentgen,2,Sun May 4 03:53:38 2014 UTC,With the shoulder I believe it works well with film. Because of the light scatter from the phosphate layar in cassette. So any reduced density in the area say like the clavicle and scapula meet. Where you are most likely to burn them out. It's beneficial. Digital does kinda fix that issue because the computer can adjust it with its algorithms. I have taped up the blocker in the past. For standing.
Radiology,24lj7u,starbuxed,1 point,Sun May 4 08:02:22 2014 UTC,"Phillips DR systems (or at least the ones we use, but I believe it applies to all DR systems) use a TFT array with no phosphor layer.  CR systems typically use a storage-phosphor plate though."

Radiology,24lj7u,hughthewineguy,1 point,Sun May 4 04:00:18 2014 UTC,I said it reduces over exposure caused by scatter. Never said I lowers pt dose.
Radiology,24lj7u,starbuxed,1 point,Sun May 4 04:33:51 2014 UTC,"correct, that is what you said.  and you asked if /u/intervenroentgen had never heard of using blockers to reduce scatter.  i was not implying you were saying that putting shielding behind the patient would reduce patient dose, and i don't know why anyone with any sort of spatial awareness would think that, and i don't know why you think that anyone would think that you were saying you did it for that reason? cos clearly patient dose did not factor into anything you said up to that point.  in response, i said why, if you're going to block to reduce scatter, would you not place shielding between the beam and the patient, where it would reduce patient dose as well as produce better films. that i've heard of before, hence my second sentence is nothing but the word ""yeah,"" implying a response in the positive.  i continued on to say: putting it behind the pt simply to clean up films, na, i've actually never heard of that. truly. people may do that, but i've never heard of it, and it makes no sense to me.  but who gives a fuck about the patient aye."
Radiology,24lj7u,hughthewineguy,1 point,Sun May 4 06:40:25 2014 UTC,"Sorry if I was unclear, I  was typing hastily on my break. I  did not mean in between the beam and the patient. I mean say for an lspine lat, You would place the blocker posterior to the patient. This helps to reduce scatter from the patient. Therefore reducing the fog, or increased density on the film.  And for a shoulder you would place the blocker superior to the shoulder. But yes it helps clean up the model on the lspine lats. Try it next time you have a big pt that your doing on the table."

Radiology,24gtuj,soylentdream,1 point,Fri May 2 11:57:34 2014 UTC,Eagle syndrome:       Eagle syndrome or styloid–carotid artery syndrome  is a rare condition where an elongated temporal styloid process (more than 30mm) is in conflict with the adjacent anatomical structures.  Two forms of eagle syndrome exists: The classic form and the vascular one.     Interesting: Prune belly syndrome | Stylohyoid ligament | Globus pharyngis | Temporomandibular joint dysfunction   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Radiology,24gtuj,splanchnicus,1 point,Fri May 2 11:57:44 2014 UTC,The patient has a neck brace on
Radiology,24gtuj,soylentdream,2,Sat May 3 14:06:24 2014 UTC,Makes sense. Saw the brace but didn't see that as part of it.
Radiology,24gtuj,splanchnicus,4,Sat May 3 15:21:59 2014 UTC,"Is that a fracture of a calcified stylohyoid ligament, or did it just ossify piecemeal? Presumably, there's recent trauma."
Radiology,24gtuj,thellios,1 point,Thu May 1 18:49:53 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that calcified thing looks really weird.  What about the vertebral bodies, don't C3-C6 look excavated?  [edit] nevermind, just looked at some normal neck x-rays and those don't seem to be excavations"
Radiology,24gtuj,robo23,3,Thu May 1 18:56:43 2014 UTC,those are the cervical pedicles which come out at a goofy angle and overlap the vertebral bodies.
Radiology,24gtuj,thellios,2,Thu May 1 19:04:40 2014 UTC,Thanks!
