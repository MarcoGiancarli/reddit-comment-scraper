whowouldwin,3e08cf,NickTM,131,Tue Jul 21 02:31:53 2015 UTC,Cthulu Mythos.  You just brought a (barely) sentient being to a God fight.  Nyarlathotep wakes Azathoth. All gods and worlds and everything is uncreated in less than an instant.  All the Dakka in the universe couldn't save the Orks from Azathoth's sheer power. His waking up uncreates everything. Only Azathoth exists. And then He remakes everything to suit His incomprehensible will.  Azathoth infinity/10. The Orks stand no chance.
whowouldwin,3e08cf,Bonesplitter,46,Tue Jul 21 02:20:22 2015 UTC,"Exaggerating the power of Azathoth kind of makes the whole concept of Azathoth less powerful. It doesn't matter how powerful Azathoth is, the point is that Lovecraft's universe—our universe—is simply a dream belonging to Azathoth. And like the dreams we have, tossing and turning in bed, our universe also ceases to exist the moment Azathoth awakes. Our universe, too, will be forgotten not long after the dream ends.  His waking up doesn't ""uncreate"" everything. It isn't an act of tremendous will on his part, or even a matter of choice. Azathoth dreams the universe, and upon waking, we are coincidentally forgotten."

whowouldwin,3e08cf,British_Tea_Company,21,Tue Jul 21 03:33:00 2015 UTC,"Actually, considering the numbers advantage, assuming Odin and Thor aren't around, do you think Asgard could defeat a huge waagh?"
whowouldwin,3e08cf,British_Tea_Company,18,Tue Jul 21 06:54:44 2015 UTC,"Let's assume a few bajillion Orks came to invade Asgard, and let's assume they somehow could get in.   There's only one entrance on the Rainbow bridge, and the rainbow bridge itself is shown to be fairly narrow in both the comics and the movies and the shows.   What this essentially means is that the Orks are going to have to funnel in one way to attack Asgard. The average Asgardian is able to lift 30 tons, which puts them on Custodes levels of power individually, if not already reaching primarch levels. Without magic of course.   Asgardians also posses resistances to conventional weapons. (Including ballistics) which would make them have a resistance against the normal weapons of the orks. Throw in magic if they ever need the counteract against the gestalt field. But given how Asgardians would fight pretty ""orky"", using mostly swords and axes, this probably doesn't need to be in place unless someone wants to stand back and fire lazors with a staff.   I am gonna say yes. Even without Odin and Thor, Asgardians can take this."
whowouldwin,3e08cf,steven_Aemilius,19,Tue Jul 21 12:45:41 2015 UTC,"With the Gesalt field though, the Asgardian resistance shouldn't mean much. Ork believe there crude axes are strong enough to chop Through Space Marine armor. I think the Choppahs and DA DAKKA should be able to harm and kill the asgardians because the Orks would think they are just Empy's Humies."
whowouldwin,3e08cf,reivers,21,Tue Jul 21 13:07:59 2015 UTC,"think they are just Empy's Humies.    I doubt this to be honest. Most generic Orks tend to piss themselves at the sight of anyone who approaches certain levels of ""orkiness"" (Yarrick says hi). Given how Orks are terrified of a ""normal"" commissar, most Orks are going to be terrified the moment when a generic Asgardian get's right up after getting a sword through his gut.   And yeah, the above mentioned. They can do that. Asgardian regeneration is insane in pretty much all versions of themselves. I don't question whether or not Ork weapons can harm the average Asgardian if they don't use magic to protect themselves, but whether or not they can kill one of the Aesir quick enough so that he can't regenerate his wounds is easily questionable. (The Berserker in MCU was able to get right back up after having his own staff stuck right through him in a matter of minutes).   Asgardians have an advantage over Orks IMO for these reasons.    They are stronger. Much stronger.  They posses control over magic to various degrees. Some can use it to blow stuff up. Some can use it to teleport. Others can use it to heal. Others can use it shape-shift.  Asgardian weapons are pretty powerful, and more importantly, Orky. Thor's hammer. Odin's spear. The Berserker's staff. Sif's sword. Orks are going to get hacked apart when any of them get close. Since Asgardian ranged attacks rely mostly on magic, the Orks probably can't no-sell it unless there are weirdboyz around.  The Asgardians have insane amounts of stamina. They can hold out for days, and constantly replenish tired soldiers with fresh ones.  Homefield advantage (Also, Odin's vault containing OP things)"
whowouldwin,3e08cf,Brentatious,10,Tue Jul 21 13:41:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly everything you said and also their was a battle were the emperor with his custodes fought the Orks. The space marines,  under horus, were losingb a battle against the orks,  under their leader black fang. When the Emperor teleported down to the battle with his custodes, maybe at most ten thousand strong. The cut through the main ork host in no time and the Emperor cut black fangs head off personally. Only three custodes were lost. They were facing a fuck ton of orks and if the custodes could do do something that awesome then I have no doubt the more powerful asgardian warriors could do the same and more."
whowouldwin,3e08cf,Ace_Kavu,5,Tue Jul 21 14:29:47 2015 UTC,"Really depends on how many orks there are. If there was a Waaaghh of every ork in 40k...there's almost nothing they would be afraid of. Odin just simply willing masses of them out of existence might do it, but even very strong Asgardians? Doubtful. They'd keep coming. They'd die in droves, but they would keep coming, and I can't imagine they wouldn't end up getting through eventually."
whowouldwin,3e08cf,AlexisDeTocqueville,141,Tue Jul 21 15:34:45 2015 UTC,Welp 40K's got a pretty good chance of stopping a WAAAAGH
whowouldwin,3e08cf,DkS_FIJI,80,Mon Jul 20 23:34:54 2015 UTC,"Since OP used the term ""universe"" to denote the scale of the fight, I'd interpret the fight as involving all of 40k's orks versus another entire universe. And it's pretty much agreed on that if all the orks in 40k were to unite, they'd crush all opposition from the other factions."
whowouldwin,3e08cf,Wulfenbach,51,Tue Jul 21 03:05:39 2015 UTC,It's not really clear whether a united WAAAAAGH could beat back the Tyranids.

whowouldwin,3e08cf,igncom1,20,Tue Jul 21 17:03:23 2015 UTC,"Although the same can be said for the Orks, as the only way to effectively clear them is to destroy a whole planets bio-matter by exterminatus.  Something the tyranids won't do, as they want to drink it."
whowouldwin,3e08cf,Legion3,22,Tue Jul 21 04:56:47 2015 UTC,Tyranids basically do the equivalent of exterminatus. They strip planets of all bio-matter and useful mineral nutrients before moving on. They don't colonize in the long run.
whowouldwin,3e08cf,igncom1,9,Tue Jul 21 06:23:14 2015 UTC,"No, but actually taking the planets from the also numerous orks is a greater feat then most imperial worlds.  Without outside intervention, said battles go on for a very long time."
whowouldwin,3e08cf,Legion3,14,Tue Jul 21 06:26:41 2015 UTC,"But the tyranids will keep spawning more evolved at Ork killing nids. And the orks will just grow in number. Thus making the nids more effective at killing them (I'm going full fluff and ignoring the tabletop rules), so by the end it would be a huge slaughter."
whowouldwin,3e08cf,Will_learn_for_food,16,Tue Jul 21 07:08:59 2015 UTC,"The Orks also grow in size and strength from continued war.  There are lore reasons why I believe this to be the case, as a Tyranid Ork war over Octarius ended in a overwhelming Ork victory.  Tyranids can only recycle their losses if they win in the end, Orks kinda don't need to, they spawn regardless."

The orks stop only for as long as it takes to run over the fields of their dead.  Discord wraps the world in pure chaos. The orks run in circles for a bit, then slaughter the mad god while wearing red tutus. The orks now run faster.  The Mane Six unleash the raw, concentrated power of friendship. On a planetary scale the orks hesitate, for the first time in their lives not sure if they want to continue fighting. But the psychic field of this countless WAAAAAGH! is too strong even for the Elements of Harmony, and the orks keep coming.  In a desperate move, deciding that it will be far quicker and easier for her ponies to die rather than be killed by the orks, Celestia brings the sun down and incinerates the planet in holy fire. Equestria is vaporized, every pony is dead, and this little world will never even be remembered in the annals of galactic history.

More importantly though, 40k ships fight at many miles of distance, and star wars ships fight much closer. Still, ignoring all of that. Orks just fuckin' COLOSSALLY outnumber star wars. 1 ork shitstomps like 5 imperial or post-imperial footsoldiers and there are many ways orks can take out the small number of jedit there are that exist. I just don't see a way that Star wars avoids a shitstomping. Both worlds are limited to 1 galaxy of fighters, and the orks probably outnumber star wars by more than 50 to 1.

whowouldwin,3e08cf,WippitGuud,14,Tue Jul 21 03:36:24 2015 UTC,"The Orks cannot be defeated. They are a fungal race, upon each of their deaths seeding the ground with spores. More Orks quickly grow from these spores, already possessing knowledge of fighting and the will to fight, as well as cultural and basic skills. Therefore, as soon as one dies on the Earth, the planet is doomed. The only way to defeat them is to destroy their fleets before they land. Even then if spores touch the earth, we're screwed.  Another thing to note about the Orks is they all have some level of powerful psychic power. They can effectively will things into existence. The reason why red Ork crafts go faster is because they BELIEVE it will make it go faster, and this is enough to make it so.  No matter how powerful the force, or how godlike your army, they cannot win because the Orks will never be defeated. They are designed by a race beyond ours to be the ultimate survivors. Even if you were to somehow defeat them, the countless galaxies and worlds seeded with Ork spores are producing hordes of trillions continuously. The most you could hope for is a bloody stalemate.   EDIT: Someone said Nyarlathotep could wake Azathoth and unmake the universe, but if Nyarlathotep is in no danger because he's unimaginably powerful, why would he do such a thing?

Silver Surfer, on the other hand, is powered by the raw energy of reality itself, the Power Cosmic. It's an actual hax power that can do anything he puts his mind to within a certain limit. It's reality warping with more lore, essentially.  /2. Posting a second scan where he's still pwned by transmutation magic.  What's wrong: you say he resisted it. He got turned into candy and he's still candy. So, what you're saying is that he didn't do jack shit to resist it, actually.  /3. Posting Vegito ""feats"".  What's wrong: that post has no Beerus scans at all in it. Not that it would have mattered, since Vegito didn't do shit about the magic that's not even comparable to the Power Cosmic.

In the off chance it might not work, seeing as if he could maniplate kii infested flesh, he should be able to theoretically kill anyone by harnessing and stealing their life force.  If that makes sense."
whowouldwin,3e2xc7,Jiscold,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:58 2015 UTC,doesn't he always have perfect control over his board no matter what?
whowouldwin,3e2xc7,Imperium_Dragon,2,Tue Jul 21 19:27:29 2015 UTC,"Correct me if Im wrong, isn't Beerus cocky?"
whowouldwin,3e2xc7,Gutzahn,6,Tue Jul 21 16:27:29 2015 UTC,Nah not really.  Beerus opened up in his fight with SS3 Goku a flick strong enough to send him flying  back (it should be worth noting that Goku's taken planet busting attacks before in his base form without flinching) . And we've seen what a single flick could do. There was always the offchance that he could have killed him by accident.  I think he just goes for a finisher at the beginning to see if you're worth his time and after that he slowly escalates his strength level  in according to his opponent i.e fighting Goku at 60%.  Of course there are always the opponents who he can tell aren't worth his time.
whowouldwin,3e2xc7,Jiscold,6,Tue Jul 21 16:42:28 2015 UTC,dont forget busting a planet with a Ki blast the size of a marble.

whowouldwin,3e2xc7,ChocolateRage,2,Tue Jul 21 17:07:41 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen enough of Beerus yet, as I am only watching him the first time with Super. Best he has done was a very neat planet bust, and some quick, but hard to pin, space travel. Through his demeanor it seems like he can go much higher than what was shown so far. With the feats I know, of he isn't Silver Surfer level yet, but we only saw low end of his power, so he might be right up Silver's alley.  Most likely it will end up going along the lines of in character going to Beerus, and bloodlusted to Silver Surfer. It is unlikely that Beeus will get enough neat tricks throughout his screentime to catch up to a character with so much exposure, in terms of being versatile."
whowouldwin,3e2xc7,wolfpaladin,2,Tue Jul 21 16:18:51 2015 UTC,"while i think Beerus may be stronger Surfer has way to much versatility.   Round 1: in character Beerus should be able to win, he likes to open up hard. and if they dont entertain he kills them.  Round 2: Beerus dosnt even have a little chance right now, unless he gets something on a much larger scale of that Egg feat i doubt he will ever be able to beat BL surfer."

Despite his incredible durability, Goku died at one point from a normal virus. This indicates that the Ki-based durability of DB characters has no effect on changes at the microscopic level, such as the complex chemical reactions involved in a virus infection. As such, Whis doesn't have any particular immunity to Silver Surfer, say, severing all of his chemical bonds and instantly disintegrating him, and durability or power levels have nothing to do with it.

Beerus flew from his nebula to some outer planet ( do u know how big nebulas are? ) And when coming back, the nebula was nowhere near in sight when they left ( In low end it was counted to be billions of times FTL )  And beerus also can seal people in to swords, so yeah, I doubt the heralds can do jack shit to him."

whowouldwin,3e2lvz,bobdylan777,0,Tue Jul 21 19:16:03 2015 UTC,Skyfather level seems like it for now.  Mftl galaxy buster with 3 minute timehack.
whowouldwin,3e2lvz,reivers,11,Tue Jul 21 15:17:22 2015 UTC,"Whis is not a galaxy buster until shown to be...not even close.  How'd you even get to that point?  We've seen Beerus in action at 70% of his power and he wasn't even close to galaxy busting and Whis is definitely not 11 orders of magnitude stronger than he is.  Because his 70% was nowhere near galaxy level we know that when the Kais say things like ""he'll destroy the universe"" they mean go through and wipe out every planet with life rather than literally blow up everything in one blast.    For reference the Milky Way is 5.8 x 1011 times more massive than the Sun, and that's the low end estimate.  I see people spreading misinformation about galaxy busting everywhere since Super came out."
whowouldwin,3e2lvz,bobdylan777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:25:20 2015 UTC,"For whatever it's worth, Beerus at 70% is rated as a 10, Whis was put at a 15. Goku in BotG would be a 6.   Whis is supposed to be stupidly strong. It's doubtful he's a galaxy-buster (that is, destroying it in one blast), but we'll never find out, either. He's not the kind of character that would ever attempt that. Best we'll get is seeing Beerus do things, and putting Whis far above that level.  Given that Beerus very casually destroyed precisely one half of a planet with a lazy ki-infused tap on a table...Whis is a monster."
whowouldwin,3e2lvz,reivers,11,Tue Jul 21 15:45:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, Whis is a monster, but to be a galaxy buster he'd need to be billions and billions of times stronger than what Beerus is shown to be at 70%.  That's why I'm so flabbergasted that I've seen it so much since DBSuper came out."
whowouldwin,3e2lvz,bobdylan777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:38 2015 UTC,"I never said he was one. I said it's doubtful he is one. He still could be. Gods only know how they scale power, might end up being something really pisses Whis off and BLAM, a galaxy is gone.  Definitely not as of yet, though. And again, I doubt we'll ever find out for sure. He just doesn't seem to be the kind of character that would do that. At best, he'd get Beerus to do it.   Also, we have no idea if Beerus is or not, either. We know Beerus is a casual planet-buster (I highly doubt he was at 70% of his power when he just tapped the table to destroy half that planet). Not only can he casually destroy planets, he does it with absolute precision. That takes real power. It would actually be less impressive if he just punched the planet apart."
whowouldwin,3e2lvz,reivers,6,Tue Jul 21 16:12:08 2015 UTC,It takes real power but still less power than casually busting a star.

whowouldwin,3e2lvz,bobdylan777,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:23:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah surely, in the huge ass universe, it would be a massive threat for him to destroy planet by planet.. NO.  In the movie Battle of gods whis states that if z fightesr anger Beerus, entire solar system disappears in an instant.  Beerus destroyed several suns ( one one, but sevarl ) stated by Whis.  Then in the episode 3, Elder Kai states that Beerus might go beyond planets and stars and destroy the entire universe, and it was seriously stated, not overtime like with buu and frieza and cell which were obvious over timers.  Listen up, I am not saying yet that he is going to blow up the universe with 1 blast, but atm I am starting to think that he is a galaxy +..."
whowouldwin,3e2lvz,BenkeiBoss,8,Tue Jul 21 15:32:42 2015 UTC,"It would be a massive threat since he travels so fast.  And he doesn't need to destroy every planet, just the ones with life.  And considering he seems to have crossed a huge part of the universe in 26 minutes 44 seconds by riding with Whis it definitely wouldn't take him that long to destroy all life. Dude there is an enormous difference between a solar system and a galaxy...I'm not sure what you're seeing here but I already told you how much bigger the Milky Way is than the Sun.  Are you not understanding how much bigger it means? I read the manga and Whis makes no mention of Beerus destroying multiple stars with one blast.  He only says that he destroyed a couple stars.  He can do that by quickly firing two blasts.  We've seen Beerus at 70%.  I'm repeating myself at this point but I already explained why that means he'd go about destroying the inhabited worlds.  Maybe if he was super pissed he'd destroy their entire star systems, but that is orders of magnitude below galaxy+"
whowouldwin,3e2lvz,bobdylan777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly this ""difference between solar system to galaxy"", and ""He only tanked X amount of the blast"" is a R/WWW is a sub only thing. Idk about how much comics care about physics, but the things that people on this sub think about is NOT what going on in Toriyama's head.  Maybe he doesn't know how big the galaxy is compared to a SS. But, if it's next in his Destructive Progession so what.   I'm not saying Beerus is a Galaxy Buster. This is more a rant towards ppl who say ""Cell can't destroy SS, the difference between Planet Bust and SS bust is HUUUUGGGEEEEE""."
whowouldwin,3e2lvz,BenkeiBoss,7,Tue Jul 21 15:58:15 2015 UTC,"And if Beerus is shown to actually blow up a galaxy, I'll think it's sick as and immediately accept it as a feat.  But on this sub there'd be no way to compare characters from different universes without using some common basis, and the scale of the universe is one of those."
whowouldwin,3e2lvz,thetaimi,2,Tue Jul 21 16:06:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I understand where you're coming from.
whowouldwin,3e2lvz,bobdylan777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:11:52 2015 UTC,"I know how much bigger it is, million upon million times bigger.  But destroying solar sytem to beerus is like for you doing 2 push ups ( considering ure not fat and in shape.. )   The manga is different from the movie, which Herms ( the main translator etc from kanzenshuu posted ) and in that it said that he destroyed several suns.  Anyway, that statement in episode 3 was so serious and the fact that Beerus is so above anyone else in the series ( buuhan, vegito ) makes me believe that if I see a bit more feats from him in the next few episodes, im def putting him at galaxy level, at the moment I have him sin busting, perhaps at mini galaxy."
whowouldwin,3e2lvz,thetaimi,8,Tue Jul 21 15:53:55 2015 UTC,"Billions and billions, not millions and millions. Here's your argument:  I'm assuming you're in shape for this.  Let's say you get down and casually do two pushups.  Easy right, feels like you can keep going to 100 without much trouble.  A solar system is billions and billions of times less massive than a galaxy.  So what you're saying is that since you can very easily do 2 pushups it's reasonable to assume you can do 2 billions pushups.  Come on man. The manga is the canon one. Especially considering some aspects of the movie are getting retconned.  And again, destroying several stars doesn't mean it was with one blast.  I don't understand what you're not getting from that. Lol mini galaxy is still way too many orders of magnitude above sun-level.  Yes, the statement is so serious, and I've already explained what it meant considering we've seen Beerus at 70% power.  Beerus can only be put at galaxy level when he actually blows up a galaxy."
whowouldwin,3e2lvz,bobdylan777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:05:22 2015 UTC,"The manga for BOG/ROF/SUPES is not the CANON one.  It was obvious that he destroyed the several suns with 1 blast.  Well, about the galaxy statement I did, this ain't going no where, is it? So lets agree to disagree."
whowouldwin,3e2lvz,thetaimi,7,Tue Jul 21 16:11:31 2015 UTC,"The manga is not the CANON one.   Wtf lol.   It was obvious that he destroyed the several suns with 1 blast.   Oh really, and why is that?  Occam's Razor dude.  The simplest and most logical answer is that Beerus fired more than one blast and blew up more than one star."

Once there are enough orks they'll suddenly start seeing the ork variations that know how to build crazy weapons. As the ork population gets larger and larger there'll be more fighting which will create even larger warbosses. These larger warbosses are the real danger, they are intelligent enough to lead the vast waaaghs that are such a problem. Also orks instinctively follow the largest ork so the big ones are more dangerous simply because they'll be followed.  Actually cleansing a planet of orks fully is almost never done.

whowouldwin,3e3n58,Chriscftb97,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:10:16 2015 UTC,"My arguments for Juggs and Rand over Dante and Bayonetta:  A: Rand can open a gateway and just skim them both to the top of the mountain. If that isn't allowed, Juggernaut is completely uneffected by the elemets and never tires while Rand has weaves to protect himself from the elements and is at least a proven skilled enough climber to climb the stone of tear, a near impenetrable fortress.  B. Are we talking all of the opponents enemies or just their most common adversary? If it's all of them is it all at once or a gauntlet? I have every confidence that between Juggs tanking and Rand's magic they won't have trouble but I need to know more on the enemies.  C. Juggernaut is just as strong as Hercules except much more durable. With Rands strategic mind and channelling for support this will be a breeze.  D. The only troubling ability is Bayonetta's ability to slow time which I would need to know more about the extent of. Neither has the damage output to take down Juggs and Rand's channelling is strong enough to take out both of them even if Juggs can't just rip them apart.  E. Rand has weaves that can inhibit hearing within a range. They can babble all day and Juggs and Rand shouldn't be affected.  F. Rand Skims to the area and they toss it in. Otherwise Juggs just walks there completely unimpeded and drops it in. Rand can tear apart the armies on the way just for fun.  G. Rand is a strategic genius especially when he is integrated with his memories from Lews therin Talamon. They have thousands+ of years of experience commanding armies between all the lives of the dragon. Lews Therin was known as one of the best ever at the strategy game Stones which is very similar to Go. He should pick up Chess quickly and dominate.  H. Nothing could knock Juggs into the water but he would probably go down when it's one of the balance things. He's gigantic though so the jumps would be nothing. Rand is very quick and agile so should have no problems. If Juggs falls, Rand could catch him with a weave of air before he hits the water and place him back up.  I. Probably going to lose here but I don't know the intelligence of Dante or Bayonetta. Rand is very smart but doesn't have much formal education. Juggs is kind of a dunce.  J. Same as D.  K. Good luck beating Juggs in a no weapons, no magic brawl. There are very few people in all of comics that could do this.  L. Juggs is big and strong enough that he just runs as normal and drags Rand along.  M. Juggernaut headbutt for the win. Other than Rands Swordplay, they don't really lose much by having their hands tied.  N. Rand could likely last until he's too old and powerful channelers age very slowly. Juggs could last for eternity.  O. We're fucked here."

After a lengthy battle, they are incarcerated, but it doesn't end there.   Spectre, God's vengance convinces Superman that those villains must be killed. Superman then gathers the team of: Him, Wonder Woman, Black Adam, Aquaman, Powergirl, and Atrocitus to go after the incarcerated villains. Under Spectre's influence, they all believe that killing the villains would be best.  But at the other side, The Phantom Stranger takes this opportunity to atone for his sins. He convinces Hal Jordan that if that team successfully kills the villains, then the balance of the multiverse will be thrown out of wack. So Hal composes a team of: Himself, The Flash, Martian Manhunter, Shazam, Sinestro, and Firestorm.   Who would be the Spiderman role? Batman. His closest non-bat family friends will obviously tempt him to join their cause, but perhaps his no killing rule will sway him otherwise.  Now who would win? Superman's team has more raw power, but in the end I would see more people joining Hal's side. In the end, I could see Batman making a big sacrifice for Justice, which would no doubt prompt Superman to break free from the Spectre's influence."

Yamcha actually volunteers to fight these two, which shows he's confident enough to take on 1st form Frieza.   This is relevant because Yamcha's the biggest fucc boi of the series and won't fight unless he has a large chance of surviving or the Earth's in danger and he's the only one left to protect it.

The higher you go in tier the exponentially faster the characters get, to the point where FTL becomes generally standard when you start talking guys like Flash and Superman. The Avatarverse isn't bad, perhaps with some spirit magic and modern upgrades it could be formidable, but the problem is that every single person in that world is a glass canon, because despite any agility feats or external bending powers that they have, they lack the amount of speed to back it up. Airbenders are slightly better in this regard, but not by much.  It doesn't matter how much you can put out, but if you have human durability you'd best bet your ass that you have some good speed feats to back it up."

whowouldwin,3e3bbe,vave,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:44:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like revived madara could pretty easily solo the admirals with his 25 perfect susanoos. Even if they somehow got through that, he could rain down meteors bigger than what fujitora has done in the anime so far. Since both sides should have ""haki"" equivalents, madaras mangekyo sharingan would then give him an edge (assuming he hasn't gotten the rinnegan back yet).   Madara was also able to keep up with guy's 8 gates (a little farther on in his revived state, but still) so he should be fine with kizaru's speed and whatnot.   I'm not 100% sure (so call me out if I'm wrong here) if madara could use genjutsu with the rennigan. Even if not, while he still has his sharingan he could put all the admirals under a genjutsu in the beginning of the fight, rub one off real quick, then kill them anyway he wanted.   Madara is a badass."
whowouldwin,3e3bbe,theodorepwilkins,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:25 2015 UTC,"Because the 25 perfect Susanoos were when Madara was an Edo Tensei and had unlimtied chakra, we don't know if he could do it while alive.   He was the jinchuriki of the 10 tails when he fought Guy, you can't really count that.   I don't believe he ever showed Genjutsu with the Rinnegan."

Mjolnir has incredible energy absorption properties, which may or may not cause hal problems. Hellbat cant do much against anyone listed here imo, he and ironman are kinda side stage entrants.  Really, comes down to if mjolnir can absorb what hal can dish, which i believe it could, so i say Odinforce Thor wins."

whowouldwin,3dz1ch,ThatPersonGu,106,Tue Jul 21 12:49:06 2015 UTC,"Sean Connery (lust lusted) could gain a job at SHIELD with his skills and is canonically known to sleep with co workers. He would probably get to Caps level with blackwidow/other female agents normal strength.  He would then seduce some of the x-men females. Storm seems like his type...  But other than storm powers, he could probably one night stand his way into some telekinesis, intangibility, diamond skin. He would have to high tail it away from the school then cause the male x-menners would probably be pissed. After that he could probably set himself up to (do it for the mission sean!) Mind control some males characters (I'm thinking the thing, or other characters without super high mind control resistance) to do the deed and become pretty powerful.  After the does the dirty w nightcrawler he could tele to Asgard and plow as many assguardian women as possible. Rackin up enough strength to make his way through the hulk family (impressing them as he goes with his strength)   Sentry is always a bit confused so it wouldn't take more than a couple days for Sean to get into his molecular-matter-controlling pants.  He may be strong enough to take Thanos now, thanks to massive amounts of strength, matter manipulation, and some of the beat versatility ever seen in a character.   If that all won't do it, he'll have to find some female heralds and see if they like superstrong super agents."

In a quick move of rectangular solidarity, nearby Wyoming  and Kansas adopt a similar stance within the week.  Rejecting the barbaric declaration, a Coalition of New England states quickly respond with condemnation and a declaration of support in the favor of the superior crunch variety. They issue an ultimatum: return to the light side or face the consequences. Georgia, invoking the name of George Washington Carver (Peace Be Upon Him), joins the Crunchy Coalition in a surprising act of Southern solidarity.  Previously neutral, California takes offense at the aggression of those ""stuck-up East Coasters"" and backs the evil Creamy Confederacy. North California and North North California (known by some as Washington and Oregon) follow suit by default.   From here, the dominoes fall into place quickly. It's clear where things are heading, and no state wants to be left vulnerable or powerless outside of the two growing powerhouses. Inspired by Georgia's quick rise to the crunchy rallying cry, other Southern states follow by example, many claiming that ""they already have a great idea for a flag to use.""  Most of the Midwest reluctantly joins the Crunchy Coalition, with little direct interest in the war (they prefer soybean-and-corn paste) but wary of being absorbed by Canada in the chaos. Many midwestern resolutions declare it ""the lesser of three evils.""  The southwest's heavy Hispanic population, known creamy sympathisers, are enough to push those states Creamy.   Finally, the battle line is drawn roughly along the Mississippi River. Texas splits off to do its own thing with Nutella.  The war is a long and messy one, with not enough jelly on each side. But in matters of Crunchy vs. Creamy, all wars are holy wars and God's favored side inevitably prevails. Eventually the Lord's Crunchy Coalition wins a terrific victory on the plains of Missouri and is able to snowball that into a won war."

When Goku and Vegeta fuse via potara, their strength is not just added, but increased an indeterminate amount more than the sum of their parts.

He can most likely destroy stars without straining himself too much. If you want vague powerscaling, then he might be at galaxy busting levels. Most likely not however, this is all based off of the statement by Beerus or Whis that Beerus can destroy galaxies if he strained himself. If what he said is true, then Goku could destroy a galaxy 70% smaller than the galaxy Beerus can bust if he strains himself. The most likely case is that the statement is BS, Beerus would need a little more than an off handed remark that he can destroy galaxies to convince me. But Goku is certainly planet busting."

Dr. M's best feat was winning the Vietnamese War or something.""  It's not even a matter of ""oh, this person is misinformed."" I mean, to post about these two characters means he knows who they are in some capacity. It'd be understandable if he posted some obscure comic book characters who only has scans from the 80s, but everyone and their mother knows how strong Thanos with the IG is.

Not to say this argument is correct by any means but it's under that sort of mentality that the sub saw Dr. Manhattan as one of top players for a few weeks.  Add in extrapolation and misinformation and general lack of feats from forums like Screw Attack or Youtube's communities and easily is enough doubt for the average person to not know better.  I'm just saying the assumption here is leaning hard towards spite rather than general misinformation from uninformed or new user. Negativity just feeds negativity.

I am going to say yes, because if not I am not sure the Buffy team will have as much of a chance.    I do not know much about the Secret Six, the heaviest hitters to me seem to be Jeanette and Scandal Savage.     Xander is pretty much useless.  He is the heart of the group, but he is just going to be swatted aside almost immediately.  I think Buffy could take Catman.  She has a strength and speed advantage, whilst also excellent at martial arts and proficient in many weapons.  In the same way, I think Angel could take him if needed  Scandal Savage has those Lamentation Blades, and if so I am not sure what they could do except dodge them.  We can speculate that the Slayer Axe might be able to block those blades, but I am not sure.  If so this gives Buffy a way to possibly at least subdue Scandal.  If Bane touches any of Team Buffy, I think that person will be just a splatter on the wall.  They are going to have to use any weaponry they have.  Deadshot would be able to kill about everyone himself if he wanted except probably Buffy, Angel, and Willow.  Angel isn't unphased by bullets, but they cannot kill him.  I am sure a rocket launcher could, but he would have to go there first before Angel could kill him.  Jeanette sounds like she is a powerhouse  I think this all comes down to Willow.  She is a extremely powerful witch capable of granting people powers on a global scale.  When she goes to Dark Willow there was not any way anybody could stop her.  Temporarily they could distract her by talking, or when Giles hit her with some magic, but Xander only was able to stop her by convincing her to stop.  Willow could likely solo all of them, except maybe Jeanette.  She might have the magical prowess/resistance to counter Willow.  If Willow goes all out I am going to go 7/10 to Team Buffy, because I have no idea how Jeanette would handle her magic.  If not 9/10 to the Secret Six.  Without planning Team Buffy has lots of issues.  Buffy and Angel (and I guess Cordelia EoS) are good fighters, but to handle a straight up immortals with extreme durability and no noticeable weaknesses like Scandal and Jeanette is something they are going to need to plan for."

Illidan is a unique hybrid.  Neither Night Elf nor demon, but something more.  The abilities he gains from having so many Class types and specs are too numerous to list. They include vast magical abilities, primarily those of the Arcane type, invisibility and stealth aptitude, and intense sense boosts, particularly in the ability to see and sense magic, demons, and other energies.   His eyes were burned out by Sargeras and replaced with orbs of  mystic fire, allowing him to see all forms of magic.  He wields the power of the Skull of Gul'dan and the Sargeras tattoos.   His addiction to magic and his love for Tyrande are his two most  famous weaknesses.   Equipped with dual glaives.     Thrall. Orc Shaman, Former Warchief of the Horde-   Controls Nature Magic (Lighting, Earth shields, Earthquakes) Wind Magic (Speed enhancements, Spell interrupts,)   Fire Magic (Flames, Magma,)   Water Magic (Healing, Frost spells, Mana regeneration,)   Spirit Abilities (allow him to summon spirit wolves that heal him as they do damage, turn into a swift Spirit Wolf himself, as well as see things happening far away, walk on or breathe under water, revive the dead, revive himself (one an hour), berserk with Bloodlust and use Elemental Totems.)  The Totems allow him to attack, heal, distract enemies, or summon Fire/Earth Elementals.   He is also the most powerful Shaman ever known, capable of holding together a planet on the verge of breaking apart. By himself, for several months at a stretch. Then fighting the dragon who did the damage.   He is also a highly trained Gladiator, proficient with maces, axes, staves, daggers, fist weapons, shields, unarmed, mental, and spiritual combat. He wears mail armor, can turn people and animals into frogs, and can bind elemental beings.   Equipped with a one-handed hammer.    I say Illidan would need to speed blitz Thrall, but Thrall's Wind magic and BL boosts his speed and he has a couple ways to slow Illidan down.  I don't think Illidan can handle Thrall's healing, summons, resurrection ability, and fighting ability all at once. Even though Illidan is very likely to be more powerful, I think Thrall would outlast him thanks to versatility and healing."
whowouldwin,3e2zwa,Roflmoo,2,Tue Jul 21 16:14:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not a warcraft lore expert but I will try to do my best here. I think it comes down to location and time.   Thrall has a lot more power and showed much more feats of strength after he stopped being warchief of the horde to deal with Deathwing. Before that, without the help of very powerful magic I don't recall any crazy feats of strength. Also when Thrall faced Garrosh in the Siege of Orgrimmar his access to the elements was severely cut off due to Garroshs magic.   Illidan is quite powerful. I can't recall feats of strength specifically but If you assume he could defeat the people who served under him, you can see he is quite powerful (Lady Vashj, Kael Thelas, Terron Gorefiend, all the other jacked up daemons in Black Temple). He can summon deamons to help him too as shown in the fight (infernals) although whether fight mechanics are canon is debatable.   Also it's implied lore wise it takes the combined might of both factions to defeat him (but tone fair, that implies his minions too).  So if your question is WARCHIEF Thrall against Illidian, I think Illidan takes it 9/10 and that's being generous to Thrall.  If Thrall can access and use the elements like he did on Draenor when fighting a regular old non-old god infused Garrosh? That might give him 2/10 but I think the deamons might still overwhelm one shaman summoning the elements.   Again, not an expert so I would appreciate Nobbel the Nobel showing up and proving me wrong here!"
