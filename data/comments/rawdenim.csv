rawdenim,3e49ja,YoungSmitty,7,Tue Jul 21 21:24:11 2015 UTC,I loved how the 3Sixteen 120x denim faded and felt. The denim was super smooth and soft on the inside and produced really awesome high contrast fades. I really like the slubbiness of PBJ and Samurai denim. I thought the warehouses fit the best. The Uniqlo Made in Japan Selvedge were a great deal and faded pretty well
rawdenim,3e49ja,PrimitiveEveryday,3,Tue Jul 21 21:30:18 2015 UTC,"Dude, all of these look fantastic, imo.   That is an awesome picture, as well, very entrancing.   Which pair ended up being your favorite?"
rawdenim,3e49ja,PrimitiveEveryday,3,Tue Jul 21 21:26:26 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed the fade and comfort of the 3Sixteen. The PBJ and samurai sword had really characterful, skinny denim. The Uniqlo indigos kills on price and fade pretty decently. So hard to pick a favorite"

rawdenim,3e3swm,skepticaljesus,3,Tue Jul 21 20:55:51 2015 UTC,I dislike how you used the jc penny branded levis to represent all their products. I would have liked you to reference some of thier premium products like LVC.  But you insist on using them as the lynch pin of your arguement. I am willing to bet more people get into raw denim by levis 501 stf as thier first pair then any other brand. Kinda discourages those just starting the journey with  your elitist attitude towards the best entry level raw starter.

I'm pretty much sized out of them, but the waist on the pairs I tried was similar to pants that fit. I think I saw a another woman here say the same.   The fabric has stretch, so it should be okay. The problem with tight fits is really mostly when there's not stretch. Since you can lift your legs and whatnot, I don't see a problem. There will probably be some give with a few wears as well."

rawdenim,3e31bj,thriftyshirt,12,Tue Jul 21 19:40:48 2015 UTC,"Years ago I bought a pair of Unbranded 201, the first pair of new raw denim I ever bought. I had worn second hand, broken in raws, and ""washed"" selvedge, but didn't know what I was getting into completely.   I sized down one, based on the common and widespread recommendation. They were tight to start with, like can't button the top button for the first day tight. But after a week the waist loosened up, and it wasn't a problem to button them.   What never loosened up were the pockets and the rise. The pockets were useless, a smallish cell phone would hang out of the top and stab me in the hip if I bent over to tie my shoes. And the rise was so low and uncomfortable, they felt like they were cutting me in half. I'd sit down and the back waistband would open like a Muppet's mouth.   I wore those things for a YEAR, thinking ""this is just what raw denim is like."" I liked the look and sturdiness, and got pretty good fades, but never got used to putting them on. Some days, I'd look at them and shake my head and wear something else. I felt no ""pride"" in breaking them in, just frustration.   After about a year of suffering, I found a pair of Gap Japanese Selvedge raws on sale for $25. Same tag size as the Unbrandeds, same supposed cut - straight with a slight taper. I timidly put them on in the dressing room, and breathed a sigh of relief...they buttoned all the way up. They felt stiff and new, but not constricting. My phone fit all the way in the pocket! When I bent over, it didn't feel like someone was shrink-wrapping my beanbag with a high powered vacuum!  That's when I realized the Unbrandeds JUST DIDN'T FIT. Nothing wrong with them construction-wise, but the cut and the size didn't work for me. I felt disgusted that I had suffered for a year in those things, I think I dropped them off at a goodwill.   I felt no pride or accomplishment, just relief.   I spent a year and half in those Gap raws, and they still hang in my closet as my ""get dirty"" pair. I've got much more attachment to the ""easy"" jeans that just fit, than the ones I agonized and worked through for a year."
rawdenim,3e31bj,illcutz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"I just gone through a similar experience with my ST-220x. I don't mind breaking in jeans, and the fact they are stiff, sturdy and bleed on your other items of clothing BUT if they don't fit properly then what's the point?"
rawdenim,3e31bj,hanger,6,Tue Jul 21 18:53:48 2015 UTC,I think people tend to create a bit too much suck for themselves sometimes. Maybe I'm just a wimp but if a pair doesn't fit in a day or two I wouldn't get them. I would much rather have to soak them once they stretch out too much than have to fight them for two weeks after every time I wash them.
rawdenim,3e31bj,trumpetbeard,3,Tue Jul 21 16:39:11 2015 UTC,"if a pair doesn't fit in a day or two   I'm with you on that timeline. I've never had a pair become comfortable in the long run if it was still too tight after a good wear or two. Obviously that's limited to my experience, but I think a lot of people overestimate how long it should take for a pair to feel comfortable."
rawdenim,3e31bj,eskamobob1,2,Tue Jul 21 19:43:15 2015 UTC,I totally agree with you. I mean damn dude. Even my 32s only sucked for just over a week and now they are amazing. I just don't understand why jeans would suck for a long time before they fit well.
rawdenim,3e31bj,seriousxdelirium,5,Tue Jul 21 18:38:42 2015 UTC,"I think the emphasis in the community of stretching out your jeans creates a lot of the sizing problems and misery. I've never bought jeans that I felt I was stretching by wearing, the only discomfort I've dealt with is the initial stiffness."
rawdenim,3e31bj,ninthway,6,Tue Jul 21 17:36:11 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think there's something cool about breaking a pair of jeans in so they fit you perfectly, even if it requires fighting them a bit. At the same time, though, I feel that this creates a mentality that is often unhealthy - many people keep fighting their jeans for months on end despite them plainly not fitting or not being able to stretch out sufficiently. I know I've done this myself, thinking like 'oh, just another couple weeks, I'm sure, and then they'll be perfectly broken in' and that never actually happening. Honestly, if your jeans don't fit within about three weeks, you should probably stop wearing them for your health - if they're so tight in the waist that you feel nauseous, or so tight in the thighs that you can't climb the stairs, I think you're kidding yourself and trying to justify an expensive purchase.  In short, I think the 'badge of honor' of wearing raws is a little overrated, and I don't look down on anyone who doesn't want to subject themselves to it. I could go on another diatribe about how the fetishization of 'wearing it hard' is a kind of attempt to claim masculinity in clothing, but... let's not do that. ;p"

I know there's the whole, ""if you can button it, it fits"" angle, but if you are honestly not able to walk, sit down, or breath properly, or the jeans are so tight they leave you with a nasty rash at the end of the day, then yeah, maybe size up."

After how long would you give up on stretching a pair of raws? What crucial signs would you be looking for to determine whether your jeans will fit or not?
rawdenim,3e31bj,trumpetbeard,2,Tue Jul 21 16:12:00 2015 UTC,"To answer the advanced question first, I really just go by the standard rule of thumb around these parts that jeans will stretch top for you as best as they can by the two-week mark of wears. I give it three to four just to be safe (if I'm going to resell them, two weeks at that point won't make a difference in price, and the buyer might actually appreciate knowing how far the pair will stretch), but I'm done convincing myself I actually like a fit I'm unsure of over two to three months of wear."
rawdenim,3e31bj,illcutz,2,Tue Jul 21 16:38:21 2015 UTC,"With my contest PBJ's it was two weeks, maybe wearing them another week or two would have yielded wearable pants but at the end of the day, I just didn't feel like putting them on, the size just wasn't right and even if the waist had stretched, I still don't think I would have been comfortable in them. My motto is look good, feel good, and I didn't feel like they looked very good, so is there a pair of PBJ's in the future, absolutely but those weren't the ones.   Signs to look for to me, waist fit, thigh feel, sitting and below the knee. Those are the main things I really take into account. I don't like skin tight thighs even if it's looser below the knee and don't like anything super restrictive when sitting even it it works out elsewhere. My SG's now the waist is a little bigger than I wanted it but it hits all the other boxes."
rawdenim,3e31bj,btharveyku08,2,Tue Jul 21 16:57:11 2015 UTC,"It's usually apparent after a wear or two whether or not a pair will fit me. I usually use these criteria:  Can I get a good pinch of fabric at the thigh (not too much, but a little spare fabric that's not clinging to the skin)? If not, it probably won't stretch enough to be comfortable in the long run.   Pay attention to the rise! Particularly the back rise! If the jeans actually sit at the waist--as in, their not low on the ass because a low back rise is causing the entire waist band to sit too far down--then I can usually count on the waist to stretch enough to be comfortable. If the rise is too low, then even w/ an inch or two of stretching won't be enough to make the top block comfortable.   Obvious visual and physical cues: Is there too much moose-knuckle? Are whiskers setting after one wear? Does the top button look like it's going to pop off? Can I sit down for long periods without noticing how tight they are? Are stairs a challenge? Hopefully my misfortunes are useful to someone else as they try to size correctly.   And to second /u/elementality22, do I actually want to put them on. There's a distinct different between a ""break-in period"" and straight up uncomfortable. Takes awhile to learn the distinction."
rawdenim,3e31bj,iamberimeanbear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:55:58 2015 UTC,I think for me the back rise is a big factor as I'm quite tall and hate having my back side exposed. Then tapering and thighs have to be quite slim.   Still believe the 511 fit is probably the closest to being perfect for me. Hoping to find something better...
rawdenim,3e31bj,footcreamfin,2,Tue Jul 21 18:58:06 2015 UTC,"I look down on people who look down on others for a particular fabric/fit/style not fitting them or their aesthetic. Especially in a highly specialized corner of fashion like raw denim, there are multiple concepts that don't work for everyone; it ultimately all boils down to personal style.  Because of that, placing some arbitrary importance on this or that pair working for you and not some other person just seems strange to me.   If anything, I commiserate with those that have to resell their paairs. They obviously bought them because they wanted the pair, and it sucks if they can't make it work, because that's money down the drain (we're a great community for getting the most out of resales, but it's still invariably involves losing some money on the overall transaction)."
rawdenim,3e31bj,TBatWork,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:45:18 2015 UTC,"I had an old pair of jeans that i hadn't broken in fully because they didn't fit right, so I gave them to my friend, and they looked awesome on her, but as I described the care I could see her lose interest. She took them, but I doubt there will be any sik fadez haha. This reminds me of that a little, just cos I forgot about how much more work raw denim is then buying stretch jeans from h&m for $10."

rawdenim,3e0llv,ThatchNailer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:38:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is definitely interesting. It had virtually no give right when I got it, but then it relaxed and now it has a little stretch. Incredible quality.  I probably would have gotten the 0305s but I specifically needed a bigger thigh.  One thing worth noting is that I am fairly certain that the stitching is 100% cotton and therefore not incredibly durable."
rawdenim,3e0llv,illcutz,2,Tue Jul 21 03:51:22 2015 UTC,"Oh I am very aware of the all cotton stitching haha, it is way to weak. My next pair will almost for sure be poly-cotton stitching. I have no idea how these will make it to the 2 year mark. And you are so right about the denim having some stretch when it breaks in! It has so much give I love it."
rawdenim,3e0llv,illcutz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:04:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like they will make it, but they will be beat to shit and need a lot of love on the way there. I've already reinforced three areas in my crotch to prevent blowouts, and I have some shredding going on along the inseam of the left leg. The repairs are worth doing though, especially on these. The material still has ore life left in it than a brand new pair of department store jeans.   Do you know if Samurai uses all cotton stitching? I am also considering IH for my next pair; I know they use a poly core thread."
rawdenim,3e0llv,illcutz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:14:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have already had these things repaired like 3 times on the back pockets, the crotch is blown out in two places with a third on the way, and the coin pocket is missing some stitching. I am about to take them to selfedge for some serious repair. The yoke is also in poor condition, will need repairing as well.  Yes samurais are all cotton stitching. Rumor has it they have gotten new seamstresses or something as well because numerous complaints have been brought forward. Supposedly their quality control is a little worse, or stitching quality is a little worse, but I am of the opinion that it is just the nature of cotton stitching."

rawdenim,3dymw5,cheddarvillains,3,Mon Jul 20 19:26:19 2015 UTC,"So it's shipping one way for $5 (when they return the jeans) in their invoice but to ship them out to Monrovia, CA it depends on where you live. I'm from DC so shipping them cross country cost me about... $10. So all in all repair ($40) + one way shipping ($5) + one way shipping dependent on location ($10) = $55 total"

rawdenim,3dymw5,Pwnacus_Maximus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:08:28 2015 UTC,How much would you say yours stretched after 10 months of wear? is it really 2 sizes?
rawdenim,3dymw5,Soupaseb,3,Tue Jul 21 04:15:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would say 2-3 sizes is accurate. My waist is about 29-30 and these are a tag-sized 27, which measured more like 28. Then after wear it stretched to about 30. As long as you wear a well-fitting belt, it shouldn't stretch much past your waist measurement, so focus on finding a size which fits the legs best."

rawdenim,3dyiqe,Salsa_Z5,9,Mon Jul 20 20:24:28 2015 UTC,Today /u/robocob0 and I became denim brothers. Now someone just needs to buy my Black Marias so I don't feel bad about buying another pair of denim.
rawdenim,3dyiqe,Robocob0,6,Mon Jul 20 16:29:15 2015 UTC,Proud of you.
rawdenim,3dyiqe,Salsa_Z5,3,Mon Jul 20 16:38:09 2015 UTC,I wholeheartedly blame you. Never really looked at TFH too much because I really dislike the arcs. Then I started looking through the sufu thread and convinced myself I needed the 3xxx denim.   (Un?)Fortunately I found a pair of FHXNFXTY in my size.
rawdenim,3dyiqe,Salsa_Z5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:41:47 2015 UTC,"Just tried them on. I usually like wearing only one pair at a time, but I may have to start rotating these and my SG5105s"

rawdenim,3dyiqe,Salsa_Z5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:07:24 2015 UTC,Once I take them off I'll get some proper photos and post them
rawdenim,3dyiqe,mcadamsandwich,2,Tue Jul 21 01:13:40 2015 UTC,Have actual measurements?

rawdenim,3dyiqe,-CodeBlue-,2,Mon Jul 20 16:32:04 2015 UTC,How much did you size up in the loomstates? I can't wait for my pair to arrive. I have been guessing a lot on the right size however. I'm a 32 in RgT stantons and ended up ordering a 36 in the Loomstates..
rawdenim,3dyiqe,d4mini0n,2,Mon Jul 20 18:29:52 2015 UTC,"That should work, actually. I have a pair of RgTs in 34, and I have the loomstates in 38. The loomstates are a bit tighter, but they're from the first run that stitched up small."
rawdenim,3dyiqe,rcsAlex,7,Mon Jul 20 20:18:19 2015 UTC,I got some AE Strands for 250 during the Nordstrom sale! Time for me to keep uping my shoe game.
rawdenim,3dyiqe,gravrain,3,Mon Jul 20 17:08:32 2015 UTC,"Bourbon or Walnut? I kind of wish that I had gotten the bourbon, but I'm liking how my walnut pair are turning out."
rawdenim,3dyiqe,2capp,3,Mon Jul 20 17:17:06 2015 UTC,I got some cap toes in bourbon and was not impressed.  It had this weird yellow tinge that didn't sit well with me.  Exchanged for walnut and am really happy with it.  I would def pick walnut over bourbon but if I had the option having both wouldn't be the worst.
rawdenim,3dyiqe,gravrain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:41:28 2015 UTC,"Weird, I don't have any pairs of bourbon but I've looked at them a couple times and have never noticed the yellow."
rawdenim,3dyiqe,2capp,2,Mon Jul 20 17:49:20 2015 UTC,"It was more like the brown had a yellow tinge.  Hard to explain.  Unsure if you can tell here: http://i.imgur.com/pm2iTXL.jpg  Either way, it didn't have the shade I wanted for what I was looking for at the time.  Walnut fit the bill much better."
rawdenim,3dyiqe,rcsAlex,2,Mon Jul 20 18:30:50 2015 UTC,I got walnut! I like the lighter leather.
rawdenim,3dyiqe,gravrain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:46:31 2015 UTC,One day we should have a WAYFTWYS (What are you fading today with your Strands) thread.

rawdenim,3dyiqe,eskamobob1,2,Mon Jul 20 17:59:45 2015 UTC,Did I miss the nordstroms sale? Because if so that sucks. I was planning on picking up some strands for sure.
rawdenim,3dyiqe,rcsAlex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:27 2015 UTC,I think it's on for a few more days.
rawdenim,3dyiqe,eskamobob1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:44:10 2015 UTC,Awesome. Looks like I can still snag some AEs. Now I just have to decide if I want strands or McAllisters.
rawdenim,3dyiqe,icsmurfs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:19 2015 UTC,FYI - if you have AmEx you can get $50 off.   Edit: you will need to call AE to pricematch

Lots of fun, and I love being in the kitchen, but now I am at the beach (with Internet) and enjoying the world. What all have you guys been up to while I have been MIA for the past couple months?"
rawdenim,3dyiqe,Danphillip,6,Mon Jul 20 17:28:27 2015 UTC,"Finally started reading Catcher in the Rye. Looking forward to getting back in touch with teenage angst.

rawdenim,3dyiqe,brucenasty,10,Mon Jul 20 16:06:20 2015 UTC,level of teenage angst in rye is about as unbearable as the angst in order of phoenix
rawdenim,3dyiqe,hanger,5,Mon Jul 20 17:07:46 2015 UTC,You could follow it with some Hunter S Thompson and just roll right into adult angst.  Seriously though Salinger is one of my favorites. 9 Stories by him is great too.
rawdenim,3dyiqe,Bobzorz,3,Mon Jul 20 16:16:09 2015 UTC,"I just finished this a couple weeks ago for the first time myself. Really wish I had read it when I was a teenager, haha. As an adult, I can't help but roll my eyes a bit at Holden."
rawdenim,3dyiqe,kingsofbabylon,3,Mon Jul 20 16:27:59 2015 UTC,"Also, finished Bloodborne a few weeks ago and looking to get into a new game. Any recommendations for ps4?   What are you looking for genre-wise? If you want something similar but heavier on the RPG, Witcher 3. If you want something similar but heavier on the action, maybe Toukiden Kiwami?"
rawdenim,3dyiqe,Danphillip,2,Mon Jul 20 17:53:47 2015 UTC,Just watched reviews of both games.  I think Witcher 3 is next.  Have you played it?
rawdenim,3dyiqe,kingsofbabylon,2,Mon Jul 20 18:01:21 2015 UTC,"Not extensively but I've put a few hours in. Played on hard it's less unforgiving than Bloodborne/Souls but you still have to fight smart. The world is open enough for exploration to feel rewarding, and it's very pretty."
rawdenim,3dyiqe,Danphillip,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:03:49 2015 UTC,"Right on man, thanks for the recommendation.  I was huge into the souls series, but Bloodborne didn't do as much for me.  I really liked it, but it was like a 7.5/8 for me, where the souls games were all 9/10s."
rawdenim,3dyiqe,imbetterthanandrew,6,Mon Jul 20 18:08:37 2015 UTC,"So tomorrow is my birthday, and it's also the day my NEOC sample shoes arrive. I honestly think I'm more excited about the shoes, I don't think I'm normal anymore."
rawdenim,3dyiqe,Teamster,3,Mon Jul 20 16:08:20 2015 UTC,I dunno. I've never been the type to get excited about birthdays. It just feels weird.
rawdenim,3dyiqe,imbetterthanandrew,2,Mon Jul 20 16:10:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just like being with a bunch of friends for a day it's nice."
rawdenim,3dyiqe,Danphillip,2,Mon Jul 20 16:17:06 2015 UTC,Same. Birthdays and anniversaries. Just don't get into them.
rawdenim,3dyiqe,hanger,2,Mon Jul 20 16:17:39 2015 UTC,Oh man first your Quoddys now NEOCs?! You're really stepping up the shoe game.
rawdenim,3dyiqe,imbetterthanandrew,3,Mon Jul 20 16:19:49 2015 UTC,"I know! I used to be one of those people that said they'd never get handsewns, then I started to like the look. Once I ordered my sebagos it was only going up from there, man I love handsewns."
rawdenim,3dyiqe,Joemoose13,6,Mon Jul 20 16:21:08 2015 UTC,"Off to work in a few minutes, but I just wanted to say that Terminator Genysis was awesome! Like seriously, go see it. It actually explains the continuity of all the movies. And the cgi was some of the best I've seen in recent movies. Also, Arnold = awesome."
rawdenim,3dyiqe,btharveyku08,3,Mon Jul 20 16:11:11 2015 UTC,Did they explain why the Schwarzenegger-model Terminator looks like it's aging as the movie arc progresses?
rawdenim,3dyiqe,Joemoose13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, spoiler though:  All Terminators ""skin"" age, their skin can repair itself and as it does not take damage, it will progress to look as much human as possible to blend it. Bigger spoiler: He was originally sent back in 84 (date could be wrong there, can't remember 100%) so there he looks young, but some characters time travel ahead to 2017 (a day before judgement day begins) but the machine they built would kill Arnold so he has to wait 33 years to meet up with the characters who did the time jump. So he aged 33 or so years."
rawdenim,3dyiqe,d-rew,2,Tue Jul 21 02:42:10 2015 UTC,I never thought i'd see awesome and Terminator Genisys in the same sentence...
rawdenim,3dyiqe,JasperUngulate,6,Mon Jul 20 17:18:04 2015 UTC,That was one of the most intense EVO finishes (for SF4) I think I've ever seen. Don't regret not going out for drinks with the wife to watch it at all!

rawdenim,3dyiqe,mcadamsandwich,4,Mon Jul 20 22:27:29 2015 UTC,I'm on a serious spending freeze for awhile. All these sales popping up; killing my wallet!
rawdenim,3dyiqe,KingOCarrotFlowers,4,Mon Jul 20 16:33:31 2015 UTC,"I actually just realized I've been on a cop freeze for like two months on accident. I've just stopped looking at anything that I might want to buy, because I really want to try to get a ton of my student loan debt paid down. Going to try to be really frugal for at least a year and hopefully it'll mostly be paid off."
rawdenim,3dyiqe,d4mini0n,2,Mon Jul 20 17:29:22 2015 UTC,"Good luck. I've got over a year's pay at my current job in loans, and none of it went to tuition. That was just money to live on my year in law school when we weren't allowed to work. At least I'll be getting paid to go to grad school?"
rawdenim,3dyiqe,eskamobob1,2,Mon Jul 20 18:31:09 2015 UTC,I didn't know you even knew the term cop freeze. I have personally been splurging a lot recently tbh. Lots of summer wear since I didn't have much before. Also got a new backpack which is rather nice.
rawdenim,3dyiqe,KingOCarrotFlowers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:49:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, for me it started with realizing that there wasn't a single thing that I needed or even really wanted anymore.

rawdenim,3dyiqe,mfgfm93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:12:09 2015 UTC,"Looking in Arlington area, but it's honestly just as expensive as some neighborhoods in DC so I might try the city"
rawdenim,3dyiqe,lordbale66,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:26:30 2015 UTC,It definitely can be. And you pretty much need a car for Nova. There are good places to be found in DC. Just takes some digging.
rawdenim,3dyiqe,mfgfm93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:33:22 2015 UTC,One trend I did notice is that you definitely get more square footage in Arlington than in DC for the price (obviously) - but I could honestly make do for a sick location. Where're you based?
rawdenim,3dyiqe,lordbale66,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:35:01 2015 UTC,"That is probably true. Out east. I got lucky with the place I'm at. It's not the cheapest but it's nice. If you're looking for numbers, I pay $1000 flat. It's a furnished basement with utilities included. I have a few friends who found places for as low as $700 but they have roommates, shared common space, etc."
rawdenim,3dyiqe,elementality22,4,Tue Jul 21 04:53:54 2015 UTC,"I feel you on that one. I'd ideally like to avoid roommates, one because I've got three cats, 2 because I've never lived on my own and I want to do that, but same expensive rates here so we'll see. Even with roommates it's pretty expensive, my friend lives in a nice area near downtown but is paying 700 for rent/utilities for a small room in a house with 3 other people, that's too many people for me."

rawdenim,3dyiqe,kyle_phillips,2,Mon Jul 20 16:49:05 2015 UTC,"I have the 85s. I haven't worn any 81s but they look chunkier than 81s, and they're certainly moreso than 66s. I don't consider onitsukas for their ""support"" because I don't think of them as athletic shoes. I've done a couple 5-6 mile easy/moderate hikes in my 85s with no problems though. They're very comfortable walking around shoes."
rawdenim,3dyiqe,Tumtumtomtom-remote,2,Mon Jul 20 18:40:57 2015 UTC,"How do your think they fair against similar styles by saucony, NB, etc.?"

I'm a little bit worried that there's going to be a lot of the uniqueness of this book lost in the translation to film, though. I mean, it'll be cool to see the story play out, but it's different."

rawdenim,3dyiqe,KingOCarrotFlowers,3,Mon Jul 20 17:02:50 2015 UTC,"It totally is. I love the approach that it takes to solving problems and stuff--the rough man he uses to figure out how much soil he needs to bring into the Hab to grow enough potatoes to survive, and all of the ways he comes up with to fix the little/big problems that crop up.

rawdenim,3dyiqe,cnbll1895,3,Mon Jul 20 17:27:13 2015 UTC,"How do you make chicken soup?  I don't really go by a recipe and it seems to change every time I make it. Usually I use chicken thighs or legs, something with fat and flavorful bits. Tonight I started with thickly diced celery, carrot, red & yellow onion, a garlic clove, some tomato paste, some leftover chicken stock concentrate goo, and some thyme and bay. Later I added a couple cans of beans. Pretty tasty. I used a leftover spoon with some Dijon from a vinaigrette, and I think next time I might add a bigger glop of Dijon. Could add some nice flavor.   Oh, and young Gouda makes scrumptious cheese toast."

rawdenim,3dyiqe,PLKnight,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:31:51 2015 UTC,"I am lazy and of Chinese descent. These character flaws have led to my simple recipe for comforting chicken soup.   Chicken, usually about four thighs and maybe a pound of wings, frozen or fresh doesn't matter. Into the electric pressure cooker with a few cloves of garlic, smashed, a knob of ginger about one thumb-knuckle in length (more if I feel saucy), a couple scallion stalks, a glob or two of oyster/fish/hoisin/whateverIhaveonhand sauce, and enough water to just cover. Cap it, cook on high pressure for 30 minutes. Release the pressure naturally or quick-release if you're careful about it, then fish out the ginger knob and scallions with a slotted spoon.  I usually ladle it right into a bowl, bones and all, mash up the now-soft garlic cloves if I see them, and finish with a light drizzle of sesame oil and maybe a little vinegar/hot chili paste if I want a hot and sour flair to it.  It's not a fancy French consomm√© or anything, but I can prep it in 5 minutes and have it ready in half an hour with tons of leftovers which become a nice gel after sitting in the fridge a while. You can add noodles if that's your thing, leftover rice maybe, or use the gel the next time you saute some veggies."

There's a few more this year, but most I come across are high-waisted. Since a lot of 90s fashion was re-interpreting 70s styles (think of that Fiona Apple video), it only makes sense for them to pop up.  This is all trend talk. It all depends on the consumer to actually buy them, and I'm not sure if it's really taking off as much as it's being pushed. But everyone made fun of the Pantone color of the year, and now I see burgundy all over."

Then within a few hours (numerous trios to the restroom) they had completely come undone to what the pics showed. I guess that was the main reason that I took it upon myself to try and fix it. I realized that if I tried to wear them again without repairing them, there was a good chance they would tear or just get to the point of no return."

rawdenim,3dw115,snecseruza,2,Mon Jul 20 01:01:58 2015 UTC,That's very odd. I thought these are sanforized so they shouldn't really shrink much (certainly not 2 sizes).  Hmmmmm this is quite mind boggling.  Also I never knew Nudie have blue pocket stitchings. Learn something new everyday I guess.

This is a sanforized, mid-weight, slubby denim with an indigo warp and a vivid green weft and selvedge line. These are made with Xinjiang cotton and are woven to allow the green weft to be visible through the darker warp. Details include a sexy leather patch, green branded pocket tab (shhhh, don't tell Levi's), half-lined back pockets, and a 16 oz branded canvas carrying bag!!!  I bought these through a proxy service along with a couple of other items, which distributes the hefty price of international shipping to the States from China. I'm asking for $118 (includes shipping to anywhere) to cover the cost of this pair. This is a fantastic pair of jeans at a fantastic price.  Rogue Territory - Over-Dye SK  Size 29, Like New (just 7 total wears)   Waist - 31.75'' Front rise - 9.5'' Thigh - 10.65'' Knee - 7'' Hem - 6.35'' Inseam - 36''   Here's a link to Blue Owl's page for this jean. This is a sanforized, 14.5 oz denim from Nihon Menpu that was dipped in an indigo vat after sewing and then dried in a heater. It has a very dark indigo warp and then a lighter, aqua blue weft from the single indigo dip. This jean has a very regular weave and a super soft hand. Includes all of the usual RgT details. The only notable wear on this pair is a couple of creases where the previous owner double cuffed (this pair looks really good cuffed).  I bought these from another user on the sub who had worn them for a week before putting them on B/S/T. I tried them on once and couldn't get my calves to fit in the narrow legs. I'm asking for $180 (includes shipping to anywhere) to cover the cost of this pair.  Edit: Sorry there aren't more pictures, I took more than what's posted, but imgur has been a pain in the ass today. Anyways, Blue Owl and Sauce Zhan do a much better job of photographing denim than I do."

I've been in talks with my boss at my current position to transition into a full time role and while I like my job a ton, I'm hesitant to commit to it.  Even though I love Philly, I really miss the West Coast.  I've been applying to a bunch of jobs in LA, Seattle, and Portland but I don't know if it's better to just take this role here, live cheap and pay off my student loans in a couple of years, or take a risk and hope I can find a job out west by December.  Good news is that my boss didn't say anything when I wore my ST-44x's to work the other day.  Slacks 5 times a week was bumming me out."

rawdenim,3duej8,thespiderghosts,4,Sun Jul 19 20:24:45 2015 UTC,"Street tires should make the bike much better for city use. Luckily you have a 29er which makes this really easy! 29"" mtb wheels and 700c (normal road/cyclocross/hybrid size) are actually the same diameter. I would look into getting something like a 700c x 35c width slick or semislick tire. Idk what your budget is but you should be able to get a really good set of tires for ~$60-90. No personal experiance with these, but I've heard Shwalbe Marathons are good. Continental Gatorskins are also fairly popular but I'm not a fan due to the harsh ride and poor wet weather grip."
rawdenim,3duej8,wh11,2,Sun Jul 19 21:07:00 2015 UTC,"Awesome thanks for the tip.  A friend of mine recommended Shwalbe tires as well so I'll go with those.  How do these look?:   https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/schwalbe-marathon-plus-700c  And dumb question, do they come pairs?  So do I need to put the order quantity as 1 or 2?  And do I need tubes as well?  Thanks again :D"
rawdenim,3duej8,thespiderghosts,4,Sun Jul 19 22:36:06 2015 UTC,"Those look perfect, I'd get the 35 or 38 width. 38 will be a little more comfortable at the small expense of a little bit more weight.   Sometimes they are sold as two together (usually say ""pair"" or ""set"" or ""multibuy""), but those look like a single so order 2. You will need new tubes because the ones you have now will be too large."

They made a big deal about the millions they put into making their network competitive with the other two, but they never once improved reception in the two areas of the DC Metro that I frequent the most during the entire two years plus that I had them.

All of the effects back then had to be man made, so it just felt that much more real and believable. I was thrown off right off the bat by how fake everything looked.  I do agree about the BM thing, maybe I should have only used the comparison to the camera work."

rawdenim,3duemf,Sandyman99,3,Sun Jul 19 17:09:10 2015 UTC,You can always taper a pair to have more similar measurements to APC. If your willing to pay the 60$ it opens a bunch of interesting options (samurai comes to mind)

I have tried lots of popular brands, N&F weird guy, PBJ xx012, UB101, and a few others, but in every single case the ones that fit my huge thighs were never tapered enough at the leg opening to be flattering on me. the APC PNS has a roomy top block and generous room in the thighs but taper down to a ~6.5inch leg opening which looks good on me with my skinny calves and ankles.  I'm sure there are other pairs out there that are sharply tapered like that but they are not very common."

rawdenim,3duemf,stoneofsisyphus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:39:54 2015 UTC,"I will be ordering my first pair of unsanforized denim and need sizing advice. These are the Oni-288 from Denimio.   My actual waist is 34.5"". My thighs are on the large side - about 24"" around.   Based on measurements from Rodeo Bros. on Rakuten, the size 34 unwashed has a waist measurement of about 36"" and an upper thigh measurement of 13.4"". Also according to Rodeo Bros., the one wash size 34 has a waist measurement of 33.9"" and a thigh measurement of 12.2"". I am assuming that the one wash measurements from Rodeo Bros. are after a hot soak.  If I were to soak the jeans in cool water when I get them, am I correct in assuming that I would get some shrinkage, but not as much shrinkage as the Rodeo Bros. one wash measurements? I am hoping that a cool soak will shrink the waist to something like 35,"" and the thighs to 12.5 - 13"" or so, which would be my ideal fit. Then, I could just wash / soak the jeans in only cool / cold water whenever they get dirty, thereby never shrinking them too much.

rawdenim,3duemf,Pegthaniel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:27:58 2015 UTC,IMO soak it all in cold water first (since it should stretch back out up top) and then do the legs in hot water if it is still no good.  If it's still too wide you can always get 'em tapered.

rawdenim,3drxso,Turquoise_HexagonSun,2,Sun Jul 19 14:53:58 2015 UTC,No it's intentional. Iron Heart designs the jeans with wide spread pockets for motorcyclists to prevent wallet discomfort when on the saddle.

rawdenim,3dr4ri,denim4me,10,Sat Jul 18 18:30:30 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone, here‚Äôs my write up of the Oni 546NST 22 Oz Natural Indigo Kabuki Vedge Tight Fit Straight ‚ÄúNo Arc‚Äù jeans.  I bought these from Denimo and I simply cannot say enough positive about that experience.  I ordered on Monday at about 9 am and I received them in the Canadian Prairies 100 hours later; I paid $0 for shipping, $0 for duties, $0 for taxes, and they sent me a free package of Momotaro ‚ÄúMomo Drops‚Äù peach candy!  Now by way of background, this is my first pair of high end raws.  My current pair are from the now out-of-business Wood and Iron brand which I got at Winners like the poster of that thread.  They‚Äôre 13.75 oz Cone Mills Selvedge and so far have held up well.  I really am digging how those jeans change and fade with my body but I wanted something heavier with more contrast to the fades.  I‚Äôd been looking at Iron Heart, but my preference is actually to get the 666-SB non-fading ‚Äúsuper black‚Äù from them this winter, so I had to find an alternative heavy weight denim and came across these Onis.  Now for additional background, my sizing was and still is a bit of a mystery to me.  Since October 2014 I‚Äôve lost 71 lbs and my goal is to lose another 19; starting at 5‚Äô9 260 lbs, ending around 170 lbs.  My intention when buying these jeans was to get something 1 size smaller than my current true size with the hopes that they‚Äôll still fit when I hit my goal weight in 3-5 months time.  It remains to be seen how I did but I‚Äôm pretty confident that I did okay.  Okay, on to the denim review:  These Onis are a heavy 22 Oz loosely woven, natural indigo-dyed jean.  I bought the one-washed version because I wanted some assurance of the sizing ‚Äì kind of silly I guess since I‚Äôm more or less guessing at my final size anyways.  I would have bought the version with arcuates from Denimio but the one wash were sold out so I ended up with the no arc version.  As far as features go they have a unique Kabuki colour scheme most obvious on the selvedge ID which is green and red; BiG sells a version where this selvedge is used to create the arcuates which is, in my opinion, quite ugly.  The red and green colours are duplicated throughout the stitching which is not as obvious in online photos.  Most of the stitching is gold, but the fly, coin pocket and crotch are done in red, and the bottom of the fly and back pockets have subtle green bartacks.  The pockets have hidden (copper) rivets, but there‚Äôs no crotch rivet.  The fabric is heavy and rough but I‚Äôve never felt the famous Secret denim so I can‚Äôt compare.  I can say that if your only reference is Cone denim, this is a totally different animal.  Lastly, I was a bit surprised to see the buttons on these are plain donuts.  In hindsight this is exactly what‚Äôs pictured online, but pretty much every other Oni photo I‚Äôve seen has Laurel motif buttons;  these are as advertised, but it IS different than other Onis.  Fit is definitely tapered.  My goal was to get close to my current N&F Weird Guy chino fit, but one size down.  My current weird guy fit is:   Waist 38  front rise 11.25  thigh 12.75  knee 9.5  hem 8.5   The Denimio measures for this jean in size 36 one wash are:   Waist 35  front rise 10.4  thigh 21.7 (an obvious typo)  hem 8.1   The BiG measures for this jean in size 36 one wash are:   Waist 34.75  front rise 10.5  thigh 13  knee 9  hem 8.25   My actual measurements of this jean pre-wear are:   Waist 34 1/4  front rise 10 3/8  thigh 12  knee 8 7/8  hem 7 7/8 (the picture shows the tape measure not perfectly aligned to the edge, sorry).   Trying on the jeans for the first time I was quite skeptical.  My current Wood and Irons are too big for me now with a 38‚Äù waist after stretching from 36, so going down to a 34 and change seemed impossible.  Additionally, this is heavy, inflexible denim and the fly buttons are really f‚Äôn small with really tight button holes!  After trying them on it was obvious that they were wearable, but it still took me 15 minutes to get the buttons in the super-small button holes.  If you‚Äôve got some kind of bowel or bladder condition and might have to get these babies off in a hurry, they‚Äôre not the jean for you!  I was really pumped to see just how well these fit.  Tight in all the right places, rise is low but not uncomfortably low, and not so tight that I‚Äôm walking lock kneed ‚Äì I can bend and crouch and play with my toddler and dogs no problem.  They also sit low enough in the rise that they‚Äôre on my hip bones; I suspect that my planned weight loss won‚Äôt impact the waist fit much at all, since my bone structure isn‚Äôt changing any time soon.  Finally of note, there‚Äôs a huge left leg twist; you can see this starting way up at the thigh measures on my photos, and in the fit pics the Selvedge line on the left leg is over my mid foot.  I‚Äôm not bothered by it but you are, I guess take note.  The biggest ‚Äúflaws‚Äù with these jeans are two fold:  1, as addressed above, there are obvious sizing discrepancies.  BiG is widely regarded as the sizing experts, but my jeans differ significantly from their measures, so I think that there are some lot-to-lot variances which will be impossible to account for.  I don‚Äôt know if anyone would oblige ‚Äì I suspect Denimo would ‚Äì but asking for an individual pair to be measured prior to purchase might be nice.  Second, these are short!  I‚Äôm not a tall guy at 5‚Äô9‚Äù, but I won‚Äôt need these hemmed at all and I only have a 1 inch single cuff.  If you‚Äôre 6‚Äô tall or like a thick cuff then I‚Äôm sorry, but these ain‚Äôt the jeans for you.  I‚Äôm probably going to avoid wearing these for the next month or so as my Wood and Irons are coming due for their third wash.  Probably by mid August I‚Äôll focus most of my wear on the Onis, so I‚Äôll try to post an update with fading properties in the winter!  Thanks for reading my first in-depth review!  PS.  The shirt is a Naked and Famous Sashiko size Large ‚Äì my favourite shirt!"

rawdenim,3dr4ri,HarryGBoi,2,Sat Jul 18 18:00:11 2015 UTC,"You can ask Denimio to measure the specific pair before they send them out (or give them measurements of what you want in the pair and they can find one that closely matches). They used to take forever though, but I've heard they are a bit better at it now.   And as you mentioned, every pair will vary a bit. BiG is good to get an idea of how it'd but the pair can easily vary so if possible I always try and email to person selling the jeans and get specific measurements on the pair I'm looking for."

rawdenim,3dqukb,drivendreamer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:45:10 2015 UTC,"The denim itself is pretty light, comparable to my pair of 10oz from N&F. The blanket lining is pretty light as well so these guys had almost zero break in. They feel pretty light but because of the two layers they're quite thick, more so than my ub201s. This is actually only the second time I've worn them this summer since it was low if 10c high of 22c yesterday and we've had a surprisingly hot summer in central Canada.

Is this like OK to do? Or is it that when you come to the store you're expected to buy something then and there? I guess this is a silly question but I don't want to commit any kind of denim faux pas lol"
rawdenim,3dqumn,Danphillip,6,Sat Jul 18 18:48:15 2015 UTC,"I say just be upfront with them. If you are looking to make a big purchase there is nothing wrong with mulling your decision over for a few days. If you are nervous about just going in, then give them a call and let them know that you want to stop by. I am sure that they would offer you really good customer service regardless."
rawdenim,3dqumn,todayismyluckyday,3,Sat Jul 18 19:03:21 2015 UTC,"All retail stores should view potential clients coming to try on clothes and look at their stuff as a good investment of their time. As long as you're not one of those people who will go to stores just for shits and giggles and waste their time. Believe it or not, there are people out there who have no intention of purchasing anything but just like trying on clothes (I have no idea why they do this). Aside from that, allowing potential customers to try out their stuff is the main purpose of a brick and mortar store. They want you to have a good experience so that when you are ready to buy, you come back and purchase from them.  Also, I never understood some retailers who make it a point to try and intimidate potential customers from even going into their stores. I remember when I was younger the sales staff at places like Giorgio Armani and other ""high end"" retailers would look at me with this pretentious look, sizing me up as if I couldn't afford their clothing. It's like just because they work at one of those places, that they think they are better than you or something.  Anyway, I guess my point is that any retail store that is at least managed half competently should never try to make you feel like you're not welcome. Any article of clothing that you try on should be viewed as a potential sale and even though you're not looking to buy right at that moment, it doesn't mean that the time spent with you won't pay off at some point.  As a customer, you should be clear as to your intentions. If you're not buying now, then just be frank about it. Tell them you are shopping around and that once you find the right pair of pants (and get paid), you will pull the trigger."

rawdenim,3dqumn,Elf_Sedge,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:18:35 2015 UTC,"Just a more mild cleanse really, and it tightens the fabric up obviously. Sometimes a wash isn't really necessary, but I agree there's not too many benefits to a normal soak."
rawdenim,3dqumn,fitzghon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:06:44 2015 UTC,I hot soak when jeans are new because the goal isn't to wash out dirt but let the fabric shrink down to size and permit the structural stitching to set its tension. After that initial soak I only do washes. I have never understood the appeal of soaking when jeans need a wash.

I went ahead and bought them because I've been wanting jeans this color for a while, and that they're N&F for a decent price.  I know it was a bit of a gamble."
rawdenim,3dqumn,RawOwyn,2,Sat Jul 18 22:27:55 2015 UTC,"Personally I would soak/wash them anyways. Everything should have been washed from a thrift shop regardless, but I like to wash them myself just to be 100% sure. That would shrink them up slightly, but not as significantly as an unsanforized pair.  If you're going to have the top block altered I'd suggest sending them to railcar, using their downsize service. You'd have to email them to see if they had the right denim in stock."

rawdenim,3dqumn,cheddarvillains,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:23:52 2015 UTC,"I think first and foremost retiring jeans just means to stop wearing them as often. After that it's kind of up to you.

rawdenim,3dqumn,Buckhum,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:24:38 2015 UTC,"When people retire a jeans, it's usually hung up on the wall (or even framed). Some people with really beautiful fades trade it back to the brand owner stores for a fresh new pair.   There is also a small scene of people who buy worn in pair - most notably with APC. I once saw a pair of nicely worn APC go for $1000 on Ebay. Most usually fetch around $100-300."

rawdenim,3dqumn,Buckhum,2,Sun Jul 19 00:28:46 2015 UTC,"I have a rust weft pair and it is sexy as fuck.   Brown weft variations pair pretty well with boots of similar (but not the same) shades.   Indigo or black weft can be dressed up a bit more so that kinda points you towards the smart casual office look (or the goth / streetwear look).   As for other colored weft such as green, light blue, purple, or even rainbow, I think they are kinda hard to pair with anything other than sneakers but they do look super cool when the colors of the outfit mixed and matched well.   No pics cuz Im on mobile and it's hard to link stuff."
rawdenim,3dqumn,DE0XYRIBONUCLEICACID,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:30:58 2015 UTC,Do you prefer it to the classic white weft or would you say its a nice piece to have alongside
rawdenim,3dqumn,Buckhum,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:08:48 2015 UTC,"I think your first pair should either be a white weft or an indigo/black weft. These will be the most versatile (assuming you plan to cuff your jeans).  Anyways, here is a 5-color fade sample from Tenryo Denim in case you were wondering what the end results would look like."

rawdenim,3dqumn,rcsAlex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:16:40 2015 UTC,"If the pair you are buying is unsanforized, you need to account for the shrinkage when you buy them. Normally the site you buy them after will tell you how much they will shrink. It is tough to try on denim when it is unsanfoized."

rawdenim,3dqumn,Elf_Sedge,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:26:31 2015 UTC,The elephant models will fade the fastest. UB is essentially a subsidiary of N&F so the latter's pockets aren't great either.
rawdenim,3dqumn,Eggvillan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:30:36 2015 UTC,"So then, I might as well stick with the UBs as my first pair?

rawdenim,3dqumn,Elf_Sedge,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:37:13 2015 UTC,Either brand is solid for a first pair. I'd just do what you're thinking and see how it works out.
rawdenim,3dqumn,mr_grunts,0,Sun Jul 19 16:07:01 2015 UTC,What is a good heavyweight 20+ oz raw denim jean?  My only experience with raw denim are my $9 rigid Rustler's from K-Mart that I use for work.
rawdenim,3dqumn,RawOwyn,2,Sat Jul 18 21:15:03 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for a starter pair, Unbranded 21 oz will probably be your best bet. Super fast to fade, left hand twill, and not too uncomfortable during the break in.   Quality isn't going to be as great on them as high end brands, but again, theyre a good starter pair. N&F Elephant series would be a good place to look for a starter pair as well. Someone else might be able to chime in on the top tier brands; I don't have any experience with them."
rawdenim,3dqumn,Buckhum,2,Sat Jul 18 23:18:37 2015 UTC,I think he's best starting off with N&F E4 since thats at a reasonable price range ($100-150) and pretty much all top tier heavyweights are like $350+.
rawdenim,3dqumn,RawOwyn,2,Sat Jul 18 23:32:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I couldn't imagine spending that much on my first pair, but who knows. Always good to know all your options."
rawdenim,3dqumn,TheVirt,2,Sat Jul 18 23:38:47 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind is that the rise of the N&F and the Unbrandeds are infamously low. If you need a higher rise and you're willing to splurge, Iron Heart may be a good choice."

rawdenim,3dqumn,mr_grunts,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:26:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your suggestions.  I think I like the Unbranded 21 oz, it's not extremely expensive so I don't have to worry about ruining them at work.  I spend a lot of the day in attics and crawl spaces and that just tears them up."
rawdenim,3dpw17,FMA_Account,3,Sat Jul 18 08:01:44 2015 UTC,"If you need a belt before even the first wash, then the pair is probably too big. Normally I'd say you're golden with the first pair and that it'd stretch out a bit for comfort, but you bought a pair with some elastane in it, so it won't stretch out and break in as easily. If it really bothers you and you see it being an issue months down the line, I'd just invest in a new cut.  But just from what I see from the pictures, the first pair fits very well."
rawdenim,3dpw17,Coolguyzack,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:08:29 2015 UTC,thank you for your detailed answer. I was leaning toward the first pair. :)
rawdenim,3dpw17,IAMZWANEE,2,Sun Jul 19 19:08:30 2015 UTC,Kind of seems like a SG would be a better fit. It looks like there is a lot of excess fabric in the thighs in both fits.
rawdenim,3dpw17,footcreamfin,2,Sat Jul 18 14:59:50 2015 UTC,"you never want to have jeans where you can fit your entire arm down the waistband.. Unless loose baggy jeans is your style.

rawdenim,3dpw17,todayismyluckyday,2,Sat Jul 18 16:08:52 2015 UTC,"They will eventually stretch a bit, so if they are snug now, it should get better. If they are loose now, they will get worse.  Also, I know gf's mean well when they try to help pick put clothes, but unless they are really good with mens clothes in general, it's best to rely on your own gut feeling when it comes to clothes."
rawdenim,3douou,needuhLee,8,Sat Jul 18 01:09:32 2015 UTC,"If you are talking about the secret denim by ONI, it is an extreme example. Their secret denim is almost too loosely woven that they have to use thick fabric (20oz) otherwise the thing will fall apart even more quickly. You can see broken beige threads woven into that fabric, and some very active ppl on Sufu wear through their secret denim in less than half a year. Other ONI models do not seem to have this problem, e.g. their XX and Natural Indigo models. I also think the secret denim models are intentially dyed lighter so that the jeans can fade fast enough before they disintegrate, and their Japanese retail reflect the expectation of their longevity too."
rawdenim,3douou,AlpineSensation,3,Sat Jul 18 02:14:07 2015 UTC,"Okay, thanks for the info. I wasn't thinking of getting the secret denim, it's a bit too extreme for me. Good to know that slubby fabrics in general don't rip easily because I really like how they fade."

rawdenim,3douou,Buckhum,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:46:00 2015 UTC,Can you chime in on the texture of the kabuki fabric? From looking at the weft in the pictures it looks quite uniform compared to most Oni models.

rawdenim,3douou,ajchen,6,Sat Jul 18 01:59:48 2015 UTC,"Fabric development is still a bit out of my league. In general I have seen that looser weaves are more prone to abrasion damage.  Something like the small yarn, tight weave, heavy weight Cone fabrics can take an real beating (say, rubbing against a bicycle saddle for ~8 miles a day for example). There are many variables here though, getting into the radically technical things like cotton variety, staple fiber length, dye acidity, spinning tension of the yarns, how that relates to yarn thickness, yarn treatment pre-weave, how this interacts with loom tension.  As a general rule I'd say slack weaves are less durable, but being tight weave doesn't necessarily mean the weave was well designed considering the above factors.  To the best of my knowledge chatter itself, and other fun things like slub and nep won't cause the weakness.  They are more likely in the looser weave designs.  Perhaps Kyle from The Flathead can chime in (I don't know his handle).  Andrew from 3Sixteen as well.  I just hemmed some 3Sixteen indigoxindigo jeans that punched well above their weight for fabric strength, pretty nice stuff."
rawdenim,3douou,Pegthaniel,2,Sat Jul 18 05:32:42 2015 UTC,"I think this as well as /u/single-needle's post sum it up perfectly. In theory low tension weaves would be weaker but in practical, real-life examples (i.e. seeing hundreds of worn-in jeans pass through the shop every year) I haven't noticed any specific trend of low tension denim wearing out faster. There are many other factors to consider to be able to paint a broad stroke on this (with my limited knowledge, at least)."

rawdenim,3douou,single-needle,3,Sat Jul 18 14:31:06 2015 UTC,"General rule is the looser the weave the easier it is for the fabric to tear. Loom chatter in practice is looser tension and by that rationale is not as tightly woven but in my experience not necessarily true that it tears more easily. That also does not mean that the tensile strength is weaker.   In short, I personally do not feel that it affects durability, fabric weight and yarn size are better determining factors of ease of tearing. Unfortunately clothing companies do not give out that info.   There's my 2 cents."
rawdenim,3douou,Elf_Sedge,2,Sat Jul 18 02:14:23 2015 UTC,"fabric weight and yarn size   Among top japanese brands like Eternal, PBJ, etc. does this tend to be a  problem? Or is it  mostly with lower end brands?"
rawdenim,3douou,jonboy1987,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:18:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's across the board be it high end, premium, middle level, or mass market low end. If the fabric is too light and the yarn is too fine it's going to wear down very quickly.   I have a roll of cone 11.5 Oz stretch that I love but it wears down so quick.

I'm a true 32 waist but I wear a size 30 for my NF Left hand Twill, would that mean that I should order a 30 in the elephant as well? Does a thicker fabric mean I should maybe go with a 31 instead?"

That's basically a pork/beef sausage with a specific blend of spices, served with good mustard and bread. I think technically it's a german thing, but Romania kind of came along and said ""This, and the shawarma, are going to be our street-food staples.""  Also, sarmale with mamaliga and sour cream. That's more of a dinner-on-the-holidays type meal, but it is so good. And I could probably eat it every day."

It's crazy I've been basically doing the job for a couple of years anyway, but the titles just weren't a thing. We've gone through a massive restructure and now things are becoming official. I'm a little scared of having 16 direct reports though, it's a lot of people to manage. This is the first restructuring of the team and its looong overdue so I'm pretty excited to see how it all turns out.   In other news my parents are semi retiring, but can't quite afford it, so they're cashing out on their home equity to have some cash and continuing to work for a few more years. To make this work out for them, my brother and I are buying them a condo to live in. They'll pay us rent, which is about $1500 less than what they're paying for mortgage etc.. And we'll own the place. Kind of weird, not taking care of my parents per-se but definitely helping to make things easier. Also going to be a landlord technically so there's that.  Last GD I posted in I was pretty worried about my pooch, turns out he likely does have arthritis. Not a big deal, we've got him on some pills and they seem to be helping, he's limping a lot less than he was. Also some painkillers to help out on the bad days.  Finally, I'm a couple weeks away from vacation - I haven't had more than 2 days off work since last July and it's starting to drag on me. I'm super pumped to get away for a while."

My ear is always for the rhythm section since I'm a drummer so songs like Money Jungle, Very special and A little Max stick out to me.

I think a stronger stance on hate subreddits and harassment can steer reddit back in that direction.  Keeping the dialogue positive and respectful has always been at the front of my mind, and I am so happy that we have such a friendly group of people here, as well as for my fellow moderators who work hard to respond quickly to reports. Strict moderation policies also work wonders in subs like /r/askhistorians.  The post you linked to was my favorite question from the thread. I think it gets to the root of the issue: will the admins move forward to restrict subreddits with abhorrent content? I know it gets dicey when you try to figure out what crosses the line, and writing and enforcing policies like that for such a huge site will be difficult. Still, I would find it hard to object to fewer racists and nazis haunting reddit's halls."

I haven't been able to talk about it with anyone until now; but I've realized that at some point I'm going to have to let go. I can't really do that unless I stop keeping it inside. My friends have started to notice my strange behavior, so tonight is probably gonna be the night I down a few shots for courage and tell them. Posting this will help to start to get it off my chest. Thank you, members of r/rawdenim, for tolerating this, and me. If you've got any insight or experience with loss and how to cope with it I'd love to hear it."

rawdenim,3dkzhg,KingOCarrotFlowers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:48:55 2015 UTC,"I feel like sometimes I have a hard time talking about some things, too, because saying it out loud will make it more real, especially since it's coming from me.  Sometimes when I have something that I feel like I need to say, but I don't feel like letting other people in on it, I'll just talk to myself out loud about it when I'm alone. Or I'll talk to my cat. It helps me know how I feel about it, and it makes it so that when the time comes to talk to others, I know what I think and how I feel, instead of just being lost for words."

rawdenim,3dkzhg,baked_salmon,3,Fri Jul 17 10:26:42 2015 UTC,Where do you guys keep your phones in your raws? I just got a pair of IH 8301s's and I'm thinking of putting my phone in my back pocket instead of the front to achieve maximum whiskerage. Are there any drawbacks to this? Will it be uncomfortable when I sit down or ride my bike? Does anyone know of a good keychain for someone with two filled back pockets?
rawdenim,3dkzhg,Robocob0,6,Fri Jul 17 03:06:58 2015 UTC,I usually keep mine in my back pocket while I'm standing or not in my pockets. For one I'm not keen to pocket fades and back pockets are easier to access for me.

I‚Äôm the kind of person that overthinks everything. And when I say everything I mean everything, Whether it‚Äôs the weird look my coworker gave me today, the tone my boss had, how I‚Äôm going to manage to have enough time to study for this class, or the whispering I partially over heard between two random people, it doesn‚Äôt matter, I will put (what seems to me at least) a completely unnecessary amount of time into thinking about it. Some of the time it has to do with people I interact with, girls or just friends I talk to, but it really does apply to anything and everything. The thing is that even though I realize I‚Äôm overthinking things I can‚Äôt stop myself from doing it, which just tends to make me more agitated and think about things even more.

rawdenim,3dkzhg,KingOCarrotFlowers,7,Fri Jul 17 03:27:23 2015 UTC,"Happens to me, too.   Regarding friendships, the opposite sex, and little interactions with people--you have to train yourself to understand intuitively that you don't have the full story. I handled this the wrong way for most of my life. I let my emotional health depend on what I thought people thought of me based on my interactions with them, and that is bad. Do not let your happiness depend on anything that you don't control.  In fact, I'm going to repeat that, because it's probably the most important thing that I ever learned in my entire life, and I am not making light of that. So.  DO NOT LET YOUR HAPPINESS DEPEND ON ANYTHING THAT YOU DON'T CONTROL  One thing that you do control is how much you care about something--and you're just going to have to learn to let some things go. When you find yourself getting anxious or worried over something, stop, take a few breaths, and let it go. Do this consciously. Meditate, if you can. In fact, make meditation something that you do regularly. Look into mindful meditation techniques--like what Krishna teaches to Arjun in the Bhagavad Gita.  In addition, it's okay to make guesses about what someone intended, but it's always better to assume the very best of everyone, unless they have given you a powerfully compelling reason not to make that assumption. Assuming the best of the people around you, and throwing away the unspoken accusations related to the things they say or do will make you a better person. It will also make you more friends. People like being thought well of, and it shows when you think well of others.  With respect to career and other aspirations, use your overactive mind. Use it a lot. Plan for everything major in your life that you're capable of planning. Decide what career you'd be happiest in, and make all of your decisions in school and in jobs while working through college based on your career of choice. I didn't really even give myself much of an option, career-wise, and I kind of regret that. I love my job, but when I made the decision to pursue a degree in electrical / computer engineering, I made my decision for the worst reasons (I was Mormon at the time, and it had been drilled into my head time and time again that I would need to be able to provide for a family, including a stay-at-home wife--so my choice in career was heavily influenced by whether or not my yet-to-be-met wife would have to work or not). It works out for me because I actually like what I ended up with, but it could have been very bad, and honestly I still wonder what I'd have ended up doing with my life if my primary question in choosing a career wasn't ""Can I raise a family, including a stay-at-home spouse, on my income from this profession?""  To sum up: Be nice, know when and how to stop caring, only let things you control control your emotions, and plan the important bits of your life that you're capable of planning (this also means you can't plan your relationships out--you start down that road, and it's a hop skip and a jump to being a manipulative sociopath)."

rawdenim,3dkzhg,turkdwl,3,Fri Jul 17 04:45:21 2015 UTC,"Echoing what ryanxedge said, I'm really glad I read that. Thank you.   Thinking about    it's always better to assume the very best of everyone   although I do agree to an extent and aim to live that way, what bothers me is I feel like that goes against our internal survival mechanisms. Go back however many thousands of years, and being wary is an integral part of judging a potential threat in another human or animal. It's easy to argue that we should still, today, live with that in mind. I don't like that, but there's certainly an argument for it. What's your take on that?"
rawdenim,3dkzhg,KingOCarrotFlowers,3,Fri Jul 17 04:49:26 2015 UTC,"There's a hidden caveat in my statement, and it's that you still have to let a friendship develop. You can't just rush to the part where you're good friends.   I'd say that your disposition and your attitude should reflect that you think the best of everyone you meet, but you need to rely on empirical evidence to ensure that you aren't taken advantage of.   For instance, let's say I'm sitting at a bar, and the girl sitting next to me starts a conversation. And let's say that, as it turns out, this stranger and I have a lot in common. We have a good conversation for an hour or two over a couple of beers. At the end of this meet-cute, the girl confides in me that she's in a bit of an uncomfortable situation, and she needs me to pee in a cup for her so she can pass a drug test, since she smoked a bowl the other day and is getting tested tomorrow. At this point, I don't know her nearly well enough to do that kind of a favor for her. I have no idea what she's going to use the pee for--it might be her creepy roommate's fetish, for all I know. I politely but firmly tell her that she seems like a great girl and a good friend, but I'm not comfortable doing that kind of a favor for her after having known her for just a few hours. I tell her that I hope she understands.  If she's a decent person who respects others' boundaries, she'll probably understand. It won't hurt your blossoming friendship that you didn't pee in a cup for her, because you communicated clearly that you're just not comfortable with it.  If she's not as great a person as you initially thought, she might flip out, or keep pressuring you to do it. This would be empirical evidence that she might not be the kind of person you'd want to spend a lot of time with."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,turkdwl,2,Fri Jul 17 05:16:36 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, I didn't realize that you were basing that on the assumption that there was some basic history you had with the person. I see what you're saying. In that case, I'm on board with that mindset. Thanks for taking the time to explain.  You seem like you have some sort of psychology/sociology background. Funny you mention studying EE/CompE. I'm headed in that direction and also fearing I chose it for the right reasons."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,kthoag,2,Fri Jul 17 06:13:14 2015 UTC,Good example dude.
rawdenim,3dkzhg,superish64,2,Fri Jul 17 22:09:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I think one of the major things is realizing what is and isn't in my control. For most of the things i think about they aren't in my control, but i still think about them. I need to work on that."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,KingOCarrotFlowers,2,Fri Jul 17 05:20:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, dwelling on things that you can't control isn't healthy.   That was my dating life between the ages of 16 and 22. I obsessed over the tiniest things related to girls I was interested in or actively pursuing. As it turns out, that's not a great way to develop feelings for a person, because you develop feelings for the image of that person that you've created in your mind, and not for the person herself.  It's been years since I stopped doing that, and it's still very difficult for me to develop feelings for anyone that last longer than a week or two. Though part of that is also due to the fact that from a very young age, I was conditioned to view sex as the end goal of a relationship, and I'm still trying very hard to break the piece of my mind that still thinks that."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,superish64,2,Fri Jul 17 05:27:18 2015 UTC,I find myself mad at the person for not living up to image that I've created of them in my mind and it ends with me being disappointed in myself for creating the image in first place. I think it all goes back to what you can an can't control though.
rawdenim,3dkzhg,KingOCarrotFlowers,2,Fri Jul 17 05:35:41 2015 UTC,"Yup, I've felt those feelings before. It's hard. And it sucks.  What's worse by far, though, is messing up a relationship before it even has the chance to get started because of that image, and then over the next few months seeing a friend of a friend not mess it up, and realizing that the girl was different than, and also much better than the image you created, and it's too late because now she's married to the guy."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,superish64,2,Fri Jul 17 05:45:20 2015 UTC,That's like all my past relationships in a nutshell
rawdenim,3dkzhg,ryanxedge,2,Fri Jul 17 14:58:09 2015 UTC,"I think most people, American males in particular, are generally conditioned that way. It kind of sucks but it's the way it is."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,2capp,5,Sat Jul 18 03:13:32 2015 UTC,"Therapy.  This is not a OMG YOU NEED HELP or GET COMMITTED YOU WEIRDO suggestion.  I am honestly suggesting to you that you look into finding a licensed professional to talk to.  I did a few years ago since I have some social anxiety and relational issues along with what is likely a depression and it helped quite a bit.  Being that I professionally over-think things I understand how it can wreck your life.  I talked it out and ended up with some tools that help me sort things out when I'm not feeling quite right.  I don't know what those tools will be for you.  Personally I just have to sit there and work it out until I come to a conclusion.  Sometimes this takes a few seconds, sometimes I turn it over in my mind for a few days.  Giving in to the fact I'm not going to let it go and forcing myself to be objective about a thing helps me get the perspective I need to understand why I feel the way I do about a thing.  Maybe that will work for you, maybe it won't.  Go find yourself someone you feel comfortable talking with and find out.  Alternatively INTERNET PANTS FRIENDS are here for you.  Talk it out bruh, we got you.  Also feel free to PM me if you like.  I can't promise quick responses but I would try my best to be thoughtful."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,ryanxedge,3,Fri Jul 17 04:12:02 2015 UTC,"Yep. Doesn't necessarily have to be a therapist either. If you have a close friend or family member you'd feel comfortable talking with, that can help too. But a therapist might be the best bet because they are neutral in all things related to you and your life, so it's very easy to be open about things with them and get objective, outside opinions/suggestions, as well as professional advice on self-help techniques that you can employ yourself when necessary."

rawdenim,3dkzhg,wolfyb_,3,Fri Jul 17 05:46:58 2015 UTC,You wrote my internal monologue.
rawdenim,3dkzhg,ryanxedge,3,Fri Jul 17 04:45:12 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like you have generalized anxiety. I do too. It's hard to explain to just about anybody who doesn't struggle with any mental health issues, but I can relate man.  It really is burdensome overthinking every little thing in life. It's definitely the worst with girls, school, and work related things, but I'm with you that it happens with seemingly petty, insignificant things like what two people are whispering about. Are they talking about me? I know they probably aren't, but it's those thoughts that really eat away at me throughout the day.  I'm probably preaching to the choir since I suck at taking care of myself most of the time, but distracting yourself is definitely the best thing you can try and do. I've tried therapy and it hasn't really worked super great for me, but I'm considering going back soon. Exercise is my number one outlet, and getting out in nature is about the most therapeutic thing I can do that stops my head from racing.   Feel free to PM me if you wanna talk more about things."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,superish64,3,Fri Jul 17 03:38:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I might take you up on that sometime.   As I've taken more classes I've noticed more signs and symptoms, but I really don't want to go try and treat it with anything other than self help. It seems worse because I don't think it should qualify as something that should be as much as a problem as it is. I don't know, I just need to find that thing that will distract me enough"
rawdenim,3dkzhg,ryanxedge,3,Fri Jul 17 03:51:35 2015 UTC,"I've definitely noticed more signs and symptoms too in the past year or so as I've gotten into the last year of my undergraduate degree and dealing with some pretty serious girl issues. I think major stressors like those in life have severe effects on people with anxiety and other mental health issues.   The only thing I've found that distracts me enough is trail running. And unfortunately I hurt my knee a little over a year ago training up for my first ultramarathon, so not having that as an outlet has been really tough. If you can find an outlet though that works for you, that's obviously the ideal route to go.  I think talking to a therapist about things could prove really helpful if you ever felt like going that route. You don't necessarily have to try medication. I've read studies that claim that therapy is as effective as low-dose medication, so it's something to consider.  But yeah seriously man feel free to PM me anytime you want. I'm always up to talk. Don't overthink it."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,gravyfish,3,Fri Jul 17 04:01:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think it should qualify as something that should be as much as a problem as it is.   You're the only person who can decide how much it's affecting your life, but I can say that's what I told myself for a long time before I sought professional help. I never had much luck with medicine, but seeing a therapist has helped me so much with my anxiety. I have worked on developing healthy strategies to manage and cope with the anxiety, and I can't tell you how much it has helped.   Sometimes, you definitely just have to steer yourself in the right direction. I found it helpful, when I first started working on it, to write down or at least consider the ways in which my anxiety was affecting my life. You might ry making a list too, at least to help put it into focus.   Good luck with everything. We're always here if you need to talk."

rawdenim,3dkzhg,btharveyku08,2,Fri Jul 17 05:04:13 2015 UTC,"First tattoo session is in the books. My only stance I'd I have to wait another almost for weeks for the next session, but it's already almost fully healed!   In raw-related topics, I'm using every day at or below 85 degrees to work on finally breaking in my pair of SEXIHXLSXA13. While I wish they had a bit higher of a rise, everything else is pretty perfect. I've got a decent cuff and some great stacks, and I'm really looking forward to wearing them even more.  I also have one pair of MTOs that I'm just assuming will never end up getting finished. They quoted me a max of six weeks, but have surpassed that by more than a month at this point. Luckily, I haven't had to actually put any money into the order yet, but I was actually really excited about this pair. :/"
rawdenim,3dkzhg,clt3,2,Fri Jul 17 03:49:55 2015 UTC,Planning to go on a cut after I get back from my study tour. My belly is getting a little too big. I plan on eating chicken and sweet potatoes for a while. Anybody else have experiences cutting or is on a cut or plans to cut?
rawdenim,3dkzhg,PLKnight,2,Fri Jul 17 04:03:02 2015 UTC,"Just got off an international conference call. One of our clients broke their app and asked us to help test while they roll back. My PM organizes a bridge call to involve our team, the client, a third party developer, and the client's backend team, spanning who knows how many timezones. Then he doesn't get on the call himself leaving me to try and coordinate this rollback on a project I'm barely acquainted with. Luckily the rollback went fine and fixed the issue, but christ that's being put on the spot. Don't know what I would have done if the rollback didn't work.  In other news, and as I touched on in my last gen disc post, looks like I'm moving to New Jersey in the near future. Anyone here from the Red Bank or Matawan area?"
rawdenim,3dkzhg,KourageWolf,2,Fri Jul 17 04:18:31 2015 UTC,Working at the state fair isnt so bad. Its pretty slow but i hate standing right on top of heat for 6+ hours is not the beezzneeeez.   Also my interview at macys went pretty well yesterday. I really hope i get the job so i can have a job to wear my raws lol.
rawdenim,3dkzhg,ryanxedge,3,Fri Jul 17 04:19:25 2015 UTC,"Got back from my southwest trip Tuesday night. Colorado, Utah, and Arizona were great, but it sucks how quickly my overall good mood drops back to not-so-great after only being home for a few days. I want nothing more than to see my ex and at the same time I want nothing more than to stop wanting to see her, too. Haven't talked to her in about a month again, though, so I guess that's progress. Conflicting emotions on the matter are just really draining. Fortunately, I'm heading up north to the cabin this Saturday for a week, so it will be nice to get away again and just relax with my family, kayak, and fish!  Also, got a 3sixteen heavyweight indigo pocket tee yesterday. This thing is awesome and fits so well. I need every color."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,SuperCoolEGangster,3,Fri Jul 17 03:01:07 2015 UTC,"It's hard, but you should remind yourself that seeing her provides absolutely nothing positive for your life. You will come out of this a stronger and better person.  And yes, that is a very nice t-shirt. I hope it doesnt bleed everywhere."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,ryanxedge,2,Fri Jul 17 03:03:59 2015 UTC,"I know I will, it's just a matter of pushing through these dumb emotions to get to that point.  & yeah, the shirt is incredible. I'm a bit hesitant to wear it with anything over it for a while too in fear of it bleeding haha."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,jugglemank,3,Fri Jul 17 03:10:41 2015 UTC,Loving your pics. Forget about the girl.
rawdenim,3dkzhg,ryanxedge,3,Fri Jul 17 03:57:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. I'm trying my best to.   How were the Grand Tetons? I've never been to that part of Wyoming, but the area looks pretty gorgeous."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,jugglemank,3,Fri Jul 17 04:02:49 2015 UTC,"Incredible! The Delta Lake hike was pretty grueling near the end, but the view and icy cold water was worth it. Saw some great friends, ate great food, and looked at some gorgeous natural scenery. Highly recommended."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,ryanxedge,2,Fri Jul 17 04:16:10 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping to road trip out to Washington/Oregon next summer, or potentially even later this winter once I graduate...even though doing that sort of trip while everything is snow covered wouldn't allow for much outdoor activity... But when I do drive back out that way, I'm definitely making a detour to the Tetons.  You back in Logan now or still in Wyoming?"
rawdenim,3dkzhg,jugglemank,2,Fri Jul 17 04:20:50 2015 UTC,Back to Logan. Thinking about doing something in southern Utah this weekend. Any recommendations?
rawdenim,3dkzhg,ryanxedge,3,Fri Jul 17 04:27:35 2015 UTC,"Dude, just about everywhere I went over the past few weeks I'd recommend. I'd say take your pick of just about any of the big 5 national parks down there and roll with it.  Arches/Canyonlands/Moab area is really great. Probably the easiest to conquer and see the most in a short amount of time. Can see just about everything by driving/stopping at viewpoints/doing very short hikes in those parks.  If you go the SW part of the state and do Zion/Bryce, I'd recommend probably 5-7 days to really get your money's worth out of visiting those two parks. Or do what I did and beat the hell out of your body hiking them in a full day each."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,jugglemank,2,Fri Jul 17 04:30:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, been thinking about checking out the Arches area. Only about 5 hours away, I think."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,KingOCarrotFlowers,3,Fri Jul 17 05:14:26 2015 UTC,"Moab, and Zion's National Park."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,IAMZWANEE,2,Fri Jul 17 04:32:10 2015 UTC,"fits so well   They fit great now, but they shrink like a mofo after a wash, even if you hang dry."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,ryanxedge,2,Fri Jul 17 04:04:16 2015 UTC,really? man. well I guess we'll see what happens to it after a cold wash / hang dry after a couple of wears.
rawdenim,3dkzhg,IAMZWANEE,2,Fri Jul 17 04:05:46 2015 UTC,It might be different for you. I'm just a little sour because I ended up paying >$100 (two pack + shipping + Cdn exchange rate) and the fit became uncomfortable after the first wash.
rawdenim,3dkzhg,ryanxedge,2,Fri Jul 17 04:10:51 2015 UTC,That sucks. I can see why you'd be irritated. Were yours indigo dyed or one of the other standard colors?
rawdenim,3dkzhg,IAMZWANEE,2,Fri Jul 17 04:12:52 2015 UTC,Indigo. I've just stuck to wearing the one primarily and have washed it about 5 or 6 times now. It's starting to have a worn-in look which is what I like most about it.
rawdenim,3dkzhg,ryanxedge,2,Fri Jul 17 04:20:06 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm looking forward to that worn in look.  I heard the non-indigo ones don't shrink as much in the wash and are also a little bigger to begin with due to the nature of the indigo dying process. So that might be something for you to consider at some point if you felt like gambling with it again.
rawdenim,3dkzhg,IAMZWANEE,2,Fri Jul 17 04:21:53 2015 UTC,"I think I'm just gonna stay away from 100% cotton shirts all together. I got a few of the circular knit tees from N&F, which are a cotton/polyester blend, and they are a perfect fit."
rawdenim,3dkzhg,ryanxedge,2,Fri Jul 17 04:27:12 2015 UTC,understandable. whatever works best for you!
rawdenim,3dkzhg,fortunefades,2,Fri Jul 17 04:39:59 2015 UTC,"Trying to move out to Colorado within the next year, place made me feel so alive. I actually had a phone interview for a job in Denver on Wednesday, afterward the lady says ""okay I'm gonna go ahead and move you on to the second round, can you get to denver by Friday morning?"" I fucking wish - no way I could afford to get there by this morning on such short notice, and pay for a hotel/cab, etc., but apparently I'll be added to the next round if/when they do them..."

I used to love them so much as they were my first pair of raw denim but I can't even look back...
rawdenim,3dkzhg,hanger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:20:49 2015 UTC,Finally got that cylinder head repaired. A local shop drilled it out and put a helicoil in for 130. I'd call that a win...

rawdenim,3dj0wt,go_lobos,3,Thu Jul 16 18:01:00 2015 UTC,Those fades are ridiculous. How old are they?
rawdenim,3dj0wt,Oatmeall11,6,Thu Jul 16 18:01:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you! This is my pair I started last October for the ultimate battle for glory fades contest.  That makes them ~9 months old, with 3 washes."

rawdenim,3dj0wt,LetoTheTyrant,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:57:26 2015 UTC,Awesome dude that looks like an amazing time. How do you decide what's worth bringing? I'd probably think bringing coffee gear up there would be so worth it but then regret it in the end.
rawdenim,3dj0wt,Peipeipei,3,Thu Jul 16 19:06:30 2015 UTC,"It was about 28 pounds of gear for both me and my gf.  Basically you need a tent, a sleeping bag, a stove, some extra clothes, a sleeping mat, something to light fire with, a water filter, and food. Everthing else is more or less luxury.  We lucked out, because our friend who has back packed extensively showed us what to do.  As a coffee fanatic, I was bummed I couldnt bring a hand grinder, fresh beans, and a french press, but after hiking for that long I'm glad I didn't have the extra weight. Plus everything you pack in, you pack out, so all your wet coffee grounds have to go back in your pack."
rawdenim,3dj0wt,TomCatty,5,Thu Jul 16 19:22:01 2015 UTC,"I'm a firm believer of pack in pack out, but couldn't coffee grounds be beneficially (like compost or such) scattered around sparingly?  Also you could lay them out in the sun to dry them and store them in a ziploc or something, but yeah I wouldn't want the extra weight either"
rawdenim,3dj0wt,cache4gold,2,Thu Jul 16 23:51:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't see why coffee beans would be bad. Essentially it's cooked and ground beans that had hot water run through them. Especially like TomCatty is saying with just burning them. It'd be pretty harmless it seems.
rawdenim,3dj0wt,akmetal,2,Fri Jul 17 06:27:22 2015 UTC,"The only concern I would have is attracting animals if you were camping in bear country.  Not necessarily a problem where I was at, but fragrant food in, say Alaska, would be problematic with all the grizzlies about."
rawdenim,3dj0wt,Arizon_Dread,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:17:07 2015 UTC,"I would burn mine if I could, but you normally couldn't sun dry them since you aren't in one place long enough. But for that early morning buzz, I think could be worth the weight."
rawdenim,3dj0wt,ConvertsToMetric,2,Fri Jul 17 01:03:11 2015 UTC,"I had to survive off of Starbucks Via.  Not really that great, but it got me through the morning, and weighed close to nothing."

rawdenim,3dj0wt,zbaile1074,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:32:57 2015 UTC,"bold man. every time i hike in my raws its super fatiguing, probably because they're a bit too slim in the top block."
rawdenim,3dj0wt,Zultan009,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:30:41 2015 UTC,"Fades are looking great! How long did you go before the first wash? What was it like to go hiking in that kind of shoes? I reckon my heels would be completely destroyed, I get bursitis or similar too easily."
rawdenim,3dj0wt,Ramachandrann,2,Thu Jul 16 21:22:34 2015 UTC,"I probably went 2 months before the first wash. Took a 50 mile bike ride out to a brewery during late November, and they got a wash after that.   The shoes were great until about the last mile.  Then my feet started hurting and I wanted something with more padding.  Before that, it was glorious! It's like walking baflrefoot on the trails; you can feel all the texture under you, but don't have to worry about cutting up your feet."

Post-wash, not too much different but a little bit of it was accumulated dust.  I'm excited to post them!"
rawdenim,3dj9g1,wolfyb_,2,Fri Jul 17 03:43:10 2015 UTC,These are about a year old but I only wear them 5-6 times a month. Here are the fades so far.  Spot on the left leg is toothpaste!   Think I cold soaked these twice with woolite black.

rawdenim,3dimuw,berwyn_urine,4,Thu Jul 16 16:07:00 2015 UTC,"I think that it looks really nice in the fit pics and I personally like the fact that it has slash pockets on the front. If the sizing works out for you, I say go for it."
rawdenim,3dimuw,ochong,5,Thu Jul 16 16:11:22 2015 UTC,Ordered.  Their return policy is very friendly so worth a try.
rawdenim,3dimuw,berwyn_urine,3,Thu Jul 16 18:57:58 2015 UTC,Good stuff! You should post some feedback of it when it comes in. I'm sure others in the sub would love to hear your thoughts. Hope that it works well for you!

rawdenim,3dimuw,fontin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:57:01 2015 UTC,"Cultizm.com has some pairs, although not close to all of them. In my opinion it's probably a better choice to go with another brand such as Nudies or Apc, since it gets a bit cheaper."
rawdenim,3dimuw,Josh_F_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:11:51 2015 UTC,"I recently got a few new jeans and I was wondering whether or not they are raw denim. They feel a lot rougher than the other jeans i got but I'm not sure, and all of them feel and look very similar. Could you help me find out? Here are the pics, Jeans 1, Jeans 2, Jeans 3 (the last pairhad a weird label in the middle of the inside of the butt, that said raw but I'm not sure it's reliable). Any and all help is appreciated!"
rawdenim,3dimuw,magalingpo,3,Thu Jul 16 16:04:04 2015 UTC,"I see selvage on both jeans 2 and 3 so it would be a pretty safe bet to assume they are raw.  Jean #1 is this? which would mean yes they are raw denim as well.  edit: I see selvage on all 3, all are most likely raw."
rawdenim,3dimuw,youngofthesoonest,5,Thu Jul 16 16:10:51 2015 UTC,selvedge does not equal raw. raw does not equal selvedge. plenty of these brands will have washed selvedge denim but these do look like if anything they're minimally washed.
rawdenim,3dimuw,magalingpo,3,Thu Jul 16 16:25:14 2015 UTC,"I know, hence ""most likely"".   Jean #2 is a collaboration between gpxgap so I'm not 100% sure those are raw.    Jean #1 im pretty confident those are the 1969 Japanese selvage hence they are raw.   Not enough details on Jean #3 but looks raw to me.   edit: Jean #1 is not the Japanese selvedge but is instead the ""resin wash"" So yes I believe you are right. Those have been treated. But I believe will still fade much like the ""rigid"" levis."
rawdenim,3dimuw,Josh_F_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:30:25 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! These are my first pairs of raw denim so I am really anxious to get into the scene. Do you have any general tips or should i just check the wiki/ FAQ?
rawdenim,3dimuw,magalingpo,2,Thu Jul 16 16:28:31 2015 UTC,"Reading the wiki wouldn't hurt.   But honestly, just wear them like normal jeans.  Wash whenever they get dirty/smelly/funky.   As for washing, make sure to use a gentle spin if using a machine and don't use a dryer. Washing by hand most people recommend woolite dark but anything without bleach will do the trick.   Have fun!"
rawdenim,3dimuw,Josh_F_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:38:56 2015 UTC,Thanks again! Also i think the jeans in the first picture might be this? but I don't know what the product means...
rawdenim,3dimuw,magalingpo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:42:51 2015 UTC,"Hmn if that is indeed the case then those have been treated.  No worries though, they will still fade."
rawdenim,3dimuw,youngofthesoonest,2,Thu Jul 16 16:50:09 2015 UTC,"From the looks of it, if they're not raw, they might just be rinsed. The last two were the GQ collaborations where gap ""partnered"" with other brands to make limited edition models. The last one is a baldwin one which I believe is raw. Even if not raw, if it's dark and dyed with indigo, it'll fade and age to a certain extent."

rawdenim,3dimuw,btharveyku08,3,Thu Jul 16 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"What size of paychecks are we talking about (or rather, since that description is vague, what price range are you considering)? 2. And how much higher of a rise would you want? 3. If you're talking about wearing ""for this coming semester"", does that suggest you're in the market for a heavier weight?    If we're simply throwing out suggestions, PBJ can be had from Denimio at awesome prices.

The Oni fabric is awesome. Yeah it's not as 'formal' as regular (vs irregular) fabrics, but it's definitely wearable on a day to day basis. The samurai's will fade much better, as they're generally more starchy and just seem to shed indigo.  I'd just see what fits work for you and go from there."

What is everyone's go-to (reasonably priced) colored t-shirt?  I've tried AA, Next Level, Alternative Apparel, and a handful of other brands, but nothing quite beats the price point and overall fit like the (old) Mossimo t-shirts.

rawdenim,3dimuw,StrongRage,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:35:00 2015 UTC,"How much does Oni Denim stretch?   Specifically, I'm considering the 517 from Denimio. Their size charts say that a OW 28 has a 28"" waist. That would likely fit me fine right from the start, and I know they'll probably stretch less if they're not tight on me to begin with, but I'm still worried they'll stretch back closer to the raw measurement (29.5""). Any insights?"
rawdenim,3dimuw,Demilict,6,Thu Jul 16 19:49:30 2015 UTC,"I unfortunately made the mistake of listening to Elf_Sedge in the past... Nothing against his advice but apparently he likes his clothing super skinny/tight.  I went TTS with my 517, size 32 One Wash and they are the perfect fit. Note, this after I listened to Elf_Sedge when he told me to go with 28 because, as he just stated, they stretch a lot.  Oni stretches, more than my JBO-420 for sure, but it's nothing drastic that Elf_Sedge says. I'm wearing Oni's right now. Worst case scenario, size one down but I would just go TTS. Don't worry about the stretch b/c if it fits properly, you're not going to have drastic stretch. Maybe that's why Elf_Sedge experiences so much stretch..."

I've come to the conclusion that I stretch denim more than a lot of people here for some reason, but I always just post my experiences. If you know you do or do not stretch denim well then you can work that into your own calculations of which size to pick, because everyone stretches denim differently naturally. My ONI's shrunk a lot, stretched a lot, and were from a different lot; so you should take all advice with that information in mind.  FWIW, I sized UP on my oni purchase and still stretched out of them by a few inches"
rawdenim,3dimuw,StrongRage,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:20:12 2015 UTC,"Haha fair enough, thanks for the perspective.  My dilemma here is that there is no sizing down -- 28 is the smallest that Oni makes. So this is the chance I'm going to have to take if I want a pair of Onis..."

rawdenim,3dimuw,btharveyku08,2,Fri Jul 17 00:35:38 2015 UTC,This article lays it all out. It even discusses broken twill.
rawdenim,3dimuw,justforflan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:37:42 2015 UTC,Ah yes the misinformation link. Twill direction wouldn't make it any softer if they switched the yarn twist at the same time.
rawdenim,3dimuw,btharveyku08,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:16:06 2015 UTC,"Haha, right. I guess I still find it helpful for someone who doesn't even seem to know the basics of what twill even is, though. Kind of like how most of the science you're taught in grade school is actually filled with lies, designed for you to iron down core concepts.  EDIT: For clarification, /u/justforflan is referring to the misinformation that the article suggests RHT and LHT differ in that the thread used to weave the two is spun in opposite directions, and that this leads to the difference in the characteristics of the denim. This is inaccurate, given that, if the opposite-spin threads where used in opposite-handed twills, they would then fade largely the same way. It's the spin of the thread plus the handedness of the twill that can change the look and feel of resultant fades (RHT's z-twill plus s-twist of the thread makes tighter fabrics and more pronounced fading, while LHT's s-twill plus s-twist of the same base thread makes the less pronounced and fuzzy fades). The article does at least show examples of each type of twill. In retrospect, I should have probably just shown the pictures and then described it myself.  SECOND EDIT: Wow, there really isn't a whole lot of discussion on this topic when doing a Google search."
rawdenim,3dimuw,barkjon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:30:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know the real technical details on how the twill is different and how it is created, but I know that the pants will have leg twist in the opposite direction.

rawdenim,3dimuw,clt3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:06:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I heard it doesn't stretch out past raw measurements but I heard it can at least go back to raw?  So let's say if the waist started at 32 and shrinks down to a 30 and goes back to 32 it'll happen again in the next wash?
rawdenim,3dimuw,fitzghon,2,Fri Jul 17 04:13:18 2015 UTC,"Every unsanforized denim I've ever had shrinks back to close to it's ""post-soak"" sizing after each wash. I normally wash in cold water but soak most jeans in hot water for the initial soak.

rawdenim,3dimuw,clt3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:30:14 2015 UTC,Is yours the 3XXX denim? Well I'd actually rather just give my jeans an initial wash so does that mean it'll just be a little smaller than raw measurements?

I recall from other forums that heavy denim feels painful at first, but I haven't messed with N&F sizing before, so we'll see.  Worst comes to worst, that's what the free return policy is for, haha."
rawdenim,3dimuw,Thingus995,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:19:00 2015 UTC,"My own paranoia is getting the best of me I believe... Got a pair of 3sixteen Kibata as a gift from my GF, shopped at SELA and got a ton of help...  Here's where my concern comes in, I believe I got the right size, but I'm not 100% sure that the water I soaked them in was hot enough to shrink them completely... I understand they are a different cut and fabric than my other pair (UB 201). The straight leg Kibatas are bound to feel looser, however there's a little more wiggle room in the waist and hips than the UB I've been wearing which probably causes the 3sixteen to give the illusion of looseness on me... I can pull them down but not off without a belt, and with a belt they fit comfortably but not snug.   Would a second soak be detrimental in any way? I'm tempted to do another just to ensure I get them shrunk to the max, I'm ok with the fit as it is now, my concern is getting them settled in at the right size now (I've only worn them once) before I get creases set and fades begin."
rawdenim,3dimuw,Buckhum,2,Fri Jul 17 18:13:00 2015 UTC,No. With most unsanforized you need 2 soaks to really get full shrinkage.
rawdenim,3dimuw,clt3,2,Fri Jul 17 19:02:37 2015 UTC,Agitation would also help in getting it all out.
rawdenim,3dimuw,tokie__wan_kenobi,2,Fri Jul 17 23:56:11 2015 UTC,"I sometimes do a hot soak in the tub with agitation, then throw them in the washer (hot, delicate, no spin) to get all the shrink out. Agitation is the most important to shrinking. So yes, soaking or washing a couple times initially is fine, even if you let them dry after the first soak or wash."
rawdenim,3dimuw,Thingus995,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:01:58 2015 UTC,"Let them dry and wore them twice once all day, a second time for a few hours... My initial concern was starch and indigo loss, but after the first soak, they didn't appear to lose any indigo, or enough starch to make a difference... Currently soaking in hotter water and I've swished em around a bit in the tub... About halfway through another half hour soak at the moment, thanks everyone!"

rawdenim,3dimuw,Buckhum,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:12:40 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming that the official Nudie website measurement is not informative enough for you since it doesn't show thighs or leg opening.

rawdenim,3diq46,tarpishere,4,Thu Jul 16 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"That's like perfect. If you like them looser, then just wear them a bit and they should stretch out with time. I just picked up a denim jacket with the same Rinse material from Jcrew for $35!  Can you comment on the denim quality?"
rawdenim,3diq46,todayismyluckyday,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:33:12 2015 UTC,"thanks! these are my first venture into the selvedge world so it is hard for me to comment on the quality. the material is quite thick, feels rather stiff (much stiffer than a typical pair of levi's for example), and has an overall high-quality appearance."

rawdenim,3diq46,go_lobos,5,Thu Jul 16 23:43:39 2015 UTC,I like the fit although I certainly gravitate toward slimmer fitting jeans.
rawdenim,3diq46,btharveyku08,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:04:39 2015 UTC,"I am on the fence about this fit, especially through the thigh and knees. I have larger thighs so I usually have to go too large on the waist which eventually results in saggyness. I went with closer to my true waist size for these and am curious what you think about the overall fit. Sorry about the crappy photos."
rawdenim,3diq46,btharveyku08,3,Thu Jul 16 16:27:13 2015 UTC,"It really just depends on what kind of fit you want. Plenty here would say that fit looks really good, I personally like more room than that, but really, the first things you should ask yourself are ""how easy are they to button up"" and ""do you have enough room in the thighs"". Answers to both of those questions will provide us with the best input for whether these will work for you.  You said you sized more for the waist, so are the thighs tight?"
rawdenim,3diq46,parallax1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:44:51 2015 UTC,"the buttons got a lot easier after taking these on and off several time. the thighs are still pretty tight and i wonder how much this type of material will stretch. i guess in the end its still cotton, so should i expect a similar amount of stretch as ""regular"" non-selvedge jeans?"
rawdenim,3diq46,MrMofoness,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:36:25 2015 UTC,"Well, being unfamiliar with these jeans or where their fabric comes from, I can't say for sure regarding the stretch other than the thigh tends to stretch the least in pairs. How long have you had them? A rule of thumb for stretch is that the closer you get to two week's worth of wear, the closer you are to the max that the denim will stretch on your body."

rawdenim,3dgoi4,youngofthesoonest,17,Thu Jul 16 05:55:52 2015 UTC,"Alright, so in rough chronological order:  The Phantom Menace   During late winter 2015, after a production rate of about 1 jacket a month and a plethora of excuses for the delays, the well dried up and no jackets were received for like a month or two. There were issues with daypacks and wallet orders as well. Drew Keith just straight up go missing / stop responding. Charlie and Dan, the other 2 core members of TOJ quits. They weren't paid after like a year of work. People thought that after 3.5 years of solid satisfaction, they finally got Bernie Madoff'd. (Thinking back, the modus operandi were almost exactly the same - exclusive club, great ROI, charismatic leader).   Attack of the Clones   Around April-May, people freak the fuck out over in Styleforum and started calling the Libertine restaurant which Drew has a stake in. Libertine issues a statement saying they aren't in on this leather jacket shitstorm and will buy out Drew's stake so please stop calling them. Styleforum True Detectives keep on increasing the pressure. Some members try to organize mass action lawsuits; others try to hunt down a store called ""Moon leather"" after one member got his jacket shipped from there. This lead to a dead-end.   Revenge of the Sith   Drew finally responds by threatening anyone who raises their voice to move their order to the back of the line! He also lied that Paypal (or was it debt collector?) contacted his dad in the USA over some payment disputes.  Somehow Drew then got his SF account banned and instead of contacting Fok the head Mod, he makes an alternate account to post shit. He said he's depressed as fuck and considered killing himself because of this whole fiasco.  The consensus is that if everyone successfully file a dispute and chargeback his ponzi scheme is over!!! It seems like Drew had a trillion unread emails in his TOJ gmail. That, combined with a lack of organized order database, meant that it was almost impossible for him to sort this shit out on his own.   A New Hope   People in SF got fed up with the lack of information and made a simple list of Username and Order Cost to see how much jacket money Drew owes people. Based on this new list and another old excel document of existing orders that was made in 2014, Drew owes about 400 jackets - which amounts to $250,000 (give or take a few $10k) In June, thanks to valient effort by Dieworkwear and a few others, Drew finally relented and created an excel spreadsheet for you to fill out your order information.  Since then, about 25 jackets have been made and shipped to customers.  There was one shipping mistake but overall things have been going smoothly. Drew has been quiet for the past 10 days or so. Hopefully things won't head back down to the darkness again."
rawdenim,3dgoi4,Buckhum,5,Thu Jul 16 14:27:51 2015 UTC,This was awesome. Going forward all explanations of any kind should follow this format.
rawdenim,3dgoi4,KingOCarrotFlowers,3,Thu Jul 16 15:53:32 2015 UTC,"If the Star Wars timeline holds true, something bad will happen in The Empire Strikes Back (like another 3 months of no jackets and constant uproar) and we will be saved in Return of the Jedi when Charlie or someone else personally go to Drew and sort this shit out for good.  After most orders are fulfilled and people's memory of the pain and anguish slowly fade away, Drew will rise again with another devious project.

Once you cross those thresholds, Paypal will most likely close your dispute case right away (unless you're in the UK which I believe have more lenient time limits)"

rawdenim,3dgoi4,Raaaaaaaaaandy,2,Thu Jul 16 15:19:10 2015 UTC,The former worker (Khala) said in that thread that they were basically just focusing on jeans and after that would switch to tops. And since people are still waiting for their custom jeans and will continue to do so... you should probably do a chargeback.

Redirected my life (I was going to move to Portland to work with another small Kickstart brand) but as Sal said, Roman was damn convincing and offered me relocation money. Was seriously underpaid and sometimes not paid at all but all in good effort to try and get your jeans out. I was originally brought on to do marketing but was sent to the cutting table. I feel bad as I knew the math didn't work out. Cutting 10-15 pairs a day due to the lack of proper website and ordering  structure everything was a mess. I wanted to get your jeans out as much as everyone else and it often fell on my shoulders. Roman eventually put cameras on me and would sit upstairs and watch me cut every pair not realizing it was the lack of organization from him and the rest of the team that fucked production in the first place. But we all need to learn lessons. Now I know a ton about denim production but I'm stuck in AZ with no money serving tables now. I apologize for not saying anything sooner as I really respect you guys but as Sal said, we all had our jobs to do and didn't really know much. I know I always thought Roman just had extra money floating around to keep us going until paydays got pushed and weeks would go by with no money."

rawdenim,3dgoi4,devastitis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:42:12 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, Gustin does not offer refunds or exchanges? That's a total deal breaker for me.   I can't understand how this business model will be sustainable in the long term. As a person who does a TON of Internet shopping, I have to say that I keep roughly 25% (or less) of the items I purchase online. Since I can't try it on in store, I order several sizes of the same item and  return all except the ones that fit perfectly. If i don't like a color, or how a fabric feels/drapes on my body, I return it. Hell, I return items because I forgot I even ordered it in the firdt place and now don't want them anymore.  I can understand wanting to save a buck by crowd funding, but what good does saving $50 do if you get a pair that doesn't fit right and can't return it? What if you lost/gained weight between the time you ordered them and delivery? Weather changed from cold to 95 degrees, but you ordered a pair of 22 oz denim? The Sell/Trade threads are filled with brand new Gustin denim.   It just seems like a silly fad to me. At some point people will wise up and realize that there is value added from having a brick and mortar store to go to. [END RANT]"
rawdenim,3dgoi4,mrsolitonwave,2,Thu Jul 16 14:26:15 2015 UTC,"Wrong. I ordered a pair of skinny fit Gustin's because I wanted to see if the skinny fit would work for me. When they came in I realized they were too tight for me. I emailed them and they let me return them for either a full refund or a different pair that they had on hand, in slim fit. I chose the different pair and they showed up a week later."
rawdenim,3dgoi4,bzr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:34:08 2015 UTC,"By ""full refund"", you mean store credit right? I thought it was their policy not to offer refunds back to your CC."

If you have any questions don't hesitate to email us.

rawdenim,3dgoi4,SepSe7en,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:34:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I read that too. I think store credit is cool, but I would like the option of a full refund. Someone had made a suggestion that gustin should offer some sort of commission or referral fee to small boutique retailers to carry sample fits of their jeans to allow people to try them on. Every jean they ""sell"" will earn them a bonus and the customer can see how their sizing works.  I like that idea, seems like a win win for everyone. I'm sure the cost of the jeans may go up a little, but it's worth it in my opinion."
rawdenim,3dgoi4,59snomeld,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:43:03 2015 UTC,"My problem with store credit lies in the fact that if Gustin doesn't have anything in their inventory in your size and style ready to ship, you need to wait an additional few months (on top of the original months of waiting) for the new campaign to ship. Your money is on loan to Gustin interest free for at least 3-4 months. This is especially problematic if the original reason for the return was a QC issue or damage to the jean upon delivery. The customer should not be held accountable for that.  A full refund due to a defect should be standard practice rather than by request only."

rawdenim,3dgqz6,blaewen,5,Thu Jul 16 20:53:01 2015 UTC,"My first pair of denim! I finally got them in!!  Did I do it right? They were sooooo hard to button the first time. After wearing them for a few minutes though, I was able to button/unbutton all by myself. Should the zipper be so tough? I feel like it needs graphite or WD-40 or something.   Also, the length. I am short. These things are LONG. All the advice I saw said to hem after the first wash, to get the right length after shrinking. I don't think I can go the next six months with pants that are like 5"" too long. I can't even cuff them while wearing them OR tuck them over high heels. What do I do?"
rawdenim,3dgqz6,dn0c,10,Thu Jul 16 03:44:56 2015 UTC,"The length shrinking up happens in unsanforized denim and these are sanforized, so they should shrink minimally with a wash. Maybe give yourself a half-inch of leeway just in case, but you can get them hemmed as soon as you want. Railcar will do this for free, by the way!

rawdenim,3ddtp3,cchhaazz,7,Wed Jul 15 14:20:28 2015 UTC,"I ordered these one size up because I liked the measurements better, and wanted a little more room to move for the purpose of working in them. Therefore the waist was a bit too big, hence the hot soak. So, I received the jeans, tried them on, they were a little too roomy, so I threw them in the hot soak and air dried them, and here they are a day later, and I'd been wearing them for a few hours before the photos. I had a great ordering experience from Okayama Denim, despite the shipping being delayed a little because of their 15% off sale. Got them in four days from Japan, which still baffles me. I live in an age where packages can travel across the entire earth in just days."

rawdenim,3de82z,Buckhum,4,Wed Jul 15 16:09:23 2015 UTC,"So I bought myself an issue of Clutch Magazine while wandering around the mall. After flipping through the first few pages, I ran into Fullcount's advertisement: ""Make your own jeans"" it says.  Hmm.... strange, I don't recall Fullcount doing MTM or bespoke denim.   Then I turned the page and the realization hit me. Ah of course, it's the quintessential rawdenim mythos! We (raw)denimheads make our own jeans in the sense that we wear them and craft our patterns and stories into the jeans.   Thus, I cannot help but admire and embrace how Fullcount's latest ad campaign reflects our common value through the intertwined fading of  the texts and of the jeans."
rawdenim,3de82z,clt3,3,Wed Jul 15 16:13:18 2015 UTC,I think Clutch actually had an event in Yokohama and it wsd their slogan there. I think it was when rawrdenim covered their show. They had a brief description of Full Count's offerings.
rawdenim,3dimqo,Buckhum,17,Thu Jul 16 15:59:35 2015 UTC,This is seam allowance not a flaw.
rawdenim,3dimqo,single-needle,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:14:30 2015 UTC,"I see, that explains the 'hairs'. What about this singular loose thread? Does that also come from the folded-over part of the pocket?  It's not troubling me or anything but it just seemed like the thread came out of nowhere since the areas beside it look clean."
rawdenim,3dimqo,single-needle,3,Thu Jul 16 16:33:32 2015 UTC,Also part of the seam allowance. Difference is that this larger yarn you see is part of warp (lengthwise) and indigo based. The weft (horizontal) yarns are white more like your other photo.
rawdenim,3dimqo,MrMofoness,0,Thu Jul 16 18:11:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification.
rawdenim,3dimqo,youngofthesoonest,2,Thu Jul 16 18:20:02 2015 UTC,"I have the same thing on my momos. I haven't experienced this on any of my other jeans, but I cut some of the excess strands with no issue."
rawdenim,3dimqo,delphic_star,6,Thu Jul 16 23:44:35 2015 UTC,Most back pockets except for the ones that are lined will have the exposed raw edges on the inside. This does seem to look like it's shedding a little more than others but I think that might be part of the property of the denim since from the pictures it looks like it's a coarser looser weave with thicker yarns.
rawdenim,3dimqo,mcadamsandwich,6,Thu Jul 16 16:19:42 2015 UTC,even my Iron Hearts have this goin on in the lined back pockets
rawdenim,3dimqo,Ramachandrann,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:55:58 2015 UTC,This. My Gustin Loomstates are half-lined and have these loose threads.
rawdenim,3dimqo,wolfyb_,0,Thu Jul 16 19:26:57 2015 UTC,Ah you're absolutely right. The pocket 'hairs' are also present on my other jeans.
rawdenim,3dimqo,freemeth,7,Thu Jul 16 16:30:23 2015 UTC,"On a side note, that PBJxPronto pair is super cool."
rawdenim,3dimqo,digglebaum,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:28:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, word.  I was wondering how long it'd be until /u/Buckhum  put these up.  They'll look super rad in a bit.  Especially this time of year."
rawdenim,3dimqo,freemeth,-2,Fri Jul 17 01:50:32 2015 UTC,"So after I took out my wallet, I noticed a somewhat long thread poking out of the back right pocket. It's the second time this has happened and while the first time it was just a small thread that can be pulled off, this one is a bit too big and I'm afraid that forcing it out by hand would damage parts of the pocket.  During the process of cutting it off, I also found that the inside of the pocket has quite a few loose threads Pic and decided to give it a much needed surgery.  While I'm sure these are negligible in terms of the jeans' durability, I just wished that the jeans were more meticulously constructed considering this particular pair of PBJ costs about $300.  Perhaps this messy quality is just a matter of PBJ dealing with the first run of their 18oz denim?"
rawdenim,3dimqo,digglebaum,-10,Thu Jul 16 16:06:58 2015 UTC,"The non-meticulous nature of PBJ is one it's best selling points. If you wanted to spend $300 on ""perfect"" jeans you should have done a little more research. Wabi-sabi dawg."

rawdenim,3dewjq,justforflan,3,Thu Jul 16 04:42:59 2015 UTC,To taper the outseam: 1. take out the hem 2. turn pants inside out and sew a straight stitch down the pins. 3. trim and overlock if you don't want excess fabric (optional) 4. re-do the hem  To taper the inseam: 0. un-do the hem 1. take out the outseam 2. take out the topstitching for the inseam. 3. take out the flat felled seam if there is one (labor intensive) 4. sew a straight stitch down the pins. 5. overlock an trim (usually one step) the inseam 6. topstitch down the inseam 7. sew the straight stitch on the outseam back up 8. do the hem.
rawdenim,3dewjq,Nareshiyengar,2,Thu Jul 16 06:36:57 2015 UTC,"Hmmm interesting, thanks!"
rawdenim,3dewjq,Buckhum,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:43:58 2015 UTC,"Not quite. Flip your jeans inside out and you'll notice that the selvedge side of your jeans is single stitched. Meanwhile, the inseam is either overlocked or flat felled. To top it off, many alteration places don't / cannot alter flat felled seams (I only know Railcar off the top of my head).  Check out some good explanations via the comments in this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/24jb88/rawr_denim_overlock_stitch_vs_flatfelled_seam/    Note: the rawrdenim article is super generic and doesn't give much info."

Edit: Corter also makes a 1.5"" wide belt that appears to be a reddish color. Not sure which of the options it translates to (maybe Latigo?)."

rawdenim,3dewjq,thernkworks,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:01:42 2015 UTC,"I'd love some suggestions on what brand of jeans to buy next. Looking for something under $200. I've previously bought Levi's 501s (32/34, too big) APC New Standards (30 waist, fit really well), and Tellason Ladbroke Groves (30 waist, fit really well except the crotch was too small).  But the real reason I'm asking for opinions is that I have weird blowout problems. Instead of getting the crotch blowout that most people seem to have, all of my jeans get butt blowouts - after about a  year, they start to fray right below both of the back pockets. I can try to reinforce them but it just delays the inevitable. So: are there any jeans with better butt protection? Is there something I'm doing wrong that makes my jeans always blow out in the same way?"

rawdenim,3dewjq,Buckhum,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:36:00 2015 UTC,You should email Denimio to have them measure a pair for you disphol@denimio.com and then compare the sizing with this chart by RGT: http://www.rogueterritory.com/shop/stanton/  This will take a modicum of effort but it will give the most accurate measurements since I doubt people who own Rgt will own an Oni 562 (BlueinGreen doesn't even carry it).

As well as jeans they carry shirts, Ts and jackets, some select boots and belts and wallets from Kawatako including their awesome Blade belts.

I probably stretched them out as much as they can. I'm sure if you hot soaked the waist band it would shrink to a 32.5/33. I'll do full measurements since I should list them anyway. I'll message you tonight when I do. I also would bet that the hips are small enough where the waist wouldn't be an issue. The denim is really stiff and would probably not fall down anyway, but I understand the need for proper measurements."

Make reasonable offer. Brand new, have only been tried on and worn around the house for an hour at most. No soaks, no washes, no heavy creasing. Light creasing you'll see in pics is just due to being very heavy denim and worn once. Jean's have been hand repaired (hand-darned). When I first got them, the very bottom button hole was completely closed and needed to be opened. While opening the button hole I accidentally sliced through the front layer of the fly (the flap that covers the button fly). The repair isn't bad, but it's a non-professional hand-darn. If you wanted, the hand-darning could be un-done and professionally repaired. Pics: http://imgur.com/a/Hn32m Any offer will be entertained ;) Don't be afraid to ask.

rawdenim,3de6zv,kirapiggy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:22:14 2015 UTC,What was the comment?
rawdenim,3de6zv,cheddarvillains,2,Wed Jul 15 19:17:50 2015 UTC,I'm guessing he bought them on one of those unauthorized sales intending to flip them
rawdenim,3de6zv,cracklynuts,2,Wed Jul 15 19:29:40 2015 UTC,There have been a few sellers on Grailed with multiple pairs of new 3sixteens for sale. You can see the Club Monaco tag in the pictures of this seller. He probably bought the entire remaining stock at his local CM for  ~$90 each so he could flip them.
rawdenim,3de6zv,DE0XYRIBONUCLEICACID,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:20:15 2015 UTC,Think they mentioned $60 in a previous post. Now I can't ever feel good buying these for anything close to retail :(
rawdenim,3de6zv,cheddarvillains,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:09:50 2015 UTC,"Well, just don't buy when the seller is obviously holding onto some sort of stock he shouldn't have. I buy my stuff secondhand in like-new condition all the time. Usually these are honest people who didn't size right and are trying to get a little money back so they can get another pair for themselves. I assume that they buy from legitimate sources, so the original retailer/brand would have gotten their rightful payment by then."
rawdenim,3de6zv,todayismyluckyday,3,Wed Jul 15 21:49:48 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't the original brand have gotten their money for these already? Especially if they were purchased through Club Monaco.  I mean, it's not like CM stole the jeans from 3Sixteen and sold them, right?  So 3Sixteen got their money...it's just people who weren't able to purchase the jeans during the sale that should be upset.  I can totally understand the anger behind that.  I feel the same way when some dick scalper buys all the good tickets to a concert at face value, then turns them around and tries to sell them to me for 4 times the price, fuck those guys.  But yeah, it's silly to think that 3Sixteen didn't get paid for these jeans.  If so, they should be suing CM."
rawdenim,3de6zv,tokie__wan_kenobi,2,Wed Jul 15 21:57:08 2015 UTC,"I can understand a local buyer being upset, but isn't this user bringing a discount to a new audience that wasn't privy to it before? Is that a bad thing? And it's not like this user bought all the stock at full retail price and now extorting the market and selling for like $400 a pair, like in your example with the tickets. If the rules say this thread is strictly for second hand resale, then I get the downvotes, but I don't get the hate for taking advantage of a sale, bringing it to a larger market and making a small margin for themselves for the trouble."
rawdenim,3de6zv,todayismyluckyday,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:24:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah its a bit of a grey area. I don't dislike it, as you said, he's bringing savings to people who wouldn't otherwise be able to get them. But then again he is doing exactly what a scalper would do because he apparently bought these for $60 and now he's selling them for $130. So yes, he is marking them up for a profit.  Also yes, according to people in other threads, he did in fact buy out like the entire stock of a store. This is like the 3rd ""Buy Sell trade""thread that ive seen these in.  Again, I don't have a gripe with him, he saw an opportunity, made an investment and is now trying to make a return on it. It's the American way. But fuck scalpers."
rawdenim,3de6zv,cheddarvillains,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:46:05 2015 UTC,"You're right, 3Sixteen has been paid already. They're against having their products go on (unauthorized) sale, even though sales means that it's another retailer taking the loss. Lots of our denim brands believe the same sort of thing, so it comes down to us as their consumers, as well as their retailers, to respect their wishes. It's exactly like the scalper analogy you brought up ‚Äî¬†nobody likes it, but some people will still go for it and the guy ends up making money he shouldn't have made."

rawdenim,3dbvbf,thespiderghosts,6,Wed Jul 15 01:43:01 2015 UTC,"I saw these on Denimio a little while ago and they seemed pretty good so I got curious.  I posted in the daily questions but nobody seemed to know much about them.  I decided to go for it anyway because the measurements looked like exaclty what I wanted.  Fabric: Slubby fabric. Pretty dark. Slightly hairy. Redline selvedge. Very good but nothing unusual like PBJ or TSG but I wasn't looking for that anyway.  Construction: Really really good for the price. Raised belt loops. Top of the backpockets is raised like the belt loops. No loose threads or stitches anywhere. Hidden rivets.  Fit: I have a hard time finding waist sizes small enough for me that also are still wearable in the thighs.  I got a 29 and did a warm wash to get the shrink out. I probably could have sized up one and done a hot wash. Thighs fit great now. Waist was a bit tight, but I got the top button done after about 10 minutes.  Downsides: Back pockets are really small/narrow. I can't get my whole hand in them.  Let me know if you have any questions. There's not much info out there about these."
rawdenim,3dbvbf,dmkbatman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:44:18 2015 UTC,How accurate is the sizing chart on denimio? I'm seriously considering snagging a pair of these now.
rawdenim,3dbvbf,needuhLee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:13:35 2015 UTC,"Pretty good I think. I didn't take any measurements to compare though, sorry. Make sure to read their stuff about 360 vs Flat measurements.  However, I think the one wash waist is wrong. It matches the raw waist and it was way less than 29"" after it shrunk. Ok though because my real waist is 27""."

rawdenim,3dbntf,aldenhg,2,Wed Jul 15 01:48:06 2015 UTC,It's just the way the cloth was woven.
rawdenim,3dbntf,MutantCreature,2,Wed Jul 15 02:22:54 2015 UTC,so its not real selvedge? just a pattern that appears so?
rawdenim,3dbntf,d4mini0n,3,Wed Jul 15 02:30:57 2015 UTC,"Yup. To expand on what aldenhg said, selvedge just looks the way it does because the last few warp threads on either end of the loom are a different color, most often a bit of white then a red thread. What makes it ""selvedge"" is that the warp thread turns around and goes back the other way instead of just dangling off the edge like fringe. This shirt includes some white and red warp threads in the main body of the fabric to simulate the look of selvedge."

Of course you can go to Santorini and other more popular ones, but they'll be more crowded and more expensive as a result.

rawdenim,3d8zbt,Hyp3rion_,3,Tue Jul 14 13:50:16 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say the same thing as I told OP.  Depending on how much ink has seeped into your jeans, you may want to repair it. If it's just an ink stain, then it's no biggie.  But if it's a dark spot that ink has welled up on then you might be in for a rude awakening when you eventually wash/soak your jeans.    I've had several jeans that had similar things happen inside the pockets from pens that have exploded or whatever.  I didn't know about the severity of the ink stain because it didn't show that much through the pocket lining.  But once I washed it, there was a HUGE ink stain from where it was diluted by the water and soap and it basically got onto everything.  I'd go with one of the suggestions above and darn it... If you don't want to go through the work of darning, then you can just cut out the affected area and patch it with whatever you have laying around.  It's cool if you want to be all wabi sabi about it.  For me, there is a clear line between wabi sabi and ruined pants that I would not want to wear anymore."

rawdenim,3d8zbt,Prophet6,2,Tue Jul 14 15:35:47 2015 UTC,"prologue Ok, so let me start with my experience level: I've done over a year with many washes on a pair of Levi raws, and I've done like 4 months on my second pair of Levi raws with no washes (but they've been disinfected with some stuff that lasts like 2 weeks). I own some super tough Iron Hearts, but I got fat and haven't really worn them.  actual comment: I'm pretty sure that the entire point of wearing raw denim is to tell your story on the canvas of denim, much like scars and (sometimes) tattoos. Every stain and rip is an experience, every imperfection is an experience.  I guess what I'm saying is: you shouldn't even have to ask this question. That ink spot is a reminder of that particular point in time, not a stain.  That's my reaction, for what it's worth.  edit: I'm working on the fat part, they are my prize (""they"" are the pants and jacket, both are the crazy heavy Iron Hearts)"

rawdenim,3d9lqc,Irenarch,15,Tue Jul 14 15:59:40 2015 UTC,"My sizing mishaps have been a real trial-and-error affair. When I decided to 'upgrade' from my first pair of Naked & Famous, I somehow managed to wind up measuring the waist wrong and was off by about 1"" (I think the issue was that I didn't have the front of the waistband parallel to the back, and forgot to multiply a half-inch by 2).  I bought a pair of 3sixteen ST-100xes that were about a size too small for me both in the waist and the thighs. The 'rule' I knew was 'if you can get the top button done up, they'll fit fine', but it turns out that I'm actually pretty good at contorting myself into a pair of pants. The thighs were uncomfortably tight and the rise was higher than I was used to (and if you hike up a pair of higher-rise pants, you're going to need more room in the waist for your belly - I'd already maxed out the stretch in the waist).  After angsting about that for ages and trying to convince myself they'd stretch out enough, I bought a pair of Japan Blue JB0401s, accounting for about 1"" of stretch in the waist when I sized them. I barely got 0.25"" out of them even after wetting the waistband and forcing them out, which wound up popping the top button off. They were so tight in the waist that my bowels were pretty unhappy, which I took as a sign from the Denim Gods that Shit Was Bad.  I wound up selling both of those pairs. There's a reason that whenever people ask questions about sizing and stretch, I make a point of stressing sizing for one's thighs and being 'snug but not uncomfortable/painful' in fit (as well as taking into account the stretch, or lack thereof, of certain fabrics). Learned that shit the hard way.  I also bought and returned a pair of RgT SKs (because I don't like tightness around my calves anymore, and because the details seemed a little underwhelming compared to 3sixteen or RFG) and a pair of Nudie Back 2 Black waxed Thin Finns (because waxed denim just looked kind of silly in my wardrobe), though both actually fit okay."

I guess that's why they say to establish your preferred styles before spending lots of money.  My first pair ever was the core indigo NF Weird Guys that never fade, and I sized down way too much for them (34 natural waist 12""+ thighs trying to squeeze in a 30), but I stopped squatting due to injury, lost a bunch of muscle weight, and now I'm 32 natural waist 11.25 thighs and they fit perfectly.

I bought them on sale for like $60 bucks and had no idea they would sparkle as much as they did.  There is another video that someone posted where you can see how it sparkles, but you can get a god idea from the pics as well.  Trust me, unless you're into having people tell you that your pants are glittering, you won't like them.

rawdenim,3d9lqc,Buckhum,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:23:35 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why I got them.  I had initially thought the ""copper twist"" meant having copper hardware/rivets, and a copperish colored weft.  Sadly, it only had the copper weft...   Once I got them in and saw the glitter, I immediately said ""nope"" and sent them right back.  Of course I had to take a few pics to post on /r/rawdenim before I packed them up."

Not at all to suggest anyone else wouldn't be able to, but it just sounds like it's not for me.  Good to know that N&F didn't completely setting and miss with that effort, though, as I like seeing how they continue to push the extremes."

rawdenim,3d9lqc,RawOwyn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:55:53 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much how I feel about my pair. I'll probably wear them exclusively for big events where having a bit of flair isn't a bad thing. Its just the rest of the time they'll sit in my closet, and I feel like having a pair of raw jeans to wear a few times a year isn't really worth it."
rawdenim,3d9lqc,kingsofbabylon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:09:00 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way, however, I'm considering distressing them on purpose, since I really don't care about them. A little tasteful sandpaper on a pair that'll just sit otherwise? Sure, why not."
rawdenim,3d9lqc,JonNYBlazinAzN,2,Wed Jul 15 00:22:14 2015 UTC,"Be careful with the sandpaper. Its really easy to take it from tasteful to overdone.

I'd say to try and wear them for as long as you can bare to set the creases in, then start from there, otherwise the creases & sandpaper fades will look a little wonky once real creases set in"

Got them years and years and years ago from Gilt or something. One of those sites. They're super tough to fade. When I hung them up there was some wallet fade, with some holes on the corners, and a little bit of lightening on the combs. That's it. I'm pretty sure they'd fall apart before they had any particularly dramatic color loss. :<"
rawdenim,3d9lqc,Demilict,4,Tue Jul 14 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"My only regret is that my starter pair wasn't a higher quality pair of jeans. I spent a little over a year fading a pair of raw stretch denim from WeSC. The whole raw denim hobby is so time-intensive that I wish I'd spent that time on a pair that was more worth it. In the end, the WeSC pair didn't fade as well as I wanted (I think mostly because it was stretch denim). If I could do it again, I would've went Unbranded or N&F for a starter pair."
rawdenim,3d9lqc,FreeCharlesManson,2,Tue Jul 14 17:18:25 2015 UTC,There's a first time for every thing. Try to see it in another way; your starter pair led you to better choices of jeans.
rawdenim,3d9lqc,thoughtrecord,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:53:33 2015 UTC,"My only advice for stretch denim is keep going. They take ages to fade and then one day you wake up and think 'shit, I've got sick fadez now'.  Good luck!"
rawdenim,3d9lqc,wangus9,3,Thu Jul 16 10:59:01 2015 UTC,"My buyer's remorse it mostly a product of my ability to find excuses not to try pairs on in person. I live a reasonable day trip away from SENY and BiG, but for whatever reason I rationalize buying things on sale online or through the secondary market, and when they inevitably end up not fitting I regret the purchase.   It probably took me ~4-5 pairs to figure out both what I like in a fit and what works on my body. I've tried 4 different Gustin fits/sizes (no biggie because there's very little risk in a ~$80-100 purchase that will sell for about as much, new), LFNYC, 3sixteen, and Momotaro, and 2 Japan blue cuts. I lost 30lbs in the middle there, so figuring out how my body changed was a huge trial and error process too. The only ones that still work on me are my JB0412s, which are about as ideal a fit on me as I think exists, and a pair of Albams a friend gave me a few years ago when i was first getting into denim.   But man, the necessity of a high back rise is a hard lesson to learn, and it's hard to find men's jeans that accomodate wide hips and more narrow waist.   Which is all to say I probably could have saved some money, but most definitely some aggravation, by sucking it up and trying a pair on in person."
rawdenim,3d9lqc,thoughtrecord,3,Tue Jul 14 19:17:18 2015 UTC,"When I look at how nice even my modest raw denim (Unbranded and Japan Blue) is, my biggest regret is all the shit I wore before and not getting into this sooner."

rawdenim,3d9lqc,clt3,2,Tue Jul 14 16:08:51 2015 UTC,"while i love my 3105s to death and will wear them until i physically can't, i realistically should have sized up one or even two. the thighs are tight to the point where i need to adjust my underwear and smooth out the pocketbags. plus, the friction generated by dragging my phone out of the pocket has created several holes in the denim, ripped the pocketbag, and created the ugliest phone fade of all time. it's not uncomfortable, mind. i'm not busting out of the seams or anything (there's adequate room in the seat+waist). it's just very snug and that isn't my preferred fit. squatting hasn't helped matters either...  i also had a pair of gustins that didn't fit, but i squeezed myself into them for some reason. i finally sold them after they had been in the closet for 6 months.   other than sizing issues i've been happy with what i've gotten. the gustins were way different from normal and something that i enjoyed for the uniqueness. the 3105s were a complete 180 and represented a desire to swing back to a traditional indigo pair.   i've been planning my next purchase for months, so when i finally pull the trigger i hope for no remorse. as long as i finally get sizing right, of course.   check back in a few years once i have bought more pairs i guess."

rawdenim,3d9lqc,madfos,2,Tue Jul 14 19:06:08 2015 UTC,"As the 3105s were a reaction to the Grey Silks, so to will the next pair be a reaction to the 3105s.   I'm looking to get something with crazy texture and possibly unique color (though indigo warp is likely a requirement). ONI Secret denim is the leading contender now."
rawdenim,3d9lqc,dn0c,2,Tue Jul 14 20:54:23 2015 UTC,"I bought my 3sixteens just recently, thinking that I would need two pairs to just rotate regularly, and that I could probably stay with those pairs for a while before I even buy anything again. Boy, was I wrong. I had felt like I gained too much fat and too little muscle at one point so I decided to restrict my caloric intake. I lost a lot of fat and muscle, and I sized my 3sixteens to be just a little bit bigger in the waist to account for bulking up again.  I actually ended up sizing perfectly for the waist, but then my thighs are growing at such an absurd rate that it feels way too restrictive now. At this point I want to sell my 100x's and just wear my 120x's until it gets way too tight for me in the thighs.   The thing is, I'm probably going to buy a pair of Flat Heads in Japan and I have no idea if I'm going to regret this decision again. Still have quite a bit of fat on my waist and I'm going on a leaner diet when I come back from my study tour. So I might be making another mistake again very, very soon.  By the way, if anyone has any idea how much you lose in the waistline after going on a leaner diet it would be really helpful.  Oh and I really want to buy a pair of Evisus in Japan. Just so I can get a pre-Warehouse Evisu but I already feel bad spending so much money. I'm probably going to regret this as well."

I'd recommend holding off on buying any more pairs until you stop gaining or losing weight."
rawdenim,3d9lqc,not_mandatory,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:51:18 2015 UTC,"It's cool. I won't be losing a lot. This pair is kinda tight and it should fit me better when I've lost some of the fat around my waistline. Also need bigger thighs too from lifting weights. Although there's a risk, it's pretty minimal I guess, and the benefit to it is much greater than not buying a pair."
rawdenim,3d9lqc,Zerimas,2,Wed Jul 15 13:44:20 2015 UTC,"I bought a used pair of UB101's off eBay and was pretty bummed that they had been not only washed, but had endured a spin cycle with some weird vertical fades and whatnot. I started wearing them hard (bicycling, skating, mowing), and they're actually starting to look pretty sweet and the vertical fades are blended more.  I also got kind of burned on a pair of N&F Broken Twills. Guy said they weren't hemmed, but were 32 inseam. I'm a 32 inseam so I was like, eh, whatever, I know they were hemmed but not going to argue about it. Get them. One leg's like a 31.25 inseam, the other is 32; not noticeable with boots, but sneakers I can tell. I contacted the seller and was reimbursed a percentage and got to keep the jeans; ended up paying only $20 total so I can't really complain I guess.   The only slight buyers remorse were those two used raw encounters, and I've made the best of both so I guess I'm not that remorseful anymore."

Now after the first wash they don't fit at all. I think it is some combination of shrinkage plus I gained a bunch of weight (stupid antipsychotics). I managed to get them on today, but they are skin tight in the thighs and my big fat ass is practically bursting out of them when I bend over.  Anyone wanna take them off my hands? They are in pretty good shape. There is a goofy phone fade, and a little bit of wear from where I cuffed them. I only got a couple of months wear out of them. :(  I also have a pair long staple cotton Weird Guys in size 27 (the true waist size is 30"") that I am also never going to be able to wear again. They have the start of some pretty sick fadez.   I am now reduced to wearing Gap selvage denim.

I picked up Uniqlo slim/straight as my first pair of raw/selvedge denim.  That's when I started reading more about it and visiting forums like /r/rawdenim.  Once I learned that Uniqlos are very difficult to fade, I spent a little more and picked up a pair of NF LHT.  I had no idea that I was supposed to size down on these and got them in my true waist size of 32.  They were HUGE.  The pant leg was comically big and I could fold over the extra material in the waist.  I had already gotten them hemmed and tried soaking them to see if I could get them to shrink to the right size.  No joy.  I got maybe .25 inch shrinkage and was pretty bummed.  I took them back to Bloomingdales to see if they would take them back, lo and behold, they did.  Not sure if they realized they were hemmed and had been soaked once, but I wasn't going to mention it.  They gave me store credit as I didn't have the tags for them, but I was still pretty stoked.  I managed to hunt down a pair of size 30 and they fit fabulously.  I also bought a pair of NF Copper Twist, but sent them back the say they arrived in the mail.  I'm not going to lie, I think those pants are horrendous.  There is absolutely no way I could ever work that into my wardrobe.  I've finally settled on a pair of 3Sixteen ST120x in size 31, and the same NF LHT.  I'm happy with my current rotation.

rawdenim,3d9lyn,AwesomeColor,2,Tue Jul 14 23:18:05 2015 UTC,"I'll see what I can pull up. I have fairly large thighs, so these fit me slimmer than they would fit most people. I'd say they have a fairly traditional fit for business casual in not being overly slim, but not being baggy either. From knee to calf they have a bit of taper but look straight-legged.  I wouldn't expect them to stretch very much. When I bought them, they were a little bit tight in the waist and maybe stretched a tiny bit.   Also, the indigo does fade. I've had them since early April and have worn them 1-2 times per week and I'm seeing a fair amount of indigo loss on the back belt loop and on the inseam by the crotch. I'm also seeing a tiny bit of indigo loss on the whiskers over where my phone rests in my front pocket. Part of me is happy that they're fading, but part of me is going to be upset when they're too faded for business casual and I can't wear them to work.  I would also note that they have a slightly slubby texture to them. It's hard to see at first since they're dyed such a deep indigo, but it's definitely there.  As you may be able to tell, they're my favorite non-denim pants I own."

rawdenim,3d9lyn,hoooch,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:54:42 2015 UTC,"They will still shrink after a cold wash, albeit probably not as much as a hot wash/ soak.  If you wear them in without soaking them first, then any fades you accumulate before their first wash will end up shifting after the wash.  You'll get some leg twist, which will rotate any comb fades around the side of your leg, etc."
rawdenim,3d9lyn,johnahoe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:55:57 2015 UTC,So soaking avoids leg twist (which is where the seam rotates)?
rawdenim,3d9lyn,hoooch,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:06:38 2015 UTC,"No, leg twist is unavoidable to some degree with most unsanforized jeans.  If they're so tight right now that they wouldn't fit after an initial soak, then they're probably a size too small."
rawdenim,3d9lyn,johnahoe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:10:05 2015 UTC,"They could shrink in the waist, but they're snug on the thighs."
rawdenim,3d9lyn,Elf_Sedge,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:46:27 2015 UTC,"They'd just shrink right back up when you wash them, so it's better to either resize or do a cold soak now (or after a bit of stretching time)"

rawdenim,3d9lyn,Elf_Sedge,3,Tue Jul 14 18:33:38 2015 UTC,"No. Washing sparingly has no ill effects on raw denim. If you wash incorrectly or too often, your fades may be affected. Otherwise it's all good and you'll probably get more contrast out of your fades."

My ideal size range is Baldwin Henley 34's (on the tight end) and Gustin Slim 36 (looser end). So I'd be looking at size 36 in PBJ raw? The waist shows as 37.75 so with a post soak we'd be looking at right around a 36 waist. Is this correct? Maybe? Thanks!  Edit: Now that I've thought about it some more, I think I've seen people say the waist will stretch back to original size?  So maybe I should be sizing down to the raw 34 that's listed at 36?  If it makes a difference I always wear a belt with my jeans...."
rawdenim,3d9lyn,HerroPhish,3,Tue Jul 14 17:16:52 2015 UTC,Check the thighs on the one wash measurements and measure that up with your favorite fitting pair. I would say that would be your best bet.

rawdenim,3d9lyn,dn0c,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:55:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, definitely size for the thighs if you can. The xx-012s are one of the slimmest cuts that PBJ makes, so it's better to have thighs that fit well and a slightly loose waist than a well-fitting waist and skin-tight thighs.  When in doubt, order 1 size higher than you think."

rawdenim,3d9lyn,todayismyluckyday,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:59:10 2015 UTC,My vote is the RgT or the 3sixteen. I feel like you see the 3sixteens a lot more in New York so the RgT is a little more novel. You really can't go wrong with any of them. Construction and detail is about the same.
rawdenim,3d9lyn,cricketahi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:15:56 2015 UTC,"I love my ST-120x.  They have very minimal stretch and the fabric is pretty crazy.  They look almost violet purple at first, but I have some high wear areas that are a light/sky blue.  I can't wait till I get more even coverage on  the fades.  As far as fit, it's pretty slim.  I'm a true 32, but went with the 3sixteen sizing and got a size 31....which was perfect.    I think the only thing I can criticize about these pants is the relatively low back rise.  If you aren't wearing an undershirt and you bend over, you're going to show plummer crack.  My fiance has gotten a couple good looks at my ass cheeks in the middle of the day. =l"
rawdenim,3d9lyn,Irenarch,0,Wed Jul 15 00:02:21 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to the Japan Blues but I would definitely go with the 120x over the stanton. Rogue territory has some awesome details but the fabric leaves a little to be desired, especially when it is compared to the 120x and I imagine something like Japan Blue. You should also check out the 120xk, which is the unsanforized version."
rawdenim,3d9lyn,louuster,4,Tue Jul 14 18:17:16 2015 UTC,"I'd either go with the JB0401 or the 120x, personally. The JB0401's literally $104 on Denimio, so if you're trying to save cash it's a no-brainer (make sure you size right, though - they'll hardly stretch at all). The 120x will probably fade in a more interesting way, though, since it's indigo/black."

I used to be a lot heavier, but that was before I started wearing raws. I started out with the 501STF, but decided to move toward something more high quality (and made with fair labor). Believe me man, it is tough when you can't get a nice pair of PBJs or Flat Heads because they either don't make them in your size, or the ones they do make in your size don't get past your thighs.   ¬†  Two pieces of advice:    Don't hold off on buying a pair of jeans that you really like. If you got the money, buy that pair, and even if you lose weight you can probably shrink those jeans with a hot soak or get them taken in at a tailor.  Keep looking!

I know one thing is for certain, you don't want to invest into too much spendy denim - being as it sounds like you're well on your way to cutting weight! Dropping from a size 42 to 38 is a damn good start, and I wish you the best of luck!

At that price you can't lose, can flip them later for no loss, and can possibly score a really nice fabric. My last grab bag was a pair of GreyXBlue, which usually go for around $120.  Gustin straights have been my go-to. Size up for their slim (cut is more like the N&F Weird Guy).  Yeah, I gave away my pair of Gap 1972. Thighs were way too tight."

I used to wear a size 36, but that was vanity sized in regular denim and more like a size 38. Now I think I'm about a size 40, but also in the process of trying to lose weight. I want to squeeze my ass into a pair of Momotaros. That's my Stimul right about now. Either that or some Rogue Territories since the sizing only goes up to 36.  I've had success with Naked & Famous. I like my cuts pretty slim, so I managed to squeeze into the Super Skinny guy, and it stretched in all of the right places. They kill my nuts though. The inseam is too short unfortunately. This seems to be a fairly common problem with N & F from what I've heard.  Nudie might also be able to accommodate you since they vanity size so it gives more freedom regarding choice of sizes.  I hear Japan Blue Denim has some slim tapers in size 38. I am hesitant to purchase another pair though, since I want to see how my weight loss goes, and how much my jean size changes in the process. I've seen some sick fades come out of this one though so might be worth it...  You could also buy a pair of unsanforized jeans, wear em, then soak em when you've lost some weight. They should shrink down some... if you don't feel like waiting.  Either way man keep up the good work. I am finally getting back into the gym myself. Looking forward to shedding some extra pounds."

rawdenim,3d9ya8,10minuteslate,7,Tue Jul 14 21:16:27 2015 UTC,"I may be your man on this one. I've spilled ketchup on two pairs of pants with different results.  After spilling on some Tellasons, I immediately wiped at the area with a paper towel, washed the jeans, then washed them again with some stain stuff sprayed on the area. In between, I wiped at the stain a couple more times. The result was an area that ended up lighter than the rest of the jeans due to indigo loss.  Fast forward; I spilled ketchup on another pair, Raleighs this time. Obviously I eat like a five year old. This time I followed some advice from googling and got the area wet, and dabbed at it with a cloth (better than a paper towel I would argue). Dab firmly, very firmly, but DON'T WIPE. This way a significant amount of ketchup comes off without the indigo loss that comes from vigorous wiping. You want as much of that sticky ketchup residue to come off just from sticking to the cloth. The result doing it this way was MUCH less noticeable. Good luck, I feel your pain brother."

rawdenim,3d4mfk,clt3,10,Mon Jul 13 14:20:08 2015 UTC,"Mostly the cut and the details. They are super slim cut but all the additions (ribbings, zippers, etc.) keep them from looking like you're just wearing (for a lack of better words) ""a pair of girl's jeans"". Overall I really like the silhouette they create and since I'm a big fan of high fashion stuff anyway it fits most of my wardrobe perfectly.  I was looking for a cheaper pair on sale and on eBay for a while but I just could not do any form of pre-faded or distressed denim, as I'm sure everyone here can understand :-)  Here's what I carry in my Momotaro, it's not just a gimmick but of course the effect is desired still: http://www.mrnatty.com/shop/pleasant-pucker-lip-salve"

rawdenim,3d51rs,sspencerz,4,Tue Jul 14 01:26:15 2015 UTC,I guess different fabrics act differently when used with a washing machine.  I threw in my pair of UB121s at around 5 months wear time and the jeans came out with random creases of fading on different areas.  I even skipped the spin cycle and pulled the jeans out immediately after rinse. Must be the specific fabric/dye on the UB121s
rawdenim,3d51rs,Portland1234,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:23:00 2015 UTC,"I'm interested to hear from more folks like yourself- As someone who worries about stuff like this to the point where I have to just say ""FUCK IT"" and act on whatever impulse I'm feeling (in this case machine washing pricey denim), a situation like yours is always in the back of my mind. I wonder what causes what you described..."
rawdenim,3d51rs,Bisclavret,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:45:36 2015 UTC,I think the type of washing machine plays an important role. HE/front loaders tend to use less agitation/spin/friction than older top loaders. They only time I ever got weird crease fades on denim was when I at a summer sublet and the only thing they had was a top loader
rawdenim,3d51rs,artimus41,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:37:46 2015 UTC,"I suppose that could be... The machine at my place is a top-load that's at least 10 years old, and not fancy or high-end by any stretch of the imagination. Hm."

rawdenim,3d51rs,sspencerz,2,Mon Jul 13 19:51:41 2015 UTC,"lol, holy shit."
rawdenim,3d51rs,Bisclavret,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:07:16 2015 UTC,Well here are the specifics of my instance.   I simply tossed the jeans in on regular wash and normal water levels.   Added in some tide detergent and let the machine do its job.   I listened to the machine and as it was draining the rinse water I pulled the jeans out. And when the jeans finally hang dried I noticed some irregularly faded creases on the top block and the back of my calf.   If I had to guess I would think that it's because the UB121 fabrics are simply known for their fast fades and because the center spiral of my washing machine was was too harsh on the fabric during normal wash.  But YMMV.    Tl;dr:  washing machine fades are real.  Gonna be the next big thing.
rawdenim,3d51rs,mrmoonlight87,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:47:00 2015 UTC,"Huh. Inside out, or no? That seems to be the only difference. The SGxx09 is also a fast-fader."

rawdenim,3d51rs,media_mute,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:27:04 2015 UTC,I was washing only the jeans by themselves.   Will probably never wash raws along with other clothes because of the dye that washes off

If you buy quality denim it should still look beautiful like OPs after throwing it in the machine on a regular basis.

rawdenim,3d5pxp,mcadamsandwich,7,Mon Jul 13 21:04:06 2015 UTC,"I'd like to think it's the user who fades the denim through their lifestyle, not the climate. I'm in the Southern US (where it's also very hot/humid), and my jeans do not fade quickly."

rawdenim,3d5pxp,KWBOW,3,Mon Jul 13 23:11:38 2015 UTC,"I think that's kind of just fun humor and not meant to be taken seriously. Nothing about the humidity will make jeans fade, it's all about how often you wear and your lifestyle. I'm pretty sure there is a bigger raw denim market in SE Asia compared to the states so you have more people obsessing and wearing one pair daily for however long and just beating it up. The fades you see could also be guys who work manual labor jobs which of course is heavy wear and tear on your denim."
rawdenim,3d5pxp,Elf_Sedge,2,Mon Jul 13 23:47:39 2015 UTC,"huh, I beg to differ really.. obviously use and abuse is the biggest factor but humidity definitely fades denim better than a dry climate.

rawdenim,3d5pxp,KWBOW,2,Tue Jul 14 00:38:23 2015 UTC,I like to think people paying that kind of money for their denim aren't wearing them around completely drenched in sweat to the point where it makes them that wet.. I could be wrong but I sure hope not.

The teens especually are like War Boys and hope to fade eternal, shiny and indigo. They are a bit too dedicated to fading and wearing every single day. Common myths like washing once a year are still perpetuated.   I often hear teens complain on the Thai denim forum about how their gf and mommies accidentally wash their jeans and ruining their 'progress'.   So yeah, I think it's just a matter of next level dedication and super skinny fits that gives intense rippling honey combs."

I'm looking at the size 28 no wash and go from there as those measurements given are pretty close to the ones of my RGT SK overdyeds in size 27 (they fit well but kinda need a belt to keep it all together)
rawdenim,3d5pxp,proffelytizer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:23:52 2015 UTC,"Having a similar dilemma with both PBJ's AND Oni.  I have my ideal fit range (basically Baldwin Henley Size 34 and Gustin Slim 36) and the sizing is just throwing me.  I think you're supposed to size as close as possible to your ideal fit based on Blue in Green sizing, but the thing that's tripping me up is the size differences between raw and one wash.  That being said, I think you just sorta have to trust that the raw will roughly shrink down to the one wash size, and then have faith that wearing them will form them perfectly to your body after the soak.  This probably doesn't help but at least you know you're not alone!!"
rawdenim,3d5pxp,carrotbooty,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:55:42 2015 UTC,Yeah another thing I noticed is that some sizes show more shrinkage than others which seems odd? I'm just not sure what the best way to accurately gauge sizing is.

rawdenim,3d5pxp,Elf_Sedge,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:44:21 2015 UTC,"not really that odd..shrinkage is a percent, not a defined measurement that it shrinks. so larger sizes shrink a tad more overall. plus denim is pretty mystical so no one really knows  I always recommend raw over one wash just because the latter is not always shrunk to the size on the charts, and you can customize the shrinkage with raw."
rawdenim,3d5pxp,carrotbooty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:41:10 2015 UTC,"but what i have noticed on their sizing guide is that its the same waist measurement between wash and unwash for the size 28 of course everything else changes, but it seems odd that the waste is still the same."

rawdenim,3d5pxp,carrotbooty,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:44:40 2015 UTC,Yeah what worries me is the note from them that most returns are from downsizing too much. That's what's throwing me about proper sizing
rawdenim,3d5pxp,Sc0643,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:33:16 2015 UTC,"If I were you I'd probably downsize one size, or not at all if you don't mind a looser/straighter looking fit. When I bought them the 34 was the only size that I could fit in, but after a year now the waist and thighs are much looser. It'd do you good to get other advice from more experienced buyers though."
rawdenim,3d5pxp,dn0c,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:24:06 2015 UTC,"The xx-012's have quite narrow thighs, so size for those. It's possible that the waist will be too loose as a result, but it's better than the alternative (good-fitting waist with skin-tight thighs)."

Shoulders should be the first place you see if a jacket fits you, then you button it up to see if the chest shape/sizing works on you."

Samurai should definitely have a type 2, at least in their Osaka store.   Also if you want to look a bit different, Kapital has a century denim jacket in the Lee stormrider model and the sashiko fabric is truly amazing."

rawdenim,3d5pxp,RipCAPO,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:36:26 2015 UTC,i need an opinion on a new pair of raw denim. I've started lifting at the gym and have gotten bigger thighs. I've been wearing unbranded 121s heavyweight skinny fit which are unwearable anymore due to my grown thighs. I also wear a pair of naked and famous weird guys that I no longer can wear also due to my growth in thighs. Any recommendations of a pair of denim that is tapered/slim with comfy thigh room?
rawdenim,3d5pxp,berwyn_urine,3,Tue Jul 14 00:02:20 2015 UTC,"There are a few options out there that I can think of off of the top of my head. It all depends on your budget, fit preference, and thigh girth:   Left Field has the Greaser cut that is a higher rise with large thigh room and a taper to the leg opening. They also just introduced the Charles Atlas cut that looks to have a more aggressive taper, but still significant thigh room. Momataro has the Natural Tapered line. The 04xx line from Japan Blue feature a tapered fit with a small leg opening. Different variations have slight differences in fit and fabric; generally speaking, these will have smaller thigh room than the two previously mentioned. Here is the 0412 for example. As a side note, you can find JB denim for ~$100 shipped from denimio.com 3sixteen recently released a classic tapered cut, which has more room than their other slim tapered cut. Taylor Stitch have the Democratic Fit which has a slight taper to them with large thigh room. Rogue Territory also have a new Strider Fit. If you don't need that much room or would like a slimmer fit overall, their Stanton could also work."

rawdenim,3d5pxp,fobonicus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:38:55 2015 UTC,"Looking for a pair of nudies during the 50% off sale but I'm not sure what length or cut to buy. I usually buy 31x32, but I have never bought nudies or raw denim before. Should I size up/down on either of those? Also, I have a pair of Uniqlo jeans with a 6"" leg opening and they fit perfectly. I like how the Tape Teds look on the website, but I feel like the 7"" leg opening might be too wide for me. I have another 7"" pair that I never wear because it seems to flare out too much for my tastes. Would it be different with nudies and specifically that cut? My other option is the High Kai but I'm not sure if they would be too tight for me (I don't like skin-tight). Plus, they would only be available in a 31x34.  Any info on the fits would be greatly appreciated."
rawdenim,3d5pxp,Elf_Sedge,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:49:04 2015 UTC,"Down on waist and up on length, usually. 7"" really is not large at all and is considered on the skinny side of raws. The stiffness of raw denim lets the leg stack in a more appealing fashion so they look a lot better than non-raws w/ the same measurements. Basically a Levi's 511 cut.  I'd always recommend measuring your best fitting jeans and comparing with the brand's size chart, though."
rawdenim,3d5pxp,fobonicus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:58:07 2015 UTC,"My best fitting are 31x32. You would recommend going up to a 34"" length then? Thanks a bunch for the info!"
rawdenim,3d5pxp,Elf_Sedge,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:02:58 2015 UTC,"Now is that the tag measurement or the actual measurement? For example my samurai's have a tag size of 29 and are about 32"" in reality. And it depends on the length, I would probably go 34 just to deal with any shrinkage you may get when you wash (.5""-1"") and you can always get them hemmed if they're too long. Plus it allows you to mess around w stacks and cuffs."
rawdenim,3d5pxp,fobonicus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:07:56 2015 UTC,"I think the waist is closer to 34"" in reality, not sure if I'm measuring it correctly though. They are these if that gives any extra info. I'll go for the 34"" then!"
rawdenim,3d5pxp,GregAllAround,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:23:00 2015 UTC,"This may be too late, so hopefully someone sees it. I got a pair of Paul Rose Products 17.5 Oz. slims on grailed and ordered a size down. They havent been soaked yet or anything. I put them on today and they fit snug, though not too snug. I know if I wear them normally now they will stretch to my desired fit.  However, I'm worried if I soak them I won't be able to wear them because of more shrinkage. (I am barely able to button the top button at the moment.) Does soaking shrink much in the waist of Unsanforized denim? Or is it just in the length?"
rawdenim,3d5pxp,KWBOW,3,Tue Jul 14 01:46:32 2015 UTC,Soaking shrinks the whole Jean entirely. If I remember correctly that heavy weight was a looser weave and can stretch some of you give it time and wear. I recommend wearing them dry for a few days to help stretch it out and then do a cold soak to minimize the shrinkage. You can always give the waistband a nice hard tug while it's wet too.
rawdenim,3d5pxp,GregAllAround,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:07:14 2015 UTC,"I see. So wearing them dry is doable? Most shrinking occurs in the drying process, if what I've been reading is true"
rawdenim,3d5pxp,Elf_Sedge,2,Tue Jul 14 04:40:40 2015 UTC,"I would wear them for a week or two to stretch them out, then once they're comfortable you can go for a quick cold soak, which will minimize shrinking."
rawdenim,3d5pxp,fitzghon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:18:27 2015 UTC,"Possibly a stupid question, but if you bought them off grailed were they soaked by the previous owner?  Most pairs of unsanforized denim shrink down a size when you soak them for the first time. Then they stretch back out some with wear (especially in the waist due to tension when sitting). Most of the time ""snug but not too snug"" is what you aim for after that initial soak."
rawdenim,3d5pxp,GregAllAround,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:36:03 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure the previous owner did not soak them.   If I were to wear them dry would that reduce the initial shrinkage and help them stretch?
rawdenim,3d5pxp,fitzghon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:37:37 2015 UTC,"You should probably try wearing them for a week, so they stretch out a bit (hopefully), and then soaking in cold water for 30 minutes. Then hang dry. Should minimize shrinking but they still might be too tight  (esp. at the waist) afterward."

It doesn't get easier quickly and it doesn't just leave your conscience with a night of drinking or smoking or fucking, but it doesn't hurt to try and treat yourself so that you don't slip into the fallacious pit of assuming it was your fault and a determiner of your worth.   If you need anyone to talk to about it, i can lend an ear because I am still going through this and have only recently started to make significant progress towards recovery. I won't promise that I have perfect advice or anything like that, but I know from experience that sometimes just being able to vent and get it all out helps a lot because it hurts to let the anger and sadness build and build.   I just want to stress how dangerous it is to let their actions affect how you perceive yourself, friend. Whatever it is they did does not make you any less of a man/woman/strong individual, I promise. It is completely a reflector on who they are and on their lack of capacity for compassion and empathy."

rawdenim,3d50ee,ryanxedge,2,Mon Jul 13 18:05:59 2015 UTC,"I don't even know how to describe the feeling I got initially, but yes, it's definitely bizarre. I definitely understand what you mean when you say you've had the future planned out by plans of your future together. Even though my SO never really thought that way, I surely did. I think any logical, mature person would be foolish to go into a relationship without those thoughts in the back of their head.   Sounds like your relationship had been going for a lot longer than mine, but I think if the feelings are real, it hurts just the same. I don't think I'd wish the way I've felt on anyone, so I'm super sympathetic to how you feel and I'm sorry you've gotta go through this, too.   I'm definitely doing better after 2 months. I still think about her everyday, all of the time, but unlike two months ago I'm actually functional for the most part day-to-day. Which is a pretty huge improvement. It's still hard though wanting to talk to her all of the time and wishing I could see her and stopping myself from trying to reach out and do those things.   It's a strange feeling, for sure. Sounds like you've got your head on a little more straight than I did though. Just keep yourself busy to the best of your ability. Maybe if there is something you've been wanting to do for a while but were limited by your relationship, do that. I've been traveling a lot lately, and will be still for the rest of the summer, and am starting to redevelop my plans for future. Looking at graduate schools far, far away from here."

rawdenim,3d50ee,deviantzen,5,Mon Jul 13 16:02:15 2015 UTC,"For a second I was wondering why you specifically needed mosquito repellent for meetup then I realized....  But yeah fam I'm excited to move past the internet stage of pants friendship. Can't wait to chill with some of y'all rad fuccbois IRL. What's in the itinerary though? Due to unforeseen circumstances, I'm no longer ""22."
rawdenim,3d50ee,ryanxedge,5,Mon Jul 13 16:17:04 2015 UTC,I have no idea what's going on. I'll only be able to come down on Sunday. But I'd like some concrete information so I can plan accordingly and bring an adequate amount of Off Deep Woods. haha.
rawdenim,3d50ee,cocksure_whistler,5,Mon Jul 13 16:19:38 2015 UTC,"Like what kind of deets? If I remember correctly, Friday we're probably breaking off to go out in smaller groups at night. Things are pretty busy, so it's better that we don't get tied to a huge group at one place. Saturday is beach, weather permitting, it's been crazy rainy so far this summer. Then Sunday sounded like a big kickball game was in order. Edit: I don't think we're going to have a super-strict itinerary, so going off for a trip to Mildblend or some place you'd like to go isn't out of order at any time.  Anyone coming in to stay would probably do well on Airbnb. Most of us live off the blue line (Wicker Park, Logan Square), so that'd make it easy to get around. There are a few hostels in Wicker Park, but over a weekend they might be booked."
rawdenim,3d50ee,rcsAlex,3,Mon Jul 13 16:20:50 2015 UTC,"Do you think you should make a thread next week with details of what's going on, and maybe set up a way to contact everyone?"
rawdenim,3d50ee,cocksure_whistler,3,Mon Jul 13 23:18:32 2015 UTC,I figured that was going to happen at some point.
rawdenim,3d50ee,ryanxedge,2,Tue Jul 14 01:48:19 2015 UTC,"Word. I guess more specific information like where to go exactly. I'm only free to come down on Sunday, but kickball sounds rad. I know wicker park fest is going on that night too, was thinking about breaking away for that later in the evening too. Also wanted to stop by Mildblend while in the area.  I'm from southeast WI so I'm just driving down and back, no need to stay anywhere."
rawdenim,3d50ee,cocksure_whistler,4,Mon Jul 13 16:24:46 2015 UTC,"Mildblend will be right by Wicker Park Fest, and I'm sure some people will want to head out for that. I'd totally forgotten about Wicker Park fest, but there's a festival every damn weekend, and keeping track of them feels like a job."
rawdenim,3d50ee,ryanxedge,2,Mon Jul 13 16:28:47 2015 UTC,"Cool. Do you have any clue where I should plan on starting the day at on Sunday? Aka what time to be down there by and where to park my car and meetup with people? Mildblend sounds like a good starting location, personally..."
rawdenim,3d50ee,cocksure_whistler,3,Mon Jul 13 16:29:59 2015 UTC,"If we're doing the kickball thing, I think the plan was going to Humboldt Park for that. It's just a bus ride away. With a festival going on, parking in that area would probably be tough. Parking around the park (stick to the north and east sides), is pretty easy. I'd imagine we won't get a start on things until after noon.  But we'll probably have a group text or something like that going so we can keep track of who is where in case things change."
rawdenim,3d50ee,ryanxedge,3,Mon Jul 13 16:39:00 2015 UTC,"Group text sounds like a great idea. When things get closer I'm assuming more concrete plans will develop for each day? If I can swing a parking spot near Mildblend that would probably be easiest for me. I'd like to start there for the day when Luke opens up at noon. Would be great to meet up with someone in that area before bussing around or whatever, since I'm not very familiar with using public transportation in the city, so doing that without screwing up is a bit worrisome to me."
rawdenim,3d50ee,cocksure_whistler,3,Mon Jul 13 16:43:41 2015 UTC,"Google Maps is great at giving transit directions. As long as you have addresses, it'll give you several ways to go. But I'm sure there can be someone who'd want to head out there at that time for some Mildblend/Wicker Park Fest time. I think it'll be much clearer as we get closer. I guess none of us figured that we'd be busier as summer hits with less time to plan, but we can pull it off.  Also, another general thing for anyone coming and comfortable with city biking, we have a great bike share system that has great coverage in the city. It's $7 for 24 hours of unlimited 30-minute trips. They're slow-moving tanks, but it's still a pretty good way to get around. And if anyone wants to do a little research themselves, /r/chicago has a really good sidebar of things to do/eat/drink."
rawdenim,3d50ee,ryanxedge,2,Mon Jul 13 16:53:53 2015 UTC,I didn't even consider it but I might just bring my bike down with me. That would make getting around a hell of a lot easier.
rawdenim,3d50ee,Salsa_Z5,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:59:17 2015 UTC,I'll bike down from MKE and pick you up along the way.
rawdenim,3d50ee,cocksure_whistler,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:58:26 2015 UTC,Just be good at locking it up if you do bring it. They call them sucker poles for a reason.
rawdenim,3d50ee,hanger,6,Mon Jul 13 18:23:41 2015 UTC,First sick day in a long time. I fully intend to spend the day watching Nana (guilty pleasure) and playing one finger death punch.
rawdenim,3d50ee,ryanxedge,5,Mon Jul 13 16:04:26 2015 UTC,"Damn, feel better dude!"
rawdenim,3d50ee,cocksure_whistler,4,Mon Jul 13 16:05:31 2015 UTC,Nana the anime?
rawdenim,3d50ee,hanger,3,Mon Jul 13 18:28:23 2015 UTC,Yep!
rawdenim,3d50ee,cocksure_whistler,3,Mon Jul 13 18:46:25 2015 UTC,"I never watched all the anime, but I read the manga. It's really good, but the manga gets pretty dark. Plus, the author got sick and has been on hiatus since 2009. :\"
rawdenim,3d50ee,hanger,3,Mon Jul 13 18:52:03 2015 UTC,Do you know if the anime catches up to the manga? I'm about 2/3 of the way through the anime right now and it is starting to get dark... I wasn't prepared for this.
rawdenim,3d50ee,cocksure_whistler,3,Mon Jul 13 19:11:00 2015 UTC,"It doesn't. There's probably about 4-5 volumes of manga after the anime ends. A few really big things happen at that point, one of which explains why the characters are where they are at the end of the anime.  ...Now I want to go back and read it."
rawdenim,3d50ee,hanger,2,Mon Jul 13 19:29:16 2015 UTC,Sounds like I have some reading to do after I finish the anime up...
rawdenim,3d50ee,tellymundo,6,Mon Jul 13 20:09:40 2015 UTC,"Forgot my computer at home, and realized it right after I got my hair cut this morning.  So it is a work from home day, and the new BTBAM is up on Spotify so my morning is made!  Also, if the Tigers don't move David Price and/or Yoenis at the deadline, DD will officially have to be declared off the rails."
rawdenim,3d50ee,ryanxedge,4,Mon Jul 13 16:07:21 2015 UTC,I didn't know between the buried and me was still putting out music. I'll have to check that out sometime this week.
rawdenim,3d50ee,tellymundo,2,Mon Jul 13 16:09:54 2015 UTC,"It's spectacular, a very good album.  Has all their hallmarks and they hit them very well."
rawdenim,3d50ee,kyle_phillips,3,Mon Jul 13 16:12:09 2015 UTC,"I heard one song from the new BTBAM and the vocals were a complete turn-off. I've liked all their new releases despite the vocals, not because of them. I'll still give it a shot because Blake Richardson is a magician."
rawdenim,3d50ee,tellymundo,3,Mon Jul 13 16:27:25 2015 UTC,"You ever listen to Animals as Leaders?  Similar musical style with no vocals, you might dig it.  I think they had some guest vocalists, I haven't researched it much but the vocals have been quite different."
rawdenim,3d50ee,kyle_phillips,3,Mon Jul 13 16:36:05 2015 UTC,"I have, I enjoy some of their stuff."
rawdenim,3d50ee,Salsa_Z5,3,Mon Jul 13 16:38:36 2015 UTC,Tosin is the man! I've seen them live 5 times and it's better each time.
rawdenim,3d50ee,tellymundo,2,Mon Jul 13 16:44:04 2015 UTC,I watched a video on vice with him and was amazed at how he makes all those sounds on his 8 string. Dude is a Fucking wizard.
rawdenim,3d50ee,n00bskoolbus,2,Mon Jul 13 16:48:32 2015 UTC,Plus he dresses so stylishly. 10/10 cool dude.
rawdenim,3d50ee,fortunefades,3,Mon Jul 13 19:46:30 2015 UTC,"I really hope we don't move Price, though I've gotta say I'm pretty damn sure we are toast."
rawdenim,3d50ee,tellymundo,2,Mon Jul 13 17:10:34 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love David Price, his approach, his demeanor, and Astro his awesome dog.  If he isn't going to re-sign (not likely) I would rather move him for pieces that can help us next year.  If we have to package Yo with him, I can deal with that too.  Bullpen help, a real third baseman, and another outfielder should be our play."
rawdenim,3d50ee,n00bskoolbus,3,Mon Jul 13 17:13:27 2015 UTC,"While I do like the new album, it feels relatively... chill? At least compared to their past albums."
rawdenim,3d50ee,tellymundo,3,Mon Jul 13 17:53:45 2015 UTC,"Much more relaxed, I would agree."
rawdenim,3d50ee,n00bskoolbus,3,Mon Jul 13 17:55:41 2015 UTC,"Yep, still really like it though. Seeing them play Parallax 2 beginning to end was amazing and is one of the reasons it's my favourite album as a whole from them."
rawdenim,3d50ee,Dasuchin,3,Mon Jul 13 18:03:06 2015 UTC,Definitely need to give it a listen. I listened to some of the stuff they released early and liked it.
rawdenim,3d50ee,fortunefades,7,Mon Jul 13 18:17:43 2015 UTC,"Sent out my resume on Wednesday, with the expectation that I would never hear anything....I have a phone interview tomorrow."
rawdenim,3d50ee,d4mini0n,3,Mon Jul 13 17:08:38 2015 UTC,"Congrats, dude! What field?"
rawdenim,3d50ee,deviantzen,6,Mon Jul 13 18:11:26 2015 UTC,"How y'all doing? I'm chilling at my internship bored af trying to find new music. Been really getting in UK grime lately, I think my palate is too saturated with US hip hop. What have you guys been bumping?  Also to any other NBA fans, Okafor and Mudiay both looking real good. Hope Russell starts stepping it up."
rawdenim,3d50ee,superish64,7,Mon Jul 13 16:20:27 2015 UTC,"I'm still on a Portugal. The Man kick. I think I'm finally starting to come out of it though, What've you been listening to?"
rawdenim,3d50ee,aldenhg,4,Mon Jul 13 16:26:33 2015 UTC,I got on a big Portugal. The Man kick last year. I'll let you know when I get off it.
rawdenim,3d50ee,tellymundo,5,Mon Jul 13 17:02:29 2015 UTC,"Have you seen them live?  They absolutely slay, and the crowd gets so hype.  We were all moshing in the pit and going absolutely nuts, and when I thought it couldn't get any more hype, they closed with a fucking ten minute rendition of ""Helter Skelter"" that blew the lid off the joint.  John Gourley also chucked one of his teles at the back wall of the stage because it wouldn't stay in tune, dude was playing in mid-June in joggers and a coat.  Fucking insane."
rawdenim,3d50ee,aldenhg,3,Mon Jul 13 17:25:55 2015 UTC,"I haven't, but I really want to. I live in Portland and I hear they play around town all the time but I always seem to hear about it the day after."
rawdenim,3d50ee,tellymundo,3,Mon Jul 13 17:42:58 2015 UTC,"If you can make it to a show, I highly recommend you do.  They kill it live."
rawdenim,3d50ee,deviantzen,4,Mon Jul 13 17:51:35 2015 UTC,"Oh man I really like this! That video is sick too.  I've been fucking with Stormzy and Skepta (yeah, basic I know) super hard. Real aggressive UK grime sounds. On the flip side, the new Miguel album really is phenomenal. His use of ambient sounds and muted mixing creates a more atmospheric sound that fits the theme so well."
rawdenim,3d50ee,HarryGBoi,2,Mon Jul 13 17:17:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, man  Last year for my birthday I got myself and a friend tickets to a concert with Portugal, grouplove, and one of my all-time favorite bands Typhoon. Typhoon has never come close to my area and they're a smaller band popularity and recognition wise, so the lineup was literally my dream lineup for a concert. I remember the lead of Portugal came out after typhoon and was just like ""alright you fuckers ready to party?"" And it was so perfect.   Absolutely recommend Portugal live, they are great fun."
rawdenim,3d50ee,Purp3L,5,Mon Jul 13 23:21:31 2015 UTC,"Speaking of US hip hop, I'm in our Datacenter at work bumping Sage the Gemini while I check error logs and reddit. I also recently was pointed towards Kat Dahlia, whom I really enjoyed listening to."
rawdenim,3d50ee,deviantzen,3,Mon Jul 13 16:47:36 2015 UTC,"Solid choice. I peeped Kat Dahlia, she has that EDM undertone new pop sound I really like. Reminds me of a more mainstream hip hop sounding American Katy B."
rawdenim,3d50ee,n00bskoolbus,3,Mon Jul 13 17:19:23 2015 UTC,"Well if you like UK Grime I would assume you listen to Joker? I love both his albums and his essential mix. Currently listening to BTBAMs new album which is very good (probably not up you alley though). Been listening to Ryan Hemsworth a lot, check out his ""Just Rap Mix"" he did for Frank & Oak"
rawdenim,3d50ee,thisisnotclever,2,Mon Jul 13 17:56:43 2015 UTC,There's some good UK hip-hop out there too. The Mouse Outfit's new album is amazing. I've been listening to it a lot recently.
rawdenim,3d50ee,deviantzen,2,Mon Jul 13 16:48:31 2015 UTC,"Oo0 their production is so groovy. My exposure to UK hip hop is limited to the really backpacky Don't Flop scene, so like Shotty Horroh and Lunar C. It's really funny because I recorded a cypher verse with a British accent a while back."
rawdenim,3d50ee,superish64,5,Mon Jul 13 17:21:39 2015 UTC,"I hate forgetting passwords! It's even worse because when I changed it someone told me to write it down and I said ""No it's cool, I'll remember it."" Damn it."
rawdenim,3d50ee,KingOCarrotFlowers,13,Mon Jul 13 16:22:16 2015 UTC,"See, your problem is that you're not making your passwords predictable enough for you.   This is what I do:     Come up with a single word, preferably in another language (and also containing letters which can be substituted for other characters). For the purposes of this example, let's assume that I've decided to use the word ""vlastar"" which is Romanian for ""offshoot."" Change the characters that compose that word so that you're using as many character sets as possible when you type it. For our example, let me show you the progression: vlastar (original word, an alphabet of 26 distinct letters) vLastar (with capitalization, an alphabet of 52 distinct letters) vLa5tar (add a number, an alphabet of 62 distinct letters) vL@5tar (include special characters, which expands your alphabet to ~80 characters, depending on how many special characters are included)    Now that you have a key-phrase (which will essentially be your password for every website you use), you can customize it to use with different websites. Here's what I would recommend, in order to make every one of your passwords unique, but difficult for a computer or another human to predict, but easy for you to predict. Style 1 is slightly better than style 2, because it doesn't leave a full character string that matches the name of the service. There are plenty of middle-ground options between those two styles, however.

rawdenim,3d50ee,superish64,5,Mon Jul 13 16:53:33 2015 UTC,Thats awesomely complicated and simple at the same time! I love it!
rawdenim,3d50ee,KingOCarrotFlowers,6,Mon Jul 13 16:59:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This system was the result of a long conversation / argument with a friend when I was in college, after this xkcd came out.  The idea was to make fairly long, but also unique and high-entropy passwords for every service you log into. The key-word I use in my system is a bit longer, and also includes more character substitutions.   At work, my password has to be changed every 90 days and can't be a previous password, so for that one I include a date-stamp in the middle, which corresponds with the day I last changed my password."

rawdenim,3d50ee,ryanxedge,2,Mon Jul 13 18:32:19 2015 UTC,Was really confused by this system til I looked over it a few times. I might have to make be change on everything sometime...
rawdenim,3d50ee,mfarmtown,4,Mon Jul 13 19:28:48 2015 UTC,"now what do you do about sites that don't allow special characters in their passwords? that's where i always encounter problems, because i can never remember which sites do/don't require what and then what variation of the password i should be using."
rawdenim,3d50ee,n00bskoolbus,3,Mon Jul 13 17:20:25 2015 UTC,You should really email those sites because it's leaving their users more open to issues. My bank doesn't allow special characters. Fuckin stupid.
rawdenim,3d50ee,mfarmtown,6,Mon Jul 13 18:00:04 2015 UTC,"same with mine, and it only allows one attempt before locking you out and making you call to reset it. i get locked out a lot."
rawdenim,3d50ee,Teamster,5,Mon Jul 13 18:41:27 2015 UTC,"Banks are the worst about this.   Password must be between 6 and 8 characters, alphanumeric, no special characters, must contain at least 2 numbers and a Norse sigil."
rawdenim,3d50ee,KingOCarrotFlowers,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:14:34 2015 UTC,"This happens a fair amount of the time--what I do is strip all of the offending characters and replace them with the corresponding letters.   This way, if I get a ""that's not the right password"" error, I can just enter the password again without the special characters, and it lets me in on the second try. And if you use a service a lot, you'll just come to know which ones want the characters and which don't."
rawdenim,3d50ee,mfarmtown,3,Mon Jul 13 17:25:45 2015 UTC,"that would work if it wasn't my bank, which only allows one attempt before locking you out. and you'd think i'd remember by now but sometimes i'm just on autopilot when it comes to entering my password"
rawdenim,3d50ee,KingOCarrotFlowers,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:42:34 2015 UTC,"That's really lame of your bank.   First, because you'd think they'd want to encourage you to keep your password's entropy pretty high, since it makes it easier for them to protect against fraud.   And second, because locking you out after one bad attempt is kind of a dumb, over-restricted security policy. I kind of wonder who made that decision and why."
rawdenim,3d50ee,Teamster,3,Mon Jul 13 18:45:58 2015 UTC,I definitely just use Dashlane and a crazy complicated generated password.
rawdenim,3d50ee,KingOCarrotFlowers,2,Mon Jul 13 18:13:40 2015 UTC,"See, I really don't like password managers. I know that they're secure and everything, at least academically, but having every single one of your passwords behind one master password just feels risky to me."
rawdenim,3d50ee,Teamster,3,Mon Jul 13 18:30:10 2015 UTC,"I totally get it. I only committed to a password manager after realizing that no matter how many good-faith attempts to have a unique password for every service, I keep defaulting to the same basic string of 2-5 passwords for everything.  I've gotten much more secure since switching to a password manager."
rawdenim,3d50ee,KingOCarrotFlowers,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:31:23 2015 UTC,"Which is exactly what they're for. Honestly I don't have any real actual, solid reasons for not trusting a password manager except for a vague sense of unease about them.  I'd probably use one if I hadn't already devised my whole password system. Honestly, I think my system is probably more secure, but I think that for the vast majority of people, a password manager is many orders of magnitude more secure than what they're currently doing."
rawdenim,3d50ee,dn0c,5,Mon Jul 13 18:39:59 2015 UTC,"Get 1Password and you'll never forget a password again. Plus, you'll have super secure passwords for everything. I can't recommend it highly enough."
rawdenim,3d50ee,ryanxedge,3,Mon Jul 13 16:38:24 2015 UTC,I've got variations of the same password for everything and I feel the same way. Idk why I don't have them all written down
rawdenim,3d50ee,superish64,4,Mon Jul 13 16:28:48 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why I didn't just go with my usual password. Wait maybe I did!  EDIT: Nope, now I have no idea."

rawdenim,3d50ee,What_the_Hecht,3,Mon Jul 13 16:39:00 2015 UTC,I've made a list of all of mine in my notes section on my phone. It's been super helpful.

rawdenim,3d50ee,KingOCarrotFlowers,2,Mon Jul 13 16:59:34 2015 UTC,Please don't do this. The former IT guy in me is cringing super hard.   Get a password manager like 1Password if you must. But don't just store your passwords in plaintext anywhere.

rawdenim,3d50ee,Irenarch,4,Mon Jul 13 16:36:43 2015 UTC,"So I'm in the process of learning French, since a lot of jobs in my area require it. Does anyone have any recommendations for books or websites that might help? I've tried Duolingo but was really underwhelmed."
rawdenim,3d50ee,irrenhouse,6,Mon Jul 13 17:02:14 2015 UTC,"Look for the local Alliance-Francais in your area if you can find a way to afford it.   Practicing speaking and verb forms are the most important. Look online for worksheets to practice. Checkout r/French for a whole world of resources.   If you're in Canada, look for resources based on the Quebecois form like Je Parle Quebecois as opposed to more Parisian or African appropriate resources.  Hit me up if you need more info or have specific questions."
rawdenim,3d50ee,TentaclesForEveryone,3,Mon Jul 13 17:43:29 2015 UTC,"Not books or websites, but I've been trying to do the same thing recently and I can think of a couple of groups in the city for practicing French conversation. A few of the libraries offer free French conversation classes, and there's also the OttawaBabel Meetup group which always has at least a few French speakers (although it can devolve into English quite easily because it isn't as structured as the library sessions). The OffQc blog is also great for learning Canadian French.  Alternatively, hop on Tinder and swipe right on a bunch of people from across the bridge?"
rawdenim,3d50ee,JasperUngulate,2,Mon Jul 13 21:08:59 2015 UTC,"Talking to people who have learned English as a second language, the book taught English wasn't good as no one speaks like that generally. It's a lot of idioms and whatnot that don't translate.  Watch children's programming in French, and English movies with French subtitles on, or French movies with English subtitles on."
rawdenim,3d50ee,allthegoodghosts,2,Mon Jul 13 19:24:09 2015 UTC,"Thing is, in this case, I would think /u/Irenarch wouldn't want to learn particularly idiomatic French, because he's looking for a Gov't gig (if I'm not mistaken). That said, you're right about the French children's programming; TFO (T√©l√©vision fran√ßaise de l'Ontario) would be a great resource.  I'm ""preparing"" to do my English test, hoping to land the exemption (technically, it's my second language, though my English is actually better than my French at this point), and proper syntax is super important."
rawdenim,3d50ee,Irenarch,2,Tue Jul 14 01:46:02 2015 UTC,"Is syntax super important for, say, a BBB proficiency test? I'm about BCC right now, though the B in reading comprehension is almost entirely because I read/speak Spanish, so I can read a few Romance languages.  (Hilariously, the self-administered proficiency test on the gov't jobs website scored me as almost perfectly bilingual just because I can read...)"
rawdenim,3d50ee,allthegoodghosts,5,Tue Jul 14 02:21:55 2015 UTC,"More broadly, grammar is important.  Honestly, if you think you're at BCC now, you're probably okay to get tested, especially if you only need BBB for the jobs you're looking at.  The guidelines (at least for the written expression aspect) are as follows: at ""A"", you're expected to make some grammatical mistakes, and you're able to express simple concepts using simple sentences. To borrow an example from The Simpsons, ""La grenouille mange le pamplemousse"", ""The frog eats the grapefruit"".  At ""B"", they expect you to have basic grammar down, and you'll be using words and sentences that are job-specific. More-or-less proper syntax is important here, but some grammatical mistakes are still to be expected. You should be able to carry on a simple correspondence at this level.  At ""C"", you're expected to be able to develop ideas at length. You should be able to write out detailed memos, and even find and correct grammatical errors in other peoples' work.  To land at level ""E"", you basically have to do so well on your ""C"" level test that they decide you'll be able to maintain a ""C"" level indefinitely. For a past colleague of mine, being able to use the pass√© simple tense (a decidedly formal, literary, and outmoded past tense) was what pushed her over the top to get her exemption.  The oral testing requirements are much more lenient at all levels. Even up to C, they'll let you get away with more grammatical errors than in the written comprehension or expression aspects."
rawdenim,3d50ee,Irenarch,2,Tue Jul 14 02:56:04 2015 UTC,"Er, shit, I meant to say that I'm at BAA, not BCC. Wishful thinking! (A scale where C is higher than A seems a little counter-intuitive, too...)  Thanks so much for the detailed advice! I wish I'd retained more of my highschool French - I'm easily a BBB in Spanish, so it's very frustrating not being able to express myself very well in French at this point. Gonna have to put some time in while I have some to spare."

rawdenim,3d50ee,Ramachandrann,5,Mon Jul 13 20:48:40 2015 UTC,"Boring day today. I'm at my girlfriend's parents' house chillin with my dog because I'm moving soon and need to get my crap out of my place. I'm luckily not needing to go into work today and I'm going fishing tonight and tomorrow morning with some buddies I haven't seen in a while. Hopefully we can get some nice walleye or maybe a musky (?!?!?!?).  ON A HUGE HIGH NOTE, I have a meeting with the SVP of a company I'd like to start working for. My friend works for him and got me some time to talk to him. My other friend's dad owns a medical supply company and is buddy-buddy with the company's CEO that I'm heading to, so maybe he can put in a good word to the SVP for me. I'm really nervous and since a lot of you seem to be in the business sector, I wanted to ask you guys for some advice.  I think I want to eventually get into consulting work for medical supply/device companies and/or pharma companies. Consulting seems like something I'd be good at because I'm personable and I have pretty good interpersonal and speaking skills. My coworkers describe me as charming and an efficient speaker and I kind of have a knack for trouble shooting. Combining my own natural abilities with my learned skills from my current work, I think I have a very transferable skill set that could work really well to make a mutually beneficial relationship with an employer in this job field. Obviously I'm not just going to jump into the thick of things, but with a good mentor, I think I'm primed to go to the next step.  My question for you guys: What the hell do I ask the SVP? What kind of questions do you think he'll ask me? I plan on asking the usual about his journey and why he's at the company he's at, what an entry level position looks like at his company and what kind of on job training and resources would be available to a new hire (not necessarily myself). Do you guys think you could help me out a bit? I'm also speaking with my father and my other buddy who has some experience with this, but I think you guys may have some valuable advice.  Thanks for the help, anyone who responds!"

rawdenim,3d1nf0,Ramachandrann,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:05:50 2015 UTC,Really? That's interesting.
rawdenim,3d1nf0,youngofthesoonest,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:55:17 2015 UTC,Yeah we looked at a few different pairs and none had chain stitching there
rawdenim,3d1nf0,Ramachandrann,5,Wed Jul 15 02:10:33 2015 UTC,"If it's a shitty construction job, obviously I think it's unacceptable especially if it happens within a short amount of time but what I was saying is that you also have to understand what you're buying. Sure it seems like samurai is having problems and it sucks  but part of it is also the nature of using 100% cotton stitching. It's going to fail quicker than cotton poly and it's not as strong unless you're using something like pima cotton thread. For the most part, my jeans using all cotton stitching need stitching repairs quicker than my jeans using cotton poly.   What he's showing is a chainstitch that has unraveled after 10 months of wear and 2 washes which is not that unheard of and while it looks pretty gnarly, just a few breaks in the thread can cause it to look like that."
rawdenim,3d1nf0,raWorkshop,2,Mon Jul 13 02:21:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the issue with chain stitching. And exactly, I personally don't like cotton stitching exactly for that reason haha."
rawdenim,3d1nf0,Elf_Sedge,2,Mon Jul 13 02:25:37 2015 UTC,"Chainstitching is generally the better option for outseams because of the higher level of elasticity, your outseams will recover from seam grin much better.  Lockstitch can be faster if it means you don't need to move machines to complete the outseam operation.    On my personal pair of Samurai's and the ones that come through the shop for repair I rarely see failed chainstitches  fail where lockstitches would not have.  The best example I can think of is the felled seam on the risers/yoke - more often then not the needle/top thread will fail from abrasion.  The chain/looper thread on the inside is still in perfect condition."
rawdenim,3d1nf0,justforflan,2,Mon Jul 13 23:54:24 2015 UTC,"What you aren't understanding is that this isn't a construction issue per se, as /u/youngofthesoonest pointed out, it's the 100% cotton that's most likely the culprit. My Sammy's are having tons of broken threads but it's just due to the type of thread."
rawdenim,3d1nf0,Ramachandrann,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:31:28 2015 UTC,And being a chainstich which will run if broken. This isn't surprising really. Also easy to repair.
rawdenim,3d1nf0,Elf_Sedge,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:05:27 2015 UTC,"No. I understand that and referenced it in other comments. /u/Jawnzer has pointed out some consistent issues people have been having with this particular run of Sammys. So, sure, 100% cotton stitching is more likely to fail than poly, I get it, what doesn't make sense is this is happening seemingly far more consistently than natural wear and tear."

rawdenim,3d1nf0,youngofthesoonest,-1,Sun Jul 12 20:51:20 2015 UTC,There is not a hole yet. It also looks like a child sewed the jeans. Very poor craftsmanship. I expected more from Samurai. I have heard a lot of problems with Samurai stitching in the last year or so.
rawdenim,3d1nf0,jawnzer,2,Sun Jul 12 20:58:49 2015 UTC,eh it's not necessarily poor craftsmanship and more that it's all cotton thread. All cotton thread is more authentic but does break down quicker. With that said late I have seen a few where the stitching has failed really early but my guess is that it was probably just a couple bad ones in that particular run.
rawdenim,3d1nf0,youngofthesoonest,0,Sun Jul 12 22:42:16 2015 UTC,i would disagree with that. If you look at this photo you can see the particularly sloppy sewing
rawdenim,3d1nf0,jawnzer,9,Sun Jul 12 22:59:16 2015 UTC,"thats the chainstitch coming loose in multiple areas after parts of the threads broke. there's no way the person operating the machine could sew it up like that unless the person was intentionally trying to fuck up the stitch afterwards. It's one of the properties of a chainstitch where if one part of the thread breaks, the whole stitch will start to unravel and come apart. If it came like that new, then obviously it's poor workmanship and equally bad QC but if it's after 10 months of wear and multiple washes, while it's annoying and not ideal, it's not completely unheard of."
rawdenim,3d1nf0,youngofthesoonest,2,Sun Jul 12 23:27:46 2015 UTC,"Post lot 16 has had lots of trouble. I do agree with you that after a few moths you should accept it, but with the amount of people having problems it just seems weird. I could probably list 10 places on my S710 og that have stitching failing, where my s710xx are still incredibly strong. So not sure if it's a new factory sewing them up (shitty tension on thread) or just new thread. But something has to be different because it's pretty lame."

rawdenim,3d0ubp,rpdos,3,Sun Jul 12 18:54:43 2015 UTC,Nope just gotta accept it especially if it's left hand twill denim. Leg twist is gonna happen.
rawdenim,3d0ubp,Buckhum,3,Sun Jul 12 19:00:41 2015 UTC,3 Options  1) Embrace it  2) Buy a broken twill pair  3) Alterations
rawdenim,3d0ubp,Big_Hoss_Butt_Floss,2,Mon Jul 13 01:17:39 2015 UTC,"Any experience with these ONI 546's?  I'm tempted by the amazing price ($221 compared to $398 on BiG).  I'm a little leery of the low rise on them.  Do Onis give a high contrast fade?  That's why I'm looking at these 22 oz heavy weights.  My current raws are Wood and Iron 13.75 oz Cone denim that are definitely more of a vintage fade pattern and I want something different for my next pair.  EDIT:  And should I go for one washed or raw on these?  My bias is towards the one wash, since they should be maximally shrunk, but maybe I don't fully appreciate the pros and cons."
rawdenim,3d0ubp,Buckhum,3,Sun Jul 12 21:35:12 2015 UTC,"Onis can fade quickly: there's a guy on Sufu's DWC thread I forgot his name but his secret denim fade really damn fast. Also, my Naked & Famous x Oni collab faded pretty quickly for 2 months wear. Too bad it doesn't fit anymore. One wash would save you a lot of trouble with sizing (I still don't trust denimio size chart, so go with BlueinGreen's). However, raw would give you that unsanforized soak your jeans and control your own shrikage experience. It really is a lot of fun."
rawdenim,3d0ubp,truswen,2,Mon Jul 13 01:23:56 2015 UTC,"correct me if i'm wrong, but natural indigo fades slow right? I remember reading it here couple days ago..."
rawdenim,3d0ubp,Buckhum,2,Mon Jul 13 09:56:16 2015 UTC,"I would attribute it to the method of dyeing rather than the natural indigo dye itself. Specifically, most AI jeans are hanked or hand dyed numerous times so that the dyes penetrate all the way to the core instead of having an indigo outer layer and white core that regular jeans have. Thus, these kind of jeans fade 'slower' because the indigo falls off the outer layer only to reveal more indigo inside the individual threads. A good example of these next level dye penetration would be the Pure Blue Japan AI-001 / 002.   Thus, because these Onis are ROPE dyed instead of hank dyed like the PBJ-AI001, the Onis should fade just like regular jeans. I want to claim that other natural indigo jeans that are not repeatedly hank dyed do fade perfectly fine (like Naked and Famous's); however I cannot find a picture to prove this right now so my claim is unsubstantiated.   TL;DR - Oni should fade just fine. They are rope dyed."

Maybe the SD-107? N&F Has some japanese fabrics in their skinny cuts. Also the Gustin Loomstates just released again and i think they're making it in their skinny cut.
rawdenim,3cx7h6,parallax1,2,Sat Jul 11 20:42:16 2015 UTC,Anyone own a pair of the IH-634SII?  I'm definitely looking for something with a bigger thigh and they look more interesting to me than the standard 634.  Plus IH is about to have their mini summer sale.

I'm in the market for nice black jeans with a strong taper to hold some slim/skinny-looking stacks (I'm kinda thinking SLP-like, but not as overtly emaciated), and I'm not sure if going raw on this pair is advisable.  I'm also considering the Nudie High Kai or Acne something-cash but I like the sound of the selvedge15oz more. I have a 34inch pair of PBJ xx-012 but they're pretty loose all around after losing a bit of weight and stretching."
rawdenim,3cx7h6,ASlags,2,Sat Jul 11 23:25:56 2015 UTC,They are quite skinny. I have skinny legs and these were pretty tight on me at first. Definitely stretched in the waist. Be careful with the sizing too. I ordered a 26 and wear a true size 30. RgT's size chart was pretty accurate on their site. SK's have a pretty strong taper and are tight behind the knee as well. Hope this is helpful. Great pair of jeans for sure.

rawdenim,3cx7h6,Josie1234,2,Sun Jul 12 02:14:57 2015 UTC,"Don't let the sizing scare you, go by their chart and you'll be good. They do stretch in the waist, so if you really want to, possibly size down one as long as the other measurements still work for you. Mine (non stealth mind you) stretched about an inch, but I wear a belt every day anyways so it doesn't bother me a bit. The fit is on point, and my particular fades have been slow, but mine are regular indigo, not stealth. I do have the stealth supply jacket, which has almost no signs of fading except for where I always put my hands in the pockets, it has about 3 months of wear."

rawdenim,3cx7h6,jgrutza,2,Sun Jul 12 16:52:02 2015 UTC,"When I bought my Momotaro 0605-18s, I got them hemmed by this guy Satchel. ( https://instagram.com/scienceandkindness/ ) He does a really great job and has a Union Special, so it ended up costing $40. Unfortunately, the store I purchased them from didn't offer complimentary hemming on a $300 pair of jeans. Fine. I get it.   A month later, I bought the Momotaro 0605-18B, which is the same, but with a black weft. I bought them to wear to work. I didn't get them hemmed because I couldn't imagine spending another $40 on them again. They were too long. They looked shitty. I didn't want to cuff them, but I just figured I'd let them go for a while.  It started getting to me when I realized that with my new job, I could wear the indigo jeans instead of the black jeans. I wanted to keep the black ones in rotation, but I preferred the indigo, partially because of the length, partially because they are more worn in. I decided to get the black ones hemmed in the new city I am in. Sedona, Arizona. It's small, but there are a few options for tailors. I asked around and found the one that was said to be the best. This hem cost $13.  Here is a comparison of the hems: http://imgur.com/a/F3pqX  Does anyone know anything about this hemming method? I have never seen it before, but I'm assuming it is used more commonly on dress pants. It looks pretty sturdy, but I'm wondering what it's going to look like in a few months."
rawdenim,3cx7h6,Buckhum,3,Sun Jul 12 01:51:42 2015 UTC,"Your black momo photos have pretty low contrast but Im pretty sure it's a lockstitch hem while the first 2 photos have chainstitch hem.   Here is a good article to explain their differences: http://www.rawrdenim.com/2011/04/chain-stitch-v-s-lock-stitch-pros-cons/  However keep in mind that rawrdenim exaggerates the disadvantage of lockstitch. For example, ""aesthetically unnatural"" Wtf does that even mean?!? Also you can get roping effects on lockstitch too, provided that the hem is folded nice and small (which your black momo isn't, unfortunately).

The Tight Tapered will be their slimmest offering which has only been around for a year. Japan Blue was created so they can explore with more tapered and modern fits as well as fabric.  Your UB101 is a slim straight (technically has a very, very slight taper) so the Momotaro slim straight models could work."

rawdenim,3cuhe9,jwsallen,3,Fri Jul 10 21:47:15 2015 UTC,/u/vedar has that shirt. Maybe he can enlighten us on how it has aged...?
rawdenim,3cuhe9,affected_professor,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:34:11 2015 UTC,"I have a different shirt from their Indigo Collection. It's faded a little, but not too dramatically. It's only really noticeable at the seams, cuffs, and collar.  The warning tag about indigo bleeding is overkill. Maybe you'd get some if you machine washed it on hot with white tees for the first wash."
rawdenim,3cuhe9,dakaf_fal,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:56:14 2015 UTC,The shirt has barely faded. There's some indigo rub off even now but it doesn't bleed as much as other indigo stuff that I have.  There's some creasing in the elbows but nothing that I would consider amazing
rawdenim,3cuhe9,vedar,2,Sun Jul 12 07:53:41 2015 UTC,"Interesting detail with the selvedge line running down the collar like that. Is that two pieces of denim sewn together, or is it just a separate selvedge strip sewn onto a single piece? How is that done exactly?"
rawdenim,3cuhe9,monsoon4,7,Fri Jul 10 22:13:34 2015 UTC,"It's a standard detail on many Japanese denim shirts, e.g. SDA, fullcount, etc. I'd imagine JCrew just take apart one of those and copy almost the exact specs."
rawdenim,3cuhe9,amarofades,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:19:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll have to look for that on some shirt in the future."
rawdenim,3cuhe9,monsoon4,3,Sun Jul 12 00:09:54 2015 UTC,it appears to be two separate pieces and the piece with the button hole is folded back on itself and sewn at the edge of the collar.
rawdenim,3cuhe9,monsoon4,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:21:15 2015 UTC,"Nice, looks like a pretty solid shirt altogether."
rawdenim,3cuhe9,QuinnSelvedgeSupply,2,Sun Jul 12 00:10:26 2015 UTC,"While I haven't constructed a collar with this particular detail, I believe I have a good idea as to how it was put together.  Most collars (excluding the collar band) are two pieces sewn together face to face leaving the side towards the collar band open, then they are flipped right side out and top stitched for a clean finish.   To achieve the selvedge detail seen on this shirt I would simply sandwich an additional triangular piece of denim (with the selvedge lined up appropriately) between the two pieces of collar fabric, sew them all together, invert, and top stitch to finish."
rawdenim,3cuhe9,monsoon4,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:08:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation. I just checked out your website (I think), I like that denim t-shirt you make, if that's what it is, pretty cool. - http://www.quinnselvedge.com/customer-photos/ Do you sell stuff online as well?"

rawdenim,3cuhe9,monsoon4,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:38:48 2015 UTC,Cool. Can't wait to see it. Good luck with everything.
rawdenim,3cuhe9,landofcortados,2,Sun Jul 12 05:47:39 2015 UTC,"I have this shirt as well, though it only have a few wears. I bought it last year when it was 50% off final sale items. Ended up being around $60. So far it's pretty nice, it's been too warm here in California to get some decent wears."
rawdenim,3cvkqs,Krixly,11,Sat Jul 11 03:27:52 2015 UTC,"At retail value? Maybe not. On Sale? Most likely yes.  I personally love Nudies, but have to admit that at their retail price point (~$150), it's hard to recommend them over a brand like N&F, Unbranded, or Gustin.   That said, I think their variety of cuts is second-to-none, I love how their fades look, and I dig that they use organic cotton. Their biggest downfall is mainly the quality of their actual denim fabric - it's generally not super robust, and tends to rip / thin fairly quickly."
rawdenim,3cvkqs,dn0c,15,Sat Jul 11 04:58:54 2015 UTC,"the quality is not on par as a company like momotaro or ironheart obviously. If you're looking at brands like nudie or APC the denim is mostly bought cause of the fits they have. 98 bucks that's a steal IMO, and the reason why nudie gets a bad rep for its durability is cause people size down way too much and they get a quick crotch blow out. For 98 bucks you did pretty good, id keep them if I were you, since you have no issues with them in the first place."
rawdenim,3cvkqs,619rko9,7,Sat Jul 11 03:41:54 2015 UTC,Agreed. If they fit well and look good then op is fine.  Price is pretty damn good too.
rawdenim,3cvkqs,MrMofoness,2,Sat Jul 11 03:47:39 2015 UTC,"They fit pretty well, I got them two inches longer than usual for stacking and it seems to work pretty well. I went TTS so I'm assuming I should be fine. They actually feel pretty elastic compared to the Levis and Gap jeans I have."
rawdenim,3cvkqs,eyesaucelease,3,Sat Jul 11 04:44:42 2015 UTC,I'll second what's already been said.  For 98 bucks I would say definitely worth it.  I would go TTS.
rawdenim,3cvkqs,snecseruza,3,Sat Jul 11 04:29:50 2015 UTC,I would buy $100 pairs of Nudies all day.   I have a pair of Grim Tim selvedge that I love. But would I spend another $200+ on another pair? Probably not.   But if we're talking only a hundred bones... well... I would take $100 Nudies over most other jeans in the same price range.
rawdenim,3cvkqs,LetoTheTyrant,3,Sat Jul 11 06:31:29 2015 UTC,"I like my nudie's a lot and will definitely buy another pair in the future.  I got mine on sale for about $100 as well.  I'd really like this pair, but at $375, I think I'd get a custom pair from Companion Denim first."
rawdenim,3cvkqs,mbcgg,2,Sat Jul 11 19:35:08 2015 UTC,"Personally I love their fits, got all of my jeans under $80 from nudie. The stretch really helps with my athletic thighs and look great. Hope you enjoy them like I do!"
rawdenim,3cvkqs,TheWakaWakaMan,2,Sat Jul 11 06:13:37 2015 UTC,Had nudies last me 5 years before but they are partial to ripping.... if im doing anything that would run the risk of a rip I chuck on my carhartts.... nudies (unlike most jeans) just get better with time though
rawdenim,3cvkqs,notonetojudge,2,Sat Jul 11 15:32:42 2015 UTC,"I've had a pair of Tight Long Johns since january and I love them. I've worn them almost everyday and there is no sign of an imminent crotch blowout. After the first few weeks, they get super comfy and imo the fit is second to none. I'm looking forward to washing them for the first time.  One small thing: I feel like they fade really slowly, but that's okay with me."

Nudie has a sale with 50% off in Europe and I think they are worth the price I pay here in Europe. Their fit is nice, I like their business model and they earn extra points for being Swedish."
rawdenim,3cvkqs,wangus9,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:15:40 2015 UTC,I believe it's the thing as Levi's in Europe. What I have heard is that they're expensive there while they are pretty cheap here (can be had for as low as $10USD)

I requested a problem that was of the ""low-level"" type thinking I'd get to do bitwise stuff, but instead of giving me something in binary, it looks like they turned the problem into a base-3 problem rather than a base-2 one.   Which I personally think is at least a tiny bit evil."
rawdenim,3ct90a,d_wilson123,7,Fri Jul 10 16:50:44 2015 UTC,Every time someone talks about the google interview process it seems like needless intellectual jerking off questions for the sake of jerking off.  I know it is a huge destination job for many software developers but google and their culture seems to define my idea of a personal hell.
rawdenim,3ct90a,KingOCarrotFlowers,3,Fri Jul 10 17:30:17 2015 UTC,"It's definitely intellectual jerking off questions.  The problem I'm solving is the most contrived problem to solve imaginable. The scenario is that there's a weight on the left half of a scale, and you're given weights one at a time that are increasing powers of three, and you need to find a way to balance the scale for any given initial weight.   It's stupid. It's arbitrary. It's intellectually masturbatory. But I have to do it to prove that I can."
rawdenim,3ct90a,d_wilson123,5,Fri Jul 10 17:33:51 2015 UTC,"I guess my issue with their strategy (which has increasingly mounting evidence it doesn't work) is that never in my 10 years now of professional software development have I encountered a problem where I solve it by myself in a vacuum.  If I was hiring someone on to my team I'd take the guy who is collaborative over the guy who is an individual genius.  And I don't see how these whiteboard problem solving questions really get to know if the person you are hiring works well as a team or if they can use, modify and adapt other people's software to current needs.  IDK maybe I just don't ""get it"" but it seems like a flawed methodology and if it wasn't for the sex appeal of working at Google they'd probably have a hard time actually finding hires."
rawdenim,3ct90a,KingOCarrotFlowers,2,Fri Jul 10 17:43:14 2015 UTC,"It kind of depends on what they're trying to get at with their recruiting methods--yeah, anyone would tell you that the whiteboard problems or the solving problems in a vacuum isn't the way that software development is done--in the real world, it's better to have multiple eyes on something anyway.  ...but maybe Google is just interested in finding the types of candidates who, like me, would see a list of problems and think ""Hey, fun puzzle time."""

rawdenim,3ct90a,fitzghon,2,Fri Jul 10 18:57:01 2015 UTC,"I'd say that's a pretty normal speed for jeans to fade. If you haven't washed yet, this is typically the point where a wash will take away some free indigo on the jeans and really bring out the fades across the whole jean."

My laptop is a fucking tank at 17"", and the thing is a beast- it can handle anything I throw at it (running elementary OS) and scores respectably high octane scores. It is SUCH a pain in the ass to carry around though because it weighs a lot and is just generally ridiculously big.  I bought the Toshiba Chromebook 2 because I've heard nothing but good things about it, but after watching more and more reviews of the Google Pixel 2, I really want one, even though 1k is way too much for a cafe-cruiser laptop. The thing is so sexy though!  Does anyone have the Toshiba Chromebook 2?"
rawdenim,3ct90a,itsNoisy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:35:48 2015 UTC,"Chromebooks look so clean. Much like you, i was considering getting a smaller one for easier transportation. What are the specs?"
rawdenim,3ct90a,tacos4days,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:20:27 2015 UTC,"I pulled the trigger on this one. When it came out it was widely reviewed as the best Chromebook on the market. I think it's still considered to be that by many, but Google's own Pixel 2 is challenging. The main difference? Price tag. The Thoshiba Chromebook 2 has an MSRP of $329 for the 4GB model with a full HD IPS display and a little less for one with 2GB and a inferior display (IMO the latter is not worth it), while the Google Pixel 2 has an 8GB version for about 1k and a 12GB version for about 1.2k  Really, though there are a lot of differences. The pixel 2 might be the most powerful stock laptop on the market. The body is sexy, sturdy aluminum, full HD that rivals (and some believe surpasses) Retina displays, and very powerful guts. The main question people have is how can a laptop simply running ChromeOS be worth that much, and why does it need such powerful hardware?   The main knock on the Toshiba is the Bay-Trail chipset is kinda outdated. The way I see it, the Toshiba is perfect for what I want- a portable laptop for browsing the internet, doing some writing, running google docs at work, etc., but not powerful enough to replace my main laptop. The pixel is powerful enough to be your only computer if you can live with ChromeOS, or are willing to venture into running a full Linux install (which is what I would most certainly do)."
rawdenim,3ct90a,tacos4days,2,Fri Jul 10 18:36:12 2015 UTC,I have a sneaking suspicion in the future I'll just buy a refurbished Pixel 2 and throw Ubuntu on it to replace my Acer Aspire 7750G that I've made as powerful as I can.

rawdenim,3ct90a,tacos4days,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:12:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing, that review was dope. I mean, the Pixel looks insane. If my main laptop was starting to lag more and show it's age than I would totally talk myself into splurging on the Pixel right now, but I just did an octane test and it scores almost as high as I've seen the new Pixel score so...I guess I'll have to wait. The Toshiba will be a great way to play around with ChromeOS, see how I like running Crouton (linux and chromeOS side by side, instead of one or the other) and decide if the Pixel will be my next main machine.

Or will it be too expensive to be worth it?  Edit for clarity: the denim itself is broken in perfectly, but it is simply too large for me at the moment - it fits me well in the shoulders and chest but the midsection is just too large and the sleeves are both too long and too wide (idk if that's the proper word, but they're too big to the point of draping awkwardly)."

I don't own a pair of APCs but everyone tells me they stretch a ton. As long as you were able to button all the buttons with no problem then it should be alright.

rawdenim,3cs1t3,opinionado,7,Fri Jul 10 08:48:20 2015 UTC,"The forum is worth checking out (plus good comments) but if you're too lazy to sign up I'm pasting the full text of the interview in this comment:  INTERVIEW WITH DENIMIO  Now we've all had the same problem, you see something you really want but your unsure of the sizing, there's nothing worst than denim, ok the waist seems about right, but what about that rise, is it gonna be too short, too long, those hem's are they gonna make me look like Noddy Holder or Max Wall, it's a minefield! It was whilst searching for some guidance for a pair of Samurai's that I happened upon the Denimio website. Wow, the place is a little Aladdin's cave for anyone into their denim and the prices are by far the best I've seen, barring sales, on the internet.   So, I've found the Samurai's I'm looking for but, how much are they gonna shrink by.....yet another dilemma. No worries Denimio also supply one-wash, which takes most if not all of the guess work out of the equation. I've been back another twice since and I've got to say, the service is first class, 3 days delivery from Japan, it put's some of the more established online shops here in the UK to shame!  Anyway, I thought I'd get in touch with Denimo and find out a bit more about them, I contacted Peter,(who does a splendid job and speaks good English btw) who in turn put me in touch with Mahoto, the owner, who although busy putting together a new website and moving to a new bigger premises agreed to answer a few of the questions I put to him.  1) Why did you start Denimio?   I lived in the Netherlands between 2006-2009 and a close friend of mine had been running an online denim shop in Germany. My sister was working as a wedding planner around the same time and had just left the job. I thought it would be better for her to run her own business rather than working for another company as Japan is still a very male-dominated country and many women face difficulty getting a full time position once they get married or have kids. Like in some other countries, there are people in Japan who still believe that ""commitment/loyalty to the company"" is the highest priority one should have, which is perceived to be at odds with getting married and having kids. While speaking about this to my friend in Germany, he casually suggested, ""Why not denim?"" As a big fan of denim myself, that passing suggestion blossomed into a small business plan in my head: my idea was to start a little denim shop catering to Japanese customers and focusing on higher quality denim brands that were in demand. My sister thought the idea was pretty cool, so we went ahead and started what would eventually become Denimio as a tiny shop in our small-town home in Mie prefecture. Fast forward to today: Denimio is selling Japanese denim worldwide and, just this month, we moved to a new 120sqm street-level store in Yokohama. We would have never imagined back then that we would have the chance to do this at this scale. We feel privileged to be helping the Japanese denim brands we love enter new markets and reach their fans around the world.  2) Who uses Denimio?   We currently ship to more than 50 different countries. The majority of our customers are passionate denim lovers, suckers for detail and quality, non-conformist, fashion-savvy guys. They tend to be extremely vocal on social media and forums. These guys fit squarely in the definition of ""Innovators"" and ""Early adaptors"": they try new things and disseminate information to the rest of the market Denimio plays an important role in the global denim community in catering to their thirst for the latest and greatest without them having to break the bank   3) What's new at Denimio?   A couple of cool things happening.   We are launching a new page on Denimio where customers can learn about products directly from other customers. To encourage customer participation, each month Denimo staff will select the best reviews and award the reviewers with Denimio coupons of anywhere from $50~500. We really want to increase this form of information exchange on our website and what better way to do that than by incentivizing people with coupons to buy their favorite items. Customers who have purchased at Denimio in the past are entitled to participate in this and will receive an email from us in the near future. Please make sure to whitelist denimio.com email address so that the information email won't end up in junk mailbox.  Another exciting news is that Union Special 43200G, which we bought last year, finally came back from maintenance. We will be offering hemming service using this super vintage machine.  4) What's the hardest part of running Denimio?  Size consultation is likely the hardest aspect of running Denimio. Japanese manufactures use a different measurement method from that used by most customers worldwide. The size charts on our site are mostly provided by the brands, so they naturally follow the ‚ÄúJapanese method.‚Äù In order to tackle this problem, we are improving our website layout so that customers can see measurements according to both the Japanese and the global standard method.  5) which brands/items do you recommend?  That‚Äôs a very difficult question to answer for me because I‚Äôm living and breathing this stuff on a daily basis. I love the brands we carry for different reasons. Fabric, style, value, details, fades, image, silhouette, you name it: all our brands are truly fantastic in their own way. Thing is, we don‚Äôt carry brands just because we think it‚Äôs good business. We carry them because we love them, would wear them and would definitely recommend them. I know this sounds like a canned answer, but it really isn‚Äôt. Brands approach us all the time but we only choose to carry a minor fraction of them for that same reason.   6) Any message to customers and future customers?   To customers: THANK YOU! We would be nothing without you and your continued support. You are the fuel that keeps us going and we will continue to do everything in our power to make you happy.   To future customers: We know ordering denim and apparel online can be challenging, but give us a shot! We will make the process as easy as possible: we are flexible, can answer any of your questions and our return policies are customer friendly. We can assure you that you won‚Äôt find any other place out there that has the prices we have coupled with a complete focus on making you happy.   7)Would this be only exclusive of Japanese brands?  For the moment, yes. We are a Japanese retailer after all. We are, however, continuously exploring the possibility of expanding beyond that. We are also always in the lookout for other cool fashion products in Japan to make available for the rest of the world at Japanese prices.  8) What is your favourite label?  That‚Äôs another loaded question!  But I guess this one I can answer a bit more specifically since we‚Äôre all entitled to certain preferences. Personally, I really like ONI. The quality of their fabrics is outstanding and there‚Äôs this mysterious aura around the brand that I enjoy. We hear rumblings of a potential newcomer to the Japanese raw denim scene connected to ONI and we‚Äôre doing everything we can to get a hold of them but the only person who knows anything about it is the owner of ONI. It‚Äôs that kind of mystery that I enjoy and I constantly chase.   http://www.denimio.com/"

I think it would lead to every customer really upping their review game. Simply put, reviews on point = more sales. More sales = greater success of retailer, which leads to all kinds of cool shit for everyone involved. Or should, anyway."

rawdenim,3cs1t3,Robocob0,5,Fri Jul 10 11:38:19 2015 UTC,we should see if he'd be willing to do an AMA
rawdenim,3cs1t3,quickly_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:42:14 2015 UTC,denimio seems great!  They need a few more brands and they will probably replace rakuten all together for Japanese purchases :)

rawdenim,3ctp69,bonersaurus-rex,3,Fri Jul 10 18:16:41 2015 UTC,"Dude, this denim does not stretch... at least they haven't in the past 2 weeks that I've been wearing them. I have never  seen a fabric so damn stubborn! God I love them.  Btw, fit looks great. I had them hemmed 2.5 inches longer than my normal slacks inseam. I'm normally a 30"", so I went with a 32.5 to give me room to single cuff (1 inch) with stacks or double cuff with a break. If i really want to go hipster and have ankles show, then I can double cuff bigger. (2 inch double cuffs)."
rawdenim,3ctp69,todayismyluckyday,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:41:27 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that's a little concerning. I appreciate the advice on hemming, I'll try to get it measured and taken in this week"
rawdenim,3ctp69,knaidoo21,2,Sat Jul 11 16:36:14 2015 UTC,"The top block seems a tad snug, but I'm sure it'll stretch out to a comfortable size once the denim breaks in. Overall looks like an awesome fit to me. Hope you like these."

rawdenim,3cpqgz,magalingpo,12,Thu Jul 9 20:10:42 2015 UTC,The same cut can look significantly different on different people.
rawdenim,3cpqgz,Salsa_Z5,2,Thu Jul 9 20:18:38 2015 UTC,Very true. Probably just kicking myself because my 555 is starting to become too small for me.   Started to lift weights (used to just run before) and my thighs are starting to stretch the Denim considerably. =|
rawdenim,3cpqgz,magalingpo,2,Thu Jul 9 21:39:34 2015 UTC,"The best advice I got from fit was from Iron Heart, measure your actual waist, and use their size chart. 30"" waist was my perfect fit.  They were a little tight at first, but have stretched comfortably out."
rawdenim,3cpqgz,magalingpo,3,Thu Jul 9 21:17:39 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah for sure, Giles and his crew have some of the best customer service around IMO.  IIRC they'll measure their largest or smallest pair at your size to find the one that would fit the best for you.  The 555 were a perfect fit when I first bought them but my thighs have been getting bigger due to squats."
rawdenim,3cpqgz,marv0723,2,Thu Jul 9 21:51:28 2015 UTC,"+1. I had a great experience with them. Like you said, they took the time to measure each pair in my size to find the ones with the closest measurements for me. It's like having jeans custom tailored."
rawdenim,3cpqgz,sleepauger,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:41:54 2015 UTC,I'm thinking my next pair will be some 777s. Pretty similar fit to the 6's but a little narrower through the calves.

rawdenim,3cpqgz,babyhands1,2,Thu Jul 9 21:15:56 2015 UTC,They look like they've gotten to a perfect point of comfort and color. What was your washing regiment like?
rawdenim,3cpqgz,babyhands1,2,Thu Jul 9 23:55:21 2015 UTC,"First wash about nine months in, warm wash, woolite dark and hung dry. Next wash was about another nine or so months. Just washed again. More of a soak in the tub with woolite dark and scrubbed lightly with a nylon brush to work the dirt and grime out. I was pretty pleased on how they came out."
rawdenim,3cpqgz,blasphemistActavist,2,Fri Jul 10 00:29:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation! Yeah, I'd say they look pretty great too! I'm sure they have tons of life still left in them."
rawdenim,3cpqgz,PatrickCassidy23,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:40:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Iron Heart makes a product to last. Before I got them I was getting APCs once a year, since they wore so fast. But these still have a couple of years of active wear in them for sure."

rawdenim,3csytg,illcutz,4,Fri Jul 10 14:59:21 2015 UTC,It has a certain amount of slub.
rawdenim,3csytg,discrepancies,2,Fri Jul 10 15:09:31 2015 UTC,Anyone coming to the launch tonight? Seems like a more tapered fit from them.
rawdenim,3csytg,captoe_slim,2,Fri Jul 10 15:00:52 2015 UTC,"It has a strong taper, but a longer inseam than a typical pair of sanforized jeans. It will lose some of the taper once they are hemmed."
rawdenim,3csytg,rivetandhide,2,Fri Jul 10 16:30:26 2015 UTC,"The taper is not particularly strong and the hem width if hemmed to 34"" would be the same"
rawdenim,3csytg,Josie1234,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:52:25 2015 UTC,"Really odd fit just by looking at the pics and measurements.  Tallish front rise which I like but sub 14"" back rise is less than the common 32 size 10/14 split.  Then the inseam is super long which would encourage me to lay on the stack but the taper really isn't enough for that to look clean 17cm style."
rawdenim,3csytg,Robocob0,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:02:48 2015 UTC,"Damn, really liking the fit buy the price tag is too high for me right now. I've been looking for something similar to this for a while though, good taper and long inseam... Maybe around August for my bday I'll treat myself if they still have sizes left."

rawdenim,3cr6rs,Ramachandrann,3,Fri Jul 10 04:09:49 2015 UTC,I hope so. I've been talking with my pop a lot recently and a woman I work with who is doing an MBA/PhD program and I think I'd be really happy doing that.

rawdenim,3cr6rs,BenjaminReilly,9,Fri Jul 10 16:15:43 2015 UTC,heading home to DC this weekend for a 2 day Indian wedding should be fun as hell. Plus all the Indian food that will be consumed is going to be of epic proportions.   Then next weekend I'll be in Utah to hike in Zion nat'l park. Probably going to do bottom up Narrows then head to Bryce Canyon.   THEN the Global r/rawdenim Regional Meetup is happening the weekend after.
rawdenim,3cr6rs,ryanxedge,3,Fri Jul 10 03:13:59 2015 UTC,"Damn dude, we're a week apart...   I did Bryce the past few days, obviously from my current GD post I'm out at Zion right now.

rawdenim,3cr6rs,BenjaminReilly,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:31:25 2015 UTC,Only for a weekend unfortunately. I'll definitely reach out though

rawdenim,3cr6rs,blockdmyownshot,6,Fri Jul 10 03:55:19 2015 UTC,"Woah I'm actually on time for one of these but I guess it's the super late Thursday one. So I've been to all the raw denim spots in Seoul that are on rawrdenim and blues man was so sick I heard they could speak English but no one spoke English to me there... But no matter they had so much inventory they had an American denim side then their back was all Japanese and naked and famous and they had a back shelf with sliding shelves just to house all the denim they had I loved it. Couldn't afford any of it but I loved it. I was hoping some of the Japanese brands would be a little cheaper here but no luck.   Other than that haven't done much else in Korea except eat a lot and I visited the southern coast the other day. Also some of the malls here are sick they've got Maison kitsune, apc, Norse projects, Barbour, and a bunch of streetwear brands all together. Once again couldn't afford anything but it was dope. BIG con though it's really annoying trying to shop in Korea the associates follow you and hound you the entire time I get it's a different culture type thing but man I've never realized how annoying it is to have someone tail you while you're just looking around."
rawdenim,3cr6rs,ryanxedge,2,Fri Jul 10 03:06:28 2015 UTC,Sounds rad man. I wish I had been into raw denim when I visited Japan a few years ago. East Asia is such a rad place to be if you're into this kinda stuff.
rawdenim,3cr6rs,blockdmyownshot,3,Fri Jul 10 03:09:29 2015 UTC,Yeah all the stores that specialize in raws have been small and tucked away but I see a lot of selvedge here could be just random jeans throwing it on or uniqlo but it's kinda cool. Definitely see way more than when I'm back at home in stl. It's interesting I'd say I'm pretty fashionable back home but here a lot of dudes kill it and have great hair makes me feel inadequate haha. But then there are also some weird trends popular here like crocs with charms in them... Don't get that one at all. Also I see dudes walking around in sweaters and it's been hot as hell here I don't get it.
rawdenim,3cr6rs,ryanxedge,3,Fri Jul 10 03:12:34 2015 UTC,"I never see selvedge here in Wisconsin. Hell, really anywhere in the US haha.  I got the same vibe when I was in Japan. I wasn't as into fashion or anything a few years back but I could definitely appreciate the aesthetic that nearly everybody had going on. It was awesome."
rawdenim,3cr6rs,blockdmyownshot,2,Fri Jul 10 03:22:10 2015 UTC,Haha I have a friend in Milwaukee that I got into raws and now he texts me whenever he sees someone with selvedge. Which isn't very often.
rawdenim,3cr6rs,ryanxedge,2,Fri Jul 10 03:27:22 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there is a bit going on in Milwaukee. In fact, I know there is because there are a few people from MKE on here/instagram that I follow. But I'm south of Milwaukee right on the the WI/IL border, and there is definitely no raw denim going on around here. Never seen any at my university either, besides me own."

rawdenim,3cr6rs,gravrain,2,Fri Jul 10 06:50:25 2015 UTC,I had my lab blocked off for the entire time. Well until halfway through the last question when a grad student decided to ignore my sign on the door and come in talking really loud on hey phone and in general making a ton of noise. So I kinda panicked and rushed through the last fifteen seconds or so.
rawdenim,3cr6rs,btharveyku08,3,Fri Jul 10 13:12:03 2015 UTC,"That seems ... like a company if avoid working for, if I had the flexibility. There's just a fundamental disconnect with doing that.

rawdenim,3cr6rs,gravrain,2,Fri Jul 10 05:41:43 2015 UTC,"It seems like a cool position but the company has a lot of churn. It is however in a favorable location that I can use to springboard locally. But yeah, as soon as I got the HireVue email I kinda felt like not even going through with it."
rawdenim,3cr6rs,btharveyku08,2,Fri Jul 10 13:09:06 2015 UTC,"Right. Just seems like it would immediately send a message like ""Come work for us, a place where we put zero value into inter-personal interaction!"" Just a weird first impression."
rawdenim,3cr6rs,gravrain,2,Fri Jul 10 15:53:38 2015 UTC,Yep. And the thing is that I already submitted an app through their Taleo hiring site. So I have to go through two computer elimination steps before I speak to a person? Oh well.

Went a month with pretty much no contact, then slept with her, then she stopped talking to me again, so I haven't bothered trying to contact her either. But it's still hard and even though I'm doing a bit better, it still definitely hurts a lot some days. No contact is just such a weird thing with somebody you're used to being in touch with all of the time. Even after a few months here most of the time I still feel really off not talking to her."

Edit: anyone know if IHSH-92 (or sexual chocolate at SE) is considered sashiko? The new RgT sashiko shirt uses a similar looking fabric.

rawdenim,3cr6rs,youngofthesoonest,2,Fri Jul 10 05:03:20 2015 UTC,"At this time as far as I know there isn't a plan to offer sashiko repairs at SESF and I believe the sashiko repair isn't actually offered at SENY...it's just that Wes, who works at SENY, does it on the side. The focus of the repair services at SESF and other self edge stores is still to provide the best repair we can do on a pair of jeans which is darning. Sashiko, while it looks cool, it's not as solid of a repair so it just doesn't fit under what the focus is."

Honestly, there's not too much to it (it's literally the simplest possible stitch you can do), just make sure you set aside enough time and don't rush it. You can stock up on fancy supplies like I did, or just use whatever needle, thread, and scrap fabric you have handy."

rawdenim,3cr6rs,Moenyourlawn,3,Fri Jul 10 16:26:08 2015 UTC,So do any of you know how to make a wallet or some shit out of raw denim? I unfortunately bought the copper NF when they first dropped and I absolutely hate them and nobody's gonna buy these fucking things. Would be kind of cool to ship them to somebody who could repurpose them into something for me and then they can keep the rest if they want idk. Really bummed but whatever I've moved onto bigger and better things (Railcars).
rawdenim,3cr6rs,RawOwyn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:15:28 2015 UTC,"Im in the same situation man, except I got mine during the barneys sale. I'm basically keeping mine to wear them in the pride parade. I've experimented with making wallets before but never got a solid concrete pattern down."
rawdenim,3cr6rs,Moenyourlawn,2,Fri Jul 10 05:20:24 2015 UTC,"It just sucks because I had read so much about them and they looked so good online and I really liked the idea of them. Then they came and it was like BAM, but being the optimist I am I figured I'd wear them and hope it wouldn't be too bad....I wore them 7 times and I won't let them touch my body again."
rawdenim,3cr6rs,RawOwyn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:25:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't even tried mine on. I really liked the idea as well, I just had no idea they would be so shiny. I ordered my pair before all the warnings and pictures and videos came out. I really like the patch though. I may end up taking mine off and ""repurposing"" it for something. When you think about it the fabric is really amazing. It's just that a pair of jeans made out of it is a bit too hard to wear for most people."
rawdenim,3cr6rs,Moenyourlawn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:31:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess you live and learn, that's life and all that jazz. What do you think you could do with that patch?

rawdenim,3cr6rs,RawOwyn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:35:06 2015 UTC,"I was considering sewing it onto the back of the N&F jacket I just bought, or sewing it onto my Gustin duffle on one of the ends. Haven't really decided. I've always liked their logo, I wouldn't mind rocking it somewhere a little more obvious than the waistband of my jeans."
rawdenim,3cr6rs,Moenyourlawn,2,Fri Jul 10 05:38:19 2015 UTC,I think I'm gonna start taking the patch off of Jeans I'm retiring or just entirely done with. A little collection to remember my pairs and what not
rawdenim,3cr6rs,RawOwyn,2,Fri Jul 10 05:41:17 2015 UTC,"The other cool thing about taking the patch off of jeans is that most of the time, if the patch is completely stitched down, some of the original colour of the denim may still be there. It can be cool to see just how much it's changed since the beginning, especially if you don't have hem scraps to compare to."

I picked up a brand new N&F jacket on sale for ~$78 USD yesterday. Featherweight type 3 with a bomber jacket collar on it, so far its the perfect weight for the summer. I've pretty much stopped wearing jeans now in favor of my jorts or regular shorts.  Next week I start working almost full time @ 32 hours per week, so that's gonna be a big change for me. Ive been working half that every week for the last 5 months. The one thing I'm looking forward to is the extra money; I'm hoping to save up to fix the radiator & buy new tires for my granddads cordoba so I can actually drive it."

It's pretty messed up still from a fall back in Boulder, plus I pulled something in my hip lifting up a duffel bag, and hiking everyday is just worsening an ongoing knee issue, but whatever....tomorrow will be my last real day of hiking so I'm just gonna tough it out. Been posting lots of pics on Instagram, too.    Also - what the hell is going on with the ""Global Meetup"" in Chicago in a few weeks???? I'll be free to come down on that Sunday, but haven't seen any concrete information on this thing....."

Gonna start at The Grotto, do Angel's Landing first, take the shuttle out to the end of the park to Temple of Sinawava, and then hike a couple miles in The Narrows, see how I'm doing on time, and turn around whenever it seems pertinent to do so! I'm trying to be back in Springdale by dark so I can get some sushi.  You have any idea what will be going on on Sunday for the meetup?

rawdenim,3cr6rs,WhatFuture210,2,Fri Jul 10 05:49:18 2015 UTC,"I'm into lots of things! I definitely want to go sightseeing, explore nature, try out some local food, and hit up some good bars. Maybe go swing dancing if there's a venue up there. I'll look up any suggestion you might have!"
rawdenim,3cr6rs,hanger,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:07:05 2015 UTC,"How long are you here for? Will you have a car here? There is lots of good hiking in the front range right on the edge of Anchorage. Depending on how strenuous of  a hike you want you could head to Willawaw lakes or summit O'Malley peak. If you've got a car you should definitely head down Turnagain Arm (dubbed one of the most scenic drives in the US). There is a lot of good hiking along the arm too.  Food-wise Anchorage may leave a little bit to be desired. Our most popular food seems to be pizza (Moose's tooth and Bear's tooth are good). For more exotic fare The Bubbly Mermaid is a cool Oyster and Champagne bar or you can hit up Simon & Seaforts (expensive) for happy hour and get some great seafood. Humpy's also has some pretty good (and much more reasonably priced) salmon dishes.  For bars if you're into swing dancing I'd definitely check and see if there are any bluegrass shows at the Taproot while you're up here. It is a good venue with a great beer selection and there is frequently swing dancing (mostly two stepping) there. While you're there you can head down Spenard st to the Buckaroo Club if you decide you want more of a bar atmosphere. The Buck is pretty popular among the younger crowd and can get a little rowdy.  There is actually a pretty good brewery scene here too if you are into that. I'd recommend checking out Midnight Sun, King St, and Anchorage Brewing Company.  Let me know if you have any more questions."

rawdenim,3cohd1,Freakazoid911,18,Thu Jul 9 14:29:06 2015 UTC,"They look a size big to me, mostly noticeable in the crotch, the knees, below the knee, but it's nothing too bad. Getting them hemmed might help them look less big."
rawdenim,3cohd1,Preconscious,3,Thu Jul 9 15:12:38 2015 UTC,"They look way too big to me, but that's just my opinion."
rawdenim,3cohd1,time_again,2,Fri Jul 10 11:49:10 2015 UTC,"Is there any way I could get them tailored to the right size, or is it even worth messing with?"
rawdenim,3cohd1,clt3,5,Thu Jul 9 15:14:15 2015 UTC,"Self Edge and Railcar offers hemming. If you don't care about chainstitching you can go to any alterations shop as well. I think it'd look better with a hem, especially around the cuff area, but if you like it then you should just stick with it."
rawdenim,3cohd1,DrMango,2,Thu Jul 9 15:19:30 2015 UTC,Piggyback question: what are some reasons I might care about chain stitching? To me it seems like a very small and insignificant aspect of the pants. Does the stitch look nicer to most eyes? Is it more durable?   Sorry if I sound naive but this is something I've been wondering for a while now.
rawdenim,3cohd1,clt3,3,Thu Jul 9 15:57:54 2015 UTC,"It's the way jeans used to be made. If you look at the hems of vintage jeans, they all rope and fade a certain way. Most people either care about the details or likes the way it looks. As insignificant as things are, people who are into denim, especially higher end ones made in Japan, these details are important. Whether it be the single silver thread that entwines the selvedge of Samurai jeans or the way the iron buttons on jeans rust on Flat Heads, these things show attention to detail and the effort they put into their products."
rawdenim,3cohd1,youngofthesoonest,2,Thu Jul 9 16:10:18 2015 UTC,There is an aesthetic difference between a single needle stitch and a chainstitch. example  BUT the reason to seek out chain stitching is if you can get the jeans hemmed on a Union Special 43200G which is a particular model that had a design defect that creates something called a roping effect which is the 45 degree puckering at the hem that was a very common thing in vintage jeans and became a desired part of jeans especially ones that are supposed to pay homage to vintage jeans. There are other chain stitching machines out there (the union special 43200G was discontinued in the 80s) but none really create this effect although you can manipulate a machine to do this but it's not a common practice.
rawdenim,3cohd1,AlpineSensation,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:37:14 2015 UTC,"The signle needle stitch is actually more reliable. A broken/loose thread on chainstitch may unravel the whole thing easily. However, mosy ppl care more about the look and so-called ‚Äúauthenticity‚Äù than anything else."
rawdenim,3cohd1,B3NLADI4,-3,Thu Jul 9 21:37:18 2015 UTC,"Think about resale value also.  If six months down the road if you decide you want to sell, most potential buyers would probably want an original chainstitched hem."
rawdenim,3cohd1,Preconscious,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:48:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as the other person who replied said, I think a hem would help. You could hem so that there isn't as much break and a thinner cuff and it would look slimmer imo."

rawdenim,3cpaco,JonNYBlazinAzN,2,Fri Jul 10 02:37:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan! My favorite features are the Talon zipper and the canvas pocket bags. They really make the construction feel solid. I don't wear them as much as I should because, if I'm being honest, I don't like how slant pockets look on me (not specific to these jeans) as much as stitiched rounded pockets (i.e., standard jeans front pockets) and I also have a pretty full rotation right now (including a great pair of Oldblue Co.'s Heavy Weight Edition).   I did get them from this site. Relevant info from my post about my HWEs:   As, I've noted in other threads, beware of the alluring prices on the Oldblue website, those really only apply if your shipping address is in Indonesia. When I bought my Type IIs, I originally thought it was a PayPal issue (gouging me on the exchange rate) but when I e-mailed Oldblue to let them know, Yax (the main dude) sent me this reply:  ""actually we also set the based currency higher than the actual exchange rate. so the price for abroad market is indeed higher than the local customer. what made me do it is that we also being charged for every paypal transaction occur in the web, ranging from 5-10%, i dont know whether paypal will also charge the buyer or not though. and also we usually have to pay more for shipping cost to our abroad customers. because if the package is just over 100 grams, the shipping cost will be rounded up. thats just how the indonesia post office system works here. and it really often happens. with our relatively low price range, we just can not afford that kind of loss anymore. i hope you understand with this matter. [...]""  The Type IIs are listed at IDR 1,650,000 which is currently $165 but once they applied the exchange rate through PayPal as described above, they cost me $210.00.    Note that they are currently on sale so a bit cheaper now.  EDIT: Yes, I'm in NYC."

rawdenim,3cotl5,soothsayer_,4,Thu Jul 9 16:01:05 2015 UTC,ALBUM  Fun with leather and lasers! Starting to dial in my process and settings for lasercutting different leathers. So far this 3/4oz hermann oak veg tan has had the best results. The biggest problems when working with leather is it tends to not want to lay completely flat. Having an uneven terrain throws the laser out of focus a little and thats where you get crappy burn marks. I originally cut 4 of these but on the 4th one the leather was curling so bad it basically burnt the entire wallet (RIP).

rawdenim,3cotl5,HarryGBoi,2,Thu Jul 9 19:48:54 2015 UTC,"I operate a couple laser cutters as a hobbyist, and from my experience you will usually draw up a design as a vector or such file in a software such as Corel Draw or even Microsoft Publisher and then it is just a matter of pushing it to the cutter via the printer's software and it goes.   The cutters I have used all allow for manual readjusting of the bed height as well as laser intensity (or power) and speed.  They're really quite fun and they force you to look at design problems from a different mindset of only having 2 dimensions that you can cut in. Really fun stuff, truly."
rawdenim,3cotl5,soothsayer_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:54:34 2015 UTC,Its a giant machine that looks like this with a computer attached to it. You can use CAD software I just use adobe illustrator to draft my designs. You assign certain stroke and color features to the parts you want to engrave vs cut and play with the speed and power settings. After that the machine times it for you and does the rest.
rawdenim,3cotl5,turbospartan,2,Thu Jul 9 19:58:01 2015 UTC,"So do you work for a company then, or did you buy this laser cutter yourself?  I thought I recall seeing a new desktop style laser cutter, similar in size to like the desktop 3D printers"

First Wallet: Italian Whiskey Shell Cordovan Exterior with Light Tan Baby Calf Interior. Natural 0.6mm Tiger thread. Brown painted edges. Second Wallet: Horween #8 Shell Cordovan Exterior with Ilcea Cognac Kangaroo Interior. Natural 0.6mm Tiger thread. Brown painted edges. This one also has a nice big Shell Cordovan stamp on the interior. The kangaroo is such a unique and interesting leather. Really thin but incredibly tough and resilient. Third Wallet: Black Shinki Hikaku Shell Cordovan Exterior, Black Baby Calf Interior, 0.6mm Black Tiger thread, black painted edges.  Also picked up some Sokoto Goatskin. This stuff is going to be great for wallets. It is really thin but has a very nice, firm temper since it is veg tan. It actually burnishes on its own pretty well too. I'm starting to get a ton of unique leathers beyond the standard Horween that It'll be fun to start doing some more color matching.

rawdenim,3cnvyd,thorozofo,6,Thu Jul 9 10:53:00 2015 UTC,"I bought these back in March when they were 40% off and planned to do a full review but never got around to it. Here's the quick version:  The description on jcrew.com is terrible, but I bought them anyway figuring I could always return them.  First, fit: They're slim, but not super slim. These are vanity sized, so ignore the official description. I bought tag size 33, they measured 17.5 across in the waist pre-wash, and 17 post-wash. More prewash measurements: 10.75 front rise, 7.75"" cuff opening, and 36.5"" inseam. I'm pretty sure they've stretched back out to their original waist measurement. Sorry I don't have more thigh or knee measurements -- but evidently I have bigger thighs and they're wearable unlike a pair of 3sixteen SL's I tried on.  The only other unsanforized pair I have is 501 STF. This denim is much nicer -- it got bumpy after a soak and is pretty soft now. The weave is fairly tight but there is a tiny amount of vertical grain in places to make it interesting. Overall, probably close to Momotaro denim on the denim spectrum (but I've never owned a pair). They seem to be fading OK so far -- faster than my Gustin Superheavy.  Finally, I really like the shape of the rivets. Both parts are visible and it looks like a square nail was punched through and then cut off. Also, they're evidently supposed to rust over time -- A couple of mine were had a slight patina out of the bag.  [edit: rivets!]"

I really like their short sleeve polka dot shirt but it looks a bit too retro to be worn regularly in a university setting so I decided against it.   I would put the shirts in the same tier as Gitman Bros based on a quick inspection (I own a Gitman but only tried on Orgeuil at the store). Also Orgeuil features typical Japanese construction details like chainstitch runoffs.   As for T-Shirts, these are circular knitted (but probably not loopwheeled). Material is solid quality cotton that are thicker than Uniqlo tees but obviously not as thick as Iron Heart heavyweights. Sizing is weird just like SDA t-shirts. Different lots are sized differently so it honestly depends on the lot if you should go for an M or an L if your average US size is an M. Lastly, the fit is neither too boxy nor too slim and the armhole is about average, kinda like Uniqlos."
rawdenim,3clq34,bluefour,52,Wed Jul 8 21:57:51 2015 UTC,"Myth Reality    Myth: Washing jeans ruins fades False! Washing jeans in moderation can actually lead to pretty amazing all-over fades, and generally helps the durability of jeans. Note: Frequent washing will reduce the potential for high-contrast fades.   Myth: Washing jeans ruins jeans False! Washing jeans actually helps keep your jeans intact. Grime and dirt can build up between fibers, and accelerate degradation. Plus, please wash your pants when they get dirty. Please.   Myth: You should size down (xxx) in order to wear _______ Maybe! Compare measurements from a reputable source, and take measurements of your best-fitting pants. Bear in mind different fabrics stretch or shrink in different ways   Myth: Freezing jeans makes them smell better/kills bacteria/is better than washing False! It makes your jeans cold.   Myth: You must only use Woolite Black when washing jeans Maybe! You should try to find a detergent that lacks optical brighteners and bleaches. Woolite Dark is a reasonably common variety of detergent that hits this criteria.   Myth: You can't use a washing machine to wash raws Maybe! The real culprit behind this myth is the spin cycle, which in some washers can cause a marbling or creasing effect. Avoid this by pulling out before the spin begins, or turn your jeans inside out to minimize risk.   Myth: Ocean washing jeans leads to siqq fadez! False! This basically just sandblasts your jeans. However, it comes at the cost of cleanliness and durability. Salt from the water will ""saw"" at the cotton, leading to accelerated blowouts, and sea micro-critters will make your pants smell like a harbor at low tide.   Myth: More expensive --> More better False! There are a lot of reasons to buy an expensive pair of jeans. The fabric, details, fit, heritage, etc. However, there's a distinct diminishing return once you get into raws, and there is no such thing as an objectively better pair of jeans, the more money you spend.    This was kind of fun. Let me know if there are some other good ones!"

rawdenim,3clq34,Teamster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:29:22 2015 UTC,"Myth: Freezing jeans makes them smell better/kills bacteria/is better than washing   There might be some truth to this, caveat being that you are examining the jeans in the short term after ""freezing"". The lower temperature will reduce the amount of scent molecules that are volatilized. The reduced number of stank-ecules will make the jeans seem like they have less BO, and their number will rise as the temperature of the jeans also rises making them more stanky. So cold, stinky jeans should stink less than the same ambient temp, stinky jeans."
rawdenim,3clq34,gravrain,2,Thu Jul 9 20:24:05 2015 UTC,"Interesting; in this case, would you say there is some merit to the myth? My gut tells me that most people who abide this myth tend to believe it is a replacement for washing."
rawdenim,3clq34,Teamster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:26:54 2015 UTC,"Of course its a myth. Freezing your stinky jeans is only going to make them cold, keeping whatever body odor causing stuff to stay on the cotton fibers, and putting any bacteria into a statis state. Freezing won't clean your jeans, but in the very short term they might smell better. Even if they have that weird freezer smell rather than smelling like ass.   I was mainly being facetious. I'm waiting for a call from the hiring manager from my interview yesterday and getting annoyed. She emailed me at 4 am this morning telling me to get in touch with her anytime today and then I haven't heard back at all on my scheduling attempts for a convo. So it made me cranky and I typed that."
rawdenim,3clq34,gravrain,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:36:14 2015 UTC,I assumed as you did and assumed that freezing basically stopped them dead until it heated up again. Apparently it does kill a lot of the bacteria to do so. Just not all.
rawdenim,3clq34,trylliana,2,Mon Jul 20 13:11:05 2015 UTC,A typical freezer won't get cold enough to kill bacteria on your pants

rawdenim,3clq34,gravrain,0,Fri Jul 10 15:09:44 2015 UTC,To some degree it will cause ice crystals to rupture bacteria but mostly it will cause the bacteria to lie dormant.
rawdenim,3clq34,Robocob0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:16:10 2015 UTC,"I always thought that the freezer killed some of the bacteria due to the shock (besides slowing down all metabolic processes and forcing bacteria to encapsulate and go dormant).  There must be some reason that this ""myth"" continues to be so prevalent. In addition to what you have said, I think in some cases the bacteria are unable to adapt and do eventually die off or are unable to reproduce afterwards."
rawdenim,3clq34,StPauli,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:21:47 2015 UTC,"Most home freezers only go down to what? -20 or -25 ¬∞C? And I'm pretty sure that the freezing process is slow enough that bacteria will realize it and do something to protect themselves. Some species not particularly adapted to the cold might be killed off, but there are plenty of others there that will remain, but even those should die off from lack of food in some small fraction.  It would be a cool idea to do this as an experiment though. Get some denim (I still have some that I use for experiments like this laying around) nice and stanky and then freeze them for several times periods and then do a swab and culture whatever comes out. I'll think about this."

rawdenim,3clq34,magalingpo,7,Wed Jul 8 22:18:08 2015 UTC,"You changed from myths to what I assume you believe is a truth, or do you think less washing is key for better fades?"
rawdenim,3clq34,Preconscious,4,Wed Jul 8 23:46:08 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the correct answer lies in the middle. Some denim requires washing to lose indigo and if you try and go too long without a wash, you'll stress the fabric to the point of a blowout before you ever get any fades. I had this happen with my OG pair of 3sixteens before they switched to Kaihara denim.  Washing like a normal person (every 2-3 wears) is going to be bad for fades too. There's an old guy in my office who's not into raw denim, but he ended up buying a pair of Momotaros while he was in Japan. He's washed them into a ""dad jean"" shade, though there are some discernable legit fades left."
rawdenim,3clq34,gngstrMNKY,2,Thu Jul 9 00:28:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I would speculate that the crucial element is actually setting the creases, rather than waiting some arbitrary amount of time. Beyond a few months, abstinence from washing probably has diminishing returns for most types of denim."
rawdenim,3clq34,gavin280,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:21:28 2015 UTC,Interesting. I've always been thinking there was a min amount of wears that should be obtained before washing. I think my gustin indigos have those honeycombs already set but it's been discouraging since I'm not getting as high a contrast as I would've liked. Do you think I should give them a wash? It doesn't smell or anything
rawdenim,3clq34,deathbycheezburger,2,Thu Jul 9 19:05:54 2015 UTC,"Nah, wait until they smell or get visibly dirty beyond hope of simple spot cleaning. You still need a certain amount of wear to loosen the indigo. My point was more that beyond a certain point, you aren't gaining anything by wearing stinky jeans."
rawdenim,3clq34,gavin280,4,Thu Jul 9 20:30:21 2015 UTC,"Good point. I guess what I meant is that there is a preconceived notion by individuals getting into raw denim that the less they wash their jeans the ""better"" it would become.  I personally believe in the mantra ""If it gets dirty, smelly, funky etc. Wash em"""
rawdenim,3clq34,magalingpo,9,Thu Jul 9 00:08:47 2015 UTC,"freezing jeans kill bacteria... low temperatures should place them in a dormant stage but it is not an effective method to kill them.

rawdenim,3ckkg2,Irenarch,3,Wed Jul 8 17:12:36 2015 UTC,"Looks neat. Sometimes I forget how crazy the vanity sizing is for women's pants, though - the size 27 has a 32"" pre-stretch waist(?!?!)."
rawdenim,3ckkg2,cocksure_whistler,8,Wed Jul 8 18:08:21 2015 UTC,"A size 27 generally corresponds to a woman's waist, which is smaller than where jeans sit. It's not really analogous to men's waist sizing. They would be much closer if they were high-waisted.   I don't know why they started using waist sizing and not dress sizes, but it's really taken over in the past 8-10 years. I bought a pair of size 6s at the Levi's store in 2008. If I were to go back now, a similar model would be labeled a 28. It's probably because of designer jeans like Seven, Joe's, Citizen's of Humanity became popular and they did it. Why they did it, I don't know."
rawdenim,3ckkg2,doublewoodus,2,Wed Jul 8 19:01:40 2015 UTC,"@Irenarch: agreed, its a constant sizing dilemma we hv for women jeans. given the fabrics is unwashed; we tried to 'upsize' it a little over for this 1st batch and test the water initially. the gals in the site photos wore W26, just for ref. cheers mate."
rawdenim,3ckkg2,goldiiloxxx,4,Wed Jul 8 18:22:03 2015 UTC,"Actually am I thinking the size chart on this one may be legit. I think the number 27 may be referring to the ""natural"" waist measurement. The natural waist (for women at least) is determined by the smallest part of the middle (usually around where the belly button is). These jeans are a medium rise so they will not be worn at the natural waist but instead a few inches down. Typically most women curve out from the waist so as the rise is lowered the actual waist band would get larger. If these jeans were high rise I would expect a size 27 to have a 27ish waistband. But since they are only medium rise it is not out of the ordinary for the waistband to be 32 inches. On men's jeans the waistband is pretty much the same size as the natural waist (look at the chart on the site for men's denim and you will only see a 1 inch difference rather than 5). This is because men tend to to be square-ish. The sizing is a little different from what men are used to but is probably not really what should be considered vanity sizing. Just my thoughts. I am new to the craft denim club but I do have a bit of (clothing) pattern drafting experience. I am always thrilled to find women's pants sized by measurement rather than the standard 2,4,6,8,10 nonsense sizes."

rawdenim,3ckkg2,Sandyman99,2,Wed Jul 8 19:08:01 2015 UTC,"thx for the comparison. when we designed this pair, we want it to still look sleek & slender.

rawdenim,3ckkg2,doublewoodus,3,Wed Jul 8 19:44:39 2015 UTC,"So I just tried these on this past weekend and was pretty disappointed. I have a pair of The Ten by Baldwin so I was looking for a cut that would be more relaxed and less skinny throughout the legs.   The denim itself feels great and everything, but the cut is way off. It's not really a boyfriend fit, I'd say it's closer to skinny. I tried on a 26 first since that's my usual size in denim and it was way too big. Going down to size 25 was a better fit overall, but it still left a huge gap in my waist. Like 2 inches. I had really wanted them to work. :(  I just wanted to put this out there in case anyone is wanting to order online! I'd definitely recommend trying these on first."

Our BF jeans isn't a relax cut per se, the main diff compared w/ our skinny is more room on the hip (and fabrics, apparently =). i will def take ur comment on future development. making sure the fit works after brking in, is always a challenge, but I hear you. For our BF jean, I wud suggest def get a size that the waist is extremely tight (almost can't button the top). Cheers"

rawdenim,3cpn7z,unceunceunce,4,Thu Jul 9 20:41:28 2015 UTC,"When those jeans are selling for $200 and really aren't worth I don't mind if they get under cut.  I love my pair of 16oz kickstarter RPMWest jeans, I wouldn't hesitate to buy these if you know you like the cut."
rawdenim,3cpn7z,needuhLee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:53:20 2015 UTC,Same. I got a pair of their double indigo slim when they were on sale for only $69 I'm really liking them. Been wearing for a month or so and looking forward to the fades.
rawdenim,3cpn7z,LimousineAndAPeetzah,0,Sat Jul 11 02:53:18 2015 UTC,"You're missing my point here. I'm not saying the jeans aren't worth it, I'm saying their business practice of basically saying, ""Hey, you see those New Standards by APC? Well, they suck. We have a better version for them for less money."" Seems kind of unethical. They could literally say anything else when describing their jeans besides using the APC name."
rawdenim,3cpn7z,unceunceunce,9,Thu Jul 9 21:25:36 2015 UTC,"I really have no problem with it. A ton of people have a problem with APC and their rising prices and lessening quality, so they're just marketing to their target demographic."
rawdenim,3cpn7z,Willy156,5,Thu Jul 9 22:49:17 2015 UTC,This. My friend always wanted a pair of APC but they've risen their prices basically every 2-3 years and cost $210 at my locals. This might be a good alternative for my friend.
rawdenim,3cpn7z,admiralblue,4,Fri Jul 10 00:58:50 2015 UTC,"As easy as it is to hate on a brand, it's better to have peace and chalk it up to the fact that it's just not your thing. At the end of the day, it's still a business and it's hard to fault them when there are people who are purchasing their jeans.  EDIT: APC is not too different in their own way in terms of chasing profits. In recent years they've sacrificed quality, cut costs, and raised prices...but they'll keep doing what they're doing because people continue to buy their stuff."
rawdenim,3cpn7z,Robocob0,5,Thu Jul 9 20:21:17 2015 UTC,I have no issues with them making an APC clone but to FLAT OUT call it an APC clone and use that as part of the advertising is pretty sketchy. Could have just been called Japanese new standard or something that hints at the APC fit and denim

Did they start sourcing from Japan at some later point? You'd think they would have an exclusive on it since it was made to their spec."
rawdenim,3cpn7z,d_wilson123,4,Thu Jul 9 19:58:11 2015 UTC,"APC has always played it close to the chest with their fabric.  I highly doubt RPMWest knows where APC sources their fabric from and just found some similar looking fabric with a similar looking ID and said ""Yep thats it."""

rawdenim,3cpn7z,monsoon4,3,Thu Jul 9 22:44:38 2015 UTC,The only reason I pay for APC is due to their killer fits.
rawdenim,3cpn7z,rpmwest,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:55:57 2015 UTC,"I really only see the one style of jeans on their website where they say ""(APC)"" and which they describe as ""This an improved replica of APC brand jeans."" I agree that for me personally, I would rather just get an original than purchase a replica, so I don't see that as being effective advertising, and they should probably just describe them on their own merit. But at the same time, they have many other styles that don't mention APC and it's not what they are completely about. I don't know them from the Kickstarter days, so I'm just basing my opinion on what I've seen lately. Maybe I'm a bit biased, because I've emailed them a couple of times, and they are extremely nice and responsive, but I'm not mad at them for trying to live their denim dream."
rawdenim,3cpn7z,monsoon4,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:10:01 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, Manuel from RPMWEST here. Just wanted to clarify/comment on a couple things:  First off, regardless if you are pro/anti our Japanese Classic (APC) we really do appreciate the feedback. Not just saying this to sound politically correct, whenever we get ""free"" honest feedback, it's always a plus.   Before starting the brand we surveyed the landscape of premium raw denim jeans. We appreciated APC for their fit/fabric. After starting the brand a lot of our initial customers would ask (paraphrasing) ""how do these compare to APC?""  A while back we came across the same fabric they use in their jeans (it's available for anyone to buy, you just have to find it). That's when we decided to make these jeans.   Our Japanese Classic (APC) isn't a ""replica"" of the APC jeans. The only similarity is the fabric, we decided to outright say that since a lot of our customers ask out this. The differences are: chainstithed cuff, thicker waistband, 2-piece hardware, larger pockets, and our fit.   We still love APC as a brand, but we wante to give our customers a less pricey, American made, and in our opinion, better alternative"
rawdenim,3cpn7z,rpmwest,4,Fri Jul 10 16:29:01 2015 UTC,"If your Japanese Classic (APC) isn't a ""replica"" of the APC jeans, then I would suggest that you remove the following from your copy for the jeans on your website, ""This (is) an improved replica of APC brand jeans."" That's sort of confusing. You could just say that you use the same exact fabric as found in APC jeans. I personally would drop the APC comparison altogether, and try to distinguish yourselves in your own right, but if you're going to draw the comparison, I would remove the word ""replica"" from your marketing copy. Just my two stitches."
rawdenim,3cpn7z,sirpicklesjr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:50:14 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the detailed response. We will work on the description once we get back into the office on Monday

rawdenim,3cl0le,junglizer,2,Thu Jul 9 02:49:14 2015 UTC,"Depends on how big your company is (also what your business does), but on average web browsing isn't something that gets looked at too closely unless your PC is regularly getting viruses/malware. If you want to get paranoid, check out Spector 360. I used to work for a company that would push that software out only when execs suspected something, it would sit in ""monitor mode"" where it would simply sit passively and trigger email alerts on keywords or thresholds (like amount of browsing time, applications out of the ordinary, like command shell, etc.). If there was seemingly enough reason it would be changed to active logging, which would capture screenshots periodically, and literally log everything.   I'd say this level of intrusive monitoring is pretty rare. I was working for an OEM medical and pharmaceutical manufacture at the time. Most you'll probably experience is a monthly report generated for managers regarding how much time their employees spend on time wasting sites like Facebook. A lot of organizations are more concerned with loss of proprietary data or personal information."

I might have shorted myself a few grand on the expected salary question, but made up for it when briefly discussing relocation/hiring bonus. The downside here is that the job is in a non-ideal location.   On a related matter, anyone have any knowledge to drop about Indianapolis?   How y'all doing midweek?"
rawdenim,3cl0le,Ramachandrann,3,Wed Jul 8 19:05:21 2015 UTC,Congrats man! That's awesome. I've visited Indianapolis a few times but I've never stayed there for more than a few days.

We stayed downtown and were eating out a lot, so most of what I know is food around there. From my experience, there were a lot of chain restaurants, which I guess I'm not used to in Chicago.   There are still good restaurants. There's St. Elmo's, which is a classic steakhouse known for their shrimp cocktail that's about 50% horseradish. The Rathskeller is a German restaurant on Massachusetts Ave. The building its self is historic and was designed by Kurt Vonnegut's grandfather. Mass Ave is the arts area, but I've heard has developed a lot more since I was last there two years ago. I've not been there, but I have been told Yats is really good for cajun/creole. There's a lot of bars and whatnot in Broad Ripple, but I've heard it's become a lot more college-y, but it is where David Letterman was raised.

St.Elmo's is really well-known for a reason.  Downtown's pretty nice. I've never felt unsafe, and the Pacers, Colts, and Indians venues are all right there.

As if that is not lucky enough, I got caught speeding for the first time (84 in a 65) on my way back out to Michigan and the cop let me off with a much lighter charge.

Whats putting me on ice, is that I feel that it isn't my problem as its my bosses friend that we bought the thing from and they should provide support to make it work. I'm certain that I could get the thing working, but at an investment of a lot of my time when the people that built it could probably get things running in a day if they so desired. I feel like I should feel bad about this, but I just don't.   Also, I'm probably going to quit reddit for a while here pretty soon. It has just become a huge timesink and I always feel bad about how much time I waste here. Time that could go to bootstrapping a problem that I don't care about, I guess."

There's one thing I could do that is so mindless and menial and it's basically just cataloging that I've put off for some time, but I really should get down to it.

I didn't have anything for him to do last week, so I had him move equipment that we are surplussing. It killed a couple hours of his time and get rid of something that needed to be done. However today at our group meeting he threw me under the bus by saying that while the PI was out, I was ""sort of helpful"" and had him do ""menial tasks"", as if a glorified high schooler has any place in a biotec lab. So guess what he's going to be doing the rest of the week? Thats right, very menial and very dirty tasks!  TL;DR: Make ungrateful undergrads do all the shitty work."
rawdenim,3cl0le,Ramachandrann,2,Wed Jul 8 20:10:01 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha that's great. I started in my lab the summer of be being a junior going to be a senior, so I was really lucky and only got put on cell culture and intracranial surgeries for the first projects I had. Since I'm only a ""junior scientist"" I don't think I get to have undergrads working for me :( or else I would make them do that.  And that guy sounds like a dick at lab meeting.

Well 6 years passed and I finished high school and college and now I moved back and I want to reconnect with them but it feels weird. I'm hesitant because I know things aren't going to be the same or what if they don't want to hang out anymore, I don't know.

At the end of the day though it's your life sure you can feel some responsibility for others but you're the one that's gotta go through everything.

That's good you've got some lab stuff though and you enjoy it enough to maybe pursue it. I don't even have that going for me but it's funny I actually had a possibly job opportunity to do lab work but ultimately decided it may not be something I'm interested in so I came to Korea for a bit instead haha.   sorry that's a wall of text it's late as hell here and it's always nice talking to someone going through something similar, but good luck to you!"

The shop wants to be a high-end boutique but keeps hiring kids who don't know anything about the brands and who only wear shit like Zanerobe. They've got a wall of raws and the staff know next to nothing about them. Ugh.  I did a trial shift with them over the weekend and the manager who was watching me noted that I'd passed all the tests and that it was a very poor day for a trial shift given how empty the store was. Seemed like every time someone came in, though, she was downstairs.  All I want is a job that'll actually let me use some of my skills or knowledge, be it in research, curation, writing, or clothes. Why is that such a chore?"

Granted I got a good job but it's not something I want to do forever but could see myself sticking with just because I can do it.

What bugs me is that the guy waited a while to contact me and actually re-listed the chinos for a couple weeks before reaching out to me about wanting a refund. In his own listing he makes no attempt to describe the problems he had with the chino so I feel like the dude bought the chinos, it didn't fit him the way he wanted it to, couldn't sell it and this is how he is trying to get his money back.

It's functional in day-to-day life but a little inhibiting when it comes to trying to do what I want to do athletically. I've exhausted every option there is besides surgery, so I'm getting it scoped in a month, to see what's actually up."
rawdenim,3cl0le,Im_getting_to_it,2,Thu Jul 9 19:52:10 2015 UTC,Does anyone know what happened to the ultimate battle for glory posts? I just realized I haven't seen the monthly check in posts for a while.
rawdenim,3cl0le,ericplaysbass,2,Wed Jul 8 21:38:03 2015 UTC,"I was waiting for the Daily Questions thread, but it seems like it's not coming out after all today. Hope you all don't mind a quick question.  I asked this the other day, but the only suggested action (let them air out outside) has not seemed to help at all. So, I'm re-asking the question:  Found some vintage raw Levi's at a Savers, still unwashed. However, they have old man ass smell (and man, is it bad.) No stains that I can see, just an omnipresent ass smell. But, since they're unwashed and I plan on flipping them, I'm trying to see if there's a way without washing them that I can remove the smell. Any ideas on how to do that?  Or, if I am just going to have to wash them, how would you recommend going about it? Again, they're unwashed and appear unworn, save for some smelly old dude trying them on at Savers."
rawdenim,3cl0le,btharveyku08,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:38:49 2015 UTC,"I know that I'd never buy unwashed denim that's been used (what with not trusting the random internet person to be purely honest and whatnot). I'm give them a soak in the tub with a bit of detergent, with little to no agitation. And say that on eBay; I know I'd also rather buy a used pair from someone that knows how to take care of jeans than some rando."
rawdenim,3cl0le,ericplaysbass,2,Wed Jul 8 21:49:51 2015 UTC,"I would never forget to mention the previous/current state of the jeans before selling them. My eBay reputation is at stake and I'm not a fool.   Everyone is a rando, as are you, and that's why I'm asking from one rando to another who's more knowledgeable about the subject for what to do. Fact is, jeans are very popular on eBay and you don't need to be an expert on care or materials to sell them. I know what sells and I sell it to the people who buy it; that's all there is. If you don't buy it, then that's you, not everyone else. I can't sell stinky jeans to anyone though, hence me posing the question.  I appreciate the suggestion, but could you be a bit more specific though? How long should they soak? Any detergents I should avoid (bleach obviously, but liquid/powder/brand/etc.) Warm/cold/hot water?"
rawdenim,3cl0le,btharveyku08,2,Wed Jul 8 21:57:56 2015 UTC,"Wow, there was no reason to get defensive. I get that I'm a rando; I merely tried to answer your question as honestly as I could, from a perspective I knew and understood. I also understand that other people have different outlooks.   If you already know what sells, then there's no reason to ask us, and just go sell it, friendo. But as you say, you came here to ask another who's more knowledgeable (in the instant case, myself), and if I were you then I would wash them, speaking from the perspective of someone that both has bought and would buy jeans on eBay.   A soak entails filling the tub enough to fully submerge the jeans (I would recommend cold water, as hot will shrink the denim the most), turning the jeans inside-out, and then submerging them for at least thirty minutes. If you use detergent, many around here would suggest Woolite Dark or something along those lines, and probably just a few tablespoons. Minimize agitation to keep indigo losses to a minimum, and then hang-dry.  Cheers. Good luck with the sale.  EDIT: I was honestly taken aback by the stand-offish tone. I never meant to insinuate you were a ""fool"" our anything along those lines, so if it came off that way, then I apologize. And good luck again! All the best."
rawdenim,3cl0le,ericplaysbass,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:14:02 2015 UTC,"I definitely took it that way, but if you didn't mean it like that, then sorry for getting defensive. The way I was seemingly dismissed as a ""rando"" kinda did it. Just felt like you were being condescending is all, but you obviously weren't now, so I apologize.  Thank you for the specificity on the wash. Looks like I might be on my way to find some Woolite soon."
rawdenim,3cl0le,btharveyku08,2,Wed Jul 8 22:29:53 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, my bad, then. I didn't at all intend to dismiss you. I only meant from the standpoint of everyone being one to each other when we're on the net, which makes transactions just inherently more of one-sided affairs until the goods have officially exchanged hands (making the money in yours and the goods in theirs). I just think people as a whole approach it that way because there's more faith involved in the other party being true to their word than situations where you're buying in-person and can see and feel the goods (or cash, for that matter, haha).   And so I'm overly cautious to put all information forward (and to make the goods appear as shiny ants new as possible) whenever I'm selling anything exactly because I don't want my seller's reputation tarnished, same as you.  ANYway, feel free to ask if you had any other questions or if anything else comes to mind."
rawdenim,3cl0le,ericplaysbass,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:43:21 2015 UTC,"For sure dude, I got what you meant after you pointed it out and I re-read the context a few times. I want to be as transparent as possible on eBay as I can when selling for all the reasons you said, so I appreciate all of your input.  I definitely will, thank you for your help!"
rawdenim,3cl0le,btharveyku08,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:53:57 2015 UTC,"Not a problem. Do you have any pairs of upper-end jeans?   Also, what size are the Levis? Probably not mine, but you never know, haha."
rawdenim,3cl0le,ericplaysbass,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:58:20 2015 UTC,"Nope, I'm unfortunately still a portly fellow and haven't really found a need to get high-end jeans for myself yet, especially since I'm trying to lose weight. I just keep an eye out at thrift stores to flip them for a quick buck, though this buck is quickly turning into a bit of a problem, hehe. My end plan once I get down to my goal weight (175, 50 lbs to go) is to get myself a nice pair of raws, so I lurk this subreddit every now and again. You guys are always posting great content.  The Levi's are 38x30. I just posted more details on them in the Daily Questions thread you made. Check them out! I'll get some pics later, too."

rawdenim,3cl0le,btharveyku08,2,Thu Jul 9 13:57:58 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. He hid from everyone in the Mavs organization after also telling them once he was back to 50-50 that they'd get another face-to-face with him before any final decisions. If you're unilaterally making a decision that has the potential to cripple a franchise that has reason to count on you, the least you can do is stand up and tell them why, even if it means taking your lumps. They are easily justifiable if they want to be pissed at him.  And what's even more laughable is that he was initially leaving the Clippers because he wanted to be a more integral part of an organization's gameplan. A player that is responsible for whether his team wins our loses day in and day out. A player that can be counted on. And then he does this, and shows everyone he's basically just a child, hiding from responsibility.  Oh well. Here's hoping hockey season gives me more to be excited about."

rawdenim,3ckt7q,Ramachandrann,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:00:05 2015 UTC,"I bought them directly from Good Weaver in Japan for $111. I really like them. They're comfortable, well made with good material, and look good in a simple way. You could certainly get something similar for less money, but I doubt the build quality would match. If you do buy, they run a little large. I bought a 9 equivalent over my normal 9.5-10 sizes."
rawdenim,3ckt7q,mattstock,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:49:44 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I appreciate it. I was also looking at Good Weaver as well. JPY is so weak to the USD that I think they're even lower than $111 now. And I'm a 9.5-10 as well, so I'll probably go down to a 9. Thanks."

rawdenim,3clpqo,btharveyku08,3,Wed Jul 8 21:55:15 2015 UTC,"I have some female fit questions/suggestion requests here.  I did the raw denim thing in my college days, and have been wanting to get back into it now that I can wear jeans to work. Skull were my personal favorite at the time because the back looked like it said Anal Chemist and it made me giggle. I went through 2 pairs of their Linda cut. I really liked the weight and texture of the denim.   However, since college, things have expanded. I've also gotten proportionally larger in the hip & ass, and skull is no longer an option.  I went ahead and plugged in my measurements into the rawr denim scout, and I got this list of suggestions.   I'm leaning toward the Unbranded UB101 or UB322. Does anyone have any feedback on how this cut fits on women/guys with a lot of junk in the trunk? Cost isn't a huge concern, but I'd rather spend around $100 or less on the first pair back in the game. Any feedback on how stretch affects the process overall?  Things I like:   Close fit around thighs and seat Button fly (almost a requirement) Highlighting my posterior. I've done too many squats not to show off Babette.   Things I don't like:   Camel toe Tight around lower calves/ankle The tight ass baggy thigh thing Pancake ass   I can do alterations (like taking in the waistband) if need be, but I'd like to keep these to a minimum.  Size comparison in other clothes/brands: I wear a size 12 long in the Express Editor trousers for women, and they fit amazing. For guys style comparison, a size 34/34 producer fits nicely around my butt, but has way too high a rise, and does the tight ass baggy thigh thing.  Sorry if this is TMI, just figure the more info the better.  TLDR; Suggestion for straight/slim jeans to fit a curvy american women size 12/mens 34.  Under $150, not sure on stretch."

rawdenim,3clpqo,clt3,2,Thu Jul 9 03:57:35 2015 UTC,"Replied to Slags re: the Secret Denim. IMO, when you get into heavier weights, there just isn't much variation beyond indigo. The color if the Secret Denim is just very unique in that regard. And the slub adds another factor to the consideration, as well."
rawdenim,3clpqo,tumtumtomtom,2,Thu Jul 9 03:13:04 2015 UTC,"IMHO there's so much more to the secret denim than just indigo differences and weight. You can tell the fabric has been dyed in a way which is completely different from 90% of the general fabrics we see around. The weave is so loose that it almost feels like you can stretch it just by pulling on it. The character is also on a whole different level. There's nep everywhere and the slub is ridiculous. The weave also causes it to feel much lighter than it is and the denim is really breathable. Beyond what's already been said, the color is also wild and changes drastically with wear. You also get that feeling that you're wearing something really special. That's just my two cents on it though!"
rawdenim,3clpqo,clt3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:22:04 2015 UTC,So it's pretty much magical and I should save up for it? Thanks for the thorough response. I really want to just touch the fabric now. It sounds wondrous. Is the color less grey than the pictures?
rawdenim,3clpqo,Tumtumtomtom-remote,2,Thu Jul 9 06:32:23 2015 UTC,"Hahaha they seem magical! I just think the secret denim should get as much credit as it deserves.

rawdenim,3clpqo,tumtumtomtom,2,Thu Jul 9 16:31:11 2015 UTC,"Nope. Not at all. These retail stores have to pay for shipping and taxes and have to mark their goods up to even earn a profit.

So, I'm re-asking the question:  Found some vintage raw Levi's at a Savers, still unwashed. However, they have old man ass smell (and man, is it bad.) No stains that I can see, just an omnipresent ass smell. But, since they're unwashed and I plan on flipping them, I'm trying to see if there's a way without washing them that I can remove the smell. Any ideas on how to do that?  Or, if I am just going to have to wash them, how would you recommend going about it? Again, they're unwashed and appear unworn, save for some smelly old dude trying them on at Savers.  Side-question: If they are indeed washed once, how do you think that will affect sales? Will it only affect sales if the color is altered?"

Also, I assume that if they smell that bad, they probably have some time spent on them and thus are somewhat faded?  I don't know what you mean by vintage, since ""vintage"" is a collection by Levi (http://levisvintageclothing.levi.com/US/en_US/#/1878-triple-pleat-blouse) I assume this is what you mean.   Anywhere from $20 to $80 would be my guess given your description."
rawdenim,3clpqo,cackteye,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:34:18 2015 UTC,"I s'pose I don't know for sure that they're unwashed, but the creases that are there indicate they've been folded and put away for quite some time (what I initially wrote off as attic/basement must was recognized as old man ass after walking around the store with them for a while). The pockets are still flat and crisp and there is no fading or wear at all anywhere on the jeans.  No, I meant actual vintage. They're from some time after '85 I believe (vintage starts after 25 years I think? Maybe not quite vintage then), red tag and tab, Made in the USA, 505 XX, 38 x 30. 505-0217 lot. Here's a post I made a while back concerning a similar pair of Levi's. Apparently someone donated/continues to donate boxes full of old NWT/NWOT Levi's clothing from the 80s and 90s. I've got several pairs of jeans and khakis as well as a really nice jacket.  Here are some quick [poor] pics of the front and the tag."
rawdenim,3clpqo,cackteye,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:52:29 2015 UTC,I would give them a soak with a bit of detergent and let them sun dry. It won't effect the fading potential. Just wear them like you would normally and the fades will come.
rawdenim,3clpqo,thoughtrecord,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:42:25 2015 UTC,Just started on Oni 512.  Only cold soaked and it's pretty damn perfect.  Will it shrink more if I toss it in the washing machine (cold) later on?  Will the agitation shrink it some more?    Just recently washed my BOM008 in the washer on cold and it did shrink so now a bit concerned that I should agitate the Oni's more to get the shrinkage from cold out of its system

On the corner of Bellair and Bloor is the Men's shop, which is direct competition to Harry Rosen. You'll find high end suiting & shoes here. Further down Bloor at Yonge you will find the old Holt's which still carries streetwear. Brands include Naked and Famous, APC, and Rag & Bone.    Capsule: A must stop for anyone who is a fan of sneakers. Located across the street from Uncle Otis. Brands include New Balance, Adidas, Nike, and Jordan's. They usually stock all the limited edition releases.    Leatherfoot: Located beside Uncle Otis, store is for fans of /r/goodyearwelt. Prices can get steep fast, although it is the premier location for shoes. Brands include Carmina, John Lobb, and Saint Crispins.   Guerlain: French fragrance house founded in 1828. This one of their two boutiques in North America (the other being in Las Vegas). The store carries their entire line, including the exclusive collection. Great mens and womens fragrances and skincare products. This store also features a spa."

rawdenim,3ckany,clt3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:03:58 2015 UTC,That's interesting. Does this apply for the low cut ones as well? I tried the low cut ones and they felt a lot lighter on my feet than the 70's.
rawdenim,3ckany,youngofthesoonest,2,Thu Jul 9 00:35:48 2015 UTC,Converses are heavier but I always feel like the soles felt squishy and didn't provide as much support while the shoes like pottery isn't as soft but molds better. The John lofgrens feel like a solid combo of the two where there is that cushion but it doesn't feel shapeless and squishy.

And if it's just actual dirt or rust or whatever and nothing too gross is it acceptable to not wash or soak them still?   Don't be afraid to get them dirty. I wore my favorite pair up Machu Picchu and around Peru for a week. They got dusty and sweaty as hell. After that I soaked them for the second time since I got them... Before that I just felt like they were kinda smelly and they'd stretched out a bit more than I liked. I'd personally not soaking/washing until they're actually visibly soiled or smelly. Even with visible dirtiness you can often just spot clean or let it sit.   Edit: I don't know where to draw the line between acceptable dirty and gross need to wash dirty with raws yet. I do like the dirty, kinda rugged manly look to them though.    That's all personal preference and you can figure it out as you go. Keeping them dirty will make them break down in high stress spots faster, though, so if you like to wear your jeans skin tight it might not be the best idea long term."

I'm planning on posting some next week, but here's back post most recent soak, a closer view, the front, front top block, and selvage. Probably not exactly what you're looking for in a pair of jeans, since instead of the white weft underneath they're black, which makes them start out near black and fade to a darker blue than it seems you're seeking. I'd still recommend Rogue Territory's jeans if they have a fit and fabric that works for you, especially if you're looking for a made in America product with a lot of nice details (the pen pocket is kind of one of their signature features and way more useful than you'd expect)."

rawdenim,3cikgb,soothsayer_,6,Wed Jul 8 13:30:42 2015 UTC,I unabashedly pro jorts always and forever. There are a couple conditions though. 1) They have to be cut from old jeans. Buying jorts is a cardinal sin. 2) They have to be just the right length. Too far in either direction gets problematic.  I live in Philly so jorts are pretty common here in the summer. If its 95 degrees outside and Im not doing anything that requires any sort of dress code you bet your sweet ass Im jorts'in.

The 120x's are some of the most comfortable ""out of the box"" denim I've ever worn, while the 100xk's were a bit stiff after I soaked them.

I lost some weight, they were more comfortable, and I have basically been wearing them daily for the last six months. I'm in love with the fit. Even had to send them back to Railcar for a crotch repair a couple months ago. In the last year or so have soaked them twice. Now: This last weekend I decided to wear them on a pretty major 3 day 30 mile hike, you know, really put 'em through the ringer before washing them for real.  Last night I washed them inside-out in my ancient top-loader. I knew I had to pull them before spin cycle, but I had to leave the house for an errand. By the time I got back, they were mid-spin. Smeared my combs, put a weird light streak up one leg. Both super minor, but I'm just bummed out. There is lots of color left, and with more wear and washes I can definitely minimize these issues.

With vanity sizing, a 32 usually translates to a true 34, so yeah, you screwed yourself. You should have ordered a 34.  While I'm not nearly as big as you are, I don't think a leg opening of 7.3"" is big at all. Witch stretch and what not, I think that would end up being an even 8"" anyway.  Welp, you almost had a good deal, live and learn."
rawdenim,3cgh70,todayismyluckyday,2,Wed Jul 8 05:00:02 2015 UTC,"The size they use on the fit model has little bearing on how measurements affect other sizes. I have no confusion looking at an example fit pic of a different size.   The lesson I learned here is that, without a complete size chart, it is impossible to estimate the size of everything else. Unlike inseam measurement, the hem opening sizes up dramatically with different waist sizes. Here's size charts for two pairs I own: 3Sixteen ST-120x and Railcar Spikes.   On the 120x, a hem size of 7.3"" translates to a waist measurement of 31"", on the Railcars a measurement of 7.3"" also translates to a waist size of 31"". I agree that on a size 30"" or 31"" a 7.3"" hem isn't big or small, just kind of normal.   However, on my size 36"" 3sixteens ( which fit great ) the actual hem is 7.75"", and on the Railcars ( which also fit great ) the actual hem is 8"".   You can see why, anticipating a 7.3"" or similar hem, I sized up one. Oh well, like you said...live and learn. In this case, learn to get a complete size chart or live with the results. :)"

rawdenim,3cfstb,Robocob0,12,Tue Jul 7 17:40:33 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like having a range of possible fits depending on my mood. I tend to favor a slim-tapered look like this for much of the year - it fits slim and flattering, can be worn with boots or sneakers, and doesn't infringe at all upon my freedom of movement. Comfort is pretty important to me; every time I hear of people who buy raws and tell people that it limits their mobility I feel like they're doing it wrong.  In the late fall and early winter, I go for a more slim-straight look like this, since I tend to wear bigger, chunkier boots in that season. The larger leg measurements mean that there's less fabric in contact with my legs, meaning that the cold doesn't penetrate quite as much.

rawdenim,3cfstb,phrates,3,Tue Jul 7 22:19:51 2015 UTC,"I'm tall (6'6"") and pretty skinny, so I usually go with slimmer fits, with higher rises. Ideally, to me, measurements are 11-11.5"" rise, 33.5"" waist, 7-7.5"" leg opening, 34"" inseam for no-break no-cuff or 35-36"" inseam for cuffed. I actually don't know what thigh measurements my jeans are, but it's hard to find some with those specs. My EPLA jeans are pretty close, but could have a slightly higher rise and smaller LO. Those measurements pretty much follow my shape without being tight anywhere (""The perfect slim-but-not-skinny fit!"" as advertised by everyone.) Edit: Fit, Battenwear + EPLA + Tricker's, in which you can see the torso-to-leg ratio. I've tried to wear 9"" rise pants and it looks pretty silly."
rawdenim,3cfstb,JasperUngulate,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:46:41 2015 UTC,"I'm incredibly similar to your ideal measurements. 6'5"" 180 lbs. Need another inch in the waist though. My Tellason Elgin's are about perfect - 12"" thigh, 11"" Rise and 7.25"" leg opening (these are roughly from memory). The waist size off the rack was 34. It ended up stretching to 36 which is still doable but there is slight bunching in the waist after fixing it with my belt. If I could do it all over again, I think the John Graham Mellor fit might be a little better as there's 1 less inch of Rise, because where it sits just above my hips cause a little resistance when throwing my leg over my bike.  I digress though. I agree with the silhouette you like. Am currently breaking in S710XX which fixes the top block stuff I had, but there's another inch in leg opening. Interested to see where this goes as I'm not used to having to be careful with the chain on my bike."

If they're still around when my current pair dies, I think I'm going to try it out. I've tried on Tellasons before, but not the Elgin. My torso is long, so anything less than 11"" rise fits weird and exaggerates my torso length even more. I wish I could get a 12"" rise with 7"" LO, but I know that's probably not going to happen."

Also, all i wear are sneakers and i think small leg openings look best with them.  Back in high school, i used to wear 514s and 513s levis. Then i stumbled upon the 508 fit. They're perfect for me and theyre the one jeans that got me into denim. What sucks is that there arent any pairs of raws that fit nearly the same as 508s. But the UB401s were the closest despite having smaller thighs. Also, i do plan on doing a fit check/ 4 month progress on my pair today or tomorrow.

Here are some search links I found.  SR1  SR2  SR3  SR4  SG5109  I've only handled the Strike Golds, but the fabric is unlike anything else I've ever felt. Like the product desctipion on Self Edge, it really does feel like a coarsely woven rug. The majority of the texture is on the weft, but it shows through the warp. They have a ton of character and amazing fading potential, though the back pockets seem to blow out for a lot of folks. I had to sell mine because they were too small, but I have another pair in the correct size on the way. Construction is top notch. I love my SG3109s and am eagerly awaiting my 5109s.

rawdenim,3cfskw,clt3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:38:39 2015 UTC,Depends if they want to cuff or not
rawdenim,3cfskw,youngofthesoonest,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:53:40 2015 UTC,"depends if you want to cuff or not...if you want to cuff, add a few inches to your desired inseam length. if you don't, then don't add."
rawdenim,3cfskw,TheVirt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:16:00 2015 UTC,"Can someone help me with a fit check on these PBJ XX-005? I visited Dutil the other day to try these on and the slub is amazing; I can definitely see why people say they can't stop feeling up their thighs!  These would be by first pair of unsanforized so I'm a little unsure about the shrinking. The guy at Dutil said that a general guideline would be to size up 1 from what seems like a good fit. These are a size 29, so would I size up to a 30 for shrinkage?"
rawdenim,3cfskw,dn0c,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:17:33 2015 UTC,"I think those look pretty good as a pre-soak measurement, but it doesn't look like you have much room to lose in the thigh. I think you could either a) Go up 1 size and soak in hot hot water, or b) get that size and soak in lukewarm / cold water."
rawdenim,3cfskw,guilt_tripped_boy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:03:32 2015 UTC,"I'm totally new to this sub and raw denim in general, but I just bought a pair of Uniqlo selvedge jeans. Are they made with raw denim? Are they sanforized?"
rawdenim,3cfskw,youngofthesoonest,2,Wed Jul 8 03:18:47 2015 UTC,selvedge is a way to describe a kind of fabric where the edges are self finishing (which is those white lines you see on the outseam). Raw denim means that the denim has not been prewashed/distressed/treated to look broken in. Selvedge does not necessarily mean raw and raw doesn't necessarily mean selvedge. You can have a selvedge denim that is pre distressed and prewashed and you can have a raw denim fabric that isn't selvedge. It's hard to say if your jeans are raw or not unless you show some pictures. Either way they are most likely sanforized even though uniqlo reps seem to be very confused on whether or not it is.
rawdenim,3cfskw,guilt_tripped_boy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:06:49 2015 UTC,does that mean that some of their selvedge jeans are raw and some aren't?
rawdenim,3cfskw,dn0c,2,Wed Jul 8 02:16:13 2015 UTC,"Yep, some of their denim is selvedge, but it has been washed or pretreated. Non-raw selvedge is more rare than raw selvedge, but they do make them.  Here's an example of a pair of selvedge that is NOT raw. http://www.uniqlo.com/us/product/men-stretch-slim-fit-straight-jeans-selvedge-135741.html#64~/men/bottoms/jeans/stretch-selvedge/~  (make sure you're looking at the ""64 Blue"" color)"

rawdenim,3cgfx4,muzga,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:19:54 2015 UTC,Yeah it is! Soft but still has some weight to it. This is my first ever pair of raw denim and I am extremely happy with my purchase.

rawdenim,3cg5g6,OceanCat11,2,Tue Jul 7 18:48:20 2015 UTC,The only brand I know that sews so the selvage is exposed top to bottom is Imperial
rawdenim,3cg5g6,d_wilson123,3,Tue Jul 7 18:53:33 2015 UTC,Basically I don't really look good when I tried to match blue tops with indigo jeans. So I decided to purchase a pair of beige chinos and black jeans from uniqlo to become more versatile at matching other clothes and shoes especially when it comes to blue tops. I'm not expecting much fading but I do hope for the best after 365 days of wear. I think even if it doesn't fade it might not be a bad thing anyway...to me it seems like unfaded black jeans would probably be more versatile at matching other clothes and look smarter than a faded pair. But I really still do hope it fades!!!
rawdenim,3cg5g6,d4mini0n,3,Tue Jul 7 17:35:44 2015 UTC,"I wear this pair to work, so nonstop since I got them about three months ago. They're already faded a bit overall from washing them 3-4 times and they have visible honeycombs on the inside that, strangely enough, aren't visible from the outside."
rawdenim,3cg5g6,throwawayccc000,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:01:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I am happy to know that they start fading after 3 months.

rawdenim,3cg5g6,HipposLoveCereal,3,Wed Jul 8 17:06:51 2015 UTC,"My experience with uniqlo raw denim selvedge is that the quality is sub par. Having worn mine for nearly 365 days a year for 1¬Ω years I have had to have the crotch reinforced with stiching, the front pocket lining has blown out completely and any place that would have faded has also frayed. Gave them a wash two days ago and iI have to say, they don't fade that much at all.   The frayed areas provide good ventilation now in the summer, so at least that's nice.  Even at the price they are at I would not waste my money again. Any recommendations for my next pair?"
rawdenim,3cg5g6,clt3,7,Tue Jul 7 23:57:27 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, depending on how tight the fit is, most pairs regardless of brand will need some sort of crotch reinforcement and have some blowouts if you really wear them pretty much everyday."
rawdenim,3cg5g6,throwawayccc000,2,Wed Jul 8 01:34:18 2015 UTC,This. Higher quality denim doesn't even necessarily mean that they'll last longer. They just have more expensive details and fade differently thay you may or may not want.
rawdenim,3cg5g6,hlmilkisnice,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:04:40 2015 UTC,My levis 508s are holding up way better with about the same amount of wear on them. I'll post a comparison in about 3 weeks if you remind me.

rawdenim,3cg5g6,subsidizedtime,2,Fri Jul 10 23:38:12 2015 UTC,Any guidance on fit? Was looking to pick up a pair of these soon. Typically go for a touch of room in the thigh and a more aggressive taper below the knee.   I fit pretty well into a 31 PS from APC.
rawdenim,3cg5g6,RickFlairWOOOO,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:16:50 2015 UTC,"sorry I can't advise you on this area as I do not know much. However this jeans contain 2% elastance and it's very stretchable. If I am not mistaken there are 2 versions, the regular and the slim. I have gotten the slim and it's quite skinny on my thighs yet very comfortable and mobile at the same time.  Since uniqlo isn't as rare as BIG or Selfedge, hopefully there's 1 outlet near to you so that you can pop in and try finding your perfect pair."

I want that Kibata cut now... are they the same when it comes to not stretching or very minimal stretch? I was a bit bummed out when my other jeans (not your brand) expanded like 2 sizes once I wore them around for a week or so. Love the fit of your Slim Taper cut and would like to plan ahead in case you expect any give in that fabric."
rawdenim,3cehd5,RawOwyn,2,Tue Jul 7 15:26:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words! Our kibata denim will stretch a little more due to the low tension weave, but you should only expect 1.5"" of stretch in the waist. If your ST-120x's are pretty snug now then I would take a size up in xk, but if you find them to be a little roomy then you may want to take the same size, cold soak and then stretch them out."

rawdenim,3cd9q7,WalterMelons,2,Tue Jul 7 17:34:04 2015 UTC,"This color looks much different to the one shown on their website. Am I missing something? Is it from the washing? Sorry, I'm new to this and I've been looking for something like this color."
rawdenim,3cd9q7,gngstrMNKY,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:51:22 2015 UTC,"Hey there, when I first got them they were an extremely dark shade of indigo. They have lightened up to a lighter shade but if you see them IRL they are still darker than your average pair of jeans.  I took the photo with my nexus 5 (HDR+ off) so the phones camera might not have captured the colors 100% accurately."
rawdenim,3cd9q7,btharveyku08,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:03:59 2015 UTC,So are they these? Those seem a whole lot darker than your pics.
rawdenim,3cd9q7,gngstrMNKY,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:46:38 2015 UTC,"Very nice. I'm currently wearing the 301s as part of my regular rotation which has very similar measurements. I think the top block is different somehow but I've never really seen someone compare them. Everyone says the 21oz denim is slow to fade, but mine is coming along pretty quickly as yours obviously did."
rawdenim,3cd9q7,zortnarftroz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:22:52 2015 UTC,I think my frequent washes and the tightness of the cut may have something to do with how fast these guys are fading.   I would still consider it a fairly slow fader because if I wore my APCs as hard as these guys I think the APCs would be extremely faded.   Was torn between the 301s and this but the stealth arcs won me over. How do you like the 301s?
rawdenim,3cd5v5,baltopnw,7,Tue Jul 7 00:04:24 2015 UTC,"Just returned home from a week and a half away to a lovely Japan post package. I purchased the Samurai 711vx off denimio after seeing the current yen to usd conversion rate. I have wanted a pair of samurai for a number of years but generally they were out of my price range. So this is my first pair, also the first pair of sams I‚Äôve seen in person. I chose the 711 over the 710 because I am quite skinny and didn‚Äôt want to deal with having a 710 altered in the legs, also the 17oz zero denim seemed more interesting to me then the 19oz. I went more or less TTS based on a recent post I found on Sufu. These photos are all pre soak, they make the legs seem narrower then they are but once they touch water that won‚Äôt be a problem.   The rise is low on these when compared to my Oni and made in japan N&F, but it‚Äôs about the same as my japan blues (haven‚Äôt measured, just based by feel). They defiantly hug the butt more then any other pairs I have, not uncomfortably so but it‚Äôs noticeable. Got the first 2 buttons done right away, then the 3rd 45 min or so later where I‚Äôm at currently. I plan to wear these unsoaked for a few days to let the upper block form to me a bit then I will wear them in a hot soak to not overly shrink the waist/crotch. For reference I am 6'3"" 140 pounds.   Pictured with the jeans is a glass pendant I just received from a Japanese artist who goes by the name aquariust, check out his instagram if you are into glass/boro (both functional and non)"
rawdenim,3cd5v5,neegahsausage,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:04:29 2015 UTC,"These look great! Regarding your Onis, did you go TTS and did they end up stretching as much as most people said they would?"
rawdenim,3cd5v5,JayTbo,2,Tue Jul 7 02:27:45 2015 UTC,"Same size as these (29), I did a 1.5 hour hot soak with the oni and they shrank up quite a bit in the legs, the waist shrank to a nice size to stretch out for a perfect fit which I feel I have after 4 months of wear. I haven't noticed any excessive stretching with the 527."

rawdenim,3cd5v5,knaidoo21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:33:50 2015 UTC,I'm having such a tough time deciding whether I want to pick this pair up or some Oni 517s for my next pair. I think what I'm most worried about is the difference in weights between the two. Can you notice a huge difference between your Onis and these in terms of warmth? The fit looks good as well!
rawdenim,3cd5v5,yemi2k13,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:36:16 2015 UTC,"Oni's secret denim, while heavy has a pretty loose weave so they breathe really well and don't feel the weight they really are, they are very soft and blanket like, but not overly warm (been wearing them in 100+ degree temps last week). These are more traditional I'd say, darker and less airy feeling, though of course they are brand new so that may change. The oni 517 fabric is pretty slubby in comparison to these at least from photos I have seen online."

rawdenim,3cckkc,detroitcracker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:48:58 2015 UTC,I cheated and put off having them fixed by changing the cuff up so the crease fell in a different place...now I have two areas per cuff that need fixin' haha.
rawdenim,3cckkc,detroitcracker,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:05:11 2015 UTC,"Yea so I got mine back. And though I'm overall happy with the Railcar repairs they left glue (?) near where they darned the cuffs. I'm guessing they use it to hold the material they darn through in place? The glue looked kinda like a salt stain you might get in the winter if you never washed your jeans. Though it came off with some scrubbing with a wet rag it would been nice if they had removed it considering the price of the repair. That said, pre-repair, the cuffs were pretty much detached save for where they met the in- and outseams. Crotch repair looked solid."

rawdenim,3cc02c,borderinawesome,3,Mon Jul 6 19:00:19 2015 UTC,"I'm on rakuten and I'm debating whether to get the iron heart IH-634S or the samurai S510XX21oz. Both are heavy 21oz, thought about the IH-634XHS too which is a 25oz. Can you give me any input as I explore the world of heavier denim. What would be your guy's pros and cons, and if you have any experience with each model."
rawdenim,3cc02c,pudaspriest,3,Mon Jul 6 19:00:42 2015 UTC,"No experience with the Iron heart but the samurai's are very nice. I have the s5000 in the 21oz and the s510 in the 25oz. One thing to be aware is that the cut on the s510 is generous, I actually had mine tapered down to be a bit slimmer. The 21oz denim is not as slubby as some of samurai's less weighty offerings but it is still has good character."
rawdenim,3cc02c,borderinawesome,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:20:51 2015 UTC,"Okay, that's good to know I kind of prefer the more roomier leg."
rawdenim,3cc02c,pudaspriest,2,Tue Jul 7 01:33:18 2015 UTC,Should be right up your alley then! I think whatever pair you decide on will be great. I love both Iron Heart and Samurai but prefer Samurai's denim in general.
rawdenim,3cc02c,DarthPNW,2,Tue Jul 7 01:43:26 2015 UTC,"I can't give any advice on Samurai, but here are my thoughts on Iron Heart.  21 oz is Iron Heart's signature denim and you can't go wrong with the 634S.  Breathes very well despite being 21oz.  Some say the denim doesn't fade as drastic as other brands, but with IH you are getting quality heavy denim.  I currently own the XHS, but mainly wear it in Fall/Winter/Spring seasons... a stiff wear for sure.  21oz is much more accessible and is IH's flagship for a reason.  Hopefully someone can give more insight on the S510-"
rawdenim,3cc02c,borderinawesome,2,Mon Jul 6 23:40:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks I guess I'm just turned on by the XHS because it's 25 vs 21oz, more specifically do you think the extra price for the XHS justifies it?"
rawdenim,3cc02c,DarthPNW,2,Tue Jul 7 00:26:02 2015 UTC,"To me, it is.  But I've always preferred the heavier stuff.  XHS are stiff enough to stand on their own and you'll feel that when you wear them. What denim are you wearing currently?"
rawdenim,3cc02c,borderinawesome,2,Tue Jul 7 00:36:16 2015 UTC,"13.5oz is what I'm currently rocking, I kinda look forward to the challenge of heavy denim, you got me sold on the part that they are stiff enough to stand on their own.  Thanks for the input!"
rawdenim,3cc02c,DarthPNW,2,Tue Jul 7 01:32:16 2015 UTC,"Awesome man, jump in the deep end!  If you need any convincing, you can check Iron Heart forum's 634-XHS thread.  Lots of fit and wear pics to fuel the stoke."
rawdenim,3cc02c,Buckhum,2,Tue Jul 7 01:46:04 2015 UTC,"So based on my limited experience of handling these pairs (I don't own either, just checked them out in stores):   Iron Heart signature 21oz denim is super duper soft right off the bat. It doesn't feel like you're handling 21oz because of how surprisingly comfy it is. The fabric is very uniform and breathes well enough for Southeast Asian weather according to my friend who wore it through Thailand summer. And so, I'm sure it's more than wearable in the west. Samurai 21oz (I tried the S5000vx-21oz raw version and not the 510XX which uses a different denim). This thing is a damn monster. I cannot imagine what their 25oz feels like. I tried it on and couldn't get a single button done. Still, I have handled 17oz and 19oz Samurai denim (same fabric as the S510xx) and they were dyed with a very distinct japanese 'dark' indigo shade. These also fade in quite a 'vintage' manner as evident here. *it's probably been washed a lot compared to the western standard for high contrast fades.   Verdict: If you want more subdued fabric and cleaner details with a softer fabric, go with Iron Hearts. If you want some of that hardcore unsanforized fabric (really have to do your homework for sizing these) with goofy details then go with Samurai.  Can't lose with either one."

The quality and fit seem fine, but they feel so soft, almost like they were prewashed. I walked around with them for a few hours and can't get any creases to set, and even struggled to get the cuffs to stay in place, nothing like my experience with the cardboardy feel of my first pair of raws, N&F LHT. Have any of you had this pair before? Am I just overestimating what 'nicely starched' (from the fabric description) means, or is it possible someone washed this pair, returned it, and it ended up in the grab bag selection? I get that I was making a gamble by ordering the grab bag, but I can't help but feel a bit cheated in that the grab bag description promised one of their previous fabrics, and a washed version of one of them isn't the same thing to me."

rawdenim,3cc02c,mcadamsandwich,2,Tue Jul 7 02:59:53 2015 UTC,About how much can be tapered from a pair of jeans?   As much as you want. Railcar deconstructs the leg seams and tapers to the exact measurements you provide. You can make it as straight or as carrot-like as you prefer.

rawdenim,3cbb7v,BoxerguyT89,2,Mon Jul 6 17:48:18 2015 UTC,Just wore them and squatted a lot while wearing them.  I did a lot of movement that put stress on the thighs and it helped quite a bit.  I have used a scissor jack and two 2x4s in the past to stretch a pair of Gustins that were too small as well.

Surprisingly, from the very first day we got Sombra, she has never woken us up midway through the night for a bathroom break. She's woken up and started barking at a stimulus, sure, but then she crumps back out into sleep.  Besides that, I'm still working on impulse control, and getting her stimulus threshold up. On my way back into SF via Petaluma, I stopped for lunch at a cafe, and sat out on the patio. Of course, my dog started going nuts at a few different things, namely a dog barking across the street. But after getting her under control, I was complimented on my form by a woman sitting at the next table, who then told me she was a professional dog trainer, and would have done the exact same thing.  feelsgoodman.jpg"

I specifically don't use the white powdery one though (that's antiperspirant + deodorant) and use the gel one (which is just deodorant--I don't tend to sweat much, and the white powdery shit always gets everywhere).   It's nearly impossible to find it. About two years ago, I got fed up with never being able to find it at a grocery store when I was out, so I started bulk ordering packages of like 20 sticks at a time directly from Procter & Gamble.   It's been working out for me."

The stuff is called fat and the moon deodorant cream, and it's tits. After I used it all I made my own more or less based off their ingredients; Coconut oil, baking soda, arrowroot starch, beeswax, tea tree oil, then I added my own blend of essential oils for scent that compliment the oils I already wear.

This was at the store in South Coast Plaza.  A mix of ST/SL-100 in size 29, 31, 36 and another pair I do not remember. YMMV at your local store."
rawdenim,3cbb7v,Buckhum,2,Mon Jul 6 19:00:19 2015 UTC,Sometimes I wonder where people with sick fades who don't have phone fades put their phones. I don't wear a jacket and I don't want to have the phone in my hand all day.

rawdenim,3cbb7v,gravrain,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:12:29 2015 UTC,"I guess Creede would be the closest town, but we're staying at a place below the Rio Grande reservoir. My Inlaws have vacationed there for decades and its my chance to get in fishing for the year. In past years I've backpacked the Weminuche Wilderness for a couple days but with the kiddo around we'll probably not get that much hiking in/."
rawdenim,3cbb7v,turbospartan,2,Mon Jul 6 17:54:35 2015 UTC,"Cool.   Kind of close (off of Highway 40), but there is a bad ass waterfall I have researched and want to make it out to eventually.  North Clear Creek Falls"
rawdenim,3cbb7v,gravrain,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:03:05 2015 UTC,"Yep! North Clear Creek (other side of the highway) is our secondary fishing spot. The Continental reservoir has never been kind to me when it comes to lake fishing, but the stream is a lot of fun to fish. The waterfall is cool and its pretty easy to hike down to the stream for a closer look. There is also a country store down that way that my Inlaws visit once a day for their ice cream, called Freemans or something. I'd say its definitely worth a weekend trip."
rawdenim,3cbb7v,turbospartan,2,Mon Jul 6 18:05:52 2015 UTC,"when it comes to lake fishing, but the stream is a lot of fun to fish   I am the opposite... don't think I've caught a fish yet, out of a river here in CO.  But then again, I don't fly fish.  Have had pretty good luck fishing the lakes / reservoirs, though.  We use PowerBait, which looks like play-doh."
rawdenim,3cbb7v,gravrain,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:12:20 2015 UTC,"The Rio Grande and N. Clear Creek are actually a little small for fly fishing in my mind, so I usually spin fish. The spoons and blades get noticed a lot easier than fly's in the fast moving streams. And its easier to place where you cast.   I'm not sure what is in PowerBait, but it works like crazy. I've actually got to get into our fishing stuff tonight and see what we need to get, so I'm sure some PowerBait is in the works."
rawdenim,3cbb7v,turbospartan,2,Mon Jul 6 18:13:44 2015 UTC,What kind of spoons / blades do you use?  PowerBait is crazy.  Who would've ever thought that trout would be so interested in pink / lime green / white garlic play-doh.  But... it works.
rawdenim,3cbb7v,gravrain,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:22:36 2015 UTC,"Wifes family swears by Panther Martin spotted lures generally red/yellow with black/yellow working some years, but I've found some luck with sea trout and copper/orange brass ones. Mepp's spoons that are fishscale patterened work pretty well too, but I have an old red/silver spoon that works great that apparently isn't sold anymore. Or at least I couldn't find it in a quick online search."
rawdenim,3cbb7v,turbospartan,2,Mon Jul 6 18:25:42 2015 UTC,"So you just cast these into the river and reel them back in as soon as they hit the water?   That's how we used to fish in MI lakes, mostly for Pike.   The whole PowerBait technique we've used is.... cast it out there, let it sit until you see/feel a bite, then set the hook."
rawdenim,3cbb7v,dare2smile,2,Mon Jul 6 18:38:21 2015 UTC,I've been adding things to my wishlist for two weeks in anticipation of Prime Day.  I'm so excited!
rawdenim,3cbb7v,xMadDecentx,2,Mon Jul 6 18:40:48 2015 UTC,Got back from my vacation to Florida. My g/f's mom drove me up the wall with her jabs at me trying to move back to Chicago. Nonetheless I had a great time on our first 'vacation'. I may have packed too much though.
rawdenim,3cbb7v,Buckhum,2,Mon Jul 6 18:07:36 2015 UTC,Well in your defense Chi city is a lovely city.
rawdenim,3cbb7v,xMadDecentx,2,Mon Jul 6 17:13:57 2015 UTC,"True that, but she is scared that I'm going to take her daughter away from her. She constantly guilts my g/f into staying within a close proximity of her. Apparently she's been doing it for years. I'd love to be the one who cuts that 28 year old umbilical cord, but my g/f has to be the one who does the snipping."
rawdenim,3cbb7v,turbospartan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:19:25 2015 UTC,"I had a similar situation with my gf (now fiance) when I moved to Denver.   Her family is very close knit, and they all grew up in the same town/area for generations.  Moving anywhere outside of a 20 minute radius of their town blew their mind, so they weren't happy when she moved out here with me.   But now they've come around."
rawdenim,3cbb7v,xMadDecentx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:34:26 2015 UTC,"Well congrats on the proposal! This is a fairly new relationship (~7 months), so I don't really know wtf to do.

rawdenim,3cbb7v,xMadDecentx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:07:54 2015 UTC,"she can't be away from the same small town as her mom.   Why can't she be away from her? Also, my g/f says she can be away from her, but I honestly don't see it happening. And if it does happen, it is going to be more of a chore than I'd like it to be."
rawdenim,3cbb7v,d4mini0n,2,Mon Jul 6 18:52:58 2015 UTC,Separation anxiety I think. She lives two blocks from her mom and if I understand it correctly when he first moved to Texas it was only a few days a week. When he was out of town she'd go sleep in the bed with her mom.
rawdenim,3cbb7v,Ramachandrann,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:03:23 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend's mom is always trying to get me to stay here rather than move back to Chicago. I've realized since neither my mom nor my girlfriend's mom are from the US, they just don't get things sometimes and say things that really annoy me due to cultural differences. And now I'm really starting to get annoyed by her mom because of things my mom did, and that's unfair to her. I'm trying to be more patient."

rawdenim,3cbb7v,jortslife,2,Mon Jul 6 16:40:50 2015 UTC,Lol yeah as far as I know that's true. She owns a shop here in Chicago and has since before the show started. She also is part of some burlesque show here.   I'm sad I know this.
rawdenim,3cbb7v,d_wilson123,2,Mon Jul 6 16:14:24 2015 UTC,I used to really be into that show when it first started but it started to basically become the exact same episode over and over.  I also heard other non-TV pickers kind of hate the show because they overpay for the items on the show so the expectation is to basically make $100-$150 off an item but realistically real pickers need to triple their money per item.
rawdenim,3cbb7v,fortunefades,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:19:17 2015 UTC,This 1000%! My wife and I have a lot of antiques and my mother-in-law used to own an antique store. It's crazy to see the increases on items that are very similar to what is on that show (especially if you are in a bigger city). You've pretty much gotta travel out of the city a couple of hours to find a decent price on things now. I really wish I knew what their clientele was like - they increase the price on things a ridiculous amount.
rawdenim,3cbb7v,d_wilson123,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:10:20 2015 UTC,I suppose if you already had a large inventory of now-vogue vintage items it would be a good deal that the show has driven up prices on certain items.  But I think that now many people are informed that their vintage porcelain oil signage is pretty popular now and it would be hard to steal a good deal on it these days.
rawdenim,3cbb7v,jortslife,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:19:53 2015 UTC,"Which is why I use it to fall asleep. Takes me about a week to get through an episode, just in time for the next one to come out.   If you're watching history channel for the originality and quality of the programming you're doing it wrong."
rawdenim,3cbb7v,d_wilson123,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:26:24 2015 UTC,I still get down on Pawn Stars.  The faux reality show portions are cringe worthy but they do give some good history background on various items.  I can usually learn a thing or two per episode.  Pickers just seemed to be them buying transportation related items and oil signs so I wasn't learning a thing.

I applied for a couple jobs today, one an hour away, and the other in Denver (I live in Michigan).  Was gonna go full on MiUSA this weekend (Tellason, Red Wing, Monitaly) but it was definitely too hot for that.

rawdenim,3cbb7v,e3super,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:20:17 2015 UTC,"A bit late, but I have a lunch box from Pack-It. It's made to leave in the freezer, rather than using an ice pack inside a lunch box. It's as convenient as any other lunch box, and, in my experience, it's pretty darn good for keeping food cool for at least 5-7 hours (probably more, that's just all I've needed). Although, they're not exactly gorgeous full grain leather bags, so it really won't add anything style-wise."

My VW used to have these nipple things under the rear bumper that you could twist/pinch, and all that crap would come out. There were drains in the door jambs, too, and I think you could do the same.

rawdenim,3cbb7v,fwmg_darster,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:03:42 2015 UTC,So I got lasik on Thursday. I think it was pretty successful. I say pretty successful because my eyes haven't completely healed yet.

rawdenim,3cc1pc,d_wilson123,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:11:56 2015 UTC,Those are generally fine to post as well.  The mods had an open question if things like that should be allowed to be posted and last I heard thats fine.  -edit-  And to expand even those items seem to not be able to get a ton of traction.  The general concensus from my years here is spending a few hundred on jeans you wear everyday is alright but people have a hard time swallowing a $200 shirt.

My parents are in Wisconsin right now and literally a half hour ago asked what my New Glarus order would be (can't get it here in Ohio). That is too bizarre to make up. I always get spotted cow for hot summer day drinking and moon man every other time that I need to drink. Do you have any suggestions? Also that repair looks awesome.
rawdenim,3c8hpk,highvoltorb,6,Mon Jul 6 01:10:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. Holy shit, small world! I live in MN and just made a run the other day - I got a sampler with Spotted Cow, Two Women, Yokel, and Moon Man, but I would definitely recommend Spotted Cow (of course) and their apple ale if your folks can find it. Cheers!"
rawdenim,3c8hpk,elementality22,4,Mon Jul 6 01:16:32 2015 UTC,"Knowing what's in their sampler currently actually helps a lot, because I know they change it around sometimes.

I had a tailor patch up my cell phone hole in the same way a couple months ago, but didn't feel like waiting 3 weeks and paying another $32 for something I could do myself.   I ran out of navy thread so I used black for the second one. You can't tell unless I do the splits upside down, though. It was cool to get in touch with my jeans. Though I did read you're not supposed to do zigzag stitches in the crotch, so I'll seam-rip those. Otherwise, these'll be good to go for another long while!"

rawdenim,3c8f0f,firefly_frenZy,6,Sun Jul 5 21:37:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, the thinner the denim, the quicker it will get holes. One factor that will help is hang drying raws rather than machine drying them. The dryer really wears out clothes. I much prefer the mid to heavier denim, but do have a lightweight pair I wear in the warmer months. I haven't had them too long so can't speak authoritatively on durability. But if you get into the habit of air hang drying that will help for sure."
rawdenim,3c8f0f,pleegray,6,Sun Jul 5 22:08:22 2015 UTC,"The tighter the fit, the more strain you put on the fabric. Compound that with light denim and chances for holes is pretty high but I usually hear about them occurring at least 6 months in. Anyway the holes just add to the whole personal Jean thing imo. Finding a cool patching fabric is fun"
rawdenim,3c8f0f,Theanine,3,Mon Jul 6 00:40:42 2015 UTC,"I think you left out a few key bits of info pertaining to what you are doing currently to your denim as well as what sort of fit you are going for.  As mentioned by previous commentors, it matters how tight your jeans are in the thigh and crotch area. If you are looking for skin tight, skinny jeans style, then you have already put yourself at higher risk for blow outs. Regardless of the weight or type of denim you are wearing, the more strain you put on those threads the more likely they will be to fail.  Secondly, how frequently are you washing your jeans? I'm not sure about people who are unfamiliar with raws, but the vast majority of the people here don't wash their pants for months at a time, some go for years. It's a fade thing.  The more frequently you wash your pants, the better chance they will have for surviving for longer. That being said, you shouldn't wash and dry your jeans in the machine every other day either.  If you aren't worried about fades and what not, then I'd suggest washing them about once or twice a month, maybe soaking them in your bathtub in between if you're really paranoid. I know when I was your age, I was very concerned about smells and being clean, so I would wash my jeans once a week (at least), so even the thought of waiting a month might gross you out."

I do walk a lot and my thighs rub together when I do. The holes in my jeans definitely seem to come from friction and not from just being strained.

rawdenim,3c8f0f,quickly_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:15:32 2015 UTC,"Tighter the jeans, more damage it will accrue with wear.  Raw denim almost certainly better than 20 dollar jeans from target lol.  I read something a while back about raw denim and tearing at the crotch. If you wash the jeans, the water will loosen the fabric in the crotch making the jeans last longer and lessen the chance for crotch blowouts.  Some denimheads do not like to wash their jeans at all (messes up the fades) and it tears. If you wash your jeans regularly, like every few months you should be fine.   One thing you can do is get the crotch reinforced. that should help any potential tearing."
rawdenim,3c8f0f,wangus9,0,Mon Jul 6 02:35:31 2015 UTC,"Raw denim for the most part is better constructed, so in theory it should last longer. That being said, some people are prone to holes and even heavier weight denim won't stop that."
rawdenim,3c8f0f,btharveyku08,0,Sun Jul 5 22:14:44 2015 UTC,"I mean, it won't stop holes, but heavier denim could delay their appearance. And for someone who essentially stipulates that their jeans don't ever last them beyond six months, I'd say that's not nothing.

rawdenim,3c7dkw,cheddarvillains,10,Sun Jul 5 16:17:19 2015 UTC,"You'll be better off just washing when you think they smell, and kudos for you for actually acknowledging that they smell. There are a few people here and on other denim communities that simply refuse to wash their jeans for prolonged amounts of time, and to me that's just really unpleasant to think about. Sounds like you'll be washing a little more often than a lot of us do (I personally wash about every month or two), but hey, that's part of your lifestyle that'll be reflected in the appearance of your jeans and it's definitely not a bad thing."
rawdenim,3c7dkw,louuster,5,Sun Jul 5 16:25:39 2015 UTC,"Its kinda the opposite actually, washing more often can help them last a bit longer. Not washing often is to create more contrasting fades, for the most part."
rawdenim,3c7dkw,dakaf_fal,3,Sun Jul 5 16:57:19 2015 UTC,"The stigma against washing comes from sanforized denim, which is typically much more difficult to fade than unsanforized. The long time between washes is detrimental to the lifespan of your jeans, but creates higher contrast fades. On the other hand I've found that unsanforized denim looks great, even with frequent washes."
rawdenim,3c7dkw,FricasseeingRabbit,2,Sun Jul 5 17:21:36 2015 UTC,How true is this? I've seen some great fades on this sub with sanfordized denim
rawdenim,3c7dkw,olerth,3,Sun Jul 5 18:11:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, APCs and unbranded are both sanforized, but are both some of the fastest faders out there."

rawdenim,3c7dkw,dakaf_fal,2,Sun Jul 5 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"I'm talking from personal experience, so YMMV. But I've found that I have to put in a lot more wear to get fades out of sanforized denim.  There are exceptions to this, such as Unbranded, which fade quickly regardless of sanforization. Likewise, there are also people who wear sanforized everyday and never wash them. If you wear any raw denim for, say, 2 years and don't wash them, they'll also get some impressive fades. I remember a couple years ago APCs with an ocean wash at one year was pretty popular. This method got some great fades, regardless of sanforization, it just wasn't good for the longevity of the denim.  If you're interested in the unsanforized v sanforized debate, I'd check out some interviews with Kiya. He's a huge advocate for unsanforized denim, and can probably explain the differences much more eloquently than I can."

rawdenim,3c7dkw,ShawnBootygod,3,Sun Jul 5 17:33:09 2015 UTC,"The type of fades have to do with many factors.

So yes US Cotton can effect the outcome of the fades, but not that alone"
rawdenim,3c7dkw,youngofthesoonest,5,Sun Jul 5 17:53:08 2015 UTC,I think you're getting US cotton mixed up with US made denim from Cone Mills. US cotton is used by mills around the world.
rawdenim,3c7dkw,cheddarvillains,3,Sun Jul 5 20:20:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not certain but I think the way a fabric fades has more to do with its production process rather than its cotton origin. The mill producing the fabric has control over factors like the uniformity of the threads/yarns being made, how those are dyed, and how they're woven. Those factors would seem to contribute more to a fabric's fade characteristics than the cotton origin might. I think where the cotton comes from would have more effect on the texture, like its softness and maybe neppiness"

rawdenim,3c7dkw,discrepancies,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:02:51 2015 UTC,I haven't looked very carefully at all yet. I figured I'd ask first. Another caveat I should have mentioned is that I'd prefer a lighter weight as I live in south Florida.

rawdenim,3c7dkw,cheddarvillains,3,Sun Jul 5 19:49:04 2015 UTC,"If you like your 634s, I think Iron Heart makes a black version. Otherwise, Samurai S5000BK?"
rawdenim,3c7dkw,H2Otoo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:30:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, IH has several black 634s's, but I have almost out grown the legs on mine. And the numbers on the S5000BK look close, but with shrinkage and not being able to actually try them on I am hesitant.   I do like the looks of the Iron heart 1955s, which seems pretty close to a pair of raw wranglers I picked up recently. However, neither the IH or Wranglers are available in black."

rawdenim,3c7dkw,clt3,2,Mon Jul 6 01:38:58 2015 UTC,"Ueno has a lot. Hinoya is a great place to go to. Also Bears in Shimokitazawa. I think Momotaro has their own retail store in Tokyo. Not too sure though. But since you're visiting Japan, look into some of the Japanese brands that aren't as popular in the U.S. A lot of them are really good for their prices."

rawdenim,3c7deh,todayismyluckyday,2,Mon Jul 6 11:24:34 2015 UTC,"Well, seeing as how you haven't sold them yet, maybe you can give this a shot. I have a pair of NF left hand twill jeans and they are 2 sizes down from my regular size. When i first bought them, i thought I had messed up in that they were too damn tight. I could barely button the jeans and my thighs were really constricted. But I struggled through it and bore with it and eventually they streched...and streched and streched. Right now, I feel like they streched too much and I want to wash them just to shrink them back a little. Have you tried actually wearing them for an extended period of time?  I've heard this a lot about NF jeans. The fact that they stretch substantially is pretty well known.  If not, good luck on the sale."
rawdenim,3c7deh,hazlos,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:40:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those and I'm trying to loose some weight, so maybe that would help too. Trying to stretch the taper a bit too as they're slightly a pain to get on and off with them so tough."

These have a zipper fly finished with a golden button. The button isn't perfect, but hopefully it's not something that would bug you too much.

Cash added on my end. Something like NF E3/E4. Preferably new or barely worn.

rawdenim,3cbip4,admiralblue,3,Mon Jul 6 19:01:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I get it. What does ""deep pocket"" refer to?"
rawdenim,3cbip4,monsoon4,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:29:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe the denim company deep pocket? Cone mills, some raw and some selvedge. I'd never heard of it, but that was the first result on Google. Their signature trait is literally deep pockets, 12-14"" deep. This is the most exaggerated back pocket on the Lloyd Wright fit, I think most of the ""deep pockets"" refers to the front pockets."

rawdenim,3c9kn7,Internet_Patrol,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:03:32 2015 UTC,"Button it, toss it inside out into the washer on small load so the water is minimal and it can bleed back onto itself, add detergent (I like woolite black), cold/cold , gentle cycle, low spin, hang dry.    Smell will be gone and it'll wear much easier.    There will be some shrinkage but it'll stretch back out with wear.    Personally not a fan of starch because it's a breeding ground for bacteria which means more stink but that's just my 2¬¢"
rawdenim,3c9kn7,tman916x,0,Mon Jul 6 04:07:38 2015 UTC,"What about just soaking it in a bathtub? I don't have any Woolite black, but I read somewhere that a cup of vinegar can lock the dye in, so to speak. I just want the smell and the oil to be gone with minimal side effects."
rawdenim,3c9kn7,tman916x,2,Mon Jul 6 04:50:52 2015 UTC,"Bathtub is totally fine, I do it from time to time but it doesn't eliminate the smell as much as a washing machine will.    Never tried vinegar so I can't speak to that.  FWIW, I used to be so meticulous with washing denim from setting timers during their soaks, measuring out the amount of detergent used, spot washing, etc. Now I really don't care as much.  I'll soak them once every 2-3 months, shower with them on when they get a bit smelly, and throw them in the washer when they get really funky.  I like washing because it's the most convenient and sanitary since the machine agitates them for me and spins them so I don't have to wring out excess water which makes drying a breeze.   Between all 3 washing techniques I'd say the difference is somewhat negligible but then again I'm not someone who really chases high contrast fades."
rawdenim,3c9kn7,tman916x,0,Mon Jul 6 04:59:33 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, fading is sort of a lost cause with this particular product if other users are to be believed. I'm interested in the showering technique: Inside out? Cold water? How much shrinkage should I expect?  Thanks for all the help, by the way :)"
rawdenim,3c9kn7,tman916x,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:07:09 2015 UTC,"Naw I'd shower with them on, rightside out, in somewhat warm (not as hot as usual) water.  This is one of my favorite methods in the summer.  I'll let all the soap, shampoo, body wash, etc. soak all over them.  I've also got a back scrubber kinda like this that I'll use to brush some extra body wash onto them around the most faded areas (thighs, behind knees, whisker area, back pockets) because those are arguably the smelliest regions from all the sweat.    No probem for the help.  I remember trying to figure all this sheezy out for the first time and there being so little info but thanks to this sub there's so many more resources out there.  Also, let me make a distinction that I don't own any denim jackets so all these techniques I've been highlighting are tried and tested with jeans but I can't really imagine there's that much of a difference."
rawdenim,3c9kn7,tman916x,0,Mon Jul 6 05:12:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks a bunch! I'm guessing since body wash is made for human skin it won't be too damaging, but I think I'll just run cold water for now. Then again, it might not get all the oils off but I can just hop in tomorrow night and give it a scrub. And with that, I'm off to shower with my jacket on like a normal adult. This sounds fun!"
rawdenim,3c52mw,collinburris,23,Sat Jul 4 21:31:03 2015 UTC,Nice. You have to upgrade those hangers. So out of place.
rawdenim,3c52mw,Grazfather,5,Sat Jul 4 21:55:36 2015 UTC,Upgrade them to what?
rawdenim,3c52mw,Tofon,6,Sat Jul 4 22:47:22 2015 UTC,This is Self Edge's hanger: http://www.selfedge.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=1326  But you could also use a good metal pants hanger like they have at the container store: http://www.containerstore.com/shop/closet/hangers/specialty?productId=10033108&N=146
rawdenim,3c52mw,LimousineAndAPeetzah,5,Sun Jul 5 00:28:36 2015 UTC,What's so special about this design and material? Steels seems like expensive over kill just to achieve the rugged aesthetic.
rawdenim,3c52mw,tumtumtomtom,4,Sun Jul 5 17:14:57 2015 UTC,"We should really crowd source some of those hangers. Not from self edge, where they are $44 each (including shipping), but just some random welder. I was thinking about posting an ad on my community craft places wall. $20, $25 seems fair, considering there's only one weld and some very simple bending."
rawdenim,3c52mw,Sherblock,2,Sun Jul 5 03:43:36 2015 UTC,"/u/salsa_z5 made a these for /u/pudaspriest for our Secret Santa. He talked about making some for other people, I don't know if he ever did."
rawdenim,3c52mw,d4mini0n,2,Sun Jul 5 04:20:32 2015 UTC,"$44 actually seems like a really good price for those hangers. They aren't welded, they look hand forged and that is pretty pricy stuff."
rawdenim,3c52mw,_StingraySam_,3,Sun Jul 5 06:22:21 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm missing something, the pictures on the website look like there's a weld in the middle. It just looks like the weld has been really well shaped."
rawdenim,3c52mw,e3super,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:54:01 2015 UTC,"There's a weld but you can hand weld, which would be pretty expensive and if it wasn't the weld would be the least expensive part of the hanger."
rawdenim,3c52mw,_StingraySam_,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:55:50 2015 UTC,"sure they're high quality and your great-great-great-grandchildren will still have it, but you're still paying $44 for one hanger"
rawdenim,3c52mw,FreeCharlesManson,2,Mon Jul 6 05:56:29 2015 UTC,"Well we should think of the Self Edge one as a premium one, then. Someone should still make a budget one. $44 for something to hang jeans is a bit much for most people. If you had three pairs, and wanted three hangers, it'd run you $118!!   Now I know there are cheaper options, but we can all recognize that they don't work as well as the SE ones. Especially when you take into account the weight of some of the stuff people have.   Maybe I'll take up welding, haha. I'd be sure to let you all know."
rawdenim,3c52mw,Sherblock,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:35:13 2015 UTC,I would definitely be in for a set of hangers like that. Not for $40 though. $15-$20 seems reasonable for a crowd source.

rawdenim,3c42f2,dennisrodwoman,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:33:55 2015 UTC,"Im in the market for some SKs right now, did you size down one? I tried on a pair at my local store, i usually wear a 30 and that was the lowest size they had in stock , they were about a half inch too big in the waist but pretty tight in the thighs, to where I would think going down to a 29 might just be too tight in the thigh even with stretching, so I was thinking of just getting the 30s and getting the waist altered slightly, any suggestions?"
rawdenim,3c42f2,light_switch,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:10:50 2015 UTC,"I definitely wouldn't recommend getting the waist altered. The denim will definitely stretch and the pricing for getting the waist done will be a lot more than a taper. I'm a true 29 but I sized two down because the waist stretches a lot. The SK will hug a lot in the calves so take into consideration as you size down for the waist the calves and thighs would be tighter. If you have larger calves and thighs, look into the Stanton's instead. Blueowl workshop has accurate measurements."

rawdenim,3c42hx,BearSkull,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:21:00 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone. I'm looking to get my first proper pair of raws and was hoping for a bit of input. Up to this point I've done three pairs of 501 STFs (31x36 and 32x38 most recently) and want something a bit different.  I've been looking at either the UB heavyweight 21oz or N&F 19oz heavy soft selvedge. My question is most related to fit, tapered/weird guy vs skinny. I have moved over to wearing 511s more (sized 32x34), but they don't work well while cycling. Unless there is stretch in the fabric they are too tight in the hips and thighs. Ideally I'd like 501 up top, 511 down low, which I think would be closer to the tapered fits.  If anyone has some personal comparison to how all these fits stack up against one another I'd appreciate it. On top of that anything relating to the fabrics compared to one another would also be great, thanks!"
rawdenim,3c42hx,syncope32,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:42:35 2015 UTC,"Never had the N&F 19 oz, but did have a pair of WeirdGuys and I have the UB221. It takes a little bit to stretch, but they will stretch. I personally feel that the rise on the N&F is lower than those on the UB's. I love my UB221, it feels solid, but I think the N&F looks a bit more premium in terms of dye and feel.   The fabrics are fine and they're both fine. Just remember it is a B**** to break in because its so stiff and heavy, but once it does it's golden. Based on your criteria, I would recommend the UB221 it has the 501 top block with the taper. The taper isn't too tapered (so tailor if you'd like) but it gets the job done!"
rawdenim,3c42hx,BearSkull,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:01:32 2015 UTC,"Very helpful, thank you! I for sure need extra room in the top block area, so sounds like the 200 series is for me."

I am wondering if this fading is indicative of an imminent blowout and if there is anything that I can do preemptively to prevent it like washing it or sewing on a patch from the inside?
rawdenim,3c42hx,619rko9,3,Sat Jul 4 17:56:01 2015 UTC,"at the moment that's just some indigo rubbing off from the friction of your thighs, if the area starts to feel and look more thin, then you could probably reinforce it.   With slimmer denim, it's almost impossible to not have crotch blowouts"

And yeah, I'm a total novice when it comes to raw denim, BUT I have been very interested in giving it a try for a while now. I'm at the cusp of ordering my first pair of jeans, but I'm split as to what weight of denim I should consider. I'm looking to start with two pairs, the featherweight denim (5oz) and the sumi ink (12oz) both by N&F, but I was wondering what weight of denim I should consider. The 5oz jeans just seem fascinating as an idea, and honestly, I HATE the heat, but I understand it's a REALLY low density, and if that would affect quality. I'll also be heading up to Vermont for college, and I know heavier weight denims are much better for that weather, so I'm not sure if I should delay purchasing a heavier weight denim until their F/W selection comes out Basically, in a nutshell, I'm wondering: A. Are 5oz jeans worth considering for a guy who doesn't like heat, B. are 12oz good for a starter pair, and C. should I buy a heavier weight pair in winter? Thanks!"
rawdenim,3c42hx,RawOwyn,2,Sat Jul 4 20:59:05 2015 UTC,"I have a pair of featherweights that I bought a size down, i can button them up and wear them, but the fabric at the crotch is coming apart near the seams because of the stress put on it from stretching. Id say to definitely go tts for the feathweights. That being said, they are a great pair for the summer, and I find that i can either wear them or wear shorts without too much of a problem (I can't stand the heat either). If you do go for them, you would probably need a second pair for the winter, unless you can deal with the cold well."
rawdenim,3c42hx,Burlin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:16:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah, I definitely want to upgrade to something at the other end of the spectrum around 16-22 oz for this winter, something more hardcore when I KNOW I'll be wearing jeans everyday. And yeah, regarding the sumi, is it good to go for 12 oz, or should I look around 14 oz?"
rawdenim,3c42hx,wangus9,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:39:39 2015 UTC,12 to 14oz is pretty standard for starter raw jeans. Can't go wrong either way.
rawdenim,3c42hx,RawOwyn,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:44:19 2015 UTC,"The difference between 12 & 14 is pretty negligible, go for what you like.

That said, I'd check out Tate+Yoko, Blue Owl, and Self Edge for raw options. I don't know your price range, so I've suggested sites that have options from ~$130-$450. The less expensive jeans can generally be found on Tate+Yoko. Blue Owl has some of the same stock as Tate+Yoko, plus some in the mid-range of cost. Self Edge generally sells ""end game"" options that are in the $300-$450 range."

rawdenim,3c2tkw,Sabeatin,5,Sat Jul 4 05:57:37 2015 UTC,Nudie Thin Finn Dry Stretch. I've had these for about 5 years now. I wore them almost every day for about 18 months and then took them out of rotation.  I don't wear them a whole lot anymore mainly because of the amount of times I've had to repair the crotch. I'd say I've repaired them about 5 times (they are due for another repair).  The button also popped after about a year (even though they weren't really tight on my waist). I had it repaired as best I could but you can totally just take the button out. When I have them on though the tension is enough that the button doesn't pop out so it's never been an issue.  5 years ago I thought it would be cool to leave a bunch of guitar picks in my coin pocket... I thought that was pretty cool at the time.  There are also a few holes here and there. One on my phone pocket and one starting to grow on my knee. Overall they feel pretty flimsy now... the latest hole in the knee happened very quickly when I was playing with my son.  These were my first raws. If I could go back I probably would have had the crotch fixed properly the first time as that's eventually what made me stop wearing them. Whoever first fixed them kind of messed up the fit and they've never been the same. They were super comfortable but now when I sit down in them I kind of notice that they aren't right... nothing major but I'd rather wear something that feels like a second skin. If it weren't for the crotch I feel like they would have more life in them.  Edit: Forgot to say what wash they are.
rawdenim,3c2tkw,dnomis,3,Sat Jul 4 05:58:49 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I'll say it again: Thin Finns are the main, if not only, reason Nudie gets a bad rep for their weak crotches. Skinny jeans + low wearing crotch means it'll tear in no time.   That being said, those TFs look amazing on you. You can really see the effort you put in to that pair. The guitar pick is a really nice detail as well.   I should really start wearing my TFs. So many jeans, so little time ;_;"
rawdenim,3c2tkw,Sewol,2,Sat Jul 4 09:39:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I totally agree. I've had a few other pairs of jeans that are tighter than these and the crotch is fine.   It sucks because I like having the low crotch I just wish they would reinforce it or something.

rawdenim,3c2tkw,Sewol,2,Sat Jul 4 11:02:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess they're sort of skinny if all you wear is 501's and such, but Nudie's have a great range of actually skinny jeans now, my tight long johns are by far my most comfy jeans."
rawdenim,3c2tkw,dnomis,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:05:48 2015 UTC,Yeah it's weird I actually bought a replacement pair about a year ago. I got the same size and didn't try them on (pretty stupid I know).

rawdenim,3c24rl,Nick_Tanner,2,Sat Jul 4 09:37:12 2015 UTC,DSW used to carry 1000 mile boots that were made in China. I assume they just have seconds/lower quality ones which aren't intended for sale in higher end boutiques. There's definitely a difference in quality between the MiUSA and China.

Both the Flat Heads and Strike Golds were amazing jeans, but the fits just weren't working for my body. I already have a pair of 3Sixteen ST-120x's that I absolutely love (see pics above), so I at least had a general sense of what I was getting myself into. I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised at the character of the Kibata denim - quite a bit hairier than I was expecting!  In terms of sizing, I actually went 2 sizes up from my Shadow Selvedge (32 vs. 34), and did a 30-minute hot soak to get the shrinking out. Will be going back to SELA this afternoon to get these hemmed.

I was told by one of the people who work at Iron Heart that before I wear them I am going to need to soak and agitate the denim. Is this true? What are the  benefits and or consequences of doing such? Sorry if this is the wrong place for such a question.   Also, I would love to commend the customer service people over at Iron Heart, I ordered going off of tag size, although it clearly states not to do so right on their website. They emailed, called, and emailed me again to make sure I had all of my measurements right so they could send me a pair that fit me correctly. Great people over at Iron Heart, highly recommend them as a company."

rawdenim,3c0tz6,wyzzzzzard,2,Fri Jul 3 22:38:25 2015 UTC,"So they say to soak and agitate the jeans to bed in the threading. If you are getting the regular 666s jeans, its an 18oz unsanforized ""raw"" denim, so you will wanna get the soak water hot as you can so they shrink as much as possible.   Anyways, have fun and welcome to the IH crew!"
rawdenim,3c0tz6,besundale,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:07:36 2015 UTC,"I soak and agitate every single pair of raws before wearing. Air dry of course, it causes them to be nice and stiff, and makes them take the creases that we all want much more easily."

rawdenim,3c0tz6,besundale,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:52:13 2015 UTC,"I personally use hot water, as hot as my water heater makes it. For agitation I'll just use my hands and move the jeans around in the water, maybe squish them together and straighten them out again.

rawdenim,3c0tz6,FreeCharlesManson,0,Sat Jul 4 02:26:28 2015 UTC,"Most Iron hearts are sanforized (which means shrinkage will be minimal) so soaking them before wear isn't necessary, but if the denim is unsanforized you will see a lot of shrinking.

rawdenim,3c0tz6,michael_is_awesome,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:23:22 2015 UTC,They feel pretty light. Medium weight denim I think. No more than 16oz I think.

rawdenim,3c0tz6,youngofthesoonest,2,Fri Jul 3 23:37:04 2015 UTC,"i find that if you want intense roping, it helps to get the jeans hemmed before any soak esp with unsanforized. flip side is that you'll have to be pretty sure about how much the jean will shrink."
rawdenim,3c0tz6,clt3,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:57:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. And considering how it's because of the feed of the chain stitching machine that causes the roping, I'm not even sure if the roping will pucker at the same spots. Idk though"
rawdenim,3c0tz6,fitzghon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:06:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would work out well. In my experience exposure to water (soaking, washes) and wear are the best ways for roping to develop provided it was chainstitched on the right machine."
rawdenim,3c0tz6,Elf_Sedge,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:18:58 2015 UTC,"Depends on how it's hemmed. Usually only Union Special 43200G(?)'s get you the intense roping we want, it has a higher thread tension. But yeah I guess it could with a normal chainstitch as well.."

The color in that guy's pictures match the color on the description page fairly closely.  The difference between mine and the page are very different.  I like the jeans and might even keep them, but they are not what I ordered.  I appreciate your help, but I don't want to wait another couple months."
rawdenim,3c2x0q,dn0c,2,Sat Jul 4 07:29:59 2015 UTC,"If they are supposed to look like the ones in the pic you just posted, then for sure you got the wrong pants. What you got looks like your basic indigo raw denim color. The fit pics you posted on this comment look more like a color you'd see on chinos.  If anything, I would take a few pics tomorrow and send them in to see what they can do. Thry might have a few pairs in your size laying around. If not, maybe they can offer some sort of credit discount towards future purchases for your troubles."
rawdenim,3c2x0q,dn0c,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:05:54 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought too. Regular indigo, nothing special.  And I hope what you say is true! That'd be perfect!"
rawdenim,3c2x0q,pleegray,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:30:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry, while reading your comment i reread the thread and I think i may have commented in error. I did not notice that the Italian sea blue #156 was different than the original questioned color #216 Italian Breeze. My initial comment was saying that the fit pics of the #156 pair did not match the fit pics you posted of your own #216 pair.  But I stand by my original comment that the pants you got look more like regular indigo. It could be the lighting, but I don't see any difference from your pics to my own indigo jeans I am wearing now. HOWEVER, I also don't see a difference in their original sample photos as well. If it were me buying the jeans, I would have looked at the sample and assumed all that talk of Italian denim and color was marketing mumbo jumbo and I was just buying a regular pair of indigo blue denim. You said you liked the color so just go with it. But I would email Gustin to see what they say about the color. To see if was an error or if your pants are in fact ""Italian Breeze"", lol."
rawdenim,3c2x0q,quickly_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:55:34 2015 UTC,"Are you 100% sure they sent you the wrong pair, or is there a chance that the lighting just shows it off differently?"
rawdenim,3c2x0q,pleegray,0,Sat Jul 4 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"The color changes slightly depending on whether it is under daylight or artificial tungsten light, but is still nowhere close to the bright blue pictured and described on the product page.  I cannot say whether they accidentally sent/mislabeled the wrong pair, or if they greatly over exaggerated the color."

EDIT: one quick thing - I think that if you take the free Blue Apron meal, they may require you to sign up with a credit card for at least 3 meals, which basically just amounts to a 33% discount. You can easily cancel at any time, but just a heads-up that it's not completely no-strings-attached."

I'm not entirely sure what I expected 220 dollar denim to offer, but I was moderately disappointed to open up a bag of black jeans. Nothing jumped out as spectacular. Had a hard time justifying them to people when they saw them.   However, they look and feel great and I ended up being quite happy with the purchase. I'm super excited to see the fades because I honestly have no idea how black/black will look. The construction is flawless and everything feels very sturdy. I love the early stages where it's still stiff and uniformly colored.  The 11oz denim is nice and lightweight but not too thin.

Earlier on, there were concerns about getting the numbers to make this project work through ebbets on our end and I gaged the interest of /r/streetwear to see if things would work.  The mods there gave me the green light to share this project over there.    Also, no worries about getting your size.  As long as you place your order within the buying period (most likely 1 week long) you'll get your hat.  Only reason the Ebbets x Gustin x /r/rawdenim run was so limited was because Gustin supplied the fabric so there was only a finite amount of hats that could be made."

rawdenim,3bvv8y,d_wilson123,3,Thu Jul 2 23:08:26 2015 UTC,Looks good throughout but I'd probably hem.  But I'm not a huge stacker.
rawdenim,3bvv8y,fitzghon,2,Thu Jul 2 16:16:24 2015 UTC,Fit is fantastic. I'd keep them at this length and go with the single cuff. The stacking looks very natural and the 51xx fabric has great drape so letting the material settle naturally has a great appearance.
rawdenim,3bvv8y,FreeCharlesManson,2,Thu Jul 2 17:46:16 2015 UTC,single cuff rocks man
rawdenim,3bvv8y,illcutz,2,Thu Jul 2 17:50:45 2015 UTC,"Single for me, but both look good. Also depends on the footwear you will mostly use."
rawdenim,3bvv8y,bootsnpantsnboots,2,Thu Jul 2 19:01:50 2015 UTC,So I see this when people ask about apcs mostly. I don't understand how the waist of a pair of jeans can stretch out too much. What causes a jeans to strecth further than the waist of a person. I understand if someone strecths it to a certain point and then loses weight. But I there's something I'm not getting here
rawdenim,3bvv8y,clt3,7,Thu Jul 2 16:54:33 2015 UTC,When most people sit down their waist ends up expanding and putting pressure on the waistband. So after a while the person ends up with a waistband that stretches past the waistline of the person while standing up.
rawdenim,3bvv8y,bootsnpantsnboots,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:57:22 2015 UTC,Hadn't thought of that thanks. But I can't imagine that happening to the point of the jeans becoming unwearable but I guess some people are picky like that.
rawdenim,3bvv8y,clt3,2,Thu Jul 2 17:04:40 2015 UTC,I feel the same way. I just use a belt and it solves the problems. I've always thought that jeans without belts look somewhat off anyway.
rawdenim,3bvv8y,Elf_Sedge,3,Thu Jul 2 17:09:55 2015 UTC,"What happens with me is that I start off wearing them on my waist and that stretches so they sit lower and stretch moar, then when I try to wear them on my waist again, nooope"
rawdenim,3bvv8y,ninthway,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:53:38 2015 UTC,Exactly.
rawdenim,3bvv8y,ASlags,2,Fri Jul 3 01:51:54 2015 UTC,"It can depend on the weave of the fabric. Oni's and PBJ's have a pretty loose weave, and are unsanforized. So you shrink them with water they stretch back out primarily in the waist. The looseness of the weave can allow for more stretching.   Cotton by nature can stretch as well. The waist of a jean also has some stress put on it due to the body moving.  Hope this helps somewhat."
rawdenim,3bvv8y,bootsnpantsnboots,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:01:13 2015 UTC,No I get denim stretching but not past someone's waist. But the other comment covered it thanks.

rawdenim,3bvv8y,louuster,4,Thu Jul 2 17:37:05 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, it can be tubular knit without being loopwheeled. Lot of cheap 3-pack type tshirts dont have side seams but the body is still knit in a tube, but not specifically with the gravity fed machines that loopwheeling is associated with.  For that one in particular, I honestly have no idea."
rawdenim,3bvv8y,JammySTB,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:34:48 2015 UTC,"And likewise, a t shirt could be made with loopwheeled fabric but cut so that it's no longer in a tube.  It's also worth noting that loopwheeled fabric isn't neccesarily better than non-loopwheeled fabric.

rawdenim,3bvv8y,fitzghon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:33:16 2015 UTC,I have the 2009's and upon closer inspection I'd agree: the fabric has some slight slubbiness to it. It's certainly nowhere near to the slubbiness that PBJs or the weft in the SG 51xx's.

rawdenim,3bvx6e,Robocob0,12,Thu Jul 2 16:24:13 2015 UTC,Also! A Levi 501 is closer to samurai 5000vx not 3000vx. The 3000 is a very relaxed fit while the 5000 is more of a slim straight. The 710vx (xx as well) is a slight taper.

rawdenim,3bvx6e,KeepOnLying,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:35:22 2015 UTC,You should have went with the Blue in Green sizing since Rakuten sizings are notoriously generic (and therefore inaccurate).

rawdenim,3bvx6e,ItsUhhEctoplasm,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:49:28 2015 UTC,"Not sure what your personal style is, but as far as I know Samurai jeans run about $300 USD. That's far too expensive to pay for jeans that you aren't 100% in love with. Don't get hung up on the fact that you will have to ship them back and wait for a new pair. It will be way better to have to wait for jeans you want and will wear proudly, than have jeans that you are meh about and won't wear cause everyone says they are too big for you. If the ""Buy, sell, trade"" thread here is any indication, there are many people who regret keeping jeans that didn't fit them right and now are trying to sell off unwanted stock.   As everyone has already mentioned, measure all aspects of jeans you already have and like the fit of. Then go here and pick out the size that is closest to what you have. If you don't know how to measure pants, go here for a guide.  Looks like the jeans are unsanforized, so they will shrink after washing. If you like jeans to be a little relaxed/loose, then size up one.   The 3000vx as a whole are baggy/loose fit jeans. As long as you know that, then you should be able to judge how they will shrink and what you want to get out of them in the end.  Personally, I would never buy these model of jeans. They are way too big in the leg. But again, it's all about your own style."

rawdenim,3bsqk9,W0MP_W0MP_W0MP,22,Wed Jul 1 22:40:54 2015 UTC,"From what I gathered, this is what happened:   WiL11o6's wife gets home from buying groceries. (He presumably stayed home since there were groceries in and/or on the front passenger sat) WiL11o6 sees her pull into the driveway through the living room window. He gets up, goes outside, and offers to bring the groceries into the house, all while holding his cell phone. Had she called/texted him soon before that, to announce her arrival? Possibly. Wife hands him the car keys.  WiL11o6 unlocks the car, opens the front passenger door, then locks the car with the door still open. Groceries are in the front passenger seat, staring him in the face. Now, because his pockets were so tight, he decides to just put down the keys and phone in the most convenient space at the time: onto the seat. It's WiL11o6's intention to run the groceries into the house and come back for the phone and keys. His wife incorrectly assumes that her husband has nicely workable pocket, then closes the door, because of course WiL11o6 took the keys out - he's got pockets to put them in. Keys are actually on the seat."

Beware of light coloured jackets with the same material (PVC I believe) that Elka makes... I got the yellow one which I love but the one thing I found is that it gets stained easily.

rawdenim,3bs92c,delphic_star,3,Wed Jul 1 19:35:08 2015 UTC,"I have the 62. Never washed though. However, I read through the iron heart thread two whole times before I bought and the consensus was that they initially assumed it would act like an unsanforized fabric and shrink a whole size but most people didn't get more than a half size of shrinkage out of it with machine washing. Head over to the iron heart thread and you can probably find a few measurement comparisons between raw and unwashed.   For me, I went with a size small and I'm a 39"" chest. It's a slim fit but I like that look with westerns.   Here's some fit photos of mine. http://imgur.com/a/6pxyH"
rawdenim,3bs92c,btharveyku08,2,Wed Jul 1 20:45:37 2015 UTC,"If I could get that fit, that would be fantastic. My main sticking point is twofold: 1) I have an XXL IHSH-105 and I love the fit (23.4"" chest measurement), but the XL and XXL of the IHSH-62 are 23.0"" and 24.0"", respectively; and I cannot find a single shop on Rakuten that sells any XXLs.  That shirt / fit looks awesome, btw."
rawdenim,3bs92c,delphic_star,2,Thu Jul 2 00:53:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks dude, I appreciate it! Considering 23.4 is basically halfway between the xl and xxl of the 62, and the 62 shrinks about half a size, i think its safe to say you would get the best fit out of an xxl and a hot soak would probably do the trick.  There is one XXL left at self edge for 300.  Additionally, If that ends up going out of stock for whatever reason before you decide, VaterundSohn (info@vaterundsohn-hamburg.com) often stocks IH stuff. My brother and I got our IHSH-75s when IHUK was out of stock last summer.   If youre really banking on that rakuten price, I would ask in the 62 thread on IHUK and see if/when Giles will be getting a restock to see if there will be some more funneling into the rakuten shops as well.    Finally, if all else fails, there is the option of going with the 7oz chambray version. I hope this was helpful and if theres anything else I can chime in about let me know!"
rawdenim,3btdie,-Dillon-,6,Thu Jul 2 00:04:37 2015 UTC,"Thighs do look tight but should stretch over time. Also to get great fitting raws, find a pair of jeans or pants that you have that you love the fit of. Measure them. Then compare the measurements to the different fits and brands on Blue Owl and/ or Blue in Green. Also use their measurement methods as many places use a different method"

rawdenim,3btdie,Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeit,2,Thu Jul 2 22:09:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a rookie myself, but from what I've seen, all of my raws have stretched out at least an inch or so in every measurment (waist, thigh, knee, leg opening). I like my jeans to be snug and have a small leg opening, so I size down one and eventually it gets to where I like it to be.  Yours look about where I start and I eventually end up being able to pinch fabric in the thighs. So if that's what you're looking for, I think you should be fine.  As for color, that's another topic altogether. Since it's a lighter denim, you won't see as much pronounced fading, but I think you already knew that.  I own one pair of NF jeans and they are really a great bargain. You can easily find them for under $100, but they are of high quality construction. Great buy."

rawdenim,3btdie,FreeCharlesManson,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:00:29 2015 UTC,"I mainly slav squat for several minutes at a time.  It really helps if you build up a bit of a sweat while wearing them, and then squat. The dampness of the denim combined with the expansion of your thighs when squatting wI'll stretch out the denim plenty.  I think the only material that I would have trouble stretching out, might be anything considered ""stretch denim"". I've read here and there that stretch denim does indeed stretch, but it will go back to original size due to the elastin in the material. I don't own any stretch denim so I wouldn't know."
rawdenim,3btdie,rayguun,4,Thu Jul 2 16:21:38 2015 UTC,if you bought these hoping for sick fades your probably going to have a bad time just based on the colour of the denim and the weight. anyways i think the jeans look good on you you could get some intense stacks going on

rawdenim,3btdie,p00f1ng3r,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:00:34 2015 UTC,Fit looks okay but I hope you are taking them to be hemmed since I don't think big cuffs like those work on slimmer fits.  Also your pair might be prone to crotch blowout though. This is because a combination of thigh tightness and lightweight fabric.

Something else to keep in mind is that the only jeans on this page that are selvedge are the ones that say selvedge in the title. Most of the jeans on this page are not selvedge.

The fit is fantastic, and the fabric is insane. Even non-raw-indoctrinated plebs that gaze upon these jeans comment on how sick they are. As a matter of fact, I like PBJs so much that I'm debating getting another pair, but of the 18oz model. I don't need it. I should not buy it. But god damn, I want to."
rawdenim,3br4an,dn0c,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:01:45 2015 UTC,"I was looking at the 18oz last night at BiG. The denim is amazing but the rise was inevitably too high to even consider buying.

rawdenim,3br4an,dn0c,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:36:37 2015 UTC,"I just took another look at the sizing chart. You're right, that's a hell of a lot of rise. I'm decently tall, but idk that might even be too much rise for me. The xx-012s fit me perfectly, and maybe i would enjoy a tad bit more rise, and more taper, but the 18oz version looks like it may have way too much rise on front and back.

rawdenim,3bs93a,TRBlizzard121,3,Thu Jul 2 08:33:32 2015 UTC,"E: wasn't first :c   The jeans in question are a size 36  My 1st question: with my PBJ XX-012's I have a bunch of excess fabric  example 2  They were unsanforized and my first soak was in meh temp water in bathtub, but then I put them in my washing machine on hot to get the extra shrink out, it worked mostly everywhere else but that extra is still there, does it mean that part didn't shrink? There's also a bit more extra fabric below my butt. What's the reason for all this extra and is there any way to reduce it? I measured the jeans and the top block is by the measurement a almost perfect fit for my top block, so I'm not sure why the fabric is there and why it's creasing and grouping like that.   2nd question, my leg opening measurement isn't the same as BiG's, mines a 8.5 instead of a 8, why is that? Is it because My water wasn't hot enough on the first soak? Sorry if the answers are obvious, first pair of unsanforized."
rawdenim,3bs93a,2krazie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:19:22 2015 UTC,"I think the excess fabric should turn out fine when you break them in. You'll just have more spaced out whiskering.   On your second question, are yiu comparing the raw measurements with yours or are comparing with the one washed?"
rawdenim,3bs93a,TRBlizzard121,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:59:59 2015 UTC,Once washed with mine.
rawdenim,3bs93a,2krazie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:46:49 2015 UTC,That's because the once washed versions are washed with the hottest water and put in the dryer after to get all the shrinkage out. Since you didn't soak your pair with hot water you still have some shrinkage on your jeans.
rawdenim,3bs93a,TRBlizzard121,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:58:05 2015 UTC,"I did a wash in my washing machine on hot/hot, was the water still not hot enough? I' hoping for a bit extra shrink if you can tell :p."

rawdenim,3bs93a,TRBlizzard121,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:08:28 2015 UTC,Yea ik it's just that when I look at my body measurements and compare them to the Jean measurements I feel like there is too much excess fabric.

rawdenim,3bs93a,pudaspriest,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:33:10 2015 UTC,"the fit probably isn't ideal for your body, Most of my jeans have at least that much extra in the thigh because my waist is big compared to my legs.

I realize that raw denim stretches and molds over time - my question here is how much, and a second part of this is: are these too small?  My fianc√©e thinks that due to the apparent pulling at the fly buttons is an indicator that these pants are too small and should be returned. I know these should stretch (I've worn them for maybe 30 hours total over 10 days), but I don't know how far, and if she's correct.   Even if she isn't correct and the waist will still stretch some, do you think these jeans look too small? I honestly have no idea.   For reference, I'm 5'6/153, and these are pulled as high as they can go and sit at my hip bones. Jeans rarely stay higher than where these fall due to my love handles, jeans any looser obviously fall lower.   http://imgur.com/pUQCE6O http://imgur.com/LSk4Ecb http://imgur.com/reRE6g7"

rawdenim,3bs93a,btharveyku08,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:33:08 2015 UTC,"You got them buttoned up, so that's not nothing, but that still looks too tight for my tastes.

rawdenim,3bs93a,btharveyku08,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:29:50 2015 UTC,"Well, those thighs and the top block look tight. You'll get the least stretch anywhere in the pair at the thigh. The hands will only stretch when they're strained, so from that standpoint, I'd recommend getting one size up, minimum. They'll still probably be a bit tight in the waist and thighs, but not enough you'll be much better off in the long-term.  Can you sit down and walk up stairs easily in them?"

rawdenim,3bs93a,btharveyku08,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:03:46 2015 UTC,"It sort of sounds like you're trying to convince others that you're good with how these fit. IMO, they are currently straining a lot to work right now, will be skintight when they're done stretching, and will blowout faster than a pair one size larger. If you look at how they currently sit, your SO is correct that they are straining at the fly, as well as the entire area where whiskers will eventually form.  Different denim stretches different amounts, so no one can tell you how much these will likely stretch. One good rule of thumb is that denim is usually done stretching in 15 or so wears. You're getting close to that, so they need to be near how you'd like them to ultimately fit by now.  You seem to think they're good (and that's cool ... different strokes for different folks and all), so it's really just your SO that you need to convince."
rawdenim,3bs93a,duffcalifornia,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:25:03 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your honesty. It's not that I like how they fit. It's just  1) I want them to fit as I'm scared I've already worn them too much to put them out of Gustin's return policy, making me out $90 2) I have no idea if they're small because they haven't stretched enough, or because they're actually small - though this comment leads me to see its the latter of the two.   I do really appreciate your input. I'm at about the lowest I've weighed in the last five years. I used to be 225. Sometimes I want to think I'm skinnier than I am; it's a holdover from my fat days I suppose. Part of me fits so I think all of me can. :/"

After two months of wear, I ended up determining I just couldn't make my $300 Momo collabs work for me. So I'm giving them to one if my brothers to see if they for him before trying to sell them here.  I started out the same way, thinking I should go slim-tapered with all of my jeans, as I liked the look. I ended up determining that slim-straights were as small as I could go, though, because we ultimately just need to get clothes that are flattering to our body types."

In all honesty if you're not at your end goal weight, don't buy a nice pair of jeans. And for people who say Gustin isn't nice, remember it's relative; $90 for jeans is still a lot to most people. Pick up a pair of Levi's or something until you are comfortable with where your weight is, and then reward yourself for getting those last pounds off by getting a nice pair of denim, whether that be a $90 pair of Gustin or a $600 pair of natural indigo PBJs.   The jeans look tight, yes, but try to return them and keep it up with the weight loss. You'll get there soon man and there's no better feeling than wearing a pair of jeans that fit fucking spot on. Good luck brother."
rawdenim,3bs93a,snecseruza,0,Thu Jul 2 13:19:31 2015 UTC,"TLDR: if you're looking for a comfortable, yet slim fit - you'll most likely be fine.  Typically you can expect 1-2"" of stretch in the waist, fabric and personal fit dependant. 30 hours of wear isn't much; I say roll with it.   When my first pair of raws arrived, I scoffed at the thought of getting them on. But with the prospect of the headache dealing with returning them overseas, I said fuck it and forced my way in. Pretty much skin tight through the top block, thighs and calf. Pushed through, and a year later I have a nice personalized, comfortable, slim fitting (yet plenty of room to move) pair of jeans (with some siiiiickkkkk fadez bruh) that I'm glad I kept.  It didn't take a full year, of course. I wore them everyday and rode them hard, and their current state fit-wise probably happened in about 20-30 days of daily, heavy wear or so. The max stretch won't happen overnight though, so get to wearing them and get moving.  Feel free to tell your girl she's wrong. I love that feel, bro. Good luck."

rawdenim,3bs93a,hanger,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:52:04 2015 UTC,Depends on where it is and how much stress you put on that area. Without the rivet you could tear out a pocket easier but if you're not worried about it then it shouldn't be too big of an issue.
rawdenim,3bs93a,deathbycheezburger,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:26:11 2015 UTC,I got a pretty simple question since I can't make heads or tails or these PBJ #s  So I really love the slub on the xx-18oz-015 but I find that its too tight on my thighs. Is there something else I can try that has the same taper but has a roomier thigh fit? Afaik these are cigarette slims? So maybe a slim taper if that exist?
rawdenim,3bs93a,Ramachandrann,2,Thu Jul 2 03:44:15 2015 UTC,Xx-012 is a slim taper but they're out almost everywhere. Denimio has a size 28 still left I believe.

rawdenim,3bs93a,Elf_Sedge,2,Thu Jul 2 16:49:38 2015 UTC,"Not really a good idea. Usually taking in the waist involves a lot of other changes in top block proportion and it's hard to get right.  Railcar can do it, but it'd be a waistband swap."
rawdenim,3bs93a,hanger,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:04:00 2015 UTC,Any local tailor should be able to do that. Just make sure that they are willing to work with thicker denim.

rawdenim,3brjwm,klew3,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:42:01 2015 UTC,Lots of these jeans never go on sale or very rarely so if there is minimal wear then someone out there will buy with enough patience; one simply needs to wait right buyer . Plus a higher start price is usually negotiated down.   UO does not fall into that category yet I'm sure he could have waited for $50 or even $60.

rawdenim,3bp93n,TRBlizzard121,3,Wed Jul 1 03:49:16 2015 UTC,"Would the copper in these (there is actual copper metal, right?) oxidize and turn green eventually? While these are much too glittery raw, I think an corroded-penny patina would be a really cool aspect of the aging/fading process."
rawdenim,3bp93n,rundfunk90,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:57:14 2015 UTC,"Not actually copper, it's copper colored yarn iirc"
rawdenim,3bp93n,todayismyluckyday,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:59:00 2015 UTC,I carry a copper pen and flashlight with me. Seeing as they have constant contact with other things they will never really darken like pennies or go green like those rooftops. It will probably look more like clean copper and get shiny because it's a pretty soft metal.
rawdenim,3bp93n,59snomeld,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:10:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that captures it much better! You definitely can't accurately reproduce the amount of sparkle with pics, it's EVERYWHERE."

rawdenim,3bn3x8,backb0n3,2,Tue Jun 30 16:07:39 2015 UTC,I had to give away my contest pair for that exact reason.

Some things just aren't meant to be :(   /u/hiccamer 's fit is sick though. So jelly bud.

rawdenim,3bn3x8,tarmonster,3,Tue Jun 30 16:18:14 2015 UTC,I've decided that I need to start asking questions that I used to think were obvious:  How did you get those fades? Did you just put your phone and wallet in the same spot every day for 8 months? Did you put your phone in your pocket and then rub around that area to wear it down? Did you do some kind of ocean soak?  What kinds of every day activities do you think contribute to these fades? Do you ride a bike a lot?
rawdenim,3bn3x8,shaw_j,3,Tue Jun 30 17:49:23 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what I have found when living a borderline sedentary lifestyle if that the indigo lifts mostly from areas of high tension or pressure, so if you've got tight-fitting jeans putting an object in there like a waller or phone is going to produce those high-contrast outlines. Also, if you haven't bough in yet make sure you like your jeans fit. Because should you not you'll hate them by the time you are due for a first wash."
rawdenim,3bn3x8,RoamingPotato,2,Tue Jun 30 23:05:11 2015 UTC,"I didn't really do anything special other than wear them everyday for the last eight monhts. I use the same pocket for the same thing everyday - mostly out of habit - and am out and about quite a bit, so the pockets are in use. Things like phone and wallet kind of find a place in the pocket and gravitate to the same spot. I am in NYC and ride my bike when the weather is nice. This cut is particularly tight, which seems to contributes to the pockets fading, my MIJs did not get such distinct fades in the pocket areas. As far as water: They were a little tight initially, so I wore them for a month before the initial cold soak; then I hand washed them about four or five months in; finally machine washed on Saturday (delicate, cold)."

rawdenim,3bny20,Maasharu,5,Tue Jun 30 22:23:15 2015 UTC,"Naked and Famous Copper Twist  Weight: 13oz  The feel of these were surprisingly soft.  They feel much lighter and softer than other 13oz denim that I own.  I think even softer than Uniqlo raws.  I picked these up from Barneys NY website sale this weekend.  They were on sale for a low low price of $69.99.  I was already familiar with the Weirdguy fit, so I snatched them up confidently.    To my dismay, last night I read a comment about how these particular jeans might ""sparkle"" or look like there was glitter sprinkled on them.  It mentioned that the website photos don't pick up the glitter in their samples and that it looks pretty ridiculous.  Welp, received the package today and I was almost blinded by the bling coming off these jeans.  There is no way in hell anyone could miss this and even at night, it would be pretty obvious.  I'm sending them back but though I'd post pics just in case any of you came across a deal on these, you'd have some sort of reference to go on.  Funny thing about taking pics of these jeans is that when the camera is in focus, they don't glitter.  I had to intentionally let the lens go out of focus to pick up the sparkle.  Go figure..."

I'm happy with my decision."
rawdenim,3bnydd,iammyusername,2,Tue Jun 30 21:01:48 2015 UTC,Speaking as another guy with big thighs I got some of the BOM008s and while they are beautiful the thighs and rise are just too tight for me.  I might go for these high tapereds though.
rawdenim,3bnydd,Xianricca,2,Tue Jun 30 23:02:48 2015 UTC,Yeah these definitely will have a bit more room. I was nervous the 008 wouldn't work.
rawdenim,3bnydd,hipstermike,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:32:49 2015 UTC,I think I'm going to get these as well. Thanks for the update. I am newer to heavier denim as most of my raws are 11-14oz. Do you recommend an initial soak?
rawdenim,3bnydd,Willy156,2,Wed Jul 1 01:32:17 2015 UTC,I'm wearing these exact pants as I type this. Picked them up on the weekend.   They were pretty stiff and I did about a 60 minute soak. Loving them so far!
rawdenim,3bnydd,babyhands1,2,Wed Jul 1 04:53:28 2015 UTC,Yes I soaked immediately. They didn't shrink a whole bunch but they were stiff. I'll be hemming them so I wanted to get any shrink out before the hem.
rawdenim,3bnydd,RickFlairWOOOO,2,Wed Jul 1 18:33:49 2015 UTC,These sound like they'd be perfect for me. We're the same height and weight. I only wish they didn't release at the beginning of summer. I can't spend the money of them and let them sit until fall. Bummer. Thanks for the photos though.
rawdenim,3bnydd,Willy156,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:30:02 2015 UTC,"really cool fit, I like these."
rawdenim,3bpem0,Alexander_Search,6,Wed Jul 1 02:14:44 2015 UTC,cuffs do look sloppy but I think you can solve that by putting boots on or hemming them.
rawdenim,3bpem0,thoughtrecord,2,Wed Jul 1 02:21:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. Getting crisp cuffs is tough on this pair, the denim is just not rigid enough to hold folds. Thanks for your feedback!"
rawdenim,3bpem0,ninthway,4,Wed Jul 1 02:24:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of the straight fit and I think these look great. As noted by /u/thoughtrecord, the cuffwork could be neater. An iron can probably fix that but I'm guessing it isn't as much an issue when you're actually wearing shoes (pro-tip for next time you post fit pics: wear shoes).  Looks you're filling out the thigh area so I don't think a more tapered cut would necessarily suit you but if you decide otherwise, consider the IH-633s (exclusive to Self Edge) which are supposedly pretty close to the IH-634s in the topblock but with a taper below the knee."
rawdenim,3bpem0,ninthway,5,Wed Jul 1 02:31:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I have only recently been considering a tapered fit, but come to think of it I'm not really willing to trade off comfort and range of motion for a smaller leg opening. Your response is appreciated!
