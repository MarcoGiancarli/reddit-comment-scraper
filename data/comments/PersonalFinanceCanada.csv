PersonalFinanceCanada,3e3k99,TangoZippo,4,Tue Jul 21 22:49:33 2015 UTC,"It's pretty concerning for all Canadians not just the Ontario residents.   Ontario's debt has more then doubled under the current government.   Their p3 way of infrastructure will not help out long term at all.   I doubt any politician will ever take on reducing the debt (seriously). Hell our politicians have a hard time not running a deficit when the economy is good.   I think as a country we need to make sure our debt stays manageable.  I think we will die before it all comes crashing down, and it will be left to the next generation to deal with."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3e3k99,drcujo,3,Tue Jul 21 21:14:39 2015 UTC,"What are the implications of this kind of debt load for the average Ontario resident?   Right now? Not a whole lot. Long term? If the province continues running deficits and fails to meet their goal of a balanced budget in the next couple years, then the debt will continue to balloon and eventually we could see a situation similar (albeit on a different scale) to Greece. Solution to this (at least according to the ECB and IMF) is harsh austerity measures - severe cuts to government spending. However there is the matter of Ontario being a sub-sovereign borrower and that there exist checks and balances to prevent provinces from sinking too far into the red (see: transfer payments).   Honestly, it's a big what if scenario - too many variables to control for. Cutting spending and raising taxes are what is available to the province - but neither of these are attractive to many people. Our per capita spending is amongst the lowest of the provinces, and our tax burden is relatively low (especially compared to Quebec, whom we are often compared to). We do need to balance the provincial budget soon, but borrowing costs are dirt cheap right now, so it's not a huge deal - yet!"

This follows closely on the heels of his cheery response to S&P's recent downgrade of Ontario's debt.  In completely unrelated news, the Wynne government announced that as a signing bonus on the most recent round of collective agreements, OPSEU members would be receiving a pony. Premier Wynne explained that the province could afford to give its unionized civil servants a pony because it had partnered with several P3 entities who had figured out how to make taxpayers pay for the ponies shortly after the 2032 elections.   EDIT: for those who think I'm being unfair to poor Charles Sousa, read some of the comments he made about S&Ps downgrade as reported here. My favourite was that he pointed out that ""S&P rates Ontario's debt as A+"", which is no doubt designed to make the uninitiated feel like Ontario's doing just fine.

That said, a lot of the recent activity seems to be related to two areas:  i) the expectation that U.S. interest rates will rise (due to an improving economy) while Canadian interest rates will not (due to an oncoming recession).  ii) the Canadian dollar is also closely tied to the price movements of resources - oil, gas, gold, etc, all of which have been falling in price.  The combination of less demand for Canadian dollars due to relatively lower interest rates + improving U.S. economy + less demand due to lower prices for resources = lower CAD/USD rate."

The way I see it is: the rate fully out of my control.

PersonalFinanceCanada,3e2inq,externalseptember,6,Tue Jul 21 21:46:35 2015 UTC,"OP, your starting premise is wrong. There is nothing to say a Canadian dollar and a US dollar should be at parity. The actual numbers are completely irrelevant - eg, compare with the Japanese Yen. Why is a CAD worth 100 (or whatever) Yen?! Because that's just how the value of the currencies has changed over the years, there's nothing magic about 1:1  To answer why CAD is now MUCH weaker than it has been for the last few years (and it is only a few, not a decade), against a load of currencies, the answer lies in what Canada produces - mainly raw materials. Commodity prices cycle round, and they are lower now than lately, that's all. Oil is now WAY below the cost of production of most/many tar sands extraction companies, China's gold buying is less than previously thought, and lumber demand is down.  Manufacturing (in Ontario & Quebec) hasn't picked up as much as hoped (guess what, it takes years for companies to transition from one country to another - a 10-20% currency decline won't reverse the trend overnight, if at all).  Look back a couple of decades to see CAD:USD movement."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3e2inq,SoroSuub1,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:31:05 2015 UTC,"The other issue facing Ontario is high labour costs and expectations (how else do workers buy inflated housing) and high operating costs from electricity.

Yes oil is selling off but what most people might not have noticed is that gold, copper, potash, aluminum, etc are also hitting fresh lows. This is obviously bad for our economy which is heavy on commodity exports. Due partly to the above reason, GDP growth for the first 4 months of the year have been negative and there is a lot of talk that Canada may already be in a ""technical recession"" (6 consecutive months of negative GDP growth)  The BOC (canadian central bank) also just cut borrowing rates while the Fed (American central bank) is expected to raise rates this fall. Cutting interest rates generally devalues currency because it causes inflation. The fact that the BOC even felt they needed to cut rates indicates that our economy isn't in the best shape."

(Ex: I am with 3 different banks: my chequings account with scotia [low service fees] my savings with CIBC [they currently have a promotion going on for 2%] and my credit card with TD [taking into account my monthly spending habits TD offers me the best rewards] and am also planning on opening a chequings account with TD in order to take advantage of their current promotion of a free samsung tablet, best part is that you only have to have the account open for about 3 months (10-12 weeks) while they ship you the product and do 2/3 things from a list to eligible + the monthly fee on the account is waived if you have 4k-5k in there depending on the chequings account you plan on opening).  P.S. Happy cake day!"
PersonalFinanceCanada,3e58vj,stratys3,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:56:22 2015 UTC,"I'm happy with BMO. With 5k in a chequing account, you get a rebate on the premium plan ($30/month). This includes things like cheques, and also them waiving credit card annual fees. BMO also lets me have up to 20 additional accounts at no extra charge (might be useful if you run a business, or if you like to keep various savings separated)."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3e58vj,babadouba,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:58:55 2015 UTC,Tangerine. They are offering >2% for regular savings. But then you might also want to keep an account with another bank that actually issues master/credit cards etc.

PersonalFinanceCanada,3e581q,alphs,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:25:14 2015 UTC,"One way I am thinking about it is with respect to the Canadian economy right now, especially with the banks getting a nice break on the interest rate and pocketing the difference, the VDY fund may be more attractive since its holdings are mainly banks. I don't know if my thinking is sound or matters in the medium to long term."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3e3hed,newtestaccount12,4,Tue Jul 21 17:49:46 2015 UTC,Don't fixate on your credit score as it will naturally fluctuate. Focus on not keeping a balance of any high interest debt and if absolutely necessary keeping your payments on time.   If you can pay off the entire credit card balance then you should do so immediately.
PersonalFinanceCanada,3e3hed,ichiban70,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:01:36 2015 UTC,"The balance has not been posted, I am asking if paying some of it early so when it posts I get a 300 or 200 dollar bill to report to my credit agency help more then the 800 one that would.  Does high utilization stay on your record for a period of time or is it only during that one month."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3e3hed,pfc-toss,3,Tue Jul 21 18:43:21 2015 UTC,"A one-time high utilisation will likely fall off after the next reporting. That said, if you pay if off now before it reports it won't have any impact.  But as /u/ichiban70 says, unless you intend to actually make use of your credit in the next couple of months, a high utilisation report will have no impact and likely would not bump you down significantly enough to change your loan qualifications unless you were already on poor credit ground."

PersonalFinanceCanada,3e3hed,shar_blue,3,Tue Jul 21 20:48:41 2015 UTC,"You get the full amount of cashback regardless of the balance that gets reported on your statement date - the credit monitoring agencies are not the ones providing you with the cashback incentive, it's the bank that does so.  There is absolutely no reason to not pay the card off.  The only time cashback amounts get clawed back is if you return something.  At the end of your statement period, the your bank will add up the total amount that was charged to your card during the last statement period, less any merchant refunds you got, and that is the amount you will get cashback credits for.    Also, the utilization ratio is calculated based on the balance that was reported on your monthly statement, it's not a day-to-day running number."

PersonalFinanceCanada,3e479q,iwantyoutothrowthis,4,Tue Jul 21 20:46:26 2015 UTC,"It's always a good idea to learn more about investing so you don't get fooled into paying tons of hidden fees, like you are right now. An ""MER"", or Management Expense Ratio, is a percentage of the fund's value that is lost to paying for things like marketing, fund manager's salary, and commissions to salespeople (like the one you talked to). Index funds don't have a fund manager, they just use a computer to buy & sell stocks according to an index (like the S&P 500). They are also structured to reduce costs as much as possible. TD offers the lowest MERs in Canada for index mutual funds, but you need a special kind of account for that, called e-Series. If you already have a mutual fund account, you can convert it to e-Series using this form. Your post was rather unclear as to whether your existing mutual fund account is registered as an RRSP, TFSA, or not registered at all (where you pay taxes on your gains). You should definitely have it be registered, provided you have the contribution room for your RRSP or TFSA. Which one is best for you is going to depend on various factors, but mainly what your current income is and how much income you plan to withdraw during retirement. So, depending what account you have now and what you want to get, you might need to open a new mutual fund account. You should be able to do this over the phone since you already have a TD account. You can do it in person, but they won't let you get e-Series that way, you'd have to open a regular TFSA mutual fund account and then use the form to convert it to eSeries after.  Once you've got access to the e-Series funds, sell your Canadian Core Plus Bond and buy some of each of the 4 index funds (Canadian bond, Canadian equity, US equity, International equity) according to some target allocation of your choosing. My recommendation is to take 120 minus your age, and use that number to set a target for total equity (the rest in bonds). Then divide up the equity portion as 10% Canadian, 40% US, and 50% international.  Initially, buy the funds according to your targets. As time goes by, some will perform better than others (I'd expect equity to typically outperform bonds, but it's also much riskier so having some bonds is important). They'll get away from their targets, but don't worry... you'll be adding new contributions too (hopefully) and you can just add to the ones that have fallen behind. If something gets way behind or ahead, sell some of the over-target ones to buy the under-target ones. This is a very simplistic explanation of rebalancing your portfolio... you can probably find many more posts here about that topic or try a google search."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3e479q,elbyron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:45:54 2015 UTC,"My mutual fund RRSP only has about 6k in it, however I'm looking at making larger contributions this and next year (about 10k this year and 10k the following).  I understand that there is a $100 fee if you have less than 25k invested, so I am planning on waiting until I am able to bring it above 25k next year until switching to e-series.  My TFSA is maxed out.  I am looking at converting the TFSA to the e-series right away.  In case you are wondering why I have so little in RSP and so much in TFSA - I am keeping the funds available in case I opt to purchase a house.  I am not a first time home buyer however, so I can't withdraw from the RSP for this."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3e479q,elbyron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:39:50 2015 UTC,"The $25K minimum only applies to RRSP accounts held with TD Direct Investing (formerly TD Waterhouse). If that's where your account is held, then you already have access to the e-Series funds through the WebBroker online interface. If your account is with TD Canada Trust, there are no minimums, but the account needs to be converted to e-series before you can buy them. They use a different interface (EasyWeb) which is simpler than WebBroker, but the steps to buy & sell are about the same for both.     To save for a house, the TFSA is definitly a better option, but if you think you might be buying in less than 5 years, you might not want to be buying mutual funds at all with that money. The problem is that the equity funds tend to swing up and down, and can at any time suffer a big market crash. It always recovers again, but if it happens to crash just as you go to withdraw to buy the house, you could be out a lot of money. So for shorter term savings, just use a high-interest TFSA savings account. Tangerine's isn't bad, with a regular rate of 1.05% (and sometimes temporary promotional rates), but the best TFSA savings you can get is with People's Trust, who offers a 2.25% interest rate."

The question is more how to split between RRSP and TFSA. You'll want to keep your 7K in an RRSP account (to avoid the tax of withdrawing it), but whether you want to add more or not is something you need to figure out (i.e. how to split between TFSA and RRSP).  Once you max your TFSA and RRSP accounts, then you can look at putting something tax efficient in a non-registered account (e.g. dividend paying Canadian equities or swap based ETFs)."

Take the whole of the money you would like to invest and stick it in your TFSA. TFSA is the better choice out of the two because you have the option of withdrawing the money b4 retirement if you need it.  Invest in :  TD-Eseries Index funds- 1/3 International Index 1/3 US Index 1/3 Canadian Index  TD mutual funds are the best because you can make automatic monthly contributions if you wish(To grow your investment) and they have some of the lowest management rates in canada.  Balance them once a year and you should expect a 5-7% return for the rest of your life. (Down the road close to retirement consider bonds but you've got tons of time so why not get better returns in the meantime)  GLHF! props to Shar. This strategy was pulled from CCP.

We've elected to keep the landing pages pretty bare-bones for now as we're still determining what belongs there. We're currently gathering information and will be making changes in the near future.  In terms of the information that will be displayed, the best way to learn would be to wait for the Beta to open and try it out - the survey hints as to the sorts of things we will display. The robustness of the site has more to do with its 'sturdiness', although security is something we take seriously as well. We find personal spreadsheets to be fragile (you can delete/lose information accidentally) and we wanted to design something a little more permanent.

You state you don't have much debt, but you have whatever is outstanding on your car loan ($500/month sounds like the loan was in the $30K range) and credit card debt. The CC debt being the big issue.

PersonalFinanceCanada,3e35f7,tsailfc,5,Tue Jul 21 16:28:47 2015 UTC,"TL:DR - Don't worry about your score!  So you have a ""good"" score, so if you apply for an unsecured line of credit, you should get a decent interest rate (for that type of loan). So what if it dips a bit? That is what you need the score for is to get a better interest rate. After a few months it should be back to where it was (assuming continued prudent use of credit).   In Canada, the numbers don't matter just the category. What matters more is missed payments & non payments. The ""number"" doesn't mean much.   And the whole point of having good credit is to get access to lower interest rates for loans. So if you don't need to borrow money, then why do you even worry about the score?"
PersonalFinanceCanada,3e35f7,Faustius,3,Tue Jul 21 17:05:59 2015 UTC,"Minimum payments don't strengthen your score. A consistent payment history does. Minimum or all, it doesn't matter.

A good accountant will save you more than the difference in cost between a good accountant and a bad one, plus no matter how cheap a bad accountant is, I'm certain you can't afford it when they do a bad job :/"
PersonalFinanceCanada,3e32jt,err4nt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:53 2015 UTC,"I can't get you through the entire process but the first step would be to compile all the information you have on you income, tax deductible expenses and so on back to when you last filed your taxes.  At that point seeing as you're looking at a $40k bill to CRA I'd probably consult an accountant that deals specifically with your situation (business & personal income tax) and get them to file for you.  It's going to be costly but having all this information compiled before you go see them is going to save you that money in the long run."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3e32jt,1enigma1,0,Tue Jul 21 16:38:43 2015 UTC,"Again, I'm pretty confident they are garnishing because they feel I haven't filed as self employed over the past 3 years.

PersonalFinanceCanada,3e32jt,1enigma1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:56 2015 UTC,"I suspect the way you're using the term garnishing is different than the way most here would us it.  Typically it means the government (or some other entity) that you owe money to is garnishing your wage to pay off a pre-existing debt.  In your case this would be the $40k the CRA is apparently stating you owe.  However, the way you are using the term I believe is in reference to the company you are working for is just deducting the calculated amount of taxes and other required deductions from your regular salary.  At the end of the year when you would file your taxes the you would then determine if you owed or were owed money.

PersonalFinanceCanada,3e06zf,DontFlex,25,Mon Jul 20 23:10:22 2015 UTC,"I think what you're trying to say that if your wife receives income it will impact her EI benefits while on maternity leave? The short answer is the company will pay the severance regardless of whether you want to receive it or not.  In my case, it was direct deposit as my regular paycheque was. Severance pay is taxed at different rates depending on the amount. Over $15K it's 30% at the source. In other words, you'll get $10500 for $15000 severance. At tax time your EI benefits might be clawed back because of this income. Remember, you still ended up with more money.  You can, at the time of termination, decided to transfer an amount to your wife's RRSP. If your wife has contribution room, you can make this transfer without the withholding tax. This is one way to prevent paying the tax at the source but you will still need to account for all of that income at tax time."

(These are just ramblings, but examples of options I was hoping for!!)"
PersonalFinanceCanada,3e06zf,Palestrina,2,Tue Jul 21 16:09:15 2015 UTC,"One option is to have them pay it directly into an RRSP. That way, the income is still included at year-end (for EI purposes), but is offset by an RRSP deduction."

PersonalFinanceCanada,3e06zf,Styrak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:06 2015 UTC,"The amount of the severance deposited directly into an RRSP is deducted from her taxable income.   For EI repayment purposes, it is still counted as income, but you get an offsetting tax deduction.   Example with numbers:   Your wife receives $10,000 in severance pay.   $10,000 is deducted from her EI maternity leave pay.   She arranges to have the $10,000 contributed directly to her RRSP.   The $10,000 is deducted from her taxable income in the year.   Assuming a 34% tax bracket, she receives a refund of ($10,000*34% = $3,400).   Thus the amount she has to repay to EI is reduced by $3,400.   This isn't a perfect solution (in that it does not allow her to keep all of the $10,000 with no mat leave benefits repayment) but it may be the best available."

PersonalFinanceCanada,3dzcis,caughtinthought,26,Mon Jul 20 19:29:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think the developed world is going into a long period of iffy growth, due to the retirement of the Boomers. As they go from doing productive work into drawing down their assets, the economy is going to be producing less, and there's going to be constant downward pressure on asset prices. This isn't unique to Canada, of course.   Canada-specifically, oil isn't quite as important as we make it out to be, but it's a big deal. I suspect prices will recover, which will be good for AB and the TSX, but bad for ON/QC. I think other commodity prices(less obvious than oil, but on the whole a bigger part of our economy) will not recover so well, though - most of them don't have the same problem of the good deposits running low, and they were much more buoyed by the rise of China than oil was. China's largely stopped rising at this point, and it's frankly going to get the crap kicked out of it by the one-child policy going forward. That said, our banks and utilities will be making money until at least eight years past the heat death of the universe, so that sector should be strong at least, and that's like half the TSX.   So in sum, a bit of money in Canada should be fine, but don't be banking on 9% annualized."

PersonalFinanceCanada,3dzcis,Alsadius,4,Mon Jul 20 22:55:26 2015 UTC,"Oil demand will only drop when either a) prices spike, or b) alternatives become superior on their merits, not counting pollution. (a) is not compatible with a price drop, and (b) is a lot further away than most people think. Yes, yes, electric cars. There's not enough lithium on the planet to produce that many batteries, nor is there half of enough power plants to keep them running. And they're clearly inferior for certain tasks - even if electric commuter cars become popular, electric transport trucks are a lot further away(and diesel fuel usage grows far faster than gasoline - gas usage has been basically flat for decades, diesel just keeps going up and up).   Given that supply is getting harder to find, if demand goes up, prices will go up."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3dzcis,stevey_frac,5,Mon Jul 20 23:14:10 2015 UTC,"Also, as the pressure from electric vehicles mounts, fossil fuel-based transportation will likely get cheaper and cheaper as the technology is pushed to new limits.

It gets worse when you realize that lithium out of south america is so cheap that people have literally stopped looking for more,  because there is no point...  Furthermore,  we have every indication of a wealth of second gen electric cars coming out very shortly that will have massive range increases and much much faster charging,  making them a lot more compelling.  These are cars like the Chevy Bolt,  200 mile range,  the new Nissan Leaf with a 250 mile range, and the Model 3 with a 200+ mile range.  Plus,  once people start driving EV's,  most swear they'll never go back.  They're just such better vehicles in nearly every respect.  Expect a veritable explosion of electric vehicles on the roads in the next 4 years.  And finally,  EV's charge at night when power plants are typically idling down to night time lows.

Fair point about discovery, though, particularly if it is that cheap(my impression was that it wasn't, but I'm no expert on lithium prices).

The rest of the world isn't doing much of it, so their prices aren't dropping - they're actually going up pretty fast in Japan, ever since they shut down their nukes, and Europe is largely flat.

Harper put lots of eggs into the O&G basket: Canada was going to buy lots of influence with our oil money!  Which - anybody from Alberta ought to know - is a strategy that's going to regularly have some very bad days.  That wasn't good economic management."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3dzcis,blingdomepiece,3,Mon Jul 20 23:34:44 2015 UTC,"Governments can't really do much to improve the economy, at least not once you have roads and schools and the rule of law.

If I was going to talk about him breaking things, I might mention the orgy of corporate welfare that was our stimulus package - though again, the Liberals wanted to take down his government for not doing it, so they can't criticize."

He's too smart to play with that particular kind of fire.  Which basket? You mean oil? Our geography did that for us, Harper had very little to do with it. If you mean low interest rates you might be on slightly firmer ground, but all the other parties would have done the same there, so I can't count that against him.  Education is provincial, and so's a good chunk of science, so his ability to do damage, even in principle, is limited. His message control attempts have been a bit ham-fisted, certainly, but democratic control of the bureaucracy is supposed to be a part of our system, so I can hardly fault him for following through on that.  Yup, environmentalism is on the back burner. Given that this is ostensibly a discussion of Canada's economic outlook, that counts as a positive for him.  Which policies have cratered the economy? Balancing the budget, finally?"
PersonalFinanceCanada,3dzcis,Alsadius,8,Mon Jul 20 23:41:59 2015 UTC,"A budget he unbalanced to begin with.  Also this year's ""balanced budget"" was based on accounting magic and one-time revenue and the cut to GDP means we are already back in deficit, it just hasn't been announced yet."

He should have let Dion take over, watched the coalition implode, and rode back in with massive public support to keep the budget balanced instead of using obnoxious and questionably-constitutional tricks to let him be the one who was wasting money on some stupid stimulus. I basically quit the party over that."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3dzcis,wantpixies,18,Tue Jul 21 00:10:52 2015 UTC,"Bill C-51 and C-24 are SERIOUS social regression.  These are the tools of a police state, not a democracy.  Police actions at the G20 were SERIOUS social regression.  Mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug crimes are social regression.  Anti-environmentalism and muzzling of scientists both count as social regression in my books. Oil is not our only industry.  Canada is bursting with smart, talented, hard working young people who could benefit from some subsidies.  We also have MASSIVE renewable resources due to our geography - solar, wind, geothermal - we should be investing HEAVILY in these.  Canada could be an alternative energy leader, easily.  Harper has used subsidies to entrench the oil industry and make the downturn in prices all the worse for those living in oil-dependent areas. By the science & education, I was referring to the ongoing muzzling of scientists. The environment is fucking IMPORTANT.  I don't understand how you cons don't get this:  Without a clean environment, we don't survive.  Period.  Full stop.  Our lakes and rivers are at risk, and so are many species that rely on our stewardship. Yes, interest rates and oil are the big policies that have put our economy at risk.  This allowed a huge real estate bubble to grow in an area that was basically supported by a single industry.  Now that that industry is in a downturn, things out west are going to get ugly."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3dzcis,Alsadius,5,Tue Jul 21 00:41:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed. An economic policy that doesn't account for the maintenance of the ultimate infrastructure, ie. The Environment, is a flawed economic policy."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3dzcis,onpar_22,3,Tue Jul 21 02:09:04 2015 UTC,"C-51 is like most anti-terror laws. It's an overreach that gives police powers they probably shouldn't have, but that won't get used much, that gets ragged on by a bunch of people who are far too worried about worst-case outcomes to realize that they were pretty much all possible already without any new laws passed. It's just like Chretien's 2001 anti-terror bill, or any of the other ones passed internationally, in that regard.   C-24 seems to be mostly symbolic. Stripping citizenship for treason and the like doesn't bother me at all.   Canada's geography is actually kind of crap for alternative energy. We're far too polar for solar to make sense, and we have a lot less geothermal than you'd think from our landmass. Wind, meh, we're about the same as anywhere else. Our real renewable energy bounty is hydroelectric...which is, of course, why environmentalists were all lining up to rag on BC's latest dam. That said, if you're right about oil subsidies, I'll of course be opposed(and I know a few folks who work for big think-tanks that'd love an excuse to rag on Harper for wasting money), so I'd love to see any links on that topic.   I'm all for a clean and safe environment, which is why I'm so sad that ""environmentalists"" seem to spend so much of their time being stupid. Sane support for the environment should revolve around carbon-free power sources like hydro and nuclear. Fracking is a good second-best. Wind and solar are about #267 on the list.   Your original comment was a hope that Harper doesn't win, which in the current political climate implies a hope that Trudeau or Mulcair does. Which of those two would have been better about keeping interest rates high in an economic downturn? Christ, they're both more Keynesian than Harper is, they'd happily appoint a printing press to run the Bank of Canada. I'll agree that they'd probably both be less pro-oil than Harper, but how does that help the economy?"

For example, commercial aviation and chemical plants will still use oil long after it stops being practical for automotive use - there's simply no other suitable fuels for either.

Over my lifetime I feel like I have witnessed the death of the american dream—most americans my age I know feel resigned to being low-wage labourers and aren't strong in any career path yet.  Don't worry, I'm sure the next generation of competent, highly-skilled workers will dig us out of this hole… oh wait, American millennials are the most-educated group of people from any country on the earth and the least capable of producing value for the economy when compared to their global peers (even from the 3rd world).  http://www.ets.org/s/research/30079/index.html  Does it get worse? Head over to the last page of that report, the Implications:   “First, the data reveal that in relative terms, our millennials do not perform favorably in comparison to their peers internationally. This holds true even for our best performing and most educated millennials, those who are our native born, and those with the greatest socioeconomic advantage. In addition to the relative poor performance of U.S. adults (both for adults overall and millennials), there has been an absolute decline of skills. A decade ago, the skill level of American adults was judged ""mediocre.""76 Now it is below even that. Millennials, who will form the backbone of this nation's future, are not poised to lift us out of this predicament; in fact, the lack of adequate skills in this population has become a challenge for us to confront.”   and later…   “As a country, we need to address the question of whether we can afford (in both a moral and fiscal sense) to write off nearly half of our younger-adult population as not having the skills needed to effectively engage as full and active participants in their own future and that of our nation. We need to ask whether nations such as ours—on the one hand affluent and on the other plagued by high levels of inequality—are perhaps what Wilkinson and Pickett have labeled ""social failures.""84 We have clearly not adapted nimbly to the challenges we face. Doing so now will require us to focus on policy changes; even more fundamentally, it will involve a renewed social commitment to alter our course.”   So you tell me how the long-term forecast looks for a nation of indebted, unskilled labourers who don't have the capacity to ever fully develop as fully functioning adults in society.

If your goal is to have [say] 20K for a kid you have to put away $99/mo for 17 years (not including interest earned).  That's 1200/yr so if you're putting away 2500/yr (commendable) you will hit your goal in 8 years.

PersonalFinanceCanada,3e1750,twinetwing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:35:38 2015 UTC,"You do have to provide proof of enrollment each time you want to withdraw. Just to clarify the above limits, the Educational Assistance Payments are comprised of the grant and growth only, not the contributions. So, if you need to take out more than the $5,000 limit during the first semester, you certainly can, but it will come out of the contributions. Also, I always recommend depleting the grant and growth first, that way, if your kid stops going to school or one of the younger beneficiaries decides not to go, you can take out the remaining assets, which will consist of only contributions, and you won't have to worry about sending the grant money back to the government."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3e1750,rationalphi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:54:52 2015 UTC,"It might be worth spreading withdrawls out over a few years while they're in school, as growth is taxed in the hands of the student. Taking everything out in one year, especially if they get a job right after schooling, would potentially cost them more in taxes."

PersonalFinanceCanada,3e2hud,Denelectro,8,Tue Jul 21 13:26:27 2015 UTC,"Tangerine is really the easiest way to go and is a good choice for beginner investors. The MER is 1.07% and worth it if you don't want the hassle of rebalancing your portfolio.  The $50k recommendation assumes that you are paying commissions to buy ETFs. If you use a brokerage like Questrade, ETF purchases are close to free (only 0.0035/share with no minimum), so you can jump into ETFs with a lot less. Typical MER for an ETF CCP portfolio is 0.2-0.3%. I started with Tangerine but quickly realized I could handle ETFs and switched.  That being said, you should have another look at TD e-Series. MERs are about half of Tangerine's, no fees to buy/sell, and you can easily automate your regular purchases. You will have to rebalance yourself but it's pretty easy to do."

XAW is 0.2%, and if you weight the other three the same as VXC does:  0.15 * (0.5) + 0.2 * (0.4) + 0.25 * (0.1) = 0.18%  Still, 0.02% of $50k is an extra $100/year in your pocket (ignoring compounding and future contributions). Not too shabby for a few minutes' extra work. I think you get more diverse holdings with XAW vs VXC (5000 vs 3000 stocks), but I don't know about this combination.

It's not as grotesquely overstaffed as in the US, but there's still more lawyers than law jobs, and pay isn't what it used to be. Honestly, I suspect that you'd wind up making about the same as you are now, unless you do much better than most law students(which probably requires taking a 70 hour a week job you hate, or being smarter than a bunch of very smart people).   Go talk to some lawyers in their 20s in your local area. Offer to buy them lunch, ask them if they'd do it over again, and how their law school friends are doing. It's three years of your life and a hundred grand, it's worth spending a couple bills on some lunches. If they say the same thing I do(and the lawyers I know mostly do), stay the hell away."

PersonalFinanceCanada,3dzeuc,Alsadius,6,Mon Jul 20 22:54:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with that. To get an honest appraisal of the profession, I'd suggest not talking to people at either end of the spectrum, i.e., not law students, articling students, or 1st or 2nd year calls, and not partners nearing retirement or those 80 year old sole practitioners you find at the mall. The former group tends to be uninformed (and they're not burnt out by having spent several Christmases in the office and away from their family), and the latter group tends to have a semi-nostalgic and rose-coloured view of the profession (and they've mentally come to terms with all those days they missed seeing their family grow up). Also, there is a fairly big gap between different types of practitioners. LSUC released a report about a month ago with statistics showing that public sector lawyers are by far the happiest, and sole practitioners are the least happy."

Partners, even young ones, ""did their time in the trenches"" before the 24/7 smartphone culture was such a big thing.   Anecdote time, my wife is a lawyer. When she got pregnant she was struggling with work/life balance, and talked with some youngish partners about when they were pregnant. They all said that they went home for dinner every night. HA! (although to be fair, the firm has been pretty awesome about it since the more senior partners in her group found out--telling her to go home at 6, not worry about billables, etc..)  The point is, the culture has changed a lot in the last 5 years or so. And compensation for associates (at least in Toronto big law) hasn't changed along with it. Partners don't necessarily realize this."

It's because being a lawyer usually means having a poor work life balance, so if you are grinding away at a job you hate it makes it that much worse.  As for the financial investment into an professional education such as law. I think it can be very worth it if you are smart, self driven and a hard worker. It's very much like an MBA, going through the motions and getting a designation doesn't provide you with much. Actually learning and building yourself into a good lawyer is what matters.    If you are good at what you do, you will be well compensated as a lawyer. The initial investment will be easily repaid.

PersonalFinanceCanada,3dzeuc,katkatkatkat,5,Tue Jul 21 01:06:05 2015 UTC,"My wife is a lawyer (2 year call) and I supported her financially through law school so I can maybe offer somewhat informed advice. Along with being expensive law school is emotionally exhausting and extremely stressful, and articling can often be worse. So just be sure it's what you really want to do (check out lawstudents.ca if you haven't already).  One thing to keep in mind is what law program you'd like to attend, as the tuition varies widely by school. U of T is a heck of a lot more expense than Windsor for the same degree. Depending on your undergrad GPA and LSAT score you might also be eligible for various entrance scholarships so research and apply for those as well.   If everything goes well and you graduate from law school into a paying articling gig and can convert that into a job, you probably won't have that difficult a time paying back your student debt. For every $1 you spend on tuition you accrue $2 in tax credits which you can claim as soon as you start working, so depending on your salary you can expect a return north of $20,000 in your first year post-graduation. With the tax credits and our combined salaries my wife and I were able to pay off $50,000 in student debt in 12 months. However, this is only because she worked over the summers, found a good articling position, and got hired back. Several of our friends had trouble finding work after graduation and owed over $100,000 which is a scary place to be.  So in our case law school was a sound investment that led to a positive return, but like any investment there's an element of risk (not finding a good law job). If you have a high LSAT and are generally an outgoing person who can network you should go for it. It's a rewarding career."

The profession is all about metrics. The time you spend doing literally everything during the day is tracked, down to the minute (or six minutes, depending on the firm). You life is all about meeting your billable hour targets (this is not the time you spend in the office). The partners also track: your time productivity, i.e., the fraction of hours you record for files but don't get billed out because you took too long and the client won't pay, your profitability (the type of work you bill), and how much work/how many clients you've brought in to the firm. Some associates do better quality work than others, but if the better ones can't meet their metrics, they're still dumped out the door. The only things that give you sticking power is meeting your targets and establishing relationships with clients you've brought in.  None of us want to be in the office 12 hours a day, except some people who thrive on this... we do it because we have to meet our billable targets (and also because clients always dump urgent last minute stuff on us)."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3dzeuc,dorkus_melorkus,4,Tue Jul 21 00:55:47 2015 UTC,"I'm a mid-level associate at one of the national firms in Toronto. Went to law school right out of undergrad.   Would I do it again? Yes, I would. I was pretty sure in high school I wanted to be a lawyer. Yes, I've always been as technical and disagreeable as I am on PFC. :p  And I could pass for a young Rumpole... which, if you've seen the series or read any of John Mortimer's books, isn't a good thing in many ways.    I had three viable options at the end of undergrad: lawyer, law professor, or another kind of professor. I wavered a bit at the end of undergrad toward other academia, but I talked to a few wise old professors who convinced me I was better suited for the legal profession. Notwithstanding all the problems in the profession and the unfortunate aspects of my life as a lawyer, I'm glad they did.  I agree with what has been said so far in this thread about the current state of the legal profession. Incomes are stagnant, at best. Our law schools are pumping out more graduates for fewer jobs every year. Most universities have turned law school into a cash cow for their less sustainable programs. I won't even get into the work/life balance issues in the profession - I've probably engaged in every unhealthy practice associated with private practice lawyers there is, short of using illegal substances.   I don't have a set answer for when people ask ""should I go to law school?"" Even in a bad job market there are some who should still go into law. I'm less concerned about your finances than I am about your personality, your aspirations, and your intellectual disposition. Those are the things that determine whether you should attend law school.   If you're making the decision based on the ""supposedly high ROI on a professional degree like law"" versus the debt risk... then no, you shouldn't go to law school. There are far better ROI options for most people than law school. Stick with what you're doing."

Just so you understand how bad you're getting screwed, TD Waterhouse (their investment branch) offers ""e-series"" mutual funds with MER's closer to 0.3 - 0.5%.

How is Aggression comfortable?   This subreddit is madly in love with low-MER investing, and at your current net worth your first priority should indeed be keeping costs low. I think Tangerine has good mutual funds, and of course TD has the e-series.

Personally I'm not up to speed on COS, but if you're interested in oil plays you're probably a lot better off in an Canadian oil-based ETF.

With regards to your other stocks, if you're ok with losing half of your downpayment to a market crash or if your timeline is flexible, then it may be ok to let it ride, but conventional advice is to have forthcoming expenses [like downpayments and tuition] with <5 year timelines in less volatile investments (i.e. outside of equities).

Right now, the oil price is smack dab in the middle of that range, and it looks like Iranian oil will soon be on the market, pushing the price down further.  This means COS' current slashed dividend is still unsustainable. The dividend will be cut to zero in all likelihood, which may trigger another major fall in COS' price.

Even if they cut them by half right now to $0.12 the dividend will still be 6.25% and XEG's is only 2%.

You shouldn't have this money in mutual funds at all. You should be in a savings account. The rest of my post applies to longer term (5 years+) investments.  --- Original Post Below --  The RBC Select Very Conservative Portfolio is a 'balanced' fund, meaning you're diversified through that one investment, albeit with a very high proportion of bonds and an MER of 1.69%. You could approximate it with RBC Index funds:   RBC Canadian Government Bond Index Fund (RBF563) - 70% RBC Canadian Index Fund  (RBF556) - 10% RBC U.S. Index Fund (RBF557) - 10% RBC International Index Currency Neutral Fund (RBF559) - 10%   Weighted MER - 0.68%  Using the index funds would save you 1% in fees and give you more flexibility if you want to change your allocation later. Alternatively, you could stay with the fund you have and consider the 1% the cost of RBC rebalancing the portfolio for you.  Or you could try something completely different and use one of the Canadian Couch Potato model portfolios (Conservative matches your distribution). For example, the Tangerine Balanced Income Portfolio is almost exactly the same as the RBC fund you have, but the MER is only 1.07%. Or you could try TD e-series index funds, which would give you an MER of 0.47%. Or Vanguard ETFs at an MER of 0.16%."

Once you've paid off your smallest debt, take that payment and add it to the minimum payment for your next smallest debt until it's paid off. Repeat until all debts are paid.   Depending on the size and makeup of your debts, you should find yourself paying off 1 debt every few months and not only giving yourself a psychological boost, but also a score boost as all your accounts will have on-time payments, but you'll be freeing up your utilization over time.

Also, as the mortgage is paid down, it opens up additional room on the HELOC so that the combined balances (mortgage remaining and available credit on HELOC = 80% of your property's value).    A HELOC is just like a LOC in that it is there, available for you, but you don't need to carry a balance.  If you do carry a balance, all you are obligated to pay is the interest each month.  It is different from a LOC in that it is secured, and thus, it will have a much lower interest rate than a LOC.    edit I missed the part about the mortgage almost being paid off.  In this case, his parents might want to look at converting that to a secured line of credit."

A secured LOC is a standalone product, but with collateral tied to it (ie. a home)...meaning if you withdraw funds, and fail to make your payments, the bank can take possession of the collateral instead.  A secured LOC will always have a more favorable interest rate (should be the same as you would get on a HELOC), as the bank has a means of recouping their losses if you max it out and walk away.    An unsecured LOC is not ""tied"" to anything, and will have a higher interest rate due to that.    Here is RBC's info on secured/unsecured LOC's"

PersonalFinanceCanada,3e0hfg,comfortable_in_cross,3,Tue Jul 21 00:47:07 2015 UTC,"Withholding tax isn't the issue. If you actually owe less than the 10% that was withheld, you'll get a refund come tax time. And if you owe more (probably not the case here), you end up paying the balance at tax time."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3e0hfg,BrrrHot,2,Tue Jul 21 13:07:50 2015 UTC,"If you take the cash, you'd also lose the RRSP room. This pension likely took some of your RRSP room. You'll never get this contribution room back.  Just something else to consider. There's no wrong answer. Any answer that allows your savings to grow is good enough considering the amount of debt we have.  TFSA is probably your best bet, though. Since you make very little, you'll likely get some of your withholding tax back when you file your tax return next year. Just make sure you take that amount (or more) and put it into your TFSA as well.  EDIT: Wanted to explain the withholding tax a bit. If you take cash, it will be considered income. That's why there is a withholding tax. This is similar to the payroll tax that automatically takes out the taxes, cpp, ei, etc. Any money you make this year, you'll need include the cash payout. Why? When the money was put into the pension, likely, it was being paid with before tax income. So no tax was deducted from this amount. This reduced your income. If you take the money out, you'll be taxed on this amount (at your marginal rate) as it's now considered income. As long as your income is low, then the amount of tax payable will be low or zero. If you somehow increase your income above a certain threshold (as a student, you probably don't need to worry about this too much), then you may owe more money. In Ontario, the amount payable is something like 20% up to $40,000. Don't remember the threshold. Something like $10,000? I don't know.

If so, then you are definitely making under 5% (probably not even keeping up with inflation), so getting rid of the debt would be putting your money to work a lot better than sitting in a savings account making nearly 0 interest (negative if you take inflation into account). That being said, right now is a prime time to be investing (prices have depressed somewhat with the BoC cut etc).  Personally I'd invest in ETFs with the TFSA money (probably will make you better than 5%) and if you are worried about the borrowing cost of the car loan, then pay it down quicker. Up your monthly payment a bit ($50, $100 or whatever you can afford per month)."

You haven't given a lot of details, but what I would recommend is the following:   Immediately get term insurance for your father for 5-10 years so that there will be a lump sum paid out to your mother if something happens before you can restructure everything to be more sustainable.  The amount will depend on the cost, her expenses, etc.  Term would probably be a lot more affordable. Explore other options your mother could use to finance her retirement if your father died:   Reverse mortgages Smaller house / apartment A part-time job Living with a family member  Consider options to reduce their expenses or increase their income NOW so that some money can be saved up for when/if your father dies.  A smaller house would be a good place to start.   I hope this helps!"

All these assume your father is 60, a non-smoker, and in ""standard"" health(which means not too bad for his age). If he's sicker than most or he smokes, they'll go up, perhaps substantially.   Assume the goal is a $20k/year top-up for 20 years, and that any life insurance proceeds would be put in fairly conservative investments that just match inflation.    $400k Term-10(i.e., it only pays if he dies in the next 10 years): $191.88 per month $400k Term-20: $406.08 per month $400k Whole Life(will pay at any age, and will grow over time): $1680.03 per month   And some compromises, for reference:    $200k Term-10, $200k Term-20: $326.70 per month $100k Whole Life, $300k Term-10: $577.89 per month   So yes, it's possible.

Case in point: I have an early 50s relative who did relatively well on her first home in Toronto, then suddenly decided to buy a bigger/more expensive house in Scarborough. Six months later she quits her job because she's tired of working. The thing is, her first house was easier to rent out because it had a separate unit for renters, and was much closer to downtown. Her new house, though bigger, can only be rented out in basically a rooming house arrangement and is pulling in only $350/mo from her current tenant. So she's got no job and her cash flow is worse than before. But her idea is that the house price is bigger so price increases every year will be bigger too."

Do you plan on making more money in 2016 or less? What is the chance of each?   Will your tax rate be different in 2016 vs 2015? If so you should choose whichever year is lower tax rate. That way you pay less tax on your severence.   If the witholding tax will be more than your income tax rate then maybe choose 2015 because then you can get the difference back sooner and invest it for a full year longer than if you choose 2016.  However you should verify everything for yourself, I am not an expert and never had to go through this."

PersonalFinanceCanada,3dywku,Blonde24,2,Mon Jul 20 17:37:12 2015 UTC,"I was exactly where you currently are a few years back.   Went on RAP for OSAP in late 2013 where the monthly interest was paid by the government and had no minimum monthly payment required. In my case though, I was just working a minimum wage job.   Literally a month after going on RAP, got a full-time job for not minimum wage.  I then proceeded to pay about $500 a month (which was a little more than what my minimum payment would have been if I wasn't on RAP) until my six-month RAP period ended.   They did not take me off the assistance plan for the six months. They did not increase my monthly minimum payment when I got off it. And all the money I did pay towards it during that time went straight to the principle. And they did not question where the money came from.   Granted, it wasn't much over the minimum payment ($30 or so dollars?). So I don't know if paying $1000 over the minimum would result in questions from OSAP. But in my case, I was not bothered.  And the reason I chose to put down $500 a month was because I knew upon getting my job that my days on RAP were likely numbered (In fact, I did reapply after the six months and was flatly rejected) but the size of the minimum payment is enough that I had to be pretty careful with my money nonetheless. So I did it in part to force me to have to get used to the fact that as of early 2014, I'd only be able to live on $XXXX-500 dollars a month. This way when it ended, the transition from not paying to paying didn't cause me any monetary disruptions.  With that said, lump sums are fine too. My sister was on RAP, got a well paid job part way through, but never made a payment until the near the end of RAP when she threw a decent sized lump sum onto the principle. Didn't change her minimum payments (if anything it might have lowered it) nor did they force her to pay more based on the lump sum."

If so i would just go ahead and pay it off in full.  If you just want to make payments I would say just wait till the assitance is over.  Dont spend the money you are wanting to use to make the payments.  Instead make a lump sum payment when your payments begin.  If osap is requiring you to pay say $100 a month and you decide you ant to pay $500 a month.  They wont require you to continute to do so if ou want to go back to the minimum paypent of $100

PersonalFinanceCanada,3dynqf,Sudapaw,3,Mon Jul 20 16:35:59 2015 UTC,"My current job situation is unstable.   Do not pay off your student loans.  Student loan payments can be deferred or delayed if you lose your job or have low income, and the government will pay interest on your behalf during that time.  I've had my student loans for almost 10 years, and I still haven't paid them off, and I haven't even considered it until very recently. Why? Let me give you some examples:  If you don't pay off your student loans, you can have larger savings. If there is an emergency, or you purchase something (eg a car), you can use that savings towards that. If you then lose your job, you can defer your student loans so that it is not a burden. Your main debt(s) are ""flexible"" in this situation (ie you don't have to pay if you can't pay).  If you DO pay off your student loans, and then have an emergency or you need to buy something (like a car), you will instead now have to go into debt to cover that cost. THEN if you lose your job... you will NOT be able to defer or delay those debts, nor will you qualify for any repayment assistance, you will be on the hook for interest, and you may potentially experience a significant destruction of your credit rating. Your main debt(s) in this case are not ""flexible"" and they will not have mercy on you and your credit rating.  Do not pay off the student loans until you have a stable career, and have enough savings/emergency fund such that if you paid of your student loans you would STILL have enough money left over in case of a significant long-term emergency.  Also note that interest paid on your student loan provides a tax credit. So if it is currently (for example) 5%, in reality you are only going to have to pay ~4% instead. Keep that in mind."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3dynqf,stratys3,2,Mon Jul 20 18:06:56 2015 UTC,Does interest accrue when you defer?
PersonalFinanceCanada,3dynqf,Minerva89,2,Mon Jul 20 18:12:02 2015 UTC,"No, the government pays the interest during that period."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3dynqf,stratys3,2,Mon Jul 20 18:15:39 2015 UTC,"How do you qualify? Under a certain annual income?   So your principal amount sits there interest free until when?  Sorry, tons of questions."

In my case - when I didn't have a job - the principle just sat there, with the government paying interest, until I got a job and could afford to make payments."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3dynqf,stratys3,2,Mon Jul 20 22:53:43 2015 UTC,"Actually, OP is required to report his finance and when they see that he has 14k saved up they will not approve deferred payment. In this situation, since OP does not pay cost of living he will be forced to pay for OSAP as long as he is not bankrupt.   My advice is to start paying rent to your parents and get receipts from them so that you can report a higher cost of living, this may affect future OSAP decisions."

PersonalFinanceCanada,3dynqf,karmainall,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:12:26 2015 UTC,I'm strictly speaking about deferred payments above. You can revise your RAP to a longer time with lower monthly payments without much trouble since you are basically asking to give them more money.

PersonalFinanceCanada,3dynqf,bunk_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:33:33 2015 UTC,Just a few thoughts.  Wouldn't being free of debt (regardless if its a small or modest sized student loan) be preferable to staying in debt for years.   From what I understand you'd have to remain unemployed or make a low amount to not have to pay the principle back in a given year.  How many years do you plan to be unemployed or earn a low amount?  Doesn't this suggest you'll not gain valuable work experience in these years?  Will you continue to live at home (for free) during this time?      I can guarantee you that you will absolutely have an emergency at some point in the future and that you will need to purchase a car. Thats life.  Why not just make an emergency fund like another poster said and put the rest to the Loan. You can then work your a$$ off to pay the remaining loan in a year or two. After that 100% of everything you earn is yours. You don't owe the man nothin!  All the best to you in what you decide to do :)
PersonalFinanceCanada,3dzj1u,nasalgoat,2,Mon Jul 20 20:15:43 2015 UTC,"My fiancee and I are doing this. We're keeping our individual accounts, which makes it easier, but we went with a third bank - I'm TD, she's CIBC, and we're getting a joint account at Tangerine. That way we can use over half the ATMs in the country for free(plus cross-border deals the various banks have at need), and we keep our current accounts and credit cards.   As for deals, they divide neatly into three categories. There's the big five, who are all basically interchangeable. There's various upstart credit unions and micro-banks, who try to give better deals on something or other to draw business, but aren't really that much different. And there's the web banks(PC and Tangerine, basically), who have the best promotions(usually), but don't have branches to visit if you want. Honestly, the micro-banks don't seem worth the annoyance of the small network to me, so your choice is between branches and free money. If you like branches, RBC is probably easiest due to sheer inertia. If you want free money, Tangerine seems superior to PC, and she'll get to keep using the same bank machines she always has."

In my experience, it's  much easier to budget and manage investments if you're doing it under one interface (instead of jumping between banks just to see what's happening on a day-to-day basis).  Also, depending on your overall banking picture your bank might be more lenient with interest rates for credit/lending products and service fees if you have all of your banking services with them.  After all, they don't want to lose your business to a competitor."

PersonalFinanceCanada,3dyfrb,zsaile,4,Mon Jul 20 15:39:12 2015 UTC,"This is just an opinion, but, your portfolio looks very complicated.  So the point of diversification is to smooth out the volatility with holding individual stocks, but there are limits. This graph helps explain this. Beyond about 8 to 10 stocks the change in volatility pretty much flattens out so there's not much point holding more than 10. And, helpfully enough, there's just about 10 main stock sectors.   So if you were to hold individual stocks, you'd want to limit yourself to 8 to 10 max, and each stock in a separate sector from one another. This is probably the best way to get diversification benefits.  With ETFs, if you buy all-market index type funds, you're already gaining diversification so you want to split them up geographically. There are lots of opinions on what the percentages are, so you can research that yourself and decide:  https://www.vanguardcanada.ca/individual/etfs/portfoliostrategies.htm  http://www.blackrock.com/ca/individual/en/learning-centre/ishares-core-model-portfolios  With regards to TFSA/RRSPs, I personally like prioritising Canadian stocks in a TFSA, and US/Intl' in an RSP."

A common 4 fund portfolio looks like this:     Canadian bonds   Canadian Index   US index   International Index     In a 3 fund portfolio, the last 2 are usually combined into a global index that excludes Canada, and usually a large portion of the global index will be US based."

In terms of your investment, you're using tangerine equity growth, which is the most volatile of the 4 options.  If you're comfortable with the amount of risk that this fund entails (biggest loss seen was -34% in a year (Source)), then by all means stick with it.  Index funds are meant to be held on to for longer periods of time, as the market usually generally always moves upwards over time.   Time is your best friend.  I'm in a similar situation as you, and I've decided to go with the balanced growth fund, as the possible losses aren't as high as the equity growth, with only a marginal difference in yield differences."

For equifax you would will out the form from the link on the top of this page http://www.consumer.equifax.ca/dispute-ca/dispute_process/en_ca (if you look under previous address it will say current employment, poor formatting on their part) and mail it to them also with 2 pieces of your government issued ID. Maybe include a small letter as well detailing you would like your employment info on there. Typically when you apply for a new credit product they will ask for your employment and this will be updated on the reports."

PersonalFinanceCanada,3duhcx,MeditatedMind,31,Sun Jul 19 16:27:31 2015 UTC,"A broker is an individual who brings together buyers and sellers of investments to facilitate the transaction.   Technically iTrade, Questrade etc. are all ""brokerages"" (not ""brokers""). Brokerages, or brokerage firms, employ brokers. However, the word ""broker"" (especially for ""discount broker"") is used interchangeably in Canada to mean both an individual securities broker, and a brokerage.   To complicate matters further, the term ""broker"" is not really used to refer to individuals working as investment brokers. Instead, in Canada, we have a mishmash of terms that individuals and firms use to describe what individual brokers do: investment advisor, financial planner, etc.   And one more confusing element: typically only discount brokers use the ""broker"" term. Most firms call themselves ""investment dealers.""  (A lot of this confusion and overlap comes from the U.S., where ""broker"" and ""dealer"" are distinguished much more frequently as two different activities.)  In Canada, the term broker or investment broker usually means a firm that is licensed and regulated by the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) to oversee and manage all investment dealership firms and trading activities.   Individual salespeople (""investment advisors"" or ""financial planners"") are licensed and regulated by IIROC, or, if they only sell mutual funds (not stocks, ETFs and bonds), by the Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA). In order to sell mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and/or ETFs, an individual must be qualified (have passed relevant exams) and licensed by a firm that is regulated either by IIROC or the MFDA.   Differences between the firms you have listed:   At the most basic level, there are bank-owned brokerages (like BMO InvestorLine), and there are independent brokerages (like Questrade). ""Independent"" in this context means ""independent from a bank.""   Vanguard and BlackRock, by contrast, are not brokerages. Instead, they are manufacturers of financial products - ETFs and mutual funds. Normally you would    buy a product manufactured by BlackRock or Vanguard hold it in an investment account at BMO InvestorLine or Questrade and buy it with or without the assistance of an investment advisor who is licensed to recommend suitable products for you."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3duhcx,Palestrina,2,Sun Jul 19 16:43:45 2015 UTC,"Another potential source of confusion is that Vanguard sells direct to investor in the US, but as far as I know not in Canada."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3duhcx,paniconomics,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:50:52 2015 UTC,Right - I meant to include that!
PersonalFinanceCanada,3duhcx,Palestrina,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:52:53 2015 UTC,"Is there a reason Vanguard can't sell directly to Canadian investors, or do they simply choose not to be in that business here?"
PersonalFinanceCanada,3duhcx,justlikeyouimagined,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:11:23 2015 UTC,"No reason they can't, but the regulatory regime is onerous for non-Canadian participants.   With our much smaller population, I'm pretty sure the value proposition isn't there for them.   However, they make their products available to Canadians at astoundingly low cost, so I'm totally happy. :)"
PersonalFinanceCanada,3duhcx,Palestrina,3,Sun Jul 19 17:14:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I figured it was something like that. It's too bad - I would probably use them over Questrade if it were possible. Free trades of Vanguard ETFs and cheap trades of everything else. Even their advising service is attractive at 0.30%."

PersonalFinanceCanada,3duhcx,Tempestshade,4,Sun Jul 19 17:55:28 2015 UTC,"Investors Group is a mutual fund manufacturer, and there are a whole lot of sales agents who sell IG funds either primarily or exclusively.   Edit: Long article, maybe useful, about the IG sales model: http://www.morningstar.ca/td/industry/news.asp?changeprtl=y&articleid=887  I note that this article describes IG reps as a captive sales force."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3duhcx,Palestrina,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:07:55 2015 UTC,"I know an IG rep pretty well - most of them act captive, but none of them actually are. They can sell just about any fund in Canada, they just usually keep it in-house because it's easier and they have a pay scale that most of them find more attractive(same amount in the long run, but more front-loaded)."

PersonalFinanceCanada,3duhcx,ether_reddit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:51:59 2015 UTC,"A broker is someone who has the connections required to buy and sell stock and other investment securities on your behalf. They are licensed by the provincial government.  Any bank can provide this service (you have mentioned Scotia and BMO), and there are other companies that do it as well, both big and small. Some of them charge a lot of money in exchange for giving you advice about what and when to buy and sell (this is ""full service""), while others charge much lower rates and expect you to do your own research and make your own decisions (this is ""discount"" or ""execution only"").  I'm not sure Blackrock or Vanguard are actually brokers; I think they just organize and manage ETFs. I could be wrong about this."

Technically they are licensed by the SRO - either MFDA or IIROC, depending on the individual's category of registration.

PersonalFinanceCanada,3duhcx,Palestrina,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:45:05 2015 UTC,"You may be well served by a financial advisor if you are not familiar with investing (and even if you are, and want the benefit of service). There are a number of so-called ""robo-advisors"" available in Canada right now. They are essentially online financial advisors and portfolio managers that offer a relatively ""turn-key"" investment service for a very good price (compared with traditional advisors). I am using WealthBar right now - have been for a few months - and it has generally been a good experience. Once your accounts are set up (which is done through a few online brokerages - Virtual Brokers, Interactive Brokers are options) , you simply add money by electronic funds transfers of bill payments. They execute all the trades, rebalance the portfolio from time to time, and handle all reporting. The basic portfolios are generally low-cost exchange traded funds (listed on Canadian and US exchanges). Total ""cost"" for most users will be less than 1% (which includes the underlying MER for the ETFs and any other costs/fees/admin charges). Much has been written about ""robo-advisors"" in Canada so check out some of the articles (MoneySense mag is a great place to start)."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3duhcx,Mike-BC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:56:09 2015 UTC,"I don't like robo-advisors. They tend to favor ""black magic"" asset classes such as covered calls."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3duhcx,KuduIO,2,Sun Jul 19 17:52:11 2015 UTC,"Covered calls make up a very small percentage of the portfolio - typically 5% or less. There is a reason to include covered calls in a portfolio, including to enhance yield (WealthBar's covered call ETFs yield from 4.5 - 5%) and hedge against a falling market. I view including covered calls in the robo-advisor portfolio as a value-add by the advisor, since it is not something the average investor would think to include in a portfolio."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3duhcx,Mike-BC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:11:16 2015 UTC,"I recently read an article about stock ownership in the US [1]. A part of relevant text:  """"""Nobody owns stock. What you own is an entitlement to stock held for you by your broker. But your broker doesn't own the stock either. What your broker owns is an entitlement to stock held for it by Cede & Co., which is a nominee of the Depository Trust Company, which is a company that is in the business of owning everyone's stock for them. This system sounds convoluted but actually makes it easy to keep track of things: If I sell stock to you, I don't have to courier over a paper share certificate, or call up the company and have it change its shareholder register. Our brokers just change some electronic entries at their DTC accounts and everything is cool.""""""  Is the same thing true for Canada, or has Canada taken a better approach, changing regulations to be compatible with the digital age?

PersonalFinanceCanada,3duhcx,Palestrina,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:19:34 2015 UTC,"Palestrina got it right, but one added bit of confusion she didn't address - some investment advisors use terms like ""full-service broker"" or ""stockbroker"" - these refer to individuals being paid to provide financial advice(usually buying and selling individual stocks) for their clients.

PersonalFinanceCanada,3dv3a3,toasterstrudel2,5,Sun Jul 19 21:01:45 2015 UTC,"Garth talks up preferred shares a lot, but I'm not convinced they're worth the added volatility. Their yield looks like a GIC, but the price swings are like an equity.  For now, I've settled with CCP's advice (essentially ""YAGNI"" - ""you aren't gonna need it"") -- http://canadiancouchpotato.com/2015/03/12/the-role-of-preferred-shares/ http://canadiancouchpotato.com/2015/03/17/does-your-portfolio-need-preferred-shares/ http://canadiancouchpotato.com/2015/03/23/are-preferred-share-indexers-dumb-money/    The tldr is:   We do not believe preferred shares are appropriate for tax-sheltered accounts such as RRSPs or TFSAs. Once you remove their tax advantage, preferred shares do not offer sufficient returns to justify their additional risks compared with high-quality bonds.   This doesn't mean you should buy preferred shares and keep them outside your registered account -- if your RRSP and TFSA aren't both maxed, don't even consider it. Get those two filled up first. Preferred shares are not for newbies. There's a reason why they're not in CCP model portfolios and never have been."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3dv3a3,ether_reddit,3,Sun Jul 19 21:08:11 2015 UTC,This is a good reply. I wasn't thinking of using them personally but you make a good point that Garth's perspective is one of a money manager dealing mostly with boomers that have plenty of assets and maxed out tax shelters.
PersonalFinanceCanada,3dv3a3,toasterstrudel2,3,Sun Jul 19 21:16:47 2015 UTC,"The only retail investors who really need to consider preferreds are those in a high tax bracket, with significant taxable investments and the need for immediate yield. For people in that situation, preferreds may outperform a mix of corporate bonds and equities (which would be the closest analogue) because of preferable tax treatment.  As for Garth, he sometimes gets (unfairly, in my view) criticized on PFC because the asset allocations he's suggested aren't appropriate for most people, particularly those in the accumulation phase of life. But his target clientele is very different from the average PFCer, and so some suggestions he makes (preferreds being the most obvious example) are inappropriate for most of us PFCers, but not necessarily inappropriate for his (prospective) clients."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3dv3a3,comfortable_in_cross,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:35:32 2015 UTC,"Also, Garth has an inherent built-in bias as he is a money manager and can't invest any monies locked up in real estate.

PersonalFinanceCanada,3dv3a3,CS-05,2,Mon Jul 20 13:35:28 2015 UTC,"If you're going to hold preferred shares, the only place where they make sense is in a taxable account. The primary benefit of preferred shares is that they pay dividends instead of interest, and are therefore taxed at a lower rate. That is probably the only reason a retail investor would ever want to hold preferred shares instead of corporate bonds from the same company or companies.  Don't put preferreds in an RRSP or TFSA.   Holding US preferreds isn't something I've looked into before, but I assume their dividends are taxed the same as any foreign dividend or income, and therefore they don't attract the preferential treatment that Canadian preferred share dividends do. You may wish to think twice about holding US preferred shares."
PersonalFinanceCanada,3dv3a3,aughhhhh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:15:28 2015 UTC,"Garth's argument was that preferred shares have been whacked down in price, are now oversold, and present a great value play for investors.  He suggested around a ~20% allocation. If you agree with his arguments, buy some CPD or ZPR."
