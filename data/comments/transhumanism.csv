So while funding individual organizations and studies, like the brain preservation prize, might be useful, it may be a lot more impactful to change the perceptions of the average person towards death and dying.   If we are able to achieve this, then we can potentially direct billions of dollars towards ending aging.

And some conscious entities would exist only for seconds? Is there a conscious entity formed during our interaction here just for seconds? Even though we both process it asynronously ? When is it born, when does it die?  How do you demarcate between organism and environment? What about the interactions between me and other conscious parts of the environment? How about chains of interactions? I interact with a rabbit which interacts with another rabbit I have never seen. Does this form  a conscious being? Is all consciouness one if all conscious beings come in contact through these chains?  I think assuming every interactions between conscious beings creates a conscious entity leads to pretty much there is one consciousness everywhere or there are these microconsciousness' created when we interact with anybody anywhere for just seconds. Both of which are asthetically inpleasing to me, and seem intiutively implasable though ""Our sense of strangeness is no rigorous index of reality."""

transhumanism,3dr7uy,MyInquisitiveMind,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:25:45 2015 UTC,"Definetly legally not murder.  Matter fact, not all conscious dying is even murder. How about a rabbit dying.  But, never communicating with an individual after communicating over the critical threshold to create a consciousness if everyone who communicates forms a conscious, would result in the dying a a conscious right?  While not ""murder"" its definetly ethically challenging for that perseptive to stop communicating."
transhumanism,3dr7uy,Aquareon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:33:08 2015 UTC,"I don't see it as particularly ethically challenging.  I'm not sure I understand your logic.    Reality is amoral.  Ethics are a human construct that serve to lead to a stable society.  We have plenty of laws and social norms that ensure the continued functioning of these ad hoc entities.  Marriage as an extreme example, but even behavioral norms at the work place or at school.  Consciousness cannot die, but it can stop.  Living organisms die.   Anesthesia stops consciousness.  Eventually it begins again (ideally).    This is a conflation of ""Consciousness"" with ""Personhood"" or our ""identity"" or, in more metaphysical terms, the Soul.    Since we're in transhumanism, I'll refer to the commonly tossed around idea of copying consciousness into a computer (or something).  If your body is destroyed by this process, that person, that organism, is dead.  The consciousness, in this new vessel, continues on.  It may even be possible to copy the consciousness into multiple vessels.  That doesn't mean the organism from which the consciousness originated is still alive.  It might feel that way, or think that way, but that doesn't make it true.  Consciousness seems to be an emergent process, and that process appears to be extendable outside an individual organism."
transhumanism,3dr7uy,Involution88,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:01:15 2015 UTC,"Your statements place too much value on the concept of the individual and the uniqueness of consciousness.  The conception of consciousness you describe feels similar to the conception of a soul.    I suggest that consciousness is an emergent system.  You're correct to say, 'this implies that there is consciousness everywhere' and also to say 'there are microconsciousness everywhere,' they are not mutually exclusive.  There is plenty of evidence to suggest that your brain is composed of multiple microconsciousness..es.  Eg, the experiments where the two halves of the brain are split, and aberrant behaviors emerge where one half of the body acts independently and not in concert with the other half.  This may also be true not just horizontally but vertically-- that the ever older parts of our brain, while acting in concert, are themselves independent.  The unity of this into one conscious mind may just be an illusion.  Check out Free Will by Sam Harris.  It's what got me interested in this subject (well, along with a few other works, but that's the smallest and most fun).  Be glad to discuss this more."

Consciousness has to be housed/occur somewhere in the brain (I think the thalamus receiving brain-sweeping 40Hz gamma waves is the most likely candidate these days), and the United States has no analogue to that, there's no central processing center. Evolution by natural selection gave us consciousness, and it doesn't work the same way for things as large-scale as a nation state."

An octupus doesn't really have central processing center right?  Also hard to decide.. What is the size limit on consciousness ? With out really knowing physically how consciouness works, it sounds pretty difficult to give a size limit, or know if there is one."
transhumanism,3dr7uy,ananasas,3,Sat Jul 18 19:25:41 2015 UTC,"I doubt there's a size limit for consciousness.  It helps to think of consciousness as a sliding scale. Just because something is conscious doesn't mean it can think, see, hear, smell, taste, or feel.  Imagine a self-driving car. Is it conscious? It certainly couldn't look in a mirror and think, ""Oh my god, I'm a fucking car!"" But it can process its surroundings and make decisions based on its surroundings. So why couldn't it experience some sort of qualia?  Now imagine an ant. It can definitely see its surroundings. Is it conscious? It has a brain, and it reacts to its environment, yet it can't look in a mirror and think, ""Oh my god, I'm a fucking ant,"" just like the self-driving car couldn't look in a mirror and think, ""Oh my god, I'm a fucking car!""  The US might be conscious, but that doesn't automatically mean it must have every kind of conscious experience that humans have. It might literally think, ""Fuck yeah, 'Murica!"", but then again, it might not. We'd have to learn how to measure a human's thoughts before even dreaming about attempting to read a country's thoughts. On the other hand, the US certainly does react to environmental stimuli. For example, Pearl Harbor → Hiroshima."

transhumanism,3dourd,Yosarian2,2,Sat Jul 18 07:36:41 2015 UTC,"One other thought is that one of the main reasons for different transhumanist strains is just the rate at which people expect technology to advance.   People who think that technology is going to move relatively slowly tend to think in terms of ""bioprogressivm"" and democratic transhumanism (and, often, cryonics).   People who think we might or might not get to immortality in their lifetimes tend to focus on that.  On the other hand, people who expect a much faster rate of technological progress leading to a near-term singularity are less concerned with those two issue (because they expect them to be ""easy"" or even obsolete with the technology we'll have in 2030 or 2045) and more concerned with what the singularity is going to look like and how can we make sure that it goes well.     Some or many of the above are transhumanists with basically the same goals and philosophical beliefs, just different points of focus based on how fast they expect the technology to move."
transhumanism,3dourd,Kafke,2,Sat Jul 18 13:18:19 2015 UTC,"Really good point. Both view could be partially right, where there is a partial influence both from the belief of technological development speed and some that has to do with background assumptions about consciousness and identity, which delimit what is and what isn't possible as a future.  For example, you could believe that technology is advancing really fast and the rate will accelerate. And yet, not believe in mind-uploading because background assumptions about the nature of consciousness compels you to believe that digital computers won't in principle ever ""generate consciousness.""  Likewise, you may believe that technological development will get slower (we are just in a local inflection point with a brief window of quasi-exponentiality), and yet believe that ""consciousness is an easy problem."" Thus, maybe 2020's supercomputers will be able to simulate the intelligence of humans even if they are not much more powerful than today's supercomputers.   Sadly I didn't ask a question specific to belief about technological development speed."

Think of it in this way. If you would find talk to your 5 year old self. You are an entirely different person now from then. With different convictions, opinions and personality. The only difference between then and now is you have more processing power due to a more developed brain. And information you gathered during your life. Now if you were to fuse your brain with your 5 year old version. Your 5 year old version would actually understand your convictions and reasons thus changing his worldview.   If you do this exact process with the entire humanity something along that line would happen.

An intresting empirical idea would be to numb a bunch of peoples left have brain observe personality, numb right brain, oberserve personality, and of course whole brian. If its true that each half of the brain was individually conscious then this could give us actual data on what sort of personality results from the combination of conscious beings.

Even if there is some sort of totalitarian government which can somehow enforce this ""freely available to everyone"" concept, where ""free"" means with respect to money, the currency will simply change to something else. Rather than money, something like political influence will be traded for earlier, faster, and better access.

Also, we don't really understand intelligence, there is all the talk about how the only intelligence that we measure with intelligence tests is the arithmetic-logic, and there is other intelligences ( or parts of intelligence ) that also affect how we perform.

Even if we ignore the author sweeping science under the rug, the bigger issue IMO is that the article fails to give proper weight to the implications of such modifications in a global capitalist society. He brings up inequality only to  sort of hand-waves it away, but this should have been the meat of the subject.

Putting the morality question of whether we actually should aside, intelligence isn't the hallmark of a successful life as many deem it to be. At best, it's a tool, an utensil that can aid you through life, and not even the most important one at that.   So there's that, and there is the fact that people quite simply don't make choices for their children based on economical premises. Bar the occasional statistically insignificant exception, parents don't wish to design a single aspect of their children, even when they have the opportunity to do so. Even if increased intelligence is a useful advantage for a child, that fact will not play a part in the decision making process of prospective parents. You're creating a new life, not a designer couch, and human beings are simply not wired to treat the former as the latter. Again, barring said occasional exception.  That's not to say that there won't be a few people who will opt in to increasing their children's IQ, but they will remain a minority, so this scenario is not nearly as inevitable as the author suggests."

Or is it just the same experience, but with more information? From what I can tell, it sounds like it'd just be like you feel 'touch' wherever the implant is, when you get close to magnets. Is this indeed the case?"
transhumanism,3dfl92,Kafke,2,Thu Jul 16 03:10:44 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but also have a magnetic implant.  It is definitely a different sensation to simply touch. It feels like pulling, but not like someone pulling on the skin or finger, almost like a longing to connect.  Mine ""feels"" both magnet fields and electrical fields, so it gets set off quite frequently."
transhumanism,3dfl92,CheezyMcWang,3,Thu Jul 16 06:02:10 2015 UTC,"That's still not really answering the question.  I'm really trying to get at the topic of qualia.  That is, touch is a fundamentally different experience that sight/hearing/etc. Not in terms of information gathered (you can touch braille and still read, for example), but the actual qualia/sensory experience itself is different.  A good related example is the scientist guy who wore glasses that inverted his vision. He saw everything upside down, until a little bit in, where his qualia adjusted to 'fix' the image.  Similarly, I was wondering if there's a distinct and 'new' sensory qualia that is fundamentally different than touch. Or if it's just using touch to provide new information? Common sense says that you'd just have the same 'touch' qualia/sense, but simply be able to detect magnets/electrical fields with it, rather than it being a new sense/qualia entirely.  Is my question making sense?   Perhaps we can rephrase it using an analogy, when a blind person gets 'vision' for the first time, it's not just 'the sense is touch but you can see things that are far away' It's a whole new qualia/sensory experience itself. Fundamentally different.  Likewise, I'm curious if there's a 'switch' or something where it becomes it's own unique qualia/sense separate from touch. Or if the sense is indeed touch, but the touch provides new/more information.  Edit: The TL;DR is that I imagine it to simply be a 'pulling' or 'tug' on your finger that the magnet is embedded in. AKA, still the 'touch' sense that people are familiar with, but being engaged with different information (magnets). Rather than it being a whole new sense (say Touch vs Sight or Hearing)."
transhumanism,3dfl92,Kafke,2,Thu Jul 16 06:09:43 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's fundamentally different than touch, but rather an extension. EMF is like a ""digital texture"", you can run your finger along the edge of the ""energy bubble"" and literally map out the shape of it. The closer you get to the source the more it feels like sticking your finger in an air current.   If the ability to feel EMF wasn't so proximity based (can't feel the field further than an inch of things like Microwave/Laptop AC Adapter) I'd imagine it would become a new qualia.  The literal sensation of touching EMF is a buzzing in the finger, similar to the pins and needles when a sleeping limb is waking up. But the longer you have it and use it, it becomes much more of a ""I can feel invisible objects"" rather than ""my finger is buzzing"". Since the magnet is right on the finger tip nerves, the information is coming from inside, which is totally different than wearing a magnetic ring.  Around other magnets it's a pulling or tugging feeling, like pressure in your finger. My wife and I both have one, and we can ""touch"" without touching, by hovering ones hand over the other, usually when they aren't looking or paying attention :D"

EMF is like a ""digital texture"", you can run your finger along the edge of the ""energy bubble"" and literally map out the shape of it.

For lighter (fictional) reading: I've just finished Zoltan Istvan's The Transhumanist Wager for the second time, and it poses some compelling philosophical and ethical questions -- although the answers provided in the book may seem somewhat extreme.  Another book I'm looking to read in the near future (provided I can get through The Transhumanist Reader first) is H+/-: Transhumanism and Its Critics. Of course, there is plenty to read out there (and I suspect a lot of it isn't on Amazon, although it's convenient ;), but these are on my [transhuman philosophy] reading list at present.   There are a number of other books I could recommend, which aren't strictly transhuman in nature, but are interesting (if you're into the more technological aspects). Nick Bostrom's Superintelligence for example, speaks of AI and what could happen if we were to build a super artificial intelligence -- again, not strictly transhuman, since a more transhumanist approach may be to enhance our own intellectual abilities at the same time; but an interesting read nonetheless. Ray Kurzweil also has a number of books that cover a variety of related topics.

He doesn't even talk about de Grey or any of that, more of the mainstream stuff, but even there it's still pretty exciting to see some of the research being done right now, while also making clear that we're still very much in early days on a lot of this stuff.  If you want to really stretch your mind about some of the longer term possibilities, though, you should read  The Singularity Is Near - Ray Kurzweil It's from back in 2006 (I think he's going to be coming out with an updated version soon) but even so it's quite amazing in it's predictions, all of which are based on Moore's law.   Not sure if I totally accept his timeline or all of his predictions, but it's defiantly worth a read.  For fiction I recommend  Accelerando - Charles Stross Amazing science fiction book.
