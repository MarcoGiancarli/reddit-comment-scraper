Pokemongiveaway,3dx6ft,calavera20012,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:19:03 2015 UTC,Hi! Today I have a question a HP (something) ditto is used to pass de HP to the baby pokemon?? :0 Thanks in advance :3 :-D
Pokemongiveaway,3dx6ft,LOLmouseLOL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:58:05 2015 UTC,"You mean for breeding right? I'm not sure if I understand, but I'll try to help you out! Let's say we wanted to breed a 5IV Squirtle (those IV's being HP, Defense, Sp. Defense, Sp. Attack, and Speed). First, we need a Squirtle, and a Pokemon (we would normally use Dittos) with the correct nature we want (say, Calm for example). The Ditto needs to hold an Everstone, that allows it to pass down it's Calm nature to the egg's we will be making. The eggs will hatch, and we'll have a Calm natured Squirtle. Now, for the IV's. Some people have 5-6 (which is a perfect number for IV's) IV Ditto's, and get them to hold Destiny Knot's, while the Squirtle now holds the Everstone. The point of the Destiny Knot, is that it spreads out IV's from both Pokemon onto the next egg you're breeding. You want to check the IV's of these eggs, and when one of them is better then the Squirtle you're currently using to breed, you switch it out. I hope this helped!"
Pokemongiveaway,3dx6ft,calavera20012,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:50:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I knew about breeding I mean if you have. HP Fire ditto and you breed it with a dragalgae the little pokemon can have HP Fire?"
Pokemongiveaway,3dx6ft,babycutlet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:07:47 2015 UTC,"If I'm understanding correctly, then yes it'd be possible for the little Pokemon to have HP fire. It all depends on which IVs get passed down using the destiny knot"
Pokemongiveaway,3dx6ft,calavera20012,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:26:18 2015 UTC,Thank you!
Pokemongiveaway,3dx6ft,LOLmouseLOL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:33:41 2015 UTC,"To further that, to get Hidden Power Fire your total IV's have to add up to a certain number. HP Fire's number is between 34-37. Each IV has a different value when it comes to Hidden Power. You need to combine them to make them add up between 34 and 37. Stealing from that link, here are the values of each IV:   The easiest way to discover the type of your Hidden Power is to start from zero, and: Add 32 if the Special Defense IV is odd. Add 16 if the Special Attack IV is odd. Add 8 if the Speed IV is odd. Add 4 if the Defense IV is odd. Add 2 if the Attack IV is odd. Add 1 if the HP IV is odd.     My Magnezone has HP Fire, and it's perfect IV's are in HP, Defense, and Sp. Defense. That amount adds up to 37, and got me my HP Fire Magnezone!"

Pokemongiveaway,3dx6ft,SaberMarie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:21:40 2015 UTC,"PowerSaves is great for cloning and you can edit pretty much anything from IVs to Pokeballs. Keep in mind it's possible to break your cartridge using it, though. I broke my X cartridge about a year ago. The problem was most likely with the included cable breaking / disconnecting during a write, so you should try to replace the mini-usb as soon as possible. It is a mini-usb, not a micro-usb cable. Apparently the PSP uses the same cable?"
Pokemongiveaway,3dx6ft,calavera20012,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:32:15 2015 UTC,OK thank you a lot for the information I'll keep that in mind

I'm starting to feel bad because I really don't have anything to give back. I guess what I'm wondering is should I stop asking for things until I get something to give back or is it okay to continue asking?"
Pokemongiveaway,3dtekq,Rkramos91,2,Sun Jul 19 20:46:03 2015 UTC,"Whatever you want to do. We don't really have a limit or anything on how many requests you can make until you have to do a giveaway. Just keep your request within the rules, don't ask for legends, events, etc.   If you want to stop making requests until you make a giveaway that's up to you. If you want to keep making requests and not do a giveaway, it's your choice. It doesn't really matter if you just do giveaways or just make requests, or do both. Many users just come and go as they please to participate in giveaways, make requests, or hold giveaways.   P.S. Just don't make too many request posts in one day, haha."
Pokemongiveaway,3dtekq,Meganium13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:08:37 2015 UTC,"Well, I normally participate in giveaways, since I don't have anything to give back.

Pokemongiveaway,3dtekq,Rkramos91,2,Sun Jul 19 21:14:08 2015 UTC,"It's really up to you- we don't police how much each user takes from giveaways, so unless you're going crazy enough for it to come to our attention it's fine. If you're feeling bad about it feel free to stop for a while until you feel you can start taking pokemon from giveaways again. Personally, I think it's fine to continue taking pokemon as long as you're only taking what you'll use and you're mindful of others on the sub (i.e. if it looks like the giveaway host might run out before everyone who wants a pokemon gets it and you've already received a few things today, or you don't really need it, maybe step back and let other people have one).  Also, as an aside; if you have any future questions it's better to send in a modmail (click the 'message the mods' button on the sidebar) or to tag us by username (e.g. include ' /u/velosarahptor ' somewhere in your post) so you can be sure we'll see it."

Pokemongiveaway,3dtekq,Meganium13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:27:04 2015 UTC,"Just some breeding and maybe ev-training. Magmar and electabuzz can be a pain to breed as I have to evolve elekid and magby before breeding. As of now, I have a 3 IV elekid with the egg moves: Dynamic Punch, Cross-Chop, Ice Punch, and Fire Punch that you can use to breed."

Pokemongiveaway,3dtekq,Meganium13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:35:28 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm currently in the process of trying to figure out how exactly to get maxed IV Pokémon. I have a 6IV Ditto that I can breed with, but I'm not sure exactly how to tell if their IVs are maxed or not. Also what's the best way to EV train?"
Pokemongiveaway,3dtekq,Rkramos91,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:41:30 2015 UTC,"To check for max IVs, you just show a Pokemon to the IV man (found in the Pokemon centers of the Battle Resort for ORAS or Kiloude City for XY). If he tells you that a stat can't be beat, that means it has a perfect IV for that stat. When several IVs are maxed, he will say that it's best stat is HP (for example) and then say that the other stats (eg. attack, defense, etc.) are equally good and that they can't be beat. The best way to EV train depends on the level of Pokemon you want. In this case, since we don't mind leveling them up, the best way is to use horde battles with power items and pokerus."
Pokemongiveaway,3dtekq,Meganium13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:55:08 2015 UTC,"Well, I've done that, But when I use an IV Calculator, I normally don't get maxed IV numbers. I unfortunately don't have the power up items."
Pokemongiveaway,3dtekq,babycutlet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:01:24 2015 UTC,"Do you level up your Pokemon in battles before checking the IVs? If so, you are introducing EVs which need to be accounted for. Moreover, IV calculators give you a range of possible IVs. They get more exact with higher levels. If you want to use an IV calculator, I would recommend taking newly hatched Pokemon to the battle institute (Lumiose City or Mauville City) save before the challenge. Then the level 1 Pokemon will be raised to level 50 for a more accurate estimate. Then, just soft-reset. I could do the EV training if you don't have the items (I don't have enough to give away any and I will need all my BP for the evolution items)."
Pokemongiveaway,3dtekq,Rkramos91,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:10:41 2015 UTC,"No, I normally check them as soon as I hatch a batch of five. I'll breed  some then. They'll all be level one though. How soon are you wanting to hold this give away, and how many of each do you want? Do you want specific IV ones?"
Pokemongiveaway,3dtekq,babycutlet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:22:25 2015 UTC,I don't know when it will be. I usually just hold giveaways after all the Pokemon are bred. The goal is 15-20 of each. Magby should be modest with all but the Attack IV. Elekid and Rhydon should be Adamant with all but the Special Attack IV.
Pokemongiveaway,3dtekq,Meganium13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:28:06 2015 UTC,"so when you go to the IV checker, he says you have max IVs, but when you double check with the calculator it says you don't have them? also are you remembering to have your ditto hold the destiny knot?"
Pokemongiveaway,3dtekq,Meganium13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:55:10 2015 UTC,"Yea, Ditto is holding the Destiny Knot. I'm going to do some breeding for another user tomorrow. What's the best calculator to use?"
Pokemongiveaway,3dtekq,Meganium13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:56:49 2015 UTC,"I haven't really used IV calculators. To me, the only reason to know the specific IV value (other than max) is for breeding specific hidden powers, which i don't do. but if you're getting conflicting results between the in-game checker and the online calculator, believe the in-game checker. odds are some information isn't being input correctly or the calculator has errors. if you still want to use a calculator, try using serebii's, since they've always been a very reliable source.   if you want, i'd be willing to check one of the pokemon you bred both in-game and with the calculator to make sure nothing's being missed?"

It's so very adorable.  931  This world isn't as horrible as you think it is because we're at an age where even if we don't lead fulfilling lives, we can still indulge in materialistic things to occupy our attention until our deaths.  ¯_(ツ)_/¯  At least you won't feel so bad about the world as you would have if you lived a few hundred years ago."

Pokemongiveaway,3dsshl,yoruichi0,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:50:51 2015 UTC,"[058]: I was born in South Korea. My favorite part of our culture there is the strong emphasis on family and getting together even after a family member has passed. In Korea, after someone passes away, instead of remembering their birthday as a special day, you meet together to eat and celebrate their day of passing.  [734]: Charizard. He was the classic badass-dragon-looking Pokemon from the original Red versions and cartoon series. He is still a staple in every Pokemon party I play with, even in his 6th generation.  [543]: The world is as horrible as you think it is if that is what you are looking for. However, it's also a world composed of so many great things as well. If you want to look for the people, place, or things that make the world less horrible, then you can definitely find them here."

I think it's great that our culture clearly values that.  [404] Umbreon is my favorite. He looks awesome and he's secretly a defensive powerhouse.

Pokemongiveaway,3dptq3,mattlayton1986,3,Sat Jul 18 07:24:18 2015 UTC,"Hey guys! So, I'm working on my own GTS deposit guide (a rather large project). If it looks good when I'm finished, I might implement it in my giveaways to provide more structure to what should and should not be deposited as GTS fodder. Its a work in progress, but here's what I've got so far: Matt's GTS Deposit Guide.    The idea I'm going for is that anything in the green and yellow sections would be completely acceptable deposits for anyone taking part in my giveaways, while I would skip or warn anyone posting Pokemon listed in the red section. I could link to this spreadsheet in my giveaway rules so people would be held accountable for their deposits, in hopes that it would make sending out 175-250 Pokemon go faster.    I'd love feedback from any giveaway hosts about how you feel this would work (or even feedback about my choices of Pokemon placement within the categories); from those of you who participate in giveaways here, about how you would feel if this were included in a giveaway's rules; or even from the /r/PokemonGiveaway mods about its use on this subreddit (for the most part, I've made my placement choices compliant with this subreddit's GTS deposit guide guidelines).    When providing feedback, please keep in mind that these choices are definitely somewhat subjective. For example, /u/Purpzle88 might disagree with my placement of Magikarp in the ""Do Not Deposit"" category, since that (and Electrike) are all she accepts. Where my choices deviate from PokemonGiveaway's guide, its mostly because I know other users (like Purpzle88) only ask for certain Pokemon, and the GTS gets flooded when that happens.    I'll update the spreadsheet as I can, and the link above should reflect those updates. Hope to hear some good constructive feedback!!"
Pokemongiveaway,3dptq3,mattlayton1986,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:31:40 2015 UTC,"awesome guide it is very clean and easy to navigate, but you need to add Wingull to the 'green' section as it is this subreddits mascot."
Pokemongiveaway,3dptq3,mattlayton1986,2,Sat Jul 18 18:28:35 2015 UTC,"When I add Wingull, it will be in the green section. I've had good luck and no sniping with people who deposit Wingulls. I'm following the XY gameplay route when adding Pokemon to the guide, so I haven't got to Wingull yet, but when I do, he will be in the ""Ok to deposit"" section. Thanks for the feedback!!"
Pokemongiveaway,3dptq3,mattlayton1986,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:35:44 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, but what about the pokemon unobtainable in XY without trades or friendsafari?  I imagine most of them should be in the yellow section if not the red one.  I know for sure that all the baby pokemon should be red as they get sniped fairly regularly."
Pokemongiveaway,3dptq3,ZeroTheFlygon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:39:48 2015 UTC,"Well the list will (hopefully) cover all 720 available Pokemon by the time I'm done. Some Pokemon that are rare or unobtainable in XY are available in ORAS, and vice versa. I'm trying to evaluate each Pokemon's overall availability across XYORAS as well as other characteristics about each that might make them snipable or not snipe-worthy. Also, I'm trying to take into account my own experiences hosting giveaways with Pokemon that people often have sniped. Obviously, its a somewhat subjective endeavor, so I welcome feedback from people who have had certain species sniped regularly, or from other giveaway hosts who see certain Pokemon sniped a lot.    In regard to your comment about baby Pokemon, they will all be in the Do not Deposit section. PokemonGiveaway's GTS Deposit guide gives a blanket prohibition for all baby Pokemon, as well as Eevees, Vivillons, starters, level 1 Pokemon, legendaries, etc., and I will follow their wisdom on those because they are indeed sniped often."

I got these pokemons for it:       Character Pokemon Shiny Nature Ability IVs OT TID    Hachiman Sandslash Yes Adamant Sand Rush 6 IV N3wb 55137   Yui Chespin Yes Impish Bulletproof 6 IV Vov 58307   Yukino Shaymin No Modest Natural Cure 6 IV Chris 32216       I know there were some giveaways with Shaymin in the last days but I needed a hedgehog pokemon (or the closest I could get to it) as Oregairu is all about the hedgehog's dilemma. So if you still couldn't get your Shaymin, you'll have another chance ;)  I'll probably do this giveaway tomorrow or on Monday but if you have any suggestion let me know."

Pokemongiveaway,3dgnv3,nullt,2,Thu Jul 16 03:11:35 2015 UTC,"My question (and hopefully it's a good one) is: does soft resetting count towards your shiny goal?

Pokemongiveaway,3dgnv3,Justmicheal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:20:55 2015 UTC,Yes it is possible to get shinies that way too. It'll take a long time but it's possible
Pokemongiveaway,3dgnv3,MerryFellows,2,Thu Jul 16 03:22:49 2015 UTC,"Isn´t it determined the second you get the egg from the daycare if it will be shiny or not, same with the stats? If so it´s impossible to keep resetting for that exact spread + shiny this way? Unless you want to make it very difficult on yourself?"
Pokemongiveaway,3dgnv3,Justmicheal,2,Thu Jul 16 03:34:43 2015 UTC,The Time Machine method is new to Gen VI and you can use it to predict what IVs the egg will have and then replace the parents to hatch perfect Pokemon. I found a guide here using Google and there's probably tons more out there

Pokemongiveaway,3dhbo2,JasonPC,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:20:00 2015 UTC,"For the purpose of giving away and general use it works, but if someone inspected it with a magnifying glass they'd question how an event pokemon is without a ribbon.   The gyarados I gave away simply did not come with one. Of course I went and shinified it thinking that it was possible, but it really isn't because I learned wonder card pokemon have no chance of being shiny if they aren't set to be shiny. Still it doesn't matter because it shouldn't be used as a competitive pokemon, just as a money getting slave.  BTW let me know if you have an old sea chart mew... xD"

Pokemongiveaway,3dhbo2,RockyDoWork,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:57:29 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. You can still battle people from ORAS who have it even though you are playing on X.

Pokemongiveaway,3dhbo2,PokemonLover2189,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:54:50 2015 UTC,Yes or the Battle Resort if you're playing ORAS
Pokemongiveaway,3dhbo2,Rkramos91,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:17:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, just making sure I didn't miss some crazy city in ORAS. But Pokémon in your party."
Pokemongiveaway,3dhbo2,babycutlet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:29:02 2015 UTC,What ivs in the summary?  the numbers in the summary are just the overall stats of the Pokemon. The IVs help determine how big those numbers are going to be. The numbers aren't the ivs themselves.
Pokemongiveaway,3dhbo2,Rkramos91,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:32:47 2015 UTC,"Right, I understand that, but if I'm trying to use an IV calculator to find exact IV #'s it asks for those figures."
Pokemongiveaway,3dhbo2,babycutlet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:27:47 2015 UTC,"So you'll plug those overall stats into the calculator, along with the level, nature, and anything else it asks for, and it should tell you what the IVs are. the only difficult part is that if you've battled with these pokemon or anything, you'll also need to know the pokemon's EVs.   a good way to get the stats to plug into the calculator is to go into a wifi battle and look at the stats you see in that battle since the pokemon will be at lvl 50"
Pokemongiveaway,3dhbo2,Rkramos91,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:38:26 2015 UTC,"Ahh, ok. Well, I tried to use MetalKid's Calculator, but it was telling me I had an impossible combination. I'm assuming that's because I'm breeding with a hacked Ditto? I was wondering if the numbers in the Pokémon Summary had anything to do with it. I was also wondering if there was a way I could easily tell if the Pokémon had maxed IVs that way."
Pokemongiveaway,3dhbo2,babycutlet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:13:40 2015 UTC,Hmmm the ditto being hacked shouldn't affect anything. Did it say specifically what was wrong with the combination?
Pokemongiveaway,3dhbo2,Rkramos91,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:08:16 2015 UTC,"No, it just told me ""Impossible"""
Pokemongiveaway,3dhbo2,babycutlet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:40:50 2015 UTC,Hmmm that's strange. Was this from the parent Pokemon you had or were you checking the one you bred? Would you mind sending me all the info about the Pokemon so I can check it out?

Pokemongiveaway,3d889q,34loppyXsoko,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:19:18 2015 UTC,Good luck ^ ^  And yes it's possible to breed 6iv pokemon. In theory you have 1/32 chance of a 6iv pokemon if both parents have 6iv's.
Pokemongiveaway,3d889q,Rkramos91,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:52:56 2015 UTC,"What if two parents have destiny knots, could I essentially take one parent with 6IV and another with 5IV? Can it work that way?"
Pokemongiveaway,3d889q,34loppyXsoko,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:27:38 2015 UTC,Well the destiny knot only gives the offspring 5iv of the parent. But with a 5iv and 6iv parent it's still possible to get a 6iv pokemon. Here is a link for a breeding guide. It's better explained than I have.
Pokemongiveaway,3d889q,Rkramos91,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:41:35 2015 UTC,"Alright, I was thinking breed a random Pokémon with random IVs with 6IV Ditto and Destiny Knot. Then take the baby with the 5IVs and breed with 6IV Ditto, that should give me a 6IV Pokemon right?"
Pokemongiveaway,3d889q,34loppyXsoko,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:20:37 2015 UTC,Yep there is a chance of getting a 6iv baby with a 5iv+6iv parent (with the desitiny knot).
Pokemongiveaway,3d889q,Shiny_Sylveon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:25:28 2015 UTC,The Destiny Knot picks 5 random IVs from both parents
Pokemongiveaway,3d889q,Rkramos91,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:53:46 2015 UTC,Awesome! So technically breeding for a perfect 6IV Pokémon is fairly easy. Right?
Pokemongiveaway,3d889q,Shiny_Sylveon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:18:03 2015 UTC,"The best chances are by using two 6IV parents and then you'll have a 1/32 chance of the the 6th IV that isn't chosen from the parents to be a 31. Although, 6IV pokemon are usually for mixed attackers only. If you're breeding for a special or physical attacker the stat that is not being used can be any IV."
Pokemongiveaway,3d889q,Rkramos91,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:24:15 2015 UTC,"This is rough on my brain. Ok, so just to make sure I'm understanding this correctly. Using the Destiny Knot, does not guarantee that the Pokémon with 6IVs will pass down 5 of their maxed IV's, it's a random mix between both parent Pokémon, right? So instead, I have a 1/32 chance of the baby Pokémon hatching with 1 maxed IV from the 6IV parent and a 0IV parent, right?"
Pokemongiveaway,3d889q,Shiny_Sylveon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:47:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, it randomly chooses 5 IVs from both parents randomly. So if you have a parent with 6 IVs and another parent with no 31 IVs, the offspring will have IVs from a range of 1-3 IVs most likely. As you get better IV offspring you can replace the parent with them and then you'll have better chances of having the 31 IVs passed on to the offspring."
Pokemongiveaway,3d889q,babycutlet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:59:52 2015 UTC,Just remember that breeding a 6 iv Pokemon with a 0 max iv Pokemon using destiny knot doesn't guarantee a 5 IV child. That would just give a 6/12 chance of the child having 1 max IV

Pokemongiveaway,3cztc6,TwoBifurcated,2,Mon Jul 13 01:46:32 2015 UTC,Can someone explain to me the benefit of having maxed IVs or a Pokémon with their respective Hidden Ability?
Pokemongiveaway,3cztc6,Rkramos91,2,Mon Jul 13 02:56:18 2015 UTC,"IVs, or Individual Values, are hidden stats that every Pokemon has. They range from 0 to 31 in each stat, and cannot be changed without resorting to cheating devices.   ""If you take two Vaporeon (at level 100), one with an ATK IV of 31, and another with an ATK IV of 0, you will see that the difference between the stats is exactly 31. At half the level, the difference becomes half of 31, and so on"" -smogon  HA's are just a  2nd or 3rd potential ability. Some HA's fit better into competitive play then the other abilities.  For example in froakie's non HA ability is torrent which is when HP is below 1/3rd its maximum, power of Water-type moves is increased by 50%. Protean (HA): Before the Pokémon uses a move, it becomes a pure Pokémon of that type.  Protean is more wanted than torrent in competitive play because it can strategize to turn weaknesses into resistances on the fly. It also gets STAB on every move it's using.  I don't know if this was what you were looking for :P"
Pokemongiveaway,3cztc6,babycutlet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:53:53 2015 UTC,"I got ya, I guess it helps. I was just wondering why they were so sought after."
Pokemongiveaway,3cztc6,Rkramos91,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:09:31 2015 UTC,"maxed IVs are so sought after because its very difficult to legitimately get. Normally, IVs are randomly generated for each individual pokemon. The only way to legally manipulate the IVs of a pokemon is to breed one with a parent holding a destiny knot. using a destiny not randomly takes 5 of the IVs between the 2 parents and passes them on to the child. the 6th is random. so using 2 maxed IV parents to breed, the best possibility of getting a maxed child is 1/32. Even if the max IV parents are hacked, the child would still be considered legit if it doesn't have any illegal traits. So not only are they better for battling, but max IV parents are sought after due to the level of difficulty there is to initially get one and also for easier breeding.  Hope that helps!"
Pokemongiveaway,3cztc6,babycutlet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:20:17 2015 UTC,Wow that helps a lot. Is there any other way to max a Pokémon's IV's? Or is the only way through breeding?
Pokemongiveaway,3cztc6,Rkramos91,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:02:08 2015 UTC,"besides for hacking, IVs are totally random and can't be changed =\"
Pokemongiveaway,3cztc6,babycutlet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:06:19 2015 UTC,Insane. There's so much to learn and keep up with.
Pokemongiveaway,3cztc6,Rkramos91,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:19:29 2015 UTC,"So just catching a pokemon in the wild has a 1/32 chance of having a maxed IV stat. if you catch/hatch a pokemon with 1 max IV (lets just say attack), breeding it with a no max IV pokemon and using destiny knot will give the child a 5/12 chance of having a max attack IV and a 1/32 chance of having another max IV. so when you finally breed a pokemon with the maxed attack IV and another max IV, you'll start breeding using that pokemon to try and get a 3rd and so on. I'm not really into breeding, but i believe that's how the system works"
Pokemongiveaway,3cztc6,babycutlet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:24:51 2015 UTC,So essentially I'd be breeding Pokémon anywhere between 60-72 times with a destiny knot to get maxed IVs.
Pokemongiveaway,3cztc6,Rkramos91,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:28:09 2015 UTC,"yeah it could take that long. it'll go much quicker if both parents used for breeding have some maxed IVs. There's sometimes a giveaway that has a lot of 6 IV dittos. If you use one of those to breed with a destiny knot, the process will go much quicker"
Pokemongiveaway,3cztc6,babycutlet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:35:44 2015 UTC,"This may be a stupid question, but how do I determine if said Pokémon has Maxed IV's or not?"
Pokemongiveaway,3cztc6,Sono-chan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:39:52 2015 UTC,"haha there's a character in the game that'll check it for you. If you're in ORAS, he's in the pokemon center on the Battle Resort by the map. He'll rate the pokemon overall, and then he'll list off the pokemon's best stat. If the stat is listed along with the phrase ""It can't be beat"", then it has an IV of 31 for that stat.  so for a 6 IV pokemon, he'll say something like ""It has good HP. Its attack stat is also good. and its defense. and its sp. atk. and its sp. def. and its speed is good too. Stats like those... they simply can't be beat!"""

Pokemongiveaway,3cto7x,Heichou_Austria,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:09:41 2015 UTC,That is actually a very awesome idea. I hope it is possible!
Pokemongiveaway,3cto7x,MarcosCo8en,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:28:17 2015 UTC,Same. But I won't be able to check for a while. Power saves is still shipping
Pokemongiveaway,3cto7x,kingody,0,Fri Jul 10 19:31:15 2015 UTC,No. You can't pass items through pokebank so its impossible to have them in the newer game except in pokemon caught with them
Pokemongiveaway,3cto7x,kingody,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:48:32 2015 UTC,I'm talking about hacking the Pokemon and giving them the items.
Pokemongiveaway,3cto7x,Zentxrno,0,Fri Jul 10 23:50:48 2015 UTC,With hacks I think it is possible
Pokemongiveaway,3cto7x,Zentxrno,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:01:46 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but Powersaves only can only do it on Pokemon X/Y. :)"
Pokemongiveaway,3cto7x,Zentxrno,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:22:19 2015 UTC,So I could gen dream balls onto breedjects or something and give them away?
Pokemongiveaway,3cto7x,Zentxrno,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:48:47 2015 UTC,"Powersaves had a code for Max Items, which includes a lot of bank balls, and then you can put which ever ball you want on the breedject."
Pokemongiveaway,3cto7x,KosukeAoi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:54:08 2015 UTC,Okay thanks!

Pokemongiveaway,3cszqm,Kanniin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:07:26 2015 UTC,They won't be.  I don't have the means for that.  I'm basically trying to get a good Mega Beedrill.
Pokemongiveaway,3cszqm,Kanniin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:08:30 2015 UTC,"Hum, okay! So for me it won't be interesting ;)"

Pokemongiveaway,3crvzk,Meganium13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:48:36 2015 UTC,What are the odds on getting a 6 iv male Larvitar I only ask because I now have 4 Female's
Pokemongiveaway,3crvzk,lukas140990,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:49:20 2015 UTC,"Assuming you are breeding two 6 IV parents with a destiny knot, I believe it's a 1/64 chance. 1/32 for it to be 6 IV, AND 1/2 for it to be male."
Pokemongiveaway,3crvzk,Meganium13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:37:41 2015 UTC,So I've just been VERY unlucky in getting what I want? -.-
Pokemongiveaway,3crvzk,lukas140990,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:15:29 2015 UTC,"Probably (unless there are other factors I am not aware of, or if you are not breeding two 6 IV parents)."
Pokemongiveaway,3crvzk,Meganium13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:52:42 2015 UTC,-.- yeah -.- the parents are both 6 iv pokemon and I don't think that there are any other factors Egg Moves are set and no hidden ability... Is there a way to get 6 IV's guaranteed or make the odds on it easier?
Pokemongiveaway,3crvzk,SaberMarie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:58:55 2015 UTC,Not that I know of. Sorry.
Pokemongiveaway,3crvzk,Meganium13,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:43:37 2015 UTC,"You can try destinyknot.tk to help calculate your odds, but it's as /u/Meganium13 said. It's a 1/64 chance."

Pokemongiveaway,3crvzk,lukas140990,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:16:18 2015 UTC,"You can check the Pokemon's gender ratio at any of the Pokemon websites. Veekun, Bulbapedia, Serebii, etc. Just google the Pokemon and look for the gender ratio information. Tyrannitar has a 50/50 gender ratio, if I recall."

Pokemongiveaway,3cpxrk,donibrown69,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:06:45 2015 UTC,figured this might be easiest way so you dont have to struggle with long line of text :p  https://screencloud.net/v/2ZX0  note:special attack is the unnecessary stat so it could be 2ivs for all I care so 31/31/31/xx/31/31 (screenshot of the conkeldurr build taken from showdown team builder)  and if it would be easier to just do the EV training and trade it over once it evolves to gurdurr I can get the tutor moves like drain/ice punch and knockoff...unfortunately mach punch is an egg move

The link will lead to the person's profile and the person will be notified that you referred to him/her in your comment. There's a limit on how many people will be notified though.

I've watched both seasons, but doing a theme like this is a bit hard  Pawniard/Bisharp= Argyre  Seeing as they are both Steel looking, and they both use blade weapons.  Kaoru Mizusaki= Swoobat  Both are love related, with Kaoru being teased about trying to get a relationship, and Swoobat having love related moves.  This is all I can really come up with, but some of the Kataphrakts have some good similarities to Pokemon. Good luck!"

For Love Swablu and Dratini the only reason the babies would be illegal is if they have their hidden abilities (because hidden abilities weren't available in the same generation apricorn balls were) or impossible egg moves or something like that.

Pokemongiveaway,3cegd3,Claystarfire,2,Tue Jul 7 07:24:17 2015 UTC,"Hey, I have a question.   I was wonder trading today, and in return for a pokemon, I got a Magikarp in the red event ball (whatever it's called) which knew two odd moves 'Celebrate' and 'Happy Hour'. It is also is holding a Stardust. It's Japanese language.  Does anyone know what this is? Is it valuable? Is it hacked?"
Pokemongiveaway,3cegd3,babycutlet,2,Tue Jul 7 12:36:45 2015 UTC,"Its from the hiroshima pc giveaway in japan. those event pokemon are actually allowed on gts and wondertrade, even though its an event."
Pokemongiveaway,3cegd3,Claystarfire,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:43:57 2015 UTC,"Cool. I've never seen or heard of any of them before, I was just wondering. Thanks."
Pokemongiveaway,3cegd3,calavera20012,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:45:35 2015 UTC,"It's probably hacked or cloned if you got it from WonderTrade. The odds of someone giving away a legitimate, uncloned one for free are miniscule and all Pokemon obtained from WT are usually considered hacked/cloned by any sites that care about legitimacy.    It would be considered hacked/cloned at this subreddit, as well as at /r/PokemonTrades."
Pokemongiveaway,3cegd3,Sono-chan,2,Wed Jul 8 13:04:17 2015 UTC,GUYS! OMELETTE GIVEAWAY PART 1 STARTING IN AN HOUR!!
Pokemongiveaway,3cegd3,twofreecents,2,Tue Jul 7 16:52:37 2015 UTC,Finally got TM 91 Flash Cannon today.... O3O I really didn't know that the Streetpass function allows you to have more than one Mirage Spot in a day.. xD Arrrgz.. Made it so much easier! Now I only need Substitute... >w<

Pokemongiveaway,3cegd3,calavera20012,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:34:04 2015 UTC,Ahahaha awww.. thank you!c: But I have that TM on my X copy already~ It's just annoying to transfer all of my Pokemon that need that move over all the time only to teach them Substitute.. :( Especially since I have a bunch of Pokis in mind that would need that move.. I'm only missing TM Substitute and TM Payback on my AS copy now. I'm already glad that I have collected TM's like Trick Room etc. by now since I had to transfer Pokemon that needed that move over to my X copy to teach them it there as well.. it was a pain haha :'D

Pokemongiveaway,3cegd3,supernius,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:04:20 2015 UTC,Looks like your flair is set up properly! Just remember to use the correct post tags when making new submissions :)
Pokemongiveaway,3cegd3,RussianAttackTricycl,2,Tue Jul 7 22:29:23 2015 UTC,Yup! I like how organized this community is. It would drive me up the wall personally if someone came in and did not tag their stuff properly. I just need to get acquainted with reddit formatting and I'll try a small give-away to get a feel for it.
Pokemongiveaway,3cegd3,supernius,2,Tue Jul 7 23:35:53 2015 UTC,"In case you haven't found them yet, you can find a Reddit formatting guide here, a giveaway template for this subreddit here, and a formatting test thread for this subreddit to check and fix mistakes here! Also, this subreddit's formatting guide (which is also linked in the sidebar) explains some /r/Pokemongiveaway-specific formatting like making  symbols!"
Pokemongiveaway,3cegd3,RussianAttackTricycl,2,Wed Jul 8 00:25:05 2015 UTC,"Thank-you for the assistance~ I've had those open in a tab all day. I just want to make sure everything is set for the trades on my end, then I'll finish formatting and writing the post up. Just one small question.  For tags, would it be?   [g]  (enter)  Thread start  or [g] SPACE SPACE Thread start?"
Pokemongiveaway,3cegd3,supernius,2,Wed Jul 8 00:58:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure whether a single enter would work; on Reddit, a single enter is ignored / gets translated into a single space instead, but I'm not sure whether this sub's removal bot recognizes it as a proper separation between the tag and the text.  A single SPACE works though, as would the double space. I personally use double enter instead to put a line break between the [g] and the start of the text, but plenty of people just use a space.  Does that make sense? Sometimes I suck at explaining things."
Pokemongiveaway,3cegd3,RussianAttackTricycl,2,Wed Jul 8 01:11:06 2015 UTC,"Naw, it makes perfect sense to me. I am used to text-formatting, so explaining in that way makes a lot more sense to me at least. Thank-you for all your help though. I am going to attempt this here in a few minutes and hopefully the bot doesn't get at me."
Pokemongiveaway,3cegd3,supernius,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:40:48 2015 UTC,No problem! Let me know if you have any more questions
Pokemongiveaway,3cegd3,SaberMarie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:51:04 2015 UTC,"I certainly will. I went ahead and put the topic up, and now I'm just hoping that I didn't derp on anything."
Pokemongiveaway,3ccx5l,thiemsen,3,Mon Jul 6 22:56:03 2015 UTC,"That sounds amazing.   But I need around 300-400 pokemon to complete my Dex. You can do that though, right?   /s   [Edit] Are you saying see if people need a certain pokemon and then breed them or breed individual pokemon requests? The certain pokemon one may be a stretch. The individual request one is great but will involve a bit of work on your part depending on how many you limit the giveaway to."
Pokemongiveaway,3ccx5l,Syndfull,2,Mon Jul 6 23:03:44 2015 UTC,"Well from what I'm thinking right now is I would, at the start of each week, have the week themed for a specific gen and have people request a pokemon (maybe more than one, not sure yet) that they want and then have them pick them up a few days later so that you can at least get a few things down each week  To reply to your edit, I'm thinking of making a max of so many people able to request per thread and breeding their requests. Honestly both of them will require work but I think I'd be able to do it in some of my free time (especially if I note that I'll make the pick up a day or two later in a separate post)"
Pokemongiveaway,3ccx5l,Syndfull,2,Mon Jul 6 23:07:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this giveaway sounds like a great idea to me. I'd say wait for more input from others, though. I'm going for dex completion over competitive poke's and don't want to speak for the majority of people here."
Pokemongiveaway,3ccx5l,DerpyN3RD,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:09:36 2015 UTC,"Of course! I would mostly be breeding them without anything specific, if anything with random IVs since I'll be using my breeding ditto but other than that they'll be mostly for filling dexes"
Pokemongiveaway,3ccx5l,Delvez,2,Mon Jul 6 23:11:42 2015 UTC,"Your comment just made me think about how long I spend playing Pokemon... Oh dear God, 309:51 Hours"

Pokemongiveaway,3ccx5l,Vatalini,2,Wed Jul 8 03:26:51 2015 UTC,Start with kalos please T_T
Pokemongiveaway,3ccx5l,Vatalini,2,Tue Jul 7 00:12:50 2015 UTC,"It sounds like something that could be done with like one or two more people. You pick a region for that week take a certain amount of requests. Like 5 or less per person and then like keep track of how many of each and hand them out or so?  Or like what Blassie does for her giveaways. Have a list that people can pick from, a set amount and then have them deposit one pokemon in the gts the trade the rest through acquaintances."
Pokemongiveaway,3ccx5l,babycutlet,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:17:30 2015 UTC,"The thing is I can only do so many at a time so I don't think I'm going to limit them necessarily to certain ones as that would limit some things. I think I might make it a max of three per person and have the first through gts then the other two through acquaintance. I'm not sure yet, the distribution may be a bit of trial and error.  I am however thinking of allowing requests for 1-3 days and then having four days to then produce the pokemon and allow for distribution on the seventh before starting the new week.  It'd be difficult so I'm not sure if I will ask for the assistance or not, it'll most likely depend on how the first week goes and if that proves to be somewhat troublesome then I'll probably reach out to someone in the community"
Pokemongiveaway,3ccx5l,Purpzle88,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:25:18 2015 UTC,Haha yeah that's all it is. I imagine that trying to keep track of it all. I wish you luck in it all c=

Have you gone for a HA Carbink or a HA Heatmor in the hordes? 5% encounter rate with only one Pokemon per horde. Those were a nightmare. And I had to breed a Telepathy Ralts with Skill Swap for the Heatmor because it kept dying to the Durant, and then level the Ralts up to like level 70 because the level 20-something Durant were still outspeeding the Ralts. 0/10.

Pokemongiveaway,3c850s,mikavalentine,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:59:06 2015 UTC,the durants uses what move that kill heatamor? earthquake?
Pokemongiveaway,3c850s,mikavalentine,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:05:55 2015 UTC,"No, it's not a specific move. It's just that they all target the Heatmor with regular moves and attack it instead of you (because of the lore that states that they're enemies). If I remember correctly, the attack that did the most damage was Bite, and that was around a 2-3 hit KO against the Heatmor (and, of course, the critical hit ratio seems to skyrocket during these moments). The Heatmor usually went down in one or two turns depending on the Durant's attack. The Heatmor also attacks them, but it doesn't do much good.   Another horde that does this in-game is the Seviper/Zangoose horde. They will focus on each other until the standalone one Pokemon is fainted, and then they will attack you. It's kind of funny to watch, actually."
Pokemongiveaway,3c850s,mikavalentine,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:12:05 2015 UTC,"Super Luck Durant. kkkkkkk.  I did know that diferent pokemon in hordes enconter attacks each other!  When you need the pokemon stay alive, the critical hit happens a looooooot  A dark void darkrai or smeargle can solve this too I think, but telepathy is more safe I guess"

Pokemongiveaway,3c83o4,Cuddly_Kitty,2,Sun Jul 5 20:01:21 2015 UTC,"Usually what I do for a giveaway is have all the pokemon have 4 egg moves, have a bankball, and have 5 random IVs. Just having your pokemon in a bankball gets people interested so I think you're fine.  For the illegal ball combo ordeal, people are most likely still down to obtain them, just make sure you list it as an illegal ball combo in your giveaway.  I'm pretty sure the thing with the 5-8 egg moves doesn't work"
Pokemongiveaway,3c83o4,Ramsta09,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:23:22 2015 UTC,"I don't have any way to change pokeballs or the like, so the pokemon would most likely be in regular pokeballs, Quick Balls, Timer Balls, or Repeat Balls because that's what I used.  The only exception would be if I got the parents through a trade or giveaway, like the illegal ball combos."
Pokemongiveaway,3c83o4,-Kuroh-,2,Sun Jul 5 21:21:40 2015 UTC,"Formatting  We have a formatting guide, some giveaway templates and a formatting mega thread that maybe are useful for you.  If you see a giveaway with a formatting that you like, you can click the ""source"" button and it will show you how it was typed. If you have any  specific questions about formatting, you can try contacting me or post a comment at the daily thread.  Gathering interest.  Before starting your giveaway, you can post about it in the daily thread.  Maintaining order  I think the best thing to do is to observe how other people do their giveaways and see what you think works for you.      There might also be the possibility of an illegal ball combo due to hacked parents, though.   Most people don't have a problem with it, just remember to put [Hacked] in the title.   Also, random question: if there are 5-8 egg moves between pokemon parents, will it be possible for the baby to get the extra moves via Heart Scales?   I don't think it will work."

Pokemongiveaway,3bw54m,Meganium13,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:04:51 2015 UTC,I'll probably be out then. Maybe around 3-3:30pm PST?
Pokemongiveaway,3bw54m,Meganium13,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:37:39 2015 UTC,Yes that will work for me. That's 5-5:30 CST for me I'm assuming.

Pokemongiveaway,3buksl,-Kuroh-,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:38:27 2015 UTC,"Well, when someone up.vote your comment or link post (a post that leads to somewhere else) , you earn comment karma and link karma respectively.  You'll probably increase your link karma a lot if you post a cute picture at /r/aww or something. As for comment karma, I don't really know. Just try to help others?"
Pokemongiveaway,3buksl,Rkramos91,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:19:58 2015 UTC,Got ya. Gotta try to get it up! (no pun intended)
Pokemongiveaway,3buksl,SaberMarie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:27:28 2015 UTC,You could try posting to one of the cute animal subs. I personally used /r/stoptouchingme and posted a gif of a kitten in a glass. It's relatively small so your posts aren't as likely to be lost in the flood like they would at /r/aww.

Pokemongiveaway,3buksl,SaberMarie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:24:10 2015 UTC,"30 is good. I usually run with about 30 if I'm only giving out a single type of Pokemon. It also depends on how long you're willing to sit there in the same thread, since slow traffic can make holding a giveaway painful."

Pokemongiveaway,3buksl,Zentxrno,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:24:26 2015 UTC,"Salac, Liechi/Petaya, Ganlon/Apicot. Since all of them require you to be at 25% HP or lower to activate, the defense raise isn't going to help much, the attack raising ones will help if you can throw one last attack & the speed if you need to out-speed, but that's just my opinion. :3"
Pokemongiveaway,3buksl,Meganium13,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:39:39 2015 UTC,Thank you. I'm trying to balance out the desirability of different Pokemon by giving the less desirable ones better berries. I don't know if that will work but it's worth a try.

Pokemongiveaway,3bstof,tsuk4sa,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:47:24 2015 UTC,Egg roulette would be cool but kinda hard since it needs to be direct trade.
Pokemongiveaway,3bstof,Vatalini,0,Wed Jul 1 21:52:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Would be cool to find a way to do a Hitmon roulette where you can only get one, but won't know which evolution you get til it evolves. That's kinda hard though, because the recipients can finnagle the Atk/Def stats with Super training before leveling up to get the Hitmon evo they want :("

Pokemongiveaway,3bin0y,Thump180,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:32:04 2015 UTC,"Muk and garboder, do a garbage giveaway :3"
Pokemongiveaway,3bin0y,babycutlet,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:44:08 2015 UTC,"You don't see many people doing genesect giveaways especially shiny, so that could be cool (if it's even possible? lol)  Or shiny groudon or lugia  Or just shinies in general.   People love shinies lol"
Pokemongiveaway,3bin0y,MissedtheMarx,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:54:22 2015 UTC,Jirachi!  Or Celebi!  Either or would be really cool!
Pokemongiveaway,3bin0y,verloeren,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:26:06 2015 UTC,"Hello! I don't know if mass nicknaming is possible, but if it is, what about getting several bird pokemons and nicknaming them bird. I know things like this have been done with ""dog"" and ""cat"" but I don't think anyone's done a ""bird"" yet. :P  Another GA idea can be the DerpCrew- basically anything that looks like it has no idea what's going on. (Spinda, Dusparance, Wobufett, Psyduck, etc)  I don't know how feasable or appealing these ideas are, but I just wanted to come up with something new since most giveaways are centered around ubers or mega-evolutions"

Pokemongiveaway,3bizdm,KistenGandalf,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:41:44 2015 UTC,"Does it have to be female to pass on its ability when breeding? And it doesn't matter, since I'm going to breed it."
Pokemongiveaway,3bizdm,KistenGandalf,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:47:23 2015 UTC,No but it will have a higher chance if i remember and can pass down the Pokeball
